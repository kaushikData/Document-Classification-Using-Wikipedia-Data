Hall for the Australian Department of Information during World War II to boost recruitment into the armed forces. Grant Taylor, Joe Valli and Shirley Ann Richards play fictitious characters.\n\nFive men enlist in the AIF – laid back Bill; World War I veteran Scotty, who pretends to be 37 years old; an \"old school tie\" businessman Peter, who is running his dead father's business, and whose secretary Miss Lane leaves for overseas service as a VAD; the rebellious \"Bluey\" William Baker; and Jim, who leaves behind his new wife, Jean.\n\nBluey and Bill almost get in a fight when Bluey tries to cut into the line during enlistment but the five soon become friends. The five soldiers go through basic training and become good soldiers. Bill falls for a female chiropodist working at the camp.\n\nBluey, Bill, Jim and Peter get leave and spend a day at Luna Park in Sydney with their women (Bluey has a girl called \"Blondie\"), then go to a cabaret. They all toast to the future.\n\nThe men then go to a pub before disembarking for overseas. Scotty tells his four mates that he has been kicked out the army for being too old at 48 years old.\n\nThe other four go on board while Scotty works in a munitions factory. The final scene is of the four cobbers going into action, Jim, Peter and Bill thinking of their women.\n\nThe movie ends with a quote from Henry Lawson, \"I tell you the star of the south shall rise... in the lurid clouds of war\".\n\nSome of the cast were billed with their military rank:\n\nCinesound Productions were commissioned to make the film by the Department of Information and its Minister Harry Foll. Director Ken G. Hall said he wanted to make a featurette as opposed to a documentary film. The theme of it was to \"show that a man may not have a friend in the world, but from the moment he joins the Army he has \"cobbers\" in plenty.\"\n\nFilming began on 15 September 1941 and took 14 days. Various members of the cast were granted leave from the army to appear in the film, including Grant Taylor, John Fleeting and Barry Ross.\n\nFleeting, Taylor, Joe Vallie, Lorna Westbrook, Aileen Britton and Shirley Ann Richards had all appeared in films for Ken G. Hall previously. A number of amateurs were also used in the cast. Barry Ross was an experienced stage actor.\n\n\"100,000 Cobbers\" was mostly filmed at Liverpool Military camp using national servicemen. There was also location shooting at Luna Park.\n\nShirley Ann Richards plays a chiropractor. It was her last role in Australia before leaving for Hollywood.\n\nKen Hall later recalled in his memoirs:\nIt [the film] provided a much bigger snag to make than we had expected: there were next to no troops available to make it with. The army had a few hundred militiamen in camp at Liverpool. They had been called up for national service and home defence, were raw and as yet untrained. Eighteen-year-olds formed a big percentage, and they were out to prove their manhood by stacking their own normal conversation with every four-letter word in the language. As soldiers they had a long way to go, but they were all we had. The veteran NCOs got stuck into them and soon had them in at least rough shape. There was an AIF officers' training school also in the area, with keen young men aspiring to leadership. We were mighty glad to have them, and they provided the front (close-to-camera) people we needed. I'm sure those militiamen were turned into good soldiers eventually and indeed some of them could have been among those originals at Kokoda.\nRoden Cutler was a liaison officer at Liverpool.\n\nWhile the film was originally made to increase recruitment for the AIF, after Japan entered the war additional footage was shot and the film recut to also appeal to the Australian Militia Force.\n\nThe film was previewed to the Department of Information on 29 January 1942. It was released throughout Australia as a supporting featurette in Greater Union cinemas.\n\n\"The Sydney Morning Herald\" called it \"a fine film call to the fighting youth of Australia in this grave hour... the best film Ken Hall as made and it will have particularly nostalgic appeal for old diggers... It is often a quietly moving story.\"\n\n\"The News\" of Adelaide called it \"probably the best documentary film Australia has produced... well acted, neatly produced and its action scenes are authentic and moving.\"\n\n\"The Mercury\" of Hobart wrote that Joe Valli was \"outstanding\".\n\n\"The West Australian\" wrote that:\nIt is a film for everybody, a picture everyone should see and one that no Australian can view without a feeling of pride and genuine emotion... From the time the recruits reach the enlistment depot every phase of their lives and training is presented with a realism hitherto lacking in some of our propaganda films.\nThe film was distributed in England and the US.\n\nIn 1947 the army was worried about running short of men to serve in Japan and the islands. They used the film as a recruiting tool in conjunction with the British documentary \"The True Glory\".\n\n"}

It was launched by the matchmaking site Shaadi.com to help raise awareness of dowry harassment in India.\n\nIn India, dowry is the payment in cash or other valuable property given to a bridegroom's family along with the bride. A typical dowry may include cash and jewellery.\nRequests for, and payment of, dowry were prohibited under the Dowry Prohibition Act (1961) in Indian civil law and subsequently by Sections 304B and 498a of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), but the practice still continues, illegally.\n\nIf a demanded payment is not made, the groom's family might harass or even kill the bride, often by setting her clothing on fire. The Indian police report that every year they receive over 2,500 reports of bride-burning. The National Crime Records Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, reports that there were about 8,172 dowry death cases registered in India in 2008. This represents an increase of 14.4% over the 1998 level (7,146). According to Ram Bhamidi, senior vice president of Shaadi.com, the Facebook game was developed to raise awareness of the issue.\n\nThe landing page of the game shows an eight-armed woman, clad in red and resembling the powerful female Hindu goddess Durga. Underneath her is a caption: \"A woman will give you strength, care and all the love you need ... NOT dowry!\" The game involves throwing various common household items like frying pans, rolling pins, broomsticks, and stiletto heels. In \"Angry Brides\", players strike target grooms who demand a large dowry.\nEach hit lowers the amount demanded and if the player manages to bring the dowry to zero, they can proceed to the next level.\nThe dowry-demanding grooms are portrayed as a doctor, an engineer or a pilot. The dowry demand starts at 1.5 millions (about US$30,000 or GBP18,000) and goes down with each successful hit.\n\nThe game was originally meant to be played on Facebook, but Shaadi.com announced its intentions of bringing it out on other platforms citing its success.\nThe page got 270,000 fans on Facebook who believed that it would help spread awareness about various social evils.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "540997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=540997", "title": "Balloon Fight", "text": "Balloon Fight\n\nThe player controls an unnamed Balloon Fighter with two balloons attached to his helmet. Repeatedly pressing the A button or holding down the B button causes the Balloon Fighter to flap his arms and rise into the air. If a balloon is popped, the player's flotation is decreased, making it harder to rise. A life is lost if both balloons are popped by enemy Balloon Fighters, if the player falls in the water, gets eaten by the large piranha near the surface of the water, or is hit by lightning.\n\nThere are two modes of play: the 1-player/2-player game where the goal is to clear the screen of enemies, and Balloon Trip where the goal is to avoid obstacles in a side-scrolling stage. The original arcade game does not include Balloon Trip, but all the level layouts are completely different so as to take advantage of vertical scrolling in addition to some minor gameplay differences.\n\nDefeat all of the enemies on screen to clear the stage. This mode can be played alone or co-operatively with a second player. Each player starts with three extra lives. The 3DS \"Balloon Fight\" port comes with the Download Play option, that allows you to play along with a friend that has another 3DS system.\n\nEnemy Balloon Fighters float around the screen and the player must hit their balloons to defeat them. The enemy can also fall into the water or be eaten by the fish while flying close to the water's surface. If an enemy is defeated or falls into the water, a bubble will rise up the screen which can be hit for extra points. As play progresses through the stages, the number of enemies and platforms increases.\n\nEvery three stages is a bonus stage, where the goal is to burst all of the balloons that float up the screen from the chimneys at the bottom.\n\nA single-player game where the goal is to avoid the lightning sparks and collect the balloons, aiming to move up the ranks and compete for the high score. The player starts with one life.\n\nThe home Nintendo Entertainment System version was ported to the NEC PC-8801 in October 1985, the Sharp X1 in November 1985, the Game Boy Advance as \"Balloon Fight-e\" for the e-Reader in the United States on September 16, 2002, and as part of the Famicom Mini Series in Japan on May 21, 2004. It can also be played in \"Animal Crossing\" for the GameCube.\n\nNintendo released a Game & Watch version of the same name, based on the NES version's Balloon Trip mode. The protagonist is \"a Balloon Man\". Unlike Balloon Fighters, Balloon Men use rocket suits instead of flapping their hands to elevate while holding balloons.\n\nA sequel to \"Balloon Fight\" called \"Balloon Kid\" was released on October 1990 in North America and on January 31, 1991 in Europe for the Game Boy, which expands from the game's roots and revamped it into a full platforming adventure. This title was not released in Japan on the Game Boy, but colorized versions titled as \"Hello Kitty World\" (published by \"Character Soft\") for the Famicom and \"Balloon Fight GB\" for the Game Boy Color were later released only in Japan.\n\nIn September 2001, the game was ported to the Sharp Zaurus series of PDAs.\n\nBalloon Fighter and Flipper trophies are obtainable in \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", and the Flipper is also a usable item, replacing the Bumper from the previous game. The Balloon Fighter was considered for a playable role during the development of \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", but the Ice Climbers were chosen instead. The original background music for the Balloon Trip in \"Balloon Fight\" can be heard in \"Melee\"s Icicle Mountain stage as alternate music. The giant fish makes a cameo appearance in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\". It appears on the Ice Climber-based stage, the Summit, in which it tries to attack the players from the sea. In addition, a remixed version of the main theme, titled \"Balloon Trip\" is available for the Summit stage as well. Stickers of the Balloon Fighter and the Balloon Fight Enemy can be collected in \"Brawl\". In addition, the Villager from the \"Animal Crossing\" series uses the Balloon Fighter's helmet as one of his special moves in \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U\". In the 3DS version of the same game, a stage based on \"Balloon Fight\" appears with the original 8-bit graphics; the same stage returns in \"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\".\n\nIn the \"WarioWare, Inc.\" series, some of 9-Volt's games are based on \"Balloon Fight\". In \"\", there is also a minigame functioning as a three-dimensional version of Balloon Trip; players use the Wii Remote only for the microgame version, and also use the Nunchuk in the complete 3D Balloon Trip.\n\nThe original tech demo for \"Yoshi Touch & Go\" was called \"Yoshi's Balloon Trip\". \"Balloon Fight\" is the theme for Touch Mode in \"Tetris DS\", although the mode itself has almost nothing to do with the game other than the music and decorative graphics.\n\nOn April 12, 2007, Club Nintendo released \"Tingle's Balloon Fight\" for the Nintendo DS, an exclusive game featuring Tingle, a Nintendo character who originated from \"The Legend of Zelda\" series. The game is a remake of the home version, featuring the \"Balloon Fight\" and \"Balloon Trip\" modes. The levels are expanded slightly to utilize both screens, similar to the arcade game except based entirely around the NES levels. A gallery that contained concept art was also included, where each piece could be unlocked by completing specific in-game tasks.\n\nThe Balloon Fighter appears in \"Super Mario Maker\" as an unlockable Mystery Mushroom costume as part of an update.\n\n\"Balloon Fight\" has been re-released as part of Nintendo's Virtual Console. On June 8, 2007, \"Balloon Fight\" was released in Europe, followed by a release in North America on July 16, 2007, and Japan on November 12, 2007. The game was released on Virtual Console for Nintendo 3DS as part of that system's Ambassador Program in September 2011.\n\nIn \"Nintendo Land\", there is an attraction called Balloon Trip Breeze, that is very similar to Balloon Trip from the original \"Balloon Fight\". \n\nThe game was released on the Wii U Virtual Console service on January 23, 2013 in North America until February 23, 2013 as part of a promotion celebrating the 30th anniversary of the release of the original Nintendo Famicom. \"Balloon Fight\" became the first Wii U Virtual Console title to be released. \nOn November 11, 2016, the game (alongside 29 other games) was included in the NES Classic Edition (Nintendo Classic Mini in Europe).\n\nBalloon Fight along with \"Dr. Mario\" and \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" is offered for those who subscribe to the Nintendo Switch online service for free which also includes added online play.\n"}

{"id": "1257839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1257839", "title": "Canadian humour", "text": "Canadian humour\n\nCanadian humour is an integral part of the Canadian Identity. There are several traditions in Canadian humour in both English and French. While these traditions are distinct and at times very different, there are common themes that relate to Canadians' shared history and geopolitical situation in North America and the world. Though neither universally kind nor moderate, humorous Canadian literature has often been branded by author Dick Bourgeois-Doyle as \"gentle satire,\" evoking the notion embedded in humorist Stephen Leacock's definition of humour as \"the kindly contemplation of the incongruities of life and the artistic expression thereof.\"\n\nThe primary characteristics of Canadian humour are irony, parody, and satire. Various trends can be noted in Canadian comedy. One thread is the portrayal of a \"typical\" Canadian family in an ongoing radio or television series. Examples include \"La famille Plouffe\", with its mix of drama, humour, politics and religion and sitcoms such as \"King of Kensington\" and \"La Petite Vie\". Another major thread tends to be political and cultural satire: television shows such as \"CODCO,\" \"Royal Canadian Air Farce\", \"La Fin du monde est à 7 heures\" and \"This Hour Has 22 Minutes,\" monologuists such as Yvon Deschamps and Rick Mercer and writers, including Michel Tremblay, Will Ferguson and Eric Nicol draw their material from Canadian and Québécois society and politics. Other comedians portray absurdity; these include the television series \"The Kids in the Hall\" and \"The Frantics,\" and musician-comedians such as The Arrogant Worms, Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie and Bowser and Blue. Elements of satire are to be found throughout Canadian humour, evident in each of these threads, and uniting various genres and regional cultural differences.\n\nAs with other countries, humour at the expense of regional and ethnic stereotypes can be found in Canada. Examples are 'Newfie' jokes (with 'Newfie' being a colloquial term for a person from the island of Newfoundland) and jokes revolving around English-speaking Canadians' stereotype of French Canadians, and vice versa.\n\nHumber College in Toronto and the École nationale de l'humour in Montreal offer post-secondary programs in comedy writing and performance. Montreal is also home to the bilingual (English and French) Just for Laughs festival and to the Just for Laughs museum, a bilingual, international museum of comedy.\n\nAccording to author Stephen Scobie, Canadian humorous writing has tended more towards prose than poetry. An early work of Canadian humour, Thomas McCulloch's \"Letters of Mephibosheth Stepsure\" (1821–23) appeared in the Halifax weekly \"Acadian Recorder\". Northrop Frye described McCulloch's satirical letters as \"quiet, observant, deeply conservative in a human sense\"; he asserted that McCulloch's persona, the \"conventional, old-fashioned, homespun\" farmer, was an extension of a centuries-old satiric tradition, and that the letters set the tone for later comedic writing in Canada.\n\nCompared to McCulloch's dry and understated style, Thomas Chandler Haliburton showed the same conservative social values in the brash, overstated character of Sam Slick, the Yankee Clockmaker. Haliburton's Sam Slick persona in \"The Clockmaker\" (1836), as Arthur Scobie notes in \"The Canadian Encyclopedia\", \"proved immensely popular and, ironically, has influenced American humour as much as Canadian.\"\n\nAuthors responded with folk humour and satire to the domination of 19th-century French Canadian culture by the Catholic Church. Napoléon Aubin satirized Quebec public life in his journals \"Le Fantasque\" (1837–45) and \"Le Castor\" (1843), and through his theatre troupe, \"Les Amateurs typographiques, \" established in 1839. He was imprisoned during that same year for his views. This cosmopolitan tradition is also seen in the journalism of Arthur Buies, editor of \"La Lanterne canadienne\" (1868–69), a highly satirical journal of that era.\n\nLight comedy that mocked local customs was typical of 19th-century theatre in Quebec. Examples include Joseph Quesnel's \"L'Anglomanie, ou le dîner à l'angloise\" (1803), which criticized the imitation of English customs, and Pierre Petitclair's \"Une partie de campagne\" (1865). More serious dramas attacked specific targets: the anonymous \"Les Comédies du status quo\" (1834) ridiculed local politics, and \"Le Défricheteur de langue\" (1859) by Isodore Mesplats, (pseudonym of Joseph LaRue and Joseph-Charles Taché), mocked Parisian manners. Other examples of theatrical satire were Félix-Gabriel Marchand's comedy, \"Les faux brillants\" (1885) and Louvigny de Montigny's \"Les Boules de neige\" (1903), which took aim at Montreal's bourgeoisie. Humorous magazines in French included \"La Guêpe\", \"journal qui pique\", published in Montreal 1857-1861.\n\nBy the early 20th century, the satirical tradition was well developed in English Canada as exemplified in the writing of Stephen Leacock. In \"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town\" (1912), Leacock, already known for his satirical wit, used tragic irony and astute insight in examining day-to-day, small-town life. The book remains a classic of Canadian literature, and was followed by \"Arcadian Adventures with the Idle Rich\" in 1914. An annual Canadian literary award, the Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour, is named in his memory. The award is presented to the year's best work of humorous literature by a Canadian. Donald Jack, three-time winner of the Leacock Medal, wrote a number of comedies for the stage, radio, and television, but is best known for his nine-part series of novels about aviator Bartholomew Bandy.\n\nFollowing the \"Révolution tranquille\" in Quebec, theatrical satire reappeared in 1968 with Michel Tremblay's play \"Les Belles sœurs,\" written in Québécois joual. The controversial play picked apart the myth of a stable bourgeois Quebec society with a mix of realistic comedy and allegorical satire. Following Tremblay's lead, Jean Barbeau exposed Quebec popular culture in \"La Coupe stainless\" (1974). Tremblay and Barbeau set the stage for reviews such as \"Broue\" (1979), a collective production, which toured English-speaking Canada as \"Brew\" (1982).\n\nHumorous fiction in French Canada draws from the oral tradition of folk songs and folktales which were the common coin of humour in the 19th century. Only a few of these folk tales surfaced in writing prior to the 20th century. However, contemporary writers such as Jacques Ferron (\"Contes du pays incertain,\" 1962) in Quebec and Antonine Maillet in Acadian New Brunswick (\"La Sagouine,\" 1974, and \"Pélagie-la-Charette,\" 1979), rely extensively on folk humour and popular culture. Other Quebec writers noted for their humour include Roger Lemelin, Gérard Bessette, Jacques Godbout, Roch Carrier and Yves Beauchemin. Beauchemin's picaresque novel \"Le Matou\" (1981) is the all-time best-selling novel in Quebec literature.\n\nThe plain talking alter-ego as an instrument of satire continued with Robertson Davies' series of Samuel Marchbanks books (1947–67) and John Metcalf's James Wells in \"General Ludd\" (1980). Davies is one of many Canadian writers of \"serious\" literature who were also known for humour in their work. Margaret Atwood, Farley Mowat, Paul Quarrington, Mordecai Richler, Raymond Fraser, Carol Shields, W. O. Mitchell, Ray Guy, Pierre Berton, M.A.C. Farrant and Miriam Toews are all well-known writers of mainstream literature who have also been acknowledged for using humour and wit in their writing. Many other writers of Canadian humour have been published as newspaper or magazine commentators, including Gary Lautens, Richard J. Needham, Eric Nicol, Joey Slinger, Will Ferguson, Marsha Boulton and Linwood Barclay.\n\nHumour is also central to the work of Canadian children's writers such as Gordon Korman, Dennis Lee and Robert Munsch.\n\nParticularly in recent years, Canada has produced a number of musical groups who have been described as \"comedy rock\". Bands such as Barenaked Ladies, Odds, Crash Test Dummies, The Awkward Stage and Rheostatics are sometimes misunderstood as being strictly novelty bands, but in fact many of their songs use humour to illuminate more serious themes. A number of other acts, such as Corky and the Juice Pigs, Arrogant Worms, Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie and Bowser and Blue write specifically comedic songs.\n\nNancy White is a noted Canadian musical satirist, whose comedic folk songs about Canadian culture and politics have regularly appeared on CBC Radio programs.\n\nIn addition to more serious material on his primary albums, folk musician Geoff Berner — who has also run for political office as a candidate of the Rhinoceros Party — frequently releases pointedly satirical songs, such as \"Official Theme Song for the 2010 Vancouver / Whistler Olympic Games (The Dead Children Were Worth It!)\", as free downloads from his website.\n\nDon Ast, a stand-up comedian who performed in character as befuddled Ukrainian immigrant Nestor Pistor, had his greatest popular success with an album in which he sang country songs in character as Pistor. His single \"Winestoned Plowboy\", a parody of Glen Campbell's \"Rhinestone Cowboy\", was a hit on Canada's country music charts in 1977; Pistor returned to more conventional standup comedy thereafter, but received three Juno Award nominations for Comedy Album of the Year in the next three years.\n\nJann Arden, a singer-songwriter renowned for writing sad love songs, is also paradoxically known as one of Canada's funniest live performers, whose witty, unpretentious stage patter about herself and her family is as much a part of her relationship with her audience as her music is. Hip hop musician Shad is also known for using comedy and humour in his music; for one of his most successful singles to date, \"The Old Prince Still Lives at Home\", he filmed a video in which he essentially played Will Smith in a parody of the opening credits to \"The Fresh Prince of Bel Air\".\n\nAnother noted Canadian musical comedian is Mary Lou Fallis, an opera singer who performs both in classical opera roles and as the comedic character \"Primadonna\", a touring stage show in which she parodies popular stereotypes of opera divas.\n\nCanadian heavy metal frontman Devin Townsend is known for using humour in his music. Projects such as Punky Bruster and Ziltoid the Omniscient are heavily comedy driven, and Devin's heavy metal band, Strapping Young Lad, use satire and sarcastic tongue in cheek lyrics as well.\n\nMany of Canada's comedy acts and performers have started out on radio, primarily on the national Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) network.\n\nWhile individual comedy show and segments have been around almost as long as the network, the focus has tended be more on specific shows featuring particular groups of comedians. The real beginnings of Canadian radio comedy began in the late 1930s with the debut of \"The Happy Gang\", a long-running weekly variety show that was regularly sprinkled with corny jokes in between tunes. It debuted in 1938 and ran until 1959. The \"Wayne & Shuster\" show debuted on CBC radio in 1946, their more literate and classy humour regularly appearing on the airwaves well into the early 1960s.\nMax Ferguson's long-running shows \"After Breakfast Breakdown\" and \"the Max Ferguson Show\" featured short satirical skits based on current events, with a variety of characters voiced by Ferguson.\n\nThe \"Royal Canadian Air Farce\" started as a radio show debuting in 1973 featuring mainly political and some character-based comedy sketches. It ran for 24 years before making a permanent transition to television. It started a tradition of topical and politically satirical radio shows that inspired such programs as \"Double Exposure\", \"The Muckraker\" and \"What a Week\".\n\nA zanier, more surreal brand of radio comedy was unveiled in the early 1980s with the debut of The Frantics' \"Frantic Times\" radio show, which ran from 1981 to 1986. Its smart and surreal style fostered a new take on Canadian radio comedy that was followed by the likes of successor shows as \"The Norm\", \"Radio Free Vestibule\" and \"The Irrelevant Show\".\n\nAnother enduring radio comedy program is \"The Vinyl Cafe\", hosted by Stuart McLean. The show is centred around McLean's Dave and Morley stories, a series of narrated short stories about a Toronto family and their friends and neighbours; many of the stories have been compiled in book form, and the books have often won or been nominated for the Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour.\n\nBy the 1990s the satirical and zany elements merged into two of the more notable CBC radio comedy shows of the 1990s: \"The Dead Dog Cafe Comedy Hour\", a show that offered bitingly satirical pieces from a First Nations perspective mixed in with general silliness; and \"Great Eastern\", a show set in a fictitious Newfoundland \"national\" radio station featuring improbable news stories, fictitious archival recordings and unlikely archeological findings played straight.\n\nCBC Radio continues to play an important part in developing comedy performers on radio. \"Madly Off In All Directions\" became a weekly national forum for regional sketch and stand-up comics, a practice that continues in the more recent series \"The Debaters\" and \"Laugh Out Loud\".\n\nLaugh Attack, a channel programmed by XM Radio Canada and broadcast by XM Satellite Radio to Canada and the United States, features predominantly Canadian comedy.\n\nCBC Television's first Canadian-produced television series was \"Sunshine Sketches\", an adaptation of Stephen Leacock's iconic humour book \"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town\".\n\nOriginal Canadian television comedy begins with Wayne and Shuster, a sketch comedy duo who performed as a comedy team during the Second World War, and moved their act to radio in 1946 before moving on to television. They became one of Canada's most enduring comedy teams on Canadian television and in the United States as well: they appeared on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" 67 times, a record for any performer. Their Julius Caesar sketch, \"Rinse the Blood off My Toga\", with its legendary catchphrase, \"I told him, Julie, don't go!\", was particularly noted.\n\nWayne and Shuster continued to appear on CBC Television until the late 1980s, with specials that mixed new sketches with their classic material.\n\n\"La famille Plouffe\", the first regularly scheduled television drama in Canada, was produced in 1953 by Radio-Canada, in French. The program was broadcast on both English and French networks of CBC TV from 1954 to 1959, (in English as \"The Plouffe Family\"). It was a mix of drama, humour and social commentary about a working-class Quebec family in the post-World War II era. Another of the CBC's earliest productions was a television adaptation of one of the enduring classics of Canadian humour writing, Stephen Leacock's \"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town\".\n\nAnother pioneer in Canadian television comedy was, oddly, a news series. \"This Hour Has Seven Days,\" which debuted in 1964, was primarily meant as a newsmagazine, but its segments included political satire as well as serious news reports. Later series such as \"Royal Canadian Air Farce\", \"This Hour Has 22 Minutes\" and \"Rick Mercer Report\" have all drawn on the tradition of political satire established by \"Seven Days\", and have been among Canadian television's most popular comedy series in recent years.\n\nCanadian born Lorne Michaels, who had moved from Toronto to Los Angeles in 1968 to work on Rowan and Martin's \"Laugh-In\", launched the NBC comedy show \"Saturday Night Live\" in 1975. Over the years, several Canadians were part of the SNL cast, including Dan Aykroyd, Martin Short, and Mike Myers. Michaels also produced \"The Kids in the Hall\" for Canadian TV in the 1980s.\n\nMany Canadian comedy shows, while not directly about politics per se, have made profound political statements by satirizing society and pop culture. This includes shows such as \"SCTV\", \"Buzz\" and \"CODCO\". \"CODCO\", in particular, was intensely controversial at times for its use of comedy in tackling sensitive subjects; founding member Andy Jones quit CODCO in protest after the CBC refused to air a sketch that made a very explicit political statement about the Mount Cashel Orphanage child abuse scandal. The series \"History Bites\" was ostensibly a show presenting history in a sketch comedy, but frequently used the historic setting to satirize current political events and social trends.\n\nOther shows, such as \"The Kids in the Hall\", \"4 on the Floor\", \"Bizarre\" and \"Puppets Who Kill\", revelled in absurdist humour, making household names out of characters such as Chicken Lady, Mr. Canoehead and Super Dave Osborne.\n\nOther notable sketch series have included \"Zut!\", \"The Gavin Crawford Show\" and \"The Holmes Show\". Canadian television also frequently showcases stand-up comedians. The popular series \"Comics\", based around one comedian each week, has been the first national television exposure for many of Canada's current comedy stars. Another series, \"Just for Laughs\", has for many years presented comedians appearing at the Montreal Comedy Festival. That series has also spawned the more recent \"Just For Laughs Gags\", a practical joke show similar to \"Candid Camera\".\n\nAlthough several notable Canadian sitcoms have been produced, such as \"King of Kensington\", \"Hangin' In\", \"Corner Gas,\" \"Little Mosque on the Prairie\", and \"Kim's Convenience\", many other sitcoms, including \"Material World\", \"Mosquito Lake\", \"Snow Job\", \"Check it Out!\", \"The Trouble with Tracy\", \"Rideau Hall\", \"Excuse My French\" and \"Not My Department\", have generally fared poorly with critics and audiences. Critic Geoff Pevere has pointed out, however, that American television has produced a lot of bad sitcoms as well. The difference, according to Pevere, is that the economics of television production in Canada mean that whereas an unpopular American sitcom may be cancelled and largely forgotten after just a few weeks, Canadian television networks can rarely afford to lose their investment — meaning that a Canadian sitcom almost always airs every episode that was produced, \"regardless\" of its performance in the ratings.\n\nOn the other hand, Canadian television comedy fares much better when it breaks the sitcom form, especially with dramedy. Unconventional comedy series such as \"The Beachcombers\", \"Due South\", \"Made in Canada\", \"Chilly Beach\", \"The Newsroom\", \"Primetime Glick\", \"The Red Green Show\", \"La Petite Vie\", \"Seeing Things\", \"Trailer Park Boys\", \"Supertown Challenge\", \"Les Bougon\" and \"Twitch City\" have been much more successful than most of Canada's conventional sitcoms, both in Canada and as international exports.\n\nCanada has a national television channel, The Comedy Network, devoted to comedy. Its programming includes some of the classic Canadian comedy series noted above, repeats of several hit American and British series such as \"The Simpsons\", \"South Park\" and \"Absolutely Fabulous\", and original series such as \"Kevin Spencer\", \"Odd Job Jack\", \"The Devil's Advocates\", \"Improv Heaven and Hell\" and \"Puppets Who Kill\".\n\nRick Mercer began his career in 1990 with a touring one-man show, \"Show Me the Button, I'll Push It\", about Canadian life in the immediate aftermath of the failed Meech Lake Accord. That show was a sellout success; in 1993, he made his television debut as one of the writers and performers on \"This Hour Has 22 Minutes\". Mercer's \"rants\", short op-ed pieces on Canadian politics and culture, quickly became the show's signature segment. When he published a collection of rants in 1998 as \"Streeters\", the book quickly became a bestseller. Mercer left \"22 Minutes\" in 2000 to devote more time to his other series, \"Made in Canada\". When that series ended its run, he launched the new \"Rick Mercer Report\".\n\nAnother famous comedic export in the same era was Tom Green, whose surreal and sometimes grotesque humour on \"The Tom Green Show\" began as a community cable show in Ottawa before becoming a hit on MTV.\n\nAs with many other genres, Canadian television comedy also frequently plays with the topic of Canada's relationship with the United States. Mercer turned another \"22 Minutes\" segment, \"Talking to Americans\", into a 2001 television special, which was a ratings smash. In \"Talking to Americans\", Mercer, in his \"22 Minutes\" guise as reporter \"J.B. Dixon\", visited American cities to ask people on the street for their opinion on a Canadian news story — the joke for Canadians was that the news story was always fabricated, and either inherently ridiculous (e.g. a border dispute between Quebec and Chechnya or an annual Toronto polar bear hunt) or blatantly out of context (e.g. wishing Canadians a \"Happy Stockwell Day\".)\n\nAnother notable show, the sitcom \"An American in Canada\", reversed that formula, finding comedy in the culture shock of an American television reporter taking a job with a Canadian TV station. Tom Green once played with this staple of Canadian comedy as well, during a controversial segment in which he burned a Canadian flag.\n\nIn the same vein as \"Air Farce\" and \"22 Minutes\", a number of notable web sites have emerged to publish articles that either satirize real events or wholly invent stories that lampoon aspects of Canadian culture. Frank magazine, which originated as a printed publication, has been joined in recent years by The Lapine, The Beaverton and Mooseclean's, the latter of which are modeled after The Onion and Maclean's, respectively.\n\nNotable Canadian comedy clubs and showcases include The Second City branch in Toronto (originally housed at The Old Fire Hall), the Yuk Yuk's chain, and The ALTdot COMedy Lounge. The top clubs in Canada are Rumor's Comedy Club in Winnipeg, The Comic Strip in Edmonton, The Comedy Mix in Vancouver, and Absolute Comedy in Toronto.\n\nThe Canadian Comedy Awards were founded by Tim Progosh and Higher Ground Productions in 1999. Over the past eight years they have given out more than 160 awards in three categories - live comedy, film and television.\n\n"}

Eisemann Center for Performing Arts\n\nThe Charles W. Eisemann Center for Performing Arts and Corporate Presentations is a performance hall which opened in September 2002 in Richardson, Texas. The center is named for local philanthropist, Charles W. Eisemann, in recognition of a US$2,000,000 gift from the Eisemann Foundation Fund of The Communities Foundation of Texas.\n\nThe Eisemann Center is designed to meet the needs of both the performing arts and corporate worlds. The Center features the Margaret and Al Hill Performance Hall, the Bank of America Theatre and the Bank of America Hall. All venues are supported by a generous lobby on three levels. Designed by architect Eurico R. Francisco, AIA, the building was honored with design awards from the American Institute of Architects in 2001 (\"Unbuilt Honor Award\") and again in 2003 (\"Built Honor Award\"), in addition to receiving a \"Best of Texas Award\" for buildings over $50 million from McGraw Hill in 2002. David Dillon, the late architecture critic for the Dallas Morning News and Architecture Record, described the Eisemann Center as \"...bold, contemporary and every bit the civic showpiece that city officials have been hoping for. (...) Architect Eurico Francisco has based his design on classic modernist principles: light, transparency, clean details and honest use of materials. Not a faux column or cornice anywhere. Although the Eisemann does not break new ground, it covers familiar territory with grace and assurance. (...) Collectively, (these details) make the difference between a static building and a dynamic one. They force us to look at things a second time, to question and to explore, which is what good architecture is supposed to do.\"\n\nThe Margaret and Al Hill Performance Hall is a 1,563-seat venue, and is noted as one of the largest stage areas in the DFW Metroplex. The construction of this hall was designed to meet the production needs for any performing arts group producing dance, opera, musical theatre as well as other events. By featuring a full working stage house, an adjustable proscenium opening, orchestra pit and lift, customized Wenger orchestra shell, . of stage space, wood sprung floor and a full lighting and sound package, the Hill Performance Hall can accommodate most any production. The audience chamber was built with acoustically sculpted natural wood-clad walls which assist in diminishing sound vibrations for symphonic music, dance, theatre, opear and a wide range of concerts and other events. \nBuilt as a flexible and versatile performance space the Bank of America Theatre seats between 230 and 400 people, depending on the configuration. The venue features a full working stage house of 55 ft., a proscenium opening of . wide, and . of stage space. The space can also be converted to a thrust or full round performance venue by extending the stage into the middle of the audience chamber. In addition, an exposed catwalk system allows lighting from all angles.\nThe Bank of America Hall provides space for hosting private receptions, banquets, meetings, seminars, recitals, small tradeshows and exhibits. The . room features a barrel vaulted ceiling, cove lighting, hardwood flooring and a full range of A/V production equipment. A catering prep kitchen is located adjacent to the room to assist caterers with servicing these occasions. Depending on the setup of the room, it can hold up to 180 for a seated dinner and up to 300 for receptions. Pre/post-event activities may also be held in the Bank of America Hall in conjunction with the use of the larger performance venue. \nThe Eisemann Center offers patrons a . lobby spanning three distinct levels. The Leftwich Grand Foyer features a high ceiling, concession area and ticket office. A staircase leads up to the Green Mezzanine-Gallery which features the art gallery while another staircase takes patrons to the TXU Lobby and the Bank of America Hall. Cast-stone and natural wood walls, terrazzo floors and a wide expanse of glass create a dramatic and welcoming sense of occasion.\n\nThe ticket office handles all online purchases as well as walk-up sales, telephone, fax and mail inquiries.\nThe City of Richardson and supporters of the Charles W. Eisemann Center celebrated the completion and unveiling of the lightpainting “Seven Muses” by artist Stephen Knapp in April 2006. The commission of the lightpainting was made possible by a gift to the City from Jim and Gayla Von Ehr of Richardson.\n\nIn an interview with Adrienne Garnett in Art of the Times, Knapp, when asked about “Seven Muses” said, “I want people to see and feel the energy that is emanating from the center of it. I want people to see the subtleties, not just the bright colors that are associated with my work. A lot of time is dedicated to making this about discovering extraordinary possibilities with light.” \n\nThe Eisemann Center is part of an urban village setting. The Center is between the Renaissance Dallas-Richardson Hotel and the Galatyn Park light rail station to the west and a number of multi-use buildings to the east and southeast including offices, restaurants, and residential complexes.\n\nA public plaza features a water fountain.\nIn 2008, the Eisemann Center received a $500,000USD grant from the Texas Instruments Foundation, to be used for a variety of projects that included a custom designed orchestra shell for the theater, additional interior and exterior signage, sound and lighting system upgrades, audiovisual equipment enhancements and facility system upgrades to enhance patron comfort.\n\nIn a City Council worksession on October 26, 2009, Eisemann Center management gave a status update on the Eisemann Center Foundation as well as on the capital improvements funded by the grant.\n\nThe Eisemann Center Foundation is used as a mechanism to receive philanthropic donations toward the Eisemann Center that need to be made to a 501c(3) organization. It was incorporated in the State of Texas in March, 2002, and was granted recognition as a charitable foundation by the IRS in July, 2002. This determination was reaffirmed by the IRS in December, 2006.\n\nThe Foundation states, \"[t]he primary purpose of the Corporation is to assist the City of Richardson, Texas and local groups and organizations to promote, support, improve and enhance the visual and performing arts at the Charles W.

{"id": "235288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=235288", "title": "Courage Under Fire", "text": "Courage Under Fire\n\nCourage Under Fire is a 1996 American war film directed by Edward Zwick, and starring Denzel Washington and Meg Ryan. It is the second collaboration between Washington and director Zwick. The film was released in the United States on July 12, 1996.\n\nWhile serving in the Gulf War, Lieutenant Colonel Serling (Denzel Washington) accidentally destroys one of his own tanks during a confusing night-time battle, killing his friend, Captain Boylar. The US Army covers up the details and transfers Serling to a desk job.\n\nLater, Serling is assigned to determine if Captain Karen Emma Walden (Meg Ryan) should be the first woman to receive a (posthumous) Medal of Honor. She was the commander of a Medevac Huey that was sent to rescue the crew of a shot-down Black Hawk. When she encountered a T-54, her crew destroyed it by dropping a fuel bladder onto the tank and igniting it with a flare gun. However, her own helicopter was shot down soon after. The two crews were unable to join forces, and when the survivors were rescued the next day, Walden was reported dead.\n\nSerling notices inconsistencies between the testimonies of Walden's crew. Specialist Andrew Ilario (Matt Damon), the medic, praises Walden strongly. However, Staff Sergeant John Monfriez (Lou Diamond Phillips) claims that Walden was a coward and that he led the crew in combat and improvised the fuel bladder weapon. Sergeant Altameyer, who is dying in a hospital, complains about a fire. Warrant Officer One Rady, the co-pilot, was injured early on and unconscious throughout. Furthermore, the crew of the Black Hawk claim that they heard firing from an M16, but Ilario and Monfriez deny they had one.\n\nUnder pressure from the White House and his commander, Brigadier General Hershberg (Michael Moriarty), to wrap things up quickly, Serling leaks the story to a newspaper reporter, Tony Gartner (Scott Glenn), to prevent another cover-up. When Serling grills Monfriez during a car ride, Monfriez forces him to get out of the vehicle at gunpoint, then commits suicide by driving into an oncoming train.\n\nSerling tracks Ilario down, and Ilario finally tells him the truth. Monfriez wanted to flee, which would mean abandoning Rady. When Walden refused, he pulled a gun on her. Walden then shot an enemy who appeared behind Monfriez, but Monfriez thought Walden was firing at him and shot her in the stomach, before backing off. The next morning, the enemy attacked again as a rescue party approached. Walden covered her men's retreat, firing an M16. However, Monfriez told the rescuers that Walden was dead, so they left without her. Napalm was then dropped on the entire area. Altameyer tried to expose Monfriez's lie at the time, but was too injured to speak, and Ilario was too scared of the court-martial Walden had threatened them with and remained silent.\n\nSerling presents his final report to Hershberg. Walden's young daughter receives the Medal of Honor at a White House ceremony. Later, Serling tells the truth to the Boylars about the manner of their son's death and says he cannot ask for forgiveness. The Boylars tell Serling he must release his burden at some point and grant him their forgiveness.\n\nIn the last moments, Serling has a flashback of when he was standing by Boylar's destroyed tank and a medevac Huey was lifting off with his friend's body. Serling suddenly realises Walden was the Huey pilot.\n\n\nThe U.S. Department of Defense withdrew its cooperation for the film so the tanks Serling commanded early in the film were British Centurions shipped from Australia with sheet metal added to make them resemble M1A1 Abrams. These visually modified tanks were subsequently used to simulate the Abrams in several other motion pictures.\n\nROTC Cadets from Texas A&M University were used as extras in the background in some of the training camp scenes.\n\nThe film draws reference to Walden and her crew assisting the crew of a downed Black Hawk helicopter. However, the scene shows the wrecked fuselage of a Huey. This is due to the Department of Defense withdrawing its cooperation. There were no privately owned Black Hawk fuselages available to acquire for the film. The parts of the script making reference to the Black Hawk had already been shot, so rather than change the whole film to adapt it to a Huey, the producers left it as Black Hawk and used a wrecked fuselage of a Huey for the desert shots in the hope not many viewers would notice the discrepancy.\n\nThe Iraqi battle scenes were filmed at the Indian Cliffs Ranch just outside El Paso, Texas. Many of the props were left there and became a tourist attraction. The White House Rose Garden set was destroyed twice: once by a tornado, and once by a sandstorm.\n\nIn order to lose 40 pounds (18 kilograms) for the later scenes, Matt Damon went on a strict regimen of food deprivation and physical training. On \"Inside the Actors Studio\", Damon said that the regimen consisted of six and a half miles of running in the morning and again at night, a diet of chicken breast, egg whites, and one plain baked potato per day, and a large amount of coffee and cigarettes. His health was affected to the extent that he had to have medical supervision for several months afterwards. His efforts, however, did not go unnoticed; director Francis Ford Coppola was so impressed by Damon's dedication to method acting that he offered him the leading role in \"The Rainmaker\" (1997). Steven Spielberg was also impressed by his performance, but thought he was too skinny and discounted him from casting considerations for \"Saving Private Ryan\" until he met Damon during the filming of \"Good Will Hunting\", by which time he was back at his normal weight.\n\n\nThe film opened #3 at the box office behind \"Independence Day\" and \"Phenomenon\"\n\nThe film received mostly positive reviews. As of January 14, 2013, the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 85% of critics gave the film a positive review based upon a sample of 53 reviews with an average rating of 7.3/10. The critical consensus states that the film is \"an emotional and intriguing tale of a military officer who must review the merits of a fallen officer while confronting his own war demons. Effectively depicts the terrors of war as well as its heartbreaking aftermath.\" At the website Metacritic, which uses a weighted average rating system, the film earned a generally favorable rating of 77/100 based on 19 mainstream critic reviews.\n\nThe movie was commended by several critics. James Berardinelli of the website ReelViews wrote that the film was, \"As profound and intelligent as it is moving, and that makes this memorable motion picture one of 1996's best.\" Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" spoke positively of the film saying that while the ending \"…lays on the emotion a little heavily\" the movie had been up until that point \"…a fascinating emotional and logistical puzzle—almost a courtroom movie, with the desert as the courtroom.\"\n\nDenzel Washington's acting was specifically lauded, as Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" wrote, \"In Washington's haunted eyes, in the stunning cinematography of Roger Deakins (\"Fargo\") that plunges into the mad flare of combat, in the plot that deftly turns a whodunit into a meditation on character and in Zwick's persistent questioning of authority, \"Courage Under Fire\" honors its subject and its audience.\" Additionally Peter Stack of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" wrote that \"Denzel Washington is riveting.\"\n\nDenzel Washington was nominated for Best Actor at the 1996 Chicago Film Critics Association Awards, but lost to Billy Bob Thornton in \"Sling Blade\".\n\nThe Medal of Honor had previously been awarded to a woman, Mary Edwards Walker, an American Civil War physician, but not for valor in combat. Walker's award had been revoked in 1917 and was restored in 1977.\n\n"}
{"id": "3447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3447", "title": "Cue sports", "text": "Cue sports\n\nCue sports (sometimes written cuesports), also known as billiard sports, \nare a wide variety of games of skill generally played with a cue stick, which is used to strike billiard balls and thereby cause them to move around a cloth-covered billiards table bounded by elastic bumpers known as .\n\nHistorically, the umbrella term was billiards. While that familiar name is still employed by some as a generic label for all such games, the word's usage has splintered into more exclusive competing meanings in various parts of the world. For example, in British and Australian English, \"billiards\" usually refers exclusively to the game of English billiards, while in American and Canadian English it is sometimes used to refer to a particular game or class of games, or to all cue games in general, depending upon dialect and context. In colloquial usage, the term \"billiards\" may be used colloquially to refer to pocket billiards games, such as pool, snooker, or Russian pyramid.\n\nThere are 3 major subdivisions of games within cue sports:\n\n\nThere are other variants that make use of obstacles and targets, and table-top games played with disks instead of balls.\n\nBilliards has a long and rich history stretching from its inception in the 15th century, to the wrapping of the body of Mary, Queen of Scots, in her billiard table cover in 1586, through its many mentions in the works of Shakespeare, including the famous line \"let's to billiards\" in \"Antony and Cleopatra\" (1606–07), and through the many famous enthusiasts of the sport such as: Mozart, Louis XIV of France, Marie Antoinette, Immanuel Kant, Napoleon, Abraham Lincoln, Mark Twain, George Washington, French president Jules Grévy, Charles Dickens, George Armstrong Custer, Theodore Roosevelt, Lewis Carroll, W.C. Fields, Babe Ruth, Bob Hope, and Jackie Gleason.\n\nAll cue sports are generally regarded to have evolved into indoor games from outdoor stick-and-ball lawn games (retroactively termed ground billiards), and as such to be related to the historical games jeu de mail and palle-malle, and modern trucco, croquet and golf, and more distantly to the stickless bocce and bowls.\nThe word \"billiard\" may have evolved from the French word \"billart\" or \"billette\", meaning \"stick\", in reference to the , an implement similar to a golf club, which was the forerunner to the modern cue; the term's origin may have also been from French \"bille\", meaning \"ball\". The modern term \"cue sports\" can be used to encompass the ancestral mace games, and even the modern cueless variants, such as finger billiards, for historical reasons. \"Cue\" itself came from \"queue\", the French word for a tail. This refers to the early practice of using the tail of the mace to strike the ball when it lay against a .\nA recognizable form of billiards was played outdoors in the 1340s, and was reminiscent of croquet. King Louis XI of France (1461–1483) had the first known indoor billiard table. Louis XIV further refined and popularized the game, and it swiftly spread among the French nobility. While the game had long been played on the ground, this version appears to have died out in the 17th century, in favor of croquet, golf and bowling games, while table billiards had grown in popularity as an indoor activity. Mary, Queen of Scots, claimed that her \"table de billiard\" had been taken away by those who eventually became her executioners (and who covered her body with the table's cloth). Billiards grew to the extent that by 1727, it was being played in almost every Paris café. In England, the game was developing into a very popular activity for members of the gentry.\n\nBy 1670, the thin butt end of the mace began to be used not only for shots under the cushion (which itself was originally only there as a preventative method to stop balls from rolling off), but players increasingly preferred it for other shots as well. The cue as it is known today was finally developed by about 1800.\n\nInitially, the mace was used to push the balls, rather than strike them. The newly developed striking cue provided a new challenge. Cushions began to be stuffed with substances to allow the balls to rebound, in order to enhance the appeal of the game. After a transitional period where only the better players would use cues, the cue came to be the first choice of equipment.\n\nThe demand for tables and other equipment was initially met in Europe by John Thurston and other furniture makers of the era. The early balls were made from wood and clay, but the rich preferred to use ivory.\n\nEarly billiard games involved various pieces of additional equipment, including the \"arch\" (related to the croquet hoop), \"port\" (a different hoop) and \"king\" (a pin or skittle near the arch) in the 1770s, but other game variants, relying on the cushions (and eventually on pockets cut into them), were being formed that would go on to play fundamental roles in the development of modern billiards.\nThe early croquet-like games eventually led to the development of the carom or carambole billiards category – what most non-Commonwealth and non-US speakers mean by the word \"billiards\". These games, which once completely dominated the cue sports world but have declined markedly in many areas over the last few generations, are games played with three or sometimes four balls, on a table without holes (and without obstructions or targets in most cases), in which the goal is generally to strike one with a , then have the cue ball rebound off of one or more of the cushions and strike a second object ball. Variations include three-cushion, straight rail and the balkline variants, cushion caroms, five-pins, and four-ball, among others.\n\nOver time, a type of obstacle returned, originally as a hazard and later as a target, in the form of pockets, or holes partly cut into the table bed and partly into the cushions, leading to the rise of pocket billiards, including \"pool\" games such as eight-ball, nine-ball, straight pool and one-pocket; Russian pyramid; snooker; English billiards and others.\n\nIn the United States pool and billiards had died out for a bit, but between 1878 and 1956 pool and billiards became very popular. Players in annual championships began to receive their own cigarette cards. This was mainly due to the fact that it was a popular pastime for troops to take their minds off from battle. However, by the end of World War II pool and billiards began to die down once again. It was not until 1961 when the film \"The Hustler\" came out that sparked a new interest in the game. Now the game is generally a well-known game and has many players of all different skill levels.\n\nThe games with regulated international professional competition, if not others, have been referred to as \"sports\" or \"sporting\" events, not simply \"games\", since 1893 at the latest. Quite a variety of particular games (i.e., sets of rules and equipment) are the subject of present-day competition, including many of those already mentioned, with competition being especially broad in nine-ball, snooker, three-cushion and eight-ball.\n\nSnooker, though technically a pocket billiards variant and closely related in its equipment and origin to the game of English billiards, is a professional sport organized at the international level, and its rules bear little resemblance to those of modern pool, pyramid and other such games.\n\nA \"Billiards\" category encompassing pool, snooker and carom was featured in the 2005 World Games, held in Duisburg, Germany, and the 2006 Asian Games also saw the introduction of a \"Cue sports\" category.\n\nBilliard balls vary from game to game, in size, design and quantity.\n\nRussian pyramid and kaisa have a size of 68 mm ( in). In Russian pyramid there are sixteen balls, as in pool, but fifteen are white and numbered, and the is usually red. In kaisa, five balls are used: the yellow (called the \"kaisa\" in Finnish), two red object balls, and the two white cue balls (usually differentiated by one cue ball having a dot or other marking on it and each of which serves as an object ball for the opponent).\n\nCarom billiards balls are larger than pool balls, having a diameter of 61.5 mm ( in), and come as a set of two cue balls (one colored or marked) and an object ball (or two object balls in the case of the game four-ball).\n\nAmerican-style pool balls are 57 mm ( in), are used in many pool games found throughout the world, come in sets of two of object balls, seven and seven , an and a ; the balls are racked differently for different games (some of which do not use the entire ball set). Blackball (English-style eight-ball) sets are similar, but have unmarked of (or ) and balls instead of solids and stripes, and at 56 mm ( in) are smaller than the American-style; they are used principally in Britain, Ireland, and some Commonwealth countries, though not exclusively, since they are unsuited for playing nine-ball.\n\nSnooker balls are smaller than American-style pool balls with a diameter of 52.5 mm ( in), and come in sets of 22 (15 reds, 6 \"\", and a cue ball). English billiard balls are the same size as snooker balls and come in sets of three balls (two cue balls and a red, an object ball). Other games, such as bumper pool, have custom ball sets.\n\nBilliard balls have been made from many different materials since the start of the game, including clay, bakelite, celluloid, crystallite, ivory, plastic, steel and wood. The dominant material from 1627 until the early 20th century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred on by a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was celluloid, invented by John Wesley Hyatt in 1868, but the material was volatile, sometimes exploding during manufacture and was highly flammable.\n\nThere are many sizes and styles of pool and billiard tables. Generally, tables are rectangles twice as long as they are wide. Most pool tables are known as 7-, 8-, or 9-footers, referring to the length of the table's long side. Full-size snooker and English billiard tables are long on the longest side. Pool halls tend to have tables and cater to the serious pool player. Pubs will typically use tables which are often coin-operated. Formerly, tables were common, but such tables are now considered antique collectors items; a few, usually from the late 19th century, can be found in pool halls from time to time. Ten-foot tables remain the standard size for carom billiard games. The slates on modern carom tables are usually heated to stave off moisture and provide a consistent playing surface.\n\nThe length of the pool table will typically be a function of space, with many homeowners purchasing an table as a compromise. Full-size pool tables are 4.5 by (interior dimensions). High-quality tables have a made of thick slate, in three pieces to prevent warping and changes due to temperature and humidity. Smaller bar tables are most commonly made with a single piece of slate. Pocket billiards tables of all types normally have six pockets, three on each side (four corner pockets, and two side or middle pockets).\n\nAll types of tables are covered with billiard cloth (often called \"felt\", but actually a woven wool or wool/nylon blend called baize). Cloth has been used to cover billiards tables since the 15th century.\n\nBar or tavern tables, which get a lot of play, use \"slower\", more durable cloth. The cloth used in upscale pool (and snooker) halls and home billiard rooms is \"faster\" (i.e., provides less friction, allowing the balls to roll farther across the table ), and competition-quality pool cloth is made from 100% worsted wool. Snooker cloth traditionally has a nap (consistent fiber directionality) and balls behave differently when rolling against versus along with the nap.\n\nThe cloth of the billiard table has traditionally been green, reflecting its origin (originally the grass of ancestral lawn games), and has been so colored since the 16th century, but it is also produced in other colors such as red and blue.\n\nThe cloth was earlier said to be the most important part of the game, most likely because of the reflection of the game's origin. The players were determined that the cloth should not be ripped – women were made to continue to use maces after cues were invented, for fear that they would rip the cloth with the sharper cues.\n\nA rack is the name given to a frame (usually wood, plastic or aluminium) used to organize billiard balls at the beginning of a game. This is traditionally triangular in shape, but varies with the type of billiards played. There are two main types of racks; the more common triangular shape which is used for eight-ball and straight pool and the diamond-shaped rack used for nine-ball.\n\nThere are several other types of less common rack types that are also used, based on a \"template\" to hold the billiard balls tightly together. Most commonly it is a thin plastic sheet with diamond-shaped cut-outs that hold the balls that is placed on the table with the balls set on top of the rack. The rack is used to set up the \"break\" and removed before the \"break shot\" occurs.\n\nBilliards games are mostly played with a stick known as a cue. A cue is usually either a one piece tapered stick or a two piece stick divided in the middle by a joint of metal or phenolic resin. High quality cues are generally two pieces and are made of a hardwood, generally maple for billiards and ash for snooker.\n\nThe end of the cue is of larger circumference and is intended to be gripped by a player's hand. The of the cue is of smaller circumference, usually tapering to an terminus called a (usually made of fiberglass or brass in better cues), where a rounded leather is affixed, flush with the ferrule, to make final contact with balls. The tip, in conjunction with chalk, can be used to impart spin to the cue ball when it is not hit in its center.\n\nCheap cues are generally made of pine, low-grade maple (and formerly often of ramin, which is now endangered), or other low-quality wood, with inferior plastic ferrules. A quality cue can be expensive and may be made of exotic woods and other expensive materials which are artfully inlaid in decorative patterns. Many modern cues are also made, like golf clubs, with high-tech materials such as woven graphite. Skilled players may use more than one cue during a game, including a separate generally lighter cue for the opening break shot (because of cue speed gained from a lighter stick) and another, shorter cue with a special tip for .\n\nThe mechanical bridge, sometimes called a \"rake\", \"crutch\", \"bridge stick\" or simply \"bridge\", and in the UK a \"rest\", is used to extend a player's reach on a shot where the cue ball is too far away for normal hand bridging. It consists of a stick with a grooved metal or plastic head which the cue slides on. Many amateurs refuse to use the mechanical bridge based on the perception that to do so is unmanly. However, many aficionados and most professionals employ the bridge whenever the intended shot so requires.\n\nSome players, especially current or former snooker players, use a screw-on cue butt extension instead of or in addition to the mechanical bridge.\n\nBridge head design is varied, and not all designs (especially those with cue shaft-enclosing rings, or wheels on the bottom of the head), are broadly tournament-approved.\n\nIn Italy a longer, thicker cue is typically available for this kind of tricky shot.\n\nFor snooker they are normally available in three forms, their use depending on how the player is hampered; the standard rest is a simple cross, the 'spider' has a raised arch around 12 cm with three grooves to rest the cue in and for the most awkward of shots, the 'giraffe' (or 'swan' in England) which has a raised arch much like the 'spider' but with a slender arm reaching out around 15 cm with the groove.\n\nChalk is applied to the tip of the cue stick, ideally before every shot, to increase the tip's friction coefficient so that when it impacts the cue ball on a non-center hit, no (unintentional slippage between the cue tip and the struck ball) occurs. Cue tip chalk is not actually the substance typically referred to as \"chalk\" (generally calcium carbonate), but any of several proprietary compounds, with a silicate base. It was around the time of the Industrial Revolution that newer compounds formed that provided better grip for the ball. This is when the English began to experiment with side spin or applying curl to the ball. This was shortly introduced to the American players and is how the term \"putting English on the ball\" came to be. \"Chalk\" may also refer to a cone of fine, white ; like talc (talcum powder) it can be used to reduce friction between the cue and bridge hand during shooting, for a smoother stroke. Some brands of hand chalk actually are made of compressed talc. (Tip chalk is not used for this purpose because it is abrasive, hand-staining and difficult to apply.) Many players prefer a slick pool glove over hand chalk or talc because of the messiness of these powders; buildup of particles on the cloth will affect ball behavior and necessitate more-frequent cloth cleaning.\n\nCue tip chalk (invented in its modern form by straight rail billiard pro William A. Spinks and chemist William Hoskins in 1897) is made by crushing silica and the abrasive substance corundum or aloxite (aluminium oxide), into a powder. It is combined with dye (originally and most commonly green or blue-green, like traditional billiard cloth, but available today, like the cloth, in many colours) and a binder (glue). Each manufacturer's brand has different qualities, which can significantly affect play. High humidity can also impair the effectiveness of chalk. Harder, drier compounds are generally considered superior by most players.\n\nThere are two main varieties of billiard games: carom and pocket.\n\nThe main carom billiards games are straight rail, balkline and especially three cushion billiards. All are played on a pocketless table with three balls; two cue balls and one object ball. In all, players shoot a cue ball so that it makes contact with the opponent's cue ball as well as the object ball. Others of multinational interest are four-ball and five-pins.\n\nThe most globally popular of the large variety of pocket games are Pool and snooker. A third, English billiards, has some features of carom billiards. English billiards used to be one of the two most-competitive cue sports along with the carom game balkline, at the turn of the 20th century and is still enjoyed today in Commonwealth countries. Another pocket game, Russian pyramid and its variants like kaisa are popular in the former Eastern bloc.\n\nIn straight rail, a player scores a point and may continue shooting each time his cue ball makes contact with both other balls.\n\nAlthough a difficult and subtle game, some of the best players of straight billiards developed the skill to the balls in a corner or along the same rail for the purpose of playing a series of to score a seemingly limitless number of points.\n\nThe first straight rail professional tournament was held in 1879 where Jacob Schaefer, Sr. scored 690 points in a single turn (that is, 690 separate strokes without a miss). With the balls repetitively hit and barely moving in endless \"nursing\", there was little for the fans to watch.\n\nIn light of these phenomenal skill developments in straight rail, the game of balkline soon developed to make it impossible for a player to keep the balls gathered in one part of the table for long, greatly limiting the effectiveness of nurse shots. A (not to be confused with , which pertains to the game of English billiards) is a line parallel to one end of a billiards table. In the \"games\" of balkline – 18.1 and 18.2 (pronounced \"eighteen-point-two\") balkline, among other more obscure variations – the players have to drive at least one object ball past a balkline set at from each rail, after one or two points have been scored, respectively.\n\nA more elegant solution was three-cushion billiards, which requires a player to make contact with the other two balls on the table \"and\" contact three rail cushions in the process. This is difficult enough that even the best players can only manage to average one to two points per turn.\nThis is sometimes described as \"hardest to learn\" and \"require most skill\" of all billiards. Even quite good Pool or Snooker players may attempt an hour or more to score a single three cushion point, without even managing an accidental score.\n\nThere are many variations of games played on a standard pool table. Popular pool games include eight-ball, nine-ball, straight pool and one-pocket. Even within games types (e.g. eight-ball), there may be variations, and people may play recreationally using relaxed or local rules. A few of the more popular examples of pool games are given below.\n\nIn eight-ball and nine-ball, the object is to sink object balls until one can legally pocket the winning eponymous \". Well-known but waning in popularity is straight pool, in which players seek to continue sinking balls, rack after rack if they can, to reach a pre-determined winning score (typically 150). Related to nine-ball, another well-known game is rotation, where the lowest-numbered object ball on the table must be struck first, although any object ball may be pocketed (i.e., combination shot). Each pocketed ball is worth its number, and the player with the highest score at the end of the rack is the winner. Since there are only 120 points available (1 + 2 + 3 ⋯ + 15 = 120), scoring 61 points leaves no opportunity for the opponent to catch up. In both one-pocket and bank pool, the players must sink a set number of balls; respectively, all in a particular , or all by . In snooker, players score points by alternately potting and various special \".\n\n\nSpeed pool is a standard billiards game where the balls must be pocketed in as little time as possible. Rules vary greatly from tournament to tournament. The International Speed Pool Challenge has been held annually since 2006.\n\nDating to approximately 1800, English billiards, called simply billiards in many former British colonies and in the UK where it originated, was originally called the \"winning and losing carambole game\", folding in the names of three predecessor games, \"the winning game\", \"the losing game\" and \"the carambole game\" (an early form of straight rail), that combined to form it. The game features both (caroms) and the pocketing of balls as objects of play. English billiards requires two and a red . The object of the game is to score either a fixed number of points, or score the most points within a set time frame, determined at the start of the game.\n\nPoints are awarded for:\n\nSnooker is a pocket billiards game originated by British officers stationed in India during the 19th century, based on earlier pool games such as black pool and life pool. The name of the game became generalized to also describe one of its prime strategies: to \" the opposing player by causing that player to foul or leave an opening to be exploited.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, snooker is by far the most popular cue sport at the competitive level, and major national pastime along with association football and cricket. It is played in many Commonwealth countries as well, especially in Asia. Snooker is uncommon in North America, where pool games such as eight-ball and nine-ball dominate, and Latin America and Continental Europe, where carom games dominate. The first World Snooker Championship was held in 1927, and it has been held annually since then with few exceptions. The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) was established in 1968 to regulate the professional game, while the International Billiards and Snooker Federation (IBSF) regulates the amateur games.\n\nTechnically a form of pocket billiards, snooker has its own worldwide sporting community separate from that of pool.\n\nThese combine aspects of carom and pocket billiards, and are played on tables with pockets (often as s not targets).\n\nThese are variations using small disks instead of balls, and light-weight cue sticks.\n\n\n\n"}

The first public broadcasting was a short performance by František Filipovský on 1 May 1953. In 1955 was held the first live broadcast (a hockey match). \n\nLike all other media in the Communist Czechoslovakia, the station was subject to heavy censorship.

It was produced by Blue Sky Studios, written by William Joyce, James V. Hart, Daniel Shere, Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember and directed by Chris Wedge, the director of \"Ice Age\" (2002) and \"Robots\" (2005). The film stars the voices of Colin Farrell, Josh Hutcherson, Amanda Seyfried, Christoph Waltz, Aziz Ansari, Chris O'Dowd, Pitbull, Jason Sudeikis, Steven Tyler, and Beyoncé Knowles. The film was released on May 24, 2013, by 20th Century Fox. \"Epic\" received mixed reviews from critics and earned $268 million on a $93 million budget.\n\n17 year old Mary Katherine, or M.K., moves in with her eccentric scientist father Professor Bomba, who has been searching for tiny humanoid soldiers called Leafmen. They protect the forest that Bomba lives near from wicked creatures called Boggans and their malevolent leader Mandrake. An independent young soldier named Nod decides to quit, much to the ire of the no-nonsense Leafmen leader Ronin.\n\nThe queen of the forest, Queen Tara, must choose an heir to her throne and goes out to a field of leaf pods, guarded by a laid-back slug named Mub and a wannabe Leafman snail named Grub. Immediately after she chooses a pod, the Boggans attack. Tara flees the area with the pod, and though her bodyguards do their best to protect her, they are soon overwhelmed by the sheer number of Boggans. Eventually, Ronin arrives for her and the pair fly off on his hummingbird mount. They are then attacked by Mandrake and his son Dagda. Dagda is killed by Ronin, but the former shoots Tara beforehand.\n\nMeanwhile, M.K. decides to leave after having an argument with Bomba about his research. Before she can leave, Bomba's dog Ozzy runs into the woods. While looking for Ozzy, M.K. sees Tara falling. Dying, Tara gives her the pod and uses her magic to shrink her. She tells M.K. to take the pod to a Glowworm named Nim Galuu before she dies, and M.K. joins Ronin and the Leafmen, along with Mub and Grub. Ronin discovers that Nod has entered a race against other creatures and bugs on birds. Nod goes back on a deal with a tough toad named Bufo to throw the race. Before Bufo and his two henchmen can feed Nod to a snake, Ronin intervenes and orders them to leave. A reluctant Nod joins him, M.K., Mub, and Grub after hearing about Queen Tara's death, which Bufo overhears.\n\nRonin, Nod, M.K., Mub, and Grub eventually track Nim Galuu down. He then leads them down to the scroll library, where M.K. discovers Tara's brief message before shrinking her, and a message that will get her back to normal size. When Ronin leaves, Nod takes M.K. on a deer ride and they begin to fall in love. Meanwhile, Mandrake has had the Boggans bring Bufo to him, finding out the location of the pod. Mandrake goes to Nim Galuu's place to steal the pod, which, if it blooms in darkness, will help Mandrake destroy the forest. He takes the pod and kidnaps Mub and Grub. Ronin scolds Nod for not being there to protect the pod. To get into Boggan territory undiscovered, M.K., Nod, and Ronin set out to Bomba's house to get some disguises, where M.K. learns that the Leafmen have deliberately been leading Bomba off their trail. Bomba sees that he has visitors and captures M.K., fainting when he sees her. M.K. marks the location of Moonhaven on a map Bomba has made of the forest before rejoining Nod and Ronin.\n\nWhen they reach the Boggan land Ronin distracts the Boggans while M.K. and Nod rescue Mub, Grub, and the pod. Mandrake discovers them and orders the Boggans to stop them. M.K., Nod, Mub, and Grub escape alive, but Ronin sacrifices himself to ensure their escape. Before the full moon can sprout the pod at Moonhaven, Mandrake's bats block the light, causing the pod to begin sprouting in darkness. The Leafmen set out to fight the Boggans; M.K. tries to get help from her father by visiting his various cameras he had set in the forest. However, upon regaining consciousness, Bomba believes that he didn't really see M.K. and that he has been insane all these years, and shuts down all his cameras. He changes his mind when he sees the red push-pin that M.K. had put on his map.\n\nBomba is overjoyed to see that he has been right and he follows M.K. to Moonhaven. M.K. uses Bomba's iPod to make bat sounds, luring Mandrake's bats away. Meanwhile, Mub and Nim Galuu try to stop Mandrake from reaching the pod, but are unsuccessful. Just then, Ronin appears, bearing scars and bruises from the Boggans. Mandrake manages to outdo him, but is defended by Nod, who finally realizes the importance of teamwork. Before Mandrake can obtain his victory, the pod blooms in moonlight, defeating the Boggans, and sealing Mandrake into the burl of a nearby tree.\n\nThe chosen heir is the flower child who helped save Tara earlier in the film. Grub becomes a Leafman, Nod and Ronin reconcile, and Nod and M.K. kiss before M.K. is returned to her original size. After reuniting with Bomba and becoming his assistant, the human family still keeps regular contact with their small friends as they continue the research of their world.\n\n\nIn 2006, it was reported that Chris Wedge would be directing an animated feature film based on William Joyce's book, \"The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs\" for Fox Animation. Joyce, who had already collaborated with Wedge as a designer and producer on the 2005 film \"Robots\", was set to produce the film. At one point, Wedge got permission to find a new home for the film and turned to Pixar, led by John Lasseter, a close friend that Wedge knew from working on \"Tron\". When Pixar tried to close the rights for the film and start development, Fox changed their mind, and the film returned to Fox. The film was officially greenlit in 2009, under the title \"Leaf Men\". In May 2012, Fox announced the final title for the film (\"Epic\"), its first cast details, and a plot. According to Wedge, he was not satisfied with the renaming, which was decided by the marketing department. He also expressed dissatisfaction with subtitles given to the film in some non-English countries, including the French subtitle, \"The Battle of the Secret Kingdom\".\n\nAlthough the film is based on and borrows many characters from Joyce's book, its plot has been significantly changed. Wedge explained: \"[W]hile Bill wrote a wonderful book, it is a quaint story. We wanted to make a gigantic action-adventure movie.\" To address online speculations about whether the film is similar to other films, like \"\" or \"Avatar\", Wedge said: \"I hate to associate it with other movies. It is adventure on the scale of \"Star Wars\". And it does immerse the audience completely in a world like \"Avatar\". But it has its own personality.\"\n\nThe film was released publicly on May 16, 2013, in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Germany, Peru, Puerto Rico, and Switzerland. The film was released in the United States on May 24, 2013.\n\nProduced on a budget of $93 million, \"Epic\" grossed $107,518,682 in North America, and $160,907,952 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $268,426,634. In North America, the film earned $9.3 million on its opening day, and opened to number four in its first weekend, with $33,531,068, behind \"Fast & Furious 6\", \"The Hangover Part III\", and \"Star Trek Into Darkness\". In its second weekend, the film dropped to number five, grossing an additional $16,616,310. In its third weekend, the film stayed at number five, grossing $11,876,003. In its fourth weekend, the film dropped to number seven, grossing $6,284,905. While the film was overshadowed by other animated films that summer including \"Monsters University\" and \"Despicable Me 2\", the film finished in third out of six family films that summer, and became a moderate box office success.\n\n\"Epic\" received mixed reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 64% based on 119 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Though its narrative themes are all too familiar, \"Epic\" is beautifully animated and crafted with just enough flair to make for solid family entertainment.\" Another review aggregation website, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 52 out of 100 based on 30 reviews. Audiences polled by the market research firm CinemaScore gave \"Epic\" an \"A\" grade on average and an \"A+\" among kids.\n\nStephan Lee of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a B+, saying \"The story lacks the specialness of a Pixar movie—it retreads the same eco-battle archetypes as \"\" and \"Avatar—\"but it's a perfectly appealing explosion of color for a lazy summer day.\" Michael Rechtshaffen of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" gave the film a mixed review, saying \"Where the animated film comes up short is on the inspiration front—despite the intriguing terrain, its stock inhabitants lack the sort of unique personality traits that would prevent them from feeling overly familiar.\" Michael Phillips of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film two stars, saying \"It's difficult to keep its story and characters, or even its visual design, in your mind's eye, in part because the five credited screenwriters overload the narrative with incident and threatening complication.\" Kyle Smith of the \"New York Post\" gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four, saying \"It’s not that the plot of \"Epic\" is complex; it’s just untidy. There’s a lot going on that goes nowhere.\" Moira Macdonald of \"The Seattle Times\" gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, saying \"The story's simple enough to appeal to young kids (the 8-year-old with me pronounced the movie \"awesome\"), but adults will enjoy the beautiful animation, whether 3D or 2D.\" Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of five, saying \"As beautiful as it is, \"Epic\" is fatally lacking in visceral momentum and dramatic edge.\"\n\n\"Epic\" was released on DVD, Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D on August 20, 2013.\n\nDanny Elfman composed the original music for the film, which was released on May 28, 2013 by Sony Classics. Beyoncé performed and co-wrote with Sia an original song, titled \"Rise Up.\" The song was released as a digital single and as part of the digital version of the soundtrack. This is the first time that a film produced by Blue Sky Studios has not been scored by John Powell since the first \"Ice Age\" installment, which was composed by David Newman.\n"}
{"id": "34315325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34315325", "title": "Euro Truck Simulator 2", "text": "Euro Truck Simulator 2\n\nEuro Truck Simulator 2 (commonly abbreviated as ETS2) is a vehicle simulation game developed and published by SCS Software for Microsoft Windows, Linux and macOS and was initially released as open development on 19 October 2012. The game is a direct sequel to the 2008 game \"Euro Truck Simulator\" and it is the second video game in the \"Truck Simulator\" series. The player can drive one of a choice of articulated trucks across a depiction of Europe, picking up cargo from various locations and delivering it. As the game progresses, it is possible for the player to buy more vehicles, depots, and hire other drivers to work for them.\n\nThe game has sold over 5 million units on Steam as of November 2018, according to the metrics website Steam Spy.\n\nPlayers choose their HQ's location in any of the game map's cities. At first, the player can only take what are known as Quick jobs—these jobs involve making hired driver deliveries while employed by a delivery company, with a provided truck and all expenses (fuel, road tolls, ferry crossings) covered. As the player earns money or takes bank loans, they can eventually afford to buy themselves a truck, acquire a home garage, and start making more money by delivering cargo using their own truck instead of just being a driver for hire. Money earned in the game can be spent on upgrading or purchasing new trucks, hiring NPC drivers to take on deliveries, buying more garages and expanding the home garage to accommodate more trucks and drivers. The skills of the drivers hired by the player also grow with experience and the player can create a huge fleet of the trucks and drivers expanding the business across Europe. \n\nAs players progress and earn money, they are also to purchase their own trailers, which can be fully customized in the same way as trucks. Player-owned trailers can be used to receive and deliver cargo at existing storage locations. Like trucks, trailers can also be allocated to company employees, resulting in higher income. \n\nThe player gains experience points after each delivery. A skill point is awarded after each level-up. Skill points can be used to unlock deliveries that require different ADR classes, longer distance deliveries, special cargo loads, fragile cargo loads, deliveries that are urgent and eco-driving. This progression allows the player to take on better paid jobs.\n\nThe base game features 71 cities in twelve different countries, over twenty different types of cargo and over fifteen fictional European companies. There are four map DLCs that expand the game to more countries and locations, and multiple other truck and trailer DLCs.\n\nThe game also features a \"Radio\" feature, which allows players to play MP3 and OGG files. It also allows the player to listen to Internet radio.\n\nThe game includes two new truck companies, Scania and Renault, with MAN returning from the original game. DAF, Iveco, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo trucks were not officially licensed and had their names changed to DAV, Ivedo, Majestic and Valiant respectively. Later updates included the official branding for the DAF XF, Volvo FH, Iveco Stralis and Mercedes-Benz Actros.\n\nInitially released for Windows and available for purchase & download via SCS's own website, the game would eventually be added to Steam in January 2013. Expanding beyond the Windows version, SCS announced in March 2013 that they were developing a Mac version of the game. One month later they released a Linux beta version of the game to the public through Steam. On 27 February, they stated \"the Mac OS port of ETS2 is taking longer than anybody would like, but trust us, we are still working hard on it.\" Finally, on 19 December 2014, they announced on their blog that the OS X version of the game is ready for a public beta available on Steam. On 21 January 2015 a 64-bit version of Euro Truck Simulator 2 was released, which allows for more memory to be used by the game.\n\nIn July 2013 a large update was released, fixing various graphical glitches, improving the toll booths and included the ability to switch off the trucks' speed limiter from within the gameplay options.\n\nIn October 2013, SCS announced support for the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset which became available in the beta 1.9 update released in March 2014.\n\nIn May 2014, \"ETS 2\" was updated out of beta with patch 1.10. In July 2014, \"ETS 2\" released an open beta of patch 1.11 on Steam. The full patch contains 3 new cities in Austria and Italy, along with an improved layout and UI, a way to adjust your seating in the cabin, and a feature that allows you to sell/trade your garages. In January 2015, \"ETS 2\" was updated with support for 64 bit, and officially released for OS X. On 8 September 2015, SCS Blog announced the completion of 5 years of their blog as well as the upcoming feature in v1.21 (Cabin Accessories DLC).\n\nEuro Truck Simulator 2 offers several DLC base map expansion packs. Below is a list of major expansion packs provided by the developers.\n\nA set of Halloween-themed paint jobs was released exclusively on Valve's Steam store on 24 October 2013. On 10 December 2013, a set of winter themed paint jobs called \"Ice Cold\" were released. These themes can be applied to any truck in the game. On 4 April 2014, SCS Software released six more paint jobs in a DLC pack called \"Force of Nature\" and all paint jobs are still Steam DLC only. The \"Going East!\" DLC however, is both Steam and Non-Steam DLC. Finally, in the 1.10/1.11 update there are 5 new paint schemes with the UK flag, the Irish flag, the Scottish flag, the American flag and the Canadian flag. On 3 October 2014, SCS Software released some colorschemes based on the German flag, prior to the 24th anniversary of the reunion of Germany.\nDuring December 2014 and January 2015 on World of Trucks only, there was an exclusive paint skin that many players still have y called the Ravens Paint Pack. It included only two Raven style paints (1 blue, 1 gold), and was only unlocked if you delivered Christmas trailers the approximate distance from Praha, Czech Republic to the Geographic North Pole which in the end came down to 2,760 miles (4,443 km). The Ravens Paint Pack DLC was originally not available for purchase; however on 6 March 2017 SCS Software released it as a paid-DLC, with some additional content, through Steam for US$1.99.\n\n\"High Power Cargo Pack\" DLC expands the cargo range in the game by adding custom cargoes. The new cargoes are usually large, long and heavy and include a helicopter, various tractors and drillers, air conditioners and even a yacht. An extra bonus included with the pack is a special Heavy Duty customizable paint job.\n\nOn 16 September 2016 SCS released the first officially licensed trailer pack for the game. The \"Schwarzmüller Trailer Pack\" add five new and original modeled Semi-Trailers of the Austrian-based semi-trailer conductor into the game.\n\nThe \"Cabin Accessories\" DLC adds various items to customize the cabin of your truck, such as banners, pennants, bobbleheads, a portable navigator and even fuzzy dice which will respond to the cabin's movements. It was released on 30 September 2015.\n\nIn the 1.23 beta, SCS Software integrated Valve's Steam Workshop into the game, allowing mod authors to upload their creations onto the Euro Truck Simulator 2 Steam Workshop page. This lets players subscribe to a mod and Steam will download and install it to their game. These mods range from trailers and companies to new trucks and sound packs. Mod authors use a tool named SCS Workshop Uploader to get their mods published on the \"Workshop Page\".\n\nOn 12 May 2017, SCS released the \"Heavy Cargo Pack\" DLC which added eight new cargo types. Each cargo is large and very heavy in weight, and is transported on a special trailer with steerable rear axles.\n\nThe Special Transport DLC was released on 13 December 2017, consisting of even heavier cargoes that exceed regular cargo regulations, with escort vehicles that will help guide the player deliver cargo at short distances. Unlike regular and heavy cargoes, the player cannot make stops at rest areas, gas stations or deviate away from escort vehicles.\n\nReleased on 18 September 2018, the \"Krone Trailer Pack\" is the second licensed trailer pack to be added (only after the Schwarzmüller Trailer Pack), the DLC currently adds 6 new trailers and various accessories.\n\nThe game was generally well received by critics, holding a score of 79/100 on Metacritic, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nIn a review for \"Destructoid\", Jim Sterling praised the game's accessibility, noting how easy the GPS and map features were to use, as well as the option to stream European internet radio, and the multitude of control options available. He also praised the graphics, stating that \"[f]rom the shape of the traffic lights to the atmosphere of the backdrops, there's a sense of individuality to each new territory you uncover, and the trucks themselves are lovingly recreated with an intricate level of detail\", although he did criticise the AI of the other vehicles on the road. In a similarly favourable review, Tim Stone of \"PC Gamer\" called it \"unexpectedly engrossing\", praising the size of the map and the variation of the roads and scenery available. He did however have reservations about the accuracy of the surroundings, commenting \"no one seems to have told SCS’s countryside crafters that rural Britain features long green things called hedges. Cities are often depicted with the shortest of visual shorthand – a few warehouses, the odd landmark if you’re lucky.\"\n\n\"PC Gamer\" awarded the game \"Sim of the Year 2012\" in its end-of-year awards. \"Rock, Paper, Shotgun\" listed \"Euro Truck Simulator 2\" ninth on their list of \"The 25 Best Simulation Games Ever Made\".\n\nUsers of the Steam distribution platform voted Euro Truck Simulator 2 to win \"I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award\" and the \"Sit Back and Relax\"-award in Steam Awards 2016.\n\n"}

{"id": "7798768", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7798768", "title": "Internet band", "text": "Internet band\n\nAn Internet band, also called an online band, is a musical group whose members collaborate online through broadband by utilizing a content management system and local digital audio workstations. The work is sometimes released under a Creative Commons license, so musicians can share their \"samples\" to create collaborative musical expressions for noncommercial purposes without ever meeting face to face.\n\nIn March 1996, Nora Farrell and William Duckworth began to develop Cathedral, one of the first interactive works of music and art on the World Wide Web. Their aim was to create an interactive website with web-based musical instruments that anyone could play. Also in the preliminary stages of the system, they determined that they wanted to make a place on the Web for acoustic music through a series of live webcasts and performances online.\n\nIn June 1997, Cathedral went live online. The first build of this system included streaming audio, streaming video, animation, images, and text. At the time, there were fewer than one million sites on the World Wide Web and fewer than 2% of those made any sounds.\n\nAccording to the creators of Cathedral, their goals at that point were:\nBy 2003, Cathedral consisted of three primary components:\n\nSocial networking sites have gained a large number of users because many aspects of society revolve around computers and the Internet. The music industry itself has undergone this change as well. People are using iTunes, YouTube and MySpace Music to share the music and communicate with others. Adaptively, artists and record labels can utilize Web sites and file sharing sites to spread their music. Musicians who use the Internet can also form bands online.\n\nInternet bands became popular in the early 2000s when music technology, file sharing and collaboration software became more prevalent on the Internet. While the extent of collaboration between bands may vary, an Internet band identifies as a band whose members collaborate on music projects via the Internet.\n\nA growing number of websites offer people the opportunity to compose music online. They marry social networking with music mixing and uploading technology. Users decide what projects they wish to add their special touches to and how actively they want to get involved.\n\nThe advantages of joining an online band include the ability to collaborate with musicians, vocalists, audio engineers, etc. who reside in any part of the world with Internet access. Also, since many online bands do not perform or record in \"real-time\", it allows members to record their track (their part of a collaboration) at their leisure.\n\nIn addition to setting a platform to creatively collaborate with other musicians, online music collaboration gives opportunities to educators and students that were not possible before its conception. This platform provides an alternative to the traditional 1:1 music lesson, but its effectiveness on a higher scale is questionable.\n\nResearch conducted in 2007 at Boston University led by musicologist and comparative educationist David G. Hebert provided five key challenges for online music education programs:\nTo address these challenges, Hebert pointed out the importance of expert mentors, outstanding research theses completed online, a strong record of graduate job placement from online programs, detailed planning between instructors and music departments, and the implementation of assessment moderation systems.\n\nOnline music collaboration is an Internet-based system designed to help coordinate online music projects. Most platforms provide a virtual space to upload recorded music files, a community forum where members can offer feedback or make alterations to the uploaded music.\n\nEach musician usually needs to record to a click track or metronome and upload the instrument or vocals for the song independently. Then a designated Internet music producer can edit for timing and tightness between all tracks, arrange, optimize and mix all instruments together and do a final mastering process to get a complete song out of single tracks.\n\nInternet-based music collaboration can be done by individuals who never form one permanent band. The Playing for Change Foundation is a musical charity that releases music recorded by musicians from all around the globe, only some of whom have gone on to play together live. Even more decentralized collaboration happens between YouTube users; one \"Cracked\" columnist praised the cover of the \"Game of Thrones\" theme performed by violinist Jason Yang and guitarist and sound engineer Roger Lima and directed by Paolo Dy.\n\nInternet bands develop online and base the foundations their work within various communities. The systems below are examples of communities which support the formation and maintenance of online bands:\n\n\n"}

Schulz. It originally aired on April 28, 1981. The special was later released on DVD on September 2, 2008 as a bonus feature on Warner Home Video's remastered deluxe DVD of \"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\".\n\nCharlie Brown decides that Snoopy needs to educate himself, and gives him his library card to check out a few books. Snoopy decides to take out one book, a book about magic, which after reading, influences him to hold a Vaudeville show (under the stage name \"The Great Houndini\"). During the opening, Snoopy practices magic with Woodstock by his side. Charlie Brown warns both of them that the cat next door will get upset if he and Woodstock get really loud. However, Snoopy and Woodstock continue to perform more magic tricks and the cat next door angrily rips Snoopy's doghouse apart.\n\nHe recruits Marcie as one assistant and announcer, and Sally as his silent assistant. In the show, he pulls a rabbit out of his hat (actually Woodstock with rabbit ears), then does a ring trick that goes wrong. Both of these tricks raise the ire of one heckler who demands their money back and does not see the humor the others see, but Snoopy quickly shuts him up both times. He also does the \"stick-in-the-hole\" trick to Franklin, the \"amputation-decapitation\" trick to Peppermint Patty, cutting Linus's trademark security blanket into strips (which appears to fail), the levitation trick to Lucy van Pelt, and biggest of all, making Charlie Brown literally disappear.\n\nA sudden rainstorm ends the show early, and Charlie Brown is left invisible. Convinced he is going to remain that way for the rest of his life, he prepares to roam the world as a lost soul, and Sally begins moving her stuff into his room. Before Charlie starts roaming, he decides to feed Snoopy to show him what has happened. When Snoopy realizes he cannot yet reverse the trick, he tries a couple of different ideas to make Charlie Brown somewhat visible again, including draping a sheet over his head and scaring Sally, and when Charlie Brown looks in the mirror and sees that Snoopy made him a ghost, he faints. Despite this shortcoming, Charlie Brown realizes he has a golden opportunity to kick Lucy's infamous football without her usual prank of pulling it away at the last second. Taking advantage of his invisibility, Charlie Brown finally kicks the ball out of a bewildered Lucy's hand and then taunts her about it.\n\nFurious over Charlie Brown succeeding in kicking the ball, Lucy gets the magic book back to give to Snoopy, threatening that if he doesn't make Charlie Brown visible again, she'll pound him. After starting out by entering his doghouse lab and working with chemicals so volatile, they explode and start a chain reaction of explosions that chase him out of the house, Snoopy continues to study the book, and tests a number of counterspells on Woodstock (making his feet bigger, then head bigger, then making him disappear, but successfully reversing each spell), he goes about casting his counterspell in all directions, unsure just where Charlie Brown is. As Snoopy wanders into a vicinity where Lucy is setting up another place-kick, Charlie Brown happens to run by where Snoopy is practicing. Just as he is about to kick the ball again, Snoopy casts the counterspell in Charlie Brown's direction, causing him to unknowingly become visible again. Lucy witnesses his reappearance and pulls the ball away for the eleventh time as Charlie Brown winds up to kick it, then promptly falls on his back.\n\nHowever, Charlie Brown fails to display embarrassment and says that he finally kicked the ball, though Lucy considers this a false statement, saying no one will believe him. When Lucy scoffs at Snoopy's magic abilities, the insulted beagle magically levitates Lucy into the sky like he levitated her during the magic show earlier, and leaves her stuck there as payback. Snoopy and Charlie Brown laugh and happily dance away to conclude a satisfying day, ignoring Lucy's pleas to get her down.\n\nLinus eventually pulls Lucy down with his blanket during the closing credits, and Lucy, angry and embarrassed about what happened, gives up and stomps away.\n\n\n"}

Blackburn and is published by Kenzer & Company. It portrays many of the same stories as Knights of the Dinner Table (KODT) but from the point of view of the player characters themselves.\n\nThe first monthly issue was published in June 2000.\n\nThe comic was suddenly cancelled seemingly mid-story with issue #41 when suddenly (in strip) the \"set\" which the characters were \"acting\" on was knocked over. The \"director\" then informs the \"cast\" that the series was cancelled due to a lack of sales. There was no other explanation listed within the book other than the movie set parody listed in strip.\n\nThe comic centers on the \"Untouchable Trio (plus one)\": the battlemage Teflon Billy, the fighter El Ravager and the thief Knuckles, King of the Wallclimbers. Initially the \"plus one\" was the barbarian Zayre, who eventually departed and was replaced by Thorina.\n\nThe comic occasionally follows the adventures the Black Hands and other characters from KODT, sometimes in other universes (e.g. Cyberhack).\n\nK.ILL is strictly and humorously faithful to the concept that its characters are experiencing reality, and are not merely characters in a role-playing game. Some of the humor stems from the explanations that the characters give for events that, in KODT, stem from the gameplayers' mundane commitments or, in reality, from the comic's business decisions. For example, when Bob (in KODT) is unable to game for a while, Knuckles (in K.ILL) is unavailable due to commitments to his Guild. When K.ILL's artists changed in issue 4, the characters experience and comment on the alteration in their appearance as the result of a \"Hazenberg's Dimension Shifting Portal of Chaos\".\nK.ILL is noticeably more graphically violent than KODT, even while depicting the same event, since in the latter the in-game violence is represented only by dialogue.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17615210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17615210", "title": "Lambiek", "text": "Lambiek\n\nGalerie Lambiek is a Dutch comic book store and art gallery in Amsterdam, founded on November 8, 1968 by . From 1968 to 2015 it was located in the Kerkstraat, but in November 2015 the store moved to the Koningsstraat 27.. As of 2018, Lambiek is the oldest comics store in Europe and the oldest worldwide still in existence. \n\nThe Lambiek website is one of the longest-running resources about comics and cartoonists on the Internet. The website features a web shop for comic books, eComics, and original art, as well as a news page with articles of interest to comics fans and online art exhibitions. The flagship of the site is the \"Comiclopedia\", an illustrated compendium of over 13,700 international comic artists. The site also features a history of Dutch comics, mostly researched and written by Kees Kousemaker.\n\nThe name \"Lambiek\" originated as a misspelling of the name of the comics character Lambik, from the popular Suske & Wiske comic book series created by Belgian artist Willy Vandersteen. The logo of the shop is an image from the \"Suske en Wiske\" album \"Prinses Zagemeel\" (\"Princess Sawdust\").\n\nThe store has held art exhibitions and book signings by comic creators, including Gilbert Shelton, Will Eisner , Tanino Liberatore, Joost Swarte, Peter Pontiac ., Don Lawrence , André Franquin, Robert Crumb , Lorenzo Mattotti , Charles Burns , Daniel Clowes , Jim Woodring , Chris Ware , Judith Vanistendael , Marc Bell , Jillian Tamaki and Mariko Tamaki , David Collier , Glen Baxter , Jaromír Švejdík, Scott McCloud , Dave Cooper , Turtel Onli and Derf Backderf . The shop and the informational website both have a strong focus on underground comics, graphic novels and autobiographical comics. The exhibitions can be profit or non-profit, depending on the subject of the exposition.\n\nKees Kousemaker (1942-2010) was a Dutch comics expert, born in Steenbergen, Netherlands. He first arose to prominence when he opened Lambiek in November 1968, the first specialized comic book store in Europe and the second oldest worldwide after Gary Arlington's San Francisco Comic Book Company which was established earlier that year in April, according to the Lambiek website. Actually, an even older comic book store is known to have opened its doors in May 1967, George Henderson's Canadian, Toronto-based Memory Lane Books (itself a continuation of the Viking Bookshop he had already opened on another location in the spring of 1966), making Lambiek the third oldest store. All three stores had a strong focus on underground comics in common. With Memory Lane Books no longer in existence since the 1980s and the closure of Arlington's store in 2002, Lambiek therefore has become the oldest comic book store still in existence as of 2017. \n\nAs a result of his exhibitions and attention to the early work of young cartoonists such as Peter Pontiac and Joost Swarte, he established collaborations and friendships with many Dutch and international artists, such as Will Eisner. In 1986 Lambiek established its famous gallery, where many comics artists could come and have heavily mediatized exhibitions of their work. The first expo revolved around the magazine \"RAW\" and was co-organized by Joost Swarte. Kousemaker also published books about Dutch comic culture, such as \"Strip voor Strip\" (1970) and \"Stripleksikon der Lage Landen\" (1979). He was also responsible for a special Yiddish edition of Will Eisner's \"A Contract with God\" (1984), which was presented to the press in the presence of Eisner himself. \n\nKees Kousemaker was also the instigator behind the \"Stripheldenbuurt\" in Almere, a district where all the street names were named after famous cartoonists and comics characters. On 11 May 2006 he was knighted in the Order of Orange-Nassau. \n\nKousemaker died April 27, 2010. \n\nAlthough lambiek.net is the store's main domain name, Lambiek started a website www.lambiek.com in 1994 when Kees started to store historical comic book info online. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s the site kept its original blue design, until Kousemaker's death in 2010. From August 2012 on, Kees Kousemaker's son Boris ordered a complete remake of the site, converting all existing information into databases.\n\nThe \"Comiclopedia\" is an online encyclopedia which features biographical information and illustrations, comic strip images, album covers, frame grabs, and memorabilia about every individual comics artist whose name can be identified by signature. All artists are alphabetized and can both be looked up by name or by their nationality. The emphasis is mostly on comics artists, though cartoonists, caricaturists, animators, illustrators and/or celebrities who once drew comics themselves are also listed. Visitors can mail suggestions for new names, additions or corrections. As of 2018 more than 13.700 names have a page. \n\nThe history section also includes an in-depth examination of Bulgarian comics, researched and written by Vladimir Nedialkov, with additions by Stiliana Thepileva . The site also features a historical overview of the comics magazines \"Spirou\", \"Tintin\", \"Pif gadget\", \"Pilote\", and \"Wimmen's Comix\".\n\nLambiek also features separate articles about the Comics Code, Frederic Wertham, Disney comics artists around the world, Rolf Kauka artists, erotic comics, newspaper strips, underground comics and webcomics. There is also a column for thus unidentified comics where the site's owners ask visitors for help with identification of the anonymous artists or with providing more biographical info and/or illustrations about them.\n\n\n\n"}

Mutual knowledge can arise accidentally, due to a failure to design the game properly, so all players independently discover this mutual knowledge, or deliberately, due to the expected course of the game.\n\nThe difference is crucial in a co-operation game. For example, in the game depicted below, with a random event determining the payoff matrix, both players, being fully rational, presume the more likely option to have occurred. However, suppose each player separately finds out that the random number, which was created privately and which determines the payoff matrix, was 1. However, neither are told that the other player is also aware of this. \n\nPlayer A presumes Player B is not aware the random number is 1. They then observe that if the random number is 2-100, the best choice for B is always b1. So they choose a2, which would give them the best possible payoff in this matrix. Symmetrically, Player B presumes Player A expects the random numbers 2-100 and chooses a1, so B chooses b2. As a result, the players had a final result of (1, a2, b2), with a payoff of 1 for both - the lowest possible payoff (total or individual). \n\nNow suppose that it is common knowledge that the random number is 1 - that is, both players are also aware that the other player knows the random number is 1, in addition to knowing this themselves. Given this, the best choice for A is a1, with an average of 6.5, and the best choice for B is b1, with an average of 6.5 also, giving an outcome of (1, a1, b1) with a payoff of 8 for both - the highest possible total payoff. \n\nCommon knowledge tends to lead to co-operative behavior more often than purely mutual knowledge, which can often lead to anti-cooperative behavior as shown in the example above, as the participants are aware that the knowledge is mutual knowledge and can all decide on behalf of this knowledge. This works best in a symmetric game, like the left matrix below. \n"}

{"id": "36430139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36430139", "title": "Penguins of Madagascar", "text": "Penguins of Madagascar\n\nPenguins of Madagascar is a 2014 American 3D computer-animated comedy film, produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by 20th Century Fox. It is a spin-off of the \"Madagascar\" film series, and takes place right after the events of \"\", following the penguins Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private in their own adventure. Apart from the main characters, it is unrelated to the TV series \"The Penguins of Madagascar\".\n\nThe film was directed by Simon J. Smith and Eric Darnell, and written by Michael Colton, John Aboud, and Brandon Sawyer. It stars the voices of Tom McGrath, Chris Miller, Conrad Vernon, Christopher Knights, Benedict Cumberbatch, John Malkovich, and Ken Jeong. The film was released on November 26, 2014. It is the only film in the \"Madagascar\" franchise that was distributed by 20th Century Fox and was the final film produced by Pacific Data Images before its closure on January 22, 2015. Despite earning $373 million on a $132 million budget, the film forced a write-down for the studio.\n\nIn Antarctica, three young penguin brothers—Skipper, Kowalski, and Rico—defy the laws of nature to save an egg the other penguins believe to be doomed. After saving it from a pack of leopard seals and accidentally setting themselves adrift on an iceberg, the egg hatches into their new member, Private.\n\nTen years later (after the events of the ), the penguins decide to leave the circus to celebrate Private's birthday by breaking into the United States Gold Depository at Fort Knox in order to treat him to a discontinued snack called \"Cheezy Dibbles\" in the vending machine of their break room. Despite this, Private begins to feel out of place with the team, as he is constantly described as being the \"secretary/mascot\". Suddenly, they are abducted by the machine and sent to Venice, Italy by Dr. Octavius Brine, a renowned geneticist who removes his human disguise and reveals he is actually an octopus named Dave, who has grown resentful of penguins after their cuteness had him shunned from every zoo and aquarium across the globe.\n\nRico swallows Dave's collection of snowglobes along with a canister of a green substance called the Medusa Serum before the four escape and are chased through the canals and streets of Venice by Dave's henchmen. When cornered, they are rescued by a group of animals from an Arctic elite undercover interspecies task force agency called \"The North Wind\" consisting of their leader, a gray wolf whose name is classified (in which Skipper mistakenly calls him \"Classified\" throughout the film), a harp seal demolitionist named Short Fuse, a polar bear named Corporal, and an intelligent snowy owl named Eva, who Kowalski instantly falls in love with. Their mission is to help animals who can't help themselves and have been fighting Dave to protect the penguin population.\n\nAt their hideout, their communication systems are hacked by Dave, who reveals that he has an enormous supply of the Medusa Serum and that he intends to capture the penguins out of every zoo he was kicked out of. Viewing the penguins as a hindrance to their mission, Classified tranquilizes the group and sends the group to their most remote base (which happens to be on Madagascar) but the penguins awaken mid-flight and crash land in the Sahara Desert before making their way to Shanghai, China, which they mistake for Dublin, Ireland. Discovering Dave's next target in Shanghai using Dave's snowglobe collection, the penguins ship themselves to the same current location and make their way to the zoo. Skipper disguise Private as a mermaid-tailed penguin (a tourist attraction) to distract Dave from his real target, Private himself is captured along with the Shanghai penguins after the North Wind arrives to put a stop to Dave's plan. The penguins take the North Wind's high-tech plane to give chase, but inadvertently self-destruct the machine. They manage to track Private to an island base, using a tracking device planted on him when Classified darted them before planting them in a flight to Madagascar. \n\nMeanwhile, on the island, Dave demonstrates his way to use the medusa serum (most likely gotten from the islands plants) to genetically mutate the penguins into hideous monsters as an effort to make humans disgusted by them as revenge.\n\nSkipper and Classified argue on the best means to rescue the captives and stop Dave, finally settling on Classified's plan of a frontal assault and Skipper agrees to act as a diversion. The North Wind manages to corner Dave in his lair only to be captured by Dave's henchmen as well as the other penguins. Dave demonstrates his mutation ray at full power on Private, apparently disintegrating him with the beam, but unbeknownst to them he escapes at the last minute by using a paper clip he swallowed earlier. Private rescues the North Wind members, who want to regroup due to lack of equipment, but Private, not wanting to leave anyone behind goes to stop Dave. As Dave's submarine docks at New York with the promise of returning the penguins he found to the zoo, he turns the ray on the rest of the penguins, mutating them all into hideous monsters. The city erupts into chaos as the brainwashed, mutated penguins run amok on the terrified human crowd. Getting Skipper, Kowalski and Rico back to their senses, Private decides to connect himself into the ray to return them to normal. After fending off Dave and his henchman, they manage to turn all the penguins back to normal in one huge blast.\n\nPrivate is left partially mutated from the machine while the rest of the penguins are restored to normal. Despite his strange new look, the Penguins show their gratitude and new-found respect for Private. Dave (who was caught in the blast) has been turned into a pipsqueak version of himself and is trapped in a snow globe where he is admired by a little girl. Finally seeing one another as equals, Classified promises to grant the Penguins anything they want. In addition to Kowalski getting a kiss from Eva, the Penguins are given their own jet packs and they then fly off above the clouds looking for their new adventures.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, the Penguins return to the circus and plug Mort into the ray and use him to revert Private back to normal. Mort does not appear to show any side effects from the ray until he manages to swallow King Julien whole.\n\n\nA direct-to-video film featuring the penguins had been in the works since 2005 when the first \"Madagascar\" film was released, with a release date initially planned for 2009. The studio announced in March 2011 that the penguin characters would be given their own feature film to be directed by Simon J. Smith, the co-director of \"Bee Movie\", produced by Lara Breay, and written by Alan J. Schoolcraft and Brent Simons, the writers of DreamWorks' \"Megamind\".\n\nAt the July 2012 Comic-Con, DreamWorks Animation announced that the film, titled \"The Penguins of Madagascar\", would be released in 2015. Robert Schooley, one of the producers of \"The Penguins\" series, said that the film would be unrelated to the TV series of the same name, but added that that could always change. In early September 2012, 20th Century Fox, the studio's new distributor, and DreamWorks Animation announced a release date of March 27, 2015, and a new pair of writers, Michael Colton and John Aboud. Benedict Cumberbatch and John Malkovich joined the cast in August 2013. Malkovich, who had been offered the role of Dr. Octavius Brine three and a half years before the film's release, told an audience at the July 2014 Comic-Con that he thought that it \"was a funny idea\" to use his voice for an octopus.\n\nOn May 20, 2014, the film's release date was moved up to November 26, 2014, from its initial March 27, 2015, date, switching places with DreamWorks Animation's other film \"Home\". Jeffrey Katzenberg, DreamWorks Animation's CEO, reasoned that the film, coming from one of DWA's most successful franchises, would have an easier task to stand out around the Thanksgiving holiday season, while \"Home\" was to try to take advantage of a less competitive spring release window and repeat successful spring launches of some of DWA's original films including \"The Croods\" and \"How to Train Your Dragon\". The film was released two weeks earlier in China, on November 14, 2014.\n\nThe film was released in RealD 3D and Digital 3D formats. It was digitally remastered into the IMAX format, and released in select theaters across Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. A four-issue comic book series based on the film was published by Titan Comics. Written by Alex Matthews and drawn by Lucas Fereyra.\n\n\"Penguins of Madagascar\" was released on DVD, Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D on March 17, 2015. It topped the home video sales chart in its first week.\n\n\"Penguins of Madagascar\" grossed $83.4 million in North America and $290.2 million in foreign countries for a worldwide total of $373.6 million. The film's production budget was $132 million, which, according to the DreamWorks Animation's president Ann Dally, excluded \"incentive-based compensation.\" By the end of 2014, the studio had to take a $57.1 million write-down, primarily related to the performance of \"Penguins of Madagascar\" and another DreamWorks Animation's film \"Mr. Peabody & Sherman\".\n\n\"Penguins of Madagascar\" was released on November 26, 2014 in North America and Canada across 3,764 theatres. It earned $6.25 million on its opening day and $3.95 million the next day on Thanksgiving Day. It earned $10.5 million on Black Friday. The film underperformed during its opening weekend earning $25.4 million and debuting at #2 at the box office behind \"\", for which 3D accounted for 24% of its opening-weekend gross. The opening-weekend audience was evenly split among those under and over the age of 25, with 58% and female accounted 51%. In CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave \"Penguins of Madagascar\" an average grade of A- on an A+ to F scale.\n\nThe film was released in China on November 14, two weeks ahead of its North American debut, and earned $11.3 million from 3,500 screens, debuting at number two at the Chinese box office behind \"Interstellar\" ($42 million). In its opening weekend, the film earned $36.5 million from 47 markets. Overall, the top openings were in Russia ($8.2 million), Korea ($6 million), Italy ($4.63 million), Germany ($4.2 million), and Australia ($3.68 million). The film's opening in Germany was the second-highest for an animated film in 2014, behind \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\".\n\nThe film has a 73% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 107 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's consensus was \"\"Penguins of Madagascar\" is fast and brightly colored enough to entertain small children, but too frantically silly to offer real filmgoing fun for the whole family.\" On Metacritic, the film achieved a score of 53 out of 100 based on 31 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nMichael Rechtshaffen of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" gave the film a negative review, saying \"While there are plenty of madcap antics to fill a feature, all that manic energy ultimately proves to be more exhausting than exhilarating.\" Elizabeth Weitzman of the \"New York Daily News\" gave the film three out of five stars, saying \"Granted, it's no classic, but a sassy script and good-natured voice work from Benedict Cumberbatch and John Malkovich should keep kids and grownups entertained over the holidays.\" Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the film a B, saying \"Frenetic and frequently funny, \"Penguins Of Madagascar\" represents the DreamWorks Animation franchise style—which boils down to self-aware, but naïve, talking animals who learn kid-friendly life lessons—at its most palatable.\" Ben Kenigsberg of \"The New York Times\" gave the film a positive review, saying \"The lack of originality is offset by sheer silliness, including Classified and Skipper's Abbott and Costello-style argument over whether there's a long I in 'diversion.' The word fits the movie.\"\n\nBill Zwecker of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"Once again the \"Madagascar\" team have come up with a winner – a nice way to kick off the Thanksgiving and holiday filmgoing experience for the whole family.\" Lou Lumenick of the \"New York Post\" gave the film one out of four stars, saying \"\"Penguins of Madagascar\" is a lazy, noisy ADHD-addled collection of animated clichés guaranteed to give anyone older than 5 a headache, even if you don't see it in optional 3-D.\" Jeff Labrecque of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a C-, saying \"\"Penguins of Madagascar\" aims primarily for the kiddies, racing from one frenetic action sequence to another like some haywire Walter Lantz cartoon.\"\n\nLorne Balfe composed the original score for the film, making it his first solo debut in a DreamWorks Animation film. Balfe wrote the additional music for the previous two \"Madagascar\" films and helped \"Madagascar\" composer Hans Zimmer with the score for \"Megamind\". The soundtrack was released on November 25, 2014, by Relativity Music Group. Relativity also released an EP, \"Penguins of Madagascar: Black & White Christmas Album\", which featured five holiday songs.\n\nA video game based on the film, titled \"Penguins of Madagascar\", and published by Little Orbit, was released on November 25, 2014 for Nintendo 3DS, Wii, and Wii U.\n\n"}

Zet inserts programming into the Doctor's program to allow them to directly monitor and communicate with him. As the Doctor leaves, Janeway begins to talk with Nar in secret away from Zet, hoping to gain his trust.\n\nThe Doctor, disguised as Janeway, returns along in the \"Delta Flyer\" and creates a fake transmission from a race called the R'Kaal; the R'Kaal transmission describes the area of space they are in as highly unstable to warp fields, and demand \"Voyager\" turn over the warp core, while allowing the crew to settle on a nearby class-M planet. The Doctor — as Janeway — has the \"Delta Flyer\" modified to be able to tractor the warp core away should it become unstable.

{"id": "143284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=143284", "title": "Restoration comedy", "text": "Restoration comedy\n\n\"Restoration comedy\" is English comedy written and performed in the Restoration period from 1660 to 1710. Comedy of manners is used as a synonym of Restoration comedy. After public stage performances had been banned for 18 years by the Puritan regime, the re-opening of the theatres in 1660 signalled a renaissance of English drama. Sexually explicit language was encouraged by King Charles II (1660–1685) personally and by the rakish style of his court. Historian George Norman Clark argues:\n\nThe socially diverse audiences included both aristocrats, their servants and hangers-on, and a substantial middle-class segment. These playgoers were attracted to the comedies by up-to-the-minute topical writing, by crowded and bustling plots, by the introduction of the first professional actresses, and by the rise of the first celebrity actors. This period saw the first professional female playwright, Aphra Behn.\n\n Charles II was an active and interested patron of the drama. Soon after his restoration, in 1660, he granted exclusive play-staging rights, so-called Royal patents, to the King's Company and the Duke's Company, led by two middle-aged Caroline playwrights, Thomas Killigrew and William Davenant. The patentees scrambled for performance rights to the previous generation's Jacobean and Caroline plays, which were the first necessity for economic survival before any new plays existed. Their next priority was to build new, splendid patent theatres in Drury Lane and Dorset Gardens, respectively. Striving to outdo each other in magnificence, Killigrew and Davenant ended up with quite similar theatres, both designed by Christopher Wren, both optimally provided for music and dancing, and both fitted with moveable scenery and elaborate machines for thunder, lightning, and waves.\n\nThe dramatists of the Restoration renounced the tradition of satire, as recently embodied by Ben Jonson, and devoted themselves to the comedy of manners, which uncritically accepted the social code of the upper class.\n\nThe audience of the early Restoration period was not exclusively courtly, as has sometimes been supposed, but it was quite small and could barely support two companies. There was no untapped reserve of occasional playgoers. Ten consecutive performances constituted a smash hit. This closed system forced playwrights to be extremely responsive to popular taste. Fashions in the drama would change almost week by week rather than season by season, as each company responded to the offerings of the other, and new plays were urgently sought. The King's Company and the Duke's Company vied with one another for audience favour, for popular actors, and for new plays, and in this hectic climate the new genres of heroic drama, pathetic drama, and Restoration comedy were born and flourished.\n\nBoth the quantity and quality of the drama suffered when in 1682 the more successful Duke's Company absorbed the struggling King's Company, and the amalgamated \"United Company\" was formed. The production of new plays dropped off sharply in the 1680s, affected by both the monopoly and the political situation (see Decline of comedy below). The influence and the incomes of the actors dropped, too. In the late 80s, predatory investors (\"Adventurers\") converged on the United Company, while management was taken over by the lawyer Christopher Rich. Rich attempted to finance a tangle of \"farmed\" shares and sleeping partners by slashing salaries and, dangerously, by abolishing the traditional perks of senior performers, who were stars with the clout to fight back.\n\nThe company owners, wrote the young United Company employee Colley Cibber, \"who had made a monopoly of the stage, and consequently presum'd they might impose what conditions they pleased upon their people, did not consider that they were all this while endeavouring to enslave a set of actors whom the public were inclined to support.\" Performers like the legendary Thomas Betterton, the tragedienne Elizabeth Barry, and the rising young comedian Anne Bracegirdle had the audience on their side and, in the confidence of this, they walked out.\n\nThe actors gained a Royal \"licence to perform\", thus bypassing Rich's ownership of both the original Duke's and King's Company patents from 1660, and formed their own cooperative company. This unique venture was set up with detailed rules for avoiding arbitrary managerial authority, regulating the ten actors' shares, the conditions of salaried employees, and the sickness and retirement benefits of both categories. The cooperative had the good luck to open in 1695 with the première of William Congreve's famous \"Love For Love\" and the skill to make it a huge box-office success.\n\nLondon again had two competing companies. Their dash to attract audiences briefly revitalised Restoration drama, but also set it on a fatal downhill slope to the lowest common denominator of public taste. Rich's company notoriously offered Bartholomew Fair-type attractions – high kickers, jugglers, ropedancers, performing animals – while the co-operating actors, even as they appealed to snobbery by setting themselves up as the only legitimate theatre company in London, were not above retaliating with \"prologues recited by boys of five, and epilogues declaimed by ladies on horseback\".\n\nRestoration comedy was strongly influenced by the introduction of the first professional actresses. Before the closing of the theatres, all female roles had been taken by boy players, and the predominantly male audiences of the 1660s and 1670s were curious, censorious, and delighted at the novelty of seeing real women engage in risqué repartee and take part in physical seduction scenes. Samuel Pepys refers many times in his famous diary to visiting the playhouse to watch or re-watch the performance of particular actresses, and to how much he enjoys these experiences.\n\nDaringly suggestive comedy scenes involving women became especially common, although of course Restoration actresses were, just like male actors, expected to do justice to all kinds and moods of plays. (Their role in the development of Restoration tragedy is also important, compare She-tragedy.)\n\nA new speciality introduced almost as early as the actresses was the breeches role, which called for an actress to appear in male clothes (breeches being tight-fitting knee-length pants, the standard male garment of the time), for instance to play a witty heroine who disguises herself as a boy to hide, or to engage in escapades disallowed to girls. A quarter of the plays produced on the London stage between 1660 and 1700 contained breeches roles. Playing these cross-dressing roles, women behaved with the freedom society allowed to men, and some feminist critics, such as Jacqueline Pearson, regard them as subversive of conventional gender roles and empowering for female members of the audience. Elizabeth Howe has objected that the male disguise, when studied in relation to playtexts, prologues, and epilogues, comes out as \"little more than yet another means of displaying the actress as a sexual object\" to male patrons, by showing off her body, normally hidden by a skirt, outlined by the male outfit.\n\nSuccessful Restoration actresses included Charles II's mistress Nell Gwyn, the tragedienne Elizabeth Barry who was famous for her ability to \"move the passions\" and make whole audiences cry, the 1690s comedian Anne Bracegirdle, and Susanna Mountfort (a.k.a. Susanna Verbruggen), who had many breeches roles written especially for her in the 1680s and 90s. Letters and memoirs of the period show that both men and women in the audience greatly relished Mountfort's swaggering, roistering impersonations of young women wearing breeches and thereby enjoying the social and sexual freedom of the male Restoration rake.\n\nDuring the Restoration period, both male and female actors on the London stage became for the first time public personalities and celebrities. Documents of the period show audiences being attracted to performances by the talents of particular actors as much as by particular plays, and more than by authors (who seem to have been the least important draw, no performance being advertised by author until 1699). Although the playhouses were built for large audiences—the second Drury Lane theatre from 1674 held 2000 patrons – they were of compact design, and an actor's charisma could be intimately projected from the thrust stage.\n\nWith two companies competing for their services from 1660 to 1682, star actors were able to negotiate star deals, comprising company shares and benefit nights as well as salaries. This advantageous situation changed when the two companies were amalgamated in 1682, but the way the actors rebelled and took command of a new company in 1695 is in itself an illustration of how far their status and power had developed since 1660.\n\nThe greatest fixed stars among Restoration actors were Elizabeth Barry (\"Famous Mrs Barry\" who \"forc 'd Tears from the Eyes of her Auditory\") and Thomas Betterton, both of them active in organising the actors' revolt in 1695 and both original patent-holders in the resulting actors' cooperative.\n\nBetterton played every great male part there was from 1660 into the 18th century. After watching \"Hamlet\" in 1661, Samuel Pepys reports in his diary that the young beginner Betterton \"did the prince's part beyond imagination.\" Betterton's expressive performances seem to have attracted playgoers as magnetically as did the novelty of seeing women on the stage. He was soon established as the leading man of the Duke's Company, and played Dorimant, the seminal irresistible Restoration rake, at the première of George Etherege's \"Man of Mode\" (1676). Betterton's position remained unassailable through the 1680s, both as the leading man of the United Company and as its stage manager and \"de facto\" day-to-day leader. He remained loyal to Rich longer than many of his co-workers, but eventually it was he who headed the actors' walkout in 1695, and who became the acting manager of the new company.\n\nVariety and dizzying fashion changes are typical of Restoration comedy. Even though the \"Restoration drama\" unit taught to college students is likely to be telescoped in a way that makes the plays all sound contemporary, scholars now have a strong sense of the rapid evolution of English drama over these forty years and of its social and political causes. The influence of theatre company competition and playhouse economics is also acknowledged.\nRestoration comedy peaked twice. The genre came to spectacular maturity in the mid-1670s with an extravaganza of aristocratic comedies. Twenty lean years followed this short golden age, although the achievement of Aphra Behn in the 1680s is to be noted. In the mid-1690s a brief second Restoration comedy renaissance arose, aimed at a wider audience. The comedies of the golden 1670s and 1690s peak times are extremely different from each other. An attempt is made below to illustrate the generational taste shift by describing \"The Country Wife\" (1675) and \"The Provoked Wife\" (1697) in some detail. These two plays differ from each other in some typical ways, just as a Hollywood movie of the 1950s differs from one of the 1970s. The plays are not, however, offered as being \"typical\" of their decades. Indeed, there exist no typical comedies of the 1670s or the 1690s; even within these two short peak-times, comedy types kept mutating and multiplying.\n\nThe drama of the 1660s and 1670s was vitalised by the competition between the two patent companies created at the Restoration, as well as by the personal interest of Charles II, and the comic playwrights rose to the demand for new plays. They stole freely from the contemporary French and Spanish stage, from English Jacobean and Caroline plays, and even from Greek and Roman classical comedies, and combined the looted plotlines in adventurous ways. Resulting differences of tone in a single play were appreciated rather than frowned on, as the audience prized \"variety\" within as well as between plays. Early Restoration audiences had little enthusiasm for structurally simple, well-shaped comedies such as those of Molière; they demanded bustling, crowded multi-plot action and fast pace. Even a splash of high heroic drama might be thrown in to enrich the comedy mix, as in George Etherege's \"Love in a Tub\" (1664), which has one heroic verse \"conflict between love and friendship\" plot, one urbane wit comedy plot, and one burlesque pantsing plot. (\"See illustration, top right\".) Such incongruities contributed to Restoration comedy being held in low esteem in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, but today the early Restoration total theatre experience is again valued on the stage, as well as by postmodern academic critics.\n\nThe unsentimental or \"hard\" comedies of John Dryden, William Wycherley, and George Etherege reflected the atmosphere at Court, and celebrated with frankness an aristocratic macho lifestyle of unremitting sexual intrigue and conquest. The Earl of Rochester, real-life Restoration rake, courtier and poet, is flatteringly portrayed in Etherege's \"The Man of Mode\" (1676) as a riotous, witty, intellectual, and sexually irresistible aristocrat, a template for posterity's idea of the glamorous Restoration rake (actually never a very common character in Restoration comedy). Wycherley's \"The Plain Dealer\" (1676), a variation on the theme of Molière's \"Le Misanthrope\", was highly regarded for its uncompromising satire and earned Wycherley the appellation \"Plain Dealer\" Wycherley or \"Manly\" Wycherley, after the play's main character Manly. The single play that does most to support the charge of obscenity levelled then and now at Restoration comedy is probably Wycherley's \"The Country Wife\" (1675). \n\n\"The Country Wife\" has three interlinked but distinct plots, which each project sharply different moods:\n\n1. Horner's impotence trick provides the main plot and the play's organising principle. The upper-class town rake Horner mounts a campaign for seducing as many respectable ladies as possible, first spreading a false rumour of his own impotence, to be allowed where no complete man may go. The trick is a great success and Horner has sex with many married ladies of virtuous reputation, whose husbands are happy to leave him alone with them. In one famously outrageous scene, the \"China scene\", sexual intercourse is assumed to take place repeatedly just off stage, where Horner and his mistresses carry on a sustained double entendre dialogue purportedly about Horner's china collection. \"The Country Wife\" is driven by a succession of near-discoveries of the truth about Horner's sexual prowess (and thus the truth about the respectable ladies), from which he extricates himself by quick thinking and good luck. Horner never becomes a reformed character, but keeps his secret to the end and is assumed to go on merrily reaping the fruits of his planted misinformation, past the last act and beyond.\n\n2. The married life of Pinchwife and Margery is based on Molière's \"School for Wives\". Pinchwife is a middle-aged man who has married an ignorant young country girl in the hope that she will not know to cuckold him. However, Horner teaches her, and Margery cuts a swathe through the sophistications of London marriage without even noticing them. She is enthusiastic about the virile handsomeness of town gallants, rakes, and especially theatre actors (such self-referential stage jokes were nourished by the new higher status of actors), and keeps Pinchwife in a state of continual horror with her plain-spokenness and her interest in sex. A running joke is the way Pinchwife's pathological jealousy always leads him into supplying Margery with the very type of information he wishes her not to have.\n\n3. The courtship of Harcourt and Alithea is a comparatively uplifting love story in which the witty Harcourt wins the hand of Pinchwife's sister Alithea from the hands of the Upper-class town snob Sparkish, to whom she was engaged until discovering he loved her only for her money.\n\nWhen the two companies were amalgamated in 1682 and the London stage became a monopoly, both the number and the variety of new plays being written dropped sharply. There was a swing away from comedy to serious political drama, reflecting preoccupations and divisions following on the Popish Plot (1678) and the Exclusion Crisis (1682). The few comedies produced also tended to be political in focus, the Whig dramatist Thomas Shadwell sparring with the Tories John Dryden and Aphra Behn. Behn's unique achievement as an early professional woman writer has been the subject of much recent study.\n\nDuring the second wave of Restoration comedy in the 1690s, the \"softer\" comedies of William Congreve and John Vanbrugh reflected mutating cultural perceptions and great social change. The playwrights of the 1690s set out to appeal to more socially mixed audiences with a strong middle-class element, and to female spectators, for instance by moving the war between the sexes from the arena of intrigue into that of marriage. The focus in comedy is less on young lovers outwitting the older generation, more on marital relations after the wedding bells. Thomas Southerne's dark \"The Wives' Excuse\" (1691) is not yet very \"soft\": it shows a woman miserably married to the fop Friendall, everybody's friend, whose follies and indiscretions undermine her social worth, since her honour is bound up in his. Mrs Friendall is pursued by a would-be lover, a matter-of-fact rake devoid of all the qualities that made Etherege's Dorimant charming, and she is kept from action and choice by the unattractiveness of all her options. All the humour of this \"comedy\" is in the subsidiary love-chase and fornication plots, none in the main plot.\n\nIn Congreve's \"Love for Love\" (1695) and \"The Way of the World\" (1700), the \"wit duels\" between lovers typical of 1670s comedy are underplayed. The give-and-take set pieces of couples still testing their attraction for each other have mutated into witty prenuptial debates on the eve of marriage, as in the famous \"Proviso\" scene in \"The Way of the World\" (1700). Vanbrugh's \"The Provoked Wife\" (1697) follows in the footsteps of Southerne's \"Wives' Excuse\", with a lighter touch and more humanly recognisable characters.\n\n\"The Provoked Wife\" is something of a Restoration problem play in its attention to the subordinate legal position of married women and the complexities of \"divorce\" and separation, issues that had been highlighted in the mid-1690s by some notorious cases before the House of Lords (see Stone).\n\nSir John Brute in \"The Provoked Wife\" is tired of matrimony. He comes home drunk every night and is continually rude and insulting to his wife. She is meanwhile being tempted to embark upon an affair with the witty and faithful Constant. Divorce is not an option for either of the Brutes at this time, but forms of legal separation have recently come into existence, and would entail a separate maintenance to the wife. Such an arrangement would not allow remarriage. Still, muses Lady Brute, in one of many discussions with her niece Bellinda, \"These are good times. A woman may have a gallant and a separate maintenance too.\"\n\nBellinda is at the same time being grumpily courted by Constant's friend Heartfree, who is surprised and dismayed to find himself in love with her. The bad example of the Brutes is a constant warning to Heartfree to not marry.\n\n\"The Provoked Wife\" is a talk play, with the focus less on love scenes and more on discussions between female friends (Lady Brute and Bellinda) and male friends (Constant and Heartfree). These exchanges are full of jokes, but are also thoughtful and have a dimension of melancholy and frustration.\n\nAfter a forged-letter complication, the play ends with marriage between Heartfree and Bellinda and stalemate between the Brutes. Constant continues to pay court to Lady Brute, and she continues to shilly-shally.\n\nThe tolerance for Restoration comedy even in its modified form was running out at the end of the 17th century, as public opinion turned to respectability and seriousness even faster than the playwrights did. Interconnected causes for this shift in taste were demographic change, the Glorious Revolution of 1688, William's and Mary's dislike of the theatre, and the lawsuits brought against playwrights by the Society for the Reformation of Manners (founded in 1692). When Jeremy Collier attacked Congreve and Vanbrugh in his \"Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage\" in 1698, he was confirming a shift in audience taste that had already taken place. At the much-anticipated all-star première in 1700 of \"The Way of the World\", Congreve's first comedy for five years, the audience showed only moderate enthusiasm for that subtle and almost melancholy work. The comedy of sex and wit was about to be replaced by the drama of obvious sentiment and exemplary morality.\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, the sexual frankness of Restoration comedy ensured that theatre producers cannibalised it or adapted it with a heavy hand, rather than actually performed it. Today, Restoration comedy is again appreciated on the stage. The classics, Wycherley's \"The Country Wife\" and \"The Plain-Dealer\", Etherege's \"The Man of Mode\", and Congreve's \"Love For Love\" and \"The Way of the World\" have competition not only from Vanbrugh's \"The Relapse\" and \"The Provoked Wife\", but from such dark, unfunny comedies as Thomas Southerne's \"The Wives Excuse\". Aphra Behn, once considered unstageable, has had a major renaissance, with \"The Rover\" now a repertory favourite.\n\nDistaste for sexual impropriety long kept Restoration comedy not only off the stage but also locked in a critical poison cupboard. Victorian critics like William Hazlitt, although valuing the linguistic energy and \"strength\" of the canonical writers Etherege, Wycherley, and Congreve, always found it necessary to temper aesthetic praise with heavy moral condemnation. Aphra Behn received the condemnation without the praise, since outspoken sex comedy was considered particularly offensive coming from a woman author. At the turn of the 20th century, an embattled minority of academic Restoration comedy enthusiasts began to appear, for example the important editor Montague Summers, whose work ensured that the plays of Aphra Behn remained in print.\n\n\"Critics remain astonishingly defensive about the masterpieces of this period\", wrote Robert D. Hume as late as 1976. It is only over the last few decades that that statement has become untrue, as Restoration comedy has been acknowledged a rewarding subject for high theory analysis and Wycherley's \"The Country Wife\", long branded the most obscene play in the English language, has become something of an academic favourite. \"Minor\" comic writers are getting a fair share of attention, especially the post-Aphra Behn generation of women playwrights which appeared just around the turn of the 18th century: Delarivier Manley, Mary Pix, Catharine Trotter, and Susannah Centlivre. A broad study of the majority of never-reprinted Restoration comedies has been made possible by Internet access (by subscription only) to the first editions at the British Library.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section lists a selection of seminal critical studies.\n\n\n"}

The original name was \"Nefandus\", but later was changed to \"Shade: Wrath of Angels\" before its release. The history revolves around an ancient war between angels and gods.\n\n\"Shade: Wrath of Angels\" is a third-person RPG with over 30 hours of gameplay. The game consists of action/adventure elements with hidden secrets and twists.\nThe game includes four different chapters traveling through different times and dimensions.\nThere are 30 different levels with a tutorial included. The player has the ability to wield both weapons or cast spells on 20 different types of enemies. The player also holds the ability to transform into a demon over a limited period of time. The player can upgrade his health and magic charm by collecting the golden drops, which are available throughout the game.\n\nThe plot revolves around the player receiving an invitation from his brother 'B'. In his letter, 'B' has claimed to have discovered an important archaeological site, which appears to be a very primitive one. But on reaching the town, the player is amazed to find out that all its residents are missing. He reaches the Hotel where his brother has written to be boarded. But on reaching the Hotel, he finds nothing but a pistol left by his brother for him. He decides to check the Church but on his way downstairs, he is stunned to see a zombie, in the lobby. He however shoots the zombie and goes to the Church, only to encounter two more zombies therein. After dealing with them, he finds a secret passage and moves into it to descend down and finds an orb. After the player comes out of the room with the orb, a misty figure appears and reveals to him a fearful secret. The figure reveals to the player that she is the Angel of Faith, and the orb he is carrying is her heart. The Angel of Faith asks the player to release the three other angels to bring his brother back. When the player agrees, the Angel gives him her loyal servant, an immortal red demon to help him on his quest. The player is teleported by the Angel to each of the three worlds where the pieces of the hearts of the other three angels are kept, the first being in the world of undead knights (themed on a medieval period with walking dead, the zombies and undead knights), the second being in the Pyramid of Egyptian God Seth (themed on pyramids, with living statues, mummies and undead worshippers of mighty Seth) and the third being in the world of eternal darkness, the 'Shadowland' (themed on a shadowy plain with creatures of darkness everywhere). But on collecting the three hearts of the angels and reunifying them, the Angel of Faith reappears and reveals her true horrifying form. She turns out to be the Dark Angel, who opposed the Gods and set the war between the four worlds. The player vows to stop the evil by breaking all the hearts of the angels, but the other three noble angels appear and ask the player to destroy the demon, who helped him on his quests. The player kills the demon with his magic sword, and the noble angels trap the Angel of Faith. The angels then reveal to him that his brother's soul is sealed and can not be made to live again. The angels then transform the player to an immensely powerful guardian, to protect all the four hearts of the angels with his magic sword till the end of time, or (if you charged the sword with power, instead of the demon, during the middle of the game) the main character will wake up in the train and his brother is seen on the railway platform.\n\nThe game received mostly negative reviews. It currently holds a 50/100 score at Metacritic based on 12 reviews.\n\n"}
{"id": "443138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=443138", "title": "Shinjuku Ni-chōme", "text": "Shinjuku Ni-chōme\n\nShinjuku Ni-chōme (新宿二丁目), referred to colloquially as Ni-chōme or simply Nichō, is Area 2 in the Shinjuku District of the Shinjuku Special Ward of Tokyo, Japan. With Tokyo home to 13 million people, and Shinjuku known as the noisiest and most crowded of its 23 special wards, Ni-chōme further distinguishes itself as Tokyo's hub of gay subculture, housing the world's highest concentration of gay bars.\n\nWithin close walking distance from three train stations (Shinjuku San-chōme Station, Shinjuku Gyoenmae Station, and Japan's busiest train station, Shinjuku Station), the Shinjuku Ni-chōme neighborhood provides a specialized blend of bars, restaurants, cafes, saunas, love hotels, gay pride boutiques, cruising boxes (hattenba), host clubs, nightclubs, massage parlors, parks, and gay book and video stores. In fact within the five blocks centering on street Naka-Dōri between the BYGS building at the Shinjuku San-chōme Station and the small Shinjuku park three blocks to the east, an estimated 300 gay bars and nightclubs provide entertainment.\n\nThe history of Ni-chōme as a gay neighborhood generally begins around the time of the American Occupation of Japan (1945-1952) and ties strongly to the fall of its red-light districts (akasen). As early as 1948, there is mention of a gay Shinjuku tea shop, and by the 1950s gay bars publicly emerged both in name and form in Ni-chōme.\n\nBefore 1957, Tokyo’s red-light districts had flourished as legally-licensed centers for sex workers but, armed with a new constitution and an Equal Rights amendment, post-occupation Japanese women's Christian groups and the like successfully lobbied the Diet to pass the Prostitution Prevention Law in 1956. For the first time, prostitution in Japan became illegal. As the traditional sex industry left Ni-chōme, a gay subculture began to fill its place. By the late 1950s Ni-chōme was known for its popularity in the gay subculture, and a club scene began to emerge.\n\nMore recent years have seen the establishment of a counseling room for young gay men in 1976, the first AIDS candlelight vigil in 1986, the 1992 inauguration of Tokyo’s annual International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival, Japan’s first lesbian and gay pride parade in 1994, and the founding of its first gay community center, AKTA. Today Shinjuku Ni-chōme continues to provide a home base for many milestones in the history of Japan’s LGBT community.\n\n\"The Japan Times\" reported in February 2010 that the area was in decline, with the number of gay-oriented clubs and bars having declined by one-third. The decline was attributed to the construction of the nearby Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line, which has pushed up property values in the area, and the rise of the Internet.\n\nAs of August 17, 2012, dancing has been banned in a number of popular clubs in Ni-chome, including Arty Farty, Annex, Arch, and Aisotope.\n\nThe lifeblood of the gay neighborhood, the majority of Nichōme's hundreds of night clubs typically seat fewer than a dozen customers, who preferably represent a club's specialized subset of the gay subculture. In a society where traditionally most of the population was expected to marry, many LGBT Japanese choose to privately express their sexuality within the anonymity of specialty clubs in areas like Ni-chōme. To achieve this specialization, clubs are typically segregated by \"scene.\" There are bars that cater specifically to the bear community, BDSM, muscular men, young men, butch and femme lesbians, etc. Club owners called “masters” or “mama-sans” try to attract the unique crowds that characterize their clubs, going so far as to deny service or charge additional fees to less-desired customers. For example, Nichōme nightclub Avanti charges a ¥1000 entrance fee to women and gay men, and ¥1500 to “typical” men; club Kusuo, ¥1000 to men, ¥1500 to women; and club Koimo, ¥1500 to gay men, and ¥2000 to everyone else.\n\nWhile most bar owners do accommodate new and non-Japanese customers, the scene is primarily geared toward regular customers who are Japanese. Some venues discourage or prohibit non-Japanese from entering, regardless of Japanese language ability. At most bars in Shinjuku Ni-chōme, patrons sit at a counter and chat with the bartender. Karaoke is popular, and gay magazines are often available. Most bars offer a “bottle keep” (ボトルキープ) system, so many regular customers choose to keep their own bottles of liquor at their favorite bars. This loyalty is then repaid by bar-organized outings to onsen, hanami parties, picnics, and gay sporting events. Bars maintain large commemorative photo albums of these outings. In contrast, a handful of establishments specifically target foreigners with English advertising. Five clubs — Advocates, Arty Farty, Dragon, GB, and Rehab — are particularly popular amongst foreign men and their admirers, but they do not offer bottle-keep services. Advocates, though very small, is especially known for large weekend crowds of natives and foreigners that spill out onto the sidewalk and adjacent street.\n\nAlthough there are no gay clubs in Ni-chōme that can hold more than 100 customers, large gay events held throughout the year attract up to several thousand people to the area.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "48469265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48469265", "title": "TVBully", "text": "TVBully\n\nTVBully () refers to the monopolistic market dominance of free-to-air television in Hong Kong. Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) was blamed for this monopolization and this phenomenon had been a huge challenge for the operation of TVB. ATV has also complained about TVB's monopoly abuse. \n\nThe term TVBully was created by Hong Kong citizens, using the name of the television station \"TVB\" in the beginning, adding \"Bully\" at the end of the term. The low quality of programmes are one of the main reasons of the complains.\n\nThe free-to-air television services in Hong Kong began with Television Broadcasts (TVB) in November 19, 1967. The second free-to-air broadcaster Asia Television (ATV) launched as Rediffusion Television (RTV) in December 1, 1973.\nThe brilliant time of the market is in the 1970s to 1980s, with the launch of the third broadcaster, Commercial Television (CTV). It first went on air on September 9, 1975 but ceased transmissions on August 22, 1978 due to financial pressure.\n\nIn the 1990s, ATV was unable to recover from setbacks due to a variety number of internal operation problems. The Chief Executive in Council rejected the license renewal application of ATV on April 1, 2015, which the services will cease transmissions on April 1, 2016.\n\nThe closure of CTV and having the lower hand of ATV probably helps TVB to gain the greatest market share for over 48 years. Indeed, TVB channels captured an overall 81% audience share against all TV channels in Hong Kong during weekday primetime. According to CSM Media Research, TVB Pearl gained over 90% share in 2012 by comparing with its one and the only competitor, ATV World.\nHowever, in the 2010s, many Hong Kongers are unsatisfied with the current television services. Many have discontented towards the monopoly structure probably leads to deteriorate the quality of programmes of TVB, the main programmes producer in Hong Kong, which is superficial and usual, undiversified programmes choice and monopolized the resources in the cultural industry. Some netizens organized an internet concern group, which held activities to express their discontents, such as the \"switch-off incident\" of \"TVB Anniversary 2013\".\n\nThe cause of monopolization of TVB has been probably found that restriction of issuing the license is the main reason resulting this phenomenon. In 1965, the government aimed to issue one license of operating free-to-air analog television broadcasting service and six tycoon groups such as Shaw Brothers (HK) Ltd. and Fuji Television of Japan were attracted to bid. Ultimately, the license was granted to Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) and the service commenced in 1967. In the other words, access of market of competitive companies which produced similar products with TVB were limited by the Authority's policy.\n\nIn 1972, Rediffusion obtained the second license to operate the analog television. There was a great competition between TVB, Rediffusion and Commercial Television in 70s to 80s. Because of the rapid development of Commercial Television and headhunting by Rediffusion, TVB confronted with various challenges including turnover of staff and cancellation of programs. However, TVB maintained its competitive edge during the period whereas other two had declined in broadcast popularity or one of them even closed down within three years. This situation and popularity of TVB resulted in TV viewing habit of Hong Kong citizens and the market position of TVB was difficult to be altered.\n\nTVB has been accused of producing programs of low quality in the recent decades. In the Reports of public consultation on the services of free-to-air broadcasters released by the Communications Authority in 2015, most of the attended public reflected that the programs from TVB are being deficient in quality as a tendency and some of them are even below acceptable standard because of lacking competition. For example, some audiences discontent the mistakes, which can be easily spotted within a soap opera due to the scarce research done on the show, because TVB is not necessary to focus on programmes quality as she is the monopolist. Also, some reflected that it is condemned to have the same background setting and actors are repeated among many different shows in which the audiences thought that TVB lacks of sincerity in terms of the use of resources.\n\nMoreover, the Report stated that TVB is perceived copying the ideas from other countries instead of creating their own ones, not to mention its lack of creativity that, for instance, the \"Super Trio Series\" had been broadcast from 1995 till 2014 without changing most of the elements in the show.\n\nAccording to a HKU POP survey released in 2013, a slight decline is shown on the appreciation index of the TV program provided by TVB, which implies that there may be need to retain the dropping quality of the TV program.\n\nThe monopoly power of TVB inhabits and affects the development of Hong Kong Cultural Industry such as Performing Arts Industry, Music Industry and Television Industry. By December 2009, the Communications Authority launched an investigation into TVB after rival ATV's complaint, alleging that TVB had violated the Broadcasting Ordinance. TVB was then fined HK$900,000 by the city’s communications watchdog for engaging in anti-competition practices including \"harsh and unreasonable\" terms in contracts with some singers and artistes, and a \"No Cantonese Policy\" that prohibits contract artistes from speaking Cantonese on other Hong Kong TV stations’ programmes. \nOn June 12, 2014, the Communications Authority received Hong Kong Television Network (HKTVN)'s complaint against TVB, alleging that TVB had executed in anti-competition conduct by abusing trade mark law and procedures to prevent HKTVN from obtaining a domestic free-to-air television programme services licence (\"FTV licence\") in order to strengthen TVB's dominance in Hong Kong television programme service market.\nMeanwhile, due to dominance, the quality of the product of TVB declines with times. The exporting local series production line once being hot in 70s to 80s such as Hong Hei Gun, was then closed down which greatly affects the development of Performing Arts Industry, Television Industry and Cultural Industry in Hong Kong.\n\n\n"}

The Talking band has collaborated with numerous performers and artists including: Taylor Mac, Louise Smith, Marcus Gardley, and Lizzie Olesker.\n\nThe company is known for producing original works of theater that combine music, language, and choreographed movement in unconventional ways to create unique audience perspective on a wide range of subject material. Since its founding, the group has produced 46 original plays, and has performed its plays at theater venues around New York City and throughout the world.\n\nThe group was founded in 1974 by Maddow and Shepard and Zimet, along with Sybille Hayn, Mark Samuels, Margo Lee Sherman, Charles Stanley and Arthur Strimling. It has its roots in the work of The Open Theatre, where company members Maddow and Shepard and Zimet worked as core company members. The Open Theatre had been founded by director, actor and writer Joseph Chaikin, and after Chaikin disbanded The Open Theatre in 1973, Maddow, Shepard and Zimet joined with the other Talking Band founding members to start the new company.

With her students she has directed fifteen shows, most of them developed collaboratively with the ensemble.\n\nZimet is a writer, director and actor, and is the group's artistic director. He has directed over thirty-five original works for the company, including the following plays which he wrote: \"New Islands Archipelago\", \"Imminence\", \"Belize\", \"The Parrot\", \"Star Messengers\", \"Bitterroot\", \"Party Time\", \"Black Milk Quartet\" and \"New Cities\". He received an Obie Award for his direction of \"Painted Snake in a Painted Chair\", and three Obie Awards for his work with The Open Theatre and The Winter Project. He is a recipient of the 2008 NewYorkTheatre.Com People of the Year award; The Frederick Loewe Award in Musical Theater; and a Playwrights' Center National McKnight Fellowship. He is an alumnus of the New Dramatists.\n\nThe group uses a collaborative creative process that incorporates the approaches and aesthetics of artists in a variety of media and arts fields. Throughout its history, it has collaborated with influential artists from a range of backgrounds, including composers Swados, Peter Gordon and \"Blue\" Gene Tyranny; designers Julie Taymor, Theodora Skipitares, Janie Geiser, Nic Ularu, Carol Mullins, Kiki Smith, and Anna Kiraly; writer and performance artist Taylor Mac; and magician Peter Samelson.\n\nIn 1996, the group created The Performance Lab, establishing a more formal structure for their collaborative development process. This process allows it to work with young artists and guest artists to explore new creative directions and integrate new perspectives. Since 1996, the group has produced seventeen shows through The Performance Lab.\n\nThe group is a resident company at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Cluban off-Broadway theatre located on East 4th Street in the East Village of New York City's Manhattan boroughwhere it has produced and performed many of its plays. The group's first production at La MaMa was \"Pedro Paramo\" in 1979.\n\nIt has also performed at many of New York City's leading off-off Broadway theater venues, including HERE, Performance Space 122, 3LD Art & Technology Center, Theatre for the New City, The Ohio Theater, Dance Theater Workshop and Dixon Place.\n\nThe group has also performed extensively internationally, including The Roundhouse in London, England; The American Center in Paris, France; The Music Gallery in Toronto, Ontario, Canada; the Kovcheg Theater in Moscow, Russia; the Teatro La Batuta in Santiago, Chile; and the National Theatre Bucharest in Bucharest, Romania.\n\n\n"}

Each book was written in the second person, with the reader choosing how the story should progress. They were designed by Byron Preiss Visual Publications. \n\nThe main difference between the \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" series and the \"Time Machine\" series was that \"Time Machine\" books featured only one ending, forcing the reader to try many different choices until they discovered it. Also, the series taught children basic history about many diverse subjects, from dinosaurs to World War II. Only the sixth book in the series, \"The Rings of Saturn\", departed from actual history; it is set in the future, and features educational content about the solar system. Some books gave the reader their choice from a small list of equipment at the beginning, and this choice would affect events later in the book (e.g. \"If you brought the pen knife, turn to page 52, if not turn to page 45.\"). Another main difference between the \"Time Machine\" novels and the \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" counterparts was hints offered at certain junctures, where the reader was advised to look at hints at the back of the book. An example was in \"Mission to World War II\" about the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, where the reader was given the choice of starting the mission in the Jewish ghetto or the Aryan part of Warsaw, in which the hint read \"Hitler may have had Jewish family members\", suggesting the reader should begin in the Jewish section of the city, but not ordering it, or it was possible for the hint to be missed.\n\nThe line spawned a brief spin-off series for younger readers, the \"Time Traveler\" novels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Video is recorded on an FM signal with a bandwidth of 5.5 MHz. Three longitudinal audio tracks are recorded on the tape as well: two audio and one Linear timecode (LTC) track. BCN 50 VTRs were used at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.\n\nThe format required an optional, and costly, digital framestore in addition to the normal analog timebase corrector to do any \"trick-play\" operations, such as slow motion/variable-speed playback, frame step play, and visible shuttle functions. This was because, unlike 1 inch type C which recorded one field per helical scan track on the tape, Type B segmented each field to 5 or 6 tracks per field according to whether it was a 525 (NTSC) or 625 (PAL) line machine.\n\nThe picture quality was excellent, and standard R/P machines, digital frame store machines, reel-to-reel portables, random access cart machines (for playback of short-form video material such as television commercials), and portable cart versions were marketed.\n\nEcho Science Corporation, a United States company, made units like a BCN 1 for the U.S. military for a short time in the 1970s.

The \"short-lived\" genre emerged in the United States in the early 1970s, exploiting the popularity of vans with young people, was very popular in the mid to late 1970s, and disappeared in the early 1980s. Vansploitation films were originally made mostly for young audiences. \"Blue Summer\" (1973) is credited as the first film of the genre which continued with films like \"The Van\" (1977) and \"Van Nuys Blvd.\" (1979), the latter having been called \"the most technically competent Vansploitation film\".\n\nCoffman argues that the mere appearance of a van in a film does not make it a vansploitation film. The van has to serve a special purpose in the story, which is summed up in the trailer of \"Van Nuys Blvd.\": \"Freedom, fun and fine transportation\". Often, vans were highly customized, up to the extent of having an entirely custom body in \"Supervan\". Besides the van itself, van culture (wardrobe, magazines, meetings of van drivers) is also often featured prominently.\n\nThe genre follows two earlier ones that also dealt with car-related topics popular in youth culture at their respective times: In the 1950s, films featuring Hot Rods became very popular, and they were followed by motorcycle films in the 1960s (for example, \"The Wild Angels\" and \"Easy Rider\"). As the popularity of vans in youth culture increased in the early 1970s, the first vansploitation films were created. Multiple factors are credited with creating the \"customized van craze\". For example, in 1975, the song \"Chevy Van\" by Sammy Johns sold about three million copies, and is credited for an increase in van sales the following year. The song (among others by Sammy Johns) was used prominently in the soundtrack of \"The Van\" (1977).\n\nCoffman names six films as \"essential texts\" for the vansploitation genre:\n\n1973: \"Blue Summer\" (aka \"Love Truck\"), directed by Chuck Vincent\n\n1976: \"C.B. Hustlers\", directed by Stu Segall\n\n1977: \"The Van\", directed by Sam Grossman\n\n1977: \"Supervan\", directed by Lamar Card\n\n1978: \"Mag Wheels\" (aka \"Summer School\"), directed by Bethel Buckalew\n\n1979: \"Van Nuys Blvd.\", directed by William Sachs\n\n"}
{"id": "113240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=113240", "title": "Ventriloquism", "text": "Ventriloquism\n\nVentriloquism, or ventriloquy, is an act of stagecraft in which a person (a ventriloquist) changes his or her voice so that it appears that the voice is coming from elsewhere, usually a puppeteered prop, known as a \"dummy\". The act of ventriloquism is ventriloquizing, and the ability to do so is commonly called in English the ability to \"throw\" one's voice.\n\nOriginally, ventriloquism was a religious practice. The name comes from the Latin for \"to speak from the stomach\", i.e. \"venter\" (belly) and \"loqui\" (speak). The Greeks called this gastromancy (). The noises produced by the stomach were thought to be the voices of the unliving, who took up residence in the stomach of the ventriloquist. The ventriloquist would then interpret the sounds, as they were thought to be able to speak to the dead, as well as foretell the future. One of the earliest recorded group of prophets to use this technique was the Pythia, the priestess at the temple of Apollo in Delphi, who acted as the conduit for the Delphic Oracle.\n\nOne of the most successful early gastromancers was Eurykles, a prophet at Athens; gastromancers came to be referred to as \"Euryklides\" in his honour. \nIn the Middle Ages, it was thought to be similar to witchcraft. One of the uses was by people pretending to be mediums or those claiming to be able to cast out evil spirits, and throwing the voice added to their credibility. Unfortunately, it was not unusual for (particularly) women doing this to be accused and burnt as witches. As Spiritualism led to stage magic and escapology, so ventriloquism became more of a performance art as, starting around the 19th century, it shed its mystical trappings.\n\nOther parts of the world also have a tradition of ventriloquism for ritual or religious purposes; historically there have been adepts of this practice among the Zulu, Inuit, and Māori peoples.\n\nThe shift from ventriloquism as manifestation of spiritual forces toward ventriloquism as entertainment happened in the eighteenth century at the travelling funfairs and market towns. An early depiction of a ventriloquist dates to 1754 in England, where Sir John Parnell is depicted in the painting \"An Election Entertainment\" by William Hogarth as speaking via his hand. In 1757, the Austrian Baron de Mengen performed with a small doll.\n\nBy the late 18th century, ventriloquist performances were an established form of entertainment in England, although most performers threw their voice to make it appear that it emanated from far away, rather than the modern method of using a puppet. A well known ventriloquist of the period, Joseph Askins, who performed at the Sadler's Wells Theatre in London in the 1790s advertised his act as \"curious ad libitum Dialogues between himself and his invisible familiar, Little Tommy\". However, other performers were beginning to incorporate dolls or puppets into their performance, notably the Irishman James Burne who \"... carries in his pocket, an ill-shaped doll, with a broad face, which he exhibits ... as giving utterance to his own childish jargon,\" and Thomas Garbutt.\n\nThe entertainment came of age during the era of the music hall in the United Kingdom and vaudeville in the United States. George Sutton began to incorporate a puppet act into his routine at Nottingham in the 1830s, but it is Fred Russell who is regarded as the father of modern ventriloquism. In 1886, he was offered a professional engagement at the Palace Theatre in London and took up his stage career permanently. His act, based on the cheeky-boy dummy \"Coster Joe\" that would sit in his lap and 'engage in a dialogue' with him was highly influential for the entertainment format and was adopted by the next generation of performers. (A blue plaque has been embedded in a former residence of Russell by the British Heritage Society which reads 'Fred Russell the father of ventriloquism lived here').\nFred Russell's successful comedy team format was applied by the next generation of ventriloquists. It was taken forward by the British Arthur Prince with his dummy Sailor Jim, who became one of the highest paid entertainers on the music hall circuit, and by the Americans The Great Lester, Frank Byron, Jr., and Edgar Bergen. Bergen popularised the idea of the comedic ventriloquist. Bergen, together with his favourite figure, Charlie McCarthy, hosted a radio program that was broadcast from 1937 to 1956. It was the #1 program on the nights it aired. Bergen continued performing until his death in 1978, and his popularity inspired many other famous ventriloquists who followed him, including Paul Winchell, Jimmy Nelson, David Strassman, Jeff Dunham, Terry Fator, Ronn Lucas, Wayland Flowers, Shari Lewis, Willie Tyler, Jay Johnson, Nina Conti, and Darci Lynne Farmer. Another ventriloquist popular in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s was Señor Wences.\n\nThe art of ventriloquism was popularised by Y. K. Padhye in North India and M. M. Roy in South India, who are believed to be the pioneers of this field in India. Y. K. Padhye's son Ramdas Padhye borrowed from him and made the art popular amongst the masses through his performance on television. Ramdas Padhye's son Satyajit Padhye is also a ventriloquist. Similarly, Indusree a female ventriloquist from Bangalore has contributed a lot to the art. She performs with 3 dummies simultaneously. Venky Monkey and Mimicry Srinivos, the disciples of M. M. Roy, popularized this art by giving shows in India and abroad. Mimicrist Srinivos, in particular, did several experiments in ventriloquism. He has popularized this art, calling it \"Sound illusion.\" He goes into the audience without a microphone and entertains with point blank sound illusion in addition to entertaining on stage with dummies.\n\nVentriloquism's popularity waned for a while, probably because of modern media's electronic ability to convey the illusion of voice, the natural special effect that is the heart of ventriloquism. In the U.K. in the 2000s there were only 15 full-time professional ventriloquists, down from around 400 in the 50s and 60s. A number of modern ventriloquists have developed a following as the public taste for live comedy grows. In 2007, Zillah & Totte won the first season of Sweden's Got Talent and became one of Sweden's most popular family/children entertainers. A feature-length documentary about ventriloquism, \"I'm No Dummy\", was released in 2010. Two different ventriloquists won seasons 10 and 12 of \"America's Got Talent\". Respectively, they were Paul Zerdin on September 16, 2015, and Darci Lynne Farmer on September 20, 2017.\n\nOne difficulty ventriloquists face is that all the sounds that they make must be made with lips slightly separated. For the labial sounds \"f\", \"v\", \"b\", \"p\", and \"m\", the only choice is to replace them with others. A widely parodied example of this difficulty is the \"gottle o' gear\", from the reputed inability of less skilled practitioners to pronounce \"bottle of beer\". If variations of the sounds \"th\", \"d\", \"t\", and \"n\" are spoken quickly, it can be difficult for listeners to notice a difference.\n\nModern ventriloquists use a variety of different types of puppets in their presentations, ranging from soft cloth or foam puppets (Verna Finly's work is a pioneering example), flexible latex puppets (such as Steve Axtell's creations) and the traditional and familiar hard-headed knee figure (Tim Selberg's mechanized carvings). The classic dummies used by ventriloquists (the technical name for which is ventriloquial figure) vary in size anywhere from twelve inches tall to human-size and larger, with the height usually falling between thirty-four and forty-two inches. Traditionally, this type of puppet has been made from papier-mâché or wood. In modern times, other materials are often employed, including fiberglass-reinforced resins, urethanes, filled (rigid) latex, and neoprene.\n\nGreat names in the history of dummy making include Jeff Dunham, Frank Marshall (the Chicago creator of Bergen's Charlie McCarthy, Nelson's Danny O'Day, and Winchell's Jerry Mahoney), Theo Mack and Son (Mack carved Charlie McCarthy's head), Revello Petee, Kenneth Spencer, Cecil Gough, and Glen & George McElroy. The McElroy brothers' figures are still considered by many ventriloquists as the apex of complex movement mechanics, with as many as fifteen facial and head movements controlled by interior finger keys and switches. Jeff Dunham referred to his McElroy figure Skinny Duggan as \"the Stradivarius of dummies.\"\n\nFilms and programs which refer to dummies that are alive and frightening include \"Magic\", \"Dead of Night\", \"The Twilight Zone\", \"Poltergeist\", \"Devil Doll\", \"Dead Silence\", \"Child's Play\", \"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\", \"Goosebumps\", \"Seinfeld\" (the episode \"The Chicken Roaster\"), \"ALF\" (the episode \"I'm Your Puppet\"), and \"Doctor Who\" in different episodes. \nLiterary examples of frightening ventriloquist dummies include Gerald Kersh's \"The Horrible Dummy\" and the story \"The Glass Eye\" by John Keir Cross.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48512843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48512843", "title": "Wayang kulit", "text": "Wayang kulit\n\nWayang kulit is a traditional performing arts of puppet-shadow play found in the cultures of Java, Bali, and Lombok, in Indonesia. In a wayang kulit performance, the puppet figures are rear-projected on a taut linen screen with a coconut-oil (or electric) light. The Dalang (shadow artist) manipulates carved leather figures between the lamp and the screen to bring the shadows to life. \n\nWayang kulit is one of the many different forms of wayang theatre found in Indonesia, the other being \"wayang beber, wayang klitik, wayang golek, wayang topeng\", and \"wayang wong\". Wayang kulit is among the best known, offering a unique combination of ritual, lesson and entertainment. On November 7, 2003, UNESCO designated \"wayang kulit\" from Indonesia as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.\n\nThe term \"wayang\" is the Javanese word for shadow, or \"bayang\" in standard Indonesian; the word also means \"imagination\". \n\nIn modern daily Javanese and Indonesian vocabulary, \"wayang\" can refer to the puppet itself or the whole puppet theatre performance. While \"kulit\" means skin or leather, the material from which the figures are carved.\n\nHinduism arrived in Indonesia from India before the Islamic and Christian era. Sanskrit became the literary and court language of Java and later of Bali.\n\nThe Hindus changed the \"Wayang\" (as did Muslims, later) to spread their religion, mostly telling stories from the Mahabharata or the Ramayana. This mixture of religion and \"wayang\" play was later praised as harmony between Hinduism and traditional Indonesian culture.\n\nWhen Islam began spreading in Indonesia, the display of God or gods in human form was prohibited, and thus this style of painting and shadow play was suppressed. King Raden Patah of Demak, Java, wanted to see the \"wayang\" in its traditional form, but failed to obtain permission from Muslim religious leaders.\n\nReligious leaders attempted to skirt the Muslim prohibition by converting the \"wayang golek\" into \"wayang purwa\" made from leather and displayed only the shadow instead of the puppets themselves.\n\nThe wayang comes in sizes from 25 cm to 75 cm. The important characters are usually represented by several puppets each. The wayang is usually made out of water buffalo hide and goat hide and mounted on bamboo sticks. However, the best wayang is typically made from young female buffalo parchment, cured for up to ten years. The carving and punching of the rawhide, which is most responsible for the character's image and the shadows that are cast, are guided by this sketch. A mallet is used to tap special tools, called \"tatah\", to punch the holes through the rawhide. Making the wayang sticks from horn is a complicated process of sawing, heating, hand-molding, and sanding until the desired effect is achieved. When the materials are ready, the artist attaches the handle by precisely molding the ends of the horn around the individual wayang figure and securing it with thread. A large character may take months to produce.\n\nThere are important differences, between the 3 Islands where Wayang Kulit is played (due to local religious canon) :\n\n\nSee the gallery below, where the Mahabharata character shown is Kresna (all pictures, except the last one)\n\nThe stage of a wayang performance includes several components. A stretched linen canvas (\"kelir\") acted as a canvas, dividing the dalang (puppeteer) and the spectator. A coconut-oil lamp (Javanese \"blencong\" or Balinese \"damar\") – which in modern time usually replaced with electric light – casts shadow onto the screen. A banana trunk (Javanese \"gedebog\", Balinese \"gedebong\") lies on the ground between the screen and the dalang, where the figures are stuck to hold them in place. To the right of the dalang sits the puppet chest, which the dalang uses as a drum during the performance, hitting it with a wooden mallet. In a Javanese wayang kulit performance, the dalang may use a cymbal-like percussion instrument at his feet to cue the musicians. The musicians sit behind the dalang in a gamelan orchestra setting. Gamelan orchestra is an integral part of the Javanese wayang kulit performance. The performance are accompanied with female singers (\"pesinden\") and male singers (\"wirasuara\"). \n\nThe setting of the banana trunk on the ground and canvas on the sky symbolizes each the earth and the sky, the whole composition symbolizes the entire cosmos. When the dalang animates the puppet figures and moves it across the screen, divine forces are acting in his hands with which he directs the happening. The lamp is a symbol of the sun as well as the eye of the dalang.\n\nA traditional wayang kulit performance begins after dark. The first of the three phases, in which the characters are introduced and the conflict is launched, lasts until midnight. The battles and intrigues of the second phase are about three hours. The third phase of reconciliation and friendship is finished at dawn.\n\n\"Wayang\" shadow plays are usually tales from the two major Hindu epics, the \"Ramayana\" and \"Mahabharata\". The puppet master contextualizes stories from the plays, making them relevant to current community, national or global issues. Gamelan players respond to the direction of the Dalang.\n\n\n"}

Introduced by Senator Burton K. Wheeler (D-Montana), it recommended that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fix the maximum power used by AM broadcasting stations at 50,000 watts. Shortly thereafter the FCC formally adopted the suggested 50,000 watt cap, which still remains the limit.\nOn June 9, 1938, Senator Wheeler submitted a resolution for consideration by the full body:\nAt the time this resolution was introduced, FM and TV stations did not yet exist, and there were fewer than 700 AM stations, many struggling economically due to the effects of the Great Depression. In 1928, under the provisions of the Federal Radio Commission's (FRC) General Order 40, broadcasting stations had been divided into three main categories: \"local\", limited to 100 watts, \"regional\", limited to 1,000 watts, and \"clear\", generally capped at 50,000 watts. Subsequently the daytime maximum for local stations had been raised to 250 watts, and to 5,000 watts for regional stations. Wheeler's resolution was related to the fact that the FCC was preparing to hold a series of hearing reviewing the future of the AM broadcating band, including transmitting power levels. \n\nIn 1938 there already was one station, WLW in Cincinnati, Ohio, operating with significantly higher power than 50,000 watts. Beginning in 1934 WLW received a series of temporary authorizations to use 500,000 watts, moreover, the FCC had received applications from more than a dozen additional stations to start using powers above 50,000 watts. The prospect of numerous \"superpower\" stations made many lower powered stations concerned that they would be \"drowned out\" and unable to compete economically, which would lead to a reduction in the number of operating stations. Wheeler, an avid anti-monopolist, also warned that domination of the airwaves by high-powered stations could lead to the rise of a dictator like Mussolini in Italy, Hitler in Germany or Stalin in the Soviet Union, each of whom used control of radio broadcasting to aid their seizures of power.\n\nWheeler's Resolution 294 was adopted by the full senate on June 13. Although Senator Robert J. Bulkley (D-Ohio) entered a motion to reconsider the vote, he withdrew the motion the next day. A resolution, unlike a law, was not binding on the FCC, however it was seen as having an important influence on the outcome of its hearings.\n\nAfter concluding the hearings, in early 1939 the FCC announced its new regulations, which narrowed the power differences between low and high-powered stations. Local stations could now use up to 250 watts at night, and regional stations 5,000 watts. On the other hand, in language that largely echoed the financial arguments of the Wheeler resolution, clear channel stations were still limited to 50,000 watts, and WLW's authorization to use 500,000 watts, except experimentally during early morning hours, was terminated. Although subsequently many AM stations in other countries, especially in Europe and Asia, would use far greater powers, in the United States the Wheeler resolution's 50,000 watt cap has remained in place.\n"}

It was the first story book published by Puffin Books.\n\nThe books were adapted for radio and television a number of times, most successfully with former \"Doctor Who\" actor Jon Pertwee taking the lead role from 1979 to 1981 in the Southern Television series \"Worzel Gummidge\", originally produced in the UK (this series was ranked among the top 50 greatest British children's programmes) and later in New Zealand (1987–1989). For the TV series Gummidge had a set of interchangeable turnip, mangelwurzel and swede heads, each of which suited a particular occasion or endowed him with a specific skill.\n\nWorzel Gummidge is a scarecrow that can come to life on Scatterbrook Farm. Worzel stands in ten acre field. He befriended John and Susan who came to stay during the School holidays on the Braithwaites Farm. Worzel normally lands John and Susan in trouble when he is being mischievous, as he goes into a sulk and becomes a normal lifeless scarecrow. This leads others to blame the two children for the trouble Worzel causes.\n\nThe Worzel Gummidge books differ from the television adaption; one difference being that in the books Worzel was married to Earthy Mangold. In the first book, Aunt Sally (his Femme fatale in the TV series) is only mentioned in one chapter and the character is an antagonistic bully to Worzel. For the television adaptation, Worzel has a collection of interchangeable heads. In the books, the maker of Worzel Gummidge and other scarecrows is not named the Crowman, but is described as mysterious figure.\n\n\nThe first paperback version of the first book, released in 1941, has the distinction of being the first story book published by the famous children's imprint Puffin.\n\nThe first broadcast with Worzel was before World War II on the BBC's Children's Hour. By 1946, Worzel was played by veteran radio actor Philip Wade, John by John Clark, Susan by Rosamund Barnes, and Earthy Mangold by Mabel Constanduros. Later, Worzel was played by Denis Folwell, who went on to play Jack Archer in the long-running BBC radio 4 soap opera \"The Archers\".\n\nThe character first appeared on television in 1953 in a four-part series.\n\nIn July 1967 five Worzel Gummidge stories were read on \"Jackanory\" by Gordon Rollings. \"Worzel Gummidge Again\" was read in November 1974 (with one story tying in with Guy Fawkes Night) by Geoffrey Bayldon, later to appear in the 1979-81 TV series.\n\nSouthern Television's production for ITV was written by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall, and starred Jon Pertwee as Worzel, with Una Stubbs as Aunt Sally, a life-size fairground doll and Worzel's femme fatale. This was a significant change from the original books, where Aunt Sally is, in fact, Worzel's aunt. The Crowman, who made Worzel and some of his other scarecrow friends, was played by Geoffrey Bayldon, better known for his starring role as the title character of \"Catweazle\". Bill Maynard also appeared as a scarecrow called Sergeant Beetroot.\n\nTelevision New Zealand and Channel 4 (UK) co-funded a follow-up series that ran for two seasons in 1987 and 1989, with Worzel Gummidge and Aunt Sally, still played by Pertwee and Stubbs, relocated to New Zealand.\n\nIn 2018, British media reported Mackenzie Crook could be starring in a contemporary adaptation of the Worzel Gummidge books in a new TV series for the BBC.\n"}
