The music includes songs by Katy Perry, Bruno Mars, Michael Jackson, The Village People, Britney Spears, Lady Gaga and Hall and Oats, among others. Like other pantomime-style musicals, the show includes magic, dancing, singing, acting, audience interactivity and sing-a-long segments.\n\nThe story follows the traditional Snow White fairytale with some additional characters. Muddles is the court jester to the Queen and is Snow White's best friend. As in other pantomimes, the 4th wall is broken by the actors, who encourage the audience to cheer for Snow White and Boo the Wicked Queen.\n\n\n\nThe show was first produced in 2011 at the El Portal Theatre in North Hollywood starring Lindsay Pearce in the title role, Erich Bergen as Prince Harry, and Marina Sirtis as the Wicked Queen. The show featured Neil Patrick Harris as the onscreen Magic Mirror. It received generally positive reviews.\n\nThe show was revived in December 2012 by the Pasadena Playhouse and featured Ariana Grande as Snow White, Curt Hansen as Prince Harry and Charlene Tilton as the Wicked Queen. The show once again featured Neil Patrick Harris as the onscreen Magic Mirror and received positive reviews.\n\nIn 2013 the show was produced at the Rose Wagner Theatre in Salt Lake City starring David Osmond and Amy Whitcomb.

{"id": "2032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2032", "title": "Acting", "text": "Acting\n\nActing is an activity in which a story is told by means of its enactment by an actor or actress who adopts a character—in theatre, television, film, radio, or any other medium that makes use of the mimetic mode.\n\nActing involves a broad range of skills, including a well-developed imagination, emotional facility, physical expressivity, vocal projection, clarity of speech, and the ability to interpret drama. Acting also demands an ability to employ dialects, accents, improvisation, observation and emulation, mime, and stage combat. Many actors train at length in specialist programmes or colleges to develop these skills. The vast majority of professional actors have undergone extensive training. Actors and actresses will often have many instructors and teachers for a full range of training involving singing, scene-work, audition techniques, and acting for camera.\n\nMost early sources in the West that examine the art of acting (, \"hypokrisis\") discuss it as part of rhetoric.\n\nOne of the first known actors is believed to have been an ancient Greek called Thespis of Icaria. Writing two centuries after the event, Aristotle in his \"Poetics\" () suggests that Thespis stepped out of the dithyrambic chorus and addressed it as a separate character. Before Thespis, the chorus narrated (for example, \"Dionysus did this, Dionysus said that\"). When Thespis stepped out from the chorus, he spoke as if he was the character (for example, \"I am Dionysus, I did this\"). To distinguish between these different modes of storytelling—enactment and narration—Aristotle uses the terms \"mimesis\" (via enactment) and \"diegesis\" (via narration). From Thespis' name derives the word \"thespian\".\n\nA professional actor is someone who is paid to act. Professional actors sometimes undertake unpaid work for a variety of reasons, including educational purposes or for charity events. Amateur actors are those who do not receive payment for performances.\n\nNot all people working as actors in film, television, or theatre are professionally trained. Bob Hoskins, for example, had no formal training before becoming an actor.\n\nConservatories and drama schools typically offer two- to four-year training on all aspects of acting. Universities mostly offer three- to four-year programs, in which a student is often able to choose to focus on acting, whilst continuing to learn about other aspects of theatre. Schools vary in their approach, but in North America the most popular method taught derives from the 'system' of Konstantin Stanislavski, which was developed and popularised in America as method acting by Lee Strasberg, Stella Adler, Sanford Meisner, and others.\n\nOther approaches may include a more physically based orientation, such as that promoted by theatre practitioners as diverse as Anne Bogart, Jacques Lecoq, Jerzy Grotowski, or Vsevolod Meyerhold. Classes may also include psychotechnique, mask work, physical theatre, improvisation, and acting for camera.\n\nRegardless of a school's approach, students should expect intensive training in textual interpretation, voice, and movement. Applications to drama programmes and conservatories usually involve extensive auditions. Anybody over the age of 18 can usually apply. Training may also start at a very young age. Acting classes and professional schools targeted at under-18s are widespread. These classes introduce young actors to different aspects of acting and theatre, including scene study.\n\nIncreased training and exposure to public speaking allows humans to maintain calmer and more relaxed physiologically. By measuring a public speaker’s heart rate maybe one of the easiest ways to judge shifts in stress as the heart rate increases with anxiety . As actors increase performances, heart rate and other evidence of stress can decrease. This is very important in training for actors, as adaptive strategies gained from increased exposure to public speaking can regulate implicit and explicit anxiety. By attending an institution with a specialization in acting, increased opportunity to act will lead to more relaxed physiology and decrease in stress and its effects on the body. These effects can vary from hormonal to cognitive health that can impact quality of life and performance \n\nSome classical forms of acting involve a substantial element of improvised performance. Most notable is its use by the troupes of the \"commedia dell'arte\", a form of masked comedy that originated in Italy.\n\nImprovisation as an approach to acting formed an important part of the Russian theatre practitioner Konstantin Stanislavski's 'system' of actor training, which he developed from the 1910s onwards. Late in 1910, the playwright Maxim Gorky invited Stanislavski to join him in Capri, where they discussed training and Stanislavski's emerging \"grammar\" of acting. Inspired by a popular theatre performance in Naples that utilised the techniques of the \"commedia dell'arte\", Gorky suggested that they form a company, modelled on the medieval strolling players, in which a playwright and group of young actors would devise new plays together by means of improvisation. Stanislavski would develop this use of improvisation in his work with his First Studio of the Moscow Art Theatre. Stanislavski's use was extended further in the approaches to acting developed by his students, Michael Chekhov and Maria Knebel.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the use of improvisation was pioneered by Joan Littlewood from the 1930s onwards and, later, by Keith Johnstone and Clive Barker. In the United States, it was promoted by Viola Spolin, after working with Neva Boyd at a Hull House in Chicago, Illinois (Spolin was Boyd's student from 1924 to 1927). Like the British practitioners, Spolin felt that playing games was a useful means of training actors and helped to improve an actor's performance. With improvisation, she argued, people may find expressive freedom, since they do not know how an improvised situation will turn out. Improvisation demands an open mind in order to maintain spontaneity, rather than pre-planning a response. A character is created by the actor, often without reference to a dramatic text, and a drama is developed out of the spontenous interactions with other actors. This approach to creating new drama has been developed most substantially by the British filmmaker Mike Leigh, in films such as \"Secrets & Lies\" (1996), \"Vera Drake\" (2004), \"Another Year\" (2010), and \"Mr. Turner\" (2014).\n\nImprovisation is also used to cover up if an actor or actress makes a mistake.\n\nSpeaking or acting in front of an audience is a stressful situation, which causes an increased heart rate(Baldwin, 1980 Lacey, 1995).\n\nIn a 2017 study on American university students, actors of various experience levels all showed similarly elevated heart rates throughout their performances; this agrees with previous studies on professional and amateur actors' heart rates(Konijin,1993). While all actors experienced stress, causing elevated heart rate, the more experienced actors displayed less heart rate variability than the less experienced actors in the same play. The more experienced actors experienced less stress while performing, and therefore had a smaller degree of variability than the less experienced, more stressed actors. The more experienced an actor is, the more stable their heart rate will be while performing, but will still experience elevated heart rates.\n\nThe semiotics of acting involves a study of the ways in which aspects of a performance come to operate for its audience as signs. This process largely involves the production of meaning, whereby elements of an actor's performance acquire significance, both within the broader context of the dramatic action and in the relations each establishes with the real world.\n\nFollowing the ideas proposed by the Surrealist theorist Antonin Artaud, however, it may also be possible to understand communication with an audience that occurs 'beneath' significance and meaning (which the semiotician Félix Guattari described as a process involving the transmission of \"a-signifying signs\"). In his \"The Theatre and its Double\" (1938), Artaud compared this interaction to the way in which a snake charmer communicates with a snake, a process which he identified as \"mimesis\"—the same term that Aristotle in his \"Poetics\" (c. 335 BCE) used to describe the mode in which drama communicates its story, by virtue of its embodiment by the actor enacting it, as distinct from \"diegesis\", or the way in which a narrator may describe it. These \"vibrations\" passing from the actor to the audience may not necessarily precipiate into significant elements as such (that is, consciously perceived \"meanings\"), but rather may operate by means of the circulation of \"affects\".\n\nThe approach to acting adopted by other theatre practitioners involve varying degrees of concern with the semiotics of acting. Konstantin Stanislavski, for example, addresses the ways in which an actor, building on what he calls the \"experiencing\" of a role, should also shape and adjust a performance in order to support the overall significance of the drama—a process that he calls establishing the \"perspective of the role\". The semiotics of acting plays a far more central role in Bertolt Brecht's epic theatre, in which an actor is concerned to bring out clearly the sociohistorical significance of behaviour and action by means of specific performance choices—a process that he describes as establishing the \"not/but\" element in a performed physical \"\"gestus\" within context of the play's overal \"Fabel\"\". Eugenio Barba argues that actors ought not to concern themselves with the significance of their performance behaviour; this aspect is the responsibility, he claims, of the director, who weaves the signifying elements of an actor's performance into the director's dramaturgical \"montage\".\n\nThe theatre semiotician Patrice Pavis, alluding to the contrast between Stanislavski's 'system' and Brecht's demonstrating performer—and, beyond that, to Denis Diderot's foundational essay on the art of acting, \"Paradox of the Actor\" (c. 1770—78)—argues that:\nActing was long seen in terms of the actor's sincerity or hypocrisy—should he believe in what he is saying and be moved by it, or should he distance himself and convey his role in a detached manner? The answer varies according to how one sees the effect to be produced in the audience and the social function of theatre.\n\nElements of a semiotics of acting include the actor's gestures, facial expressions, intonation and other vocal qualities, rhythm, and the ways in which these aspects of an individual performance relate to the drama and the theatrical event (or film, television programme, or radio broadcast, each of which involves different semiotic systems) considered as a whole. A semiotics of acting recognises that all forms of acting involve conventions and codes by means of which performance behaviour acquires significance—including those approaches, such as Stanislvaski's or the closely related method acting developed in the United States, that offer themselves as \"a natural kind of acting that can do without conventions and be received as self-evident and universal.\" Pavis goes on to argue that:\nAny acting is based on a codified system (even if the audience does not see it as such) of behaviour and actions that are considered to be believable and realistic or artificial and theatrical. To advocate the natural, the spontaneous, and the instinctive is only to attempt to produce natural effects, governed by an ideological code that determines, at a particular historical time, and for a given audience, what is natural and believable and what is declamatory and theatrical.\nThe conventions that govern acting in general are related to structured forms of play, which involve, in each specific experience, \"rules of the game.\" This aspect was first explored by Johan Huizinga (in \"Homo Ludens\", 1938) and Roger Caillois (in \"Man, Play and Games\", 1958). Caillois, for example, distinguishes four apects of play relevant to acting: \"mimesis\" (simulation), \"agon\" (conflict or competition), \"alea\" (chance), and \"illinx\" (vertigo, or \"vertiginous psychological situations\" involving the spectator's identification or catharsis). This connection with play as an activity was first proposed by Aristotle in his \"Poetics\", in which he defines the desire to imitate in play as an essential part of being human and our first means of learning as children:\nFor it is an instinct of human beings, from childhood, to engage in mimesis (indeed, this distinguishes them from other animals: man is the most mimetic of all, and it is through mimesis that he develops his earliest understanding); and equally natural that everyone enjoys mimetic objects. (IV, 1448b)\nThis connection with play also informed the words used in English (as was the analogous case in many other European languages) for drama: the word \"play\" or \"game\" (translating the Anglo-Saxon \"plèga\" or Latin \"ludus\") was the standard term used until William Shakespeare's time for a dramatic entertainment—just as its creator was a \"play-maker\" rather than a \"dramatist\", the person acting was known as a \"player\", and, when in the Elizabethan era specific buildings for acting were built, they was known as \"play-houses\" rather than \"theatres.\"\n\nActors and actresses need to make a resume when they go to auditions, similarly to when people of other occupations go into an interview. The acting resume is very different from the normal resume, it has a lot less information on it with lists, instead of paragraphs and it should have the head shot on the back.\n\nAuditioning is the act of performing either a monologue or sides the casting director either mails or emails to the actors right before your audition. Auditioning entails showing the skills the actors have to instantly turn into a completely different person within a two-minute frame period. For theater auditions it can be longer than two minutes or they can perform more than one monologue, each casting director can have different requirements for actors. For auditions, actors will have to go dressed similarly to the character they are auditioning for to make it easier for the casting director to visualize them as the character. For television or film they will have to undergo more than one audition, if the casting director chooses to put them forward into the process. Oftentimes actors are called into another audition last minute and will send them the sides either the morning of or the night before. Auditioning can be part of the stressful side to acting, especially if one is not trained to audition.\n\nRehearsal is a process in which actors prepare and practice a performance, exploring the vicissitudes of conflict between characters, testing specific actions in the scene, and finding means to convey a particular sense. Some actors continue to rehearse a scene throughout the run of a show in order to keep the scene fresh in their minds and exciting for the audience.\n\nA critical audience with evaluative spectators is known to induce stress on actors during performance, (see Bode & Brutten) and an actor will typically rate the quality of their performance higher than their spectators. Heart rates are generally always higher during a performance with an audience when compared to rehearsal, however what's interesting is that this audience also seems to induce a higher quality of performance. Simply put, while public performances cause extremely high stress levels in actors (more so amateur ones), the stress actually improves the performance, supporting the idea of \"positive stress in challenging situations\"\n\nDepending on what an actor is doing, his or her heart rate will vary. This is the body's way of responding to stress. Prior to a show one will see an increase in heart rate due to anxiety. While performing an actor has an increased sense of exposure which will increase performance anxiety and the associated physiological arousal, such as heart rate. Heart rates increases more during shows compared to rehearsals because of the increased pressure, which is due to the fact that a performance has a potentially greater impact on an actors career. After the show you will see a decrease in the heart rate due to the conclusion of the stress inducing activity. Often the heart rate will return to normal after the show or performance is done; however, during the applause after the performance there is a rapid spike in heart rate. This can be seen not only in actors but also with public speaking and musicians.\n\nThere is a correlation between heart-rate and stress when actors' are performing in front of an audience. Actors claim that having an audience has no change in their stress level, but as soon as they come on stage their heart-rate rises quickly. A 2017 study done in an American University looking at actors' stress by measuring heart-rate showed individual heart-rates rose right before the performance began for those actors opening. There are many factors that can add to an actors' stress. For example, length of monologues, experience level, and actions done on stage including moving the set. Throughout the performance heart-rate rises the most before an actor is speaking. The stress and thus heart-rate of the actor then drops significantly at the end of a monologue, big action scene, or performance. This idea of getting stressed during the anticipation period for any big moment happening is applied throughout the performance. Stress, therefore, has a bigger impact on the actor's overall performance whether motivating or pressuring them to give a more proficient end performance.\n\n"}

{"id": "99498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99498", "title": "Anansi", "text": "Anansi\n\nAnansi ( ) is an Akan folktale character. He often takes the shape of a spider and is considered to be the spirit of all knowledge of stories. He is also one of the most important characters of West African and Caribbean folklore.\n\nHe is also known as Ananse, Kwaku Ananse, and Anancy. In the New World he is known as Nancy, Aunt Nancy and Sis' Nancy. He is a spider, but often acts and appears as a man.\n\nThe Anansi tales originated from the Akan people of present-day Ghana. The word Ananse is Akan and means \"spider\". They later spread to West Indies, Suriname, Sierra Leone (where they were introduced by Jamaican Maroons) and the Netherlands Antilles. On Curaçao, Aruba, and Bonaire, he is known as Kompa Nanzi, and his wife as Shi Maria.\n\nAnansi is depicted in many different ways. Sometimes he looks like an ordinary spider, sometimes he is a spider wearing clothes or with a human face and sometimes he looks much more like a human with spider elements, such as eight legs.\n\nAnansi tales are some of the best-known amongst the Ashanti people of Ghana. The stories made up an exclusively oral tradition, and indeed Anansi himself was synonymous with skill and wisdom in speech. It was as remembered and told tales that they crossed to the Caribbean and other parts of the New World with captives via the Atlantic slave trade.\nIn the Caribbean, Anansi is often celebrated as a symbol of slave resistance and survival. Anansi is able to turn the tables on his powerful oppressors by using his cunning and trickery, a model of behaviour utilised by slaves to gain the upper hand within the confines of the plantation power structure. Anansi is also believed to have played a multifunctional role in the slaves' lives; as well as inspiring strategies of resistance, the tales enabled enslaved Africans to establish a sense of continuity with their African past and offered them the means to transform and assert their identity within the boundaries of captivity. As historian Lawrence W. Levine argues in \"Black Culture and Consciousness\", enslaved Africans in the New World devoted “the structure and message of their tales to the compulsions and needs of their present situation” (1977, 90).\n\nStories of Anansi became such a prominent and familiar part of Ashanti oral culture that the word Anansesem—\"spider tales\"—came to embrace all kinds of fables. One of the few studies that examine the role of Anansi folktales among the Ashanti of Ghana is R.S. Rattray’s Akan-Ashanti Folk-Tales (1930). The tales in Rattray’s collection were recorded directly from Ashanti oral storytelling sessions and published in both English and Twi. Peggy Appiah, who collected Anansi tales in Ghana and published many books of his stories, wrote: \"So well known is he that he has given his name to the whole rich tradition of tales on which so many Ghanaian children are brought up – anansesem – or spider tales.\"\nElsewhere they have other names, for instance Ananse-Tori in Suriname, Anansi in Guyana, and Kuent'i Nanzi in Curaçao.\n\nFor Africans in the diaspora, the Jamaican versions of these stories are the most well preserved, because Jamaica had the largest concentration of enslaved Asante in the Americas. All Anansi stories in Jamaica have a proverb at the end. At the end of the story \"Anansi and Brah Dead\", there is a proverb that suggests that even in times of slavery, Anansi was referred to by his Akan original name: Kwaku Anansi or simply as \"Kwaku\" interchangeably with \"Anansi\". The proverb is: \"If yuh cyaan ketch Kwaku, yuh ketch him shut\", which refers to when Brah Dead (brother death or drybones), a personification of Death, was chasing Anansi to kill him. \nMeaning: The target of revenge and destruction, even killing, will be anyone very close to the intended, such as loved ones and family members.\n\nThere is an Anansi story that explains the phenomenon of how his name became attached to the whole corpus of tales:\n\nOnce there were no stories in the world. The Sky-God, Nyame, had them all. Anansi went to Nyame and asked how much they would cost to buy.\n\nNyame set a high price: Anansi must bring back Onini the Python, Osebo the Leopard, and the Mboro Hornets.\n\nAnansi set about capturing these. First he went to where Python lived and debated out loud whether Python was really longer than the palm branch or not as his wife Aso says. Python overheard and, when Anansi explained the debate, agreed to lie along the palm branch. Because he cannot easily make himself completely straight a true impression of his actual length is difficult to obtain, so Python agreed to be tied to the branch. When he was completely tied, Anansi took him to Nyame.\n\nTo catch the leopard, Anansi dug a deep hole in the ground. When the leopard fell in the hole Anansi offered to help him out with his webs. Once the leopard was out of the hole he was bound in Anansi's webs and was carried away.\n\nTo catch the hornets, Anansi filled a calabash with water and poured some over a banana leaf he held over his head and some over the nest, calling out that it was raining. He suggested the hornets get into the empty calabash, and when they obliged, he quickly sealed the opening.\n\nAnansi handed his captives over to Nyame. Nyame rewarded him by making him the god of all stories.\n\nThere are many variants of this tale, both recorded from oral sources and published. Indeed, the number of children's illustrated book versions of this one tale demonstrates how successfully Anansi has made the transition into literature. The summary above is of an illustrated book version \"Anansi Does the Impossible, an Ashanti tale retold\" by Verna Aardema and illustrated by Lisa Desimini.\n\nAnother picture book version is the Caldecott Medal-winning \"A Story a Story\", retold and illustrated by Gail E. Haley, which takes its title from a traditional Ashanti way of beginning such tales: \"We do not really mean, we do not really mean that what we are about to say is true. A story, a story; let it come, let it go\" and finishes traditionally with: \"This is my story which I have related. If it be sweet, or if it be not sweet, take some elsewhere, and let some come back to me.\"\n\nThere are many other children's adaptations of this story including:\n\nAnother story tells of how Anansi once tried to hoard all of the world's wisdom in a pot (in some versions a calabash). Anansi was already very clever, but he decided to gather together all the wisdom he could find and keep it in a safe place.\n\nWith all the wisdom sealed in a pot, he was still concerned that it was not safe enough, so he secretly took the pot to a tall thorny tree in the forest (in some versions the silk cotton tree). His young son, Ntikuma, saw him go and followed him at some distance to see what he was doing.\n\nThe pot was too big for Anansi to hold while he climbed the tree, so he tied it in front of him. Like this, the pot was in the way and Anansi kept slipping down, getting more and more frustrated and angry with each attempt.\n\nNtikuma laughed when he saw what Anansi was doing. \"Why don't you tie the pot behind you, then you will be able to grip the tree?\" he suggested.\n\nAnansi was so annoyed by his failed attempts and the realization that his child was right that he let the pot slip. It smashed and all the wisdom fell out. Just at this moment, a storm arrived and the rain washed the wisdom into the stream. It was taken out to sea and spread all around the world so that there is now a little of it in everyone.\n\nThough Anansi chased his son home through the rain, he was reconciled to the loss, for, he says: \"What is the use of all that wisdom if a young child still needs to put you right?\"\n\nAnansi shares similarities with the trickster figure of Br'er Rabbit, who originated from the folklore of the Bantu-speaking peoples of south and central Africa. Enslaved Africans brought the Br'er Rabbit tales to the New World, which, like the Anansi stories, depict a physically small and vulnerable creature using his cunning intelligence to prevail over larger animals. However, although Br'er Rabbit stories are told in the Caribbean, especially in the French-speaking islands (where he is named “Compair Lapin”), he is predominantly an African-American folk hero. The rabbit as a trickster is also in Akan versions as well and a Bantu origin doesn't have to be the main source, at least for the Caribbean where the Akan people are more dominant than in the U.S. His tales entered the mainstream through the work of the American journalist Joel Chandler Harris, who wrote several collections of Uncle Remus stories between 1870 and 1906.\n\nOne of the times Anansi himself was tricked was when he tried to fight a tar baby after trying to steal food, but became stuck to it instead. It is a tale well known from a version involving Br'er Rabbit, found in the Uncle Remus stories and adapted and used in the 1946 live-action/animated Walt Disney movie \"Song of the South\". These were derived from African-American folktales in the Southern United States, that had part of their origin in African folktales preserved in oral storytelling by African Americans. Elements of the African Anansi tale were combined by African-American storytellers with elements from Native American tales, such as the Cherokee story of the \"Tar Wolf\", which had a similar theme, but often had a trickster rabbit as a protagonist. The Native American trickster rabbit appears to have resonated with African-American story-tellers and was adopted as a cognate of the Anansi character with which they were familiar. Other authorities state the widespread existence of similar stories of a rabbit and tar baby throughout indigenous Meso-American and South American cultures. Thus, the tale of Br'er Rabbit and the Tar Baby represents a coming together of two separate folk traditions, American and African, which coincidentally shared a common theme. Most of the other Br'er Rabbit stories originated with Cherokee or Algonquin myths. In the USA today, the stories of Br'er Rabbit exist alongside other stories of Aunt Nancy, and of Anansi himself, coming from both the times of slavery and also from the Caribbean and directly from Africa.\n\nIn the Ashanti culture, Anansi is a mere folklore character, like Sasabonsam. Anansi is thus neither a deity nor worshiped as a god contrary to widespread erroneous information. Neither Ashanti oral tradition nor confirmed documentary evidence, list Anansi as a deity.\n\nAs a mythological figure, he is often depicted interacting with the Supreme Being and other deities who frequently, bestow him with temporary supernatural powers. For example, in some popular tales, transmitted through oral tradition, Anansi is temporarily bestowed with powers to bring rain or to have other duties performed for him. \n\nAnansi's family include his long-suffering wife Okonore Yaa; Ntikuma his firstborn son; Tikelenkelen, his big-headed son; Nankonhwea, his son with a spindly neck and spindly legs and Afudohwedohwe his pot-bellied son. In modern mythology, Efua Sutherland introduces Anansewa as the beautiful daughter of Anansi for whom he devises a crafty plot to find an appropriate suitor.\n\n\nIn an arc of DC Comics' \" Justice League of America\", the team faces Anansi. The character was first mentioned in \"Justice League of America\" No. 23, but was not named until \"Justice League of America\" #24. According to Vixen, he is the West African trickster god and \"owns all stories\". Anansi appears in several forms, the most common form being a large, other-worldly spider with supernatural powers. He has been manipulating the powers of Vixen and Animal Man. He initially appears to be villainous, but then reveals after he is \"defeated\" that his machinations were in fact intended to teach Vixen a lesson and prepare her for some coming disaster.\n\nIn the Marvel Comics series \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" volume 2 (2003), it is revealed by Ezekiel that Kwaku Anansi was the first Spider-Man. Anansi sold himself to Nyame the sky-god in return for wisdom, and passed his knowledge on to spiders. In a story of the mini-series \"Spider-Man Fairy Tales\", Spider-Man himself takes on the role of Anansi. He is on a quest to gain more power after feeling unappreciated. After encountering elemental aspects (the Fantastic Four), and a guardian of a sacred garden (Swarm), he realizes the greatest power is friendship.\n\nIn the Marvel comic Herc during the Spider-Island story arc, a man by the name of A. Nancy appears several times as a traveling storyteller. It is revealed that in fact, he is the Spider god of legend, and while Herc has Arachne \"occupied\", he steals Arachne's mythical tapestry that got her bound to her cursed form, adding it to his collection. He then promptly disappears.\n\nAnancy appears in Fables crossover \"Cinderella: Fables Are Forever\" issue 3, where he is shown as a tricker figure and is related to the spider.\n\nAnansi is also a main character in Greg Anderson-Elysée's graphic novel series \"Is'nana: The Were-Spider\". The first volume, \"Forgotten Stories\" was self-published on 2016, after a successful Kickstarter campaign, under the imprint \"Webway Comics\". In the series, Is'nana is Anansi's son.\n\nThe English rock band Skunk Anansie (1994–2001, 2009–present) took the name of the spider man of the West African folk tales, but with a slightly different spelling, and added \"Skunk\" to the name, in order to make the name nastier.\n\nChildren's singer Raffi wrote and recorded the song \"Anansi\" for his 1978 \"Corner Grocery Store\" album. The song describes Anansi as a spider and a man. It tells a story about Anansi being lazy yet clever, using flattery to trick some crows into shaking loose ripe mangoes from his mango tree for Anansi to enjoy without having to pick them himself.\n\n\nIn the PC game \"Shivers\", Anansi appears in a music box that tells the tale of the spider tricking a lizard and the gods.\n\nIn \"Pandora's Box\", Anansi is one of the tricksters that has to be captured.\n\nIn The Secret World, Anansi is one of the eight divisions of the Orochi group, a global corporation whose units are frequently encountered in the game. Anansi's sphere is personal technology like tablets and headsets.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2843306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2843306", "title": "Arale Norimaki", "text": "Arale Norimaki\n\nToriyama claimed that when he told his editor, Kazuhiko Torishima, that he wanted to make a manga about a doctor, Torishima told him to add a robot. Toriyama originally wanted a very large robot, but as it would not fit in the panels, he instead made it small. When his editor rejected that idea, he made the robot a girl knowing Torishima would find her \"cute.\" He also stated that Senbei was supposed to be the main character, but his editor told him to make it Arale instead, which Toriyama agrees turned out better. Torishima later elaborated on this, saying that Arale was initially only a guest character for one chapter. However, because he really liked Toriyama's girl characters the editor wanted her to be the main character. The artist felt differently because \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" is aimed at boys. The two made a bet; Toriyama created a special issue with a female lead, and whoever's story took higher in the magazine's reader poll would win. Torishima won, but because he is stubborn, Toriyama refused to change the \"Dr. Slump\" name.\n\nToriyama purposefully gives his protagonists plain appearances as he prefers to focus on the story. He believes that having weak-looking characters turn out to actually be strong is more interesting; Arale and Son Goku are prime examples of this.\n\nLike the names of many other characters, Arale is a pun on the name for a bite-sized rice cracker (arare), and with the family name (\"Norimaki Arale\") it refers to a sort of arare wrapped with nori seaweed. Initially, her glasses were just a gag, with Toriyama wanting to remove them as they made her more difficult to draw. However, they became a trademark of Arale's and readers who had to wear glasses wrote him saying that by Arale having them it made them feel better about themselves, so he ended up keeping them. Arale is usually shown with purple hair, although it is dark brown in the 1997 anime.\n\nArale poses as Senbei's sister or daughter, depending on who Senbei is talking to. The Norimaki family only grows from there when Arale and Senbei discover an egg when traveling to the past. The egg hatches into a small winged creature that they nickname Gatchan. Then Senbei marries the girl of his dreams (Midori Yamabuki) and they have a son named Turbo. As if the house was not full enough, Gatchan inexplicably splits into two separate entities.\n\nThe \"Dr. Slump\" series is a self-proclaimed gag manga with no ongoing plot. The entire series is about Arale's humorous exploration of the dynamics of life and the adventures Senbei and his inventions send them on. Arale has unique phrases she often uses, such as , , to express bewilderment, and yelling when she runs with her hands out.\n\nArale appears in Toriyama's \"Dragon Ball\" when Son Goku chases General Blue all the way to Penguin Village, she then defeats Blue with one kick and one headbutt after he paralyzes Goku. She is also able to ride on the Kinto'un, which indicates her as being pure of heart. In the anime adaptations, Arale is first seen in a picture on the wall of the capsule house Bulma creates in \"Dragon Ball\" episode 2, again on the television that Kame-Sennin is watching in episode 16, and on a poster in Son Gohan's bedroom in \"Dragon Ball Z\". She also appears in \"\" film, and her face was shown in the . Arale has appeared twice in \"Dragon Ball Super\", first making a brief cameo appearance in episode 43 and later playing a key role in episode 69.\n\nArale is also a playable character in the crossover video games \"Jump Super Stars\" and \"Jump Ultimate Stars\", both for the Nintendo DS, and \"J-Stars Victory Vs\" for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita. She is also playable in several \"Dragon Ball\" video games, including \"\", \"\" and \"\".\n\nIn 2014, two commercials featuring \"Dr. Slump\" were created by Toei Animation for Suzuki. The commercials advertise the car manufacturer's Kei SUV Hustler and include new acting from Mami Koyama as Arale and Kumiko Nishihara as Gatchan. In 2016, Ayami Nakajo portrayed Arale in a commercial for G.u. clothing. It shows Akane Kimidori (Yuki Uchida) and Peasuke Soramame (Kengo Kora) bewildered when Arale trades in her trademark overalls for a pleaded skirt.\n\nArale is voiced by Mami Koyama in the first \"Dr. Slump\" anime, \"Dragon Ball\" and \"Dragon Ball Super\". She is voiced by Taeko Kawata in the second \"Dr. Slump\" anime and by Yuko Hara, keyboardist of the popular rock band Southern All Stars, in the radio drama. In Harmony Gold's English-language dub pilot episode for the first anime, she is voiced by Julie Maddalena. During her appearance in \"Dragon Ball\", Linda Young voices Arale for Funimation's English dub. She is voiced by Brina Palencia in the English version of \"Dragon Ball\" video games and \"Dragon Ball Super\".\n\nIn 1982, Arale came in 12th place in \"Animage\"s fourth annual Anime Grand Prix for Favorite Character. Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network wrote that among \"Dr. Slump\"s cast, Arale is the standout; \"The way she laughs and runs and raises unwitting hell are all unforgettable.\" Her role in \"Dragon Ball Super\" was praised by Sam Leach from ANN due to how she clashes with the protagonists Goku and Vegeta; the latter often breaking the fourth wall stating they cannot defeat a person from a gag series.\n\nWhen asked in 1987 who would win if Arale and Son Goku were to fight, Toriyama said Arale was stronger. Masashi Kishimoto, creator of \"Naruto\", gained an interest in drawing during his childhood from drawing pictures of Arale.\n\nIn 1985's \"My Lucky Stars\", Jackie Chan's character appears in an Arale costume while working undercover in a theme park.\n\nJapanese comedian Hōsei Yamasaki dressed up as Arale, doing her signature \"Kiiin\" and \"N'cha\" for \"Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!\" Cosplay Bus Tour series. Because of failing to complete his task (getting spaghetti for the entire cast) he then had to fly to Italy to get Spaghetti for the entire cast and crew, dressed as Arale all the way.\n\nThe 2004 episode \"Bogus Booty\" of \"Samurai Champloo\" has a scene where Mugen impersonates Arale's signature run by sticking his arms out and making the sound \"Kiin\".\n\nAn episode of \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" featured a video with a cutout of Arale that people could stick their head through, only to have it fall down.\n\nKorean mixed martial artist Seo Hee Ham is nicknamed \"Arale-chan\" in Japan due to her appearance outside of the ring bearing resemblance to the fictional character.\n"}
{"id": "1248379", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1248379", "title": "Argentine rock", "text": "Argentine rock\n\nArgentine rock (known locally as rock nacional, Spanish for \"national rock\") is rock music composed or performed by Argentine bands or artists mostly in Spanish.\n\n\"Argentine rock\" began recycling hits of English-language rock & roll. However a rising trend of composing new songs mostly in Spanish can be traced at late 1960s, when several garage groups and aspiring musicians began composing songs and lyrics that related to local social and musical themes. Since then, Argentine rock started a continued and uninterrupted evolution through the 1970s and into the 1980s, being widely considered one of the most prolific and successful forms of Rock en Español, and one of the most important non-English language forms of rock music in the world.\nIn Argentina it is known as \"Rock Nacional\" (\"/rok.nasjo'nal/\"), literally National Rock (\"national\" here meaning \"local\", \"not international\").\n\nA distinguishing trait of Argentine rock is its insistence on Spanish language lyrics. It's rare for an Argentine rock band to sing in a foreign language as is common in other countries (except to convey a sense of artistic freedom, or in an attempt to isolate their message or aesthetic). Argentine rock today is a blanket term describing a number of rock styles and sub-cultures within Argentina.\n\nRock and Roll music emerged in the United States from a Rhythm & Blues base, gaining international popularity in the 1950s with artists like Elvis Presley and Bill Haley (who visited Argentina in 1958), awakening the interest of several Argentine artists. The most notable among Argentine garage bands which sprung up in this period was Sandro y Los de Fuego, who recorded a successful series of Spanish language covers of American rock and roll hits, and attained commercial popularity. Sandro would soon embark on his own contemporary pop standards career that would make him popular internationally.\n\nThe first few years of rock music in Argentina were confined to cover bands. In 1964, Argentina, like much of the rest of the world, was shaken by The Beatles phenomenon.\n\nThere was a development unique to Argentina which may help to explain, in retrospect, why the country would become a very important rock music-producing nation. Historians describe a parallel pattern of development with the United States in certain aspects of culture. Both countries were the destination for millions of Europeans, and their musical heritage were heavily influenced by Pan-European folk and traditional marches. These similar musical infusions yielded related results in both: a grass-roots rural guitar-based musical tradition, becoming Bluegrass and Country in the US, in Argentina \"Folklore\" and Pampas music. Country music is an important pillar of Rock & Roll. In Argentina \"folklore\" (at that time Nueva canción was sweeping Argentina), was increasingly crossing over to popular musical trends by the late 1950s.\n\nBy 1965, rock music was developing rapidly in Argentina. On television, several shows such as \"Ritmo y Juventud\" and \"El Club del Clan\", with singers like Palito Ortega, Violeta Rivas, Chico Navarro, and Lalo Fransen, featured a poppy version of rock, which owed equal amounts to Merseybeat and to Argentine and Italian romantic pop.\n\nBut it was in the underground where the most influential figures of early Argentine rock would emerge. In former Jazz bars like \"La Cueva\" or \"La Perla del Once\", bohemians like Moris, Pajarito Zaguri, Javier Martinez - drummer and lead singer in the most known Argentine blues band Manal - Miguel Abuelo, and Tanguito would gather in the lazy days of mid-1960s Argentina to exchange ideas. Los Beatnicks, of which Moris and Martinez where members, began the transition that would slowly take Argentine rock from imitation to a more creative state (while still following UK trends mainly). Forming in quiet beaches of Villa Gesell, they recorded the first Spanish language single in 1966 called \"Rebelde\".\n\nThe definitive breakthrough of Spanish-language, original material rock would be up to the band Los Gatos. After playing in \"La Cueva\" for a few months (and members of the band being arrested on a regular basis by police, for political reasons), the band released two singles in 1967. \"La Balsa\", a sunny track vaguely reminiscent of The Doors, co-written by Tanguito and Litto Nebbia, sold 200,000 copies. The following year saw the first publication of \"Pinap\", a rock magazine, and the founding of the first Argentine rock label, Mandioca. In 1969, four major concerts of so-called \"música beat\" (\"beat music\") were held: the \"June Sunday\" concerts, \"Festival Nacional de Música Beat\", \"Festival Pinap\" and \"Festival de Música Joven\".\nIn the wake of Los Gatos, an explosion of bands emerged including Luis Alberto Spinetta's Almendra, the most influential band of the late 1960s, and Manal, the first successful blues-oriented group in Spanish. The three are considered the founders of the Argentine rock movement. None of these groups would have an extended history: in fact most disbanded by the early 1970s. The early Argentine rock scene was characterised by a lot of line-up changes in bands, and even member swapping between bands, or members of different bands meeting and forming new groups. However, the shuffles provided for a lot of experimentation and creativity.\n\nAlmendra would split with Spinetta forming Pescado Rabioso, and the remaining members forming Color Humano and Aquelarre. Spinetta's album Artaud (incorrectly credited to the-then disbanded Pescado Rabioso due to his record label contract) it is widely considered the greatest Argentine rock album of all time. By 1970, Vox Dei and their unique mixture of hard nosed rock with subtle melodious undertones refreshed the movement. Their album \"La Biblia\" (The Bible) is one of the seminal works of the early 1970s, even getting an unusual stamp of approval by the Catholic Church. In that same year, the first B.A (Buenos Aires) Rock festival would be the first showcase of a rising subgenre that would dominate the first half of 1970s Argentine rock. A new group of musicians was to bring new ideas to the mixing bowl of early Argentine rock.\n\nThat the original creators of the movement were now passing the torch to another batch of bands and musicians was a historically enormous development: it would set Argentine rock apart. While in other countries the original wave in the wake of the US or British rock invasions never sustained itself completely and quieted down, in Argentina not only did it continue, it evolved into its own realm and style more independent from rock music of the United States or Britain. From 1965, Argentine rock, with a solid line of ascent and evolution, became the most important rock movement in the Spanish-speaking world.\n\nBy the turn of the decade the first real diversification in Argentine rock began taking place. In reality, the split had been brewing even before, as some bands began playing much heavier music, with the world of rock entering the Heavy metal era. Among them, Pescado Rabioso, Vox Dei, and Billy Bond y La Pesada del Rock. But out of all of the heavy rock bands, Pappo's Blues would become the most influential heavy metal band and blues artist of its era in Argentina, and also acclaimed overseas (even playing with B.B. King in New York City). Another important but overlooked heavy rock act of the period is El Reloj, but they would drift towards progressive rock in the following years.\n\nConversely, the first B.A Rock festival (now promoted by Pinap magazine successor Revista Pelo), had many of the artists and bands that would lead the Acoustic rock movement: Gustavo Santaolalla forming Arco Iris, León Gieco's folk-rock hybrid, Sui Generis and the start of Charly García's music career, Raul Porchetto, and Pedro y Pablo, among other bands. These groups not only turned to Argentine folk for inspiration, they began experimenting with South American musical styles as well; their lyrics becoming increasingly poetic with concerns about nature and the human condition.\n\nThe proliferation of these bands and their increasing popularity, the early 1970s being the height of the hippie movement in Argentina, led to the Acusticazo of 1972. Several acoustic rock bands would gain popularity from their performances there, including Vivencia, Pastoral, and Alma y Vida. The behemothic success of the Acusticazo was a turning point, Argentine rock would enter a new era of increased greater appeal.\n\nIn that year also, Tanguito was killed when he was hit by a train. Conspiracies about his death abound, including that he committed suicide and even that he was thrown onto the tracks by police. A heavy user of drugs, others contend he simply might have tripped. The 1993 motion picture \"Tango Feroz\" (\"Wild Tango\"), would tell the life of Tanguito to new generations and the movie was an international hit.\n\nAs the 1970s progressed, acoustic rock continued as the most popular style in the country, with the above-mentioned and other bands dominating the charts and musical tastes. And for the first time in its history, Argentine rock began spreading overseas: Sui Generis and Pastoral attained some popularity with counter-culture hippies in Latin America, and even Japan (Pastoral had an EP edited there). But a major shift was at hand.\n\nSui Generis began shifting from their classic acoustic rock to a more electric and visceral sound. Also, stirring in the Argentine underground were new bands with a radically different sound from either acoustic or heavy rock: influenced by some of acoustic rock's more experimental works (such as Arco Iris and their phenomenal \"Agitor Lucens V\" with its world music influences), by Tango music and also by British progressive rock. This would be the blueprint of Argentine progressive rock that would bloom into the apex of the movement in 1975. As that year began few could foresee what a watershed it would become not just in Argentine rock history, but the country's too.\n\nCharly García and Nito Mestre decided it was time to quit Sui Generis, almost as if they felt the winds of change. And so their final two concerts at the Luna Park Arena took place on September 5 of that year, the most important acoustic rock band saying good-bye to 30,000 people. Historians have come to see the Sui Generis farewell concerts as the end of the 'Classic' Argentine rock era. Acoustic rock was passing into history: bands dissolved, changed their sound, and those that remained lost popularity and became only cult followings. Argentine progressive rock was on the rise, and so was the political repression to freedoms of expression. Also, several bands would leave the country for greener pastures in Europe, mostly Spain, among them Moris and Aquelarre.\n\nThe Classic era of Argentine rock music was completely over by 1976. As this year began, Argentine rock became far more sophisticated, grandiose, and conceptual. A few acoustic bands would continue having moderate success, including Pastoral, and Nito Mestre y Los Desconocidos de Siempre. But it was the beginning of the period of symphonic and progressive rock dominance.\n\nAs early as 1973, the band Contraluz combined rock with progressive and folk tinges. They would be an influential group in the years leading to the rise of symphonic and Argentine progressive rock. It would create some of the most enjoyable and brilliant albums in the history of the music, acclaimed nationally and by progressive rock fans worldwide.\n\nPerhaps the first major act of symphonic/progressive was Crucis. Their music began attracting attention in the underground, and so they started getting bigger performing venues. As change swept Argentine rock in 1975, their music was rapidly rising to popular musical tastes. Their compositions were strong and dynamic with surprising breaks, and the interplay between the electric guitar (often spectacular wah-wah) and keyboards captivating. The rhythm-section sounded powerful and adventurous.\n\nEspíritu, who formed in 1973 but had roots since 1969, would go on to be an internationally followed group in the latter part of symphonic rock's heyday. The first album \"Crisalida\" is cited as their best effort, with beautiful and alternating compositions and changing atmospheres (from mellow with acoustic guitar to up-tempo with heavy electric guitar), lush keyboards and some vocal harmonies.\n\nFormer heavy rockers El Reloj turned to prog with 1975's self-titled album. Their sound has been compared to Uriah Heep's mystic and proggy sound.\n\nA symphonic band that would have a great year in 1976 was ALAS. Their music was even more intellectual and unorthodox. ALAS would feature artists such as Rodolfo Mederos and Pedro Aznar. Luis Alberto Spinetta would begin his third band Invisible later in that year. Their symphonic sound tinged with tango would bring critical praise. A band that showed a lot of promise that never materialised was Reino de Munt. Formed by Raul Porchetto, it featured a young Alejandro Lerner, and musicians like Gustavo Basterrica and Frank Ojsterseck.\n\nCharly García formed his first post-Sui Generis band, La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros, which began Garcia's explorations of symphonic and progressive rock. Other symphonic and progressive bands of renown would be Torax, Ave Rock, Anacrusa, and Materia Gris.\n\nArco Iris meanwhile continued expanding on their symphonic-folk rock and were joined by veteran Chilean band Los Jaivas, whom were escaping the Pinochet dictatorship that had come to power in their nation in 1973. The two along with Contraluz were the main exponent of the subgenre.\n\nOn March 24, 1976, the democratic government was toppled by a military coup. It opened one of the darkest political chapters in Argentina's history, full of repression, fear, and missing citizens. Argentine rock by no means would be immune to the military crackdown, and would suffer the worst period of censorship in its history. Rock was seen as subversive by the nation's authority figures, who began to clamp down on the music. In a 1976 speech, Admiral Emilio Massera denounced rock musicians and fans as potential subversives and repression of them began in 1977. Before the end of the decade, rock had gone increasingly underground.\n\nIn spite of this however, the music would continue its development against the odds. Along with the plethora of symphonic/progressive bands, heavies Vox Dei and Pappo's Blues continued to sustain their popularity during the period. Yet another heavy metal band, Plus, made their debut in '76 and enjoyed success through the end of the decade.\n\nArgentine rock continued its symphonic, so-called 'concert hall' sound through the end of the decade. The '78-'79 period was not the most prolific period for rock, as the progressive bands continued with their blueprint, and symphonic rock bands actually turned slightly commercial.\n\nAt the height of symphonic rock, Crucis was joined at the top by the popularity of Espíritu; the two are generally seen as the most well-known outfits of the symphonic rock period. La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros efforts were impressive as well, their first album featuring many of the elements of good prog: intricate ensemble work, good individual performances, great melodies, dynamic contrast, and interesting arrangements.\n\n1977 was a year of separation and endings: Crucis would disband at the end of the year. In heavy metal, Pappo's blues would see their nearly seven-year run end. Aquelarre would return from their Spanish stint, but following a tour run went their separate ways.\n\nBut the year would show a glimpse at the future: a band from La Plata called Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota, with their comical costumes and nervy fast tempos, started performing. 1977 was a year of one-year wonders: Soluna (Gustavo Santaolalla's 2nd group), with their electric folk, and Orion's Beethoven, a progressive band that played since 1969 but had their moment of fame eight years later. Neither band sustained their popularity into 1978. Bubu with their album \"Anabelas\" was 1978's one-year wonder.\n\nAnd even more bands ceased to be. After two successful albums that featured several would-be classics of the era, La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros hung up, as did Invisible, leaving as a legacy three of the greatest albums in Argentine rock's history: \"Invisible\", \"Durazno Sangrando\" and \"Jardin de los Presentes\". Pastoral, one of the last acoustic groups still successful, split by 1978, as did ALAS. With the country gripped by World Cup mania (Argentina was host in 1978), and the disco craze, rock music suffered the worst drought since its inception. The media was openly calling out 'the death' of Argentine rock.\n\nThroughout its history, Argentine rock had the strange fortune to get exactly what in needed at the right time, fuelling an even greater expansion in the music. Sandro y los del fuego in '63 with their Argentine rockabilly igniting inspiration; the Uruguayan Invasion of 1965 that proved the commercial viability of non-US or UK bands; the massive hit of \"La balsa\" by Los Gatos in '67 showing Spanish language rock could be appealing to the masses; the \"Acusticazo\" of '72. In the drought days of 1978, what Argentine rock needed was its first successful 'supergroup'. It got it in Serú Girán.\n\nIn 1977 Charly García got together with his friend David Lebón, an ex member of Luis Alberto Spinetta's famous band Pescado Rabioso, to write songs in Brazil. There Charly re-encountered Oscar Moro, the drummer of his former band \"La Máquina De Hacer Pájaros\" and they decided to invite him to help compose new material. The trio soon decided that instead of selling their songs like they had originally planned, they would play them themselves in a new band. Now all they needed was a bass player. Pedro Aznar was a lesser known bassist who had once been a member of progressive rock group \"ALAS\". He also happened to be a friend of Moro's, who knew of Aznar's ability with the funk and jazz bass. Moro brought Aznar into the group and they began to prepare themselves.\n\nCharly, Moro, Lebón, and Aznar managed two major things with Serú Girán. The first was to create a sound that was truly distinctive from anything in English-language rock. The second was their ability to massively achieve popularity in the lower and upper classes with their style of rock. Serú Girán could be 'brainy' yet unpretentious rockers simultaneously.\n\nPartly because the group lived for three months in northeast Brazil, the band's first album shows clear influences of Brazilian music, mixed with symphonic rock and jazz. But the band's first live concert to support the album created one of the strangest anecdotes in Argentine rock: the fans did not understand the strange costumes the band used (entirely in white except for Garcia with a black jacket and shoes); and then when they played the song \"Disco Shock\", a satire poking fun at disco music (which was at its height in 1978), people thought they were really serious. Whistles and boos would follow and what should have been a great concert turned into a fiasco, with fans clamoring for Sui Generis songs. People failed to get the message and Serú Girán did not get their point across too well either. It would all fuel wild speculations about the members' sexual orientations, a PR nightmare at the time.\n\nBut the group bounced back with a vengeance with their 2nd album \"La Grasa de las Capitales\". It was well received by the specialist press, and would cement their status as the most popular band of their time. Serú Girán's third album \"Bicicleta\" (1980) was tepidly received at first, but in time would be considered the band's best work. Both albums departed from the symphonic rock of the first LP, the music turning more visceral and 'simple' with less arrangement and pomp. Serú Girán would not be isolated in this trend, as slowly Argentine rock was writing the final chapters in its symphonic and progressive period.\n\nThe nation was still in the grip of a dictatorship as the 1980s dawned, even as repression had eased somewhat by then. The start of the decade continued to feature Serú Girán, now with their less pretentious sound, at the top of the charts. Vox Dei entered their 3rd decade in rock, a virtual first for any local band, and León Gieco's popularity as a solo artist was on the rise.\n\nOne of the last progressive bands of importance would be Tantor. They were less symphonic and far more prog-experimental, with jazz as a major support. Their first eponymous album was a hit in the scene, and the band would continue till the mid-1980s as one of the last bands of the progressive era.\n\nSerú Girán went touring in Brazil in 1980, where their reception by fans at the Monterrey Jazz Festival in Rio de Janeiro was so overwhelming that the organizers requested that they perform again, the next day, but on the main stage with jazz-rockers Weather Report. There, Pedro Aznar met Pat Metheny, and Aznar gave him some cassettes with his own works. Serú Girán returned home, released \"Bicicleta\" and gathered 60,000 fans in La Rural back in Buenos Aires chanting \"no se banca más\" (\"it isn't bearable anymore\", alluding to the dictatorship). That year they had also performed in concert with Spinetta Jade, Luis Alberto Spinetta's latest project and the other popular rock group of the early 1980s. It was a great event in which both bands eventually played some songs of each other's repertoire.\n\nSpinetta Jade was a blend of jazz and rock that escaped the trappings of symphonic rock, something that was unheard in Argentina at that time. Towards the last two albums, the sound became a little bit more \"pop\", and embedded with electronic elements (samplers and synthesizers with \"artificial\" textures).\n\nSerú Girán released their fourth album \"Peperina\" in 1981 and promoted it on tour, but by the end of the year Pedro Aznar decided to leave the band because he wanted to study at Berklee. (When he was there, by the end of 1982, he was called to join the Pat Metheny Group). Serú Girán (which at the time was even planning tours in Europe), had a strong sendoff on March 6–7, 1982, when they performed for the last time at the Arena Obras Sanitarias. A memorable moment was the performance of the song \"No llores por mi Argentina\" (\"Don't Cry for me Argentina\", which has no relation to the \"Evita\" musical theme); a song full of symbolism. It was not only a farewell for Aznar, and for Serú Girán, but for an era in Argentine music, and history. The timing was beyond befitting.\n\nArgentina's economy was in full recession in 1982, and discontent with the military government was rampant. On April 2, the world would awake yet again in the 20th century to the horror of war. After a season of death and destruction in the South Atlantic in which both sides suffered sunken ships, aircraft blown from the sky, and hundreds of young lives were cut short, the United Kingdom regained control over the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas). The popularity of the Argentine military government hit then bottom, and democratic elections were called shortly after.\n\nThe war would be a dark chapter in Argentine history, but would have the paradoxical effect of creating one of the most fortuitous circumstances in the history of any rock genre.\n\nIn May of '82 the \"Festival for Latin American Solidarity\" brought together all the great bands of Argentine rock. It was a festival in support of the troops overseas, and also a veiled protest to war, and a call for peace (at first the musicians feared appearing for risk of being portrayed pro-war). This event was the final stepping stone of Argentine rock in becoming \"the\" dominant form of music in the country. At the same time, English-language rock was wiped out from radio play. The programmers had to fill the voids with something, and that was with Argentine rock. This created the opportunity of exposure to countless underground bands. It would set the foundations for the explosion of rock in the mid-1980s.\n\nIn the latter days of symphonic rock, a great number of new groups started popping\nseemingly out of nowhere. In reality, these were bands influenced by post-punk, new wave from the US and Britain, and by the more symphonic and less progressive side of Argentine rock. Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota, who had started in 1977, were growing a larger following on a monthly basis. In 1979 in La Plata, Federico Moura would form a pioneering new wave band called Virus. In Buenos Aires, three young men influenced by the advent of post-punk in Britain started exchanging ideas, and decided to form a band with the name Soda Stereo.\n\nIn 1980 friends who were enthralled by the wave of US and UK punk formed the band Los Violadores. Miguel Abuelo, a founding figure of Argentine rock in the 1960s, would return after a decade in Europe and form Los Abuelos de la Nada, which happened to feature a young man by the name of Andres Calamaro. Someone named Miguel Mateos, after talking to Freddie Mercury, won the opportunity to open for Queen in Buenos Aires with his new band ZAS. At the local pubs in Mendoza a pop-rock act called Los Enanitos Verdes appeared. An Italian of Scottish background named Luca Prodan arrived in Argentina to fight his heroin addiction, worsened by the death of his friend Ian Curtis of Joy Division. Prodan would form Sumo. This band, one of the least conventional in Argentina at the time, and since, has been voted Best Argentine Band by a poll composed by rock journalists in 2009. Despite its 'underground' status, it has fervent followers in Chile, Uruguay, Mexico and a plethora of countries worldwide.\n\nFrom the \"Festival of Latin American Solidarity\" emerged solo artists that would go on to delve into a more adult oriented form of rock and pop music, with the Argentine youngsters of the 1960s now mature adults. Some of these names were Juan Carlos Baglietto (who was optimistic about a young musician from Rosario named Fito Páez), Alejandro Lerner, and Celeste Carballo. In heavy metal, Pappo founded his new band Riff, and newcomers V8 and La Torre would emerge. New witty rock bands like Los Twist, Suéter, and the riot grrrl group Viuda e hijas de Roque Enroll crashed to the scene infusing Argentine rock with needed dosages of humor and self-deprecation. On the gothic side of rock, La Sobrecarga and Euroshima would carry the torch.\n\nAnd for the first time in Argentine rock history there was a \"revival\" of an earlier style, with Acoustic rock making a comeback on the back of reunions by Almendra and Manal. On the other hand, Charly García and Luis Alberto Spinetta embarked on their solo careers. Moris returned from his period in Spain.\n\nMeanwhile, Argentina entered a new era with the inauguration of Raúl Alfonsín as president of a fully democratic nation. Rock bands would no longer be harassed and even censored by the powers-that-be, and freedom of expression flowered. Songs critical of the military that were in prior years censored, some with exquisite lyrical poetry and allegory, were released during this time: \"Tiempos Dificiles\" by Fito Páez (sung by Juan Carlos Baglietto), \"Maribel se Durmió\" by Luis Alberto Spinetta, \"Sólo le pido a Dios\" by León Gieco and \"Los dinosaurios\" by Charly García. A more direct criticism of the military government that ended in 1983 came from the Argentine punk groups like Los Violadores (singing songs like \"Represión\") or seminal heavy metal bands like V8.\n\nFinally, segments of Argentine rock moved away from the concert hall and 'solemn' era, full of very heavy lyrics and concerns with domestic issues. It started to lighten up and turn more irreverent, and to focus on mundane concerns such as money, love, and sports. This would make the music and lyrics far more accessible (and commercial) to international audiences.\n\nThe stage was set for the boom of Argentine rock in Latin America and beyond.\n\nThe \"Cafe Einstein\" was opened in 1982 by Omar Chaban (who would end up convicted for the República Cromañón nightclub fire 22 years later), featuring some of the first presentations of three underground bands: Sumo, Soda Stereo, and Los Twist. Both Sumo and Soda Stereo featured slightly different line-ups in their early days, with Sumo having an English girl, Stephanie Nuttal, on drums. She returned to England when war broke out between her country and Argentina. Also in '82 Charly García released his full-album solo debut, the acclaimed \"Yendo de la Cama al Living\".\n\n\"One could feel the winds of change\" in 1983 Argentina. A cliché perhaps, but at no time more appropriately used. Everything was optimism about the future, the country, and music. Even technology cooperated with the palpable change: it was the year the compact disc was introduced. And 1984 was the year of female rock: Patricia Sosa and her heavy rock band La Torre were voted best band of the year and \"Solo quiero Rock and Roll\" best single, a first for a female lead rock act. Another female-fronted band, Los Twist, and their superbly catchy tunes about nothing were also doing very well, but the group suffered a blow when Fabiana Cantilo left.\n\nAs the early 1980s progressed it became clear that the new generation of rockers were not like anything before: Los Violadores pioneering punk in Latin America; Virus oxygenating rock with their new-wave sound, followed by Cosméticos with a similar style ; Sumo's punkish reggae-rock developing a fanatical cult following (Luca Prodan sung mostly in English, which reduced his band's radio exposure yet their fame expanded unabated); and Soda Stereo the buzz of the underground. ZAS introduced the phrase \"rock en tu idioma\" (rock in your language). Los Abuelos de la Nada and newcomers G.I.T. found quick success outside Argentina, a preview of things to come.\n\nBy 1985, year in which Los Fabulosos Cadillacs formed, several bands began receiving consistent airplay across Latin America. Argentine rock began \"climbing\" the continent up the Andes: first Chile, then Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela. Zeta Bosio of Soda Stereo said of this: \"We would leave Argentina and tour in Chile, Peru, etc, and in some places they had never heard a live rock concert before... they said that such music was for another world and wouldn’t work... now it's all joy seeing how it did work and that it now has its own legs...\" Argentine rock bands were the first to be signed to multinational record labels for distribution across many nations.\n\nThe trickle became a flood as 1986 approached, and by the start of that year it had become a continental phenomenon, reaching Central America, Mexico, and crossing the Atlantic to Spain, even as far Italy, France, and Germany. Los Enanitos Verdes with their energetic pop-rock that appealed through music lines gained previously unseen popularity across borders. The Cadillacs, with their ska-rock with a heavy Latin infusion, turned instant rock stars across Latin America and eventually worldwide. Rata Blanca, a heavy metal band formed in 1987 from the ashes of influential early 1980s rockers V8, also conquered the Spanish-speaking world. As did Charly García, Fito Páez, and now solo artist Miguel Mateos. 1986 was the climax of an unprecedented wave of international success for Argentine rock.\n\nIt would help to revitalize rock movements in other Latin American countries for two reasons: 1) It would create a buzz and excitement in the local rock scenes; 2) it proved to producers and record labels in those countries that \"Rock en Español\" could work and make them money. In Mexico, Argentine bands were being marketed by media giants like Televisa as \"rock in your language\". Its success changed the landscape of the Mexican scene: it laid the groundwork for Mexican rock in Spanish to itself expand overseas. In Peru, the Argentine invasion was a catalyst that brought that country's own movement more to the mainstream. In Chile, where a few outstanding bands existed even prior to the Argentine boom (see Los Prisioneros), the flood of rock music coming from their eastern neighbor would fully energize and inspire the local scene, and Argentine rock's influence continues to this day. The current boom in Colombian rock can be traced to the 1980s, with most Colombian rock acts citing the Argentine invasion groups as a direct influence. In countries like Paraguay, Uruguay, and Bolivia, the effects were even more profound.\n\nAs 1988 began, with the most important Argentine bands (Soda Stereo, Los Fabulosos Cadillacs, Los Enanitos Verdes, Rata Blanca, Charly García, Andres Calamaro, Miguel Mateos, Sumo, Virus) on constant tour of Latin America, Europe, and even countries in Asia, the globalization of Argentine rock and pop was complete. By this time the invasion had begun to 'quiet' down in comparison to the prior three years, but its legacy of opening the doors of Argentine rock to massive success beyond its own borders remains to this day.\n\nSoda Stereo was one of the most successful and influential rock band in Spanish ever. The influence of Soda Stereo and its music, style, and even 'business acumen' is undeniable. They were also the first Spanish-language band to use all aspects of their popularity to the fullest: their music videos, aesthetic, philosophy, and more. In the beginning they were deeply influenced by new wave and bands such as The Police, Television, and Talking Heads, and by symphonic rockers Luis Alberto Spinetta and Aquelarre.\n\nWith their first album, the self-titled \"Soda Stereo\" (1984), they reached national success with joyful and ironic lyrics, and a sound that combined pop, reggae, ska, and new wave, but were accused of being superficial and frivolous. The second album, \"Nada Personal\", strengthened the popularity of the band, with instant classics such as \"Nada Personal\" and \"Cuando Pase el Temblor\" opening the doors of the Latin American market; 1986's \"Signos\" would heavily increase their popularity and in 1988 they came up with what could arguably be called their masterpiece, their album \"Doble Vida\". The musical arrangements and the lyrics reached a subtlety never heard before from the band's production, the most notable example being the album's lead single \"En La Ciudad De La Furia\", a cryptically metaphorical ode to the band's hometown of Buenos Aires and the city's inhabitants. They embarked in an extensive tour through Latin America that brought the live album \"Ruido Blanco\".\n\nWith the tour supporting \"Signos\", Soda Stereo became international superstars. The band would continue their worldwide success well into the 1990s, and evolving their musical sounds unlike almost any other Rock en Español band. In fact, they would lead the way in the changes Argentine rock would experience as the 1990s drew near.\n\nThe year 1987 ended in tragedy for Argentine rock. Luca Prodan had finally lost his personal battle with alcohol and was found dead on December 22, due to complications from his addiction. His death was a shock to the entire music industry and to millions of heartbroken fans. Following Prodan's death, the members of Sumo split, founding two new rock outfits: Divididos and Las Pelotas; both bands became major players of 1990s rock.\n\nMiguel Abuelo, following gallbladder surgery, was diagnosed with AIDS; terminally ill, he died from cardiac arrest on March 26, 1988. Virus leader Federico Moura's persistent pneumonia fueled rumors of further complications, which ended in the revelation soon after by the singer that he was infected with AIDS. Moura died on December 21, 1988. Moura's passing completed a dreadful trifecta of musicians who had still much to offer. It was a tough blow for rock. As a group, Virus survived and soldiered on into the 1990s as a more adult pop-rock outfit than the outrageous yet influential 1980s band that helped define the sound of \"techno-pop\".\n\nThree major trends defined the Argentine rock of the end of the 1980s. The first trend was the consolidation of the Argentine Invasion bands into somewhat more mature rock groups. Some began to experiment with world music in the last two years of the 1980s. For example, Charly García got together with his old Serú Girán partner Pedro Aznar and recorded \"Tango\", whose name accurately suggests the style of the album. Before Federico Moura's death, Virus had also begun turning to Brazilian music for their album \"Superficies de Placer\". In general the mood of the music got darker echoing a deteriorated economic climate.\n\nA second was the rise of \"Tropical\" rock, and the explosion of local Reggae bands in Argentina seemingly out of nowhere in 1987. While Argentine rock was triumphant internationally, Argentina was caught in a reggae-mania: in the summer of that year arose Los Pericos, Los Cafres, La Zimbabwe, and Jafran, among many other smaller outfits. But it was a fad, and only Los Pericos would sustain and grow their careers once the fancy faded (Los Cafres would be mildly successful starting in 1994).\nA band that was not a fad was Los Auténticos Decadentes, who would become a hugely popular ska-Latin pop and ballad group. They along with Los Pericos and Los Fabulosos Cadillacs would be leaders in the tropical rock scene of ska, reggae and Latin music.\n\nThe third trend came about partly as a result of the first: many rock fans did not approve of the commercialism and experimentation of the A-bands, and increasingly looked underground for a more confrontational guitar-led rock. Among them: Todos Tus Muertos, Don Cornelio y La Zona (later Los Visitantes), Los Brujos, Babasónicos, Los Siete Delfines, Massacre Palestina. All of them would be part of the\" \"Nuevo Rock\"\" (\"New Rock\") explosion of the early 1990s.\n\nIn heavy metal, the already mentioned Rata Blanca dominated popular tastes, specially in other Latin American countries, along with Hermética, JAF, and Horcas (the last two more domestic), in a very healthy scene for a style that never was overwhelmingly crowded in Argentine rock. An important band in the metal underground was Nepal, one of the pioneering bands of thrash metal. Formed in 1984, they were part of the first generation of worldwide thrashers, and gained prominence as the decade ended and musical tastes turned approbatory for more extreme metal. The genre got many magazines committed solely to it and distributed nationwide: Madhouse, Metal, Riff Raff, Revista Epopeya, etc.\n\nThe end of the 1980s were also a period of continued growth for Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota, on their way to becoming one of the most mythic cult bands of broad popularity in the history of rock, anywhere. It was also the time when Los Ratones Paranoicos were gaining followers with the burgeoning \"rolingas\" (followers of a subgenre of Argentine rock that is greatly indebted to the Rolling Stones). On the pop side Man Ray with their tailor-made FM songs were ubiquitous. Finally, Divididos and their guitar-crunching melodic noise was more and more becoming a preview of what the next decade would bring. In general, as the fantastic 1980s for Argentine rock closed, the music was in period of transition and exploration at all levels.\n\nSoda Stereo's frontman Gustavo Cerati could foresee the musical trends, putting his own band in front of it. After releasing the increasingly hard rocking \"Doble Vida\", the band headed to studio with new producer Daniel Melero to record their fifth album, \"Canción Animal\". It was released in October 1990, about a year before Nirvana released \"Nevermind\".\n\n\"Canción Animal\" confirmed that it was OK to return Argentine rock to an 'in your face', edgy attitude that shaped the Argentine Invasion aesthetic in the early years of the 1980s, but this time with electric guitars as the stars. From that album, the single \"De Música Ligera\", might well be the most recognizable Spanish-language rock single of all time, and also one of the most covered by bands all over Latin America and elsewhere. \"Canción Animal\" helped underground acts like Los Brujos, Peligrosos Gorriones, and Massacre break faster into the mainstream, by taking guitar-crunching rock to the apex as 1991 began. Even pop-bound groups like Los Enanitos Verdes rocked harder in their early 1990s works, particularly in their \"Big Bang\" album, whose single \"Lamento Boliviano\" is now a classic.\n\nThese and other bands in their wake would be dubbed the \"Nuevo Rock Argentino\", or New Argentine Rock. A term that not long after would also be used as an umbrella to group bands with a hard-to-pin-down style, like the neo-surf pop of Super Ratones (from Mar del Plata), and neo-fusionists La Portuaria with their world music touches. \"Nuevo Rock\" would be the dominant form of rock in Argentina until the middle of the decade when it lost ground to so-called \"rock suburbano\".\n\nIn 1992, Soda Stereo presented \"Dynamo\", their sixth album, arguably the most conceptual (the other being \"Signos\"), and the most experimental to that point. It apparently took fans by surprise, and was the lowest seller of the group's works (it didn't help that in the middle of all this the band changed labels; Sony wouldn’t promote a band that was leaving, and BMG wouldn't promote another label's album).\n\nOn the other hand, Babasónicos had in 1992 their first major breakthrough of their careers with the hit \"D-generación\" from their 1992 album Pasto, which would herald future international success for a band that would define the sound of \"sonic\" rock. Juana La Loca was another band in the so-called sonic scene that started in the early 1990s and would breakthrough a few years later. The band that founded the Sonic Movement in Buenos Aires was Iguana Lovers, started in 1990. Now with collaborations of the shoegaze British indie Ride members, Mark Gardener and Loz Colbert, they were positioned as the most important new band of the Buenos Aires indie scene in 1991. Los Brujos would have a great year 1992; the single \"Kanishka\" was an instant chart-topper. Los Visitantes equalled the success of Los Brujos the next year with their album \"Salud Universal\", an offbeat mix of guitar rock and tango tinges. Todos Tus Muertos was a punk response to the Argentine rock being made in the late 1980s, consciously choosing to be far more direct and explicit in their musical (and political) statements. The band gained rapid acclaim with the rise of New Rock, and were one of the favorite bands of the period. Slowly the group would evolve from their early punk to a more diverse style that include afro-Latin rhythms.\n\nThe odd-group out that appeared in the early 1990s was the outrageously named Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas (a reference to Colombian footballer Carlos Valderrama). More rappers than rockers, the group nonetheless made a mark in the rock scene as time progressed and they were able to more successfully integrate rap with Argentine rock, and also Latin rhythms. One of the members, Dante, is the son of Luis Alberto Spinetta.\n\nAs New Rock was dominant, some acts in the distant suburbs of Buenos Aires where playing straightforward and guitar centered rock music, with a foundation in the blues, and an unsophisticated image (somewhat a counter-movement to the image conscious, musically more pretentious New Rock).\n\nSome of these suburban acts owed so much to the sound of the Rolling Stones, that their followers came to be known as \"rolingas\". Eventually the rock rolinga (a.k.a. rock stone) became a style: cheesy 1970s sneakers, tight T-shirts with the logo of the Stones or a local 'stone' band, and a disdain for other Argentine rock subgenres they consider part of the establishment. At the forefront of this movement were Los Ratones Paranoicos, whom for years before were perfecting a musical formula that would be emulated by countless neighborhood bands in years to come. They were joined in the Rolinga scene by Viejas Locas in the mid 1990s.\n\nThe incessant touring of the rolinga bands around the suburbs of Buenos Aires and other cities would reap benefits not only for themselves but for other suburban groups that would follow soon after. Thus, Rolinga rock arguably became the most popular music genre in Argentina in the 1990s.\n\nThe last decade of the twentieth century was a very productive one for this style of rock in Argentina. There had always been \"heavy\" bands: Billy Bond y la Pesada del Rock in the 1960s, Pescado Rabioso and Pappo's Blues in the 1970s, V8, Riff (Argentine band), and several underground metal acts in the 1980s. But they had never been at the forefront of Argentine rock, seemingly always obscured by other genres whether it was acoustic, symphonic, progressive, or the 1980s invasion bands. This changed in the 1990s.\n\nAs the decade started Rata Blanca, Horcas, Hermética and J.A.F had very respectable careers. Rata Blanca was internationally approved: in fact, it is plausible to state that their classic metal sound was more popular outside Argentina than within. Internationally popular to a lesser extent was Hermética, the arch-rivals of Rata Blanca (both formed in 1987 when V8 disbanded), but there were no doubts of their massive following at home. Horcas and J.A.F stayed mostly successful in the local medium, though nonetheless had some overseas exposure.\n\nThe major development in Argentine metal of the 1990s was the rise of A.N.I.M.A.L.. The acronym translated literally stands for \"Abused (accosted), Our Indians Died While Fighting\". And their themes lived up to that title: the band would be one of the most outspoken advocates for indigenous people and even nationalism, while also (as such bands tend to do), blasting against the current world order. Their sound is equal parts hardcore, heavy metal, and thrash. Another important band formed in 1990 was Tren Loco, whom long after went to Japan and won second place in a major battle-of-the-band event at famous Budokan Stadium in Tokyo. The metal underground also flourished in the 1990s, with bands like Alakrán, Jezabel, Jason, Logos, and Jeriko, among others.\n\nSolo artists from the earlier generations were by the 1990s established figures in the medium. The biggest two stars (as had been the case since 1970), were Charly García and Luis Alberto Spinetta. Garcia enjoyed a prolific 1980s with many of his albums turning into classics. Spinetta had a more uneven body of work but nonetheless was successful. Pappo continued putting out blues and heavy rock records, Miguel Mateos remained a popular rock figure in Latin America even as he dropped almost off the radar in Argentina. León Gieco's unique \"folk-rock meets world music\" approaches made him an internationally acclaimed musician.\n\nFito Páez's pop career continued to take-off in the early 1990s. In 1992 he released \"El Amor después del Amor\", becoming the best selling Argentine rock album. The title \"love after love\" was not by chance: he had just ended a well-publicized relationship with female rocker Fabiana Cantilo (herself an important 1990s singer in the movement), and was getting involved with movie actress Cecilia Roth. With the album Paez was confirmed an international pop star. Meanwhile, Andrés Calamaro had enjoyed some popularity since his solo career begun, but never managed a complete breakthrough with the public. He left for Spain, and there met two local musicians forming Los Rodriguez in 1991. Two years later the hit single \"Sin Documentos\" finally gave Calamaro an international hit, and the band gained overnight vogue in Spain and Latin America.\n\nTropical, Fusion, and Latin influenced rock continued its ascent. 1992 was the year of \"La Pachanga\": Rosario's Vilma Palma e Vampiros single was an across the board mega hit in the Spanish-speaking world; there was no way of escaping it unless one did not have any kind of social life in the early 1990s.\nBands like Los Auténticos Decadentes, who had a major hit in 1990 with \"Loco (tu forma de ser)\", and Los Pericos mirrored the tendency of increased popularity for the subgenre. Los Fabulosos Cadillacs had a slump in the early 1990s after harvesting great accolades in the late 1980s, but came back with a roar in 1994 with \"Vasos Vacios\"; the compilation that featured \"Matador\". The single would turn into a global superhit, winning MTV's best video of the year. The early 1990s were also the formative years of a group that would have an impact towards the new millennium: Bersuit Vergarabat. La Mosca would begin tapping into the tropical and Latin trend by 1995.\n\nArgentine punk-revival took off in the 1990s. Los Violadores had ruled 1980s punk; them along with the foreign punk bands of yesteryear would inspire the members of Attaque 77 and Flema. Formed in 1986 and 1987 respectively, they were pioneers of the worldwide punk revival movement. Attaque 77's breakthrough came in 1990 with the single \"Hacelo por Mi\"; Flema never broke to the mainstream but were heroic figures of the punk underground. Both groups paved the way for dozens of followers. One of those were 2 Minutos, with their pure-energy, extreme, back-to-basics punk rock. Another darling of the scene were Todos Tus Muertos, perhaps one of few bands in any punk movement that was accepted for their various rock styles \"besides\" punk. Fun People took punk's liberal philosophy to another level by tackling the punk-scene itself: many of their lyrics criticized the macho attitudes in the movement which they saw contradictory to the spirit of punk. They were also the first band that sang in Spanglish, meanwhile another bands, like Drop Dead! Argentina used to do it only in English. The She Devils were the leaders of the local queercore scene. Cienfuegos, a punk band that had existed since the 1980s but suffered various contingencies, finally would produce albums by the mid 1990s.\n\n\"See:\" Argentine punk\n\nIn the Argentine northwest, important punk and indie scenes developed in the mid-to-late nineties. Bands like 448, Volstead, Estacion Experimental and led the scenes.\n\nIn the middle years of the 1990s a rift developed in Argentine rock that would, with only slight wrinkles, endure to present times.\n\nBy 1995 \"nuevo rock argentino\" or Argentine new rock had lost steam. For starters, bands like Los Siete Delfines and Peligrosos Gorriones, with their more artistic antics, fell out of favor. At the same time, groups like Massacre and La Portuaria went on recording hiatuses and would not return until more favorable winds in the early to mid-2000s. Los Brujos disbanded in 1998 after eight years of solid productions, but it left a large void in the movement. One of the last \"hurrahs\" of new rock were rap-rockers Actitud Maria Marta, which had a year of fame in 1995. Babasónicos, Todos Tus Muertos, and Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas were some of the new rock bands that were able to maintain their level as the year 2000 approached.\n\nAlso, 1995 would see the last album by Soda Stereo, their relaxed almost chillout-like \"Sueño Stereo\", an album at times more electronic than rock previewing the direction of Gustavo Cerati's solo career. Soda Stereo would go on a last grand tour through the United States and Latin America, selling out entire stadiums as they went. Their last concert in Buenos Aires in 1997 was released as a double-album, with 70,000 people selling out twice at the Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti. The arguably greatest band in Argentine and Rock en Español history wrapped up the concert and their career with the live version of \"\"De Musica Ligera\";\", Gustavo Cerati, the vocalist, guitarist and leader of the band, would end the song thanking his public, and would finish this gratitude by saying \"... Gracias totales\" (total thanks), this would become an iconic phrase for the band and Argentine rock thereafter.\n\nConversely, \"rolinga\" rock was on the up. On the one hand were the 1980s bands that by the mid 1990s approached the suburban rock sound: Redonditos de Ricota, Divididos, Las Pelotas. They were joined by two bands that would define suburban in the late 1990s as well: Los Piojos and La Renga. La Renga is also considered one of the \"Rolinga\" groups (followers of the Rolling Stones blueprint) like Los Ratones Paranoicos and Viejas Locas, whose weighty followings would only grow larger.\n\nArgentine youth began to musically and socially gravitate to either the suburban rock groups or towards the underground. And even within these two major groupings there were subdivisions (\"rolinga\" and \"post-chabón\" in suburban rock; \"sonico, punk, dark\" in the underground). Then there were the heavy metal followers, the large and expanding indie scene, and the tropical rock followers, genre increasingly intermixed with the fledgling Cumbia which would explode in the new millennium. The pieces were in place for the current period of rock in Argentina.\nOn a completely different, and original level, Andrea Prodan (Luca Prodan's brother) emerged with a bizarre and unique all-vocal, solo album called \"Viva Voce\", recorded on independent label Silly Records. The record won an A.C.E. award and was among Peter Gabriel's favourite records in his Real World list of 1996.\n\nThe late 1990s charts were dominated by the success of bands like Los Piojos, La Renga, Divididos, Redonditos de Ricota, Las Pelotas, Los Ratones Paranoicos, La Mancha de Rolando, Caballeros de la Quema, and many more suburban rock bands. They were joined by Uruguayans No Te Va Gustar and La Vela Puerca, giving rise to the term \"rioplatense\" rock (rock from the Río de la Plata region) to label all of the similarly inclined outfits. Rolinga rock has created many fine singles and albums, but critics argue many of the bands (specially second rate groups in the \"rolinga\" scene), simply repeated the same formula to sell albums. Another feature of rolinga rock is that it tends to shun overseas success: whether this is a conscious attitude or a simple limitation of the genre is an ongoing debate.\n\nOn the other hand, the likes of Divididos, Los Piojos, and Redonditos have transcended its constraints and become influential in Argentine rock and popular on an international level. The better bands in the genre also feature an unusual versatility with non-rock styles like tango, folk, African music, Latin, jazz, and even North American country music, each with their own eclectic mixture. It would help elevate them from the legions of imitators in the crowded suburban scene. Divididos 6th album \"Narigon Del Siglo\" (2000) was one of the first great Argentine rock albums of the new decade; it was peppered with folk.\n\nThe underground was more under than usual in the late 1990s, it was nonetheless extremely creative. A style that gained some mainstream exposure was \"rock sónico\" (\"sonic\" rock), influenced by the 1980s \"techno-pop\" of Virus and early Soda Stereo (and also Britpop), through Babasónicos and Juana La Loca. The latter group found success with sonic rock in 1997's \"Vida Modelo\". The former would increase their popularity with each new album, arriving at 2001's \"Jessico\", which received international acclaim as one of the first truly outstanding albums of the new millennium. Other underground groups started making noise at this time: Iguana Lovers, they founded the Sonic movement in Buenos Aires in 1990, El Otro Yo, Catupecu Machu, and Santos Inocentes, leaders-to-be of the early 2000s alternative rock scene in Argentina. Super Ratones's returned to the alternative charts with 2001's Grammy nominee \"Mancha Registrada\".\n\nIn heavy metal, Hermética disbanded by 1995 giving rise to Almafuerte. With a more up-to-date sound, they were one of the late 1990s favorites along with A.N.I.M.A.L.. Rata Blanca continued to perform and record intermittently touring countries around Latin America. Classic metalists O'Connor in the underground would emerge by the early 2000s, along with exponents of nu metal Cabezones and Carajo. One of the most critically acclaimed bands of present is Los Natas. Originally a stoner rock group, in subsequent albums the band has turned more experimental. Some have called this demiurgic style (infused with Argentine folk, psychedelia, and space rock)\" \"Patagonian doom\"\", and this brand of metal has been ranked with the best heard in the new millennium. The band itself prefers to call it \"free\" rock.\n\nIn punk, Attaque 77 were still going strong, as did Fun People (including a European tour), until their disbanding in 2000. The punk underground of the late 1990s was buzzing with new bands (Cadena Perpetua, Expulsados), many of them to guide the early 2000s melodic punk scene (Smitten (band), Shaila).\n\nIn tropical or fusion rock, Bersuit Vergarabat rose to the zenith of the genre. \"Libertinaje\" (1998) catapulted the band to the top, and to tours of the Americas and Europe. The follow-up \"Hijos del Culo\" (2000) also went double-platinum. Both albums display a dizzying range in style versatility. From the side of reggae-rock Los Pericos and Los Cafres dominated. Ska had Los Calzones and Kapanga, but by 2000 Los Fabulosos Cadillacs had called it quits to their internationally renowned career of rock with ska, rap, reggae, and Latin. La Mosca and Dancing Mood reached achieved greater popularity. Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas produced some catchy, original, and danceable music (a mix of rock, hip-hop, and Latin) which cemented their fan base all over the Americas, until the duo's separation in 2001.\n\nA highly talented and promising band was Karamelo Santo, another contribution of the city of Mendoza (also home of Los Enanitos Verdes). They featured a very refreshing mix of rock, punk, ska, afro-Uruguayan, and cumbia rhythms that earned them critical praise in Argentina. They would spend most of the 2001–2004 period on extensive tours of Europe and the Americas. Todos Tus Muertos would break up at the height of their popularity in 1999.\n\nTo a lesser extent dance and electronica music, which in Argentina have the largest scenes in Latin America, also influenced Argentine rock of the 2000s. A good example of this is the internationally prominent techno-pop act Miranda!, a band that owes as much to current dance and electronica as the 1980s techno-pop of Virus and Los Encargados, electronic pioneers in Argentina.\n\nAs with any evolving musical movement, it's hard to define the state of the scene in question. Its final anthology will not be written until 10 to 20 years in the future. But in general terms, Argentine rock in the middle of the 2000s decade can be said to showcase the following trends:\n\n\n\n"}

The \"line\" in \"below-the-line\" refers to the separation of production costs between script and story writers, producers, directors, actors, and casting (\"above the-line\") and the rest of the crew, or production team.\n\nThe top sheet of any creative project's budget serves only as an at-a-glance reference to a fully detailed and attached main budget document, which features total expenses including federal, state and local taxes, as well as insurance within the entire production, and or production incentives. This painstaking task is usually assigned to the Production Manager or UPM of a production and should be completed before principal photography begins for any project.\n\nSome below-the-line film and television film crews operate in pre-production, production, or post-production stages of filmmaking. For example, the film editor may work solely in the post-production stage of filming but he/she might also work throughout the production, editing the film as it is shot and advising the director if and when additional shots or scenes are needed. The boom operator on the other hand is mostly on set during filming because he or she has to pick up the dialogue of the actors as well as ambient noise when the scene is being recorded.\n\nThis particular type of film crew usually belongs to a guild or union. Some of the unions and/or guilds that represent below-the-line crew include: I.A.T.S.E., The International Cinematographer's Guild (an IATSE organization), The Teamsters, Motion Picture Editors Guild, Animation Guild, and the Motion Picture Sound Editors.\n\nIt is usually the case for the \"below-the-line\" crew to work for hourly wages, as opposed to a set wage, or negotiated contractual wage on the front, or back end of any given project. \nThese set workers are responsible for a number of many other unsung, and demanding tasks that must be completed to achieve the common goal of creating a film, or television program. These positions could be considered \"less glamorous\", and the unmentionable part of filmmaking. However, many dedicated and hard working individuals have made a good living with \"below-the-line\" job positions, whether it's in independent filmmaking, and or for a major film studio. \n\nWithin the many entry-level positions available to gain knowledge of the industry, such as Lighting technicians, grips, wranglers, stunt performers, property masters, ADR, foley, set painters or any stagehand etc., one could gain knowledge and skill of these, and many other key positions within the film industry.\nMany schools and or nonprofit organizations are set up to train the youth and other interested individuals to better prepare and teach a trade that may not otherwise be available within the traditional school system. These organizations teach about film and video terminology, equipment, and life skills, a must for today's highly completive entertainment market.\n\nBelow-the-line crew refers to everybody else including:\nMost of these crafts people are considered variable cost in the budget. Meaning, if you cut a scene from the script, potentially, you don't have to build that set, or paint it or dress it, etc.\n\n"}

Wiliam Miller's family immigrated to the United States when William was a year old first settling in Brooklyn and then Jersey City. His father worked as a building tradesman. He does not know his family's original surname. He has one sister, Mollie Miller Vine. He dropped out of high school after two years to pursue a career as a vaudeville dancer as part of the duo \"Miller and Peterson.\" He danced professionally until he was 30 after which he worked as a vaudeville agent. In 1945, he purchased the Riviera, a nightclub overlooking the Hudson River in Fort Lee, New Jersey which had closed during World War II, and renamed it Bill Miller's Riviera. He booked many of the top acts at the time including Tony Martin, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis, Sammy Davis Jr., Joey Bishop, Mae West, and Tito Puente. In 1953, the Riveria was shuttered to make way for the Palisades Parkway.\n\nIn the same year, Miller purchased a 10% interest in the Sahara and moved to Las Vegas at the invitation of Milton Prell (who founded the Sahara in 1952), becoming its entertainment director. Starting afresh, as many of his former acts had already been taken to Las Vegas by former Copacabana Club employee, Jack Entratter, he hired Ray Bolger, Donald O'Conner, and Marlene Dietrich. He also pioneered the Las Vegas lounge show concept booking Louis Prima, Keely Smith, and Sam Butera. In 1955, he left the Sahara and bought an interest in the new Dunes where he again worked as their entertainment director. At the Dunes, he developed the first of the big Las Vegas production \"feathershows\" named \"Smart Affairs\" and later developed burlesque shows \"Lido de Paris\" and the \"Folies Bergere\" with his former producer in New Jersey, Donn Arden. He operated a hotel in the Dutch West Indies before returning to Las Vegas where he served as the entertainment director of the Flamingo founded by Kirk Kerkorian where he helped to launch the career of Sonny and Cher with Phil Spector. In 1969, he worked at Kerkorian's new hotel The International where he booked Barbara Striesand and revived the career of Elvis Presley. The International became the world's largest resort hotel during his tenure. He retired in the 1970s.\n\nMiller married four times. He was survived by his fourth wife, Denise B. Miller. He had three children, record producer and musician Jimmy Miller (who predeceased him in the 1990s and was previously married to Australian television personality, actress and singer Kerri-Anne Wright), New York Times reporter Judith Miller (married to editor Jason Epstein), and Susan Miller; and a stepson, Jerry Johnson.

It does not follow on directly from where \"BloodRayne\" finished; instead, it takes place 60 and 70 years later in a contemporary 2000s setting.\n\nThe FMV opens with a flashback set shortly after the first game. Rayne is seen entering a library (called Blood Library), with a few Nazis inside. She finds that Brimstone members have been slaughtered and realizes her vampiric father Kagan is here, acting as an influential Nazi. Rayne rushes to confront him for revenge for her mother's rape and the murder of her family, and Kagan mocks Rayne by saying he doesn't recognize her, as he sired numerous offspring that way. He finds what he was looking for, called the Vesper Shard. Knowing Rayne still wants to kill him, he then brings Professor Trumain up from the floor, strangled by his own small intestine, but barely alive. Kagan knows that they know each other, and that Trumain \"stole\" yet another offspring from him. While Kagan mocks Rayne, Truman pulls out a detonator, first giving time for Rayne to run, then detonating the grenade, killing himself and seemingly taking Kagan with him.\n\nDenied the pleasure of killing him herself, Rayne spends the 60 years after the war seeking out and destroying Kagan's offspring. These offspring, Rayne's half-siblings, have banded together to form a group called the Cult of Kagan. The Cult has created the Shroud, a substance that can render sun rays harmless to vampires, allowing them to surface at all times of the day, and which twists nature into a nightmarish perversion (trees dying almost instantly, grass catching on fire, corpses twitching). Using the Shroud, the Cult has pledged to create a new era of vampiric supremacy, continuing Kagan's legacy.\n\nRayne and her ally Severinfind high ranking members of the Cult, who are responsible for hundreds of disappearances in a city. Rayne learns of their plot and defeats her ambitious half-sister Ferrill, the apparent leader of the cult. It's soon revealed that Kagan himself has long survived over the years and has come out of hiding. After Kagan has Ferrill dispatched, he sets about the plot to activate the Shroud, blocking out the sun and setting loose an army of vampires and demonic entities to destroy the city, making it his kingdom. Rayne again sets her sights on killing Kagan.\n\nWith Kagan's army having taken over the city, Rayne seeks out his tower to face him once and for all, fighting his army to get to him. A vengeful Ferrill makes an army of her own to usurp Kagan. After Rayne dispatches the last of her half-siblings, she confronts Kagan in his throne room, with Kagan mocking her one last time about the effort he took to create her. A fight ensues and Rayne decapitates her father, avenging her family.\n\nDespite Kagan's death, the vampires still plague the city, and Severin suggests that Rayne should run it now. Brimestone declares martial law to rescue the surviving humans, cracking down hard on all vampires and more vampire overlords setting their sights on the city.\n\n\"BloodRayne 2\" received mostly mixed to positive reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Xbox version 73.06% and 71/100, the PlayStation 2 version 71.33% and 70/100 and the PC version 69.71% and 67/100.\n"}

Established in 1959, the collection contains costumes and props from famous clowns, as well as a reference library, and is home to the Clown Egg Register, an archive of painted ceramic and hen's eggs which serve as a record of individual clowns' personal make-up designs. The egg gallery was created because according to an unofficial rule, no two clowns are allowed to have the same make-up. In order to ensure that clowns weren’t copying each other’s makeup style, the practice of painting each unique design onto an egg began. Real eggs were originally used, but were later replaced with ceramic eggs. The gallery opens on the first Friday of each month. The collection is split between the museum's two sites.\n\nThe museum was established in 1959 in Dalston and the collection was split to a venue in Wookey Hole in 2007.

The show is a tribute to the art of dance, and the music is a collection of mostly American songs, many with a dance theme, from a wide variety of styles, from operetta to jazz to classical to marches to pop.\n\n\"Dancin\"' opened on Broadway at the Broadhurst Theatre on March 27, 1978. It then transferred to the Ambassador Theatre and ran for 1,774 performances (including previews). Additional choreography was by Christopher Chadman. \n\nAfter the success of the dance-intensive \"A Chorus Line\", Fosse proposed a show with little dialogue and singing. Fosse's concept for the show was to use classical and show music, popular music, rock and roll, Mozart, Bach, George M. Cohan, and contemporary music by Neil Diamond and Melissa Manchester, anything \"except\" a new score written by a collaborator. He stated publicly that the project would free him from the burden of an artistic partnership: \"When you have collaborators, you have all those midnight meetings. I'm tired of those...So I just decided to meet myself at midnight.\" Fosse invited choreographer Graciela Daniele to contribute a few numbers, but she declined, saying \"When you are out of ideas, call me. I have the feeling that once you get into it, you're going to want to do it all.\" Despite the lack of creative partners, Fosse still had to negotiate with his co-producer Bernard Jacobs, the president of The Shubert Organization, who objected to Fosse's risqué number depicting a tourist coping with New York City's then-notoriously seamy Times Square. The show's remaining numbers impressed audiences, and because Fosse co-produced the show, it became his biggest financial success in the theatre.\n\nThe show's choreography was so demanding, however, that small theatre companies were unable to effectively recreate it, and so the show has not been revived. However, several numbers from \"Dancin\"' were recreated for the 1999 dance review \"Fosse\", including: \"Crunchy Granola Suite\", \"I Wanna Be a Dancin' Man\", \"Big Noise from Winnetka\", \"Mr. Bojangles\", and \"Sing Sing Sing\". \n\nA revival was scheduled to be produced by the Roundabout Theatre Company at Studio 54 for 2009, but this had been postponed until the 2009–10 season, and was again postponed indefinitely.\n\n\n\nIn his \"New York Times\" review, Richard Eder writes the show is designed to be a musical show — there is no story line. He states that Ann Reinking is clearly the star and she is at her best in the high point of the evening, \"Benny's Number\", which recreates Benny Goodman and his band using \"Sing, Sing, Sing\". He also mentions several other dances, such as \"Dancin' Man\", with the entire cast dressed in \"ice-cream\" suits and lavender shirts; and \"Fourteen Feet\", where the shoes are nailed to the floor, and the dancers proceed to move within those confines. He sums up by writing \"precision and style mark the evening at its best\", but they serve very little.\n\nClive Barnes, newly moved to the \"New York Post\", told Fosse that he thought the show was \"tremendous\" and \"fantastic\".\n\nDancin' ran for a Limited Season in 1983 at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in Westminster, London. \n\n"}
{"id": "974664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=974664", "title": "Digital on-screen graphic", "text": "Digital on-screen graphic\n\nA digital on-screen graphic (originally known as digitally originated graphic, and known in the UK and New Zealand by the acronym DOG; in the US, Canada, Ireland and Australia as a bug or network bug) is a watermark-like station logo that most television broadcasters overlay over a portion of the screen area of their programs to identify the channel. They are thus a form of permanent visual station identification, increasing brand recognition and asserting ownership of the video signal. In some cases, the graphic also shows the name of the current program. Some television networks use an on-screen graphic to advertise upcoming programs (usually programs scheduled later the same day, but also for \"significant\" upcoming programs as much as a week in advance).\n\nThe graphic identifies the source of programming, even if it has been time-shifted—that is, recorded to videotape, DVD, or a digital personal video recorder such as TiVo. Many of these technologies allow viewers to skip or omit traditional between-programming station identification; thus the use of a DOG enables the station or network to enforce brand identification even when standard commercials are skipped.\n\nDOG watermarking also helps minimize off-the-air copyright infringement (for example, the distribution of a current series' episodes on DVD): the watermarked content is easily differentiated from \"official\" DVD releases, and can help law-enforcement efforts by identifying not only the station an illegally copied broadcast was captured from, but usually the actual date of the broadcast as well.\n\nGraphics may be used to identify if the correct subscription is being used for a type of venue. For example, showing Sky Sports within a pub requires a more expensive subscription; a channel authorized under this subscription adds a pint glass graphic to the bottom of the screen for inspectors to see. The graphic changes at certain times, making it harder to counterfeit. \n\nMany news broadcasters also place a clock alongside their bug. In the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, DOGs may also include the show's parental guideline rating. In Australia, this is known as a Program Return Graphic (PRG). It has become common to place text above the station's logo advertising other programs on the network.\n\nIn many countries, some TV networks put \"live\" in the bottom of the DOG to advise viewers that the program is live, as opposed to a repeat.\n\nDuring televised sports events, a DOG may also display a few game-related statistics such as the current score. This has led many people in Canada and the United States to refer to it as a score bug.\n\nArabic TV logos are placed in the top-right and top-left except for Al-Jazeera, whose logo appears on the bottom-right of the screen. Some of the Arabian TV stations hide their logos during commercial breaks and promos/trailers, such as Dubai TV, Dubai One, Funoon, the Egyptian CBC and Nile TV networks, ART Hekayat, ART Hekayat 2, Iqraa and Al-Jazeera.\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s, almost all television stations in Argentina had their logos being shown on the top-right of the screen. When Canal 9 relaunched in 2002 to replace Azul Televisión, its logo was shown on the bottom-left of the screen. After intense criticism, Canal 9 moved its logo to the top-right of the screen of which most Argentine broadcasters had almost always followed.\n\nAustralia first introduced the digital on-screen graphic in the early 1990s. The Seven Network was the first metropolitan network to broadcast digital on-screen graphics on all of their programs, following The Nine Network in mid-to-late 2002 later Network Ten in 2004. DOGs in Australia most commonly appear in the bottom-right hand corner of the screen, but sports orientated content that uses the network's sports brand (e.g. Seven Network and Seven Sport) generally appear on the top-right hand corner of the screen. One originally placed its DOG in the top-right hand corner of the screen due to it being a sports orientated channel at the time, but after the 2011 rebrand to allow a wide range of content to be broadcast, the channel's DOG was moved to the bottom-right hand corner of the screen. The ABC3 and ABC Kids channels originally placed their DOGs in the top-left hand corner of the screen, but have since moved them down to the bottom-right hand corner as of late 2013. Datacasting channels and home shopping channels show their DOGs in the top-right hand corner of the screen.\n\nDOGs are generally shown in a semi-transparent format, but are shown opaque during in-programme advertisements that take place at the very bottom of the screen. News services have their own DOGs placed where their network's DOG would normally be, but are only shown in an opaque format. News services generally show footage that was captured by another network (usually for sporting stories), but the semi-transparent DOG of the original network is still shown. Current affairs programmes and other news programmes that are produced by the network generally show their own opaque DOG at the bottom-left hand corner of the screen, opposite to their network's semi-transparent DOG which still appears (e.g. Nine Network and A Current Affair).\n\nAustralian TV networks hide all of their DOGs during advertisement breaks. They only reappear during the promotion for a programme that will be shown on the station and are not shown during any other advertisement material.\n\nAt times, networks will superimpose a semi-transparent watermark immediately adjacent to their DOG to advertise an upcoming special event that the network will be broadcasting (e.g. Network Ten superimposed an advertisement for the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics on their primary channel (Ten), 10 Boss, and 10 Peach as they were to be the Australian broadcaster of the event), or to advertise a popular upcoming programme.\n\nIn addition, during ABC's ABC News Breakfast, Seven's Sunrise and 10 Peach's Toasted TV (except Weekends), a digital clock appears on the bottom right-hand corner of the screen while Nine's Today Show and Ten's Studio 10 appears on the bottom left-hand corner of the screen.\n\nCurrently now ABC, Seven, Nine and Ten are on the bottom-right hand corner while SBS is on the top-right hand corner.\n\nORF, the Austrian public broadcasting agency, introduced digital on-screen graphics in 1992 on both television channels operated back then. Before, only the abbreviation \"ORF\" was shown randomly for several minutes during the programming in the top right corner of the screen, styled in a simple white sans-serif typeface. Nowadays, all Austrian television channels, both public and private, are required by law to display a digital on-screen graphic continuously in order to enable channel identification. However, during commercial and continuity breaks, it is forbidden to show digital on-screen graphics, to allow a further distinction between paid commercials or station announcements and programming content.\n\nThe position on the screen varies between the top left and the top right corner: for instance, public broadcaster ORF shows the digital on-screen graphics on ORF eins (first channel) in the top left corner, on ORF 2 (second channel) in the top right corner and on ORF III (third channel) again in the top left corner. Commercial broadcaster ATV places the graphic in the top right corner on its main channel and in the top left corner on its additional channel ATV II. Most other commercial channels show their digital on-screen graphics in the top right corner of the screen.\n\nIn Brazil, digital on-screen graphics were introduced in the mid-1990s and are always used by all channels (free and pay). In most free-to-air channels, the logos are located on the bottom-right hand corner of the screen (except for RedeTV!, TV Gazeta, and Rede Bandeirantes, whose logos are placed on the top right corner of the screen, and GloboNews, which is located in the top left corner of the screen (and on the bottom left corner of the screen during reports)) and in all free channels they are usually transparent, but if some program or event is being broadcast live or exclusive or if some archived footage is shown, they become colorful. In some pay channels, the logos appear even in commercial breaks, but they become transparent in this situation.\n\nLogo bugs are used by Canadian broadcasters in a nearly identical fashion to U.S. broadcasters. However, a complication emerges when Canadian broadcasters simulcast U.S. programming (a frequent practice among broadcast television networks, intended to invoke the simultaneous substitution rules requiring TV providers to substitute the feeds of U.S. broadcast channels with those of local, Canadian broadcast channel, if they are airing identically-scheduled programming). While recorded programs can be delivered to the broadcaster by their distributor and played out locally (without depending on taking a feed from a U.S. network), live programs may not always have a clean feed available that is free of the U.S. network's bugs and imaging, necessitating the use of a dirty feed from the network instead.\n\nIn these scenarios, some channels—including, most frequently, CTV and CTV Two, as well as its Bell Media sister channels—covered the U.S. network's bug with their own, opaque logo. However, Bell has since ceased this practice, and the majority of broadcasters \"co-brand\" the dirty feed by placing their own bug in a different corner of the screen than the U.S. logo.\n\nChilean television stations started showing the logos permanently in the 1990s. During that time, logos were placed in the bottom-right of the screen. La Red was the first television broadcaster to move their logo to the top of the screen, in 1997, due to the logo change, the logo was placed at the top-left, and later due to the same reason, moved to the top-right until now. Other broadcasters, such as Mega, which its logo being originally shown on the bottom-left of the screen, moved to the top-right of the screen due to similar reasons; Canal 13, in a similar manner, moved its logo from the bottom-right to the top-right corner in 2002. Chilevisión has continued to have its logo being shown on the bottom-right of the screen until 2007, when it moved to the top-right of the screen, of which other television channels in Chile had followed in the previous years.\n\nTV stations in mainland China always place their logo (usually semi-transparent and sometimes animated) in the top-left corner of the screen in full colour or grey-scale, regardless of the content being broadcast (programme or advertisements); although in some rare cases, the DOG may be placed elsewhere to avoid covering the score bug during the broadcast of a sport event.\n\nNelonen was the first channel in Finland to use the DOG, from its start in June 1997. MTV3 started to use DOG in the beginning of 1998, and Yle introduced DOGs in its two channels in August 1998. The DOGs moved from the top right corner to the top left corner on Yle's channels on 5 March 2012 when the company's new corporate logo was taken into use.\n\nLa Cinq was the first channel in France to use the DOG when it launched in February 1986; it remained on the bottom-right corner until the channel ceased operations in April 1992. After the first private channels launched between 1986 and 1990, DOGs began to be used on the public television channels operated by France Télévisions and TF1, where they were placed on the top-right corner.\n\nCurrently, the DOGs of TF1 and all channels of France Télévisions are placed on the top-right corner, while those of M6 and W9 are placed on the top-left corner. During programming blocks aimed at children, TF1 and international channel TV5 uses another DOG.\n\nIn the 1980s, public broadcasters started to randomly show logos during programs to prevent video piracy, following the lead of Italian broadcasters RAI and Canale 5. After the first private stations emerged in 1984, permanently showing their logo most times, the public broadcasters soon followed.\nToday practically all TV stations show their logo during the programs and often these are an integral part of their design using fluent motion graphic animations to make the transition between programs, previews and advertising, as well as displaying additional information such as teletext numbers or the name of the following program.\nMost logos are transparent during programming though some channels do not. (e.g. kabel eins uses a bright orange coloured logo.)\nAlso the majority of the channels show their logo in either the top-left or top-right corner of the picture though there are exceptions (e.g. RTL II in the bottom-right or N24 logo in the bottom-left and date and time in the top-right).\n\nOn all Greek network television networks, DOGs appear on the top-left hand corner of the screen. Since 1997, almost all television stations in Greece do not remove their logos during advertisement, although in channels such as Skai TV the logo becomes transparent.\n\nHungarian DOGs was first introduced in MTV's channels (TV1, TV2 - not to be confused with the independent channel of the same name) from the late 80's to the early 90's, but it was very rare.\n\nTV2 was the first network to always display its DOG, which was a quarter-circle generated by a video super-imposer connected through the video-casette recorder. It started in 1992 and ceased in 1994.\n\nMost DOGs are semi-transparent, but some including ATV, HírTV, and Echo TV have opaque DOGs.\n\nThese logos may be at any corner of the screen.\n\nAge ratings have been included since 2001 onwards at the bottom of the screen as well as at the start of the program, but some channels dislike the requirement and use a different age rating system instead (mostly the Romanian ones) or none at all.\n\nMany channels hide their logos in commercial breaks, but some (such as the independent TV2 and its sisters) include them during ads.\n\nThe Irish language channel TnaG first used their bug during simulcast of QVC and their coverage of the Oireachtas (Irish Parliament). In 1998 TV3 launch as Ireland's first commercial operator and the first Irish channel to permanently use a bug in the left hand corner of the screen. In 1999 TnaG re-branded as TG4 and began showing their logo during all programmes. In 2002 RTÉ introduced their bug however it would only appear for twenty seconds at the beginning of each show and it was there to classify the suitability of the content of the show, in 2004 the bug became a permanent part of the on screen presentation for both RTÉ One and RTÉ Two. RTÉ's classification guide also appears for twenty seconds at the beginning of each show. RTÉ's, TG4's and Setanta Ireland's bugs appear in the upper right hand corner of the screen, while TV3's bugs appeared in the bottom right hand corner of the screen between the early 2000s and the channel's rebranding as Virgin Media One in August 2018 (when its bug was moved to the top right hand corner). RTÉ does not use their bug during news or current affairs programming. The now-defunct Channel 6 also displayed a bug during its two years on the air. The new digital services from RTÉ also display bugs on RTÉjr, RTÉ Two HD and RTÉ One+1. Bugs are also used to tell viewers when shows are live or when they are replays. RTÉ use the word \"replay\" during repeats of live programming while TV3 advised viewers \"Text & Comment Lines are Closed\", Setanta replaced the word \"Ireland\" with the word \"live\" to advise viewers that they are watching live events rather than repeats and TG4 places the Irish word \"beo\" (live) below the number '4' in their logo during live programming. RTÉ refer to DOGs as \"bugs\". In Northern Ireland UTV began displaying their bug in the late 2000s. All of the community and local channels in Ireland display a bug. All bugs also display 888 for subtitles.\n\nIn Israel, channel watermarks more often appear on the top left or the top right since Israeli cable and satellite based services often have the channel description and programming (OSD) on the bottom of the screen. In ad breaks, it is required to replace the channel watermark with a special symbol - often on the other edge of the screen - indicating there are ads at the moment.\n\nIndonesian TV DOGs have been used since 1983. At that time, TVRI was Indonesia's only television channel. When RCTI began broadcasting in 1989, the DOG began to be used at the same time. The usage of logo differs by channel, appearing in either the top-left hand (for example, channels owned by Media Nusantara Citra such as RCTI, Global TV and MNCTV, as well as Indosiar) or the top-right hand corners (such as SCTV, antv and the channels of Trans Corp like Trans TV and Trans7). Logos of television channels may or may not have moved their logos to the other part of the screen, such as TVRI was the first to move theirs to the bottom-right hand corner in 1999 (the year the network changed its logo, used until 2001), and followed by MetroTV in 2010, while Indosiar's DOGs have been always on the top-left since it began broadcasting in 1995. SCTV, while using the text logo at the start of broadcast, did not began to use their own logo on screen until 1994.\n\nUnlike Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines, since 2004, most Indonesian TV networks never leave their logos during commercial breaks, instead, the logo becomes transparent (before 2004, logos were removed during commercial breaks). For the station identification, the logo will remain on-screen, but sometimes it will disappear prior to the identification.\n\nIn Italy, channel watermark usage is different for every television network. RAI at the end of 1970s, introduced its first watermark, to minimize copyright infringement by private channels. The bug \"jumped\" around the four corners of the image. At the end of 1987, the bug added the number of the station, until 2010 in letters and from 2010 in numbers. \nNowadays RAI logos are always on the top right corner of the screen. On the SD feeds of RAI channels that have an HD feed, the HD channel number is posted below the channel's bug. Mediaset bugs are on the bottom-right from beginning, but during some shows or sport events, they can be moved on the top right. \n\nDOGs are not removed during commercial breaks, with an exception of some channels like Disney Channel.\n\nOn all Japanese network television key stations and their affiliates, DOGs appear on the top-right hand corner of the screen. In addition, during some programs, a digital clock appears on the top-left corner of the screen. The digital clock had been in place on all programs prior to the introduction of DOGs; the first DOGs were introduced in 1999 on the NHK's satellite services, before expanding to terrestrial television with the start of digital broadcasting in that country between 2003 and 2006.\n\nIn Mexico Once TV and XEIMT-TV was the first channels to use their logos permanently in the top-right of the screen since 1997. The channels of Televisa and TV Azteca did not start use logos permanently until 2000 and 2004, respectively, in their channels.\n\nMorocco's TV networks usually display their DOGs permanently, notably the SNRT and 2M TV. The exception to this is Medi 1 TV, as of now being the only Moroccan TV channel so far to hide its DOG during commercial breaks.\n\nNew Zealand introduced the digital on-screen graphics in 2001, starting with TV3 and FOUR. New Zealand FTA now placed their logos on the bottom right hand corner, with the exception of Maori Television and as of 9 February 2017, TV3. TV One had the logo on the top right hand corner until the switch to the bottom right hand corner on 1 July 2013. TV2 usually had the logo from the top right hand corner until New Year's Day 2012 when they switched it to the bottom right hand corner. Prime Television New Zealand now placed their logo on the bottom right hand corner as of March 2016.\n\nGMA Network first introduced DOGs in 1995, as the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board had implemented a television content rating system from November that year. Most stations do not display DOGs during commercial breaks, except Net 25, ETC (since 2012), and some cable channels, which display DOGs all the time. The DOGs can most often be seen in the upper-right corner, aligned with the TV content rating logo, but on several cable channels they are placed in the upper-left or bottom-right corners. Formerly, ABS-CBN removed the DOG and rating 3 minutes before commercial breaks, however from 2000 these are now removed 10 seconds beforehand. ABS-CBN and GMA previously did not use DOGs during their newscasts but started doing so in 2012. ABS-CBN and its sister channel S&A append the word HD to their respective HD feeds' DOGs and place the DOGs outside the 4:3 safe zone.\n\nSatellite pay-TV provider Cignal also appends its DOG to the channels it carries. Hence, those who view channels through Cignal will see its DOG. \n\nThe network logo and the MTRCB rating of the program (green 'G', blue 'PG' and red 'SPG') are shown 1 to 5 seconds after the start of the program. Hashtags, promotions and announcements are also shown in the middle of the program. All DOGs appear in a solid color.\n\nVirtually all Polish TV channels show their logos in the corner of the screen during all programming, and have done so since the early 1990s. The two TVP channels first introduced them as a test in 1991 and then permanently in early 1993. Various positions of the logo were tested, before settling on the top-right corner on 19 April 1993. Polsat, the first commercial Polish-language broadcaster, launched initially on satellite on 5 December 1992, with a DOG in the top-left corner from the beginning.\n\nNowadays, most channels, including the major networks such as TVP, Polsat (since 28 February 2005) and TVN, show their logos in the top-right corner of the screen. Top-left corner is also a common location, used by TTV and several cable and satellite channels. News-oriented channels such as TVP Info and TVN24 that display news tickers at the bottom of the screen most of the time, usually integrate their DOGs in the ticker design, typically in the bottom-left corner. Few minor cable and satellite channels show their logos in the bottom-right corner. Most broadcasters remove their DOGs during commercial breaks, although the practice is not universal. Some channels, including most basic free-to-air ones, use alternate logos containing the \"HD\" branding for their HDTV feeds. This may be related to the fact that Polish digital terrestrial TV lineup consists almost entirely of SDTV streams, with HDTV available through cable and satellite.\n\nSince 15 August 2005, all broadcasters licensed in Poland are also required to display the age rating at all times, during all programming except news, sports and advertising but has been criticised by viewers for exaggeration of age rating to +12 in case of animated or family movies on some TV channels, mainly from TVN and Polsat, and also on talent show with participation of children (e.g. The Voice Kids), for pathologizing of system and for screen burn-in. It is usually shown in the top-left corner, opposite the channel logo. However, Polish broadcasts of international cable networks (such as Discovery Channel, HBO, etc.) usually operate under foreign licenses and are legally treated as rebroadcasts of foreign channels. As such, they don't need to follow this requirement and may use a different rating system instead.\n\nRTP introduced DOGs in the late 1980s, when it was the only broadcaster in Portugal that operated two television channels. Initially, the logos were placed on the top-right corner, but in 1991 they were moved permanently to the top-left corner, to allow television ratings to be shown in the top-right corner. Until 2004 and RTP1's rebranding, their DOGs were placed on the bottom-left corner during newscasts. On some programs or live sport broadcasting, DOGs are placed in the top-right corner. Logos are removed during advertising breaks and trailers. For subtitle information, on RTP1 and RTP2 a number such as 884, 885, 886, 887 or 888 is placed near the logo; in other cases \"Direto\" (Live) is sometimes used instead of a number (some programmes use neither numbers nor \"Direto\" (Live), \"Gravado\" (Recorded) or \"Repetição\" (Repetition)).\n\nDOGs of privately owned channels were introduced in the mid-1990s. Initially, the logo of TVI was placed in the bottom left corner during only some of its programmes; in the mid-2000s the logo was moved into the top left corner, and has been shown across all programmes since then. The two Brazilian-owned television services (Globo and RecordTV Europa) have their DOGs placed in the bottom-right corner.\n\nIn Russia, television channels usually have watermarks, which are usually placed in the top-right or top-left corner of the screen (one notable exception is HTB, which places it logo on the bottom-left corner). In some channels the watermark becomes half-transparent on ad breaks, but on main channels such as Channel One or Russia-1 they never disappear nor become half-transparent. Channel One was the first channel to have introduced their watermark in 1992 and by 1993 watermarks appeared on other channels.\n\nThe Serbian national television RTS began showing logos in the early 1990s. Their logo was sometimes turned on manually during certain broadcasts but shortly afterwards remained permanently on-screen. One could notice how they were manually controlled, as the \"logo-free\" time during the begin of a program varied. Until around 1994–1995 their logos were opaque black and white, presumably due to being inserted into the analog CVBS signal just before being broadcast instead of an analog YUV, RGB or digital SDI signal, while in the mid-1990s they upgraded to colorized but still opaque logos. RTS's predecessor RTB (Radio Television of Belgrade) had DOGs of varying sizes, but rather than being introduced one after another they appear to have been used simultaneously at different broadcast sites. At least three different sizes and styles of their opaque black-and-white logo are known today. On the satellite channel \"RTS-SAT\", Latin letters were used, but after the destruction of RTS headquarters in 1999 during a NATO air strike, it could be noticed how the logo appeared to have been quickly re-drawn and was being inserted by different equipment as it varied in shape and size, presumably because of the original equipment used to insert it being destroyed. Today RTS has the same opaque color logo from 1999 on RTS-SAT and new translucent logos were introduced in the 2000s for the analog terrestrial programs. Old logos remain on most archived recordings presumably due to lack of a cleanfeed archiving policy in the past, as can be seen in the \"Trezor\" historical series: \n\nMost local and regional stations and some national commercial broadcasters (Pink from 2001–present, as of September 2012, when the national news start at 18:30, clock disappears up until the end of its morning program, B92 from 2004 to 2011, Avala from 2007 until 2011) in Serbia along with station logo also show a digital clock below the logo.\n\nSingaporean televisions began showing the channel logos during television programs in 1994. The first one was Channel 5 then, Channel 12 and lastly Channel 8. The television stations show the logo in full-color, and are usually shown in the top right of the screen. Also, since around 2004, logos of Mediacorp television channels also include the parent company's logo, and this expanded in 2005, with Channel U became a part of Mediacorp.\n\nLike its neighbouring country, Malaysia, Singaporean channels remove the channel logos during commercial breaks except for Channel NewsAsia, whose DOG is integrated into the ticker which remains on the screen during breaks.\n\nTVE introduced DOGs in 1985 on TVE1 and TVE2. The DOG of TVE1 was all white until 1991, when the number 1 was changed from white to blue. It remained so until 2003.\n\nAntena 3, Telecinco and Canal+ were the first channels to use DOGs from their launch, with the DOGs placed in the top-left and bottom-left corners. In 1992, Antena 3 and Telecinco repositioned their DOGs in the bottom-right, making it the same as TVE.\n\nTV3, an Autonomical Channel of Catalonia, used DOGs from 1990, earlier shown only alongside clock indents, and from 1994 until 1999, showed DOGs throughout broadcasting. From 1990 the DOG was removed during advertisements. In 1999, the DOG was removed during the clock.\n\nCurrently, almost all channels in Spain use DOGs, with the DOGs are shown in the top or bottom-right of the screen, except 13-TV, Telemadrid, and Disney Channel, that uses DOGs on the top-left and bottom-left, respectively. Most DOGs are removed during advertisements, trade test transmissions or when a program is not aired. An exception to this is Intereconomia. Canal 3/24 did not remove their DOG during advertisements between 2011 and 2014.\n\nThailand introduced DOGs in 1991. Thai TV logos are in full-color, and the logos are removed during commercial breaks, trade test transmissions, transitions between programs and when a Thai Royal Family member is shown during the broadcast. All Thai television stations show the logos in the top-right of the screen.\n\nDuring the mourning period after the death of Bhumibol Adulyadej all television stations aired black-and-white, monochrome DOGs and showed the logo on the bottom-right of the screen for a period of a hundred days until 21 January 2017. After the period ended, all television stations reverted DOGs back to regular color scheme but remained on showing the logo on the bottom-right of the screen (except during foreign sports programming and some foreign series and domestic sports programming on some channels, when television stations still show the logos on the top-right corner of the screen).\n\nIn Turkey, screen graphics, bugs, or DOGs are known as screen badges. On analogue/digital television, screen badges were introduced to TRT1 in 1996 and some private channels had screen badges beginning in the mid-1990s. Beginning January 1, 2000, all television channels at the time had screen badges usually located in the top right hand of the screen. However on January 1, 2010, One got a new theme package and the screen badge was moved down to the bottom right hand of the screen. All of the TRT channels' screen badges were on the bottom right of the screen by the end of 2010.\n\nIn the UK, DOGs most commonly appear in the top-left hand corner on British channels. DOGs were first used on satellite and cable television systems in their early days, when broadcasts were unmarked. Channel 5 was the first to use DOGs on an analogue terrestrial channel in 1997. The DOG was originally very bright and noticeable, and was soon toned down. Channel 5 said that the DOG was used to assist viewers in tuning to the new channel once its test transmissions had ceased. Following the rebrand to \"five\" in 2002 the DOG disappeared until late 2007.\n\nThere have been two known predecessors to the digital on-screen graphic on British television, namely a small white outline rectangle that was broadcast on the screen throughout ITV's broadcast of the documentary \"Life by Misadventure: A Film about the Seriously Burned\" on 7 September 1973 to warn people that may be uncomfortable with its content, and similarly, Channel 4's infamous red triangle symbol, which was applied in the corner of the screen throughout a series of controversial late-night art films broadcast 1986–87, in addition to an ident before the films began, again in both cases to warn viewers of the content.\n\nThe BBC initially introduced a DOG on each of its digital-only channels. In October 1998, it added DOGs to BBC One and BBC Two but following a large number of complaints they were removed just two months later. However, a BBC TWO DOG was used during the overnight BBC Learning Zone strand. The DOGs for the other channels appear at the top left-hand corner on other channels except BBC News (which is bottom left and forms part of integrated information graphics) and its international counterpart, BBC World News. The BBC News Channel's DOG does not appear when it airs Breakfast. Whilst BBC Four and BBC Parliament have static DOGs, the ones on CBBC and CBeebies alongside other channels such as Nick Jr. feature moving elements. ITV uses DOGs on all its channels, as do its counterparts STV in central and northern Scotland, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands, and UTV in Northern Ireland. Although BBC One and BBC Two currently do not feature their own channel-specific DOGs, a generic BBC logo appears on the top left-hand corner of their iPlayer feeds as is the case with other BBC channels. This generic BBC DOG also appears on catch-up or on-demand programmes on the iPlayer.\n\nThe logos on channels such as ITV (excluding STV), Channel 5, E4, E!, Disney XD, Sky Arts 1 and 2, Sky1, Sky2, Sky Sports, History, and More4 are almost transparent, whereas others like those on Comedy Central, Disney Junior, some UKTV channels, CITV, CBBC, CBeebies, the Discovery channels, Nick Jr., Nicktoons, Boomerang and Nickelodeon are bright and noticeable. Sky Movies and Film4 do not use DOGs, but Channel 4 (starting in July 2017), Channel 4 HD and the timeshift channel Channel 4+1 all do. Some stations display their on-screen graphics permanently. The UKTV are an example that remove them during commercials and trailers, with some Sky channels removing them altogether at certain times into a programme. In addition to a fixed (sometimes animated) motif, MTV includes the programme title in the top-right hand corner. During widescreen programmes, the DOGs on most channels including ITV, BBC Three, BBC Four, ITV2, ITV3, ITV4, CITV, CBBC, CBeebies, E4, and 4Music stay in the far corner of the screen, it is now rare for a channel to place their DOG in a 4:3 \"title safe area\".\n\nOn digital systems such as Sky and Freeview, where stations have a set EPG number and a name displayed across the bottom of the screen when changing channel, DOGs have been deemed unnecessary by some users. Despite this, broadcasters persist with the practice. In response to negative feedback, the BBC has responded, \"We believe it is important to ensure that viewers can quickly identify when they are watching a BBC service.\" It reinforced this position in both 2008 and 2009 following continual complaints to its \"Points of View\" programme, citing channel identification as the sole reason for the policy. In its website FAQs, Five's stated reason for its use of a DOG is that \"the vast majority of channels carry them, most permanently and virtually every channel at some point has one during the day.\" However, on 21 October 2008, the BBC announced that it was removing the DOG from BBC HD for all films and most dramas, acknowledging that there was an \"irritation factor\". However, the DOG came back when BBC One HD launched in 2010. As of 2016, neither BBC One HD nor BBC Two HD was using a DOG. More recent additions are graphics which appear near the end of a programme to tell the viewer what's up next, despite this information being available at a touch of a button on digital TV. Many viewers also find this practice annoying, distracting and unnecessary.\n\nThe first logo bug appeared in the 1970's on cable networks and local TV stations. It was often displayed on the bottom of the screen for 5 to 10 seconds. It was usually displayed once per hour, or every 10 or 15 minutes during a program. One of the popular title generator machines during that time was made by \"Chryron\". But other brands were also used. The first transparent logo bug to be displayed throughout an entire show appeared on CBS Evening News in 1990. It was part of the redesign of the news broadcast done by branding design firm Novocom. The reason for its introduction was so that business professionals traveling within the US would know which channel CBS News was on since it varied in different areas. Later it was adopted by CBS on every program. Since then, the use of digital on-screen bugs among cable and broadcast networks became standardized with the bug usually placed on the lower right hand corner of the screen, with the notable exception being during the broadcasting of sports events (where logo bugs have largely been placed in the top-right), and on most NBCUniversal networks (including NBC), where its standard bug was moved to the bottom left during prime time programming in 2006. During sports broadcasts, \"NFL on Fox\" introduced a permanent box at the top left-hand side of the screen showing the score of the game, along with the network's logo.\n\nThe \"big four\" networks (CBS, ABC, NBC, FOX) began using on-screen bugs in September 1993 with the bug removed during commercial breaks. Other major networks such as PBS and The CW also use logo bugs in the same manner. They are usually monochrome to minimize distraction, while some cable networks (The History Channel, Nickelodeon, and CNBC) decided to use solid, full-color bugs at all times. Broadcast stations and networks typically only use solid, full color bugs during local newscasts, newscasts, and sports broadcasts; at other times the bug is switched to the transparent, gray variant. Also, broadcast channels typically show their local affiliate's call sign and/or the channel number on the screen bugs during local newscasts and in some cases syndicated programming. First-run syndicated programmes often display their own bug in addition to the bug of the station they are running on. Meanwhile, network-based programming (including prime time programs and national newscasts) is typically shown with only the network's bug for most of the broadcast (although an automated system may allow a local bug to be overlaid onto network programming for a few seconds after the start of a programme or a commercial break).\n\nBefore the 2009 digital television transition, early high definition broadcasts often used bugs placed outside the 4:3 safe zone (sometimes with special \"HD\" branding) to distinguish them from the standard definition broadcast. By the late-2000s, due to networks switching to a singular HD feed downconverted for SD (assuming that the SD feed will be center-cut from the HD feed, or using Active Format Description (AFD) metadata to specify the framing format) as their network feed rather than distinct feeds for both formats, most broadcast networks dropped HD-specific logo bugs and used bugs in the 4:3 safe zone for all viewers, regardless of feed. However, by 2018, the majority of logo bugs and on-air presentation has been oriented towards 16:9 framing.\n\nThe use of bugs to announce upcoming programs with text advertisements is also particularly prevalent among some broadcast stations during prime time programs and many cable TV networks; they usually appear when a program resumes after a commercial break, to inform the viewer of the next scheduled program, a new episode of a program later the same day, or a \"significant\" broadcast in the near future. Since the mid-2000s, some stations and networks showed their websites alongside their bugs, especially during newscasts. National morning shows like Today and Good Morning America have also showed their specific websites rather than their network's main website in addition to the bug that shows their programme. Beginning in 2010, some networks began to display show-specific hashtags alongside their bugs, which encourage viewers to discuss and interact with the program online via social networking services such as Twitter.\n\nVietnamese TV stations started showing their digital on-screen graphical DOGs since year 1995. Logos are not removed during commercial breaks, but remained in full-color, unlike their counterparts in Indonesia. A digital clock and programme name may also be shown. Some cable channels show its cable provider logo and its logo. For example, VTV Cable's channels has the logo of the cable provider on the top-left, and the channel logo on the top-right.\n\nAnother graphic on television usually connected with sports (particularly in North America, though not in Europe) is the sponsor tag. It shows the logos of certain sponsors, accompanied by some background relevant to the game, the network logo, announcement and music of some kind.\n\nIn most countries, the ham station is required to periodically identify their amateur-TV transmission. Such stations frequently overlay their callsign on the signal instead of placing a card in the background. Most hams use homebuilt devices or old consumer character generators to generate such identifications rather than using graphical super imposes of high cost to do so. Only rarely one can see real graphics, as the callsign is usually written in the \"OSD font\".\n\nOne of the easiest and most sought-after devices used to generate DOGs by hobbyists is the 1980s vintage Sony XV-T500 video superimposer. This device can luma-key a signal, capture a still frame into memory and then overlay the keyed graphic in one of eight colors onto any CVBS signal. Another method commonly used by hobbyists and even low-budgeted TV stations in former times was Amiga computers with genlock interfaces.\n\n\n 15 Logo Designs Samples\n\n"}
{"id": "241300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=241300", "title": "Eddie Cantor", "text": "Eddie Cantor\n\nEddie Cantor (born Edward Israel Itzkowitz, January 31, 1892 – October 10, 1964) was an American \"illustrated song\" performer, comedian, dancer, singer, actor, and songwriter. Familiar to Broadway, radio, movie, and early television audiences, this \"Apostle of Pep\" was regarded almost as a family member by millions because his top-rated radio shows revealed intimate stories and amusing anecdotes about his wife Ida and five daughters. Some of his hits include \"Makin' Whoopee\", \"Ida\", \"If You Knew Susie\", \"Ma! He's Makin' Eyes at Me\", \"Baby\", \"Margie\", and \"How Ya Gonna Keep 'em Down on the Farm (After They've Seen Paree)?\" He also wrote a few songs, including \"Merrily We Roll Along\", the \"Merrie Melodies\" Warner Bros. cartoon theme.\n\nHis eye-rolling song-and-dance routines eventually led to his nickname, \"Banjo Eyes\". In 1933, artist Frederick J. Garner caricatured Cantor with large round eyes resembling the drum-like pot of a banjo. Cantor's eyes became his trademark, often exaggerated in illustrations, and leading to his appearance on Broadway in the musical \"Banjo Eyes\" (1941).\n\nHis charity and humanitarian work was extensive, and he is credited with coining the phrase, and helping to develop the March of Dimes. He was awarded an honorary Academy Award in 1956 for distinguished service to the film industry.\n\nCantor was born in 1892 in New York City, the son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, Meta and Mechel Itzkowitz. The precise date of his birth is unknown. His mother died in childbirth one year after his birth, and his father died of pneumonia when Eddie was two, leaving him to be raised by his grandmother, Esther Kantrowitz. As a child, he attended Surprise Lake Camp. A misunderstanding when his grandmother signed him into school gave him her last name of Kantrowitz (shortened by the clerk to \"Kanter\"). Esther died on January 29, 1917, two days before Cantor signed a long-term contract with Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr., to appear in his \"Follies\".\nCantor had adopted the first name \"Eddie\" when he met his future wife Ida Tobias in 1913, because she felt that \"Izzy\" was not the right name for an actor. Cantor and Ida were married in 1914. They had five daughters, Marjorie, Natalie, Edna, Marilyn, and Janet, who provided comic fodder for Cantor's longtime running gag, especially on radio, about his five unmarriageable daughters. Several radio historians, including Gerald Nachman (\"Raised on Radio\"), have said that this gag did not always sit well with the girls. Natalie's second husband was the actor Robert Clary and Janet married the actor Roberto Gari.\n\nCantor was the second president of the Screen Actors Guild, serving from 1933 to 1935. He invented the title \"The March of Dimes\" for the donation campaigns of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, which was organized to combat polio. It was a play on \"The March of Time\" newsreels popular at the time. He began the first campaign on his radio show in January 1938, asking listeners to mail a dime to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. At that time, Roosevelt was the most notable American victim of polio. Other entertainers joined in the appeal via their own shows, and the White House mail room was deluged with 2,680,000 dimes—a large sum at the time.\n\nFollowing the death of their daughter Marjorie at the age of 44, both Eddie and Ida's health declined rapidly. Ida died on August 9, 1962 at age 70 of \"cardiac insufficiency\", and Eddie died on October 10, 1964, in Beverly Hills, California, after suffering his second heart attack at age 72. He is interred in Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.\n\nBy his early teens, Cantor began winning talent contests at local theaters and started appearing on stage. One of his earliest paying jobs was doubling as a waiter and performer, singing for tips at Carey Walsh's Coney Island saloon, where a young Jimmy Durante accompanied him on piano. He made his first public appearance in Vaudeville in 1907 at New York's Clinton Music Hall. In 1912, he was the only performer over the age of 20 to appear in Gus Edwards's \"Kid Kabaret\", where he created his first blackface character, \"Jefferson\". He later toured with Al Lee as the team \"Cantor and Lee\". Critical praise from that show got the attention of Broadway's top producer, Florenz Ziegfeld, who gave Cantor a spot in the Ziegfeld rooftop post-show, \"Midnight Frolic\" (1917).\n\nA year later, Cantor made his Broadway debut in the \"Ziegfeld Follies of 1917\". He continued in the \"Follies\" until 1927, a period considered the best years of the long-running revue. For several years, Cantor co-starred in an act with pioneer comedian Bert Williams, both appearing in blackface; Cantor played Williams's fresh-talking son. Other co-stars with Cantor during his time in the \"Follies\" included Will Rogers, Marilyn Miller, Fanny Brice, and W.C. Fields. He moved on to stardom in book musicals, starting with \"Kid Boots\" (1923) and \"Whoopee!\" (1928). On tour with \"Banjo Eyes\", he romanced the unknown Jacqueline Susann, who had a small part in the show, and went on to become the best-selling author of \"Valley of the Dolls\".\n\n\nCantor appeared on radio as early as February 3, 1922, as indicated by this news item from Connecticut's \"Bridgeport Telegram\":\n\nCantor's appearance with Rudy Vallee on Vallee's \"The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour\" on February 5, 1931 led to a four-week tryout with NBC's \"The Chase and Sanborn Hour\". Replacing Maurice Chevalier, who was returning to Paris, Cantor joined \"Chase and Sanborn\" on September 13, 1931. This hour-long Sunday evening variety series teamed Cantor with announcer Jimmy Wallington and violinist Dave Rubinoff. The show established Cantor as a leading comedian, and his scriptwriter, David Freedman, as “the Captain of Comedy.” Freedman's team included, among others, Samuel \"Doc\" Kurtzman, who also wrote for song-and-dance man, Al Jolson, and the comedian Jack Benny. Cantor soon became the world's highest-paid radio star. His shows began with a crowd chanting \"We want Can-tor! We want Can-tor!\", a phrase said to have originated in vaudeville, when the audience chanted to chase off an act on the bill before Cantor. Cantor's theme song was his own lyric to the Leo Robin/Richard Whiting song, \"One Hour with You\". His radio sidekicks included Bert Gordon, (comic Barney Gorodetsky, AKA \"The Mad Russian\") and Harry Parke (better known as \"Parkyakarkus\"). Cantor also discovered and helped guide the career of singer Dinah Shore, first featuring her on his radio show in 1940, as well as other performers, including Deanna Durbin, Bobby Breen in 1936 and Eddie Fisher in 1949.\n\nIndicative of his effect on the mass audience, he agreed in November 1934 to introduce a new song by the songwriters J. Fred Coots and Haven Gillespie that other well-known artists had rejected as being \"silly\" and \"childish\". The song, \"Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town\", immediately had orders for 100,000 copies of sheet music the next day. It sold 400,000 copies by Christmas of that year.\n\nHis NBC radio show, \"Time to Smile\", was broadcast from 1940 to 1946, followed by his \"Pabst Blue Ribbon Show\" from 1946 through 1949. He also served as emcee of \"The $64 Question\" during 1949–50, and hosted a weekly disc jockey program for Philip Morris during the 1952–53 season. In addition to film and radio, Cantor recorded for Hit of the Week Records, then again for Columbia, for Banner and Decca and various small labels.\n\nHis heavy political involvement began early in his career, including his participation in the strike to form Actors Equity in 1919, provoking the anger of father figure and producer, Florenz Ziegfeld. At the 1939 New York World's Fair, Cantor publicly denounced antisemitic radio personality Father Charles Coughlin and Cantor was dropped by his sponsor, Camel cigarettes. A year and a half later, Eddie's friend Jack Benny was able to get him back on the air.\n\nCantor began making phonograph records in 1917, recording both comedy songs and routines and popular songs of the day, first for Victor, then for Aeoleon-Vocalion, Pathé, and Emerson. From 1921 through 1925, he had an exclusive contract with Columbia Records, returning to Victor for the remainder of the decade.\n\nCantor was one of the era's most successful entertainers, but the 1929 stock market crash took away his multimillionaire status and left him deeply in debt. However, Cantor's relentless attention to his own earnings to avoid the poverty he knew growing up caused him to use his writing talent, quickly building a new bank account with his highly popular, bestselling books of humor and cartoons about his experience, \"Caught Short! A Saga of Wailing Wall Street\" in 1929 \"A.C.\" (After Crash), and \"Yoo-Hoo, Prosperity!\"\n\nCantor was also a composer, with his most famous song seldom attributed to him. In 1935, along with Charles Tobias and Murray Mencher, Cantor wrote \"Merrily We Roll Along\", which he recorded in the 1950s. It was adapted as the themesong for the \"Merrie Melodies\" series of animated cartoons, distributed by Warner Brothers Pictures between 1937 and 1964. Cantor himself was frequently caricatured in Warner cartoons of the period, (see Film and television: Animation).\n\nCantor also bounced back between films and radio. He had previously appeared in a number of short films, performing his \"Follies\" songs and comedy routines, and two silent features (\"Special Delivery\" and \"Kid Boots\") in the 1920s. He was offered the lead in \"The Jazz Singer\" after it was turned down by George Jessel. Cantor also turned the role down (so it went to Al Jolson), but he became a leading Hollywood star in 1930 with the film version of \"Whoopee!,\" shot in two-color Technicolor. He continued making films over the next two decades until his last starring role in \"If You Knew Susie\" (1948).\n\n\nOn May 25, 1944, pioneer television station WPTZ (now KYW-TV) in Philadelphia presented a special, all-star telecast which was also seen in New York over WNBT (now WNBC) and featured cut-ins from their Rockefeller Center studios. Cantor, one of the first major stars to agree to appear on television, was to sing \"We're Havin' a Baby, My Baby and Me\". Arriving shortly before airtime at the New York studios, Cantor was reportedly told to cut the song because the NBC New York censors considered some of the lyrics too risqué. Cantor refused, claiming no time to prepare an alternative number. NBC relented, but the sound was cut and the picture blurred on certain lines in the song. This is considered the first instance of television censorship.\n\nIn 1950, he became the first of several hosts alternating on the NBC television variety show \"The Colgate Comedy Hour\", in which he would introduce musical acts, stage and film stars and play comic characters such as \"Maxie the Taxi\". In the spring of 1952, Cantor landed in an unlikely controversy when a young Sammy Davis, Jr., appeared as a guest performer. Cantor embraced Davis and mopped Davis's brow with his handkerchief after his performance. When worried sponsors led NBC to threaten cancellation of the show, Cantor's response was to book Davis for two more weeks. Cantor suffered a heart attack following a September 1952 Colgate broadcast, and thereafter, curtailed his appearances until his final program in 1954. In 1955, he appeared in a filmed series for syndication and a year later, appeared in two dramatic roles (\"George Has A Birthday\", on NBC's \"Matinee Theatre\" broadcast in color, and \"Sizeman and Son\" on CBS's \"Playhouse 90\"). He continued to appear as a guest on several shows, and was last seen on the NBC color broadcast of \"The Future Lies Ahead\" on January 22, 1960, which also featured Mort Sahl.\n\nEddie Cantor was portrayed as a recurring character on HBO's series \"Boardwalk Empire\", beginning with the introduction of the show in 2010, where he is played by Stephen DeRosa. Cantor's character appeared in three episodes of the show's first season, one episode of the second season, two of the third. and one of the fourth season.\n\nCantor appears in caricature form in numerous \"Looney Tunes\" cartoons produced for Warner Bros., although he was often voiced by an imitator. Beginning with \"I Like Mountain Music\" (1933), other animated Cantor cameos include \"Shuffle Off to Buffalo\" (Harman-Ising, 1933) and \"Billboard Frolics\" (Friz Freleng, 1935). Eddie Cantor is one of the four \"down on their luck\" stars (along with Bing Crosby, Al Jolson, and Jack Benny) snubbed by Elmer Fudd in \"What’s Up, Doc?\" (Bob McKimson, 1950). In \"Farm Frolics\" (Bob Clampett, 1941), a horse, asked by the narrator to \"do a canter\", promptly launches into a singing, dancing, eye-rolling impression. The Cantor gag that got the most mileage, however, was his oft-repeated wish for a son after five famous daughters. \"Slap-Happy Pappy\" (Clampett, 1940) features an “Eddie Cackler” rooster that wants a boy, to little avail. Other references can be found in \"Baby Bottleneck\" (Clampett, 1946) and \"Circus Today\" (Tex Avery, 1940). In\" Merrie Melodies\", \"The Coo-Coo Nut Grove\" Cantor's many daughters are referenced by a group of singing quintuplet girls. In \"Porky’s Naughty Nephew\" (Clampett, 1938) a swimming Cantor gleefully adopts a \"buoy\". An animated Cantor also appears prominently in Walt Disney's \"Mother Goose Goes Hollywood\" (Wilfred Jackson, 1938) as Little Jack Horner, who sings \"Sing a Song of Sixpence\".\n\nCantor's popularity led to merchandising of such products as \"Eddie Cantor's Tell It to the Judge\" game from Parker Brothers. In 1933, a set of 12 Eddie Cantor caricatures by Frederick J. Garner was published by Brown and Bigelow. These advertising cards were purchased in bulk as a direct-mail item by such businesses as auto body shops, funeral directors, dental laboratories, and vegetable wholesale dealers. With the full set, companies could mail a single Cantor card each month for a year to their selected special customers as an ongoing promotion. Cantor was often caricatured on the covers of sheet music and in magazines and newspapers. Cantor was depicted as a balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, one of the very few balloons based on a real person.\n\nIn addition to \"Caught Short!\", Cantor wrote or co-wrote at least seven other books, including booklets released by the then-fledgling firm of Simon & Schuster, with Cantor’s name on the cover. (Some were \"as told to\" or written with David Freedman.) Customers paid a dollar and received the booklet with a penny embedded in the hardcover. They sold well, and H. L. Mencken asserted that these books did more to pull America out of the Great Depression than all government measures combined.\n\n\nCantor was profiled on \"This Is Your Life\", the NBC program in which an unsuspecting person (usually a celebrity) would be surprised on live television by host Ralph Edwards, with a half-hour tribute. Cantor was the only subject who was told of the surprise in advance; he was recovering from a heart attack and it was felt that the shock might harm him.\n\nOn October 29, 1995, as part of a nationwide celebration of the 75th anniversary of radio, he was posthumously inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame at Chicago's Museum of Broadcasting Communication.\n\nIn 1953, Warner Bros., in an attempt to duplicate the box-office success of \"The Jolson Story\", filmed a big-budget Technicolor feature film, \"The Eddie Cantor Story\". The film found an audience, but might have done better with someone else in the leading role. Actor Keefe Brasselle played Cantor as a caricature with high-pressure dialogue and bulging eyes wide open; the fact that Brasselle was considerably taller than Cantor did not lend realism, either. Eddie and Ida Cantor were seen in a brief prologue and epilogue set in a projection room, where they are watching Brasselle in action; at the end of the film, Eddie tells Ida, \"I never looked better in my life\"... and gives the audience a knowing, incredulous look. George Burns, in his memoir \"All My Best Friends\", claimed that Warner Bros. created a miracle producing the movie in that \"it made Eddie Cantor's life boring\".\n\nSomething closer to the real Eddie Cantor story is his self-produced 1944 feature \"Show Business\", a valentine to vaudeville and show folks, which was RKO's top-grossing film that year.\n\nProbably the best summary of Cantor's career is on one of the \"Colgate Comedy Hour\" shows. Re-issued on DVD as \"Eddie Cantor in Person\", the hour episode is a virtual video autobiography, with Eddie recounting his career, singing his greatest hits, and recreating his singing-waiter days with another vaudeville legend, his old pal Jimmy Durante.\n\nCantor appears as a recurring character, played by Stephen DeRosa, on the HBO series \"Boardwalk Empire\".\n\n\n"}

(See National Anthem of Uruguay#Music.)\n\nAs ethnic Hungarian, his original Eastern order name was Debály Ferenc József. His Christian names were later in Uruguay translated into the Spanish version, but his surname is known to be spelled as Debali, de Bali, Debáli, Debály and Debally.\n\nHe was an Austrian subject born in Oltenia (\"Lesser Wallachia\").\n\nHe played the oboe. In 1820, he went abroad to pursue his musical career in the Kingdom of Sardinia. There, in Alessandria, he married Magdalena Bagnasco, from Genoa. They had several children, some of which were born in Uruguay. After a short stay at São Paulo, Brazil, from which he departed due to a yellow fever epidemic, he arrived in Uruguay in 1838. Here he was the director of the orchestra at the \"Sala de Comedias\" in Montevideo from 1841-48.\n\nIn 1845 he composed what would be adopted three years later as the Uruguayan national anthem, to a text by Francisco Acuña de Figueroa. It was played for the first time in public on July 19, 1845. Fernando Quijano, his assistant, who had submitted the composition to the government's selecting contest, was credited with the authorship because of Debali's failure to grasp the content, in the Spanish language, of the governmental decree that adopted his composition as the country's anthem.\n"}

Humorists are distinct from comedians, who are show business entertainers whose business is to make an audience laugh, though some persons have occupied both roles in the course of their careers.\n\nMark Twain, pen name of Samuel Langhorn Clemens (1835–1910) was called the \"greatest humorist this country has produced\" in his \"New York Times\" obituary, and William Faulkner called him \"the father of American literature\".\n\nThe United States national cultural center, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, has chosen to award a Mark Twain Prize for American Humor annually since 1998 to individuals who have \"had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th century novelist and essayist best known as Mark Twain\".\n\nHumor is the quality which makes experiences provoke laughter or amusement, while comedy is a performing art. The nineteenth century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer lamented the misuse of \"humor\" (a German loanword from English) to mean any type of comedy. A humorist is adept at seeing the humor in a situation or aspect of life and relating it, usually through a story; the comedian, on the other hand, concentrates on jokes designed to invoke instantaneous laughter. The humorist is primarily a writer of books, newspaper or magazine articles or columns, stage or screen plays, and may occasionally appear before an audience to deliver a lecture or read a piece of his or her work. The comedian always performs his or her work for an audience, either in live performance, audio recording, radio, television, or film.\n\nAccording to \"Study.com\", a humorist job requires a bachelor's degree, and according to US Bureau of Labor statistics, earns a 2016 median salary of US$29.44. This is compared to the comedian, which requires a high school diploma and earns a median salary of $17.34.\n\nPhil Austin, of the comedy group the Firesign Theatre, expressed his thoughts about the difference in 1993 liner notes to the \"Fighting Clowns\" allbum:\n\nSometimes a comedian will adopt a writing career and gain notability as a humorist. Some examples are:\n\nWill Rogers (1879–1935) was a vaudeville comedian who started doing humorous political and social commentary, and became a famous newspaper columnist and radio personality during the Great Depression. He is an exception to the education rule, as he only completed a tenth grade education.\n\nGarry Moore (1915–1993), known as a television comedian who hosted several variety and game shows, after his 1977 retirement became a regular humor columnist for the newspaper \"The Island Packet\" of Northeast Harbor, Maine, with a column titled \"Mumble, Mumble\". He later released a book of his columns under the same name in the early 1980s. \n\nVictor Borge (1909–2000) was a Danish-American comedian known for bringing humor to classical music. He wrote three books, \"My Favorite Intermissions\" and \"My Favorite Comedies in Music\" (both with Robert Sherman), and the autobiography \"Smilet er den korteste afstand\" (\"The Smile is the Shortest Distance\") with Niels-Jørgen Kaiser.\n\nPeter Ustinov (1921–2004) was an English comic actor who wrote several humorous plays and film scripts.\n\nWoody Allen (born 1935), known as a comedian and filmmaker, early in his career worked as a staff writer for humorist Herb Shriner. He also wrote short stories and cartoon captions for magazines such as \"The New Yorker\".\n\nSteve Martin (born 1945), comedian and actor, wrote \"Cruel Shoes\", a book of humorous essays and short stories, in 1977 (published 1979). He wrote his first humorous play \"Picasso at the Lapin Agile\" in 1993, and wrote various pieces in \"The New Yorker\" magazine in the 1990s. He later wrote more humorous plays and two novellas.\nHugh Laurie (born 1959) is an English comic actor who worked for many years in partnership with Stephen Fry. He is a fan of the English humorist P. G. Wodehouse, and has written a Wodehouse-style novel.\n\nDespite the name, conference of the Kennedy Center's Mark Twain Prize does not make the awardee a humorist. , the center has chosen to confer the prize on nineteen comedians and one playwright; only two recipients, the comedian Steve Martin and the playwright Neil Simon, are commonly recognized as humorists in the sense of Twain.\n\nRenowned polymath Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790), as a newspaper editor and printer, became one of America's first humorists, most famously for \"Poor Richard's Almanack\" published under the pen name \"Richard Saunders\". \n\nRing Lardner (1885–1933) was a sports columnist and short story writer best known for his satirical writings about sports, marriage, and the theatre.\n\nRobert Benchley (1889–1945), best known for his work as a newspaper columnist and film actor, began writing humorously for \"The Harvard Lampoon\" while attending Harvard University, and for many years wrote essays and articles for \"Vanity Fair\" and \"The New Yorker\".\n\nH. L. Menken (1880–1956) was a journalist, satirist, cultural critic and scholar of American English. Known as the \"Sage of Baltimore\", he is regarded as one of the most influential American writers and prose stylists of the first half of the 20th century. He commented widely on the social scene, literature, music, prominent politicians and contemporary movements. He is known for dubbing the Scopes trial \"the Monkey Trial\".\n\nJames Thurber (1894–1961) was a cartoonist, author, journalist, playwright, and celebrated wit, best known for his cartoons and short stories published mainly in \"The New Yorker\".\n\nBennett Cerf (1898–1971) was one of the founders of the publishing firm Random House, known for his own compilations of jokes and puns, for regular personal appearances lecturing across the United States, and for his television appearances on the panel game show \"What's My Line?\"\n\nArt Buchwald (1925–2007) wrote a political satire op-ed column for \"The Washington Post\", which was nationally syndicated in many newspapers.\n\nGarrison Keilor (born 1942) is an author, storyteller, voice actor, and radio personality, best known as the creator and host of the Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) show \"A Prairie Home Companion\" from 1974 to 2016. He created the fictional Minnesota town Lake Wobegon, the setting of many of his books. He created and voiced the hardboiled detective parody character Guy Noir on his radio show.\n\nOscar Wilde (1854–1900) was an Irish poet and playwright known for his biting wit.\n\nJerome K. Jerome (1859–1927) was an English writer and humorist, best known for the comic travelogue \"Three Men in a Boat\".\n\nP. G. Wodehouse (1881–1975) was one of the most widely read humorists of the 20th century.\n\nTom Sharpe (1928–2013) was a satirical novelist, best known for his \"Wilt\" series, as well as \"Porterhouse Blue\" and \" Blott on the Landscape\".\n\nAlan Coren (1938–2007) could be considered the English equivalent of Bennett Cerf: a writer and satirist who was well known as a regular panelist on the BBC radio quiz \"The News Quiz\" and a team captain on BBC television's \"Call My Bluff\". Coren was also a journalist, and for almost a decade was the editor of \"Punch\" magazine.\n\nTerry Pratchett (1948–2015) was an author known for comic fantasy novels, most notably the \"Discworld\" series of 41 novels.

{"id": "622305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=622305", "title": "Julian Eltinge", "text": "Julian Eltinge\n\nJulian Eltinge (May 14, 1881 – March 7, 1941), born William Julian Dalton, was an American stage and film actor and female impersonator. After appearing in the Boston Cadets Revue at the age of ten in feminine garb, Eltinge garnered notice from other producers and made his first appearance on Broadway in 1904. As his star began to rise, he appeared in vaudeville and toured Europe and the United States, even giving a command performance before King Edward VII. Eltinge appeared in a series of musical comedies written specifically for his talents starting in 1910 with \"The Fascinating Widow\", returning to vaudeville in 1918. His popularity soon earned him the moniker \"Mr. Lillian Russell\" for the popular beauty and musical comedy star.\n\nHollywood beckoned Eltinge and in 1917 he appeared in his first feature film, \"The Countess Charming\". This led to other films, including 1918's \"The Isle of Love\" with Rudolph Valentino and Virginia Rappe. By the time Eltinge arrived in Hollywood, he was considered one of the highest paid actors on the American stage; but with the arrival of the Great Depression and the death of vaudeville, Eltinge's star began to fade. He continued his show in nightclubs but found little success. He died in 1941 following a show at a New York City nightclub. He leaves a legacy as one of the greatest female impersonators of the 20th century.\n\nThough the details of his professional life are widely known, Eltinge's personal life is shrouded in mystery; mystery partly due to the passage of time, but really more likely to Eltinge's own hand. Eltinge was born in Newtonville, Massachusetts to Julia Edna Baker and Joseph Dalton. It is believed that his father was a mining engineer and that early in his life he traveled out west with his father, ending up in Butte, Montana. In his early teens, Eltinge dressed in women's clothing and performed in the rugged saloons patronized by ranchers and miners. Upon discovering this in 1899, his father beat him and his mother sent him back to Boston, where the 17-year-old worked in dry goods as a salesman while studying dance.\n\nThe early film star Pauline Frederick tells how she and Eltinge (she knew him by his real name of Bill) were childhood friends, playing 'boats' (in fact chips of wood) in the creek that bordered their properties in Madrid, New York State. Indeed she claims that when at boarding school in Boston she met up with Eltinge, who was already making a name for himself on the vaudeville stage. He dared her to apply to apply to one of the music halls, which was the start of her career on stage and in films.\n\nHis start in show business, like his early life, is also shrouded in myth. Most sources cite his first female role originally having been at the age of ten with the Boston Cadets Review at the Tremont Theater in Boston. He is reported to have played the role so well that the next year the revue was written around him which led to minor roles elsewhere. But as to how he came to perform as a female a decade later with the Boston Cadets, sources differ. In some versions he was taking cakewalk lessons from a Mrs. Wyman's dance studio when he impressed upon his teacher an incredible ability to emulate females. It is said to be Mrs. Wyman who encouraged young William to study the art of female impersonation. Boys often play female roles in all male theater groups.\n\nEltinge's first appearance on Broadway was in the musical comedy \"Mr. Wix of Wickham\" which opened September 19, 1904 at the Bijou Theatre in New York City. The show was produced by E. E. Rice and included music by Jerome Kern among others.\n\nDuring this time Eltinge began performing in vaudeville. Unlike many of the female impersonation acts that existed at that time, like Bert Savoy, Eltinge did not present a caricature of women but presented the illusion of actually being a woman. He toured simply as \"Eltinge\" which left his sex unknown and his act included singing, dancing and quick costume changes in a variety of female roles, including a Gibson Girl-like role called \"The Sampson Girl\". At the conclusion of his performances, he would remove his wig, revealing his true nature to the surprise of the often unknowing audience.\n\nIn 1906 Eltinge made his London debut at the Palace Theater. While in London, Eltinge gave a performance for King Edward VII, who later presented him with a white bulldog. The next year, Eltinge made his New York debut at the Alhambra Theater to critical acclaim. From 1908-09, he toured with Cohan and Harris Minstrels.\n\nEltinge's star began to shine on Broadway and on national tours and his name became known worldwide. Indeed, women were so enthralled by his performances that he established the \"Eltinge Magazine\" which advised women on beauty, fashion, and home tips.\n\nBy 1910, Eltinge had reached the height of his fame. Sime Silverman, Editor of \"Variety\", called him \"as great a performer as there is today\".\n\nIn 1911, Eltinge opened one of his most famous shows, \"The Fascinating Widow\" at New York's Liberty Theater. In it he played Hal Blake who disguises himself as \"Mrs. Monte\" in a \"Charley's Aunt\"-like plot. The show only ran 56 performances in New York, but toured the nation successfully for several years.\n\nThe success of this show led producer A. H. Woods to give Eltinge one of theatre's highest honors, having a theatre named for him. A year to the day that \"The Fascinating Widow\" opened, Woods opened the Eltinge Theatre on New York's 42nd Street designed by noted theater architect Thomas W. Lamb. Eltinge himself never performed in his namesake building. After serving as a legitimate theater for many years, it became a notorious burlesque house and was shut down during a \"public morality\" campaign in 1943, before becoming a cinema the next year. The theater is now part of the AMC Empire 25 cineplex having been lifted and moved in its entirety down the block from its original location.\n\nFollowing on the success of \"The Fascinating Widow\", Eltinge performed in two other comedies that had similar success, \"The Crinoline Girl\" which opened in 1914 and \"Cousin Lucy\" (with music by Kern) the next year.\n\nAs many actors began to leave for the silver screen, Eltinge followed and in 1914 he starred in silent picture versions of \"The Crinoline Girl\" followed by \"Cousin Lucy\" the next year. According to Anthony Slide's \"The Encyclopedia of Vaudeville\", he also had a cameo role in a film entitled \"How Molly Malone Made Good\" in 1915. Eltinge's first real screen success came in 1917 in \"The Countess Charming\". His role in the film was again a double role with him playing both a male and said male in female garb.\n\nSettling in Hollywood, Eltinge made three films in 1917 and also in 1918. During this time he wrote and produced a vaudeville group called \"The Julian Eltinge Players\". With this group he returned triumphantly to the vaudeville stage appearing at New York's Palace Theatre in 1918, where he was paid one of the highest salaries in show business: $3,500 a week. The next year he returned again in a new vaudeville review with sets by the French designer Erté.\n\nBy 1920, Eltinge was very wealthy and was living in one of the most lavish mansions in Southern California, \"Villa Capistrano\". His star began to shine even brighter after his appearance with Rudolf Valentino in the 1920 film \"An Adventuress\" (released as \"The Isle of Love\" in the U.S.). After filming, Eltinge continued touring onstage and did so until 1927. He also made two films, \"Madame Behave\" and \"The Fascinating Widow\", in 1925.\n\nAside from the graceful femininity he exhibited onstage, Eltinge used a super-masculine facade in public to combat the rumours of his homosexuality. This facade included the occasional bar-fight, smoking cigars, and drawn out engagements to women (though he never married). He was also known to physically attack stagehands, members of the audience and others who remarked on his sexuality. Indeed, his sexual duality led to Dorothy Parker's creation of the term \"ambisextrous\" to describe him.\n\nEltinge may have been a gay man, as Milton Berle and many others who worked with him believed. Actress Ruth Gordon stated in a \"New York Times\" article that he was \"as virile as anybody virile.\" There is no existing record of a lover of either sex, though stories did abound.\n\nAccording to one such story recorded by Robert Toll in his book \"On With the Show!\" (1976), he gave a photograph of himself as Salomé, signed \"From your friend Jule\", to a Boston sportswriter. When the sportswriter's wife discovered the photograph in her husband's coat pocket she was outraged. Confronting her husband, she had to be convinced that the \"woman\" in the photograph was actually a man, and then was disturbed to find that her husband had been spending time with him.\n\nEltinge was one of many show business figures to be hit hard by the 1929 stock market crash. By the 1930s, the female impersonations that he had built his career on had begun to lose popularity, as did vaudeville in general. He had grown portly and unable to portray the svelte young female roles of his heyday. Eltinge resorted to performing in nightclubs.\n\nCrackdowns on cross-dressing in public, a misguided attempt to curb homosexual activity, prevented Eltinge from performing in costume. At one appearance in a Los Angeles club, Eltinge stood next to displays of his gowns while describing his old characters.\n\nOn February 25, 1941, Eltinge fell ill while performing at Billy Rose's Diamond Horseshoe nightclub. He was taken home and died in his apartment ten days later on March 7. His death certificate lists the cause of death as a cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nA reference to Julian Eltinge is found in Buster Keaton's comedy \"Seven Chances\" (1925). In the film, Keaton's character must marry before 7:00 PM in order to receive a large inheritance. After many failed attempts to find an instant bride, he sees a poster with a woman's photo outside a performance hall and, in an act of desperation, enters to ask for her hand in marriage. While Keaton is inside, a stagehand removes some boxes to reveal the woman's name on the poster: Julian Eltinge. Keaton then emerges from the theater with a black eye and his boater hat smashed down over his head.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "305121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=305121", "title": "Nick Menza", "text": "Nick Menza\n\nNicholas Menza (July 23, 1964 – May 21, 2016) was an American musician best known as the former drummer for American thrash metal band Megadeth from 1989-1998 and again in 2004 as well as one final return in 2014. He recorded drums on four of Megadeth's albums: \"Rust in Peace\" (1990), \"Countdown to Extinction\" (1992), \"Youthanasia\" (1994) and \"Cryptic Writings\" (1997).\n\nMenza was born in Munich as his father, jazz musician Don Menza, was stationed with the U.S. Army in Germany at the time. Menza began playing drums at the age of two, at which age he performed at his first public concert when during the intermission someone sat him down on Jack DeJohnette's drums and he proceeded to play. His influences stem from being nurtured around the tutelage of such notables as Buddy Rich, Steve Gadd, Nick Ceroli, Jeff Porcaro and Louie Bellson.\n\nBeginning his professional musical career at the age of 18 drumming in the band Rhoads featuring singer Kelle Rhoads, brother of the late Randy Rhoads, Nick released his first record with Rhoads, titled \"Into the Future\", in Europe in 1986.\n\nFollowing Rhoads, Menza was part of a succession of L.A. metal bands, including The Green (with Rhoads bandmates John Goodwin on guitar and Darwin Ballard on bass), Von Skeletor (another collaboration with Goodwin and Michael Guillory on guitars,Cam Daigneault on drums, and Menza handling lead vocals on the band's demo and self-released album, \"Injection of Death\"), and Cold Fire (also featuring Warrior guitarist Joe Floyd) before joining Megadeth.\n\nMoving on to session playing including styles ranging from R&B to gospel, funk and heavy metal, recording with the likes of John Fogerty, Menza caught the attention of then Megadeth drummer Chuck Behler and became his tech. When Megadeth needed a drummer in 1989, Nick Menza was asked by Dave Mustaine to join the band. Mustaine noted that Menza previously filled in on drums when Behler was unable to. Menza first played live with Megadeth on May 12, 1988 in Bradford, England. This prior experience and personal relationship led to the invitation to join Megadeth for the 1990 recording \"Rust in Peace\".\n\nFor the next ten years, Menza became associated with Megadeth's \"classic\" period and also his Greg Voelker Rack System. This included a double-bass drum kit with the tom-toms mounted on a lower chrome rack and all cymbal crashes mounted on a higher rack, which was supported by two chrome bars behind the drummer. This was later adopted by Megadeth on 2004's Blackmail the Universe tour, which featured a similar rack system.\n\nDuring his stint in Megadeth, Menza also played drums on his bandmate Marty Friedman's three solo albums, \"Scenes\" (1992), \"Introduction\" (1994) and \"True Obsessions\" (1996).\n\nBy the summer of 1998, while the band was still touring in support of \"Cryptic Writings\", Menza was having knee problems and sought medical advice. He was informed he had a tumor, which was later found to be benign, and had it removed. Rather than cancel any dates, Megadeth hired Jimmy DeGrasso as a temporary replacement. When the time came to record a follow-up album, Menza was not asked back and DeGrasso became the band's official drummer. Menza has said in several interviews that, while in the hospital recovering from knee surgery, he received a phone call from Mustaine that simply said \"Your services are not needed anymore\". After his departure, he began work on \"Menza: Life After Deth\" with guitarist Anthony Gallo, bassist Jason Levin, and guitarist Ty Longley. The album was initially intended to have a 2002 release date and tour to follow; however, on the tour in 2003 with the reformed Great White, Longley was among the 100 people killed in The Station nightclub fire in Rhode Island and a year later Jason Levin died of heart failure, Menza and Gallo were devastated and the \"Life After Deth\" tour was never announced. Guest guitarist Christian Nesmith, son of The Monkees' Michael Nesmith, did some leads and Menza hired producer Max Norman (Ozzy Osbourne, Megadeth).\n\nFollowing the reissue of the entire Megadeth catalog, Menza was invited to reunite with Megadeth in 2004. Days after a reunion was announced Menza was fired after rehearsals and replaced with Shawn Drover. Dave Mustaine said that this was because Nick \"just wasn't prepared\" for a full-scale U.S. tour, physically.\n\nIn April 2006, Menza joined the Los Angeles-based metal band Orphaned to Hatred. The group describe their sound as \"a continuation of the heavy style of '90s Pantera\". He left the band in late 2010.\n\nMenza nearly suffered the loss of an arm in 2007, after having an accident with a power saw. He required reconstructive surgery and metal plates in his arm and a lengthy rehabilitation, but later recovered. Menza later auctioned off the blood-stained saw blade and an original copy of an X-ray from the incident.\n\nIn March 2011, Menza appeared in a music video for Mindstreem's \"We Up Next\", a song originally written by SIN 34 guitarist Anthony Gallo featuring Tony Lanza and Daniel Wayne, Jr. on vocals. The actual recording is Menza (drums), Gallo (guitars), Gregg Babuccio (bass), and Tony Lanza and Daniel Wayne, Jr. (vocals).\n\nAlso in March 2011, Menza's band Deltanaut posted a video for the song \"Sacrifice\" in conjunction with the release of their Roy Z produced digital-only 5-song EP. The line-up consisted of Menza, his old Rhoads and The Green bandmate, bassist Darwin Ballard, guitarists Christopher Grady and Colin Reid, and lead vocalist Brian Williams. Menza's father, Don Menza who famously played tenor sax on \"The Pink Panther Theme\" with the Henry Mancini Orchestra, plays saxophone on the song \"The King\"; other guests include Roy Z on guitar and Ed Roth on keyboards.\n\nIn 2015, Menza contributed drum tracks to the song \"Are We Alone?\" on the album \"Warless Society (The Global Invasion)\" by Ci2i, with John Goodwin and Darwin Ballard on guitar and bass, respectively. In 2015 he also began working with Los Angeles band Sweet Eve on their follow up album \"The Immortal Machine\" as producer and drummer.\n\nOn May 21, 2016, Menza was performing with his band, OHM, at The Baked Potato jazz club in Studio City, CA. Only three songs into the set, Menza collapsed onstage. He was rushed to a hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. An autopsy later showed the cause of death to be congestive heart failure. Menza was 51.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Related activities such as solicitation, procuring and being involved in the running of a brothel are illegal. A World Bank study estimated there were about 11,000 prostitutes in Namibia.\n\nHuman trafficking, child prostitution and HIV are problems in the country.\n\nProstitution takes place all over the country, particularly in border areas, transport corridors, Walvis Bay and the capital Windhoek. Most prostitutes are Namibian, but there are also a significant number from Zambia, Botswana and Angola. Most women work independently and few have pimps.\n\nMost prostitutes in Namibia meet their clients either on the street or in bars. Bars often have a room on the premises for the prostitutes to use, and brothels usually have a bar, so the line between a bar and a brothel is often blurred. Some, more up-market, sex workers are contacted by cell phone or the internet and work in high-end clubs and hotels.\n\nMany clients are reluctant to use condoms, and offer to pay more for unprotected sex. Condoms may be difficult to obtain at times, and can be confiscated by police and used as evidence of prostitution.\n\nSex workers and NGOs report abuse and violence against them by clients and police. Extortion and forced sex by the police is also reported.\n\nChild prostitution is a problem, particularly in Walvis Bay and Windhoek.\n\nIn 1899, regulations around brothels using white prostitutes were drawn up in Swakopmund. This allowed the authorities to monitor the sexual health of the prostitutes and was designed to control the spread of STIs. Colonial authorities believed unregulated African prostitutes were the main source of STIs. Other towns subsequently introduced similar regulations, including Okahandja, Karibib, Windhoek, Keetmanshoop, Luderitz, Tsumeb and Seeheim. The use of white prostitutes was encourage to try and prevent relationships between white men and African women. There is evidence that some of the white prostitutes had been trafficked into the country.\n\nAfter the Herero Wars, the German military set up a brothel in Windhoek for their troops. Although some indigenous women volunteered to work in the brothel, others were forced to work there.\n\nAlthough white men seeing African prostitutes was discouraged, it was tolerated throughout this era.\n\nProstitution was not made illegal, but the \"Undesirables Removal Proclamation\" (1920) was used to expel most of the white prostitutes and brothel keepers back to Germany. Also introduced in 1920 was the \"Police Offences Proclamation\", which criminalised loitering and solicitation for the purpose of prostitution. There were concerns about child prostitution, and in 1921 the \"Girls' and Mentally Defective Women's Protection Proclamation\" was introduced which set the age of consent at 16. \n\nProstitution was blamed by the authorities for African women migration to the cities from rural areas. A new regulation was introduced in 1938 requiring all \"native females\" in Windhoek between 18 and 60, unless legally married and living with their husbands, to undergo a medical examination every 6 months. After violent protests in March 1939 the regulation was withdrawn.\n\nThe \"Combating of Immoral Practices Act (Act 21 of 1980)\" is the main piece of legislation controlling prostitution in Namibia. The main provisions are the prohibiting of mainly third party involvement:\n\nWindhoek has Municipal Street and Traffic Regulations which prohibit loitering and soliciting.\n\nIn case law it has been established that a prostitute working on her own in a house is not keeping a brothel, and that living on the earnings of prostitution does not apply to the prostitute themselves.\n\nPublic order offences are also used against sex workers.\n\nA number of prominent groups have called for the legalization or decriminalization of prostitution. In 2008, the Legal Assistance Centre, a Windhoek-based non-profit human rights organisation, called for the decriminalization of prostitution as a means of cutting the country's high HIV-AIDS rate as well as a means for maintaining the human rights of the prostitute themselves. Rights not Rescue, a sex workers organisation is amongst those calling for decriminalisation.\n\nMany groups in Namibia actively oppose legalization and instead focus on providing skills to former sex workers. Some groups approach the issue from a religious perspective, arguing that Namibia's population is overwhelmingly Christian and therefore should not accept what they consider an immoral profession.\n\nDiscussions in Parliament are usually controversial. An outspoken proponent of legalisation is Kazenambo Kazenambo, until 2015 Minister of Youth.\n\nHIV/AIDS in Namibia is a critical public health issue. The prevalence of HIV in Namibia is among the highest in the world. Since 1996, HIV has been the leading cause of death in the country. Sex workers are a high risk group. Some sources put the HIV prevalence amongst sex workers as high as 70%. Reluctance to use condoms, lack of sexual health education and limited access to healthcare are cited as contributory factors.\n\nNamibia is a source and destination country for children, and to a lesser extent women, subjected to sex trafficking. Namibian children are subjected to sex trafficking in Windhoek and Walvis Bay. A 2015 media report alleged foreign sex tourists from southern Africa and Europe exploit child sex trafficking victims. In 2014, an NGO reported persons in prostitution, some of whom may have been trafficking victims, were taken aboard foreign vessels off the Namibian coast. Children from less affluent neighbouring countries may be subjected to sex trafficking.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Namibia as a Tier 2 country.\n\n"}

{"id": "17745589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17745589", "title": "St George (advertisement)", "text": "St George (advertisement)\n\nSt George is a multi-award-winning television commercial for the British soft drink, Blackcurrant Tango. The commercial was created by Chas Bayfield and Jim Bolton at the UK advertising agency, HHCL + Partners and was directed by Colin Gregg at the production company, Eclipse, for the client David Atter at Britvic.\n\nThe advertisement was Tango's biggest advertisement to date, and with most of its budget being spent on production as opposed to airtime, the advert only appeared on national television ten times, mostly in advert breaks during the Channel 4 series \"TFI Friday\". This unusual scheduling idea was deemed groundbreaking. The advert won several major advertising awards in 1997, notably a Cannes Gold Lion and a Silver Pencil from D&AD in London. It has been voted one of the 100 best commercials of all time and was popular for its latent jingoism and the fact that it appears to have been filmed in one continuous shot.\n\nThe advert also saw the re-release of \"Don't You Want Me\" by Felix, which features in the advert, as a CD and cassette release, which also featured the Tango Blackcurrant logo. It reached number 17 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\n\"St George\" opens with Tango \"spokesman\", Ray Gardner, in his office in the headquarters of Tango. He appears to be doing a corporate video. He has a letter in his hand from a French exchange student, Sebastien Loyes, who is critical of new blackcurrant flavoured Tango. Ray addresses Sebastien's criticism in what begins as a mutual retort before slowly developing into a full-on rant. Ray walks forward, bumping into the camera before continuing his rant through the office. He is joined by some colleagues who follow him out into the car park where, now in full flow, he begins stripping off. Ray is joined by more staff who help him off with the rest of his clothes, revealing some bright purple boxing shorts under his trousers. Ray and his entourage arrive seamlessly on the White Cliffs of Dover where a flag waving army of supporters have gathered to cheer on their leader. The commercial is now fully widescreen and the action is accompanied by rousing anthemic dance music - \"Don't You Want Me\" by Felix. As they help him into some purple boxing gloves and place a purple cloak around his shoulders, Ray continues his rant against Sebastien. On the edge of the cliffs is a boxing ring which Ray climbs into, before challenging Sebastian, France, Europe and the world to a fight. In the sky behind him, three Harrier Jump Jets appear and tilt menacingly.\n\nSince 1992, London-based off-kilter advertising agency HHCL + Partners (Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury and Partners) had created each advertisement for the different variants and flavours of Tango, owned by Britvic, beginning with the controversial but acclaimed \"Orange Man\" advertisement for the orange flavour. Several of the agency's advertisements for the brand had proven controversial, but by 1994, the brand's ongoing \"You Know When You've Been Tango'd\" campaign had helped Tango double its share on the soft drinks market. The campaign had finished in 1995 when Tango focused on individual advertising for its different flavours. Each flavour was now being advertised with its own campaigns and distinct identities; advertisements for the Orange flavour were largely put on hold whilst Tango Apple advertisements involved imbibers' bizarre sexual fetishes for the product, Tango Lemon advertisements featured the product as the euphoric, ritualistic drink of a fictional cult worshipping their god, Jim, whilst advertisements for the \"Still Tango\" variant warned viewers that the variant was unofficial and that viewers should call a number given on screen, only for callers to be greeted with the news that it was a trick.\n\nWhen Tango Blackcurrant launched as the fourth official flavour of Tango in 1995–96, an advertisement for the flavour entitled \"Trade\" was created in which Britvic's National Sales Manager Nigel Harrison announces several promotional tie-ins, but which are then denounced by his colleague Sunhil Patel because \"this stuff with sell itself anyway.\" Nonetheless it is disputed whether the advertisement was ever aired, and in early 1996, Tango began planning for their re-launch in July 1996 with a new logo; the planning included \"re-launching\" Tango Blackcurrant with a brand new advertisement, introducing not just the flavour's new logo but indeed widening knowledge of the flavour itself; the plan effectively rendered \"Trade\" a standalone advertisement.\nContinuing their focus on instigating advertisements for flavours of Tango other than Orange, David Atter of Britvic re-hired HHLC + Partners to create the new Tango Blackcurrant advertisement. The original plan was to create a commercial that was only 30 seconds long and was intended to be an attack on Coca-Cola, who had dominated the soft drinks market. The advertisement soon evolved into the radically different \"St George\", which they planned as a 90-second advertisement–the longest Tango advertisement so far–which would not attack Coca-Cola but instead present the drink as very \"British\" and present another confrontational style of advertising the product. The decision to make the advertisement longer came from both Tango's desire to surprise its customers and because the only soft drink brand that could afford to do such a long commercial was Coca-Cola. Using a majority of the advertisement's budget on the production (rather than airtime) and only airing it 10 times was a risk that Tango believed was worth taking. HHCL hired television actor Ray Gardner to play a fictionalized version of himself in the advertisement, having worked with him previously when he played the character of Marshall in a 1995 HHCL-created advertisement for the Automobile Association.\n\n\"St George\" was written by Chas Bayfield and Jim Bolton, directed by television drama director Colin Gregg and produced by production company Eclipse on a total campaign budget of £400,000, which remains the largest budget for a Tango advertisement to date. Nonetheless, \"The Independent\" reported the budget to be £500,000. The commercial was filmed over only three days in April 1996. The office section was shot in a new high rise development overlooking East Croydon railway station, the car park was in a business park in Welwyn Garden City and the White Cliffs filmed at St Margaret's at Cliffe, Kent. Gregg explained that the White Cliffs were chosen as a filming location because \"what more British location can you have than the White Cliffs of Dover?\" Ray's office and the White Cliffs were filmed first and the car park sequence was shot to link the two together. Ringcraft Boxing Ring Hire Specialists built the boxing ring used in the advertisement. The flag-wielding extras in Gardner's entourage recorded their chants separately on the same day in the same field. During production of \"St George\", Barth Hulley, who produced the advertisement, also duly shot and directed \"The Making of Blackcurrant Tango\", a fifteen-minute \"making-of\" video. Hulley's brief stated that the making-of video was required in order to be supplied to his client.\n\nThe style of \"St George\" gradually changes from an amateurish corporate video-style piece into an epic, cinematic widescreen piece whilst Gardner is running towards the White Cliffs with his growing entourage. There are several tricks in \"St George\" to give the illusion that it was filmed in one take; Gardner moves from a 20th storey office to the ground floor, then to the office car park and the White Cliffs, all apparently in one take. In fact, Gardner passes a white wall on leaving his office and his position is matched exactly against a white wall on the ground floor. Similarly, Gardner’s position as he passes a Tango truck in the car park had to be replicated exactly to match his actions as he passes the truck on the White Cliffs. The usage of music in the advertisement–an unfinished remix of Felix's \"Don't You Want Me\"–marked the first time since 1991, and the first time since HHCL began creating Tango advertisements, that a Tango commercial featured a musical soundtrack.\nThere were several problems during production; Gardner needed to step out of his trousers as he leaves the building, something which needed nearly thirty takes to get right, and Gregg cancelled his idea for Gardner to start running after taking a sip of Tango Blackcurrant because it implies the drink has given him energy. Production was not helped by how the fact that on the first two days of filming, the weather was fine but on the third, it snowed. Due to health and safety regulations, the crew were not allowed to use real Harrier jets on the day–the planes were computer generated afterwards by the digital visual effects company, Framestore CFC.\n\nUnlike many television advertisements, \"St George\" does not feature a slogan, nor indeed is the Tango logo ever superimposed on the screen in its final moments; however, \"St George\" is not free of Tango branding: The Tango offices depicted in \"St George\" suitingly features numerous staff members from Britvic, as well as several Tango branded items, such as the \"Tango doll\"–taken from a 1995 campaign, a Tango Blackcurrant vending machine, a Still Tango poster and a Tango door sticker, whilst outside the offices is a Tango sign Tango Blackcurrant delivery lorry, and later on in the advertisement, Gardner's entourage Tango Blackcurrant flags whilst Gardner himself wears a Tango-branded boxing shorts and cape, whose Tango logo was stitched on the day of filming.\n\n\"St George\" premièred on British television on 1 October 1996. As the majority of the advertisement's budget was put into production instead of airtime, \"St George\" only ever aired on television ten times, mostly during advert breaks during the Channel 4 series \"TFI Friday\"; one commentary later clarified that \"St George\" aired once a week for six weeks during \"TFI Friday\". Public relations firm Freud Communications worked with Britvic in publicising \"St George\" by making \"a celebrity\" out of the otherwise unknown Ray Gardner, arranging for him to be interviewed on television and in the newspapers. David Atter, international marketing manager for Tango, explained to \"PR Week\" that \"as a youth product, Blackcurrant Tango was particularly adaptable and flexible. We didn’t need to have a well-known celebrity to reach our audience.\" Scheduling the commercial in advert breaks of \"TFI Friday\" alone was considered unusual, even revolutionary, at the time. The idea came from George Michaelides of Michaelides & Bednash. Vizeum UK's joint managing director, Matt Andrews, considered Michaelides to be a worthy candidate for a legacy prize at the 2006 Channel 4 TV Planning Awards, citing his scheduling idea for the advertisement as a reason. Andrews explained:\n\nAn unreleased and unfinished remix of hardbag musician Felix's 1992 song \"Don't You Want Me\" features in \"St George\"; by the time of the broadcast of the advertisement, the remix had been updated to become the \"'96 Pugilist Mix\", featuring samples of Ray Gardner's dialogue from the advertisement. This version was released as a single on 4 October 1996 by Deconstruction Records on CD, cassette and purple-coloured seven-inch vinyl to coincide with the Tango Blackcurrant and \"St George\" launch. The single features the Tango Blackcurrant logo several times in its packaging, and reached number 17 on the UK Singles Chart in October 1996. In the remix's music video, the \"St George\" samples were modified to remove mentions of Tango Blackcurrant, but the original version later featured on the hits compilation \"Hits 97\". On 13 October, the campaign continued when customers who bought \"The Mail on Sunday\" at branches of Esso Snack & Shop were each given a free can of Tango Blackcurrant.\n\n\"St George\" was an instant critical and commercial success. Peter York of \"The Independent\" stated that \"the launch of Blackcurrant Tango provides the opportunity for a fizzy drink to make a unique political statement - indeed an intervention. The European Movement will no doubt object strenuously.\" He noted the advertisement's diversion from the norm, saying \"Roy displays a patriotic body of a kind never normally seen in TV commercials: white, with a proudly cantilevered beer-belly and two pendulous crescent breastettes. British as they come, the Roy Gardner body speaks for pork pies, British lager, and full-cream dairy products. It defies gymnasia and sunbathing.\" He called it \"a simply brilliant launch\".\n\nIn 1997, the Institute of Contemporary Arts included it in their \"Assuming Positions\" exhibition. The exhibit examined how art could be created from a number of unexpected sources. Kate Bush, curator of the exhibition, said \"St George\" was used because it was \"technically brilliant as well as self-knowing\": \"It starts off dull and builds to a wonderful cinematic climax. You could read it as real laddishness and repugnant xenophobia, but at the same time you known it knows all that about itself and is a parody. This helps it transcend being an advert and becomes art.\" Mike Cozens, creative director of Young & Rubicam, praised the advertisement and said \"it's been a great hit with punters as well as with advertising juries, which doesn't always follow. It's good to see such a mainstream brand like this winning awards for its advertising; it's often more obscure brands that win, which is sometimes questionable.\"\n\nImpressed with Gardner's performance in \"St George\", the advertisement's producer Barth Hulley asked him to star in his short film \"Up and Running\". Despite \"St George\"s popularity in the public eye, it was also nonetheless controversial; it was also one of the top 10 most complained about adverts reported to the Independent Television Commission (ITC) in 1996, as 68 complainants citied it as 'insulting and xenophobic'. The ITC dismissed the complaints, characterising the humour as harmless and likening it to what viewers might see on \"Fawlty Towers\". Letters of complaint from French exchange students who did not see the humour in the advertisement were ridiculed in newspaper inserts.\n\n\"St George\" was a major success in the industry and won a string of awards. A year after its premiere, Paul McCann of \"The Independent\" said that \"St George\" \"has won nearly every advertising award in Britain.\" In March 1997, \"St George\" won HHCL Partners the British Creative Circle award for best advertisement of the year. The commercial, which was honoured in the platinum section, also won the gold award for best use of humour, as did its sister advert for Tango Apple. In May, \"St George\" won the D&AD \"Silver Pencil\" design award for best advert of the year, in June, \"St George\" won a Cannes \"Gold Lion\" award for being a top-tier advertisement, and in November 1997, \"St George\" was selected as the grand prize winner from among 7,000 entries from 78 countries at the London International Advertising Awards. It has also been listed on many industry \"advert of the year\" lists, and won the \"ITV gold award\" at the British Television Advertising Awards.\n\nIn later times, \"St George\" continued to receive acclaim. In as early as May 1997, \"St George\" was named \"ad of the decade\" in a survey of readers of \"Sky Magazine\", beating Levi's 1995 \"Planet\" advertisement. It has been voted one of the 100 best commercials of all time. Bernice Kanner included \"St George\" in his 1999 list book \"100 Best TV Commercials: And Why They Worked\". It won the Film Four \"Best Long Commercial 1956-2001\" award in June 2007, whilst Gardner was honoured with the Channel 4 \"Director's Cut\" Gold Award that same summer, where the advertisement was awarded top honours in the \"Vintage Category\". Ray Gardner later won the \"ITV Best Actor In A Commercial\" Award for his performance. In 2008, advertising industry publication \"Campaign Live\" ranked \"St George\" at number 2 in their list of the \"Top 10 Funniest TV Ads of All Time\". In 2013, Ben Tollett and Emer Stamp, joint creative directors of Adam & Eve DDB, included the advert in his list of \"3 Great Ads I Had Nothing to Do With\", part of a series for \"Campaign Live\".\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, the original Hooj-produced \"Hooj Mix\" version of \"Don't You Want Me\", which features in \"St George\" in an early variation of its specially created \"'96 Pugilist Mix\", was included on several commercially successful, TV-advertised British various artists compilation albums of popular music featured in acclaimed television advertisements, including Virgin Records' \"The Best TV Ads...Ever!\" (2000), which was part of \"The Best...Album in the World...Ever!\" compilation strand, and Telstar Records's \"Switched On: The Cool Sound of TV Advertising\" (2001). The compilations were both released on CD, with \"The Best TV Ads...Ever!\" also being released on cassette, and reached number 10 and 9 in the UK Compilation Chart respectively.\n\nTango themselves parodied \"St George\" in a HHCL-created advertisement for the orange flavour entitled \"Vote Orange Tango\". The advertisement, broadcast in March 1997 in the run up to the General Election, takes the form of a mock party political broadcast where a Tango Orange campaigner criticizes the Apple, Lemon and Blackcurrant variants of the drink individually; his remarks against the blackcurrant flavour see him walk to the roof of a building where the character of Ray Gardner (portrayed by an actor other than Gardner) is still shown expressing his anger against Sebastian, but is clearly exhausted, and ultimately falls into a puddle. The spokesperson criticizes \"Blackcurrant Tango\" as \"stinky wind\" and \"lets off\" an inflatable Ray Gardner. The advertisement was broadcast in the first ever advert break on Channel 5.\n\nDespite his ties to the blackcurrant flavour, Gardner himself later appeared in two advertisements for the orange flavour. The first of these advertisements, \"Clowns\", aired between late 1997 and early 1998 and showed him encouraging a colleague at an event where clowns were being run over by giant trucks. The advertisement was released to promote the send-away Tango Horn toy, but Tango themselves appeared to deem the advert a failure when a further advertisement in early 1998 humorously dismissed the advert as such. Gardner's second Tango Orange advertisement aired in mid-1998 during the 1998 FIFA World Cup and showed Gardner advertising a competition to win television sets as part of the brand's World Cup promotions. He sported the same uniform as in the start of \"St George\". Additionally, Gardner appeared in several wraparound stings (break bumpers) during ITV's coverage of the World Cup where he is shown exploring Paris between games, although these stings do not feature Tango branding.\n\nDespite the success of \"St George\", there were no further advertisements for Tango Blackcurrant, and the flavour was discontinued after several years. Post-\"St George\" Tango advertising prior to 2000 focused mainly on the Tango brand as a whole or on the orange and diet orange flavours, and the blackcurrant variant was dropped before their more eclectic advertising would return in the millennium. Tango Blackcurrant was relaunched as an Asda-exclusive flavour in August 2011 and as a standard flavour in December 2012. Nonetheless, \"St George\" remains the final advertisement for the drink, with Tango having seldom advertised on television in the 2010s.\n\n"}

{"id": "2100423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2100423", "title": "Vauxhall Gardens", "text": "Vauxhall Gardens\n\nVauxhall Gardens was a pleasure garden in Kennington on the south bank of the River Thames and accessed by boat from London until the erection of Vauxhall Bridge in the 1810s. The wider area was absorbed into the metropolis as the city expanded in the early to mid-19th century.\n\nIt was one of the leading venues for public entertainment in London, from the mid-17th century to the mid-19th century. Originally known as 'New Spring Gardens', the site is believed to have opened before the Restoration of 1660, the first known mention being made by Samuel Pepys in 1662. The Gardens consisted of several acres of trees and shrubs with attractive walks. Initially entrance was free, with food and drink being sold to support the venture.\n\nThe site became Vauxhall Gardens in 1785 and admission was charged for its many attractions. The Gardens drew all manner of people and supported enormous crowds, with its paths being noted for romantic assignations. Tightrope walkers, hot-air balloon ascents, concerts and fireworks provided entertainment. The rococo \"Turkish tent\" became one of the Gardens' structures, the interior of the Rotunda became one of Vauxhall's most viewed attractions, and the \"chinoiserie\" style was a feature of several buildings. A statue depicting George Frideric Handel, erected in the Gardens, later found its way to Westminster Abbey. In 1817 the Battle of Waterloo was re-enacted, with 1,000 soldiers participating.\n\nIt closed in 1840 after its owners suffered bankruptcy, but re-opened in 1841. It changed hands in 1842, and was permanently closed in 1859. The land was redeveloped in the following decades, but slum clearance in the late 20th century saw part of the original site opened up as a public park. This was initially called Spring Gardens and renamed in 2012 as Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens. It is managed as a public park by the London Borough of Lambeth. Vauxhall Gardens is depicted in a tile motif at Vauxhall tube station, done in about 1971 by George Smith.\n\nEminent 18th-century scholar John Barrell, writing in the \"Times Literary Supplement\", brings out Vauxhall's significance. \"Vauxhall pleasure gardens, on the south bank of the Thames, entertained Londoners and visitors to London for 200 years. From 1729, under the management of Jonathan Tyers, property developer, impresario, patron of the arts, the gardens grew into an extraordinary business, a cradle of modern painting and architecture, and ... music ... A pioneer of mass entertainment, Tyers had to become also a pioneer of mass catering, of outdoor lighting, of advertising, and of all the logistics involved in running one of the most complex and profitable business ventures of the eighteenth century in Britain.\" References to Vauxhall are, for 150 years, as ubiquitous as references to \"Broadway\" later would be.\n\nThe Gardens are believed to have opened just before the Restoration of 1660, on property formerly owned by Jane Fauxe, or Vaux, widow, in 1615. Whereas John Nichols in his \"History of Lambeth Parish\" conjectures that she was the widow of Guy Fawkes, executed in 1606, John Timbs in his 1867 \"Curiosities of London\" states for a fact that there was no such connection, and that the Vaux name derives from one Falkes de Breauté, a mercenary working for King John who acquired the land by marriage. Jane is stated to be the widow of John, a vintner. Perhaps the earliest record is Samuel Pepys' description of a visit he made to the New Spring Gardens on 29 May 1662. The then name distinguished the gardens from the Old Spring Gardens at Charing Cross; however Pepys implies that there were both Old and New Spring Gardens at Vauxhall; and indeed Spring Gardens appears to have been a longstanding appellation for a variety of entertainment enterprises.\n\nThe Gardens consisted of several acres laid out with walks. Initially admission was free, the proprietors making money by selling food and drink. John Evelyn described \"the New Spring Garden at Lambeth\" as a \"very pretty contrived plantation\" in 1661. John Aubrey, in his \"Antiquities of Surrey\" gives the following account:\nAt Vauxhall, Sir Samuel Morland built a fine room, anno 1667, the inside all of looking-glass, and fountains very pleasant to behold, which is much visited by strangers: it stands in the middle of the garden, covered with Cornish slate, on the point of which he placed a punchinello, very well carved, which held a dial, but the winds have demolished it.\n\nA plan of 1681 shows the circular central feature planted with trees and shrubs, and the formal allées that were to remain a feature as long as the Gardens lasted.\n\nSir John Hawkins, in his \"General History of Music\" (1776), says:\nThe house seems to have been rebuilt since the time that Sir Samuel Morland dwelt in it. About the year 1730, Mr. Jonathan Tyers became the occupier of it, and, there being a large garden belonging to it, planted with a great number of stately trees, and laid out in shady walks, it obtained the name of Spring Gardens; and the house being converted into a tavern, or place of entertainment, was much frequented by the votaries of pleasure. Mr. Tyers opened it with an advertisement of a \"Ridotto al Fresco\", a term which the people of this country had till that time been strangers to. These entertainments were repeated in the course of the summer, and numbers resorted to partake of them. This encouraged the proprietor to make his garden a place of musical entertainment, for every evening during the summer season. To this end he was at great expense in decorating the gardens with paintings; he engaged a band of excellent musicians; he issued silver tickets at one guinea each for admission, and receiving great encouragement, he set up an organ in the orchestra, and, in a conspicuous part of the garden, erected a fine statue of Mr. Handel.\n\nThe 'supposed' last night of the gardens was on 5 September 1839 when it attracted 1089 people. Vauxhall was sold at auction on 9 September 1841 for £20,000, following bankruptcy of the owners, after which it re-opened, but it was permanently closed in 1859, and most of the land sold for building purposes.\n\nThe Spring Gardens were the most prominent vehicle in England for the public display of the new Rococo style. The earliest pictorial representation of Tyers' Spring Gardens, Vauxhall, is the \"Vauxhall fan\" (1736), an etching printed in blue designed to be pasted to a fan; it shows the earliest groups of pavilions, in a sober classical taste, but the interiors of the supper boxes were painted by members of Hogarth's St. Martin's Lane Academy, prominent among them Francis Hayman. Hayman provided most of the subjects, which were rapidly executed by students and assistants; Hubert Gravelot provided designs for two others, and Hogarth's designs were pressed into service in hastily dashed-off copies that filled the back of every box. At a certain hour, all the paintings were let down at once, to offer some security to the companies at supper and a suitable backdrop, one observer thought, for the live beauties of London. Frederick, Prince of Wales, who had come to England with his father George II in 1728 and who was a prominent patron of the Rococo, took sufficient interest in the Gardens to have his own pavilion built from the very first.\n\nThe first fully Rococo structure erected at the Spring Gardens, Vauxhall, was the \"Turkish Tent\" that was still a novelty in 1744; \"this fantastic structure introduced that element of frivolous impermanence which became so characteristic of Vauxhall,\" David Coke has remarked. In the course of the 1740s it was joined by other examples of Rococo \"chinoiserie\" and above all by the Rotunda, with the most-viewed Rococo interior decoration in England, designed by George Michael Moser, another member of the St. Martin's Lane Academy; the ornaments were \"Executed by French and Italians\" George Vertue noted.\n\nEnormous crowds could be accommodated at Spring Gardens, Vauxhall. In 1749 a rehearsal of Handel's \"Music for the Royal Fireworks\" attracted an audience of 12,000, and in 1786 a fancy-dress jubilee to celebrate the proprietor's long ownership was thronged with 61,000 revellers. Many of the best known musicians and singers of the day performed at the Gardens, for example Sophia Baddeley. In 1732, their fashionable status was confirmed by a fancy dress ball attended by Frederick, Prince of Wales. At that time access from the West End was by water, but the opening of Westminster Bridge in the 1740s made access easier though less charming.\n\nThe main walks were lit at night by hundreds of lamps. Over time more features and eyecatchers were added: additional supper boxes, a music room, a Chinese pavilion, a gothic orchestra that accommodated fifty musicians, and ruins, arches, statues and a cascade. An admission charge was introduced from the beginning and later James Boswell wrote:\nVauxhall Gardens is peculiarly adapted to the taste of the English nation; there being a mixture of curious show, — gay exhibition, musick, vocal and instrumental, not too refined for the general ear; — for all of which only a shilling is paid; and, though last, not least, good eating and drinking for those who choose to purchase that regale.\n\nThe unlighted 'dark walks' or 'close walks' were known as a place for amorous adventures. Thomas Brown in \"Works Serious and Comical in Prose and Verse\" (1760) says:The ladies that have an inclination to be private, take delight in the close walks of Spring-Gardens, where both sexes meet, and mutually serve one another as guides to lose their way; and the windings and turnings in the little wildernesses are so intricate, that the most experienced mothers have often lost themselves in looking for their daughters.\" \n\nA great part of the entertainment was offered by the well-dressed company itself. Pauses between pieces of music were intentionally long enough to give the crowd time to circulate the Gardens anew. M. Grosely, in his \"Tour to London\" (1772) says, relating to Ranelagh Gardens and Vauxhall:\nThese entertainments, which begin in the month of May, are continued every night. They bring together persons of all ranks and conditions; and amongst these, a considerable number of females, whose charms want only that cheerful air, which is the flower and quintessence of beauty. These places serve equally as a rendezvous either for business or intrigue. They form, as it were, private coteries; there you see fathers and mothers, with their children, enjoying domestic happiness in the midst of public diversions. The English assert, that such entertainments as these can never subsist in France, on account of the levity of the people. Certain it is, that those of Vauxhall and Ranelagh, which are guarded only by outward decency, are conducted without tumult and disorder, which often disturb the public diversions of France. I do not know whether the English are gainers thereby; the joy which they seem in search of at those places does not beam through their countenances; they look as grave at Vauxhall and Ranelagh as at the Bank, at church, or a private club. All persons there seem to say, what a young English nobleman said to his governor, \"Am I as joyous as I should be\"?\n\nThe new name Vauxhall Gardens, long in popular use, was made official in 1785. After Boswell's time the admission charge rose steadily: to two shillings in 1792, three-and-sixpence in the early 19th century, and 4/6 in the 1820s. Season tickets were also sold. Entertainment in this period included hot-air balloon ascents, fireworks, and tightrope walkers. In 1813 there was a fête to celebrate victory at the Battle of Vitoria, and in 1827 the Battle of Waterloo was re-enacted by 1,000 soldiers.\n\nThe contributor to the \"Edinburgh Encyclopedia\" (1830 edition) comments that:\nCharles Dickens wrote of a daylight visit to Vauxhall Gardens, in \"Sketches by Boz\", published in 1836:\nWe paid our shilling at the gate, and then we saw for the first time, that the entrance, if there had been any magic about it at all, was now decidedly disenchanted, being, in fact, nothing more nor less than a combination of very roughly-painted boards and sawdust. We glanced at the orchestra and supper-room as we hurried past—we just recognised them, and that was all. We bent our steps to the firework-ground; there, at least, we should not be disappointed. We reached it, and stood rooted to the spot with mortification and astonishment. That the Moorish tower—that wooden shed with a door in the centre, and daubs of crimson and yellow all round, like a gigantic watch-case! That the place where night after night we had beheld the undaunted Mr. Blackmore make his terrific ascent, surrounded by flames of fire, and peals of artillery, and where the white garments of Madame Somebody (we forget even her name now), who nobly devoted her life to the manufacture of fireworks, had so often been seen fluttering in the wind, as she called up a red, blue, or party-coloured light to illumine her temple!\n\nThe Gardens feature in a number of other works of literature. They are the scene of a brief but pivotal turning point in the fortunes of anti-heroine Becky Sharp in Thackeray's 19th-century novel \"Vanity Fair\", as well as a setting in his novel \"Pendennis\". Thomas Hardy sets scenes in his \"The Dynasts\" in the Gardens. In \"Cecilia\" by Frances Burney the Gardens are where the character Mr Harrell commits suicide.\n\nThe Gardens passed through several hands. In 1840, the owners went bankrupt and the Gardens closed. They were revived the following year, and again in 1842 under new management, but in 1859 they closed for good.\n\n\n\n\n"}
