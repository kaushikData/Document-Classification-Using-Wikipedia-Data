{"id": "33291633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33291633", "title": "17 Miracles", "text": "17 Miracles\n\n17 Miracles is a 2011 film directed by T. C. Christensen. It was released in 2011 by Excel Entertainment Group. Based on the experiences of members of the Willie Handcart Company of Mormon pioneers following their late-season start and subsequent winter journey to Salt Lake City in 1856, the film emphasizes miracles individual participants reported having during the journey. The film was released in select theaters across the United States in the summer of 2011.\nWhen Levi Savage, a former Mormon Battalion member and missionary to Asia, agrees to assist the Willie Handcart Company as they journey to Salt Lake City in 1856, the late start and onset of a bitter winter leaves the pioneers unprepared and suffering as they cross the plains of the Midwestern United States. Elizabeth Panting, a woman who has converted to the LDS Church, escapes her drunken husband with her two little children, joining the handcart company. With the threat of winter starvation, illness, wolves, freezing river crossings, and death following them throughout their journey, Levi and others also witness the occurrences of divine miracles that enable them to complete their journey and arrive in Salt Lake City.\n\n\nWritten and directed by T. C. Christensen (\"The Work and the Glory\", \"The Testaments\", \"Only a Stonecutter\"), and produced by Ron Tanner and Christensen, \"17 Miracles\" debuted on June 2, 2011, in select theaters in Utah, and then across the United States. The film was subsequently released on DVD and Blu-ray for distribution by Excel Entertainment Group through Deseret Book and affiliated retailers.\n\nCritic Sean P. Means of \"The Salt Lake Tribune\" gave the film a mixed review. He thought that Christensen's eye for striking cinematography gave the film a \"glossy look\" and Wade's portrayal of the hardy Levi Savage \"held the film together.\" However, Means suggested that the film's structure as a series of vignettes was \"wearying\" and some of the low-budget effects were \"distracting.\"\n\n\n"}

Among the many responses was an account from an apparently impeccable source which claimed to be true. A letter from Mr. A. Howard Linford MA, of Magdalen College, Oxford, the headmaster of Peterborough Lodge, Hampstead's largest prep school, claimed to have found an account of the \"Mary Celeste\" among papers given to him by an old servant, Abel Fosdyk, on his deathbed. In addition to Fosdyk's supposed manuscript, Linford included as support a photograph of a little girl plus some drawings made by Linford's son. The account appeared in the November 1913 edition of \"The Strand Magazine\" under the title \"Abel Fosdyk's Story\".\n\nFosdyk's papers say that he had to leave the United States quickly due to some misfortunes, and being a friend to Captain Benjamin Briggs, he convinced the captain to allow him on board. While at sea, Captain Briggs had a carpenter build a high special deck on the quarterdeck for his young daughter and wife, that would allow them a better view while at sea.\n\nAccording to Fosdyk's account, which is set down in the manner of a diary, one day Captain Briggs engaged in a lighthearted dispute with the mate about how well a man could swim with his clothes on. Captain Briggs and the mate then exchange clothes and jump overboard, and began swimming around the vessel. Captain Briggs' wife and child, Fosdyk, and some other members of the crew stepped up onto the specially built deck for a better view of the fun.\n\nSuddenly, one swimming crew member screamed in agony. Looking around, they saw that he was being attacked by a shark, and he quickly disappeared under the water. The remaining members of the crew also ran up onto the specially built deck to better see what was happening, and it promptly collapsed, tossing them all into the sea and leaving no one on board the \"Mary Celeste\".\n\nWhat followed, by Fosdyk's account, was a splashing confusion, with sharks attacking all those in the water, with the exception of Fosdyk, who by accident had landed on top of the shattered piece of deck. The \"Mary Celeste\" floated away from their location and by the time the shark attack was over, Fosdyk was the only survivor, and he was unable to reach the ship. He floated for several days, thirsting for water and suffering from exposure, finally washing ashore on the coast of Africa. Fearful of retribution due to the outlandish details of his story, he never revealed the incident to anyone. It only came to light after his death because Linford went public with it.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13981266", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13981266", "title": "Angry Video Game Nerd", "text": "Angry Video Game Nerd\n\nAngry Video Game Nerd (abbreviated as AVGN, and originally known as Bad NES Games and Angry Nintendo Nerd) is an American adult comedy retrogaming web series, created by and starring James Rolfe. The series centers on Rolfe's character \"The Nerd\", a short-tempered and foul-mouthed video game fanatic who delivers commentary on retro games he considers to be of poor quality. While the series began with Rolfe simply playing games while delivering a running commentary, the show would eventually grow in scope to encompass sketches featuring guest characters, reviews of gaming consoles and peripherals, and short lectures about video game history and culture.\n\nStarting out as an independent filmmaker, Rolfe intended for his earliest videos of the Nerd character to be a joke privately shown to his friends. In 2004, with collaboration from his friend Mike Matei, Rolfe put the \"Angry Nintendo Nerd\" videos on his website, Cinemassacre.com. In 2006, Matei persuaded Rolfe to put his work on YouTube, where it gained in popularity. In 2007, the series became a program on ScrewAttack and GameTrailers, where it was renamed \"The Angry Video Game Nerd\" to avoid trademark issues with Nintendo, and to allow Rolfe to review games from non-Nintendo consoles. From there, the series became a cult success, and Rolfe began appearing as the character in various other media such as a feature-length film and video games, and many public appearances.\n\nAngry Video Game Nerd is considered one of the pioneers of internet review videos, being highly influential on the style and format of subsequent video reviewers as well as being responsible for helping to bring the concept into the mainstream.\n\nThe show revolves around the Nerd's commentary of retro video games which he deems to be of particularly low quality, unfair difficulty, or poor design. Rolfe's character, \"the Nerd\", is a short-tempered and foul-mouthed video game fanatic who satirically reviews old video games in the form reminiscent of insult comedies such as \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\". The Nerd plays the game while talking about its various problems, technicalities and imperfections, mixed with profanity, in an effort to warn people against playing the game, and sometimes with a short lecture about the gaming era's history.\n\nDressed up as a stereotypical nerd in his basement, the Nerd reviews the game with his trademark eyeglasses and white collared shirt with a pocket full of pens, high khaki pants and white socks and loafers, while sometimes being bombarded by guest characters from video games and popular culture as well. These guests often provide additional commentary on the games, mock the Nerd's anguish, and act as parodies of the characters from which they had been derived. In response to them and to the games, the Nerd derives comic appeal from excessive and surrealistic use of fantasy scenarios, anger, and consumption of Rolling Rock (in addition to Yuengling in later videos) while reviewing video games. His anger and profanity over these bad games would sometimes climax in him destroying whole game cartridges, or simulating defecating on, burning, and sometimes even crushing entire video game consoles.\n\nIn many cases, the Nerd dresses up as other popular characters while reviewing their games, such as Batman and Indiana Jones. Other characters in the show include Shit Pickle (an earlier character created by Rolfe), Guitar Guy (played by Kyle Justin, co-worker of the show's theme song), the Game Glitch Gremlin, Super Mecha Death Christ 2000 B.C. Version 4.0 Beta, and an assortment of others, while also the occasional guest appearance by other video game reviewers such as Pat the NES Punk.\n\nJames Rolfe's first videos were intended as \"just a joke\", with no intentions of making them public, showing them only to his friends. In May 2004, Rolfe created his first on-camera game reviews just for fun; utilizing insult commentary with exaggerated bewilderment to two games; \"\" and \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" under the title of \"Bad NES Games\", which would later become the signature of the Nerd character. Rolfe explained later in an interview for \"Daily News\" that the joke was just how upset one obsessive gamer could get over these games that were already 20 years old. Although the \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" review was intended to be the last, Rolfe's friends, who enjoyed the previous “Bad NES Games” reviews, encouraged him to create another. Collaborative friend Mike Matei helped in producing and publishing the videos on Cinemassacre, and released outside of the website as \"The Quickies\" tape, part of a four VHS tape set called the \"Cinemassacre Gold Collection\".\n\nIn 2006, Rolfe began making the episodes available on YouTube. Soon, Rolfe released a review of \"The Karate Kid\" game which was the first episode where Rolfe's character is introduced as “The Angry Nintendo Nerd”. Naming these videos “The Angry Nintendo Nerd Trilogy”, Rolfe posted them on Cinemassacre. The success of the show made Rolfe branch out into other gaming systems, and would later change the title into the \"Angry Video Game Nerd\" to prevent trademark issues with Nintendo. Rolfe diversified the reviews of platforms and products such as the Atari 2600, Super NES, Sega Master System and Sega Genesis video game consoles, the Power Glove and U-Force peripherals, films such as \"The Wizard\", and the \"Nintendo Power\" magazine. He also reviewed Sonic '06 on Xbox 360 and on PC.\n\nOn September 12, 2006, Rolfe's series received mainstream attention when his review of \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" went viral on YouTube. In an article by writer Alex Carlson, he explained that before 2004, video gaming criticism was mostly reserved for the larger game magazines and websites. These already established names were made up mostly of professional writers and journalists that were seldom challenged, and doesn't entirely correspond to the opinions of the average gamers. Video portals and online videos were at its infancy. Carlson stated that the Nerd popularized independent viral video reviews made from the perspective of an average gamer. It was a purely independent in nature, from the simple and old-school cinematography right down to the camcorder-based video editing. He stated that afterwards, \"everyone with a webcam and Fraps can now become a critic and don a characterized mentality, spouting profanities at will without getting censored.\" Since then, the show has increased substantially in quantity, production value, and fandom. Rolfe began infusing various episodes with emphasis on homemade special effects and narratives. The first of these cinematic episodes was a review of the 1989 \"Friday the 13th\" game in October 2006, featuring expressive lighting and camera angles to emphasize its horror film-themed narrative in which the Nerd is attacked by Jason Voorhees for disliking the game. Later episodes have alternated from straightforward game reviews to those with a narrative focus resembling a documentary, with Rolfe pointing out information about the game or gaming console under review. When asked if the Nerd is going to make reviews in the current generation of video games, Rolfe replied that the “show is all about nostalgia,” adding that he's “mostly a retro gamer.\"\n\nIn late 2007, Rolfe halted the production of the series after suffering from a break in his voice. On March 17, 2010, he publicly announced that he was suffering from burnout as a result of stress from his constant work, and that the show would be entering a brief hiatus. The show was resumed a month later; however, only one episode is released each month, as opposed to two episodes per month due to Rolfe's other projects. In late 2011, Rolfe announced the show would be put out of production for a short while so he could work on the AVGN movie. The show eventually resumed production in late summer 2012. Since then, he has self-released Nerd videos on his Cinemassacre website and YouTube account in a very sporadic manner in order to balance his personal life with the other projects he continuously works on. By 2013, the show garnered more 900,000 subscribers and over 400 million views on YouTube. By 2014, Cinemassacre already had 1.5 million subscribers. Rolfe stated that the show \"got popular right around when YouTube got popular.\"\n\nIn January 2013, the YouTube channel was suddenly shut down due to claims of severe violations of YouTube's terms of service. YouTube later reinstated the channel.\n\nIn March 2016, the channel reached 2 million subscribers, 10 years after the channel's creation and first uploads. Rolfe made a short video to thank all the people who subscribed, watched the videos on the channel and for supporting himself, Mike Matei, and everyone who made Cinemassacre more popular.\n\nRolfe's review of \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" game was reported in an MTV segment called \"Viral Videos Infect the Mainstream\". On November 2, 2008, his videos and personality were featured on the nationally syndicated radio show \"Opie and Anthony\". The Nerd has also become the subject of Howard Stern and David Arquette in an episode of Stern's \"Sirius XM\" show, in which Stern commented negatively on the show's format as well as the gaming community in general during a TooManyGames 2011 convention in Philadelphia. James Rolfe himself appeared as the Nerd in various gaming and internet conventions.\n\nIn September 24, 2008, Rolfe collaborated with internet reviewer Doug Walker to create a fictional feud between his character – Nostalgia Critic – and Rolfe's own. The plot behind the events created between the two was over the Critic's dislike towards comments made to one of his online videos that expressed similarities between him and the Nerd, supposedly written by the Nerd's fans, that were \"unfair comparisons between the two of them\". The pair worked together to create a series of tongue-in-cheek video responses between the two characters, culminating with a fight between the Critic and Nerd in Clifton, New Jersey, a dare between the pair to review something in the other's line of work (Nerd reviews a bad movie, Critic reviews a bad game), and a final fight between the pair in the Nerd's basement on October 10, 2008, which featured parodies and clichés from popular films such as \"The Matrix Reloaded\" and \"\". The resulting series of videos created became a huge hit with fans. To celebrate the first anniversary of the \"ThatGuyWithTheGlasses\" website, both Walker and Rolfe collaborated again on a special video involving their characters, in which the plot focused on the pair meeting once more to battle against the other, in which they were joined by fellow reviewers and contributors to the website who sided with one or the other, culminating with the pair calling a truce and putting their differences aside. Rolfe would later guest star as his character in various \"Channel Awesome\" shows, even appearing to review the \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle\" movie with the Nostalgia Critic, with both the Nerd and Critic making a background cameo appearance in the anime \"Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited\".\n\nOn 21 July 2014, an independent film based on the series, entitled Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie, was released online as well as limited theatrical releases, with DVD and Blu-ray versions released by the end of the year. The film's plot focuses around the Nerd seeking to prove that over 1 million copies of the proclaimed \"worst video game of all time\", \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" for the Atari 2600, were not buried, after being pressured by fans to review the video game. In his quest to prove this to his fans, the Nerd finds himself being pursued by federal authorities who believe he is investigating Area 51 and the crash of an unidentified flying object.\n\nThe film began development in late 2006, following the popularity of the \"Angry Video Game Nerd\" web series, with James Rolfe serving as its director, producer, and co-writer, and reprising his on-screen role as The Nerd. The movie's script was designed to pay homage to the character finally reviewing the \"E.T.\" video game, though filming required Rolfe to balance his schedule with that of his online series and other works. The screenplay was completed by 2008, with the film's budget of more than raised entirely from crowdfunding. As part of its development, Rolfe asked for the show's fanbase to provide webcam footage of themselves fictionally reacting to the Nerd's webseries, to be used as an intro to the film.\n\nAlthough Rolfe has not ruled out the possibility of a sequel to the film, he regards it as highly unlikely due to the amount of time spent developing and filming the \"Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie\" and his focus on other film projects.\n\nIn 2013, an official video game titled \"Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures\" was announced. Developed by FreakZone Games (creators of \"\"), it was released on September 20, 2013 on Steam. The game follows the Nerd attempting to rescue his friends, all of whom were sucked into the Nerd's television set (done in a \"Cheetahmen\"-esque style). The Nerd uses a NES Zapper as his main weapon, and a character known as Naggi the Patronizing Firefly, a parody of Navi from \"\", guides him through the tutorial. Throughout the game, he faces zombies, Mr. Hyde, Custer, The Giant Claw, Fred \"Fucks\" (Fred Fuchs), both Jason Voorhees and an oversized version of Freddy Krueger's right arm (references to the \"Friday the 13th\" and \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" games respectively but their names were changed to Bimmy (Freddy Krueger) and Jimmy (Jason Voorhees) (referencing the infamous typo from \"\") to avoid copyright) and more. On July 12, 2014, it was announced that the game would also be released on Wii U and Nintendo 3DS. The Wii U version was released in North America on April 2, 2015, and released in Europe on December 10, 2015. On June 4, 2015, a 3DS version became available for download in the Nintendo eShop. On July 17 of the same year, during ScrewAttack's annual SGC convention, Freakzone announced a sequel, \"Angry Video Game Nerd II: ASSimilation\", originally due for release in Winter 2015, but delayed to March 29, 2016.\n\nThere have also been some unofficial, fanmade Angry Video Game Nerd games including \"Angry Video Game Nerd's Angry Video Game\", \"Angry Video Game Nerd in Pixel Land Blast\", \"AVGN Game Over\", \"AVGN Game Over 2\", and \"AVGN Planet\". There is also the \"Angry Video Game Nerd\" and \"AVGN K.O. Boxing\", both for the Atari 2600. The Nerd touched upon these games in the episode \"AVGN Games\". The Nerd also appeared as a playable character in the game \"Texting of the Bread\" produced by ScrewAttack.\n\nThe opening song of the show, simply entitled \"The Angry Video Game Nerd Theme Song\", is a staple of the series since its earliest conception. The song was written by Kyle Justin and James Rolfe, and performed by Justin. Over the years, the song had different variations to correspond with specials. Programmer and musician Lachlan Barclay published soundtrack album based on the web-series in 2011. This earliest compilation of the show was created by Barclay due to demands from fans after he played the song on Video XYZ. Another compilation album was released in 2013 containing the music derived from the Nerd's video game. Developed also by FreakZone, the album was released by ScrewAttack Entertainment LLC as a digital download. An album based from the movie was released in 2014 composed by Bear McCreary, who had previously worked with Rolfe on the webseries Christmas special. The film's music was composed of rock-and-roll, heavy metal, a symphonic orchestra, and synthesized musical elements from various gaming systems such as NES, SNES, and SEGA Genesis. The album features two remixes by McCreary as well.\n\nThe \"Angry Video Game Nerd\" show has a cult following, and made James Rolfe one of the most popular internet celebrities before the advent of YouTube. \"The Angry Video Game Nerd\" was voted Best Online Web Series in Mashable's 3rd Annual Open Web Awards on December 16, 2009. \"WatchMojo\" listed the Nerd as #10 in its Top 10 YouTube Celebrities, describing him as that \"one guy playing video games in his parents' basement who made it a career\". Peggy Rajski describes the origin of the show's success stemming from the correct use of the internet as well as the crowd funding system. Rajski further said that \"[Rolfe] already cultivated an audience that cared about his prior work. When he asked them to step up, clearly they were willing to.\" Fellow filmmaker and internet celebrity Doug Walker dubbed the Nerd as the \"Greatest Video Game Critic of All Time\". Jacob Rich of \"Michigan Daily\" described the Nerd as the \"pioneering internet 'gamer' show\", adding that \"pretty much every major game review show online today has 'AVGN' to thank for establishing its format\". The French show \"Joueur du Grenier\" was based on \"Angry Video Game Nerd\".\n\nZach Whalen described the show's presentation of retro gaming into contemporary gamers as \"a process of looking back to an unattainable past and trying to bring that past into the present\". Indeed, Rolfe also commented during an interview with \"The Guardian\" of the show's impact in the current generation of the video game industry, saying that they \"still relate to it and they like learning of the past\". In the same article, reporter Luke Langlands also noted the show's influence of inspiring the creation of other independent online shows. The Nerd's success as an independent celebrity outside of the commercial mainstream of pop culture, popularized the notion of making lifelong careers online. In a survey published by \"Mediscape\", a number of people admitted to being inspired by the Nerd to create and submit their own content in various online spaces, including YouTube, DeviantArt, SourceForge, GameFAQs and ScrewAttack. \"WatchMojo\" also called the Nerd as a \"trendsetter\" for other gamers and amateur reviewers online, influencing the likes of those such as the Nostalgia Critic, Angry Joe and others.\n\nIn his analysis of the show and the character, writer Alex Carlson of \"Hardcore Gamer\", dubbed Rolfe's character as \"The Nerd Who Changed Gaming Culture Forever\". In his written article, he described the Angry Video Game Nerd as \"one of the most recognizable figures in gaming culture\", adding that \"if you're a gamer, it's nearly guaranteed that you've browsed YouTube and seen at least a couple of videos from the series. Nearly a decade after the series' humble inception, James Rolfe's frequently sailor-mouthed alter-ego is still spreading influence. With each new gaming channel appearing on YouTube, there's some level of inspiration coming straight from The Nerd. From the very beginning, The Angry Video Game Nerd was a giant leap forward. Whether James Rolfe knew it or not, the rise of The Nerd was a moment that changed gaming critique and entertainment forever\". On their video of Top 10 Retro Gaming YouTubers, WatchMojo named The Nerd and James Rolfe the number 1 Retro Gaming Youtuber.\n\n"}

{"id": "633739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=633739", "title": "Beyond Good &amp; Evil (video game)", "text": "Beyond Good &amp; Evil (video game)\n\nBeyond Good & Evil is a 2003 action-adventure video game developed and published by Ubisoft for the PlayStation 2, PC, Xbox and GameCube platforms. The story follows the adventures of Jade, an investigative reporter and martial artist, who works with a resistance movement to reveal a planet-wide alien conspiracy. The player controls Jade and allies, solving puzzles, fighting enemies, and obtaining photographic evidence.\n\nMichel Ancel, creator of the \"Rayman\" series, envisioned the game as the first part of a trilogy. The game was developed under the codename \"Project BG&E\" by 30 Ubisoft Pictures employees with production lasting more than three years. One of the main goals of the game is to create a meaningful story while giving players lots of freedom, though the game adopts a relatively linear structure. The game was received poorly when it was shown at E3 2002, and it prompted the developers to change some of the game's elements, including Jade's design. Ancel also attempted to streamline the game in order to make the game more commercially appealing.\n\n\"Beyond Good & Evil\" was critically acclaimed. Critics praised the game's animation, setting, story, and design, but criticized the game's combat and technical issues. The game received a nomination for \"Game of the Year\" at the 2004 Game Developers Choice Awards. While the game had a cult following, it was considered a commercial failure at launch. A full HD re-mastered version of the game was released on Xbox Live Arcade in March 2011 and on PlayStation Network in June 2011. A prequel, \"Beyond Good and Evil 2\", is in development and was announced at E3 2017.\n\n\"Beyond Good & Evil\" is an action-adventure game with elements of puzzle-solving and stealth-based games. The player controls the protagonist, Jade, from a third-person perspective. Jade can run, move stealthily, jump over obstacles and pits, climb ladders, push or bash doors and objects, and flatten herself against walls. As Jade, the player investigates a number of installations in search of the truth about a war with an alien threat.\n\nIn the game's interior spaces, the player solves puzzles and makes their way past enemies in order to reach areas containing photographic evidence. Jade's main tools are her Daï-jo combat staff (a melee weapon), discs for attacking at range, and a camera. Jade's health, represented by hearts, decreases when hit by enemy attacks. It can be restored using fictional food items and can be increased beyond the maximum with \"PA-1s\" that, when held by Jade or her companions, increases their life gauge by one heart. If Jade's health is depleted, the game will restart at the last checkpoint. Certain stealth segments later in the game automatically kill Jade if she is detected.\n\nAt times, it is only possible to advance in the game with the help of other characters. These characters are computer-controlled, and players direct them via contextual commands. For example, the player can order them to perform a \"super attack\", either pounding the ground to bounce enemies into the air, allowing the player to hit them from long distances, or knocking them off balance, making them vulnerable to attack. These allies possess a health bar and are incapacitated if it is depleted. Jade can share some of her items, such as PA-1s, with these characters.\n\nIn addition to obtaining evidence and completing assignments, Jade's camera can take pictures of animal species in exchange for currency, and scan objects to reveal more information about the environment. When the \"Gyrodisk Glove\" is obtained, Jade can attack enemies or activate devices from a distance by using the camera interface. There are also various minigames and sub-missions offered by NPCs scattered throughout the world.\n\nA hovercraft is used to travel around the world, and also used for racing and in other minigames. Later, the spaceship \"Beluga\" is acquired. The hovercraft can dock with the spaceship. Both vehicles require upgrades in order to reach new areas and progress through the game. Upgrades are purchased using pearls that are collected throughout the game, by completing missions, exploring areas, filling in the animal directory or by trading credits for them. The vehicles have a boost ability, and can be repaired using a \"Repair Pod\" if damaged by enemies.\n\n\"Beyond Good & Evil\" takes place in the year 2435 on the mining planet of Hillys, located in a remote section of the galaxy. The architecture of the city around which the game takes place is rustic European in style. The world itself combines modern elements, such as email and credit cards, with those of science fiction and fantasy, such as spaceships and anthropomorphic animals coexisting with humans. As the game begins, Hillys is under siege by aliens called the \"DomZ\", who abduct beings and either drain their life force for power or implant them with spores to convert them into slaves. Prior to the opening of the game, a military dictatorship called the \"Alpha Sections\" has come to power on Hillys, promising to defend the populace. However, the Alpha Sections seem unable to stop the DomZ despite its public assurances. An underground resistance movement, the IRIS Network, fights the Alpha Sections, believing it to be in league with the DomZ.\n\n\"Beyond Good & Evil\"s main protagonist, Jade (voiced by Jodi Forrest), is a young photojournalist. She resides in an island lighthouse that doubles as a home for children orphaned by DomZ attacks. Pey'j (voiced by David Gasman), a boar-like creature, is Jade's uncle and guardian figure. Double H, a heavily built human IRIS operative, assists Jade during missions. He wears a military-issue suit of armor at all times. Secundo, an artificial intelligence built into Jade's storage unit, the \"Synthetic-Atomic-Compressor\" (SAC), offers advice and \"digitizes\" items. The main antagonists are the DomZ High Priest, who is the chief architect of the invasion, and Alpha Sections leader General Kehck, who uses propaganda to gain the Hillyans' trust, even as he abducts citizens to sustain the DomZ.\n\nJade and Pey'j are taking care of the children of Hillys orphaned by the DomZ. When meditating with one of the orphans outside, a DomZ siren sounds. Jade rushes to turn to turn the power on for the shield. She discovers she has run out of credits to pay for the shield. The lighthouse is left vulnerable to the meteor shower. One of the Domz meteors crashes outside of the lighthouse. The DomZ monsters catches each of the children into their bodies. Jade is forced to fight these creatures to free the children. Jade then looks down into the hole left by meteor and is captured by a DomZ Monster. Jade is rescued by Pey'j and they work together to defeat the monster. The Alpha Sections arrive just after Jade defeats the monster. \n\nSecunda finds a photography job for Jade, so that she can pay to turn the power back on for the sheild. The job involves cataloging all the species on Hillys for a science museum. Jade is then contacted by a \"man in black\" to investigate and take pictures of a creature presumed to be DomZ twins in an abondoned mine on an abandoned island. The DomZ twins turns out the be antennae of a very large DomZ monster. Once defeated the \"man in black\" takes off his suit and a taxi car flies out of the black limousine. The man reveals he actually works for IRIS network. \n\nShe is recruited by the IRIS Network, which suspects that the Alpha Sections are behind planet-wide disappearances. Jade's first target of investigation is an Alpha Sections-run ration factory. She discovers evidence of human trafficking orchestrated by the DomZ under the Alpha Sections' authority. Along the way she rescues Double H, who was kidnapped and tortured by the DomZ. Pey'j is abducted by the DomZ and taken to an abandoned slaughterhouse where he and the other kidnapped victims are to be launched to a base on Hillys' moon, Selene. After failing to extract Pey'j from the slaughterhouse in time, Jade learns that he was, in fact, the secret chief of the IRIS Network.\n\nJade learns that the Alpha Sections are being possessed and manipulated by the DomZ. Using \"Beluga\", the ship Pey'j used to travel to Hillys, Jade and Double H go to the DomZ lunar base. There, Jade finds Pey'j dead after weeks of torture, but a strange power inside her brings back his soul, reviving him. After rescuing Pey'j, destroying Kehck's command ship, transmitting her final report, and sparking a revolution, Jade confronts the DomZ High Priest. She learns that her human form is the latest container to hide a power stolen from the DomZ centuries ago in the hope that the High Priest, who must have spirit energy to survive, would starve to death. The High Priest managed to find a substitute energy in the souls of all those kidnapped from Hillys, and captures Pey'j and Double H to force Jade to submit to him. Using the stolen power within her, Jade is able to destroy the High Priest, though nearly losing control of her soul in the process, and then revives and rescues those that have been abducted. In a post-credits scene back on Hillys, a DomZ spore grows on Pey'j's hand as the screen fades to black.\n\n\"Beyond Good & Evil\" was developed by Michel Ancel, the creator of the \"Rayman\" video game, at Ubisoft's Pictures studio in France. The game was developed under the codename \"Project BG&E\", with production lasting more than three years. A group of 30 employees composed the development team. Ubisoft's chief executive officer, Yves Guillemot, fully supported the project and frequently met with the team. After years working on \"Rayman\", Ancel wanted to move on to something different. He recalled that the goal of \"Beyond Good & Evil\" was to \"pack a whole universe onto a single CD—mountains, planets, towns. The idea was to make the player feel like an explorer, with a sense of absolute freedom.\"\n\nA second goal behind \"Beyond Good & Evil\"s design was to create a meaningful story amid player freedom. Ancel said that the linear nature of the gameplay was necessary to convey the story; player freedom was an experience between parts of the plot. He also strove to create a rhythm similar to a movie to engage and delight players. The game drew on many influences and inspirations, including the Miyazaki universe, politics and the media, and the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. In creating the lead character, Ancel's wife reportedly inspired the designer, who wanted to portray a persona with whom players could identify.\n\n\"Beyond Good & Evil\" was first shown publicly at the 2002 Electronic Entertainment Expo, where it received a negative reception. Originally more \"artistically ambitious\" and resembling games like \"Ico\", the game was substantially changed in order to make it more commercially appealing. Jade, originally a teenage girl, was redesigned to be more powerful and befitting of her job. The game was also shortened by removing long periods of exploration, due to Ancel's dislike of this aspect of gameplay in \"\". The development team was \"demoralized\" by the changes, with Ancel commenting that the finished game resembled a sequel more than a reworking. Prior to release, playable previews of the game were offered in movie theaters.\n\nThe soundtrack of \"Beyond Good & Evil\" was composed by Christophe Héral, who was hired by Ancel because of his background in film. Hubert Chevillard, a director with whom Ancel had worked in the past, had also worked with Héral on a television special, \"The Pantin Pirouette\", and referred him to Ancel. Héral was assisted by Laetitia Pansanel, who orchestrated the pieces, and his brother Patrice Héral, who performed some of the sound effects and singing.\n\nThe soundtrack incorporates a wide variety of languages and instruments from around the world. Mainly Bulgarian lyrics were chosen for the song \"Propaganda\", which plays in the game's Akuda Bar, to allude to the Soviet propaganda of the Cold War. It uses a recording of a telephone conversation by Héral with a female Bulgarian friend to represent the government's control of the media. It also incorporates Arabic string instruments and Indian percussion. A song called \"Funky Mullah\" was originally planned for the Akuda Bar, but it was replaced by \"Propaganda\" because Héral decided that its muezzin vocals, recorded on September 8, 2001, would have been in bad taste in the wake of the September 11 attacks. \"Fun and Mini-games\", a song that plays during hovercraft races and other minigames, includes Spanish lyrics. The lyrics for DomZ music were created from a fictional language with prominent rolling \"r\" sounds. The crashing metal sound effects of \"Metal Gear DomZ\", the music played during a boss fight, were recorded from the son of Héral's neighbor playing with scrap metal. The voices in the city of Hillys were also recorded by Héral himself. The music has never been published as an album, though it has been released in its entirety as a free download by Ubisoft. The soundtrack is featured in the Video Games Live international concert tour.\n\nA full HD re-mastered version of the game was developed by Ubisoft Shanghai, released on Xbox Live Arcade in March 2011 and on PlayStation Network in June 2011.\nThe HD edition was made backwards compatible on the Xbox One and available free to Gold members from August 16, 2016 through September 1, 2016 as part of the Games with Gold programme. Ubisoft released \"Beyond Good & Evil HD\" for retail in Europe on September 21, 2012. The retail package includes \"Beyond Good & Evil HD\", \"Outland\" and \"From Dust\".\n\nPrior to its release, \"Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine\" and \"\" praised the game's showing at the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo and described it as one of the best titles on display.\n\n\"Beyond Good & Evil\" received generally positive reviews from critics. Aggregating review website Metacritic gave the Xbox version 87/100, the GameCube version 87/100, the PlayStation 2 version 86/100, the Xbox 360 version 84/100, the PlayStation 3 version 83/100 and the PC version 83/100.\n\nThe game's graphics were generally well received. In reviewing the GameCube version, \"Game Informer\" wrote that \"Every moment of \"Beyond Good & Evil\" looks as good as a traditional RPG cutscene\" and that the game's effects and character animations were \"amazing.\" On the other hand, Jon Hicks of \"PC Format\" wrote that while some effects were excellent, the game's otherwise unspectacular graphics were unwelcome reminders of the game's console roots. 1UP.com and \"Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine\" cited glitches such as frame rate as irksome, because the game did not appear to tax the console's hardware.\n\n\"Edge\" commended the game for its storytelling and design, but criticized its plot as unable to \"match Jade's initial appeal,\" becoming \"fairly mundane\" without \"the darkness and moral ambiguity suggested by the title,\" with Jade's everyman appeal undermined by the revelation of her \"mysterious hidden identity.\" Dan Toose of \"SMH\" called the game's setting \"dark, baroque and earthy, a far cry from the squeaky-clean action of the \"Final Fantasy\" games,\" and described the game as \"a very European take on the role-playing genre\" and \"one of the best adventure games in years.\" Star Dingo of \"GamePro\" commented that the game was a \"jack of all trades, master of none\" that \"never really lives up to its title,\" adding that its vision could have been more focused. Among complaints were control issues and a lack of gameplay depth. \"Game Informer\"s Lisa Mason wrote that the game's controls were serviceable, but simplistic, and that she wished she could do more with the character. \"PC Gamer\"s Kevin Rice found most of the gameplay and its exploration refreshing, but called hovercraft races \"not much fun\" and felt combat was the game's weakest element. \"Edge\" called the gameplay interaction \"hollowed out,\" as an unintended consequence of Ancel's attempt to streamline the game.\n\n\"Beyond Good & Evil\" was not a commercial success. The game saw poor sales upon its release in the 2003 Christmas and holiday season. Retailers quickly decreased the price by up to 80 percent. \"Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine\" staff attributed the poor sales of the game—among many other 2003 releases—to an over-saturated market, and labeled \"Beyond Good & Evil\" as a commercial \"disappointment\". In retrospect, Ancel noted that consumers at the time were interested in established franchises and technologically impressive games. Coupled with the number of \"big titles\" available, he stated that the market was a poor environment for \"Beyond Good & Evil\" and that it would take time to be appreciated. The \"Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine\" staff further commented that the lack of marketing from Ubisoft and the game's odd premise naturally reserved it to obscurity. Part of the disappointing sales stemmed from Ubisoft not knowing how to market the title, something that Ubisoft North America CEO Laurent Detoc labeled as one of his worst business decisions. At the time, Ubisoft's marketing efforts were more focused on the release of \"\". Ubisoft's former North American vice-president of publishing, Jay Cohen, and its European managing director, Alaine Corre, attributed the commercial failure of the game to a lack of marketing. \"The game play was there, the technical excellence was there but perhaps the target audience was not there,\" Corre told the BBC. Corre later commented that the Xbox 360 release (in 2011) \"did extremely well\", but considered this success \"too late\" to make a difference in the game's poor sales. The game was intended to be the first part of a trilogy, but its poor sales placed those plans on hold at the time.\n\n\"Beyond Good & Evil\" was nominated for and won many gaming awards. The International Game Developers Association nominated the title for three honors at the 2004 Game Developers Choice Awards: \"Game of the Year\", \"Original Game Character of the Year\" (Jade) and \"Excellence in Game Design\". Ubisoft titles garnered six of eleven awards at the 2004 IMAGINA Festival in France, with \"Beyond Good & Evil\" winning \"Best Writer\" and \"Game of the Year Team Award.\" The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences nominated the game for \"Outstanding Achievement in Character or Story Development\" at the 2004 Interactive Achievement Awards. In IGN's \"The Best of 2003\", the PlayStation 2 (PS2) version won \"Best Adventure Game,\" while the GameCube version received \"Best Story.\" \"Beyond Good & Evil\"s audio was also recognized. The game was nominated for the \"Audio of the Year\", \"Music of the Year\", \"Best Interactive Score\", and \"Best Sound Design\" awards at the second annual Game Audio Network Guild awards. It was similarly nominated for the \"Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition\" and \"Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design\" awards at the 2004 Interactive Achievement Awards. At the 3rd Annual National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards, the game was nominated for the following categories: \"Game Design\"; \"Original Adventure Game\"; \"Control Design\", winning 2 (\"Game Design\" and \"Original Adventure Game\"). \n\nIn 2007, \"Beyond Good & Evil\" was named 22nd-best Xbox game and 12th-best GameCube game of all time by IGN. \"Game Informer\" listed the title 12th on its \"Top 25 GameCube Games\" list. In another list, \"Top 200 Games of all Time\", \"Game Informer\" placed the PS2, Xbox, and GameCube versions of \"Beyond Good & Evil\" as the 200th best. The \"Official Nintendo Magazine\" ranked it as the 91st-best Nintendo game, while \"Nintendo Power\" ranked it 29th. \"Nintendo Power\" placed the GameCube version as the 11th-best GameCube game of all time in its 20th anniversary issue. Destructoid ranked the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox versions as the 6th-best game of the decade. In 2010, IGN listed it at #34 in their \"Top 100 PlayStation 2 Games\". GamesRadar placed it as the 70th best game of all time.\n\nAncel stated his desire to produce a sequel to the game. Ubisoft announced at the Ubidays opening conference that there would be a second game. A sequel, tentatively titled \"Beyond Good and Evil 2\", is currently in development, although the project was temporarily halted to focus on \"Rayman Origins\". Michel Ancel has hinted that Jade would have a new look for the game. In early 2016, Destructoid published a rumor that the game was being funded by Nintendo as an exclusive to their upcoming console codenamed \"NX\". On September 27, 2016, Michel Ancel posted an image to Instagram with the caption \"Somewhere in system 4 ... - Thanks #ubisoft for making this possible !\". On October 4, Ancel stated that \"Beyond Good and Evil 2\" was in pre-production. Ubisoft confirmed Ancel's claim on October 6, 2016. On June 13th, 2017, during E3 2017 a teaser trailer was released. The game was confirmed to be a prequel, with a focus on a younger Pey'j..\n"}
{"id": "5538718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5538718", "title": "Captain Midnight broadcast signal intrusion", "text": "Captain Midnight broadcast signal intrusion\n\nOn April 27, 1986, American electrical engineer and business owner John R. MacDougall, using the pseudonym Captain Midnight, jammed the Home Box Office (HBO) satellite signal on Galaxy 1 during a showing of the film \"The Falcon and the Snowman\". He broadcast a message lasting four and a half minutes, seen by the eastern half of the United States (accounting for more than half of HBO's 14.6 million subscribers at the time) protesting HBO's rates for satellite dish owners, which he considered too expensive. MacDougall was working at his second job as an operations engineer at the Central Florida Teleport uplink station in Ocala, Florida, and fought with a technician at HBO's communications center in Hauppauge, Long Island, for control of the transmission. The technician attempted to increase uplink power but gave up because of the risk of damaging the satellite. MacDougall eventually abandoned his control of the satellite.\n\nAlthough the intrusion was a minor annoyance to viewers, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated the jamming. After the FCC determined the suitable transmitters and stations equipped with a specific character generator, MacDougall surrendered to the authorities and was served with a court subpoena after a tourist overheard him discussing the incident on a pay phone off Interstate 75. Under an agreement with the prosecutor, he plea bargained and received a $5,000 fine, one year unsupervised probation, and his amateur radio license was suspended for a year. The jamming received much attention in American society, with one executive dubbing the intrusion an act of \"video terrorism\". As a consequence of the incident, the United States Congress passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (18 U.S.C. § 1367), making satellite hijacking a felony. The Automatic Transmitter Identification System was also developed in response to this incident.\n\nBeginning in the 1920s, broadcast television was delivered for free over local frequencies. When the industry began charging viewers for access to its services via cable around this period in time, free broadcasts continued. Starting in the 1970s, a small community of satellite television enthusiasts (mostly engineers) shared the technology and knowledge on how to construct satellite dishes, as well as how to access pay television from the airwaves for free. This was not illegal at the time, and restaurant and hotel chains made use of this technology to distribute programming to guests and patrons without charge.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, controversy erupted in the cable programming world as United States media companies that owned pay television channels began scrambling their programming and charging fees to home satellite dish owners who accessed the same satellite signals that cable operators received. Many satellite dish owners faced the prospect of having to purchase descrambling equipment at a cost of hundreds of dollars, as well as having to pay monthly or annual subscription fees to cable programming providers. Fees for home dish owners were often higher than fees paid by cable subscribers, despite dish owners being responsible for acquiring and servicing their own equipment.\n\nWhen Home Box Office (HBO) began scrambling its signal on a 24-hour basis on January 15, 1986, it offered subscriptions to home dish owners for $12.95 per month ($28.92 in 2017 dollars), which was either equal to or slightly higher than what cable subscribers paid. HBO also advised viewers that purchasing a descrambler for $395 ($882.21 in 2017 dollars) would (along with the monthly fee) allow them to continue watching HBO. Several satellite dish dealers across the United States closed their stores as a result of a reduction in dish sales, caused by the rise in signal scrambling. Satellite dish owners began protests over keeping free access to broadcasts. One such protest was by members of the Satellite Television Industry Association, who converged on Washington, D.C., in March 1986 to urge the United States Congress to protect access to satellite transmissions.\n\nJohn R. MacDougall was born in Elmhurst, Illinois; a western suburb of Chicago. He is the youngest of five children of building contractor Robert MacDougall and his wife Thelma, a homemaker. Shortly after his father's retirement in 1970, the family moved to Florida. He spent his childhood years tinkering with cars and CB radios. MacDougall was brought up in Fort Lauderdale, where he was educated at American Heritage School. After two years of studying in a management engineering program at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, MacDougall abandoned his studies and found employment installing satellite dishes in Ocala.\n\nIn 1983, he opened the satellite dealership MacDougall Electronics in Ocala. The company initially turned a healthy profit, but following the scrambling of HBO's signal on January 15, 1986, its turnover declined. Consequently, he reduced his expenses where possible and in the same month was offered a part-time job at the Central Florida Teleport uplink station (which uplinked services to satellites) as an operations engineer to help him pay his bills. As he was not receiving any customers, MacDougall pulled all company advertising and saved money by switching off his air conditioning. He became increasingly reclusive during this period, watching television and reading magazines. MacDougall later said of the experience: \"I have been watching the great American dream slip from my grasp.\" At 12:49 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) on April 20, one week before the jamming, MacDougall transmitted a color bar test pattern that was superimposed on HBO's signal. This only lasted for a few seconds, and HBO did not investigate the incident as it had occurred during the overnight hours, and as a result very few people had been watching at the time.\n\nOn April 26, 1986, MacDougall worked at his shop as normal, and closed at 4:00 p.m. EST. After eating dinner, he reported to Central Florida Teleport with one other engineer on duty. The second engineer left at 6:00 p.m., leaving MacDougall to operate the building on his own. MacDougall oversaw the uplink of the movie \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\" as part of the evening's programming for the pay-per-view network People's Choice, which used Central Florida Teleport's facilities. After the film ended, he went through his regular routine. Before logging off, MacDougall set up SMPTE color bars and punched buttons on a Microgen MG-100 character generator that placed letters on the television screen. He spent a couple of minutes composing his message. MacDougall began his message with a polite greeting as he did not wish to be insulting. He selected the name \"Captain Midnight\" from a film he had recently seen: \"On the Air Live with Captain Midnight\" (not associated with the popular \"Captain Midnight\" radio show of the 1940s).\n\nDescribed by \"The A.V. Club\" as \"a Reagan-era Robin Hood\", MacDougall swung the transmission dish back into its storage position, which aimed it at the location of Galaxy 1, the satellite that carried HBO. Locating the satellite coordinates was not of great difficulty for MacDougall as frequencies were widely published in manuals and enthusiast magazines. As a protest against the introduction of high fees and scrambling equipment, he transmitted a signal onto the satellite that for four and a half minutes overrode HBO's telecast of the film \"The Falcon and the Snowman\", which had begun two minutes earlier. The five-line text message printed in white capital letters that appeared on the screens of HBO subscribers across the eastern half of the United States (accounting for more than half of HBO's 14.6 million subscribers at the time), starting at 12:32 a.m. EST (05:32 UTC) on April 27, appeared as follows:\nHughes Communications immediately noticed the jamming, and threatened to shut down HBO's satellite signal or alter the satellite's course, with executives believing the hacker was a domestic terrorist. HBO's technician, working at the company's communication center in Hauppauge, Long Island, telephoned Hughes Communications, but officials there could not offer an explanation to the jamming, and so he attempted to regain control by increasing the uplink transmission power from 125 watts to 2,000 watts. This was unsuccessful, as MacDougall increased his power in a control battle that lasted about 90 seconds, during which it was feared that a further power increase would damage the satellite. MacDougall got scared, abandoned his control of the satellite, and went home. The following day, he felt guilty about his actions, but hoped the jamming would not be noticed by anyone not working for HBO. MacDougall was later surprised to see his actions being reported on network television. Thus, when he returned to work that night he pretended to have no knowledge about the intrusion, and asked questions about what had happened. MacDougall only told close friends, and had visions about federal agents visiting his home.\n\nGalaxy 1 carried HBO on transponder 23 at a rate of 125 watts, with relay signals sent out at 6,385 MHz. \"Mother Jones\" magazine determined that MacDougall could have potentially taken over the signals of three additional satellites. He could have taken control of the network feed of CBS had he positioned his satellite dish at the Telstar 301 satellite, operated by AT&T, tuned at 6,065 MHz. He also could have taken over the foreign language feed of the Voice of America network by aiming his satellite dish at 72 degrees west longitude. The final theorized hijacking would have been aiming his satellite dish at 100 degrees west longitude, above the Galápagos Islands, with a frequency setting of 293.375 MHz, thereby jamming the signal of United States Navy satellite Fleetsatcom 1. The magazine also posited that an amateur hobbyist could hijack the satellites that alerted American military forces to Soviet actions, creating confusion for world leaders and placing the world at risk of nuclear destruction.\n\nAlthough the intrusion caused minor annoyance to viewers, HBO contacted the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and announced that the hijacker would face prosecution. The commission's chief, Richard Smith, assembled staff in his office for an emergency meeting at the FCC headquarters eight hours after the intrusion to discuss how the culprit should be caught. On April 28 the chairman of HBO, Michael J. Fuchs, wrote to the FCC saying the company had received calls threatening to place Galaxy 1 into a different orbit, but the company was unable to determine whether these were credible threats or not. Fuchs's letter additionally urged the commission to use all of its resources to capture the culprit. In the days after the jamming, more than 200 people called the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to \"confess\" that they were Captain Midnight.\n\nThe Department of Justice made indications of its desire to get involved, and the FBI was called in to assist the investigation. One hundred FCC field offices and monitoring stations across the United States were actively involved in the investigation, with no less than six FCC employees working on the case. Oliver Long, the head engineer of the FCC's Texas field office bureau, oversaw the investigation, and the commission assigned agent George Dillon to the case. The case first led investigators from the FCC to focus on the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, after an anonymous tip accused an amateur radio operator residing in Lewisville, Texas, of being the culprit.\n\nLater, the FCC determined which teleport uplink sites out of the 2,000 licensed transmitters in the United States had the capability to override the HBO signal. That narrowed it down to 580 uplink sites that had sufficiently large antennas that had the capability of broadcasting the signal. The manufacturer that produced the character generator graphics model used to generate the typeface on the television screen was also identified after studying footage of the jamming. Investigators from the commission obtained copies from an FCC engineer and HBO viewers, as tape machines were not running during the jamming. The FCC removed stations from the list of 500 that were inoperative on April 27 or transmitting other material. This method brought the number of potential stations down to twelve. After FCC investigators visited these stations, there were now three prime suspects which included MacDougall. The commission later learned an accountant from Wisconsin had overheard MacDougall bragging about the jamming at a payphone in a rest area off Interstate 75 in Gainesville, and obtained a license plate number of a car owned by MacDougall.\n\nPrior to the jamming, the FCC warned that anyone interfering with television signals would be harshly dealt with and MacDougall was charged after surrendering to the authorities following media and industry pressure. Investigators from the commission spoke to MacDougall in July (he lost his job at Central Florida Teleport beforehand due to the closure of People's Choice), asking him questions that led him to believe that the commission was aware of the incident. Two FCC agents visited MacDougall's house two weeks later along with U.S. Attorney Lawrence Gentile III, who served MacDougall with a subpoena to appear in Jacksonville's U.S. District Court. In their meeting, MacDougall claimed not to have committed any crime. According to MacDougall, Gentile tried to make an agreement that if MacDougall discussed the incident, Gentile would be willing to recommend a small fine and probation to the judge. At that time, MacDougall stated that he started to feel that there was not enough evidence to convict him, and despite continuing to protest his innocence, MacDougall told Gentile he would attend court.\n\nMacDougall contacted attorney John Green Jr., who advised him the chances of him winning the case were 70 percent, and that a trial would be risky and costly. He faced being fined up to $100,000 and being sentenced to one year in prison if he was convicted. Furthermore, MacDougall was worried about going before the jury and lying to get himself acquitted. He thus changed his mind and agreed to cooperate fully with the FCC. At his first hearing on the afternoon of July 22, he pleaded guilty to the charge of \"illegally operating a satellite uplink transmitter\", a violation of 47 U.S.C. § 301. Under an agreement with Gentile, MacDougall plea bargained and received a $5,000 fine, was put on unsupervised probation for one year, and had his amateur radio license suspended for one year. Later, he was arraigned and freed on a $5,000 bond. MacDougall's plea bargain was confirmed at his sentencing by Judge Howard T. Snyder on August 26. Lawyers for Hughes Communications subsequently reviewed the option of taking MacDougall to civil court, but chose not to take any further action.\n\nHe was approached for interviews by the major news stations in the United States after his arraignment, but Gentile advised him to not appear on television until his sentencing. MacDougall held a news conference in which he stated he did not contest the rights of cable companies to scramble their programs, but asked the government to allow the marketplace and not corporations to set prices. He revealed he was aware of a year-old magazine that spoke about the type of signal interference he caused, but affirmed the article was not influential on his actions.\n\nMacDougall's jamming of HBO's satellite signal generated much publicity, and attracted attention from several sectors of society. The jamming was described by various press publications as either the first instance of high-technology terrorism, or the most widely watched instance of electronic graffiti in the world. The House Communications Subcommittee planned to hold meetings concerning the issue of satellite jamming. Members of Congress showed interest, with those coming from states with extensive rural areas showing more sympathy to owners of satellite dishes. The hijacking raised concerns over satellite-borne communications: that data transmitted by business and military users would become potential targets. MacDougall's action led to him being immediately regarded as coming close to being a folk hero amongst disgruntled satellite dish owners who felt unfairly treated. The Satellite Television Industry Association released a statement denouncing intentional interference, and a spokesperson for the organization called for the offender to be imprisoned. Showtime vice president Stephen Schultz dubbed the intrusion as an act of \"video terrorism\".\n\nAs a consequence of MacDougall's jamming, and ambiguity about the federal misdemeanor charge made against him under 47 U.S.C. § 301, the United States Congress passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (18 U.S.C. § 1367) which made satellite hijacking a felony. The FCC subsequently implemented strict requirements that all radio and television transmitters must have an electronic name tag for tracking purposes. The Automatic Transmitter Identification System (ATIS) was developed in response to the Captain Midnight jamming incident. It allows satellite operators to quickly identify unauthorized uplink transmissions. In 2009, HBO and Elmer Musser were awarded a Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for ATIS. Although HBO has not been targeted since the channel's signal power was increased to make it more difficult for hijackers to intrude, there have been multiple instances of uplink video piracy across the United States. One such incident happened in November 1987, when WGN-TV in Chicago had its transmission briefly interrupted by a man in a Max Headroom mask, and that same evening, the signal of PBS affiliate WTTW was overridden for one-and-a-half minutes, where the same person mooned the viewing audience and had his buttocks struck with a fly swatter. The jamming did not appear to affect HBO's pricing policies in the long-term.\n\nRichard Acello, the editor of the home satellite dish magazine \"Satellite TV Week\", stated MacDougall had not been able to achieve folk hero status as had been widely reported in the press: \n\n\"He didn't have any No. 1 records written about him or anything like that, and that's always an indication.\" He added: \"The whole event was misunderstood. People took Captain Midnight to be a symbol of frustration people were feeling about scrambling. It made him seem a representative of dish owners, but he was not. There was no way a dish owner could do what he did.\" \n\nA group called the Captain Midnight Grassroots Cause was formed, and sold merchandise to help raise money for MacDougall to pay his legal fees. MacDougall found the constant media attention difficult to deal with, and was regularly bothered at home. MacDougall shut his office because no work could be undertaken without him being asked about Captain Midnight. , he still resides in Ocala and undertakes consulting work under the MacDougall Electronics name. In a retrospective interview with \"Network World\" in 2011, MacDougall said he did not regret his actions but wished his motivations were more clearly understood:\n\nI do not regret trying to get the message out to corporate America about unfair pricing and restrictive trade practices. That was the impetus for doing what I did; that's the reason I jammed HBO; that's the reason I sent them a polite message. What I do regret is that I was young and fairly naïve in the ways of the media. I didn't grasp the fact that no one understood my motives and that everyone would make assumptions. Had I known that up front I would have been much more fervent in explaining my motivations. I had no animus and I had no malice in my heart.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1344605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1344605", "title": "Crooner", "text": "Crooner\n\nCrooner is an American epithet given primarily to male singers of jazz standards, mostly from the Great American Songbook, backed by either a full orchestra, a big band or a piano. Originally it was an ironic term denoting a sentimental singing style made possible by the use of microphones. Some performers, such as Russ Columbo, did not accept the term: Frank Sinatra once said that he did not consider himself or Bing Crosby \"crooners\".\n\nThis dominant popular vocal style coincided with the advent of radio broadcasting and electrical recording. Before the advent of the microphone, popular singers like Al Jolson had to project to the rear seats of a theater, as did opera singers, which made for a very loud vocal style. The microphone made possible the more personal style. Al Bowlly, Gene Austin, Art Gillham and, by some historical accounts, Vaughn De Leath are often credited as inventors of the crooning style, but Rudy Vallée became far more popular, beginning in 1928. He could be heard by anyone with a phonograph or a radio. \n\nHis first film, \"The Vagabond Lover\", was promoted with the line, \"Men Hate Him! Women Love Him!\" while his success brought press warnings of the \"Vallee Peril\": this \"punk from Maine\" with the \"dripping voice\" required mounted police to beat back screaming, swooning females at his vaudeville shows.\n\nBy the early 1930s the term \"crooner\" had taken on a pejorative connotation. Cardinal William O'Connell of Boston and the New York Singing Teachers Association (NYSTA) both publicly denounced the vocal form, O'Connell calling it \"base\", \"degenerate\", \"defiling\" and un-American and NYSTA adding \"corrupt\". Even \"The New York Times\" predicted that crooning would be just a passing fad. The newspaper printed, \"They sing like that because they can’t help it. Their style is begging to go out of fashion…. Crooners will soon go the way of tandem bicycles, mah jongg and midget golf.\" Voice range shifted from tenor (Vallée) to baritone (Russ Columbo, Bing Crosby). Still, a 1931 record by Dick Robinson, \"Crosby, Columbo & Vallee\", called upon men to fight \"these public enemies\" brought into homes via radio.\n\nAlthough the term is rarely used to describe a female singer, Vaughn De Leath, Annette Hanshaw, Mildred Bailey (at the beginning of her career) and Helen Rowland have been cited in the category of crooners.\n\nThe genre enjoyed popularity within the former Soviet Union with Mark Reizen, Leonid Utyosov, Pavel Lisitsian, Georg Ots, Oleg Anofriyev, Muslim Magomayev, and Joseph Kobzon leading the way. Their performances had a variety of influences including ballads and swing and was included in popular film soundtracks.\n\nAfter 1954 popular music became dominated by other styles, especially rock 'n' roll, while the music of latter-day crooners such as Perry Como and Matt Monro was recategorized by radio stations as easy listening or adult contemporary. Crooners have remained popular among fans of traditional pop music, with contemporary performers such as Tony Bennett, Barry Manilow, Brian Evans, Richard Hawley, Harry Connick Jr., Michael Bublé, Neil Hannon, Peter Cincotti, Hamilton Leithauser, Matteo Brancaleoni and Engelbert Humperdinck keeping the form alive. Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Dick Powell, Nat King Cole, Andy Williams, Bobby Darin and Jimmy Durante incorporated other popular styles into their music, such as blues, dixieland and even native Hawaiian music.\n\nDue to the country songs popularized by Bing Crosby, the crooning style of singing became an enduring part of country music. Bing Crosby achieved a million seller with his 1940 rendition of the song \"San Antonio Rose\", originally recorded by Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys. In 1942 Perry Como had a smash hit with \"Deep in the Heart of Texas\"; Bing Crosby, who had an enormous influence on Perry Como, covered this song and took it to the #3 position in the US chart that same year. Eddy Arnold, Jim Reeves and Ray Price are especially well known for their country crooner standards. Dean Martin is rather famous for the country music he recorded in the period when he was working for Reprise Records. Fellow Italian-American crooner Perry Como recorded several albums with country producer Chet Atkins in Nashville. Regular, non-country crooners scored hits with pop versions of country-songs: Tony Bennett had a \"Billboard\" #1 hit in 1951 with his rendition of Hank Williams' \"Cold, Cold Heart\", which was also performed by Louis Armstrong; Perry Como had a \"Billboard\" #1 hit in 1953 with his version of \"Don't Let the Stars Get in Your Eyes\", a #1 country hit for its author Slim Willet and a #4 country hit for Ray Price; Guy Mitchell scored a \"Billboard\" #1 in 1959 with \"Heartaches by the Number\", a country-hit for Ray Price; Engelbert Humperdinck achieved a 1967 UK #1 hit with \"Release Me\", another song already made famous by Ray Price in 1954. In 1970, Ray Price had a #1 U.S. country hit and a #11 \"Billboard\" Hot 100 hit with the song \"For the Good Times\" written by Kris Kristofferson; subsequently Perry Como's rendition reached #7 in 1973 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n\n"}

She was the winner of season twelve of the NBC competition show \"America's Got Talent\".\n\nFarmer became both the third female and third child to win \"America's Got Talent\", following Bianca Ryan in season one and Grace VanderWaal in season eleven. She was also the third ventriloquist to win, following Terry Fator in season two and Paul Zerdin in season ten.\n\nDarci Lynne Farmer lives in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. She was born on October 12, 2004. Growing up, Farmer loved to sing, but she was shy and was afraid to perform in front of an audience. Her parents encouraged her to overcome her shyness by participating in the \"International Cinderella Scholarship Program\" where she was crowned International Mini Miss. At that pageant she also met International Teen titleholder, Laryssa Bonacquisti, a young ventriloquist who inspired her to try ventriloquism herself. She then asked her parents, Clarke and Misty Farmer, for a puppet, insisting that it would overcome her shyness. On her tenth birthday, her parents presented her with a puppet. Farmer's idol is past \"America's Got Talent\" winner Terry Fator. Because ventriloquism is not very common, Farmer made a commitment that she personally wanted to keep the art of ventriloquism alive.\n\nIn 2014, she entered \"Edmond's Got Talent\" where she won first prize after a month's preparation on Bonacquisti's tips. She was soon brought to the attention of ventriloquy coach Gary Owen, who was so impressed by Farmer's skill that he voluntarily agreed to be her coach and business manager. Since then she has worked with Owen and vocal teacher Tiana Plemons. In 2015, she won first place in both the junior division at \"Oklahoma's Got Talent\" and \"Oklahoma Kids\", and won Broadway, Specialty Acts, and overall Entertainer of the Year at \"American Kids\" in Branson, Missouri. In March 2016, Farmer made an appearance on \"Little Big Shots\", performing \"I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart\" with Katie, and in July 2016, she became the first child ventriloquist ever to perform on an evening show in the 40-year history of the \"Vent Haven International Ventriloquists' ConVENTion\", where she fronted for celebrity ventriloquists Kevin Johnson and Todd Oliver. Then, in March 2017, she appeared on the British version of \"Little Big Shots\", again performing \"I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart\" with Katie.\n\nFarmer competed on the twelfth season of \"America's Got Talent\" in 2017. During the first episode broadcast on May 30, Farmer and her puppet, a girly rabbit named Petunia, performed George Gershwin's \"Summertime\". The comedy–singing act featured Petunia cutting off Farmer so Petunia could continue singing instead. Judge Mel B praised the act and pressed her Golden Buzzer, allowing Farmer to bypass the judge cuts and go straight to the quarterfinals. The video of this performance became the most socially viewed video in the show's history within 30 hours of broadcast, and was later named 4 on YouTube's list of the top 10 trending videos of 2017.\n\nFor Farmer's first live presentation after her Golden Buzzer performance, she serenaded Mel B with her shy, stuttering Motown mouse puppet, Oscar, performing Smokey Robinson's \"Who's Lovin' You\". Judges Howie Mandel, Mel B, Heidi Klum, and Simon Cowell gave Farmer standing ovations. For this performance, Farmer received enough viewer votes to move on to the semifinals, where she brought her puppet Edna Doorknocker to sing Aretha Franklin's \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\", and stood next to the judges' table so Edna could flirt with Simon Cowell. Again, all four judges gave Farmer a standing ovation. Viewers voted Farmer through to the finals.\n\nFor her final competition appearance, Farmer performed The Beatles' \"With a Little Help from My Friends\", with Petunia and Oscar interacting for comedic effect. Again, she earned standing ovations and judges' praise; Cowell predicted, \"I think you're going to win.\" For the finale in episode 22, Farmer fulfilled her dream by performing \"Anything You Can Do\" from \"Annie Get Your Gun\" with her idol and mentor Terry Fator, with Farmer singing as Petunia and Fator singing as Winston the Impersonating Turtle. After tripping over the first line of the song, she recovered and the act continued. The field was cut to the top five, and then to the top two finalists, Farmer and Angelica Hale. Host Tyra Banks then announced Farmer was the winner of the season, having received the most votes out of the 52 million votes cast. With the win, Farmer received the $1 million prize and a headline gig at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas, originally set for November 3 and 4 but two additional shows were added on November 2 and 5 after the first two dates sold out. The Las Vegas shows also featured Angelica Hale, Preacher Lawson and Light Balance.\n\nFarmer was a guest on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" in September. She appeared in Jeff Dunham's October video, \"The Haunted House on Dunham Hill\", in which she takes three of her puppets trick-or-treating at Dunham's home, where they encounter him and some of his puppets. In November, she made a guest appearance during a Terry Fator performance at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Tulsa, Catoosa, Oklahoma. In November, she appeared in \"A Very Pentatonix Christmas\" performing \"O Easter Egg\" (an Easter-themed parody of \"O Christmas Tree\") with Petunia.\n\nIn December, Farmer appeared as part of the charity event \"One Night With the Stars\" at Madison Square Garden. Her December 16 homecoming show \"iHeartMedia and KJ103 Present Darci Lynne\" sold out within six minutes of the tickets going on sale. As a result, a matinee show earlier the same day and then later another two shows on December 17 were added. On December 31, she performed at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas along with Fergie as part of a New Year's Eve event.\n\nIn November 2017, \"Darci Lynne and Friends Live\", a national tour, was announced, starting with five locations, to take place in January and February 2018, which was later expanded to 46 locations taking place between January 2018 and January 2019, including 9 Christmas performances in November and December, referred to as \"Rocking Around the Christmas Tree with Darci Lynne and Friends\".\n\nIn January 2018, Farmer appeared on \"Today\" with Oscar, performing \"Who's Lovin' You\". In March, she appeared on the \"Grand Ole Opry\" and made a cameo appearance on the \"Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards\", and then returned to \"Little Big Shots\" in April as \"a Little Big Shots legend\", where she performed \"Shout\" by the Isley Brothers with Oscar. In July, she participated in the 2018 Starkey Hearing Foundation gala. In August, she returned to \"AGT\" as a guest performer, singing \"Show Off\" from \"The Drowsy Chaperone\" with Petunia. In September, she appeared as a guest in an episode of \"Kids Baking Championship\". In November, she was a guest on \"Steve\", where she performed \"Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" with Petunia, and later sang \"Jingle Bell Rock\" with Petunia during NBC's \"Christmas in Rockefeller Center\" telecast. In December, she will return to the \"Grand Ole Opry\".\n\nAlso in December, Farmer is set to star in her own holiday special, \"Darci Lynne: My Hometown Christmas\", which will feature guest appearances by Pentatonix, Hunter Hayes, Lindsey Stirling, Toby Keith, Kristin Chenoweth, the four \"America's Got Talent\" judges, Simon Cowell, Howie Mandel, Heidi Klum and Mel B, and Lonnie Chavis from \"This Is Us\".\n\nIn January 2019, Farmer will appear in \"\".\n\nIn October 2018, Farmer announced a second tour starting in February 2019, \"Darci Lynne and Friends: Fresh Out of the Box\".\n\nFarmer's success on \"America's Got Talent\" has been credited with helping to bring ventriloquism back to the general public's attention.\n\nBill King of \"BuddyTV\" described Farmer's final \"America's Got Talent\" performance as \"so seamless you need to be reminded of its difficulty\". Talking to \"USA Today\", Terry Fator said of Farmer that \"she is, at 12 years old, one of the most unbelievable, perfect ventriloquists I've ever seen, and she'll only get better\", and later called her \"one of the most talented human beings on the planet\" in an interview with \"Billboard\". Professional ventriloquist Sammy King said in an interview with \"The Fountain Hills Times\" that \"she is very gifted, a great singer and has tremendous comedic timing\", while Jay Johnson described her on his personal blog as \"a wonderfully talented girl\" with \"near perfect\" ventriloquism technique and \"singing chops [that] could stand alone without the puppet assistance\", whose \"dedication to the art and ... young spirit will influence a generation of belly talkers to come\".\n\n\nFarmer attends Deer Creek Middle School near her home in Edmond, Oklahoma. She missed the first day of her seventh grade year due to appearing live on \"America's Got Talent\" on August 16.\n\nHer parents are Clarke and Misty Farmer. Farmer has three brothers: Nick, Dalton, and Nate.\n\n"}

{"id": "6789562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6789562", "title": "Dead Presidents (song)", "text": "Dead Presidents (song)\n\n\"Dead Presidents\" is a 1996 song by rapper Jay-Z. It was released as the first promotional single for Jay-Z's debut album \"Reasonable Doubt\", although it did not directly appear on the album: a different version, with the same backing track and chorus but different lyrics, called \"Dead Presidents II\", appeared on \"Reasonable Doubt\" instead. The single was a commercial success, and was certified as an RIAA certification gold single in June 1996. Both versions of the song are regarded as some of the greatest hip-hop songs ever recorded, and \"Dead Presidents II\" was voted #16 in About.com's Top 100 Rap Songs.\n\n\"Dead Presidents II\" also appears in the 2013 video game Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, as part of the Doomsday Heist update, in the blonded Los Santos 97.8 FM radio station.\n\nThe title is slang for money because portraits of dead United States presidents appear on most Federal Reserve Notes.\n\nThe song was produced by Ski. The song samples Lonnie Liston Smith's \"A Garden of Peace\" for the track's melody and A Tribe Called Quest's \"Oh My God (remix)\" for its percussion; the chorus is a sample of Nas rapping \"I'm out for dead presidents to represent me\", from his 1994 song \"The World Is Yours (Tip Mix)\".\n\nNas was originally invited to re-rap the chorus for Jay-Z and appear in the track's music video, but he declined. Some view these two actions as the foundation of Jay-Z vs. Nas feud.\n\nWhen Nas and Jay-Z feuded directly, both rappers discussed the merit of the sampling in the song in individual \"diss\" records. In Nas' track \"Stillmatic Freestyle,\" he says: \nJay-Z responds to Nas' claims in his song \"Takeover\" with the lines: \nThe line was later used in Cassidy's 2005 hit \"I'm a Hustla\": \nIn 2005 at Jay-Z's \"I Declare War\" concert, he performed \"Dead Presidents II\" with Nas, officially ending their feud.\n\nIn a YouTube video named \"Ski Beatz - the making of Jay-Z's Dead Presidents\" Ski explains how he filtered out the high frequency content of the melody sample (using a lowpass filter) to achieve a more prominent bass line without replaying one in. Ski's \"Beats, Rhymes & Samples\" mixtape contains the Q-Tip remix in the context of a \"Dead Presidents\" sample, because the original \"The World is Yours\" had altered lyrics in connection to the sampled vocals. At the end of the sample from the chorus, you can hear the \"Whose\" from \"Whose world is this?\" from the beginning of the chorus of \"The World is Yours\".\n\nJay-Z recorded a track called \"Dead Presidents 3\" around the time of \"The Black Album\" but it was never completed. The unfinished song was leaked onto the internet in the fall of 2007, around the release of \"American Gangster\". In it, Jay-Z referenced some of his lyrics from the original \"Dead Presidents\" and he used the sample but the sample was played in reverse and had a darker more atmospheric feel to it.\n\nIn July 2013 during a rare Twitter Q&A, a fan asked Jay-Z if \"Dead Presidents 3\" would be released which then resulted in Jay giving Young Guru and Just Blaze the permission to release the track on Young Guru's SoundCloud account.\n\nMany artists have released remixed versions of Dead Presidents with original lyrics (often freestyles) performed over the original sample and chorus. Notable artists to release versions of Dead Presidents include Charles Hamilton, Lil B, Lil' Wayne, Drake, Slug of Atmosphere, Chamillionaire, J. Cole, Logic, Kendrick Lamar, Pusha T, Akala, Lupe Fiasco, Kano, Logic, Slaughterhouse, AZ, Curren$y featuring and DJ Premier who recorded a version with reworked instrumentals with Jay-Z's original lyrics and vocals from Nas' The World is Yours (Remix).\n\n\n"}

The company's board of directors voted for an immediate shutdown after the company failed to raise enough capital to continue operating. Ecast's phones and email were turned off shortly after. AMI Entertainment Network Inc. and TouchTunes Interactive Networks indicated they would accommodate customers no longer able to access the company's services.\n\nIn late 2001, Ecast filed a lawsuit against TouchTunes Music Corporation claiming the company resorted to unfair trade practices by notifying Ecast and its customers that they were infringing TouchTunes' patent.\n\nOn October 15, 2003, Ecast voluntarily dismissed its own claims against TouchTunes for interference with contracts and unfair competition. In January 2004, TouchTunes filed a counterclaim that Ecast infringed on their patent rights by incorporating Touchtunes’ technology into their systems.\n\nEcast also had a separate patent infringement case against TouchTunes, charging the company with infringement by selling its jukeboxes within the U.S.\n\nUltimately TouchTunes and Ecast agreed to cross-license TouchTunes' U.S. Patent No. 6,308,204 and Ecast's U.S. Patent No. 5,341,350, which it licensed from NSM Music Group Limited.\n\nIn September 2005, the Attorney General of the United States filed a civil antitrust action against Ecast, Inc. and NSM Music Group, Ltd. The lawsuit alleged that a February 2003 agreement between the companies agreement was in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Specifically that the negotiations which eventually led to NSM Music Group manufacturing Ecast's hardware, after their previous manufacturer terminated the supply agreement, included an agreement by NSM to abandon its plans to enter the U.S. market in return for an upfront payment by Ecast. The Attorney General contended that NSM's agreement caused them to abandon their plan to incorporate their own distinctive digital jukebox platform into their physical jukeboxes and enter the United States market.\n\nThe Department of Justice simultaneously announced alongside the lawsuit that it had reached a settlement with NSM and Ecast under which the two companies terminated their non-compete agreement.\n\nIn 2009, Ecast co-founder and one-time CEO and Executive Chairman, Samuel \"Mouli\" Cohen defrauded 55 investors, including actor Danny Glover and the Vanguard Public Foundation, of more than $28 million and two lawsuits were filed.

The ESRB was established in 1994 by the Entertainment Software Association (formerly the Interactive Digital Software Association), in response to criticism of controversial video games with excessively violent or sexual content.\n\nThe board assigns ratings to games based on their content, using judgment similar to the motion picture rating systems used in many countries, using a combination of six age-based levels intended to aid consumers in determining a game's content and suitability, along with a system of \"content descriptors\" which detail specific types of content present in a particular game. The ESRB maintains a code of ethics for the advertising and promotion of video games—ensuring that marketing materials for games are targeted to appropriate audiences. In 2011, the ESRB began offering a system to automatically assign ratings for digitally-distributed games and mobile apps, which utilizes a survey answered by the product's publisher as opposed to a manual assessment by ESRB staff. Through the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC), this method can generate equivalent ratings for other territories. Alongside its game rating operation, the ESRB also provides certification services for online privacy on websites and mobile apps.\n\nThe ESRB ratings system is enforced via the voluntary leverage of the North American video game and retail industries; most stores require customers to present photo identification when purchasing games carrying the ESRB's highest age ratings, and do not stock games which have not been rated. Additionally, major console manufacturers will not license games for their systems unless they carry ESRB ratings, while console manufacturers and most stores will refuse games that the ESRB has rated as being appropriate for adults only. The ESRB ratings system is not enforced under federal laws in any of the countries where it is actively used, although it is enforced under provincial laws in some regions of Canada.\n\nDue to the level of consumer and retail awareness of the ratings system, along with the organization's efforts to ensure that retailers comply with the ratings system and that publishers comply with its marketing code, the ESRB has considered its system to be effective, and was praised by the Federal Trade Commission for being the \"strongest\" self-regulatory organization in the entertainment sector. Despite its positive reception, the ESRB has still faced criticism from politicians and other watchdog groups for the structure of its operations, particularly in the wake of a 2005 incident that surrounded the organization's handling of \"hidden\", objectionable content in a which could be accessed using a user-created modification.\n\nCritics of the ESRB have asserted that the organization has a conflict of interest because of its vested interest in the video game industry, and that the ESRB does not rate certain games, such as the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series, harshly enough for their violent or sexual content in order to protect their commercial viability. Contrarily, other critics have argued that, at the same time, the ESRB rates certain games too strongly for their content, and that its influence has stifled the viability of adult-oriented video games due to the board's restrictions on how they are marketed and sold.\n\nVideo games with objectionable content date back as far as 1976; the arcade game \"Death Race\" required users to run over \"gremlins\" with a vehicle and avoid the gravestones they leave behind. Although its graphics were relatively primitive, the game's overall theme and the sound effects made when gremlins were killed were considered disturbing by players, prompting media attention. A developer known as Mystique became known for making sexually explicit adult video games for the Atari 2600 console, but garnered the most attention with its controversial 1982 game \"Custer's Revenge\", which infamously featured a crude simulation of the rape of a Native American woman. Atari received numerous complaints about the game, and responded by trying to sue the game's makers.\n\nA 1983 industry crash, caused by the market being overrun with low-quality products, prompted a higher degree of regulation by future console manufacturers: when the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was launched in the United States in 1985, Nintendo of America instituted requirements and restrictions on third-party developers, including the requirement for all games to be licensed by the company. The console itself also included a lockout chip to enforce this requirement and prevent the console from loading unlicensed games. Such leverage on developers has since become a standard practice among console makers, although Nintendo of America also had stringent content policies, frequently censoring blood, sexual content, and references to religion, tobacco and alcohol from games released on its consoles in the United States.\n\nWhen asked in 1987 about the suitability of a film-like rating system for video games, a representative of the Software Publishers Association said that \"Adult computer software is nothing to worry about. It's not an issue that the government wants to spend any time with ... They just got done with a big witchhunt in the music recording industry, and they got absolutely nowhere\". The association did recommend voluntary warnings for games like \"Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards\" (1987).\n\nVideo games' progression into the 1990s brought dramatic increases in graphics and sound capabilities, and the ability to use full-motion video (FMV) content in games. In the United States Senate, Democratic Senators Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Herb Kohl of Wisconsin led hearings on video game violence and the corruption of society which began in 1992. Two games of this era were specifically cited in the hearings for their content; the fighting game \"Mortal Kombat\" featured realistic, digitized sprites of live-action actors, blood, and the ability to use violent \"fatality\" moves to defeat opponents, while \"Night Trap\" featured 90 minutes of FMV content, with scenes that were considered to be sexually suggestive and exploitive. Both Nintendo and Sega had differing views on objectionable content in video games; a port of \"Mortal Kombat\" for the Super NES was censored to remove the game's overly violent content, whereas the port for Sega consoles retained much of this content, which helped increase sales.\n\nSega had implemented its own voluntary ratings system, the Videogame Rating Council (VRC), largely to rate games released for its own consoles. \"Mortal Kombat\" and \"Night Trap\" were rated \"MA-13\" and \"MA-17\" on Sega's scale respectively. During the hearings, Howard Lincoln and Bill White (chairmen of Nintendo and Sega's U.S. divisions respectively) attacked each other's stances on objectionable content in video games; Lincoln condemned Sega for even releasing \"Night Trap\" and felt it \"simply has no place in our society\", while White argued that Sega was more responsible to consumers because they actually had a rating system in place, rather than a blanket presumption that all its games would be suitable for general audiences. Fragmentation would also develop in the classification of games; The 3DO Company created their own age-based rating system, the 3DO Rating System, for games released on its 3DO Interactive Multiplayer platform, and the Recreational Software Advisory Council (RSAC) was formed for rating PC games, which used a system that rated the intensity of specific classes of objectionable content, but did not use age recommendations. However, Lieberman did not believe that these systems were sufficient, and in February 1994, threatened to propose the creation of a federal commission for regulating and rating video games.\n\nWith the threat of federal regulations, a group of major video game developers and publishers, including Acclaim Entertainment and Electronic Arts along with Nintendo and Sega, formed a political trade group known as the Interactive Digital Software Association in April 1994, with a goal to create a self-regulatory framework for assessing and rating video games. While Sega had proposed that the industry use its VRC rating system, Nintendo representatives objected to the idea because they did not want to associate themselves with the work of their main competitor; instead, a vendor-neutral rating system known as the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) was developed. The formation of the ESRB was officially announced to Congress on July 29, 1994. The ESRB was officially launched on September 16, 1994; its system consisted of five age-based ratings; \"Early Childhood\", \"Kids to Adults\" (later renamed \"Everyone\" in 1998), \"Teen\", \"Mature\", and \"Adults Only\". The ESRB would also use \"descriptors\" with brief explanations of the content contained in a game.\n\nThe U.S. arcade gaming industry did not adopt the ESRB system, with the American Amusement Machine Association (AAMA) having cited \"fundamental differences between the coin-operated and consumer segments of the video game industry\" as reasoning. The AAMA, the Amusement & Music Operators Association, and the International Association for the Leisure and Entertainment Industry, adopted their own three-tier \"Parental Advisory System\" in 1994, which uses three color-coded levels of content intensity (designated by green, yellow, and red stickers affixed to arcade cabinet artwork).\n\nAlongside its efforts to classify video games, the ESRB also formed a division known as Entertainment Software Rating Board Interactive (ESRBi), which rated internet content using a similar system to its video game ratings. ESRBi also notably partnered with the internet service provider America Online to integrate these ratings into its existing parental controls. ESRBi was discontinued in 2003.\n\nIn 2002, Dr. Arthur Pober, the original president of the ESRB, stepped down so he could focus on academics. In November 2002, he was formally replaced by Patrica Vance, who formerly worked for The Princeton Review and The Walt Disney Company. In March 2005, the ESRB introduced a new rating, \"Everyone 10+\", designating games with content of a relatively higher impact than those of games rated \"Everyone\", but still not high enough to garner a \"Teen\" rating.\n\nIn response to the growth of smartphone use, in November 2011, CTIA, a group of major U.S. companies representing the wireless industry, and ESRB announced the co-development of a free, voluntary ratings process for mobile app stores. The system uses ESRB's icons and content descriptors, along with four additional \"Interactive Elements\" (\"Digital Purchases\", \"Shares Info,\" \"Shares Location,\" and \"Users Interact\") to inform users of an app's behavior in regards to data collection and interactions with others. Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile US were among the first to implement the system for their own application storefronts, and Microsoft's Windows Phone Marketplace already supported ESRB ratings upon its introduction. ESRB president Patricia Vance explained that the partnership was intended to help broaden the ESRB's reach into the mobile market, and that \"consumers, especially parents, benefit from having a consistently applied set of ratings for games rather than a fragmented array of different systems.\"\n\nIn November 2012, the ESRB and other video game ratings boards, including PEGI, the Australian Classification Board, and USK among others, established a consortium known as the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC). The group sought to design an online, questionnaire-based rating process for digitally-distributed video games that could generate ratings for multiple video game ratings organizations at once. The resulting ratings information is tied to a unique code, which can then be used by online storefronts to display the corresponding rating for the user's region. The three major console makers, Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo have all committed to supporting IARC for their digital storefronts, including ESRB ratings for North American markets. Google Play Store was updated in March 2015 to adopt and display ESRB ratings for apps in North America through IARC. Windows Store also implemented IARC in January 2016. Apple's App Store still uses its own generic age rating system and does not use the ESRB or IARC systems.\n\nTo obtain a rating for a game, a publisher submits a detailed questionnaire and a DVD containing footage of the most graphic and extreme content found in the game to the ESRB, including content related to the game's context, storyline, reward system, unlockable and otherwise \"hidden\" content, and other elements that may affect its rating. They may also provide printed copies of the game's script and lyrics from songs in the game. The footage is reviewed by a team of at least three raters, who discuss what the most appropriate and \"helpful\" rating for the game would be, based on the footage and details provided. Raters represent various demographics, including parents, along with casual and \"hardcore\" gamers. Raters were formerly hired on a part-time basis, but in 2007, ESRB transitioned to a team of seven full-time raters, who all live in the New York City area.\n\nIf a publisher does not agree with the rating that they were assigned, they may edit the game and submit the revised version for a new rating; for example, an initial cut of \"The Punisher\" was given an AO rating due to the extremely violent nature of certain scenes contained within the game. To lessen their impact, the developer changed these scenes to be rendered in black and white: the revised cut of the game was re-submitted, and received the M rating. There is also an appeals process, but it has never been used.\n\nWhen the game is ready for release, the publisher sends copies of the final version of the game to the ESRB, who reviews the game's packaging, and a random number of games they receive are play tested for more thorough review. Penalties apply to publishers who misrepresent the content of their games, including the potential for fines up to US $1 million and a product recall, if deemed necessary. The ESRB typically posts rating information for new titles on its website 30 days after the rating process is complete; in 2008, in response to incidents where this practice inadvertently leaked information about games that had not yet been announced, the ESRB began to allow publishers to place embargoes on the release of ratings information until a game is officially announced.\n\nIn April 2011, the ESRB introduced its Short Form, a free streamlined, automated process for assigning ratings for console downloadable games as a way to address the rapidly growing volume of digitally-delivered games. Rather than having raters review each product (the Long Form), publishers of these games complete a series of multiple-choice questions that address content across relevant categories, including violence, sexual content, language, etc. The responses automatically determine the game's rating category and content descriptors. Games rated via this process may be tested post-release to ensure that content was properly disclosed. The survey-based method is also used in the ESRB/CTIA and IARC rating programs for mobile apps. The ESRB planned to phase out the Short Form for digital-only games, instead directing those developers and publishers to use the similar free questionnaire-driven IARC program, which was being adopted beyond mobile app stores, including the Nintendo eShop and PlayStation Store, as a requirement for posting.\n\nIn response to concerns from Sony on the growing number of indie game titles that were receiving physical releases alongside retail ones, the ESRB began instituting new rules around August 2017 that any retail product was mandated to undergo the standard Long Form review for the game, disallowing the use of the Short Form for such titles. Alongside this, ESRB introduced a \"value tier\" for the Long Form review process for games developed at lower budgets (under $1 million), with a cost of $3000 for obtaining the retail rating. This decision has impacted the choice of several boutique indie game publishers, who have either cancelled plans for retail versions or had to stop selling retail versions to comply with the new ESRB rules.\n\nESRB ratings are primarily identified through icons, which are displayed on the packaging and promotional materials for a game. Each icon contains a stylized alphabetical letter representing the rating. In addition to the main age-based, ratings, ESRB ratings also incorporate one or more of 30 \"content descriptors\" which provide detailed information about the specific types and levels of objectionable content contained in a game, including categories covering different levels of violence, language, sexual content, nudity, use of alcoholic beverages or other drugs, crude and mature humor, or gambling. The full label, containing both the descriptors and rating, are typically displayed on the back of a game's packaging.\n\nGames which incorporate online features must display the additional notice \"Online Interactions Not Rated by the ESRB\" (previously \"Game Experience May Change During Online Play\"), which disclaims that the rating only applies to the content contained within the game itself, and does not cover any user-generated content available within. Games that provide post-release downloadable content must have ensure that the new content remains consistent with the original ESRB rating; otherwise the ESRB requires that the original game be re-evaluated and remarked with the more appropriate rating in considering this new content. Ratings information also disclaims if a game offers digital goods or other premiums (including downloadable content, microtransactions, and \"loot boxes\") that require payment of real money to obtain.\n\nThe appearance of the ratings icons themselves have been updated several times; originally carrying a stylized, pixelated look, they were first updated in 1999 to carry a cleaner appearance. In August 2013, the rating icons were streamlined again; the textual name of the rating became black text on white, the \"content rated by\" tagline was removed, and registered trademark symbols were moved to the bottom-right corner. The changes were intended to increase the icons' clarity at smaller sizes (such as on mobile devices), reflecting the growth in the digital distribution of video games.\n\nThe ESRB rating system is primarily enforced on a self-regulatory basis by the video game and retail industries; in markets where it is used, retailers typically enforce the \"Mature\" rating using photo identification, and refuse to stock video games that have not been rated by the organization, or are rated \"Adults Only\". Modern video game consoles may also include parental controls that can be configured to restrict games played by specific users, using factors such as their ESRB rating. The ESRB has also taken action against video game distributors who use the ratings icons in advertising without authorization or having actually been issued the rating by the board.\n\nSteam, the largest digital distribution storefront for personal computers, does display ratings when available, and allows games to be categorized and filtered based on categories, but an ESRB rating is not mandatory. As of June 2018, following complaints regarding inconsistent enforcement of its previous guidelines, Steam only bans the sale of games that contain blatantly illegal content, or games that it classifies as being \"straight up trolling\".\n\nIn the United States, there have been attempts at the state and federal level to introduce laws requiring retailers to enforce the ESRB ratings system. In 2004, California Assemblyman Leland Yee sponsored a state bill requiring retailers to stock M-rated games on separate shelves that are at least from the ground. The bill was passed, after it was modified to only require that retailers promote awareness of the ESRB ratings system to their customers.\n\nThe following year, California passed AB 1179, a second bill sponsored by Yee, which banned the sale of \"violent video games\" to minors. The term was defined using a variation of the Miller test (originally created to judge whether a work is obscene), separate from any rating the game may have received. In a landmark ruling, the law was struck down by the Supreme Court in \"Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association\", which ruled that AB 1179 was unconstitutional because video games are a protected form of expression.\n\nIn Canada, ESRB ratings are enforced under provincial laws by film ratings boards in Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Saskatchewan. As in the U.S., most retailers voluntarily enforce the ratings regardless. Prior to the implementation of the Film Classification Act, 2005, which gave it the power to enforce ESRB ratings, the Ontario Film Review Board had used its own powers to classify the M-rated \"Manhunt\" as a film and give it a \"Restricted\" rating, legally barring its sale to those under 18. By contrast, the British Columbia Film Classification Office considered the ESRB rating to be appropriate.\n\nThe ESRB enforces guidelines that have been adopted by the video game industry in order to ensure responsible advertising and marketing practices. These include ensuring that game packaging, advertisements, and trailers properly display rating information, restricting where advertising materials for games rated \"Teen\" or higher can appear, forbidding publishers from \"glamoriz[ing] or exploiting\" a game's rating in advertising, and requiring online marketing of games rated \"Mature\" or higher to be restricted to users who are appropriately aged. This allows the ESRB to restrict video game advertising \"to consumers for whom the product is not rated as appropriate.\" The board also forbids ratings from other organizations from being shown alongside ESRB ratings on publishers' websites or social media outlets. A group of online gaming publications known as the ESRB Website Council operates under a similar code of conduct, which requires them to display ESRB ratings information for games that they cover, and implement systems to restrict access to audiovisual content depicting M or AO-rated games to users who are appropriately aged.\n\nIn March 2013, the ESRB eased certain restrictions on the promotion of M-rated games. Firstly, trailers for games that are or are anticipated to be rated \"Mature\" can be cleared by the ESRB as being appropriate for \"general\" audiences—similarly to the \"green band\" ratings issued by the MPAA for film trailers. Secondly, the board began to allow, on a case-by-case basis depending on the target demographic of the game, M-rated games to be cross-promoted in the marketing materials of games with lower ratings.\n\nIn addition to its video game ratings operation, the ESRB also offers an online privacy program which helps websites adopt privacy policies and data usage practices which comply with relevant laws and best practices for the collection and use of personal information, and provides \"Privacy Certified\" seals indicating certification under the ESRB's privacy guidelines. In June 2013, the service was extended to mobile apps, with a particular emphasis on helping application developers comply with the then-upcoming changes to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.\n\nThe ESRB has considered its system to be effective, due in part to initiatives by the Board to promote enforcement and consumer awareness of the system, and efforts by retailers to prevent the sale of M-rated games to minors.\n\nIn the year following its 1994 launch, the ESRB rating system had achieved widespread usage across the console game industry, although adoption was not yet as high within the PC gaming industry. Lieberman and Kohl also reported that some retailers were reluctant to the idea of removing older, non-rated games from their shelves, and that some retail employees lacked knowledge of the new system. By 2008, the Federal Trade Commission reported 20% of underaged mystery shoppers were able to successfully purchase an M-rated video game from a selection of retailers—a 22 percent reduction from 2007. By 2011, these numbers had dropped further to 13%. In its 2009 Report to Congress, the FTC recognized the ESRB for having \"the strongest self-regulatory code\" of all entertainment sectors because of its enforcement of advertising and marketing guidelines.\n\nThe ESRB has often been accused of not rating certain games, such as \"Manhunt\" and the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series, harshly enough for violence and other related themes, and for lacking transparency in certain aspects of the ratings process. Critics have argued that some games only received the M rating rather than the stricter AO rating because of the commercial effects of such a rating; console manufacturers and most retailers refuse to distribute AO-rated games, dramatically affecting their commercial availability. An ESRB representative stated that the Board uses the AO rating when warranted, even due to violence, and that in most occasions, publishers would edit the game to meet the M rating to ensure wide commercial availability instead of keeping the AO rating. The film classification boards of the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Ontario respectively classified the M-rated games \"Soldier of Fortune\" and \"Manhunt\" as films due to concerns over the nature of their content, and gave them \"Restricted\" ratings, legally restricting their sale to adults.\n\nThere has been a correlation between the M rating and sales; a 2007 study by Electronic Entertainment Design and Research found that M-rated games \"have both the highest average Metacritic scores and the highest average gross sales in the United States\", and NPD Group found that 7 of the top 20 video games of 2010 (including the #1 game, \"\") were M-rated, even though only 5% of games released that year carried the rating.\n\nIn 2005, the National Institute on Media and the Family criticized the ESRB for seldom-using the Adults Only rating, arguing because it has a vested interest in the video game industry, it did not want to perform actions that would affect their commercial availability. The organization stated that \"study after study shows that ratings would be stricter if parents were doing the job. It took explicit porn to get \"\" an AO rating, even though the original version, still rated M, rewards players whose on-screen persona had sex with prostitutes and then killed them. We have been calling for AO ratings for the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series for years—now it is clear why the ESRB has ignored our request.\" The ESRB disputed these claims, arguing that the organization \"relies on flawed research and ignores any and all conflicting evidence\", was \"imposing its own narrow values and morality on the rest of the country, regardless that it has little evidence to show that parents agree with their point of view\", and did not reply to the ESRB's request for comments following its report card in 2004. The board also pointed out that the NIMF's study and \"report card\" used data from PSVRatings, a for-profit competitor to the ESRB.\n\nOn the other hand, some have felt that the \"Mature\" rating is too broad; video game journalist Ben Kuchera noted that \"Halo 3\"—a sci-fi first-person shooter whose level of violence was, in his opinion, comparable to a \"Star Wars\" film, had received an M rating for \"Blood and Gore,\" \"Mild Language\" and \"Violence\". He argued that \"having a game like \"Halo 3\" share the same rating as \"Saints Row IV\", which carries the 'Blood,' Intense Violence,' 'Partial Nudity,' 'Sexual Content,' 'Strong Language' and 'Use of Drugs' descriptors was always silly, and it weakened the thrust of the ratings system.\" Likewise, he felt that the tone and content of the PG-13 rated film \"The Dark Knight\" was relatively harsher to children than that of the \"Saints Row\" series due to the latter's light-hearted tone, but still noted that \"as parents we know what's right and what isn't for our kids, and being aware of the content they consume is a large part of our job as parents.\" \"\", the most recent installment in the franchise, received a \"Teen\" rating instead of \"Mature\". Microsoft Xbox division executive Aaron Greenberg argued that consumers had been \"surprised\" by the M rating on previous installments \"given the style of the game and the lack of real graphic violence and things like that\", but that the \"Teen\" rating would theoretically enable the game to reach a broader audience of younger players.\n\nThe \"Adults Only\" (AO) rating has attracted a negative stigma among the video game industry—one which has been criticized for stifling the ability for developers to have creative freedom in their portrayal of certain themes in a game, at the risk of being commercially unviable due to publishers' objections to AO-rated content. AO-rated games cannot be published for major video game console platforms, and most retailers do not stock AO-rated games. ESRB President Patricia Vance argued that applying self-censorship to ensure marketability was a compromise that is \"true in every entertainment medium\", but still believed that the idea of the AO rating eventually becoming acceptable would be a good thing for the ESRB system. The stigma is primarily affected by a perception by the industry and other activists that video games are generally considered children's products; for example, the availability of a Wii version of \"Manhunt 2\" was condemned by Senator Hillary Clinton over fears that children could use the game's motion controls to act out the game's \"many graphic torture scenes and murders\".\n\nAttitudes towards AO-rated games have also been influenced by the types of games that have received the rating; Peter Payne, head of Peach Princess, a publisher of English translations of Japanese eroge visual novels, believed that the \"Adults Only\" rating had acquired a \"smutty\" and \"tasteless\" reputation since the majority of AO-rated titles were either niche pornographic titles such as eroge games, or immature titles such as \"Riana Rouge\" (which \"Polygon\" described as a game which had the quality of an adult movie, and \"[aimed] to do nothing more than tell low-brow jokes and show nude women prancing around\") and \"Lula 3D\" (whose packaging advertised the inclusion of \"Bouncin' Boobs Technology\").\n\nBy contrast, the ESRB has only officially issued the AO rating for extreme violence three times: \"Thrill Kill\", a fighting game with heavy sexual overtones, received an AO rating with content descriptors for \"Animated Violence\" and \"Animated Blood and Gore\". Due to objections over the game's content, \"Thrill Kill\" was canceled by Electronic Arts after it acquired the North American operations of the game's publisher, Virgin Interactive. \"Manhunt 2\" also received an AO rating for its extreme violence; while the uncut version would be released exclusively for PCs, the console versions were edited to meet the M rating criteria. In January 2015, \"Hatred\", a controversial game whose plot centers around a character indiscriminately murdering everyone he encounters, received the rating for its extreme violence and harsh language; one of the game's developers disputed the rating, arguing that \"its violence isn't really that bad and this harsh language isn't overused\", but also acknowledged the rarity of their situation.\n\nIn 2005, members of the mod community discovered that the PC version of \"\" could be modified to unlock an incomplete sex minigame known as \"Hot Coffee\", which Rockstar North had decided to leave out of the final game. The discovery of the minigame caused California State Assemblyman Leland Yee to rebuke both Rockstar and the ESRB, arguing that the ESRB was not doing its job properly. US Senators Hillary Clinton and Joe Lieberman also expressed their disapproval. Rockstar initially claimed that the minigame was created by the mod community and was not a part of the original game. This was disproven when it was discovered that a third-party cheat device could be used to unlock the \"Hot Coffee\" scenes in console versions of the game. Following an investigation, the ESRB changed its rating from M to AO, setting a precedent that games can be re-rated due to the presence of pertinent content that exists on the game's disc, even if that content is programmed to not be playable without modification or unauthorized use of a third-party cheat device. Following the release of a version excluding the content, the rating was reverted to M.\n\nIn May 2006, \"\" had its rating changed from T to M due to \"more detailed depictions of blood and gore than were considered in the original rating\", along with a third-party mod for the PC version allowing the use of topless female characters. The game's publisher, Bethesda Softworks, decided not to re-edit the game or contest the new rating, but noted that \"Oblivion\"s content was \"not typical\" of games with the M rating, and that the game \"does not present the central themes of violence that are common to those products.\"\n\nIn the wake of these two incidents, the ESRB changed its policies in June 2006 to account for hidden content; publishers must disclose information surrounding all unlockable or otherwise \"hidden\" content in the game as part of the ratings process, and publishers can be fined up to US$1 million if they are found to have misrepresented the content of their game after further reviews. In response to the aftermath of Hot Coffee and the resulting policy changes, ESRB President Patricia Vance stated that in her opinion, \"there is no other industry self-regulatory system willing or capable of imposing such swift and sweeping sanctions on its own members, which in this particular case resulted in the removal of a top-selling product from the market and a major loss of sales.\" However, several U.S. politicians, including Senator Sam Brownback, California Senator Leland Yee, and Michigan Senator Fred Upton (who was a major critic against Rockstar during the controversy), still felt that the ESRB had \"lost\" its trust of consumers, believing that video game developers were taking advantage of the board's conflict of interest with the industry to incorporate objectionable content into their products without the ESRB's full knowledge.\n\nIn late 2006, both Upton and Brownback tabled bills to place governmental oversight on aspects of the ESRB rating process, and make it illegal for publishers to misrepresent the playable content of a video game to a ratings board; Upton proposed a bill known as the Video Game Decency Act, explaining that developers had \"done an end-run around the process to deliver violent and pornographic material to our kids\", and that the bill would \"[go] hand in hand with the mission of the industry’s own ratings system.\" Brownback proposed a bill known as the Truth in Video Game Rating Act, which would have also forced the ESRB to have full, hands-on access to games instead of just video footage, and have initiated a government study on the \"effectiveness\" of the organization and the possibility of forming a ratings organization independent from the video game industry.\n\nIn October 2017, in response to growing criticism of the loot box model for video game microtransactions (which grant chances at earning randomized items of various rarities, typically cosmetic in nature, in exchange for payment), the ESRB stated their opinion that they were not a form of gambling. They described them as a voluntary and optional aspect of a video game, and comparable to booster packs for collectible card games because their purchase guarantees that a user will receive items at all, but not necessarily high-value items all the time. The ESRB added that games that contain actual wagering of real money would hold the Adults Only rating.\n\nOn February 14, 2018, U.S. senator Maggie Hassan asked the ESRB to examine if games with loot box microtransactions were being marketed in an \"ethical and transparent way\" that \"adequately protects the developing minds of young children from predatory practices.\" The ESRB subsequently announced on February 27, 2018, that it would introduce a new label for any games that contain \"the ability to purchase digital goods or premiums with real world currency\". The announcement was criticized for being overreaching and ambiguous, as it applies to not only microtransactions, but any purchases of digital goods in relation to a game (which includes downloadable content), and would thus apply to almost all modern video games. Patrica Vance stated that the ESRB avoided references to specific types of microtransactions, so that the advisory label could be understood by parents unaware of specific details. Vance added that the ESRB was \"unable to find any evidence that children specifically have been [psychologically] impacted by loot boxes\" or that they caused children to develop \"some sort of tendency towards gambling.\"\n\nWhilst ESRB ratings are officially recognised in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and their respective territories, most major game publishers extended their use as \"de facto\" in various South American countries (except for Brazil due to its own rating system), and, in Nintendo's case, some Asian countries.\n"}

{"id": "27358437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27358437", "title": "Feline Fuelled Games", "text": "Feline Fuelled Games\n\nFeline Fuelled Games is a German PC game development team whose mods for the role-playing games \"Neverwinter Nights 2\" by Obsidian and \"\" by BioWare have received critical acclaim in the German video game press. On 5 May 2017, they will publish their first original game, the point-and-click adventure \"Sandra and Woo in the Cursed Adventure\" based on the webcomic \"Sandra and Woo\".\n\nBefore Feline Fuelled Games was established in 2004, its founder Oliver Knörzer and several other team members, among them Eric Dunkel and Matthias Geißler, developed the campaign \"Silberwald: Der Ring des Schicksals\" (\"Silver Forest: The Ring of Destiny\") for BioWare's \"Neverwinter Nights\" which was released on 21 July 2003. It became a surprise hit with more than 30,000 downloads at the biggest \"Neverwinter Nights\" fansite NWVault. \"Silberwald: Der Ring des Schicksals\" received an overall score of 78% in a test by Georg Valentin of the second biggest German game magazine GameStar, and it was the subject of the TV show Giga Games which aired on 25 July 2003.\n\nOliver's mother Ute Knörzer, who designed levels and wrote dialog for \"Silberwald: Der Ring des Schicksals\", then moved on to develop the mods \"Silberwald Saga: Dunkle Sonne\" (\"Silver Forest Legend: Dark Sun\"), a spin-off of the original \"Silberwald\" campaign, and \"Das Lied der Götter\" for \"Neverwinter Nights\". The latter one was later translated into English among the title \"The Song Divine\" and has been included into NWVault’s \"Hall of Fame\" list.\n\nAfter \"Neverwinter Nights 2\" was announced by Obsidian, Oliver Knörzer and Ute Knörzer began the development of a new campaign called \"Gaia: Chroniken des 3. Zeitalters\" (\"Gaia: Chronicles of the Third Age\") for it in 2004. Some old and new team members joined them over the course of 2004 and 2005 and the mod group was given its name Feline Fuelled Games on 29 September 2005, referring a story arc of the webcomic \"Dragon Tails\" about an incompetent video game developer company. The project turned out to be too ambitious, though, and was eventually cancelled in 2006 with Oliver Knörzer also resigning as lead developer. However, Feline Fuelled Games, now led by Ute Knörzer, managed to release several other mods during the next years and grew to 20 team members as of March 2012, including the second lead developer Walter Oswald. The release of a new mod, like the one of the fourth chapter of the \"Planescape: Die Traumfängerin\" series, is usually mentioned on German video game websites such as GameCaptain, Gamezone and Gameswelt.\n\nThe first mod released by Feline Fuelled Games was \"Herz der Finsternis\" (\"Heart of Darkness\") on 9 December 2007, which was developed by Ute Knörzer. \"Herz der Finsternis\" is the direct sequel of \"Das Lied der Götter\" and was praised by Andreas Bertits as \"a fantastic adventure\" that \"no fan of the main game [Neverwinter Nights 2] and fantasy stories should miss\" in his reviews of the campaign for the game magazines PC Games and PC Action.\n\nThe release of \"Herz der Finsternis\" was followed by the release of the first part of the \"Der Fluch der Zwerge\" (\"The Curse of the Dwarfs\") series by lead developer Walter Oswald on 5 March 2008. Until January 2011 five parts of the \"Der Fluch der Zwerge\" series have been published. Its second chapter has been described by Andreas Bertits of PC Games as \"extensive and exciting adventure\" and his colleague Marc Brehme wrote in his review of the first part of the third chapter that they (the PC Games team) were once again \"convinced by the quality of the fan extension\".\n\nAfter the release of \"Herz der Finsternis\", Ute Knörzer began the development of the \"Planescape: Die Traumfängerin\" (\"Planescape: The Shaper of Dreams\") series, her most ambitious project so far. The first chapter was released on 11 August 2008 and the sixth and last chapter on 30 August 2009. \"Planescape: Die Traumfängerin\" received the most critical acclaim of all mods developed by Feline Fuelled Games so far with Andreas Bertits of PC Games giving the following review of the second chapter: \"The mod by Ute Knörzer will take you into a strange but fascinating world. The appealing story motivates to continue playing with lots of puzzles and twists. The varied and pretty areas, the game changing decisions, the many interesting non-player characters and the exciting fights create a unique gaming experience.\" The first three chapters of the campaign have also been translated into English and are listed as second highest rated mod on NWVault’s top mods list with a score of 9.91 as of May 2010.\n\nOn 17 July 2010, Feline Fuelled Games released \"Synapsia\", their first mod for \"\". It was rated as an \"outstanding\" mod in a review by Marc Brehme for PC Action. The humorous campaign is an extended version of the original mod for Neverwinter Nights 2 with the same title by Gabriele Schmied that was published on 12 December 2009.\n\nOn 16 October 2011, Feline Fuelled Games released \"Chroniken von Coldramar\" (\"Chronicles of Coldramar\"), a campaign for \"Dragon Age: Origins\" centering on the adventures of three young barbarians. As Feline Fuelled Games' most advanced mod so far, \"Chroniken von Coldramar\" featured a full voice-over carried out by professional voice artists, custom music and almost 90 minutes of cutscenes. In his three-page review of the modification in PC Action 12/2011, Mark Brehme concluded that it \"turned out so well that it may likely pass as an add-on you have to pay for.\"\n\nSince 2013, Feline Fuelled Games has been developing a point-and-click adventure based on Oliver Knörzer’s webcomic \"Sandra and Woo\" called \"Sandra and Woo in the Cursed Adventure\". It’s the team’s first original game and uses the Adventure Game Engine by Visionaire Studio. The game will be published on 5 May 2017 on Steam in German and English and will feature a full voice-over.\n\n"}

Butler (January 30, 1847 (baptized)November 21, 1926) was an Irish American marksman who performed in Wild West variety shows. He was married to sharpshooter Annie Oakley, and while his birth date is listed on his and Oakley's U.S. passport application as February 25, 1852, the obituary for Butler posted by the Associated Press in 1926 has his age as 76, which would mean he was born in 1850. According to baptism registers on file at the National Library of Ireland, Butler was baptized on January 30, 1847. His parents were Michael Butler and Catherine Whelan. He was the oldest of their five children.\n\nFrank Butler was born in County Longford, Ireland, and moved with his family to the United States at the age of 13. He initially worked a series of odd jobs, including one as a glass blower, while living near Camden, New Jersey. Butler married Henrietta Saunders around 1870; they had two children, Edward and Katie. The two divorced a few years later. Sources mentioning Butler's first wife as Elizabeth are inaccurate. Elizabeth is actually his granddaughter, her father being Edward F. Butler.\n\nFrank Butler eventually developed a shooting act and toured with variety shows. After meeting at a shooting competition in Cincinnati, Ohio, Butler married Annie Oakley on August 23, 1876, although he would later claim the date was June 20, 1882. They developed their shooting act in 1882 when Oakley stood in for Butler's sick partner, John Graham. In 1884, the Butlers joined the Sells Brothers Circus. From 1885 to 1901, they were a fixture on \"Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show\". As Oakley became the star attraction, Butler became her manager and wrote articles and press releases. Oakley said that the financial part was always in her husband's hands. Oakley returned to performing between 1911–1913, this time with Vernon Seaver's \"Young Buffalo Show\", with Butler again as her manager. Butler also worked as a representative of the Union Metallic Cartridge Company and as a salesman for the Remington Arms Company.\n\nAfter they retired, Frank Butler and Annie Oakley Butler had brief residencies in New York City and Nutley, New Jersey, as well as Cambridge, Maryland, and Pinehurst, North Carolina, before returning to Ohio. Their house in Cambridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nAnnie died on November 3, 1926, in Greenville, Ohio. One biographer reported that Butler stopped eating after his wife's passing, leading to his own death from malnutrition and starvation eighteen days later, on November 21. According to another biographical source, the death certificate listed the cause of his death as senility. Butler was living with Oakley's younger sister, Hulda Haines, in Ferndale, Michigan, at the time of his death.\n\nThe musical \"Annie Get Your Gun\" is loosely based on the lives of Annie Oakley and Frank Butler. Ray Middleton originated the role of Frank in the musical opposite Ethel Merman as Annie. Howard Keel starred in the film version opposite Betty Hutton. Bruce Yarnell played Butler in a 1966 Lincoln Center revival, with Ethel Merman again as Annie Oakley. Tom Wopat played the role of Butler in the 1999 Broadway revival. In 1957, a television production starring Mary Martin and John Raitt was broadcast on NBC.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31180529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31180529", "title": "Hindi theatre", "text": "Hindi theatre\n\nHindi theatre primarily refers to theatre performed in the Hindi language, including dialects such as Khari boli and Hindustani. Hindi theatre is produced mainly in\nNorth India, and some parts of West India and Central India, which include Mumbai and Bhopal. Hindi theatre has its roots in the traditional folk theatre of North India, like Ram lila and Raslila, and also influenced by distant Sanskrit drama. Starting with Bhartendu Harishchandra in the late 19th century and subsequent playwrights like Jaishankar Prasad, Mohan Rakesh, Hindi theatre came of age in the 1940s and 50s, when IPTA movement created a new brand of theatre practitioners in Hindi speaking areas, especially with IPTA Mumbai, Prithvi Theatres of thespian Prithviraj Kapoor, and theatre artiste Habib Tanvir, paving way for next generation of artists who came out once National School of Drama, Delhi started functioning in 1959.\n\nThe advent of Mughal empire meant the lasting and definite end of Sanskrit as everyday language and along with it theatre traditions, though it also gave birth to a synergistic traditions of Urdu and Hindustani languages, that developed in the aftermath of a fast amalgamating diverse cultures. Traditional folk theatre which included Ramlila, Raslila and nautanki had evolved despite the absence of royal patronage and where it was present, as in the case Ramlila of Kashi Kingdom, in Ramnagar, Varanasi, it evolved into a highly evolved form, with shifting locations. Elsewhere in Awadh, Wajid Ali Shah had been experimenting forms like thumri and stage style known as \"rahasa\", it achieved a definite style in a play believed to be commissioned by him, \"Inder Sabha\", an Urdu play by Agha Hasan Amanat, first staged in 1853.\n\nBesides a separate tradition of Maithili plays, which flourished in the 17th century in present-day Bihar, North India had a pre-existing tradition of folk theatre, this included Braj Bhasa verse plays in the 18th century, Swang, the operatic tradition, which featured full-throated male singers and dancing by female impersonators, which evolved from reciting popular folk ballads and epics, and by the 1860s they were being performed across Meerut, Delhi and Banaras, and illustrated librettos, known as \"Sangits\" were being printed in Devanagari script. In the coming decades, it too got influenced by Parsi theatre, and further developed in content both thematic and music, in the 1890s onwards, which somewhere in the early 20th-century started being called nautanki, after the tale of a \"Nautanki Shahzadi\" became a popular theme. However this form lost much of its popularity and films made into road to rural area after the 1940s.\n\nMeanwhile, with the discovery of Kalidas’s \"Abhijnanasakuntalam\" by Western scholars, it became the first Indian drama to be translated into a Western language, by Sir William Jones in 1789. In the next a hundred years, there were at least 46 translations in twelve European languages. This in turn initiated a concerted study and interest of Sanskrit drama tradition. In time the full extent of ancient Indian theatre's prowess came into light, which had been long lost, as classical Sanskrit drama mostly written from the 4th and 8th century AD faded out, with death of Sanskrit as a spoken language by the 10th century, only to be discovered many centuries later.\n\nJust as the first capital of British India, Calcutta, saw the rise of Bengali theatre in the light of Bengal renaissance early 19th century, at the same time Parsi theatre was coming up in Mumbai, inspired by English-style playhouses which had come up in the late 18th century in Mumbai and Kolkata, exclusively for the Raj gentry. Taking over the same proscenium stages, Parsi theatre took cue their European theatricality, but it brought in Indian themes, thus it \"blended realism and fantasy, music and dance, narrative and spectacle, earthy dialogue and ingenuity of stage presentation, integrating them into a dramatic discourse of melodrama. The Parsi plays contained crude humour, melodious songs and music, sensationalism and dazzling stagecraft.\" Though it originally was in Gujarati language, by the 1870s, a flourishing Parsi theatre lead to the creation numerous travelling theatre companies, though they mostly used Indianised versions of Shakespeare’s plays initially, soon Indian legends, epic and mythological tales made an appearance as source material, as Parsi theatre companies started travelling across North India, and employed native writers to churn out scripts in Hindustani the popular language in the territory, akin to Urdu, the court language in the Mughal era. These sources had also provided themes to the native Swang tradition, leading to cross-enrichment after \"Victoria Natak Mandali\" became the first Parsi theatre company to perform in Varanasi, in 1875. These theatre companies presented their mix of pure entertainment and nationalism during the Indian freedom struggle. This return of written dramatic text to theatre, after centuries, made Parsi theatre not just the role model for the first Indian talkies, as numerous Paris theatre producers moved to cinema, but also gave birth to a theatre tradition, that continued even after Parsi theatre died out as the talkies made their first appearance. Panned by Hindi litterateurs, Bhartendu and Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi, Parsi theatre through its veritable presence, however provoked the elite theatre of refinement as a clear reaction.\n\nEarly development of modern Hindi theatre can be traced to the work of Bharatendu Harishchandra (1850–1885), a theatre actor, director, manager, and playwright based in Varanasi (Banaras), who is also the father of modern Hindi literature as in his short life of 35 years, he edited two magazines, \"Kavi vachan Sudha\" and \"Harishchandra chandrika\", wrote numerous volumes of verse in Braj bhasa, essays and eighteen plays, thus laying the foundation of modern Hindi prose style. Well-versed in folk theatre styles and oral literary traditions of the region, he was influenced by the Bengal Renaissance, however his principle influence was the ancient Sanskrit Drama, many of which he translated and established a stream of dramaturgy which has run parallel to development of the Western drama, though he even translated a Shakespeare's play. Rooted in the rising tide of Indian nationalism, he is most noted for his politically charged plays like, \"Andher nagari\" (City of Darkness) written in 1881, a clear satire on the British Raj, as it implied that a society which tolerates a lawless state is doomed to fail, and \"Neel Darpan\" (Indigo Mirror) on plight of indigo-plantation worker under the British Raj, which used the Dramatic Performances Act of 1876 to the ban many such subversive plays. Eventually Bharatendu became director of \"Hindi Natak Samaj\" (Hindu National Theatre) in Banaras.\n\nAfter Bhartendu whose productions were largely funded by himself or at times by Maharaja of Kashi, Hindi theatre went through a phase of struggle, due to lack of sponsors, impresarios or efficient theatre managers, thus there was hardly any professional theatre for many decades, discouraging writers to take to playwrighting, even works of important playwrights of this period, Jaishankar Prasad and Upendranath Ashk were mostly read, yet hardly staged. Prevalent conservatism didn't allow the female actors to take to stage and unlike Marathi theatre of Mumbai or Bengali theatre of Calcutta, Hindi theatre remained a struggling force, despite the presence of a large audience, which went to the extent of the entertainment-driven Parsi theatre companies. Only a handful of amateur theatre groups presented their works at improvised or makeshift stages, in a period when like many popular writers, intellectuals too had turned away from theatre. The arrival of talkies in 1931, with \"Alam Ara\", meant outflow of Hindi theatre audience that had already dwindled away after the incursions by Parsi theatre across the Hindi-speaking belt. Soon theatre actors, director, writers and technicians followed suit, shifting to Mumbai, the base for Hindi cinema, where the promise of easy money from studios was too captivating to resist. As a result, numerous theatre companies and playhouses closed down and some started showing cinema, the new medium of the age. As the masses moved away from theatre, lured by the glitz of cinema, which Parsi theatre provided readily till now, theatre landscape was now populated by an educated and sophisticated audience, moving away from cinema in response to its escapism, looking for realistic and socially-relevant plays.\n\n20th-century Hindi theatre received a fresh impetus through Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA). Though formed in 1942, with left-wing ideologies, after the All India People's Theatre Conference was held in Mumbai in 1943, IPTA Mumbai was formed An important contribution of IPTA was that it was first time that women started taking part in theatre in such a number. It created and inspired a generation of theatre practitioners and playwrights, like Krishan Chander, Kaifi Azmi, Balraj Sahni, Mohan Segal, Dina Pathak, Shanti Bardhan, Durga Khote, and others, one of them was Prithviraj Kapoor who found Prithvi Theatres, a travelling theatre troupe, based in Mumbai in 1944, with actors like Prithviraj himself, apart from Uzra Butt, and Zohra Sehgal. The group was largely funded by Prithviraj Kapoor's film career and functioned till in 1960, when Prithviraj Kapoor's ill health forced its closure before his death in 1972.\n\nSangeet Natak Akademi (SNA), The National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama, was established by the Government of India in 1952, to promote performing arts. Another big change in the realm of Hindi theatre was the establishing of National School of Drama in Delhi in 1959, which had \"Bharatiya Natya Sangh\" (BNS) as its precursor. BNS, with the assistance from UNESCO, independently established the Asian Theatre Institute (ATI) in 1958, and in July 1958, ATI was taken over by the SNA, and merged with newly formed NSD, which initially functioned under SNA before it became an autonomous organisation. With its principal instruction language being Hindi, and stalwarts like Ebrahim Alkazi and Shanta Gandhi, in the coming decades it produced a number a noted theatre actors and directors. The National School of Drama Repertory Company was set up in 1964, with actor-director Om Shivpuri as its first head, followed by Manohar Singh, and other actors like Uttara Baokar, Sudha Shivpuri and Surekha Sikri. RADA-trained Alkazi turned out to be the most influential director in the post-independence period; his Hindi productions of Sanskrit classics, like \"Abhijnana Shakuntalam\", Dharamvir Bharati's \"Andha Yug\", Girish Karnad's \"Tughlaq\", and the realism of his take on Mohan Rakesh's \"Asadh Ka Ek Din\" brought a fresh approach to theatricality, and sophistication to Hindi theatre, and set up standards that inspired an entire generation. His production of Dharamvir Bharati's \"Andha Yug\" premiered in 1964 at the Firoz Shah Kotla and was attended by prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nA pioneer of the modern theatre movement in North India, Raj Bisaria- a highly revered stage director, he has a through grounding in western classics and contemporary dramatic works. Raj Bisaria tried that the dramatic and performing arts conform to a professional discipline and communicate through a new aesthetic medium. His plays are concerned with man-women relationship, and social issues of special concern to him. Through the productions of European and Indian plays since 1966, Raj Bisaria presented a wide spectrum of contemporary world drama as director and designer, setting his own parallel, pursues the theatre of excellence. He has ventured to blend artistic concepts and impulse of the East and the West, the traditional and the modern, and has been passionately devoted to the cause of theatre and acting. It is his firm belief that this art form can be used for its therapeutic qualities for the overall healthy development of personality of the young, apart from being a vehicle for disseminating information, and creating consciousness about social- political issues, as indeed affording aesthetic and ennobling enlightenment and enriching the cultural consciousness of modern India. Largely using his own devices and creative expression he began his work in the English and began to use Hindustani as the spoken medium of expression from the 1973. He has encouraged folk theatre form of UP - the Nautanki.\n\nRaj Bisaria suggested to the State Government that he should start a semi-professional repertory theatre in Uttar Pradesh, in 1974 the State Government went a few steps further and requested him to evolve a scheme for establishing a drama school, which would function as a full-fledged academy of dramatic arts. Bhartendu Academy of Dramatic Arts (BNA), when it was founded in 1975, in Lucknow, (with Raj Bisaria as its founder director) became the first of its kind in the large Hindi belt of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. His major productions of Indian plays have included Dharamvir Bharati's Andha Yug, Badal Sircar's Baqi Itihas, Adya Rangacharya's Suno Janmejaya, Elkunchwar's Garbo, Mohan Rakesh's Aadhe-Adhure, Mohit Chatterjee's Guinea Pig etc. His major and memorable productions have included Maxwell Anderson's Barefoot in Athens; Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, Macbeth, Othello, King Lear; George Bernard Shaw's Candida; Harold Pinter's The Caretaker; Sartre's In Camera; Ionesco's The Lesson; Strindberg's Father, Jean Anouilh's Antigone; and various plays of Chekhov, Ionesco, Tennessee Williams, Shaffer and so on.\n\nIn the next few years, various states also formed their state academies for the arts, which gave boost to the theatre culture, and soon state capitals like Jaipur, Shimla, Chandigarh, Lucknow and Bhopal had their own theatre groups and culture. However, for many years to come, theatre largely remained driven by amateur groups, as full-time theatre did not become a financially viable activity. Most could not afford extensive props, scenery, lighting design, or newspaper advertisements and relied on word of mouth and small amount of postering. Many practitioners maintained regular jobs, either at educational institutions or in the corporate sector and rehearsed after working hours in hired spaces, as hardly any theatre group across Hindi theatre owned their own infrastructure, be it rehearsal space or theatre. Theatre directors often doubled as theatre managers, as impresarios were rare and impresario organisations even rarer, and then it was director's name that attracted the audience. As payments to cast and crew remained arbitrary and severely dependent on the success of the show, many picked up work in other mediums. As state funding was never available for theatre directly, practitioners tried to gain corporate sponsorship, or did \"call shows\" in other cities to raise money.\n\nGradually a number of theatre venues started coming up, both proscenium and experimental, including Sri Ram Centre, Kamani Auditorium (1971), Meghdoot theatre (designed by Alkazi), NSD studio theatre, SNA studio theatre, Abhimanch and many others. While many directors like Alkazi staged plays at historical monuments and various innovative venues, street theatre brought theatre out to the streets completely, including in its content. Just as IPTA-inspired Jana Natya Manch (JANAM) of Safdar Hashmi did in the 1970s and 1980 as did M. K. Raina, who staged his production of Maxim Gorky's \"The Mother\" in front of factories, inspiring many other practitioners to take theatre to the communities. The Bhopal gas tragedy (1984) saw a new wave of protest presentations in many cities, just as Bhisham Sahni wrote \"Muavze\" (Compensation, 1990) later staged by Raina. Eventually Hashmi was killed in 1989, while his production \"Halla Bol\" (Attack) was being performed in front of a factory in Sahibabad near Delhi by political goons. Though by this time street theatre had been discovered as an important tool and medium, with notable directors like Bansi Kaul and Prasanna, street theatre had reached prisons, slums and red-light areas.\n\nHabib Tanvir is another pioneer in Hindi theatre, who first moved to Mumbai in 1943 from native Bilaspur looking for work in Hindi films that is when he came in contact with IPTA and Progressive Writers Association. He moved to Delhi in 1954 and joined hands with 'Hindustani theatre' of Begum Qudsia Zaidi, writer, and theatre director who had important impact on evolving theatre tradition in Delhi, who together with Habib Tanvir, made its debut with the production of a Hindustani version of Kalidas's \"Shakuntala\" and later produced Shudraka's Mrichakatika as \"Mitti Ki Gadi\" (Little Clay Cart) as an operatic version in \"nautanki\"-style, using tribal artists. He successfully wrote and directed \"Agra Bazar\" (1954), before he left for England. After his return from RADA, Habib began his work with Chhattisgarhi tribals, at the Naya Theatre, a theatre company he founded in 1959 in Bhopal, and went on to include indigenous performance forms such as \"nacha\" to create a new theatrical language, later he wrote \"Charandas Chor\" (1975), \"Gaon ka Naam Sasural, Mor Naam Damad\" and \"Kamdeo ka Apna Basant Ritu ka Sapna\" and notably staged, Asghar Wajahat's \"Jis Lahore Nai Dekhya\" (1990). Apart from him, B. V. Karanth too brought in folk forms into his work, staged many productions in Hindi, especially during his stint with the \"Rangamandal repertory\" at the Bharat Bhavan in Bhopal.\n\nIn the 1960s, like other parts of India, modern Hindi Theatre movement also started in Bihar. Satish Anand, actor and director, is the maker of modern Hindi theatre in Bihar. He is known as trend setter in contemporary modern Indian theatre. Satish Anand established his own theatre group Kala Sangam at Patna, capital of Bihar in 1962. Created a very healthy theatre environment and popularize Hindi plays and theatre by constantly and regularly staging plays like Dharmvir Bharti's Andha Yug, Mudrarakshash's Merjeeva, Mohan Rakesh's Adhe-Adhure, Ashadh Ka Ek Din and Lahron ke Rajhans, Badal Sircar's Baki Itihas, Ballabhpur Ki Roopkatha, Pagla Ghora and Juloos, vijay Tendulkar's Khamosh Adalat jari hai, Jat Hi Puchho Sadhu Ki,Gireesh Karnad's Tughlaq, Sophocles Greek tragedy Oedipus, Rambriksha Benipuri's Ambapali, Shanti Mehrotra's Thahra Hua Pani, Ek Tha Gadha, Kisi Ek Phool Ka Naam Lo, Godan, Chandrashekhar Kambar's Aur Tota Bola, Ibsen's Enemy of the people(Janshatru), Ben Johnson's Volpony (Chor Ke Ghar Mor), Delhi Uncha Sunati Hai, Manoj Mitr's Rajdarshan, Debashish Majumdar's Tamrapatra,Sushil Kumar Singh's Singhasan Khali Hai, Bertolt Brecht's Three Penny Opera ( Do Takkey Ka Swang), Jyoti Mahpseker’s Beti Aayee Hai etc. Kala Sangam’s director Satish Anand had taken every new production as a theatre workshop. He worked hard and trained actors-actresses in every department. Production of Adhe-Adhure in 1973 was considered a great happening in History of the cultural field of Bihar. This incident was considered as renaissance of theatre in Bihar. Kala Sangam always preferred to take up socio-political-economic issues in its plays. Variety in designing the play-productions with innovative ideas and high class powerful performances injected and created a keen interest for theatre among the people of Bihar. The conservative and orthodox society opened up slowly and started liberalizing their views about theatre and its actors-actresses. A large number of working women and school-college-going girls were allowed by their guardians and parents to participate actively in plays and they made their presence felt with their talents. Hundreds of boys and girls were trained by Satish Anand during these years. The quality and class of Kala Sangam’s play-productions established Kala Sangam as one of the leading theatre group of India. Patna became the one of the most theatre-active center of India in 70s, 80s and 1990s. Kala Sangam had organised its first theatre festival and first all India theatre Seminar in 1978. Kala Sangam presented its five plays, \"Andha Yug, Ashadh Ka Ek Din, Lahron Ke Rajhans, Ballabhpur Ki Roopkatha and Singhasan Khali Hai\". The subject of the All India theatre seminar was \"Aaj Ka Natak Aur Rangmanch\" (Today's Drama & theatre) Mr. B.V Karanth, Dr. Pratibha Agarwal and Sachidanand Hiranand Vatsyayan were the guest speaker of this seminar. 2nd Kala Sangam's Theatre festival and All India theatre Seminar was organised in 1979. Scholar theatre critic Nemi Chand Jain, Dhyaneshwar Nadkarni had participated in the seminar and also witnessed plays presented in the festival. Kala Sangam had organised its nine theatre festivals from 1978 to 1995 respectively. Kala Sangam’s work had inspired many people in Bihar to start theatrical activities in their respective places.\nIn 1984 Satish Anand evolved a new theatre idiom 'BIDESIA STYLE' for Modern Indian theatre by using indigenous traditional folk theatre elements. Satish Anand started his research. Conceptualized the form and finalized its Format. Evolved a new Theatrical Idiom for Modern Indian Theatre ‘BIDESIA’ based on Lesser-Known Traditional Theatrical Folk Forms of Bihar, LAUNDA NAACH & NAACH PARTIES (With Special reference to Bhikhari Thakur’s Naach Party), Traditional Songs, Traditional Music, Traditional Dances, Folk Culture, Life-Cycle, Rituals, Customs, Faith & Belief, Life styles, Habits, Behavior, Festivals & Celebrations etc. of Bihar. Format of BIDESIA style consists of Theatrical elements, chosen very carefully from above & creatively used in this style with contemporary & modern sensibility. Bidesia style is a new Theatrical Idiom (Rang Bhasha) of Modern Indian Theatre which works as a Bridge between Rural & Urban Theatre. Initially short stories written by Phanishwar Nath 'Renu', short stories by Mandhkar Gangadhar were read but at last one day a short story 'Amli' which was published in \"Sarika\" Hindi magazine was selected. Renowned Hindi Writer Kamleshwar was its Editor. Satish Anand liked that story and started work on it. He completely rearranged the incidents and sequences, created new characters, incidents and situations according to the thought format of Bidesia style. Bhojpri dialect was used in the play. Traditional music, songs & their tunes were selected according to the conflict, mood, feelings of the characters and situations. Best part of that Every actor of Kala Sangam contributed his knowledge and experience in Adaptation of a short story ‘AMALI’, Adaptation of a Shudraka's Sanskrit play ‘MARICHCHHAKATIKA’(Mati Gari) and Phanishwar Natn's Hindi Novel ‘MAILA ANCHAL in Bidesia Style. And in 1994, a new play Rabindranath Tagore’s ‘MUKTADHARA’ Produced & presented in BIDESIA style. Kala Sangam also toured Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bhubaneshwar, Bhopal, Ujjain, Guwahati, Kota, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Hanuman Garh, Ganga Nager, Lucknow, Allahabad etc. with its plays. All these plays had been presented very successfully in various Zonal & National Folk Theatre Festivals organized in different parts of India respectively. This Bidesia style had been recognized by Theatre Practitioners and Theatre Critics & appreciated by audience throughout the country. Fascinating part is that this style has also influenced Modern Indian Theatre. Kala Sangam had staged Muktadhara in Bidesia Style in Bharangam, Delhi in 2000.\nKolkata-based, Shyamanand Jalan (1934–2010) is credited for the renaissance period of modern Indian theatre and especially the Hindi theatre in Kolkata from the 1960s to the 1980s. He was the first to perform modernist Mohan Rakesh, starting with his magnum opus \"Ashadh Ka Ek Din\" (One Day in Ashad) in 1960 and in the coming years bridged the gap between Hindi theatre and Bengali theatre, by mounting Hindi productions of works by Bengali playwrights, like Badal Sircar's \"Evam Indrajit\" (1968) and \"Pagla Ghora\" (1971), which in turn introduced Sircar to rest of the country. He co-founded theatre group \"Anamika\" in 1955 with Pratibha Aggarwal, a Hindi writer and a great granddaughter of Bhartendu Harishchandra, which played a pioneering role in the revival of Hindi theatre., and remained with it till 1972, and during this period it created a large audience for Hindi theatre in Bengali speaking Kolkata. Subsequently along with his wife Chetana Jalan, the well-known Kathak dancer and stage actress, and actor Kulbhushan Kharbanda, he left Anamika in 1971 and established \"Padatik\" (literally foot-soldier) theatre group in 1972, of which he was the founding director. This gave him a chance to venture into bolder themes, like those in Vijay Tendukar's plays like \"Gidhade\" (The Vultures) (1973) and \"Sakharam Binder\" (1979), and Mahashweta Devi's \"Hazar Chaurasi Ki Ma\" (Mother of 1084) (1978), with his new venture he stepped beyond Indianism, modernism, or experimentalism. Another theatre director, who practiced Hindi theatre in Kolkata, which is largely Bengali speaking area was Usha Ganguly (b. 1945), who founded \"Rangakarmee\" theatre group in 1976, known for its productions like \"Mahabhoj\", \"Rudali\", \"Court Martial\", and \"Antaryatra\". Apart from her, theatre directors like, Satyadev Dubey, Dinesh Thakur and Nadira Babbar also practiced Hindi theatre in Mumbai, till then home for Marathi and Gujarati theatre.\n\nIn the 1960s and 70s, many actors from National School of Drama started working in Hindi films, though many continued theatre activities on the side. Many theatre actors and directors, like Om Shivpuri, who had formed \"Dishantar\" theatre group in Mumbai, and Dina Pathak worked successful in mainstream cinema as well, while many others, along with FTII, Pune actors, made name in the Parallel cinema, which came of age in the late 1970s. This included, Sai Paranjpye, Om Puri, Naseeruddin Shah and Pankaj Kapoor. Most colleges now had their own theatre societies, which became breeding ground for future practitioners. Later in the 1980s, with increasing popularity of television soap operas, home videos and cable TV, audience moved away from theatre for a while, before theatre resurrected itself in the late 1990s with a new breed of theatre directors who sought not just new themes and narratives, but also took to absurd, expressionist, experimental and improvisational theatre with greater zeal. They also started to find sponsors in the corporate sector and numerous theatre directors were able to sustain themselves on theatre alone. Two challenges that came up in the coming years was that even now actors took their theatre careers as a prep for film careers, and secondly most theatre actors learned via working in theatre groups, as avenues of theatre education remained limited, though some organisation that opened in other cities beyond Delhi, like Jaipur, Lucknow, and Chandigarh, which had playwright-director Balwant Gargi guiding new phase of theatre, offered young aspirants to learn the craft.\n\nAt Bhopal theatre director and playwright Prof. Satish Mehta and his actor wife Jyotsna Mehta established the theatre group \"Prayog\". The group was started in the year 1976 at Indore and shifted to Bhopal in the year 1983. Since then the group is active and staging the plays regularly. Well known plays of \"Prayog\" are \"Andhon ka hathi\", \"Juloos\", \"Bakari\" \"Dulari Bai\",\" Jadugar jungle\",\"Khamosh adalat jari hai\",\"Ek aur Dronacharya\", \"Jis Lahore nahi Dekhya\",\"Kajal ka jadu\",\"Kandhe par baitha tha shap\" \"Mujhe Amrita Chahiye\" and many others. Satish Mehta directed all these plays with his own original style. He has got credit to perform many street plays, too.\n\nMrityunjay Prabhakar is one of the major young Hindi theatre director and playwright who emerged on Indian Theatre Scene in the last decade of the 20th century and established himself as a significant theatre activist in first decade of the 21st century. He started his theatre career from Patna during his graduation days. He has worked with several theatre groups like Abhiyan, Prerna, Mach Art group and Prangan in Patna. Later, he co-founded the group Abhiyan along with his friends. When he arrived Delhi for his further studies in Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. Here he worked with famous groups like Rang Saptak, Bahroop and Dastak. Later he founded his own group named SEHAR in 2005 and started working rigorously. He has got trained under leading figures of Indian Drama and Theatre world through different workshops he attended like Habib Tanvir, B.V. Karanth, Prasanna, Ratan Thiyam, D. R. Ankur and many more. He has worked with directors like D.R. Ankur, Lokendra Arambam, H.S. Shiva Prakash, Surendra Sharma, Parvez Akhtar, Vijay Kumar, Javed Akhtar Khan, Suman Kumar and others. He has worked as an actor, director, set designer, light designer and organiser in theatre.\n\nMrityunjay Prabhakar works primarily as a Theatre Director and playwright with his group SEHAR. He is the founder-director of theatre troupe, SEHAR (Society of Education, Harmony, Art, Culture and Media Reproduction) (Registered under Society Act) in 2007. He has directed more than two dozens plays among them 'Sabse Udas Kavita'[2], 'Khwahishen' [3],'Jee Humen To Natak Karna Hai', [4],'Dhruvswamini'[5], 'Vithalala' and 'Suicide'[6] have got special attention from the larger section of the society. His plays has been performed in different cities and theatre centres of the country apart from Delhi. His plays were part of some of the important theatre festivals of the country.\n\nMrityunjay Prabhakar's originally written play \"Sadho Dekho Jag Baudana\" was published by InkLit Publication. He has also written plays \"Aao Natak Natak Khelen\", 'Khwahishen', 'Jee Humen To Natak Karna Hai', 'Suicide', 'Hey Ram', 'Teri Meri Kahani Hai', 'Karnav' and others, which has been performed by different groups and directors in various theatre centres of the country. He has adopted famous Keniyan playwright Ngugi Wa Thiong's play 'The Black Hermit' as 'Jayen To Jayen Kahan'. The adoptation was first performed by NSD Graduate Randhir Kumar in 2005 in Patna. Later he reproduced the play in 2010 with SEHAR in Delhi. He has adopted H.S. Shivaprakash famous Kannad play 'Mochi Madaiah' in Hindi which was directed by Lokendra Arambam and published by Yash Publication, Delhi. An anthology on Contemporary Indian Theatre titled 'Samkaleen Rangkarm' is also credited on his name published by InkLit Publication. His Hindi Poetry Collection 'Jo Mere Bheetar Hain' was published by Akademi of Letters (Sahitya Akademi), India.\n\nKeeping Hindi theatre alive in the hub of Marathi theatre is not an easy task in Pune But Swatantra Theatre has been doing this job with immense determination and dedication since 2006. Headed by Abhijeet Choudhary along with Dhanashree Heblikar the group has put up more than 65 performances in the last 6 (2006) years. Picking up issues of social and contemporary relevance with its plays, Swatantra has filled up a void that Hindi audiences in the city often rued. The group continues to work, coming up with at least one performance every month. Mashal Jalao Diye Se, based on the Delhi gang rape case, is their latest play. In association with FTII, Pune Swatantra Theatre celebrate Hindi Theatre Festival on HINDI DIWAS. \n\nBhartendu's father wrote a play titled, \"Nahul natak\" in 1859, which is the \"first Hindi drama of literary scope in the modern period\", though there is little record of its staging. The first drama to be staged was Shital Prasad Trivedi's \"Janaki mangal\" at Banaras theatre, also known as \"purana nachghar\", in 1868, in which Bhartendu himself made his stage debut as an actor, and in the coming years he wrote prolifically wrote eighteen plays till his death in 1885. Pre-Bhartendu period, had created mostly mythological and epic inspired plays like, \"Hanuman-natak\", \"Amasya sar natak\", \"Vichitra natak\", \"Shakuntala upakhyan\", \"Anand Raghunandan\" and \"Inder sabha\".\n\nJust as Bhartendu Harishchandra wrote \"Satya Harishchandra\" (1875), \"Bharat Durdasha\" (1876) and \"Andher Nagari\" (1878), in the late 19th century, Jaishankar Prasad became the next big figure in Hindi playwriting with plays like \"Skanda Gupta\" (1928), \"Chandragupta\" (1931) and \"Dhruvswamini\" (1933), Maithili Sharan Gupt also wrote three plays, \"Tilottama\" (1916), \"Chandrahaas\" (1921) and \"Anagha\" (1925). The next phase of important plays after Prasad, came with Badrinath Bhatt, next it was Lakshminarayan Mishra's work which broke away from existing pattern of subject treatment and presentation and is known for its realism, and unmistakable influence of Ibsen as seen in \"Sansyasi\" (1931), \"Raksha Ka Mandir\" (1931), \"Mukti ka rahasya\" (1932), \"Rajyoga\" (1934) and \"Sindoor ki Holi\" (1934), which tackle social problem with marked directness. An important event in this period was establishment of \"Hans\", a literary magazine based in Varanasi, by noted writer Premchand in 1938, which published numerous important one-act plays in the coming years, further giving boost to the craft.\n\nAs the Independence struggle was gathering steam playwrights broaching issues of nationalism and subversive ideas against the British, yet to dodge censorship, they adapted themes from mythology, history and legend and used them as vehicle for political messages, a trend that continues to date, though now it was employed to bring out social, personal and psychological issues rather than clearly political.\n\nPost-independence the emerging republic threw up new issues for playwrights to tackle and express, and Hindi playwriting showed greater brevity and symbolism, but it was not as prolific as in case with Hindi poetry or fiction. Yet we have playwrights like Jagdish Chandra Mathur (\"Konark\") and Upendranath Ashk (\"Anjo Didi\"), who displayed a steadily evolving understanding of thematic development, theatrical constraints and stagecraft, and Gyandev Agnihotri stood out for his symbolism, wit and satire as visible in classic \"Shuturmurg\" written in the 1960s before moving into screenwriting for Hindi films in the 1970s.\n\nThe first important play of the 20th century was \"Andha Yug\" (The Blind Epoch), by Dharamvir Bharati, which came in 1953, found in \"Mahabharat\", both an ideal source and expression of modern discontent and predicament of a society riddled with corruption. Starting with Ebrahim Alkazi it was staged by numerous directors. With his verse play \"Uttar Priyadarshini\", Agyeya found the story Ashoka's redemption, reflecting the modern call for peace. \"Ashadh Ka Ek Din\" (One Day in Ashadh), the debut play of modernist Mohan Rakesh was published in 1958, based on the life of Sanskrit dramatist Kalidas, and is considered the first Modern Hindi play. Mohan Rakesh went on to write two more plays, \"Aadhe Adhure\" (Halfway House) and \"Leheron Ke Raj Hans\" (Great Swans of the Waves) and left one, \"Paon Taley Ki Zameen\" (Ground beneath the Feet) unfinished by the time of his death in 1972, but he had shifted the landscape of Hindi theatre. Today, his rise as a prominent playwright in the 1960s is seen as the coming of age of Modern Indian playwriting in Hindi, just as Vijay Tendulkar did it in Marathi, Badal Sircar in Bengali, and Girish Karnad in Kannada. His plays have now become classics of Indian theatre, have been performed by almost every major Indian theatre director and have been part of the University curriculum in Hindi-speaking areas.\n\nInitially inspired by western dramaturgy, in structure and movement, many initial playwrights adapted Ibsen and Brecht, but soon returned to roots and found both content and form, giving birth to the movement called \"theatre of the roots\", a concerted attempt to 'decolonise' Indian theatre and distance itself from western theatre. Be it Habib Tanvir's \"Agra Bazar\" (1954) and \"Charandas Chor\" (1975), which brought in new indigenous forms of expression, On the other hand, there were younger playwrights like Surendra Verma, with his \"Surya Ki Antim Kiran Se Surya Ki Pahli Kiran Tak\" (From Sunset to Sunrise, 1972), \"Draupadi\" and \"Athwan sarga\" (Eighth Chapter, 1976), rapidly experimented with forms and formats, and writers who ventured into playwrighting to produce important works, like Bhisham Sahni who has been associated with both IPTA and Progressive Writers Association, most noted for his partition-novel \"Tamas\" wrote, \"Hanush\" (1977), \"Madhavi\" (1982) and \"Muavze\" (1993).\n\nOver the years the repertoire of Hindi plays has expanded to include translated and adapted works of successful playwrights from other languages, like Vijay Tendulkar, Girish Karnad, Mahesh Elkunchwar, G. P. Deshpande and Badal Sircar (Evam Indrajit, 1963, \"Pagla Ghoda\", 1967).\n\nDanish Iqbal's \"Dara Shikoh\" is a modern classic which was staged by director M S Sathyu. In the words of noted critic Ramesh Chand Charlie Dara Shikoh is a turning point of traditional theatrical sensibilities. Use of Wali Deccani's period poetry provides this Play with a very rare artistic and historical context. Dazzling use of Kathak choreography by \"Rani Khanum\" and her Troupe, and authentic costumes including head gear, swords and period art work was a treat for the eyes. This Play had a good run at cities like Delhi, Gurgaon and Banglore.\n\nAnother notable Drama of Danish Iqbal is \"Dilli jo ek Shehr Thaa\" depicts the life and times of a Delhi lost during the invasion of Nadir Shah. He was awarded \"Mohan Rakesh Samman\" for this Play by the Chief Minister of Delhi Sheila Dikshit. Recently this Play was staged by Bharti Sharma of Kshitij Group and had Delhi audience mesmerised by its production values and grandeur.\n\nDanish also wrote \"Sahir\"' on the life and times of Sahir Ludhyanvi which was staged in Delhi for a packed audience and became a landmark production for the use of old film songs as part of Dramatic Narrative. Directed by NRI Director \"Pramila Le Hunt\" this play became a commercial success and had audience wishing more and more of Sahir. Danish Iqbal also wrote \"Kuchh Ishq Kiya Kuchh Kaam\" on the life and work of legendary poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz and \"Sarah Ka Sara Aasman\" on the poet \"Sarah Shagufta\", besides the biographical Drama 'Ghalib' which used Ghalib's poetry for the basic narrative and was staged at Dubai for the expatriate Indian Community. Danish had also given the block buster 'Woh Akhiri Hichki' and 'Ek Thi Amrita'(on the life and times of Amrita Pritam) and some other early works. In recent years he has been using lot of elements of Cinema and mass media to bring theatrical sensibilities closer to the audiences fed with lot of Bollywood. It is a pity that his collected work is not available till now although few versions of 'Dara Shikoh' and 'Ghalib' are available but Dara Shikoh being a costly historical costume Drama it is not easy to stage such a demanding production. 'Dilli Jo Ek Shehr Thaa' has all the markings of a classic stage play combining high voltage conflict with realistic characterisations, treacherous conspiracies, romance, poetry, dances and catchy dialogues.\n\nSayeed Alam is known for his wit and humour and more particularly for Plays like 'Ghalib in New Delhi' 'Big B' and many other gems which are regularly staged for massive turn out of theatre lovers. Maulana Azad is his magnum opus both for its content and style.\n\nShahid's 'Three B' is also a significant Play. He has been associated with many groups like 'Natwa' and others. Zaheer Anwar has kept the flag of Theatre flying in Kolkata. Unlike the writers of previous generation Sayeed, Shahid, Danish and Zaheer do not write bookish Plays but their work is a product of vigorous performing tradition.\n\nDramatech, a Delhi-based theatre group formed by alumni of IIT Delhi in 1984, gave a new dimension to Hindi theatre by translating and staging many English classic plays, both musicals and straight plays. These included Hindi versions of musicals Fiddler on the Roof and Hello Dolly! and plays Agatha Christie's Ten Little Niggers & Witness for the Prosecution; A Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories; Joseph Kesselring's Arsenic and Old Lace. All these were translated, lyrics and directed by Ravi Raj Sagar, in the period 1984–87 and then 2002–12.Reference: www.dramatech.in\n\nThe group's same director also adapted and staged classic stories by Premchand in play Premchand: Three comedies for families and Children in 2012. Stories included in this were Do bailon ki katha, Shatranj ke khiladi, Nimantran.Ref: Review in Deccan Herald: http://www.deccanherald.com/content/269668/premchand-children.html Also: www.dramatech.in An interview with Director Ravi Raj Sagar on Premchand's works and Hindi & Urdu Literature was published in The Times of India: http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-10-02/books/34216836_1_munshi-premchand-stories-comedy-genres\n\nVibha rani is a noted playwright of two Indian languages- Hindi and Mainthili. So far she has written more than 20 full length group, duet and solo plays. Her play \"Doosra Aadmi, Doosari Aurat\" has been awarded with Vishnudas Bhave Award for Playwriting by the Govt. of Maharashtra, 2011. The play was put up in BHARANGAM, 2002 of National School of Drama, New Delhi & currently being staged by various groups across the country. Another play \"Peer Parayee\" is being staged in and around the country by \"Vivechana\", Jabalpur from 2004 onwards. \"Aye Priye Tere Liye\" was staged in Mumbai. \"Life is not a Dream\", Balchanda\", \"Main Krishna Krishn Ki\", \"Ek Nayi Menka\", \"Bhikharin\", \"Naurangi Natni\", \"Bimb- Pratibimb\" are her solo plays, being staged in & around the world. \"Aao Tanik Prem Karen\" and \"Agle Janam Mohe Bitiya Naa Kijo\" had won 1st prize of Mohan Rakesh Samman, 2005. \"Aao Tanik Prem Karen\" had been awarded as the Best play, 2013 and Vibha as the Best female Actor, 2013 by the Govt. of Maharashtra.\n\nOn the other hand, theatre criticism which had also begun with Bhartendu, saw new voices emerging in the mid-20th century, like Lakshmi Narayan Lal, which were now subjecting recent Indian playwriting to touchstone of Ibsen and other western masters. Leading theatre critics were now employed by national dailies, this included Ramesh Chander and Nemichand Jain, and soon a second generation theatre criticism came to the fore in the 1960s, with Kavita Nagpal, Jaidev Taneja, and others. Literary journal also started having sections devoted to theatre criticism and many magazines now ran theatre review columns. In this period, a theatre journal \"Natrang\" edited by NC Jain started publishing, similar journal were brought out by state-run academies like, \"Sangit Natak\" by Sangeet Natak Akademi in Delhi, \"Rangyog\" at Rajasthan Academy in Jodhpur, and \"Chhayanat\" by Uttar Pradesh Academy in Lucknow. Another important development was the rise of documentation, academic research in various streams of Indian theatre by increasing number of theatre scholars, like Kapila Vatsyayan, Anuradha Kapoor and N C Jain.\n\nNat Nimad || Khandwa, M.P.|| 2000|| Vijay Soni\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29731116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29731116", "title": "History (theatrical genre)", "text": "History (theatrical genre)\n\nHistory is one of the three main genres in Western theatre alongside tragedy and comedy, although it originated, in its modern form, thousands of years later than the other primary genres. For this reason, it is often treated as a subset of tragedy. A play in this genre is known as a history play and is based on a historical narrative, often set in the medieval or early modern past. History emerged as a distinct genre from tragedy in Renaissance England. The best known examples of the genre are the history plays written by William Shakespeare, whose plays still serve to define the genre. History plays also appear elsewhere in British and Western literature, such as Thomas Heywood's \"Edward IV\", Schiller's \"Mary Stuart\" or the Dutch genre \"Gijsbrecht van Aemstel\".\n\nPlays with some connection to historic narratives date to the beginnings of Athenian theatre. For one, although many early Greek plays covered subjects that modern audiences consider myth (rather than history), the Greeks did not make such a distinction, incorporating their stories of their gods into the same overarching narrative that included stories of their kings. Furthermore, the earliest surviving work of theatre, \"The Persians\" records an event that was entirely historical, even under the modern understanding of history. A key difference between \"The Persians\" and a history play in the modern sense is the incorporation of supernatural elements into the narrative of the Salamis. Additionally, it primarily dramatizes the Persian reaction to the battle, information that would have been at best a secondary concern for the Greek historian. Thus, although it concerns a verifiable historic event, it differs substantially from the modern genre of \"history plays\" in that it doesn't conform to the modern understanding of history (by presenting unvarifiable supernatural elements as fact) and in that its goals didn't entirely parallel those of ancient Greek historians.\n\nA significant development in the evolution of the history play occurred during the Middle Ages with the rise of mystery plays. Theatre in the Middle Ages arose from traditions surrounding the mass, a ritual that, due to the orthodox theological position that the eucharistic sacrifice reenacts (and even recreates) the sacrifice on the cross, has profound similarities to theatre (and to the types of rituals that gave rise to theatre in ancient Athens). While the regular Sunday liturgy was like theatre, the traditions that evolved around the Easter service \"were\" theatre. Specifically the \"Quem quaeritis?\", explicitly involved the portrayal of characters by the priest and the acolyte.\n\nWith this as a starting point, medieval theatre makers began crafting other plays detailing the religious narratives of Christianity. Plays about saints, especially local saints, were particularly popular in England. These plays conformed to the goals of contemporary historians, often closely paralleling \"Lives of the Saints\" books. They are generally not included in the modern understanding of history plays, however, because they differ significantly from the modern understanding of history by unquestioningly including supernatural phenomena as key elements. The final step in the origin of the modern history play, therefore, would require, as a prerequisit, the evolution of the modern understanding of history.\n\nThe history play first took its modern form in Tudor England. Literary scholar Irving Ribner, in his influential study of the genre, connects the emergence of the history play with \"a new birth of historical writing in England\" during the sisteenth century, which included new books of English history written by Polydore Vergil (1534), Edward Hall (1543), and Raphael Holinshed (1577), among others. While this trend of increasing historical literature has its roots in late Medieval England, it reached a new level of intensity after the ascension of Henry VII with the perceived need to show the justification of the Tudor's position in the monarchy. The motivations of renaissance playwrights generally coincided with those of renaissance historians, so, although England produced many historical works during the Middle Ages, these works were almost completely ignored in favor of more recent historical narratives. In a more recent scholarly work, Ralph Hertel links the performative nature of the history play with a growing sense of English national identity under the early Tudors. \"Englishness,\" in his words, is “considered as something brought forth by the spectators who participate in the theatre event by becoming eye witnesess of sorts of the events staged and who engage in the Englishness displayed theatrically.\"\n\nEarly examples of Tudor history plays include John Skelton's \"Magnyfycence\" (1519). In this work, characters are named in the traditional fashion of a medieval morality play, with the lead named \"Magnificance\" and primary adversaries bearing names such as \"Folly\". Through the plot line and the characters' relationships with each other, however, Skelton assures that his contemporaries in the audience will easily recognize the identities of Henry VII in the title character and Cardinal Thomas Wolsey in Folly. John Bale's \"Kynge Johan\", written 1538, takes another significant step toward the emergence of the secular history play by specifically naming the historic figures associated with his allegorically named characters.\nLater in the century, Christoper Marlowe's \"Edward II\" (1592) was profoundly influential in the development of the history play. While earlier English history plays tried to incorporate as much information as possible from their sources, Marlowe focused on the events that would contribute to his play from a storytelling perspective. In doing so, he not only provided the link between history and tragedy which would be elemental to later English Renaissance history plays but also set a new standard for effective use of the history play as propaganda.\n\nAlthough the history play evolved in England in a time when theatre in general was often viewed with suspicion, it was held up, even among theatre's critics, as an example of what could be valuable in the art form. A significant factor in the favorable treatment that history plays received was the social function that commentators of the time believed that plays of this genre provided. For Thomas Nash and Thomas Heywood, for example, the English history play immortalized English heroes of the past and created a sense of national pride in audiences. Generally speaking, history plays sought to accomplish the goals of historians using the dramatic medium. In the case of playwrights in Renaissance England, this often amounted to historical propaganda in theatrical form.\n\nIn assessing the past hundred years of literary scholarship on this English history play, Brian Walsh writes that \"the center of gravity for work on the history play has remained the political arena. With few exceptions, scholars have tended to focus on the genres topical relevance for Elizabethan and Jacobean questions of national identity, kingly authority, and the interpellation of subjects. The focus has yielded a number of persuasive links between theatrical representation, the domestic and international expansion of state power, and the very day operation of Elizabeth’s and James’s governments.\" \n\nIn addition to those written by Shakespeare, other early modern history plays include John Ford's \"Perkin Warbeck\", and the anonymous plays Edward III, \"Thomas of Woodstock\", and \"Sir Thomas More\".\n\nIn the First Folio, the plays of William Shakespeare were grouped into three categories: comedies, histories, and tragedies. The histories—along with those of contemporary Renaissance playwrights—help define the genre of history plays. Shakespeare's Histories might be more accurately called the \"English history plays.\" These plays dramatize historical events from English history as early as the reign of \"King John\" and as late as \"Henry VIII\". In addition to these two, Shakespeare wrote eight plays covering the continuous period of history between the reigns of Richard II and Richard III. The so-called first tetralogy, apparently written in the early 1590s, deals with the later part of the struggle and includes \"Henry VI, parts one\", \"two\" & \"three\" and \"Richard III\". The second tetralogy, finished in 1599 and including \"Richard II\", \"Henry IV, Part 1\", \"Henry IV, Part 2\" and \"Henry V\", is frequently called the \"Henriad\" after its protagonist Prince Hal, the future Henry V.\n\nShakespeare himself alludes to the recognition of history as an established theatrical genre in \"Hamlet\" when Polonius announces the arrival of \"the best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history...\". \nSeveral other of Shakespeare's other plays listed as tragedies in the First Folio, however, could be classified as history plays according to a broader, more generalized definition. Plays such as \"Julius Caesar\", and \"Antony and Cleopatra\" depict historical events from classical antiquity, for example, while \"King Lear\" and \"Cymbeline\" dramatize the history of ancient Britain and \"Macbeth\" depicts the historical events not of medieval England but rather of medieval Scotland.\n\nA consistent theme in historical drama of both Shakespeare and his English contemporaries revolves around questions of who had legitimate claim to participate in the affairs of the state. Shakespeare's history plays are considered the defining works of the genre. Later playwrights of history plays would either follow his stylistic model or at least have an acute awareness of their stylistic differences with Shakespearean histories.\n\nFollowing the Restoration, the English History as a genre lost much of the momentum that they had gained during the Tudor and Stuart eras. Even the most esteemed genre of English Renaissance theatre, tragedy (to which the history genre had been closely tied from the beginning), had fallen out of style in favor of tragicomedy and comedy. Nevertheless, English playwrights produced numerous plays depicting historical events outside of England including William Davenant's \"The Siege of Rhodes\", John Dryden's \"The Indian Queen\" and \"The Indian Emperor\", Elkanah Settle's \"The Empress of Morocco\".\n\nProductions of history plays often had an intentionally revivalist character. For example, adaptations of Shakespeare's plays, including his histories, were extremely popular.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, Joseph Addison's neo-classical \"Cato, a Tragedy\" could be classified as a history play according to the same broad, generalized definition that would apply to Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\".\n\nPopular recently authored history plays include James Goldman's \"The Lion in Winter\". Criticized as ahistorical it tests the boundaries of the genre, while also poking fun at its conventions. Although, in many respects it has more in common with absurdist comic domestic drama, it retains an essentially historic core. George Bernard Shaw's \"Saint Joan\" has received widespread praise, and has even been compared favorably to Shakespeare's histories. The temporal boundary of history plays is tested in \"Stuff Happens\" by David Hare, which chronicles the events leading up to the Iraq War with only two years separating the author from his subject. The play focuses heavily on the use of exact quotes, with all public speeches given by the main characters being taken word for word from actual quotes.\n"}

It features Karthi in dual roles for the second time after Siruthai as the protagonist and antagonist respectively alongside Nayantara and Sri Divya in the lead roles. The film opened to mixed reviews and made good opening at box office and declared as sleeper hit Santhosh Narayanan composed the film's score and soundtrack. The film was released worldwide on 28 October 2016 (Diwali 2016).\n\nKaashmora (Karthi) and his family lived by cheating people in the name of black magic and dark spirits. One day, a PhD research student Yamini (Sri Divya) joins Kaashmora, only to gather evidence and expose him to the public. Kaashmora's fame brings him to a superstitious and fraudulent Minister (Sharath Lohitashwa). Kaashmora earns the Minister's trust. When income tax department raids the minister's house, he asks his henchmen to transfer all the illegal money to Kaashmora's house. Seeing this as an opportunity to escape and settle abroad, Kaashmora's family escapes with the money. Meanwhile, Chelapathy Rao, a Telugu man seeks Kaashmora's help and brings him to a haunted bungalow in Andhra Pradesh. In the bungalow, Kaashmora is haunted by real ghosts.\n\nBack in Chennai, the Minister learns that Kaashmora is a fraud and sends his henchmen to kill his family. The henchmen try to get Kaashmora from the bungalow but are unable to do so as the ghost beats them all and drags Kaashmora and his family inside the bungalow. Inside, they meet with a broker who got trapped inside the bungalow for a long time. The broker says that the bungalow was once a princess's palace. Ever since her death, residents and owners of the bungalow had met with an ill-fated death. He also tells that there are 13 ghosts in the bungalow. The trapped people meet the ghost of Raj Nayak, the head of all the 12 ghosts. Rajnayak asks Kaashmora to help him and his 12 subordinates reach the spiritual world. He then locks them in the castle. That night, a young girl in Kaashmora's dream leads him to a locked door within the castle.\n\nWaking up, Kaashmora follows the same route, but is stopped by Yamini, who reveals to him that Chelapathy Rao, the man who led him here, died 75 years ago and it was his ghost that led Kaashmora as well as Yamini to the bungalow. Kaashmora searches the castle and gets hold of an old book that dates back 700 years. Raj Nayak (Karthi) was a self-obsessed warlord and a womanizer. The King remained silent and didn't interfere with Rajnayak's growing atrocities because of his military prowess. One day, the princess Rathna Mahadevi (Nayanthara) elopes with her lover who is the enemy nation's prince. The King announces that he'll marry off Rathna and give away half of his kingdom to the man who finds her. Rajnayak kills the prince and forcibly brings Rathna back. He demands to be wedded to the princess, and wants the other half of the kingdom as dowry. When opposed, he kills the crown Prince and the King. He marries Rathna and coronates himself as the King. However, Rathna has other plans. She and her friends seduces Rajnayak and his subordinates. While his subordinates are burned alive, Rajnayak is beheaded by Rathna. However, he kills her before dying. Before breathing her last, Rathna places a curse on the 13 men, banishing them from reaching the spiritual world.\n\nEver since, Rajnayak and the other 12 ghosts had haunted the palace and its occupants. An exorcist once had predicted that Raj Nayak and the other ghosts would reach eternal power if they are able to sacrifice the lives of 5 people belonging to the same family with the same birth star (Rohini). The sacrifice should be performed by a lady who is the only woman in her generation. This should happen during the Navakaali Pournami that occurs once every 1000 years. Kaashmora recollects that his family members all have the same birth sign and that Yamini is the only woman in her family.\n\nThat night, Navakaali Pournami occurs and Rajnayak forces Kaashmora and his family to a guillotine. The young girl from Kaashmora's dream apparates and she turns out to be Rathna Mahadevi's reincarnation. While Rathna and Raj Nayak fight each other, Kaashmora fends off the subordinate ghosts with the help of a magical sword. Rathna's conscience leads him to a chamber within the castle where Rajnayak's remains are. Using the sword, Kaashmora destroys the remains, making Rajnayak vulnerable. Rathna destroys Raj Nayak's spirit and it goes to the underworld. The other spirits flee the castle to the spiritual world. Kaashmora and his family get out of the castle and he claims that he has destroyed the spirits and cleansed the centuries haunted bungalow. Kaashmora's family told the politician that the money stolen from the politician has been kept by the Ghost.\n\n\nProduction was begun in the first week of May 2015. Karthi plays two roles: a king (Raj Nayak), a youth (Kaashmora). Nayanthara plays a princess and Sri Divya an investigative journalist, and Vivek was cast as Karthi’s father. Karthi learnt horseriding in preparation for the film.\n\nThe music for the movie was composed by Santhosh Narayanan. Other crew includes the art director Rajeevan, editor V J Sabu Joseph, and cinematographer Om Prakash. The film was marketed as a mix of action and comedy.\n\nThink Music acquired the audio rights for the Tamil version, as well as the dubbed Telugu Version. The film's songs and background music are composed by Santhosh Narayanan with lyrics by Muthamil and Laitha Anand. There are six tracks in the album including two instrumentals. The film's soundtrack was released on 7 October 2016.\n\nThe satellite rights of the film were sold to Jaya TV.\n\nIt's been said that the \"3D Face scan\" technology has been used in this film. Karthi's face has been 3D scanned for an important sequence which will be running 15 minutes. Kaashmora comprises 80 minutes of VFX scenes. Director Gokul says that, 360-degree omnidirectional camera rig is used for shooting a particular sequence and this is the first time for an Indian movie to use this technology. This technology covers entire 360 degree, approximately entire sphere. Omnidirectional cameras are used where large visual field coverage is needed, such as in panoramic photography. This camera is used in this movie to shoot a song and few scenes. Art direction team has erected 17 sets in and around Chennai to make simultaneous filming process and to save time.\n\n"}

In 1919 Vertov and his future wife, the talented film editor Elizaveta Svilova, plus several other young filmmakers created the group. In 1922 they were joined by Mikhail Kaufman, who had just returned from the civil war. From 1922 to 1923 Vertov, Kaufman, and Svilova published a number of manifestos in avant-garde journals which clarified the Kinoks' positions vis-à-vis other leftist groups.\n\nThe Kinoks rejected \"staged\" cinema with its stars, plots, props and studio shooting. They insisted that the cinema of the future be the cinema of fact: newsreels recording the real world, \"life caught unawares.\" Vertov proclaimed the primacy of camera (\"Kino-Eye\") over the human eye. The camera lens was a machine that could be perfected infinitely to grasp the world in its entirety and organize visual chaos into a coherent, objective picture. At the same time Vertov emphasized that his Kino-Eye principle was a method of \"communist\" deciphering of the world. Vertov considered Marxism the only objective and scientific tool of analysis and even called a series of the 23 newsreels he directed between 1922 and 1925 Kino-Pravda, \"pravda\" being not only the Russian word for the truth but also the title of the official party newspaper.\n\nThe most acclaimed work is undoubtedly the seminal city symphony, \"Man with a Movie Camera\" (1929).\n"}

In 1953, he graduated from State University of New York at Fredonia. At Teachers College, Columbia University he was awarded a master's degree in 1955 and an Ed.D (Doctor of Education) degree in 1958. In 1959, he began teaching at New York University (NYU).\n\nIn 1971, at NYU's Steinhardt School of Education, he founded a graduate program in media ecology. He became the School of Education's only University Professor in 1993, and was chairman of the Department of Culture and Communication until 2002.\n\nHe died of lung cancer in Flushing, Queens, on October 5, 2003.\n\nPostman wrote 20 books and more than 200 magazine and newspaper articles for such periodicals as \"The New York Times Magazine\", \"The Atlantic Monthly\", \"Harper's Magazine\", \"Time\", \"Saturday Review\", \"Harvard Educational Review\", \"The Washington Post\", \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Stern\", and \"Le Monde\". He was the editor of the quarterly journal \"ETC: A Review of General Semantics\" from 1976 to 1986. He was also a contributing editor at \"The Nation\". Despite his oft-quoted concerns about television, computers and the role of technology in society, Postman used not only books, but also the medium of television to advance his ideas. He sat for many television interviews and, later in life, even had cable television in his home. In 1976, Postman taught a course for NYU credit on CBS-TV's \"Sunrise Semester\" called \"Communication: the Invisible Environment\".\n\nIn 1969 and 1970 Postman collaborated with New Rochelle educator Alan Shapiro on the development of a model school based on the principles expressed in \"Teaching as a Subversive Activity\". The result was the \"Program for Inquiry, Involvement, and Independent Study\" within New Rochelle High School. This \"open school\" experiment survived for 15 years, and in subsequent years many programs following these principles were developed in American high schools, current survivors include Walter Koral's Language class at the Village School in Great Neck, New York.\n\nIn a television interview conducted in 1995 on the \"MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour\", Postman spoke about his opposition to the use of personal computers in schools. He felt that school was a place to learn together as a cohesive group and that it should not be used for individualized learning. Postman also worried that the personal computer was going to take away from individuals socializing as citizens and human beings.\n\nOne of Postman's most influential works is \"Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business\". In \"Amusing\", Postman argued that by expressing ideas through visual imagery, television reduces politics, news, history, and other serious topics to entertainment. He worried that culture would decline if the people became an audience and their public business a \"vaudeville act.\" Postman also argued that television is destroying the \"serious and rational public conversation\" that was sustained for centuries by the printing press.\n\nIn his 1992 book \"Technopoly: the Surrender of Culture to Technology\", Postman defines \"Technopoly\" as a society which believes \"the primary, if not the only, goal of human labor and thought is efficiency, that technical calculation is in all respects superior to human judgment ... and that the affairs of citizens are best guided and conducted by experts.\"\n\nIn an interview, Postman described \"Technopoly\" as being about the tendency of technology to be given cultural control of sovereign American social institutions.\n\nPostman argues that the United States is the only country to have developed into a technopoly. He claims that the U.S. has been inundated with technophiles who do not see the downside of technology. This is dangerous because technophiles want more technology and thus more information. However, according to Postman, it is impossible for a technological innovation to have only a one-sided effect. With the ever-increasing amount of information available, Postman argues that: \"Information has become a form of garbage, not only incapable of answering the most fundamental human questions but barely useful in providing coherent direction to the solution of even mundane problems.\"\n\nPostman was not opposed to all forms of technology. In page 7 of \"Technopoly\", he agrees that technological advancements, specifically \"the telephone, ocean liners, and the reign of hygiene,\" have lengthened and improved modern life. In his words, this agreement proves that he is not a \"one-eyed technophobe.\"\n\nIn \"Technopoly\", Postman discusses Luddism, explaining that being a Luddite often is associated with a naive opposition to technology. But, according to Postman, historical Luddites were trying to preserve their way of life and rights given to them prior to the advancement of new technologies. \n\n\n"}

The Tintookies, from an Aboriginal word meaning 'little people who come from the sandhills', was an elaborate marionette musical first staged by creator Peter Scriven at the Elizabethan Theatre in Sydney in 1956. After the success of this production, Tintookie became the generic name for any of the puppets used by the Marionette Theatre of Australia, formed by Scriven under the auspices of the Elizabethan Theatre Trust in 1965. The board was chaired by Sir Howard Beale, president of the Arts Council, and included Dr H.C. Coombs, Dorothy Helmrich and Scriven, who was also artistic director. Apart from commissioning and presenting original Australian puppet works, the Marionette Theatre of Australia was to establish a training school, encourage the development of other groups, and import overseas companies.\n\nThe Marionette Theatre of Australia produced innovative large-scale puppet shows with an overtly Australian content for children for more than 20 years, including the landmark productions \"LittleFella Bindi\" (1958) and Norman Lindsay's \"The Magic Pudding\" (1960). \"Bindi\", the Aboriginal boy lead in \"LittleFella Bindi\" was manipulated by Scriven. He was supported by a team of five young puppeteers supervised by Igor Hyczka, a stage manager, a sound technician and a tour manager, Tony Gould (later to head the Queensland Performing Arts Centre). Later productions included \"The Explorers\" (telling the story of Australian explorers, Burke and Wills) and \"The Water Babies\". A film version of \"The Explorers\" was produced in 1968 by Scriven for Film World Pty. Ltd.\n\nScriven was highly dedicated even as a boy to marionettes. According to his teacher, William Dalziel Nicol, Scriven was one of the first students examined in puppetry after a course conducted by the Education Department in 1943 in Victoria, Australia.\n\nScriven was a remarkable entrepreneur and used his own funds to establish his marionette company. His legacy lives on the marionettes of the Marionette Theatre Company which a central part of the archives of the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney.\nAfter a spell in Singapore and Malaysia, Scriven returned to Sydney in 1973 as puppetry\nconsultant to the Australia Council for the Arts. In late 1974 Scriven put together a new version of \"The Tintookies\". Utilising around 100 near life-size marionettes, this was the biggest puppet production ever undertaken in Australia. It premiered at the Princess Theatre in Melbourne on 8 January 1975 and toured Asia in early 1976.\n\nScriven's next home was Sri Lanka. He commissioned local puppeteers to make the marionettes for \"The Tintookie Man\", a small-scale show that he presented on an independent tour of Australian schools in 1976-7. When he left to live in the Philippines, the show was continued by Graeme Mathieson, an accomplished puppeteer with whom Scriven had worked at the MTA.\n\nIn 1974 Richard Bradshaw succeeded Scriven as artistic director of the Marionette Theatre of Australia. It became an autonomous body in 1979 and from 1983 had its own theatre in the Rocks. It closed in 1988 due to losing federal government funding.\n\nPeter Scriven's services to theatre were acknowledged with an MBE in 1970. He spent his last years living in increasingly reduced circumstances in Manila, finally subsisting on just $5 a day. He worked on a play and an autobiography, but neither has been published. In 1998, diagnosed with a brain tumour, Scriven returned to Australia. He had been here just three weeks when, on 13 October 1998, he was found dead in a boarding house in Fortitude Valley, Brisbane. The man whose artistry had entertained countless thousands of Australian youngsters and had inspired a new generation of professional puppeteers had just $1.50 in his pocket. He was survived by many of his Tintookie marionettes, which now live in the archives of the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney.\n\nScriven's enthusiasm and expertise had legitimised Australian puppetry, transforming it from a children's party distraction into a major performing art form that attracts wide audiences and government funding and is taught in performing arts schools.\n\n\n"}

The primary function of a scene shop is to fabricate and assemble the flats, platforms, scenery wagons, and other scenic (set) pieces required for a performance. Commonly, a scene shop is also the location where most of the set painting is done, and is sometimes used to make props. Generally, the individuals who work in a scene shop are carpenters, although, in bigger shops, it is common for metalworkers to be employed for steel-construction set pieces which require welding and other machining. It is common for the individuals working in a scene shop to be knowledgeable in a wide variety of technical skills, developed over time as required for specific construction needs.\n\nCommercial scene shops can also be found in larger metropolitan areas, where they are capable of supplying scenic elements to a variety of clients, including theatre, film, television, and corporate productions. Scenic studios also sometimes make elements for museum booths, touring concerts, and other custom fabrication tasks.\n\nAlthough many scene shops are located in general purpose building, most are in purpose built spaces because scenic fabrication has some fairly specific needs. Often they are in very large, open rooms, to accommodate big elements that a show may call for. They are usually attached directly to a loading dock for delivery of materials and shipping of finished elements. If they are attached to a performance venue, it is also common to have large doors providing access to the stage. Typically, compressed air and dust collection systems are distributed around the shop. Many processes in a scene shop such as spray painting, welding, or hot-wire foam cutting produce dangerous gasses, so often extra ventilation is installed. Ideally, fume collection systems are available to use near the actual workpiece. Power is usually available in floor pockets or dropped from the ceiling, in a variety of voltages, as some tools, especially welders require high voltages. Often, scene shops have designated areas inside for paints, carpentry, metalwork, and sometimes prop construction.\n\n"}
{"id": "2417230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2417230", "title": "Sound recording and reproduction", "text": "Sound recording and reproduction\n\nSound recording and reproduction is an electrical, mechanical, electronic, or digital inscription and re-creation of sound waves, such as spoken voice, singing, instrumental music, or sound effects. The two main classes of sound recording technology are analog recording and digital recording. \n\nAcoustic analog recording is achieved by a microphone diaphragm that senses changes in atmospheric pressure caused by acoustic sound waves and records them as a mechanical representation of the sound waves on a medium such as a phonograph record (in which a stylus cuts grooves on a record). In magnetic tape recording, the sound waves vibrate the microphone diaphragm and are converted into a varying electric current, which is then converted to a varying magnetic field by an electromagnet, which makes a representation of the sound as magnetized areas on a plastic tape with a magnetic coating on it. Analog sound reproduction is the reverse process, with a bigger loudspeaker diaphragm causing changes to atmospheric pressure to form acoustic sound waves.\n\nDigital recording and reproduction converts the analog sound signal picked up by the microphone to a digital form by the process of sampling. This lets the audio data be stored and transmitted by a wider variety of media. Digital recording stores audio as a series of binary numbers (zeros and ones) representing samples of the amplitude of the audio signal at equal time intervals, at a sample rate high enough to convey all sounds capable of being heard. A digital audio signal must be reconverted to analog form during playback before it is amplified and connected to a loudspeaker to produce sound.\n\nPrior to the development of sound recording, there were mechanical systems, such as wind-up music boxes and, later, player pianos, for encoding and reproducing instrumental music.\n\nLong before sound was first recorded, music was recorded—first by written music notation, then also by mechanical devices (e.g., wind-up music boxes, in which a mechanism turns a spindle, which plucks metal tines, thus reproducing a melody). Automatic music reproduction traces back as far as the 9th century, when the Banū Mūsā brothers invented the earliest known mechanical musical instrument, in this case, a hydropowered (water-powered) organ that played interchangeable cylinders. According to Charles B. Fowler, this \"...cylinder with raised pins on the surface remained the basic device to produce and reproduce music mechanically until the second half of the nineteenth century.\" The Banū Mūsā brothers also invented an automatic flute player, which appears to have been the first programmable machine.\n\nIn the 14th century, a mechanical bell-ringer controlled by a rotating cylinder was introduced in Flanders. Similar designs appeared in barrel organs (15th century), musical clocks (1598), barrel pianos (1805), and music boxes (ca. 1800). A music box is an automatic musical instrument that produces sounds by the use of a set of pins placed on a revolving cylinder or disc so as to pluck the tuned teeth (or \"lamellae\") of a steel comb.\n\nThe fairground organ, developed in 1892, used a system of accordion-folded punched cardboard books. The player piano, first demonstrated in 1876, used a punched paper scroll that could store a long piece of music. The most sophisticated of the piano rolls were hand-played, meaning that the roll represented the actual performance of an individual, not just a transcription of the sheet music. This technology to record a live performance onto a piano roll was not developed until 1904. Piano rolls were in continuous mass production from 1896 to 2008. A 1908 U.S. Supreme Court copyright case noted that, in 1902 alone, there were between 70,000 and 75,000 player pianos manufactured, and between 1,000,000 and 1,500,000 piano rolls produced.\n\nThe first device that could record actual sounds as they passed through the air (but could not play them back—the purpose was only visual study) was the phonautograph, patented in 1857 by Parisian inventor Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville. The earliest known recordings of the human voice are phonautograph recordings, called \"phonautograms\", made in 1857. They consist of sheets of paper with sound-wave-modulated white lines created by a vibrating stylus that cut through a coating of soot as the paper was passed under it. An 1860 phonautogram of Au Clair de la Lune, a French folk song, was played back as sound for the first time in 2008 by scanning it and using software to convert the undulating line, which graphically encoded the sound, into a corresponding digital audio file.\n\nOn April 30, 1877, French poet, humorous writer and inventor Charles Cros submitted a sealed envelope containing a letter to the Academy of Sciences in Paris fully explaining his proposed method, called the paleophone. Though no trace of a working paleophone was ever found, Cros is remembered as the earliest inventor of a sound recording and reproduction machine.\n\nThe first practical sound recording and reproduction device was the mechanical phonograph cylinder, invented by Thomas Edison in 1877 and patented in 1878. The invention soon spread across the globe and over the next two decades the commercial recording, distribution, and sale of sound recordings became a growing new international industry, with the most popular titles selling millions of units by the early 1900s. The development of mass-production techniques enabled cylinder recordings to become a major new consumer item in industrial countries and the cylinder was the main consumer format from the late 1880s until around 1910.\n\nThe next major technical development was the invention of the gramophone record, generally credited to Emile Berliner and commercially introduced in the United States in 1889, though others had demonstrated similar disk apparatus earlier, most notably Alexander Graham Bell in 1881. Discs were easier to manufacture, transport and store, and they had the additional benefit of being louder (marginally) than cylinders, which by necessity, were single-sided. Sales of the gramophone record overtook the cylinder ca. 1910, and by the end of World War I the disc had become the dominant commercial recording format. Edison, who was the main producer of cylinders, created the Edison Disc Record in an attempt to regain his market. In various permutations, the audio disc format became the primary medium for consumer sound recordings until the end of the 20th century, and the double-sided 78 rpm shellac disc was the standard consumer music format from the early 1910s to the late 1950s.\n\nAlthough there was no universally accepted speed, and various companies offered discs that played at several different speeds, the major recording companies eventually settled on a \"de facto\" industry standard of nominally 78 revolutions per minute, though the actual speed differed between America and the rest of the world. The specified speed was 78.26 rpm in America and 77.92 rpm throughout the rest of the world. The difference in speeds was due to the difference in the cycle frequencies of the AC electricity that powered the stroboscopes used to calibrate recording lathes and turntables. The nominal speed of the disc format gave rise to its common nickname, the \"seventy-eight\" (though not until other speeds had become available). Discs were made of shellac or similar brittle plastic-like materials, played with needles made from a variety of materials including mild steel, thorn, and even sapphire. Discs had a distinctly limited playing life that varied depending on how they were produced.\n\nEarlier, purely acoustic methods of recording had limited sensitivity and frequency range. Mid-frequency range notes could be recorded, but very low and very high frequencies could not. Instruments such as the violin were difficult to transfer to disc. One technique to deal with this involved using a Stroh violin to which was fitted a conical horn connected to a diaphragm that vibrated due to the violin bridge. The horn was no longer needed once electrical recording was developed.\n\nThe long-playing 33 rpm microgroove vinyl record, or \"LP\", was developed at Columbia Records and introduced in 1948. The short-playing but convenient 7-inch 45 rpm microgroove vinyl single was introduced by RCA Victor in 1949. In the US and most developed countries, the two new vinyl formats completely replaced 78 rpm shellac discs by the end of the 1950s, but in some corners of the world, the \"78\" lingered on far into the 1960s. Vinyl was much more expensive than shellac, one of the several factors that made its use for 78 rpm records very unusual, but with a long-playing disc the added cost was acceptable and the compact \"45\" format required very little material. Vinyl offered improved performance, both in stamping and in playback. If played with a good diamond stylus mounted in a lightweight pickup on a well-adjusted tonearm, it was long-lasting. If protected from dust, scuffs and scratches there was very little noise. Vinyl records were, over-optimistically, advertised as \"unbreakable\". They were not, but they were much less fragile than shellac, which had itself once been touted as \"unbreakable\" compared to wax cylinders.\n\nBetween the invention of the phonograph in 1877 and the first commercial digital recordings in the early 1970s, arguably the most important milestone in the history of sound recording was the introduction of what was then called \"electrical recording\", in which a microphone was used to convert the sound into an electrical signal that was amplified and used to actuate the recording stylus. This innovation eliminated the \"horn sound\" resonances characteristic of the acoustical process, produced clearer and more full-bodied recordings by greatly extending the useful range of audio frequencies, and allowed previously unrecordable distant and feeble sounds to be captured.\n\nSound recording began as a purely mechanical process. Except for a few crude telephone-based recording devices with no means of amplification, such as the Telegraphone, it remained so until the 1920s when several radio-related developments in electronics converged to revolutionize the recording process. These included improved microphones and auxiliary devices such as electronic filters, all dependent on electronic amplification to be of practical use in recording. In 1906, Lee De Forest invented the Audion triode vacuum tube, an electronic valve that could amplify weak electrical signals. By 1915, it was in use in long-distance telephone circuits that made conversations between New York and San Francisco practical. Refined versions of this tube were the basis of all electronic sound systems until the commercial introduction of the first transistor-based audio devices in the mid-1950s.\n\nDuring World War I, engineers in the United States and Great Britain worked on ways to record and reproduce, among other things, the sound of a German U-boat for training purposes. Acoustical recording methods of the time could not reproduce the sounds accurately. The earliest results were not promising.\n\nThe first electrical recording issued to the public, with little fanfare, was of November 11, 1920 funeral services for The Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey, London. The recording engineers used microphones of the type used in contemporary telephones. Four were discreetly set up in the abbey and wired to recording equipment in a vehicle outside. Although electronic amplification was used, the audio was weak and unclear. The procedure did, however, produce a recording that would otherwise not have been possible in those circumstances. For several years, this little-noted disc remained the only issued electrical recording.\n\nSeveral record companies and independent inventors, notably Orlando Marsh, experimented with equipment and techniques for electrical recording in the early 1920s. Marsh's electrically recorded Autograph Records were already being sold to the public in 1924, a year before the first such offerings from the major record companies, but their overall sound quality was too low to demonstrate any obvious advantage over traditional acoustical methods. Marsh's microphone technique was idiosyncratic and his work had little if any impact on the systems being developed by others.\n\nTelephone industry giant Western Electric had research laboratories (merged with the AT&T engineering department in 1925 to form Bell Telephone Laboratories) with material and human resources that no record company or independent inventor could match. They had the best microphone, a condenser type developed there in 1916 and greatly improved in 1922, and the best amplifiers and test equipment. They had already patented an electromechanical recorder in 1918, and in the early 1920s, they decided to intensively apply their hardware and expertise to developing two state-of-the-art systems for electronically recording and reproducing sound: one that employed conventional discs and another that recorded optically on motion picture film. Their engineers pioneered the use of mechanical analogs of electrical circuits and developed a superior \"rubber line\" recorder for cutting the groove into the wax master in the disc recording system.\n\nBy 1924, such dramatic progress had been made that Western Electric arranged a demonstration for the two leading record companies, the Victor Talking Machine Company and the Columbia Phonograph Company. Both soon licensed the system and both made their earliest published electrical recordings in February 1925, but neither actually released them until several months later. To avoid making their existing catalogs instantly obsolete, the two long-time archrivals agreed privately not to publicize the new process until November 1925, by which time enough electrically recorded repertory would be available to meet the anticipated demand. During the next few years, the lesser record companies licensed or developed other electrical recording systems. By 1929 only the budget label Harmony was still issuing new recordings made by the old acoustical process.\n\nComparison of some surviving Western Electric test recordings with early commercial releases indicates that the record companies \"dumbed down\" the frequency range of the system so the recordings would not overwhelm non-electronic playback equipment, which reproduced very low frequencies as an unpleasant rattle and rapidly wore out discs with strongly recorded high frequencies.\n\nIn the 1920s, Phonofilm and other early motion picture sound systems employed optical recording technology, in which the audio signal was graphically recorded on photographic film. The amplitude variations comprising the signal were used to modulate a light source which was imaged onto the moving film through a narrow slit, allowing the signal to be photographed as variations in the density or width of a \"sound track\". The projector used a steady light and a photoelectric cell to convert these variations back into an electrical signal, which was amplified and sent to loudspeakers behind the screen. Ironically, the introduction of \"talkies\" was spearheaded by \"The Jazz Singer\" (1927), which used the Vitaphone sound-on-disc system rather than an optical soundtrack. Optical sound became the standard motion picture audio system throughout the world and remains so for theatrical release prints despite attempts in the 1950s to substitute magnetic soundtracks. Currently, all release prints on 35 mm film include an analog optical soundtrack, usually stereo with Dolby SR noise reduction. In addition, an optically recorded digital soundtrack in Dolby Digital and/or Sony SDDS form is likely to be present. An optically recorded timecode is also commonly included to synchronise CDROMs that contain a DTS soundtrack.\n\nThis period also saw several other historic developments including the introduction of the first practical magnetic sound recording system, the magnetic wire recorder, which was based on the work of Danish inventor Valdemar Poulsen. Magnetic wire recorders were effective, but the sound quality was poor, so between the wars, they were primarily used for voice recording and marketed as business dictating machines. In 1924, a German engineer, Dr. Kurt Stille, developed the Poulsen wire recorder as a dictating machine. The following year, Ludwig Blattner began work that eventually produced the Blattnerphone, enhancing it to use steel tape instead of wire. The BBC started using Blattnerphones in 1930 to record radio programmes. In 1933, radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi's company purchased the rights to the Blattnerphone, and newly developed Marconi-Stille recorders were installed in the BBC's Maida Vale Studios in March 1935. The tape used in Blattnerphones and Marconi-Stille recorders was the same material used to make razor blades, and not surprisingly the fearsome Marconi-Stille recorders were considered so dangerous that technicians had to operate them from another room for safety. Because of the high recording speeds required, they used enormous reels about one metre in diameter, and the thin tape frequently broke, sending jagged lengths of razor steel flying around the studio. The K1 Magnetophon was the first practical tape recorder, developed by AEG in Germany in 1935.\n\nAn important field of invention during this period was the tape recorder. Magnetic tape recording uses an amplified electrical audio signal to generate analogous variations of the magnetic field produced by a tape head, which impresses corresponding variations of magnetization on the moving tape. In playback mode, the signal path is reversed, the tape head acting as a miniature electric generator as the varyingly magnetized tape passes over it. The original solid steel ribbon was replaced by a much more practical coated paper tape, but acetate soon replaced paper as the standard tape base. Acetate has fairly low tensile strength and if very thin it will snap easily, so it was in turn eventually superseded by polyester. This technology, the basis for almost all commercial recording from the 1950s to the 1980s, was developed in the 1930s by German audio engineers who also rediscovered the principle of AC biasing (first used in the 1920s for wire recorders), which dramatically improved the frequency response of tape recordings. The technology was further improved just after World War II by American audio engineer John T. Mullin with backing from Bing Crosby Enterprises. Mullin's pioneering recorders were modifications of captured German recorders. In the late 1940s, the Ampex company produced the first tape recorders commercially available in the US.\n\nMagnetic tape brought about sweeping changes in both radio and the recording industry. Sound could be recorded, erased and re-recorded on the same tape many times, sounds could be duplicated from tape to tape with only minor loss of quality, and recordings could now be very precisely edited by physically cutting the tape and rejoining it.\nWithin a few years of the introduction of the first commercial tape recorder—the Ampex 200 model, launched in 1948—American musician-inventor Les Paul had invented the first multitrack tape recorder, ushering in another technical revolution in the recording industry. Tape made possible the first sound recordings totally created by electronic means, opening the way for the bold sonic experiments of the Musique Concrète school and avant garde composers like Karlheinz Stockhausen, which in turn led to the innovative pop music recordings of artists such as Frank Zappa, The Beatles, and The Beach Boys.\n\nThe ease and accuracy of tape editing, as compared to the cumbersome disc-to-disc editing procedures previously in some limited use, together with tape's consistently high audio quality finally convinced radio networks to routinely prerecord their entertainment programming, most of which had formerly been broadcast live. Also, for the first time, broadcasters, regulators and other interested parties were able to undertake comprehensive audio logging of each day's radio broadcasts. Innovations like multitracking and tape echo allowed radio programs and advertisements to be produced to a high level of complexity and sophistication. The combined impact with innovations such as the endless loop broadcast cartridge led to significant changes in the pacing and production style of radio program content and advertising.\n\nIn 1881, it was noted during experiments in transmitting sound from the Paris Opera that it was possible to follow the movement of singers on the stage if earpieces connected to different microphones were held to the two ears. This discovery was commercialized in 1890 with the Théâtrophone system, which operated for over forty years until 1932. In 1931, Alan Blumlein, a British electronics engineer working for EMI, designed a way to make the sound of an actor in a film follow his movement across the screen. In December 1931, he submitted a patent including the idea, and in 1933 this became UK patent number 394,325. Over the next two years, Blumlein developed stereo microphones and a stereo disc-cutting head, and recorded a number of short films with stereo soundtracks.\n\nIn the 1930s, experiments with magnetic tape enabled the development of the first practical commercial sound systems that could record and reproduce high-fidelity stereophonic sound. The experiments with stereo during the 1930s and 1940s were hampered by problems with synchronization. A major breakthrough in practical stereo sound was made by Bell Laboratories, who in 1937 demonstrated a practical system of two-channel stereo, using dual optical sound tracks on film. Major movie studios quickly developed three-track and four-track sound systems, and the first stereo sound recording for a commercial film was made by Judy Garland for the MGM movie \"Listen, Darling\" in 1938. The first commercially released movie with a stereo soundtrack was Walt Disney's \"Fantasia\", released in 1940. The 1941 release of Fantasia used the \"Fantasound\" sound system. This system used a separate film for the sound, synchronized with the film carrying the picture. The sound film had four double-width optical soundtracks, three for left, center, and right audio—and a fourth as a \"control\" track with three recorded tones that controlled the playback volume of the three audio channels. Because of the complex equipment this system required, Disney exhibited the movie as a roadshow, and only in the United States. Regular releases of the movie used standard mono optical 35 mm stock until 1956, when Disney released the film with a stereo soundtrack that used the \"Cinemascope\" four-track magnetic sound system.\n\nGerman audio engineers working on magnetic tape developed stereo recording by 1941, even though a 2-track push-pull monaural technique existed in 1939. Of 250 stereophonic recordings made during WW2, only three survive: Beethoven's 5th Piano Concerto with Walter Gieseking and Arthur Rother, a Brahms Serenade, and the last movement of Bruckner's 8th Symphony with Von Karajan. The Audio Engineering Society has issued all these recordings on CD. (Varèse Sarabande had released the Beethoven Concerto on LP, and it has been reissued on CD several times since). Other early German stereophonic tapes are believed to have been destroyed in bombings. Not until Ampex introduced the first commercial two-track tape recorders in the late 1940s did stereo tape recording become commercially feasible. However, despite the availability of multitrack tape, stereo did not become the standard system for commercial music recording for some years, and remained a specialist market during the 1950s. EMI (UK) was the first company to release commercial stereophonic tapes. They issued their first \"Stereosonic\" tape in 1954. Others quickly followed, under the His Master's Voice and Columbia labels. 161 Stereosonic tapes were released, mostly classical music or lyric recordings. RCA imported these tapes into the USA.\n\nTwo-track stereophonic tapes were more successful in America during the second half of the 1950s. They were duplicated at real time (1:1) or at twice the normal speed (2:1) when later 4-track tapes were often duplicated at up to 16 times the normal speed, providing a lower sound quality in many cases. Early American 2-track stereophonic tapes were very expensive. A typical example is the price list of the Sonotape/Westminster reels: $6.95, $11.95 and $17.95 for the 7000, 9000 and 8000 series respectively. Some HMV tapes released in the USA also cost up to $15. The history of stereo recording changed after the late 1957 introduction of the \"Westrex stereo phonograph disc\", which used the groove format developed earlier by Blumlein. Decca Records in England came out with FFRR (Full Frequency Range Recording) in the 1940s, which became internationally accepted as a worldwide standard for higher quality recording on vinyl records. The Ernest Ansermet recording of Igor Stravinsky's Petrushka was key in the development of full frequency range records and alerting the listening public to high fidelity in 1946.\n\nRecord companies mixed most popular music singles into monophonic sound until the mid-1960s—then commonly released major recordings in both mono and stereo until the early 1970s. Many 1960s pop albums available only in stereo in the 2000s were originally released only in mono, and record companies produced the \"stereo\" versions of these albums by simply separating the two tracks of the master tape, creating \"pseudo stereo\". In the mid Sixties, as stereo became more popular, many mono recordings (such as The Beach Boys' \"Pet Sounds\") were remastered using the so-called \"fake stereo\" method, which spread the sound across the stereo field by directing higher-frequency sound into one channel and lower-frequency sounds into the other.\n\nMagnetic tape transformed the recording industry. By the early 1950s, most commercial recordings were mastered on tape instead of recorded directly to disc. Tape facilitated a degree of manipulation in the recording process that was impractical with mixes and multiple generations of directly recorded discs. An early example is Les Paul's 1951 recording of \"How High the Moon\", on which Paul played eight overdubbed guitar tracks. In the 1960s Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys, Frank Zappa, and The Beatles (with producer George Martin) were among the first popular artists to explore the possibilities of multitrack recording techniques and effects on their landmark albums \"Pet Sounds\", \"Freak Out!\", and \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\".\n\nThe next important innovation was small cartridge-based tape systems, of which the compact cassette, commercialized by the Philips electronics company in 1964, is the best known. Initially a low-fidelity format for spoken-word voice recording and inadequate for music reproduction, after a series of improvements it entirely replaced the competing formats: the larger 8-track tape (used primarily in cars) and the fairly similar \"Deutsche Cassette\" developed by the German company Grundig. This latter system was not particularly common in Europe and practically unheard-of in America. The compact cassette became a major consumer audio format and advances in electronic and mechanical miniaturization led to the development of the Sony Walkman, a pocket-sized cassette player introduced in 1979. The Walkman was the first personal music player and it gave a major boost to sales of prerecorded cassettes, which became the first widely successful release format that used a re-recordable medium: the vinyl record was a playback-only medium and commercially prerecorded tapes for reel-to-reel tape decks, which many consumers found difficult to operate, were never more than an uncommon niche market item.\n\nA key advance in audio fidelity came with the Dolby A noise reduction system, invented by Ray Dolby and introduced into professional recording studios in 1966. It suppressed the light but sometimes quite noticeable steady background of hiss, which was the only easily audible downside of mastering on tape instead of recording directly to disc. A competing system, dbx, invented by David Blackmer, also found success in professional audio. A simpler variant of Dolby's noise reduction system, known as Dolby B, greatly improved the sound of cassette tape recordings by reducing the especially high level of hiss that resulted from the cassette's miniaturized tape format. It, and variants, also eventually found wide application in the recording and film industries. Dolby B was crucial to the popularization and commercial success of the cassette as a domestic recording and playback medium, and it became a standard feature in the booming home and car stereo market of the 1970s and beyond. The compact cassette format also benefited enormously from improvements to the tape itself as coatings with wider frequency responses and lower inherent noise were developed, often based on cobalt and chrome oxides as the magnetic material instead of the more usual iron oxide.\n\nThe multitrack audio cartridge had been in wide use in the radio industry, from the late 1950s to the 1980s, but in the 1960s the pre-recorded 8-track cartridge was launched as a consumer audio format by Bill Lear of the Lear Jet aircraft company (and although its correct name was the 'Lear Jet Cartridge', it was seldom referred to as such). Aimed particularly at the automotive market, they were the first practical, affordable car hi-fi systems, and could produce sound quality superior to that of the compact cassette. However the smaller size and greater durability — augmented by the ability to create home-recorded music \"compilations\" since 8-track recorders were rare — saw the cassette become the dominant consumer format for portable audio devices in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThere had been experiments with multi-channel sound for many years — usually for special musical or cultural events — but the first commercial application of the concept came in the early 1970s with the introduction of Quadraphonic sound. This spin-off development from multitrack recording used four tracks (instead of the two used in stereo) and four speakers to create a 360-degree audio field around the listener. Following the release of the first consumer 4-channel hi-fi systems, a number of popular albums were released in one of the competing four-channel formats; among the best known are Mike Oldfield's \"Tubular Bells\" and Pink Floyd's \"The Dark Side of the Moon\". Quadraphonic sound was not a commercial success, partly because of competing and somewhat incompatible four-channel sound systems (e.g., CBS, JVC, Dynaco and others all had systems) and generally poor quality, even when played as intended on the correct equipment, of the released music. It eventually faded out in the late 1970s, although this early venture paved the way for the eventual introduction of domestic Surround Sound systems in home theatre use, which have gained enormous popularity since the introduction of the DVD. This widespread adoption has occurred despite the confusion introduced by the multitude of available surround sound standards.\n\nThe replacement of the relatively fragile thermionic valve (vacuum tube) by the smaller, lighter-weight, cooler-running, less expensive, more robust, and less power-hungry transistor also accelerated the sale of consumer high-fidelity \"hi-fi\" sound systems from the 1960s onward. In the 1950s, most record players were monophonic and had relatively low sound quality. Few consumers could afford high-quality stereophonic sound systems. In the 1960s, American manufacturers introduced a new generation of \"modular\" hi-fi components — separate turntables, pre-amplifiers, amplifiers, both combined as integrated amplifiers, tape recorders, and other ancillary equipment like the graphic equaliser, which could be connected together to create a complete home sound system. These developments were rapidly taken up by major Japanese electronics companies, which soon flooded the world market with relatively affordable, high-quality transistorized audio components. By the 1980s, corporations like Sony had become world leaders in the music recording and playback industry.\n\nThe advent of digital sound recording and later the compact disc (CD) in 1982 brought significant improvements in the durability of consumer recordings. The CD initiated another massive wave of change in the consumer music industry, with vinyl records effectively relegated to a small niche market by the mid-1990s. However, the record industry fiercely resisted the introduction of digital systems, fearing wholesale piracy on a medium able to produce perfect copies of original released recordings. However, the industry succumbed to the inevitable, though using various protection system (principally Serial Copy Management System, or SCMS).\nThe most recent and revolutionary developments have been in digital recording, with the development of various uncompressed and compressed digital audio file formats, processors capable and fast enough to convert the digital data to sound in real time, and inexpensive mass storage\n. This generated new types of portable digital audio players. The minidisc player, using ATRAC compression on small, cheap, re-writeable discs was introduced in the 1990s but became obsolescent as solid-state non-volatile flash memory dropped in price. As technologies that increase the amount of data that can be stored on a single medium, such as Super Audio CD, DVD-A, Blu-ray Disc, and HD DVD become available, longer programs of higher quality fit onto a single disc. Sound files are readily downloaded from the Internet and other sources, and copied onto computers and digital audio players. Digital audio technology is now used in all areas of audio, from casual use of music files of moderate quality to the most demanding professional applications. New applications such as internet radio and podcasting have appeared.\n\nTechnological developments in recording, editing, and consuming have transformed the record, movie and television industries in recent decades. Audio editing became practicable with the invention of magnetic tape recording, but digital audio and cheap mass storage allows computers to edit audio files quickly, easily, and cheaply. Today, the process of making a recording is separated into tracking, mixing and mastering. Multitrack recording makes it possible to capture signals from several microphones, or from different takes to tape, disc or mass storage, with maximized headroom and quality, allowing previously unavailable flexibility in the mixing and mastering stages.\n\nThere are many different digital audio recording and processing programs running under several computer operating systems for all purposes, ranging from casual users (e.g., a small business person recording her \"to-do\" list on an inexpensive digital recorder) to serious amateurs (an unsigned \"indie\" band recording their demo on a laptop) to professional sound engineers who are recording albums, film scores and doing sound design for video games. A comprehensive list of digital recording applications is available at the digital audio workstation article. Digital dictation software for recording and transcribing speech has different requirements; intelligibility and flexible playback facilities are priorities, while a wide frequency range and high audio quality are not.\n\nThe development of analog sound recording in the nineteenth century and its widespread use throughout the twentieth century had a huge impact on the development of music. Before analog sound recording was invented, most music was listened to by hearing a live performance, or by singing or playing a song or piece. Throughout the medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, and through much of the Romantic music era, the main way that songs and instrumental pieces were \"recorded\" was by notating the piece in music notation. While music notation indicates the pitches of the melody and their rhythm, the notation is not like a 2010-era sound recording. Indeed, in the Medieval era, Gregorian chant did not indicate the rhythm of the chant. In the Baroque era, instrumental pieces often lack a tempo indication and usually none of the ornaments were written down. As a result, each performance of a song or piece would be slightly different. \n\nWith the development of analog sound recording, though, a performance could be permanently fixed, in all of its elements: pitch, rhythm, timbre, ornaments and expression. This meant that many more elements of a performance would be captured and disseminated to other listeners. The development of sound recording also enabled a much larger proportion of people to hear famous orchestras, operas, singers and bands, because even if a non-wealthy person could not afford to hear the live concert, she or he might be able to afford to buy the recording. The availability of sound recording thus helped to spread musical styles to new regions, countries and continents. The cultural influence went in a number of directions. Sound recordings enabled Western music lovers to hear actual recordings of Asian, Middle Eastern and African groups and performers, increasing awareness of non-Western musical styles. At the same time, sound recordings enabled non-Western music lovers to hear the most famous North American and European groups and singers.\n\nIn copyright law, a \"phonogram\" or \"sound recording\" is a work that results from the fixation of sounds in a medium. The notice of copyright in a phonogram uses the sound recording copyright symbol, which the Geneva Phonograms Convention defines as ℗ (the letter P in a full circle). This usually accompanies the copyright notice for the underlying musical composition, which uses the ordinary © symbol.\n\nUnited States copyright law defines \"sound recordings\" as \"works that result from the fixation of a series of musical, spoken, or other sounds\" other than an audiovisual work's soundtrack. Prior to the Sound Recording Amendment (SRA), which took effect in 1972, copyright in sound recordings was handled at the level of the several states. Federal copyright law preempts most state copyright laws but allows state copyright in sound recordings to continue for one full copyright term after the SRA's effective date, which means 2067.\n\nSince 1934, copyright law in Great Britain has treated sound recordings (or \"phonograms\") differently from musical works. \"Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988\" defines a sound recording as (a) a recording of sounds, from which the sounds may be reproduced, or (b) a recording of the whole or any part of a literary, dramatic or musical work, from which sounds reproducing the work or part may be produced, regardless of the medium on which the recording is made or the method by which the sounds are reproduced or produced. It thus covers vinyl records, tapes, compact discs, digital audiotapes, and MP3s that embody recordings.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18993753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18993753", "title": "The Force", "text": "The Force\n\nThe Force is a metaphysical and ubiquitous power in the \"Star Wars\" fictional universe. It is wielded by characters throughout the franchise: heroes like the Jedi use the \"light side\" of the Force, while the Sith and other villains exploit the \"dark side\". The Force has been compared to aspects of several world religions, and the phrase \"May the Force be with you\" has become part of the popular culture vernacular.\n\nGeorge Lucas created the concept of the Force to address character and plot developments in \"Star Wars\" (1977). He also wanted to \"awaken a certain kind of spirituality\" in young audiences, suggesting a belief in God without endorsing any specific religion. He developed the Force as a nondenominational religious concept, \"distill[ed from] the essence of all religions\", premised on the existence of God and distinct ideas of good and evil. Lucas said that there is a conscious choice between good and bad, and \"the world works better if you're on the good side\". In 1970s San Francisco, where Lucas lived when he wrote the drafts that became \"Star Wars\", New Age ideas that incorporated the concept of \"qi\" and other notions of a mystical life-force were \"in the air\" and widely embraced.\n\nLucas used the term \"the Force\" to \"echo\" its use by cinematographer Roman Kroitor in \"21-87\" (1963), in which Kroitor says, \"Many people feel that in the contemplation of nature and in communication with other living things, they become aware of some kind of force, or something, behind this apparent mask which we see in front of us, and they call it God\". Although Lucas had Kroitor's line in mind specifically, Lucas said the underlying sentiment is universal and that \"similar phrases have been used extensively by many different people for the last 13,000 years\".\n\nThe first draft of \"Star Wars\" makes two references to \"the Force of Others\" and does not explain the concept: King Kayos utters the blessing \"May the Force of Others be with you all\", and he later says \"I feel the Force also\". The power of the Force of Others is kept secret by the Jedi Bendu of the Ashla, an \"aristocratic cult\" in the second draft. The second draft offers a lengthy explanation of the Force of Others and introduces its Ashla light side and Bogan dark side. The Ashla and Bogan are mentioned 10 and 31 times, respectively, and the Force of Others plays a more prominent role in the story. In this draft, Luke Starkiller's mission is to retrieve the Kiber Crystal, which can intensify either the Ashla or Bogan powers. The film's shorter third draft has no references to the Ashla, but it mentions the Bogan eight times and Luke is still driven to recover the Kiber Crystal.\n\nLucas finished the fourth and near-final draft on January 1, 1976. This version trims \"the Force of Others\" to \"the Force\", makes a single reference to the Force's seductive \"dark side\", distills an explanation of the Force to 28 words, and eliminates the Kiber Crystal. Producer Gary Kurtz, who studied comparative religion in college, had long discussions with Lucas about religion and philosophy throughout the writing process. Kurtz told Lucas he was unhappy with drafts in which the Force was connected with the Kiber Crystal, and he was also dissatisfied with the early Ashla and Bogan concepts.\nLucas and screenwriter Leigh Brackett decided that the Force and the Emperor would be the main concerns in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980). The focus on the Emperor was later shifted to the third film, \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983), and the dark side of the Force was treated as \"The Empire Strikes Back\"s main villain.\n\n\"\" (1999) introduces \"midi-chlorians\", microscopic creatures that connect characters to the Force, although Lucas had conceived the idea as early as August 1977. Lucas based the concept on symbiogenesis, calling midi-chlorians a \"loose depiction\" of mitochondria. He further said:\n\nLucas' story treatments for a potential sequel trilogy involved \"a microbiotic world\" and creatures known as the Whills, beings that \"control the universe\" and \"feed off the Force.\" He elaborated that individuals function as \"vehicles for the Whills to travel around in\", and that midi-chlorians \"communicate with the Whills [who] in a general sense... are the Force.” After selling Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012, Lucas said his biggest concern about the franchise's future was the Force being \"muddled into a bunch of gobbledegook\".\n\nWhen writing \"\" (2015) with Lawrence Kasdan, J. J. Abrams respected that Lucas had established midi-chlorians' effect on some characters' ability to use the Force. As a child, though, he interpreted Obi-Wan Kenobi's explanation of the Force in \"Star Wars\" to mean that any character could use its power, and that the Force was more grounded in spirituality than science. Abrams retained the idea of the Force having a light and a dark side, and some characters' seduction by the dark side helps create conflict for the story. Pablo Hidalgo of the Lucasfilm Story Group gave his \"blessing\" to writer-director Rian Johnson to introduce a new Force power in \"\" (2017) \"if the story required it and if it felt like it stretches into new territory but doesn’t break the idea of what the Force can do\". Johnson observed that every \"Star Wars\" movie introduces new Force powers to meet that film's story needs.\n\n\"Star Wars Rebels\" producer Dave Filoni cites several influences on how the Force is used in the show. The character Bendu — named in homage to the term Lucas originally associated with the Jedi — does not align with the franchise's normal dark-or-light duality, and this role is an extension of Filoni's conversations with Lucas about the nature of the Force. Filoni credits the prequel films for better developing the concept of the Force, particularly the idea of a balance between the light and dark sides.\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi describes the Force as \"an energy field created by all living things\" in \"Star Wars\". In \"The Phantom Menace\", Qui-Gon Jinn says microscopic lifeforms called midi-chlorians, which exist inside all living cells, allow some characters to be Force-sensitive; characters must have a high enough midi-chlorian count to feel and use the Force.\n\nIn 1981, Lucas compared using the Force to yoga, saying any character can use its power. Dave Filoni said in 2015 that all \"Star Wars\" characters are \"Force intuitive\": some characters, like Luke Skywalker, are aware of their connection to the Force, while characters such as Han Solo draw upon the Force unconsciously. Filoni said the most potent Force users are characters with a natural affinity for using the Force, as indicated by their midi-chlorian count, who undertake intense training and discipline. \"Rogue One\" (2016) portrays the Force more as a religion \"than simply a way to manipulate objects and people\". In the years following the Great Jedi Purge depicted in the prequel trilogy, some characters have lost faith in the Force, and the Galactic Empire hunts down surviving Jedi and other Force-sensitive characters. By the time of the events in \"The Force Awakens\", some characters think the Jedi and the Force are myths.\n\nSome Force-sensitive characters can derive special, psychic abilities from it, such as telekinesis, mind control, and extrasensory perception. The Force is sometimes referred to in terms of \"dark\" and \"light\" sides, with villains like the Sith drawing on the dark side to act aggressively while the Jedi use the light side for defense and peace. According to Filoni, Lucas believed a character's intentions when using the Force — their \"willingness or will to be selfless or selfish\" — is what distinguishes light and dark sides. The Force is also used by characters who are neither Jedi nor Sith, such as Leia Organa and Kylo Ren. Characters throughout the franchise use their Force powers in myriad ways, including Obi-Wan using a \"mind trick\" to undermine a stormtrooper's will, Darth Vader choking subordinates without touching them, Luke Skywalker having a vision of the future, and Kylo Ren stopping blaster fire mid-air. The Force allows \"ghosts\" of some deceased characters to interact with the living, and Obi-Wan's ghost provides Luke Skywalker with guidance at \"critical moments\" in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi\". Film and television use of the Force is sometimes accompanied by a sound effect, such as a \"deep rumble\" associated with the dark side or a more high-pitched sound associated with benevolent use.\n\nThe Force plays an important role in several \"Star Wars\" plot lines. Anakin Skywalker's rise as a light-side Jedi, descent into becoming the Sith Lord Darth Vader, and ultimate redemption to the light side of the Force is the main story arc for the first six \"Star Wars\" films. Yoda's arc in the final season of \"\" (2008–2014) depicts him exploring \"bigger questions\" about the Force and taking various inspirations from the franchise's expanded universe. In \"The Force Awakens\", Finn's exposure to the Force helps make him question his upbringing. writer Rian Johnson used the Force to allow Rey and Kylo Ren to communicate in \"The Last Jedi\", developing the characters' relationship.\n\nChris Taylor called the Force \"largely a mystery\" in \"Star Wars\". Taylor ascribes the \"more poetic, more spiritual ... and more demonstrative\" descriptions of the Force in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" to Lawrence Kasdan, who co-wrote the film, but says the film does little to expand audiences' understanding of it. In 1997, Lucas said that the more detail he articulated about the Force and how it works, the more it took away from its core meaning. \"Kotaku\" suggests Johnson depicted more nuance in the Force in \"The Last Jedi\" than Lucas did in his films. According to Rob Weinert-Kendt, the \"Force theme\" in John Williams' score represents the power and responsibility of wielding the Force.\n\nIn his 1977 review of \"Star Wars\", Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" called the Force \"a mixture of what appears to be ESP and early Christian faith\". \"The Magic of Myth\" compares the sharp distinction between the good \"light side\" and evil \"dark side\" of the Force to Zoroastrianism, which posits that \"good and evil, like light and darkness, are contrary realities\". The connectedness between the light and dark sides has been compared to the relationship between yin and yang in Taoism, although the balance between yin and yang lacks the element of evil associated with the dark side. Taylor identifies other similarities between the Force and a Navajo prayer, prana, and qi. It is a common plot device in \"jidaigeki\" films like \"The Hidden Fortress\" (1958), which inspired \"Star Wars\", for samurai who master qi to achieve astonishing feats of swordsmanship. Taylor added that the lack of detail about the Force makes it \"a religion for the secular age\". According to Jennifer Porter, professor of religious studies at the Memorial University of Newfoundland, \"the Force is a metaphor for godhood that resonates and inspires within [people] a deeper commitment to the godhood identified within their traditional faith\".\n\nParanormal abilities like the Force are a common device in science fiction, and the Force has been compared to the role magic plays in the fantasy genre. The \"Star Wars\" films illustrate that characters not familiar with the particulars of the Force associate it with mysticism and magic, such as when an Imperial officer alludes to Darth Vader's \"sorcerer's ways\". Christina Flotmann distinguishes between the depiction of the Force in the \"Star Wars\" franchise and the depiction of magic in the \"Harry Potter\" fantasy series, and she describes the Force as a spiritual energy.\n\nEric Charles points out that the television films \"\" (1984) and \"\" (1985), intended for children, are \"fairy tales in a science fiction setting\". These films feature magic and other fairy tale motifs rather than the Force and science fiction tropes. Mark Clark said the \"Ewok Adventure\" films depict \"sorcery\" that is completely different from the Force powers depicted in the original and prequel \"Star Wars\" films. \"The A.V. Club\" said \"The Last Jedi\" depicts the Force \"closer to the sorcery of fairy tales and medieval romance than it’s ever been\".\n\nAstrophysicist Jeanne Cavelos says in \"The Science of Star Wars\" that the Force raises questions that scientists have long asked. She points out that the ancient Greeks explored the idea of a \"fifth element\" that permeated and connected everything in the universe, and that Isaac Newton proposed that the human brain might be able to trigger waves in the ether, giving humans psychic powers. Cavelos's sources are mostly skeptical about a \"real world\" explanation for the Force, but they explore ideas in areas such as quantum physics, parapsychology, and the notion of science so advanced that it appears magical. Explaining the Force is particularly difficult, Cavelos says, because \"it does so many different things\". Several scientists have said it is best not to try to explain how the Force works.\n\nCavelos says the Force \"suggests a universe quite different than the one we think we're living in\", and that some unknown fields or particles might explain the Force. Cavelos believes vacuum energy is one option to power physical Force feats, and she says a fifth force beyond the four fundamental interactions might account for the Force. Flavio Fenton of the Georgia Institute of Technology School of Physics suggests a fifth force would carry two types of charge — one for the light side and one for the dark — and that each would be carried by its own particle. Nepomuk Otte, also from Georgia Tech, cautions that Newton's third law of motion says telekinesis would apply a force back on the Force-wielding character. Force powers like precognition are challenging to explain because of the implied time travel of information, but Cavelos suggests tachyons traveling faster than light might carry such information. Cavelos explores the possibility of brain implants or sensors being used to detect users' intent and manipulate energy fields to control the Force. Michio Kaku says Luke Skywalker's Jedi training on Dagobah might involve learning to control brain waves, and Cavelos compares such discipline to contemporary patients learning to control prosthetics.\n\n\"National Geographic\" compared the Higgs boson's role as \"carrier\" of the Higgs field to the way Jedi are \"carriers\" of the Force. A previsualization video highlighting the idea of \"kicking someone's ass with the Force\" steered LucasArts game designers toward producing \"\" (2008), which sold six million copies as of July 2009. In 2009, Uncle Milton Toys released a Force Trainer that used electroencephalography to read users' beta waves.\n\n\"The New Republic\", Townhall, \"The Atlantic\", and others have compared various political machinations to the \"Jedi mind trick\", a Force power used to undermine opponents' perceptions and willpower.\n\nPractitioners of Jediism pray to and express gratitude to the Force. \"io9\" described a kind message to a fan from Mark Hamill, who portrays Luke Skywalker, as an example of the light side of the Force.\n\nJohn Simon wrote in his 1977 review of \"Star Wars\" for \"New York\" magazine:\nCritic Tim Robley compared the Force to the ruby slippers from \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939), with both being entities that send the protagonist on a quest. In her 1980 \"Washington Post\" review of \"The Empire Strikes Back\", Judith Martin described the Force as \"a mishmash of current cultic fashions without any base in ideas. It doesn't seem to be connected with ethics or a code of decent behavior, either.\"\n\nThe introduction of midi-chlorians in \"The Phantom Menace\" was controversial, with Evan Narcisse of \"Time\" writing that the concept ruined \"Star Wars\" for him and a generation of fans because \"the mechanisms of the Force became less spiritual and more scientific\". Film historian Daniel Dinello argued, \"Anathema to \"Star Wars\" fanatics who thought they reduced the Force to a kind of viral infection, midi-chlorians provide a biological interface, the link between physical bodies and spiritual energy.\" Referring to \"midi-chlorians\" became a screenwriting shorthand for over-explaining a concept. Although Chris Taylor suggested fans want less detail, not more, in explaining the Force, the introduction of midi-chlorians provided depth to the franchise and fomented engagement among fans and franchise writers. Religion expert John D. Caputo writes, \"In the 'Gospel according to Lucas' a world is conjured up in which the intractable oppositions that have tormented religious thinkers for centuries are reconciled ... The gifts that the Jedi masters enjoy have a perfectly plausible scientific basis, even if its ways are mysterious\".\n\nCharacters' faith in the Force reinforces the \"Rogue One\"s message of hope. \"The A.V. Club\" said Rian Johnson's depiction of the Force in \"The Last Jedi\" goes \"beyond George Lucas’ original transcendental concept\". \"Polygon\" said Johnson's film \"democratize[s] the Force\", depicting Force sensitivity in characters from outside a \"Force-sensitive lineage\" and suggesting that the Force can be used by anyone.\n\nSeveral \"Star Wars\" characters say \"May the Force be with you\" (or derivatives of it) and the expression has become a popular catchphrase. In 2005, \"May the Force be with you\" was chosen as number 8 on the American Film Institute's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes list. May 4 is Star Wars Day, taken from the pun \"May the Fourth be with you\". The expression was intentionally similar to the Christian \"dominus vobiscum\", \"the Lord be with you\".\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan in 1985 said \"the Force is with us\", referring to the United States, to create the Strategic Defense Initiative to protect against Soviet ballistic missiles. Some weeks earlier, Reagan had compared the Soviets to the Galactic Empire. \"The Gospel According to Star Wars\" asserts that Reagan's invocation of the Force\n\n\n"}
