He has the ability to perform three primary actions: roll, jump, and boost. The game is designed around the concept of an obstacle course, so the player is constantly being presented to various new puzzles, mechanics and challenges.\n\nGameplay has been likened to other games such as the \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" series, Super Mario Galaxy, and the \"Super Monkey Ball\" series. Players primarily progress through levels by rolling Armillo and have the option to utilize the tilt controls of the Wii U's GamePad to do so. Armillo is aided in his quest through special abilities and power-ups such as a size boost and the Critter gun which fires the non-playable Critters at Armillo's enemies.\n\nWhile the majority of the game takes place in a 3D world, there are unlockable 2D bonus stages in every single non-boss level. Purchasable upgrades, obtained using blue orbs collected in levels, also enable optional backtracking of previously completed levels.\n\nArmillo was developed by Fuzzy Wuzzy Games for the Wii U, and is distributed on the Nintendo eShop. The game will be a timed exclusive on the platform, as it is scheduled to be released on other platforms in the future. The decision was made in honor of Nintendo's recent support for independent developers.\n\n\"Armillo\" received mixed to positive reviews since its release.

It is the first production of the filmmaker María José Cuevas. The film shows a glimpse of the glory, sunset and resurgence of five of the main showgirls (vedettes) that triumphed in Mexico in the decades of the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThey were the \"Queens of the Night\" in late-night Mexico in the 1970s and 1980s. The names of the great \"Vedettes\" illuminated the streets of Mexico City from the awnings of the great nightclubs, cabarets and theaters of the capital. But time passed. Nightlife changed in Mexico. New types of entertainment replaced them and the big \"vedettes\" seemed to have been forgotten.\n\nToday, more than thirty years of its splendor in the nightlife of Mexico, \"Beauties of the Night\" explores the lives of five of the main vedettes of the golden years: Olga Breeskin, Lyn May, Rossy Mendoza, Wanda Seux and Princesa Yamal. The film shows the viewer a deeper facet of the current life of these five vedettes. Women who, despite the years and having taken their life to the extreme, are full of life and with an enviable physical condition. Not only have they managed to reinvent themselves and survive in the entertainment world, but also in life itself. Between laughter and tears, the film reflects the passage of years, emotions and personal challenges for the lives of each of these women\n\n\nThe title of the documentary evokes the film \"Bellas de noche\", the first film of the so-called Cine de ficheras, which dates back to 1975.\n\nThe idea of Cuevas to pay homage to these women arises from her childhood. Cuevas, daughter of the prestigious Mexican artist José Luis Cuevas, had contact with several of these women, who were friends of her father. Years later, Cuevas had a meeting with Princesa Yamal, who performed an Arab dance in front of her, giving her the idea of producing this documentary, whose realization lasted for a decade. The film delivers an exercise in which the contrasts of time come to light and unveils what lies behind the stardom. You can appreciate an honest, dynamic and effective exercise in which remains the curiosity to know more details. Although the documentary came from the idea of paying homage to these women, the relationship between them and the filmmaker María José Cuevas, became so close that they became a family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a prequel to \"Billa\" (2007) and focuses on how David, an ordinary man from the coastal regions of South Tamil Nadu, becomes Billa, a dreaded underworld don, with Ajith Kumar reprising the role of the titular character. Parvathy Omanakuttan, Bruna Abdullah, Vidyut Jammwal and Sudhanshu Pandey appear in supporting roles, all of them marking their debut in Tamil cinema. The film's soundtrack and background score were composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja, while R. D. Rajasekhar handled the cinematography and Suresh Urs worked as the editor.\n\nThe film, produced by Wide Angle Creations in association with the Hinduja Group company IN Entertainment, was officially announced in November 2010, with Vishnuvardhan as the director. Due to schedule clashes, Vishnuvardhan was replaced by Chakri Toleti, with a new script having been penned by a team involving Toleti, Sarath Mandava and Eric Felberg.\n\nPrincipal photography happened between July 2011 and December 2011. The filming primarily took place at Tamil Nadu, Goa, Hyderabad and in Georgia. \"Billa II\" was released worldwide on 13 July 2012 and a dubbed Telugu version titled \"David Billa\" was also simultaneously released in Andhra Pradesh. The film received above average to positive reviews and did a decent business at box office.\n\nDavid Billa (Ajith Kumar), a Sri Lankan Tamil refugee along with several others, arrives at the town of Rameswaram in boat. After being interrogated by an arrogant civil servant, he is let into the refugee camp where he befriends Ranjith (Yog Japee). Billa makes his presence felt, when he slaps Muthu (Theepatti Ganesh), one of the rogue workers around, for making a derogatory comment. The refugee camp is constantly terrorised by corrupt police officer Raghubir Sinha (Krishna Kumar). After witnessing the brutal murder of one of the inmates at his hands, Billa attacks Raghubir when he tries to forcefully detain one of his friends. Raghubir then gets Billa tortured in prison and vows to make him suffer. A few days later, Muthu calls Billa and Ranjith aside and promises them work. Billa and Ranjith are hired to transport fish from Rameswaram to Chennai. But unknown to them, the truck they were driving had diamonds inside, and Raghubir had alerted his men on the highway to catch them red-handed. As per the plot, they get caught in the check post, and after realising what had happened, Billa kills all the cops and drive the truck to its destination. Here they meet Selvaraj (Ilavarasu), who is pleased by Billa's loyalty and includes him in his businesses. Billa gets back and murders Raghubir and the civil servant. He then goes to meet his elder sister (Janaki Sabesh) and niece Jasmine (Parvathy Omanakuttan) in a church. When they see his gun, they realise he is involved in crime. Not knowing what to say, Billa simply walks away.\n\nKotiswara Rao (Manoj K. Jayan) visits Selvaraj and asks him if he could help in selling off the heroin he had brought along with him. Billa volunteers to sell it off on a 5% commission in exchange. He sets off and delivers the heroin to a local thug who refuses to pay for it in return. In a brutal scuffle that ensues where one of Billa's friends is slaughtered, Billa takes out the thug and his men and returns with the money and heroin. Soon, Billa meets Koti's boss Abbasi (Sudhanshu Pandey), who is very impressed by the former and recruits him. After a party held at his club, he receives a phone call from the Russian mafia led by Dimitri (Vidyut Jamwal), telling him that his arms consignment has been held by the Indian coastal guards and he asks for his help. Billa and Ranjith retrieve the consignment for him and are congratulated by Dimitri for their work.\n\nSoon, Billa learns his sister died and brings Jasmine with him to live in a big villa in Goa. Jasmine displays her feelings for him, but Billa does not reciprocate and is instead more concerned at her education and safety. Billa and Koti travel to Russia to meet Dimitri, who happens to own an arms and ammunition manufacturing unit with Koti, where he signs a deal with Dimitri without Abbasi's knowledge in presence of Jagdish (Rahman), a corrupt Interpol officer helping these underworld criminals. Abbasi learns of this from Koti, and is furious at Billa's daring and disobedient behaviour. Tensions further increase when Billa beats up Satish Kumar (Rohit Khurana), the son of an influential minister Praveen Kumar (Dinesh Lamba), when he tries to misbehave with Jasmine in a party. Abbasi expresses his discontent and vents at him. Billa, surprised and enraged at his ingratitude, walks away with Ranjith. Billa, Ranjith, and Ram (Sarath Mandava) plot to venture into the drug business on their own during the carnival. At the carnival, Billa is betrayed by Ram and is brutally attacked. However, he survives, finishes off the assailants, kills Abbasi and Ram, and becomes the most powerful crime lord, extending his business without any boundaries. He also ropes in Abbasi's girlfriend Sameera (Bruna Abdullah), much to Jasmine's displeasure.\n\nDimitri arrives into the scene and tries to negotiate a deal with Billa. But Billa refuses for his low payment, and angered by his defiance and rebellion, Dimitri seeks to oust him. Dimitri seeks out the help of Koti, Satish, and Praveen to eliminate David. They proceed to kill Chief Minister Mohan Kanth (Madhusudhan Rao), and the blame falls upon Billa. However, Billa is freed, and Koti kidnaps Jasmine, who is found in a field, tied up and her mouth gagged with duct tape. Billa rescues her and informs Sameera to come to a church to take Jasmine away to Malaysia for safety. But Sameera conspires against them and the goons, with the minister's son, arrive at the church and hold Billa and Jasmine captives. Billa, stabbed, is held to the ground and is mocked at by Satish, who slits Jasmine's throat. Unable to witness her death, Billa overpowers everyone and kills all the goons. This is the scene at which the film initially starts.\n\nMeanwhile, in Russia, Dimitri is having an auction of his weapons, and Koti is present with him. He shows his factory in his computer via a series of webcams and much to everyone's shock, Billa is seen destroying his factory in Georgia. He also sees his delivery train go off course. Angered with fear, he kills Koti for not killing Billa, and he sets out himself to finish the task. The arms factory is destroyed by Billa and his friends. Dimitri arrives and follows his delivery train, when to his shock, the delivery train is blown by Billa, who would be waiting for him on his own helicopter. After an intense battle, Billa kills Dimitri.\nIn the concluding scene, Billa and Ranjith boards a plane, and the former's goons (Sameera, Police and Lawyer) are eliminated by Billa.\n\nIn 2008, reports claimed that Soundarya Rajinikanth was planning to make a follow-up after noting \"Billa\"s commercial success, to be produced by Ocher Studios in association with Warner Bros. However, the sequel did not materialise and the idea was dropped, with Ajith Kumar, Vishnuvardhan and Soundarya getting busy with other projects.\n\nIn 2010, sources confirmed that Vishnuvardhan had finished penning the script for a prequel, which would star Ajith Kumar as the titular character again, and would commence in 2011. The project became officially announced in late 2010, after Ajith Kumar signed up to the prequel and first production poster were published to the media. Further details were disclosed, with Suresh Balaje, son of producer and actor K. Balaji, who produced the original \"Billa\" with Rajinikanth, and George Pius from Wide Angle Creations banner, being confirmed as the producer, who would associate with Mumbai-based IN Entertainment Limited, a Hinduja group company. The entire production team of the \"Billa\" remake, including cinematographer Nirav Shah, editor A. Sreekar Prasad and music director Yuvan Shankar Raja, were announced to be retained for the sequel.\n\nIn a turn of events, Vishnuvardhan opted out of the project citing that his dates clashed with the making of his Telugu film, \"Panjaa\" (earlier titled as \"The Shadow\"). Chakri Toleti who directed the 2009 Kamal Haasan-Mohanlal starrer \"Unnaipol Oruvan\" was subsequently signed on by the producers to direct the venture. In May 2011, Chakri Toleti held his first press conference stating that production would begin in late June 2011 and revealing that \"\"Billa 2\" would focus on how David, an ordinary man from the coastal Thoothukudi in South Tamil Nadu, becomes Billa, a dreaded underworld don\". David's character was afterwards widely reported to be either a refugee from Tamil Eelam or a Tamilian from Sri Lanka. Both the director and the producer refused to confirm the statements, disclosing only that the film would depict David's journey over a period of five years.\n\nWith Vishnuvardhan's exit from the project, his script was also scrapped, and Toleti along with Ajith Kumar began penning a new script for the prequel. Yuvan Shankar Raja only was retained from the original production team, with the rest of the technical crew being finalised in the following weeks. Hemant Chaturvedi, who hitherto had worked in Bollywood productions only, was signed on to replace Nirav Shah as the cinematographer after the latter's schedules clashed with the making of his other film, \"Vettai\". However, in July 2011, Hemant Chaturvedi too moved out of the project, fearing that the delay in commencement of \"Billa 2\" may hurt his chances in Bollywood, and R. D. Rajasekhar was appointed as the new cinematographer. V. Selvakumar who had notably worked in \"Madrasapattinam\" was selected as the art director. The crew also announced that the film would become the first Indian production to be filmed with an RED EPIC Camera, being shot at 5K resolution. Writer Ee. Raa. Murugan, who had previously collaborated with Chakri Toleti in the Kamal Hassan-starrer \"Unnaipol Oruvan\", was appointed to write the dialogue.\n\nFrom the previous film, the producers made it clear that apart from Ajith Kumar, and Rahman, most of the other characters would not be retained. The female lead role was expected to be handed to Anushka Shetty, but despite media speculation she was not signed on. The female lead role was handed to debutant Huma Qureshi, a Mumbai-based theatre actor who had previously been featured in commercials, with Toleti finalising Qureshi after a nationwide search for an actress. However, she was removed from the project by September 2011, due to date clashes, and became replaced by Miss India World 2008 Parvathy Omanakuttan later that month, who the director had spotted and offered the role of Jasmine at a fashion show. Parvathy described her character as a \"simple girl who transforms into a modern person\" and that Billa looks up to, adding that she was had more scenes in the \"emotional part\" of the film. Bollywood actress and model Bruna Abdullah was selected to portray another significant character, which she went on term as \"super powerful, very strong and sexy\". Besides models Abdullah, and Parvathy Omanakuttan, Meenakshi Dixit was recruited for the item number \"Madurai Ponnu\". Another three models including, Gabriela Bertante, Nicole Amy Madell, and an unknown artist, was recruited to perform a dance number \"Yedho Mayakkam\".\n\nTelevision actor Krishna Kumar, was signed on to play a \"dirty cop\". In June 2011, Sudhanshu Pandey, a former model who has appeared in several Hindi films, was given the role of a \"greying ganglord\", who becomes the mentor to the young David, whilst Malayalam character actor Manoj K. Jayan was roped in for a \"key role\". Actress Vimala Raman was signed on to make a special appearance in the film, however she opted out in July 2011 citing date problems. Meenakshi Dixit was later finalised for that role and shot her scenes in July 2011 during the first schedule. Vidyut Jamwal, who played negative roles in the Hindi film \"Force\" (2011) and the Telugu film \"Oosaravelli\" (2011), was selected to play the villain, also making his debut in Tamil cinema. In December 2011 sources revealed that Sricharan, who starred in \"Payanam\", was shooting for a supporting role in the film. Reports in February 2012 suggested that the team was trying to sign Nayantara, who played the female lead in \"Billa\", for a cameo role; the actress refuted the rumours. Furthermore, composer Yuvan Shankar Raja on Toleti's insistence agreed to make a brief appearance in one of the songs. Sources also reported that director Seeman would be acting in the film.\n\nThe film's production was delayed as Ajith Kumar's previous film, \"Mankatha\", progressed beyond the anticipated completion dates. In March 2011, the producers released a press note that the film would begin in early May 2011, however this failed to happen. During that period, it was also suggested that \"Billa II\" may not be Ajith Kumar's successive project and commence only after the actor completed a film with M. Raja. Eventually, a photo shoot was held in June 2011 with Ajith sporting an appearance of a man in his mid-twenties. Principal photography commenced on 14 July 2011 at the Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad. Filming during the first 30-day schedule throughout July and August 2011 was held in Hyderabad and Vizag. As part of the schedule, one song was shot in Puducherry under the direction of choreographer Raju Sundaram. Both actresses Parvathy Omanakuttan and Bruna Abdullah joined the crew for the second schedule in Goa, that lasted for 39 days and ended in the first week of November.\n\nIn the third week of November, a unit of thirty-six members left for Georgia in Eastern Europe for the final 20-day schedule of the film. In Georgia, the crew filmed at the country's capital, Tbilisi, Borjomi and Rustavi. \"Billa II\" became the first Indian film to be shot at the Likani Palace, which functions as a summer residence of the President of Georgia. Midway through the filming, heavy snowfall began. The crew, however, carried on shooting and later reshot the complete sequence with the snowy background to maintain the continuity. The climax portions were also filmed there against a snowy backdrop, for which aerial shots were done from a helicopter. Approximately half a million dollars were spent for the whole schedule in Georgia, which was finished by mid-December. In February 2012, the remaining scenes, including the film's title song, were canned at the Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad, despite the ongoing strike in the film industry. An item number \"Yedo Mayakkam\" featuring three models was shot in a studio in Goa. Although producer Kheterpal had named Bangkok, Thailand as a potential location for filming, shooting was not held there. The entire filming was completed over a period of 90 days.\n\nThree stunt choreographers were involved in the making of \"Billa II\". The stunt sequences in Georgia were partly choreographed by an award-winning German-based company led by stuntman Stefan Richter, while the climax action scenes were done by Kecha Khamphakdee's Jaika Stunt team. K. Rajasekhar choreographed the fight sequences in Hyderabad and Goa. Madhu Sudhanan, a VFX creative director, said that VFX had been used in action sequences, in \"set extensions\" and in sequences involving 3D.\n\nYuvan Shankar Raja, who had also worked on the score of \"Billa\" (2007), composed the soundtrack and score of \"Billa II\", becoming his fifth project starring Ajith Kumar. The album consists of six tracks, five songs and a theme music track. The producer however confirmed that the film would feature a sixth song, not included in the soundtrack that was composed for a belly dance sequence. Na. Muthukumar agreed to write the lyrics for the songs. In a departure from convention, the lyrics were penned first which were set to tunes later.\n\nThe audio launch was initially to be released in mid-March 2012, but was then pushed to second week of April. Actor Rajinikanth was approached to unveil the soundtrack, with the team supposedly rescheduling the audio launch to suit Rajinikanth's dates, who had left for London for the filming of his film \"Kochadaiyaan\". The soundtrack was unveiled on 1 May 2012, coinciding with Ajith Kumar's birthday. Sony Music Entertainment that marketed the album of Ajith Kumar's previous film \"Mankatha\", acquired the music rights of \"Billa II\" as well for an unprecedented sum after some weeks-long negotiations. In the week before the audio launch, Sony Music began releasing teasers of each of the songs every day and promoted them across social platforms. The Telugu version of the soundtrack was released on 5 June 2012 at the Taj Deccan in Hyderabad. The soundtrack received positive response from critics and topped the charts.\n\n\"Billa II\" underwent an extensive marketing spree before its release. A first teaser poster displaying the new logo design was published in Diwali 2011, while the first posters depicting Ajith Kumar's look were released in January 2012 during the Pongal festival. From late February onwards, further posters featuring Ajith were unveiled, with one poster in late March portraying a young Ajith carrying a kerosene can on a boat that led to speculations over the character's origin. On 13 April 2012, a one-minute teaser trailer was uploaded to YouTube. The teaser garnered over 500,000 views within the first three days of its release, setting a new record for Tamil films.\n\nAs part of the marketing, the makers planned to release a \"Billa 2\" calendar featuring the two lead actresses, Parvathy Omanakuttan and Bruna Abdulla; the stills were shot exclusively for the calendar in Goa. An event to launch the official theatrical trailer was planned to be held on 2 July at the Anna Centenary Library auditorium in Kotturpuram, Chennai. The entire cast and crew along with Russian dancers were expected to attend the function, which was to be telecast on television later. The event was cancelled at short notice. The trailer was however uploaded to YouTube the same day, gaining record views. Moreover, a promotional video featuring Ajith with composer Yuvan Shankar Raja was shot as well, but was not released either.\n\nBilla 2 was released in 1110 theatres worldwide. On first day Mayajaal Multiplex released Billa 2 in all screens and all shows – a total of 55 shows in 14 screens. \nThe overseas distribution rights were sold for 53 million to the US-based company GK Media, the highest ever for an Ajith film. In March 2012, The Sun TV bought the satellite rights for a record price, with sources estimating the price at 6 million. Three prominent production houses were reportedly trying to purchase the domestical theatrical rights then. Venu Ravichandran's Aascar Films eventually acquired the theatrical distribution rights of Tamil Nadu for 260 million. All the distribution rights of the film, except the Kerala and Hindi dubbing rights had been sold at a record price of more than 400 million, making \"Billa II\" one of the top pre-release revenue generating films of all time in the Tamil film industry. In early May 2012, the Kerala release rights were finally sold to Sagara Entertainment and Money Tree Entertainment for 8million, likewise a new record for an Ajith film. \"Billa II\" received an adult rating (\"A\" certificate) from the Central Board of Film Certification, due to its \"high glamour quotient, violence and the mature content\". In the UK, the film was issued an 15 certificate by the British Board of Film Classification with an advice that it contained \"very strong violence and revenge theme\".\n\n\"Billa II\" was initially planned to release on 13 April 2012, coinciding with Tamil New Year, but the release was postponed to 1 May 2012, coinciding with Ajith Kumar's birthday, with the makers considering to bring forward the film by four days to release it on a Friday. However, the release became further delayed and was pushed to the second half of May 2012. After considering the first four Fridays in June 2012 for the film's release, the producer finally zeroed in on 13 July as the release date.\n\n\"Billa 2\" was released across over 1,400 screens worldwide, making it one of the largest Tamil releases ever. The film was released simultaneously in the four southern states, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala as well as in North India and international markets. In Tamil Nadu, it opened across 550 theatres, while a dubbed Telugu version of the film released in Andhra Pradesh as \"David Billa\". In Kerala, the Tamil version was screened and Karnataka saw the release of both the versions. The film was also released by Aanna Films in most of the major multiplexes in France with French subtitles; in Malaysia, North India and the Gulf Nations, Malay, Hindi and Arabic subtitles were added to the film, respectively, while in other international markets, it was screened with English subtitles.\n\nKarthik Subramanian of \"The Hindu\" said, \"Where the movie lacks in substance, it does try to score with technical aspects. The camerawork by R. D. Rajasekhar, background score by Yuvan Shankar Raja and editing by Suresh Urs are superlative for the most part\", and that the film \"does live up to the hype\". MSN India said \"\"Billa 2\" would be an interesting film for ajith fans&watchable film for general audience\"\n\nMeena Iyer of \"The Times of India\" recommended it with a 3 star rating, \"If you're a Ajith fan—\"Billa 2\" is a must. If you're an action aficionado, it's a treat. If you're neither, then don't bother.\" Indiaglitz called it as a slick entertainer running for just 129 minutes. Prathibha Parameswaran of IBN Live said, \"If you liked \"Billa\" and \"Mankatha\", and expected as much from the prequel, it falls well short of expectations.\" and further wrote, \"watch it only for Thala.\" Anupama Subramanian of Deccan Chronicle rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and said, \"The film works to a great extent because of the sheer screen presence of a star called Ajith Kumar. After all, it is his film all the way!\"\n\nIn the domestic market, \"Billa II\" had a great opening with 95% occupancy in single screens and multiplexes. The film raked in close to 40 crore worldwide in its opening three-day weekend. In the opening week, it grossed around 2.79 crore at the Chennai box office and after 5 weeks, it amounted to 7.79 crore after tax deduction. The movie was one of the top grosser in box office.\n\nIn Malaysia, \"Billa II\" collected USD$348,000 The film grossed $78,000 in the UK and approximately $20,000 in Australia.\n\n"}

She later graduated from California State University, Northridge with a Bachelor of Arts in business marketing and a Bachelor of Science in psychology. After graduating, she moved to North Hollywood, where she worked as a behavior therapist for autistic children. She is of African American and Korean descent.\n\nIn 2011, Andrew competed in a non-televised \"Diva Search\" with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Later that year, Andrew was one of fourteen contestants on the revival of \"Tough Enough\", where she was the first eliminated.\n\nImmediately after being eliminated from \"Tough Enough\", Andrew confirmed on her Twitter account that WWE had signed her to a contract. She was then assigned to WWE's then-developmental territory, Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), and made her debut on July 7, 2011, as a ring announcer at an FCW house show. On July 9, she made her in-ring debut, under the ring name Cameron Lynn, in a Divas battle royal, which consisted of Audrey Marie, Caylee Turner, Kaitlyn, Maxine, Raquel Diaz, Sonia, and Aksana, in which Lynn was eliminated first. On the October 9, 2011, episode of \"FCW TV\", she made her televised debut with Byron Saxton, accompanying Naomi Knight to ringside during her match against Leah West, which Knight won. On the October 23 episode of \"FCW TV\", Lynn teamed with Knight in a winning effort against Caylee Turner and Kaitlyn.\n\nOn the January 9, 2012 episode of \"Raw\", she (billed simply as Cameron) made her WWE main roster debut as one of the dancers and valets, along with Naomi, for the returning Brodus Clay. She made her WrestleMania debut at WrestleMania XXVIII alongside Naomi in a segment with Clay. On the pre-show on December 16, 2012, Cameron participated in her first televised match on the main roster, which was a \"Santa's Little Helpers\" battle royal which was won by her fellow Funkadactyl Naomi, who would go on to face Eve Torres later that night for the Divas Championship.\n\nOn the February 6, 2013 episode of \"Main Event\", The Funkadactyls got into a backstage altercation with Tamina Snuka and Aksana, after Snuka and Aksana began to persuade Brodus Clay to fire The Funkadactyls and hire them as his backup dancers instead. This led to Cameron and Naomi's first match as a team, in which they defeated Snuka and Aksana.\n\nOn the March 15 episode of \"SmackDown\", The Funkadactyls were attacked by the returning Bella Twins in a backstage segment. On the March 22 episode of \"SmackDown\" and March 25 episode of \"Raw\", The Funkadactyls attacked the twins after they interfered both times in Tons of Funk (Brodus Clay and Tensai)'s match against Team Rhodes Scholars (Cody Rhodes and Damien Sandow).<ref name=\"Raw3/25/13\"></ref> The four women eventually faced off in a tag team match on the March 27 episode of \"Main Event\", where the Bella Twins emerged victorious when Nikki Bella pinned Naomi after an interference by Rhodes.<ref name=\"MainEvent3/27/13\"></ref> Cameron and Naomi were set to team up with Brodus Clay and Tensai against Team Rhodes Scholars and the Bella Twins at WrestleMania 29 in an eight-person mixed tag team match, however the match was cancelled due to time restraints. The match instead took place the following night on \"Raw\", where Tons of Funk and The Funkadactyls emerged victorious.\nOn the August 26 episode of \"Raw\", Cameron and Naomi accompanied Natalya to an unsuccessful singles match against Brie Bella, until AJ Lee interrupted and ignited a feud on the cast of \"Total Divas\", criticizing them as undeserving. On the September 27 episode of \"Smackdown!\", Cameron was defeated by Lee in singles match. Cameron joined Team \"Total Divas\" in a 7-on-7 elimination tag-team match against Team \"True Divas\" (Alicia Fox, Aksana, AJ Lee, Kaitlyn, Rosa Mendes, Tamina Snuka, and Summer Rae) at the Survivor Series pay-per-view and the following night on \"Raw\" in a rematch; although Cameron was eliminated by Mendes in the former event and by Snuka in the latter, her team was ultimately victorious in both competitions. On December 15 at the pay-per-view, Cameron, along with fellow Funkadactyl Naomi and Tensai, abandoned Brodus Clay because of his attitude, effectively disbanding Tons of Funk. The following night on an episode of \"Raw\", Cameron and Naomi aligned themselves with R-Truth and Xavier Woods, and began accompanying them to their matches.\n\nIn January 2014, The Funkadactyls began feuding with AJ Lee and her bodyguard Tamina Snuka, when Naomi received a push and defeated Lee in various tag team matches on both \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\". However, their rivalry was cut shortly after Naomi suffered a legitimate eye injury during her match with Aksana on the February 3 episode of \"Raw\". On the February 10 episode of \"Raw\", Cameron pinned Aksana during a six-Diva tag team match, and on the February 19 episode of \"Main Event\", Cameron defeated her in a singles match. On February 23 at Elimination Chamber, Cameron received her first shot at the Divas Championship, a match which she won by disqualification after Tamina Snuka accidentally hit a superkick on AJ Lee. Cameron received a rematch on the February 28 episode of \"SmackDown\", which she would lose. At WrestleMania XXX, Cameron failed to capture the title in the \"Vickie Guerrero Divas Championship Invitational\" match, which was ultimately won by Lee.\n\nIn June 2014, after the Payback pay-per-view, Cameron started a brief feud with new Divas Champion Paige, in which Cameron would begin displaying signs of a villainous persona and would unsuccessfully challenge Paige in three non-title matches on \"Superstars\" and \"Raw\", all of which Paige would win. Paige then lost to a non-title match to Cameron's tag team partner Naomi, who would get a shot at the Divas Championship at Money in the Bank, after which The Funkadactyls began to fall out and had several disagreements during and after their matches.\nOn the July 7 episode of \"Raw\", Cameron and Naomi were defeated by AJ Lee and Paige after Cameron tagged herself in and was pinned by Paige. After the match, Cameron and Naomi began brawling in and out of the ring, and as a result, Cameron cemented her villainous turn and the team was disbanded. The following night on an episode of \"Main Event\", Cameron was scheduled to team with Naomi, Natalya, Eva Marie, Rosa Mendes, and Summer Rae against Nikki Bella in a six-on-one handicap match, but only showed up to attack Naomi and Nikki. Cameron competed in her first match as a villain on the July 15 episode of \"Main Event\" losing to Emma and attacked her after the match, only to be scared off by Naomi. This led to a match between the two on the Battleground pre–show, where Cameron defeated Naomi after grabbing her tights. Throughout the summer, Cameron continued her rivalry with Naomi and competed in various handicap, singles and tag team matches. In November, at Survivor Series, Cameron participated in a four-on-four elimination tag team match, where she was eliminated by Naomi before her team ultimately lost the match. In early 2015, Cameron competed in various singles matches losing to the likes of Summer Rae, Naomi and Paige. On the April 13 episode of \"Raw\", Cameron competed in a number one contender's battle royal for Nikki Bella's WWE Divas Championship, which would be won by Paige. After being the special guest referee for a match between Alicia Fox and Natalya, Cameron would attack both Divas on the April 9 episode of \"Smackdown\", which would lead to a triple threat match the following week, with Cameron coming out victorious. A few weeks later, on the April 30 episode of \"SmackDown\", Cameron confronted Nikki Bella during a backstage segment that led to a non–title match between the two, which Cameron lost.\n\nAfter taking a hiatus from WWE television, Cameron was moved to WWE NXT and made her return on the November 4 episode of \"NXT\", losing to Asuka. On the January 13, 2016, episode of \"NXT\", Cameron competed in a battle royal to determine the number one contender for Bayley's NXT Women's Championship, which was won by Carmella. On the February 10 episode of \"NXT\", Cameron faced Alexa Bliss in a losing effort.<ref name=\"NXT10/02/16\"></ref> After two months of inactivity, WWE announced on May 6 that Andrew had been released from her contract.\n\nAndrew played a main role for the reality television show \"Total Divas\" produced by WWE and E!, which began airing in July 2013. In May 2015, it was announced that Andrew would not be featured as a full-time cast member on the show for season 4, although she still appears as a guest star.\n\nCameron has appeared in four WWE video games. She made her in-game debut at \"WWE 13\" as an NPC along her then-tag team partner Naomi as \"The Funkadactyls\" appearing during Brodus Clay's entrance and winning celebration as well as in \"WWE 2K14\", she later made her playable character debut in \"WWE 2K15\" and was playable once again in \"WWE 2K16\".\n\nIn September 2015, Andrew launched an anti-bullying campaign called \"Wrong #\".\n\nAndrew competed on the MTV reality series \"The Challenge\" titled \"\".\n\nAndrew has previously lived in Tampa, Florida. Andrew was in a relationship with Vincent Isayan, and their relationship was featured on \"Total Divas\". On the May 24, 2016 episode of Stone Cold Steve Austin's podcast, Andrew revealed that she and Isayan had broken up.\nShe has a younger brother, Quentinn, and a younger sister, Aniyah. She has two degrees. She cites Maryse, Melina, and Alicia Fox as her inspirations.\n\nIn August 2012, Andrew was arrested for driving under the influence, and trying to bribe the arresting officer. Andrew was punished with a two-week suspension by WWE for the incident.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "35970102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35970102", "title": "Caption contest", "text": "Caption contest\n\nA caption contest or caption competition is a competition between multiple participants, who are required to give the best description for a certain image offered by the contest organizer. Rules and information about the competition process are also given by the competition organizer.\n\nCaption contest participants have to describe a given image as accurately and originally as possible. Contests may vary by image type (photo or drawing), caption format (description of a situation or a dialogue), as well as judging criteria. The competition organizer is required to give information about caption submission rules and other information that is important for the contest.\n\nCaption contests are mainly arranged as an amusement, and they can be organized under different conditions (between separate individuals, in public events, mass media, etc.), as well as using various means (drawn pictures on paper, digital image, printed image, press publication, etc.). Traditionally, the most popular and typical format has been publication of caption contests in newspapers or magazines, but with the development of modern technologies, it is also very popular to organize caption contests on the Internet.\n\nCaption contests can be used not only as an entertainment but also for other purposes, such as newspaper promotion, bringing forward a certain problem, or product advertisement. An important aspect of caption competition is to look at an object, event or issue from unusual point of view.\n\nThe caption, unless competition rules do not restrict, can be in any form of literary expression - prose, poetry, as one word or a word play. Usually the submitted captions are judged by the originality and wit, but not always the decisive assessment is humour. It is generally assumed that the caption has to describe image as precisely as possible, so both humour and precision are equally important.\n\nAs caption writing is an art of words, it is rarely possible to evaluate the superiority of one caption over others accurately and objectively. Consequently, the judging of submitted captions is usually quite subjective. Sometimes competition rules limit caption size, but usually the caption is no longer than one sentence (10 - 20 words). As an exception, the caption can consist of several sentences. Usually it is not allowed to use profane or offensive language in submitted captions.\n\nIn several caption contests, winners are awarded with prizes.\n\nIt is considered that the origins of caption contests are related to the increase of popularity of cartoons and comics as well as widespread use of illustrations and the rise of photojournalism in printed media at the end of the 19th century. All these areas share the combination of words and images that could be multiplied and made available to a wide audience with the beginnings of mass printing and wide spread of newspapers and magazines.\n\nFrom currently available information, the first caption contests in printed media appeared in the U.S. press of the late 19th century (such as \"Life\" magazine which was published from year 1883 to 1936). At that time these competitions were called \"picture title\" or \"picture headline\" contests, but their concept and meaning was identical to current caption contests. It must be considered, that the term \"caption\" in its present sense firstly appeared in English language only in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, at least in the U.S. press (for example, \"The San Francisco Call\", \"The Daily News\", \"The Bridgeport Telegram\") caption contests were already quite popular. In these competitions drawn pictures and cartoons were mainly used. Photo caption contests appeared little later with the improvement of printing quality (towards the second quarter of 20th century).\n\nDuring the course of the 20th century, caption contests were published in printed media in many countries of the world. For example, in Soviet Union one of the first caption contests was published in daily newspaper \"Izvestia\" Sunday supplement \"Nedelya\" (\"The Week\") at the beginning of the 1960s. Little later a newspaper \"Literaturnaya gazeta\" began to publish caption contests that became very popular and they are part of this newspaper up until now.\n\nThe spread of caption contests increased even more with the emergence of the Internet by the end of the 20th century, and at the beginning of the 21st century. Internet has made the organization of caption contests and participation in them possible for wide audiences across the world.\n\nAlthough a considerable amount of caption contests are now on Internet, caption contests in printed media still exist and are quite popular. A very popular and prominent is a weekly caption contest published in American magazine \"The New Yorker\". The contest first appeared in 1998 and has been published regularly in each issue since 2005. Each week several thousand participants take part in this competition. On the Internet, a very popular is the weekly caption competition on \"BBC\" website (\"Magazine Monitor\" section), held since 2006.\n\nAlong the traditional caption contests, there have appeared different forms of this genre such as anti-caption contests for worst submitted caption and reverse caption contests where the most suitable picture must be submitted for a given caption. There are also caption contests devoted to particular themes such as history or football.\n\nIn 2006, the website caption.me (then captioncompetition.co.uk) was founded, featuring amusing photos loaded automatically from photo-sharing site Flickr. Visitors submit captions and vote for others. Caption.Me features a real-time collaborative mind-mapping feature called Maption\n\nIn 2009, there was released an online multiplayer caption writing game called \"Caption That\" where players write captions for a given image and then vote for their favourite from the list others have written.\n\nIn 2014, the iPhone app Captionit was released on the Apple App Store. Captionit is a free mobile app that allows people to play and create caption contests on their iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.\n\nIn 2016, mobile phone application TinnBin was released for both iPhone and Android. TinnBin users create contests called \"Bins\" by uploading a picture from their device and selecting how long they would like the contest to run. While the bin is open, users can add and vote on comments, called \"Tinns\". Once the bin is closed, the winning tinn is appended to the image in the form of a caption. TinnBin is different from most other caption contests as the winner is chosen strictly by users of the application, and not the contest creators, and all the contests are created by users of the application.\n\n\"The New Yorker\" magazine, noting the popularity of its cartoon caption contest, has created a caption contest board game and issued a book with the most interesting cartoons and winning captions as well as comprehensive information covering this theme.\n\nAlso concerning the \"New Yorker\" caption contest, several scientific studies have been carried out: researchers from University of New Mexico, Department of Anthropology, in 2010 have compared humour ability in males and females in context of this competition; members of \"The New Yorker\" editorial board and University of Colorado Boulder Leeds School of Business in 2011 analysed several thousand entries of this contest to study the concept of humour.\n\nThe future of caption contests depends on the imagination and creativity of their organizers and participants, as well as future development of information and communication technologies.\n\nIn U.S. TV series \"The Office\", seventh-season episode \"The Search\", its character Pam starts a caption contest in the office, with her co-worker Gabe instituting rules that no one wants to follow.\n\nIn British sitcom \"Green Wing\", the second series, episode six, its character Alan Statham wins a caption competition on the \"Consultant Radiologists International\" website, an organisation of which Alan claims to be an \"Esteemed member\".\n\nIn a children's novel \"Absolute Zero\" by Helen Cresswell its character Uncle Parker has won a trip to the Caribbean in a caption contest. The rest of the family immediately enter similar competitions in an attempt to better his prize but, much of the time, beating the others to an entry form is a victory in itself.\n\nIn season two of the HBO series \"Bored to Death\", George (played by Ted Danson) struggles to caption a New Yorker cartoon, which portrays a police duck interacting with a suicidal bear.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1602780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1602780", "title": "Children's music", "text": "Children's music\n\nChildren's music or kids' music is music composed and performed for children. In European-influenced contexts this means music, usually songs, written specifically for a juvenile audience. The composers are usually adults. Children's music has historically held both entertainment and educational functions. Children's music is often designed to provide an entertaining means of teaching children about their culture, other cultures, good behavior, facts and skills. Many are folk songs, but there is a whole genre of educational music that has become increasingly popular.\n\nThe growth of the popular music publishing industry, associated with New York's Tin Pan Alley in the late 19th and early 20th centuries led to the creation of a number of songs aimed at children. These included 'Ten little fingers and ten little toes' by Ira Shuster and Edward G. Nelson and 'School Days' (1907) by Gus Edwards and Will Cobb. Perhaps the best remembered now is \"Teddy Bears' Picnic\", with lyrics by Jimmy Kennedy in 1932 and the tune by British composer John William Bratton was from 1907.\n\nRecordings for children were intertwined with recorded music for as long as it has existed as a medium. The first words ever recorded (in 1860 by Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville) was the first verse of the French folk/children's song \"Au Clair de la Lune\". In 1888, the first recorded discs (called \"plates\") offered for sale included Mother Goose nursery rhymes. The earliest record catalogues of several seminal figures in the recording industry such as Edison, Berliner, and Victor all contained separate children's sections.\n\nThroughout the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s record companies continued to produce albums for children. Such companies as RCA Victor, Decca Records, Capitol Records, and Columbia Records (among others) published albums based on popular cartoons or nursery rhymes. Recordings based on Disney films and cartoons were released at that time by RCA Victor and Capitol Records, and beginning in the late 1950s by Disneyland Records and Buena Vista Records. Often the albums were read-alongs that contained booklets that children could follow along with. Many of the biggest names in theater, radio, and motion pictures were featured on these albums, such as: Bing Crosby, Harold Peary (\"The Great Gildersleeve\"), Orson Welles, Jeanette MacDonald, Roy Rogers, Fanny Brice, William Boyd (\"Hopalong Cassidy\"), Ingrid Bergman, Danny Kaye, and Fredric March.\n\nThe role of Disney in children's cinema from the 1930s meant that it gained a unique place in the production of children's music. The first popular Disney song was 'Minnie's Yoo Hoo' (1930) the theme song from a Mickey Mouse cartoon. After the production of their first feature-length animation \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" in 1937, with its highly successful score by Frank Churchill and Larry Morey, which included the songs \"Whistle while you work\", \"Some Day My Prince Will Come\" and \"Heigh-Ho\", the mould for a combination of animation, fairy tale and distinctive songs was set that would carry through to the 1970s with songs from films such as \"Pinocchio\" (1940) and \"Song of the South\" (1946).\n\nThe mid-20th-century arrival of the baby boomers provided a growing market for children's music as a separate genre. Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and Ella Jenkins were among a cadre of politically progressive and socially conscious performers who aimed albums to this group. During this time, such novelty recordings as \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" (a Montgomery Ward jingle that became a book and later a classic children's movie) and the fictional music group, The Chipmunks, were among the most commercially successful music ventures of the time (\"The Chipmunk Song\" was a No. 1 hit single in 1958). TV personality Bob Keeshan (\"Captain Kangaroo\") recorded several children's albums, as did Shari Lewis.\n\nIn the 1960s, as the baby boomers matured and became more politically aware, they embraced both the substance and politics of folk (\"the people's\") music. Peter, Paul, and Mary, The Limeliters, and Tom Paxton were acclaimed folk artists who wrote albums for children. In 1969, the Children's Television Workshop in the United States launched \"Sesame Street\". The quality of \"Sesame Street\"s children's music, much of it created by noted composers Joe Raposo and Jeff Moss, has dominated the children's music landscape to this day - the show has won 11 Grammy Awards.\n\nChildren's music gained an even wider audience in the 1970s when musical features such as \"Schoolhouse Rock!\" and the original Letter People were featured on network and public television, respectively. These represented an effort to make music that taught specific lessons about Math, History, and English to youngsters through the high-quality, award-winning music. The classic public television children's show \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\" had music heavily featured as well. In the late 1970s, Canadian artist Raffi, coincided with the rise of children's music as a distinct music industry genre.\n\nIn the early 1990s, songwriter, record producer, and performer Bobby Susser, emerged strongly with his easy-to-learn, award-winning young children's songs and series, \"Bobby Susser Songs For Children\" that exemplified the use of children's music to educate young children in schools and at home. Musical duo Greg & Steve have focused on the positive reaction children have to music.\n\nDisney also re-entered the market for animated musical features, beginning with \"The Little Mermaid\" (1989) from which the song \"Under the Sea\" won an Oscar for best song. This was followed by successful features including \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1991) \"Aladdin\" (1992), and \"The Lion King\" (1994), the last of which had music by Elton John and Tim Rice, and \"Pocahontas\" (1995), all of which were awarded best song Oscars.\n\nIn the United States, children's music continues to be a force in the commercial music industry. At one point in early 2006, the top three albums on the Billboard charts were all children's music: Disney's \"High School Musical\" soundtrack, the \"Kidz Bop\" series, and the \"Curious George\" film soundtrack. Most albums targeted nationally to children are soundtracks for motion pictures or symbiotic marketing projects involving mass-marketed acts such as, The Wiggles or VeggieTales.\n\nThe 21st century has also seen an increase in the number of independent children's music artists, with acts like The Dirty Sock Funtime Band, Dan Zanes, Parachute Express, Cathy Bollinger, Laurie Berkner and Lah-Lah getting wide exposure on cable TV channels targeted to children. Trout Fishing in America has achieved much acclaim continuing the tradition of merging sophisticated folk music with family-friendly lyrics. Secret Agent 23 Skidoo infuses hip-hop with family friendly messages and imaginative stories and is known as \"The King of Kid-Hop\". Also recently, traditionally rock-oriented acts like They Might Be Giants have released albums marketed directly to children, such as \"No!\" and \"Here Come the ABCs\". Jimmy Buffett simply remade his \"Cheeseburger in Paradise\" song into children's music with cleaned up lyrics (\"Root Beer\" instead of \"Draft Beer\"). His songs were already kid friendly with catchy lyrics and simple melodies punctuated with penny whistles and ship bell sound effects. Conversely, Koo Koo Kanga Roo, a children-oriented comedy synthpop duo, made a successful crossover from performing children's events into touring with adult rock and punk bands such as Reel Big Fish and Frank Turner. In Canada, artists such as The Kerplunks have paved modern pathways to the genre following in the footsteps of Raffi, Fred Penner and Sharon, Lois & Bram.\n\nSanitized versions of earthy songs like Harry McClintock's \"Big Rock Candy Mountain\" have regularly been adapted for younger audiences. The 2008 version by Gil McLachlan re-tells the story as a child's dream, the last stanza being:\n\nMany children's stores and sometimes music outlets sell covers of pop songs, performed by adults for children, especially Christmas songs. These were especially popular during the early 2000s.\n\nThe use of children's music, to educate, as well as entertain, continued to grow, as evidenced in February 2009, when Bobby Susser's young children's series surpassed five million CD sales. In September 2016 Smithsonian Folkways Recordings label acquired the Bobby Susser series, to further the exposure of children's music that teaches as well as entertains, throughout the world.\n\nAs more children are using smart phones, tablets, laptops and smart-TVs, kids songs have entered the on-demand streaming content era. On YouTube, some children's songs, like \"Baby Shark\" and \"Let it go\", have surpassed 1 billion views, easily becoming some of the most viewed YouTube videos of all time.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1460069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1460069", "title": "Clip show", "text": "Clip show\n\nA clip show is an episode of a television series that consists primarily of excerpts from previous episodes. Most clip shows feature the format of a frame story in which cast members recall past events from past installments of the show, depicted with a clip of the event presented as a flashback. Clip shows are also known as cheaters, particularly in the field of animation. Clip shows are often played before series finales, or once syndication becomes highly likely. Other times, however, clip shows are simply produced for budgetary reasons (i.e. to avoid additional costs from shooting in a certain setting, or from casting actors to appear in new material).\n\nClip shows have their origin in theatrical short films and serials. Every serial chapter always had a brief recap showing where the previous chapter left off, but, beginning in 1936, entire chapters were largely devoted to material that audiences had already seen. In these recap chapters (also called \"economy chapters\"),\nprevious chapters were summarized for those who may have missed some episodes (which were unlikely to be rerun). The practice began with the Republic Pictures serial \"Robinson Crusoe of Clipper Island\". Adverse weather conditions slowed the filming of this outdoor adventure budgeted for 12 chapters, and screenwriter Barry Shipman was forced to create two more chapters to recoup the lost production costs. Shipman wrote a few scenes in which the screen characters recount their adventures to date, and stock footage from previous chapters is shown instead of new sequences. Shipman's brainstorm was a convenient way to economize on production, and soon Republic made the recap chapter standard procedure.\n\nMovie studios often resorted to old footage to save money. The most famous example is the short comedies of The Three Stooges which, from 1949 until 1957, borrowed lengthy sequences and often entire storylines from old shorts. Only a few new scenes would be filmed as a framework for the old footage. This practice was adopted because the studios could charge more money for \"new\" films than for old ones.\n\nAnimation studios were also known to periodically make cartoon shorts - often referred to as \"cheaters\" - made up primarily of clips for earlier cartoons in order to save money. Examples of this include \"Betty Boop's Rise to Fame\" (Fleischer/Paramount, 1934), \"What's Cookin' Doc?\" (1944, Schlesinger/Warner Bros.) and a regular yearly series of \"Tom & Jerry\" \"cheaters\" such as \"Smitten Kitten\" (1952, MGM).\n\nOne variant of the modern clip show is the compilation episode, using clips from the most popular episodes, assembled together in one episode, sometimes without a frame story as such.\n\nAnother format is to have a host who describes various characters and characteristics of the show to introduce various clips from past episodes. For example, a special one-hour clip show episode of \"All in the Family\" featured actor Henry Fonda discussing the main characters on the show followed by relevant clips from previous episodes; a similar two-part clip show appeared on \"Three's Company\", hosted by Lucille Ball. This format was parodied in a clip show for \"The Simpsons\" (\"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\"), in which fictional actor Troy McClure—a recurring \"Simpsons\" character—introduced the clips.\n\nA third variation, used in a two-part clip show episode of \"Cheers\" featured the entire cast of the show, including former cast members, sitting on a stage while being interviewed by talk host John McLaughlin about their characters on the show, with clips of previous episodes mixed in. A similar clip episode of \"Barney Miller\" aired after the death of cast member Jack Soo, with flashbacks introduced by the rest of the cast highlighting Soo's character Detective Sergeant Nick Yamana.\n\n\"\" had a flashback episode 2 episodes in to the series. The two main leads reminisce on the previous episode and other adventures they went on. The episode was highly praised.\n\nIn the \"\" episode \"The Ember Island Players\", the show's main characters watch a play about themselves based upon the events of the series thus far. Although the episode contains no actual footage from previous episodes, the actors recount many scenes from the series and show all the significant plot events. \"The Ember Island Players\" was the last episode before the four-part series finale.\n\nThe NBC sitcom \"Community\" used the clip show format with the episode \"Paradigms of Human Memory\", but rather than using clips from previous episodes, the cut-away scenes in that episode were all newly shot. In some cases the clips were set in events of previous episodes, and in other cases the clips showed events that had never before occurred on the show, such as visiting an Old West ghost town, taking over for a glee club killed in a bus crash or going on a fishing trip. The creator of \"Community\", Dan Harmon, used the same format in another one of his shows, \"Rick and Morty\", where all the clips were completely new and related to the episode, 'Total Rickall', in some way.\n\nIn anime, a common type of episode is the Recap episode, which presents clips from previous episodes in a manner to remind viewers of the story so far and help newer viewers catch up on the plot and details.\n\nWhile clip shows do reduce production costs, they were originally employed in an era when there were far fewer program outlets and it was less likely that episodes from previous seasons would be aired again. Clip shows typically received strong ratings, and it was expected for any successful comedy series to feature clip shows regularly in its later years. However, the episodes were subject to some ridicule due to their forced or \"corny\" framing devices (such as a family sitting peacefully around a fireplace) and the frequently awkward transitions between the frame story and the clips (such as characters staring into space while the screen blurs to represent \"remembering\").\n\nDaytime soap operas frequently present clip shows as a way to commemorate a show's milestone anniversary or the death of a long-running character. Many fans take advantage of the shows in order to see vintage clips of a particular soap opera. One example was an episode of \"As the World Turns\" in which seven of the longest running characters were stranded in a forest and remembered some of their best moments, all in honor of \"AtWT\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 50th anniversary.\n\nAnother common rationale for a clip show is the lack of a new show to air, due to failure to meet production schedules. For example, the computer-animated series \"\" used clip shows four times for this purpose, interrupting in-progress story arcs. Similarly, the \"Moonlighting\" season 3 episode \"The Straight Poop\" helped to fill out a production schedule that was rife with delays: in 15 weeks since that season began, only 8 episodes of the \"weekly\" series had been broadcast. \"Chappelle's Show\" resorted to producing \"five\" clip shows (using material from only 25 episodes) over the course of its first two seasons.\n\nOther times budgetary considerations force clip shows. At the end of its second season, \"\" had one more episode to shoot. However, Paramount cut that show's budget to make up for an episode earlier in the season that had gone over budget—and, similarly, over schedule, leaving only three days for principal photography. Because the season had gotten off to a slow start due to a writers' strike, the producers had no scripts set aside for future use as they normally would have. The result was \"\", in which the \"clips\" were the induced dreams of a comatose William T. Riker. The episode is widely considered among the worst of any \"Star Trek\" series.\n\nClip shows today tend to offset such criticism by trying to make the frame tale surrounding the clips compelling, or by presenting clip shows without any framing device. A show might also diffuse the awkwardness by indulging in self-parody, explicitly acknowledging or intentionally over-playing the device. Many series have included parody clip shows using \"clips\" from episodes which never happened. The \"South Park\" episode \"City on the Edge of Forever\" shows scenes from previous episodes, but the details are always wrong, and in the end, everyone gets ice cream. As another example, \"\" ran a clip show as its second episode, even though there was only one prior episode from which to pull material. The aforementioned \"Moonlighting\" clip episode, in typical fashion for the show, used a framing story that broke the fourth wall to determine if the characters themselves were the source of the show's notorious production delays, and ended with the characters promising a \"new episode next week!\".\n\nThe clip show has been employed more seriously as a means to bring viewers up to date on highly serialized dramas, such as on \"Lost\", \"Once Upon a Time\" and the reimagined \"Battlestar Galactica\". Many anime dramas used similar techniques, particularly when a series ran for more episodes in one season than could be reasonably rerun (such as \"Mobile Suit Gundam Wing\" running for 49 episodes, which were originally aired weekly).\n\nSometimes clip shows air before or during a series finale as a way for audiences to reminisce about their favorite moments. Some examples of shows that have used clip shows in this sense are: \"Animaniacs\", \"Frasier\", \"The Golden Girls\", \"Seinfeld\", \"Friends\", \"Thunderbirds\", \"Everybody Loves Raymond\", \"The Outer Limits\", \"Stargate SG-1\"/\"Atlantis\", and \"Cheers\".\n\nClip shows are also a way to compile the best episodes or sketches from a series to air in a single, concise package when rerunning a whole episode or series is implausible. The annual Scottish New Year special \"Scotch and Wry\" was condensed into four feature film-length episodes for home video release. \"Carson's Comedy Classics\" compiled memorable sketches from the first 20 seasons of \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" for airing in syndication. Surviving content from Bozo the Clown and other Chicago children's television programs was incorporated into \"\", an annual holiday special.\n\n\n"}

In 1972-73, Dell reprinted the series, numbering them #6-8 (the reason for skipping issue #5 is unknown).\n\nDracula is a modern-day direct descendant of the original Count Dracula now working as a medical researcher in the old family castle in Transylvania where, due to his experiments to develop a cure for brain damage using a serum developed from bat blood, he accidentally gains strange \"vampire\"-like powers, including the ability to turn into a bat and superhuman sight and hearing.

According to the rules of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, a feature-length motion picture must have a running time of more than 40 minutes to be eligible for an Academy Award.\n\nTelevision movies and direct-to-video may also be feature length. An episode of a TV series that has been extended may also be feature length. Such feature-length episodes are usually series pilots, holiday specials, or season finales.\n\nThe earliest known feature-length narrative film in the world was the Australian production \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\" (1906), which was 60 minutes in length. Five-reel features became common practice in the industry in 1915. During the silent era a one-reel short ran for an average of 10 minutes, and a two-reeler (usually a comedy) for 20 minutes, thus a feature was around 50 minutes or more. Possibly due to competition from television, the average length of feature film increased from around 90 minutes in 1931 to almost 120 minutes in 1960.\n\n"}
{"id": "549452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=549452", "title": "Fire eating", "text": "Fire eating\n\nFire eating is the act of putting a flaming object into the mouth and extinguishing it. A fire eater can be an entertainer, a street performer, part of a sideshow or a circus act but has also been part of spiritual tradition in India.\n\nFire eating relies on the quick extinction of the fire in the mouth or on the touched surfaces and on the short term cooling effects of water evaporation at the surface on the source of fire (usually with a low percentage of alcohol mixed in the water) or saliva in the mouth. This allows for igniting a damp handkerchief or a bill of money without it burning. Closing the mouth, or covering it with a slap of the hand cuts off the oxygen to the fire. Blowing on it can remove the very thin area of reaction from the source of fuel, and thus extinguish the fire in some cases, where the blown air is faster than the fire front and the flame is small enough to be entirely removed.\n\nThe flame itself is not a cold flame, and the performers do not use any other material besides the fuel. Certain materials are avoided when doing the trick, such as materials which may easily ignite, melt or store the heat and release it later. These include paraffin candles, plastic, and thick multithreaded rope.\n\nFire eating was a common part of Hindu, Sadhu, and Fakir performances to show spiritual attainment. It became a part of the standard sideshow acts in the late 1880s and was often seen as one of the entry-level skills for sideshow performers, although skilled fire performers, such as those who can use the difficult and dangerous vapor transfers and produce large breaths of fire are regarded as equals in the circus community for their skill and devotion to their art.\n\nOther than sound fire safety precautions and some practical advice regarding the laws of physics (i.e. \"hot air rises\"), there are few secrets to eating fire. Torches do not burn with \"cold flames\" nor is there any special substance in the performer's mouth other than saliva. It is instead the cutting off of the oxygen from the flame which extinguishes it and the evaporation of saliva with the water in the alcoholic solution which keeps the nearby surfaces cool while it is still burning. Even so, according to Daniel Mannix's 1951 sideshow memoir \"Step right up!\", the real \"secret\" to fire eating is enduring pain; he mentions that tolerating constant blisters on your tongue, lips and throat is also necessary. Many other fire eaters dismiss this, claiming that a skilled fire eater should not burn themselves. The most common method of safely performing fire eating acts relies on the fact that it takes time to transfer heat, and that heat rises in air. Fire eating and fire breathing (and all variants) is a skill which should be passed on from a skilled master to an appropriate student and almost all teachings include instructions on first aid, fire safety, chemistry and other appropriate skills. Accidental ingestion of fuel or improper technique can lead to a serious condition known as fire eater's pneumonia.\n\nA famous fire eater from the 18th century was Robert Powell who allegedly not only swallowed fire but also red-hot coals, melted sealing wax and even brimstone. He performed, often in front of British and other European royalty and nobility, for nearly sixty years and, in 1751, was awarded a purse of gold and a large silver medal.\n\nAlthough not the earliest, the first to attract the attention of the upper classes was an Englishman named Richardson, who first performed in France in 1667. His methods were subsequently made public by his servant.\n\nThe most torches extinguished in one minute with the mouth (using multiple rods) is 99 and was achieved by Bret Pasek (U.S.) at the Minnesota Renaissance Festival in Shakopee, Minnesota, on 7 September 2014.\n\nThe longest duration fire torch teething is 3 minutes 38.39 seconds and was achieved by Alexander Spitfire (U.S.) at Circo Draconum's Draco's Inferno in Hell's Kitchen Lounge Newark, New Jersey on August 30, 2015.\n\nWhile trick categories (vapor, transfers, extinguishes, etc.) are recognized by most, it is important to note that specific trick names may vary greatly depending on the region of the world in which the student learned.\n\nVapor tricks use the fuel vapors held in the mouth during or before an extinguish.\n\nTransfers are methods of moving a flame from one area to another, by using the body, or another surface or medium.\n\nExtinguishes are methods of extinguishing torches, and are the traditional hallmark of fire eating.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was used in English from about the mid-19th century (for example, by William Makepeace Thackeray in 1840 in one of his Parisian sketches), but in the 20th century, came to be applied in its more modern sense.\n\nIn 1997 the publisher HarperCollins drew up a list of 101 words – one a year – that defined the years 1896 to 1997. \"Gamine\" was chosen for 1899, being described by Philip Howard in \"The Times\" as follows:\n\n\"Gamine\" has been used particularly of such women in the performing arts or world of fashion. In that context, the closest English word – of Anglo-Norman origin – is probably \"waif\" (although \"gamine\" is often seen as conveying an additional sense of style and chic). For example, in a press release of 1964, impresario Andrew Oldham described the 17-year-old singer Marianne Faithfull as \"shy, wistful, waif-like\"; and writer and musician John Amis referred to German-born actress Luise Rainer (b. 1910) as Paul Muni's \"waif-wife\" in the 1937 film, \"The Good Earth\".\n\n\"Gaminerie\" has sometimes been used in English with reference to the behaviour or characteristics of gamin(e)s.\n\nIn the early 20th century, silent films brought to public attention a number of actresses who sported a gamine look. These included the Canadian-born Mary Pickford (1892–1979), who became known as \"America’s Sweetheart\" and, with her husband Douglas Fairbanks, was one of the founders of the film production company United Artists; Lillian Gish (1893–1993), notably in \"Way Down East\" (1920); and Louise Brooks (1906–86), whose short bobbed hairstyle, widely copied in the 1920s, came to be regarded as both a gamine and a \"Bohemian\" trait (this style having first appeared among the Paris \"demi-monde\" before World War I and among London art students during the war.) In 1936, Charlie Chaplin cast his then-girlfriend Paulette Goddard (1910–1990) as an orphaned gamine (credited as \"A Gamin\") in one of his last silent films, \"Modern Times\".\n\nIn the 1950s \"gamine\" was applied notably to the style and appearance of the Belgian-born actress Audrey Hepburn (1929–1993): for example, in the films, \"Sabrina\" (1954) and \"Funny Face\" (1957). Hepburn also played the role of the gamine Gigi in New York (1951) in the play of that name, based on the novel (1945) by Colette, who had personally \"talent-spotted\" her when she was filming in Monte Carlo. On film and in photographs, Hepburn’s short hair and petite figure created a distinct and enduring \"look\", well defined by Don Macpherson, who cited her \"naïveté which did not rule out sophistication\", and described her as \"the first gamine to be accepted as overpoweringly chic\".\n\nOther film actresses of the period regarded as gamines included Leslie Caron (b. 1931), who played the leading role in the 1958 musical film of \"Gigi\"; Jean Seberg (1938–79), best known in \"Bonjour Tristesse\" (1957) and Jean-Luc Godard’s \"À bout de souffle\" (1960); Jean Simmons (1929-2010), for example, in \"Angel Face\" (1952); and Rita Tushingham (b. 1940), whose first starring role was in \"A Taste of Honey\" (1961). The French singer Juliette Greco (b. 1926), who emerged from Bohemian Paris in the late 1940s to become an international star in the 1950s, also had gamine qualities.\n\nIn many ways, the \"gamine look\" of the 1950s paved the way for the success of the following English models: Jean Shrimpton (b. 1942), one of the first to promote the mini-skirt in 1965; Twiggy (b. Lesley Hornby, 1949), who became \"The Face of '66\"; and Kate Moss (b. 1974), associated in the 1990s with the \"waif\" look and what, notably through an advertising campaign for Calvin Klein in 1997, became known as \"heroin chic.\" Moss was part of a trend of \"wafer\" thin models which was satirized in Neil Kerber’s strip cartoon \"Supermodels\" in the magazine \"Private Eye\".\n\nGamines share similarities with the modern, cinematic \"Manic Pixie Dream Girl\" stock character.\n\nOthers who have been described as gamines include Danish-French actress Anna Karina (b. 1940); American actresses Julia Roberts (b. 1967) (she was often compared to Audrey Hepburn at the start of her career), Edie Sedgwick (1943–1971), Elizabeth Hartman (1943–1987), Mia Farrow (b. 1945), Sissy Spacek (b. 1949), Winona Ryder (b. 1971), Michelle Williams (b. 1980), Gwyneth Paltrow (b. 1972), Calista Flockhart (b. 1964), Bridget Fonda (b. 1964), Mary Stuart Masterson (b. 1966), Jennifer Jason Leigh (b. 1962), and Ginnifer Goodwin (b. 1978); British actresses Carey Mulligan (b. 1985), Susannah York (1939–2011), Suzanna Hamilton (b. 1960), Helena Bonham Carter (b. 1966), Elisabeth Sladen (1946-2011), Carole Ann Ford (b. 1940) Tara FitzGerald (b. 1967), Olivia Williams (b. 1968), Rachel Weisz (b. 1970), Keira Knightley (b. 1985), and Emma Watson (b. 1990); Portuguese actress Maria de Medeiros (b. 1965); French actresses Juliette Binoche (b. 1964), Audrey Tautou (b. 1976), and Vanessa Paradis (b. 1972); Israeli-American actress Natalie Portman (b. 1981); Canadian model Linda Evangelista (b. 1965); American models Kristen McMenamy (b. 1964) and Tina Chow (1951–92) (whose \"gamine look made her the darling of [photographers] Cecil Beaton and Arthur Elgort\"); Russian tennis player Anastasia Myskina (b. 1981); and American singer Cat Power (b. Chan Marshall, 1972) (\"The French, in particular, took to her gamine looks and confused air\").\n\nPenelope Chetwode (1910–86), later Lady Betjeman, wife of the Poet Laureate, John Betjeman, was described by Betjeman's biographer A. N. Wilson as \"gamine of feature, but large-breasted\". Corinne Bailey Rae alleged that she was called a gamine in her song, \"Choux Pastry Heart\" (2005).\n\nJapanese 1990s J-Pop rock band vocalist Maki Watase was called a \"spry gamine firecracker\" in a review in the New Music Express.\n\nAmong the notable gamine characters of film are Gelsomina, the street performer from \"La Strada\", played by Giulietta Masina; Bree Daniels, the prostitute played by Jane Fonda (b. 1937) in \"Klute\" (1971) (whose hairstyle was sometimes referred to as the \"Klute shag\"); Nikita (Anne Parillaud, b. 1960), the titular punkish junkie in Luc Besson's 1990 film; and, most recently, Amélie (Audrey Tautou) in the 2001 romantic comedy of that name.\n"}

The challenge called for privately funded teams to be the first to land a robotic spacecraft on the Moon, travel 500 meters, and transmit back to Earth high-definition video and images.\n\nIn 2015, XPRIZE announced that the competition deadline would be extended to December 2017 if at least one team could secure a verified launch contract by 31 December 2015. Two teams secured such a launch contract, and the deadline was extended. In August 2017, the deadline was extended again, to 31 March 2018.\n\nEntering 2018, five teams remained in the competition: SpaceIL, Moon Express, Synergy Moon, Team Indus, and Team Hakuto, having secured verified launch contracts with Spaceflight Industries, Rocket Lab, Interorbital Systems, and ISRO (jointly for the last two teams).\n\nOn 23 January 2018, the X Prize Foundation announced that \"no team would be able to make a launch attempt to reach the Moon by the [31 March 2018] deadline... and the US$30 million Google Lunar XPRIZE will go unclaimed.\" On 5 April 2018, the X Prize Foundation announced that the Lunar XPRIZE would continue as a non-cash competition.\n\nThe Google Lunar XPRIZE was announced at the Wired Nextfest on 13 September 2007. The competition offered a total of US$30 million in prizes to the first privately funded teams to land a robot on the Moon that successfully travels more than 500 meters (1,640 ft) and transmits back high-definition images and video. The first team to do so would have claimed the US$20 million grand prize; while the second team to accomplish the same tasks would have been awarded a US$5 million second prize. Teams also earned additional money by completing additional tasks beyond the baseline requirements required to win the grand or second prize, such as traveling ten times the baseline requirements (greater than 5,000 meters (3 mi)), capturing images of the remains of Apollo program hardware or other man-made objects on the Moon, verifying from the lunar surface the recent detection of water ice on the Moon, or surviving a lunar night. Additionally, a US$1 million diversity award was to be given to teams that make significant strides in promoting ethnic diversity in STEM fields.\n\nTo provide an added incentive for teams to complete their missions quickly, it was announced that the prize would decrease from US$20 million to US$15 million whenever a government-led mission lands on and explores the lunar surface. However, in November 2013, the organizers and the teams agreed to drop this rule, as the launch of the Chinese Chang'e 3 probe—which landed on the Moon in December 2013—approached.\n\nIn 2015, XPRIZE announced that the competition deadline would be extended to December 2017 if at least one team could secure a verified launch contract by 31 December 2015. Two teams secured such a launch contract, and the deadline was extended.\n\nXPRIZE announced 5 finalists on 24 January 2017. SpaceIL, Moon Express, Synergy Moon, Team Indus, and Hakuto having secured verified launch contracts for 2017 (with SpaceX, Rocket Lab, Interorbital Systems and ISRO respectively). All other teams had until the end of 2016 to secure a verified launch contract, but failed to meet this deadline.\n\nThe Google Lunar XPRIZE expired on 31 March 2018 as none of the five final teams were able to launch their vehicles by the deadline. Another extension of the deadline was ruled out by Google, and the prize went unclaimed.\n\nPeter Diamandis, the project founder, wrote on the official web page in 2007: \n\nThe goal of the Google Lunar X Prize was similar to that of the Ansari X Prize: to inspire a new generation of private investment in hopes of developing more cost-effective technologies and materials to overcome many limitations of space exploration that are currently taken for granted.\n\nThe Google Lunar XPRIZE was announced in 2007.\n\nSimilar to the way in which the Ansari XPRIZE was formed, the Google Lunar XPRIZE was created out of a former venture of Peter Diamandis to achieve a similar goal. Dr Diamandis served as CEO of BlastOff! Corporation, a commercial initiative to land a robotic spacecraft on the Moon as a mix of entertainment, internet, and space. Although it was ultimately unsuccessful, the BlastOff! initiative paved the way for the Google Lunar X Prize.\n\nInitially, NASA was the planned sponsor and the prize purse was just US$20 million. As NASA is a federal agency of the United States government, and thus funded by US tax money, the prize would only have been available to teams from the United States. The original intention was to propose the idea to other national space agencies, including the European Space Agency and the Japanese space agency, in the hope that they would offer similar prize purses.\n\nHowever, budget setbacks stopped NASA from sponsoring the prize. Peter Diamandis then presented the idea to Larry Page and Sergey Brin, co-founders of Google, at an XPRIZE fundraiser. They agreed to sponsor it, and also to increase the prize purse to US$30 million, allowing for a second place prize, as well as bonus prizes.\n\nThe prize was originally announced in 2007 as \"a contest to put a robotic rover on the Moon by 2012,\" with a $20 million prize to the winner if the landing was achieved by 2012; the prize decreased to $15M until the end of 2014, at which point the contest would conclude. The five-year deadline was optimistic about schedule. Jeff Foust commented in \"Space Review\" that as the end of 2012 approached, \"no team appeared that close to mounting a reasonable bid to win it.\" In 2010, the deadline was extended by one year, with the prize to expire at the end of December 2015, and the reduction of the grand prize from $20 million to $15 million changed from originally 2012 to \"if a government mission successfully lands on the lunar surface.\"\n\nOn 16 December 2014, XPRIZE announced another extension in the prize deadline from 31 December 2015 to 31 December 2016. In May 2015, the foundation announced another extension of the deadline. The deadline for winning the prize was now December 2017, but contingent on at least one team showing by 31 December 2015 that they have a secured contract for launch. On 9 October 2015, team SpaceIL announced their officially verified launch contract with SpaceX, therefore extending the competition until the end of 2017.\n\nOn 16 August 2017, the deadline was extended again, to 31 March 2018.\n\nSome observers have raised objections to the inclusion of the two \"Heritage Bonus Prizes,\" particularly the Apollo Heritage Bonus Prize, which was to award an additional estimated US$1 million to the first group that successfully delivers images and videos of the landing site of one of the Apollo Program landing sites, such as Tranquility Base, after landing on the lunar surface. Such sites are widely regarded as archaeologically and culturally significant, and some have expressed concern that a team attempting to win this heritage bonus might inadvertently damage or destroy such a site, either during the landing phase of the mission, or by piloting a rover around the site. As a result, some archaeologists went on record calling for the Foundation to cancel the heritage bonus and to ban groups from targeting landing zones within of previous sites.\n\nIn turn, the Foundation noted that, as part of the competition's educational goals, these bonuses fostered debate about how to respectfully visit previous lunar landing sites, but that it does not see itself as the appropriate adjudicator of such an internationally relevant and interdisciplinary issue. This response left detractors unsatisfied. The Foundation pointed to the historical precedent set by the Apollo 12 mission, which landed nearby the previous Surveyor 3 robotic probe. Pete Conrad and Alan Bean approached and inspected Surveyor 3 and even removed some parts from it to be returned to Earth for study; new scientific results from that heritage visit, on the exposure of manmade objects to conditions in outer space, were still being published in leading papers nearly four decades later. However, as Surveyor 3 and Apollo 12 were both NASA missions, there was no controversy at the time.\n\nIn January 2011, NASA's manager for lunar commercial space noted on Twitter that work was underway to provide insight and guidelines on how lunar heritage sites could be protected while still allowing visitations that could yield critical science. And in July 2011, NASA issued \"Recommendations to Space-Faring Entities: How to Protect and Preserve the Historic and Scientific Value of U.S. Government Lunar Artifacts\". These guidelines were developed with the assistance of Beth O'Leary, an anthropology professor at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, and a recognized leader in the emerging field of space archaeology. However, these are only guidelines and recommendations and are not enforceable beyond the possibility of \"moral sanctions.\" An organization called For All Moonkind, Inc. is now working to develop an international treaty that will include enforceable provisions designed to manage access to the Apollo sites and protect and preserve those sites, as well as others on the Moon, as the common heritage of all humankind.\n\nNevertheless, some of the Apollo astronauts themselves have expressed support for the bonus, with Apollo 11 Moonwalker Buzz Aldrin appearing at the Google Lunar XPRIZE's initial announcement and reading a plaque signed by the majority of his fellow surviving Apollo Astronauts.\n\nOn 23 January 2018, the X Prize Foundation announced that \"no team would be able to make a launch attempt to reach the Moon by the [31 March 2018] deadline... and the Google Lunar XPRIZE will go unclaimed.\"\n\nRegistration in the Google Lunar X Prize closed by 31 December 2010. The complete roster of 32 teams was announced in February 2011. By January 2017, there were just five officially registered Google Lunar X Prize teams continuing to pursue the prize objectives, as other teams had left the competition entirely, failed to achieve a competition interim milestone, or merged with other teams:\nInitially 32 teams were registered, with 16 teams having actively participated in all activities and only 5 teams satisfying the rule requiring a verified launch contract by 31 December 2016.\nShortly after the announcement of the complete roster of teams, an X Prize Foundation official noted that a total of thirty one teams entered a partial registration program by filing a \"Letter of Intent\" to compete; of these, twenty did indeed register or join other registered teams, while eleven ultimately did not register.\n\nIn November 2013 the X-Prize organization announced that several milestone prizes will be awarded to teams for demonstrating key technologies prior to the actual mission. A total of was awarded throughout 2014 for achieving the following milestones:\n\nIn February 2014, a judging panel selected five teams which could compete for several interim prizes based on their proposals to achieve particular goals. The teams and their ultimate awards were:\n\nThe five selected teams were required to accomplish the milestones outlined in their submissions through testing and mission simulations, in order to be awarded the interim prizes. The teams had until October 2014 to complete the prize requirements. The winners were officially awarded on 26 January 2015 in San Francisco.\n\nTeams were required to have verified launch contracts by the end of 2016 in order to remain in the competition. Although the contest ended without a winner, some of these teams have expressed an intention to launch in the future.\n\nThree other competitors who were unable to get a verified launch contract by 31 December 2016, leading their disqualification from Google Lunar X Prize, are also still planning to launch their crafts independently.\n\n\n"}

Golf was cancelled after the frequent objections of club members to the large expenses incurred by the game, which, after all, was not played by many members.\n\nLike other major sporting clubs in Egypt, Heliopolis Sporting Club has another branch, in Shorouk city.

{"id": "3128567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3128567", "title": "Herschend Family Entertainment", "text": "Herschend Family Entertainment\n\nHerschend Family Entertainment (HFE) is a privately owned themed-entertainment company that operates several theme parks and tourist attractions within the United States.\n\nFounded by Jack and Pete Herschend of Branson, Missouri, in its early years HFE was simply known as Herschend Enterprises. In the 1980s the name was changed to Silver Dollar City Inc., and in 2003 the company gained the current name. HFE is currently headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. The company's mission is to \"Create Memories Worth Repeating.\"\n\nHFE traces roots back to Hugo and Mary Herschend from Chicago, Illinois along with sons Jack and Pete. The family vacationed in Missouri’s Ozark Mountains region and fell in love with the nature the area offered. In 1951 Hugo obtained a 99-year lease on a Branson, Missouri area attraction called Marvel Cave. Hugo suffered a heart attack and later died in 1955, however Mary along with her two sons continued to improve the cave attraction by installing electric lighting and building cement walkways. A cable train was installed in 1958 to ferry guests out of the depths of the cave upon the end of the tour. The attendance nearly doubled and a small frontier town was erected to entertain visitors as they waited for their cave tour. In order to increase attendance furthermore at the attraction, a gimmick was used by naming the village \"Silver Dollar City\" and distributing silver dollars as change to every visitor in hope that when they would spend the rare coins they would tell people where they had got them from. The idea was a success, and the Herschend family soon found themselves involved in the theme park business.\n\nIn 1969, Silver Dollar City drew national attention when producer Paul Henning brought the cast and crew of the popular \"Beverly Hillbillies\" television show to the park to film five episodes.\n\nThe park is also home to many bats which the park takes measures to try and protect from diseases that could prove fatal.\n\nIn 2010, Herschend Family Entertainment was featured on the reality TV series \"Undercover Boss\".\n\nThe company also co-owns and co-operates with partners Dolly Parton and her company The Dollywood Company, the dinner and theatre company Pirates Voyage Dinner and Show in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and Dolly Parton's Stampede (formerly Dixie Stampede).\n\nThe Herschends extended their brand in 1976 upon purchasing a small tourist attraction in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, called Goldrush Junction. The following year the attraction was renamed Silver Dollar City Tennessee as part of a development plan to transform the property into a theme park patterned after the original Silver Dollar City in Branson. For the Pigeon Forge park, the Ozark Mountains theme of the original Silver Dollar City was slightly reworked to represent the Great Smoky Mountains and Appalachia culture instead, fitting the location in the foothills of the Smokies.\n\nIn 1986, singer and actress Dolly Parton, who grew up near Pigeon Forge, became a co-owner, and the park's name was changed to Dollywood, reflecting her involvement. At this point, the Pigeon Forge park was branched off into a separate division of HFE called The Dollywood Company, which oversees all the properties that Dolly Parton has interest in.\nAlong with the Herschend family, Dolly Parton co-owns the Dolly Parton's Stampede (formerly Dixie Stampede) dinner attraction chain, which has locations in Pigeon Forge (opened 1988), Myrtle Beach (1992), and Branson (1995). A location in Orlando opened in 2003 and closed in early 2008.\n\nIn 2001 a new water park was opened adjacent to the Dollywood theme park called Dollywood's Splash Country.\n\nHFE built several water parks in the 1980s which have since sold to other companies such as Wet 'n Wild, Frontier City, and Six Flags. White Water Branson, built in 1980, was the forerunner and is still owned by HFE; while the White Waters in Oklahoma City (1981), Grand Prairie, Texas (1982), Garland, Texas (1982) and Atlanta (1983) have been sold.\n\nThe 4,000 seat Grand Palace Theatre opened in 1992 by the Herschends. The theatre was co-owned by singer Kenny Rogers. Along with Rogers headliners were Glen Campbell, Louise Mandrell and Barbara Mandrell. In 1994 HFE entered into a ten-year contract with Radio City Entertainment. The Grand Palace Theatre would be the first to host the Radio City Christmas Spectacular starring the world famous Rockettes outside of New York City’s Radio City Music Hall. The shows were successful and led to Radio City Entertainment launching tours of their shows in other cities throughout the United States.\n\nHFE built the $10 million Grand Village Shops with Kenny Rogers adjacent to The Grand Palace Theatre in 1993. Ozark wares and English bone china filled the twenty six New Orleans themed shops. HFE later bought out entertainer Kenny Rogers and sold The Grand Palace in 1996 and The Grand Village in 2005.\n\nAmerican Adventures, a children’s theme park opened alongside White Water Atlanta. The park was sold to Six Flags in 1999.\n\nIn 1994, The Dollywood Company constructed a large music theatre in Pigeon Forge called Music Mansion. Headlined by James Rogers, the highly successful theatre was operated by HFE until 2001, when it was sold to Anita Bryant. In 2005 the theatre was sold again and converted to a WonderWorks location. A Music Mansion Theatre was planned for Myrtle Beach, but never materialized.\n\nIn 2003 the Dollywood Company opened a new Dixie Stampede location in Orlando, Florida along Interstate 4. The location operated until early 2008, when the property was sold to Simon Property Group for an undisclosed amount. The building was torn down, and an extension of the Orlando Vineland Premium Outlets was built on the land. HFE has plans to build another Dixie Stampede in the region at some point, though specific plans have not been disclosed.\n\nIn 2004 HFE purchased the Hawaiian Falls water parks located in Dallas, Garland and The Colony, Texas. In 2006 all three parks were sold.\n\nDue to unreliable peak season water access, Ride The Ducks in Memphis closed in 2007.\n\nCelebration City in Branson closed on October 25, 2008. The company has plans to restructure the site.\n"}

{"id": "1350109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1350109", "title": "Hulu", "text": "Hulu\n\nHulu (stylized as hulu ) is an American entertainment company that provides \"over-the-top media services.\" It is primarily oriented towards instant streaming of television series, carrying current and past episodes of many series from its owners' respective television networks and other content partners. Hulu is owned by Hulu LLC, a joint venture with The Walt Disney Company (holds 30% stake), 21st Century Fox (holds 30% stake), Comcast (via NBCUniversal; holds 30% stake), and AT&T (via WarnerMedia; holds 10% stake). Through a proposed acquisition announced in December 2017, Disney is to acquire Fox's partial ownership, giving it a majority stake if the deal closes.\n\nSome of Hulu's competitors include Netflix and Amazon. Previously it was divided into free and paid tiers, with the free service limited in the amount of content accessible by users and accessible via PC only, and a paid service with a larger library of content and accessed via Hulu applications for various mobile and connected devices. The subscription service is, in turn, divided into advertising-supported and mostly ad-free tiers. In 2016, Hulu spun out its free content into a joint venture with Yahoo! called Yahoo! View and launched a live television streaming service on May 3, 2017.\n\nHulu is currently offered only to users in the United States, its territories and Japan.\n\nThe name Hulu comes from two Mandarin words, \"húlú\" (葫芦/葫蘆), \"calabash; bottle gourd\", and \"hùlù\" (互录/互錄), \"interactive recording\". The company blog explains:\nIn Mandarin, \"Hulu\" has two interesting meanings, each highly relevant to our mission. The primary meaning interested us because it is used in an ancient Chinese proverb that describes the Hulu as the holder of precious things. It literally translates to \"gourd,\" and in ancient times, the Hulu was hollowed out and used to hold precious things. The secondary meaning is \"interactive recording\". We saw both definitions as appropriate bookends and highly relevant to the mission of Hulu.\n\nKey executives instrumental in the founding of Hulu include Bruce Campbell, Peter Chernin, JB Perrette, Michael Lang, Beth Comstock and Jason Kilar. The venture was announced in March 2006 with AOL, NBC Universal, now Comcast, Facebook, MSN, Myspace, and Yahoo! planned as \"initial distribution partners\". Kilar was named the CEO in June 2006.\n\nThe name \"Hulu\" was chosen in late August 2007, when the website went live, with an announcement only and no content. It invited users to leave their email addresses for the upcoming beta test. In October, Hulu began the private beta testing by invitation, and later allowed users to invite friends. Hulu launched for public access in the United States on March 12, 2008. The first product to launch was the HULU Syndication network, which was designed and developed by the NBC Universal team from New York, on October 29, 2007, followed by the Hulu.com destinations site.\n\nHulu began an advertising campaign during NBC's broadcast of Super Bowl XLIII with an initial ad starring Alec Baldwin titled \"Alec in Huluwood\". The ad intended to humorously reveal \"the shocking secret behind Hulu\", portraying the site as being an \"evil plot to destroy the world\" by suggesting that Baldwin is really an alien in disguise. Advertisements have since aired featuring Eliza Dushku, Seth MacFarlane, Denis Leary, and Will Arnett.\n\nIn July 2007, Providence Equity Partners, the owner of Newport Television, became one of the earliest \"outside\" investors by purchasing a 10 percent stake in the company for US$100 million equity investment, before the company was known as \"Hulu\". With its investment came a seat on the board of directors, where Providence was said to act as an \"independent voice on the board\". In October 2012, Providence sold its 10 percent stake to \"Hulu's media owners\" and ceased participation in the board.\n\nEarly in 2010, Hulu chief executive Jason Kilar said the service had made a profit in two quarters and that the company could top $100 million in revenue by summer 2010, more than its income for all of 2009. ComScore says monthly video streams reached 903 million in January 2010, over three times the figure for a year earlier, and second only to YouTube.\n\nOn August 16, 2010, a report revealed that Hulu was planning an initial public offering (IPO) which could value the company at more than $2 billion.\n\nOn June 21, 2011, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that an \"unsolicited offer\" caused Hulu to begin \"weighing whether to sell itself.\" On October 13, 2011 however, Hulu and its owners announced that they would not sell the company, as none of the bidders offered an amount that was satisfactory to its owners.\n\nIt was reported that in 2011, Hulu made $420 million. The figure was $80 million short of the predicted revenue. The vacant CEO post was officially filled by former Fox Networks President Mike Hopkins on October 17, 2013.\n\nIn December 2017, Disney announced that they would acquire 21st Century Fox, which includes its 30% stake in Hulu. The deal will result in Disney having a controlling interest in Hulu.\n\nFollowing the start of its service, Hulu signed deals with several new content providers making additional material available to consumers. On April 30, 2009, The Walt Disney Company announced that it would join the venture, purchasing a 27 percent stake in Hulu.\n\nStarting August 15, 2011, viewers of content from Fox and related networks are required to authenticate paid cable or satellite service wherever Fox streams episodes, including on Hulu, to be able to watch them the morning after the first airing. Non-subscribers will see those episodes delayed a week before they are viewable.\n\nOn October 28, 2011, Hulu announced that they had inked a five-year deal with The CW, giving the streaming site access to next-day content from five of the six major networks. On September 18, 2013, Hulu announced a multi-year deal with the BBC that will deliver 2,000 episodes from 144 different titles in the first 12 months.\n\nIn 2015, Hulu began offering content from Showtime for an additional $8.99/month, which is cheaper than Showtime's own streaming service. On June 16, 2016, Hulu announced a deal with the Disney-ABC Television Group for the exclusive SVOD rights to past seasons of seven Disney Channel, Disney Junior and Disney XD series, and more than 20 Disney Channel original movies.\n\nOn September 18, 2016, all content from The CW was removed from Hulu, as The CW's own website and apps became the exclusive portals for streaming their shows during the current season, with Netflix becoming the exclusive streaming provider for The CW shows post-current season. , a limited amount of content from CBS's library is available on-demand, mostly limited to shows that are no longer producing new episodes. On January 4, 2017, it was reported that a deal was reached to bring live broadcasts of CBS and several affiliated channels to Hulu's upcoming live streaming service as well as to make more shows available on-demand.\n\nIn April 2018, Hulu announced a partnership with Spotify that allows users to purchase both streaming services for a discounted price per month.\n\nAt an industry conference held on October 21, 2009, News Corporation Deputy Chairman Chase Carey stated that Hulu \"needs to evolve to have a meaningful subscription model as part of its business\" and that it would likely start charging for at least some content by 2010. Carey's comment jibes with other News Corp. heads, including Rupert Murdoch who has expressed a desire to charge for content with a number of online units.\n\nThe Hulu monthly subscription service called Hulu Plus was launched in beta (preview) on June 29, 2010 and officially launched on November 17, 2010. Like the free version of Hulu, the content available with a Hulu subscription also contains advertising. However, it offers an expanded content library including full seasons, day-after access to current season content and more episodes of shows available through the free Hulu. A Hulu subscription also provides a wider array of viewing choices. The free-access to Hulu was only available on PCs and laptops, while a Hulu subscription allows viewers to access Hulu through all Hulu-supported devices including set-top boxes, smart TVs, gaming consoles, mobile devices and more. A little more than a year after the launch of the Hulu subscription service, the number of paying subscribers reached 1.5 million. In May 2016, Hulu reported it had reached 12 million subscribers. As of the end of 2017, Hulu reported it had reached 17 million subscribers.\n\nOn April 29, 2015, Hulu announced to the press that they would do away with the \"Plus\" brand name to reduce confusion between the paid and free plans.\n\nThe \"Wall Street Journal\" reported in July 2015 that Hulu was exploring an advertising-free subscription option for around $12 to $14 a month. This was confirmed as going forward , with a \"No Commercials\" plan priced at $11.99, $4 more than the $7.99 monthly rate for a \"Limited Commercials\" subscription, though a few highlight network series (less than 10) would retain pre-roll and post-roll ad pods.\n\nOn August 8, 2016, Hulu announced that it would end the availability of its free streaming service through its own platform, making it oriented exclusively to subscription services. In turn, the company announced a partnership with Yahoo! to move this free content, which consists primarily of recent episodes of ABC, Fox, and NBC series, to a new website known as Yahoo! View.\n\nIn May 2016, Hulu announced that it planned to begin offering an over-the-top IPTV service with \"live programming from broadcast and cable brands\" some time in 2017. In late 2016, co-owners 21st Century Fox and The Walt Disney Company agreed to supply their channels to the streaming service, joined by Time Warner, which previously reached an agreement with Hulu.\n\nThe service, marketed only as \"Hulu with Live TV,\" which couples the live TV offerings with Hulu's existing library of television series and films, launched in beta on May 3, 2017. The $39.99-per-month service – which provides support for Xbox One, Apple TV, Chromecast, iOS and Android devices – offers live streams of more than 50 broadcast and cable-originated channels, including feeds of the five major broadcast networks – ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and The CW – as well as cable channels owned by Hulu co-parents NBCUniversal, 21st Century Fox and The Walt Disney Company, along with CBS Corporation, Turner Broadcasting System, Scripps Networks Interactive and A+E Networks (encompassing networks such as CNN, Food Network, Disney Channel, A&E, MSNBC and ESPN), with the Showtime OTT service available as an add-on for an extra fee. Currently, live content from the major broadcast networks is limited to owned-and-operated stations and affiliates based in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Philadelphia; Hulu representatives stated that it intends to negotiate carriage agreements with independently-owned broadcasting groups to gain distribution rights to local stations from additional markets. Features include the ability to create up of six user account profiles per a single subscription (with personalized program recommendations based on a user's favorite programs and varying simultaneous streams depending on the package), personalized sports recommendations and a cloud DVR with between 50 and 200 hours of storage depending on the level of service (the lower-tier DVR does not have ad skipping functionality).\n\nHulu with Live TV hit 800K subscribers in its first year . Hulu with Live TV hit 1 million subscribers on September 16, 2018.\n\nViewership numbers for the site are tracked by measurement firms such as ComScore, Nielsen ratings, and Quantcast. In partnership with comScore, Hulu is the first digital company to receive multi-platform measurement at an individual level that includes co-viewing for living room devices. When factoring this in, Hulu's reach among adults aged 18–49 increases 50 percent.\n\nHowever, the reliability of these metrics has been drawn into question, partly due to widely divergent estimates. For example, between May and June 2010, ComScore updated its scoring methodology and its estimates for Hulu dropped from 43.5 million unique viewers to 24 million in a single month. In a comScore digital trends report in 2010, comScore's Digital Year in Review report found that Hulu was watched twice as much as viewers who watched on the websites of the five major TV networks combined.\n\nHulu in May 2018 announced it has surpassed 20 million subscribers in the United States. The tally, which puts the company about 36 million subscriptions behind Netflix, was disclosed at a media presentation at the newly-named Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York. Hulu said it has grown total engagement by more than 60%, with 78% of viewing taking place in the living room on connected TVs.\n\nHulu distributes video on its own website and syndicates its hosting to other sites, and allows users to embed Hulu clips on their websites. In addition to NBC, ABC and Fox programs and movies, Hulu carries shows from networks such as A&E, Big Ten Network, Bravo, E!, Fox Sports 2, FX, PBS, NFL Network, Oxygen, RT America, Fox Sports 1, Esquire Network, SundanceTV, Syfy, USA Network, NBCSN, and online comedy sources such as Onion News Network. Hulu retains between thirty and fifty percent of advertising revenue generated by the shows it distributes.\n\nIn November 2009, Hulu also began to establish partnerships with record labels to host music videos and concert performances on the site, including EMI in November 2009, and Warner Music Group in December 2009.\n\nIn early March 2010, Viacom announced that it was pulling two of the website's most popular shows, \"The Colbert Report\" and \"The Daily Show\", off Hulu. The programs had been airing on Hulu since late 2008. A spokesman for Viacom noted that \"in the current economic model, there is not that much in it for us to continue at this time. If they can get to the point where the monetization model is better, then we may go back.\" In February 2011, both shows were made available for streaming on Hulu again. \"The Daily Show\" was again removed from Hulu in March 2017 in order to push viewers to watch the program on Viacom and Comedy Central's apps.\n\nHulu will be the exclusive streaming home for R-rated films from Disney's Touchstone Pictures and Hollywood Pictures labels and 20th Century Fox's pre-Disney-Fox merger film library, as Disney's upcoming streaming service will not feature any R-rated films.\n\nHulu in May 2018 announced its first-ever license deal with DreamWorks Animation, becoming the exclusive streaming home for future DWA movies feature films, as well as library films. DWA had streamed exclusively through Netflix since 2013.\n\nFrom January 17, 2011 to April 24, 2014, Hulu streamed its own in-house web series \"The Morning After\", a light-hearted pop-culture news show. It was produced by Hulu in conjunction with Jace Hall's HDFilms and stars Brian Kimmet and Ginger Gonzaga. Producing the show was a first for the company, which in the past has been primarily a content distributor.\n\nOn January 16, 2012, Hulu announced that it would be airing its first original script based program, titled \"Battleground\", which premiered in February 2012. The program aired on Hulu's free web service rather than on the subscription-based Hulu Plus. \"Battleground\" is described as a documentary-style political drama.\n\nLater that same month, Hulu announced it would air \"The Fashion Fund\", a six-part reality series, and the winner of the show would receive $300,000 to start their career.\n\nTo continue with its original programming movement, Hulu announced that there would be a total of seven original programs that were planned to air on its service: \"Battleground\", \"Day in the Life\", and \"Up to Speed\" were previously mentioned; and on April 19, Hulu added four more shows to its list: \"Don't Quit Your Daydream\", \"Flow\", \"The Awesomes\", and \"We Got Next\". Some of these programs began airing in 2012, while others premiered over the next few years.\n\nOn May 21, 2012, Hulu announced it would be bringing Kevin Smith to its line-up of original programming. Smith hosts a movie discussion show titled \"Spoilers\", which began airing in mid-2012.\n\nIn March 2016, Lionsgate Premiere and Hulu jointly acquired distribution rights to the film, \"Joshy\", which was later released on August 12, 2016.\n\nOn May 4, 2016, Hulu acquired \"\", as its first documentary acquisition, as part of a planned Hulu Documentary Films collection. The film premiered theatrically on 15 September, before debuting on the streaming service on 17 September.\n\nOn July 12, 2014, it was announced that Hulu had signed a three-year deal purchasing exclusive online streaming rights to the \"South Park\" library. Through the deal, the South Park Studios website became powered by Hulu video and featured advertising. Along with this, the domain name changed from \"southparkstudios.com\" to \"southpark.cc.com\". Previously, the show had been available on the television website Netflix. The new site launch caused some technical issues, which were resolved allowing fans to watch uncensored episodes and clips. For viewers outside the US, episodes and clips still stream through the \"classic\" South Park player and nothing changed aside from the new site design. A handful of countries also have their own localized versions of South Park sites, with the old experience.\n\nIt was announced that beginning in September 2014, following the premiere of the 18th season, only 30 select episodes will be featured for free viewing at a time on the website, with new episodes being available for an entire month starting the day following their original airings. The entire series (with the exception of \"Super Best Friends\", \"200\", and \"201\") is available for viewing on the Hulu subscription service.\n\nOn May 14, 2015, AT&T struck a deal with Hulu that would give its customers access to streaming service on both regular and premium tiers. On October 22, 2016, AT&T announced a deal to buy Time Warner, who owns 10% of Hulu, for $108.7 billion. In November 2017, the U.S. Justice Department said it was moving to sue to block the AT&T-Time Warner merger. AT&T completed their merger in June 2018, winning the lawsuit from the Justice Department.\n\nAt the start of April 2014, Neon Alley, a Viz Media-owned 24/7 anime-oriented streaming service that started on October 2, 2012, streaming to both US and Canadian markets (similar to Æsir Media Group LLC and Valkyrie Media Partners LLC's Anime Network, AT&T's Crunchyroll and Aniplex of America's Aniplex Channel), discontinued its web network format and relaunched as a Free Video on Demand (FVOD) service streaming anime to the US market through its website or Internet-connected devices through Hulu. As a result, with Hulu being unable to stream to the Canadian market, Neon Alley stopped streaming to that market and restricted its service to the US market only. This leaves Anime Network, Crunchyroll, Daisuki and Aniplex Channel as the only anime-focused streaming services streaming to the Canadian market at the same time as the US market, though these four all continue today. On July 21, 2016, Tubi TV announced that they had commenced streaming of certain Viz titles in Canada.\n\nHulu is known for streaming anime titles from many distributors, including Funimation, TMS Entertainment, and Bandai Visual, in addition to Viz Media.\n\n\n\nHulu's original series \"The Handmaid's Tale\", won two awards at the 33rd annual Television Critics Association Awards for Program of the Year and Outstanding Achievement in Drama. At the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards, Hulu earned a total of 8 awards for \"The Handmaid's Tale\" and became the first streaming service to win Outstanding Drama Series. \"The Handmaid's Tale\" also received Emmys for Outstanding Directing, Outstanding Writing, Outstanding Cinematography and Outstanding Production Design. Elisabeth Moss won the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress, and Ann Dowd received the award for Outstanding Supporting Actress. At the 75th Golden Globe Awards \"The Handmaid's Tale\" took home two awards, Best TV Drama and Best Actress in a Drama TV Series (Elisabeth Moss).\n\nAt the 2016 Critics' Choice Documentary Awards, Hulu's first-released documentary, won the award for Best Music Documentary. The documentary also received Grammy Award for Best Music Film at the 2017 Grammy Awards and Best Documentary at the 16th Annual Movies for Grownups Awards. At the Creative Arts Emmys, the documentary earned two Emmys including Outstanding Sound Editing and Outstanding Sound Mixing.\n\nAt the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards, Hulu received its first Emmy Award nominations for its Original series, \"11.22.63\" and for \"Triumph's Election Special 2016\". In 2016, Hulu received its first Golden Globe nomination for its Original series, \"Casual\", for TV series, Comedy.\n\n, access to Hulu is not available internationally outside of the United States and Japan.\n\nIn July 2010, the \"Financial Times\" revealed that Hulu had been working on plans for an international launch of Hulu Plus for several months, and had identified the UK and Japan as markets where its free website and subscription model could feasibly work. Hulu chief executive Jason Kilar expressed his belief that the US model could be replicated elsewhere, saying \"We won't be satisfied until this is a global service.\" Hulu's first expansion into an international market took place with the launch of a service in Japan on September 1, 2011. On November 8th, 2018, Disney announced that after the closure of their acquisition of 21st Century Fox (which would give them majority control in Hulu), they intend on expanding Hulu to other international markets.\n\nOn February 27, 2014, Nippon Television Network Corporation (Nippon TV) acquired Hulu's Japan business. The transaction, which is subject to certain regulatory conditions, marked Nippon TV's entry into the SVOD (Subscription Video On Demand) business. Through the acquisition, the Hulu service continues to offer Japanese consumers premium content, including Hollywood and Japanese films and dramas and popular television programming. Additionally, Nippon TV's popular shows and original exclusive content launched on the Hulu service in Japan, expanding its content offering. Japanese users have access to a library of popular television shows such as the CSI franchise, \"Grey's Anatomy\", \"Prison Break\", and \"Ugly Betty\", and as well as movies such as \"Armageddon\", \"Men in Black\", and \"Pirates of the Caribbean\".\n\nHulu is unable to launch in Canada due to the relatively small size of Canada's online advertising market and because Canada's television networks already have the exclusive online streaming rights in Canada to several titles offered on Hulu, including many mainstream American television network programs. The absence of Hulu in the Canadian market raised concerns by fans of the sitcom \"The Mindy Project\" when it was cancelled by Fox in the spring of 2015 and subsequently picked up by Hulu; the show's Canadian broadcaster, City, subsequently announced it would continue to air the series in Canada. At present, Canadian consumers have access to several other streaming systems, including a Canadian version of Netflix, Amazon Video and Crave, with Crave streaming some programming from Hulu.\n\n\n"}

The system of justice itself is always a major part of these works, at times almost functioning as one of the characters. In this way, the legal system provides the framework for the legal thriller much as the system of modern police work does for the police procedural.\n\nUsually, crusading lawyers become involved in proving their cases (usually their client's innocence of the crime of which he is accused, or the culpability of a corrupt corporation which has covered up its malfeasance until this point) to such an extent that they imperil their own interpersonal relationships and frequently, their own lives.\n\nMajor authors of this genre include William Bernhardt, Michael Connelly, William J Coughlin, Marcia Clark, Vish Dhamija, Robert Dugoni, Kenneth G. Eade, Linda Fairstein, Erle Stanley Gardner, Mark Gimenez, James Grippando, John Grisham, David Kessler, Lowell B.

{"id": "177309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=177309", "title": "Lighting designer", "text": "Lighting designer\n\nA theatre lighting designer (or LD) works with the director, choreographer, set designer, costume designer, and sound designer to create the lighting, atmosphere, and time of day for the production in response to the text, while keeping in mind issues of visibility, safety, and cost. The LD also works closely with the stage manager or show control programming, if show control systems are used in that production. Outside stage lighting, the job of a Lighting Designer can be much more diverse and they can be found working on rock and pop tours, corporate launches, art installation and on massive celebration spectaculars, for example the Olympic Games opening and closing ceremonies.\n\nThe role of the lighting designer varies greatly within professional and amateur theater. For a Broadway show, a touring production and most regional and small productions the LD is usually an outside freelance specialist hired early in the production process. Smaller theatre companies may have a resident lighting designer responsible for most of the company's productions or rely on a variety of freelance or even volunteer help to light their productions. At the Off-Broadway or Off-Off-Broadway level, the LD will occasionally be responsible for much of the hands-on technical work (hanging instruments, programming the light board, etc.) that would be the work of the lighting crew in a larger theater.\n\nThe LD will read the script carefully and make notes on changes in place and time between scenes - such changes are often done just with lighting to avoid too many blackouts in one scene - and will have meetings (called design or production meetings) with the director, designers, stage manager, and production manager to discuss ideas for the show and establish budget and scheduling details. The LD will also attend several later rehearsals to observe the way the actors are being directed to use the stage area ('blocking') during different scenes, and will receive updates from the stage manager on any changes that occur. The LD will also make sure that he or she has an accurate plan of the theatre's lighting positions and a list of their equipment, as well as an accurate copy of the set design, especially the ground plan and section. The LD must take into account the show's mood and the director's vision in creating a lighting design.\n\nBecause lighting design is much more abstract than costume or scenic design, it is sometimes difficult for the lighting designer to accurately convey his or her ideas to the rest of the production team. To help the LD communicate the ethereal aspects of lighting, he or she may employ renderings, storyboards, photographs, reproductions of artwork, or mockups of actual lighting effects to help communicate ideas about how the lighting should look. Various forms of paperwork are essential for the LD to successfully communicate their design to various members of the production team. Examples of typical paperwork include cue sheets, lightplots, instrument schedules, shop orders and focus charts. Cue sheets communicate the placement of cues that the LD has created for the show, using artistic terminology rather than technical language, and information on exactly when each cue is called, so that the stage manager and the assistants know when and where to call the cue. Cue sheets are of the most value to stage management.\n\nThe light plot is a scale drawing that communicates the location of lighting fixtures and lighting positions so a team of electricians can independently install the lighting system. Next to each instrument on the plan will be information for any color gel, gobo, or other accessory that needs to go with it, and its channel number. Often, paperwork listing all of this information is also generated by using a program such as Lightwright. The lighting designer uses this paperwork to aid in the visualization of not only ideas but simple lists to assist the Master Electrician during load-in, focus and technical rehearsals. Professional LDs generally use special computer-aided design packages to create accurate and easily readable drafted plots that can be swiftly updated as necessary. The LD will discuss the plot with the show's production manager and the theatre's master electrician or technical director to make sure there are no unforeseen problems during load-in.\n\nThe lighting designer is responsible, in conjunction with the production's independently hired \"Production Electrician\" who will interface with the theatre's Master Electrician, for directing the theatre's electrics crew in the realization of his or her designs during the technical rehearsals. After the Electricians have hung, circuited and patched the lighting units, the LD will direct the focusing (pointing, shaping and sizing of the light beams) and gelling (coloring) of each unit.\n\nAfter focus has occurred the LD usually sits at a temporary desk (tech table) in the theater (typically on the Center Line in the middle of the house) where he or she has a good view of the stage and work with the lighting board operator/programmer, who will either be seated alongside him or her at a portable control console or talk via headset to the control room. At the tech table, the LD will generally use a Magic Sheet, which is a pictorial layout of how the lights relate to the stage, so he or she can have quick access to channel numbers that control particular lighting instruments. The LD may also have a copy of the light plot and channel hookup, a remote lighting console, a computer monitor connected to the light board (so they can see what the board op is doing), and a headset, though in smaller theatres this is less common. There may be a period of time allowed for pre-lighting or \"pre-cueing\", a practice that is often done with people known as Light Walkers who stand in for performers so the LD can see what the light looks like on bodies. At an arranged time, the performers arrive and the production is worked through in chronological order, with occasional stops to correct sound, lighting, entrances etc.; known as a \"cue-to-cue\" or tech rehearsal. The lighting designer will work constantly with the board operator to refine the lighting states as the technical rehearsal continues, but because the focus of a \"tech\" rehearsal is the production's technical aspects, the LD may require the performers to pause (\"hold\") frequently. Nevertheless, any errors of focusing or changes to the lighting plan are corrected only when the performers are not onstage. These changes take place during 'work' or 'note' calls. The LD only attends these notes calls if units are hung or rehung and require additional focusing. The LD or Assistant Lighting Director (also known as the ALD, see below for description) will be in charge if in attendance. If the only work to be done is maintenance (i.e. changing a lamp or burnt out gel) then the Production or Master Electrician will be in charge and will direct the Electrics crew.\n\nAfter the tech process, the performance may (or may not, depending on time constraints) go into Dress rehearsal without a ticketed audience and/or Previews with a ticketed audience. During this time, if the cueing is finished, the LD will sit in the audience and take notes on what works and what needs changing. At this point, the Stage Manager will begin to take over the work of calling cues for the light board op to follow. Generally, the LD will stay on headset, and may still have a monitor connected to the light board in case of problems, or will be in the control booth with the board operator when a monitor is not available. Often, changes will take place during notes call, but if serious problems occur the performance may be halted and the issue will be resolved then.\n\nOnce the show is open to the public, the lighting designer will often stay and watch several performances of the show, making notes each night and making desired changes the next day during notes call. If the show is still in previews, then the LD will make changes, but once the production officially opens, normally the lighting designer will not make further changes.\n\nChanges should not be made after the lighting design is finished, and never without the LD's approval. There may be times when changes are necessary after the production has officially opened. Reasons for changes after opening night include: casting changes; significant changes in blocking; addition, deletion or rearrangement of scenes; or the tech and/or preview period (if there was a preview period) was too short to accommodate as thorough a cueing as was needed (this is particularly common in dance productions). If significant changes need to be made, the LD will come in and make them, however if only smaller changes are needed, the LD may opt to send the ALD. If a show runs for a particularly long time then the LD may come in periodically to check the focus of each lighting instrument and if they are retaining their color (some gel, especially saturated gel, loses its richness and can fade or 'burn out' over time). The LD may also sit in on a performance to make sure that the cues are still being called at the right place and time. The goal is often to finish by the opening of the show, but what is most important is that the LD and the directors believe that the design is finished to each's satisfaction. If that happens to be by opening night, then after opening no changes are normally made to that particular production run at that venue. The general maintenance of the lighting rig then becomes the responsibility of the Master Electrician.\n\nIt is uncommon for a small theatre to have a very large technical crew, as there is less work to do. Many times, the lighting crew of a small theatre will consist of a single lighting designer and one to three people, who collectively are in charge of hanging, focusing and patching all lighting instruments. The lighting designer, in this situation, commonly works directly with this small team, fulfilling the role of both master electrician and lighting designer. Many times the designer will directly participate in the focusing of lights. The same crew will generally also program cues and operate the light board during rehearsals and performances. In some cases, the light board and sound board are operated by the same person, depending on the complexity of the show. The lighting designer may also take on other roles in addition to lights when they are finished hanging lights and programming cues on the board.\n\nAs previously mentioned, it is difficult to fully communicate the intent of a lighting design before all the lights are installed and all the cues are written. With the advancement in computer processing and visualization software, lighting designers are now able to create computer generated images (CGI) that represent their ideas. The lighting designer enters the light plot into the visualization software and then enters the ground plan of the theater and set design, giving as much three-dimensional data as possible (which helps in creating complete renderings). This creates a 3D model in computer space that can be lit and manipulated. Using the software, the LD can use the lights from his plot to create actual lighting in the 3D model with the ability to define parameters such as color, focus, gobo, beam angle etc. The designer can then take renderings or \"snapshots\" of various looks that can then be printed out and shown to the director and other members of the design team.\n\nIn addition to computer visualization, either full scale or small scale mock ups are a good method for depicting a lighting designer's ideas. Fiber optic systems such as LightBox or Luxam allow a users to light a scale model of the set. For example, a set designer can create a model of the set in 1/4\" scale, the lighting designer can then take the fiber optic cables and attach them to scaled down lighting units that can accurately replicate the beam angles of specified lighting fixtures. These 'mini lights' can then be attached to cross pieces simulating different lighting positions. Fiber optic fixtures have the capacity to simulate attributes of full scale theatrical lighting fixtures including; color, beam angle, intensity, and gobos. The most sophisticated fiber optic systems are controllable through computer software or a DMX controlled Light board. This gives the lighting designer the ability to mock up real time lighting effects as they will look during the show.\n\nIf the production is large or especially complex, the Lighting Designer may hire additional lighting professionals to help execute the design.\n\nThe Associate Lighting Designer will help assist the Lighting Designer in creating and executing the lighting design. While the duties that an LD may expect the Associate LD to perform may differ from person to person, usually the Ass't LD will do the following:\n\nThe Assistant Lighting Designer assists the Lighting Designer and the Associate Lighting Designer. Depending on the particular arrangement the ALD may report directly to the LD, or they may in essence be the Associate's assistant. There also may be more than one assistant on a show depending on the size of the production. The ALD will usually:\n\nDuring focus, the LD is up on stage directing members of the Electrics crew on where and how to focus each individual lighting unit. This can be a time consuming and frustrating process. Focus can run much smoother if the Associate LD and the Assistant LD are keeping good track of which lights have been focused, what's coming up next and directing the electrics crew so that there is minimal down time between focusing each light. They should also direct the LD to which units are next and even what their purpose is and a rough focus.\n\n\n\n"}

As such, metanoia is similar to correction. Metanoia is used in recalling a statement in two ways—-to weaken the prior declaration or to strengthen it.\n\nMetanoia is later personified as a figure accompanying kairos, sometimes as a hag and sometimes as a young lady. Ausonius' epigrams describe her thus: \"I am a goddess to whom even Cicero himself did not give a name. I am the goddess who exacts punishment for what has and has not been done, so that people regret it. Hence my name is Metanoea.\" \n\nThe use of metanoia to weaken a statement is effective because the original statement still stands, along with the qualifying statement. For instance, when one says, \"I will murder you. You shall be punished,\" the force of the original statement (\"I will murder you\") remains, while a more realistic alternative has been put forward (\"you shall be punished\").\n\nWhen it is used to strengthen a statement, metanoia works to ease the reader from a moderate statement to a more radical one, as in this quote from Marcus Aurelius's \"Meditations\"\nI still fall short of it through my own fault, and through not observing\nthe admonitions of the gods, and, I may almost say, their direct instructions (Book One);\nHere Aurelius utilizes metanoia to move from a mild idea (\"not observing the admonitions of the gods\") to a more intense one (\"not observing... their direct instructions\"); the clause \"I may almost say\" introduces the metanoia.\n\n"}
{"id": "21697763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21697763", "title": "Nasdijj", "text": "Nasdijj\n\nTimothy Patrick Barrus, also known as Tim Barrus (born 1950), is an American author and social worker who is best known for having published three \"memoirs\" between 2000 and 2004 under the pseudonym Nasdijj, by which he presented himself as a Navajo. The books were critically acclaimed, and Nasdijj received several literary awards and recognition from major institutions. His \"memoirs,\" which dealt in part with issues of two adopted children who suffered from severe problems, were also acclaimed by Child Rights and HIV/AIDS activists advocating for greater awareness of American children living at acute risk.\n\nIn 2006 journalists revealed that Barrus had published the Nasdijj books under a fictional identity, and that the events depicted in all three were largely fiction. In the United States publishing world, Barrus' work is cited as an example of memoirs released under misleading pretenses. The deception was revealed in the same period as two other literary scandals. Controversy arose over the portrayal of fictional accounts as memoirs, as well as authors presenting false personas. Native Americans strongly criticized Barrus for appropriating the historic suffering of their people. They criticized the publishing world for so readily accepting impostors.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s Barrus had published numerous articles and several novels. He is credited by Jack Fritscher with coining the term \"Leather Lit.\"\n\nTim Barrus was born and grew up in Lansing, Michigan, where he attended public schools. His parents were European American: his father Maynard Barrus worked as a foreman at the power plant. His mother Jean Anne Steginga was of Scandinavian descent. He has a younger sister Suzanne.\n\nMarrying at a young age, Barrus took a variety of jobs and lived in different regions of the country in his early years. He attended community college in Largo, Florida and started writing in the early 1970s, although he did not publish anything for years.\n\nAt the age of 19, Barrus married Jan Abbott, from a nearby town. Together they have a daughter named Kree, born in 1974. In 1975 they adopted Tommy, a boy who Barrus said had severe developmental problems. After two years, they turned him back to the state, finding they were unable to care for him adequately. Barrus and Jan later separated and divorced. He moved to San Francisco and later Key West.\n\nBarrus remarried in 1993 in San Francisco, to a special education teacher named Tina Giovanni. She has worked with autistic children for 20 years.\n\nBarrus was a \"provocative associate editor\" of \"Drummer Magazine\" for five issues (#117-122). An editorial by the publishers on his departure explained that they were impressed with the work that he had done, and regretted that \"Justice Department persecution of publishers of erotica\" had caused him to terminate the relationship. Jack Fritscher (editor in chief) described Barrus as \"one of the best editors\" the magazine had in the 1980s. Barrus subsequently worked as an editor at Knights Press, creating the LeatherLit Writers Series.\n\nBy his account in later interviews, Barrus moved into social work, serving \"special-needs children in Florida, Apache kids in New Mexico, disabled adults in Michigan,\" and autistic children in San Francisco. In 1996, he and his wife Tina moved from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida to a Bureau of Indian Affairs School at Mariano Lake, New Mexico.\n\nThis period inspired his persona as Nasdijj. He has said this Navajo word means \"to become again,\" according to an 1890s text. Irvin Morris, a full-blood Navajo and professor of literature and Navajo studies at Dine College, in 2006 said there was no such word in the language.\n\nBarrus began publishing articles in the late 1970s, primarily for the gay leather magazing \"Drummer.\" After his move to Key West in 1984, he also wrote for \"The Weekly News,\" a local gay newspaper.\n\nFrom 1985 to 1992, he published five novels, all dealing with homosexuality in different genres. While some were favorably reviewed, he never broke into mainstream acceptance. His novel \"Genocide\" was recognized as an early contribution to AIDS literature, described by critic Toby Johnson as \"dark and pessimistic\".\n\nIn connection with \"Anywhere, Anywhere\", a novel about Americans in Vietnam during the war, Barrus said that he had been a Vietnam veteran. This account was disputed by people who knew him. He also published numerous articles, reviews and other short pieces.\n\nIn 1999, Barrus submitted an unsolicited manuscript to \"Esquire\" magazine under the byline Nasdijj; he noted to them that the magazine had never published a work by a Native American author. \"Nasdijj\" wrote that his essay was about the death of his adopted son from fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), and that he also had it. His essay, \"The Blood Runs Like a River Through My Dreams\", was published in \"Esquire\" in 1999 and was a finalist in the National Magazine Awards that year.\n\nThe following year Nasdijj published this and other non-fiction essays collected as a book under the same name. Receiving widespread notice and praise, the collection was selected as a \"Notable Book of the Year\" by \"The New York Times\", and sold 27,000 copies. Nasdijj's work received critical acclaim, and his first book was a finalist for the PEN/Martha Albrand Award and winner of the Salon Book Award.\n\nIn a 2002 PEN Forum, in which authors were asked to describe \"literary lineage\", Nasdijj responded,\n\nAs Nasdijj, Barrus received widespread recognition as a writer on the Native American experience. His work was described as a compelling combination of poetry and prose. His second Navajo memoir, \"The Boy and the Dog Are Sleeping\" (2003), won the 2004 PEN American Center's PEN/Beyond Margins Award. In the specialist Native American journal, \"Studies in American Indian Literatures (SAIL)\", Marijo Moore wrote,\n\nInterested in \"The Boy\" for its portrayal of fatherhood, in 2004 James Dowaliby, a former vice president for Paramount International Television Group, acquired the film rights from Nasdijj. By the end of 2004, he had approval from FilmFour of the United Kingdom to develop a feature-length adaptation. During the process, he began to suspect the book was fraudulent when an adviser identified numerous errors, including the portrayal of Navajo clans and kinship system.\n\nBarrus published the following books under the name Nasdijj: \n\nPublished as non-fiction, each memoir recounted purported aspects of the author's life. The memoirs referred to his Navajo heritage, his self-destructive and abusive parents (a white father and Navajo mother), his unhappy childhood as a migrant worker, his dysfunctional relationships with other family members, and his growing up to become a nurturing father. As an adult, he adopted two children: one with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and a second who was HIV-positive. In the books, the children are unprotected; the author attacks white society for their plight.\n\nIn January 2006, the journalist Matthew Fleischer published \"Navahoax\", an article in the \"LA Weekly,\" documenting Nasdijj as an ethnic European American named Timothy Patrick \"Tim\" Barrus. Fleischer provided details about Barrus' parents, marriages and other writings. The article noted that Barrus was known as the author of fiction relating to gay sado-masochism. Feischer said that suspicions about Nasdijj had arisen with publication of his first book; Sherman Alexie, a respected author of the Spokane tribe, said that he had complained to Anton Mueller, Nasdijj's editor, that the author had plagiarized him and other Native Americans. Alexie also wrote to Houghton Mifflin, which published the first book but then dropped Nasdijj as an author. Dowaliby dropped his film project because of his belief that the work was false.\n\nExtensive media coverage followed the article's publication. A former literary agent for Nasdijj, while not confirming the \"LA Weekly\" article, called it \"well researched and highly persuasive.\" \"News & Observer\", a North Carolina newspaper that had published some of Nasdijj's work, confirmed that it had on file a social security number that matched that of Tim Barrus. \"Esquire\" magazine revealed that it had paid for a 1999 Nasdijj article with a check made out to \"Tim Nasdijj Barrus\".\n\nIn \"Nasdijj Shops Tell-All\", Fleischer noted these developments. He quoted an e-mail from Nasdijj to an editor at Penguin Books, in which the author offered a novel called \"Year of the Hyena: The Story of Nasdijj\". The article presented excerpts from Nasdijj's blog with the headline, \"Deserving Death for Evil Deeds, by Tim Barrus\". It quoted, \"What you want to believe you want to believe. If I am the devil incarnate then I am the devil incarnate.\" Subsequently, the host TypePad deleted Nasdijj's blog.\n\nSherman Alexie (Spokane-Coeur d'Alene), commented publicly on the controversy. In an article published in the February 6, 2006 issue of \"Time magazine\", Alexie wrote,\n\nHe had become suspicious of Nasdijj, finding that the author appeared to borrow from his and other Native American writings. Asked by Alexie to review the books by Nasdijj, Morris found numerous errors that led him to believe the author was an impostor. He did not pursue the matter; as he said,\n\nThe author and critic David Treuer (Ojibwe) described Barrus' actions as \"harmful cultural fraud.\" The activist Suzan Shown Harjo (Muscogee Creek and Cheyenne) questioned why the publishing world was taken in by Native American impostors. She said, \"There should be a law for the Navajo Nation to sue Barrus for the profits he made while committing the crime of stealing tribal identity.\" (She has also been critical of Ward Churchill, who as a professor of ethnic studies claimed to be Native American and acts as a spokesman. Harjo and others have documented that he has no record of Native American ancestry.)\n\nBarrus' hoax gained attention for occurring at the same time as other literary scandals: the writer James Frey was found to have made up portions of works published as memoirs, and the purported author JT LeRoy was revealed as a deception created by three people: a woman who performed as the young man in public appearances, and a woman and man who wrote \"his\" published works.

These demons can be summoned during battle through the use of SP, and are categorised into attacker and support types. As they become stronger through subsequent battles, they gain new abilities. The player accepts quests and performs customisations at the Hotel, when not taking orders to progress the story or battling enemies.\n\nArnice can also land attack chains using light, heavy and special attacks, with each chain gradually filling a transformation gauge. When full, the player can trigger a transformation which increases offensive power. Her demon form allows her to control flames, while her rabbit form focuses on speed and melee combat, and her phantom form improves her recovery capabilities. She is also able to transform her blood into different types of blood power weapons depending on the situation, such as daggers and longswords, which change her attack moveset and the abilities of summoned demons.\n\nThe game also contains an optional arena where players can take on various challenges and earn rewards, and these include battles with special restrictions placed upon them and fighting against enemies within a labyrinth.\n\nThe game follows the journey of two girls within an uncharted land known as Rusewall Island, where no one sleeps at night. After humans emerged victorious from the battle against the Ruler of the Night, the blue blood from the monster scattered and polluted those who bathed in it, changing them into creatures known as Jayou which steal night-time from the people.\n\n\nThe game was developed under the leadership of development producer Keisuke Kikuchi who has previously worked on the \"Deception\" and \"Fatal Frame\" game series, while the general producer was Tadanobu Inoue.

Sea Monkeys are scientifically classified as \"Artemia\" NYOS, while brine shrimp are classified as \"Artemia salina\". Sea Monkeys are sold in hatching kits as novelty aquarium pets. Developed in the United States in 1957, at this point being just part of the \"Artemia salina\" species, by Harold von Braunhut, the product was heavily marketed, especially in comic books, and remains a presence in popular culture.\n\nAnt farms had been popularized in 1956 by Milton Levine. Harold von Braunhut invented a brine-shrimp-based product the next year, 1957. Von Braunhut collaborated with marine biologist Dr. Anthony D'Agostino to develop the proper mix of nutrients and chemicals in dry form that could be added to plain tap water to create an accommodating habitat for the shrimp to thrive. Von Braunhut was granted a patent for this process on July 4, 1972.\n\nThey were initially called \"Instant Life\" and sold for $0.49, but von Braunhut changed the name to \"Sea-Monkeys\" in 1962. The new name was based on the supposed resemblance of the animals' tails to those of monkeys, and their salt-water habitat.\n\nSea-Monkeys were intensely marketed in comic books throughout the 1960s and early 1970s using illustrations by the comic-book illustrator Joe Orlando. These showed humanoid animals that bear no resemblance to the crustaceans. Many purchasers were disappointed by the dissimilarity and by the short lifespan of the animals. Von Braunhut is quoted as stating: \"I think I bought something like 3.2 million pages of comic book advertising a year. It worked beautifully.\"\n\nA colony is started by adding the contents of a packet labelled \"Water Purifier\" to a tank of water. This packet contains salt, water conditioner, and some brine shrimp eggs. After 24 hours, this is augmented with the contents of a packet labelled \"Instant Life Eggs\", containing more eggs, yeast, borax, soda, salt, some food and sometimes a dye. Shortly thereafter, Sea-Monkeys hatch from the eggs that were in the \"Water Purifier\" packet. \"Growth Food\" containing yeast and spirulina is then added every few days. The best temperature for hatching is \n\nThe animals sold as Sea-Monkeys are an artificial breed known as \"Artemia NYOS\" (New York Ocean Science), formed by hybridising different species of \"Artemia\". They live longer and grow bigger than ordinary brine shrimp. They undergo cryptobiosis or anhydrobiosis, a condition of apparent lifelessness which allows them to survive the desiccation of the temporary pools in which they live.\n\nAstronaut John Glenn took Sea-Monkeys into space on October 29, 1998, aboard Space Shuttle \"Discovery\" during mission STS-95. After nine days in space, they were returned to Earth, and hatched eight weeks later apparently unaffected by their travels.\nHowever, earlier experiments on \"Apollo 16\" and \"Apollo 17\", where the eggs (along with other biological systems in a state of rest, such as spores, seeds and cysts) traveled to the Moon and back and were exposed to significant cosmic rays, observed \na high sensitivity to cosmic radiation in the \"Artemia salina\" eggs; only 10% of the embryos which were induced to develop from eggs survived to adulthood. The most common mutations found during the developmental stages of the radiated eggs were deformations of the abdomen or deformations on the swimming appendages and naupliar eye of the nauplius.\n\n"}

With the success of his magazine, the character was adapted for cartoons and multimedia in the following years.\n\n\nThe first edition of the Sesinho comic was published in 1947, one year after the creation of SESI. The magazine served as a method to alleviate the sorrow caused earlier in World War II. Shows children's comics of adventure designed by several Brazilian cartoonists. It became quite popular and was sold until 1960, before slowly declining in popularity. In total, there were 154 magazines published.\nThe character was reintroduced in 2001, this time with a redesign and new characters, when SESI once again began publishing the magazine. Unlike the first version that was sold, this version was freely distributed by business schools. It was so successful that it became popular outside the schools as well. SESI also began producing a series of animated shorts to be displayed on educational channels such as Futura and TV Cultura. The modern magazines have an educational focus, with about half of the pages devoted to a story, and the rest to educational games.

Neelix is surprised that Tomin is quick to break the strict regime set by his people to sample everything from food to entertainment that \"Voyager\" has to offer. The crew finds that Tomin's physiology is unable to handle the synthahol used in drinks and becomes highly intoxicated on the night prior to the return of his elder, on the night a shipwide reception is due to take place for him.

Later it spread to Santiago where the colonial capital was located and Sal.\n\nKite surfing, windsurfing has recently increased in use and popularity in Cape Verde today.\n\nFootball is the most popular sport in Cape Verde and has been for many years. Today it is one of the few countries that does not use the common division system (e.g. the Gambia, another small country uses the national division system and has the Premier and Second Divisions), another small country smaller in size is São Tomé and Príncipe who uses the same system as Cape Verde, but the system which Cape Verde used up to the 1990s having only a national championship match, the winner of each island competes in the national championships, sometimes when an island winner also won the championship as they won a national title in the previous season, a second place club competes, the national winner competes in the following season. The first edition was held in 1953 and was the Colonial Championships held up to 1974 as Cape Verde was under Portuguese rule. After Cape Verde became independent in 1975, it held its first edition in 1976, three championship competitions were cancelled, the first was difficulty of finding a winner from Sotavento, that year, other islands competed in the national championships. Mindelense also has the most number of national titles numbering 12.\n\nThe first regional championship was São Vicente, its first edition was held in 1938. Mindelense won the most number of titles numbering 48, the highest of any of the regional championships in the world. The Santiago Island League is the second oldest and since 2001 and formally since 2003, broken up into two zones. There are 11 championships in 9 islands, two are in the North and South Zones. Cape Verde has over 100 football clubs. Youth championships are held in most islands.\n\nThe nation also has the cup, the super cup and the opening tournament in each region, the Santiago North Zone does not have these competitions. The Cape Verdean Cup held its first edition in 2007, it was held four times up to 2012, afterwards it was cancelled. The winner of the cup from each island competed. Maio competed twice and Brava competed once. Santiago North never competed. There are 11 cup competitions, Santiago North does not have any, Santo Antão has both the North and South Zones and since 2016, the regional level.\n\nThe Cape Verdean Super Cup took place in 2013 with its first edition, the champion featured a cup winner, Sporting Praia win their only title, a year later the champion faced a super cup winner from the previous year, Mindelense won their only title in the recent edition in 2014.\n\nThe first club to compete at the African level was Sporting Praia in 1993, years after Cape Verde became a CAF member. A total of five clubs participated including Sporting Praia, Mindelense, FC Derby, Boavista Praia and Travadores, only one club SC Atlético was disqualified in 1992 due to that the football federation did not name the entrant on time.\n\nMindelense is the oldest football club in Cape Verde.

Other related sports such as kite and wind surfing are common in Cape Verde. It was introduced at the time of independence and was mainly dominant in the island of São Vicente. After the end of the 20th century, this type of sports was gaining in other islands notably Sal and Boa Vista which has a lot of sands and dunes with its desert-type landscape. Much of them were tourists. Its popularity was gaining in recent years in the two eastern islands mostly by tourists. It made Sal and Boa Vista the commonplace of kite and wind surfing in the country and does into the present day.\n\nOther sports used in the country are tennis and cricket. Tennis is gaining in popularity and players in recent years. The most notable complex in the country are in Praia's Várzea in the west and another in Mindelo.

{"id": "2838581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2838581", "title": "Sunday comics", "text": "Sunday comics\n\nThe Sunday comics or Sunday strip is the comic strip section carried in most western newspapers, almost always in color. Many newspaper readers called this section the Sunday funnies, the funny papers or simply the funnies.\n\nThe first US newspaper comic strips appeared in the late 19th century, closely allied with the invention of the color press. Jimmy Swinnerton's \"The Little Bears\" introduced sequential art and recurring characters in William Randolph Hearst's \"San Francisco Examiner\". In the United States, the popularity of color comic strips sprang from the newspaper war between Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer. Some newspapers, such as \"Grit\", published Sunday strips in black-and-white, and some (mostly in Canada) print their Sunday strips on Saturday.\n\nSubject matter and genres have ranged from adventure, detective and humor strips to dramatic strips with soap opera situations, such as \"Mary Worth\". A continuity strip employs a narrative in an ongoing storyline. Other strips offer a gag complete in a single episode, such as \"Little Iodine\" and \"Mutt and Jeff\". The Sunday strip is contrasted with the daily comic strip, published Monday through Saturday, usually in black and white. Many comic strips appear both daily and Sunday, in some cases, as with \"Little Orphan Annie\", telling the same story daily and Sunday, in other cases, as with \"The Phantom\", telling one story in the daily and a different story in the Sunday. Some strips, such as \"Prince Valiant\" appear only on Sunday. Others, such as \"Rip Kirby\", are daily only and have never appeared on Sunday. In some cases, such as \"Buz Sawyer\", the Sunday strip is a spin-off, focusing on different characters than the daily.\n\nFamous full-page Sunday strips include \"Alley Oop\", \"Barney Google and Snuffy Smith\", \"Blondie\", \"Bringing Up Father\", \"Buck Rogers\", \"Captain Easy\", \"Flash Gordon\", and \"Thimble Theatre\". Such classics have found a new home in book collections of recent years. On the other hand, numerous strips such as Bob Gustafson's \"Specs\" and Virgil Partch's \"The Captain's Gig\" are almost completely forgotten today, other than a brief display in the Stripper's Guide site run by comics historian Allan Holtz.\n\nMany of the leading cartoonists also drew an accompanying topper strip to run above or below their main strip, a practice which began to fade away during the late 1930s. Holtz notes, \"You'll hear historians say that the topper strip was a victim of World War II paper shortages. Don't believe a word of it—it's the ads that killed full-page strips, and that killed the topper. World War II only exacerbated an already bad situation.\"\n\nAfter the publisher of the \"Chicago Inter-Ocean\" saw the first color press in Paris at the offices of \"Le Petit Journal\", he had his own color press operating late in 1892. At the \"New York Recorder\", manager George Turner had R. Hoe & Co. design a color press, and the \"Recorder\" published the first American newspaper color page on April 2, 1893. The following month, Pulitzer's \"New York World\" printed cartoonist Walt McDougall's \"The Possibilities of the Broadway Cable Car\" as a color page on May 21, 1893. In 1894, Pulitzer introduced the Sunday color supplement.\n\n\"The Yellow Kid\" is usually credited as one of the first US newspaper comic strips. However, the artform combining words and pictures evolved gradually, and there are many examples of proto-comic strips. In 1995, King Features Syndicate president Joseph F. D'Angelo wrote:\n\nIn 1905, Winsor McCay's \"Little Nemo in Slumberland\" began. Stephen Becker, in \"Comic Art in America\", noted that \"Little Nemo in Slumberland\" was \"probably the first strip to exploit color for purely aesthetic purposes; it was the first in which the dialogue, occasionally polysyllabic, flirted with adult irony.\n\nBy 1906, the weekly Sunday comics supplement was commonplace, with a half-dozen competitive syndicates circulating strips to newspapers in every major American city. In 1923, \"The Commercial Appeal\" in Memphis, Tennessee, became among the first in the nation to acquire its own radio station, and it was the first Southern newspaper to publish a Sunday comic section.\n\nFor most of the 20th century, the Sunday funnies were a family tradition, enjoyed each weekend by adults and kids alike. They were read by millions and produced famous fictional characters in such strips as \"Flash Gordon\", \"Little Orphan Annie\", \"Prince Valiant\", \"Dick Tracy\" and \"Terry and the Pirates\". Leading the lists of classic humor strips are \"Bringing Up Father\", \"Gasoline Alley\", \"Li'l Abner\", \"Pogo\", \"Peanuts\" and \"Smokey Stover\". Some newspapers added their own local features, such as \"Our Own Oddities\" in the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\". There were educational strips, such as King Features' \"Heroes of American History\". In addition to the comic strips, Sunday comics sections also carried advertisements in a comics format, single-panel features, puzzles, paper dolls and cut-and-paste activities. \"The World Museum\" gave readers instructions for cutting pictures apart and assembling them into a diorama, often with a subject from nature, such as \"The Grand Canyon\" or \"Buffalo Hunt\". A page on covered wagons carried the headline, \"Covered wagons shown in an easy-to-build model: Scissors, paste and wrapping paper are all you need to make this Western set.\"\n\nSome radio stations across the United States featured Sunday morning programs in which an announcer read aloud from the Sunday comics section, allowing readers to follow action in the panels as they listened to the dialogue. Most notably, on July 8, 1945, during a New York newspaper deliverers' strike, New York mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia read comic strips over the radio.\n\nEarly Sunday strips filled an entire newspaper page. Later strips, such as \"The Phantom\" and \"Terry and the Pirates\", were usually only half that size, with two strips to a page in full-size newspapers, such as the \"New Orleans Times Picayune\", or with one strip on a tabloid page, as in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\". When Sunday strips began to appear in more than one format, it became necessary for the cartoonist to follow a standardized strip layout, which provides newspapers with the greatest flexibility in determining how to print a strip.\nOne notable distinction among Sunday comics supplements was the supplement produced in a comic book-like format, featuring the character The Spirit. These sixteen-page (later eight-page) standalone Sunday supplements of Will Eisner's character (distributed by the \nRegister and Tribune Syndicate) were included with newspapers from 1940 through 1952.\nDuring World War II, because of paper shortages, the size of Sunday strips began to shrink. After the war, strips continued to get smaller and smaller, to save the expense of printing so many color pages. The last full-page comic strip was the \"Prince Valiant\" strip for 11 April 1971. The dimensions of the Sunday comics continued to decrease in recent years, as did the number of pages. Sunday comics sections that were 10 or 12 pages in 1950 dropped to six or four pages by 2005. One of the last large-size Sunday comics in the United States is in the \"Reading Eagle\", which has eight Berliner-size pages and carries 36 comics. Its banner headline is \"Biggest Comics Section in the Land\". Another big-size comic section is that of \"The Washington Post\" which carries 41 strips in eight broadsheet pages although it also contains a sudoku and a Jumble puzzle. Canadian newspaper comic sections are unique not only because of being printed on Saturdays, but these usually are also part of the entertainment or lifestyle section. A notable exception is that of the \"Winnipeg Free Press\" which publishes an eight-page comic-only tabloid section.\n\nIn some cases today, the daily strip and Sunday strip dimensions are almost the same. For instance, a daily strip in \"The Arizona Republic\" measures 4\" wide by 1\" deep, while the three-tiered \"Hägar the Horrible\" Sunday strip in the same paper is 5\" wide by 3\" deep.\n\nEarly Sunday strips usually filled a full newspaper page, but over decades they shrank in size, becoming smaller and smaller. Currently, no Sunday strips stand alone on a page, and some newspapers crowd as many as eight Sunday strips on a single page. The last full-page Sunday strip was \"Prince Valiant\", which was published as a full page in some newspapers until 1970. Shortly after the full-page \"Prince Valiant\" was discontinued, Hal Foster retired from drawing the strip, though he continued to write it for several more years. Manuscript Press published a print of his last \"Prince Valiant\" strip in full-page format; this was the last full-page comic strip, though it did not appear in that format in newspapers.\n\nDuring the 1950s, there were a few short-lived attempts to revive the full-page Sunday strip. Examples such as \"Lance\" by Warren Tufts and Frank Giacoia's \"Johnny Reb and Billy Yank\" proved artistic, though not commercial, successes.\n\nOther formats for Sunday strips include the half-page, the third of a page, the quarter page, the tabloid page or tab, and the half tab, short for half of a tabloid page. Today, with the ever-shrinking size of Sunday strips, many other smaller formats abound.\n\nUsually, only the largest format is complete, with the other formats dropping or cropping one or more panels. Such \"throwaway\" panels often contain material that is not vital to the main part of the strip. Most cartoonists fill the first two panels of their strips with a \"throwaway gag,\" knowing that the public may not see them, and making them integral to the plot would likely be wasteful. Exceptions to this rule include \"Steve Canyon\" and, until its last few years, \"On Stage\", which are complete only in the third format. Half-page Sunday strips have at least two different styles. The King Features, the Creators' and the Chicago Tribune syndicates use nine panels (with only one used for the title), while United Features and Universal Press' half-page Sunday strips (most of them use a third-page format instead) use two panels for the title (except for Jim Davis' \"U.S. Acres\"—which used the nine-panel format- during the 1980s, when most UFS strips -particularly Davis' more successful \"Garfield\"—would have a throwaway gag).\n\nCurrently, the largest and most complete format for most Sunday strips, such as \"Peanuts\", is the half page. A few strips have been popular enough for the artist to insist on the Sunday strip being run in a half-page format, though not necessarily in a half-page size. \"Calvin and Hobbes\" was the first strip to do this, followed by \"Outland\" and later \"Opus\". \"The Reading Eagle\" is one of the few newspapers that still run half-page Sunday strips.\n\nIn some cases today, the daily strip and Sunday strip dimensions are almost the same. For instance, a daily strip in \"The Arizona Republic\" measures 4\" wide by 1\" deep, while the three-tiered \"Hägar the Horrible\" Sunday strip in the same paper is 5\" wide by 3\" deep.\n\n\n\n"}

There are no props or costumes, nor any lights beyond those necessary to let the audience see the narratore: sometimes the theatre itself is lit so that the narrattore can see the faces of the audience to address them directly.\n\nThe genre generally said to have begun with \"Mistero Buffo\" (\"Comic Mystery\") by Dario Fo in 1969, though Fo has traditionally used mime to physicalize the actions and the entire cast of characters when performing in this style. This influenced two generations of narrattori, notably Marco Paolini, Marco Baliani and Laura Curino; and later Ascanio Celestini, Davide Enia and Alessandro Ghebreigziabiher.\n\nAlthough \"Mistero Buffo\" reworked medieval stories, the \"teatro di narrazione\" has a particular focus on investigating the \"dark holes\" of Italian modern history. \"Corpo di stato\" by Baliani concerns the murder of Aldo Moro by the Red Brigades in 1978; Curino's \"Olivetti\" concerns Camillo and Adriano Olivetti, founders of the Olivetti business empire; Paolini's \"Il racconto del Vajont\" the tragedy of the Vajont Dam disaster; Enia's \"Maggio '43\" the Allied bombing of Palermo during the Allied invasion of Sicily in World War II; Celestini's \"Radio Clandestina\" and \"Scemo di guerra\" the Nazi-Fascist occupation of Rome and its subsequent American liberation; and Ghebreigziabiher's \"Tramonto\" and \"Il dono della diversità\" racism and immigration problems in the society.\n\n"}
{"id": "1090739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1090739", "title": "The Dunciad", "text": "The Dunciad\n\nThe Dunciad is a landmark mock-heroic narrative poem by Alexander Pope published in three different versions at different times from 1728 to 1743. The poem celebrates a goddess Dulness and the progress of her chosen agents as they bring decay, imbecility, and tastelessness to the Kingdom of Great Britain.\n\nThe first version—the \"three book\" \"Dunciad\"—was published in 1728 anonymously. The second version, the Dunciad Variorum was published anonymously in 1729. The New Dunciad, in a new fourth book conceived as a sequel to the previous three, appeared in 1742, and The Dunciad in Four Books, a revised version of the original three books and a slightly revised version of the fourth book with revised commentary was published in 1743 with a new character, Bays, replacing theobald as the 'hero'.\n\nPope told Joseph Spence (in \"Spence's Anecdotes\") that he had been working on a general satire of Dulness, with characters of contemporary Grub Street scribblers, for some time and that it was the publication of \"Shakespeare Restored\" by Lewis Theobald that spurred him to complete the poem and publish it in 1728. Theobald's edition of Shakespeare was not, however, as imperfect as \"The Dunciad\" would suggest; it was, in fact, far superior to the edition Pope had himself written in 1725.\n\nHowever, Pope's reputation had been impugned, as the full title of Theobald's edition was \"Shakespeare restored, or, A specimen of the many errors, as well committed, as unamended, by Mr. Pope : in his late edition of this poet. Designed not only to correct the said edition, but to restore the true reading of Shakespeare in all the editions ever yet published.\" Although Theobald was certainly Pope's superior in the realm of historical editing and criticism, \"The Dunciad\" shows Pope flexing his superior creative muscles, and it succeeds to the extent that Pope's work is the chief reason Theobald is remembered.\n\nPope had written characters of the various \"Dunces\" prior to 1728. In his \"Essay on Criticism,\" Pope describes some critics of a witless nature. In his various \"Moral Epistles,\" Pope likewise constructs characters of contemporary authors of poor taste. The general structure owes its origins to the communal project of the Scriblerians and other similar works such as the mock-heroic \"MacFlecknoe\" by John Dryden and Pope's own \"The Rape of the Lock\".\n\nThe Scriblerian club most consistently comprised Jonathan Swift, John Gay, John Arbuthnot, Robert Harley, and Thomas Parnell. The group met during the spring and summer of 1714. One group project was to write a satire of contemporary abuses in learning of all sorts, in which the authors would combine their efforts to write the biography of the group's fictional founder, Martin Scriblerus, through whose writings they would accomplish their satirical aims. The resulting \"The Memoirs of Martin Scriblerus\" contained a number of parodies of the most lavish mistakes in scholarship.\n\nFor the mock-heroic structure of the \"Dunciad\" itself, however, the idea seems to have come most clearly from \"MacFlecknoe\". \"MacFlecknoe\" is a poem celebrating the apotheosis of Thomas Shadwell, whom Dryden nominates as the dullest poet of the age. Shadwell is the spiritual son of Flecknoe, an obscure Irish poet of low fame, and he takes his place as the favourite of the goddess Dulness.\n\nPope takes this idea of the personified goddess of Dulness being at war with reason, darkness at war with light, and extends it to a full \"Aeneid\" parody. His poem celebrates a war, rather than a mere victory, and a process of ignorance, and Pope picks as his champion of all things insipid Lewis Theobald (1728 and '32) and Colley Cibber (1742).\n\nJean-Pierre de Crousaz who wrote a biting commentary on Pope's \"Essay on Man\" found that Pope had \"reserved a place for him in the \"Dunciad\"\".\n\n Pope first published \"The Dunciad\" in 1728 in three books, with Lewis Theobald as its \"hero.\" The poem was not signed, and he used only initials in the text to refer to the various Dunces in the kingdom of Dulness. However, \"Keys\" immediately came out to identify the figures mentioned in the text, and an Irish pirate edition was printed that filled in the names (sometimes inaccurately). Additionally, the men attacked by Pope also wrote angry denunciations of the poem, attacking Pope's poetry and person. Pope endured attacks from, among others, George Duckett, Thomas Burnet, and Richard Blackmore. All of these, however, were less vicious than the attack launched by Edmund Curll, a notoriously unscrupulous publisher, who produced his own pirate copy of the Dunciad with astounding swiftness, and also published 'The Popiad' and a number of pamphlets attacking Pope.\n\nIn 1729, Pope published an acknowledged edition of the poem, and the \"Dunciad Variorum\" appeared in 1732. The Variorum was substantially the same text as the 1729 edition, but it now had a lengthy prolegomenon. The prefatory material has Pope speaking in his own defence, although under a variety of other names; for example, \"A Letter to the Publisher Occasioned by the Present Edition of the Dunciad\" is signed by William Cleland (d. 1741), one of Pope's friends and father of John Cleland, but it was probably written by Pope himself.\n\nIn these prefatory materials, Pope points out that the Keys were often wrong about the allusions, and he explains his reluctance at spelling out the names. He says that he wishes to avoid elevating the targets of the satire by mentioning their names (which, of course, did happen, as a number of persons are only remembered for their appearances in the poem), but he similarly did not want innocents to be mistaken for the targets. Pope also apologises for using parody of the Classics (for his poem imitates both Homer and Virgil) by pointing out that the ancients also used parody to belittle unworthy poets. Pope's preface is followed by advertisements from the bookseller, a section called \"Testimonies of Authors Concerning Our Poet and his Works\" by \"Martinus Scriblerus,\" and a further section named \"Martinus Scriblerus, of the Poem.\"\n\nMartinus Scriblerus was a corporate identity employed by Pope and the other members of the Scriblerians. Therefore, these two portions of the preface could have been written by any of its members, but they, like the other prefatory materials, were most likely written by Pope himself. The various Dunces had written responses to Pope after the first publication of \"The Dunciad,\" and they had not only written against Pope, but had explained why Pope had attacked other writers. In the \"Testimonies\" section, Martinus Scriblerus culls all the comments the Dunces made \"about each other\" in their replies and sets them side by side, so that each is condemned by another. He also culls their contradictory characterisations of Pope, so that they seem to all damn and praise the same qualities over and over again.\n\nThe \"Testimonies\" also includes commendations from Pope's friends. The words of Edward Young, James Thomson and Jonathan Swift are brought together to praise Pope specifically for being temperate and timely in his charges. The conclusion asks the reader \"to chuse whether thou wilt incline to the Testimonies of Authors avowed\" (like Pope's friends) \"or of Authors concealed\" (like many of the Dunces)--in short, \"of those who knew him, or of those who knew him not.\"\n\nAlexander Pope had a proximal and long term cause for choosing Lewis Theobald as the King of Dunces for the first version of the \"Dunciad.\" The proximate cause was Theobald's publication of \"Shakespeare Restored, or a Specimen of the many Errors as well Committed as Unamended by Mr Pope in his late edition of this poet; designed not only to correct the said Edition, but to restore the true Reading of Shakespeare in all the Editions ever published\" in 1726. Pope had published his own version of Shakespeare in 1725, and he had made a number of errors in it. He had \"smoothed\" some of Shakespeare's lines, had chosen readings that eliminated puns (which Pope regarded as low humour), and had, indeed, missed several good readings and preserved some bad ones. In the \"Dunciad Variorum\", Pope complains that he had put out newspaper advertisements when he was working on Shakespeare, asking for anyone with suggestions to come forward, and that Theobald had hidden all of his material. Indeed, when Pope produced a second edition of his Shakespeare in 1728, he incorporated many of Theobald's textual readings.\n\nPope, however, had already a quarrel with Theobald. The first mention of Theobald in Pope's writings is the 1727, \"Peri Bathos,\" in \"Miscellanies, The Last Volume\" (which was the third volume), but Pope's attack there shows that Theobald was already a figure of fun. Regardless of the quarrels, though, Theobald was, in a sense, the nearly perfect King of Dunces. \"The Dunciad's\" action concerns the gradual sublimation of all arts and letters into Dulness by the action of hireling authors. Theobald, as a man who had attempted the stage and failed, plagiarised a play, attempted translation and failed to such a degree that John Dennis referred to him as a \"notorious Ideot,\" attempted subscription translation and failed to produce, and who had just turned his full attention to political attack writing, was an epitome, for Pope, of all that was wrong with British letters. Additionally, Pope's goddess of Dulness begins the poem already controlling state poetry, odes, and political writing, so Theobald as King of Dunces is the man who can lead her to control the stage as well. Theobald's writings for John Rich, in particular, are singled out within the \"Dunciad\" as abominations for their mixing of tragedy and comedy and their \"low\" pantomime and opera; they are not the first to bring the Smithfield muses to the ears of kings, but they ferried them over in bulk.\n\nThe central premise of the poem is the same as that of \"MacFlecknoe\": the crowning of a new King of Dulness. However, Pope's poem is far more wide-ranging and specific than Dryden's had been. His satire is political and cultural in very specific ways. Rather than merely lambasting \"vice\" and \"corruption,\" Pope attacks very particular degradations of political discourse and particular degradations of the arts.\n\nThe political attack is on the Whigs, and specifically on the Hanoverian Whigs. The poem opens, in fact, with the goddess Dulness noting that \"Still Dunce the second rules like Dunce the first,\" which is an exceptionally daring reference to George II, who had come to the throne earlier in the year. Furthermore, although the King of Dunces, Theobald, writes for the radical Tory \"Mist's Journal,\" Pope consistently hammers at radical Protestant authors and controversialists. Daniel Defoe is mentioned almost as frequently as anyone in the poem, and the booksellers picked out for abuse both specialised in partisan Whig publications.\n\nThe cultural attack is broader than the political one, and it may underlie the whole. Pope attacks, over and over again, those who write for pay. While Samuel Johnson would say, half a century later, that no man but a blockhead ever wrote but for money, Pope's attack is not on those who get paid, but those who will write on cue for the highest bid. Pope himself was one of the earliest poets to make his living solely by writing, and so it is not the \"professional\" author, but the \"mercenary\" author that Pope derides. He attacks hired pens, the authors who perform poetry or religious writing for the greatest pay alone, who do not believe in what they are doing. As he puts it in book II, \"He (a patron) chinks his purse, and takes his seat of state... And (among the poets) instant, fancy feels th' imputed sense\" (II 189–91). He objects not to professional writers, but to hackney writers. His dunce booksellers will trick and counterfeit their way to wealth, and his dunce poets will wheedle and flatter anyone for enough money to keep the bills paid.\n\nThe plot of the poem is simple. Dulness, the goddess, appears at a Lord Mayor's Day in 1724 and notes that her king, Elkannah Settle, has died. She chooses Lewis Theobald as his successor. In honour of his coronation, she holds heroic games. He is then transported to the Temple of Dulness, where he has visions of the future. The poem has a consistent setting and time, as well. Book I covers the night after the Lord Mayor's Day, Book II the morning to dusk, and Book III the darkest night. Furthermore, the poem begins at the end of the Lord Mayor's procession, goes in Book II to the Strand, then to Fleet Street (where booksellers were), down by Bridewell Prison to the Fleet ditch, then to Ludgate at the end of Book II; in Book III, Dulness goes through Ludgate to the City of London to her temple.\n\nThe poem begins with an epic invocation, \"Books and the Man I sing, the first who brings/ The Smithfield Muses to the Ear of Kings\" (Smithfield being the site of Bartholomew Fair entertainments, and the man in question was Elkanah Settle, who had written for Bartholomew Fair after the Glorious Revolution; Pope makes him the one who brought pantomime, farce, and monster shows to the royal theatres). The goddess Dulness notes that her power is so great that, \"Time himself stands still at her command,/ Realms shift their place, and Ocean turns to land,\" and thus claims credit for the routine violation of the Unities of Aristotle in poetry. On Lord Mayor's Day of 1724, when Sir George Thorold was Lord Mayor, Dulness announces the death of the current King of Dunces, Elkanah Settle. Settle had been the City Poet, and his job had been to commemorate Lord Mayor's Day pageants. Thanks to his hard work in stultifying the senses of the nation, Dulness claims control of all official verse, and all current poets are her subjects (\"While pensive Poets painful vigils keep,/ Sleepless themselves to give their readers sleep\" I 91–92). She mentions Thomas Heywood, Daniel Defoe (for writing political journalism), Ambrose Philips, Nahum Tate, and Sir Richard Blackmore as her darlings. However, her triumph is not complete, and she aspires to control dramatic poetry as well as political, religious, and hack poetry. She therefore decides that Theobald will be the new King.\n\nThe action shifts to the library of Lewis Theobald, which is \"A Gothic Vatican! of Greece and Rome/ Well-purg'd, and worthy Withers, Quarles, and Blome\" (a Vatican Library for Northern European authors, and especially notable for vainglorious and contentious writing and criticism). Theobald is despairing of succeeding in writing dull poetry and plays, and he is debating whether to return to being a lawyer (for that had been Theobald's first trade) or to become a political hack. He decides to give up poetry and become an entirely hired pen for Nathaniel Mist and his \"Mist's Journal.\" He therefore collects all the books of bad poetry in his library along with his own works and makes a virgin sacrifice of them (virgin because no one has ever read them) by setting fire to the pile. The goddess Dulness appears to him in a fog and drops a sheet of \"Thule\" (a poem by Ambrose Philips that was supposed to be an epic, but which only appeared as a single sheet) on the fire, extinguishing it with the poem's perpetually wet ink. Dulness tells Theobald that he is the new King of Dunces and points him to the stage. She shows him,\nThe book ends with a hail of praise, calling Theobald now the new King Log (from Aesop's fable).\n\nBook II centres on the highly scatological \"heroic games.\" Theobald sits on the throne of Dulness, which is a velveteen tub (\"tub\" being the common term for the pulpit of Dissenters), and Dulness declares the opening of heroic games to celebrate his coronation. Therefore, all her sons come before her on the Strand in London, leaving half the kingdom depopulated, for she summons both dull writers, their booksellers, \"and\" all who are stupid enough to patronise dull writers.\n\nThe first game is for booksellers. (Booksellers at the time purchased manuscripts from authors, and the proceeds from book sales went entirely to the bookseller, with the author getting no more than the advance price.) Dulness therefore decides upon a race for the booksellers. She creates a phantom Poet, <br>\nbut, instead, a fat, well dressed poet (and therefore a wealthy, noble one who would command sales by his title). The phantom poet is named More, a reference to James Moore Smythe, who had plagiarised both Arbuthnot (\"Historico-physical Account of the South-Sea Bubble\") and Pope (\"Memoirs of a Parish Clark\"), and whose only original play had been the failed \"The Rival Modes\". The booksellers immediately set out running to be the first to grab Moore, with Bernard Lintot setting forth with a roar (Lintot had been James Moore Smythe's publisher), only to be challenged by Edmund Curll:<br>\nThe race seemingly having been decided by progress through bed-pan slops, Curll prays to Jove, who consults the goddess Cloacina. He hears the prayer, passes a pile of feces down, and catapults Curll to the victory. As Curll grabs the phantom Moore, the poems it seemed to have fly back to their real authors, and even the clothes go to the unpaid tailors who had made them (James Moore Smythe had run through an inherited fortune and bankrupted himself by 1727). Dulness urges Curll to repeat the joke, to pretend to the public that his dull poets were really great poets, to print things by false names. (Curll had published numerous works by \"Joseph Gay\" to trick the public into thinking they were by John Gay.) For his victory, she awards Curll a tapestry showing the fates of famous Dunces. On it, he sees Daniel Defoe with his ears chopped off, John Tutchin being whipped publicly through western England, two political journalists clubbed to death (on the same day), and himself being wrapped in a blanket and whipped by the schoolboys of Westminster (for having printed an unauthorised edition of the sermons of the school's master, thereby robbing the school's own printer).\n\nThe next contest Dulness proposes is for the phantom poetess, Eliza (Eliza Haywood). She is compared to their Hera. Whereas Hera was \"cow-eyed\" in \"Iliad\", and \"of the herders,\" Haywood inverts these to become a\nThe booksellers will urinate to see whose urinary stream is the highest. Curll and Chetham compete. Chetham's efforts are insufficient to produce an arc, and he splashes his own face. Curll, on the other hand, produces a stream over his own head, burning (with an implied case of venereal disease) all the while. For this, Chetham is awarded a kettle, while Curll gets the phantom lady's works and company.\n\nThe next contest is for authors, and it is the game of \"tickling\": getting money from patrons by flattery. A very wealthy nobleman, attended by jockeys, huntsmen, a large sedan chair with six porters, takes his seat. One poet attempts to flatter his pride. A painter attempts to paint a glowing portrait. An opera author attempts to please his ears. John Oldmixon simply asks for the money (Oldmixon had attacked Pope in \"The Catholic Poet\", but Pope claims that his real crime was plagiarism in his \"Critical History of England,\" which slandered the Stuarts and got him an office from the Whig ministry), only to have the lord clench his money tighter. Finally, a young man with no artistic ability sends his sister to the lord and wins the prize.\n\nAnother contest, primarily for critics, comes next. In this, Dulness offers up the prize of a \"catcall\" and a drum that can drown out the braying of asses to the one who can make the most senseless noise and impress the king of monkeys. They are invited to improve mustard-bowl thunder (as the sound effect of thunder on the stage had been made using a mustard bowl and a shot previously, and John Dennis had invented a new method) and the sound of the bell (used in tragedies to enhance the pitiful action). Pope describes the resulting game thus:\nThe critics are then invited to all bray at the same time. In this, Richard Blackmore wins easily:\n\nThe assembled horde go down by Bridewell (the women's prison) between 11:00 am and 12:00 pm, when the women prisoners are being whipped, and go \"To where Fleet-ditch with disemboguing streams/ Rolls the large tribute of dead dogs to Thames\" (II 267–8). At the time, Fleet Ditch was the city's sewer outlet, where all of the gutters of the city washed into the river. It was silted, muddy, and mixed with river and city waters.\n\nIn the ditch, the political hacks are ordered to strip off their clothes and engage in a diving contest. Dulness says, \"Who flings most filth, and wide pollutes around/ The stream, be his the Weekly Journals, bound\" (II 267–8), while a load of lead will go to the deepest diver and a load of coal to the others who participate. \"The Weekly Journals\" was a collective noun, referring to \"London Journal, Mist's Journal, British Journal, Daily Journal, inter al.\" In this contest, John Dennis climbs up as high as a post and dives in, disappearing forever. Next, \"Smedly\" (Jonathan Smedley, a religious opportunist who criticised Jonathan Swift for gain) dives in and vanishes. Others attempt the task, but none succeed like Leonard Welsted (who had satirised Pope, Gay, and Arbuthnot's play \"Three Hours after Marriage\" in 1717), for he goes in swinging his arms like a windmill (to splash all with mud): \"No crab more active in the dirty dance,/ Downward to climb, and backward to advance\" (II 296–7). He wins the \"Journals,\" but Smedly reappears, saying that he had gone all the way down to Hades, where he had seen that a branch of Styx flows into the Thames, so that all who drink city water grow dull and forgetful from Lethe.\n\nSmedly becomes Dulness's high priest, and the company move to Ludgate. There, the young critics are asked to weigh the difference between Richard Blackmore and John \"Orator\" Henley. The one who can will be the chief judge of Dulness. Three second year students (\"college sophs\") from Cambridge University and three lawyers from Temple Bar attempt the task, but they all fall asleep. The entire company slowly falls asleep, with the last being Susanna Centlivre (who had attacked Pope's translation of Homer before its publication) and \"Norton Defoe\" (another false identity created by a political author who claimed to be the \"true son\" of Daniel Defoe). Finally, Folly herself is killed by the dullness of the works being read aloud. The result is, appropriately, that there is no judge for Dulness, for Dulness requires an absence of judgment.\n\nBook three is set in the Temple of Dulness in the City. Theobald sleeps with his head on the goddess's lap, with royal blue fogs surrounding him. In his dream, he goes to Hades and visits the shade of Elkannah Settle. There he sees millions of souls waiting for new bodies as their souls transmigrate. Bavius dips each soul in Lethe to make it dull before sending it to a new body. (In classical mythology, the souls of the dead were put into Lethe to forget their lives before passing on to their final reward, but these are dipped in Lethe before being born.) Elkannah Settle hails Theobald as the great promised one, the messiah of Dulness, for Bavius had dipped him over and over again, from lifetime to lifetime, before he was perfected in stupidity and ready to be born as Theobald. Theobald had formerly been a Boeotian, several Dutchmen, several monks, all before being himself: \"All nonsense thus, of old or modern date, / Shall in thee centre, from thee circulate\" (III 51–2).\n\nSettle gives Theobald full knowledge of Dulness. This is his baptism: the time when he can claim his divine role and begin his mission (in a parody of Jesus being blessed by the Holy Spirit). Settle shows Theobald the past triumphs of Dulness in its battles with reason and science. He surveys the \"translatio stultitia\": the Great Wall of China and the emperor burning all learned books, Egypt and Omar I burning the books in the Ptolemean library. Then he turns to follow the light of the sun/learning to Europe and says,\nGoths, Alans, Huns, Ostrogoths, Visigoths, and Islam are all seen as destroyers of learning. Christianity in the medieval period is also an enemy of learning and reason in Settle's view:\nPope lambastes the medieval popes for destroying statuary and books that depicted Classical gods and goddesses and for vandalising others, for making statues of Pan into Moses.\n\nSettle then surveys the future. He says that Grub Street will be Dulness's Mount Parnassus, where the goddess will \"Behold a hundred sons, and each a dunce\" (III 130). He names two sons of contemporary dunces who were already showing signs of stupidity: Theophilus Cibber (III 134) and the son of Bishop Burnet.\n\nSettle turns to examine the present state of \"duncery\", and this section of the third book is the longest. He first looks to literary critics, who are happiest when their authors complain the most. Scholars are described as:\n\nFrom critics, he turns to the contrastive of triumphant dunces and lost merit. Orator Henley gets special attention here (lines 195 ff.). Henley had set himself up as a professional lecturer. On Sundays, he would discuss theology, and on Wednesdays any other subject, and those who went to hear him would pay a shilling each (\"Oh great Restorer of the good old Stage,/ Preacher at once, and Zany of thy Age!\" 201–202), while learned bishops and skilled preachers spoke to empty congregations. Next come the theatres: a \"Dr. Faustus\" was the toast of the 1726–1727 season, with both Lincoln's Inn Fields and Drury Lane competing for more and more lavish stage effects to get the audiences in:\nEven though Pope was on good terms with some of the men involved (e.g. Henry Carey, who provided music for the Drury Lane version), the two companies are fighting to see who can make the least sense. This competition of vulgarity is led by two theatres, and each has its champion of decadence. At Lincoln's Inn Fields is the \"Angel of Dulness,\" John Rich:\nRich's ability to ride in a stage whirlwind (in parody of God in the Book of Job) is matched by Colley Cibber and Barton Booth, patentees of the Drury Lane theatre, who mount the stage in purple dragons and have an aerial battle. Dulness is the winner in these contests, for she benefits. Settle urges Theobald to refine these entertainments, to hammer them home and get them all the way to court, so that Dulness can be the true empress of the land. He prophesies that Theobald will live in an age that will see Laurence Eusden the Poet Laureate and Colley Cibber the \"Lord Chancellor of plays\".\n\nSettle then reveals some current triumphs of dullness over good sense. He mentions William Benson as the proper judge of architecture,\nWilliam Benson was a fool who had taken the place of Sir Christopher Wren and told the House of Lords that the house was unsound and falling down. It was not. John Gay never obtained a pension and yet was often remarked as one of the most jovial, intelligent, and compassionate wits of the age. Jonathan Swift had been \"exiled\" to Ireland, where he had become involved in Irish politics. Pope himself had spent three years translating Homer. Settle sees in these things great prospects for the coming age of darkness.\n\nThe poem ends with a vision of the apocalypse of nonsense:\nSettle invokes the second coming of stupidity, urging,\nAt the very conclusion, Theobald cannot take any more joy, and he wakes. The vision goes back through the ivory gate of Morpheus.\n\nThe Three Book \"Dunciad\" has an extensive inversion of Virgil's \"Aeneid\", but it also structures itself heavily around a Christological theme. To some degree, this imagery of unholy consecration had been present in Dryden's \"MacFlecknoe,\" but Pope's King of Dunces is much more menacing than Thomas Shadwell could ever have been in Dryden's poem. It is not a case of an unworthy man getting praised that spurs the poem, but rather a force of degradation and decadence that motivates it. Pope is not targeting one man, but rather a social decline that he feels is all but irrevocable. Nevertheless, the poem is still a satire and not a lamentation. The top of society (the kings) may be dulled by spectacle and freak shows, but Dulness is only one force. She is at war with the men of wit, and she can be opposed. In the Four Book \"Dunciad\" (or \"Dunciad B\"), any hope of redemption or reversal is gone, and the poem is even more nihilistic.\n\nIn 1741, Pope wrote a fourth book of the \"Dunciad\" and had it published the next year as a stand-alone text. He also began revising the whole poem to create a new, integrated, and darker version of the text. The four-book \"Dunciad\" appeared in 1743 as a new work. Most of the critical and pseudo-critical apparatus was repeated from the \"Dunciad Variorum\" of 1738, but there was a new \"Advertisement to the Reader\" by Bishop Warburton and one new substantial piece: a schematic of anti-heroes, written by Pope in his own voice, entitled \"Hyper-Critics of Ricardus Aristarchus.\" The most obvious change from the three book to the four book \"Dunciad\" was the change of hero from Lewis Theobald to Colley Cibber.\n\nPope's choice of new 'hero' for the revised Dunciad, Colley Cibber, the pioneer of sentimental drama and celebrated comic actor, was the outcome of a long public squabble that originated in 1717, when Cibber introduced jokes onstage at the expense of a poorly received farce, Three Hours After Marriage, written by Pope with John Arbuthnot and John Gay. Pope was in the audience and naturally infuriated, as was Gay, who got into a physical fight with Cibber on a subsequent visit to the theatre. Pope published a pamphlet satirising Cibber, and continued his literary assault until his death, the situation escalating following Cibber's politically motivated appointment to the post of poet laureate in 1730. Cibber's role in the feud is notable for his 'polite' forbearance until, at the age of 71, he finally became exasperated. An anecdote in \"A Letter from Mr. Cibber, to Mr. Pope\", published in 1742, recounts their trip to a brothel organised by Pope's own patron, who apparently intended to stage a cruel joke at the expense of the poet. Since Pope was only about 4' tall, with a hunchback, due to a childhood tubercular infection of the spine, and the prostitute specially chosen as Pope's 'treat' was the fattest and largest on the premises, the tone of the event is fairly self-apparent. Cibber describes his 'heroic' role in snatching Pope off of the prostitute's body, where he was precariously perched like a tom-tit, while Pope's patron looked on, sniggering, thereby saving English poetry. In the third book of the first version of Dunciad (1728), Pope had referred contemptuously to Cibber's \"past, vamp'd, future, old, reviv'd, new\" plays, produced with \"less human genius than God gives an ape\". While Cibber's elevation to laureateship in 1730 had further inflamed Pope against him, there is little speculation involved in suggesting that Cibber's anecdote, with particular reference to Pope’s \"little-tiny manhood\", motivated the revision of hero. Pope's own explanation of the change of hero, given in the guise of Ricardus Aristarchus, provides a detailed justification for why Colley Cibber should be the perfect hero for a mock-heroic parody.\n\nAristarchus's \"hyper-criticism\" establishes a science for the mock heroic and follows up some of the ideas set forth by Pope in \"Peri Bathos\" in the \"Miscellanies, Volume the Third\" (1727). In this piece, the rules of heroic poetry could be inverted for the proper mock-heroic. The epic hero, Pope says, has wisdom, courage, and love. Therefore, the mock-hero should have \"Vanity, Impudence, and Debauchery.\" As a wise man knows without being told, Pope says, so the vain man listens to no opinion but his own, and Pope quotes Cibber as saying, \"Let all the world impute to me what Folly or weakness they please; but till \"Wisdom\" can give me something that will make me more heartily happy, I am content to be Gazed at.\" Courage becomes a hero, Pope says, and nothing is more perversely brave that summoning all one's courage just to the face, and he quotes Cibber's claim in the \"Apology\" that his face was almost the best known in England. Chivalric love is the mark of a hero, and Pope says that this is something easy for the young to have. A mock-hero could keep his lust going when old, could claim, as Cibber does, \"a man has his Whore\" at the age of 80. When the three qualities of wisdom, courage, and love are combined in an epic hero, the result is, according to Pope, magnanimity that induces admiration in the reader. On the other hand, when vanity, impudence, and debauchery are combined in the \"lesser epic\" hero (Pope uses the term \"lesser epic\" to refer to the satirical epic that would function like a satire play in the Classical theatre), the result is \"Buffoonry\" that induces laughter and disgust. Finally, Pope says that Cibber's offences are compounded by the outlandishness of his claims. Although he was \"a person never a hero even on the Stage,\" he sets himself out as an admirable and \"imitable\" person who expects applause for his vices.\n\nMost of the argument of the \"Dunciad B\" is the same as that of \"Dunciad A\": It begins with the same Lord Mayor's Day, goes to Dulness contemplating her realm, moves to \"Cibber\" (called \"Bays,\" in honour of his being Poet Laureate and thereby having the laurel wreath and butt of sherry) in despair, announces Cibber's choice as new King of Dunces, etc. Other than a change of hero, however, Pope made numerous adaptations and expansions of key passages. Not only are the topical references altered to fit Cibber's career, but Pope consistently changes the nature of the satire subtly by increasing the overarching metaphor of Cibber as \"Anti-Christ of Wit,\" rather than Classical hero of Dulness. Most of the adaptations increase the parody of the Bible at the expense of the parody of Virgil.\n\nThe invocation changes from \"the one who brings\" the Smithfield muses to the ears of kings to \"The Mighty Mother, and her Son who brings,\" thus immediately making Cibber the fatherless son of a goddess, and the poem addresses \"how the Goddess bade Britannia sleep,/ And pour'd her Spirit o'er the land and deep\" (I 7–8). From the invocation, the poem moves to an expanded description of the Cave of Poverty and Poetry, near Bedlam. Cibber is the co-master of the cave, as \"o'er the gates of Bedlam, by his fam'd father's hand/ Great Cibber's brazen, brainless brothers stand\" (I 31–2) (referring to statues constructed by Caius Cibber, Colley Cibber's father), and the cave is now the source of \"Journals, Medleys, Merc'ries, Magazines\" (I 42). These changes introduce the Biblical and apocalyptical themes that Book IV, in particular, will explore, as Dulness's spirit parodies the Holy Spirit dwelling upon the face of the waters in the Book of Genesis.\n\nWhen Dulness chooses her new king, she settles on Bays, who is seen in his study surveying his own works: \"Nonsense precipitate, like running Lead,/ That slip'd thro' Cracks and Zig-zags of the Head\" (I 123–4) and \"Next, o'er his Books his eyes began to roll,/ In pleasing memory of all he stole\" (\"B\" I 127–8). The base of Cibber's pile of sacrificed books is several commonplace books, which are the basis of all his own productions. Although Cibber confesses \"Some Daemon stole my pen... And once betray'd me into common sense,\" he prays to Dulness for inspiration, insisting that \"Else all my Prose and Verse were much the same;/ This, prose on stilts; that, poetry fall'n lame\" (I 187–90). The accidental common sense was \"The Careless Husband.\" When Cibber casts about for new professions, he, unlike Theobald in 1732, decides, \"Hold-to the Minister I more incline;/ To serve his cause, O Queen! is serving thine\" (I 213–4). The \"minister\" is Robert Walpole, an extremely unpopular Whig leader, and the \"queen\" is both Dulness and Queen Caroline of Hanover, who was a Tory enemy for her reconciliation of George II with Walpole. When the new king is about to burn his books in despair, Pope heightens the religious imagery, for Cibber says to his books, \"Unstain'd, untouch'd, and yet in maiden sheets;/ While all your smutty sisters walk the streets\" (I 229–30), and it is better that they be burned than that they be wrapped in \"Oranges, to pelt your Sire\" (I 236). Again, Dulness extinguishes the pyre with a sheet of the ever-wet \"Thule.\"\n\nCibber goes to Dulness's palace, and Pope says that he feels at home there, and \"So Spirits ending their terrestrial race,/ Ascend, and recognize their Native Place\" (I 267–8). The Christian Heaven-home of Puritan songs is altered for Cibber to the originating sleep of Dulness. While in the \"Dunciad A\" the palace had been empty, it is here crowded with ghosts (the same dunces mentioned in 1727, but all having died in the interim). Dulness calls forth her servants to herald the new king, and the book ends with Dulness's prayer, which takes an apocalyptic tone in the new version:\n\nMost of Book II of the \"Dunciad B\" is the same as \"Dunciad A.\" The Dunce Games are largely the same, with a few changes in personnel. Cibber watches all, with \"A brain of feathers, and a heart of lead\" (II 44). The contest of booksellers is generally as it was in 1727, with Curll slipping on bedpan slops. However, when Curll prays to Cloacina, Pope provides more motivation for her hearing his prayer:\nFurther, Cloacina aids Curll win the race herself, and not by intercession with Jove, and Pope here explains \"how\" she propels him to victory: she makes the ordure nourishment to Curll, and he \"Imbibes new life, and scours and stinks along\" (\"B\" II 106). Again, the phantom poet, More, vanishes. The game for Eliza Heywood's person and poetry is the same as the previous version, except that the promised gift for the victor is a chamber pot. Curll here competes with Thomas Osborne, a bookseller who had claimed to sell Pope's subscription edition of \"Iliad\" at half price, when he had merely pirated it, cut the size of the book to octavo, and printed on low quality paper. Curll wins Eliza, and Osborne is crowned with the pot.\n\nThe \"tickling\" contest is the same, except that Thomas Bentley, nephew of Richard Bentley the classicist, replaces Richard Blackmore. This Bentley had written a fawning ode on the son of Robert Harley (a former friend of Pope's with whom he seems estranged). In the noise battle, Dulness tells her poets,\nIn the braying contest that follows, there is a noise that seems to come \"from the deep Divine;/ There Webster! peal'd thy voice, and Whitfield! thine\" (\"B\" II 257–8). Webster was a radical Protestant religious writer who had demanded the scourging of the church, and Whitfield was George Whitfield, the notable collaborator with John Wesley, whom Pope describes as \"a Field-preacher. . . thought the only means of advancing Christianity was by . . . the old death of fire and faggot\" who agreed with Webster only \"to abuse all the sober Clergy\" (note to line 258). Richard Blackmore appears again as the single singer with the loudest \"bray.\"\n\nThe progress by Bridewell to Fleet-ditch and the muck-diving games are the same, but, again, with some changes of dunces. Oldmixon, who had appeared in 1727 as one of the ticklers, is here the elderly diver who replaces John Dennis. Smedley and Concanen are the same, but Pope adds a new section on party political papers:\nThese \"sons of a day\" are the daily newspapers that only had lifespans of a single issue. They were frequently printed with two different papers on the same sheet of paper (front and back), and Pope quotes the investigation into Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford (conducted by Walpole's administration) as showing that the Tory ministry of Pope's friends had spent over fifty thousand pounds to support political papers. The dead gazettes are mourned only by \"Mother Osborne\" (James Pitt, who had run the \"London Journal\" under the name of \"Father Osborne\"; he had been called \"Mother Osborne\" for his dull, pedantic style). The champion of splattering in \"Dunciad B\" is William Arnal, a party author of the \"British Journal\" who had gotten ten thousand pounds as a political hack. In keeping with the insertion of Webster and Whitfield, earlier, Pope takes a new turn and has the winner of the depth dive be the Archbishop of Canterbury, John Potter (1674–1747), and he is surrounded by an army of minor authors, \"Prompt to guard or stab, to saint or damn./ Heav'n's Swiss, who fight for any God, or Man\" (\"B\" II 357–8). These trimming religious authors are people like Benjamin Hoadley (who had been an aid to Smedley) and John \"Orator\" Henley. Potter describes the vision of Hades and the Styx pouring into the Thames, but it is not merely Lethe that pours in. Lethe and the effluvia of dreams go into the Thames, so the effect is that it \"Intoxicates the pert, and lulls the grave\" (\"B\" II 344). The Archbishop of Canterbury becomes the Archbishop of Dulness.\n\nThe book concludes with the contest of reading Blackmore and Henley.\n\nBook III is, like Book II, largely the same text as the \"Dunciad Variorum.\" In light of the new fourth book and the subtle changes of Book I, however, some passages take on more menace. The opening, in which Cibber rests with his head in Dulness's lap, is here a clear parody of the Madonna with child. The vision granted Cibber is less Christological, as Cibber is not given a mission in the same way with an infusion of the Unholy Spirit, as Book IV provides a new ending, but the general vision of Hades is the same. Cibber visits the shade of Elkannah Settle and is shown the \"translatio studii\" and its inverse, the \"translatio stultitiae,\" as learning moves ever westward across the world, with the sun, and darkness springs up right behind it.\n\nIn the survey of the formless poets waiting to be born (in print), Cibber sees the same faces as Theobald had, but with a few excisions and additions. The implied homosexual couple of critics from the \"Dunciad A\" are cut, but a mass of nameless poets contend, \"who foremost shall be dam'd to Fame\" (\"B\" III 158) (both cursed with fame and damned by the goddess Fama for being an idiot), and altogether,\nAs in the previous version, these struggling hack writers and political character assassins are contrasted to the glorious dunces who win all the money and fame of the kingdom, while worthy ministers and divines go ignored. Thus, Settle features Orator Henley as a paragon,\n\nAs in the three book \"Dunciad,\" Settle shows the happy triumph of Dulness on the stage, but the lines are compressed and take on a new parodic context:\nThe theatre is providing a mockery of the Apocalypse and the second coming, an inverted, man-made spectacle of the divine. For these accomplishments, Settle blesses Cibber and mourns his own failure in Dulness's service. For Cibber,\nSettle then takes a glance at the loss of learning incipient in the age. In architecture, the fool triumphant is Ripley, who was making a new Admiralty building, while \"Jones' and Boyle's\" fail. Settle wishes for the day to come soon when Eton and Westminster are in permanent holiday. As with the earlier version of the poem, the book ends with Cibber excitedly waking from his dream.\n\nBook IV was entirely new to the \"Dunciad B\" and had been published first as a stand-alone concluding poem. Pope himself referred to the four-book version \"the \"Greater Dunciad,\"\" in keeping with the \"Greater Iliad.\" It is also \"greater\" in that its subject is larger. Book IV can function as a separate piece or as the conclusion of the \"Dunciad\": in many ways its structure and tone are substantially different from the first three books, and it is much more allegorical.\n\nIt opens with a second, nihilistic invocation:\nThe fourth book promises to show the obliteration of sense from England. The Dog-star shines, the lunatic prophets speak, and the daughter of Chaos and Nox (Dulness) rises to \"dull and venal a new World to mold\" (\"B\" IV 15) and begin a Saturnian age of lead.\n\nDulness takes her throne, and Pope describes the allegorical tableau of her throne room. Science is chained beneath her foot-stool. Logic is gagged and bound. Wit has been exiled from her kingdom entirely. Rhetoric is stripped on the ground and tied by sophism. Morality is dressed in a gown that is bound by two cords, of furs (the ermines of judges) and lawn (the fabric of bishops sleeves), and at a nod from Dulness, her \"page\" (a notorious hanging judge named Page who had had over one hundred people executed) pulls both cords tight and strangles her. The Muses are bound in tenfold chains and guarded by Flattery and Envy. Only mathematics is free, because it is too insane to be bound. Nor, Pope says, could Chesterfield refrain from weeping upon seeing the sight (for Chesterfield had opposed the Licensing Act of 1737, which is the chaining of the Muses). Colley Cibber, however, slumbers, his head in Dulness's lap. (In a note, Pope says that it is proper for Cibber to sleep through the whole of Book IV, as he had had no part in the actions of book II, slept through book III, and therefore ought to go on sleeping.)\n\nInto the audience chamber, a \"Harlot form\" \"with mincing step, small voice, and languid eye\" comes in (\"B\" IV 45–6). This is opera, who wears patchwork clothing (for operas being made up of the patchwork of extant plays and being itself a mixed form of singing and acting). Opera then speaks to Dulness of the Muses:\nHowever, Opera warns Dulness that Handel is a threat to her. His operas make too much sense, have too strong a plot, and are too masculine in their performance. Accordingly, Dulness banishes Handel to Ireland.\nFame blows her \"posterior trumpet,\" and all the dunces of the land come to Dulness's throne. There are three classes of dunce. First, there are the naturally dull. These are drawn to her as bees are to a queen bee, and they \"adhere\" to her person. The second are the people who do not wish to be dunces but are, \"Whate'er of mungril no one class admits,/ A wit with dunces, and a dunce with wits\" (\"B\" IV 89–90). These dunces orbit Dulness. They struggle to break free, and they get some distance from her, but they are too weak to flee. The third class are \"false to Phoebus, bow to Baal;/ Or impious, preach his Word without a call\" (\"B\" IV 93–4). They are men and women who do dull things by supporting dunces, either by giving money to hacks or by suppressing the cause of worthy writers. These people come to Dulness as a comet does: although they are only occasionally near her, they habitually do her bidding. Of this last group, Pope classes Sir Thomas Hanmer, a \"decent knight,\" who absurdly thinks himself a great Shakespeare editor and uses his own money to publish an exceptionally lavish and ornate edition (with a text that was based on Pope's own edition). He is outshone in darkness by one Benson, who is even more absurd, in that he begins putting up monuments of John Milton, striking coins and medals of Milton, and translating Milton's Latin poetry and who had then passed from excessive Milton fanaticism to fanaticism for Arthur Johnston, a Scottish physician and Latin poet. Unable to be the most fantastically vain man, Hamner prepares to withdraw his edition, but \"Apollo's May'r and Aldermen\" (\"B\" IV 116) take the page from him. (This was a reference to Oxford University Press, with which Pope had a quarrel based on their denying Bishop Warburton a doctorate in 1741). Dulness tells her followers to imitate Benson and tack their own names to statues and editions of famous authors, to treat standard authors as trophies (the busts made of them like hunting trophies), and thus \"So by each Bard an Alderman shall sit\" (\"B\" IV 131).\n\nAll of the dunces press forward, vying to be the first to speak, but a ghost comes forward who awes them all and makes all to shake in fear. Doctor Busby, headmaster of Westminster School appears, \"Dripping with Infants' blood, and Mothers' tears\" (\"B\" IV 142) from the birch cane that he used to whip boys, and every man in the hall begins to tremble. Busby tells Dulness that he is her true champion, for he turns geniuses to fools, \"Whate'er the talents, or howe'er design'd,/ We hang one jingling padlock on the mind\" (161–2). Dulness agrees and wishes for a pedant king like James I again, who will \"stick the Doctor's Chair into the Throne\" (177), for only a pedant king would insist on what her priests (and only hers) proclaim: \"The RIGHT DIVINE of Kings to govern wrong\" (188), for Cambridge and Oxford still uphold the doctrine.\n\nAs soon as she mentions them, the professors of Cambridge and Oxford (except for Christ Church college) rush to her, \"Each fierce Logician, still expelling Locke\" (196). (John Locke had been censured by Oxford University in 1703, and his \"Essay on Human Understanding\" had been banned.) These professors give way to their greatest figure, Richard Bentley, who appears with his Quaker hat on and refuses to bow to Dulness. Bentley tells Dulness that he and critics like him are her true champions, for he had \"made Horace dull, and humbled Milton's strains\" (212) and, no matter what her enemies do, critics will always serve Dulness, for \"Turn what they will to Verse, their toil is vain,/ Critics like me shall make it Prose again\" (213–214). Picking fine arguments on letters and single textual variants and correcting authors, he will make all wits useless, and clerics, he says, are the purely dull, though the works of Isaac Barrow and Francis Atterbury might argue otherwise. He says that it is \"For thee explain a thing till all men doubt it,/ And write about it, Goddess, and about it\" (251–2). They cement over all wit, throwing stone back onto the figures that authors had chiselled out of marble. As he makes his boast, he sees \"A whore, a pupil, and a French governor\" come forward, and the devout Bentley skulks away.\n\nThe French governor attempts to speak to Dulness but cannot be heard over the French horn sound that emerges, so the pupil tells his story. The \"governor\" is an English nobleman who went to school and college without learning anything, then went abroad on the Grand Tour, on which \"Europe he saw, and Europe saw him too\" (294). He went to Paris and Rome and \"he saunter'd Europe round,/ And gather'd ev'ry Vice on Christian ground\" (\"B\" IV 311–312). At the end of his travels, he is \"perfectly well bred,/ With nothing but a Solo in his head\" (323–4), and he has returned to England with a despoiled nun following him. She is pregnant with his child (or the student's) and destined for the life of a prostitute (a kept woman), and the lord is going to run for Parliament so that he can avoid arrest. Dulness welcomes the three—the devious student, the brainless lord, and the spoiled nun—and spreads her own cloak about the girl, which \"frees from sense of Shame.\"\n\nAfter the vacuous traveller, an idle lord appears, yawning with the pain of sitting on an easy chair. He does nothing at all. Immediately after him, Annius speaks. He is the natural predator for idling nobles, for he is a forger of antiquities (named for Annio di Viterbo) who teaches the nobles to value their false Roman coins above their houses and their forged Virgil manuscripts above their own clothing. He serves Dulness by teaching her servants to vaunt their stupidity with their wealth.\n\n\n"}

Torches are usually commercially made props that are made of wood and/or metal with a wick attached at one end. The wick is impregnated with a flammable substance (usually paraffin) and ignited before use.\n\nThe two most common wicks used with juggling torches are:\nBoth materials come in reels of material ranging from 13mm to 180 mm wide and up to 100 m long. Around 40–80 cm of wick is wrapped onto each torch. In general, it is best to use hard limiting devices, such as nuts and bolts, to hold the wick onto the shaft of the torch.\n\nThe torch is usually constructed around a wooden dowel which runs the length of the torch from the knob (base) to the top. The lower 8-10 inch section is fitted with a handle, and is the section the juggler uses to catch and throw the torch. The handle can be covered in spiral wound plastic, cloth or leather. The middle of the torch is often larger in diameter than the handle and this section helps to balance the torch and makes it easier to juggle. The upper portion of the dowel is often covered in metal (usually aluminium) with the uppermost section covered in a wick. The wick is wrapped around the top of the shaft several times and secured with screws into the wooden core.\n\nTorches as described are commercially available from all the main juggling/circus skills manufacturers such as Renegade Juggling (as pictured above), Dubé, Beard, Flames 'N Games, Mister Babache, Henrys, Play, Infinite Illusions and cost anywhere from around 15GBP to around 25GBP each. The Ivan's Torch by SupremeFire retail at up to 105GBP ($199.99 USD) per torch.\n\nThe most common fuel used with juggling fire torches in the US is white gas, or Coleman fuel. Beginning torch jugglers usually use some form of lamp oil (like barbecue lighter fluid or kerosene) since it burns cooler than white gas and is easier on the club itself. Alcohol is generally not considered a good fuel for juggling torches.\nIn the UK fire jugglers almost exclusively use paraffin (kerosene) or lamp oil - treated paraffin that emits less smoke.\n\nIt is possible to buy flammable juggling balls. Gloves are often needed but not always; fyrefli juggling balls for example are designed so the flame sits a few centimeters above the hand. Ball juggling is easier than club juggling, and with juggling fire balls, any stage performances look impressive. However, juggling necessarily requires the hands to alternately grip the flaming balls for 1 or more 'juggling beats'(usually around 0.5 second), known as 'dwell time'. This restricts the size of flame and the duration of the burn to avoid overheating the hands, even with gloves. For these reasons all commercially available fire juggling balls use a smaller wick and flame than standard juggling torches. Some enthusiasts have attempted to overcome this problem using fuel-soaked balls of kevlar rope and welding gloves or similar, but have been unable to achieve more than 30 seconds of useful juggling before the gloves catch fire.\n\n\n"}

It was released on August 25, 2013, by RCA Records as the album's second single. The song was written by MoZella, Stephan Moccio, Sacha Skarbek, Kiyanu Kim, Lukasz Gottwald, and Henry Russell Walter; production was helmed by the last two. \"Wrecking Ball\" is a pop ballad which lyrically discusses the deterioration of a relationship.\n\n\"Wrecking Ball\" debuted on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at number 50, and later became Cyrus' first number-one single in the United States after the release of its controversial music video; it retained the peak position during the following week. Nine weeks later, the track returned to number one, and consequently had the largest gap between number-one sittings in \"Billboard\" Hot 100 history without dropping out between. As of January 2014, \"Wrecking Ball\" has sold three million copies in the United States. Internationally, the song charted strongly; it topped the charts in Canada, Spain and the United Kingdom, and charted in the top ten throughout much of Europe and Oceania.\n\nAn accompanying music video for \"Wrecking Ball\" was released on September 9, 2013. It featured close-up scenes of Cyrus tearfully singing, reminiscent of the clip for \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" by Sinéad O'Connor, interspersed with footage of a nude Cyrus swinging on a wrecking ball. Critics were divided in their opinions of the music video, feeling that it was more provocative than the clip for her previous single \"We Can't Stop\". \"Wrecking Ball\" previously held the Vevo record for the most views in the first 24 hours after its release with 19.3 million views. At the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards, Cyrus took home the award for Best Video and the award for Video of the Year at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. Adding to the video's success, Cyrus won the award for World's Best Video at the 2014 World Music Awards in Monte Carlo. Cyrus has performed \"Wrecking Ball\" during several live performances, including the iHeartRadio Music Festival and an episode of \"Saturday Night Live\".\n\nBefore directly stating that \"Wrecking Ball\" was originally written with Beyoncé in mind, songwriter Sacha Skarbek tweeted \"Beyonce song now becoming a Miley Cyrus song?!! Good/bad? I don't know??!!!! \" in December 2012. His representative commented that \"\"Originally, the [songwriting session between Dr. Luke and Sacha] was booked to write a song for Beyoncé. But as the song ['Wrecking Ball'] progressed, the songwriters realized the song would not work for her.\"\n\nThe song, and the cover of its parent album \"Bangerz\" (2013), were unveiled on August 25, 2013, before Cyrus' performance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. She released the cover artwork for \"Wrecking Ball\" on September 6, which shows Cyrus dressed in a sleeveless white shirt and underwear while swinging on a wrecking ball. The song was serviced to contemporary hit radio stations in the United States on September 17. It serves as the second single from \"Bangerz\", following the lead single \"We Can't Stop\", which was released in June.\n\n\"Wrecking Ball\" is a pop ballad; According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing America, it is set in common time with a tempo of 60 beats per minute. The track is written in the key of D minor and follows the chord progression Dm–F–C–Gm. Miriam Coleman of \"Rolling Stone\" noted that it begins with a minimalist keyboard instrumentation, which puts emphasis on Cyrus \"anguished vocals\", and also described it as a \"heartbroken counterpoint\" to \"We Can't Stop\". Cyrus said that \"Wrecking Ball\" was inspired by \"OneRepublic, and the way Timbaland used to do those big ballads.\"\n\n\"Wrecking Ball\" gained mostly positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Writing for \"The A.V. Club\", Marah Eakin provided a favorable review, calling it a \"solid ballad\" and describing it as \"a modern day 'My Heart Will Go On' that discussed a deteriorated, shortlived young romance.\" Kitty Empire from \"The Observer\" opined that \"the heartbreak section of \"Bangerz\" mostly repays your attention\" and mentioned \"Wrecking Ball\" to be a part of it. Although he found the song \"predictable,\" Evan Sawdey of PopMatters gave it an overall positive review and complimented its production and the build up to its chorus, calling it \"the kind of broad mainstream song that shows how you how to properly build up to a chorus before hitting us over the head with it. Jon Dolan of \"Rolling Stone\" felt that it \"[rides] the hunger and confusion that make great coming-of-age pop.\" Writing for AllMusic, Heather Phares considered the track to be a standout from \"Bangerz\".\n\nWriting for Digital Spy, Robert Copsey questioned Cyrus' decision to premiere a ballad in the midst of controversies regarding her \"salacious exploits\", but enjoyed the song itself and opined that it \"proves that there's method behind the madness.\" In a more mixed review, Joseph Atilano from the \"Philippine Daily Inquirer\" appreciated the lyrics for seeming heartfelt, but felt that its production was \"comparatively weaker\" by comparison to her earlier projects. Mikael Wood of \"Los Angeles Times\" felt that the track proved that Cyrus \"isn't just a twerk-bot programmed to titillate\", but suggested that her \"singing throbs with what feels like an embarrassment of emotion\" and found it peculiar that the song discussed the singer's relationship with Hemsworth when her public behavior seemingly suggested that she \"couldn't care less about\" it.\n\nAfter a month of voting, on March 31, 2014, \"Billboard\" declared the song to be the winner of the 2014 Hot 100 March Madness and their favorite Top 5 single from the past year. It defeated songs like \"Holy Grail\" by Jay-Z & Justin Timberlake, \"Best Song Ever\" by One Direction, \"Applause\" by Lady Gaga, \"Timber\" by Pitbull & Kesha and finally \"Just Give Me a Reason\" by Pink and Nate Ruess.\n\nBefore officially being serviced as a single, \"Wrecking Ball\" made a \"hot shot debut\" at number 50 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for the week issued on September 7, 2013, with 90,000 downloads in two days. It reached number 14 the following week with 201,000 downloads. After its official premiere as the second single from \"Bangerz\", the track peaked at number one in the United States in its fourth week, heavily assisted by online streaming credits from its recently released music video; this gave Cyrus her first number-one single in the country. It sold 477,000 copies that week, becoming the third-highest single sales week of 2013, behind the 582,000 units moved by \"I Knew You Were Trouble\" by Taylor Swift and the 557,000 units moved by \"Roar\" by Katy Perry. In December, \"Wrecking Ball\" returned to the peak position after being stuck at number or two or three the previous nine weeks as Lorde's \"Royals\" topped the Hot 100, with assistance from a viral parody video and consequently became the largest gap between number-one sittings in \"Billboard\" history without dropping out between. The next week it tumbled to number 5 as Eminem's \"The Monster\" featuring Rihanna topped the chart. As of December 2014, \"Wrecking Ball\" has sold 3,640,000 copies in the United States. The track peaked at number one on the Canadian Hot 100, and was later certified triple-platinum in the country. It reached the peak position on the Mexico Ingles Airplay.\n\n\"Wrecking Ball\" charted strongly throughout Europe. In the United Kingdom, the song and \"Bangerz\" both debuted at number one on their respective charts in the same week, making Cyrus the first artist of 2013 to achieve a \"chart double\" in the country. It was later certified platunium by the British Phonographic Industry. Additionally, the song marked Cyrus' second chart-topping single in the country after \"We Can't Stop\". In Belgium, it respectively reached numbers four and five on the Belgian Ultratop in the Flanders and Wallonia regions, and was eventually awarded a gold certification. The track peaked at number six on the Official German Charts, and was later certified platinum. It charted at number three on the Italian FIMI chart, and earned a double-platinum certification. In Oceania, \"Wrecking Ball\" charted at number two on both the Australian ARIA Charts and the Official New Zealand Music Chart. It was certified quadruple-platinum in the former country, and was given a platinum certification in the latter.\n\nAn accompanying music video for \"Wrecking Ball\" was directed by Terry Richardson, and was premiered through Vevo on September 9, 2013. The clip features close-up footage of Cyrus emotionally singing to the camera against a white backdrop, having been inspired by the music video for \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" by Sinéad O'Connor. Interspersed throughout are scenes of Cyrus licking a sledgehammer and swinging on a wrecking ball. At first, she is shown dressed in a sleeveless shirt, panties and Doc Martens boots; as the video progresses, she is then shown wearing only the boots.\n\nThe music video received generally mixed reviews from critics, who were divided in their opinions regarding Cyrus' increasingly provocative image. Writing for \"Billboard\", Jason Lipshutz stated that the \"nude Cyrus shown straddling a swinging wrecking ball\" was the most surprising piece of the clip. Amelia Proud from \"Daily Mail\" provided a mixed review, commenting that Cyrus delivered a visual that was more provocative than its \"boisterous\" predecessor \"We Can't Stop\" and questioned if she has \"finally gone too far this time\". The staff from \"Entertainment Weekly\" joked that viewers would be \"scandalized/titillated/disappointed in Billy Ray Cyrus' parenting skills\" after seeing his daughter nude and \"fellating a sledgehammer. \" Writing for \"The Guardian\", Michael Hann criticized Cyrus' attempts to distance herself from her innocent \"Hannah Montana\" image, a former television series in which Cyrus portrayed the primary character Miley Stewart, a middle school student who led a secret double life as pop star Hannah Montana. He disapproved of the manner in which she transitioned into a career beyond her childhood success, specifically panning her for \"exploring the iconography of porn.\" As of January 2015, \"Billboard\" named the video as the fourth best music video of the 2010s (so far).\n\nJames Montgomery from MTV News noted that the controversy surrounding Cyrus' nude performance in the video was \"to be expected\" given her recent controversies, and complimented Richardson \"for toning down the \"salacious\" scenes (if only for an instant), and allowing the softer, more genuine sides to shine through.\" Mikael Wood of \"Los Angeles Times\" opined that the music video tried to paint Cyrus in a more serious light with its scenes of her emotionally singing and crying.\n\n\"Billboard\" editor Jason Lipshutz opined \"Wrecking Ball\" is Cyrus' \"Cry Me a River\", for their controversial music videos and the artists' music evolution. \"A decade ago, Justin Timberlake was in \"My music will shut everyone up\" mode, too, as he railed against a teenybopper image\". He concluded \"Cyrus is breathtaking and talented, and, now that she has our attention with her own version of \"Cry Me a River,\" can dial down the shock tactics and present her artistic vision in the form of a new full-length.\"\n\nWith 19.3 million views in the first twenty-four hours of its release, the clip held the record for having the most views in that time-frame across Vevo platforms. The first-day viewing record was surpassed by the video for \"Anaconda\" by Nicki Minaj in August 2014, which received 19.6 million views upon its premiere. The video has received over 970 million views on YouTube. A director's cut of the music video was released on September 24, which features only the close-up footage of Cyrus singing against the white backdrop. Vanessa White Wolf from MTV News noted that \"the only time Richardson cuts away is at the very end, where, after a quick director's credit page, we see Terry and Miley laughing and mugging for the camera.\"\n\nThe 2014 Australian art prize the Bald Archy was awarded to Judy Nadin for \"Wrecking Balls Ashes to Ashes\", parodying cricketer Mitchell Johnson as Cyrus.\n\nIn an interview in 2017, Cyrus stated that she isn't \"a big fan\" of the music video herself. \"'Wrecking Ball' -- I'll do it, but I don't love it... It's when you're so stoked about something and then you have to sing a song that bums you out. And I'll never live down when I licked a sledgehammer.\"\n\nOn September 21, 2013, Cyrus performed \"Wrecking Ball\" for the first time during the iHeartRadio Music Festival in Las Vegas; she performed twice, first in the afternoon at Festival Village, and later in the evening at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. Despite generating media attention for a provocative wardrobe, the performance was considered to be \"fairly tame considering the VMAs\", where she touched recording artist Robin Thicke's crotch area with a giant foam finger and twerked against his crotch. On October 5, Cyrus served as the host and musical guest during an episode of \"Saturday Night Live\", which gained favorable reviews from music critics. The following Monday, Cyrus performed the track on \"Today\" as part of their Toyota Concert Series. She also performed the song during appearances on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" and \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" later that month.\n\nIn November, Cyrus traveled to Europe to sing \"Wrecking Ball\" at the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards in Amsterdam on November 10, 2013; she garnered media attention for smoking a joint of marijuana on-stage while accepting the Best Video Award for the track. On November 17, 2013, she performed the song on \"The X Factor\" in the United Kingdom. After being criticized for delivering a lackluster vocal performance, Cyrus was placed under \"vocal rest\" by her doctors in preparation of the Bangerz Tour. During her trip, she also performed on \"Wetten, dass..?\" in Germany (November 9), BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge in London (November 12), and the 2013 Bambi Awards in Germany (November 14). On November 24, Cyrus performed \"Wrecking Ball\" at the 2013 American Music Awards; a digitally animated cat projected on the screen behind her lip-synced the lyrics alongside her. In December, she performed at Jingle Ball concerts in Los Angeles (KIIS-FM Jingle Ball), Saint Paul, Atlanta, New York City, Washington, D.C., Tampa and Sunrise. Cyrus also performed \"Wrecking Ball\" on \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest\" in Times Square on December 31.\n\nAn episode of \"MTV Unplugged\" starring Cyrus premiered through MTV on January 29, 2014; she performed an acoustic version of \"Wrecking Ball\", among several additional tracks from \"Bangerz\". On May 27, 2014 Cyrus performed the song during the World Music Awards held in Monte Carlo, Monaco; where she also won four World Music Awards. She wore a gown with a scenic theme based on flowers during the performance. It received positive reviews for its understated simplicity and strong vocal delivery. Cyrus returned to perform the song during the musical festival on June 21, 2014, Summertime Ball at Wembley Stadium of London, in front of 80,000 people. Cyrus has performed the song during her ongoing Bangerz Tour. A critic from the \"Nashville Scene\" praised the performance, writing, \"Wrecking Ball was sung by Miley and earnestly shouted in unison by the arena, some of the audience tearing up.\" Blake Hannon praised Cyrus' vocal delivery, writing, \"The crowd kept going when things slowed down for Wrecking Ball. It was the highlight of the night, and not because of anything visual. The costumed characters vanished and the screen was black, with Cyrus belting out one of the best pop power ballads in recent memory with only a smattering of lights. It's a reminder that beneath it all, Cyrus has a voice — and a pretty big one, at that.\"\n\nIn September 2013, British singer-songwriter James Arthur covered \"Wrecking Ball\" on Radio Hamburg in Germany. Later that month, The Gregory Brothers released a country version, which Laura Vitto from Mashable felt \"trades in Miley's pop-ballad sound for a twangier feel.\" American singer-songwriter Alonzo Holt released his own rendition in October, which featured vocals from Arthur; it peaked at number 97 on the UK Singles Chart and number 71 on the Irish Singles Chart. American group Haim covered \"Wrecking Ball\" during their performance on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge, while the trio London Grammar sang it for the same session in December. Rumer Willis later sang the track during a performance which Chiderah Monde from \"Daily News\" felt \"captured more of the emotion behind the song\" than Cyrus' version. American singer Rebecca Black uploaded an acoustic version to her YouTube channel in November. Canadian singer Sarah Blackwood of Walk Off the Earth also released an acoustic version.\n\nDanie Geimer, a contestant on the third season of \"The X Factor USA\", performed the track during the first live show on October 29, while Dami Im from the fifth season of \"The X Factor Australia\" sang it in the semi-final round. Marley Rose (Melissa Benoist) covered the song and parodied elements of the music video for the \"Glee\" episode \"The End of Twerk\". Christina Grimmie sang the song during the Blind Auditions of sixth season of \"The Voice\" USA. Australian artist Kat Jade auditioned with a stripped-back/single-piano version in the third season of \"The Voice\" Australia after posting a popular acapella version of the song to her Youtube channel. \"Weird Al\" Yankovic covered the song as the first in his polka medley \"NOW That's What I Call Polka!\" for his 2014 album \"Mandatory Fun\". Metal band August Burns Red covered the song for the compilation album Punk Goes Pop 6. Melisa Cantiveros impersonated Miley Cyrus in Your Face Sounds Familiar (Philippines season 1) and performed this song, which she won the season.\n\n50 Cent told \"NME\" that the song was the one he would perform at karaoke: \"Just a big pop song that no one would suspect, just to fuck with them. Make them go, \"What?\"\" The song was featured in the film \"The Night Before\".\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Bangerz\".\n\n\n"}
