It was formed on 24 August 1986 by a group of young independent filmmakers and activists who were then campaigning for creative and aesthetically rich cinema.\n\nMost of these young filmmakers were initiated into cinema through their involvement with the film society movement in Bangladesh that began as early as in the 1960s. Short Film Forum was formed at a time when mainstream Bangladeshi cinema was dominated by crass commercialism and a network of producers-distributors-exhibitors which allowed no space for artistic or socially responsible films.\n\nThe Forum featured some of most notable young Bangladeshi film makers among its members, including Morshedul Islam, Tanvir Mokammel, Tareque Masud, Enayet Karim Babul, Tareq Shahrier, Shameem Akhter, Manjare Hasin Murad, Yasmin Kabir, Nurul Alam Atique, Zahidur Rahim Anjan, Rashed Chowdhury, and Akram Khan.\n\nBangladesh Short Film Forum now has its own film center in Shahbag, Dhaka with an auditorium, a library, an archive and an administrative office.\n\nThe Forum is mostly noted for organizing the biennial and non-competitive International Short and Independent Film Festival. The first festival was held in 1988, and was the first festival in the Indian Sub-continent which was entirely dedicated to short films.\n\nThe Forum produced a number of short films, including \"One Day in Krishnanagar\" (53 minutes) and \"Dhaka 2005\" (5 minutes). It organizes seminars and workshops on films and limited scale film festivals all over Bangladesh, as well as film shows in its Bangladesh Film Center in Shahbag.\n\n"}

It was developed by Carlton Cuse, Kerry Ehrin, and Anthony Cipriano, and is produced by Universal Television and American Genre for the cable network A&E.\n\nThe series, a contemporary prequel to Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film \"Psycho\"; based on Robert Bloch's 1959 novel of the same name, depicts the lives of Norman Bates (Freddie Highmore) and his mother Norma (Vera Farmiga) prior to the events portrayed in the novel and film, albeit in a different fictional town (White Pine Bay, Oregon, as opposed to Fairvale, California) and in a modern-day setting. However, the final season loosely adapts the plot of \"Psycho\".\nMax Thieriot and Olivia Cooke both starred as part of the main cast throughout the series' run. After recurring in the first season, Nestor Carbonell was added to the main cast from season two onward.\n\nThe series begins in Arizona with the death of Norma's husband, after which Norma purchases the Seafairer motel located in a coastal Oregon town so that she and Norman can start a new life. Subsequent seasons follow Norman as his mental illness becomes dangerous, and Norma as she struggles to protect her son, and those around him, from himself. The series was filmed outside Vancouver in Aldergrove, British Columbia, along with other locations within the Fraser Valley of British Columbia.\n\nA&E chose to skip a pilot of the series, opting to go straight-to-series by ordering a 10-episode first season. On June 15, 2015, the series was renewed for a fourth and fifth season, making \"Bates Motel\" A&E's longest-running original scripted drama series in the channel's history. The series' lead actors, Vera Farmiga and Freddie Highmore, received particular praise for their performances in the series, with the former receiving a Primetime Emmy Award nomination and winning a Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television. \"Bates Motel\" also won three People's Choice Awards for Favorite Cable TV Drama, and for Favorite Cable TV Actress (Farmiga) and Actor (Highmore).\n\nThe first season follows Norma and Norman Bates as they buy a motel after Norman's father dies. On one of the first nights of the two owning the motel, the former owner breaks in and sexually assaults Norma. Norman knocks the attacker out, and Norma stabs him to death. She decides it's best not to call the police and to cover up the murder. She and Norman dispose of the body. He complicates the cover-up by keeping a belt that belonged to the victim. When the town sheriff and his deputy notice that a man has gone missing, Norma and Norman must keep them from digging too far.\n\nThe second season follows the aftermath of Norman's teacher's murder, as her mysterious past comes to light. Meanwhile, Norma finds herself making dangerous decisions in order to keep the motel running and preventing the impending bypass. Bradley's search for her father's killer leads to the extremes, and Dylan learns the disturbing truth about his parentage.\n\nThe third season focuses on Norman's waning deniability about what's happening to him, and the lengths he will go to gain control of his fragile psyche. The dramatic events of last season leave Norma more aware of her son's mental fragility and fearful of what he is capable of. Meanwhile, Sheriff Romero begins to distance himself from the Bates family after he suspects Norma is lying to him about her husband's death.\n\nThe fourth season follows Norma as she becomes increasingly fearful of Norman, going to great lengths to find him the professional help he needs. This complicates their once unbreakable trust as Norman struggles to maintain his grip on reality. Meanwhile, Sheriff Romero once again finds himself drawn into Norma and Norman's lives. He agrees to marry Norma because his insurance will enable her to place Norman in an expensive psychiatric hospital. His generosity backfires, however, when Norman learns of the marriage. Norman bitterly resents Romero for coming between him and his mother and at one point threatens the sheriff with an axe.\n\nThe fifth season begins two years after the death of Norma. Publicly happy and well-adjusted, Norman struggles at home, where his blackouts are increasing and \"Mother\" threatens to take him over completely. Meanwhile, Dylan and Emma find themselves drawn back into Norman's world, and Romero hungers for revenge against his stepson, Norman.\n\n\nOn January 12, 2012, it was reported that A&E were developing a television series titled \"Bates Motel\" that would serve as a prequel to the Alfred Hitchcock film \"Psycho\". The first script was written by Anthony Cipriano. In March 2012, Carlton Cuse and Kerry Ehrin joined the project as executive producers and head writers. Cuse has cited the drama series \"Twin Peaks\" as a key inspiration for \"Bates Motel\", stating, \"We pretty much ripped off \"Twin Peaks\"... If you wanted to get that confession, the answer is yes. I loved that show. They only did 30 episodes. Kerry [Ehrin] and I thought we'd do the 70 that are missing.\" On July 2, 2012, A&E gave \"Bates Motel\" a straight-to-series order. Chris Bacon was hired to score the music for the series in January 2013.\n\nOn August 27, 2012, Vera Farmiga was the first to be cast in the leading role of Norma Louise Bates. On September 14, 2012, Freddie Highmore was cast as Norman Bates. That same day, Max Thieriot was cast as Norman's half-brother, Dylan Massett. Shortly after, on September 19, 2012, Nicola Peltz was cast as Bradley Martin, a possible love interest for Norman. Finally, on September 20, 2012, Olivia Cooke was the final main cast member to join the series, in the role of Emma Decody, Norman's best friend. Nestor Carbonell was cast in a recurring role as Sheriff Alex Romero in the first season, but was upgraded to the main cast at the beginning of the second season. In July 2014, Kenny Johnson, who recurred as Norma's brother Caleb Calhoun in the second season, was promoted to a series regular for the third season. It was announced on July 22, 2016 at San Diego Comic-Con International that Rihanna would appear in the iconic role of Marion Crane for the fifth and final season.\n\nA replica of the original Bates Motel set from the film \"Psycho\" was built on location at approximately 1054 272nd Street in Aldergrove, British Columbia, where portions of the series were filmed. The original house and motel is located in Universal Studios, Hollywood, Los Angeles. Additional filming for the series took place in multiple areas in Metro Vancouver, including Steveston, Coquitlam, Horseshoe Bay, West Vancouver and Fort Langley.

{"id": "3173450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3173450", "title": "Cremorne Gardens, London", "text": "Cremorne Gardens, London\n\nCremorne Gardens were popular pleasure gardens by the side of the River Thames in Chelsea, London. They lay between Chelsea Harbour and the end of the King's Road and flourished between 1845 and 1877; today only a vestige survives, on the river at the southern end of Cheyne Walk. Cremorne is also a ward of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The population of the ward at the 2011 Census was 7,974.\n\nOriginally the property of the Earl of Huntingdon (c. 1750), father of Steele's Aspasia, who built a mansion here, the property passed through various hands into those of The 1st Viscount Cremorne (1725–1813), an Irish peer from County Monaghan, who greatly beautified it.\n\nThe name Cremorne is the name of a barony, an old administrative unit, in County Monaghan in Ireland. It is an Anglicisation of what in modern Irish is \"Críoch Mhúrn\". This roughly translates as the 'Bounds of Mourne', from the territorial domain of an ancient clan or sept called Mughdorna in Old Irish. The name is cognate with the Mountains of Mourne.\n\nThe property was sold by the Dawson family, Barons Cremorne, in 1831 to a Baron de Berenger, who was a convicted fraudster whose real name was Charles Random. de Berenger converted the site into a sports facility, called The Stadium, and became a proponent of self-defence techniques. The business failed in 1843, but not before de Berenger had added some attractions of pleasure gardens of the time, including hosting a balloon ascent in 1838. For two years the gardens opened for summer, including an opening festival billed as \"Pie de Nie\" with Balloon ascent, for instance, were held, and the property was sold in 1845. James Ellis took over the license in January 1845. The twelve acre site was then developed by James Ellis into a proprietary place of entertainment and spectacle, being popular as such from 1845 to 1877. The Cremorne Gardens occupied a large site running between the Thames and the King's Road. Opened in 1845, they were noisy and colourful pleasure gardens featuring restaurants, entertainments, dancing and balloon ascents, and could be entered from the north gate on Kings Road or another by the Cremorne Pier on the river.\n\nThe famous artist James Abbott McNeill Whistler painted several nocturnes of Cremorne Gardens between 1872 and 1877. He was a resident of Cheyne Walk, a mere few hundred yards from the Gardens. His painting Cremorne Gardens No 2 is full of fashionable and active figures and parallels to some extent the ‘modern life’ paintings of his French associates Manet and Tissot with whom he was in close contact during the early 1870s. Cremorne Gardens was doubtless a most attractive location, not only for its light displays but also for the brilliant array of fashionable people who gathered there. They provided the setting for Nocturne in Black and Gold: the Firewheel and Nocturne in Black and Gold: the Falling Rocket of c.1874, the latter resulting in the Whistler versus Ruskin trial of 1878.\n\nWalter Greaves was the son of a Chelsea boat-builder who used to ferry Turner across the river; Walter and his brother Harry also performed the same service for Whistler, and in about 1863 became his unpaid studio assistants and pupils. They adored Whistler, accompanied him wherever he went, imitated his dress and manner, made the frames for his canvases, bought his materials and prepared his colours. Walter said; “He taught us to paint, and we taught him the waterman’s jerk”. Their close association lasted well into the 1890s, Whistler favouring Walter as he was the more gifted of the two brothers. Two of his most successful images were Regatta at Hammersmith Bridge and Chelsea under Snow; like Whistler he concentrated on areas around the Thames. He died in poverty, having been taken in by the Charterhouse.\n\nGreaves chooses to depict Whistler near the Crystal Platform. A reporter in the Illustrated London News (30 May 1857) admired the structure’s “inclosing ironwork...enriched, by Defries and Son, with devices in emerald and garnet cut-glass drops, and semicircles of lustre and gas jets, which have a most brilliant effect.” The pavilion was about three hundred and sixty feet in circumference. It was encrusted with ornamental pillars, gas jets, and over forty plate-glass mirrors in black frames. In the upper portion of the pagoda (seen here), where the orchestra played, there were seventeen gas lit chandeliers.\n\nThis particular feature of the Gardens was clearly a favourite with Greaves as he chose to depict it on several occasions, for example The Dancing Platform, Cremorne Gardens (1870s) and in an etching of this period, which depicts the same view as Whistler in the Cremorne Gardens. In the former Whistler is depicted as the natty flaneur, striding along with and yet separate from the crowd. In the latter Whistler is seated but maintains the image of flaneur, the impartial, non-judgmental observer of contemporary life. He leans to one side to acknowledge a fellow dandy, much to the impatience of the young woman who stands at his table. Cremorne Gardens rapidly acquired a reputation as the territory of the demi-monde frequented by women of questionable morals. His associate could buy such a woman; this is implied by his indifference towards her, the attention of the passing woman as well as the undisguised stare of the gentleman at the railing. \nWhistler and the Greaves family were frequent visitors before the gardens closed in 1877. Cremorne Gardens never acquired the fashionable fame of Vauxhall Gardens, and finally became so great an annoyance to some of the more influential residents in the neighbourhood that a renewal of its licence was refused, and most of the site of the gardens was soon built over. The name survives in Cremorne Road.\n\nDonald James Wheal, in his first-person memoir of life in working-class Chelsea, World's End gives a lively account of the almost-forgotten history and destruction of Cremorne Gardens.\n\nA vestige of the gardens survives next to the Thames, just east of Lots Road power station. It is largely paved over, and there is little to suggest the grand scale of the original gardens, though it still has two attached jetties, an echo of the landing stages where visitors to the original pleasure gardens would arrive by boat. Recently, one of the original grand iron gates from the gardens has been restored and stands on the current site .\nA Cremorne Gardens was also established in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nOn 13 September 2010 Thames Water published its preferred sites for building work on its Thames Tideway super sewer. Thames Water originally proposed that an access road cut straight through Cremorne Gardens. \n\nCremorne Gardens secured a Green Flag award for the first time in 2010 as one of the best green spaces in England. Councillor Nicholas Paget-Brown, Cabinet Member for Environment and Leisure Services, attended the flag raising ceremony at Cremorne Gardens at the end of July along with the Mayor of Kensington and Chelsea, Councillor James Husband. \n\nLocal Conservative Kensington and Chelsea Councillors and residents have promised to try to save the Gardens from use as an access road to build the Thames Tunnel. . Phil Stride representing Thames Water stated \"We are happy to work with the council to use whatever access route they can help us find.\" Early in 2011, the Lots Road Waste Centre owned by the Council ceased operation. The former Waste Centre is closer to the proposed Tideway Tunnel, therefore is an alternative site for the access road. However, Cremorne Gardens is still listed as the preferred site on the Thames Water website even though it is the Council's decision. \n\nIn 2014, Cremorne Gardens was again under threat from the local council which suggested to Transport For London that there be a \"Chelsea West\" station on Kings Road near World's End and on the site of the Cremorne Estate for Crossrail Two. Cremorne Gardens would have been destroyed to use as the building site for the station. After a huge outcry from residents, the council abandoned its support for Chelsea West.\n\nThe BBC drama \"Desperate Romantics\" regularly depicted the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood meeting prostitutes in Cremorne Gardens.\n\nIn Strong Poison, a Lord Peter Wimsey mystery, Dorothy L. Sayers named a character Cremorna Garden. Cremorna was an actress of dubious repute, no doubt so named after the garden's racy reputation.\nIn \"Coral\" by Compton Mackenzie (1925) in which Coral Avery, an upper-class girl, falls in love with her chauffeur, she gets him to drive down the Embankment to the Cremorne Arms at Chelsea reach, where they declare their love for each other.\n\n\n"}

Meyer de Wolfe offered a sheet music library of original compositions to accompany silent films, often produced in collaboration with other musicians from the orchestras of London. These collaborators included conductor Sir Landon Ronald, violinist and conductor Sir Eugene Goossens, composers Giuseppe Becce and Ivor Novello, and violinist Mantovani. \n\nBy the late 1920's de Wolfe Music began recording with the 'sound-on-disc' technique and 'sound-on-film', on the 35mm nitrate film. This film was explosive if improperly stored, which proved to be the cause of an explosion in the basement of the company's Wardour Street office. Examples of compositions from this time include \"Keep Your Face To The Sunshine\" (1926), \"Odiele\", performed by Ivor Novello, from the film \"The Rat\" (1925), and \"Policeman's Holiday\" (1931) by Montague Ewing. \n\nIn the 1930's de Wolfe created soundtracks for newsreels, working with Pathé News, British Movietone News, and British Gaumont Cinemas. This work continued throughout the Second World War and on in to the 1960's. The company was still providing music for film, including \"Fame Is the Spur\" (with a soundtrack composed by Dam Busters pilot John Wooldridge) and \"Edward, My Son\" (1948).\n\nAfter the Second World War, de Wolfe expanded in to North America through a partnership with Corelli and Jacobs, two film editors from Paramount Pictures. In 1955 the company provided the music for the first televised commercial in the U.K. for Gibbs Toothpaste.\n\nIn 1962 de Wolfe began distributing 10\" vinyl records, with cover designs by Rolf Webster and Nick Bantock. These LPs are now widely sought after by record collectors. At this time de Wolfe provided the theme to \"The Power Game\" (earning de Wolfe and Wayne Hill an Ivor Novello Award for Instrumental Composition of the Year), and for a number of episodes of \"Doctor Who\". \n\nIn 1973 a Jack Trombey composition was used as the theme for the detective series \"Van Der Valk\". \"Eye Level\" became a million-selling number one single, topping the U.K charts for six weeks. Around this time de Wolfe music could be heard in Kung Fu movies by the Shaw Brother's, British Comedies \"Zeta One\" and \"Adventures of a Taxi Driver\", and the Monty Python films. The 1970's was a period of further expansion for the company, with the addition of the Rouge catalogue in 1975 and the establishing of Angel Recording Studios in 1979.\n\nDigital technology bought changes to the music industry in the 1980's, particularly with the evolution of CDs. In 1985 de Wolfe launched its DWCD collection of 6 CDs, becoming the world's first digital production music library. De Wolfe ultimately ended the production of its vinyl series in 1988, and the end of the production of CDs would come in 2014 as de Wolfe shifted focus to online delivery.\n\nDe Wolfe LTD celebrated its centenary year in 2009, with the company at that time boasting offices and agents in 40 countries.\n\nDe Wolfe LTD produces audio for a variety of genres and usage, which are organised in to a number of labels. \n\nDe Wolfe's primary label, and where a majority of the new releases are housed.

It features a number of progressive Jazz recordings from the likes of Vladimir Cosma, Martial Solal and Pierre Arvay.\n\nLaunched in 2016 Widescreen features trailer music and cinematic compositions, including 5.1 options.\n\nThe newest label, Bite Hard features albums made through collaborations with American record producers. Primarily these albums feature samples from de Wolfe archive tracks, and have been made commercially available.\n\nAs well as music, de Wolfe supplies sound effects. It's vast collection includes sounds from the BBC, Hanna-Barbera, Sound Ideas and the DWSFX collection.\nCommercially available albums made up of film soundtracks, including Witchfinder General and Monty Python and the Holy Grail, compilations of well-known tunes, and albums from the likes of Deux Filles.\n\n\"(see Angel Recording Studios)\"\n\nBuilt in 1979, Angel Studios is a world class recording and mixing facility in Angel, Islington, North London. The studio has been used by the likes of The Clash, Shirley Bassey, One Direction, Take That, Kylie Minogue, Adele, Sam Smith and George Fenton for his work on the soundtrack for the BBC series \"Planet Earth\" and \"The Blue Planet\".\n\n Specially composed tracks, commissioned to a roster of composers and produced at Angel Studios. Inter Angel has provided theme tunes for shows including \"Saturday Kitchen\", \"Robot Wars\", Hairy Bikers, \"Thronecast\", Delia Smith and \"A League of Their Own\".\n\nFor a number of years, de Wolfe had a presence in the United States through its partnership with Corelli & Jacobs. In 2014 steps were taken to officially launch De Wolfe USA to increase the company's presence on the other side of the Atlantic. The office was set up in New York and since then the company has worked on a number of projects with HBO, ABC, Fox, Netflix, Amazon and many other US-based production companies. De Wolfe USA was also key to establishing of the Bite Hard label.\n\nDe Wolfe composers past and present include: Jack Trombey, Simon Park, Tim Souster, Barbara Moore, Andy Quin, Alex Heffes, Stanley Myers, Stephane Grappelli, John Altman, Stanley Black, David Bradnum, Frank Mcdonald and Chris Rae, Paul Lawler, Frederic Talgorn, York Bowen, Johnny Hawksworth, Steve Sidwell, Ivor Slaney, Reg Tilsley, Ronald Binge, David Kelly, Hampton Hawes, Basil Kirchin, Alan Parker, Ena Baga, Roger Webb, Ivor Novello, Colin Kiddy, Howie, David Hubbard, Nigel Mullaney, Danny Davies, Jonathan Jowett, Simon Stewart, Troy Banarzi, Ross Hardy, John Leach, Paul Leonard-Morgan, Terry Keating, Ian Boddy, Paul Lewis, Karl Jenkins, Terry Gadsden, Hermann Langschwert and Nick Ingman.\n\nDe Wolfe credits and usage include:\n\n\"Vision On\", \"Monty Python\", \"Roobarb\", \"The Power Game\", \"The Sweeney\", \"Henry's Cat\", \"George and Mildred\", \"Man About The House\", \"NFL Today\", \"Mindhunter\", \"Master of None\", \"The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\", \"Springwatch\", \"Spitting Image\", \"Jamaica Inn\", \"Balamory\", \"Agatha Christie's Poirot\", \"Minder\", \"Feud\", \"Atlanta\", \"Peaky Blinders\", \"Mr Robot\", \"The Night Manager\", \"Better Call Saul\", \" World Championship Wrestling\"\n\n\"Emmanuelle\", \"Octopussy\", \"The Living Daylights\", \"The Cider House Rules\", \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\", \"Brokeback Mountain\", \"Witchfinder General\", \"The Fourth Protocol\", \"The Prestige\", \"Grindhouse\", \"Sicko\", \"Dawn of the Dead\", \"Shaun of The Dead\", \"Tomb Raider\", \"Hidden Figures\", \"Brooklyn\"\n\nAs well as a number of commercials, radio shows and video games.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1498881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1498881", "title": "Derek and Clive", "text": "Derek and Clive\n\nDerek and Clive was a double act of comedic characters created by Dudley Moore (Derek) and Peter Cook (Clive) in the 1970s. The performances were captured on the records \"Derek and Clive (Live)\" (1976), \"Derek and Clive Come Again\" (1977), and \"Derek and Clive Ad Nauseam\" (1978), as well as in a film documentary, \"Derek and Clive Get the Horn\" (1979). A greatest hits album containing some previously unreleased material, called \"\", was released in 2011. The characters are foul-mouthed extensions of the earlier characters Pete and Dud.\n\nConsidered highly offensive by many at the time, the sketches primarily took the form of bizarre, sometime drunken streams of consciousness led by Cook, with interjections from Moore. Memorable moments from the records include Clive claiming that the worst job he ever had was retrieving lobsters from Jayne Mansfield's arsehole, Derek claiming his worst job was cleaning up Winston Churchill's bogeys (leading the pair to conclude that the \"Titanic\" was one such bogey), Clive claiming that he was sexually aroused by the sight of a deceased Pope lying in state, and a horse-racing 'commentary' featuring horses named after sexual organs or their vulgarised derivatives.\n\nThough the recordings were far too crude for a mainstream audience, Derek and Clive bootleg recordings circulated. They were mostly unscripted dialogues incorporating copious swearing - including frequent use of the word \"cunt\".\n\nThe characters, supposedly two lavatory attendants (although in one sketch, 'Back of the Cab', they play the roles of two London taxi drivers) first surfaced in the mid-1970s.\n\nCook and Moore were performing on Broadway with their revue show \"Good Evening\", a live version of their television series \"Not Only... But Also\". The relationship between the two men had become strained as a result of Cook's worsening alcoholism. To reassure Moore, Cook hired a recording studio in New York, where the two could simply relax, drink and ad-lib. The resulting recording was padded out with live performances of old favourites, such as \"Bo Duddley\" and began to circulate as \"Derek and Clive (Live)\".\n\nCook became bemused at the idea that they should not be making money from the increasing popularity of Derek and Clive, and suggested to Moore that the recording should be released officially. By this point, Moore had embarked on a successful Hollywood film career and found the tapes embarrassing, until he too realised his contemporaries were fans.\n\nTwo more records were made. They were less like dialogues and more like vindictive attacks on the increasingly successful Moore by Cook, whose career had stalled somewhat in comparison. One such merciless assault was in a cancer themed diatribe when Cook was fully aware that Moore had recently lost his father to the disease. The same love-hate relationship between them is evident in the \"Derek and Clive Get the Horn\" movie.\n\nIt is often mistakenly assumed that all of their releases were recorded while under the influence of alcohol. While this can be presumed of \"Come Again\" - where the sounds of bottles can be heard in the background, featuring some tracks where both Cook and Moore are slurring their words - the home video release of \"Derek and Clive Get the Horn\" shows a very sober looking Cook and Moore drinking coffee and water throughout. During the filming, a prank was played upon Cook and Moore by Richard Branson where 'police' arrive and suspiciously sniff the contents of an ash tray to the dismay of the unnerved and wary pair.\n\nLater CD releases of \"Come Again\" and \"Ad Nauseam\" featured out-takes, most were recorded during the \"Ad Nauseam\" sessions. Surreal at times, these included \"Mother\" - featured on \"Derek and Clive Get the Horn\" - where Cook pretends to visit his over-possessive and deranged mother, ending with Cook telling his mother to \"shut your fucking face and die\". \"Valerie's Hymen,\" where Moore discussed cutting out his wife's hymen with a carving knife, and \"Lady Vera Fart Teller\", wherein Moore elaborates on a visit to a fortune teller who could tell his future by examining his farts.\n\nTranscripts of further, unreleased, out takes are available in a book titled \"Come Again\", edited by William Cook and feature \"General Eisenhower\", where Cook reflects on the perils of counting the late General's dandruff flakes; \"Vietnam\", where Moore received a paper cut inflicted by the Viet Cong (in one insightful remark Cook mentions a \"friend\" of his who fought in Vietnam but he's not sure \"on which side\"), and \"A Million Pounds\", where Cook plays an hysterical woman trying to obtain a million pounds from a sympathetic Moore. The remaining unreleased out-takes are variations on actual releases.\n\nTracks from \"Derek and Clive (Live)\", specifically the Bo Duddley sketch, were sampled on one of the first UK house music tracks, 1988's \"Voodoo Ray\" by A Guy Called Gerald.\n\n\n"}

Stern and Adam Del Deo. It follows the process of casting the 2006 Broadway revival of \"A Chorus Line\" and explores the history of the award-winning musical, beginning with the informal interviews with Broadway dancers conducted by Michael Bennett that served as its basis. Their personal observations and feelings were captured on audiotape, many of which are heard in this film.\n\n3,000 dancers arrived to audition for the revival on the first day. Some of their stories are interwoven with recollections of members of the original cast, including Donna McKechnie and Baayork Lee; composer Marvin Hamlisch; and Bob Avian, who co-choreographed the original 1975 production and directed the 2006 revival\n\nThe film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2008 and went into theatrical release with the title \"Broadway Broadway\" in Japan the following month. It was shown at the Berlin International Film Festival, the Thessaloniki Documentary Festival, and the Sarasota Film Festival before going into limited release in the US on April 17, 2009.\n\nKaori Shoji of \"The Japan Times\" said the film \"plays off the echo effect of [its] premise with skill, grace and heartfelt sympathy; it's clearly the work of people who love dancers, whether they're grinning in the spotlight or fighting back tears after a failed tryout . . . [W]hat surfaces in the film is the fierce dedication [dancers] have to their craft and the sense that they're here singing and performing their guts out in front of choreographers and producers because there's no other place on Earth they'd rather be.\"\n\nA.O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" observed, \"There is a superficial resemblance between \"Every Little Step\" (and, for that matter, \"A Chorus Line\" itself) and television reality shows in which ordinary people use their talents to scramble for the spotlight. But those programs are spectacles of amateurism chasing after celebrity, an impulse that could not be further from what Mr. Stern and Mr. Del Deo, taking their cues from Mr. Bennett, set out to honor. The 17 members of that chorus line — and the thousands like them, including those who dream of playing them — are professionals, and one of the names they give to the glory they seek is work. The other is love.\"\n\nKenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said the film \"doesn't do anything unexpected, and it doesn't have to . . . it's a can't-miss effort that knows how to please.\"\n\nKyle Smith of the \"New York Post\" rated the film 1½ out of four stars and called it a \"sloppily directed\" film that \"assumes you know everything going in, which makes it more a souvenir scrapbook than a narrative.\"\n\nPeter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" rated the film three out of four stars and described it as \"a thrilling combination of documentary and musical dazzler\" and \"a heartbreaker.\"\n\nOwen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" graded the film A, calling it \"a movie as layered and as enthralling as its subject.\"\n\n"}

In it, Mohr recounts, among other things, his battles with panic attacks, being intimidated by castmates Rob Schneider and Ellen Cleghorne, his conflicts with Al Franken, his admiration for deceased castmates Chris Farley and Phil Hartman, the admission that he stole material from actor/comedian Rick Shapiro, and being depressed about his lack of sketch appearances.\n\n\"SNL\" castmember Bobby Moynihan has said that it was one of his favorite SNL related books, calling it \"a handbook on what NOT to do at SNL.\"\n\n\"Booklist\" called it \"Good insider dish\": \"Mohr chronicles those years with the sly wit he's become known for, as well as nostalgia for both the time he had and the kid he was. That's not to say things went well. He barely got any sketches on air, his dressing room was once an elevator shaft, and he suffered panic attacks so severe he thought he would die on camera. But he also met some encouraging people (Mike McKeon) [\"sic\"] and was able to spend a little time hanging out with various luminaries (Eric Clapton), so even though he moans and whines about what he endured on the show, he ends up describing the experience as glorious.\"\n\n\"Publishers Weekly\", on the other hand, found \"this stilted but honest memoir\" to serve only \"mostly superficial dish\": \"Few of his sketches aired, and aside from his impressions of Ricki Lake, Christopher Walken and Dick Vitale, he was rarely on camera. (When he was on air, he admits, he often couldn't keep a straight face.) Mohr treats readers to some affectionate, entertaining tales of the late Chris Farley, but his book is less a juicy inside story of the comedy institution than a tale of an immature young man's struggle with a high-stress, erratic workplace: 'The schedule for putting together Saturday Night Live was made back in the seventies when everyone was on coke... Problem was, no one did coke [anymore] and we were expected to keep the same hours.'\"\n\n\"Kirkus Reviews\" wrote, \"Mohr is unafraid to come off as nervous and a little grating: the whole first season he's just the new guy nobody will look in the eye, whose ideas get shot down, who's always asking dumb questions and almost never gets on the air. Though tinged with bitterness (after two seasons, Mohr was basically known only for his Christopher Walken impersonation), this account is generous in its praise for people like Phil Hartman, Chris Farley, and Michael McKean. Profiles of other costars--like David Spade, who \"was only on the show so he could sleep with models\"—are just dishy enough to leave the reader wanting more. \nDespite stiff prose, an engagingly honest look at the crossroads of comedy and dysfunction.\"\n\n\"Kliatt\" gave the Audiobook, read by Mohr, an A: \"Mohr's experiences make one wonder how the show ever gets on the air. He dishes unflattering portraits of some of the cast and some guest hosts while speaking most fondly of Phil Hartman and Chris Farley. He does not shy from revealing his warts as well. For fans of SNL. Raw language... Recommended for advanced students and adults.\"\n"}

The game was initially released in early access in October 2013 after a successful Kickstarter campaign, and it was officially released on Steam July 2, 2015.\n\n\"Legends of Eisenwald\" is a fantasy role-playing game set in a fictitious duchy of Eisenwald in medieval Germany in times of Holy Roman Empire. The main focus of the story in the main campaign revolves around the life of the youngest child of Baron Lahnstein who on return to his lands finds that the family castle is impossible to enter. There are two separate single scenarios: The Masquerade and Cursed Castle that are separate stories happening in other locations of Eisenwald.\n\nThe gameplay is divided into two main parts: global map interactions including completing quests, buying and selling armor, weapons, potions and other equipment and items, equipping the army, managing castles, and other possessions, and finally the battles themselves.\n\nBattles consist of confrontations between a hero's squad (which can take up to eleven other troops) and an enemy squad. At the end of the battle, the winning side receives experience points. All units receive XP proportionally to their contribution in the battle. If sufficient XP is accumulated by a unit, it may then upgrade to another, determined by its upgrade tree if any. Upgrade of the units is free and even if a unit is not upgraded right away, its extra upgrade points are saved for later.\n\nAt the beginning of a campaign, the player may select his or her class (Knight, Baroness, or a Mystic). Each class has its own advantages. For example, a knight can learn to ride a horse, a baroness can use both bows and crossbows, and a mage can learn mass spells. Unlike regular units, heroes don't change their look when they upgrade, they can learn new skills.\n\nHero skill trees are divided into three parts: combat, feudal and command. Combat skills are unique for each class whereas feudal and command skills are shared among the three heroes.\n\nThe game features many different units including soldiers, spearmen, nobles, pikemen, priests, monks, healers, witches and more that have different parameters and skills.\n\n"}

Banksy has said he prepared the self-destruct mechanism at this time in case the work was ever put up for auction.\n\nSotheby's London sold the painting at auction on 5 October 2018, at an artist-record price of £1,042,000. Within seconds of the gavel drop, the canvas began sliding out of the bottom of the frame and shredding itself to the audible sound of a siren and the surprise exclamations of attendees. The work was housed in a deep frame and was plugged in to facilitate built-in electrical lights, which powered the hidden paper shredder as well. Sotheby's said they had no foreknowledge of the mechanism. \n\nAfter the shredding, there was a negotiation with the buyer to confirm the sale, and on 11 October it was agreed that the sale would go through at the original price. The work was renamed by Banksy's representatives from \"Girl with Balloon\" to \"Love is in the Bin\". Market watchers speculated that the self-destruction would increase the artwork's value. Sotheby's released a statement that called it \"the first artwork in history to have been created live during an auction\".\n\nIt was reported that the artist uploaded a video of the event onto Instagram, showing the construction of the shredding mechanism and frame, but deleted the post. Banksy has released another video indicating that the painting was intended to be shredded completely, showing the painting being shredded with the words: \"In rehearsals it worked every time\".\n\nIt has been speculated that a man seen filming the shredding was Banksy or someone connected to him.\n\nShortly after the auction, Josh Gilbert, an artist and blacksmith, noted what he thought were a number of inconsistencies with the work shredding itself.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31967388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31967388", "title": "Media reform", "text": "Media reform\n\nMedia reform refers to proposed attempts to reform mass media towards an agenda which is more in tune with public needs and away from a perceived bias toward corporate, government or political biases. Media reform advocates also place a strong emphasis upon enabling those who are marginalized or semi-marginalized by their individual incomes, immutable characteristics or desperate conditions to possess access to means of publication and dissemination of information. They do not come from a concern with policy, or with a desire to democratize federal bureaucracies and regulations.\n\nA related concept, media justice, refers to an analytical framework and a regional, grassroots movement led by historically disenfranchised communities to transform media and cultural production, rights and policy in the service of social justice. The Media Justice Framework offers a new way to understand and redistribute media power to achieve a fair and accessible information and cultural apparatus that fulfils its promise to inform the public, watchdog power, and serve all segments of the public equally. The Movement for Media Justice believes that media production and distribution must be under the control of communities, not companies; and that achieving social justice victories requires a secondary strategy for media policy change.\n\nMedia reform movement coincides with media democracy as a concept and is interlinked with the agenda setting theory. In 1922, in his book, \"Public Opinion\", Walter Lippmann argued that the mass media are the principal connection between events in the world and the images in the minds of the public. He stated that the media has an ability to influence the thoughts and opinions of the members of public consuming the content. He did not use the term \"agenda setting\", but scholars have come to agree that was the core concept.\n\nUnder the media reform movement there is the traditional media reform movement which has its roots in the broadcasting and freedom of press movements and has been linked with the feminist movement as well as racial and gender justice. However, mainstream media reform groups have so far steered clear from acknowledging media reform’s roots in content work, including the legal victory by the United Church of Christ that forced changes in hiring and reporting practices in Mississippi television journalism. This is said to be done in order to maintain the support of conservative patrons and to downplay the importance of more controversial critical junctures that have shaped the way media reform movement is today.\n\nIt has also been affected by federal policy advocacy, whereby media outlets and governments alter their broadcasting practices to attract powerful allies and making their agenda the national public agenda. Funders provide financial support that support the media outlets and drives business.\n\nThe traditional media reform movement has however undergone some significant changes with the rise of citizen journalism, whereby citizens play an active role in the process of collecting, reporting, analyzing, and disseminating news and information. The modern media reform movement relies heavily on the Internet and the numerous social networking tools it offers and the Internet coupled with citizen curated content has led to a decrease in the popularity of traditional media networks.\n\nThe Canadian media reform movement has its roots in the 1930s, Canadian Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom. Highlighting the threats of cultural Americanisation and excessive commercialism, and calling for universal radio service that would not be viable through market forces alone, the Canadian Radio League assembled a blue-ribbon coalition to persuade a Conservative government to create the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nSome of the notable sites and advocates of the movement in Canada include thetyee.ca, the Media Co-op, Media Democracy Days, OpenMedia.ca, the Aboriginal Peoples Television and print outlets such as Canadian Dimension.\n\nLaunched in 2001 and originating in Vancouver, British Columbia, Media Democracy Days are organized around the country with the aim of knowing, being and changing the media. They encourage citizen journalism and expect netizens to take responsibility for bringing the change they wish to see in media. It is part of the Media Democracy Project that aims to create a significant presence for noncommercial media in Canada.\n\nOpenMedia.ca was created in 2007 to celebrate two of the world’s foremost critics of media propaganda, Ed Herman and Noam Chomsky, and since then it has managed to earn national resonance and policy impact. It is by far the leader in the Media Reform movement in Canada.\n\nThe movement's focus in Canada has been predominantly on the not for profit sector. There is overwhelming recognition of the importance of the Internet in NGO work, and unanimous endorsement of the principle of net neutrality as a regulatory underpinning for equitable and affordable access to the Internet. Trade unions and independent media, arts and culture groups, particularly those representing media and cultural workers, are core advocates for democratic communications. Other groups, especially those concerned with human rights, are also supportive.\n\nIn a 2010 survey by Open Media, Canadian mainstream media’s democratic performance has been rated as poor or very poor by Canadians. Although many NGOs report positive relationships with particular media, NGOs appear to have a more favorable view of CBC and of independent media, which relies heavily on citizen journalism and has led to the rise of blogger culture. An overwhelming majority of NGOs agree that the quality and diversity of Canadian journalism affects their organization’s work. There is an encouraging culture of collaboration amongst NGOs in the sectors surveyed. Values such as openness, accessibility, participation, choice, diversity and innovation may resonate well with NGOs in Canada. Media reform organizations should consider some kind of expansive institutional structure, such as an association or network that can facilitate communication and engagement with a broad and diverse array of organizations.\n\nMedia reform movement is a positive step towards a netizen curated web and has given rise to citizen journalism.\n\nCommunications guru Frank Luntz has claimed that \"A compelling story, even if factually inaccurate, can be more emotionally compelling than a dry recitation of the truth. I have seen how effective language attached to policies that are mainstream and delivered by people who are passionate and effective can change the course of history.\" Statements such as the ones by Mr. Luntz, encourage people and provide hope that we can be part of a fair and democratic media system. One that not only reports what the public wants but also tells the truth and does not use agenda setting theory for mere popularity.\n\n"}

{"id": "39489490", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39489490", "title": "Semar Gugat", "text": "Semar Gugat\n\nSemar Gugat (Indonesian for \"Semar Accuses\") is a stage play written by Nano Riantiarno for his troupe Teater Koma. It follows the traditional \"wayang\" character Semar as he attempts— and fails— to take revenge against Arjuna and Srikandi for humiliating him by cutting off a lock of his hair while they are under the influence of the demon queen Durga. Completed in mid-1995, the play consists of 559 lines of dialogue spread through 30 scenes. \"Semar Gugat\" has been read as a critique of the New Order government under president Suharto. It was first performed on 25 November 1995 after the government withheld permission for several months. After Teater Koma gave an initial two-week run, it was adapted by various amateur groups. In 1998 Riantiarno won a S.E.A. Write Award for the work.\n\nThe kingdom of Amarta is preparing for the wedding of Arjuna and Srikandi. The Punakawans—Semar, his wife Sutiragen, and their children Gareng, Petruk, and Bagong—prepare to attend the ceremony.\n\nHowever, the bride-to-be is fraught with doubt. Arjuna is already well known as a womanizer and has been with an untold number of women. She decides to test Arjuna's love by giving him a test. At this moment, Durga, the queen of demons, chooses to possess her body and, controlling Srikandi's voice, demands to see Arjuna even though tradition forbids it. With the support of Arjuna's two other wives, Sumbadra and Larasasti, she succeeds in meeting Arjuna and tells him to provide a lock (\"kuncur\") of Semar's hair as proof of his devotion. Arjuna reluctantly does the deed and the ceremony goes as scheduled. However, Semar is unable to accept the humiliation, stating that not even gods dare touch his head. The family does not attend Arjuna's wedding, despite being palace servants, and Semar cries at home for the remainder of the day. Meanwhile, Arjuna's brothers, including King Yudistira, leave the kingdom to meditate; Arjuna is left to rule over Amarta.\n\nSemar decides that he has had enough humiliation; although he is very powerful, he feels constantly abused by humans and gods. With his favourite son Bagong he goes to the palace of the gods in Kayangan. However, only Semar is admitted; Bagong is chased off by two guards. Semar speaks to the gods Batara Guru and Batara Narada and asks to regain the handsome face he had once had. This they give him, using plastic surgery. Semar is made human and given his own kingdom, Simpang Bawana Nuranitis Asri. Semar changes his name to Prabu Sanggadonya Lukanurani. Although he has become leader of his own kingdom, Semar is unable to find happiness. His wife, not believing that he is Semar, leaves him; only his sons Petruk and Gareng join him. They begin building the kingdom, but are displeased to find that all of its riches are not enough to ensure harmony.\n\nMeanwhile, in Amarta, Arjuna's leadership is causing the populace to feel miserable. Under the influence of Srikandi (who remains possessed by Durga), Arjuna focuses on economic development and increases the number of imports. He establishes monopolies on common commodities hoping to control the population and uses popular culture to promote a sense of selfless nationalism. Much of the disillusioned populace emigrates from Amarta, while others send extensive letters of protest to the palace. Those who remain are later possessed by demons under Durga's leadership, becoming prisoners in their own bodies.\n\nIn Simpang Bawana Nuranitis Asri, Larasati and Sumbadra—who have lost favour in Amarta—arrive. They meet with two warriors from Amarta, Sumbadra's son Abimanyu and his cousin Gatotkaca, who have come to tell Semar of Amarta's suffering. Unable to accept the people's suffering, Semar goes to his former homeland and challenges Arjuna and Srikandi, whom he realises has been possessed. When Semar tries to use his sacred flatulence known as \"Ajian The White Kentuts\", said to be capable of causing \"whirlwinds, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, [and] volcanic eruptions\", nothing happens. Durga laughs at Semar's impotence and lets him live, considering it the greatest humiliation possible. Petruk and Gareng join Durga, leaving Semar alone.\n\n\"Semar Gugat\" is a stage play in 30 scenes. It also features an untitled opening song and a closing song entitled \"Nyanyi Sunyi Jagat Raya\" (\"The Universe's Silent Song\"); other songs, some untitled, are interspersed in the play proper. The story features 25 speaking roles, with an unspecified number of unnamed mute characters. Its 559 lines of dialogue is focused mostly on eight characters: Semar, Gareng, Petruk, Bagong, Durga, Kalika (Durga's minion), and Srikandi.\n\nThe script was written by Nano Riantiarno, leader of Teater Koma, and completed in June 1995. It was the 78th production for Teater Koma.\n\nSemar is a character in traditional Javanese puppetry (\"wayang\"), depicted as a god who has come to Earth to serve human kings. Although he had been used by President Suharto of the New Order as symbolic of the regime, Semar is traditionally considered representative of the common people (\"wong cilik\"), as are the other Punakawans. As such, theologian J. B. Banawiratma surmises that the play is representative of the common people accusing the forces in power, be they internal or external. He writes that the power which is challenged is not that which is used for the good of the people, but power which is abused for a leader's self-interest. He further writes that the demon Durga serves as a personification of this abusive power.\n\nMuhammad Ismail Nasution of the State University of Padang concurs, suggesting that the play is a criticism of the New Order government. He notes that dialogue criticising the social realities of New Order Indonesia is generally spoken by Semar's sons and encompasses the business practices, educational policies, nepotism, and inequality found in New Order Indonesia. Quoting a line from Semar, in which he discounts his children's suggestion that Semar lead protests, Nasution also notes criticism of the youths who would demonstrate against the New Order, depicting them as being easily manipulated by \"agents provocateur\" and often needlessly destroying material goods.\n\nH. Sujiwo Tejo of \"Kompas\" writes that the performance used more modern story telling techniques, noting that changes between scenes were more stylised and quicker than in traditional \"wayang\". He also notes influences of modern dance, another departure from traditional theatre.\n\nAfter Riantiarno completed writing \"Semar Gugat\", the New Order government—which required stage plays to receive formal permission before performances could be held—held up production. Generally this was straightforward, but some playwrights reportedly faced more stringent criteria. Riantiarno, who had previously been highly critical of the government in depicting prostitutes, transsexuals, and corrupt officials in \"Opera Kecoa\" (\"The Cockroach Opera\"), was one such writer; others included Rendra and Guruh Sukarnoputra. The government only formally granted permission for the play to be performed on 24 November 1995. Owing to debate over the censorship of stage plays by the government, including \"Semar Gugat\", in 1996 the government formally rescinded the requirement; social commentators, however, remained skeptical.\n\n\"Semar Gugat\" was first performed at 800-seat Graha Bakti Budaya in Taman Ismail Marzuki, Jakarta, the day after permission was granted, by Riantiarno's Teater Koma. Tickets for the first two performances, each running three hours, sold out in advance; Tejo noted that most of the audience were not regular theatre-goers. The initial two-week run was produced by Nano's wife Ratna, with its choreography handled by Sentot S and music directed by Idrus Madani. Semar was portrayed by Budi Ros, while other roles were taken by Dudung Hadi, O'han Adiputra, Budi Suryadi, Ratna Riantiarno, Derias Pribadi, and Asmin Timbil. For his work on \"Semar Gugat\", in 1998 Nano Riantiarno received the S.E.A. Write Award from the government of Thailand.\n\nA book version of the script was published in November 1995 by Bentang Budaya in Yogyakarta, with cover design by Si Ong.

It is based on the television series of the same name, originally developed by Brian Graden for the Comedy Central television network.\n\n\"South Park\" is an American adult animated sitcom created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone and developed by Brian Graden for the Comedy Central television network. The show revolves around four boys—Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick—and their bizarre adventures in and around the titular Colorado town. Much like \"The Simpsons\", \"South Park\" uses a very large ensemble cast of recurring characters and became infamous for its profanity and dark, surreal humor that satirizes a wide range of topics towards a mature audience.\n\nThe pilot episode was produced using cutout animation, leading to all subsequent episodes being produced with computer animation that emulated the cutout technique. Parker and Stone perform most of the voice acting for the show's male characters. Since 2000, each episode has typically been written and produced in the week preceding its broadcast, with Parker serving as the primary writer and director. There have been a total of episodes over the course of the show's 22 seasons. The show's twenty-second season premiered on September 26, 2018.\n\nIn 1999, less than two years after the series first aired, a was released. The film, a musical comedy, was directed by Parker, who co-wrote the script with Stone and Pam Brady. The film was generally well received by critics, and earned a combined US$83.1 million at the domestic and foreign box office. The film satirizes the controversy surrounding the show itself and gained a spot in the 2001 edition of \"Guinness World Records\" for \"Most Swearing in an Animated Film\". The song \"Blame Canada\" from earned song co-writers Parker and Marc Shaiman an Academy Award nomination for Best Music, Original Song. \n\n\"\" was released direct-to-video in 2008 and features the three episodes from the 11th season (Imaginationland I, Imaginationland II, and Imaginationland III) merged into a compilation film. \n\nParker and Stone said in a 2008 interview that a theatrically released sequel would most likely be what concludes the series. In 2011, when asked on the official \"South Park\" website whether a sequel would be made, they said \"the first \"South Park\" movie was so potent, we're all still recovering from the blow. Unfortunately, at the current moment, there are no plans for a second \"South Park\" movie. But you never know what the future may bring, crazier things have happened...\" In 2011, \"Time\" called \"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut\" the sixth greatest animated feature of all time. In 2013, Warner Bros. Entertainment relinquished to Paramount Pictures its rights to co-finance a potential future \"South Park\" film during their negotiations to co-finance the Christopher Nolan science fiction film \"Interstellar\". Previous efforts to create a second \"South Park\" film were complicated due to both studios retaining certain rights to the property.\n\nAs a tribute to the Dead Parrot sketch, a short that features Cartman attempting to return a dead Kenny to a shop run by Kyle aired during a 1999 BBC television special commemorating the 30th anniversary of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\". \"South Park\" parodied Scientology in a short that aired as part of the 2000 MTV Movie Awards. The short was entitled \"The Gauntlet\" and also poked fun at John Travolta, a Scientologist. The four main characters were featured in the documentary film \"The Aristocrats\", listening to Cartman tell his version of the film's titular joke. Short clips of Cartman introducing the starting lineup for the University of Colorado football team were featured during ABC's coverage of the 2007 matchup between the University of Colorado and the University of Nebraska. In 2008, Parker, as Cartman, gave answers to a Proust Questionnaire conducted by Julie Rovner of NPR. The Snakes & Arrows Tour for Rush in 2007 used an intro from Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny preceding \"Tom Sawyer\". As Parker, Stone and producer Frank Agnone are Los Angeles Kings fans, special \"South Park\" pre-game videos have been featured at Kings home games at Staples Center, and the club even sent the Stanley Cup to visit South Park Studios after winning the 2012 finals. Parker and Stone have also created Denver Broncos and Denver Nuggets-themed shorts, featuring Cartman, for home games at Pepsi Center.\n\n\"\", a compilation of original songs from the show, characters performing cover songs, and tracks performed by guest artists was released in 1998, while \"Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics\", a compilation of songs performed by the characters in the episode of the same name as well as other Christmas-themed songs was released in 1999, as was the to the feature film. The song \"Chocolate Salty Balls\" (performed by Hayes as Chef) was released as a single in the UK in 1998 to support the \"Chef Aid: The South Park Album\" and became a number one hit.\n\nFollowing the early success of the series, three video games based on the series were released by Acclaim Entertainment. A first-person shooter simply titled \"South Park\" was released in 1998 for the PC, Nintendo 64, and PlayStation. This was followed in 1999 by \"\", a party video game featuring quizzes and mini-games, on the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC. In 2000, \"South Park Rally\", a racing game, was released on the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC. Parker and Stone had little to do with the development of these games, apart from providing voice acting, and have publicly criticized Acclaim and the quality of the \"South Park\" games they produced.\n\nThere was a \"South Park\" game for the Game Boy Color in development at Acclaim but it was cancelled by Parker and Stone because they thought the game was not right for the system as the main demographic was kids. Parker and Stone have the prototype cartridge of the game, making it the first \"South Park\" video game ever made. Only one screenshot was published in \"Nintendo Power\" issue 114 in 1998. A ROM file for the game, in a complete state, was leaked online in August 2018.\n\nAnother \"South Park\" game was in development for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube in 2004 but was cancelled for unknown reasons. A prototype of the game was found in an Xbox development kit in 2015.\n\nIn 2010, the decision was made to form a small group called South Park Digital Studios, which would, among other things, work on creating new \"South Park\" games, that would involve the studio and the show's creators more heavily. The first such title is \"South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!\", a tower defense game developed by Doublesix, which was released in 2009 for the Xbox Live Arcade service on the Xbox 360 console. Another Xbox Live Arcade game, \"\", is a platformer which was released in the spring of 2012. \"\" is a role-playing video game that was written by Parker and Stone, and was originally scheduled to be released on March 5, 2013 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles, and Microsoft Windows. The game was eventually released a year later in March 2014 to positive reviews. A sequel to \"The Stick of Truth\", \"\", was released in October 2017 with similarly good reception. A mobile game, \"'\", was released for Android and iOS in November 2017.\n\nMerchandising related to the show is an industry which generates several million dollars a year. In 1998, the top-selling specialty T-shirt in the United States was based on \"South Park\", and US$30 million in T-shirt sales was reached during the show's first season.\n\nA \"South Park\" pinball machine was released in 1999 by Sega Pinball. The companies Fun 4 All, Mezco Toyz, and Mirage have produced various South Park action figures, collectibles, and plush dolls.\n\nComedy Central entered into an agreement with Frito-Lay to sell 1.5 million bags of Cheesy Poofs, Cartman's favorite snack from the show, at Walmart until the premiere of the second half of the fifteenth season on October 5, 2011.\n"}

After traveling the country he was inspired by the street performance work of the Radical Faeries and the Bread and Puppet Theater in Glover, Vermont. On his return to Philadelphia, Hart founded \"Spiral Q\" as a way to use his newfound interest in puppetry, street theatre and pageantry to promote social and political change. To this day, Spiral Q seeks to bring the storytelling techniques of giant puppetry, pageantry, and toy theater to the urban backdrop of Philadelphia.\n\nInitially, Spiral Q was a shadow puppet theater that staged performances throughout the community. Local activist groups came to Hart to make puppets, props and effigies for demonstrations and educational campaigns. Spiral Q's identity springs from this early work in Philadelphia's HIV/AIDS activist and queer communities, particularly with AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power (ACT UP). In 1997 and 1998 Hart organized the week-long \"Full-On Puppet Festival\" in Philadelphia. showcasing puppeteers from around the country. Spiral Q also organized an annual Day of the Dead parade on South Street up through 1999. Both the festival and the parade were set aside so that the organization could focus on community activism.\n\nWorkshops with a local children's garden led to another model of community performance with children and adults carrying giant puppets that they created in parades and pageants. In 2000 Spiral Q started an annual citywide parade and pageant called \"Peoplehood\". Each October the parade starts at the Paul Robeson House and ends in Clark Park. In addition to neighborhood parades and pageants such as Peoplehood, Philadelphians can get involved with Spiral Q through its Justice Works Program and Education Initiatives.\n\nSince 2000, the theater has been located in the East Mantua section of West Philadelphia. Hart left the company he founded in 2003 to pursue other interests.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36937", "title": "Television network", "text": "Television network\n\nA television network is a telecommunications network for distribution of television program content, whereby a central operation provides programming to many television stations or pay television providers. Until the mid-1980s, television programming in most countries of the world was dominated by a small number of broadcast networks. Many early television networks (such as the BBC, NBC or CBC) evolved from earlier radio networks.\n\nIn countries where most networks broadcast identical, centrally originated content to all of their stations and where most individual television transmitters therefore operate only as large \"repeater stations\", the terms \"television network\", \"television channel\" (a numeric identifier or radio frequency) and \"television station\" have become mostly interchangeable in everyday language, with professionals in television-related occupations continuing to make a differentiation between them. Within the industry, a tiering is sometimes created among groups of networks based on whether their programming is simultaneously originated from a central point, and whether the network master control has the technical and administrative capability to take over the programming of their affiliates in real-time when it deems this necessary – the most common example being during national breaking news events.\n\nIn North America in particular, many television networks available via cable and satellite television are branded as \"channels\" because they are somewhat different from traditional networks in the sense defined above, as they are singular operations – they have no affiliates or component stations, but instead are distributed to the public via cable or direct-broadcast satellite providers. Such networks are commonly referred to by terms such as \"specialty channels\" in Canada or \"cable networks\" in the U.S.\n\nA network may or may not produce all of its own programming. If not, production companies (such as Warner Bros. and Sony Pictures Television) can distribute their content to the various networks, and it is common that a certain production firm may have programs that air on two or more rival networks. Similarly, some networks may import television programs from other countries, or use archived programming to help complement their schedules.\n\nSome stations have the capability to interrupt the network through the local insertion of television commercials, station identifications and emergency alerts. Others completely break away from the network for their own programming, a method known as regional variation. This is common where small networks are members of larger networks. The majority of commercial television stations are self-owned, even though a variety of these instances are the property of an owned-and-operated television network. The commercial television stations can also be linked with a noncommercial educational broadcasting agency. It is also important to note that some countries have launched national television networks, so that individual television stations can act as common repeaters of nationwide programs.\n\nOn the other hand, television networks also undergo the impending experience of major changes related to cultural varieties. The emergence of cable television has made available in major media markets, programs such as those aimed at American bi-cultural Latinos. Such a diverse captive audience presents an occasion for the networks and affiliates to advertise the best programming that needs to be aired.\n\nThis is explained by author Tim P. Vos in his abstract \"A Cultural Explanation of Early Broadcast\", where he determines targeted group/non-targeted group representations as well as the cultural specificity employed in the television network entity. Vos notes that policymakers did not expressly intend to create a broadcast order dominated by commercial networks. In fact, legislative attempts were made to limit the network's preferred position.\n\nAs to individual stations, modern network operations centers usually use broadcast automation to handle most tasks. These systems are not only used for programming and for video server playout, but use exact atomic time from Global Positioning Systems or other sources to maintain perfect synchronization with upstream and downstream systems, so that programming appears seamless to viewers.\n\nA major international television network is the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), which is perhaps most well known for its news agency BBC News. Owned by the Crown, the BBC operates primarily in the United Kingdom. It is funded by the television licence paid by British residents that watch terrestrial television and as a result, no commercial advertising appears on its networks. Outside the UK, advertising is broadcast because the licence fee only applies to the BBC's British operations. 23,000 people worldwide are employed by the BBC and its subsidiary, BBC Studios.\n\nTelevision in the United States had long been dominated by the Big Three television networks, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), CBS (formerly the Columbia Broadcasting System) and the National Broadcasting Company (NBC); however the Fox Broadcasting Company (Fox), which launched in October 1986, has gained prominence and is now considered part of the \"Big Four.\" The Big Three provide a significant amount of programs to each of their affiliates, including newscasts, prime time, daytime and sports programming, but still reserve periods during each day where their affiliate can air local programming, such as local news or syndicated programs. Since the creation of Fox, the number of American television networks has increased, though the amount of programming they provide is often much less: for example, The CW Television Network only provides twelve hours of primetime programming each week (along with six hours on Saturdays and five hours a week during the daytime), leaving its affiliates to fill time periods where network programs are not broadcast with a large amount of syndicated programming. Other networks are dedicated to specialized programming, such as religious content or programs presented in languages other than English, particularly Spanish.\n\nThe largest television network in the United States, however, is the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), a non-profit, publicly owned, non-commercial educational service. In comparison to the commercial television networks, there is no central unified arm of broadcast programming, meaning that each PBS member station has a significant amount of freedom to schedule television shows as they consent to. Some public television outlets, such as PBS, carry separate digital subchannel networks through their member stations (for example, Georgia Public Broadcasting; in fact, some programs airing on PBS were branded on other channels as coming from GPB Kids and PBS World).\n\nThis works as each network sends its signal to many local affiliated television stations across the country. These local stations then carry the \"network feed,\" which can be viewed by millions of households across the country. In such cases, the signal is sent to as many as 200+ stations or as little as just a dozen or fewer stations, depending on the size of the network.\n\nWith the adoption of digital television, television networks have also been created specifically for distribution on the digital subchannels of television stations (including networks focusing on classic television series and films operated by companies like Weigel Broadcasting (owners of Movies! and Me-TV) and Tribune Broadcasting (owners of This TV and Antenna TV), along with networks focusing on music, sports and other niche programming).\n\nCable and satellite providers pay the networks a certain rate per subscriber (the highest charge being for ESPN, in which cable and satellite providers pay a rate of more than $5.00 per subscriber to ESPN). The providers also handle the sale of advertising inserted at the local level during national programming, in which case the broadcaster and the cable/satellite provider may share revenue. Networks that maintain a home shopping or infomercial format may instead pay the station or cable/satellite provider, in a brokered carriage deal. This is especially common with low-power television stations, and in recent years, even more so for stations that used this revenue stream to finance their conversion to digital broadcasts, which in turn provides them with several additional channels to transmit different programming sources.\n\nTelevision broadcasting in the United States was heavily influenced by radio. Early individual experimental radio stations in the United States began limited operations in the 1910s. In November 1920, Westinghouse signed on \"the world's first commercially licensed radio station\", KDKA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Other companies built early radio stations in Detroit, Boston, New York City and other areas. Radio stations received permission to transmit through broadcast licenses obtained through the Federal Radio Commission (FRC), a government entity that was created in 1926 to regulate the radio industry. With few exceptions, radio stations east of the Mississippi River received official call signs beginning with the letter \"W\"; those west of the Mississippi were assigned calls beginning with a \"K\". The amount of programs that these early stations aired was often limited, in part due to the expense of program creation. The idea of a network system which would distribute programming to many stations simultaneously, saving each station the expense of creating all of their own programs and expanding the total coverage beyond the limits of a single broadcast signal, was devised.\n\nNBC set up the first permanent coast-to-coast radio network in the United States by 1928, using dedicated telephone line technology. The network physically linked individual radio stations, nearly all of which were independently owned and operated, in a vast chain, NBC's audio signal thus transmitted from station to station to listeners across the United States. Other companies, including CBS and the Mutual Broadcasting System, soon followed suit, each network signed hundreds of individual stations on as affiliates: stations which agreed to broadcast programs from one of the networks.\n\nAs radio prospered throughout the 1920s and 1930s, experimental television stations, which broadcast both an audio and a video signal, began sporadic broadcasts. Licenses for these experimental stations were often granted to experienced radio broadcasters, and thus advances in television technology closely followed breakthroughs in radio technology. As interest in television grew, and as early television stations began regular broadcasts, the idea of networking television signals (sending one station's video and audio signal to outlying stations) was born. However, the signal from an electronic television system, containing much more information than a radio signal, required a broadband transmission medium. Transmission by a nationwide series of radio relay towers would be possible but extremely expensive.\n\nResearchers at AT&T subsidiary Bell Telephone Laboratories patented coaxial cable in 1929, primarily as a telephone improvement device. Its high capacity (transmitting 240 telephone calls simultaneously) also made it ideal for long-distance television transmission, where it could handle a frequency band of 1 MHz. German television first demonstrated such an application in 1936 by relaying televised telephone calls from Berlin to Leipzig, away, by cable.\n\nAT&T laid the first L-carrier coaxial cable between New York City and Philadelphia, with automatic signal booster stations every , and in 1937 it experimented with transmitting televised motion pictures over the line. Bell Labs gave demonstrations of the New York–Philadelphia television link in 1940 and 1941. AT&T used the coaxial link to transmit the Republican National Convention in June 1940 from Philadelphia to New York City, where it was televised to a few hundred receivers over the NBC station W2XBS (which evolved into WNBC) as well as seen in Schenectady, New York via W2XB (which evolved into WRGB) via off-air relay from the New York station.\n\nNBC had earlier demonstrated an inter-city television broadcast on February 1, 1940, from its station in New York City to another in Schenectady, New York by General Electric relay antennas, and began transmitting some programs on an irregular basis to Philadelphia and Schenectady in 1941. Wartime priorities suspended the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from April 1, 1942 to October 1, 1945, temporarily shutting down expansion of television networking. However, in 1944 a short film, \"Patrolling the Ether\", was broadcast simultaneously over three stations as an experiment.\nAT&T made its first postwar addition in February 1946, with the completion of a cable between New York City and Washington, D.C., although a blurry demonstration broadcast showed that it would not be in regular use for several months. The DuMont Television Network, which had begun experimental broadcasts before the war, launched what \"Newsweek\" called \"the country's first permanent commercial television network\" on August 15, 1946, connecting New York City with Washington. Not to be outdone, NBC launched what it called \"the world's first regularly operating television network\" on June 27, 1947, serving New York City, Philadelphia, Schenectady and Washington. Baltimore and Boston were added to the NBC television network in late 1947. DuMont and NBC would be joined by CBS and ABC in 1948.\n\nIn the 1940s, the term \"chain broadcasting\" was used when discussing network broadcasts, as the television stations were linked together in long chains along the East Coast. But as the television networks expanded westward, the interconnected television stations formed major networks of connected affiliate stations. In January 1949, with the sign-on of DuMont's WDTV in Pittsburgh, the Midwest and East Coast networks were finally connected by coaxial cable (with WDTV airing the best shows from all four networks). By 1951, the four networks stretched from coast to coast, carried on the new microwave radio relay network of AT&T Long Lines. Only a few local television stations remained independent of the networks.\n\nEach of the four major television networks originally only broadcast a few hours of programs a week to their affiliate stations, mostly between 8:00 and 11:00 p.m. Eastern Time, when most viewers were watching television. Most of the programs broadcast by the television stations were still locally produced. As the networks increased the number of programs that they aired, however, officials at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) grew concerned that local television might disappear altogether. Eventually, the federal regulator enacted the Prime Time Access Rule, which restricted the amount of time that the networks could air programs; officials hoped that the rules would foster the development of quality local programs, but in practice, most local stations did not want to bear the burden of producing many of their own programs, and instead chose to purchase programs from independent producers. Sales of television programs to individual local stations are done through a method called \"broadcast syndication,\" and today nearly every television station in the United States obtains syndicated programs in addition to network-produced fare.\n\nLate in the 20th century, cross-country microwave radio relays were replaced by fixed-service satellites. Some terrestrial radio relays remained in service for regional connections.\n\nAfter the failure and shutdown of DuMont in 1956, several attempts at new networks were made between the 1950s and the 1970s, with little success. The Fox Broadcasting Company, founded by the Rupert Murdoch-owned News Corporation (now owned by 21st Century Fox), was launched on October 9, 1986 after the company purchased the television assets of Metromedia; it would eventually ascend to the status of the fourth major network by 1994. Two other networks launched within a week of one another in January 1995: The WB Television Network, a joint venture between Time Warner and the Tribune Company, and the United Paramount Network (UPN), formed through a programming alliance between Chris-Craft Industries and Paramount Television (whose parent, Viacom, would later acquire half and later all of the network over the course of its existence). In September 2006, The CW was launched as a \"merger\" of The WB and UPN (in actuality, a consolidation of each respective network's higher-rated programs onto one schedule); MyNetworkTV, a network formed from affiliates of UPN and The WB that did not affiliate with The CW, launched at the same time.\n\nFCC regulations in the United States restricted the number of television stations that could be owned by any one network, company or individual. This led to a system where most local television stations were independently owned, but received programming from the network through a franchising contract, except in a few major cities that had owned-and-operated stations (O&O) of a network and independent stations. In the early days of television, when there were often only one or two stations broadcasting in a given market, the stations were usually affiliated with multiple networks and were able to choose which programs would air. Eventually, as more stations were licensed, it became common for each station to be exclusively affiliated with only one network and carry all of the \"prime-time\" programs that the network offered. Local stations occasionally break from regularly scheduled network programming however, especially when a breaking news or severe weather situation occurs in the viewing area. Moreover, when stations return to network programming from commercial breaks, station identifications are displayed in the first few seconds before switching to the network's logo.\n\nA number of different definitions of \"network\" are used by government agencies, industry, and the general public. Under the Broadcasting Act, a network is defined as \"any operation where control over all or any part of the programs or program schedules of one or more broadcasting undertakings is delegated to another undertaking or person,\" and must be licensed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).\n\nOnly three national over-the-air television networks are currently licensed by the CRTC: government-owned CBC Television (English) and Ici Radio-Canada Télé (French), French-language private network TVA, and a network focused on Canada's indigenous peoples. A third French-language service, V, is licensed as a provincial network within Quebec, but is not licensed or locally distributed (outside of carriage on the digital tiers of pay television providers) on a national basis.\n\nCurrently, licensed national or provincial networks must be carried by all cable providers (in the country or province, respectively) with a service area above a certain population threshold, as well as all satellite providers. However, they are no longer necessarily expected to achieve over-the-air coverage in all areas (APTN, for example, only has terrestrial coverage in parts of northern Canada).\n\nIn addition to these licensed networks, the two main private English-language over-the-air services, CTV and Global, are also generally considered to be \"networks\" by virtue of their national coverage, although they are not officially licensed as such. CTV was previously a licensed network, but relinquished this licence in 2001 after acquiring most of its affiliates, making operating a network licence essentially redundant (per the above definition).\n\nSmaller groups of stations with common branding are often categorized by industry watchers as television systems, although the public and the broadcasters themselves will often refer to them as \"networks\" regardless. Some of these systems, such as CTV Two and the now-defunct E!, essentially operate as mini-networks, but have reduced geographical coverage. Others, such as Omni Television or the Crossroads Television System, have similar branding and a common programming focus, but schedules may vary significantly from one station to the next. Citytv originally began operating as a television system in 2002 when CKVU-TV in Vancouver started to carry programs originating from CITY-TV in Toronto and adopted that station's \"Citytv\" branding, but gradually became a network by virtue of national coverage through expansions into other markets west of Atlantic Canada between 2005 and 2013.\n\nMost local television stations in Canada are now owned and operated directly by their network, with only a small number of stations still operating as affiliates.\n\nMost television services outside North America are national networks established by a combination of publicly funded broadcasters and commercial broadcasters. Most nations established television networks in a similar way: the first television service in each country was operated by a public broadcaster, often funded by a television licensing fee, and most of them later established a second or even third station providing a greater variety of content. Commercial television services also became available when private companies applied for television broadcasting licenses. Often, each new network would be identified with their channel number, so that individual stations would often be numbered \"One,\" \"Two,\" \"Three,\" and so forth.\n\nThe first television network in the United Kingdom was operated by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). On 2 November 1936 the BBC opened the world's first regular high-definition television service, from a 405 lines transmitter at Alexandra Palace. The BBC remained dominant until eventually on 22 September 1955, commercial broadcasting was established in order to create a second television network. Rather than creating a single network with local stations owned and operated by a single company (as is the case with the BBC), each local area had a separate television station that was independently owned and operated, although most of these stations shared a number of programmes, particularly during peak evening viewing hours. These stations formed the ITV network.\n\nWhen the advent of UHF broadcasting allowed a greater number of television stations to broadcast, the BBC launched a second network, BBC Two (with the original service being renamed BBC One). A fourth national commercial service was launched, Channel 4, although Wales instead introduced a Welsh-language service, S4C. These were later followed by the launch of a fifth network, Channel 5. Since the introduction of digital television, the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 each introduced a number of digital-only networks. Sky operates a large number of networks including Sky One, Sky Living and Sky Atlantic; as does UKTV, which operates networks like Dave, Gold, W and Yesterday.\n\nSweden had only one television network until the early-1990s: the public broadcaster Sveriges Television (SVT). Commercial companies such as Modern Times Group, TV4, Viasat, and SBS Discovery have established TV networks since the 1980s although they initially aired exclusively on satellite. In 1991, TV4 became Sweden's first commercial television network to air terrestrially. Most television programming in Sweden is centralised except for local news updates that air on SVT1 and TV4.\n\nUntil 1989, Netherlands Public Broadcasting was the only television network in the Netherlands, with three stations, Nederland 1, Nederland 2 and Nederland 3. Rather than having a single production arm, there are a number of public broadcasting organizations that create programming for each of the three stations, each working relatively independently. Commercial broadcasting in the Netherlands is currently operated by two networks, RTL Nederland and SBS Broadcasting, which together broadcast seven commercial stations.\n\nThe first television network in the Soviet Union launched on 7 July 1938 when Petersburg – Channel 5 of Leningrad Television became a unionwide network.\nThe second television network in the Soviet Union launched on 22 March 1951 when Channel One of USSR Central Television became a unionwide network. Until 1989, there were six television networks, all owned by the USSR Gosteleradio. This changed during Mikhail Gorbachev's Perestroika program, when the first independent television network, 2×2, was launched.\n\nFollowing the breakup of the Soviet Union, USSR Gosteleradio ceased to exist as well as its six networks. Only Channel One had a smooth transition and survived as a network, becoming Ostankino Channel One. The other five networks were operated by Ground Zero. This free airwave space allowed many private television networks like NTV and TV-6 to launch in the mid-1990s.\n\nThe 2000s were marked by the increased state intervention in Russian television. On April 14, 2001 NTV experienced management changes following the expulsion of former oligarch and NTV founder Vladimir Gusinsky. As a result, most of the prominent reporters featured on NTV left the network. Later on January 22, 2002, the second largest private television network TV-6, where the former NTV staff took refuge, was shut down allegedly because of its editorial policy. Five months later on June 1, TVS was launched, mostly employing NTV/TV-6 staff, only to cease operations the following year. Since then, the four largest television networks (Channel One, Russia 1, NTV and Russia 2) have been state-owned.\n\nStill, the 2000s saw a rise of several independent television networks such as REN (its coverage increased vastly allowing it to become a federal network), Petersburg – Channel Five (overall the same), the relaunched 2×2. The Russian television market is mainly shared today by five major companies: Channel One, Russia 1, NTV, TNT and CTC.\n\nThe major commercial television network in Brazil is Rede Globo, which was founded in 1965. It grew to become the largest and most successful media conglomerate in the country, having a dominating presence in various forms of media including television, radio, print (newspapers and magazines) and the Internet.\n\nOther networks include Rede Bandeirantes, RecordTV, SBT, RedeTV!, and TV Cultura.\n\nAustralia has two national public networks, ABC Television and SBS. The ABC operates eight stations as part of its main network ABC1, one for each state and territory, as well as three digital-only networks, ABC2, ABC3 and ABC News 24. SBS currently operates two stations, SBS One and SBS Two.\n\nThe first commercial networks in Australia involved commercial stations that shared programming in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and later Perth, with each network forming networks based on their allocated channel numbers: TCN-9 in Sydney, GTV-9 in Melbourne, QTQ-9 in Brisbane, NWS-9 in Adelaide and STW-9 in Perth together formed the Nine Network; while their equivalents on VHF channels 7 and 10 respectively formed the Seven Network and Network Ten. Until 1989, areas outside these main cities had access to only a single commercial station, and these rural stations often formed small networks such as Prime Television. Beginning in 1989, however, television markets in rural areas began to aggregate, allowing these rural networks to broadcast over a larger area, often an entire state, and become full-time affiliates to one specific metropolitan network.\n\nAs well as these Free-to-air channels, there are other's on Australia's Pay television network Foxtel.\n\nNew Zealand has one public network, Television New Zealand (TVNZ), which consists of two main networks: TVNZ 1 is the network's flagship network which carries news, current affairs and sports programming as well as the majority of the locally produced shows broadcast by TVNZ and imported shows. TVNZ's second network, TV2, airs mostly imported shows with some locally produced programs such as \"Shortland Street\". TVNZ also operates a network exclusive to pay television services, TVNZ Heartland, available on providers such as Sky. TVNZ previously operated a non-commercial public service network, TVNZ 7, which ceased operations in June 2012 and was replaced by the timeshift channel TV One Plus 1. The network operated by Television New Zealand has progressed from operating as four distinct local stations within the four main centers in the 1960s, to having the majority of the content produced from TVNZ's Auckland studios at present.\n\nNew Zealand also has several privately owned television networks with the largest being operated by MediaWorks. MediaWorks' flagship network is TV3, which competes directly with both TVNZ broadcast networks. MediaWorks also operates a second network, FOUR, which airs mostly imported programmes with children's shows airing in the daytime and shows targeted at teenagers and adult between 15 and 39 years of age during prime time. MediaWorks also operates a timeshift network, TV3 + 1, and a 24-hour music network, C4.\n\nAll relevision networks in New Zealand air the same programming across the entire country with the only regional deviations being for local advertising; a regional news service existed in the 1980s, carrying a regional news programme from TVNZ's studios in New Zealand's four largest cities, Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.\n\nIn the 1960s, the service operated at the time by the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation was four separate television stations – AKTV2 in Auckland, WNTV1 in Wellington, CHTV3 in Christchurch and DNTV2 in Dunedin – which each ran their own newscast and produced some in-house programmes, with other shows being shared between the stations. Programmes and news footage were distributed via mail, with a programme airing in one region being mailed to another region for broadcast the following week. A network was finally established in 1969, with the same programmes being relayed to all regions simultaneously. From the 1970s to the 1990s, locally produced programmes that aired on TV One and TV2 were produced out of one of the four main studios, with TVNZ's network hub based in Wellington. Today, most locally produced programmes that are aired by both TVNZ and other networks are not actually produced in-house, instead they are often produced by a third party company (for example, the TV2 programme \"Shortland Street\" is produced by South Pacific Pictures). The networks produce their own news and current affairs programs, with most of the content filmed in Auckland.\n\nNew Zealand also operates several regional television stations, which are only available in individual markets. The regional stations will typically air a local news programme, produce some shows in-house and cover local sports events; the majority of programming on the regional stations will be imported from various sources.\n\nIn the Philippines, in practice, the terms \"network,\" \"station\" and \"channel\" are used interchangeably as programming lineups are mostly centrally planned from the networks' main offices, and since provincial/regional stations usually just relay the broadcast from their parent network's flagship station (usually based in the Mega Manila area). As such, networks made up of VHF stations are sometimes informally referred to by their over-the-air channel number in the Mega Manila area (for example, Channel 2 or \"Dos\" for ABS-CBN, Channel 5 or \"Singko\" for TV5, and Channel 7 or \"Siyete\" for GMA Network), while some incorporate their channel numbers in the network's name (for example, TV5, Studio 23 and Net 25, which respectively broadcast on VHF channel 5, and UHF channels 23 and 25).\n\nUnlike the United States, where networks receive programmes produced by various production companies, the two largest networks in the Philippines produce all of their prime time programmes except for Asianovelas. Other networks adopt block-time programming, which utilizes programming arrangements similar to the relationship between a U.S. network and station.\n\n"}
{"id": "408523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=408523", "title": "The Little Mermaid (TV series)", "text": "The Little Mermaid (TV series)\n\nDisney's The Little Mermaid is an American animated television series produced by Walt Disney Television Animation based on the 1989 Disney film of the same name. It features the adventures of Ariel as a mermaid prior to the events of the film. This series is the first Disney television series to be spun off from a major animated film. Some of the voice actors of the film reprise their roles in the series, among them Jodi Benson as Ariel, Samuel E. Wright as Sebastian, Kenneth Mars as King Triton and Pat Carroll as Ursula. Other voice actors include Edan Gross and Bradley Pierce as Flounder, and Jeff Bennett as Prince Eric.\n\n\"The Little Mermaid\" premiered in the fall of 1992 with the animated prime time special called \"A Whale of a Tale\", then moved to Saturday mornings. This series originally appeared on CBS, with an original run from 1992 to 1994 (prior to Disney's purchase of rival ABC). Disney Channel reran the series from October 2nd, 1995 to September 7th, 2002 and again from September 5th, 2006, to July 4th, 2010. Some of the episodes contain musical segments, featuring original songs written for the series. The opening theme to the show is an instrumental combination of the songs \"Part of Your World\", \"Under the Sea\" and \"Kiss the Girl\". The overture for the stage musical of \"The Little Mermaid\" is similar to this.\n\n\"The Little Mermaid\" television series is a prequel to the movie of the same name. The story is set before the events in the 1989 film, and follows Ariel's adventures as a mermaid still living under the sea with her father, Sebastian the crab and Flounder the fish. Various episodes highlight her relationships with her friends, father and sisters, and usually involve Ariel foiling the attempts of various enemies that intend ill harm to her or her kingdom. A prequel film, \"\", was released in 2008 containing events that contradict the television series (such as Ariel's youth and first meeting with Flounder), making the TV series and \"Ariel's Beginning\" independent continuities.\n\nAfter the success of the 1989 movie, The Walt Disney Company planned to produce a children's television series for its Disney Channel cable outlet called \"The Little Mermaid's Island.\" The proposed series would feature puppets from Jim Henson's Creature Shop interacting with a \"live\" Ariel. As the video release of \"The Little Mermaid\" soared in sales during 1990 and early 1991, Disney quietly dropped plans for \"The Little Mermaid's Island\" in favor of a more ambitious plan: an animated weekly series for the CBS network. The new show would concern the adventures of Ariel and her friends before the events in the movie.\n\nJamie Mitchell, an artist and graphic designer who worked on \"Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears\", was named the producer and director of the new series. Patsy Cameron and Tedd Anasti were the story editors and wrote almost all of the episodes for the show's second and third seasons. Their previous joint work included Hanna-Barbera's \"The Smurfs\", the animated \"Beetlejuice\" and Disney's \"DuckTales\". Some of the artists and technicians on the feature film also contributed to the TV series. Mark Dindal, chief of special animated effects for the movie, was a consultant for special effects on the TV show. Robby Merkin, who worked with Alan Menken and Howard Ashman on arranging the songs for the movie, worked as the arranger and music producer for the first season of the TV show.\n\nConscious of the worldwide acclaim for the movie's superior artistry, Walt Disney Television Animation auditioned the best overseas animation studios. In the world of TV animation, farming most of the artwork out to Asian studios is an economic reality due to lower production costs and wages abroad. Studios in Korea, Japan and the Philippines contributed to the series.\n\nThe show's broadcast debut in September 1992 was in the form of a half-hour prime-time special, \"The Little Mermaid: A Whale of a Tale.\" \n\nIts Saturday morning debut came the very next day. The show's time slot was 8:30 a.m., following another new animated series, \"Fievel's American Tails\", based on the animated movie \"An American Tail\". \"The Little Mermaid\" series drew a fair bit of media attention, including more than one spot on Entertainment Tonight, because it was the first series based directly on a Disney animated feature and was a rare television cartoon concerning a strong female character. The show kept its time slot the following year with its second season.\n\nFor the series' third season, the show was moved to the 8 a.m. time period and was the lead-in for a new Disney animated series, \"Aladdin\". This was to be the show's last season in original production; CBS elected not to buy another batch of episodes. On October 2, 1995, Disney Channel began rerunning the show seven days a week. The show was broadcast on Disney Channel until 2010.It was also shown on Toon Disney until 2007. The series then aired on Disney Junior from the channel's launch in 2012 until 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe series had a total of 31 episodes over three seasons. The first episode, \"Whale of a Tale\", has Ariel adopting Spot, a baby killer whale, when he is separated from his family. The episode \"The Evil Manta\" features a flashback to Ariel and Flounder's first meeting when they were younger, and the episode \"Red\" has King Triton magically reverting into a merboy, which gives Ariel a glimpse of how her father used to be when he was younger, and that they aren't so different after all.\n\nIn the episode \"Metal Fish\" Ariel saves a human, Hans Christian Andersen, who is loosely based on the real life author of the original \"The Little Mermaid\", and the encounter inspired the character to \"write\" the story of \"The Little Mermaid\". A voice-over at the end of the episode by Kenneth Mars, who voices King Triton, talks about the real Hans Christian Andersen, while the image on-screen is of Ariel sitting on a rock in the style of the Little Mermaid statue in Copenhagen harbor. This meta situation is repeated in \"The Legend of Tarzan\" episode \"Tarzan and the Mysterious Visitor\" where Tarzan meets his author Edgar Rice Burroughs who travels to Africa in search of inspiration for a new novel.\n\nSongs (In chronological order)\n\n\nMusic CD Album Release:\nSeven VHS cassettes containing 14 episodes of the series were released in the United States.\n\nAriel's Undersea Adventures:\nPrincess Collection:\nEleven VHS cassettes containing 22 episodes of the series were released in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nAriel's Undersea Adventures:\nPrincess Collection:\nThe series has not yet been officially released on DVD. However, four episodes were released as part of the \"Disney Princess\" DVD releases.\nAs of August 24, all 31 episodes of the series is available for purchase on iTunes in two volumes.\n\nFrom the series, was made into a spin-off as segment of the \"Marsupilami\" series, starring Sebastian the crab, which is located outside the sea after the wedding between Ariel and Eric in the film.\n\n"}
{"id": "3722688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3722688", "title": "The Muppets Studio", "text": "The Muppets Studio\n\nThe Muppets Studio, LLC, formerly The Muppets Holding Company, LLC, is a wholly owned entertainment subsidiary of Walt Disney Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products, formed in 2004 through The Walt Disney Company's acquisition of The Muppets and \"Bear in the Big Blue House\" intellectual properties from The Jim Henson Company.\n\nIn the late-1980s, Jim Henson had been in talks with Disney CEO Michael Eisner to sell Jim Henson Productions to the Walt Disney Company. In August 1989, the two officially announced a deal for Disney to purchase Jim Henson Productions for $150 million. The deal fell through several months after Jim Henson's death in 1990.\n\nDespite the collapse of the merger deal, by 1992, Disney and Jim Henson Productions had already struck a number of deals:\n\nThe Henson family subsequently sold the entirety of the Jim Henson Company to German conglomerate EM.TV in 2000. In 2003, the Henson family repurchased The Jim Henson Company from EM.TV.\n\nEisner, still interested in the Muppet properties, re-opened negotiations with the Hensons and announced the purchase of \"The Muppets\" and \"Bear in the Big Blue House\" assets from The Jim Henson Company for $75 million on February 17, 2004. The acquired Muppet assets were then placed into The Muppets Holding Company with Chris Curtin as general manager within Disney Consumer Products. A new website was launched in November 2004 and the Muppets made an appearance on the 2004 Christmas episode of \"Saturday Night Live\".\n\nThe first Muppet production under full Disney control, \"The Muppets' Wizard of Oz\", went into production immediately and aired on ABC in May 2005. On July 30, 2005, Animal and Pepe the King Prawn made appearance on The X Games 11 Preview show of All Access on ESPN2. Bear's first appearance under Disney's control was in the reality show, \"Breakfast With Bear\" in 2005.\n\nA fiftieth birthday tour for Kermit, \"Kermit's World Tour\" was planned with leadership changes made just days before the tour began. The tour made its initial three stops before being canceled: Kermit, Texas, Johnson Space Center tour and cake with The Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall, NYC. Following Eisner's exit from Disney, new CEO Bob Iger removed the head of the Muppets Holding Company and several senior staff members hand-picked by Eisner. The Muppets Holding Company was then paired with Baby Einstein (before it was acquired by Kids II, Inc. in 2013) under Senior Vice President and General Manager R. Russell Hampton, Jr.\n\nABC, in October 2005, commissioned \"America's Next Muppet\", a script and five script outlines, but ABC was reluctant to green light \"America's Next Muppet\", and it never got out of the planning stage. Muppet Holding's new general manager instead licensed the Muppets out to TF1, a French television network, to produce \"Muppet TV\" in September 2006.\n\nIn 2006, the Muppets Holding Company was transferred from the Disney Consumer Products unit to The Walt Disney Studios; with studio executives passing on oversight, the unit was placed in the special events group. That same year, Disney contracted with Puppet Heap to rebuild, maintain, and create puppet characters for the Muppets Studio. In April 2007, the Muppets Holding Company changed its name to The Muppets Studio under new leadership by Special Events Group SVP Lylle Breier.\n\nIn 2008, The Muppets Studio began a licensing agreement with F.A.O. Schwarz, to create a Muppet-themed boutique where customers can design their own Muppet. In 2013, Disney Theatrical Productions revealed that a show based on The Muppets was in active development and that a 15-minute show had been conducted by Thomas Schumacher to see how the technical components would work out.\n\nThe company was transferred in 2014 to Disney's new media unit, Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media, specifically DCPI Labs. On April 3, 2015, a series of shorts named \"Muppets Moments\" premiered on Disney Junior. The series features conversations between the Muppets and young children. By April, Bill Prady was commissioned to write a script for a new Muppets pilot with the title \"The Muppets\". A reboot of the Muppets is planned as of February 21, 2018, for Disney+ to be run by BAMTech and scheduled to be launched in 2019.\n\nDisney Consumer Products and Interactive Media became part of Walt Disney Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products in a March 2018 company reorganization.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "285360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=285360", "title": "The Stainless Steel Rat", "text": "The Stainless Steel Rat\n\nJames Bolivar diGriz, alias \"Slippery Jim\" and \"The Stainless Steel Rat\", is a fictional character and the antihero of a series of comic science fiction novels written by Harry Harrison.\n\nJames Bolivar diGriz goes by many aliases, including \"Slippery Jim\" and \"The Stainless Steel Rat\". He is a futuristic con man, thief, and all-round rascal. He is charming and quick-witted. He is also a master of disguise and martial arts, an accomplished bank robber, a criminal mastermind, an expert on breaking and entering, and (perhaps most usefully) a skilled liar. Master of self-rationalization, the Rat frequently justifies his crimes by arguing that he is providing society with entertainment; and besides which, he only steals from institutions that have insurance coverage. He displays a strong sense of morality, albeit in a much more restricted sense than is traditional. For example, diGriz will steal without compunction, but deplores killing.\n\nThe character was introduced in Harrison's short story \"The Stainless Steel Rat\", first published in 1957 in \"Astounding\" magazine. The story introduces the Rat, who has just carried out a successful larceny operation, and subsequently details a complex bank robbery the Rat pulls off with ease; however, he is outfoxed by the mysterious \"Special Corps\" — a crime-fighting organisation staffed with former criminals — and recruited by them in order to fight crime. Harrison used the story, with minor modifications, as the introduction to the series' first full-length novel, also called \"The Stainless Steel Rat\". Like other characters created by Harrison, the Rat is a speaker of Esperanto and advocates atheism.\n\nThere are 13 works in the Stainless Steel Rat series.\n\nBased on information in \"The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the World\" it is possible to work out when the timeline is set: James is sent 32,598 years into the past to 1975, making events happen in and around 34,573 (in the 346th century) – although Professor Coypu also mentions that they are now using a different calendar to the Gregorian calendar. Specifics of the new calendar are never mentioned.\n\n\"The Stainless Steel Rat\", \"The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the World\" and \"The Stainless Steel Rat for President\" were adapted into comic strip form in early issues of \"2000 AD\", written by Kelvin Gosnell and drawn by Carlos Ezquerra. Ezquerra drew Jim with an appearance modelled on the actor James Coburn. They appeared in the following issues of \"2000 AD\":\n\n\nThe first appearance of The Stainless Steel Rat in prog 140 was supposed to be preceded with a brief panel of explanation of who Jim was. However, an editorial error meant that the panel actually appeared at the end of the first episode, not the beginning. This prompted a letter to be printed in prog 148 from Harry Harrison himself pointing out the error, for which he won £3.\n\nThese three stories were colorized and reprinted by Eagle Comics in 1985 and 1986 as a six-issue limited series.\n\nThey were also collected in a trade paperback in July 2010 ().\n\nHarrison also produced a gamebook in the style of the Choose Your Own Adventure and Fighting Fantasy series, called \"You Can Be The Stainless Steel Rat\" (), the reader being told that their decisions would \"determine whether he or she can find Prof. Geisteskrank on the planet Skraldespand and bring him back before he activates a lethal new weapon\". The reader generally cannot fail in this mission, regardless of his or her choices, although it is possible to get caught in an inescapable loop at one point.\n\nIn the tribute anthology \"Foundation's Friends\", Harrison wrote a story, \"The Fourth Law of Robotics\", which featured the Stainless Steel Rat in the setting of Isaac Asimov's \"Robot\" series.\n\n\"The Return of the Stainless Steel Rat\", a board game inspired by the character, was published by SPI in their magazine \"Ares\" in the late 1970s. Designed by Greg Costikyan, the game involved the Rat infiltrating a space station under hostile control.\n\nAngelina diGriz is a criminal mastermind much like the Rat, only less ethical and more willing to kill. As the Rat's first case for the Special Corps, he tracks Angelina down and ends up falling in love with her. After her capture, she undergoes psycho surgery (not to be mistaken for \"psychic surgery\") to lessen her homicidal tendencies and she also joins the Corps; during that time she begins a relationship with the Rat that ends with them marrying in the last trimester of her pregnancy. She later assists on many of the Rat's adventures, often providing advice and solutions that Jim himself is unable to see. While she is no longer a heartless killer, her suppressed homicidal tendencies occasionally come out, especially when she sees another woman in close proximity to her husband.\n\nJames and Bolivar diGriz are the twin sons of the Rat and Angelina. The Rat missed the first six years of their life because of his adventures in time, but they share their father's attitudes and many of his skills. They end up marrying the same woman, who falls in love with both of them and gets herself duplicated into two identical women sharing one mind.\n\nHarold Peters Inskipp is the director of the Special Corps and one of the most powerful men in the Galaxy. He recruits the Rat, but is frequently infuriated by his insubordinate attitude and tendency to go rogue - committing independent crimes for sheer enjoyment. The Special Corps is composed almost entirely of former criminals—Inskipp himself was a legendary fugitive known as \"Inskipp the Uncatchable\" before being recruited and eventually becoming the Corps' commander.\n\nOne of the few Special Corp members not taken from the criminal fraternity, Professor Coypu is a boffin who had developed a Time Helix device permitting time travel as well as a portal to alternate realities. He also has a great deal of general scientific knowledge, and sent a copy of his mind with the Rat on his excursion to the 20th century to enable Jim to build a time helix and return to his native time. Coypu is rarely described, apart from having prominent buck teeth - a trait he shares with his namesake, the Coypu, or \"nutria\".\n\nThe Bishop was a master criminal on \"Bit O'Heaven\", the Stainless Steel Rat's home planet. He was a lot less physical in his capers than Jim but undertook robberies, always leaving as his calling card a picture of the bishop chess piece. He retired from robbery before Jim was born, focusing instead on computer crime, and Jim only learnt of his existence from a fellow prisoner while briefly in jail. Jim then contacted The Bishop by using his calling card in a robbery, however as a result The Bishop was forced out of retirement when he underestimated the Police's computer security systems after running a check on Jim himself. The Bishop eventually became Jim's mentor and taught him a great deal about their trade, as well as a code of ethics. Eventually Jim and The Bishop had to leave \"Bit O'Heaven\" and on their first off-planet adventure The Bishop was killed. As a parting gift he left Jim a note that he signed with his real name, although the name is not revealed to the reader.\n\nThe Kekkonshiki, also known as \"The Gray Men\", are a human culture who initially prefer domination to coexistence. Their expertise lies in using technology to manipulate sentient minds, and they have manipulated both humans and aliens on a grand scale. Jim has experienced one of their techniques (in which a gray man agent seemingly severs his hands with an axe; this was an illusion). Jim has knowingly opposed them on two separate occasions (\"The Stainless Steel Rat's Revenge\" & \"The Stainless Steel Rat Wants You\") however during conversation it is revealed by Kome that prior to \"The Stainless Steel Rat Wants You\" Jim has in fact thwarted their plans twice already, making this their third encounter. The text can also be read to say that the second time he thwarted their plans was with the alien invasion so the third encounter also happened during \"The Stainless Steel Rat Wants You\" when Jim invaded their home planet. They live on a harsh, icy world; this existence forced them to eliminate all emotion from their culture. This society is also completely patriarchal, with women being treated as nothing more than property. During Jim's interactions with Hanasu - a disgraced Kekkonshiki council leader - he persuades them to reinterpret their teachings, and they embark on a more peaceful co-existence with the rest of humanity. (Incidentally \"Kekkonshiki\" is the romanization of the Japanese word for \"Marriage Ceremony\" 結婚式.)\n\nThe MIT class ring, commonly referred to as \"The Brass Rat\", when cast in Celestrium (also known as jeweler's steel) is often referred to as \"The Stainless Steel Rat\" in reference to The Stainless Steel Rat series.\n\nThe Chinese activist Liu Di, writing under the screen name \"Stainless Steel Rat\" (不锈钢老鼠), became a high-profile symbol for democracy and free speech in China since her detention in November 2002. Her screen name is often translated as Stainless Steel Mouse.\n\nIn \"The Librarians\" episode \"And the Happily Ever Afters\", Flynn Carsen refers to Ezekiel Jones, a thief, \"master of technologies\" as the \"Stainless Steel Rat\".\n\n\"Galaxy\" reviewer Floyd C. Gale rated the first novel four stars out of five, saying \"though pure entertainment, [it] underlines SF's role in providing speculative thought about potential problems.\"\n\n"}

Once he had finished his military service he moved to Colon, Michigan, where he built illusions and demonstrated magic for Abbott's Magic Company.\n\nMullica then moved to Atlanta, Georgia where he attended bartending school and opened his own nightclub called The Tom-foolery Magic Bar Theater which was open from 1976 until 1987.\n\nRed Skelton visited the Tom-foolery in 1980 and they became fast friends. After the closure of Tom-foolery Mullica asked Skelton for his advice, and Skelton suggested that he take his best material and perform it pantomime to music, which would eliminate any language barrier so that he could perform anywhere in the world. Mullica took Skelton's advice and after six months of rehearsal moved to Paris, France where he worked at the Crazy Horse Saloon.\n\nMullica returned to the United States in 1991 and continued his comedy magic career. In 1996, he began writing RED (A Performance Tribute) which he performed in theaters throughout America and Canada.\n\nIn 2010, Mullica was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia.\n\nOn February 15, 2016, Mullica was placed in an induced coma following complications stemming from a routine hernia operation, which caused him to have several strokes. He subsequently suffered from organ and liver failure. On February 18, it was decided to take Mullica off life support. He was 67.\n\n"}

Her first stage experiences date back to her childhood as she had a small role at the \"Stadttheater\" Basel in 1939. She attended the \"Konservatorium\" under Ernst Ginsberg in Basel, followed by performances beginning in 1947 with the \"cabaret-doodle-doo\", \"KiKeriKi\" with César Keiser and Cabaret Cornichon respectively \"Cabaret Fédéral\". Later she starred in comedies and musicals, and Trudi Roth acted for the radio in radio plays and for the Swiss television.\n\nRoth's most popular role was the character of \"Martha Aebersold\" in the Swiss comedy serial \"Fascht e Familie\" in the 1990s. Among others, Trudi Ruth also starred in about a dozen plays, musicals and farces on Bernhard-Theater Zürich between 1965 and 2001. Trudi Roth motivated film director Marie-Louise Bless to create the television film \"Das Paar im Kahn\" in 2004.\n\nCharles Lewinsky, creator of \"Fascht e Familie\", recalls that \"she played every summer the Chaschperli in Zürich, followed by appearances in films, television series and in the Bernhard Theater. At the age of 80, she still played a role in his play 'Huusfründe'.\" He remembers the long conversations with Trudi Roth: \"It was impossible, to talk briefly with Trudi. When I told my wife, now I call on Trudi she said: 'I'll see you in an hour'.\" Trudi Roth was Charles Lewinsky sympathetic at the first co-operation, above all \"to have the gift of the gab\".\n\nFrom 1953 to 1957 she lived in Düsseldorf while working for the German \"Kom(m)ödchen\" ensemble; Roth then returned to Basel. With her partner Hans Moeckel, conductor of the Swiss Federal entertainment orchestra, she moved to Zürich in the 1970s. Although in a relationship, she remained single and childless.\n\nIn the last years of her life, the actress sometimes did not recognize her brother Alfred, and forgot her former success as an artist. We were very close, \"like twins,\" he said in an interview: \"She had a quirky sense of humor, was never jealous, spoke directly and lived modestly\".\" As Trudi Roth's family announced to the Swiss television SRF, the actress and cabaret artist died on the night of 11 June 2016 in a nursing home in Zürich. Cause of death was her age of 86, and dementia.\n\n\n"}

Calderone began to dabble with turntables and other DJ-related equipment at the age of 15. A decade later, in 1991, music mogul Seymour Stein signed both Calderone and his partner Gene LaFosse (they collaborated on a short-lived techno act called \"Program 2\") to a contract deal with Sire Records. Shortly after the release of their first album, the group disbanded and Calderone took a self-imposed exile away from the music industry.\n\nDuring the time he removed himself from the club music industry, Calderone worked in the restaurant business but eventually was encouraged to work on new projects including his first solo record,\"“Give It Up”\". Calderone later returned to #1 spot for two weeks in 2001 with \"Are You Satisfied?,\" featuring vocals by Deborah Cooper.\n\nFurther inspired by New York's then-thriving club scene, Victor landed gigs at many major events in the city. Calderone obtained residencies at both the Roxy in New York and Liquid in Miami Beach. Victor would then meet and commence a successful relationship with superstar singer Madonna in 1998. Impressed by Calderone's innovative vision and style, he was commissioned to remix \"Frozen\", the first single released from her \"Ray of Light\" album. Since 1998, he has remixed nine other singles for Madonna.\n\nFollowing up on Madonna's recommendation, legendary singer Sting selected Calderone to remix his song \"Desert Rose,\" the second single from his 1999 \"Brand New Day\" album. The British singer did not only hire Calderone to remix the single, which was something he had never done before with his music, but even returned to the studio with him to re-record the vocals to match the remixed song's new dance-oriented rhythms. The song spent an impressive 80 weeks on the Billboard dance charts including nine consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart.\n\nBesides his work with Madonna and Sting, his credits as remixer includes work for such artists as Beyoncé Knowles, Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson, and Sarah Brightman, amongst others.\n\nHe has also collaborated with other house music producers—including Mac Quayle and most notably Peter Rauhofer, the first Grammy Award winner in the Dance Music category. Their joint effort, known as The Collaboration released a popular multi-CD set and several hit single tracks.\n\nAfter a long string of successful albums and singles, Calderone established his Evolve brand in 2005 as a way to coalesce his numerous residencies around the world, including Montreal, Tel Aviv, Bulgaria, and a monthly residency at New York's Pacha. With the Evolve brand now taking off globally, clubgoers have quickly begun to equate the word with joy-inducing, risk-taking sets that shatter musical boundaries and the conventions of what a DJ set “should” be.\n\nCalderone resides with his wife Athena, and their son in Brooklyn.\n\n\n"}

The (unnamed) narrators of the poem are Merrill and his partner David Jackson, who together — after a Ouija board had been given to Merrill as a present by his friend Frederick Buechner in the early 1950s — would conduct hundreds of private séance sessions over the course of nearly four decades, an undertaking Merrill would come to mine extensively for \"material.\" In this early spiritual encounter, the ouija board voices warn Merrill and Jackson of the perils of speaking with the dead, though by poem's end the two mediums have been lulled into a sense of nonchalance about the enterprise.\n\n\"Voices from the Other World\" was first published in book form in \"The Country of a Thousand Years of Peace\" (1959).\n\n"}

{"id": "19736815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19736815", "title": "Zeno Clash", "text": "Zeno Clash\n\nZeno Clash is a first-person fighting video game with elements of a first-person shooter. It is the debut game of developer ACE Team and uses the Source engine. It was released for download through content delivery service Steam on 21 April, . The Xbox 360 version, entitled \"Zeno Clash: Ultimate Edition\", was released 5 May 2010 and contains additional features not found in the PC version. The game is set in the fantasy world of Zenozoik, and follows Ghat, a young man who is on the run from his vengeful siblings, and Deadra, his female companion, as they travel through strange and exotic lands.\n\nThe PC version of the game was favorably received and received an aggregate score of 77/100 on Metacritic and 77.50% on GameRankings. The Xbox 360 version was also praised and gained an average 74/100 at Metacritic and 75.46% at GameRankings. Critics praised its strange yet robust setting and unique character designs. It was a finalist for Excellence in Visual Art at the 2009 Independent Games Festival, was named 2009's Independent Game of the Year by \"PC Gamer\", and PC Game of the Month by IGN in April 2009.\n\nIn the main story mode, players assume the role of Ghat and progress through the world of Zenozoik, visiting various locations in a linear sequence. Gameplay is presented in first-person perspective, with occasional cutscenes in third-person perspective. When the player enters certain areas, it triggers a scripted sequence, initiating a battle in which the player must defeat all enemies to proceed. Ghat is proficient in martial arts, and can dodge or counter enemy attacks. While there is a strong focus on unarmed combat, Ghat can also obtain unconventional melee and ranged weapons by several means, such as disarming enemies. Intermittent segments of the game play similarly to a linear progression shooter.\n\nIn addition to the single-player story, Challenge Mode allows the player to defeat enemies while climbing a tower or descending into a pit. The results are ranked through Steam every time the player beats a tower floor's final boss.\n\nThe story takes place in a fictional fantasy world called Zenozoik, and begins in a town called Halstedom. The game commences with Ghat, the game's protagonist, regaining consciousness after setting off an explosion which kills Father-Mother, an ostensibly hermaphroditic creature, which has raised a large and influential family. Ghat is one of Father-Mother's children, who turned on it after discovering its secret. Ghat runs away from the town, chased by his brothers and sisters seeking to kill him, and is banished from his family. He is accompanied by a female companion named Deadra who has saved Ghat from apathy.\n\nDuring their travels away from Halstedom, Ghat explains to Deadra through partially interactive flashbacks the events that led up to his attempt on Father-Mother's life. One of the first things that is mentioned is that he lived for a time with the Corwid of the Free, the insane residents of the forests of Zenozoik. While he has turned away from his past life as a Corwid, his brothers and sisters still consider him as one. Ghat still harbors a sense of admiration for the single-mindedness of Corwids. Regardless, when he encounters them a fight ensues.\n\nLater on, Deadra and Ghat reach a large desert area. When Ghat returns from hunting rabbit-like creatures, he discovers a blind mercenary known only as the Hunter, who points a rifle at Deadra's head while she sleeps. The Hunter reveals that he was sent after them by Ghat's family, and was instructed to kill both him and Deadra. Ghat pleads for her life, and the Hunter agrees to let her live if Ghat will come to a secluded area with him to fight. Ghat manages to defeat the Hunter and then leaves with Deadra. Ghat and Deadra eventually reach the end of the world. It is there that they meet Golem, an ancient being placed there by an unknown group of people to wait there until he was needed. Golem has a complete knowledge of Ghat and Father-Mother's conflict, which he says he will end, along with all other conflicts.\n\nUpon Ghat's return to the city, he is confronted by his angry brothers and sisters once more. After this confrontation, a heavily wounded Father-Mother reveals itself, showing that it is still alive. It declares another fight with Ghat to end the strife once and for all. A ferocious battle ensues, in which Ghat defeats Father-Mother once more. With Father-Mother at his mercy, he decides neither to kill it, nor reveal its secret. However, Golem discloses the secret anyway—that Father-Mother is actually a male creature that steals babies from their families. It is revealed that Ghat, upon inadvertently learning this, was chased out of town by Father-Mother in an attempt to protect his secret. The game ends after Golem makes several cryptic statements about their world and family.\n\nWhile \"Zeno Clash\" was ACE Team's first original game, they have been developing game modifications since the 1990s. Their last project, \"Zenozoik\", was far larger in scope than \"Zeno Clash\", and attempted to incorporate the disparate elements of shooting, role-playing, melee combat and sandbox gameplay. ACE Team later realized that it was too ambitious for a small independent studio, and decided to make a more focused game. \"Zeno Clash\" is what emerged—player exploration is linear, and role-playing elements were excluded altogether. The game was initially conceived as a total conversion modification using the Source engine. ACE Team showed a demo version to Valve, the creators of the engine, who were impressed by the game's quality. The two companies then negotiated an engine licensing and distribution deal.\n\nIn an interview, the developers have stated that they consider the game to be a \"First-Person Fighter (with some shooter elements)\". They also likened it to \"Dark Messiah meets Double Dragon\", and stated that they have drawn a lot of inspiration from traditional fighting games—this includes \"versus screens\" sliding in before combat is initiated. Regarding the art style, they cited Hieronymus Bosch's paintings and John Blanche's \"punk fantasy\" illustrations as visual inspirations. They stated that publishers were unsure if consumers could relate to the art direction, but nonetheless stuck to their vision, creating a game that looks unlike anything else on the market. To get their desired organic look, they used static props exported from 3D Studio Max with pre-rendered lighting instead of using brush-based geometry that Source was specialized for.\n\nOn October 2009, ACE Team announced that they partnered with Atlus to release a port of the game for Xbox Live Arcade. This version of the game dubbed \"Zeno Clash: Ultimate Edition\" adds new game modes and features such as cooperative gameplay for tower challenges in both offline and online games, new attacks, new weapons, a new voice actress for the character Deadra, a character gallery and an awareness system. \"Zeno Clash: Ultimate Edition\" was released on Xbox Live Arcade on 5 May 2010.\n\nIn July 2009 source code of the game to allow easier modding was released by the developer.\n\nThe game was first released for download through Valve's content delivery service, Steam, on 21 April 2009, and is available for purchase either directly through Steam or via Direct2Drive. It was published for retail by Noviy Disk in Russia, and by Iceberg Interactive in Europe. In October 2009, Tripwire Interactive announced that it planned to publish the game for retail in North America \"soon\". Atlus has announced that they will be bringing an Ultimate Edition of the game to the Xbox 360 as an Xbox Live Arcade download in March 2010. ACE Team continued to provide support post-release, releasing character models for use with another Source engine game, Garry's Mod, several new Challenge levels as free downloadable content, and a software development kit.\n\n\"Zeno Clash\" received some press for its developers' reaction to copyright infringement. ACE Team member Carlos Bordeu left comments on many torrent sites saying that ACE Team did not intend to stop the unlicensed downloading of \"Zeno Clash\", but rather implored downloaders to purchase the game if they enjoyed it. ACE Team later claimed that their unique approach, while probably not changing the minds of potential infringers, accidentally generated press which helped to market the product.\n\nThe game received an aggregate score of 77/100 on Metacritic and 77.80% on GameRankings. In January 2009, \"Zeno Clash\" was a nominated finalist in the Independent Games Festival yearly competition, in the category of Excellence in Visual Art. It was one of five games to be selected for this award, from a total of 226 participating titles. It was named PC Game of the Month by IGN for April 2009. It was praised for its originality and \"satisfying sense of combat.\" It was a finalist in the category of Best Debut in the Tenth Annual Game Developer Choice Awards. It also won \"PC Gamer\"s 2009's Independent Game of the Year.\n\nThe gaming website Rock, Paper, Shotgun reviewed the game two days before its release, giving it four out of four thumbs up and highly recommending the title. \"Zeno Clash: Ultimate Edition\" was similarly received by critics, averaging 74/100 at Metacritic and 75.46% at GameRankings. Sales for \"Ultimate Edition\" are reported as being significantly lower than the PC version. It did however place eighth in sales the week of its release\n\nThe unique visual design and story received high praise from most critics. The reviewers from Rock, Paper, Shotgun stated that while the art of the game was \"really unusual to look at\" they felt that the visuals were \"something of a reward\". Eurogamer's Dan Pearson called the game's environments \"lushly crafted and massively colourful\". Jamin Smith, reviewer for Videogamer.com felt that the \"narrative that was (probably) conjured up during an intense drug induced trip.\" He went on to call the game world \"incredibly cohesive\" and stated that the story provided a perfect compliment to the atmosphere. Jason Ocampo of IGN remarked in his review that \"thanks to smart design and storytelling, it feels refreshingly original and completely compelling.\"\n\nReviewers were divided on gameplay aspects. 1UP.com's Scott Sharkey felt that the first-person fisticuffs were convincing when combined with camera motion; he compared such aspects to \"Mirror's Edge\". Eduardo Reboucas of Game Revolution felt that the trigger-based controls of the \"Ultimate Edition\" took some getting used to and that some encounters with enemies can occasionally become frustrating. Jason Ocampo of IGN felt that the hand-to-hand combat was \"a bit clumsy, but wholly satisfying at the same time.\" Brett Todd of GameSpot was less favorable, calling it \"simplistic\" and \"monotonous,\" citing its lack of variety in gameplay.\n\nOn 19 May 2009 the developers announced that a sequel to \"Zeno Clash\" was in the works. Ghat reprises his role as the protagonist, and several characters such as Father-Mother and Golem return. ACE Team expressed a desire to incorporate elements of role-playing games that were present in their previous abandoned project, \"Zenozoik\".\n"}
