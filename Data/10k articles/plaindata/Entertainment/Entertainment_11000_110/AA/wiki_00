{"id": "6551220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6551220", "title": "Blackout (Transformers)", "text": "Blackout (Transformers)\n\nBlackout is the name of six fictional robot supervillan characters from the Transformers robot superhero franchise.\n\nBlackout was one of a team of two Micromaster Combiners. They came with a Gepard air defense vehicle that could transform to a base. Because Blackout and his partner Spaceshot are regularly pictured together and that they are amongst the lesser-known Micromasters, the exact identity of each Transformer is regularly mistaken for the other.\n\nBlackout has never appeared in Transformers fiction, except for a profile in Dreamwave Productions' \"\" series. His bio painted him as a brave Decepticon warrior, but liable to flee if the odds turned against him. Only Spaceshot's disapproval often keeps this from happening.\n\n\nBlackout is the Mini-Con partner of Demolishor.\n\nIn the cartoon, Demolishor used him to find other Mini-Cons.\n\nBlackout appeared among the Mini-Cons in issue #18 of the \"Transformers: Armada\" comic book who aided Over-Run using the Mini-Con Matrix in the defeat of Unicron.\n\nBlackout's bio painted him as aggressive and independent—something which contrasts with Demolishor's blind loyalty to Megatron. He would voice his thoughts and feelings, even at the risk of a severe beating.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlackout was a member of the Decepticon Destruction Team and transformed into a helicopter. He was able to combine with his team to form a limb of the giant robot, Bruticus Maximus.\n\nIn the \"Energon\" animated series, Blackout was a seemingly non-sentient drone commanded by team leader, Barricade. As with all of the Energon combiner limbs, Blackout has a twin brother on his team—Stormcloud. Their energon weapons were a cannon and a pair of guns. In the Japanese series, each member had the name of a \"Generation 1\" Combaticon—Blackout's name was Blast Off.\n\nAlthough the \"Transformers: Energon\" comic book series by Dreamwave Productions was canceled before Blackout could appear in them, the Energon \"More Than Meets The Eye\" guide book was under development at the time. Pencil art by Guido Guidi was released later showing the art that would have been used with Blackout's profile.\n\nEarly leaked scripts of the 2007 live-action film had a Decepticon helicopter named Vortex, after the \"Generation 1\" Combaticon. Possibly due to Hasbro's lack of a trademark on the name Vortex, they changed the name to Blackout. Blackout has had various names before being finalized—Soundwave, Vortex and Incinerator; all names have been used on a Transformers toy at some point before. Leaked concept art for the character had the name \"Incinerator\" on it.\nBlackout transforms into an Sikorsky MH-53 Pave Low helicopter. According to screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, Blackout is the largest Decepticon. Blackout is armed with rotary machine guns and energon wave cannons. He is also able to detach and wield his tail rotor blades as a close-combat weapon. According to the book \"Transformers: The Movie Universe\", Blackout's rotor weapon can spin at 6,000 rpm and is reinforced with toughened cobalt. When out of vehicle mode his main rotors fold into two sets of three onto his back, giving him the appearance of having wings. When in helicopter mode he can simulate the appearance of a human pilot, the same holographic model (referred to as \"Mustache Man\" on-set and in the credits) that \"pilots\" Starscream and \"drives\" Barricade. Blackout can carry Scorponok on his back, as seen in both the film and the game.\n\nAccording to his profile in the second issue of the U.K. Transformers magazine, Blackout stands 33 feet 5 inches tall, weighs 2.9 tons and has a maximum speed of 800 mph. The official guide to the Transformers video game says he's 33 feet tall. Both of these heights are much smaller than his alternate mode would suggest, and seem to contradict what Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman said about his size. However, in the video game's profile for him, it states that he is often seen \"silently looming over Megatron's shoulder\" indicating that he would have to be taller than Megatron, and therefore taller than 33 feet. His exact height seems to be a mystery. As size calculations from the Voyager class toy suggests, his height should be about 55 feet tall. Oddly the book \"Ghosts of Yesterday\" described him as being smaller than Optimus Prime, who is officially described as 28 feet tall.\n\nBlackout appeared in the prequel novel, \"\", where he was the most vocal critic of Starscream's leadership. When Starscream left to destroy Bumblebee, Blackout seized the initiative and led Bonecrusher, Scorponok and Frenzy in an assault on the Autobots, attacking Prime. He failed, and eventually challenged Starscream to a duel for leadership of the Decepticons, which he lost.\n\nThe book \"Transformers - Meet The Decepticons\" by Jennifer Frantz had a slightly different ending than the movie. This book had all six Decepticons leaving Earth together after being defeated by the Autobots, instead of having most of their numbers die.\n\nThe back cover to children's book \"Transformers Prime Time\" by Michael Teitelbaum called Blackout by his earlier name Vortex on the back cover, but used Blackout in the book.\n\nBlackout appeared in \"\" by IDW Publishing. In issue #2 he sided with Megatron in his decision to counter-attack Cybertron's invaders and was among the fleet that attacked their ships.\n\nBlackout also appeared in IDW Publishing's \"\", where he, Starscream and Barricade smashed up the Mars Beagle 2 probe. In issue 4, he traveled to Earth, where he gained his MH-53 helicopter mode in Afghanistan and destroyed the scanned vehicle. The three Decepticons, detecting emissions similar to that of the Allspark, then stumbled onto Sector 7's trap for Bumblebee, wiping out their military backup. Blackout tried to access Sector 7's computers, but could only glean a few bits of information before they shut it down. After Barricade outlined his plan to follow Bumblebee and see what they could find out, Blackout and Starscream tailed him from the air.\n\nIn \"\" #2 the bodies of Brawl, Blackout and Megatron are seen being loaded onto trucks at the Nevada desert for disposal in the ocean.\n\nInformation in \"italics\" occur in the alternate storyline where Megatron won the battle for the Allspark.\n\nBlackout appeared in issue #7 if the Transformers Titan Magazine in a story called \"Starscream's Militia\". He was seemingly brought to life by Starscream using the sparks of Allspark mutations. He was immediately killed again by the Autobots.\n\n\"Blackout appears in issue #22 of the Titan Transformers Magazine series in a story called \"The Decepticon who Haunted Himself.\"\"\n\n\"Blackout and Scorponok were killed by Stockade for rejecting his offer to defect to Stockade's side.\"\n\nIn the 2007 live-action film, Blackout is the first active Decepticon (and first Transformer) to be seen. Blackout serves as the right hand of Megatron in the movie. He is Third-in-Command after Megatron and Starscream. Early in the film, he, along with his minion Scorponok, attacks the SOCCENT Forward Operations Center in Qatar, disguised as a MH-53M Pave Low IV helicopter, tail number 4500X, that was apparently shot down over Afghanistan three months earlier. Blackout is escorted to the base by two F-22 Raptors, where he transforms and single-handedly destroys the whole base. During his attack, he attempts to hack into the base's system to download data on the location of the Allspark and Megatron, only to have the hardline to the system cut off by a military officer. He then deploys Scorponok and send him to after a fleeing Captain William Lennox and his team. Later, Blackout is seen rallying with the other Decepticons to Starscream's call, after Frenzy discovers the Allspark in the Hoover Dam, saying \"All hail Megatron\" as if to remind Starscream who his master is. Arriving in Mission City during the final battle, Blackout attacks Sam, who is saved by the timely intervention of Ironhide, who throws a car at Blackout, which the Decepticon blasts out of the way and then he shoots down Ironhide. Later he attempts to kill Sam with his rotor weapon, but misses him by a few feet. Towards the end of the battle he attempts to help Megatron finish off Optimus Prime; however, he is attacked by Captain Lennox and his team, the former racing underneath him on a motorcycle and firing at him with a sabot round, along with human pilots in F-22 Raptors firing a barrage of missiles from the air, eventually killing him. (The events of \"Starscream's Militia\" and \"Alliance\" issue #2 occur next.) His corpse is disposed of in the Laurentian Abyss, along with Megatron and the other fallen Decepticons.\nIn \"Revenge of the Fallen\" a similar looking Decepticon named Grindor appears assisting Megatron and the Doctor in taking the All Spark fragment from Sam. Grindor is later killed by Optimus Prime during an attempt to rescue Sam.\n\nIn \"Transformers: The Game\", Blackout appears as a playable character in the Decepticon campaign. He stands very tall over the other Transformers and is very powerful. In the Autobot campaign, he appeared in Jazz's battle with Starscream but was killed. Starscream betrays Blackout and flies away. In the Decepticon campaign, Blackout is used in many missions, including the First Mission and Fourth Mission. He also killed Ironhide. During Megatron's battle with Optimus Prime, Blackout attempted to assist his master by charging Prime. Prime punched the massive Decepticon, sending him flying. He was knocked out by Optimus Prime but was not killed. After that, Blackout went back to the new Decepticon base with other Decepticons to destroy the planet and execute the Autobots and humans. It should also be noted that it can be argued that Blackout is the best playable Transformer in the game, being able to kill almost every drone type in one melee strike, and can kill many at a time in multiple directions. Also, his heavy ranged weapon can get through the red drone's shield, making him the only playable Transformer who can do that, and the strike actually deals considerable damage on a foe, unlike with most of the other playable characters.\n\nAll toys of this character are officially licensed from Sikorsky Aircraft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimated Blackout is a character who appeared in season 3 of the \"Transformers Animated\" series. He is a homage to the 2007 movie version of the character and incorporates the insect-like style of the movie Decepticons into his robot mode.\n\nBlackout is a living legend who has destroyed Omega Sentinels. He is also the largest Decepticon ever seen. He can emit shockwaves from his feet that can shut down (and reactivate) machinery.\n\nHe was seen in the season three episode \"Transwarped\" where he is a member of Strika's Team Chaar. He was shown to be powerful, but also somewhat dimwitted as unintentionally shut down the Space Bridge his group took for a few seconds.\n\nBlackout's biography was printed in issue #24 of the \"Transformers Collectors Club\" magazine.\n\n\nIn the \"aligned\" universe, Blackout was a battle-hardened gladiator who joined Megatron's Decepticons in the war against the Autobots. His loyalty to Megatron and defiance of Starscream mirror his live-action film incarnation.\n\nBlackout appears in the novel \"Transformers: Exodus\". Blackout was from the Badlands and fought in the pits of Kaon. His body was riddled with scars. He accompanied Megatron to steal the Plasma Energy Chamber from Teletraan-1 and witnessed his battle with Sentinel Prime. When Sentinel Prime fell, exposing the Code Key of Justice within his chest, Starscream attempted to take the Key for himself but Blackout tried to stop him, taking a blow that would've killed any other Transformer but one that only managed to fell him.\nAfter Megatron subdued Starscream, Megatron asked for Blackout's name and told him he had a great future. He asked him to take Sentinel's body back to Kaon. He was presumably successful for Optimus Prime later found Sentinel chained to a pillar in the Underworld, having suffered burns from Omega Supreme's takeoff and subjected to even more torture.\n\n"}

In the Western calendar this usually falls in the month of October.\n\nThe largest celebration takes place in Muang Surat Thani along the Tapi River, where the festival lasts nine days and nine nights. Smaller celebrations also take place throughout the south including: Nakhon Si Thammarat, Phatthalung, Pattani, and Ko Samui.\n\n\"Chak\" () means \"to pull\" and \"Phra\" () can refer to a monk, god, or Buddha image.\n\nOnce Buddha had returned to earth, a large crowd gathered to welcome him.

Pulling the Buddha on the land or in the river.\nPulling the Buddha Statue on the land is to invite the Buddha statue to the destination which is the temple.

It follows the continuing adventures of private investigators Alex Munday (Lucy Liu), Dylan Sanders (Drew Barrymore) and Natalie Cook (Cameron Diaz) as they attempt to solve the mystery of a series of missing national monuments. The heroines do not use firearms but can utilize blunt weapons and certain environmental objects.\n\nThe game is notable for being panned by critics and has been regarded as one of the worst video games ever made.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple and involves fighting groups of enemies by performing punching and kicking combinations or by using weapons.

An early version, titled Crayon Physics, was released as freeware in 2007. \"Deluxe\" won the grand prize at the Independent Games Festival in 2008. It features a heavy emphasis on two-dimensional physics simulations, including gravity, mass, kinetic energy and transfer of momentum. The game includes a level editor and enables its players to download and share custom content via an online service.\n\nThe objective of each level in \"Crayon Physics Deluxe\" is to guide a ball from a predetermined start point so that it touches all of the stars placed on the level. The ball and nearly all objects on the screen are affected by gravity. The player cannot control the ball directly, but rather must influence the ball's movement by drawing physical objects on the screen. Depending on how the object is drawn, it becomes a rigid surface, a pivot point, a wheel or a rope, and the object can then interact with the ball by hitting it, providing a surface to roll on, dragging, carrying or launching the ball, etc. The player can also nudge the ball left or right by clicking on it, and in some levels, rockets appear and can be used as part of the solution.\n\nThe game challenges players to come up with creative solutions to each puzzle, and provides additional rewards for elegant solutions that don't rely on \"brute force methods\". It comes with more than seventy levels, and also features a level editor and an online Playground, where players can upload and download custom levels.\n\n\"Crayon Physics\", the original prototype of this game, is Purho's tenth \"rapid-prototype project\" inspired by the rules of the Experimental Gameplay Project, and was developed in five days using resources freely available under a Creative Commons license. The game was inspired by descriptions Purho had heard of the children's book \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\". On June 10, 2007, Purho announced that he would be developing a level editor to permit user-created levels, although by June 15 fans of the game had already worked out the level format and had released new levels for the game. The level editor was released on June 30. \"Crayon Physics\" was built with Simple DirectMedia Layer middle-layer and released as freeware.\n\nOn October 12, 2007, Purho announced \"Crayon Physics Deluxe\", which would feature an intuitive level editor, more levels, and a modification to the game engine to preserve the player's drawings instead of turning them into rectangles. The follow-up took a year and eight months to develop. It won the Seumas McNally Grand Prize at the Independent Games Festival in February 2008. Chris Baker of \"Slate Magazine\" also wrote that \"Crayon Physics Deluxe\" was more talked about than \"Gears of War 2\" at the 2008 Game Developers Conference.\n\nMicrosoft Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and Android versions of this game were released along with Humble Indie Bundle for Android 4 on November 8, 2012.\n\nPublished by Hudson Soft, \"Crayon Physics Deluxe\" was released for the iOS on January 1, 2009 and in Spring 2010 for the iPhone via Apple's App Store. A version for the PC was released six days later. An unofficial clone was made for the DS, but only in free play mode and under the title of \"Pocket Physics\". A port for Windows Mobile was also made, but later pulled. It can still be downloaded unofficially. Ports for Mac and Linux were announced as available on July 27, 2011. Crayon Physics is pre-loaded on some Android devices including the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.\n\nThe PC version received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\n"}

With a weekly circulation of 840,000 copies, it is the largest such publication in Europe.\n\nIt was founded in 1947 by , a British army officer, and Rudolf Augstein, a former Wehrmacht radio operator who was recognised in 2000 by the International Press Institute as one of the fifty World Press Freedom Heroes. \"Spiegel Online\", the online sibling of \"Der Spiegel\", was launched in 1994 with an independent editorial staff. Typically, the magazine has a content to advertising ratio of 2:1.\n\n\"Der Spiegel\" is known in German-speaking countries mostly for its investigative journalism. It has played a key role in uncovering many political scandals such as the Spiegel scandal in 1962 and the Flick affair in the 1980s. According to \"The Economist\", \"Der Spiegel\" is one of continental Europe's most influential magazines.\n\nThe first edition of \"Der Spiegel\" was published in Hanover on Saturday, 4 January 1947. Its release was initiated and sponsored by the British occupational administration and preceded by a magazine titled \"Diese Woche\" (meaning \"This Week\" in English), which had first been published in November 1946. After disagreements with the British, the magazine was handed over to Rudolf Augstein as chief editor, and was renamed \"Der Spiegel\". From the first edition in January 1947, Augstein held the position of editor-in-chief, which he retained until his death on 7 November 2002.\n\nAfter 1950, the magazine was owned by Rudolf Augstein and John Jahr; Jahr's share merged with Richard Gruner in 1965 to form the publishing company Gruner + Jahr. In 1969, Augstein bought out Gruner + Jahr for DM 42 million and became the sole owner of \"Der Spiegel\". In 1971, Gruner + Jahr bought back a 25% share in the magazine. In 1974, Augstein restructured the company to make the employees shareholders. All employees with more than three years seniority were offered the opportunity to become an associate and participate in the management of the company, as well as in the profits.\n\nSince 1952, \"Der Spiegel\" has been headquartered in its own building in the old town part of Hamburg.\n\n\"Der Spiegel\" circulation rose quickly. From 15,000 copies in 1947, it grew to 65,000 in 1948 and 437,000 in 1961. It was nearly 500,000 copies in 1962. By the 1970s, it had reached a plateau at about 900,000 copies. When the German re-unification in 1990 made it available to a new readership in former East Germany, the circulation exceeded one million.\n\nThe magazine's influence is based on two pillars; firstly the moral authority established by investigative journalism since the early years and proven alive by several impressive scoops during the 1980s; secondly the economic power of the prolific \"Spiegel\" publishing house. Since 1988, it has produced the TV programme \"Spiegel TV\", and further diversified during the 1990s.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 1992 the circulation of \"Der Spiegel\" was 1.1 million copies. In 1994, \"Spiegel Online\" was launched. It has separate and independent editorial staff from \"Der Spiegel\". In 1999, the circulation of \"Der Spiegel\" was 1,061,000 copies.\n\n\"Der Spiegel\" had an average circulation of 1,076,000 copies in 2003. In 2007 the magazine started a new regional supplement in Switzerland. It was the first regional supplement of the magazine which covers 50-page review of Switzerland.\n\nIn 2010 \"Der Spiegel\" was employing the equivalent of 80 full-time fact checkers, which the \"Columbia Journalism Review\" called \"most likely the world's largest fact checking operation\". The same year it was the third best-selling general interest magazine in Europe with a circulation of 1,016,373 copies.\n\nWhen Stefan Aust took over in 1994, the magazine's readers realised that his personality was different from his predecessor. In 2005, a documentary by Stephan Lamby quoted him as follows: \"We stand at a very big cannon!\" Politicians of all stripes who had to deal with the magazine's attention often voiced their disaffection for it. The outspoken conservative Franz Josef Strauß contended that \"Der Spiegel\" was \"the Gestapo of our time\". He referred to journalists in general as \"rats\". The Social Democrat Willy Brandt called it \"Scheißblatt\" (i.e., a \"shit paper\") during his term in office as Chancellor.\n\n\"Der Spiegel\" often produces feature-length articles on problems affecting Germany (like demographic trends, the federal system's gridlock or the issues of its education system) and describes optional strategies and their risks in depth. The magazine plays the role of opinion leader in the German press.\n\n\"Der Spiegel\" has a distinctive reputation for revealing political misconduct and scandals. Online Encyclopædia Britannica emphasizes this quality of the magazine as follows: \"The magazine is renowned for its aggressive, vigorous, and well-written exposés of government malpractice and scandals.\" It merited recognition for this as early as 1950, when the federal parliament launched an inquiry into \"Spiegel\"s accusations that bribed members of parliament had promoted Bonn over Frankfurt as the seat of West Germany's government.\n\nDuring the Spiegel scandal in 1962, which followed the release of a report about the possibly low state of readiness of the German armed forces, minister of defence and conservative figurehead Franz Josef Strauß had \"Der Spiegel\" investigated. In the course of this investigation, the editorial offices were raided by police while Rudolf Augstein and other \"Der Spiegel\" editors were arrested on charges of treason. Despite a lack of sufficient authority, Strauß even went after the article's author, Conrad Ahlers, who was consequently arrested in Spain where he was on holiday. When the legal case collapsed, the scandal led to a major shake-up in chancellor Konrad Adenauer's cabinet and Strauß had to stand down. The affair was generally received as an attack on the freedom of the press. Since then, \"Der Spiegel\" has repeatedly played a significant role in revealing political grievances and misdeeds, including the Flick Affair.\n\nThe Spiegel scandal is now remembered for altering the political culture of post-war Germany and—with the first mass demonstrations and public protests—being a turning point from the old Obrigkeitsstaat (authoritarian state) to a modern democracy.\n\nIn 2010, the magazine supported WikiLeaks in publishing leaked materials from the United States State Department, along with \"The Guardian\", \"The New York Times\", \"El País\", and \"Le Monde\" and in October 2013 with the help of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden unveiled the systematic wiretapping of Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel's private cell phone over a period of over 10 years at the hands of the National Security Agency's Special Collection Service (SCS).\n\nThe leading role of the magazine in investigative journalism and its monopoly came to end in 2013 since other German media outlets, including \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\", \"Bild\", ARD and ZDF, began to effectively deal with political scandals.\n\nOne of the main criticism of \"Der Spiegel\" concerns its use of language. In 1957, writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger published his essay \"Die Sprache des Spiegels\" (“The Language of Der Spiegel”), in which he criticised what he called a \"pretended objectivity\". Wolf Schneider, an eminent journalist and stylist has called \"Der Spiegel\" \"the biggest mangler of the German language\" and used quotations from the magazine as examples of inept German in his style guides. Their criticism was not so much one of linguistic aesthetics as an argument that \"Der Spiegel\" \"hides and distorts its actual topics and issues by manipulative semantics and rhetoric rather than by reporting and analysing them\". In 1957, however, Enzensberger admitted in a written statement that no other contemporary German magazine attained the \"Spiegel\"s level of objectivity.\n\nOpinions about the level of language employed by \"Der Spiegel\" changed in the late 1990s. After hiring many of Germany's best feature writers, \"Der Spiegel\" has become known for its \"Edelfedern\" (\"noble quills\"—wordsmiths). The magazine frequently wins the Egon Erwin Kisch Prize for the best German feature. \"Der Spiegel\" ended up joining the ranks of the guardians of proper grammar and jargon with the \"Zwiebelfisch\" (\"(printer's) pie\") column on the magazine's website, which has even produced several best-selling books.\n\nSome critics, in particular the media historian Lutz Hachmeister and the Augstein biographer and former \"Der Spiegel\" author Otto Köhler, have brought charges against the magazine's dealings with former Nazis, even SS officers. Allegedly, \"Der Spiegel\", which at other times showed no restraint when exposing the Nazi past of public figures, distorted history and covered up for criminals after enlisting insiders hired to write about Third Reich topics. Its early reports and serials about the Reichstag fire, written by former SS officers Paul Carell (who had also served as chief press spokesman for Nazi Germany's Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop) and Fritz Tobias, have since been considered influential in historiography because since the 1960s the \"Spiegel\" reports written by these two authors have been corroborated by authoritative historian Hans Mommsen.\n\nA special 25 March 2008 edition of \"Der Spiegel\" on Islam was banned in Egypt in April 2008 for publishing material deemed by authorities to be insulting Islam and the Prophet Muhammed.\n\n\"Der Spiegel\" began moving into its current head office in HafenCity in September 2011. The facility was designed by Henning Larsen Architects of Denmark. The magazine was previously located in a high-rise building with of office space.\n\n\n"}

Founded in the summer of 1993 and officially serialized in May 1994 by China Association for Science and Technology (中国科学技术协会; Zhōngguó Kēxué Jìshù Xiéhuì), the magazine was originally subtitled Game Jízhōngyíng (GAME集中营; lit. \"Game Concentration Camp\"), and focused on both PC games and console games. In July 1995 it was closed by the government, however the publication ban was lifted two months later and the magazine was given the more politically palatable subtitle Game Fēngjǐngxiàn (GAME风景线; lit. \"Game Landscape\"). Topical coverage broadened after this point to include articles on anime, comics, music, and popular culture in general, however the de-emphasis on video games created a rift among staff and several editors led by Bīng Suǒ (索冰; better known under the pseudonym \"King\") left the magazine to found \"Diànzǐ Yóuxì yǔ Diànnǎo Yóuxì\" (电子游戏与电脑游戏; lit. \"Electronic Games and Computer Games\"; known by the portmanteau abbreviation \"Diàn Diàn\" (电电; lit. \"Electro Comp\")), a rival magazine catering to a hardcore and doujin gamer ethic.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2000, \"Diàn Ruǎn\" and \"Diàn Diàn\" dominated video game magazine sales in the country and the competition between them was stiff and occasionally acrimonious. The early 2000s saw the introduction of prominent rivals, and the development of specialist gaming magazines like the PC-focused \"Play\". From 2003 (the year that marked the folding of \"Diàn Diàn\") through 2005, \"Diàn Ruǎn\" experienced the peak of its influence with annual income approaching 16.5 million yuan. The 2010s would see the magazine's last days as the rise of internet journalism prompted a global decline of newspapers. On June 13, 2010, a large number of staff simultaneously resigned and the magazine was described by \"Gameaning\" journalists as \"hanging by a thread\". At the end of February 2012, a Weibo post from \"Diàn Ruǎn\"'s official microblog confirmed that their next issue (#319) would be the last.\n\nSeven months later, in September 2012, the magazine re-opened with a different format and with an academic rather than entertainment focus on video games. This new iteration of the magazine was short-lived and two months later (in November 2012) the magazine was renamed Diànzǐ Jìshù yǔ Ruǎnjiàn Gōngchéng (电子技术与软件工程; lit. \"Electronic Technology and Software Engineering\"), and its emphasis was shifted to non-game electronic hardware.\n\n"}
{"id": "16111059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16111059", "title": "Earthrise (video game)", "text": "Earthrise (video game)\n\nEarthrise is a science fiction player vs player massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) by independent Bulgarian developer Masthead Studios released on February 2011.\n\nThe game takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting where the surviving population of the Earth has built a new society ruled by a totalitarian government while armed factions fight for resources and power within the new system. Among other features, a few of note are a skill-based advancement system, a player-driven economy and an emphasis on free PvP. The game uses the Earthrise Engine, an engine that was to be used for the cancelled Fallout Online.\n\nCiting that the game was released \"too early\" and that it \"did not meet the expectations of its fans\", Masthead Studios shut down the Earthrise servers on February 9, 2012. A press release was sent to many of the gaming sites along with a post on the official forums giving additional details. The announcement also mentioned that the previously planned conversion to a free-to-play model is now dependent on future investor and/or publisher interest.\n\nThe character progression in Earthrise is conducted entirely online.\n\nThe number 100 indicates total skills, abilities and tactics available at launch. While many of them are combat oriented, a sizable amount will cover crafting and social aspects for each character. The three types of game elements – skills, abilities and tactics, are closely related to each other and will allow for numerous possibilities for customization of the character. Tactics are the key to customization – these meta-enhancements will be compatible with wide variety of abilities and will change their effects to suit player’s style of play. Players with similar skills may have a completely different style of fighting thanks to enhancing them with tactics.\n\nThe outcome of battle in Earthrise will rely more on the traditional RPG system, where avatar skills and equipment are important. However the combat will be more dynamic, resembling a third person shooter. The game will require a certain level of player skill in movement and targeting that is becoming increasingly popular trend in current wave of MMOs. Still, not every action will have the same requirements. Some actions will require proper targeting of the opponent, while others will require only having it in sight and then there will be actions that can be executed even if the player doesn’t have its target in sight but within range.\n\nPlayers will have the opportunity to kill other players (including from his faction) – but not without consequences. Killing people of the same faction is one of the worst crimes, prosecuted by members of both Noir and Continoma. It will be very difficult for someone to clear the damning effects of such a crime, though not impossible, and his space of operation would be greatly limited in the wild, less secure areas - where he himself would taste his own medicine by being open target for other criminals.\nEach player's criminal actions, once reported through the Continoma SVS Network will affect the behavior of every guard the player encounters. There will be cases when despite guard activity, the actions do not get reported island-wide. For the most prosecuted player killers that means that their life in a sizable portion of the game world will be constant game of cat and mouse, and other players will certainly benefit from joining in as there will be rewards to take a criminal down. Stealth abilities will be almost a requirement for survival. We won't force that sort of gameplay on players and it would be easy to get on good terms with the government. Player who has killed another player opponent would be able to loot his possessions. There will be available equipment protection, but its viability will vary based on character's affiliation and actions in the game. Characters who play \"against the system\" should learn to protect their gear well. There will be some high security areas in Earthrise, where guards will attack on sight everyone else who tries to attack another player. People, who don’t want to engage in PvP will feel secure in these zones. At the same time, the most dangerous parts of the island will feature free for all PvP.\nAnother PvP aspect in Earthrise will be guild rivalries. Guilds will be able to declare war on each other and fight for power and resources. Such wars will be prohibited in the security zones, but will not be punished in the other territories. Guilds will be able to conquer their own part of the island, gaining access to resources and a territory where they can impose their rules. There will also be arenas and other types of PvP competitions with rewards. People who do not want to engage in PvP will not feel alienated in Earthrise. There will be certain areas in the game, where PvE skills will be more important than PvP. Quests, crafting and trade are other examples of the non-PvP gameplay in Earthrise.\n\nCrafting in Earthrise is a complex process that is easy to understand but ultimately difficult to master. The basic rule of crafting is that every item is made of components and every item can be broken down to its composites. Some components are used for specific items, others are used in a wide array of items – for example, a hand gun grip can be used in the creation of various hand guns, while electronic chipsets can be used to create specific devices. Players often will break down items to their components in order to combine some of them with other components to produce new, different items. Crafting and salvaging requires specific skills, depending what item is created or salvaged down, and players will have access to dozens of skills, covering mechanics, electronics, engineering, construction and programming in several futuristic industries.\n\nTransformation of one type of item to another - either through crafting or salvaging - has damaging effect on the used resources and the final item will always have lowered quality value compared to the input components, depending on player's crafting skill. This renders impossible the infinite transformation of items - even for a true expert, constant crafting and salvaging of the same item will make the resources useless and any item made of them prone to quick damage and lessened effect. This is when items will \"break\" completely - when they cannot be any more repaired, or effectively salvaged to craft a new useful item.\n\nMMORPG.com rated the game 5.5/10 and wrote that the game was bland and uninspired, lacking a true sandbox environment and offering \"little more than grinding combat and crafting\" while also noting that the game suffered from performance issues. GameFront rated the game 65/100, praising the game's art direction but stated that the game offered slow progression and lacked a sizable playerbase.\n\n"}

He plays the electric guitar, bass as well as percussion and keyboards. After a string of AfroJazz albums, Franck is breaking new ground with a genre called \"Alternative Afro-Electro-Rock\" or \"Afrolectric Music\" that fuses Rock, Electronica and African-flavoured beats. His music leans towards the new sound of Black Rock and Biyong is notable for his African \"Guitar Hero\" musical alternative and aesthetics.\n\nFranck Biyong was born in France but grew up in Gabon , Nigeria and Ivory Coast. His father went to France as a student, graduated, became an English teacher and moved his family back to West Africa . \nFranck and his siblings attended the Institut National Supérieur des Arts et de l'Action Culturelle in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. He originally studied piano but dropped it in favour of drums, percussion and eventually, guitar. Franck's fondness for African-American Jazz guitarist, Wes Montgomery's \"Canadian Sunset\" got him interested in electric guitar.\n\nAt age 14, Franck moved to England where he started working with various bands and recording demos influenced by musical heroes Prince Nico Mbarga, Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa, William Onyeabor, King Crimson and many others.\n\nFela's death in 1997 spurred Franck's return to France where he formed fifteen-piece band Massak—a Basaa (Cameroonian tongue and tribe) word that means music, trance and enjoyment through rhythms and sounds—to pay homage to the legendary musician and his Africa 70 and Egypt 80 ensembles.\n\nHe termed his music then as \"Afrolectric\", a meeting of AfroBeat and influence from UK's electronica scene, and went on to form the Afrolectric Music label. Franck then toured clubs and festivals globally for several years (including appearances at the SOB's in New York, The Jazz Café in London and the Montréal Jazz Festival). His first official single, B.L.A (which stands for Brain Liberation Army) was released as a 7'inch vinyl on Lenar/Soul Fire Records. The two-part jam greatly appealed to gritty funk and Afrobeat lovers across the globe.\n\nThe 2006 \"Realms of the Atlantis\" would become Franck's first full-length album. It was a collection of moods and atmospheres exploring a more relaxed and spiritual musical dimension and broader range of influences. Franck Biyong expanded his repertoire a year later with sophomore release, \"Haiti Market\" a surprising psychedelic Afropop record paying tribute to the spirit of the Haitian cults and religions.\n\nFrom that point on, Franck was releasing a new album every year: 2008 brought \"Spirits into Sounds\", 2009 saw the experimental \"Rhythms of our Memory\" and in 2010, Franck Biyong travelled to his homeland to record his fifth album, \"Visions of Kamerun\". This was his final project with the band Massak and told the history of the colonial wars and linkages of the African nation with France.\n\nFranck then formed new band The Afrolectric Orkestra, composed of young Caribbean and African musicians based in Europe as well as young rising stars of the Paris' Jazz scene.\n\nThey went on to release Franck's sixth album, \"Voodoolectric Ground\". In 2011, \"Jazz & Africa\" came out. It was an album filled with highly original renditions of songs by Manu Dibango, Ornette Coleman and Sun Ra among others. The same year, Franck released \"Meeting the Basic Needs of The People\" with many long time collaborators in wide variety of personnel setting.\n\nIn 2012, \"Ki i Ye Yi\" was billed to Biyong and The Diamane Bantu Messengers (essentially a variation on Massak) with the assistance of the Paris DJs crew who released the LP with Afrolectric Music. The album had cameos by American Tenor Saxophonist , musical director for Afrobeat Academy and Ghanaian highlife legends Ebo Taylor and Pat Thomas.\n\nFranck's final dalliance into Afro jazz would be the EP, \"21.12.2012 (Truth or Lies?)\" released in 2013. That same year, Biyong also issued a cover version of Fela Kuti's \"I.T.T (International Thief Thief)\" as a free download single.\n\nIn 2014, he recorded his new single, Liyomba. The song is off Franck's upcoming 10th album release, Moonwatching and is an experiment in Rock, Electronic Music, Trap, Afro-House and Psychedelics. It draws from the crucial role the moon plays in African culture, religion and spirituality. This forthcoming release shall fuse Franck's electric sound with the deep well of Afro-Futurism.\n\nAs Music Director on Coke Studio Africa Season 1 and 2 Franck worked with the likes of Wyclef Jean, Salif Keita, Lady Jaydee, King Sunny Ade, Culture Musical Club, Seun Kuti, Just A Band and David Correy.\n\nFranck Biyong is currently signed to AfriCori.\n\n\n\n"}

Originally called Gandini Juggling Project, the company was founded in 1992 by Sean Gandini and Kati Ylä-Hokkala. Their initial works focused on fusing juggling with principles from postmodern dance, and were created in close collaboration with choreographer Gill Clarke. Gandini Juggling were early-adopters of siteswap notation, guided by their collaborations with Mike Day, who performed in their first two works.\n\nIn later years Gandini Juggling have explored juggling's relationship to art forms other than postmodern dance, and to date they have created over 30 stage and outdoor performances ranging from \"radical art/juggling fusions to accessible theatrical performances, from choreographic studies to commercially commissioned routines.\"\n\nSean Gandini and Kati Ylä-Hokkala met whilst Gandini was performing one of his street shows in London's Covent Garden. Ylä-Hokkala, a former Finnish national champion in rhythmic gymnastics was \"looking for a way to use her skills outside of the rigidly competitive system\" of her sport. Prior to forming Gandini Juggling, both Gandini and Ylä-Hokkala worked for British-based new circus company Ra-Ra Zoo.\n\nFrom 1991-1999 Gandini Juggling worked closely with British choreographer Gill Clarke (1954-2011). During this time they made a number of performances that merged principles of postmodern dance with juggling. Critic Mary Brennan noted of the company's first show \"nEither Either botH and...\" that it was \"tuned into the deepest values of postmodern dance even as it sets out to celebrate some of our oldest entertainment skills\" and that, the \"... group suddenly confront us with the whole dancey essence of what it is to-have objects/bodies moving in space, forming relationships with that space, with other bodies.\"\n\nRegular performers in this period included Mike Day (co-founder of siteswap notation), Lindsey Butcher (founder of aerial dance company Gravity & Levity), Alix Wilding (co-founder of Feeding the Fish), and Ben Richter.\n\nDuring this period Gandini Juggling also regularly presented their experiments in dance juggling at Juggling Conventions, such as the European Juggling Convention.\n\nIn 2000 Gandini Juggling were commissioned to make a show for the Millennium Dome on London's Greenwich peninsula, as part of London's Millennium celebrations. at the same time they also built a large glass cube and, with musician and juggler John Blanchard, begun to explore bounce juggling within this. They later went on to collaborate (in 2004) with John Blanchard and circus director John-Paul Zaccarini to make \"No Exit\" under the company name of K-DNK, supported by a Jerwood Award and London's National Centre for Circus Arts.\n\nIn 2004 Gandini Juggling first appeared as part of the London International Mime Festival, presenting a double bill: \"Duet\" and \"Quartet\". \"Duet\" was Gandini Juggling's first narrative performance, exploring the relationship between a man and a woman. \"Quartet\" was a more formal choreography of juggling patterns.\n\nGandini Juggling's \"fun and frothy\" \"Sweet Life\" was first performed in 2006. It was partly inspired by Federico Fellini's film \"La Dolce Vita\", and it toured European city squares and other outdoor spaces for several years.\n\nGandini Juggling returned to the London International Mime Festival in 2008 with \"Downfall\". This was an exploration of light and dark, and contained a number of glow juggling sequences. It also featured further experiments with the rhythmical sounds of bounce juggling.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2012, Gandini Juggling were commissioned by England's National Theatre to make a series of performances for the venue's Watch This Space summer festival of street and outdoor performance. The first of these performances was \"Nightclubs\" in 2009, a large-scale show that was \"an abstract and technically complex ensemble show which collected a group of markedly different performers and joined them by their unabashed love of spreadsheet juggling and mathematics.\" This was followed in 2010 by \"Smashed\", a Pina Bausch-inspired work \"exploring conflict, lost love and quaint afternoon tea\". The original 30-minute outdoor version of \"Smashed\" was later reworked into a 60-minute indoor version for the London International Mime Festival. \"Smashed\" went on to become the company's most successful work being performed over 300 times between 2010 and 2015 <INSERT REF>. For 2011's Watch This Space the company presented \"Blotched\", and then in 2012 \"Twenty/Twenty\", a celebration of the company's 20th year.\n\nIn 2014 Gandini Juggling premiered \"CLOWNS & QUEENS\" at London's Shoreditch Town Hall, a show that was \"full of sex, but it is never sexy, examining the nature of lust with an almost forensic attention...\"\n\nFor the London International Mime Festival in 2015 Gandini Juggling premiered \"4 x 4 (Ephemeral Architectures)\", a fusion of juggling and ballet, at the Royal Opera House in London's Covent Garden. \"4 x 4 (Ephemeral Architectures)\" was directed by Sean Gandini and choreographed by Ludovic Ondiviela to the original composition \"Suspended Opus 69\" by Nimrod Borenstein.\n\nIn 2011 with Circo Aereo Gandini Juggling co-produced \"Motet\". This was directed by Circo Aereo's Maksim Komaro and was themed as a \"history of juggling\".\n\nIn 2016 Gandini Juggling provided the skills ensemble for the English National Opera's production of Philip Glass's \"Akhnaten\". In the same year Gandini Juggling also worked with juggling company Plastic Boom to produce \"Water on Mars\" for the Edinburgh Fringe.\n\n"}

The film stars Franco Nero and Corinne Cléry as a couple in a troubled marriage, and David Hess as a fugitive who takes them hostage. The musical score was written by Ennio Morricone. The film is based on Peter Kane's novel \"The Violence and the Fury\".\n\nWalter Mancini (Nero), an alcoholic reporter, and his wife Eve (Cléry) are on a road trip with a trailer heading back to Los Angeles. Along the way, they pick up a hitch-hiker (Hess) who introduces himself as Adam Konitz. Konitz soon turns out to be a sadistic escapee from an institution for the criminally insane, and he is running from the law after robbing two million dollars with his partners. He takes the couple hostage and orders Eve to head to Mexico. They are soon stopped by two policemen and after Walter attempts to signal them by writing \"SOS\" on his matchbox, Konitz shoots them both.\n\nWhile the three stop for the night, Konitz's two partners, whom he had betrayed to get all the loot for himself, shoot at Konitz and take control of the money and the car. They decide to keep the Mancinis alive until reaching the Mexican border. While driving, they are attacked by someone in a truck. The attacker turns out to be Konitz who kills his former associates and again takes the Mancinis hostage. After they reach a secluded place, Konitz rapes Eve and forces Walter to watch the act. As Konitz gets ready to kill Walter, Eve shoots him with Walter's hunting rifle.\n\nDespite Eve's opposition, Walter decides to keep the two million instead of going to the police. After the four young motorcyclists the couple met at a gas station pass them and pour oil on the road, the Mancinis' car goes off the road and crashes. One of the youngsters takes three hundred from Walter's pocket, but leaves the suitcase on the back seat untouched. The thieves then ride away. Eve is badly hurt and requests help from Walter. Walter brings Konitz's body from their trailer and plants it on the accident scene. He then tells the dying Eve that the thieves had only helped him. He had planned to stop after 15 to 20 miles, kill her and make it look like an accident. After lighting up a cigarette and setting the car and the trailer on fire, Walter starts walking and, hearing a car come by, thumbs a ride.\n\n\nThe film was based on \"The Violence and the Fury\" by Peter Kane.\n\nIn \"The Devil Thumbs a Ride\", a short documentary on the film, Nero states that he became involved in the film because he already knew Campanile well, and Campanile had earlier stated his wish to work with him. Nero was in Germany shooting \"21 Hours at Munich\", in which Hess also had a small role, when Campanile called him and suggested starring in \"Autostop rosso sangue\". Because Hess wanted to work in Italy, Nero suggested him as the second male lead. Hess had earlier played a similar role in \"The Last House on the Left\". \n\nJust a few days before the shooting of the film began, Nero broke his arm at the set of the Spaghetti Western \"Keoma\" while giving a misbehaving horse a punch. Nero approached Campanile with his problem and the script was quickly modified. In the final script, Nero's character hurts his hand in the beginning of the film and Cléry's character drives the car.\n\nBecause filming in the United States would have been too expensive, the film was shot in the mountains of the Gran Sasso, around the city of L'Aquila in central Italy. The location resembled Northern California, and American-like gas stations and signs were also created.\n\nIn a contemporary review, the \"Monthly Film Bulletin\", the film was condemned for being \"dependent on heavy doses of violence to keep its predictable plot moving\" and was \"directed in a bland and featureless manner by Festa Campanile, and overtly portentous in its dialogue\". The review concluded that it was \"notable only for its extensive borrowings: \"Duel\" for the murderous truck that terrorises car and trailer on the mountain road; \"The Wild One\" and company for the motorcycle louts deliberately causing havoc on the highways; and numerous 'road' movies for its general format.\" Morricone's score was praised as an \"attractive score, which makes fine use of a theme tune played on guitar, to its credit.\"\n"}

{"id": "22141040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22141040", "title": "LED-backlit LCD", "text": "LED-backlit LCD\n\nA LED-backlit LCD is a flat panel display which uses LED backlighting instead of the cold cathode fluorescent (CCFL) backlighting. LED-backlit displays use the same TFT LCD (thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display) technologies as CCFL-backlit displays, but offer reduced energy consumption, better contrast and brightness, greater color range (using more expensive RGB LEDs, blue LEDs with RG phosphors, or quantum dot enhancement film (QDEF)), more rapid response to changes in scene (with dynamic backlight dimming), and photorefractive effects.\n\nWhile not an LED display, a television using such a combination of an LED backlight with an LCD panel is called an \"LED TV\" by some manufacturers and suppliers.\n\n\nLED backlights replace CCFL (fluorescent) lamps with several dozen to several hundred white or blue LEDs. Two types of LED arrangement may be used:\n\n\nIn Full array local dimming (FALD), LEDs are controlled individually to dynamically control the level of light intensity in a given part of the screen. This method of backlighting allows local dimming of specific areas of darkness on the screen, resulting in much higher dynamic-contrast ratios, though at the cost of less detail in small, bright objects on a dark background, such as star fields or shadow details.\n\nLED-backlit LCDs are not self-illuminating (unlike pure-LED systems). There are several methods of backlighting an LCD panel using LEDs, including the use of either white or RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) LED arrays behind the panel and edge-LED lighting (which uses white LEDs around the inside frame of the TV and a light-diffusion panel to spread the light evenly behind the LCD panel). Variations in LED backlighting offer different benefits. The first commercial full-array LED-backlit LCD TV was the Sony Qualia 005 (introduced in 2004), which used RGB LED arrays to produce a color gamut about twice that of a conventional CCFL LCD television. This was possible because red, green and blue LEDs have sharp spectral peaks which (combined with the LCD panel filters) result in significantly less bleed-through to adjacent color channels. Unwanted bleed-through channels do not \"whiten\" the desired color as much, resulting in a larger gamut. RGB LED technology continues to be used on Sony BRAVIA LCD models. LED backlighting using white LEDs produces a broader spectrum source feeding the individual LCD panel filters (similar to CCFL sources), resulting in a more limited display gamut than RGB LEDs at lower cost.\n\nThe commercially called \"LED TV's\" are LCDs-based television sets where the LED's are dynamically controlled using the video information\n(dynamic backlight control or dynamic “local dimming” LED backlight, also marketed as HDR, high dynamic range television, invented by Philips researchers Douglas Stanton, Martinus Stroomer and Adrianus de Vaan ).\n\nThe evolution of energy standards and the increasing public expectations regarding power consumption have made it necessary for backlight systems to manage their power. As for other consumer electronics products (e.g., fridges or light bulbs), energy consumption categories are enforced for television sets. Standards for power ratings for TV sets have been introduced, e.g., in the USA, EU, and Australia as well as in China. Moreover, a 2008 study showed that among European countries, power consumption is one of the most important criteria for consumers when they choose a television, as important as the screen size.\n\nUsing PWM (pulse-width modulation), a technology where the intensity of the LEDs are kept constant but the brightness adjustment is achieved by varying a time interval of flashing these constant light intensity light sources, the backlight is dimmed to the brightest color that appears on the screen while simultaneously boosting the LCD contrast to the maximum achievable levels, drastically increasing the perceived contrast ratio, increasing the dynamic range, improving the viewing angle dependency of the LCD and drastically reducing the power consumption.\n\nThe combination of LED dynamic backlight control in combination with reflective polarizers and prismatic films (invented by Philips researchers Adrianus de Vaan and Paulus Schaareman make these \"LED\" (LCD) televisions far more efficient than the previous CRT-based sets leading to a worldwide energy saving of 600 TWh (2017), equal to 10% of the electricity consumption of all households worldwide or equal to 2 times the energy production of all solar cells in the world..\n\nThe prismatic and reflective polarization films are generally achieved using so called DBEF films manufactured and supplied by 3M. These reflective polarization films using uniaxial oriented polymerized liquid crystals (birefringent polymers or birefringent glue) are invented in 1989 by Philips researchers Dirk Broer, Adrianus de Vaan and Joerg Brambring.\n\nA first dynamic “local dimming” LED backlight was public demonstrated by BrightSide Technologies in 2003, and later commercially introduced for professional markets (such as video post-production). Edge LED lighting was first introduced by Sony in September 2008 on the BRAVIA KLV-40ZX1M (known as the ZX1 in Europe). Edge-LED lighting for LCDs allows thinner housing; the Sony BRAVIA KLV-40ZX1M is 1 cm thick, and others are also extremely thin.\n\nLED-backlit LCDs have longer life and better energy efficiency than plasma and CCFL LCD TVs. Unlike CCFL backlights, LEDs use no mercury (an environmental pollutant) in their manufacture. However, other elements (such as gallium and arsenic) are used in the manufacture of the LED emitters; there is debate over whether they are a better long-term solution to the problem of screen disposal.\n\nBecause LEDs can be switched on and off more quickly than CCFLs and can offer a higher light output, it is theoretically possible to offer very high contrast ratios. They can produce deep blacks (LEDs off) and high brightness (LEDs on). However, measurements made from pure-black and pure-white outputs are complicated by the fact that edge-LED lighting does not allow these outputs to be reproduced simultaneously on screen.\n\nFull-array backlights that use mini-LED panels, consisting of several thousand WLEDs, are being researched for TVs and mobile devices.\n\nIn September 2009 Nanoco Group announced a joint development agreement with a major Japanese electronics company, under which it will design and develop quantum dots (QDs) for LED backlights in LCDs. Quantum dots are photoluminescent; they are useful in displays because they emit light in specific, narrow normal distributions of wavelengths. To generate white light best suited as an LCD backlight, parts of the light of a blue-emitting LED are transformed by quantum dots into small-bandwidth green and red light such that the combined white light allows for a nearly ideal color gamut generated by the RGB color filters of the LCD panel. In addition, efficiency is improved, as intermediate colors are not present anymore and don't have to be filtered out by the color filters of the LCD screen. This can result in a display that more accurately renders colors in the visible spectrum. Other companies are also developing quantum dot solutions for displays: Nanosys, 3M as a licensee of Nanosys and QD Vision of Lexington, Massachusetts. This type of backlighting was demonstrated by various TV manufacturers at the Consumer Electronics Show 2015. Samsung introduced their first 'QLED' quantum dot displays at CES 2017 and later formed the 'QLED Alliance' with Hisense and TCL to market the technology.\n\nLED backlights are often dimmed by applying pulse-width modulation to the supply current, switching the backlight off and on more quickly than the eye can perceive. If the dimming-pulse frequency is too low or the user is sensitive to flicker, this may cause discomfort and eyestrain (similar to the flicker of CRT displays at lower refresh rates). This can be tested by a user simply by waving their hand in front of the screen; if it appears to have sharply-defined edges as it moves, the backlight is pulsing at a fairly low frequency.

{"id": "235401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=235401", "title": "Mafia (party game)", "text": "Mafia (party game)\n\nMafia, also known as Werewolf, is a party game created by Dmitry Davidoff in 1986 modelling a conflict between two groups: an informed minority (the mafia), and an uninformed majority (the innocents). At the start of the game, each player is secretly assigned a role affiliated with one of these teams. The game has two alternating phases: one, during which the mafia may covertly \"murder\" an innocent, and two, in which surviving players debate the identities of the mafia and vote to eliminate a suspect. The game continues until all of the mafia have been eliminated or until the mafia outnumbers the innocents.\nDmitry Davidoff (, \"Dmitry Davydov\") is generally acknowledged as the game's creator. He dates the first game to spring 1987 at the Psychology Department of Moscow State University, spreading to classrooms, dorms, and summer camps of Moscow University. \"Wired\" attributes the creation to Davidoff but dates the first game to 1987, with 1986 being the year in which Davidoff was starting the work which would produce Mafia. He developed the game to combine psychology research with his duties teaching high school students. The game became popular in other Soviet colleges and schools and in the 1990s it began to be played in other parts of Europe and then the United States. By the mid 1990s a version of the game became a Latvian television series (with a parliamentary setting, and played by Latvian celebrities).\n\nAndrew Plotkin gave the rules a werewolf theme in 1997, arguing that the mafia were not that big a cultural reference, and that the werewolf concept fit the idea of a hidden enemy who looked normal during the daytime. Mafia and a variant called Thing have been played at science fiction writers' workshops since 1998, and have become an integral part of the annual Clarion and Viable Paradise workshops. The Werewolf variant of Mafia became widespread at major tech events, including the Game Developers Conference, ETech, Foo Camps, and South By Southwest. In 1998 the Kaliningrad Higher school of the Internal Affairs Ministry published the methodical textbook \"Nonverbal communications. Developing role-playing games 'Mafia' and 'Murderer\"' for a course on Visual psychodiagnostics, to teach various methods of reading body language and nonverbal signals. In September 1998 Mafia was introduced to the Graduate College at Princeton University, where a number of variants were developed. The werewolf theme was also incorporated in the French adaption of Mafia, The Werewolves of Millers Hollow.\n\nIn August 2000, a user under the alias \"mithrandir\" of The Grey Labyrinth, a website devoted to puzzles and puzzle solving, ran a game of mafia adapted for play on a forum board. Both The Grey Labyrinth and sister site MafiaScum claim that this was the first game of mafia run on a forum board. From there, Mafia has spread to numerous online communities.\n\nIn March 2006 Ernest Fedorov was running a Mafia Club in Kiev, using his own patented variation of the rules. The club organizes games, rates players, and awards prizes (including a Sicily trip for their tournament-series champion).\n\nIn June 2006 a Rockingham school inquiry was launched after parents complained of the traumatic effects classroom Mafia was having on their fifth-grade children. Davidoff responded to the reports, saying that as a parent who had studied child psychology for 25 years, he felt that the game could \"teach kids to distinguish right from wrong\", and that the positive message of being honest could overcome the negative effects of an \"evil narrator\" moderating the game as if it were a scary story.\n\nIn late 2013, Michael \"Thingyman\" Harders founded the Game of Mafia Champions, an invitation-only series in which players from multiple internet communities play in a series of mafia games, culminating in a final game, where the best player of the year is determined. The series was first hosted on Two Plus Two Poker Forums' Puzzles and Other Games section and has since been moved to Mafia Universe.\n\nMafia was called one of the 50 most historically and culturally significant games published since 1890 by about.com.\n\nIn its simplest form, Mafia is played by two teams: the mafia and the innocents. Live games require a moderator who does not participate as a player, and identities are assigned by handing out cards. At the start of the game, every mafioso is given the identities of their teammates, whereas the innocents only receive the number of mafioso in the game, and do not know which players are mafia and which are innocents.\n\nThere are two phases: \"night\" and \"day\". At night, certain players secretly perform special actions; during day, players discuss and vote to \"lynch\", or eliminate, one player. These phases alternate with each other until all mafiosi have been eliminated or until the mafia outnumbers the innocents.\n\nSome players may be given roles with special abilities. Common special roles include:\n\n\nAndrew Plotkin recommends having exactly two mafiosi, whereas the original Davidoff rules suggest a third of the players (rounding to the nearest whole number) be mafiosi. Davidoff's original game does not include roles with special abilities. In his rules for \"Werewolf\", Plotkin recommends that the first phase be day and that there be an odd number of players. These specifications prevent players from being killed before the first day and in most scenarios ensure that the game will end dramatically on a lynching rather than with an anticlimactic murder.\n\nAll players close their eyes. The moderator then instructs all members of the mafia to open their eyes and acknowledge their accomplices. The mafia members pick a \"victim\" by silently gesturing to indicate their target and to show unanimity then close their eyes again.\n\nA similar process occurs for other roles with nightly actions. In the case of the detective, the moderator may indicate the target's innocence or guilt by using gestures such as nodding or head shaking.\n\nNight may be accompanied by players tapping gently to mask sounds made by gesturing.\n\nThe moderator instructs players to open their eyes and announces who \"died\" the previous night. Discussion ensues among the living players. At any point, a player may accuse someone of being a mafioso and prompt others to vote to lynch them. If over half of the players do so, the accused person is eliminated and night begins. Otherwise, the phase continues until a lynching occurs.\n\nAccording to some rules, the role of dead players are revealed; according to others, it is not. In both cases, dead players are not permitted to attempt to influence the remainder of the game.\n\nBecause players have more freedom to deliberate, days tend to be longer than nights.\n\nMafia is a complicated game to model, so most analyses of optimal play have assumed both (a) that there are only townsfolk and mafiosi and (b) that the townsfolk never have a probability of identifying the Mafia that is better than chance. Early treatment of the game concentrated on simulation, while more recent studies have tried to derive closed-form equilibrium solutions for perfect play.\n\nIn 2006, the computer scientists Braverman, Etesami and Mossel proved that without detectives and with perfect players the randomized strategy is optimal for both citizens and mafia. When there is a large enough number of players to give both groups similar probability of winning, they showed that the initial number of mafiosi \"m\" needs to be proportional to the square root of the total number of players \"P\", that is formula_1. With a simulation, they confirmed that 50 mafiosi would have almost a 50% chance to win among 10,000. The Mafia's chance of victory is\n\nformula_2\n\nwhich is a good approximation when the right hand side is below 40%. If any detectives are added to the game, Braverman et al. proved that the number of mafiosi must remain at a fixed proportion of the total number of players for their chance of winning to remain constant.\n\nIn 2008, Erlin Yao derived specific analytical bounds for the mafia's win probability when there are no detectives.\n\nIn a paper from 2010, exact formula for the probability that the mafia wins was found. Moreover, it was shown that the parity of the initial number of players plays an important role. In particular, when the number of mafiosi is fixed and an odd player is added to the game (and ties are resolved by coin flips), the mafia-winning chance do not drop but rise by a factor of approx. formula_3 (equality in the limit of the infinite number of players).\n\nIn live (or videoconference) real-time play, the innocents typically win more often than game theory suggests. Several reasons for this have been advanced:\n\n\nBut, the Mafia \"can\" win in live play; their best chance of winning occurs when mafioso bond with their innocent neighbours and convince those neighbours to value that bond over dispassionate analysis. The game designers Salen and Zimmerman have written that the deep emergent social game play in Mafia (combined with the fear of elimination) create ideal conditions for this.\n\nThese additional roles are named differently in the many versions of Mafia, for thematic flavor, or historical reasons. Also, the same role-name can have differing functions across different versions of the game. What follows is a general list of role \"types\" found in Mafia variants; since the specific names vary by milieu it must be non-exhaustive.\nPlayers with these roles use their own night-phase to discover something about other players. Though the standard game now includes the basic Detective, these roles are optional, and games can exclude them entirely (such as the stool pigeon variant, or Davidoff's original rules).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn \"Town of Salem\", a version of Mafia, the Sheriff is a role which can interrogate people at night, and get to know their role. The Godfather and the Arsonist are immune to the detection of a Sheriff, and the Framer can frame a player to make them appear as a mafioso.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional variations exist, sometimes with even more specialized or complicated abilities. There are many special roles, and many moderators design novel roles for each game. Some commercial variants ship with blank cards to allow this customization.\n\nThe naming of various roles, factions, and other elements of play is theme-dependent and has limitless variation. Common alternative themes restyle the mafia as werewolves, cultists, assassins, or witches, with other roles being renamed appropriately.\n\nOver the years, players have created Mafia variants that include additional rules. Some of these are listed here.\n\nIf there are as many mafiosi as innocents in the day-phase then a mafia victory is declared immediately, under the original Mafia rules. Other variants suspend this rule, and only declare the game after every member of one faction has been eliminated: this makes the game easier to explain, and to run.\n\nNominees for lynching may be allowed to make a speech in their own defense. Usually, each player must vote, can only vote once and cannot vote for themselves. But some variants have a more complicated process of selecting players to be executed. Davidoff's original 'Mafia' allowed multiple day-time executions (per day), each needing only a plurality to action.\n\nVoting variants abound, but any lynching usually requires an absolute majority of the electorate, or votes cast. So the voting is usually not by secret ballot for multiple candidates with the highest vote count eliminated; it is more usual for the voting to be openly resolved either by:\n\nDeadlocked elections can be resolved by lot or by killing the player with the scapegoat special role.\n\nThe special case of one mafioso and one innocent remaining can be decided randomly or be ruled a Mafia win—this is more usual in live play.\n\nThe Innocents can choose not to kill anybody during the day. Although commonly unsure of Mafia identities, the Innocents are more likely to randomly kill a mafioso than are the Mafia (at night). Therefore, not lynching anyone (even at random) will typically favor the Mafia.\n\nHowever, when the number of survivors is even, No Kill may help the Innocents; for example, when three Innocents and one mafioso remain – generally called MYLO, or Mislynch and Lose due to the innocents' loss upon a lynch of their own – voting for No Lynch gives a 1/3 chance of killing the mafioso the next day, rather than a 1/4 chance today (assuming random lynching).\n\nSome variants require all Mafia members to choose the same victim independently for a kill to succeed. This can be achieved in the following ways:\nIn some online versions of the game, a particular player (the Godfather or a designated mafioso) must send in the kill.\n\nAnother variant requires the night-time vote to be secret and unanimous, but allows multiple players to be added to the execution queue to ensure unanimity.\n\nMultiple, independent groups of mafia or werewolves act and win independently, giving faster game-play and the potential for cross-fire between the factions.\n\nIn this variant, players are given two cards: the first contains their role, the second an attribute. Attributes were originally derived from roles that could apply to both Mafia and Innocent alignments such as \"Bulletproof\" (cannot be killed at night), \"Mayor\" (has two votes in the lynch), and \"Siamese Twins\" (more commonly known as Siblings or Lovers).\n\nThis variant was developed by Steven Irrgang and used for a puzzle in the 2008 CISRA Puzzle Competition. The difference from a standard game of Mafia is that players are not initially assigned roles, but rather on each day are given the probabilities describing the game's current quantum state. Each player with a non-zero probability of being a seer or a werewolf performs the appropriate night actions (which may not be effective if it is later determined that the player did not have that role). When a player is killed, the wave function collapses and the players are given updated probabilities.\n\nTraditional Mafia re-envisioned and heavily modified by the Copenhagen Game Collective to be played in a subway metro. In this variation, players who are 'lynched' are kicked off the train (at the next stop), and must wait in shame for the following train – a kind of 'afterlife' train – to join a second, interwoven game.\n\nA location-based mobile gaming variant for Android, designed for city center play. The two factions are: the Rebels, the majority; and the Spies, the informed minority. The rule-set replaces expulsions with scoring by round. Each player is assigned an individual mission each round. Some missions are critical and if one of those fails, the round goes to the Spies, but only one player knows which missions are critical.\n\nIn this standalone game published by Bezier Games, players only \"sleep\" and close their eyes for a single night at the beginning of the game. They then have a single day of discussion, with a single lynching. No players are eliminated as the game progresses. There is no moderator, so everyone gets to participate as a member of the town or village. When playing this game, three more role cards are used than the number of players; when everyone is randomly dealt out their card the three extra ones placed in the middle of the table. To begin the game one of the players, with eyes closed, will act as the \"caller\" on the single starting night, going through the nighttime roles once: Werewolves and Masons (if in play) will identify each other, the Seer will examine one player's card or two of the middle cards, the Robber will steal another player's role card and replace it with their own, the Troublemaker will blindly swap two players' role cards, the Insomniac wakes up to check if their role card has been swapped, etc. The game ends on a single lynching vote, with the villagers winning if a single werewolf is caught, and the werewolves winning if no werewolves are killed. This game can be played with as few as three players. Play time can be as quick as five minutes per game\n\nThis is an advanced version of Mafia that takes place during the Salem witch trials. It involves several different roles from multiple factions. Every single player is assigned a role. There are no \"innocents\" (people who have no special role but are aligned with the Town). Besides the Mafia and the Town, there is also a separate, \"neutral\" faction whose roles are usually not aligned with either faction and have their own goals. For example, the Executioner needs to get someone lynched during the day, the Jester's goal is to be hanged during the day (must convince the town they are an evil role), the Survivor must simply stay alive until the end of the game, and the Arsonist must be the last person standing . The game was recently updated to add a new faction: the Coven, which mainly consists of witches and is similar in function and goal to the more traditional Mafia.\n\nMafia can also be played online. Games can be played on IRC channels, where a bot assumes the role of a game moderator and the interaction of players is conducted via textual communication. Being that IRC is not a widespread way of communication, these Mafia games are restricted to limited number of people. Since 2008, many other Mafia game sites were formed. These sites are attempts at reproducing the live Mafia games, and the duration and the mechanics of the games are about the same as when the game is played traditionally.\n\nPlaying mafia-like games online opens a possibility long lasting games, such as the ones on forums. In such games, one day in real life usually corresponds to one day within the game, so players log in each morning to see who was killed during the night phase.\n\nThe online games have several advantages. There is no need to gather many people in the same room, so organizing and playing a game of Mafia is faster and more convenient. Removing the human moderator and the need for players to close their eyes removes the possibility of accidental reveals of information. Online play also allows role mechanics which would be too cumbersome to use in a physical version of the game.\n\nA drawback of online play is the lack of direct face-to-face communication, which many consider the most important aspect of Mafia. Some sites organize Mafia games with web cams, so that the face-to-face communication is preserved. The long lasting online mafia games that are usually played via online forums do not necessarily have this drawback. It is merely a correlation that people who communicate via forums usually do not know each other in real life.\n\nIn a traditional Mafia game, all of the players are in one room. There is no way to communicate with another player in private. With online games, this is not the case. Many Mafia game forums and game sites have rules that mandate that only one channel of communication must be used for all game related discussion. Thus forbidding the use of alternative channels for discussing the game. These rules are obviously only declarative as there is no way of enforcing them efficiently. It is especially difficult to enforce such prohibiting rules during long games on players that communicate with each other in person in real life. All forums support different kind of game setups, so it is feasible to organize a forum game without the restrictions on private messaging.\n\nPrivate communication problem comes to light especially in trying to prevent \"dead\" players from participating in the game. Most online games consider this a breach of rules. Since, in general case, this breach of rules cannot be proven, the gameplay of most sites depends heavily on players' honesty and integrity.\n\n\n"}

Especially noted are the struggles between Sante Carollo and Luigi Malabrocca, to see who could waste the most time. Each tried to lose more time than the other by hiding in bars, barns, and behind hedges, or even by puncturing their own wheels. In 1948 the honor was awarded to the Tuscan Aldo Bini, who according to some journalists and fans of the time, stubbornly continued the race until the end, despite a broken right hand suffered in a mass crash, and the suffering that especially in the mountain stages forced him to get off the bike and push it uphill.

{"id": "704516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=704516", "title": "Opus (comic strip)", "text": "Opus (comic strip)\n\nOpus was a Sunday strip drawn by Berkeley Breathed for a period of five years, 2003 to 2008. It was Breathed's fourth comic strip, following \"The Academia Waltz\", \"Bloom County\" and \"Outland\".\n\nSet in Bloom County, the strip documented the adventures of Breathed's popular character Opus the Penguin, parodying both pop culture and politics along the way. It was launched with much fanfare on November 23, 2003, and was syndicated by Washington Post Writers Group. In early October 2008 the author declared he was terminating the strip because of his expectation that the United States is going to face tough times and his desire to depart from his most famous character \"on a lighter note\".\n\nOpus is the title character and protagonist of the strip. Though he returned to Antarctica at the end of \"Outland\", Opus traveled back home to Bloom County, only to find that time has changed everything and everyone he once held dear. His employment usually depended on the week's joke – since \"Opus\" began, he has so far been a political operative, a garbageman, and a newspaper ombudsman – but he was most often depicted as a syndicated cartoonist.\n\nWhile his mother, maiden name Bougm, was no longer \"long-lost,\" she was not all he had imagined her to be after a decades-long search, and he was frequently seeking the comfort of an ideal mother-figure.\n\nIn a 2003 interview with \"The A.V. Club\", Breathed revealed that \"Opus was named after a Kansas song.\" (The band's 1976 album \"Leftoverture\" includes the song \"Opus Insert\" and a suite called \"Magnum Opus\".) He also added, \"If you're too young to know who Kansas was, to hell with you.\"\n\n\n\nEarly on in the strip, it was revealed that Michael Binkley had fled Bloom County to become a teenage Tibetan eunuch after a disastrous first kiss (this kiss was described to Binkley by his older self from his anxiety closet in Bloom County). He was not heard from again until June 3, 2007, when he appeared in his child form without explanation.\n\nAt one point, Opus ponders the whereabouts of his other buddies from the past. Among those that Opus remembers are Milo Bloom, although Milo's whereabouts have not yet been discussed. Additionally, Ronald-Ann Smith, the original protagonist of \"Outland\", has not been referenced at all in the strip.\n\nAt an autograph party for an \"Opus\" anthology book, Breathed revealed that the reason many of the original child characters had not returned is because in the years since the end of \"Outland\", the child characters would have aged into teenagers, and Breathed had no interest in reviving the characters in that form.\n\nOn August 31, 2008, \"the Creator\" (Berkeley Breathed) spoke to Opus and hinted that the strip will end soon. The next week, Opus was visited by the ghost of Elvis who told Opus to find a place where he wants to be forever, because he will stay in that one spot after he \"dies.\" e.g., Elvis is condemned to sit on the toilet forever because that's where he happened to be when he died.\n\nOpus tried to fly to a tropical island on September 14, but when he was asked for his passport, he told the ticket clerk that he smuggled himself into the U.S. 30 years ago. He was promptly arrested by airport security while screaming, \"God Bless George Bush!\" Opus was taken to the Department of Homeland Security and waterboarded. The guards told him to \"start talking, Akbar!\" Opus complained to \"the Creator,\" saying he couldn't just let the strip end like this. \"The Creator\" then placed Opus in an animal shelter, and mockingly said, \"Happy?\" to which Opus replied \"NO!!\"\n\nThe next week, September 26, 2008, saw Opus bemoaning having to spend his eternity in a county animal shelter. At the behest of a fellow inmate, a scruffy dog, Opus soon began sharing his memories of his past and recounts his life through the run of Breathed's strips. Many shots of him in well-known stories from \"Bloom County\" are then shown, including Opus saying \"bozo\" to a politician on the TV in 1981, misunderstanding a money-grubbing cultist in 1982, sharing a mass dandelion break with other characters in 1983, his role in the rock band \"Deathtöngue\" in 1984, dreaming romantically of Diane Sawyer in 1985, and a current joke about Sarah Palin set in 1986. The strip included a tag at the bottom indicating it would be continued the next week.\n\nAt this point, a trio of island-native girls arrive at the shelter; they only have room for one companion to live with them in their paradise.\n\nOn October 6, 2008, Breathed announced that the strip would end after November 2 that year, and even decided to do a contest for people to guess what Opus's fate is on BerkeleyBreathed.com. The winner will have $10,000 donated to the animal shelter of their choosing.\n\nOn October 19, 2008, Steve Dallas was shown barging into the Bloom County Animal Shelter's lobby demanding to see Opus, claiming Opus owed him $20. The clerk stationed there informed Steve that Opus had chosen his final eternity and that Steve should do so likewise, and very quickly. The conversation ended with Steve finally realizing he was in a cartoon strip by breaking the fourth wall and asking the clerk who \"all those scruffy-looking people [are]\" as he looked at the readers, to which the clerk replied, \"Probably Democrats at this point,\" since he did this after dropping his towel, standing naked (but with a censor bar over his groin).\n\nThe next week, Steve found the tropical island girls and told them to give back Opus. It was then revealed that Opus had let his doggy companion in the shelter go with the girls, said \"goodnight\", and returned to the kennel. After seeing a vision of former \"Bloom County\" residents (Milo, Binkley, Oliver, Cutter John, Portnoy, and Bill the Cat) waving goodbye as they rode off into the distance atop Cutter John's wheelchair, Steve walked back to the animal shelter to find nothing but Opus' bow tie and an empty kennel. The final strip showed a glowing light coming from a box inside the kennel. Steve reaches into the box, and smiles at what he sees. The panel showed the address of a link to the Humane Society, which displayed the last panel as part of the $10,000 contest (it would later be printed in \" Berkeley Breathed's Opus: The Complete Library\"). The final strip showed Steve opening a copy of \"Goodnight Moon\" and seeing Opus tucked in bed, sleeping peacefully with a mother rabbit watching over him.\n\nThe 2015 revival of the \"Bloom County\" comic strip reveals that Opus is still alive, only that he has been unconscious the past 25 years and that the events of \"Opus\" and \"Outland\" were all an elaborate dream sequence.\n\nIn numerous interviews before launching \"Opus\", Berke Breathed stated his hopes that the strip would help reinvigorate the medium of newspaper comics. He criticized many modern strips, especially \"Garfield\", for lacking expressive artwork or original humor.\n\nIn an interview appearing in the April 2007 issue of \"Texas Monthly\", Breathed announced that he planned to end the strip by killing off the main character. On April 2, 2007 the journal \"Editor & Publisher\" reported on this interview in a story titled \"Will Cartoonist Berkeley Breathed Kill Off Opus the Penguin?\" However, Breathed's editor has reportedly quoted him as stating, \"I mentioned Opus' literal death just for talking points on my [book] tour coming up. Not gonna kill him, but it's good for copy.\" Breathed confirmed that he was joking in an interview with Salon: \"I was kidding about killing Opus, by the way. I'd like to walk the streets free from fears of spontaneous garroting.\"\n\nIn August 2008, the strip began a sequence playing off the 2007 interview, as \"the Creator\" of the strip informed Opus that \"the end is near.\" The strip ended on Sunday, November 2, 2008, with Opus snugly in bed at the conclusion of \"Goodnight Moon\".\n\nThe original syndication contract for \"Opus\" stipulated that the strip occupy an entire half of a newspaper page. According to The Washington Post Writers Group, this was to provide \"space for Breathed to offer richness and depth, similar to the breathtaking imagery in his popular children's books.\" While this style can appear hand-painted or airbrushed, it is actually rendered by Breathed on a computer using Adobe Photoshop. The half-page requirement was subsequently lifted, and the strip scaled down by most newspapers. Its original illustration style has also been largely abandoned in favor of a more hand-drawn look, much like that of Breathed's previous strip, \"Outland\".\n\nInitially, in an effort to help boost physical newspaper sales, the strip was barred from appearing online; however, in 2005, that too changed and \"Opus\" became officially available on the web.\n\nOn August 26, 2007, the strip featured Lola Granola wearing a headscarf, explaining that she was now a \"radical Islamist.\" The cartoon was not printed by the \"Washington Post\" and many other papers. The following week's strip was also censored. Both strips were replaced by more innocuous strips in the printed versions, but the 'objectionable' strips relating to Lola's religious beliefs were offered in a variety of Internet comics sites, including Breathed's homepage and the \"My Comics Page\" site. This site now requires a paid \"pro\" registration for access to the censored strips, but free access to the censored strips is still available online.\n\nIn August 2006 The Weinstein Company revealed in a press release for an animated version of \"The Nutty Professor\" that it had a \"CG-animated project\" called \"Opus\" \"in the works\". Numerous online movie databases, including \"The New York Times\", have entries for the movie, titled \"Opus: The Last Christmas\", and give a release date of December 19, 2008. Some of these sites name Berkeley Breathed as the director, while others list Tim Bjorklund and Paul Taylor. Initially, Miramax Films was reported to have obtained the movie rights to the series, but the project migrated to The Weinstein Company with the departure of the Weinstein brothers from Disney and Miramax.\n\nHowever, on May 8, 2007, during an interview by NPR radio host Diane Rehm, Mr. Breathed responded to an e-mail question regarding the existence of \"Opus: The Last Christmas\" by saying,\n\nIn a June 2007 interview with Salon.com, Breathed confirmed that the Miramax feature was \"dead\", but left the door open for an independently produced Opus film:\n"}

To progress in the game, players are tasked to move between platforms and solve puzzles. Similarly to \"The Blind Forest\", \"Will of the Wisps\" is expected to feature a system called \"soul links\", which allows players to save at will, and an upgrade system that gives players the ability to strengthen Ori's skills. The game world unfolds to the player in the fashion of a Metroidvania, with new abilities allowing the player to access previously inaccessible areas. Some of the foundational gameplay elements were inspired by the \"Rayman\" and \"Metroid\" franchises.\n\nThe game story is centered on a new adventure to discover the world beyond the forest of Nibel, uncover the truths of the lost ones, and unearth Ori's true destiny.\n\nThe game was announced at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2017 (E3) on 11 June 2017 with a teaser trailer.

Moon Studios lead developers Gennadiy Korol and Thomas Mahler commented that the team is \"crazy iterative\" when developing the game. For example, the E3 2017 teaser trailer went through 2,000 iterations during polishing. As for setting the standard and vision of the game, Mahler said that \"\"Will of the Wisps\" should be to \"Blind Forest\" what \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" was to the original \"Super Mario Bros.\".\n\nOn 7 August 2017, \"AM2R\" developer Milton Guasti was announced to have joined the Ori team as a level designer. Moon Studios released a video in October 2017 that showcased the design program used to develop cinematics of the game. The program reportedly allowed animators to make changes while in progress and thus allows for a more flexible and streamlined process.\n\nA second trailer was revealed at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018 on June 10 2018, depicting new NPCs, bosses, movement and combat abilities, and revealing its 2019 release date.\n\n\"Ori and the Will of the Wisps\" is scheduled to be released in 2019.\n\n"}

His mother was teacher and writer Viola Spolin, who authored the first book on improvisation techniques, \"Improvisation for the Theater\". Spolin in turn was the student of play therapy theorist Neva Boyd.\n\nIn 1948, Sills enrolled in the University of Chicago, where he established himself as a director, co-founding Playwright's Theater Club. There, with fellow actors Edward Asner, Byrne Piven and Zohra Lampert, they blended Spolin's improvisational techniques with established theater training.\n\nIn 1955, Sills and David Shepherd founded the Compass Players, the first improvisational theater in the United States, where he directed Shelley Berman, Mike Nichols and Elaine May. In 1959, Sills, along with partners Howard Alk and Bernie Sahlins, opened a theatre called The Second City where revues developed improvisationally were presented under Sills's direction. With early cast members Alan Arkin, Barbara Harris, Severn Darden, Mina Kolb and Paul Sand, success led to New York (a brief run on Broadway and a long one off-Broadway), London and world recognition. \n\nSills left Second City in 1965 to form the Game Theater, where he coached his mother, Viola Spolin's improvisational techniques in performance and audience participation was encouraged. His mother and other community friends were partners. The Parents School was co-founded there, with wife Carol and others, with a children's curriculum based on group art forms and play. It operated for almost two decades. At the Game Theater, he also discovered a new form he called Story Theater, which debuted at 1848 N. Wells Street, during the summer of 1968. That building was the original location of the Second City, which had already moved to its new and current location at 1616 N. Wells St. After Sills finished doing Story Theater there, it was torn down. \"Story Theatre\" went on to play at Yale University, in Los Angeles and on Broadway, remaining the form Sills explored for the rest of his life.

The prima donna was normally, but not necessarily, a soprano. The corresponding term for the male lead (almost always a tenor) is primo uomo.\n\n\"Prime donne\" often had grand off-stage personalities and were seen as demanding of their colleagues. From its original usage in opera, the term has spread in contemporary usage to refer to anyone behaving in a demanding or temperamental fashion or having an inflated view of oneself and a narcissistic attitude.\n\nIn 19th-century Italy, the leading woman in an opera or Commedia dell'arte company was known as the \"prima donna\", literally the \"first lady\". This woman, usually the principal soprano of the company, would typically perform leading roles and generally sang more music than other women in the company. Famous opera prime donne have often caused opera enthusiasts to divide into opposing \"clubs\" supporting one singer over another. The rivalry between the fans of Maria Callas and Renata Tebaldi, for example, was one of the most famous, despite the friendship of the two singers.\n\nThe designation \"prima donna assoluta\" (absolute first lady) is occasionally applied to a prima donna of outstanding excellence. It has also been used to describe the creators of heroic coloratura roles in the first half of the 19th century.\n\nAt times, these \"prime donne\" (the Italian plural form) were grand with their off-stage personalities and demands on fellow troupe members, musicians, set and wardrobe designers, producers and other staff, but were deferentially tolerated because of their consummate talent and their draw at the box office. From this experience, the term \"prima donna\" has come into common usage in any field denoting someone who behaves in a demanding, often temperamental fashion, revealing an inflated view of themselves, their talent, and their importance. Due to this association, the contemporary meaning of the word has taken on this negative connotation of a vain, undisciplined, egotistical, obnoxious or temperamental person who finds it difficult to work under direction or as part of a team, but whose contributions are essential to the success of a team.\n\n\n"}

The game's plot centers on the efforts of the titular Rabbids to collect as many human objects as they can and create a huge pile high enough to reach the Moon, all the while avoiding the extermination attempts by the \"Verminators\", who wish to gain back the stuff the Rabbids have stolen.\n\nThe game received generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised the game's humor, soundtrack and accessible gameplay, though some noted the game's low difficulty The reviews for the Nintendo DS version were mixed.\n\nThe online services for the game were shut down on August 8, 2014.\n\nThe player controls a team of two Rabbids on a rampage pushing a shopping cart. The goal of the game is to go to human places such as malls, hospitals and other such places to collect as much stuff as possible during each level and help the Rabbids build a pile high enough to reach the Moon. In each level, there is enough stuff to grow the pile by 1,000 feet. The minimum requirement for completing a level is to collect the \"Xtra Large Stuff\" and carry it to the toilet at the end of the level and unlock new items for the Rabbids like figurines, tattoos, tools, accessories and challenges depending on the score. The Xtra Large Stuff is located either in the middle or end of a level. Some Xtra Large items affect the gameplay. For example, a jet engine will propel the shopping cart to three times its normal speed, while a sickly patient's quarantine bed allows the cart to \nfloat and glide. Placed throughout the levels are \"Collector Rabbids\", with which the player can leave any stuff they have collected up to that point. The health of the Rabbids (described in-game as \"ideas\") is measured in light bulbs, which fry out when the Rabbids take damage and get collected to refill. At the start of the game, the Rabbids will have three light bulbs, displayed at the bottom-left corner of the screen. Later in the game, you can earn up to 6 light bulbs. If all of the light bulbs burn out, a cutscene will play when the last light bulb goes out then the Rabbid yells BWAAAH! then the Rabbids will get set back to an automated checkpoint, and if all of the stuff they have collected is lost, they'll reappear next to the most recent Collector Rabbid they've met.\n\nThe player can move the shopping cart with the Nunchuk attachment and accelerate using the A button. The Rabbids' main mode of offense is a loud vocalization called the \"Bwaaaah! Attack\", which can be triggered by shaking the Wii Remote. This attack can break certain objects, stun enemies like guard dogs, scaring humans and stripping them of their clothing. As the player advances through the game, the Verminators and robots appear and humans will start wearing soundproof helmets to protect themselves from the \"Bwaaaah! Attack\". The player can perform another technique named the \"Super Boost\", which is initiated when the shopping cart turns and drifts to the point where blue sparks fly from under the cart's wheels. When the player presses the A button and turn, and when blue sparks are coming from the wheels, and presses the B button, the \"Super Boost\" will be performed. This ability allows the player to knock down piles of crates, strip certain enemies faster and leap over obstacles through the use of springboards. The player can also launch the \"Cannonball Rabbid\", a Rabbid living inside the player's Wii Remote, by aiming with the Wii Remote and pressing the Z button on the Nunchuk attachment. This attack can strip certain enemies and open certain grates marked with \"Tag\".\n\nAt several points during the game, a rabbid is \"drawn\" into the Wii Remote itself, and can be thrown and bounced around while \"inside\" the remote as the screen displays an apparent interior view of the remote.\n\nAfter invading Earth and partying intensely, the Rabbids are ready to get back home. Due to having the attention span of a goldfish, they decide to go to the moon, which they think is a giant light bulb. They come up with a plan to collect all of the human stuff they can find, heap it onto a giant pile and climb to the Moon. They gather the human objects and fit them all into one shopping cart, transfer all of the stuff they have found through the sewage system via a series of toilets and add the stuff to their growing pile, which becomes higher as the game progresses. Eventually, the humans revolt against the Rabbids and become \"Verminators\" in a bid to exterminate the Rabbids and retrieve their stolen stuff.\n\nAt the end of the game, the Rabbids are still not able to reach the moon, even after gathering almost everything from the city. The humans bombard the pile with time-delay bombs which explode on the pile, causing the pile to fly up into space. At the result of that, the XL junk falls from the sky and the humans panic. After all of the stuff has stopped falling, the humans are over-joyed to have all of their stuff back. In space, the Rabbids celebrate their accomplishment of finally reaching the moon, albeit caught in the moon's gravitational orbit.\n\n\"Rabbids Go Home\" underwent three years of development before its release. A coherent and authentic storyline was needed to keep the Rabbids fresh and conserve their variety in the context of an adventure game. The development team evaluated the Rabbids as representing \"emotions pushed to the extreme\" and created the human characters to be the exact opposite: \"[They] mull over all their decisions, their emotions in-check. Their organs have atrophied. They have nearly forgotten that they have a body or a heart, and can barely handle those.\" Jacques Exertier stated that the meeting between the two opposing characters is an allegory of the \"internal debates we have with ourselves each time we make a decision\" and that much of the comedic situations in the game stem from the meeting of the two archetypes. The setting of \"Rabbids Go Home\" was visually inspired by the period between 1945 and 1975, during which there was an explosion in mass consumption. The visuals were based on simple colors and geometric shapes rather than photorealism to create a caricaturized image of its \"uptight humans with their sterile places and normalized urban planning\". \"Rabbids Go Home\" is the first video game to feature the LyN, which was created alongside the game. The game was announced on April 9, 2009. On November 17, 2009, Ubisoft denied a rumor that the game would be recalled from United Kingdom shops due to \"inappropriate language\". As a result of this, the game has been re-rated a 12 in Europe. \n\nThe music of \"Rabbids Go Home\" was composed by Fanfare Vagabontu, a Moldovan gypsy brass band, but inspired from the Romanian folk music. A 12-track soundtrack was made available on the iTunes Music Store on November 17, 2009. The game also includes licensed songs such as \"Come Go With Me\" by The Del-Vikings, \"Louie Louie\" by Richard Berry, \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" by John Denver, \"Jamaica Farewell\" by Harry Belafonte, \"Somebody to Love\" by Jefferson Airplane, \"I Told You So\" by The Delfonics, \"Smarty Pants\" by First Choice, \"Me and Mrs. Jones\" by Billy Paul and \"Rivers of Babylon\" by Boney M. The licensed music is primarily heard coming from radios and loudspeakers in various areas of the game and can be shut off (or quieted down) by destroying said loudspeakers and radios.\n\nThe Wii version of \"Rabbids Go Home\" received generally favorable reviews from critics. Pedro Hernandez of \"Nintendo World Report\" praised the game's \"inventive\" uses for the Wii Remote, \"easy-to-get-into\" gameplay, \"deep\" Rabbid customization modes, \"great\" soundtrack and \"incredible\" sense of humor, but noted the redundancy of the gameplay and inconsistent framerate as weak points. \"NGamer UK\" concluded that \"the Rabbids can pull off a fully fledged game without Rayman's assistance. This is witty, charming and, above all, incredible fun.\" \"GamesMaster UK\" described the game as \"witty, energetic and hugely entertaining, even if it isn't particularly smart.\" Matt Casamassina of IGN stated that the game was \"far more inspired and ambitious\" than \"Rayman Raving Rabbids\" and said that the title \"at times feels like an action romp and at times a platformer on wheels, but regardless of the scenario, you'll be having fun and smiling if not laughing.\" Chris Scullion of \"Official Nintendo Magazine UK\" considered \"Rabbids Go Home\" to be \"the funniest game on the Wii\" and commented positively on the \"tight\" controls and \"fantastic\" soundtrack, but stated that the game was too easy. Aceinet of GameZone praised the game's humor and \"ever-changing\" gameplay, concluding with a reminder that \"games are supposed to be fun and \"Rabbids Go Home\" is a fun-filled experience that shouldn’t be missed regardless of the score.\" Aaron Koehn of GamePro pointed out that the game draws its strength from its odd tone, but added that the simplicity of the gameplay becomes tiresome. Dan Pearson of Eurogamer noted that the \"constant enthusiasm\" of the Rabbids can be \"draining\" to some and said that the game wasn't for hardcore gaming enthusiasts. Annette Gonzalez of \"Game Informer\" said that the animations were \"laugh-out-loud\", but some of the gameplay sequences were \"repetitive\". Matt Leone of 1UP.com remarked that the licensed soundtrack and customization features added enough personality to make the game worth playing. \"Nintendo Power\" concluded that while the game was too easy, it was \"a definite step in the right direction for the Rabbids, and I hope to see them continue this way.\" Tom McShea of GameSpot commented positively on the character creator, unlockable content and cutscenes, but said that the early levels were too easy and simple and the game became repetitive.\n\nReviews for the Nintendo DS version were mixed. \"NGamer UK\" called the game \"the best example of the genre we've seen in ages.\" \"Nintendo Power\" said that the game's style of puzzle is \"perfect\" for touch-screen control and noted that the ability to customize challenges \"adds a lot of replay value to this latest exercise in Rabbid abuse.\" Chris Scullion of \"Official Nintendo Magazine UK\" criticized the game's \"broken\" physics, \"universally dull\" minigames and \"irritating\" gameplay, but noted that the cutscenes were \"decent\" and the level editor is \"solid\".\n"}
{"id": "2093486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2093486", "title": "Resident Evil Outbreak", "text": "Resident Evil Outbreak\n\nResident Evil Outbreak, released in Japan as , is a survival horror video game with online playability for the PlayStation 2. Initially released in 2003, it was developed by Capcom Production Studio 1 and was the first entry in the \"Resident Evil\" video game series (11th overall) to feature cooperative gameplay and online multiplayer support, although online support was not available for the PAL versions of the game.\n\n\"Outbreak\" was produced by Tsuyoshi Tanaka, and depicts a series of episodic storylines in the fictional location Raccoon City. It was set during the same general time period as \"Resident Evil 2\" and \"\". \"Outbreak\" was followed by a standalone expansion entitled \"Resident Evil Outbreak File #2\". The game was praised for the graphics, fun-factor, and multiplayer but criticized for the lack of voice chat.\n\nThe controls and gameplay are similar to the Resident Evil remake, which was exclusive to the Nintendo Gamecube, with quite a few adjustments. The player chooses a scenario, difficulty level, and a character. The difficulty level is tied to what enemies and items the player encounters as they progress through the scenario. The game has five scenarios, each of which has an event checklist consisting of special actions that the player must perform to reach 100% completion. Upon doing so the player will unlock \"Infinity Mode\", in which all the player's weapons never break or run out of ammunition.\n\nEach scenario also has \"SP\" items. These are invisible items hidden throughout the level and are randomly generated on two paths. There are 20 scenario items for each scenario, and twenty items specific to each character hidden across the five scenarios. If acquired, these items unlock new costumes and the option to listen to their ad-libs.\n\nPlayers were able to connect to the internet servers using a broadband connection and a network adapter. Account registration and login were required. Once players connected and logged in, they would choose between Free Mode and Scenario Mode. Free Mode took place in a lobby and allowed players to create their own games, scenarios, and difficulty level. Scenario Mode would choose the scenario and players automatically. When a player first started online, they would begin on the \"Outbreak\" scenario and progress from there. If the player wished to stop playing, they could save their data and restart from the scenario they were up to at the time. If the player had beaten a scenario, they acquired a star next to their name.\n\nCapcom shut down the American servers for \"Outbreak\" on December 31, 2007, and the Japanese servers on June 30, 2011, ending official online capabilities. In 2014, private servers became available to Japanese editions of \"Resident Evil Outbreak\".\n\nThe beginning of \"Outbreak\" is set a couple of days after the initial outbreak of the T-virus in Raccoon City, moments before the crisis further escalates into complete chaos. The game starts with the eight characters in J's Bar, who are unaware of what is happening until a lone zombie wanders into the bar and attacks one of the employees named Will. After that, the characters must make it through the city. The game ends in the final moments of the same incident, with the player attempting to escape Raccoon City before the U.S. government launches a missile strike to eliminate the threat posed by the T-virus. The player controls one of eight characters, in order: Kevin Ryman, Mark Wilkins, Jim Chapman, George Hamilton, David King, Alyssa Ashcroft, Yoko Suzuki, and Cindy Lennox, along with numerous supporting characters who can be selected in their place. Gameplay events transpire across various regions of Raccoon City and span over a period of several days.\n\nThere are five individual scenarios in this game, which are not set in chronological order. The first, \"Outbreak\", takes place at the beginning of the outbreak, as the police prepare to destroy the zombie horde using explosives. \"Below Freezing Point\" deals with the events in the former underground laboratory of Umbrella before the events of \"Resident Evil 2\", where a rogue virologist, Monica, attempts to steal bio-weapons research and deal with her former co-worker, Yoko Suzuki. \"The Hive\" involves the survivors taking refuge in the Raccoon General Hospital, which is also featured in \"\", while it is under assault from a colony of infected leeches. \"Hellfire\", set the same day as \"Outbreak\", involves a group of survivors fleeing into the Apple Inn hotel that turns out to be on fire and swarming with lickers. The final scenario, \"Decisions, Decisions\", regards the survivors' search for a cure to the T-virus, which sends them to Raccoon City University, where the eight different characters must wisely choose a decision to survive the puzzling secrets hidden in the university; they must then escape the city before it is destroyed.\n\nAccording to an interview with producer Noritaka Funamizu, the first concept of \"Biohazard Outbreak\", as it was known originally, was known before the release of \"Resident Evil 2\" in 1998. With growing interest in the concept of network gaming over consoles, Shinji Mikami, the director of the first \"Resident Evil\", suggested to Funamizu that he should have a try. Early on in the design, Funamizu made a small multi-player mini-game in which the player must survive the longest time possible; the team decided to remove it due to its failure to encourage teamwork—players would instinctively run away from the horde and be slaughtered rather than help one another to ensure their own survival. They decided that what made \"Resident Evil\" scary was its lack of multiplayer, forcing gamers to play \"on their own\". The team then chose that the game would follow its own story like the other games in the series, but keep the option for multi-player. The game development was later put on hold.\n\nPrior to 2002, Capcom decided to revive development of the game, based on the research gathered from the first attempt. Production Studio 1 began its development of the game, as opposed to Mikami's Studio 4. In February 2002, a Sony press conference regarding the PlayStation 2 revealed the game—previously unheard-of by the public, it had a working title of \"Biohazard Online\". This led to confusion amongst the audience before Capcom released a statement confirming its existence. \"Resident Evil Outbreak\" was a part of an initiative from Capcom's Production Studio 1 to develop three network focused games on the PlayStation 2. The other games were \"Auto Modellista\" and \"Monster Hunter\". Capcom's goal was to have at least one of the games reach a million sales. Both \"Monster Hunter\" and \"Resident Evil Outbreak\" eventually reached this goal.\n\nThe game made an appearance at Sony's conference on May 21 at E 2002, with a video showcasing real-time 3D backgrounds (as opposed to pre-rendered); revealing four of the characters and demonstrating the ad-lib system and character communication. The \"ad-lib system\" was chosen over conventional microphone chat because the development team argued that it would ruin the atmosphere. Instead, limited chat options were used for conversation between users; a player would walk up to another and deliver a line from a particular conversational category (e.g. \"help\" and \"go\" categories). No solid release date was given at that time.\n\nLater that year the game was renamed \"Biohazard Network\". By October, eighteen different scenarios were in development, with even more in the concept phase. In November, Capcom released various pieces of media, showing eight playable characters and familiar-scenarios such as \"Flashback\". The occupations of the characters were also given.\n\nIn January 2003, further information was provided, mostly regarding interactive NPCs (non-player characters). Capcom boasted such actions as enemy NPCs who would attack the player and other ones that would run away when approached. Screenshots of \"Flashback\", \"Underbelly\", \"The Hive\" and other scenarios were released.\n\nBy May 2003, the game's title had been changed. This time, it had been changed to \"Biohazard Outbreak\" (\"Resident Evil Outbreak\" outside Japan), and the number of scenarios was reduced to the five scenarios. Another five scenarios did not make the initial cut, although they were complete enough to be featured in the E3 2002 trailer, and were developed into the sequel \"Resident Evil Outbreak File #2\". In September, doubts were raised as to \"Outbreak\"s online game-play in Europe, but Capcom was adamant that it would at least try to find a way to solve the problem in time for release.\n\nThe European release was heavily delayed, finally released in September 2004—nine months after Japan and the United States saw its release. Back in March Capcom had given in on securing \"Outbreak\"s network due to the numerous problems faced with establishing a network in a region simultaneously for dozens of languages, and securing service providers; as well as the usual PAL/NTSC differential.\n\n\"Outbreak\"' received a \"C+\" from \"1UP\" in their review. The staff referred to it as \"another typical entry in the RE canon\", and as a \"competent game\" with \"controls [that] are actually functional and somewhat intuitive\". However, they cited a number of problems with the game, notably Capcom's choice of not installing voice chat in favor of the ad-lib system. They found the game's five scenarios to be short, and AI partners to be \"chock-full of repetitive and annoying sound bytes\".\n\n\"Eurogamer\" was disappointed with Capcom's failure to establish online support for the European market at a time when the PlayStation 2's online community was threatened with the expected rise in the Xbox's popularity with the upcoming release of \"Halo 2\", stating that an Outbreak was \"designed from the ground up to be a co-operative multiplayer game for four players\" and questioning if a network-less game would be of interest to players. Another problem was with the real-time \"START\" menu, which meant that file-reading and item-trading would make the player vulnerable to a random zombie attack, making the game \"[feel] light in the story department\" as a consequence of not becoming immersed in the environment. Long load times for the PAL version was also noted in the review.\n"}

Based in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, Sight & Sound operates two theaters: one in Ronks, Pennsylvania (formerly known as the \"Millennium Theatre\") and the second in Branson, Missouri.\n\nGlenn and Shirley Eshelman started Sight & Sound in the summer of 1976, with a 10-week multimedia show \"The Wonder of It All\" in an auditorium rented from Lancaster Bible College. Based on that success, they built the original Sight & Sound Auditorium (renamed to Living Waters Theatre) on Rt 896 in Ronks, Pennsylvania. In July 1976, the Sight & Sound Auditorium opened for the performance of \"A Land of Our Own\". Live actors and actresses were eventually added to the productions, and Behold the Lamb debuted as the first full-length live stage production at the original Sight & Sound Auditorium in 1987. A larger facility, the Sight & Sound Entertainment Centre opened in March 1991.\n\nHowever, after the success of their productions \"Noah\" and the premiere run of \"The Miracle of Christmas\", the Entertainment Centre caught fire in January 1997, destroying the facility and most of the costumes and sets that were stored in the shops. The animals were killed in the same fire. The Living Waters Theatre was renovated to accommodate live stage productions until another large theater, originally called The Millennium Theater, was opened on September 1, 1998. The new theatre featured more than 2,000 seats, a wraparound stage that can hold sets up to 40 feet high, and improved audio and visual effects.\n\nSight & Sound opened a second theater in Branson, Missouri in 2008, a near identical twin facility to the newest facility in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29273517", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29273517", "title": "Sport in Venezuela", "text": "Sport in Venezuela\n\nThe major sports in Venezuela are baseball, basketball and football. Baseball in Venezuela originates with the early 20th century cultural influence of the United States oil companies. The Venezuelan Professional Baseball League was established in 1945. Football in Venezuela lags behind baseball, but its popularity in recent years has grown. Basketball and volleyball are also popular sports; there has been a national basketball league since 1974. The Vuelta a Venezuela is one of six cycling events in the UCI America Tour. The polo club Lechuza Caracas has had some success in North American polo competitions.\n\nIn international competitions, Venezuela has participated in the Olympics since 1948, and the Winter Olympic Games since 1998. It won its first Olympic medal in 1952 when Asnoldo Devonish won bronze in the Men's Triple Jump, and its first Olympic gold in 1968 (Francisco Rodríguez, light flyweight boxing). Venezuela first competed in the Paralympics in 1984, and won its first Paralympic gold in 2008 (Naomi Soazo, judo).\n\nVenezuela participates in the Pan American Games and the Central American and Caribbean Games, with Caracas hosting these games in 1959 and 1983 respectively. Venezuela has had a Davis Cup team since 1957.\n\nThough golf is a minor sport under pressure in Venezuela, the emergence of Jhonattan (Johnny) Vegas on the PGA Tour in 2011 and his strong showing as a rookie there has raised its profile.\n\nOn October 22, 1941 the Venezuelan baseball team defeated the Cuban baseball team in the World Amateur Baseball tournament. Since the victory was unexpected because Cuba was heavily favored, it sent the country into a craze. A week later when the team returned to Venezuela over one hundred thousand people lined up along a twenty-mile road from La Guaria to the capital to welcome them back. At the time that was more than a third of the country's population. Another fact to show the magnitude of the celebration is that government offices, businesses, and schools closed down to celebrate. The players were even greeted by President Gen at the Isaías Medina Angrita and many other high power people. The defeat of Cuba was recognized as a Hazaña at the time, which means a heroic feat. Later in the year 2000, the country's association sports writers established the defeat as the countries most important sporting event of the twentieth century. Since that “heroic” moment, the major spark of the sport of baseball escalated itself to be Venezuela's dominant sport. The Venezuelan Professional Baseball League was established in 1945, with Leones del Caracas the leading team; another leading club is Valencia's Navegantes del Magallanes, established in 1917. There is a Venezuelan Summer League (established in 1997) and winter league (Liga Paralela). Venezuelan teams have won the Caribbean Series a number of times.\n\nThe Venezuela national baseball team won the Baseball World Cup several times in the 1940s, and the Baseball tournament at the Pan American Games in 1959.\n\nVenezuelan players in US-Canadian Major League Baseball number over 200 since 1939. The Luis Aparicio Award was established in 2004, in honor of Luis Aparicio, the only Venezuelan ballplayer to have been introduced into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. The award is given annually to honor the Venezuelan player who recorded the best individual performance in Major League Baseball, as voted on by sports journalists in Venezuela.\n\nBehind baseball, the most popular sport in Venezuela is basketball. Traditionally, the national team has been one of the three elite teams in South America. The country hosted the 2012 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying tournament and the 2013 FIBA Americas Championship. The (English: \"Venezuelan Basketball Federation\") controls the men's and women's basketball teams. Venezuela has been home to several elite basketball players who have competed in the world's top basketball tournaments and leagues throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia. These players include Óscar Torres, Richard Lugo, Carl Herrera and most notably Greivis Vásquez.\n\nThe Liga Professional de Baloncesto is the main Venezuelan Basketball League, which features 14 teams.\n\nFootball in Venezuela has gradually become popular and a mainstream sport with baseball, but baseball is still known as the country's sport. This is believed because of how mainstream baseball is played and the success of Venezuelan players in the MLB (Major League Baseball). Also, it's believed that the failure for football to become as popular as baseball in the country is because the national team has not done so well at international level. Venezuela is the only team to not have qualified for a World Cup in South America, excluding Suriname, Guyana and French Guiana, who, although a part of continental South America, participate in the CONCACAF qualifying region. Even though they have never qualified for the World Cup, they do play in one of the hardest brackets with some of the top football countries in the world, such as Brazil and Argentina.\n\nVenezuela football has had a rough history throughout the years, especially with its national team, and have been looked at as pushovers. The team is known as the La Vinotinto (The Red Wine) due to their dark burgundy jerseys showcasing the same dark color as red wine (shown in the adjacent picture). The Federación Venezolana de Fútbol was established in 1926 following the creation of the Liga Venezolana in 1921. The Venezuela national football team played their first game in 1938. Professionalism was not established until 1957 with the Copa de Venezuela arriving two years later. The Vinotinto have struggled ever since the beginning of the national team competing for The World Cup in England in 1966. From then to the 1994, attempting to qualify for The World Cup series in America, the team was known as the \"whipping boys,\" for how badly they lost to other teams. Within this time span they competed in seven qualifying campaigns, playing a total of sixty five matches consisting a record of seven wins, seven draws, and fifty-one losses. Along with a poor of record, their goal difference was negative ninety-nine, meaning that they were scored on ninety-nine more times than they scored on opponents. Two years later, 1998, a new rule changed to the format of the qualifying process gave a little hope for the Venezuela team to compete for a World Cup because it was now easier for them to qualify. It was made easier for the team to qualify because of the new point system and matches against weaker teams. The expectations of Venezuela to have a chance to qualify were quickly shot down after the team actually started to play worse. The team play better in their previous campaigns with the harder qualifying rules than with the new.\n\nThe next season, a new head coach was chosen by the Venezuelan Football Federation (FVF). The new coach was Richard Páez, he was a former Venezuelan football player. He coached the Vinotinto until the beginning of the 2010 World Cup qualifiers where he unexpectedly resigned. In his time as head coach he revolutionized the team with the help of a younger and newer players, helping them become a winning team instead of being known as the \"whipping boys.\" He led the team to its first ever victory over Uruguay, who then fired their head coach for the loss. After the famous 3-0 win, Páez said that \"as a country, we have earned the right to savor this triumph after thirty six years of humiliation\". In 2007 the Copa América tournament was held in Venezuela where the Vinotinto won its second ever match in the tournament. They went on to be undefeated, winning their bracket, until losing the quarter finals to Uruguay 4-1. The tournament was a huge success in bringing the country closer to the National Team. It is said for, a brief moment, football the nations favorite sport. This new enthusiasm towards the team also brought higher expectations of the team as well. When coach Páez resigned, he was replaced with César Farías where he continued Páez's revolution of the National team. He currently is coaching the team and has also helped the youth of Venezuela football players increasing the intensity of play at each level which produces better players for the Vinotinto. The 2014 World Cup Series will be the best and closest chance to becoming a qualifier for the Vinotinto.\n\nAn under-20 team, an under-17 team, and a women's team also compete.\n\nNotable Venezuelan tennis players include:\n\nRugby union is a popular team sport in Venezuela. Rugby union is considered the fourth most popular sport in Venezuela, after baseball, football, and basketball.\n\nJhonattan Vegas is Venezuela's most famous golfer, he was born in Maturin, Venezuela. He played college golf at the University of Texas.\n\nVegas turned professional in 2008 and started playing the Nationwide tour in 2009.\nVegas represented Venezuela in the 2009 Omega Mission Hills World Cup with Alfredo Adrian. They finished tied for twelfth place. Vegas won his first Nationwide Tour event in 2010 at the Preferred Health Systems Wichita Open. He finished the season seventh on the money list and earned his 2011 PGA Tour card, the first Venezuelan to do so.\n\nIn 2011, Vegas, competing as Johnny Vegas, won the Bob Hope Classic in La Quinta, California, and a week later finished tied for third in the Farmers Insurance Open at the Torrey Pines Golf Course, a municipal public golf course in San Diego. He was also Venezuela's representative in golf for the 2016 Summer Olympics. On 30 July 2017 Vegas successfully defended his title at the RBC Canadian Open for his third PGA Tour win. His play earned him another place in history at the 2017 Presidents Cup as the first Venezuelan to compete in the event.\n\nThe sport has come under criticism from, and courses have been closed by, President Hugo Chávez. \"Several years ago, Chávez closed three courses in the Vegas family's home state, Monagas. All were essentially clubs for workers in the nation's wealthy oil industry. Vegas's father, Carlos, who at one time worked as a caddie and later became a food concessionaire to two of the clubs, decided his son would have to leave Venezuela if he were to pursue golf seriously.\n... [Chávez] has called it a 'bourgeois sport' played primarily by lazy, rich people in carts. He has closed six of the country's courses and said the government should appropriate private urban land for public housing. 'Do you mean to tell me this is a people's sport?' he said in 2009. 'It is not.' ... After Vegas won the Hope Classic, Chávez, who has not, it is believed, put buildings on any of the courses, proclaimed that he was not 'an enemy of golf, or any other sport.' He said he would call to congratulate Vegas. 'He beat all of the gringos,' he said. ... Vegas talked about having spoken with Chávez, and what he [Vegas] hopes will come about as a result of the chat: perhaps a friendlier attitude toward the sport.\"\n\nThe Caracas Country Club, associated with the United States and the oil industry and designed in the 1920s by the Olmsted Brothers, along with another club in the capital city, were under pressure to close in late 2010. Heavy rains had accentuated a severe housing shortage, and the president saw both political and land-use reasons for change.\n\nVenezuela has produced some notable competitors in motorsport. Johnny Cecotto enjoyed a successful career in both motorcycle and car racing. He won the 250cc and 350cc races on his Grand Prix debut at the 1975 French Grand Prix, on the way to winning the 350cc world championship in his rookie year. He went on to win a total of 14 Grands Prix between 1975 and 1980, including three in the top 500cc class. He subsequently switched to four wheels, scoring two wins and finishing as runner up in the 1982 European Formula Two championship and racing in Formula One in 1983 and 1984. After F1 he was successful in touring car racing, winning the Macau Grand Prix Guia Race in 1986, the Italian Superturismo Championship in 1989 and the German Super Tourenwagen Cup in 1994 and 1998. He also scored 14 wins in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft between 1988 and 1992, and finished runner-up in the championship in 1990. His son Johnny Cecotto Jr. is also a racing driver, scoring wins in the GP2 Series.\n\nAfter Cecotto's breakthrough fellow Venezuelans Carlos Lavado and Iván Palazzese also made an impact in Grand Prix motorcycling. Lavado scored 19 Grand Prix wins in the 250cc and 350cc classes and won the 250cc world championship in 1983. Palazzese scored consecutive wins in the 125cc class in the Swedish and Finnish Grands Prix in 1982 on his way to finishing third in the 125cc standings.\n\nMore recently Pastor Maldonado has emerged as Venezuela's most successful F1 racer, scoring his first F1 pole position and win at the 2012 Spanish Grand Prix. Previously Maldonado had been successful in GP2, scoring ten wins in the series and winning the championship in 2010.\n\nVenezuelan racers have also competed in top-level motorsport in North America in recent years, including E. J. Viso and Milka Duno.\n\nSwimming is a growing sport in Venezuela. Notable Venezuelan swimmers include: \n\nEl Juego del Garrote (The Garrote Game) or \"Garrote Larense\", is a Venezuelan martial art that involves machetes, garrote, and knife fencing.\n\n\"Corrida de toros\", or Bullfighting, in Venezuela is thought to be the least popular out of the five Latin American countries. Also, bullfighting is considered to be more of an art form that the Spanish colonist brought with them, but is still a sport. The modern sport started in the 19th century with the Spaniards arrival. The industry started from the city of San Cristóbal. The first bullrings were built of wood and didn't have many seats, but they eventually grew to the modern \"large bullring,\" such as the Nuevo de Caracas that was built in 1968. The industry now has 55 bullrings, more than twenty-five breeding farms for bullfighting bulls, and two schools to teach how to fight the bulls. Festivals were normally held in honor of the patron saint or Virgin. Two of the most important festivals held are the Feria de San Cristóbal and The Feria de Sol (Festival of the Sun). These festivals have one week where each night there is an event with about four or five matadors, the \"bullfighters,\" and an equal number of bulls. Even though these are two big events, bullfighting happens in these two places all year long. The quality of a bullfight, and how exciting the event is, is based upon the strength and power of the bull plus the skill of the matador. Bullfighting is legal in Venezuela because there is no national or state animal protection legislation that prevents animal cruelty.\n\nAlthough Baseball, basketball, and football are the top three sports in Venezuela, the sport of Coleo has been a favorite past time for many years. The sport is most popular in the eastern and southern regions of the country. The sport is similar to that of American Rodeo, where llaneros or cowboys, will chase cattle but most commonly a bull. There are about three to five llaneros on horseback that will compete against each other and the bull. The objective of the sport is to chase a bull around an enclosed area, about the length of an American football field (100 yards), and pull the animal down to the ground by grabbing its tail. Once a llanero takes down the bull, they must let bull back up so it can continue to run around the arena. They do this by \"twisting the bulls tail.\" Which ever llanero can get the bull down to the ground the most times out of the all the riders, will win. The chase lasts about five minutes. The sport can be very dangerous, just like rodeo, because the riders can fall of their horses and be trampled by the bull. Sometimes the bull can break a leg or become injured, and if this happens the bull is taken immediately to the slaughterhouse, the manga.\n\n"}

{"id": "48757861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48757861", "title": "Tellability", "text": "Tellability\n\nTellability is quality for which a story is told and examined as remarkable with its constructed merit. Ochs and Capps examine tellability as the reason a narrative is told. Namely speakers can transform any instance into a meaningful narrative, but most are tellable due to how they deviate from everyday happenings and the prototypical. A narrative changes dependent on its level of tellability, and these elements are largely contextual. The tellability of a story often parallels the perceived truth of the story.\n\nThe tellability of a narrative changes and is dependent on the audience, the content, the narrator, and more. This aspect of tellability directly thinks to Erving Goffman’s concept of Framing in his book Frame Analysis. Framing is the circumstances and tone by which any interaction is made, whether it be more of a sociable or professional frame changes the content of the interaction. According to this certain stories are more significant and appropriate in different social frames in comparison to others. Different frames change the tellability of a story and the means by which that story would be told.\n\nThe tellability of a story is influenced by the search for truth within the narrative, and this largely changes the story to reflect that truth to the audience. For a story to be tellable it must be believable to those listening. People are more willing to accept stories as true when they are more factual and not discouraging to their sense of security and comfort. Because of this speakers often have to reframe their narratives in order to have other people believe them, especially in different socio-political circumstances. Amy Shuman studies how narratives change in different contexts, and she specifically does research with asylum seekers. Shuman finds that, for a narrative to be believable, it must have an experience that has been told before, but it also must not be too common or people will see it as unremarkable or even just a copy of another’s personal experience. Because of this, while the narrator may have most control over the telling of the narrative, the believability of it is often up to the empathy and willingness of the audience, and so narratives are often constructed with the thought of the audience in mind. This is similar to the Heisenberg effect, wherein the very act of there being a different audience greatly changes the narrative at hand. Yet truth within a narrative is often not solely reflective of objective truth. Truth is often a reflection of the emotional response of the speaker from their story or it can be honing in on a particular element of the story.\n\nA key aspect of tellability is authenticity. Elinor Ochs and Lisa Capps both examine tellability of a narrative, and they find that the balance of the narrative’s authenticity and aesthetic is what allows for the content to have a believable narrative structure and therefore makes it tellable. Authenticity is the objective truth of the account being detailed in the narrative. Authenticity often takes on a linear structure, as it reflects the cause and effect relationship and temporal sequencing of the events that transpire. The aesthetic quality is the change in the narrative that the speaker adds to it, so that the narrative will feel more genuine in how personal it is. Aesthetic may change the structure by which the story is told so to reflect the emotional response of the narrator as well as highlight the aspect most important to the narrator. A story’s tellability is directly linked to its balance between authenticity and aesthetic, as the story must be both personal and factual in how it presents its truth. Folklorists often find that truth is the means by which tellability is implemented in the story, so tellability is to give an understanding as to whether the truth is an objective or subjective matter.\n\nIn certain circumstances the tellability of the narrative is created through how unbelievable it is, this is commonly happens with the chaotic narrative. The chaotic narrative is told loosely and fragmented as it is the only way the speaker can remember and retell certain traumatic events. While a linear story allows for a show of temporal sequencing and signifies a more objective perspective, the chaotic narrative’s unorganized and seemingly disordered sequencing reflects the believability of the story due to the sheer emotional reaction of the speaker. Yet some chaotic narratives are untellable simply because the speaker cannot bring themselves to relive those moments. Diane Goldstein studies the chaotic narrative in trauma stories and how their tellability fluctuates. The chaotic narrative is usually used with trauma stories, as the narrator is still deeply affected by the content and can only remember certain aspects of the story. While the speaker’s retelling of the events may not be perfectly true to everything that happened, the chaotic story is told in this fashion because of how severe the memory is to the speaker. Therefore, the story may come out disjointed and focusing on minute details, as that is how the narrator remembers it to be.\n\nMemory plays a major role in the tellability of a story, as memories are constantly changing and the lack of memory can often impede on the tellability of a story. In Untold Stories, Ochs and Capps detail the major role that memory plays in tellability. They explain that as people grow older their memories of the past change and therefore the very means by which the story changes. Some stories lose tellability as they are forgotten, others lose tellability in how the memory of them are so fragmented that they cannot be told as a story. In other instances people grow so far away from these certain memories that they no longer seem applicable or important to tell.\n\nTellability is also largely defined by the reasons for which a person chooses to tell a story. Some stories lack tellability for moral reasons, such as people not wanting to concern others with what they have experienced or to not hurt a listener’s feelings. Goldstein examines the foreknowledge and hindsight of telling a story in the wake of a major event. In her research she finds that people may make stories of small coincidences in the aftermath of a great public trauma so to create more drama. People may want to feel security in knowing that whatever events are meant to transpire give their warnings and can be controlled, so people create narratives out of foreknowledge wherein it singles out an enemy for which people can put the blame on, and it makes the events feel more orderly.\n\n"}

{"id": "3644641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3644641", "title": "Video vixen", "text": "Video vixen\n\nA video vixen (also hip hop honey or video girl) is a female model who appears in hip-hop-oriented music videos. The video vixen image has become a staple and a nuanced form of sex work within popular music; especially within the genre of hip-hop. Many video vixens are aspiring actors, singers, dancers, or professional models. Women from various cultures have been portrayed either as fragile, manipulative, fetishistic, or submissive within contemporary music lyrics, videos, concert and movie soundtracks, although this is not universal, as demonstrated by the archetypal ride-or-die chick.\n\nBiblical imagery accompanied by chauvinism morphs black female performers into \"The Black Jezebel\". This caricature portrays black women as promiscuous, unintelligent, and deceptive. This comes from biblical implications that Jezebel's \"beauty\" captivated King Ahab, in such a way, that it drove him from reason and he turned from God, to instead worship idols because he was blinded by his lust for her. Black women under this type of social gaze are not seen as valuable. The only value given to them is derived from their physique highlighted by form fitting clothing that exaggerates the female form. There is continued hypersexualisation of the video vixen.\n\nThe work of video vixens and their portrayal in music videos have drawn criticism. Critics suggest that music-video models are typically placed in subordinate and submissive roles while male artists are shown in positions of power. Others argue that music-video models are depicted as sexual objects, signs of male power, and referred to in derogatory terms such as \"bitch\" and \"slut\".\n\nIn 2004, Nelly's video for his song \"Tip Drill\" came under particular criticism for its depiction and sexual objectification of women. While some people pointed out that the women who appeared in Nelly's video voluntarily chose to participate, others insisted that male rappers continue to sexually objectify hip hop models while denying that the hip hop artists' career is, at least in part, based on the exploitation of other people.\n\nIn 2005, former hip hop music-video model Karrine Steffans authored the book \"Confessions of a Video Vixen\", in which she depicts the degradation of women in the world of hip hop. The book's publisher describes it as \"part tell-all, part cautionary tale\". The book went on to be a best seller in the US. Another hip hop model, Candace Smith, said in an \"XXL\" interview, \"what I've seen on [hip hop music video] sets is complete degradation\".\n\nFemale rappers have most substantially felt this pressure, where sex appeal is now the currency by which women in the music business are valued and devalued. In particular, female rappers such as Lil' Kim and Trina occupy what T. Denean Sharpley-Whiting calls a \"peculiar place of cultural antipathy\", often accused of selling out and blamed for participating in the exploitation of women. Similarly, Nicki Minaj is arguably a 'video vixen' who is the 'object, subject, and author' of sexually explicit music videos.\n\nFemale rappers who have shown themselves off as \"video vixens\" include Nicki Minaj, Trina, Eve, Rasheeda, Foxy Brown, Remy Ma, Da Brat, Jacki-O, Shawnna, Gangsta Boo, LoLa Monroe, Diamond Princess, and Cardi B. The role women have evolved over time in the hip-hop world. Rapper Roxane Shante and Salt-N-Pepa were at the beginning where they were rapping\nabout defending women's image. They were responding to male hip-hop artists for degrading women. Rappers Lil Kim, Foxy Brown, Trina, Nicki Minaj\nand many others are all opposite in accepting hyper-sexuality.\n\nAudre Lorde, who spoke out for black girls who are considered video vixens (although she herself was never a video vixen or closely associated with hip hop), said: \"If I didn't define myself for myself, I would be crunched into other people's fantasies for me and eaten alive.\" The images presented in mass media, specifically in music videos, portray hyper-sensual images of the female sex. These images created within the world of hip hop reinforce the negative stereotypes associated especially with the black female.\n\nIt is pressuring for women musicians to conform to the porn standards because if not they will have to compete with the women who do.\n\nPeople realize that images of women is what rap music videos sell whether the women in the videos are playing the part of cheerleaders or die-hard groupies. Women in the videos are what gets the attention of men and guarantee males audiences. The images are still shots of women taken from videos displaying their appearance. Women are tended to dress half naked and moving their body in sexual ways. Media have given a clear definition that African American women are only seen as sexual figures in the society. Once these images are put out there these women are not the owner of their representation anymore.\n\nGender Performance is an evolving category where hip hop artists express femininity in nonconventional ways that break the stereotype of the passive, hyper-sexualized female body as an object to be consumed. Throughout the genre in graffiti, breakdancing, and rapping, women are addressing the issues associated with the passive stereotype of female representation in hip hop. Feminist activism in hip hop re-examines the relationship women have to the hip hop culture, and how women choose to assert their sexuality.\n\nA form of femininity in hip hop is through asserting sexuality and using it as a dominant source of power, creating the notion of being liberated and a subject as opposed to an object. Artists within this category use blatant sexuality to their advantage as a part of their marketing and work, by using sexuality to their advantage. Due to the commodification of hip hop and stereotyping, the \"sex sells\" concept became prominent within mainstream hip hop culture.\n\nSome video vixens who have made a name for themselves in the music video industry, as well as girls with limited work as hip hop models, have gone on to other types of work with greater success, mostly by marketing themselves.\n\nNicole Alexander became an American reality TV show contestant and is known for winning the VH1 reality television shows of \"Flavor of Love\" in its first season and \"I Love Money\". Another reality show winner was Chandra Davis who won the second season of VH1's Flavor of Love competition.\n\nLeila Arcieri was voted Miss San Francisco in the 1997 Miss California pageant and went on to act in television series, such as \"Son of the Beach\", a parody of \"Baywatch\". Melyssa Ford is an on-air personality for Sirius Satellite Radio's Hot Jamz channel.\n\nVida Guerra has modelled for many magazines, including \"DUB\", \"Smooth\", \"Escape\", and \"Open Your Eyes\", often as the cover girl. She has also made multiple appearances on several Spanish language television programs, such as entertainment gossip show \"El Gordo y la Flaca\", and commercials for Burger King's TenderCrisp Bacon Cheddar Ranch. She's lent her voice to the video game \"\". Lauren London has a successful career in movies and television.
