{"id": "50971965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50971965", "title": "Album-equivalent unit", "text": "Album-equivalent unit\n\nThe album-equivalent unit is a measurement unit in music industry to define the consumption of music that equals the purchase of one album copy. This consumption includes streaming and song downloads in addition to traditional album sales. The album-equivalent unit was introduced in the mid-2010s as an answer to the drop of album sales in the 21st century. Album sales more than halved from 1999 to 2009, declining from a $14.6 to $6.3 billion industry. For instance, the only albums that went platinum in the United States in 2014 were the \"Frozen\" soundtrack and Taylor Swift's \"1989\", whereas several artists did in 2013.\n\nThe usage of the album-equivalent units revolutionized the charts from the \"best-selling albums\" ranking into the \"most popular albums\" ranking. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) have used album-equivalent unit to measure their Global Recording Artist of the Year since 2013.\n\nBeginning with the December 13, 2014 issue, the \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart revised its ranking methodology with album-equivalent unit instead of pure album sales. With this overhaul, the \"Billboard\" 200 includes on-demand streaming and digital track sales (as measured by Nielsen SoundScan) by way of a new algorithm, utilizing data from all of the major on-demand audio subscription services including Spotify, Apple Music, Google Play and Xbox Music. Known as TEA (track equivalent album) and SEA (streaming equivalent album) when originally implemented, 10 song sales or 1,500 song streams from an album were treated as equivalent to one purchase of the album. \"Billboard\" continues to publish a pure album sales chart, called Top Album Sales, that maintains the traditional \"Billboard\" 200 methodology, based exclusively on Nielsen SoundScan's sales data. Taylor Swift's \"1989\" was the first album to top the chart with this methodology, generating 339,000 album-equivalent units (281,000 units came from pure album sales). On the February 8, 2015 issue, \"Now That's What I Call Music! 53\" became the first album in history to miss the top position of the \"Billboard\" 200 despite being the best-selling album of the week. \n\nIn July 2018, Billboard and Nielsen revised the ratios used for streaming equivalent album units to account for the relative value of streams on paid music services like Apple Music or Amazon Music Unlimited versus ad-supported music and video platforms such as Spotify's free tier and YouTube. Under the updated album equivalent ratios, 1,250 premium audio streams, 3,750 ad-supported streams, or 3,750 video streams are equal to one album unit.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Official Charts Company has included streaming into the UK Albums Chart since March 2015. The change was decided after the massive growth of streaming; the number of tracks streamed in the UK in a year doubled from 7.5 billion in 2013 to just under 15 billion in 2014. Under the new methodology, Official Charts Company takes the 12 most-streamed tracks from an album, with the top two songs being given lesser weight so that the figure will reflect the popularity of the album as a whole rather than of one or two successful singles. The adjusted total is divided by 1000 and added to the album sales figure. Sam Smith's \"In the Lonely Hour\" was the first album to top the chart with this rule. Out of its 41,000 album-equivalent units, 2,900 units came from streaming and the rest were pure sales. By the end of 2017, The BPI reported that streaming now accounts for over half of music consumption in the UK (50.4%).\n\nIn Germany, streaming began to be included on the albums chart since February 2016. Nevertheless, German Albums Chart is used to ranking the albums based on weekly revenue, instead of units. Hence, only paid streaming is counted and should be played at least 30 seconds. At least 6 tracks of one album have to be streamed to make streams count for the album, with 12 tracks being the maximum counted. Similar to the UK chart rule, the actual streams of the top-two songs are not counted, but instead the average of the following tracks.\n\nIn Forbes.com, Hugh McIntyre noted that the usage of album equivalent units has made artists release albums with excessive track lists. Brian Josephs from \"Spin\" said: \"If you’re a thirsty pop artist of note, you can theoretically game the system by packing as many as 20 tracks into an album, in the process rolling up more album-equivalent units—and thus album \"sales\"—as listeners check the album out.\" He also criticized Chris Brown's album \"Heartbreak on a Full Moon\" which contains over 40 songs.\n\n"}
{"id": "41525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41525", "title": "Amadeus", "text": "Amadeus\n\nAmadeus is a play by Peter Shaffer, which gives a highly fictionalized account of the lives of the composers Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri. First performed in 1979, \"Amadeus\" was inspired by a short 1830 play by Alexander Pushkin called \"Mozart and Salieri\" (which was also used as the libretto for an opera of the same name by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov in 1897).\n\nIn the play, significant use is made of the music of Mozart, Salieri and other composers of the period. The premieres of Mozart's operas \"The Abduction from the Seraglio\", \"The Marriage of Figaro,\" \"Don Giovanni\", and \"The Magic Flute\" are each the setting for key scenes of the play.\n\nAfter being presented successfully at the Royal National Theatre, London in 1979, the play moved to the West End followed by Broadway. \"Amadeus\" won the 1981 Tony Award for Best Play. It was adapted by Shaffer for the 1984 Academy Award-winning film of the same name.\n\nSince the original run, Shaffer has extensively revised his play, including changes to plot details; the following is common to all revisions.\n\nAt the opening of the tale, Salieri is an old man, having long outlived his fame. Speaking directly to the audience, he claims to have used poison to assassinate Mozart and promises to explain himself. The action then flashes back to the eighteenth century, at a time when Salieri has not met Mozart in person, but has heard of him and his music. He adores Mozart's compositions, and is thrilled at the chance to meet him in person, during a salon at which some of Mozart's compositions will be played. When he finally does catch sight of Mozart, however, he is deeply disappointed to find him lacking the grace and charm of his compositions: When Salieri first meets him, Mozart is crawling around on his hands and knees, engaging in profane talk with his future bride Constanze Weber.\n\nSalieri cannot reconcile Mozart's boorish behaviour with the genius that God has inexplicably bestowed upon him. Indeed, Salieri, who has been a devout Catholic all his life, cannot believe that God would choose Mozart over him for such a gift. Salieri renounces God and vows to do everything in his power to destroy Mozart as a way of getting back at his Creator.\n\nThroughout much of the rest of the play, Salieri masquerades as Mozart's ally to his face while doing his utmost to destroy his reputation and any success his compositions may have. On more than one occasion it is only the direct intervention of the Emperor himself that allows Mozart to continue (interventions which Salieri opposes, and then is all too happy to take credit for when Mozart assumes it was he who intervened). Salieri also humiliates Mozart's wife when she comes to Salieri for aid, and smears his character with the Emperor and the court. A major theme in \"Amadeus\" is Mozart's repeated attempts to win over the aristocratic \"public\" with increasingly brilliant compositions, which are always frustrated either by Salieri or by the aristocracy's own inability to appreciate Mozart's genius.\n\nThe play ends with Salieri attempting suicide with a razor in a last attempt to be remembered, leaving a confession of having murdered Mozart with arsenic. He survives, however, and his confession is met with disbelief, leaving him to wallow once again in mediocrity.\n\nShaffer used artistic licence in his portrayals of both Mozart and Salieri. Documentary evidence suggests that there was some antipathy between the two men, but the idea that Salieri was the instigator of Mozart's demise is not taken seriously by scholars of the men's lives and careers. While historically there may have been actual rivalry and tension between Mozart and Salieri, there is also evidence that they enjoyed a relationship marked by mutual respect. As an example, Salieri later tutored Mozart's son Franz in music. He also conducted some of Mozart's works, both in Mozart's lifetime and afterwards.\n\nWriter David Cairns called \"Amadeus\" \"myth-mongering\" and argued against Shaffer's portrait of Mozart as \"two contradictory beings, sublime artist and fool\", positing instead that Mozart was \"fundamentally well-integrated\". Cairns also rejects the \"romantic legend\" that Mozart always wrote out perfect manuscripts of works already completely composed in his head, citing major and prolonged revisions to several manuscripts (see: Mozart's compositional method).\n\n\"Amadeus\" was first presented at the Royal National Theatre, London in 1979, directed by Sir Peter Hall and starring Paul Scofield as Salieri, Simon Callow as Mozart, and Felicity Kendal as Constanze. (Callow later appeared in the film version in a different role.) It was later transferred in modified form to the West End, starring Frank Finlay as Salieri. The cast also included Andrew Cruickshank (Rosenberg), Basil Henson (von Strack), Philip Locke (Greybig), John Normington (Joseph II) and Nicholas Selby (van Swieten).\n\nThe play premiered on Broadway on 11 December 1980 at the Broadhurst Theatre, with Ian McKellen as Salieri, Tim Curry as Mozart, and Jane Seymour as Constanze. It ran for 1,181 performances, closing on 16 October 1983, and was nominated for seven Tony Awards (Best Actor for both McKellen and Curry, Best Director for Peter Hall, Best Play, Best Costume Design, Lighting, and Set Design for John Bury), of which it won five (including Best Play and Best Actor for McKellen). In 2015, Curry stated in an interview that the original Broadway production was his favorite stage production that he had ever been in. During the run of the play McKellen was replaced by John Wood, Frank Langella, David Dukes, David Birney, John Horton, and Daniel Davis. Curry was replaced by Peter Firth, Peter Crook, Dennis Boutsikaris, John Pankow, Mark Hamill, and John Thomas Waite. Also playing Constanze were Amy Irving, Suzanne Lederer, Michele Farr, Caris Corfman and Maureen Moore.\n\nAdam Redfield (as Mozart) and Terry Finn (as Constanze) appeared in the 1984 Virginia Stage Company production, at the Wells Theatre in Norfolk, Virginia, directed by Charles Towers.\n\nThe play was revived in 1999 at the Music Box Theatre, New York City, directed again by Peter Hall and ran for 173 performances (15 December 1999 until 14 May 2000), receiving Tony Award nominations for Best Revival and Best Actor in a Play (David Suchet, who played Salieri). Also in the cast were Michael Sheen as Mozart, Cindy Katz as Constanze and David McCallum as Joseph II.\n\nIn July 2006, the Los Angeles Philharmonic presented a production of portions from the latest revision of the play at the Hollywood Bowl. Neil Patrick Harris starred as Mozart, Kimberly Williams-Paisley as Constanze Mozart, and Michael York as Salieri. Leonard Slatkin conducted the Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\nRupert Everett played Salieri in a production at the newly refurbished Chichester Festival Theatre from 12 July through 2 August 2014. The cast included Joshua McGuire as Mozart, Jessie Buckley as Constanze and John Standing as Count Orsini-Rosenberg. Simon Jones played Joseph II. Peter Shaffer attended the play at the closing performance.\n\nThe play was revived at the National Theatre in London in a new production directed by Michael Longhurst, from October 2016 to March 2017. It stars Lucian Msamati as Salieri alongside Adam Gillen as Mozart, Karla Crome as Constanze, Hugh Sachs as Count Orsini-Rosenberg and Tom Edden as Joseph II, accompanied with a live orchestra by the Southbank Sinfonia. The production sold out with rave reviews and returned to the Olivier Theatre at the NT with Msamati and Gillen reprising the roles of Salieri and Mozart from February to 24 April 2018, again with rave reviews.\n\n\nThe 1984 film adaptation won an Academy Award for Best Picture. In total, the film won eight Academy Awards. It starred F. Murray Abraham as Salieri (winning the Oscar for Best Actor for his performance), Tom Hulce as Mozart, and Elizabeth Berridge as Constanze. The play was thoroughly reworked by Shaffer and the film's director, Miloš Forman with scenes and characters not found in the play. While the focus of the play is primarily on Salieri, the film goes further into developing the characters of both composers.\n\nIn 1983, BBC Radio 3 aired the play directed by Sir Peter Hall and starring the original cast of his National Theatre production. The cast included:\n\nThis radio production was re-broadcast on 2 January 2011 as part of Radio 3's \"Genius of Mozart\" season.\n\nTo celebrate Mozart's 250th birthday in 2006, BBC Radio 2 broadcast an adaptation by Neville Teller of Shaffer's play in eight fifteen-minute episodes directed by Peter Leslie Wilde and narrated by F. Murray Abraham as Salieri (re-broadcast 24 May – 2 June 2010 on BBC Radio 7).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42484525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42484525", "title": "Armello", "text": "Armello\n\nArmello is a digital role-playing strategy board game developed by Australian independent game studio League of Geeks as their debut project. First announced as an iPad title in September 2012, the game has been in development since mid-2011, with music by composers Lisa Gerrard and Michael Allen. Between April and May 2014, a successful Kickstarter campaign was created to help fund a port to Steam and GOG.com, as well as stretch goals to bring the game to Android and Windows tablets. The game was also chosen to receive additional support from governmental funding agencies Screen Australia and Film Victoria.\n\nSet in a fantasy world filled with anthropomorphic animals, up to four players assume the role of a hero chosen among their clan to take part in a campaign to become the next king or queen. The game features turn-based board-game mechanics that revolve around the use of dice and cards that are drawn from a deck, with each player's actions influencing the outcome.\n\n\"Armello\" is a digital simulation of a traditional fantasy tabletop role-playing game utilizing virtual dice and cards which allow the player to carry out specific actions. Up to four players assume the role of a Hero character that represents a specific animal clan, each with their own unique strengths, with the ultimate goal to storm the castle and become the new king or queen of the kingdom. The playing board area is divided into hexagon-shaped tiles that contain randomly generated features such as dungeons to explore, quests to complete, rival heroes to battle, or settlements to capture. As the game progresses, players can acquire currency to purchase additional abilities for their hero using a talent tree system specific to each character.\n\nThe game uses a turn-based system where players are allowed to perform actions such as equip items and purchase talents during another player's turn to reduce downtime. Cards and dice are used to directly interact with the game world, and form the basis for the game's combat system. Players use cards they draw from a deck to cast spells, recruit followers, heal wounds, or use items that grant special abilities. Cards may also be played as \"Perils\" which can be laid on specific tiles to act as traps for other heroes or used immediately in combat, and other cards may be used to forge temporary alliances. \"Armello\" also features a day/night cycle where certain heroes gain advantages based on the time of day, and certain groups of enemies only appear in either the darkness or light.\n\nThe game takes place in the \"dark fairy tale\" Kingdom of Armello, a world filled with anthropomorphic animals separated into numerous clans. When the current king becomes corrupted by a dark force called the Rot, representatives from these faction rise up to embark on a journey to become the new king or queen in his stead.\nWhile the game features eight heroes available to all players at launch, more will be added to the game over time. The initial characters include Thane, The Winter Wolf, a lupine warrior who carries a large sword; River the Howling Arrow, a wolf Archer; Amber, The Far Seeker, a rabbit armed with a short sword and umbrella; Barnaby Screwloose, a rabbit with custom made armor and a hammer; Mercurio, The Grinning Blade, a sneaky rat with a rapier; Zosha the Whirlwind, a rat assassin with a join-able pair of daggers; Sana, The Forest Sister, a bear who carries a staff of magic power; and Brun Oakbreaker, a Bear Shaman with a totemic club staff.\n\nIn Armello: Usurpers, four more heroes are introduced including Elyssia the Wardress of Warrens (Rabbit), Sargon the Death Teller (Rat), Magna the Unbroken (Wolf), and Ghor the Wyldkin (Bear). In Armello: Rivals, four more heroes join the others including Hargrave Thunder Earl (Rabbit), Griotte Butcher Baroness (Rat), Yordana The Devourer (Bear) and Fang The Exiled (Wolf). Four more characters collectively called The Bandit Clan, which includes Twiss the squirrel thief, Sylas the otter butcher, Scarlet the fox revolutionary, and Horace the badger Knight, are also available as paid DLC as of Spring 2017.\n\n\"Armello\" was announced in September 2012 as the debut title from Australian independent game studio League of Geeks, originally as an iPad-exclusive title to be released the following year before experiencing delays. The 15-person development includes four directors: Ty Carey, Trent Kusters, Blake Mizzi, and Jacek Tuschewski, whose total experience in the game industry includes 40 years and 50 released projects. Kusters stated that he was inspired to create the game after hearing about the success Greg Kasavin had in producing \"Bastion\" with such a small team. League of Geeks began work on the game after eight months of prototypes on paper, with an additional 18 months of work to arrive at the pre-alpha build. An early version of the game was showcased at the Game Developers Conference in April 2013, and later at the inaugural PAX Australia the following July.\n\nIn December 2011 and October 2013, League of Geeks received assistance funding from the state government of Victoria. At the 2012 Sydney Film Festival, it was announced that \"Armello\" was one of 14 projects chosen from a pool of 89 to receive additional support from the Australian federal government funding body Screen Australia.\n\nWhen describing the title's genre and influences, Kusters pitched it as \"imagine \"\" meets \"Final Fantasy Tactics,\"\" and \"\"Game of Thrones\" meets \"Kung Fu Panda\",\" also mentioning that it features components of board games, trading card games, and strategy role-playing games. The game was also said to appeal to fans of \"Redwall\" and \"The Dark Crystal\", as well as the animated works of Studio Ghibli, particularly \"Spirited Away\", which was cited as a large influence on \"Armello\"s art direction and story.\n\nThe team launched a 30-day Kickstarter project page beginning in April 2014 to garner an additional AUD$200,000 to help produce the game full-time, as well as lend support to a release on Windows, OS X, and Linux platforms using the Steam service. A stretch goal was also added, extending possible support to Android and Windows tablets. A tentative release date of March 2015 was also set. On 8 May 2014, the campaign reached $305,360, successfully funding the game, as well as hitting all extended stretch goals, which included releases for the two additional platforms, more languages, in-game cards, and a winter-based map tileset.\n\n\"Armello\" launched on Steam Early Access on 22 January 2015. On 26 May 2015, a PlayStation 4 version was announced. The full version of the game was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux and PlayStation 4 on 1 September 2015. An Xbox One version, and a paid expansion which adds four new heroes, were later announced in April 2016, with the Xbox version and the \"Usurpers\" expansion both released later that year on 30 August 2016.\n\nOne package of downloadable content titled \"Armello: Usurpers\", adding four new heroes to the game, was released in 30 August 2016 about a year after the game's release. The content was limited to the console versions of the title and through Steam for personal computers. Though they had planned on offering the content to all users since the Kickstarter, including those with DRM-free versions of the game as through GOG.com, League of Geeks found that being able to support the content on the DRM-free platform was a task beyond their resources. Co-found Trent Kusters stated \"given infinite resources and time we could undertake the task of rewriting the underlying architecture at the core of this decision, but that's straight up not feasible for a vast number of reasons that are unique to LoG, Armello, where we're standing right now and where we see Armello's future.\" League of Geeks allowed those consumers that had purchased the DRM-free version to request refunds of the game because of this decision.\n\nIn December 2015, League of Geeks partnered with IndieBox, a monthly subscription box service, to produce a custom-designed, physical version of \"Armello\". This limited, individually-numbered edition included a flash-drive with a DRM-free copy of the game, the official soundtrack, an instruction manual, Steam key, and several custom-made collectible items.\n\n\"Armello\" has a Metacritic rating of 75/100. \"GameSpot\" awarded the game 8 out of 10, commenting that while it could use some \"fine tuning\", it remains \"one of the best virtual board game experiences available.\" \"PlayStation LifeStyle\" also awarded the game 8 out of 10, saying \"It's a well-balanced and good-looking experience that shows originality is still possible in a format that's centuries old.\" \"IGN\" was less positive, presenting it with a score of 5.6 out of 10, saying \"Armello makes a great first impression, but it has a bad habit of making you feel like you're playing alone.\"\n\nThe game was nominated for the Excellence in Visual Art for the 2016 Independent Games Festival.\n\n"}

{"id": "326547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=326547", "title": "Competitive dance", "text": "Competitive dance\n\nCompetitive dance is a popular, widespread hobby in which competitors perform dances in any of several permitted dance styles—such as acro, ballet, contemporary, jazz, hip-hop, lyrical, modern, musical theatre, and tap—before a common group of judges. This is in contrast with other activities that involve competition among dancers based on purpose, or specific dance style, such as pom squad and dancesport.\nThe competitive dance industry largely consists of \"competition production companies\"—also sometimes called \"dance competition companies and dance competition lines\"—that conduct regional competitions at stops along their annual, nationwide tours. Dancers who compete at these regional competitions are students ranging in age from approximately four to eighteen years old. Dance schools (often referred to as dance studios) arrange for their classes to compete as groups. Advanced dancers may be chosen to compete solos, duets, trios, or in a small group dance in addition to or in place of large group routines. Competitions typically begin in January and end in July or August.\n\nCompetitive dancers must be physically fit because even short dances can be physically demanding. Dancers must continuously train to maintain and improve their technique, balance skills, strength and flexibility. Except for holidays and short breaks during the summer, competitive dancing is typically a year-round activity: dancers attend classes during competition season, to refine their competitive routines, and during off-season to prepare for the next upcoming competition season. Some dancers attend dance intensives during the summer to improve technique. These intensives normally last a few weeks and happen in various locations across the world.\n\nThe music used in competitive dance routines is typically adapted from commercially available songs created by professional recording artists. Dance routines are subject to time limits at most dance competitions, and consequently the original, commercial music is usually edited to conform to such time limits. \n\nDifferent styles of dance require different forms of music. Lyrical, contemporary, and modern dances often require slower music. Jazz and hip hop dances are set to more upbeat songs. The musical theatre category is composed of routines set to songs from Broadway musicals, films, and TV shows. \n\nThere is no industry-wide standard for scoring. The maximum number of points issued by each judge, as well as the maximum possible final score, varies among competition production companies. Although it is common for judges to issue a maximum of 100 points each, at least one company implements a system in which judges may issue up to 200 points, based on the rationale that such a scoring system is similar to that employed in public schools.\nAlthough scoring at dance competitions vary, the judges score the performances based on similar qualities. The judges usually score based off technique, performance, costume, music, and challenge level of the performance. Each competition's ranks are different. For example some competition's highest medal may be a \"gold\", whereas another is a \"crystal.\" The performances are usually ranked within the category of dance (Jazz, Ballet, Lyrical, Hip-Hip, etc.) The dances are also ranked \"overall\". This means that out of all the dances of that age group are ranked based on their score. Overalls include all different categories of dance.\n\nMost competitions have opportunities for dancers to win title positions. Titles include Mr. and Miss dance. These competitions normally include elite dancers who choose to pay an extra fee to run for title. The title competition includes competing a solo, entering a headshot, and being interviewed by the judges. Winners of the title competition typically receive money and a crown.\n\nDance competitions are organized and conducted by independent competition production companies. In 2007 there were at least 150 such companies operating in the United States and Canada alone. Competition production companies move from one metropolitan area to another, stopping for a few days in each area to conduct a regional competition. By touring in this manner, these companies are able to generate profits while at the same time enabling significant numbers of dancers to attend local competitions. Some companies also conduct one or more national competitions after their regional tours have ended.\n\nThe competitive dance industry has no oversight body or standards organization, although at least one effort was attempted to establish a limited set of competition rules and safety standards in the industry. Competition production companies seldom coordinate their tours with each other. Tour start and end dates, as well as cities visited, vary from one company to another. Most companies conduct regional tours from approximately January through May, while National competitions generally run from June through August. It is not uncommon for two regional tours to be visiting the same metropolitan area at the same time.\n\nAge Divisions: Dancers in competitions are split into different age categories. The categories are: 4 & under, 5-8 years old (mini), 9-11 years old (junior), 12-14 (teen), and 15-18 (senior). Dancers must bring proof of age to every competition in case their age is challenged. Dancers must stay within one age group of their own respective age group when dancing in groups with dancers of other ages. \n\nCompetition Levels: Dances are split into three categories based on difficulty level. These categories are beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Studio directors and choreographers decide which level a dance is placed in. If judges feel that a dancer is in the level, they may either disqualify the dance or bump it into its right category. \n\nGeneral Divisions: Solo (1 performer), Duo/trio (2-3 performers), small group (4-9 performers), large group (10-19 performers), line (19-24 performers), and production (25 or more performers)\n\nThe choreography of a dance routine—which is the design of movement and flow of steps in the routine—is copyrightable. Consequently, video recording is often prohibited at dance competitions in order to steer clear of copyright infringement issues. Some competition production companies employ professional videographers to capture and sell video recordings of competitive performances with the restriction that video recordings may only be sold to the subject performers or members of their studios, thus avoiding infringement. When no professional videographer is available, competition production companies will sometimes permit each attending dance school to designate a videographer to record performances of students from that school.\n\nUnlike videography, still photography does not infringe copyrighted choreography. Because of this, many competition production companies permit photography at their competitions. Virtually all competitions prohibit flash photography, however, both for the safety of performers and to prevent undesirable distractions. Some competition production companies employ professional photographers to capture and sell photographs of dance performances. In such cases, photography by audience members is typically prohibited so as to provide an exclusive market for the official photographers.\n\n"}

He has released graphic novel translations of popular book titles. Blake founded and ran the nonprofit organization known as The From the Barrio Foundation, which \"committed to using author Robert Renteria’s life, business experience, and role as a civic leader to help eliminate conditions that foster violence, delinquency, drugs, and gangs.\" In order to produce his comic books, Blake has established a publishing house, based in Highland Park, Illinois known as Writers of the Round Table Press, which has produced renditions of \"The Long Tail\" and \"The Art of War\", among others, including \"Shut Up, Stop Whining, & Get a Life\", \"Overachievement, How to Master the Art of Selling\" and \"Mi Barrio\". These books are widely used in the educational sector, as well as in youth prisons. The authors of these books \"all agreed to exchange rights for a token $100 each, in return for royalty payments of as much as 20% of Round Table’s take\", according to \"Forbes\". The comic book versions of the titles are available at major bookstores such as Barnes & Noble, Indigo Books and Music; the publications are also released in digital format, for devices such as iPhones, as well as BlackBerry and Android devices. Blake's motivation for format translation stems from his interest in attracting busy professionals and a new generation of readers who prefer to be entertained as they are educated.

The name was coined because the early dance-hall numbers were invariably four-piece bands (violin-piano-accordion-bass).\n\nCuarteto is almost always upbeat; its rhythm range is similar to that of modern Dominican merengue.\n\nIn the 1970s, cuarteto became one of the cornerstones of Córdoba's cultural identity—together with \"Hortensia\" magazine. Both reflected a local brand of popular culture overlooked by the establishment, and proposed an alternative to the Buenos Aires-centered culture that television was spreading to the rest of the country.\n\nCuarteto was one of the genres that gave birth to the Buenos Aires \"tropical\" scene, which was renamed as \"bailanta\" in the 1990s following the usage of Corrientes province.\n\nCuarteto Leo was the leading cuarteto band for almost 30 years, back in the 1970s. It established the sonic texture that prevails in cuarteto to this day.\n\nIn the 1980s, Carlos \"Mona\" Jiménez became the foremost exponent of cuarteto after the break-up of his two-member \"Cuarteto de Oro\" (\"Golden Quartet\"). He established a pattern of nonsense humour and extravagant behavior that many tried to ape without much success. One of his most popular songs was \"Quién se ha tomado todo el vino\" (\"Who drank all the wine?\"), which was danced with a characteristic hand move.\n\nOthers, such as producer-bandleader \"Negro\" Videla, travelled to the Dominican Republic and Colombia to expand the range of their repertoire. Videla is the unofficial ambassador of Dominican music in cuarteto, with successful covers of merengue hits.\n\nSince the late 1980s, the Tru-la-lá band has had great support from dancers. At one point they were endorsed by the Catholic church for avoiding racy themes in their lyrics. All in all, they have sold over a million records.\n\nRodrigo became the leading cuarteto singer in the mid-1990s, and made inroads into Buenos Aires middle-class audiences. He died in a car crash on June 25, 2000. Many people believe the crash was not an accident, as Rodrigo was (allegedly) a pawn in a feud between rival mobsters. His song \"La mano de Dios\" (The Hand of God), which celebrates Diego Maradona through his most famous goal, has become a classic dance song in Argentina, and was covered by Maradona himself in his successful 2005 talk show.\n\nGary (Argentine singer) was another Cuarteto singer with the Tru-la-lá band, who died of natural causes in 2001.\n\n, some of the most popular cuarteto artists are:\n\n\n"}

They combine Afro-Brazilian influences with other strands from the melting pot of their native London. Franck and Forge previously worked together with the Brighton-based group Batu before setting up Da Lata as a more studio based project. Franck is the main creative force as songwriter, producer and multi-instrumentalist, whereas Forge, better known as a DJ and broadcaster, is credited as co-producer. They made three albums for Palm Pictures: \"Songs from the Tin\"(2000) and \"Serious\" (2003) and a collection of their remix work for other artists, \"Remixes\" which featured their interpretations of songs by Femi Kuti, Luciano, Bebel Gilberto and Sly and Robbie, among others. After a hiatus of several years, the pair started work on a new album in 2011. It was scheduled for release in early 2013.\n\nDa Lata's first release was as Trio Da Lata for Brownswood Records in Japan. The song \"Deep Water\" featured former Batu vocalist Sharon Scott. However, it was their next release, a version of Edu Lobo's classic \"Ponteio\" that garnered attention, crossing over between house and jazz-dance audiences. \"Ponteio\" was supported particularly strongly in Japan and in New York by the Body&Soul DJs. Despite the success of this single, Da Lata was put on hold for a few years whilst Chris Franck wrote, produced and toured with Smoke City. In 1998, they recorded a song that had been initially demoed four years earlier; it was on the strength of the song \"Pra Manha\" that they were signed to Chris Blackwell's Palm Pictures.\n\nReleased in 2000, Da Lata's first album enlisted help from London-based Brazilian vocalist Liliana Chachian, who previously featured on \"Ponteio\", and percussionist Oli Savill. Strongly influenced by classic MPB from the late sixties and seventies, \"Songs from the Tin\" also bears the influence of dance music, comparing Da Lata with Nuyorican Soul. Barnes & Noble's online guide said:\n\nParting company from Liliana Chachian and Oli Savill, Da Lata's second album took on other world music influences, particularly Afrobeat, to present a more diverse sound, though the Brazilian influence remained strong. Featuring guest performances from Baaba Maal, Jhelisa, Bembé Segué, and Brazilian accordionist Marcelo Jeneci, \"Serious\" \"proves that Da Lata are one of the few capable of an intriguing, along-lasting dance/world fusion\".\n\nAfter leaving Palm Pictures, Da Lata released tracks in Japan (\"Ronco Da Cuica\") and in the UK (\"This Is Not Your Job\"), both of which were updated for release on their follow-up album \"Fabiola\". A cover version of The Jam's \"Going Underground\", with vocals by Floetic Lara, was released as a single in December 2012. The album \"Fabiola\" was released in October 2013 on Agogo Records.\n\n"}

It was the first extension of the Discovery Channel outside the United States.\n\nPrior to 1993, UK viewers could receive the channel from Intelsat satellites at 27.5° West. In July 1993, the Discovery Channel launched on the Astra 1C analogue satellite on the popular 19.2° East position where it used to broadcast only in the evening, starting at 4pm. On Astra, the daytime space was filled by CMT Europe until 1994, when TLC (later on Discovery Home & Leisure) moved there. Eventually, Discovery Home & Leisure would broadcast from the morning to 4pm when Discovery Channel took over and would broadcast for ten hours until 2am.\n\nWith the launch of Sky Digital in October 1998, Discovery Channel moved its start time to 8am, broadcasting for 18 hours per day.

The recording of \"Double Helix\" also goes by the title \"Twice is Nice\" (as a sound file) when distributed worldwide as production music. The work has been used and heard around the world for music, media, and entertainment broadcasts.\n\n\"Double Helix\" was first written in 1991 as a commission for the SCSBOA Honor Jazz Ensemble and premiered at Disneyland that year. Late in 1991 Jack Bullock (jazz editor for Columbia Pictures Publications/Belwin, (aka CPP Belwin and currently Belwin Jazz, a Division of Alred Music Publishing) hired Jack Cooper as a staff writer for new jazz ensemble works. Jack Bullock heard his writing done for the U.S. Army \"Jazz Knights\". The first piece Bullock decided to publish (and record) was \"Double Helix\".\n\nThe work was recorded at Omega Recording Studios in Rockville, Maryland for the 1993 CPP/Belwin Jazz catalogue of new published works. Later In 1994, Canadian beverage giant Seagram bought a part of Time Warner and the Warner Music Publishing division of that company acquired CPP/Belwin. \"Double Helix\" was now distributed by Warner Brothers Music publications and the company made the move to allow FirstCom and Universal Publishing Production Music to have access to a limited number of CPP/Belwin sound files. The recordings from Omega Studios for CPP/Belwin were of very high quality as well as the music itself that was being written and acquired for the catalogue.\n\nWhile the original CPP/Belwin sound file of \"Double Helix\" continues to be widely used in the media, the rights to the print music were acquired back by the composer in 2006. The print music division of Time Warner was sold to Alfred Music Publishing in June 2005 which made a great deal of the older CPP/Belwin print music catalogue obsolete. At that time it was best to move \"Double Helix\" (the print music) to a company who would keep the work in distribution for a much longer period; the print music is now distributed and sold by Really Good Music Publishing.\n\nThe music and sound file of \"Double Helix\" has been and is still frequently utilized for media production in television and radio. The ASCAP distributions have far exceeded the original royalty payments made through sale of the print music by CPP/Belwin.\n\nThe work itself is 170 measures and based on a Blues form in the key of \"f minor\". The smaller 12 measure sub-form repeats numerous times; the overall work mimicks a hybrid Sonata form with an exposition/statement, development (with improvisation section), and recap (or restatement).\n\n\"Double Helix\" has been used as feature, interlude, and background music in the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Ireland, Canada, Romania, France, Norway, Finland, Hong Kong, and Japan. \n\nTelevision shows using the work include \"The Jenny Jones Show\", \"F.Y.E.\", \"E! Entertainment\" shows (2), \"Access Hollywood\", \"JBVO: Your All Request Cartoon Show\", \"American Restoration\", \"Deal or No Deal (UK)\", and \"Extra\".\n\n"}

It is set in suburban North London, and filmed there, in Mill Hill. The family consists of father Martin (Paul Ritter), mother Jackie (Tamsin Greig), elder son and musician Adam (Simon Bird), and younger son and estate agent Jonny (Tom Rosenthal). The stories follow the family as they have their dinner, which is often interrupted by Adam and Jonny pranking each other and by their strange, lonely, friendless next-door neighbour Jim (Mark Heap), who is sexually attracted to Jackie and terrified of his own dog Wilson.

GMA Network is the flagship property of publicly traded GMA Network Inc. Its first broadcast on television was on October 29, 1961, GMA Network (formerly known as RBS TV Channel 7, GMA Radio-Television Arts then GMA Rainbow Satellite Network) is commonly signified to as the \"Kapuso Network\" in reference to the outline of the company’s logo. It has also been called the “Christian Network” which refers to the apparent programming during the tenure of the new management, which took over in 1974. It is headquartered in the GMA Network Center in Quezon City and its transmitter, Tower of Power is located at Tandang Sora Avenue, Barangay Culiat also in Quezon City.\n\nThe original meaning of the GMA acronym was Greater Manila Area, referring to the initial coverage area of the station. As the network expanded it changed into Global Media Arts. Today, its flagship television station is DZBB-TV (GMA 7 Manila). The network has 3 originating stations and 49 relay stations nationwide. Its programming is also available outside the Philippines through GMA Pinoy TV, GMA Life TV and GMA News TV International.\n\nThe origin of GMA Network can be traced back to Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc. through DZBB, which started airing its radio broadcast on March 1, 1950, and officially launched as a local radio station in Manila on June 14, 1950 and owned by Robert La Rue “Uncle Bob” Stewart, an American war correspondent. Venturing into television in the 1960s, Stewart started its television station through RBS TV Channel 7 in the DZBB-TV station on October 29, 1961, the Philippines' third terrestrial television station. Originally, RBS's programming is composed of foreign programs from the United States and it later produced local programs to cater to Filipino audiences. It produced shows like \"Uncle Bob’s Lucky Seven Club\", a child-oriented show aired every Saturdays; \"Dance Time with Chito\"; and various news programs like \"News at Seven\". And in 1963, RBS launched its first provincial television station in Cebu, DYSS Channel 7 (now GMA Cebu). In the same year, from Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc, the firm was formally renamed to Republic Broadcasting System, Inc. (RBS).\n\nOn September 21, 1972, then President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law by the virtue of Proclamation 1081. Marcos, ruling by decree, curtailed press freedom and other civil liberties; closed down the Congress and media establishments including RBS. Military personnel occupied GMA Network compound and placed it under military control to prevent alleged communist propaganda. Media outlets including RBS that was critical to the Marcos administration were ordered to be closed. But in late-December 1972, RBS was allowed by the government to return on the air this time by its blocktime agreement with the National Media Production Center (NMPC), however with limited three-month permits. But due to limited licenses, difficulty in financial obligations, and disallowing foreign citizens and entities from owning and operating media companies in the Philippines, Stewart and the American Broadcasting Company, who owned a quarter of the company, was forced to cede majority control to a triumvirate composed of Gilberto Duavit Sr., a Malacañang official; Menardo Jimenez, an accountant; and Felipe Gozon, an attorney of the Stewarts in 1974 and the station changed its name to GMA Radio-Television Arts (GMA stood for Greater Manila Area, the station's initial coverage area), though Republic Broadcasting System, Inc. remained as its corporate name until 1996. His wife Loring was the president when the takeover happened. The relaunched GMA, aside from sporting a light blue square logo with the network name in white, also (until 1980) had a circle 7 logo in use, in its final years the blue circle 7 logo used was similar to those used by the ABC in some United States cities.\n\nAfter that, Rod Reyes, the then-general manager of RBS recruited old-timers from ABS-CBN, including from the news department and entertainment programs. Through the acquisition, the station was able to broadcast in color with a PhP8 million credit line thru buying telecine machines and acquired foreign programs. Ratings were up from #5 to #3 that time.\n\nWhen Benigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino, Jr., a senator who strongly opposed the Marcos administration, was assassinated on August 21, 1983, it was only a small item on television news. The iron grip that the Marcos administration had on television began to slip, as GMA broadcast the funeral, the only local station to do so. In 1984, Imee Marcos, daughter of Ferdinand Marcos, attempted to take over GMA. However, the takeover was prevented by GMA executives. Stewart left the Philippines for good as he was utterly disappointed with the Marcos move. GMA was also instrumental during the years preceding the People Power Revolution. The network was the first to air a television interview with Corazon Aquino via \"Viewpoint\" in 1984, and when she later announced that she would run for the presidency if she receives one million signatures. In February 1986, the network was also the first to report that Fidel Ramos and Juan Ponce Enrile broke away from the Marcos administration.\n\nWhen democracy in the Philippines was restored in the People Power Revolution in 1986, television stations began to air, some with their original owners. The political instability of the country also added to the station's burden, when soldiers stormed into the studios for two days in a part of coup attempt to topple then president, Corazon Aquino. In 1987, it became the first VHF television network in the country to provide a new dimension to viewers by broadcasting the network's programs in full stereo (dubbed as \"GMA StereoVision\"), it opened its high-end live studio, the Broadway Centrum, boosting its local programming, and inaugurated its 777-foot \"Tower of Power\" located along Tandang Sora, Quezon City, the tallest man-made structure in the country on November 7, 1988.\n\nOn March 20, 1992, Congress passed Republic Act No. 7252, otherwise known as “An Act Granting the Republic Broadcasting System, Inc. A Franchise to Construct, Install, Operate and Maintain Radio and Television Broadcasting Stations in the Philippines,” granting GMA a legislative franchise for the operation of radio and television broadcasting stations, in particular, “to construct, install, operate and maintain for commercial purposes and in the public interest, radio and television broadcasting stations in the Philippines with the corresponding auxiliary, special broadcast and other program and distribution services and relay stations, and to install radio communications facilities for private use in its broadcast services” for a term of 25 years.\n\nUnder Jimenez, Gozon and Executive Vice President Antonio C. Barreiro, international reach became GMA's target in the 1990s, which began when the \"Rainbow Satellite\" launched on April 26, 1992. Through its relay stations, GMA programs were seen across the archipelago and Southeast Asia. GMA programming started airing in 60 American cities and parts of South America through the \"International Channel Network\". GMA was the official broadcaster of the 1995 World Youth Day, which was the last visit of Pope John Paul II to the country. During the same year, two popular TV shows, \"Eat Bulaga!\" and \"Okey Ka Fairy Ko!\" began broadcasting on GMA after TAPE Inc. refused ABS-CBN's proposal to buy the airing rights of the two shows. At the same time, GMA launched a UHF channel subsidiary, Citynet 27, several new shows (among them was Bubble Gang one of the longest-running shows on TV today), and the news program, \"Saksi\" with Mike Enriquez, Mel Tiangco and Karen Davila. It also has the Asian adaptation of The 700 Club series as The 700 Club Asia which the Philippines is the only originating country in Asia.\n\nIn 1995, GMA founded its film production company, \"Cinemax Studios\" (later renamed to GMA Films in 1998) with the film \"Run Barbi Run\". Its film \"José Rizal\" released in 1998, which was at that time the most expensive movie production ever in the country (costing over 80 million pesos to produce), became a huge success with many accolades and award nominations.\n\nOn May 16, 1996, GMA formally changed its corporate name to \"GMA Network Incorporated\", with GMA now standing for \"Global Media Arts\". GoBingo, initially aired in 1996, is an interactive game show hosted by Arnell Ignacio, with Maricar de Mesa as the first \"GobiGirl\". In 1998, GMA pioneered on Filipino language late night news broadcast with the news program GMA Network News as the first Filipino-language late-night television newscast after it was debuted six years ago as an English language late-night newscast, as English newscasts were started since the introduction of television in the country in 1953. As the newscast fasten to higher than its English newscasts, all networks start to follow including ABS-CBN in 1999, IBC 13 in 1998, RPN 9 in 2000, NBN 4 in 2001 and ABC 5 in 2004.\n\nGMA was the first Philippine broadcaster to receive a Peabody Award for Investigative Reporting in 1999. Later, Citynet 27 became EMC, the first locally programmed music video channel, later becoming a part of the Channel [V] franchise called Channel [V] Philippines. Channel [V] the Philippines, however, ceased operations due to a conflict of interest between the owners of GMA and PLDT (which bought a stake in GMA), who operate MTV Philippines through their subsidiary, the Nation Broadcasting Corporation. GMA was also the Philippine broadcaster for \"2000 Today\", the most-successful international television special that commemorated the dawn of the new Millennium. At the turn of the millennium, GMA was the only local network to go on 24-hour, non-stop broadcasting (However, in 2001, the network reduced back to regular broadcast hours for its regular transmitter maintenance due to NTC's rules and regulations for affiliated free-to-air TV stations). At the beginning of the year, Menardo Jimenez announced his retirement as president and CEO (he would later be assumed office as a member of the board of directors of San Miguel Corporation in 2002) and on December 31, 2000, Felipe Gozon assumed the position with his concurrent capacity as chairman. Duavit's son Gilberto Duavit Jr. assumed the post of the chief operating officer.\n\nOn October 27, 2002, during an episode of the network's noontime show \"SOP\", GMA officially revealed a new logo and image campaign. The new logo features a rainbow-colored heart-shaped logo, the Kapuso, represented by a new slogan \"Kapuso ng Pamilyang Pilipino, Anumang Kulay ng Buhay\" (\"One in Heart With the Filipino family, In Whatever Colors of Life\"), and a Century Gothic Bold font for the letters. The \"Kapuso\" theme song is sung by Regine Velasquez.\n\nIn 2003, \"Saksi\" won the New York Television Festival Gold Medal for best newscast, the first Philippine newscast to do so. This and the Peabody Award in 1999 earned the network a House of Representatives commendation later that year. On September 1 of the same year, GMA Network withdrew its membership from the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP), after incidents involving host Rosanna Roces, alleged commercial overloading and interfering when news anchor Mike Enriquez aired his complaints about his radio program, \"Saksi sa Dobol B\", against Lopez-owned cable firm SkyCable's distortion of GMA's signal on its system, and a lost videotape containing evidence that the cable firm had violated the rule on soliciting ads for cable TV. GMA was an official TV network of the 4th World Meeting of Families held in Manila, Philippines.\n\nIn 2004, GMA launched line up of new programs and primetime shows such as \"Te Amo, Maging Sino Ka Man\", \"Hanggang Kailan\", \"Forever In My Heart\", \"Marinara\", as well as, \"Bahay Mo Ba 'To\", \"Naks!\", \"Lovely Day\", \"StarStruck Kids\", \"Ikaw Sa Puso Ko\", \"Leya, Ang Pinakamagandang Babae Sa Ilalim Ng Lupa\", \"30 Days\", \"Wag Kukurap\", \"Pinoy Pop Superstar\", \"SOP Gigsters\", \"Joyride\", \"3R\", \"Out\", \"Bitoy's Funniest Videos\" and the network's new early evening newscast 24 Oras.\n\nIn 2005, the company’s subsidiary, Citynet Network Marketing and Productions, Inc., signed a co-production and block time agreement with ZOE Broadcasting Network, allowing the GMA Network with another platform to showcase its programming and talents. On November 11, 2005, ZOE's flagship station, DZOE-TV Channel 11, went on the air as \"Quality TeleVision\" (later known as Q and was reformatted to become GMA News TV), and broadcast shows that primarily targeted women audiences. Q's news programs shared the same resources of GMA News and Public Affairs, while some programs are produced by Citynet Network Marketing and Productions, Inc. Also in 2005, GMA won the Asian Television Awards' Best Terrestrial Television Station, besting MBC of Korea and MediaCorp Channel 5 of Singapore. The network planned to go public, but due to political instability and the downward trend of broadcast advertising, it was delayed.\n\nIn 2006, \"Debate with Mare at Pare\", a late-night public affairs program, won the bronze medal in the New York Television Festival. The network was also praised on its coverage of the \"Wowowee\" (a program of ABS-CBN) stampede by local publications. In an exclusive interview, a reprehensive Mike Enriquez interviewed embattled Philippine president, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, for the first time since the lifting of the State of National Emergency, which the network allowed other stations to air without prior consent. At the end of the interview, the president praised the network for its news coverage, hinting that other media outfits to do the same. In April, the founder of the network, Robert \"Uncle Bob\" Stewart died in the United States. During the Everest climbing season the same year, GMA supported climber Romi Garduce, the third Filipino to reach the summit of Mt. Everest in only three days. The network is one of the first local companies to produce an IMAX film, with the opening of the San Miguel-Coca-Cola IMAX Theater in SM's Mall of Asia.\n\nIn 2007, the network announced that it will offer its stocks to the public. After being cancelled numerous times and despite the Marcoses claim to the shares held by the Duavit family, their IPO was finally held on July 30 offering PhP 8.50 per share. The Network started to produce television franchises from other countries when they produced \"\" with FremantleMedia, one of the largest producers of television franchises in the world based in United Kingdom.

The announcement came about after Galvante officially retired from the network, ending her 19 years of service as entertainment head. GMA Network appointed Lilybeth Rasonable as Officer-in-charge of the Entertainment Group. Rasonable has been with the network since 1998 and has served as program manager, assistant vice president, and vice president for drama for the Entertainment Group. Her latest position prior to the appointment has seen her supervising the group's afternoon and primetime teledramas.\n\nIn April 2012, GMA Network's president and COO Gilberto Duavit, Jr. announced that the network hit consolidated revenues at 13.083 billion pesos in 2011. That's despite the absence of 2.054 billion pesos worth of revenues from political ads generated in 2010 and the global impact of financial crisis in Europe and slow economic recovery in the U.S. in 2011.\n\nThe network won another Peabody Award in 2013 for its coverage of Supertyphoon Yolanda (Haiyan).\n\nOn October 4, 2012, the network announced the termination of negotiations with MediaQuest Holdings, Inc. (an affiliate of Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company) owned by businessman and TV5 chairman Manny V. Pangilinan. Since the beginning of the year, Mr. Pangilinan had been vocal with his interest to acquire GMA Network, saying that he \"talked to them, ...since 2002, and then maybe five years ago.\" Following the return of the negotiations of GMA Network to the PLDT Group, Manny V. Pangilinan confirming last March 4, 2014, that the offer to buy 34% stake at GMA Network was expired in February of the same year.\n\nOn May 5, 2014, GMA Network chairman and CEO, attorney Felipe L. Gozon confirmed the networked has entered negotiations with San Miguel Corporation president and COO Ramon S. Ang. A month after, on June 24, 2014, GMA Network's major stockholders announced it will sell 30% of their equity shares of the network to Ang in his personal capacity. San Miguel Corporation is not involved in Ang's acquisition of the shares. In June 2015, GMA in a disclosure to the securities commission said that talks with Ramon Ang has bogged down.\n\nIn April 2015, GMA Network implemented a series of budget cuts towards its regional TV stations, by terminating at least 200 regional employees, downgrading its originating TV stations in Bacolod, Naga, Cagayan de Oro, General Santos and Ilocos to 'satellite-selling' or relay TV stations, and cancelling morning shows in Cebu, Davao, Iloilo and Dagupan, reportedly in order for them to \"streamline their operations for increased ratings and revenue.\" In November that same year, the network also downgraded its originating station in Iloilo City into 'relay-selling' or satellite TV station and cancelling \"Ratsada 24 Oras\" following the retrenchment of 20 employees from the news department as part of the strategic streamlining undertaken by GMA Network.\nOn March 9, 2018, GMA Network launched its new slogan \"Buong Puso Para Sa Kapuso\" (lit. Wholehearted for the One in Heart) with a new station ID. However, the network's current station ID in short version during the top/bottom of the hour before start the programs as well as during commercial breaks/reminders it also aired on its sister channel, GMA News TV.\n\nIn February 2013, GMA Network admitted that it was conducting field tests of Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting-Terrestrial (ISDB-T), the Japanese standard in digital television, but remained unconvinced saying European standard, second-generation Digital Video Broadcasting-Terrestrial (DVB-T2), is superior to ISDB-T. However, in October 2013, National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) issued a draft memorandum circular adopting the Japanese standard as the sole standard in the delivery of digital terrestrial TV (DTT) services in the Philippines. In May 2015, GMA Network announced that it will be spending at least Php 2 to 3 billion for the rollout of its digital TV service and said the company plans to produce dongles, instead of set-top boxes for the rollout. In May 2015, GMA topped the digital TV test commissioned by mobile phone brand Starmobile and conducted by American market research firm International Data Corporation (IDC) with GMA's presence in 10 out of 14 locations in Metro Manila.\nBeginning September 2013, some of the programs of the network have been produced in high definition format in preparation for the ongoing digital shift in the country while keeping digital on-screen graphics in safe zone for their TV broadcast since the network is still broadcasting in 480i. The videos uploaded on their YouTube channel and third-party OTT services on the other hand are presented in 1080p format.\n\nIn December 2016, it was announced that the network will spend an initial amount of 416 million pesos for the commencement of the Digital Terrestrial Television transition project of GMA, which included the purchase of three high-powered transmitters capable for providing wider and clearer signal to digital television boxes, antennas and other connectivity requirements, and a fully mirrored head-end system, which is a master facility for grouping and digitally encoding programs. According to GMA Network Chairman and CEO, Felipe Gozon, the network will conclude the test phase, and it is expected to begin the rollout of the DTTV project starting in Metro Manila.\n\nIn preparation for the shift to digital, GMA New Media is currently working on a DTV Set-top box (originally reported to be a DTV dongle) in order to compete with ABS-CBN's own TV Plus box. A prototype was shown at the IMMAP DigiCon congress in 2016, and is shown to be running a version of Android, double-acting as a streaming device capable of running apps and games. No news yet to when a production version will be available. \n\nGMA Network is jointly owned by its three major shareholders; the Gozon, Duavit and Jimenez families. Its corporate shareholding is owned by GMA Holdings Inc. (25.17%), Group Management & Development Inc. (23.47%), FLG Management & Development Corp. (20.01%) percent, M.A. Jimenez Enterprises (13.49%) percent, and Television International Corp. (9.94%).\n\nShareholder GMA Holdings, Inc. is jointly owned by Felipe L. Gozon, Gilberto Duavit, Jr., and Joel Marcelo Jimenez.\n\nOn October 29, 1961, Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc. launches its first television station in the Philippines, known back then as RBS TV Channel 7. GMA Network began branding its identity by eliminating call signs to its network identification. \n\nGMA Network has used a number of logos throughout its history especially when Gozon, Jimenez, and Duavit acquired the station in 1975. From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, the network used the Circle 7 logo, which is also expended by several networks around the world. In the 1980s, to refine its presence in the Philippine broadcast industry, GMA Network used the slogan \"Where You Belong\", and lasted for two decades before invigorating to another catchphrase. In 1992, GMA Network redefines itself as the Rainbow Network, succeeding the ensigns of the rainbow. Throughout the 1990s, the network developed the logo before having it replaced by its current logo in 2002 and as the Kapuso Network. After a huge marketing campaign, and improved television ratings, the new insignia (the rainbow-colored stylized heart-shape logo known as Kapuso) is now one of the most recognizable in the Philippines.\n\nKapuso ng Bawat Pilipino (One in Heart with Every Filipino) is the secondary characteristic catchphrase of GMA Network. The slogan was initially used in conjunction with the rebranding of GMA Network as the “Kapuso Network” on October 27, 2002. But another slogan of the network Kapuso, Anumang Kulay ng Buhay (One in Heart, in Every Colors of Life) is still used in other purposes and this is the official theme song title for the network. GMA Network’s news and public affairs department meanwhile uses the slogan \"Serbisyong Totoo\" (\"True Service\"). It is one of the longest running slogans used for news broadcast promotion. GMA Network found itself on the other end of a battle concerning the slogan, when ABS-CBN News Channel uses similar catchphrase, and immediately discontinued in order to avoid legal predicament from GMA Network. In 2006, its news department also used an accompanying slogan, \"Just News,\" for its promotional campaign together with its news media partners, INQ7.Net.\n\nGMA Network television programming comprises news, public affairs, sports, fictional, variety shows, dramas, musicals, soap operas, children’s and talk shows, reality programs, cartoons and anime and movie blocks. Most of its programs are broadcast live and taped in its GMA Network Centers and Studios located in Metropolitan Manila. GMA Network currently programs 20.5 hours of programming per day. It provides 34.5 hours of prime time programming per week to its owned and affiliated stations: on Weekdays, 4:25-10:00 p.m. on Mondays to Thursdays, 10:00-12:35 a.m. on Fridays, 10:00-12:30 a.m. on Saturdays, 4:30-12:55 a.m. on Sundays. Programming is also provided from 4:00-1:25 a.m. on Weekdays in the form of \"Unang Hirit\"; the two-and-half-hour and three-hour Monday to Saturday noontime variety show \"Eat Bulaga!\", early afternoon drama (Afternoon Prime block), early and late-evening news program, \"24 Oras\" and \"Saksi\", respectively; primetime programming through its \"Telebabad\" block; late-night current affairs show produced by its news and public affairs department.\n\nProgramming competition started in 2004 when production of numerous GMA Network shows was up against its rival network, ABS-CBN. Reality show, \"Extra Challenge\" started to lead the ratings and with launch of \"telefantasya\" \"Mulawin\". On September 23, 2004, GMA Network gained leadership in Mega Manila against its closest competitor. In 2005, GMA Network began producing \"Mars Ravelo's Darna\", a classic Filipino comic book character which became a hit, with an overnight rating of 47.7 percent, the highest rating for a pilot episode and the first \"telefantasya\" to reach 52.1 percent ratings; followed by \"Encantadia\" at 47.2 percent and other prime-time \"telefantasyas\", \"Mulawin\" (2004) and \"Sugo\" (2005) contributed to GMA Network lead in Mega Manila. In 2006, GMA Network maintained its prime time supremacy by reformatting its reality-based program \"Extra Challenge\" and another \"telefantasya\" \"Encantadia\" (which was succeeded by \"Etheria\" and \"\"), and the localized subtitled versions of Korean television series \"Stairway to Heaven\", \"Full House\", \"Jewel in the Palace\" and \"My Lovely Sam Soon\".\n\nIn 2007, GMA Network started producing the local version of a Mexican television series \"MariMar\". For its pilot episode, it got 52.6 percent overnight rating, making it the only soap opera to achieve the highest ratings in GMA Network’s history. In a 2006 survey conducted by Pulse Asia, seven out of 10 Metro Manila-based viewers find GMA Network a more credible network than its competitor. GMA Network managed to lead in Mega Manila and Southern Luzon demographic, which has the highest concentration of television ownership and 79 percent of advertisement placement.\n\nThe National Urban Television Audience Measurement was officially launched on October 16, 2006, to determine the television ratings and the audience share of local TV programs from urban areas in the Philippines. This changes the broadcast industry landscape and the manner in which the advertisers allocate their TV investments to achieve cost efficiency and maximization. In August 2007 audience rating data shows GMA Network maintained its lead in Mega Manila, which resulted to a 23 percent growth in its consolidated net income to PhP1.13 billion in the first half of the year from PhP915 million in the same period last year. GMA Network income grew by 23 percent year-on-year to PhP1.126 billion in the first six months of the year. Mega Manila accounts 49 percent of total TV households. The Mega Manila and Luzon markets combined accounts for 76 percent of the total TV households. It earned PhP2.3 billion in 2007. In 2011, GMA Network maintained the lead in the national television ratings mentioning figures from Nielsen TV Audience Measurement for January 1 to February 13, 2011. It had 33.2 percent audience shared based on overnight data, higher than ABS-CBN's 31.8 percent and TV5’s 14.9 percent. It also leads in Urban Luzon, which makes up 77 percent of total television households in the Philippines. GMA Network posted 9.8 point lead with 36.5 points compared with the closest competitor, ABS-CBN's 26.7 points and imposing a 19.6 point lead from TV5's 16.9. GMA Network also sustained to beat ABS-CBN in Mega Manila, which accounts for 58 percent of television household. It got 37.7 percent share over ABS-CBN 25.2 percent and TV5's 17.7 percent, 20 points higher.\n\nOn July 22, 2004, during the arrival of Angelo de la Cruz at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (a truck driver who was held hostage and threatened with beheading in Iraq abducted by armed rebels west of Baghdad while trucking fuel from Saudi Arabia), live news coverage was aired on GMA Network and other local television stations in the Philippines. GMA Network used audio-video coverage through the facilities of Reuters, which GMA Network subscribed to. During the said broadcast, a live feed from Reuters was simultaneously aired with its own live broadcast. During the first five-second of the live feed, GMA Network did notice that the live feed from Reuters was also airing at another local station, its main competitor ABS-CBN. The live video was restricted only to ABS-CBN and Reuters did not inform GMA Network that the video coverage was only intended for ABS-CBN. The local Court of Appeals junked the case filed by ABS-CBN Corporation against GMA Network Inc. for what was claimed to be illegal copying of its live video footage. In a ruling, the local fourth division of the appellate court set aside the resolution of the local Justice Department, which approved the filing of the violation of Republic Act 8293 (or the Intellectual Property Code) against GMA Network. It ruled out that the act of GMA Network in airing the live video coverage was focused by good faith since there was no meaning to instigate damage to ABS-CBN Corporation. The local court also said GMA Network acted in good faith when it decided to instantaneously stop using the live video feed from Reuters upon learning ABS-CBN was also covering the said news event and its following exertion to authenticate the ABS-CBN Corporation restriction arrangement with the news service, Reuters. The local court also stressed that apart from lack of intent of GMA Network to affect the video from ABS-CBN, the action also cannot be reflected intrusion of Sections 212.4 and 185.1 of Republic Act 8293 since it was just a short excerpt compared with the totality of the matter.\n\nOn December 20, 2007, Judge Charito Gonzales of Quezon City Regional Trial Court Branch 80 released a temporary restraining order on TV ratings surveys based on a civil case filed by then ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation (now ABS-CBN Corporation) versus AGB Nielsen Media Research Philippines. ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation accused competitor GMA Network Inc. of funding bribing operations in Bacolod City, to discredit the former. The local court in the Philippines further ordered ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation to file comment on the plea of AGB Nielsen Media Research Philippines for the alleged gathering and dissemination of television ratings data, within five days or until December 22, 2007. On December 21, 2007, a local AM radio station in the Philippines, owned by ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation, DZMM field reporter Junrie Hidalgo reported a news story entitled \"AGB Nielsen, umamin sa dayaan: GMA Network, tahasang itinurong nasa likod ng dayaan\" (\"AGB Nielsen admits to cheating: GMA Network aggressively accused of being behind the cheating\") during the radio program of \"Showbiz Mismo\", hosted by Cristy Fermin and Jobert Sucaldito. The news story is based on an interview of AGB Nielsen general manager Maya Reforma regarding the purported cheating. In response, GMA Network Inc. aired a television plug reproving the purported unfair journalism and disagreed the accusations of ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation. GMA Network Inc. later filed a PhP15-million civil libel suit against ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation on January 3, 2008. The respondents included Hidalgo, Fermin, Sucaldito, the station and news manager of DZMM, writers and executive producers of television programs Bandila, Entertainment Live and The Buzz after the same story was aired locally. On January 7, 2008, the Quezon City Regional Trial Court junked ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation's suit against AGB Nielsen, saying the case was “prematurely filed\" before the local court. Judge Gonzales' basis is the principle of mutuality of contracts, citing Article 1308 and 1196, New Civil Code of the Philippines. Also, Judge Samuel Gaerlan, Quezon City Regional Trial Court Branch 92 issued court summons against ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation and 15 of its personnel on January 3, 2008. On January 17, 2008, Judge Gaerlan recused himself from the case, considering that he has a cousin working in the legal department of ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation. The case was later re-raffled on January 28, 2008, and the case was eventually assigned to Judge Henri Inting of Branch 95 of the Quezon City Regional Trial Court. On February 14, 2008, Judge Inting issued a temporary restraining order barring local television station, ABS-CBN from airing defamatory statements against GMA Network Inc.\n\nIn December 2008, GMA Network Inc., Citynet Television, and ZOE Broadcasting Network filed a lawsuit against the management of TV5, alleging MPB Primedia Inc. (a subsidiary of Media Prima Berhad, a Malaysian company, which entered a block time agreement with Associated Broadcasting Company to sell the airtime of TV5) of violating Article XVI, Section 3, of the 1987 Philippine Constitution. GMA Network Inc. argues restriction of foreign entities to operate and own a Filipino company especially on broadcast media. GMA Network Inc. disputes MPB Primedia Inc. that it was established to skirt the anti-dummy laws and enter into an unlawful block time deal.\n\n"}

He was lead editor in the now-legendary magazine \"The Education of Children\" (Η Διάπλασις των Παίδων) during the period from 1896 to 1948, during which time he was also the magazine's main author. His was the trademark signature \"Σας ασπάζομαι, Φαίδων\" (\"yours faithfully, Phaedon)\", which he used in letters ostensibly addressed to the magazine. He was also the founder and editor of the \"Nea Estia\" magazine, which is still published. He became a member of the Academy of Athens in 1931, and founded the Society of Greek Writers (Εταιρεία Ελλήνων Λογοτεχνών) together with Kostis Palamas, Angelos Sikelianos and Nikos Kazantzakis.\n\nHe was born on 9 December 1867 in Constantinople. His father, Dionysios, hailed from Zakynthos and his mother, Evlalia came from Constantinople. The family moved to Zakynthos soon after, where Gregorios spent his youth until 1883, when he enrolled in the University of Athens to study Physics and Mathematics. He never completed his studies: already in the first year, he had begun writing literature, which was his sole source of income at the time.\n\nIn 1892 he moved permanently to Athens and in 1894 he married Efrosini Diogenidis. They divorced one and a half year later, having already had a daughter. In 1901 he married his second spouse Christine Kanellopoulos, with whom they had two daughters.\n\nHe cooperated with several newspapers and magazines, in which he published a lot of studies, articles, short stories and novels. In 1894 he became director in the \"Illustrated Estia\" newspaper and in 1896 the chief editor of \"The Education of the Children\". From 1901 to 1912 he published literary works and studies in the \"Panathinaia\", and from 1912 he cooperated with \"Ethnos\" newspaper, writing serialized novels. In 1927 he founded the magazine \"Nea Estia\", whose director he was until 1934.\n\nHis house with his library was destroyed during the Dekemvriana clashes in Athens in 1944. He died in Athens on 14 January 1951 and was buried at public expense.\n\nXenopoulos was a very notable writer. He wrote over 80 novels and stories. He first became known with his novel: \"Ο Άνθρωπος του Κόσμου\" (\"O anthropos tou kosmou\", \"Man of the world\"). This New Athenian School novel and his next one, \"Nikolas Sigalos\" (1890), were not successful. He then was inspired by his birthplace Zakynthos, and as a result he wrote some of his best novels: \"Magaret Stefa\" (1893), Κόκκινος Βράχος (\"Kokkinos Vrachos\", \"Red Rock\", 1905). These were followed by further novels in the New Athenian style: \"Ο πόλεμος\" (\"O polemos\", \"War\", 1914) and \"Οι Μυστικοί Αρραβώνες\" (\"I mystikoi aravones\", \"The secret engagement\", 1915) and the Ionian School novel \"Laura\" (1915), which was also one of his best. But his most ambitious work was the trilogy: \"Πλούσιοι και φτωχοί\" (\"plousioi kai ftochoi\", \"Rich and poor\", 1919), \"Τίμιοι και άτιμοι\" (\"Timioi kai atimoi\", \"Honest and dishonest ones\", 1921), \"Τυχεροί και άτυχοι\" (\"Tycheroi kai atychoi\", \"Lucky and unlucky ones\", 1924). Other novels are: \"Αναδυομένη\" (\"Anadyomeni\", 1923), \"Ισαβέλλα\" (\"Isabella\", 1923), \"Τερέζα Βάρμα-Δακόστα\" (\"Teresa Varma-Dakosta\", 1925).\n\nHe is the rapporteur of urban prose.\n\nHis first theatrical play was: \"Ο ψυχοπατέρας\" (\"O Psychopateras\", \"The stepfather\"), and was presented in 1895. He cooperated with the \"Nea Skini\" theatrical troupe of Konstantinos Christomanos. His most famous theatrical plays are: \"Το μυστικό της Κοντέσσας Βαλέραινας\" (\"To mystiko tis kontessas Valerainas\", \"The secret of countess Valerena\", 1904), \"Στέλλα Βιολάντη\" (\"Stella Violanti, 1909, with Marika Kotopouli), \"Φοιτηταί\", (\"Foititai\", \"Students\").\n\nHe wrote 46 different theatrical plays. In 1901 he was in the front line with Kostis Palamas, in order to establish the theatre \"Nea Skini\" and because he was fluent in a lot of languages, he was aware of the several important spiritual events that took place in big European countries at that time. In addition, he wrote introductions for Henrik Ibsen and he was \"living\" the theatrical acts.\n\nHe made a lot of translations and his writing was of high standards. The first play that was performed in the Royal Theatre of Athens (renamed after renovation in 1932 as the National Theatre of Greece) was his: \"Ο θείος Όνειρος\" (\"O theios Oneiros\", \"Uncle Dream\").\n\nHe wrote dramas and comedies with the common subject: love. His work is a window to contemporary Greek society. His works are categorized by the place that they were written, some in Zakynthos and the rest in Athens. His work tried to balance between the Ionian School and the New Athenian School.\n\nXenopoulos is notable for his literary criticism. In magazine \"Panathinaia\" (\"Παναθήναια\"), he published a lot of reviews on famous Greek writers, like Alexandros Papadiamantis, Demetrius Vikelas etc. In 1903 he was the first to introduce Constantine P. Cavafy to the Athenian readership.\n\n\n\n \n"}

She was created by Stuart Palmer.\n\nMiss Withers \"whom the census enumerator had recently listed as 'spinster, born Boston, age thirty-nine, occupation school teacher'\" becomes an amateur sleuth \nin the first book of the series. Her adventures are usually comic but are nevertheless straightforward mysteries. She is a partial variation on Agatha Christie's Miss Marple. \"A lean, angular spinster lady, her unusual hats and the black cotton umbrella she carries are her trademark. ... Hildegarde collects tropical fish, abhors alcohol and tobacco, and appears to have an irritable disposition. However, she is a romantic at heart and will extend herself to help young lovers.\" She collaborates, and frequently butts heads, with Inspector Oscar Piper, a high-ranking homicide detective in the New York Police Department.\n\nEdna May Oliver starred in the first three screen adaptations, produced by RKO Radio Pictures, and is considered by fans of the film series the definitive Miss Withers. When Oliver left RKO in 1935 to sign with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, RKO attempted to continue the series with Helen Broderick and then ZaSu Pitts, but Oliver's presence was sorely missed and the films were poorly received. Author Palmer approved of Oliver's characterization so much that he gave the actress a mention in his Hollywood-based Withers novel \"The Puzzle of the Happy Hooligan\".\n\nIn 1972, CBS made a Withers television movie with Eve Arden as Withers and James Gregory as Piper. The movie was well-received, but failed to produce any sequels.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "206964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=206964", "title": "Homing pigeon", "text": "Homing pigeon\n\nThe homing pigeon is a variety of domestic pigeon (\"Columba livia domestica\") derived from the rock pigeon, selectively bred for its ability to find its way home over extremely long distances. The wild rock pigeon has an innate homing ability, meaning that it will generally return to its nest, (it is believed) using magnetoreception. This made it relatively easy to breed from the birds that repeatedly found their way home over long distances. Flights as long as have been recorded by birds in competitive pigeon racing. Their average flying speed over moderate distances is around but speeds of up to have been observed in top racers for short distances.\n\nBecause of this skill, homing pigeons were used to carry messages as messenger pigeons. They are usually referred to as \"pigeon post\" if used in post service, or \"war pigeon\" during wars.\n\nHoming pigeons are often incorrectly categorized as carrier pigeons, a breed of fancy pigeons selectively-bred for its distinctively rounded hard wattle.The purpose of using them was to send messages or mails\n\nMale and female pigeons (cocks and hens, respectively) can be differentiated by physical characteristics of the head, beak, height, and breast, though visual identification of sex by physical characteristics alone can be inaccurate. Males usually stand taller, and have larger beaks, crops, wattles, and eye ceres (fleshy growth around the eyes), as well as round heads and thicker napes. Females, on the other hand, tend to be shorter with smaller beaks, wattles, and ceres, as well as flatter heads and fuller breasts.\n\nMale and female pigeons show different behaviours. The \"coo\" of males is louder and more insistent, especially when courting. Display behaviour also differs between the sexes. Most notably, a male often turns 360 degrees with an inflated crop and a loud \"coo\", to show interest in a female or to defend or discourage another pigeon from entering its territory (usually a nesting box), while females almost never turn full circle, but rather do a 270-degree back-and-forth rotational motion.\n\nDuring breeding season, usually during the warmer months, a male pigeon will court the female by puffing out his chest, bobbing his head and strutting in circles around her, all the while cooing his affections. If she accepts, she will allow him onto her back in order to copulate. After mating, the male will build a nest out of gathered sticks in a suitable crevice, while the female watches and makes changes. Urban birds will gladly use a roof on a building. The female will usually lay two eggs. The first egg would be laid late in the evening, and the other egg forty hours after, which will hatch in 17 to 20 days, depending on the weather. Both parents aid in rearing the nestlings. Fledglings usually leave the nest around four to five weeks after hatching.\n\nThe sport of flying homing pigeons was well-established as early as 3000 years ago. They were used to proclaim the winner of the Ancient Olympics.\nMessenger pigeons were used as early as 1150 in Baghdad and also later by Genghis Khan. By 1167 a regular service between Baghdad and Syria had been established by Sultan Nur ad-Din. In Damietta, by the mouth of the Nile, the Spanish traveller Pedro Tafur saw carrier pigeons for the first time, in 1436, though he imagined that the birds made round trips, out and back. The Republic of Genoa equipped their system of watch towers in the Mediterranean Sea with pigeon posts. Tipu Sultan of Mysore (1750–1799) also used homing pigeons; they returned to the Jamia Masjid mosque in Srirangapatna, which was his headquarters. The pigeon holes may be seen in the mosque's minarets to this day.\n\nIn 1818, a great pigeon race called the \"Cannonball Run\" took place at Brussels. In 1860, Paul Reuter, who later founded Reuters press agency, used a fleet of over 45 pigeons to deliver news and stock prices between Brussels and Aachen, the terminus of early telegraph lines. The outcome of the Battle of Waterloo was also first delivered by a pigeon to England. During the Franco-Prussian War pigeons were used to carry mail between besieged Paris and the French unoccupied territory. In December 1870, it took ten hours for a pigeon carrying microfilms to fly from Perpignan to Bruxelles.\n\nHistorically, pigeons carried messages only one way, to their home. They had to be transported manually before another flight. However, by placing their food at one location and their home at another location, pigeons have been trained to fly back and forth up to twice a day reliably, covering round-trip flights up to 160 km (100 mi). Their reliability has lent itself to occasional use on mail routes, such as the Great Barrier Pigeongram Service established between the Auckland, New Zealand, suburb of Newton and Great Barrier Island in November 1897, possibly the first regular air mail service in the world. The world's first 'airmail' stamps were issued for the Great Barrier Pigeon-Gram Service from 1898 to 1908.\n\nHoming pigeons were still employed in the 21st century by certain remote police departments in Odisha state in eastern India to provide emergency communication services following natural disasters. In March 2002, it was announced that India's Police Pigeon Service messenger system in Odisha was to be retired, due to the expanded use of the Internet. The Taliban banned the keeping or use of homing pigeons in Afghanistan.\n\nTo this day, pigeons are entered into competitions, with the winner receiving prize money at the end.\n\nResearch has been performed with the intention of discovering how pigeons, after being transported, can find their way back from distant places they have never visited before. Most researchers believe that homing ability is based on a \"map and compass\" model, with the compass feature allowing birds to orient and the map feature allowing birds to determine their location relative to a goal site (home loft). While the compass mechanism appears to rely on the sun, the map mechanism has been highly debated. Some researchers believe that the map mechanism relies on the ability of birds to detect the Earth's magnetic field. Birds can detect a magnetic field to help them find their way home. Scientists have found that on top of a pigeon's beak large number of iron particles are found which remain aligned to north like a man-made compass, thus it acts as compass which helps pigeon in determining its home. A light-mediated mechanism that involves the eyes and is lateralized has been examined somewhat, but developments have implicated the trigeminal nerve in magnetoception. Research by Floriano Papi (Italy, early 1970s) and more recent work, largely by Hans Wallraff, suggest that pigeons also orient themselves using the spatial distribution of atmospheric odors, known as olfactory navigation. Near their home lofts, in areas they have previously visited, pigeons probably are guided by visual landmarks.\n\nResearch by Jon Hagstrum of the US Geological Survey suggests that homing pigeons use low-frequency infrasound to navigate. Sound waves as low 0.1 Hz have been observed to disrupt or redirect pigeon navigation. The pigeon ear, being far too small to interpret such a long wave, directs pigeons to fly in a circle when first taking air, in order to mentally map such long infrasound waves.\n\nVarious experiments suggest that different breeds of homing pigeons rely on different cues to different extents. Charles Walcott at Cornell University was able to demonstrate that while pigeons from one loft were confused by a magnetic anomaly in the Earth it had no effect on birds from another loft away. Other experiments have shown that altering the perceived time of day with artificial lighting or using air conditioning to eliminate odors in the pigeons' home roost affected the pigeons' ability to return home.\n\nSome research also indicates that homing pigeons navigate by following roads and other man-made features, making 90-degree turns and following habitual routes, much the same way that humans navigate.\n\nGPS tracing studies also indicate that gravitational anomalies also play a role.\n\nWhen used as carrier pigeons in pigeon post a message is written on thin light paper and rolled into a small tube attached to the bird's leg. Pigeons can only go back to one \"mentally marked\" point that they have identified as their home, so \"pigeon mail\" can only work when the sender is actually holding the receiver's pigeons. White homing pigeons are used in dove-releasing ceremonies at weddings, funerals, and some sporting events.\n\nWith training, pigeons can carry up to 75 g (2.5 oz) on their backs. The German apothecary Julius Neubronner used carrier pigeons to deliver urgent medication. In 1977 a similar carrier pigeon service was set up for the transport of laboratory specimens between two English hospitals. Every morning a basket with pigeons was taken from Plymouth General Hospital to Devonport Hospital. The birds then delivered unbreakable vials back to Plymouth as needed. The 30 carrier pigeons became unnecessary in 1983 because of the closure of one of the hospitals. In the 1980s a similar system existed between two French hospitals located in Granville and Avranche.\n\nBirds were used extensively during World War I. One homing pigeon, Cher Ami, was awarded the French Croix de guerre for her heroic service in delivering 12 important messages, despite having been very badly injured.\n\nDuring World War II, the Irish Paddy, the American G.I. Joe and the English Mary of Exeter all received the Dickin Medal. They were among 32 pigeons to receive this award, for their gallantry and bravery in saving human lives with their actions. Eighty-two homing pigeons were dropped into the Netherlands with the First Airborne Division Signals as part of Operation Market Garden in World War II. The pigeons' loft was located in London, which would have required them to fly to deliver their messages. Also in World War II, hundreds of homing pigeons with the Confidential Pigeon Service were airdropped into northwest Europe to serve as intelligence vectors for local resistance agents. Birds played a vital part in the Invasion of Normandy as radios could not be used for fear of vital information being intercepted by the enemy.\n\nThe humorous IP over Avian Carriers (RFC 1149) is an Internet protocol for the transmission of messages via homing pigeon. Originally intended as an April Fools' Day RFC entry, this protocol was implemented and used, once, to transmit a message in Bergen, Norway, on April 28, 2001.\n\nIn September 2009, a South African IT company based in Durban pitted an 11-month-old bird armed with a data packed 4 GB memory stick against the ADSL service from the country's biggest Internet service provider, Telkom. The pigeon, Winston, took an hour and eight minutes to carry the data . In all, the data transfer took two hours, six minutes, and fifty-seven seconds—the same amount of time it took to transfer 4% of the data over the ADSL.\n\nHoming pigeons have been reported to be used as a smuggling technique, getting objects and narcotics across borders and into prisons. For instance, between 2009 and 2015, pigeons have been reported to carry cell phones, SIM cards, phone batteries and USB cords into prisons in the Brazilian state of São Paulo.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "46821647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46821647", "title": "Internet science", "text": "Internet science\n\nInternet science is an interdisciplinary science, which looks at all aspects of the co-evolution in the Internet networks and society and studies it. It works in the intersection of and in the gaps among a wide range of disciplines that have had to respond to the impact of the Internet on their 'home turf' and/or offer specific conceptual or methodological contributions. These include many natural sciences (e.g. complexity science, computer science, engineering, life sciences, mathematics, physics, psychology, statistics, systems and evolutionary biology), social sciences (e.g. anthropology, economics, philosophy, sociology, and political science), humanities (e.g. art, history, linguistics, literature and history) and some existing interdisciplines that cross traditional Faculty boundaries (e.g. technology, medicine, law). Professor Noshir Contractor and others have located it at the intersection of computational social science, network science, network engineering and Web science. By understanding the role of society in shaping Internet networks and being shaped by them Internet science aims to take care of the Internet in a way similar to that in which Web science aims to take care of the Web. The lingua franca in this interdisciplinary area include Internet standards and associated implementation, social processes, Internet infrastructure and policy.\n\nThere are a lot of disciplines, which support 'Internet science' using different analysis tools, designs and languages. In order to have a productive and effective dialogue between disciplines, network will have to know the incentives to make cooperation opportunities. There are three main elements of Internet science: Multidisciplinary convergence, Observability and Constructive experimentation.\n\nThe European Commission funded a Network of Excellence on Internet Science (project acronym EINS) over the period December 2011-May 2015 under the FP7 funding programme. The Network in May 2015 had 48 member universities and research organisations and 180 individual affiliate researchers. Two major international Internet science conferences were held in April 2013 and May 2015 together with an unconference at the University of Bologna in May 2014 and official workshops at international academic conferences such as Human Behavior and the Evolution of Society and international inter-governmental and multistakeholder conferences such as the 2013 United Nations Internet Governance Forum.\n\nSignificant areas of current Internet science research include:\n\nNet neutrality is the rule where Internet service providers should treat all the traffic on their networks equally. This means that companies should not slow down access or block any website content on the Web. In the United States, high-speed Internet service providers (ISPs), including AT&T, Comcast, Time Warner and Verizon, have sought support for a two-tiered Internet service model.\n\nIn 2014, President Obama announced a new plan to preserve \"net neutrality\" and to prevent Internet service providers from blocking or slowing websites or creating different tiers of speed. He said-, \"No service should be stuck in a ‘slow lane’ because it does not pay a fee,\" he wrote in a statement. \"That kind of gatekeeping would undermine the level playing field essential to the Internet’s growth.\"\n\nInternet privacy (online privacy) is an opportunity of individuals to regulate the flow of information and have access to data, which is generated during a browsing session. Moreover, internet privacy may include some risks, like phishing, pharming, spyware and malware.\n\nThe fact is that Google has signed two contracts with wind developers to power its data center in Finland with 100% renewable energy. Facebook's decision was to build a data center in Iowa and has helped to drive the local energy provider in order to scrap plans to build a nuclear power plant, and instead build a $2bn(£1.23bn) wind farm, which has led to the biggest single order of wind turbines on record.\n\nInfrastructure provides a large range of vital services, for example an ability to move goods, people and information. Also it provides a range of vital services such as the ability to move goods, people, and information safely. It is necessary to support social life and nation's economic because it is essential that such infrastructural services continue in the face of various hazards. It concerns of the idea that infrastructural services gas, electricity, water, transport, banking are highly interconnected and mutually dependent in various complex ways, being linked both physically and through important ICT systems, in order to breakdowns quickly escalate into whole infrastructure failure.\n\nAn initial listing of datasets, analytic tools and e-Infrastructures is available in a dedicated Internet science evidence base.There is ongoing activity on the development of Internet Science curricula, initially on a postgraduate level.\n\n1934: The first person who imagined a 'Radiated Library' in 1934 was Paul Otlet.\n\n1965: Two different computers started to communicate at MIT Lincoln Lab by using a packet-switching technology.\n\n1968: Beranek and Newman have discovered an effectiveness and final version of the Interface Message Processor (IMP) specifications.\n\n1969: The nodes were installed by UCLA’s Network Measurement Centre, Stanford Research Institute (SRI), University of California-Santa Barbara and University of Utah.\n\n1972: Ray Tomlinson has introduced a network email.

{"id": "2140677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2140677", "title": "List of sports rivalries", "text": "List of sports rivalries\n\nA sports rivalry is intense competition between athletic teams or athletes, but not directly related to the formal sport and the practice thereof. This pressure of competition is felt by players, coaches, and management, but is perhaps felt strongest by the fans. The intensity of the rivalry varies from a friendly competition on one end to serious violence on the other that, in one case (the Football War), was suggested to have led to military conflicts. Owners typically encourage rivalries as they tend to improve game attendance and television ratings for rivalry matches, but a rivalry that gets out of control can lead to fighting, hooliganism, rioting and some, with career-ending or even fatal consequences. Clubs can reduce fan aggression surrounding rivalry games by acknowledging rather than downplaying the conflict because the rivalry is an integral part of fan identity.\n\nRivalries stem from various sources. Simple geographic proximity as well as frequent meetings in important games can lead to rivalries. Games between two rivals of close geographical proximity are usually called a local derby, or simply just derby ( , ); a sporting fixture between two teams from the same town, city or region, particularly in association football.\n\nThe phrase most likely originated from The Derby, a horse race in England, founded by the 12th Earl of Derby in 1780. The 19th Earl has since confirmed the Derby name was given to only two sporting events: the Rugby league game from either end of the family's Knowsley estate between St Helens and Wigan being the other. Since at least as early as 1840 'derby' has been used as a noun in English to denote any kind of sporting contest. Another possible origin of the term is that the town of Derby was renowned as the site of a chaotic and exuberant game that involved the whole town and often resulted in fatalities. The goals were at Nuns Mill in the north and the Gallows Balk in the south of the town, and much of the action took place in the River Derwent or the Markeaton Brook. Nominally the players came from All Saints' and St Peter's parishes, but in practice the game was a with as many as 1,000 players. A Frenchman who observed the match in 1829 wrote in horror, 'if Englishmen call this play, it would be impossible to say what they call fighting'. The traditional Shrovetide football match is still an annual event in the town of Ashbourne, Derbyshire.\n\nIn the United States, the term crosstown rivalry is more commonly encountered for this type of rivalry.\n\n\nIn Swedish bandy, derby games are often played on Saint Stephen's Day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONEFA/CONADEIP (National College Association of American Football/National College Sports Commission of Private Institutions)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2274056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274056", "title": "Madge Weinstein", "text": "Madge Weinstein\n\nMadge Bertha Weinstein is a fictional Internet personality who maintains Yeast Radio, which has developed a cult following and was among the 50 most-subscribed-to podcasts in 2005. Weinstein is the creation and alter ego of underground filmmaker Richard Bluestein and was described by USA Today as \"representative of the type of over-the-top content that would never see the light of day at a mainstream media outlet\".\n\nAlthough Weinstein is a fictional character (and never admitted as such), the majority of opinions, social-political commentary and oblique characteristics of her personality are clearly reflective of Bluestein's own. In essence, Weinstein is both an extension and distortion of Bluestein's actual personality.\n\nWeinstein is an outspoken breast cancer survivor and opinionated Jewish lesbian activist. She is a Vassar College graduate, a \"woman of Luna\" and claims to be a co-founder of the Lilith Fair. She was also the band manager of the now disbanded riot grrrl rock group, 'Goddess Riot Juice'. She is the self-professed \"Margaret Mead of podcasting\" as she is an amateur cultural anthropologist who, in her free time, studies the sordid sexual activities of homosexual men. She is well known for her advocacy on a variety of women's issues including her long tenure as a spokeswoman on behalf of women suffering from vaginal yeast. Weinstein also suffers from food allergies and fibromyalgia.\n\nWeinstein is the daughter of Irving Weinstein, a funeral director and owner of Weinstein & Schlump Funeral Homes. She grew up in the Grand Concourse in the borough of the Bronx in New York City. She is the former lover of Ethel Merman (although she tends to exaggerate the details of their now infamous 1967 tryst during Ethel's daughter's funeral) and has had affairs with Martina Navratilova, Ellen DeGeneres, k.d. lang, Melissa Etheridge and Rosie O'Donnell. In her youth, she claims to have performed oral sex on Nancy Reagan which she now regrets. Weinstein's most notable lesbian relationship was with Gussie Iscowicz (the alter ego of Bluestein's late partner Juan Montealegre), an elderly hairdresser living in Miami, Florida who suffered from Alzheimer's. For many years, Weinstein edited gay pornography for an urban audience (for a company known only as 'the Dorm'). She currently resides in Miami, Florida with her Italian greyhound Trotsky.\n\nWeinstein co-manages the sister site, Insane Films, which features personal video blogs of Madge's alter ego, Richard Bluestein, as well as features by underground filmmakers and miscellaneous visual content. Insane Films is one of the earliest videoblogs ever created, originating sometime in 2000. However, Madge Weinstein's fame grew largely from her indie podcast Yeast Radio, which began in late November 2004 . Weinstein gained notoriety for her viral video, \"Cooking With Madge: Lesbians On Acid\", which featured a disheveled Madge and her unstable, ambiguously gendered friends attempting to cook \"les beans\" while high on LSD. A pioneer of the podcasting medium, Adam Curry, helped promote the show in its early life. In late April 2005, Weinstein created Yeast2, a free-form experimental channel in which \"anyone (could) contribute to the strange, ugly, pretty macabra [sic] and surreal.\" Yeast2 closed in 2008.\n\nIn early July 2005, Weinstein became one of the first members of Adam Curry's PodShow and was featured heavily in the program, which aired on Sirius Satellite Radio from 6-10 p.m. EST on weekdays before the company's ties with the radio network were controversially severed on May 1, 2007. Weinstein's contract with PodShow ended in April 2008.\n\nAround the same time, Madge Weinstein co-created \"Eat This Hot Show\" a collaborative podcast featuring five notable members of the ever-growing \"queercast\" community: Weinstein, Ragan Fox, Wanda Wisdom, Fausto Fernos and his partner Marc Felion. However, Fausto and Marc were expelled from the show after ten episodes due to internal conflicts with fellow hosts, and the three featured a weekly guest in the episodes following. The show eventually dissipated in this format although, in April 2008, the show was revived with Madge, Wanda and new co-host Auntie Vera Charles. As of 2014, after another hiatus and the departure of Auntie Vera Charles, new episodes are being recorded sporadically with current co-hosts Ragan Fox and Wanda Wisdom. Madge Weinstein and Wanda Wisdom also co-created the online community Qpodder.org, which collects podcasts by gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people or characters. Sibling site NellyGator.com allows listeners to subscribe to a single RSS feed containing all podcast episodes from the members of Qpodder. In mid-October 2005, Weinstein, a self-described \"pioneering lesbian,\" began heavily promoting the medium of queer video blogging to coincide with the advent of the video iPod. Her new endeavor Faggregator.com does to videoblogging what Nellygator did for podcasting, and features a single page which houses all the video material submitted by members of the Qpodder community.\n\nBluestein experienced two personal losses in 2006. Juan Montealegre died on February 11, 2006, after a battle with cancer. Not long thereafter, on May 2, 2006, his 14-year-old dog Chauncey, a heavy fixture on the show in its early days including a memorable episode where Weinstein angrily cleaned up his feces, also died. On September 27, 2006, Richard Bluestein announced on Yeast Radio that he was retiring the character Madge and taking over hosting duties himself due to creative concerns. Madge was reported to be in a hospital in Guadalajara, Mexico, where she received adjustable gastric band surgery for her ongoing weight problem. The surgery went horribly wrong, leaving her in a critical condition. Madge eventually recovered and returned to the show on November 7, 2006.\n\nIn early January 2008, with the threat of her expiring PodShow contract, Weinstein relaunched Yeast Radio as a live show, airing on her website from 10:00 CT on Fridays. The live format continued until the end of May 2008 when Weinstein decided to return to a more free-form, unscheduled format. In early 2009, Weinstein resumed streaming live shows sporadically. The 1000th episode of Yeast Radio was streamed live on February 12, 2010.\n\nWeinstein's rebellious, queer punk ethics and her podcast's unconventional content, strong, coarse language and stream-of-consciousness structure have made her an endlessly controversial icon within the more conservative podcasting community. Her show serves as an ongoing protest against censorship, the commercialization of mainstream radio and the continued marginalization of gays and lesbians by the growing monoculture.\n\nWeinstein features a variety of crude and eccentric characters on her show. Some frequent contributors:\n\n\nThe show regularly features audio clips involving psychic Sylvia Browne, feminist writer Helen Gurley Brown, \"Big Meets Bigger\", \"My Strange Addiction\" and other television programs about morbid obesity and bizarre personal habits.\n\nWeinstein has also interviewed political activist Cindy Sheehan, Wigstock founder Lady Bunny, Democracy Now! reporter Amy Goodman, pioneer of the transgressive art movement Nick Zedd, collaborative documentary filmmaker Kent Bye of The Echo Chamber Project and the experimental, underground filmmakers Usama Alshaibi and Kristie Alshaibi. The show frequently features original compositions from Taylor E. Ross (described as Madge's \"cunt doctor\"), the mysterious \"Mr. Zeeche\" and Dave from the Chub Creek's podcast.

Buy Me!. In addition to her 40 plus children's books, Joanne's by-line appeared in Working Mother Magazine, Parents, Parenting, Child, Family Circle and Ladies' Home Journal. She wrote other parenting books while on the publication staff at The Bank Street College of Education, where she received her Masters in Children's Literature. Her books have won the Mott Literacy Award, the National Council for Social Studies Carter G. Woodson Book Award and she is the recipient of the Curious George Award for Literacy. (For a fuller bio visit joanneoppenheim.com.)\n\nIn 1989 Stephanie was practicing corporate law in NYC. Since she was five she wanted to be a lawyer—like her dad, grandfather, great uncle and brother. It was amusing that her mother played with toys for a living. Her friends starting calling for toy advice from Joanne...which mobile? which ride on? Quite honestly, Stephanie couldn't quite understand what the big deal was...you go to the store and buy a toy. When Stephanie had her first son, everything changed. She quickly discovered that there was no independent consumer information about children's media. After many lengthy conversations, Stephanie convinced Joanne to start the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio.\n\nThe original newsletter was a big hit and the mother/daughter team wrote their first book together for HarperCollins in 1994, The Best Toys, Books, Videos and Music for Kids. In 1998, they formed their own publishing company and published the first annual Oppenheim Toy Portfolio. They also published their Read It! Play It! Literacy Series. During this time, Joanne published several more books for and about children and welcomed seven grandchildren into the family. Stephanie had another child and received a Masters in Psychology from NYU with a specialization in parenthood.\n\nTheir Oppenheim Toy Portfolio awards have become a benchmark of excellence with consumers, toy makers and the media.

Prostitution occurs on the streets, in bars, brothels and in logging, mining, and palm oil areas. In 2010 it was estimated there were 2.000 prostitutes in the capital, Port Moresby. The draught in 2016 caused a rise in prostitution. Many of the women have turned to sex work due to poverty or unemployment.\n\nHIV, sex trafficking and child prostitution are problems in Papua New Guinea.\n\nThe legal situation in Papua New Guinea is complex. The Summary Offences Act 1977 makes keeping a brothel and living on the earnings of prostitution offences. The idea of the law was to decriminalise prostitution but criminalise those who sought to exploit or profit from it. In 1978, a Papua New Guinea court interpreted ‘living on the earnings of prostitution’ to include 'profit from one's own prostitution'. (Wemay v Tumdual) The ruling effectively made all prostitution illegal. In a further case it was ruled that \"occasional transactional sex for small amounts of money was insufficient to warrant a conviction\". This may be a unique legal situation in that prostitution is made illegal not by Statute law but by case law.\n\nIn rural areas, 'customary law' is also in force. These laws are not written down, but are based on the knowledge of the laws of the indigenous peoples.\n\nThere have been calls to legalise prostitution. In October 2016, a private member's Bill was introduced to Parliament by the Member for Sumkar, Ken Fairweather, to instigate legalisation. Prime Minister Peter O'Neill and Oro Governor Gary Juffa said they would oppose any call for legalisation.\n\nLaw enforcement is inconsistent. Sex workers and NGOs report corruption amongst police. There also report violence, intimidation, abuse, extortion and rape at the hands of the police. Knowingly transmitting HIV contrary to the HIV/AIDS Management and Prevention Act (HAMP) Act 2003 is sometimes used to detain sex workers, but there is no evidence of any charges being brought under this legislation.\n\nThe country has the highest HIV prevalence in the Pacific. Sex workers are one of the high risk groups, although HIV response in the country is now being directed towards the high risk groups. Access to healthcare is poor for sex workers. UNAIDS estimated an HIV prevalence of 17.8% amongst sex workers in 2016.\n\nPapua New Guinea is a source, transit, and destination country for women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. Foreign and local women and children are subjected to sex trafficking, including near logging, mining, and palm oil sites. “Mosko Girls”, young girls employed in bars to provide companionship to patrons and sell an alcoholic drink called mosko, are vulnerable to human trafficking, especially around major cities. Within the country, children and women from rural areas are deceived, often by relatives, with promises of legitimate work or education to travel to different provinces where they are subjected to sex trafficking. NGOs report some parents receive money from traffickers who exploited their teenage daughters in prostitution, including near mining and logging sites. Children, including girls as young as 5 years old from remote rural areas, are reportedly subjected to sex trafficking by members of their immediate family or tribe. Tribal leaders reportedly trade with each other the service of girls and women for guns and to forge political alliances.\n\nYoung girls sold into polygamous marriages may be exploited in prostitution. In urban areas, parents reportedly exploit their children in sex trafficking directly or in brothels as a means to support their families or to pay for school fees. Government officials reportedly facilitate trafficking by accepting bribes to allow undocumented migrants to enter the country or ignore trafficking situations, and some may exploit sex trafficking victims or procure victims for other individuals in return for political favours or votes.\n\nMalaysian and Chinese logging companies arrange for some foreign women to enter the country voluntarily with fraudulently issued tourist or business visas. After their arrival, many of these women, from countries including Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, China, and the Philippines, are turned over to traffickers who transport them to logging and mining camps, fisheries, and entertainment sites, and exploit them in forced prostitution.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Papua New Guinea as a \"Tier 3\" country.\n"}

{"id": "25477069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25477069", "title": "Ramanattam", "text": "Ramanattam\n\nRamanattam (Malayalam: രാമനാട്ടം, IAST: Rāmanāṭṭaṃ) is a temple art in Kerala, India. The dance drama presents the story of Rama in a series of eight plays and was created under the patronage of Veera Kerala Varma (AD 1653-1694) \"alias\" Kottarakkara Thampuran. Ramanattom is based on a story from the epic \"Ramayana\", covering the incarnation of Rama to the Rama-Ravana War, Ravana's defeat and Rama's crowning at Ayodhya. The story was written by Kottarakkara Thampuran and is divided into eight poetic sections so that each section can be enacted in one day. These eight sections are puthrakameshti, seetha swayamvaram, vicchinnabhishekam, kharavadham, balivadham, thoranayudham, sethubandhanam and yudham (war). Ramanattam is widely believed to be the immediate stem of the well known classical art form of Kerala, Kathakali.\n\nAfter the staging and creation of Krishnattam by the then Zamorin Raja of Calicut in 1657 AD, its fame spread all over Kerala. Its success induced the neighbouring chief of the Raja of Kottarakkara (Kottarakkara Thampuran) to request the Zamorin for the loan of a troupe of performers on the eve of some festive occasion. It is said that due to internal feuds and political rivalry between the chieftains of the neighbouring States, the Zamorin, besides refusing to send the performers, insulted and humiliated the Raja of Kottarakkara with the remark,\n\n\" It is useless to depute the troupe, because your (Raja of Kottarakkara's) court would be neither able to appreciate nor understand anything of the highly artistic Krishnattam and the high standard of the performance \"\n\nHere the political rivalry between the two chieftains turned into art rivalry and lead to the Kottarakkara Thampuran, initiating a parallel mode of entertainment, which he called Ramanattam. While the Zamorin of Calicut, Manaveda's Krishnattam was written in Sanskrit, the \"language of the gods\"; Ramanattam was in Malayalam, the language of the people.\n\nThe Raja of Kottayam (Kottayathu Thampuran) refined Ramanattam into Kathakali. Kottayathu Tampuran who belonged to the first part of eighteenth century was a poet and a preceptor of dramatics who gave a scientific basis to Kathakali and Attakkatha literature. Bakavadham, Kirmeeravadham, Kalyana saugandhikam and Nivathakayacha kalakeyavadham are the four perfect Kottayam works. And these works are foremost in literary beauty and musical quality and have substantial acting possibilities. Simple arrangement of padams, sweetness of expressions, and depth in conception appear in the works of Thampuran from start to finish. The contributions of Kottayathu Tampuran are invaluable as far as literature, music and technical aspects are concerned. Acceptance of the theory that the literature must be beautiful and sublime if its enactment is to be fully relished was another important development. The most important contribution of Tampuran towards refining Ramanattom to Kathakali was that he steadied the scientific basis of its literature, music and acting.\n"}

The reverse movement is used when walking backwards. This, when properly performed, gives the impression that the dancer is somewhat sliding on the floor, and the loose movements of the hands create the impression that the dancer is not totally in control of the direction of movement. \n\nThis step dance is considered by many dancers as the Brazilian version of Melbourne Shuffle and Hard Style.\n\nIt is unknown which came first, but a similar type of dance that originated from Johannesburg, South Africa called \"Stepping\" or \"Skitting\" began in 2006.

It is a remake of the 1987 film of the same name also written by Neumeier and Miner. The film stars Joel Kinnaman as the title character, with Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton, Samuel L. Jackson, Abbie Cornish and Jackie Earle Haley in supporting roles.\n\nScreen Gems first announced a remake in 2005, but it was halted one year later. Darren Aronofsky and David Self were originally assigned to direct and write the film, respectively, for a tentative 2010 release. The film was delayed numerous times, and Padilha signed on in 2011. In March 2012, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (successor company to Orion Pictures until September 11, 2014, the studio that released the original film) announced an August 2013 release, but that was then changed to February 2014. The principal characters were cast from March to July 2012. Principal photography began in September 2012 in Toronto and Vancouver in Canada, with additional locations in Hamilton, in Canada, and Detroit in the United States.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on February 12, 2014. \"RoboCop\" received mixed reviews, with praise for the performances, updates, style and political/media satire, but criticism for its lack of violence, social satire and humor compared to the original film, and grossed $242 million against its $100 million budget.\n\nIn 2028, multinational conglomerate OmniCorp revolutionizes warfare with the introduction of robotic peacekeepers capable of maintaining law and order in hot spots such as Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Iran. Led by CEO Raymond Sellars, the company moves to market its technology to domestic law enforcement, but the passage of the Dreyfus Act, forbidding deployment of drones in the United States, prevents this. Aware that most Americans oppose the use of military systems in their communities, Sellars asks Dr. Dennett Norton and his research team to create an alternative. The result is a proposal for a cyborg police officer. However, Norton informs Sellars that only someone who is stable enough to handle being a cyborg can be turned into one, and some candidates are rejected.\n\nA Detroit police detective, Alex Murphy, is chosen after he is critically injured in a car bomb explosion arranged by crime boss Antoine Vallon in revenge for Murphy's investigation into his activities. Norton persuades Murphy's wife Clara to sign off on the procedure. Upon waking up and realizing the extent of his transformation, Murphy flies into a rage and escapes from the lab, but Norton shuts him down and brings him back to the lab. As Norton reveals to Murphy that the only remnants of his human body are most of his head (excluding parts of the brain), his respiratory organs, his heart, and his right hand, Murphy is disgusted, and asks for euthanasia. Norton reminds Murphy about his wife's and son's patience, and convinces him to live on. During combat training with trainer Rick Mattox, Murphy proves unable to compete with the standard OmniCorp drones in efficiency. Norton alters his programming to make him more efficient by having drone programming take over his actions, but make him think they are his. This increases his efficiency dramatically, but also makes him less empathetic due to his human nature being bypassed.\n\nShortly before he is to be publicly unveiled, Murphy has an emotional breakdown, forcing Norton to remove his emotions. During the ceremony, RoboCop identifies and apprehends a criminal in the crowd. He goes on to reduce crime in Detroit dramatically, simultaneously increasing public support for repealing the Dreyfus Act. Aware that Clara has begun to ask questions, Sellars orders Norton to keep her away from her husband.\n\nClara nevertheless manages to confront RoboCop, telling him of their son David's nightmares. The experience leads Murphy to override his programming and access the previously sealed files on his attempted murder. From them, he learns his son was devastated after witnessing the explosion. Murphy pursues Vallon's gang to exact revenge. He takes heavy damage from their armor-piercing weapons, but manages to kill the boss and his men. Murphy returns to the station and joins with his old partner, Jack Lewis, to confront the two corrupt cops who betrayed him to Vallon, shooting one and tazing the other. Learning that the Chief of Police was also involved, Murphy moves to arrest her, but is remotely shut down by Mattox.\n\nWith the help of Pat Novak, a pro-OmniCorp talk show host, Sellars uses the incident to get the Dreyfus Act repealed. Clara goes to the press and angrily demands to see her husband. Fearful of being exposed, Sellars orders Mattox to destroy RoboCop while he's being repaired, while he lies to Clara, saying that Alex died. Norton is able to reach him first and reveals the truth. RoboCop narrowly escapes from the building just as it undergoes lockdown.\n\nMurphy returns and storms the building, fighting his way through the ED-209 drones sent to stop him, while Lewis and his fellow police arrive to hold off the rest of OmniCorp's forces. Mattox subdues Murphy and prepares to finish him off, but is killed by Lewis. Murphy then makes his way to the roof where Sellars is waiting for a helicopter with Clara and David as hostages. Murphy's programming initially prevents him from arresting Sellars, but he overcomes it long enough to kill Sellars when Sellars overconfidently continues to taunt him.\n\nOmniCorp's parent company, OCP, shuts down the project. The President vetoes the repeal of the Dreyfus Act based on the testimony of Norton, to Novak's anger. Murphy's body is rebuilt in Norton's laboratory, and he waits for Clara and David, who are coming to visit him.\n\n\nScreen Gems first announced that it was working on a new \"RoboCop\" film in late 2005; no further details were given. In November 2006, \"Bloody Disgusting\" reported that the \"RoboCop\" remake had been halted. In March 2008, \"RoboCop\" was mentioned in an MGM press release regarding franchises it would be developing in the future. An MGM poster displayed at the Licensing International Expo of June 2008 read, \"\"RoboCop\" coming 2010.\" The studio met with Darren Aronofsky to discuss the possibility of him directing the film. At the San Diego Comic-Con International 2008, Aronofsky was confirmed to direct the \"2010 \"RoboCop\"\" film, with David Self writing the script. The release date was postponed to 2011. At the San Diego Comic-Con in July 2009, MGM representatives stated only that the film would be pushed back to Summer 2010 or a later date, due to scheduling conflicts with the director (most likely Aronofsky). MGM representatives would neither confirm nor deny if Aronofsky was still connected with the project. On January 5, 2010, it was reported that the \"RoboCop\" 2011 remake was indeed on hold and Darren Aronofsky was still attached to direct. When MGM executives, particularly MGM chairperson Mary Parent, saw the immense success of the James Cameron film \"Avatar\", it was clear to the higher-ups that they wanted a 3D film for the new \"RoboCop\". Due to the financial state of MGM at the time, without an owner, and creative disagreements between the studio and Aronofsky, the film remained on hold. On March 2, 2011, it was announced that Brazilian director José Padilha was attached to direct, instead of Aronofsky, mainly because of his commercial success with \"Elite Squad\" and \"\". On March 11, 2011, Sean O'Neal of \"The A.V. Club\" stated that up-and-coming screenwriter Joshua Zetumer would write the script. Although Zetumer had been involved with a number of canceled or otherwise stagnant projects, he had also worked on the screenplay for \"Quantum of Solace\". Comparing the new work to the 1987 film, Padilha said in 2011, \"the environment nowadays is different than the environment in the 80's and the way to explore the concept is different.\" It was announced in October 2013 that the film would get an IMAX release in February 2014. Columbia Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer distributed the film in United States, Canada, and worldwide with the exclusion of United Kingdom, France, Germany, Switzerland and Austria, where StudioCanal handled distribution.\n\nOn April 12, 2011, rumors stated that MGM was looking at A-list stars such as Tom Cruise, Johnny Depp, and Keanu Reeves to star in the lead role of Alex Murphy/RoboCop in the upcoming remake. On June 16, 2011, pictures of promotional art were released, as well as a sales sheet from the Licensing International Expo 2011 in Las Vegas, NV, promoting a future release of \"RoboCop\" which would re-invent the franchise. The promotional material had sparse details of the film but clearly stated that MGM was targeting a 2013 release and José Padilha of \"Elite Squad\" and \"Bus 174\" fame was confirmed as director of the film. Michael Fassbender, Matthias Schoenaerts, and Russell Crowe were considered to play the title role. On March 3, 2012, it was confirmed that actor Joel Kinnaman would be playing the lead role, and on March 9, 2012, the film was given a release date of August 9, 2013. Hugh Laurie was set to play the role of the CEO of OmniCorp on June 13, 2012 but he later declined. Clive Owen was in the running to replace him until Michael Keaton was cast in the role in August 2012. Edward Norton, Sean Penn, Gael García Bernal, and Rebecca Hall were initially considered for the roles of Dr. Dennett Norton, Novak, Jack Lewis, and Clara Murphy, respectively. The roles ended up being cast with Gary Oldman, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael K. Williams, and Abbie Cornish. Jackie Earle Haley officially signed on in July 2012 to play a \"military man named Mattox responsible for training Kinnaman's RoboCop\". Jay Baruchel was confirmed to have signed onto the film on July 25, 2012, as Pope, a marketing exec for OmniCorp. Douglas Urbanski, cast as Mayor Durant, is typically a non-actor who is also the decades-long manager and producing partner of Gary Oldman. Rob Bottin's original costume for the title character was re-imagined. Initial reactions were unfavorable and some compared it with Christian Bale's Batman suit in Christopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\" films. News reports discussed the new costume's \"bionic behind\", a \"rather derivative\" design which \"looks more like kevlar body armor than Detroit steel\". \"The Guardian\" described the new RoboCop as \"a crime-fighting machine who is not so much cyborg as skinny bloke in matte-black body armour.\" and said \"The new Robosuit has a scaly, insectoid look to it, with a blacked-out visor rather than the original's steel extended helmet.\" Before starting filming, Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles revealed that Padilha called him to admit he was having \"the worst experience of his life\" and \"for every ten ideas he has, nine are cut\". Padilha, according to Meirelles, says, \"It's hell here. The film will be good, but I have never suffered so much and I don't want to do it again\". However, Padilha talked enthusiastically about the project at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International and in his introduction to the second trailer. Production began in September 2012.\n\nFilming took place in Toronto, Vancouver and other parts of Ontario. Shooting locations within the city included the University of Toronto where a scene was filmed that appeared to be RoboCop being unveiled to the city of Detroit. Filming in Hamilton began on Monday, September 24, 2012 for five nights. Streets were closed for each of those days from 6pm to 7am. A spokesperson for MGM confirmed that the film was partially shot in Detroit.\n\nPedro Bromfman, who collaborated with José Padilha on his \"Elite Squad\" films, composed the score.\n\nAn OmniCorp website was set up in early 2012. A film-specific \"RoboCop\" site was launched nearer the release date. A rough trailer and some film footage featuring Samuel L. Jackson's and Michael Keaton's characters was shown at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International. According to director Padilha, the first theatrical trailer was supposed to debut with \"Elysium\", but it was instead released online on September 5, 2013, and was attached to showings of \"Riddick\". Two further trailers were also released, one of which was uploaded to Yahoo! Movies with an introduction from Padilha, in which he said, \"I'm thrilled to have had the chance to direct this movie... I'm a fan of the original movie because it was ahead of its time both aesthetically and thematically. Back in '87, it was talking already about automated violence — both in war and law enforcement. And now, we actually have that happening in our lives and it's going to be more and more present. So we already have the drones. Now we're going to have automated robots doing law enforcement and replacing soldiers in the battlefield. So we had a chance to make this movie and talk about this.\" Two main posters were released in late 2013, with one showing CTBA complex in Madrid. TV spots were uploaded to Sony Pictures and StudioCanal UK's YouTube channels from January 2014. A video game for Android and iOS was released as a tie-in to the film. Jada Toys released a range of action figures, including a radio control RoboCop on his Police Cruiser and roleplay merchandise including the new RoboCop helmet and chestplate. Two detailed figures from the film were released in April 2014 from Play Arts Kai. The company threezero is also creating two RoboCop figures and a camo-coloured ED-209. were published weekly starting from the week of theatrical release in the US. They were collected in a trade paperback edition under the title \"RoboCop: The Human Element\" to coincide with the home media releases.\n\n\"RoboCop\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray on June 3, 2014 in the United States by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. Best Buy had an exclusive Metalpak edition, while the Target edition came with an exclusive digital download of the previously unreleased comic \"Gauntlet\". In the UK, an exclusive Amazon steelbook was made available on June 9.\n\nTo coincide with the home media releases, Detroit celebrated with \"RoboCop Day\" on June 3, 2014, during which RoboCop was photographed with fans throughout the city, and threw the first pitch at the Detroit Tigers game.\n\n\"Robocop\" opened in 3,372 theaters in The United States and grossed $21,681,430, with an average of $6,430 per theater and ranking #3 at the box office. The film ultimately earned $58,607,007 domestically and $184,081,958 internationally for a total of $242,688,965, on a $100 million budget.\n\n\"RoboCop\" received mixed reviews. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 49% based on 191 reviews and an average rating of 5.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"While it's far better than it could have been, José Padilha's \"RoboCop\" remake fails to offer a significant improvement over the original.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average based on selected critic reviews, the film has a score of 52 out of 100 based on 41 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film a \"B+\" grade, on an A+ to F scale.\n\n\"RoboCop\" received several comparisons to the 1987 film; the consensus was that it fell short. Guy Lodge of \"Variety\" said that \"It's a less playful enterprise than the original, but meets the era's darker demands for action reboots with machine-tooled efficiency and a hint of soul.\" Leslie Felperin from \"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote that the remake \"has a better cast, more meticulous script and, naturally, flashier effects, but it lacks the original's wit and subversive slipperiness.\" Brian Viner from \"Daily Mail\" said that while he was \"not predisposed to like this shiny new RoboCop for making me feel ancient, it does have an appealing vitality.\" Andrew Osmond from \"SFX\" says, \"It’s not a classic like Paul Verhoeven's 1987 original, but it is an excellent, intelligent SF drama\", believing it is \"one of the boldest Hollywood reboots we’ve seen yet.\"\n\nChris Hewitt from \"Empire\" wrote, \"there’s a sense that Padilha, or perhaps his corporate overlords, don’t really get what made the original so special.\" Nigel Andrews from \"Financial Times\" called it \"a leaden, needless remake\". Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" wrote it was \"a dumbed-down shoot-em-up frontloaded with elaborate but perfunctory new 'satirical' material in which the movie loses interest with breathtaking speed\". His fellow \"Guardian\" film critic Mark Kermode rated it 3 out of 5 stars, writing that \"against the odds, this emerges as far less depressing fare than one might have expected, retaining the key elements of political satire and philosophical musings that powered Verhoeven's original\" and \"at least it appears to have been made by someone who understands what made the original great.\"\n\nOn September 11, 2015, Den of Geek reported that Sony was working on a sequel. However in July 2018, it was announced the series would again be rebooted with a film directed by Neill Blomkamp, titled \"RoboCop Returns\", which will serve as a sequel to Verhoeven's original film and ignore the events of previous sequels and the 2014 reboot.\n\n\n"}

It was founded by Jerry Lucey in 1978. The name was derived from Henry O'Shea, a baker and building owner in the South Main Street area of Cork city. The club was known for its Dance, Trance, R&B, Hip Hop and regular live rock concerts. Gigs held there included a number by The Golden Horde, Toasted Heretic, Sonic Youth/Nirvana, Therapy?, The Wedding Present and The Fall.\n\nDuring late 1980s the club ran a series of three-night long acid house weekenders, which attracted DJs such as Laurent Garnier, Shades of Rhythm and Justin Robertson. From the mid 1990s its dance nights were mostly deep house. The venue closed in June 2003 and the building demolished soon after.\n\nSir Henrys was a rock bar for many of its early years, a large video screen in front of the stage showed rock videos for customers. In the early to mid 1980s its clientele included members of Nun Attax (later \"Five Go Down To The Sea\") and Belsonic Sound. The club at the time also held gigs by an older and more traditional \"pub rock\" element, but this scene had died out by circa 1987.\n\nMany of Ireland's up-and-coming young bands performed here and the 'Battle of the Bands' was held there for a number of years where unsigned talent competed for a recording contract. Artists that performed there over these years included Phil Lynott, John Martyn, ex-Clash Mick Jones' Big Audio Dynamite, The Pogues and The Sisters of Mercy.\n\nOn August 20, 1991, Sonic Youth played Sir Henry's, supported by the then virtually unknown band Nirvana. Some scenes were featured in the documentary \"\".\n\nAs dance music became more popular and the demand for small venue live gigs decreased, Sir Henry's became a venue for the \"Sweat\" night. Started in 1988 by Shane Johnson and Greg Dowling, this was to become one of the top clubs in Europe in the early 1990s, supplemented with the addition of the Back Bar with DJ's such as Donkeyman (Mark Ring) and Stephen Grainger (Stevie G).\n\nOver the 1990s Sweat built up an international reputation, being variously described as \"a gorgeous blend of underground house\" (i-D), a \"deep house frenzy\" (The Face) and \"the best music on that side of the Irish Sea\" (DJ Magazine). By the mid 1990s Sir Henry’s had become a house venue, playing host to some of genre's better known artists such as Kerri Chandler, Jerome Sydenham, Roger Sanchez, Glenn Underground, Cajmere, Derrick May, Migs, Fred Everything, Charles Webster, Kevin McKay, DJ Deep, and Mike Pickering.\n\nThe short independent films \"120 bpm\" and \"The House That Cork Built\" record the club's place in Irish House music. The venue hosted the \"alternative\" disco night \"Freakscene\" for many years.\n\nThe venue was seen as \"more than just a nightclub\" and is remembered with affection. Cork hurler Brian Corcoran devoted a section of his autobiography, \"Every Single Ball\", to the venue, saying it was the only nightclub in which he truly felt comfortable. The club's flyers, posters, and compilation tapes were collected by regulars as souvenirs.\n\n\n\n"}

The players stay off the floor by standing on furniture or the room's architecture. The players generally may not remain still, and are required to move from one piece of furniture to the next. The game can be played with a group or alone for self amusement. There may even be a goal, to which the players must race. The game may also be played outdoors in playgrounds or similar areas. Players can also set up obstacles to make the game more challenging. This is a variation of an obstacle course.\n\nTypically, any individual can start the game just by shouting \"The floor is lava!\" Any player remaining on the floor in the next few seconds is \"out\" and can not rejoin the game for some period of time.\n\nThere often are tasks, items or places that can \"regenerate\" lost body parts or health. Depending on the players, these could be embarrassing tasks, or simple things like finding a particular person.\n\nIn one version called \"Hot Lava Monster\", usually played on playgrounds, players must stay off the ground (sand, rubber, woodchips, etc.) and on the play equipment. The person who is posing as 'monster' can be on the 'lava' with the objective of attempting to tag another player. 'Monster' must try to tag or catch the other players. In some versions, 'monster' is not allowed to touch certain obstacles, such as wooden platforms or may only touch objects of a certain colour. The \"Monster\" player must navigate across structures such as across playground slides, Monkey bars, Ropes courses, etc. instead of the main platform.\n\nBy using the Stefan–Boltzmann law and taking convection into account, University of Leicester scientists have calculated that a high stakes version of the game would not be playable with actual lava, as the air above the lava would have a temperature too high for humans to survive for more than a few seconds.\n\nThis activity is addressed in the 2015 animated film \"Inside Out\", in which it is enjoyed by a girl named Riley Andersen in her childhood. The activity then becomes part of her long-term memory, creating a lake of lava inside her mind, filled with floating architecture. After being accidentally sent to long-term memory, two of her chief emotions, Joy and Sadness, must cross the lake in search of a way to return to their control headquarters. The former enjoys reenacting the activity to find a way back, but the latter complains about the experience being too interactive.\n\n\n\n"}

The toastmaster is typically charged with organization of the event, arranging the order of speakers, introducing one or more of the speakers, and keeping the event on schedule. Such meetings typically include civic events, service organization meetings, and banquets of various purpose. In many meetings, a toastmaster typically addresses the audience from behind a dais or from a podium. At stage entertainment events, especially ones broadcast on live television, the toastmaster often takes the form of a master of ceremonies, introducing the entertainment acts. \n\nJames Toole, father of actor John Lawrence Toole was possibly the first professional Toastmaster during the 1840's in London. There are many allusions to him in the press of the day. His obituary noted his \"stentorian voice, and the ability with which he kept very large companies in order\"\n\nWilliam Kingsmith was the first to wear the red coat now associated with London society of Toastmasters, as he wanted to be distinguished from waitstaff and footmen. He was the public announcer at the 1908 London Olympic games, and presided over court functions at St. James's Palace, ceremonies at the House of Commons and Royal Albert Hall,\n\nA widely known person associated with this role was George Jessel, known in his lifetime as \"Toastmaster General of the United States\" (parodying the title Postmaster General of the United States).\n\nIn many service organizations and businesses, the role of toastmaster was a permanently assigned role, but often rotating among members. Toastmasters were largely expected to keep the event from becoming boring, and a cottage industry arose in the middle century to cater to the desire of businessmen and other leaders to overcome the fear of public speaking. Would-be toastmasters were typically counseled to use light humor, and to have anecdotes and epigrams handily memorized. Toastmasters International is an organization dedicated to helping people in public speaking and in fulfilling the role of toastmaster.\n\nSuch was the importance of a toastmaster remaining sober in order to conduct events, he may have had a special cup, called the toastmaster's glass which, although of the same size and shape as others at the event, in fact was of much lower capacity due to an almost solid interior. Several such glasses are now displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5693538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5693538", "title": "Tommy Bartlett", "text": "Tommy Bartlett\n\nThomson \"Tommy\" Bartlett (July 11, 1914 – September 6, 1998) was an American showman and entertainment mogul from Wisconsin. He is most often associated with the water skiing thrill show based in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, known as Tommy Bartlett's Thrill Show. The success of this and other traveling water ski shows led to Bartlett's induction into the Water Ski Hall of Fame in 1993. His shows have toured the United States, the Far East, and four World Fairs, and have seen 50 million spectators.\n\nBorn in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Bartlett began his career in entertainment by becoming a broadcaster at radio station WISN at the young age of 13. After moving to Chicago, Illinois, he became a staff announcer at the CBS-owned WBBM radio station. He continued here until the outbreak of World War II, when he learned to fly and subsequently became a flight instructor for the United States Army Air Corps. In 1945, he returned to radio, hosting a show called \"Meet Tommy Bartlett.\" In 1947, he hosted the \"Tommy Bartlett Show\" and \"Welcome Travelers\".\n\nDuring his WBBM tenure, Bartlett was popular as host of two transcribed daily shows catering to housewives, \"Meet the Missus\" and \"The Missus Goes to Market\". Both shows would become the top-rated local daytime radio shows in the Chicago market, and were sponsored by Fitzpatrick Brothers, manufacturers of Kitchen Klenzer, Big Jack Soap and Automatic Soap Flakes.\n\nIn 1949, Bartlett went to the Chicago Railroad Fair, where he witnessed a water skiing show on the Chicago lakefront. After seeing several more such shows over the course of the fair, Bartlett decided to create and produce his own traveling water ski show using surplus equipment that he bought from the performers. The \"Tommy Bartlett Water Ski & Jumping Boat Thrill Show\", as it was first called, was highly successful. In 1953, after the show called at Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, Bartlett was asked by the local Chamber of Commerce to keep the show in the city permanently. Bartlett agreed to the request, keeping one arm of the show at Wisconsin Dells for daily performances on Lake Delton, while four additional road groups continued touring in cities across the United States. The success of the shows led the United Service Organizations (USO) to ask Bartlett to send the show overseas to entertain U.S. soldiers in the Far East, launching a branch of the tour in Asia. Bartlett had a long-term partnership with motor manufacturer Mercury Marine's owner Carl Kiekhaefer.\n\nThrough his show, Bartlett has been credited both with popularizing water skiing from a smalltime hobby to a major sport, and with the establishment of Wisconsin Dells as a tourist mecca. He is credited with introducing colorful costumes, and establishing themes for \"dancing water\", jumping boats, night shows, Polynesian dancers, show ski jumping, and skydivers. Bartlett's Wisconsin Dells show offered bumper stickers for its visitors to put on their cars, thus becoming advertisements for the show and the city across the nation, especially so in the Chicago metropolitan area. In addition to his water ski show, Bartlett invested in other tourist attractions in Wisconsin Dells, building \"Tommy Bartlett's Robot World\", a hands-on science museum, in the 1970s. The attraction is now known as the Tommy Bartlett Exploratory. \n\nBartlett also continued his career in broadcasting while both his ski show and Wisconsin Dells ventures were ongoing. He was an announcer at the Calgary Stampede from 1966 to 1992, as well as at the 1988 Winter Olympics. Bartlett's widespread ventures in the entertainment industry led him to become very wealthy. In 1997, Bartlett purchased one of three spare core modules for the space station Mir from a Moscow museum. The object is now the centerpiece of the Tommy Bartlett Exploratory in Wisconsin Dells. It was used as a backdrop by CNN while the network reported on Mir's re-entry to the atmosphere in 2001.\n\nBartlett was inducted into the Water Ski Hall of Fame in 1993 for his contributions to promoting the sport, despite having only water skied once in his life, on his seventieth birthday in 1984. He was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 2003.\n\nOn September 6, 1998, Bartlett died of kidney failure at the age of 84. His name, however, lives on in the Tommy Bartlett Show and Tommy Bartlett Exploratory, which each continue to entertain thousands of visitors every year.\n\n"}

The course is a half mile (800 m) from start to finish. The race features brightly coloured giant pumpkins as the sole means of flotation.\n\nThe race was founded in 1999 by Danny Dill, son of Howard Dill, breeder of the Atlantic Giant pumpkin.\n\nLeo Swinamer of New Ross, Nova Scotia has dominated the competition, winning six out of the first ten races, including one at the age of 73. Despite his dominance, the race's popularity continues to grow, with 10,000 spectators and 60 entries in the 2008 race.\n\nThere are three classes: motor, experimental and paddling. Not all classes attract competitors each year. The paddling class is the best known and most popular in terms of entries.\n\nThe race gained a degree of notability in 2005 when Martha Stewart announced her intention to participate. While her pastel-coloured pumpkin did appear in the race, Ms Stewart could not participate as permission to enter Canada was delayed after her release from incarceration in the ImClone affair; when permission was finally granted, weather prevented her from reaching Nova Scotia on time. Various other celebrity participants have raced, notably local member of parliament Scott Brison, who has appeared in several of the races.\n\nWindsor was not the first to feature a giant pumpkin as a water-borne craft.

There were 26 tables at launch (available separately as premium DLC) each of which are available as a free trial (though packs like \"Marvel Pinball: Vengeance\" and \"Virtue\" will still have to be bought as a whole). Users who purchase a pinball table on one Sony console are able to play it for free on the other.\n\n\nThe game has a score of 85% on Metacritic.\n\n"}
