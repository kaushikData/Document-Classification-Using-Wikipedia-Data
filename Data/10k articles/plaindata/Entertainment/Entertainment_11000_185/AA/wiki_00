{"id": "8407529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8407529", "title": "14 Carrot Rabbit", "text": "14 Carrot Rabbit\n\n14 Carrot Rabbit is an animated cartoon short in the \"Looney Tunes\" series featuring Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam (here as Chillicothe Sam), directed by Friz Freleng and first released March 15, 1952. The title is a play on \"14 karat\", as in a purity level for gold.\n\nThe basic plot of \"14 Carrot Rabbit\" takes place during the gold rush in The Klondike, Yukon (\"where men were men and women were women...a darn good arrangement\"), and centers on Yosemite Sam (here as Chilkoot Sam) who steals other people's gold. The story begins with an old man named Louie slouching over by a river to clean the gold he found in a pan. Sam suddenly appears, uses his gun and reputation to scare him away, and claims the gold. When he sees how little he has stolen from old Louie, he says \"Picking's mighty slim around here, hardly no reward for a day's work,\" even though he did not work for it. Sam later takes the gold to a shop called \"Next to Last Chance Saloon\" to trade them for money. After the weigh-up, Sam is furious to find out that Pierre can offer only $10 for the gold. \n\nWhile Sam complains about the result (\"It's getting so a man can't earn a dishonest living!\"), Bugs Bunny wobbles into the shop with another gigantic piece of gold to trade in. (Being a rabbit, he welcomes carrots in lieu of cash.) When Bugs leaves, Sam asks Pierre for the secret of Bugs' success. Pierre tells Sam that Bugs always gets a \"funny feeling\" when he's near gold.\n\nWith this information, Sam goes to find Bugs...whom he indeed observes get the \"funny feeling\". Bugs digs up a lost collar button. Sam then decides to ask Bugs to be his partner; if Bugs can locate the gold, Sam will dig it up and split it with the rabbit in a 50/50 deal. Bugs stares back at the camera and wiggles his eyebrows with a smirk, knowing that Sam cannot be trusted. Despite this, Bugs plays along...asking if he can actually afford to take Sam up on his offer. The claim-jumper advertises himself as \"Square-deal Sam\". They stroll along together when Bugs indicates he's found gold. Bugs points out the spot to Sam, who proceeds to dig...and abruptly dissolves his partnership with Bugs. The double-crossed Bugs notices that Sam is about to dig right through a cliff and into a lake hundreds of feet down. Sam ignores Bugs' warning (thus clearing the rabbit's conscience), digs through the cliff and plummets into the lake. \n\nSoon afterwards, Bugs goes downhill and proceeds to dig when Sam shows up again. Sam accuses Bugs of trying to get the gold for himself (talk about calling the kettle black!); he grabs Bugs' shovel, hypocritically complaining \"That's what I get for trusting a rabbit\". As the thief digs ever deeper, it turns out he's in a loaded dump truck driven by Bugs! The rabbit drives his truck to a cliff and empties its load over the edge. Sam keeps digging until he finds himself on the bottom of a falling soil pile (\"Great horny toads! I must've dug clean through to Chinee!\"). The thief's fall is broken by hard ground.\n\nEnraged, Sam vows to chase Bugs through every state in the Union...and literally does, until the rabbit suddenly has another \"funny\" moment. Sam's efforts to resist the gold-digging infatuation are in vain; he digs and indeed finds tons of gold. (\"I'm a zillionaire!\" he gloats.) Tragically, it turns out that Sam has been digging up the United States Gold Reserve in Fort Knox, Kentucky. He is hauled off to the stockade by a couple of MPs, while Bugs bids him farewell (\"See you in 20 years, Sam!\"). Then a third MP asks Bugs what \"he's\" doing here; Bugs nervously explains that he's waiting for a streetcar. At that moment, inexplicably, an ocean liner appears on the scene (despite there being no water in the vicinity). Bugs isn't stymied, however: \"In a spot like this, a boat will do!\" With that, he rushes aboard to make his getaway.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18359721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18359721", "title": "Animated documentary", "text": "Animated documentary\n\nThe animated documentary is a genre of film which combines animation and documentary. This genre should not be confused with documentaries about movie and TV animation history that feature excerpts.\n\nThe first recognized example of this genre is Winsor McCay's 1918 12-minute-long film \"The Sinking of the Lusitania\", which uses animation to portray the 1915 sinking of after it was struck by two torpedoes launched by a German U-boat; an event of which no recorded film footage is known to exist. \nSince the 1920s, animation has been used in educational and social guidance films, and has often been used to illustrate abstract concepts in mainly live-action examples of these genres. Early examples of fully animated educational films are \"The Einstein Theory of Relativity\" (1923) and \"Evolution\" (1925) by Max and Dave Fleischer. Walt Disney used it in films such as \"Victory Through Air Power\" (1943), \"How to Catch a Cold\" (1951) and \"Our Friend the Atom\" (1957).\n\nIn 1953, Norman McLaren's \"Neighbours\" won the Academy Awards for Best Documentary (Short Subject). The award is somewhat considered a mistake, but the fact that it was not only indicated into that category, but also won, shows that, somehow, the animated images spoke to the judges almost like a documentary.\n\n\"Of Stars and Men\", a 1964 animated feature by John Hubley which tells of humankind's quest to find its place in the universe, won an award in the documentary category at the San Francisco Film Festival.\n\nMosaic Films promoted the use of animated documentaries in the United Kingdom in 2003 with the award-winning series \"Animated Minds\". Commissioned by Channel 4 and directed by Andy Glynne, it uses real testimony from survivors of mental illness, combined with engaging visuals, to climb inside the minds of the mentally distressed. The first series won the award for Best Animation at the Banff World Media Festival (2004).\n\nThe 2007 International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam featured a programme of \"documentaries that partly or completely consist of animation\". In the article written to accompany the event, Kees Driessen talked about the \"least controversial\" form of the genre; the \"illustrated radio documentary\", citing Aardman Animation's 1987 film \"Lip Synch: Going Equipped\" (directed by Peter Lord) as an example. One of the most consistent creators of this form of animated documentary today is Paul Fierlinger. His films from the late 1980s-onward typically feature recordings of people talking about certain topics in their lives (such as alcohol abuse or loneliness), accompanied by Fierlinger's animation which mainly illustrates the stories in a realistic way. This is a contrast from films and series such as Aardman's \"Creature Comforts\", which recontextualise such audio recordings by combining them with more fanciful, non-realistic animated interpretations.\n\nFierlinger's 1995 animated feature-length autobiography \"Drawn from Memory\", in which he is the main subject as well as the director, voice actor and only animator , was also called a documentary by Driessen. This technique of animating interviews has also been used by other filmmakers, such as Chris Landreth in his Oscar-winning 2004 short film \"Ryan\" (mainly based on an interview done with animator Ryan Larkin) and Jonas Odell in the 2006 Swedish film \"Aldrig som första gången!\" (\"Never Like the First Time!\", consisting of animated segments of people's descriptions of their first time engaging in sex). The film \"Chicago 10\", about the Chicago Seven incident, received some acclaim for recreating courtroom scenes using animation. Another documentary with animated elements is the German film Neukölln Unlimited, which uses animation to depict past traumas of its protagonists.\n\nThe Oscar-nominated 2008 Israeli film \"Waltz with Bashir\" was advertised as being the first feature-length animated documentary. \n\nSome animated documentaries that were nominated or won for Oscars are \"So Much for So Little\" (1949) , \"Sunrise Over Tiananmen Square\" (1998) , \"\" (2005), \"I Met the Walrus\" (2007) and \"Last Day of Freedom\" (2015). \n\n"}
{"id": "6244105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6244105", "title": "Ashton Lane", "text": "Ashton Lane\n\nAshton Lane is a cobbled backstreet in the West End of Glasgow. It is connected to Byres Road by a short linking lane beside Hillhead subway station and is noted for its bars, restaurants and a licensed cinema.\nThe Lane was not always the focus of West End cafe society. By the early 1970s, it was a run-down area of small residential and empty commercial properties. However, in 1976, the cost to renew the lease on the cramped property in Ruthven Lane that housed the Ubiquitous Chip restaurant forced the owner to look for new premises. 'The Chip', as it is locally known, moved to its current location in a derelict property that had been the stables for a funeral undertaker. The move was a gamble for the owner, Ronnie Clydesdale, since the Lane was a backwater to the thriving Byres Rd but in 1977 the Glasgow Subway closed for a major refurbishment. This forced several small businesses to relocate from Byres Rd and the then-famous Grosvenor Cafe followed The Chip into Ashton Lane.\n\nOther bars and restaurants were opened: the Cul-de-Sac creperie in the former Barr and Stroud factory and Bar Brel in the old coachhouse that had been used latterly as a landscape gardener's yard but was, in 1910, the chauffeur’s house and garage for Dr Marion Gilchrist’s 'prim dark green Wolseley landaulette'. Dr Gilchrist (1864-1952) was, in 1894, the first woman to graduate in medicine in Scotland.\n\nThe Grosvenor Picture Theatre was built on site of Henderson’s Cab and Funeral Office in Byres Road and Ashton Lane. The cinema opened on 3 May 1921 with 'Helen of the Four Gates' and 'Eastwards Ho' and the performances were accompanied by the theatre’s own orchestra and organist. The building was designed by architects Gardner & Glen and had a distinctive terracotta façade. The original entrance faced Byres Road and the upper level housed a Café and American Soda Fountain and, by 1929, a waiting room. The original cinema seated around 1,350 people, but in the 1970s it underwent considerable reconstruction. The entrance was moved from Byres Rd to Ashton Lane, and the old entrance became Bonham's Wine Bar (the railing in the original foyer is retained in the upstairs bar). After falling into disrepair, the cinema closed 30 June 2002, but was relaunched in October 2003 after a multimillion-pound refurbishment. This created two screens on the ground floor, a bar and restaurant in the former neglected roof space and a new cafe/bar on Ashton Lane. The cinema now has two screens, each seating a hundred people and shows a mix of blockbuster and art-house movies. \n\nToday, bars and restaurants occupy most of the premises in Ashton Lane. The Famous Grosvenor Cafe and the now internationally renowned 'Chip' remain a defining feature. Some like Jinty McGuintys Irish Bar have been there a while too, almost 25 years.\n\nAshton Lane continues north as Cresswell Lane, where the variety of bars and restaurants is supplemented by a gallery of small specialist shops. The Lane and its surroundings might then be regarded as Glasgow's equivalent of Dublin's Temple Bar area or Edinburgh's Rose Street. While still popular with local residents and students, it is now firmly established on the Glasgow tourist trail.\n"}
{"id": "3767091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3767091", "title": "Australian rules football in Sweden", "text": "Australian rules football in Sweden\n\nAustralian rules football has been played in Sweden since 1993, with the game currently played in Helsingborg, Malmö, Lund, Stockholm, Gothenburg, Karlstad, Falun, Norrtälje and Uppsala. A national governing body was formed in 2007 under the name \"Svenska Australisk Fotbollsförbundet\" or \"AFL Sweden\".\n\nAustralian rules football began in Sweden in late 1993 with the creation of the Helsingborg Saints for play in the Danish Australian Football League. They continued as the only Australian rules club in Sweden (excepting the short-lived Lund Bulldogs in 1995) until 2002, when the DAFL was restructured and the Saints were divided into three new clubs, the Port Malmö Maulers, Helsingborg West Raptors and Lund Magpies. After 2005, the three Scania teams became feeders for the South Sweden Saints (changed name back to Helsingborg Saints in 2008), who competed in the DAFL Premier League and reached the 2005 Grand Final.\n\nIn 2003 a new club was formed, the Göteborg Berserkers, followed by the Stockholm Dynamite in 2004. The three centres for footy in Sweden continued to operate largely independently of each other, with the Dynamite creating its own three team local league, the Stockholm region Australian Football Federation.\n\nA loose federation calling itself the Swedish Australian Football Association was created, but no real governing body was created until late 2007. The announcement of the creation of the Swedish Australian Football League in 2006 comprises the Scania and Gothenburg clubs, the Stockholm teams remaining separate in the SAFF.\n\nAFLSweden is the official governing body of Australian rules football in Sweden.\n\nWith AFL Sweden working towards being recognised as a sport in Sweden and inclusion into the Swedish 'Riksidrottsförbundet' in 2017, plans were made to expand footy within the country. Part of those plans was the creation of a national competition or the 'Elitserien'. In 2015 the first Elitserien tournament was held over 6 rounds with 4 competing teams: Port Malmö Maulers, Helsingborg Saints, Södermalm Blues and Stockholm Dynamite (Dynamite team composed of players from Solna, Årsta, Bromma and Norrtälje). Each team hosted a double header round as well as a regional derby match. Södermalm Blues, the team with the best record after 6 rounds, were crowned champions.\n\nThe Stockholm Dynamite has competed against the South Sweden Saints (aka Scania Griffins) at least once a year to date since 2004. The Southerners won the first cup in 2004 (surprisingly considering they were thrashed in a practice game earlier in the year) and defended it successfully in 2005. The E4 Cup is named for the E4 motorway connecting the capital with the country's south. This cup has now been replaced by the SAFL regional league.\n\nThe Swedish national team is nicknamed the Elks, drawn from teams across Sweden.\n\nThe team wears the national colours of Sweden (represented on the Flag of Sweden). The Elks have worn two different jumpers in international competition, their first being a yellow jumper with a blue V featuring three gold crowns and the Swedish name for Sweden (Sverige) on the belly, and their second being a blue jumper with a yellow Scandinavian cross and Elk logo.\n\nThe first appearance of a Swedish national team was in 1997, when the Elks were defeated by Denmark's Vikings in Helsingborg. The next Elks match was in 2004, when the Elks defeated the touring North London Lions by 11 points at Malmö. In 2005, the first test match between Sweden and Denmark is some time was held at Farum, Denmark, with the game played out as a draw. This match consisted of an all-Danish Vikings side, although the Sweden side contained a number of Australians.\n\nAt the 2007 EU Cup in Hamburg, Sweden performed very well, eventually winning the tournament. The Elks thrashed Austria by over 100 points in their first group match, then beat France by 41 points to top Pool C. In the Quarter-Finals, Sweden defeated Pool B runners up the Czech Republic by 31 points. In the Semi Finals, they met Pool B champions England. The Swedes ran out 26 point winners, moving onto the final where they would play hosts Germany. In the Final, Sweden won 14.9.93 to Germany 8.5.53. Sweden's Cameron Crooks was Best on Ground.\n\nStrong growth in the Swedish league has the Elks sent a squad to the 2008 Australian Football International Cup.\n\nThe Swedish Regional League began in 2007, featuring three sides representing the most established regions for Australian rules in Sweden, the Gothenburg Berserkers, Scania Griffins and Stockholm Dynamite.\n\nThe Göteborg Berserkers are currently the only Australian rules team in Gothenburg. The Berserkers started training in 2003 and had their first seven-a-side game in late 2003. In 2006, the Berserkers started playing against the Landskrona Bulldozers and Port Malmö Maulers in the Southern Sweden Regional League. The Berserkers wear a black and white striped long sleeve jumper (same as Collingwood Magpies) or a black-red sleeveless jumper. As of 2007, they are competing against Stockholm and Scania in the national regional series.\n\nScania currently has two teams in the Danish Australian Football League (DAFL) , the Port Malmö Maulers from Malmö and Helsingborg Saints based in Helsingborg. Feeding into these sides is the four-team Scania League (Skåneligan), featuring the GV Rebels and Malmö Red Eyes in Malmö, Helsingborg West Raptors in Helsingborg and Landskrona Bulldozers representing Landskrona and Lund. The Lund Magpies also competed in the Scania League from 2003–06, former players joining the Bulldozers after the Magpies folded.\n\nThe regional representative side is nicknamed the Griffins.\n\nScania was home to the first Australian football club ever formed in Sweden, the Helsingborg Saints. The club was founded in 1993 by Ingmar 'Terry' Lundquist and Joacim Aulin. The club was almost to be called the Ravens, but the nickname and playing strip of Australian Football League (AFL) club the St Kilda Saints eventually were adopted. From 1994 onwards the Saints competed in the DAFL, and were briefly called South Sweden Saints from 2003–2007. There was also a short-lived club in Lund, nicknamed the Bulldogs, 1995.\n\nFor the years 2003 and 2004, the Helsingborg Saints split their squad into three teams for the DAFL's new Scania Conference, these being the Helsingborg West Raptors, Lund Magpies and the Port Malmö Maulers. During this period, the Saints played as Scania in the DAFL's regional league, being a representative team made up of the best players from the three Scanian clubs.\n\nIn the 2005 structure for the DAFL the Saints returned, now called the South Sweden Saints and playing in the DAFL Premier League. This season saw the Saints reach the DAFL Grand Final for the second time, again they were soundly defeated by the Farum Cats.\n\nThe Port Malmö Maulers were formed in 2003, to play in the Scania Conference of the DAFL. As of the 2005 DAFL restructure, the Maulers are a feeder team for the South Sweden Saints (now called Helsingborg Saints again), who play in the DAFL Premier League. In 2006, with the creation of the Swedish Australian Football League, the Maulers competed in the Southern Sweden regional league, against the Landskrona Bulldozers and the Göteborg Berserkers, and also field two sides in the new Scania league, the Malmö Red Eyes and the GV Malmö Rebels (named for their partner league the Goulburn Valley Football League in Australia. As of 2007, the Port Malmö Maulers compete in the DAFL Premier League. In 2009, they became the first team from outside the Copenhagen area to win the DAFL premiership.\n\nAustralian rules football in the Stockholm region is governed by the Stockholm region Australian Football Federation (SAFF). The SAFF runs a five-team suburban competition featuring the Bromma Vikings, Solna Axemen, Södermalm Blues, Norrtälje Dockers and Årsta Swans, with a representative team known as the Stockholm Dynamite. The Falun Diggers participated in the 2011 competition but sat out 2012. Players from the SAFF are also eligible for selection to the Swedish national team.\n\nAfter earlier attempts to start the game of Australian Rules in Stockholm, the first meeting of what was to become the SAFF was held on the December 19, 2003.\n\nEarly in April 2004 the Stockholm Dynamite (the new representative side for the SAFF) traveled to Malmö and won a resounding victory in their premier game against a rather depleted South Sweden Saints side. Six weeks later the Dynamite accepted an invitation to play a full-strength team in Helsingborg for the inaugural E4 Cup (named after the major freeway between Stockholm and the south). The match resulted in a four-point win to South Sweden.\n\nIn Stockholm a three-team league was established, teams being North, South and Central. After each team completed nine home-and-away games, North defeated Central in the 2004 Grand Final. The Dynamite also travelled to Denmark for the Sheep Station Cup and played an International Rules game against a local Gaelic football club.\n\nIn 2005, the Stockholm Australian Football Federation completed its second year. The senior competition again maintained the same three-team, nine-a-side competition, the sides now named the Northern Axemen, Central Royals and Southern Sharks. The Sharks defeated the Axemen for the premiership.\n\nIn the eighteen-a-side version of the game, 2005 was a learning curve for the Stockholm Dynamite. The West London Wildcats toured Stockholm in early April, defeating the locals by a good margin.\n\nIn the E4 Cup, the South Sweden Saints made the long trek to Stockholm. The Saints proved too strong and controlled the game from the outset. Again there were many encouraging signs with the local players making up 40% of the Stockholm Team. The Dynamite again ventured to Denmark for the Sheep Station Cup, finishing fourth.\n\nWith the completion of the 2005 senior competition in September, the SAFF turned its focus to junior development. The SAFF hired a professionally accredited physical education teacher and primary school teacher to co-ordinate Australian Rules Clinics at a number of Swedish schools. The sessions were aimed at children aged 10–16 and were based primarily upon the Auskick program. In all, four schools were involved over 38 hours of clinics and 350 children got the opportunity to kick the Sherrin.\n\nThe game of Australian rules football has grown steadily in Stockholm over the past few years with a marked increase in local Swedish players.\n\n2007 saw the formation of three new clubs in middle Sweden, based in the cities of Karlstad, Uppsala and Falun.\n\nThe AFL International Census in 2007 reported a total of 393 players in Sweden, of which 257 were senior, 58 junior and around 78 participants registered in the \"Viking footy\" Auskick like program.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7975239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7975239", "title": "Chicago film industry", "text": "Chicago film industry\n\nThe Chicago film industry is a central hub for motion picture production and exhibition that was established before Hollywood became the undisputed capital of film making. In the early 1900s, Chicago boasted the greatest number of production companies and filmmakers. Essanay Studios founded by George K. Spoor was one of the earliest successful studios to produce movies in Chicago, employing stars such as Charlie Chaplin and Gloria Swanson. Actor and co-founder of Essanay Studios, Broncho Billy Anderson gave birth to the western genre. Early film companies such as Essanay Studios produced multiple silent films every week and rented viewing equipment to showcase the latest cinematography to the public. This rental culture gave birth to the popularity of Nickelodeons up until the Great Depression. However, due to the high demand for motion pictures during this time, a black market for films and equipment developed. The Motion Picture Patents Company, established in 1909 as a conglomerate of the major studios, sought to eliminate all illegal use of patented film equipment. As a result, independent ventures entered the film scene. Independents drove the film industry to the west to avoid legal trouble with the trust of major film companies united under the Motion Picture Patents Company. The west offered fairer weather and scenery that better accommodated film making. Not until the 1980s and early 21st century has Chicago experienced a film production revival. Blockbusters, such as \"Blues Brothers\", \"Sixteen Candles\", and \"The Dark Knight\", have rejuvenated the Chicago film scene. In the 21st century, Chicago further experienced a film revival due to a tax bill the state of Illinois passed to give filmmakers a 30% tax break on production costs.\n\nEssanay Studios was a Chicago pioneer film company established in 1907 by George K. Spoor and Broncho Billy Anderson. Originally named the Peerless Film Manufacturing Company, Spoor and Anderson changed the name to Essanay by combining the first two letters of their surnames. Located on the north side on Argyle Street in Chicago, the firm grew to one of the largest film companies in the world before the rise of Hollywood.\n\nThe success of Essanay Studio was based on Spoor's and Anderson's appetite for innovation. Spoor was intrigued by Edison's Kinetoscope at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition but thought the invention could be improved. Armed with a vision, Spoor created the Magniscope, which allowed films to be projected onto flat surfaces. Spoor and Anderson installed, operated, and rented the Magniscope to many theaters around Chicago. The Magniscope innovation would eventually create legal battles between Essanay and the Edison Company and end up with the creation of the Motion Picture Patents Company. Anderson's film prowess came from on-screen achievement. He acted in the production of \"The Great Train Robbery\",and became one of the first western stars. His nickname became, \"Broncho Billy\", for his involvement with western films. Due to his love for westerns, Anderson convinced Spoor to establish Essanay branches in Boulder, Colorado and Fremont California. These locations were perfect, especially the California location, because of the steady climate and mountainous landscape.\n\nEssanay Studios in Chicago was the capital of Chicago film in the first decades of the 1900s. Charlie Chaplin started his career in 1915 at Essanay Studios. He was hired in 1915 and paid $1,250.00 per week. Chaplin improvised the scripts that were given to him by adding slapstick humor. Ben Turpin, fellow actor for Essanay, and Chaplin worked together on slapstick projects. Turpin was cross-eyed which made him a natural sidekick to the antics of Chaplin. Chaplin's only full feature production at Essanay was called \"His New Job\". Another notable actress who found a beginning at Essanay Studio was Gloria Swanson. Swanson would later star in many television and film productions including the smash hit Sunset Boulevard.\n\nDespite booming success under Charlie Chaplin, Essanay Studios soon faced a downturn. Chaplin did not like Chicago due to unpredictable weather conditions. After only one month of work, Chaplin left Chicago to head west. Spoor and Anderson soon hired French comedian, Max Linder, to take the role of Chaplin. Linder's rye humor was not appreciated by the Chicago audiences. The company suffered economically due to the inability to produce a popular film. In 1918 George Kleine purchased the studio to form a merger between Vitagraph, Lubin, Selig, and Essanay known as V-L-S-E, Incorporated which would eventually absorbed by Warner Brothers. The Essanay location would eventually be taken over by industrial film producer, Norman Wilding. Currently, the remnants of the studio are part of St. Augustine's College which built a Charlie Chaplin memorial theater on site.\n\nThe rise of the Chicago film industry in the early 1900s was a product of technological advancement marked by political strategy. In 1889, Thomas Edison and William Dickson patented the Kinetoscope. The Kinetoscope allowed a single viewer to watch a film reel through a small window. At this time, Edison did not see any practical value to the Kinetoscope and dismissed the invention as a toy. However, aspiring filmmakers began designing and patenting similar projection machines around the Kinetoscope that allowed a film to be shown to a large audience. William Selig and George K. Spoor of Essanay Studios in Chicago, the Biograph Company, and Vitagraph Company all improvised Edison's work. Film companies of this time period customarily both created movies and established a means of viewing.\n\nDespite initial ignorance to the Kinetoscope, the Edison Manufacturing Company responded to this innovation with legal action. According to the company, film outfits were showing motion pictures illegally because each of the improvised projectors violated the Kinetoscope patent. However, each film outfit had its own patent protection connected with individual innovations. Concurrent formation of a black market for projection equipment exacerbated legal issues. Following legal proceedings, the Motion Picture Patents Company was established on January 1, 1909. This coalition established a trust of the major film outfits in the United States. Firms from Chicago included in the Motion Picture Patents Company were the Vitagraph Company, the Selig Polyscope Company, the Kleine Company, and Essanay Studios. Provisions restricted movie making to these licensed firms. The trust also required outfits to pay the Edison Company royalties for use of the improvised projection equipment. To snuff out competitors, a rental system was put in place. Individuals operating theaters were now required to pay a $2 per week rental for films and projection equipment.\n\nExhibitors and filmmakers who refused to pay the newly instituted fees were not stopped by this new legislation. Independent companies were formed outside of this trust almost immediately. Max Lewis, president of the Chicago Film Exchange, announced he would not comply with the $10 monthly licensing fee on projectors. Within 48 hours of the formation of the MPPC, a Chicago-based combine of independents, the International Projecting and Producing Company (IPPC), formed to counter the MPPC's stranglehold. The IPPC, headed by the John J. Murdoch, general manager of the Western Vaudeville Managers' Association, dramatically announced the firm's formation with a $2 million base in the Feb. 6, 1909, issue of \"Show World\" magazine.\n\nIndividuals risked their own livelihood by operating independently. The major companies in the trust could sue any of these firms for violation of patent rights.\n\nChicago became a leader in motion pictures with innovative trailblazers and an interested public. In 1907, Chicago had more theaters per capita than any other city in the United States. Nickelodeons or five-cent theaters became extremely popular with the number of venues growing each year until the Great Depression. These theaters quenched the public's thirst for film and created solid neighborhood relations.\n\nRevolutionary in Chicago's film industry was the establishment of rental houses or film exchanges; in 1907, Chicago had more than 15 film exchange houses, such as The Stereopticon & Film Exchange, William Swanson & Company, Chicago Projecting Company, and the International Projecting and Producing Company, formed by JJ Murdoch as an independent Chicago-based exchange. These rental houses allowed exhibitors to borrow films at a reduced cost than actually purchasing them. This movement revolutionized motion picture viewership. It allowed patrons access to a wide array of films. The average viewer could now experience a variety of film disciplines for a small consumer cost. Rental houses also enabled theaters to change films frequently, keeping the film consumer interested. Chicago quickly became the leading film distribution market in the entire United States with control of 80% of the market in the early 1900s.\n\nMovie production also boomed. Production companies, like the Essanay Studios and the Selig Polyscope Company, dominated the film landscape. These two firms employed hundreds of people and churned out hundreds of films every year. Filmmakers shot their films outdoors due to the need for ample lighting with the primitive camera equipment. Sets took up entire city blocks at a time. The banks of the Chicago River were often used as a set for the westerns Anderson trademarked. Motion pictures were valued differently in the early era of film. Modern films are highly valued with vast amounts of resources being poured into the production value. In the early 1900s, films were viewed as products with a studio releasing multiple films per week.\n\nThe Chicago film industry met decline for a combination of reasons. The Motion Picture Patents Company, established to protect the major players in the industry, actually promoted the birth of independent ventures. These ventures sought to circumvent payment to the companies united under the Motion Picture Patents Company trust. Independent firms granted creative license to the actor and often competed with the major firms despite the significantly lower budget. To avoid litigation by the Motion Picture Patents Company for patent violation, many independent firms moved west, literally out of the reach of the major production companies.\n\nIn addition to the avoidance of legal trouble, California was perfect for film making in other respects as well. Weather was notably milder compared to the unpredictability of Chicago's climate. This enabled production to move at a steady pace with greater consistency. The scenery of the west also attracted many production companies. California is made up of a diverse landscape of natural settings while Chicago offered a monotone set of plains. Filmmakers followed in the footsteps of G.M. Anderson with the desire to film westerns within the natural mountainous habitat.\n\nDespite the transition from Chicago to Hollywood in the 1920s, Chicago remained on the map. Citizens retained an insatiable appetite for motion pictures, even though production had left the city. Chicago boasted the largest chain of theaters during the studio era (1919–1952). The Balaban and Katz chain, once small west-side exhibitors, bloomed their business into a citywide phenomena. Balaban and Katz owned movie and stage palaces such as the Chicago Theatre, Ford Center for the Performing Arts Oriental Theatre, and Balaban and Katz Uptown Theatre. High-profile film companies such as MGM, Columbia Pictures, Warner Brothers, Republic, Universal, RKO, and Paramount all held offices in Chicago.\n\nMovie production again entered Chicago in the 1980 with the state of Illinois becoming a leader in money spent on film production. Notable films from the 1980s include \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Color of Money, Risky Business, The Untouchables, Planes, Trains and Automobiles\", and \"When Harry Met Sally.\" Feature film directors returned to the city including Dan Aykroyd and the Belushi family (\"Blues Brothers, About Last Night\", and \"Blues Brothers 2000\"), John Hughes (\"Sixteen Candles\" and \"The Breakfast Club\"), and Andrew Davis (\"The Fugitive\" and \"Chain Reaction\").\n\nChicago further fostered its new production boom with the passage of an Illinois bill in 2009. This bill provides a 30% tax credit on all production costs within the state of Illinois. Since instituting this law in 2009, many filmmakers have committed to Chicago for production. Recent films with Chicago as a filming location include \"\", \"Contagion\", and \"Source Code\". The new bill is supposed to benefit Chicago with increased tax revenue from $70 million in 2009 to $100 million in 2010.\n\n\n"}

Directed in 1937 by the deacon Philippe Raberojo, it marked the centenary of the death of the Protestant martyr Rafaravavy Rasalama. Philippe Raberojo was the president of an association of French citizens of Malagasy origin, where he had access to a 9,5mm camera. Thus he was able to realise his film. The complete version is lost.\n\nIn the following years Madagascar was crisis-shaken by several political overthrows. In 1960 Madagascar regained its independence, but still suffers from political instability. This complicated post-colonial period not only led to the closure or transformation of the country's cinemas into places of religious worship. Also almost the whole film industry was razed to the ground. Till today still there is no public cinema in Madagascar.\n\nThe film industry started to recover slowly around the year 2006 also due to the founding of Rencontres du Film Court Madagascar (RFC).

It consists primarily of two series, \"Red Panda Adventures\" and \"Black Jack Justice\", both of which are done in the style of old-time radio, and are released on alternating weeks.\n\nThe group was first formed in 1999 by the actor-writer Gregg Taylor for a six-part mini-series take on the adventure programs of 1940s radio. (See “Original Red Panda mini-series” below). The programs were created as a pilot project for traditional broadcast, and were quite broad and silly in the belief that a comic approach might broaden their commercial potential. They were never broadcast.\n\nTaylor's next project returned to the theatre, and was also radio-based, leading him to keep using the “Decoder Ring” name. The original \"Black Jack Justice\" was a one-act farce about a very, very bad day in the life of an old-time detective radio series. The show was a great success at the 2001 Toronto Fringe Festival, and led Taylor to continue under the Decoder Ring Theatre title. The next year the company returned to the Fringe with \"Prometheus Unplugged\", a comic take on the Promethean legends in which Mankind returns to Prometheus' mountain to inform God that he does not exist. Needless to say, God was less than thrilled.\n\nThe company was officially incorporated that year, and began a series of comic murder-mysteries to raise revenue for future projects. The series included \"Murder Most Deadly\", \"Death on the Avon\" and \"The Case of the Cockeyed Cupid\". It was at this point that the company launched the first version of its website, decoderringtheatre.com, and included MP3 versions of the almost-forgotten \"Red Panda\" mini-series. Soon it was receiving -email from all over the world asking for more, and Taylor began the long process of accumulating scripts, equipment and performers for an ongoing podcast audio drama series.\n\nA new, completely re-invented \"Red Panda\" continuity was launched as \"The Red Panda Adventures\", losing the parody and playing much straighter to the conventions of old-time radio and comic books. The eponymous play-within-a-play from \"Black Jack Justice\" was revived, with its battling central characters, and launched as a sister show. On October 15, 2005, Decoder Ring Theatre officially left behind the greasepaint and empty chairs of the theatre for the Internet.\n\nIn 2006, the podcast was nominated for a Parsec Awards for Best Audio Drama (short), specifically for \"The Red Panda Adventures\", and was also one of the final five nominees for the People's Choice Podcast Awards' \"Cultural/Arts\" category. On August 25, 2006, the first seasons of \"The Red Panda Adventures\", and on September 12, 2006 \"Black Jack Justice\", were made available on separate feeds at Podiobooks.com. In 2007, the podcast was again one of the final nominees for the People's Choice Podcast Awards' \"Cultural/Arts\" category. In 2010, Decoder Ring Theatre won the Parsec Award for Best Audio Drama (Long Form) and then the People's Choice Podcast Award in the Cultural/Arts Category\n\nFormerly, Decoder Ring Theatre released new episodes every other Saturday, running six episodes of the \"Red Panda\", six \"Black Jack\", six more \"Red Panda\", and then six \"Showcase\" episodes.\n\nThe current release schedule is as follows:\n\n\nOld series<br>\nIn summer 2007, Decoder Ring Theatre released the \"Summer Showcase\", an anthology featuring six new podcasts showcasing stories by different writers. The most popular of these were two episodes of the space opera \"Deck Gibson, Far Reach Commander\", written and created by Parsec Award-winning author Matt Wallace (\"The Failed Cities Monologues\").\n\nIn summer 2008, six new episodes of Deck Gibson were introduced. The podcast chronicles the adventures of Deck Gibson as he follows the mission of the Far Reach Fleet: to explore, to discover, to defend. Now he soars beyond frontiers of the galaxy never before seen by human eyes.\n\nOn June 27, 2013, an ebook by Matt Wallace (creator) entitled \"Deck Gibson: The Complete Scripts\" was released on Amazon.com.

{"id": "252653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=252653", "title": "Diabolo", "text": "Diabolo\n\nThe diabolo ( ; commonly misspelled \"diablo\") is a juggling or circus prop consisting of an axle () and two cups (hourglass/egg timer shaped) or discs derived from the Chinese yo-yo. This object is spun using a string attached to two hand sticks (\"batons\" or \"wands\"). A large variety of tricks are possible with the diabolo, including tosses, and various types of interaction with the sticks, string, and various parts of the user's body. Multiple diabolos can be spun on a single string. \n\nLike the Western yo-yo, it maintains its spinning motion through a rotating effect based on conservation of angular momentum.\n\nChinese archaeologists theorize that the Chinese Diabolos (or Chinese yo-yo) originated from the Chinese spinning top. In the Hemudu Excavation, wooden tops were excavated. In order to extend the spinning time of the tops, whips were used to spin the top. This released a sound, and gradually evolved into the term \"Kongzhu\" (). It was speculated that the Chinese poet Cao Zhi in the Three Kingdoms period had composed the poem \"Rhapsody of Diabolos 《空竹赋》\", making it the first record of Diabolo in Chinese history. The authenticity of the poem \"Rhapsody of Diabolos 《空竹赋》\" however required further research and evidence of proof. By the Tang dynasty, the Chinese Diabolo became widespread as a form of toy. However the Chinese scholar Wu Shengda 吳盛達, who lived in Taiwan, argued that records of Chinese Diabolo only appeared during late Ming dynasty Wanli period, with its details well recorded in the book \"Dijing Jingwulue\", referring to Diabolos as \"Kong Zhong\" ().\n\nChinese yo-yos have a longer axle with discs on either end, while the diabolo has a very short axle and larger, round cups on either end. Diabolos are made of different materials and come in different sizes and weights.\n\nThere are many names in the Chinese language for the Chinese yo-yo:\n\nThe first mention of a diabolo in the Western World was made by a missionary, Father Amiot, in Beijing in 1792 during Lord Macartney's ambassadorship, after which examples where brought to Europe. as was the sheng (eventually adapted to the harmonica and accordion).\n\nThe diabolo was part of a presentation of Chinese culture edited by stenographer in 1811-2 (\"La Chine en miniature\"). The toy's popularity waxed and waned throughout the 19th century. In 1812 the diabolo \"was all the rage\"; then it \"enjoyed an ephemeral vogue\" until it \"finally fell into discredit\" some time before 1861. Some consider the toy dangerous; injuries and deaths of players and bystanders have been claimed; and Préfet de Police Louis Lépine once outlawed the game in the streets of Paris.\n\nThe term \"diabolo\" was coined by French engineer Gustave Phillippart, who developed the modern diabolo in the early twentieth century, although credit has also been given to Charles Burgess Fry (\"The Outdoor Magazine\" in 1906) or Fry and Phillippart. The term is derived the name from the Greek \"dia bolo\", roughly meaning \"across throw\". \"In Greek, the term 'diaballo' means to throw across. It comes from a combination of 'dia' meaning across or through (as in the meter of a circle, a line that crosses circle), and 'bolla' or originally 'ballo' which means to throw...\" The Greek word \"diabolos\" (the devil, originally \"the liar\" or \"the one that commits perjury\", from the verb \"diaballo\", which means \"to throw in\", \"to generate confusion\", \"to divide\", or \"to make someone fall\", later used by Christian writers as \"the liar that speaks against God\"), from which many modern languages' words for \"devil\" (French: \"jeu de diable\", \"diable\", Italian: \"diavolo\", Spanish: \"diablo\", Portuguese: \"diabo\", German: \"Teufel\", Polish: \"diabeł\") derive, is unrelated. The term \"loriot\" was used in England, as well as \"rocket-ball\".\n\nConfusion about the provenance of the name may have arisen from the earlier name \"the devil on two sticks\", although nowadays this often also refers to another circus-based skill toy, the devil stick. \"In time 'diabolo' was retained for the spinning version of the Chinese stick toy while the hitting version of the stick toy was rendered into English as the Devil Stick.\"\n\n\"Phillipart claimed \"Diabolo\" to be his invention. In reality, he had improved a Napoleonic toy, which in turn had originated long ago in China.\" However, Charles Parker gained the U.S. license for the term \"diabolo\" in 1906, and the excessive fad for the toy lasted until 1910 (caricatures of public figures with the toy made it to newspapers), hurt greatly by a glut of unsold poor quality off-brand versions (costs ranged from one to eight dollars), and the toy was even removed from the Parker Brothers catalogue, a rare occurrence (its two-year return in 1929 also failed). Another estimate for the fad is 1910 to 1915, while the big fad in Paris is mentioned in \"Nature\" in 1893. The Wright brothers became enamored with the toy during a lull in a trip to France they had taken to market their Wright Flyer III airplane.\n\nA diabolo is described as, \"a double-coned bobbin that [is] twirled, tossed, and caught on a string secured by two wands, one held in each hand,\" and, more generally, as \"an object that can be suspended on a string made taut by two held sticks\". The Chinese yo-yo, often considered a type of diabolo, has been described as, \"a short round wooden stick with two round disks, 1.5 cm thick with a space between them, attached on either end of the stick...It will rotate on a string, each end tied to a thin stick,\" and as, \"two hollow discs of light wood, with openings in the sides, united by a peg tapering to its center\".\n\nAs with the yo-yo, the design of the diabolo has varied through history and across the world. Chinese diabolos have been made of bamboo. Wooden diabolos were common in Victorian times in Britain. Rubber diabolos were first patented by Gustave Phillippart in 1905. In the late twentieth century a rubberised plastic material was first used. Metal has also been used especially for fire diabolos. \"Parker Brothers used steel for the bobbins [axles], with molded rubber ends, and also made some versions out of hollow Celluloid--which, because of its 'frictionless' properties, spun even faster than steel.\" Holes and metal strips alter the sound of the spinning diabolo, but create friction.\n\nThe size and weight of diabolos varies. Diabolos with more weight tend to retain their momentum for longer, whereas small, light diabolos can be thrown higher and are easier to accelerate to high speeds. Rubber diabolos are less prone to breakage but are more prone to deformations. More commonly used are plastic-rubber hybrids that allow flex but hold their shape. The size of the disc or cone varies, as do the presence and size of holes in the discs or cones which may alter the sound produced. In yo-yos a cone is known as the butterfly shape. Regardless of the presence, size, and shape, \"once a diabolo is spinning, the friction of the spinning diabolo against the string creates a whining sound; this is called 'making the diabolo sing.'\" \"When played hard, the [Chinese] yoyo will give out a sharp shrill sound...The shrill sound would add an exciting atmosphere to the [Shanghai winter] festivals...A skillful player can use a pot cover [with a round handle] as a yoyo [without sound].\" A fast whirling kouen-gen produces, \"a shrill whistling sound...not unlike the note of the steam siren.\" Diabolos with only one cup (\"monobolos\") are also used.\n\nThe most basic act of diabolo manipulation is to spin it on the string. \"The string is placed between the circles, but in order for the diabolo to balance, it must maintain a spinning motion, much like a yo-yo.\" However, \"considerably more skill is needed to twirl a diabolo...than the Yo-yo it resembles,\" and, \"the enthusiasts in the game assert that it takes much higher training of eye and muscle than lawn tennis.\" \"Diabolo requires hard practice and highly developed skills, and deserves its independent status.\" Typically, the user pulls the stick in his or her dominant hand so that the string moves along the axle, turning it. \"The player...swing[s] the string right and left.\" By doing this repeatedly and rapidly the diabolo rotates faster. The diabolo spin can be accelerated more quickly using various methods: the 'whip' rotates the diabolo faster by moving one handstick in front of the user's body and past the other handstick, the 'wrap' rotates the diabolo faster when the user wraps a loop of the string around the axle. Both methods increase the amount of string contact with the axle in any given time.\n\nOnce spin speed is increased to a sufficient level that the diabolo is stable, the user can then perform tricks. \"Skillful players can set it whirling at a rate of 2,000 revolutions a minute, it is said.\" Depending on how long a trick takes to perform, the user will normally have to spend some time increasing the spin speed of the diabolo before performing other tricks. Skilled users can perform multiple tricks while maintaining the spin speed of the diabolo. \"A skilled person [can] catch it, hurl it fifty or sixty feet into the air, then catch it again with little effort.\"\n\nThere are countless tricks and variations that fall outside the above categories; these are often more difficult and form the cutting edge of modern diabolo routines. Some examples are:\n\nPerhaps the most active area of development for diabolo performance involves tricks with more than one diabolo on a single string. When manipulating multiple diabolos \"low\", the diabolos orbit continuously on the string in a \"shuffle\". Shuffles are either synchronous (commonly referred to as \"sync\") or asynchronous (\"async\"), depending on whether the diaboloist's hands' movements occur simultaneously or not; shuffles may also be performed with only one hand.\n\nJuggling multiple diabolos \"high\" involves continuously catching and throwing a number of diabolos, never with more than one diabolo on the string simultaneously. Diaboloists have pushed the number of diabolos juggled at once up to six \"high\" (although there is some controversy as to whether this counts as the number of catches achieved is so small) and five \"low\". Most diaboloists, however, stick to using only two or three diabolos at once. The introduction of multiple diabolos on a single string allows for many new moves. Many are applications of one-diabolo moves to multiple diabolos.\n\n\nAnother advanced diabolo style is \"vertax\" (vertical axis; also known as \"Excalibur\"). This is where the diabolo is \"turned vertically\" by means of \"whipping\" and is continually spun in this upright state. The person spinning it needs to rotate their body to keep up with the constant whipping action due to the momentum and centripetal motion at which the diabolo spins. Although the number of tricks seems limited, people are finding more ways to perform with this style, including vertax genocides, infinite suicides, and many suns, orbits, and satellites. It is also possible to have two diabolos in one string in vertax, this feat has been achieved by diabolo duo Tr'espace and a small number of other diaboloists. It has also been done in the form of a fan. Most of these tricks are accomplished by street performers in competitions, notably the GEDC and the Taipei PEC. Some cutting-edge skilled vertax jugglers include William (Wei-Liang) Lin (in 2006, ranked #1 in the world), Ryo Yabe (multiple diabolos), Higami (a Japanese juggling group, noted for inventing the first 'infinite suicide vertax'), and Jonathan P. Chen (noted for inventing the vertax genocide); these jugglers are former and multiple winners of the above-mentioned cups. Eric and Antonin (France) and Nate and Jacob Sharpe (USA) have contributed greatly to the development of vertax passing techniques. Finally, Alexis Levillon invented many vertax tricks including vertax integrals, furthered multidiabolo vertax, and has also invented the \"Galexis\" style, where one diabolo is horizontal, while the other is in vertax.\n\nThis is a relatively recent style of diabolo that is gaining popularity. It utilizes the diabolo so that it has little or no spin at all. Then it can be caught and passed and manipulated with different parts of the body instead of just the sticks and string. It has new possibilities and new ideas are arising from this. Examples include catching the diabolo between one's arm and the stick before throwing it back. Tricks with multiple diabolos have also been developed.\n\nInstead of having two sticks connected by a string, the diabolo is manipulated on a loop of string held around the hands. This opens up a variety of new tricks. Yo-yo type slack tricks can also be performed in a loop.\n\nMonobolo is a variation of the diabolo where instead of having two diabolo cups, there is only one and a weight on the other side. The monobolo can be used in the same fashion as normal diabolos. However, if a monobolo is put into excalibur, or horizontally, monobolos can be manipulated to be like a spinning top. To start a monobolo, twist the string around the axle and then let it gain some speed.\n\nCirque du Soleil combines diabolos with acrobatics during feature acts in five shows: \"Quidam\", \"La Nouba\", \"Dralion\", \"Ovo\" \"and Viva Elvis.\"\n\nIn 2012 the Viva Elvis Casino show in Las Vegas, added a Diabolo Duet act, which includes Trevor Nassler & Maria Wolf.\n\nIn 2006 Circus Smirkus presented a duo diabolo act starring Jacob and Nate Sharpe, with advanced tricks including the first double sprinkler pass in a performance as well as some five-diabolo passing.\n\nThe diabolo programs of many Chinese schools provide performances during the Chinese New Year or near the end of the school year.\n\n\n"}

In addition, in 2003 Kitzis started hosting the show \"HaDerbi HaGadol\" (lit.\"The big derby\") together with the Israeli comedians Eli and Mariano, and in 2004 the humorous reality show \"Laughing academy\" together with Alma Zack. In 2003 Kitzis started performing as the host of the satirical television show \"Eretz Nehederet\" (lit. \"Wonderful Land\") alongside Tal Friedman, Orna Banai, Eli Finish, Mariano Idelman, Dov Navon, Alma Zack and other guest comedians, including Assi Cohen and Yuval Samo whom later on became part of the permanent staff of the show. The show gained massive success, both from the critics and from the Israeli audience. In the summer of 2007, Kitzis began hosting the Israeli version of the American trivia game show \"Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?\" on the Israeli Channel 2. In August 2007 Kitzis collaborated with Tal Friedman in the children show on the Israeli Logi channel which was called \"HaYeduanim\" (lit. \"The celebrities\").\n\nKitzis has been previously married to Dalit Kidon, a PR person for the Israeli Channel 10. On 15 October 2009 Kitzis married the Israeli news anchorwoman Tali Moreno. On 18 March his wife Tali gave birth to their first son.\n"}

When a circle is completed with six pie wedges, the wedges disappears, and points are earned for all wedges cleared from the circle. More points are credited when more wedges of the same color are cleared, and vice versa.

{"id": "182053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=182053", "title": "Gamer", "text": "Gamer\n\nA gamer is a person who plays interactive games, especially video games, tabletop role-playing games, and skill-based card games, and who plays for usually long periods of time. In some countries, such as the UK, the term \"gaming\" can also refer to legalized gambling, which can take both traditional tabletop and digital forms. There are many different gamer communities around the world. Since the advent of the internet, many communities take the form of Internet forums or YouTube/Twitch virtual communities, as well as in-person social clubs.\n\nIn the United States, the average video game player is 30 years old and has been playing video games for over 12 years. In the UK as of 2007, the average video game player was over 23 years old, had played video games for over 10 years, and spent around 11 hours a week playing video games. According to Pew Research Center, 49% percent of adults have played a video game at some point in their life. Those who play video games regularly are split roughly equally between male and female, but men are more likely to call themselves a 'Gamer.'\n\nA female gamer, or gamer girl, is any female who regularly engages in playing video games. According to a study conducted by the Entertainment Software Association in 2009, 40% of the game playing population is female, and women 18 or older comprise 34% of all gamers. Also, the percentage of women playing online had risen to 43%, up 4% from 2004. The same study shows that 48% of game purchasers are female.\nAccording to a 2015 Pew survey, 6% of women in the United States identify as gamers, compared to 15% of men, and 48% of women and 50% of men play video games. Usage of the term \"girl gamer\" is controversial. Some critics have advocated use of the label as a reappropriated term, while others see it as nondescriptive or perpetuating the minority position of female gamers. Some critics of the term believe there is no singular definition of a female gamer and that they are as diverse as any other group.\n\nAlthough men and women play roughly the same number of games, there is a stereotype that women are not considered ¨True Gamers¨ because they tend to play more casual games which do not require much skill and dedication. This stereotype exists due to the fact that at a professional level, most of the teams competing are composed of men, thus, overshadowing the girl gamers who could compete at the same level but are not able to get the same amount of media attention.\n\nA gaymer, or gay gamer, is a person within the group of people who identify themselves as LGBT (gay, bisexual, lesbian, or transgender) and have an active interest in video games. This demographic has been the subject of two large surveys, one in 2006, which noted the level of prejudice that gaymers endure, and another in 2009, focusing on the content that gaymers expect in video games.\nThe gaymer community provides a \"safe place\" for LGBT gamers apart from the isolation they feel from both the heteronormative gaming community and the gay community. They also believe that as homosexuality in video games increase, there will be an increased normalization of homosexuality in general. \"Gaymers are the future of video games\" said Hamed Hosseini, who is married to Mahar Buar, in Valve's gaming convention.\n\nIt is common for games media, games industry analysts, and academics to divide gamers into broad behavioral categories. These categories are sometimes separated by level of dedication to gaming, sometimes by primary type of game played, and sometimes by a combination of those and other factors. There is no general consensus on the definitions or names of these categories, though many attempts have been made to formalize them. An overview of these attempts and their common elements follows.\n\n\nProfessional gamers generally play video games for prize money or salaries. Such individuals usually deeply study the game to master it and usually to play in competitions. A pro gamer may also be another type of gamer, such as a hardcore gamer, if he or she meets the additional criteria for that gamer type. In countries of Asia, particularly South Korea and China, professional gamers and teams are sponsored by large companies and can earn more than 100,000 a year. In 2006 Major League Gaming contracted several \"Halo 2\" players including Tom \"Tsquared\" Taylor and members of Team Final Boss with $250,000 USD yearly deals.\n\nA retro gamer is a gamer who prefers to play, and often enough collect, retro games—older video games and arcade games. They may also be called \"classic gamers\" or \"old-school gamers\", which are terms that are more prevalent in the United States. The games are played on the original hardware, on modern hardware via emulation, or on modern hardware via ports or compilations (though those 'in the hobby' tend toward original hardware and emulation).\n\nA number of taxonomies have been proposed which classify gamer types and the aspects they value in games.\n\nThe Bartle taxonomy of player types classifies gamers according to their preferred activities within the game:\nThe MDA framework describes various aspects of the game regarding the basic rules and actions (\"Mechanics\"), how they build up during game to develop the gameplay (\"Dynamics\"), and what emotional response they convey to the player (\"Aesthetics\"). The described aesthetics are further classified as Sensation, Fantasy, Narrative, Challenge, Fellowship, Discovery, Expression and Submission. Jesse Schell extends this classification with Anticipation, Schadenfreude, Gift giving, Humour, Possibility, Pride, Purification, Surprise, Thrill, Perseverance and Wonder, and proposes a number of generalizations of differences between how males and females play.\n\nAn avatar, username, game name, alias, gamer tag, screen name, or handle is a name (usually a pseudonym) adopted by a video gamer, used as a main preferred identification to the gaming community. Usage of user names is most prevalent in games with online multiplayer support, or at electronic sport conventions.\n\nSimilarly, a \"clan tag\" is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a clan. Clans are generally a group of gamers who play together as a team against other clans. They are most commonly found in online multi-player games in which one team can face off against another. Clans can also be formed to create loosely based affiliations perhaps by all being fans of the same game or merely gamers who have close personal ties to each other. A \"team tag\" is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a team. Teams are generally sub-divisions within the same clan and are regarded within gaming circuits as being a purely competitive affiliation. These gamers are usually in an online league such as the Cyberathlete Amateur League (C.A.L.) and their parent company the Cyberathlete Professional League (C.P.L.) where all grouped players were labeled as teams and not clans.\n\nA clan, squad or guild is a group of players that form, usually under an informal 'leader' or administrator. Clans are often formed by gamers with similar interests; many clans or guilds form to connect an 'offline' community that might otherwise be isolated due to geographic, cultural or physical barriers. Some clans are composed of professional gamers, who enter competitive tournaments for cash or other prizes; most, however, are simply groups of like-minded players that band together for a mutual purpose (for example, a gaming-related interest or social group).\n\nThe identity of being a gamer is partly self-determination and partly performativity of characteristics society expects a gamer to embody. These expectations include not only a high level of dedication to playing games, but also preferences for certain types of games, as well as an interest in game-related paraphernalia like clothing and comic books. According to Graeme Kirkpatrick, the \"true gamer\" is concerned first and foremost with gameplay. Escapist founder Alexander Macris says a gamer is an enthusiast with greater dedication to games than just playing them, similar in connotation to \"cinemaphile\".\nPeople who play may not identify as gamers because they feel they don't play \"enough\" to qualify. Social stigma against games has influenced some women and minorities to distance themselves from the term \"gamer\", even though they may play regularly.\n\nIn August 2014 began a controversy linked to gamer identity, named Gamergate controversy. The controversy has been described as a manifestation of a culture war over cultural diversification, artistic recognition, and social criticism in video games, and over the social identity of gamers. The Gamergate controversy concerns issues of sexism and progressivism in video game culture, stemming from a harassment campaign conducted primarily through the use of the Twitter hashtag #GamerGate. Many supporters of Gamergate oppose what they view as the increasing influence of feminism on video game culture; as a result, Gamergate is often viewed as a right-wing backlash against progressivism.\n\nGames are stereotypically associated with young males, but the diversity of the audience has been increasing over time. This stereotype exists even among a majority of women who play video games regularly. Among players using the same category of device (e.g., console or phone), patterns of play are largely the same between men and women. Diversity is driven in part by new hardware platforms. Expansion of the audience was catalyzed by Nintendo's efforts to reach new demographics. Market penetration of smartphones with gaming capabilities further expanded the audience, since in contrast to consoles or high-end PCs, mobile phone gaming requires only devices that non-gamers are likely to already own.\n\nWhile 48% of women in the United States report having played a video game, only 6% identify as gamers, compared to 15% of men who identify as gamers. This rises to 9% among women aged 18–29, compared to 33% of men in that age group. Half of female PC gamers in the U.S. consider themselves to be core or hardcore gamers. Connotations of \"gamer\" with sexism on the fringe of gaming culture has caused women to be less willing to adopt the label.\n\nRacial minorities responding to Pew Research were more likely to describe themselves as gamers, with 19% of hispanics identifying as gamers, compared to 11% of African-Americans and 7% of whites. The competitive fighting game scene is noted as particularly racially diverse and tolerant. This is attributed to its origin in arcades, where competitors met face to face and the barrier to entry was merely a quarter. Only 4% of those aged 50 and over identified as gamers.\n\nCasualization is a trend in video games towards simpler games appealing to larger audiences, especially women or the elderly. Some developers, hoping to attract a broader audience, simplify or remove aspects of gameplay in established genres and franchises. Compared to seminal titles like \"DOOM\", more recent mass-market action games like the Call of Duty series are less sensitive to player choice or skill, approaching the status of interactive movies. The press rarely calls attention to depth or features found in retro games but missing from new releases.\n\nThe trend towards casual games is decried by some self-identified gamers who emphasize gameplay, meaning the activities that one undertakes in a game. According to Brendan Keogh, these are inherently masculine activities such as fighting and exerting dominance. He further says that games women prefer are more passive experiences, and male gamers deride the lack of interactivity in these games because of this association with femininity. Belying these trends, games including \"The Sims\" or \"Minecraft\" have some of the largest audiences in the industry while also being very complex. According to Joost van Dreunen of SuperData Research, girls who play Minecraft are \"just as 'hardcore' as the next guy over who plays \"Counter-Strike\"\" Dreunen says being in control of a game's environment appeals equally to boys and girls. Leigh Alexander argued that appealing to women does not necessarily entail reduced difficulty or complexity.\n\n"}

{"id": "1171169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1171169", "title": "Isabella Andreini", "text": "Isabella Andreini\n\nIsabella Andreini (Padua, 1562 – 10 June 1604), also known as Isabella Da Padova, was an Italian actress and writer. Considered beautiful, elegant, and well educated, she was one of the most famous performers of her time.\n\nIsabella Andreini was a member of the \"Compagnia dei Comici Gelosi\", an important touring theatre company that performed for the highest social circles of Italy and France. Famous in her time, and ever distinguished alike for her acting and her character, the role of Isabella of the \"commedia dell'arte\", was named after her.\n\nIsabella Andreini was born Isabella Canali in Padua, to Venetian parents.\n\nAlthough her family was poor, Isabella received a complete classical education. She was very interested in literary culture and became fluent in several languages which she put to use in her \"La Pazzia d'Isabella\" (The Divine Madness of Isabella).\n\nIn 1576, at age fourteen, Isabella Andreini was hired by the troupe of Flaminio Scala, the \"Compagnia dei Comici Gelosi\". The Gelosi was a well-established theatre company that performed both scripted and unscripted Commedia dell'arte. The Gelosi were patronized by the aristocracy of northern Italy, usually performing for the gentry of Italy and France. Henry III of France was fond of the troupe, and Isabella performed for him in those very early years.\n\nFrom the beginning, Isabella particularly performed the role of the enamored woman, the \"prima donna innamorata\", and she liked to improvise so the traditional character was less dull and more savvy. She began to improvise and eventually shaped the art form into one of comedic bits and spontaneity. She was one of the women who introduced, developed, and excelled at improvisation She was daring and memorable, sometimes taking off or tearing her clothes onstage. Additionally, Isabella was recognized for her flexibility, an important skill for all \"commedia dell'arte\" characters, regardless of sex. Isabella Andreini used her need to play the power dynamics for comedy in her characters. She recognized the importance of her status as the leading actress in a brand new profession. Isabella worked with the Gelosi until her death.\n\nIn 1578 Isabella Andreini met and married Francesco Andreini, and non-traditionally took his last name, who would become the director of the Gelosi (1589). Isabella became both the leading lady and an important voice within the Gelosi company. Together with her husband she managed the troupe's activities and she negotiated with possible patrons.\n\nIsabella bore seven children, three boys and four girls, while touring in the Gelosi. She was a dedicated mother. While her firstborn son, Giambattista, continued the theatrical tradition, all her other children were raised by the aristocracy of Mantua to become clergy in Italian monasteries, except one son who became a guard of a duke. She was very strong in her motherhood and her role as wife to Francesco Andreini.\n\nIn 1589, Isabella Andreini performed her comic work \"La Pazzia d'Isabella\" (\"Isabella's madness\") for the Florentine court during the wedding of Ferdinando I de' Medici and Christina of Lorraine, and the details of the mostly improvised play have endured until modern times. Fluent in several languages, she was renowned for her intellectual presentation and refined presence. In this play she creates madness by using several languages and then imitating dialects of the other characters on stage. She was versatile in her craft and even referred to herself as being capable of playing any male roles. She created the role of Fabrizio, a character used in many of Flaminio Scala's scenarios, where she plays a transvestite pageboy. Isabella was noted as having played three different characters in one scenario, showcasing her improvisation skills and her talent.\n\nIn 1599, Isabella Andreini performed before Henry IV, King of France, and his wife Maria de Medici.\n\nIsabella performed at least once for two other troupes: the Confidenti of the Duke of Mantua in 1589, and the Uniti in 1601.\n\nIn 1602, Isabella toured northern Italy, and in 1603 she performed again for Henry IV, Marie de' Medici and a local audience at Fontainebleau and Paris. This would be her last tour, because early in 1604 she died near Lyon, on her way back to Italy, when she miscarried her eighth child at age 42. After her state funeral, memorial coins were struck in her honour with one side representing her as a powerful Roman ruler, and the other as the fame goddess herself.\n\nThe death of Isabella was observed by the people of Lyon, with a public funeral and an engraved medallion of that year which featured Isabella's portrait on one side, and the figure of Fame on the reverse with the words \"aeterna fama.\" Although Francesco Andreini dissolved the Gelosi after her death, their son Giambattista Andreini, who was an actor and a playwright, started his own company, the Fedeli, with the original troupe of the Gelosi.\n\nBeside performing on stage, Isabella Andreini was a recognized intellectual who dedicated much of her time to literature. The themes of her plays were shaded with some notions questioning the situation of the woman in the society of that epoch; she wrote with a masculine voice in her creations that showed her virtue. Indeed, after publishing \"Mirtilla\" (1588) she began corresponding with contemporary intellectuals, attending their forums, and -an uncommon achievement for a woman in her era- in 1601 she was integrated into the literary society of the \"Accademia degli Intenti\" of Pavia, for which she adopted the nickname of \"Accesa.\" In a poetry contest held by the Cardinal Giorgio Cinthio Aldobrandini of Rome, Isabella Andreini attained second place, only behind the Renaissance poet Torquato Tasso. Like the Tasso, both Gabriello Chiabrera and Giambattista Marino have praised her.\n\nApart from writing plays, Isabella also wrote poetry and corresponded with a great variety of people\n\n\nShe inspired many French poets, notably Isaac du Ryer (d. c. 1631).\n\nIsabella was known and infamous because of her intimacy onstage. She connected with people and used complex characteristics to make her characters realistic and relatable\n\nThe \"commedia dell'arte\" stock character, Isabella, used by subsequent com media dell'arte troupes, is named in her honor. In particular, this school of theater has studied the posthumous works of Isabella Andreini, \"Rime, Parte seconda\" and \"Fragmenti de alcune scritture\".\n\n\n\n"}

It is a two-person show about the relationships first between a brother and sister, John and Jen, and then, after John is killed, between Jen and her son, also named John. The musical opened Off-Broadway in 1995 and was revived Off-Broadway in 2015.\n\n\"John & Jen\" premiered at the Goodspeed Opera House, East Haddam, Connecticut in 1993.

The revival starred Kate Baldwin along with Conor Ryan, and was presented by Keen Company. The revival closed on April 4, 2015.\n\nSix-year-old Jen Tracy welcomes her newborn brother John into the world, with a warning about the way things work and a promise to protect him from Dad. (\"Welcome to the World\") As they grow, Jen does her best to shield John from life's disappointments, including a painful Christmas Eve fight between their parents. Not long after John's seventh birthday, Jen discovers a bruise on his face. \"It was my fault,\" he tells her, \"I broke a glass.\" Jen vows that Dad will never hurt John again, and she and John make a deal to always be there for each other. (\"Think Big\")\nAs the pair grows older, sibling rivalry crops up when John is forced to attend Jen's high school basketball finals. (\"Dear God\") But when it's time for Jen to go off to college, John begs her not to leave him alone. (\"Hold Down the Fort\") Jen is determined to break free, however, deal or no deal. \"I can't hold your hand forever,\" she tells John. \"Grow up\".\n\nJen embraces the world of the '60s in groovy New York City, where she blossoms into a drug-experimenting hippie while John's life goes in the opposite direction. (\"Timeline\") Without Jen there to protect him, John falls under his father's influence and decides to join the Navy. (\"It Took Me A While\")\n\nWhen Jen returns home from New York, she and John see how much they've changed and how far apart they've grown. (\"Out of My Sight\") Learning of Jen's plans to move to Canada with her draft-dodging boyfriend, John accuses her of rejecting everything he and Dad stand for, and they part in anger. (\"Run and Hide\") After John leaves, Jen unfurls an American flag, drapes it over a coffin, and we learn that John has been killed in Vietnam. \"I'm sorry, little brother,\" she whispers as Act I ends. (\"Epilogue\")\n\nNow living in Canada, 26-year-old Jen is the mother of a newborn baby boy, whom she names John. (\"Old Clothes\") But this John is not the naïve child of the '50s his mother expects him to be. When Jen moves back to the United States, leaving her failed marriage behind, she prepares to spend Christmas alone with seven-year-old John. Her gift to her son is an old baseball glove, which she proudly tells him belonged to his uncle. But John rejects the gift, complaining, \"I'll be the only kid in school with a crappy old glove!\"\n\nJen gets her son to play his uncle's favourite sport, but her obnoxious behavior at games only succeeds in mortifying him. (\"Little League\") Visiting her brother's grave on what would have been his 32nd birthday, Jen remarks on the similarities between the two Johns and vows that she won't fail her son. (\"Just Like You\") But when it's time for the 12-year-old to go off to camp, Jen finds herself barely able to say goodbye. (\"Bye Room\")\n\nIn a montage spanning John's high school years, John and Jen take turns as mock talk show hosts covering topics that reveal Jen's growing dependence on her son and John's struggle for freedom. (\"Talk Show\") Later, when John discovers that his mother has hidden his acceptance packet from Columbia University, it becomes clear that Jen is terrified that she'll lose John \"again,\" and she is no longer able to differentiate between her brother and her son. (\"Smile of Your Dreams\")\n\nFinally realizing how desperately his mother needs him, John decides to forgo Columbia in favour of a local community college. Disturbed to see him throwing away his future on her account, Jen ridicules his decision. John is deeply hurt by his mother's reaction, and he bitterly mocks her influence on his life. (\"Graduation\") As their argument escalates, Jen slaps her son.\n\nShaken by the parallels to her abusive father, Jen retreats to her brother's grave, where she finally accepts that it's time to move on. John joins his mother at the cemetery, where Jen asks his forgiveness. Jen is finally able to let her son go, and they take their first steps into the world on their own.

It has been written by Pradeep Dalvi (Mauli productions). It is based on the book \"May It Please You Honour\" written by Gopal Godse. According to Karline McLain the play \"enacts Godse's defense plea\" and thus \"explores the assassination of Gandhi and the trial of Godse from Godse's point of view.\n\nIn 1989 Dalvi was denied permission by the Maharashtra government to stage the play. The play was first staged in 1997. It ran 13 successful shows but was banned thereafter, by the governments of Maharashtra and Kerala. The producer approached the high court in 1998, which permitted staging the play in 2001. The Supreme Court upheld the high court's ruling. It was staged in Thane's auditorium Gadkari Rangayatan in April 2001 facing opposition from parties like Indian National Congress and Nationalist Congress Party; it was not presented again in Thane until 2011. An Indian Express news story quotes director Vinay Apte regarding the intimidation that artists connected with the play faced, such as the incident when the bus used by the artists while touring was set on fire by Indian National Congress activists in Mulund a suburb of Mumbai. Despite this 627 shows were staged in other cities. In February 2011, the play re-opened to a packed house at the same Gadkari Rangayatan, in Thane. Two platoons of state reserve police and 350 regular policemen under the direction of senior officers provided security. According to Tushar Gandhi, Gandhi's great-grandson, the play creates martyrs of murderers who after \"murdering him (Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi) are now trying to murder his memory\".It starred \nSharad Ponkshe as Nathuram Godse.\n\nBoth the play and its ban have been criticized by Shriram Lagoo a view which was considered representative of the views of other theater workers such as Vijay Tendulkar, Satyadev Dubey and Amol Palekar by The Times of India in its article \"Banning a play is not the solution\". Civil liberties activists have opposed the ban though they consider the play \"vicious\".\n\nYashawant Dinkar Phadke in his book \"Nathuramayan\" has criticised Dalvi's play as presenting \"distorted and falsified facts\". Political activists opposing the play have urged Dalvi to answer questions put forward by Phadke in \"Nathuramayan\".\n"}

He was shot once in the neck and was in critical condition before being pronounced dead at exactly 5:30 p.m.\n\nOn June 18, Onfroy went to a bank to withdraw money before heading to RIVA Motorsports, an upscale seller of motorcycles and boats in Deerfield Beach, Florida. After withdrawing money from a bank, he was followed by a dark-colored Dodge Journey SUV allegedly containing Dedrick Williams, Robert Allen, Michael Boatwright, and Trayvon Newsome.\n\nAt 3:30 p.m. EDT, Onfroy arrived at RIVA Motorsports and entered with his friend. Robert Allen followed Onfroy inside the store to confirm that it was Onfroy inside the BMW. Two minutes later, Newsome and Boatwright allegedly left the SUV and followed Onfroy inside before Williams bought the masks used during the robbery at a local convenience store.\n\nA half an hour later, Onfroy left the dealership, entered his black BMW i8 and began to drive away from the dealership. The SUV drove in front of Onfroy's car, blocking him in while Newsome and Boatwright exited the vehicle and demanded property from Onfroy. A brief struggle ensued, which resulted in Onfroy being allegedly shot once in the neck by Boatwright. Witnesses told police Newsome and Boatwright took a Louis Vuitton bag from Onfroy's vehicle and then fled while Onfroy's friend exited the vehicle and ran away from the crime scene.\n\nThe shooting occurred in east of the city of Parkland where Onfroy was living at the time. The Broward County Fire Department rushed him to the nearby Broward Health North. Onfroy was initially reported to be in critical condition following the shooting, but the Broward County Sheriff's Office later confirmed his death.\n\nShortly following the announcement of Onfroy's death, Broward County Sheriff's Office offered a $3,000 bounty for any information leading to the arrest of any suspects. Originally, many fans of Onfroy's, numerous internet users & local residents suspected local Florida rappers Soldier Kidd and Soldier Jojo to be the killers of Onfroy due to several suspicious Instagram posts made by the pair with specific details that corroborated with witness reports, but these accusations were dropped when Dedrick Williams and Michael Boatwright (the alleged shooter) were arrested.\n\nOn June 20, 2018, the Broward County Sheriff's Office arrested 22-year-old Dedrick Devonshay Williams in connection with Onfroy's murder. Williams was driving in his silver 2004 Honda before a traffic stop occurred. Williams was detained in the car chase that followed. Williams was identified by clothing he wore on June 18, which included orange sandals and a white tank top. The police matched images from security footage to recent pictures from Williams’ Instagram feed, which featured “the same or similar bright orange sandals”. He was also identified by employees who saw him enter RIVA Motorsports to buy a neoprene mask. After Williams' arrest, two more active warrants were issued.\n\nOn June 27, 22-year-old Robert Allen was named as a person of interest in the case, and was later arrested on July 26.\n\nOn July 5, 22-year-old Michael Boatwright was also arrested by the Broward County Sherriff's Office. Originally, he was arrested on drug-related charges, but on July 10, a warrant was put out for him related to the death of Onfroy. Police believe that Boatwright was the one who fatally shot Onfroy. The three men were later indicted by a grand jury, alongside a fourth, for Onfroy's death.\n\nOn August 7, 20-year-old Trayvon Newsome was later arrested for his involvement in the murder. Newsome and Boatwright are the alleged shooters.\n\nDedrick Williams was charged with first degree murder, probation violation, and was denied bail. On June 25, he pled not guilty.\n\nFollowing the announcement of Onfroy's murder, a makeshift memorial was quickly created by fans and local residents, consisting of lyrics from the artist and words of remembrance written in chalk stretching up to a hundred yards. The owner of RIVA Motorsports, where Onfroy was killed, held a vigil on June 19, 2018. Hundreds gathered during the vigil and Broward County Sheriffs were forced to close the street. Shortly after, a walk commenced between Onfroy's fans. Onfroy's house in Parkland, Florida, which was being built at the time, was also memorialized by fans. Onfroy's team issued a statement saying a proper memorial service would be arranged soon.\n\nInternet personality Adam Grandmaison (better known as Adam22), the creator of the podcast \"No Jumper,\" for which Onfroy had his first professional interview, held a memorial a day after Onfroy's death in front of his BMX retail store OnSomeShit on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles to a crowd of 300 people. The crowd eventually grew to over 1,000 and police in riot gear eventually appeared with police en route to disperse the crowd. According to reports, rubber bullets were shot and tear gas was used to disperse the crowd.\n\nAn open casket service for Onfroy took place at BB&T Center in Sunrise, Florida on June 27th where fans were allowed to pay their respects. His private funeral took place a day later, where rappers Lil Uzi Vert, Lil Yachty, Denzel Curry and singer Erykah Badu were among the attendees. He was laid to rest in a grey mausoleum at the Gardens of Boca Raton Memorial Park, in Boca Raton, Florida.\n\nOn June 19, the day after Onfroy’s death, \"Billboard\" reported that Taylor Swift's Spotify single-day streaming record for \"Look What You Made Me Do\" was broken by Onfroy's track \"Sad!\", with over 10.4 million streams compared to Swift's 10.1 million streams. This was followed by a 16-fold sales increase across all streaming and download platforms, including a 7000-fold sales increase in CDs on Amazon.com. Onfroy's album \"?\" was expected to return to the top five the week of his death following his murder, ultimately reaching number three with 90,000 album-equivalent units sold, up from 19,000 the last week.\n\nIn the week following his murder, Onfroy's highest-charting single, \"Sad!\" , went from 52nd to 1st on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, making him the first artist to top the Hot 100 posthumously in a lead role since The Notorious B.I.G., with \"Mo Money Mo Problems\", in 1997. On June 28, his management team posthumously released the music video for \"Sad!\", which has received over 90 million views whilst the audio has over 520 million views.\n\n"}

According to the Smithsonian Institution, the first musical instruments played in outer space were an 8-note Hohner \"Little Lady\" harmonica and a handful of small bells carried by American astronauts Wally Schirra and Thomas P. Stafford aboard Gemini 6A. Upon achieving a space rendezvous in Earth orbit with their sister ship Gemini 7 in December 1965, Schirra and Stafford played a rendition of \"Jingle Bells\" over the radio after jokingly claiming to have seen an unidentified flying object piloted by Santa Claus. The instruments had been smuggled on-board without NASA's knowledge, leading Mission Control director Elliot See to exclaim \"You're too much\" to Schirra after the song. The harmonica was donated to the Smithsonian by Schirra in 1967, with his note that it \"...plays quite well\".\n\nIn the 1970s music tape cassettes were brought to the American space station Skylab, while Soviet cosmonauts Aleksandr Laveikin and Yuri Romanenko brought a guitar to the space station \"Mir\" in 1987. Musical instruments must be checked for gases they may emit before being taken aboard the confined environment of a space station. As of 2003, instruments that have been aboard the International Space Station include a flute, a keyboard guitar, a saxophone, and a didgeridoo.\n\nMusic in space has been a focal point of public relation events of various human spaceflight programs. NASA astronaut Carl Walz played a rendition of the Elvis Presley song \"Heartbreak Hotel\" aboard the ISS in 2003 which was also recorded and transmitted to Earth. Canadian Space Agency astronaut Chris Hadfield, commander of Expedition 35 to the International Space Station, recorded a music video of the song \"Space Oddity\" by David Bowie aboard the space station. The first music video ever shot in space, the video went viral and received widespread international media coverage after being posted to YouTube. Bowie himself later called the cover \"possibly the most poignant version of the song ever created\".\n\nDongfanghong I () was the People's Republic of China's first space satellite, launched successfully on 24 April 1970 as part of the PRC's Dongfanghong space satellite program. The satellite carried a radio transmitter which broadcast the song of the same name, \"Dōngfānghóng\" or \"The East Is Red\"; the broadcast lasted for 20 days while in orbit.\n\nA few bars of \"The Fountain in the Park\" were sung on the Moon by NASA Astronauts Harrison Schmitt and Eugene Cernan on the 1972 Apollo 17 mission. Schmitt started by singing \"I was strolling on the Moon one day...\" when Cernan joined in. Cernan kept with the original \"merry month of May\", however, while Schmitt sang \"December\", which was the actual date at the time. After a brief debate, Schmitt resumed, singing \"When much to my surprise, a pair of bonny eyes...\" until he could no longer remember the lyrics and began vocalizing the notes instead. Moments later, Capsule Communicator Robert A. Parker cut in from Houston, saying \"sorry about that, guys, but today may be December.\"\n\nThe Voyager program probes \"Voyager 1\" and \"Voyager 2\" which by 2016 were still the farthest human made object from Earth (also \"Voyager 1\" is reported to have reached interstellar space) where the galactic plasma is present. \"Voyager 1\" and \"Voyager 2\" were launched by NASA with a message aboard — a kind of time capsule, intended to communicate to extraterrestrials a story of the world of humans on Earth.\n\nAudio sections contain the spoken greetings in the remaining four languages, including Esperanto and !Kung, and also whale sounds were provided by Roger Payne.\nThe next audio section is devoted to the \"sounds of Earth\" that include:\n\nIncluded within the \"Sounds of Earth\" audio portion of the Golden Record is a track containing the inspirational message \"per aspera ad astra\" in Morse Code. Translated from Latin, it means, \"through hardships to the stars\".\n\nIn 2003 the British space organization's \"Beagle 2\" probe was scheduled to play a song from the UK music band Blur, upon touchdown on the planet Mars. It was not known what happened to \"Beagle 2\" for 11 years after landing, and it was considered lost. When it was found intact in 2015, however, the possibility was raised that \"Beagle 2\" had successfully played the song on Christmas Day in 2003 upon landing, but failed to transmit back to Earth.\n\nAmerican recording artist will.i.am wrote, produced, and recorded the song \"Reach for the Stars\" (alternately subtitled \"Mars Edition\" and \"NASA Edition\") in commemoration of the landing of the \"Curiosity\" rover on Mars. The song was first released on August 28, 2012, and it became the first song that was successfully broadcast from another planet.\n\nElon Musk's Tesla Roadster was launched into Earth orbit, then Solar orbit, in February 2018 as part of the Falcon Heavy Test Flight. The sound system on board the car was looping the Bowie songs \"Space Oddity\" and \"Life on Mars?\".\n\n"}

{"id": "22529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22529", "title": "Onomatopoeia", "text": "Onomatopoeia\n\nOnomatopoeia (; from the Greek ὀνοματοποιία; ὄνομα for \"name\" and ποιέω for \"I make\", adjectival form: \"onomatopoeic\" or \"onomatopoetic\") is the process of creating a word that phonetically imitates, resembles, or suggests the sound that it describes. As such words are uncountable nouns, \"onomatopoeia\" refers to the property of such words. Common occurrences of words of the onomatopoeia process include animal noises such as \"oink\", \"miaow\" (or \"meow\"), \"roar\" and \"chirp\". Onomatopoeia can differ between languages: it conforms to some extent to the broader linguistic system; hence the sound of a clock may be expressed as \"tick tock\" in English, \"tictac\" in Spanish, \"dī dā\" in Mandarin, \"katchin katchin\" in Japanese, or \"tik-tik\" in Hindi.\n\nAlthough in the English language the term onomatopoeia means \"the imitation of a sound\", the compound word \"onomatopoeia\" (ὀνοματοποιία) in the Greek language means \"making or creating names\". For words that imitate sounds, the term ὴχομιμητικό (echomimetico) or echomimetic) is used. The word ὴχομιμητικό (echomimetico) derives from \"ὴχώ\", meaning echo or sound, and \"μιμητικό\", meaning mimetic or imitating.\n\nIn the case of a frog croaking, the spelling may vary because different frog species around the world make different sounds: Ancient Greek \"brekekekex koax koax\" (only in Aristophanes' comic play \"The Frogs\") probably for marsh frogs; English \"ribbit\" for species of frog found in North America; English verb \"croak\" for the common frog.\n\nSome other very common English-language examples are \"hiccup\", \"zoom\", \"bang\", \"beep\", \"moo\", and \"splash\". Machines and their sounds are also often described with onomatopoeia: \"honk\" or \"beep-beep\" for the horn of an automobile, and \"vroom\" or \"brum\" for the engine. In speaking of a mishap involving an audible arcing of electricity, the word \"zap\" is often used (and its use has been extended to describe non-auditory effects generally connoting the same sort of localized but thorough interference or destruction similar to that produced in short-circuit sparking).\n\nHuman sounds sometimes provide instances of onomatopoeia, as when \"mwah\" is used to represent a kiss.\n\nFor animal sounds, words like \"quack\" (duck), \"moo\" (cow), \"bark\" or \"woof\" (dog), \"roar\" (lion), \"meow\"/\"miaow\" or \"purr\" (cat), \"cluck\" (chicken) and \"baa\" (sheep) are typically used in English (both as nouns and as verbs).\n\nSome languages flexibly integrate onomatopoeic words into their structure. This may evolve into a new word, up to the point that the process is no longer recognized as onomatopoeia. One example is the English word \"bleat\" for sheep noise: in medieval times it was pronounced approximately as \"blairt\" (but without an R-component), or \"blet\" with the vowel drawled, which more closely resembles a sheep noise than the modern pronunciation.\n\nAn example of the opposite case is \"cuckoo\", which, due to continuous familiarity with the bird noise down the centuries, has kept approximately the same pronunciation as in Anglo-Saxon times and its vowels have not changed as they have in the word \"furrow\".\n\n\"Verba dicendi\" (\"words of saying\") are a method of integrating onomatopoeic words and ideophones into grammar.\n\nSometimes, things are named from the sounds they make. In English, for example, there is the universal fastener which is named for the sound it makes: the zip (in the UK) or zipper (in the U.S.) Many birds are named after their calls, such as the bobwhite quail, the weero, the morepork, the killdeer, chickadees and jays, the cuckoo, the chiffchaff, the whooping crane, the whip-poor-will, and the kookaburra. In Tamil and Malayalam, the word for crow is \"kaakaa\". This practice is especially common in certain languages such as Māori, and so in names of animals borrowed from these languages.\n\nAlthough a particular sound is heard similarly by people of different cultures, it is often expressed through the use of different consonant strings in different languages. For example, the \"snip\" of a pair of scissors is \"cri-cri\" in Italian, \"riqui-riqui\" in Spanish, \"terre-terre\" or \"treque-treque\" in Portuguese, \"krits-krits\" in modern Greek and \"katr-katr\" in Hindi. Similarly, the \"honk\" of a car's horn is \"ba-ba\" (Han: 叭叭) in Mandarin, \"tut-tut\" in French, \"pu-pu\" in Japanese, \"bbang-bbang\" in Korean, \"bært-bært\" in Norwegian, \"fom-fom\" in Portuguese and \"bim-bim\" in Vietnamese.\n\nAn onomatopoeic effect can also be produced in a phrase or word string with the help of alliteration and consonance alone, without using any onomatopoeic words. The most famous example is the phrase \"furrow followed free\" in Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\". The words \"followed\" and \"free\" are not onomatopoeic in themselves, but in conjunction with \"furrow\" they reproduce the sound of ripples following in the wake of a speeding ship. Similarly, alliteration has been used in the line \"as the surf surged up the sun swept shore...\", to recreate the sound of breaking waves, in the poem \"I, She and the Sea\".\n\nComic strips and comic books make extensive use of onomatopoeia. Popular culture historian Tim DeForest noted the impact of writer-artist Roy Crane (1901–1977), the creator of \"Captain Easy\" and \"Buz Sawyer\":\n\nIn 2002, DC Comics introduced a villain named Onomatopoeia, an athlete, martial artist, and weapons expert, who often speaks pure sounds.\n\nAdvertising uses onomatopoeia for mnemonic purposes, so that consumers will remember their products, as in Alka-Seltzer's \"Plop, plop, fizz, fizz. Oh, what a relief it is!\" jingle, recorded in two different versions (big band and rock) by Sammy Davis, Jr.\n\nRice Krispies (US and UK) and Rice Bubbles (AU) make a \"snap, crackle, pop\" when one pours on milk. During the 1930s, the illustrator Vernon Grant developed Snap, Crackle and Pop as gnome-like mascots for the Kellogg Company.\n\nSounds appear in road safety advertisements: \"clunk click, every trip\" (click the seatbelt on after clunking the car door closed; UK campaign) or \"click, clack, front and back\" (click, clack of connecting the seat belts; AU campaign) or \"click it or ticket\" (click of the connecting seat belt, with the implied penalty of a traffic ticket for not using a seat belt; US DOT (Department of Transportation) campaign).\n\nThe sound of the container opening and closing gives Tic Tac its name.\n\nIn many of the world's languages, onomatopoeic-like words are used to describe phenomena beyond the purely auditive. Japanese often uses such words to describe feelings or figurative expressions about objects or concepts. For instance, Japanese \"barabara\" is used to reflect an object's state of disarray or separation, and \"shiiin\" is the onomatopoetic form of absolute silence (used at the time an English speaker might expect to hear the sound of crickets chirping or a pin dropping in a silent room, or someone coughing). It is used in English as well with terms like \"bling\", which describes the glinting of light on things like gold, chrome or precious stones. In Japanese, \"kirakira\" is used for glittery things.\n\n\nA key component of language is its arbitrariness and what a word can represent, as a word is a sound created by humans with attached meaning to said sound. No one can determine the meaning of a word purely by how it sounds. However, in onomatopoeic words, these sounds are much less arbitrary; they are connected in their imitation of other objects or sounds in nature. Vocal sounds in the imitation of natural sounds doesn't necessarily gain meaning, but can gain symbolic meaning. An example of this sound symbolism in the English language is the use of words starting with \"sn-\". Some of these words symbolize concepts related to the nose (\"sneeze\", \"snot\", \"snore\"). This does not mean that all words with that sound relate to the nose, but at some level we recognize a sort of symbolism associated with the sound itself. Onomatopoeia, while a facet of language, is also in a sense outside of the confines of language.\n\nIn linguistics, onomatopoeia is described as the connection, or symbolism, of a sound that is interpreted and reproduced within the context of a language, usually out of mimicry of a sound. It is a figure of speech, in a sense. Considered a vague term on its own, there are a few varying defining factors in classifying onomatopoeia. In one manner, it is defined simply as the imitation of some kind of non-vocal sound using the vocal sounds of a language, like the hum of a bee being imitated with a “buzz” sound. In another sense, it is described as the phenomena of making a new word entirely.\n\nOnomatopoeia works in the sense of symbolizing an idea in a phonological context, not necessarily constituting a direct meaningful word in the process. The symbolic properties of a sound in a word, or a phoneme, is related to a sound in an environment, and are restricted in part by a language's own phonetic inventory, hence why many languages can have distinct onomatopoeia for the same natural sound. Depending on a language’s connection to a sound's meaning, that language’s onomatopoeia inventory can differ proportionally. For example, a language like English generally holds little symbolic representation when it comes to sounds, which is the reason English tends to have a smaller representation of sound mimicry then a language like Japanese that overall has a much higher amount of symbolism related to the sounds of the language.\n\nIn ancient Greek philosophy, onomatopoeia was used as evidence for how natural a language was: it was theorized that language itself was derived from natural sounds in the world around us. Symbolism in sounds was seen as deriving from this. Some linguists hold that onomatopoeia may have been the first form of human language.\n\nIn the development of a language, sounds that are associated with natural objects then go on to form words with related meanings. For example, \"gl-\" at the beginning of an English word can denote something that is shining or iridescent (e.g. glitter, glisten, gleam).\n\nWhen first exposed to sound and communication, humans are biologically inclined to mimic the sounds they hear, whether they are actual pieces of language or other natural sounds. Early on in development, an infant will vary his/her utterances between sounds that are well established within the phonetic range of the language(s) most heavily spoken in their environment, which may be called \"tame\" onomatopoeia, and the full range of sounds that the vocal tract can produce, or \"wild\" onomatopoeia. As one begins to acquire one's first language, the proportion of \"wild\" onomatopoeia reduces in favor of sounds which are congruent with those of the language they are acquiring.\n\nDuring the native language acquisition period, it has been documented that infants may react strongly to the more wild-speech features to which they are exposed, compared to more tame and familiar speech features. But the results of such tests are inconclusive.\n\nIn the context of language acquisition, sound symbolism has been shown to play an important role. The association of foreign words to subjects and how they relate to general objects, such as the association of the words takete and baluma with either a round or angular shape, has been tested to see how languages symbolize sounds.\n\nOnomatopoeia, or \"giongo\" in Japanese, is common in the Japanese language, from day to day conversation to serious news. In general, onomatopoeia in Japanese can be categorized into three types:\nJapanese also uses a system of sound symbolic words called mimetics. Though not entirely different from onomatopoeia, words that are mimetic are generally distinguished from onomatopoeia. Mimetic, or \"gitaigo\" in Japanese, words are a phonological representation of some kind of state of being, or something that doesn't exactly make sound.\n\nSometimes Japanese onomatopoeia produces reduplicated words.\n\nThere is a documented correlation within the Malay language of onomatopoeia that begin with the sound bu- and the implication of something that is rounded. As well as with the sound of -lok within a word conveying curvature in such words like lok, kelok and telok (locomotive, cove and curve respectively).\n\nWithin the Qur'an, written in Arabic, instances of onomatopoeia are documented. Out of about 77,701 words, there are 9 words that are onomatopoeic, 3 which are animal sounds (e.g. \"mooing\"), 2 which are sounds of nature (e.g. \"thunder\") and 4 that are human sounds (e.g. \"whisper\" or \"groan\").\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4338445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4338445", "title": "Reader's theatre", "text": "Reader's theatre\n\nReader's theatre or Reader's theater is a style of theater in which the actors do not memorize their lines. Actors use only vocal expression to help the audience understand the story rather than visual storytelling such as sets, costumes, intricate blocking, and movement. This style of performance of literature was initially lauded because it emphasized hearing a written text as a new way to understand literature.\nReaders Theatre is also known as Chamber Theatre or Interpretive Theatre. Readers Theatre became popular during and following the Second World War when resources to produce plays were scarce. There are four different types of Readers Theatre, each an evolution of the former and each with different attributes: Readers Theatre, Free Readers Theatre, Chamber Theatre, and Contemporary Readers Theatre. Each of these styles and manifestations of Readers Theatre are still performed today.\n\nThe original Readers Theatre was presented using only scripts and stools or chairs. The material performed was plays, poems, narrative fiction, and non-dramatic literature. The performers' focus was offstage and limited costuming was sometimes used (often the readers wore all black to strip away character and allow for more focus on vocal interpretation of the piece). While the readers may have interpreted the scenes or poems cold, in most cases the scripts were memorized and rehearsals were conducted with even more intensity than those conducted for a regular play. There was little to no interaction between performers or movement. This style of performance also helped performers deal with performance anxiety.\n\nFree Readers Theater was a little more free than traditional Readers Theater. The materials performed were all the same except plays were no longer performed. The performers were now able to look at and interact with each a little more and the presence of scripts was optional. Blocking began to appear which suggested psychological relationships between characters and pictorial compositions (for example, if two characters hated each other, they might be at opposite ends of the stage, and as the tension rises, they might move toward each other). The performers still wore black, but some wore additional costume pieces to help suggest character (such as a hat or shawl).\n\nChamber Theater focused on narrative fiction only (no other type of material was performed). Scripts were almost always memorized (a narrator might carry a script to make their authoritative voice). The movement became more elaborate and could be associated with more traditional theater practices; it was used in such a way to reveal the character's role and relationships in the story. Costuming evolved into suggested or full costumes.\n\nContemporary Readers Theatre is commonly practiced today. It is less bound by convention and uses techniques from all of the above traditions of Readers Theatre. It is influenced by performance art techniques which is to say there is an increasing emphasis on creating a critical performance that interrogates the text instead of being faithful to it and doing a good representation to share the meaning with the audience. Contemporary Readers Theatre is influenced by Augusto Boal who emphasized creating interactive improvisational performances where the emphasis is on the performers and audiences' reaction to the central theme of the performance.\n\nAccording to some drama teachers, plays have built-in strategies to help students improve their reading skills. The acting out of dialogue causes readers to work more closely with the text to project and interpret meaning into the reading experience. Consequently, students gain improvement in vocabulary, comprehension and retention. Reading in a small group provides reading role models which is also proven to improve reading skills in students. Research has shown that Readers Theatre can improve reading fluency, word choice and comprehension.\n\nOne of the foremost authors on Readers Theatre was Dr. Leslie Irene Coger. Dr. Coger wrote the book \"Readers Theatre Handbook: A Dramatic Approach to Literature.\"\nDr. Coger, mentioned above as one of the foremost authors on Readers Theatre, began studying expression at the age of nine with a local instructor, Gladys Anderson. In the 1930s, she attended the Curry School of Expression in Boston. She received her Ph.D. in 1952 and spent much of her career as a professor at Southwest Missouri State University. Her retirement was followed by Missouri governor Kit Bond naming July 11, 1981 \"Leslie Irene Coger Day,\" and in 1982, Southwest Missouri State University named its new theatre after her. In 1989, she was inducted into the College of Fellows of the American Theatre. In 1994, she received the Distinguished Service Award from the Performance Studies division of the National Communication Association (NCA).\n\nDr. Coger tracks the rise of Reader's Theatre as part of the larger shifts in her field, beginning with \"expression\" in the 1930s, to \"oral interpretation\" in the late 1940s, to simply \"interpretation\" in the late 1950s and 1960s. In the wake of New Criticism, the \"interpretation\" era focused on works of fiction and analysis of literature, and the study of persona, narrators, and the implied author. This turn gave the discipline room for group performances alongside solo performance of interpretations, including styles such as Chamber Theatre, Theatre of the Mind, and, as Dr. Coger writes in her handbook, Readers Theatre.\n\nFinally, Dr. Coger tracks the shift in the 1990s from \"interpretation\" to \"performance studies\" the field as we know it today.\n\nhttp://readerstheater.com/CEE_Summer_Literacy_Report_2014.pdf\nhttp://www.readerstheater.com/research.html\n\n"}

The director will often ask stand-ins to deliver the scene dialogue (\"lines\") and walk through (\"blocking\") the scenes to be filmed. \n\nStand-ins are distinguished from body doubles, who replace actors \"on camera\" from behind, in makeup, or during dangerous stunts. Stand-ins do not appear on camera. However, on some productions the jobs of stand-in and double may be done by the same person. In rare cases, a stand-in will appear on screen, sometimes as an in-joke. For instance, the actress who pretends to be Ann Darrow in the stage show during the final act of \"King Kong\" (2005) is played by Naomi Watts' stand-in, Julia Walshaw.\n\nStand-ins do not necessarily look like the actor, but they must have the same skin tone, hair color, height and build as the actor so that the lighting in a scene will be set up correctly. For example, if the lighting is set up with a stand-in shorter than an actor, the actor might end up having his or her head in relative darkness.\n\nStand-ins are also used for animated characters in a live-action film, sometimes with life-size character models, so that the animators know where to place their animation and how to make them move realistically, and for actors to know where to look. In these cases, skin tone and hair color are not so important. Height and build, however, are still important for any interactions between live-action and animated characters.\n\nSome celebrities mandate that they will always have the same stand-in. Famous cases include Pluma Noisom (stand-in for Claudette Colbert), Harry Cornbleth (Fred Astaire) and Adam Bryant (Robin Williams). When Bette Davis walked out on her Warner Bros. contract, she negotiated for her regular stand-in, Sally Sage, to continue to work at the studio.\n\n\n"}

Actors also avoid even quoting the lines from \"Macbeth\" before performances, particularly the Witches' incantations. Outside a theatre and after a performance, the play can be spoken of openly. If an actor speaks the name \"Macbeth\" in a theatre prior to one of the performances, they are required to perform a ritual to remove the curse. The ritual may vary according to local custom: one is to leave the theatre building, or at least the room occupied when the name was mentioned, spin around three times, spit, curse, and then knock to be allowed back in. This particular iteration of the ritual is documented in the play \"The Dresser\" and its film adaptations.\n\nOne version of this legend claims that it was the actor who played Lady Macbeth who died during the play's first production run and that Shakespeare himself had to assume the role. There is no evidence that this legend is factual.\n\nGenerally, it is considered bad luck to wish someone \"good luck\" in a theatre. Prior to performances, it is traditional for the cast to gather together to avert the bad luck by wishing each other bad luck or cursing – in English-speaking countries, the expression \"break a leg\" replaces the phrase \"good luck\". The exact origin of this expression is unknown, but some of the most popular theories are the Shakespearean or traditional theory, and the bowing theory.\n\nIn Australian theatrical circles saying \"good luck\" is also avoided, but the replacement is often \"chookas!\" This may be due to the belief among some dancers that saying \"break a leg\" may actually result in broken bones.\n\nOne should always leave a light burning in an empty theatre. \n\nThough it's a superstition, it does have practical value as well: the backstage area of a theatre tends to be cluttered with props and other objects, so someone who enters a completely darkened space is liable to be injured while hunting for a light switch.\n\nIn 2005, \"Playbill\" ran an article about Broadway theatres that were believed to be haunted. The following is a list of hauntings from that article:\n\nRelated to a similar rule for sailing ships, it is considered bad luck for an actor to whistle on or off stage. As original stage crews were hired from ships in port (theatrical rigging has its origins in sailing rigging), sailors, and by extension theatrical riggers, used coded whistles to communicate scene changes. Actors who whistled would confuse them into changing the set or scenery and could result in injury or death. In today's theatres, the stage crew normally uses an intercom or cue light system.\n\n\n\n"}

Later this experience led him to believe that the laws in NSW which criminalised homosexuality had to be changed. Troughman was part of the first Sydney Mardi Gras.\n\nIn 1978, at the age of 28, Charles was exposed to watersports in New York during a visit to the Mineshaft bar. Returning to Australia, Charles realised at the Signal Bar in Sydney how he could incorporate his newly discovered interest in watersports into the bar which lacked special facilities. He did this by using the shared urinal, or trough, common in Australian pubs and clubs. This habit resulted in the name Troughman being applied to Barry. Describing his sexual experience, Troughman began by crouching down and leaning against the urinal, before engaging in the signature activity he is most famous for, \"it becomes easy to let myself go completely and, no longer kneeling or crouching, I lie right down in the urinal.\" Troughman also engaged in other watersports, and recalls having used bandana code.\n\nFor Troughman, the Horden Pavilion offered a safe space for sexual expression in the 1980s and 1990s. As a result of Fox Studio's control of the site, and their implementation of Occupational Health and Safety he ceased to party there.\n\nAccording to Robert Reynolds by the early 2000s in the Sydney gay community \"Troughman has become a cultural icon, an almost mythical figure,\" and that Troughman was particularly famous for his role in the Sydney Mardi Gras parties. By 1996 Troughman had been mentioned in the mainstream media in relation to the Sleaze Ball. An interview with Barry by Kerry Bashford appeared in Campaign magazine, accompanied by a photograph by Garrie Maguire. Sponge magazine, a small underground design magazine edited by Mark Sykes, also ran a story, again Maguire was commissioned to make the accompanying photograph, though it did not get printed, due to its literal interpretation of the subject. The photo was later seen in a Leather pride exhibition.\n\nThere is a sound archive of Barry being interviewed on GayWaves, a Gay Community radio program, where he spoke about his fetish and how he saw it as part of the gay sexual revolution of the 70s and 80s. Barry was active in the gay rights movement in Sydney. He was founding secretary of University of New South Wales Gay Liberation,a participant in the June 1978 street march from which grew the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras and Co-Convenor of Gay Rights Lobby 1981-1984. Gay rights campaigning led to the decriminalisation of homosexual acts in New South Wales in 1984. \n\nPart of the myth of Troughman included persistent rumours of death. Troughman's cultural impact entered into mainstream Australian culture, where by 2007, his practices could be referred to off-hand in relation to public urinals, and comprise part of contemporary Australian myth.\n\nThe 1998 film \"Troughman\" directed by Kellie Henneberry was screened at the International Gay & Lesbian Film Festival in the United States.\n\nKirsti Melville; Greg Appel \"Searching For Troughman\", Earshot, Radio National, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, May 2017.\n\n"}

{"id": "31216179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31216179", "title": "World of the Living Dead", "text": "World of the Living Dead\n\nWorld of the Living Dead \"(WoTLD)\" : Resurrection was a real-time zombie survival strategy browser game developed using OpenStreetMap to provide the underlying game world, with in-depth gameplay features to make a browser-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game accessible on desktop, tablet and mobile devices.\n\nThe game was set in a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, overrun by the zombie apocalypse. Players were tasked with commanding, sustaining, and protecting one or more squads of survivors as they roamed the deserted streets and fought for survival. Players assumed the role of an operative taking a satellite view of the situation, and radioing in orders akin to classic early 90's of the National Emergency Control and Relief Agency (NECRA), a government agency tasked with rebuilding civilization. Players couldn't control the survivors individually, but instead used squad-level controls to accomplish objectives. The game had player vs. player PvP, Faction gameplay and player vs. environment PvE elements.\n\n\"WoTLD\": Resurrection ran its first round of Closed Beta Testing in October 2013. The second test began in December 2013, with the game being released to the public on 21 February 2014.\n\n\"WoTLD\": Resurrection announced its permanent shutdown on 23 June 2014. \n\nIn 2016, the heading of the official website changed to 'World of the Living Dead book coming in 2016' along with the website name to 'World of the Living Dead - Do you love reading about zombies?'.\n\nThe interface of WoTLD made use of OpenStreetMap and was set in a post-Apocalyptic Los Angeles . Much of the gameplay consisted of moving around the game world, a grid made up of 500m x 500m squares with occasional skirmishes with the zombies and the injuries that occur from such battles. In each zone, players had options to engage \"zeds\" scavenge for items, engage opponents, collect research samples or construct safehouses.\n\nThere were several thousand locations on the map, once a player had moved his/her team onto these locations several actions became available. These actions ranged from scavenging the zone for resources to tagging the walls to mark your passing. Squads were marked with small icons on the map, and opposing players, as well as notable buildings are scattered around the map. Movement consisted of moving through the game world step by step. Combat was not \"seen\" first-hand, instead popping up as a series of combat reports, detailing any injuries, kills and/or deaths. As your characters progress, fear, and fatigue start to take its toll, making your survivors less efficient.\n\nWith a complex system of needs, food and water became critical resources in the game and players had to manage hunger and thirst. After passing a certain number of days at maximum thirst or hunger, survivors would go AWOL, moving to a random location on the map, from which they needed to be recovered by the player. Hunger and dehydration would also hinder the survivor's performance, slowing him/her down in combat, making them an easier target. Thus, every expedition had to be carefully planned before ordering your people to leave the relative safety of your safehouse. Players who returned between gameplay sessions to their safehouse would see their health recover, and fear and fatigue drop, and these could be sped up through development of the appropriate skills.\n\nInstead of defining hordes as specific beings, or even as a number, \"WoTLD\" used a unique definition of \"z-density\", defining the density of zombies within a block instead of the actual zombie count. Level of density is defined by a scale of colors, providing a better visual at a first glance.\n\nWorld of the Living Dead: Resurrection was developed by Irish indie games developer Ballardia, which consisted of Dave Barton and Kulpreet Singh. Dave and Kulpreet were both senior development staff at pre-GameStop \"Jolt Online\", then known as OMAC Industries, founded by \"Dylan Collins\", a successful Irish games and technology entrepreneur. He had previously sold \"Demonware\", to \"Activision\", and secured a license to develop a game base on the \"Zork\" series. Dave Barton was Lead Designer for \"Legends of Zork\", and Kulpreet was \"CTO\", and Lead Developer on \"NationStates 2\".\n\n\"WoTLD\" was originally conceived by Dave Barton in 2007. Development began in mid-2009 with the help of Kulpreet Singh. Open beta was originally planned for December 2010, and featured a game engine that incorporated Google Maps. It went into Closed Beta in late 2010, and Open Beta in 2012. However, the developers encountered a severe problem as the Google Maps API, which the game was built around, could not handle large numbers of concurrent players. This meant that the game, which was built around moving through the game's landscape, reacting in real time to noise and other players, did not scale well. Development of all the gameplay elements continued, and the game continued to receive updates until May 2013 when it was announced to be shutting down the following month, allowing the developers to bring the game forward on the new OpenStreetMap system. In June 2014, servers closed, allowing the developers to refocus all efforts to rerelease the game as World of the Living Dead: Resurrection.\n\nIn early 2013 the developers chose OpenStreetMap as a replacement. The first phase of Closed Beta Testing began on 10 October 2013 with over 300 testers, which ended in late November 2013 after initial bug fixes were rapidly deployed, and rebalancing of all metrics tweaked regularly. This shut down in November 2013, allowing the developers some time to address many issues, and re-boot the game to run a full cycle of the game, based on achieving a Faction-based end-game goal of researching a solution to the Zombocolypse.\n\nThe second round of Closed Beta Testing began on 1 December 2013, and ended on 21 February 2014, with the removal of the beta key requirement, a rebalancing of the cooldowns to allow regular solo sessions throughout the day, and updates to allow single players to win the game. The developer have promised a Championship Trophy, which will be webcast, and the winner(s) will have their name engraved on the trophy as Round 1 Winners.\n\n"}
