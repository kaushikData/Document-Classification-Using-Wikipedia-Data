The game uses several mechanics (primarily radiation) which act as barriers. These barriers are used to keep the players within the confines of the linear level design. Nathan Spencer is able to target enemies while hanging, climbing a building or even in mid-swing, while using an implement called the Bionic Arm which can also be used to attack enemies at close range. The bionic arm can be used to grab and launch objects such as boulders and cars at enemies. In addition, he is equipped with boots that enable him to survive extremely long falls. Spencer is equipped with Tungsten gun, which is shot quickly but does minimum damage to the enemies, and Prototype gun, which fires fast and does maximum damage.\n\nThe events of the game take place ten years after the original game. The game follows Major Nathan \"RAD\" Spencer (voiced by Faith No More singer Mike Patton), a government operative working in the fictional Ascension City and an Operative named Joseph Gibson aka \"Super Joe\" (voiced by Steven Blum) for the Tactical Arms and Security Committee (T.A.S.C) that trains bionic operatives like Spencer. After he is betrayed by his own government and falsely imprisoned, the Great Bionic Purge begins. Before his execution, an experimental weapon detonates in Ascension City, unleashing an earthquake along with a radioactive shock wave that leaves the city destroyed and wiping out its populace. The terrorist force known as the \"BioReign\" claims responsibility, threatening invasion. Spencer is freed to redeem his name along with the T.A.S.C's and is reunited with the bionic arm of which he was stripped.\n\nDuring flashbacks the player learns that two years prior Spencer and his bionic partner Lt. Jayne Magdalene failed to eliminate two rogue bionics who had allegedly murdered a handful of people. Spencer resolved to help the two bionics escape when he and his partner discovered that the FSA were actively rounding up and forcibly rehabilitating bionics; something that both Spencer and Magdalene were themselves. Soon after the two rogue bionics and a wounded Lt. Magdalene escaped, Spencer was arrested by the FSA and sentenced to be executed for his treason.\n\nReturning to the present, Gibson releases Spencer on the condition that he assist the FSA against the threat to Ascension City. When given this ultimatum in exchange for his freedom, Spencer initially turns it down, but Gibson tells him he has knowledge of Spencer's missing wife. As Spencer progresses through Ascension City, he discovers information on Project Vulture, a super weapon being sought after by the terrorists. Spencer is ordered to retrieve the item before the Bio-Reign terrorists can. After finally gaining access to the item, he is betrayed by Joe who reveals himself as the leader of Bio-Reign. Joe has also enlisted the help of Gottfried Groeder, a character introduced in \"Bionic Commando Rearmed\".\n\nJoe then reveals that Spencer's wife never left, and alludes to the concept that she is actually part of Spencer's bionic arm. According to Super Joe, in order for bionics to work perfectly, they have to sync with their host on both an emotional and physical level. In this case, Spencer's wife was the perfect candidate. After this revelation, Spencer hastens his pursuit after Joe who activates Project Vulture before Spencer reaches him. Magdalene tries to stall Super Joe, now in a Bio-Mech suit, but she is killed while Spencer is forced to helplessly watch. In a fierce mid-air battle, Spencer kills Joe and ultimately stops Project Vulture. He falls back into the hole of The Vault from which he, Joe and the vultures had ascended earlier.\n\nIn the epilogue a brief conversation in Morse code is shown between the sniper (Thomas Clarke) who'd been following Spencer, and an unknown party. The first message reports that the Vault had been occupied and the Vulture Sentry System had been \"disabled\" before requesting further instructions. While the coded reply was not decrypted from Morse code for the audience (encrypted message is in German once decrypted), it apparently reveals the following declaration in response: \"Execution of Phase Two Prepared. Activate Project Albatros [sic].\"\n\nA comic book tie-in was written by Andy Diggle, with Colin Wilson providing the art. In the weeks leading up to the title's release, every Wednesday a new page was posted on the game's website. These single pages were collected in a thirty-five page comic, which was offered as a bonus for pre-ordering the title. After the game's release, a monthly comic was published by Devil's Due Publishing. Heather Mills was approached to help work on the game due to her work with amputees, but could not reach a compensation agreement with the developers. Players can also use a code found in \"\" to unlock a skin of \"RAD\" Spencer from the original game with short red hair, green blazer and converse like shoes. A similar unlock, the 'Prototype Weapon,' was also available via BCR.\n\nCapcom's Keiji Inafune described the working relationship with Grin as \"messed up\", a situation which had arisen in previous instances of collaborations between Japanese and western developers. Similarly Capcom president Haruhiro Tsujimoto stated: \"Our experience with Bionic Commando has demonstrated the difficulty of outsourcing the development of new title to overseas companies\".\n\nThe soundtrack for the game was generally well received. Kotaku described it as \"suitably epic as well, with classic Bionic Commando music remixed into the sort of score you'd expect from a big-budget action flick.\" Also available is the single rock and roll remix, \"The Bionic Jam\", created by artist vertexguy (Chris Kline). This appeared as a bonus track in the first mission, playing on a radio sitting on top a desk.\n\nGamers who pre-ordered \"Bionic Commando\" from GameCrazy had a chance of winning a limited number of '80s-style metal lunchboxes.\n\nIn Australia, anyone who pre-ordered the game received a Nathan Spencer figure by NECA.\n\nSpencer appears as a playable character in the crossover fighting games \"\", \"Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3\" and \"\", sporting his look from the 2009 game. Dameon Clarke provided his voice.\n\n\"Bionic Commando\" received \"average\" reviews on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN praised the visuals and unpredictable storyline of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions. GameSpot said of both console versions, \"\"Bionic Commando\" has some enjoyable moments, but consistent fun always seems just out of arm's reach.\" In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave both console versions a favorable review, giving each a score of 34 out of 40.\n\n\"The A.V. Club\" gave the PS3 version an A− and said, \"As you squeeze off headshots and sail around the stunningly rendered destroyed city, the game's only hiccup is in forcing you to read fine-print-sized text about the game's optional mythology. But don't let a little reading stop you from enjoying what's essentially a playable action movie.\" \"The Daily Telegraph\" gave the Xbox 360 version seven out of ten and said, \"Irritations aside, there's rarely a dull moment and a delightfully ludicrous storyline with high-camp villains frames the action nicely. As such, \"Bionic Commando\" at its best is a macho, cheeseball 80s action movie that Arnie or Sly would have been proud of.\" \"The Guardian\" gave the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions three stars out of five and said that the game \"looks good, but feels generally soulless and generic. Hardcore gamers will like the advanced difficulty level, but novices will find it infuriating. A damp squib of a revival.\" \"Edge\" gave the Xbox 360 version a score of six out of ten and said, \"The overriding impression is of a game that's physically too big for its action.\" However, \"Wired\" gave the Xbox 360 version a score of five stars out of ten, saying that its concepts \"are strong, but the moment-to-moment action just doesn't deliver on the promise of how awesome it would be to have a grappling hook instead of a hand.\"\n\n\"Bionic Commando\" sold 27,000 units in the U.S., during its first month. In comparison, \"Terminator Salvation\", which received worse reviews from critics, sold 43,000 units in the same length of time. VideoGamer.com's James Orry noted that the game \"could end up being Capcom's first major flop in the high definition era.\"\n\n"}

It is the sixth game in the \"Carnivores\" series of dinosaur-hunting games, serving as a sequel as well as a modern remake of the original game, \"Carnivores\" (1998). The game was released for the PlayStation 3 (PS3) via the PlayStation Network (PSN). \"Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter HD\" received \"Mixed or average reviews\" according to Metacritic.\n\nThe game's premise is not told within the game itself. According to the PlayStation Network website, the player takes the role of a wealthy space-traveller in the future who hunts dinosaurs for sport on a distant planet similar to Earth.\n\nThe game features three environments, including mesas and forests, each with a daytime, dusk, and fog setting. The player is rewarded with gems and money after each hunt. The amount rewarded depends on how well the player did on the hunt. Gems and points are used respectively to purchase new weapons and unlock new environments. The player has access to a multi-purpose hunting device known as Gadget, which features a map, and informs whether the player is being watched by a dinosaur or making too much noise. The device can be updated to include features such as radar, using gems earned from the hunts. The game does not feature any music, but includes dinosaur roars, as well as the sounds of unseen birds, frogs, and insects.\n\nDinosaurs include \"Ankylosaurus\", \"Ceratosaurus\", \"Parasaurolophus\", \"Stegosaurus\", \"Triceratops\", and \"Tyrannosaurus rex\". The player has the ability to evacuate a hunt at any time. Whenever the player is killed by a dinosaur, the screen fades to blackness rather than depicting a death scene. The player starts out hunting only herbivorous dinosaurs. Killed dinosaurs are beamed up by the player's personal spaceship, and the player can purchase trophy versions of each killed dinosaur and display them in a trophy room. The game includes the \"Observer Mode,\" which allows the player to explore a chosen environment and observe the dinosaurs rather than hunt them. The player also has the option to tranquilize a dinosaur rather than kill it.\n\n\"Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter HD\" was developed and published by Vogster Entertainment. It is a modern remake of the original 1998 \"Carnivores\" video game, as well as a sequel in the \"Carnivores\" series. In the United States, the game was released for the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network on September 10, 2013. After the game's North American release, Vogster Entertainment gathered user feedback to make further improvements to the game prior to its European release, which occurred on December 18, 2013, through the PlayStation Network.\n\n\"Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter HD\" received \"Mixed or average reviews\" according to Metacritic. Reviewers particularly criticized the game for its grinding gameplay.\n\nDavid Meikleham of \"PlayStation Official Magazine – UK\" noted that the game had \"a pretty out-there premise.\" Meikleham criticized the high amount of gems and points needed to purchase and unlock parts of the game, such as weapons and levels. However, he also wrote, \"Slow-burning, often unspectacular, this PSN hunter nevertheless has a charming depth if you've got the patience to unearth it.\" Robert Ramsey of \"Push Square\" praised the scenery, but noted the \"cheap and tacky\" design of the game's menus. Ramsey also criticized the repetitive dinosaur roars and the lack of music.\n\nKallie Plagge of IGN called the game \"slow, aimless, bland, and not nearly as exciting as the name would have us believe.\" Plagge stated that despite the \"HD\" in its title, the game had \"some truly awful\" and outdated textures. Plagge praised the environmental exploration as the highlight of the game, but was critical of the rewards system. Plagge also criticized the ability to evacuate a hunt, stating that \"removing any sense of danger or risk takes a lot of the fun out of playing.\" Additionally, Plagge criticized the lack of player death scenes, and stated that the game \"fails to deliver in almost every way.\"\n\nLee Cooper of \"Hardcore Gamer\" praised the controls but criticized some of the graphics as being \"poorly rendered,\" and stated that while \"the dinosaurs look pretty cool, and the environments are expansive and littered with detail, the game is simply not fun.\" Cooper also criticized the lack of an in-game storyline, but concluded that the game was the \"best arcade-style dinosaur hunting game\" available for the PS3.\n\n"}

{"id": "13607556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13607556", "title": "Comedy of menace", "text": "Comedy of menace\n\nComedy of menace is the body of plays written by David Campton, Nigel Dennis, N. F. Simpson, and Harold Pinter. The term was coined by drama critic Irving Wardle, who borrowed it from the subtitle of Campton's play \"\", in reviewing Pinter's and Campton's plays in \"Encore\" in 1958. (Campton's subtitle \"Comedy of Menace\" is a jocular play-on-words derived from \"comedy of manners\"—\"menace\" being \"manners\" pronounced with somewhat of a Judeo-English accent.)\n\nCiting Wardle's original publications in \"Encore\" magazine (1958), Susan Hollis Merritt points out that in \"Comedy of Menace\" Wardle \"first applies this label to Pinter's work … describ[ing] Pinter as one of 'several playwrights who have been tentatively lumped together as the \"non-naturalists\" or \"abstractionists\" ' (28)\" (Merritt 225). His article \"Comedy of Menace,\" Merritt continues,\ncenters on \"The Birthday Party\" because it is the only play of Pinter's that Wardle had seen [and reviewed] at the time, yet he speculates on the basis of \"descriptions of [Pinter's] other plays, 'The Room' and 'The Dumb Waiter', [that Pinter] is a writer dogged by one image—the womb\" (33). Mentioning the acknowledged \"literary influences\" on Pinter's work—\"Beckett, Kafka and American gangster films\"—Wardle argues that \" 'The Birthday Party' exemplifies the type of comic menace which gave rise to this article.\" (225)\n\nIn \"Comedy of Menace\", as Merritt observes, on the basis of his experience of \"The Birthday Party\" and others' accounts of the other two plays, Wardle proposes that \"Comedy enables the committed agents and victims of destruction to come on and off duty; to joke about the situation while oiling a revolver; to display absurd or endearing features behind their masks of implacable resolution; to meet … in paper hats for a game of blind man's buff\"; he suggests how \"menace\" in Pinter's plays \"stands for something more substantial: destiny,\" and that destiny, \"handled in this way—not as an austere exercise in classicism, but as an incurable disease which one forgets about most of the time and whose lethal reminders may take the form of a joke—is an apt dramatic motif for an age of conditioned behaviour in which orthodox man is a willing collaborator in his own destruction\" (Wardle, \"Comedy of Menace\" 33; rpt. in \"The Encore Reader\" 91).\n\n\"Just two years later\" (1960), however, Wardle retracted \"Comedy of Menace\" in his review of \"The Caretaker\", stating: \"On the strength of 'The Birthday Party' and the pair of one-acters, I rashly applied the phrase 'comedy of menace' to Pinter's writing. I now take it back\" (\"There's Music\" 130, as qtd. in Merritt 225–26).\n\nAfter Wardle's retraction of \"comedy of menace\" as he had applied it to Pinter's writing, Pinter himself also occasionally disavowed it and questioned its relevance to his work (as he also did with his own offhand but apt statement that his plays are about \"the weasel under the cocktail cabinet\"). For example, in December 1971, in his interview with Pinter about \"Old Times\", Mel Gussow recalled that \"After \"The Homecoming\" [Pinter] said that [he] 'couldn't any longer stay in the room with this bunch of people who opened doors and came in and went out. \"Landscape\" and \"Silence\" [the two short poetic memory plays that were written between \"The Homecoming\" and \"Old Times\"] are in a very different form. There isn't any menace at all.' \" Later, when Gussow asked Pinter to expand on his view that he had \"tired\" of \"menace\", Pinter added: \"when I said that I was tired of menace, I was using a word that I didn't coin. I never thought of menace myself. It was called 'comedy of menace' quite a long time ago [1958]. I never stuck categories on myself, or on any of us [playwrights]. But if what I understand the word menace to mean is certain elements that I have employed in the past in the shape of a particular play, then I don't think it's worthy of much more exploration\" (Gussow, \"Conversations with Pinter\" 18, 24).\n\nDespite Wardle's retraction of \"comedy of menace\" (and Pinter's later qualifications), \"Comedy of menace\" and \"comedies of menace\" caught on and have been prevalent since the late 1950s in advertisements and in critical accounts, notices, and reviews to describe Pinter's early plays and some of his later work as well. As Merritt points out, among other examples of critics' usage of this and similar categories of Pinter's work, after Gussow's 1971 \"conversation\" with Pinter, \"Though he echoes Wardle's concept, Gussow seems to avoid using \"comedy of menace\" when reviewing the CSC Repertory Theatre's 1988 production of \"The Birthday Party\". While still emphasizing Pinter's 'terrors' and the 'shiver beneath the laughter,' Gussow describes the play as 'a play of intrigue, with an underlying motif of betrayal' … [and] [Bernard F.] Dukore calls the play 'a comedy (of menace or otherwise)' … (Merritt 10).\n\n\nIn discussing the first production of Pinter's first full-length play, \"The Birthday Party\" (1958), which followed his first play, \"The Room\" (1957), his authorised official biographer Michael Billington points out that Wardle \"once excellently\" described its setting (paraphrasing Wardle), as \"a banal living-room [which] opens up to the horrors of modern history\" (Billington 86).\n\n\nIn his second one-act play, \"The Dumb Waiter\" (1960), as accentuated through the 2008 film by Martin McDonagh closely resembling and markedly influenced by it, \"In Bruges\", \"Pinter conveys the idea of political terror through the staccato rhythms of music-hall cross-talk and the urban thriller: Hackney Empire cross-fertilises with Hemingway's \"The Killers\" [1927]\" (Billington 90), one of Pinter's own acknowledged early influences, along with Franz Kafka (348–49); Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists, such as William Shakespeare, John Webster, and Cyril Tourneur, whose work his schoolmaster Joseph Brearley had introduced to him; Samuel Beckett (mostly his novels [43]); and black-and-white American movies of the 1940s and 1950s.\n\n\"A near-perfect play about the testiness of a collapsing partnership and the divide-and-rule tactics of authority,\" according to Billington, \"The Dumb Waiter\" focuses on two characters, Gus and Ben; Gus is \"the man who questions the agreed system and who is ultimately destroyed by his quest for meaning\"; Ben, \"the man who blindly obeys orders and thereby places himself at risk. (If the system can arbitrarily dispose of his partner, why not of him?)\" (92). As Pinter's \"The Dumb Waiter\" has been categorised as a \"comedy of menace,\" so may be McDonagh's \"In Bruges\", as it closely resembles it; yet, despite the comedy and the sense of threat growing out of the menace, these works of Pinter and McDonagh are, in Pinter's words to Billington, also \"doing something which can be described as political\" (92). At the same time, [Pinter] had – and still [in 1996 through to the time of his death in 2008] has – an acute sense of the fragility of earthly happiness and of the terrors that haunt us even from infancy\" (92).\n\nThe \"punning title\" of \"The Dumb Waiter\", Billington observes, \"carries several layers of meaning\": \"It obviously refers to the antique serving-hatch that despatches [sic] ever more grotesque orders for food to these bickering gunmen\"—the dumbwaiter; \"But it also applies to Gus, who, troubled by the nature of the mission [their next job as hitmen] to realise he is its chosen target; or, indeed to Ben, who, by his total obedience to a higher authority that forces him to eliminate his partner, exposes his own vulnerability\" (89). As Gus \"dumbly\" awaits his fate, he may be a subservient partner who awaits orders from the \"senior partner\" Ben, but Ben too is subservient to The Powers That Be, a contemporary variation on Deus ex machina, manipulating both the mechanical dumbwaiter and them through its increasingly extravagant and thus comically inconvenient \"orders\" for increasingly exotic dishes, unnerving both of them.\n\nBillington adds:\nThis being Pinter, the play has a metaphorical openness. You can interpret it as an Absurdist comedy – a kind of \"Godot\" in Birmingham – about two men passing the time in a universe without meaning or purpose. You can see it as a cry of protest against a whimsically cruel God who treats man as His plaything – even the twelve matches that are mysteriously pushed under the door have been invested with religious significance [by critics]. But it makes much more sense if seen as a play about the dynamics of power and the nature of partnership. Ben and Gus are both victims of some unseen authority \"and\" a surrogate married couple quarrelling, testing, talking past each other and raking over old times. (90)\n\nThe comedy in this \"comedy of menace\" often derives from such arguments between Gus and Ben, especially the one that occurs when \"Ben tells Gus to go and light the kettle,\" a \"semantic nit-picking that is a standard part of music-hall comedy\": \"All the great stage and film double acts – Jewel and Warriss, Abbott and Costello – fall into this kind of verbal worrying in which the bullying 'male' straight man issues instructions which are questioned by the more literal-minded 'female' partner\" —\n\nGUS: Light what?<br>\nBEN: The kettle.<br>\nGUS: You mean the gas.<br>\nBEN: Who does?<br>\nGUS: You do.<br>\nBEN: (\"his eyes narrowing\"): What do you mean, I mean the gas?<br>\nGUS: Well, that's what you mean, don't you? The gas.<br>\nBEN: (\"Powerfully\"): If I say go and light the kettle I mean go and light the kettle.<br>\nGUS: How can you light a kettle?<br>\nBEN: It's a figure of speech! Light the kettle. It's a figure of speech! (Qtd. in Billington 90–91)\n\nAs Billington observes further,\nThis kind of comic pedantry has precise echoes of the great Sid Field – ironically [since the city is the setting of this play] a Birmingham comic – who had a famous sketch in which he played a virgin of the greens being hectored by Jerry Desmonde's golf pro who would cry, in exasperation, 'When I say \"Slowly Back\" I don't mean \"Slowly Back\", I mean \"Slowly Back.\" ' At another moment, the bullying pro would tell the hapless Sid to get behind the ball and he would vainly protest 'But it's behind all round it'. But, where in a music-hall sketch this kind of semantic by-play was its own justification, in Pinter it becomes a crucial part of the power-structure. … The pay-off comes when Gus, having dogmatically insisted that the accurate phrase is 'put on the kettle', suddenly finds an irritated Ben adopting the right usage. (91)\n\n\"Everything\" in \"The Dumb Waiter\", Billington observes, \"contributes towards a necessary end\"; for, \"the image, as Pete says in [Pinter's only novel] \"The Dwarfs\", stands in exact correspondence and relation to the idea\" (91). In this example, the central image and central metaphor, the dumbwaiter, while \"despatching ever more unlikely orders,\" serves as \"both a visual gag and a metaphor for manipulative authority\" (91), and therein lies its menace. When Ben instructs Gus verbally, while practicing their \"routine\" for killing their next victim, he leaves out the most important line, which instructs Gus to \"take out\" his \"gun\" (Pinter, \"The Dumb Waiter\" 114–15):\n\n\"BEN \"frowns and presses his forehead\".<br>\nGUS. You've missed something out.<br>\nBEN. I know. What?<br>\nGUS. I haven't taken my gun out, according to you.<br>\nBEN. You take your gun out—<br>\nGUS. After I've closed the door.<br>\nBEN. After you've closed the door.<br>\nGUS. You've never missed that out before, you know that?<br>\nThe crucial significance of the omission becomes clear only at the very end of the play, when \"Gus enters through the door stage-right – the one marked for the intended victim – stripped of his gun and holster\"; it becomes clear that \"he\" is going to be \"Ben's target\" (Billington 92), as Ben's \"revolver [is] levelled at the door\", though the play ends \"before\" Ben fires any shot (Pinter, \"The Dumb Waiter\" 121).\n\n\nIn an entry on Pinter for the 1969 edition of \"The Encyclopedia of World Drama\" cited by Merritt, Wardle repeats and updates some of his first perspective on \"comedy of menace\" as he had applied it initially to Pinter's writing:\nEarly in his writing career Pinter admitted to three influences: Franz Kafka, American gangster films, and Samuel Beckett. . . . At that time his plays, more than those of any other plawright's , were responsible for the newly coined term 'comedy of menace.' This phrase certainly makes sense when applied to \"The Birthday Party\" . . . or to \"The Dumb Waiter\". . . . But 'menace' is hardly the word for \"The Caretaker\", and still less for subsequent plays in which Pinter increasingly exchanged his derelict settings and down-and-out characters for environments of moneyed elegance (657–58). (Qtd. in Merritt 240)\n\nDespite those more-recent caveats regarding applying the phrase that he himself initially coined for Pinter's writing to \"The Caretaker\"—only the second of Pinter's full-length plays produced by then and the one that launched his career as a successful playwright in 1960 (Merritt 9, 226) —and to Pinter's later plays, scenes in both acts of \"The Caretaker\" in which Mick confronts an unsuspecting Davies and scares him almost speechless (Pinter, \"The Caretaker\" 129, 146) also epitomise how comedy and menace still co-exist in Pinter's text and on Pinter's stage.\n\nThe comic aspects of this play multiply, reaching a crescendo in Mick's monologue in Act Two describing his \"deepest wishes\" for decorating the attic room (161, 173) and falling with Davies, a tramp taken in out of the cold by his brother, suggesting that \"if\" he can \"just get down to Sidcup\" to get his \"papers\" and \"sort\" himself \"out\" (113–16, 164), his refrain and excuse for everything (153, 175–79), he might just be able to accomplish Mick's hyperbolic pipe dream and \"decorate the attic room out for [Mick]\" (164), leading Mick to accuse Davies of misrepresenting himself as \"an experienced first-class professional interior and exterior decorator\" (172–74), an absurd conclusion, given the tangible evidence of the down-and-out Davies before Mick (and the audience).\n\nPinter's friend the late film and stage director David Jones, who directed the play for the Roundabout Theatre, in New York City, in 2003 (having previously directed Pinter's 1983 film of \"Betrayal\", as well as other works by or featuring him), reminds his audience that Pinter himself said, in a widely quoted statement, that \"The Caretaker\" is only \"funny, up to a point\" and that \"beyond that point\" is why he wrote it:\nThere is always mischief lurking in the darkest corners. The world of The Caretaker is a bleak one, its characters damaged and lonely. But they are all going to survive. And in their dance to that end they show a frenetic vitality and a wry sense of the ridiculous that balance heartache and laughter. Funny, but not too funny. As Pinter wrote, back in 1960: \"As far as I am concerned The Caretaker IS funny, up to a point. Beyond that point, it ceases to be funny, and it is because of that point that I wrote it.\" (Jones)\n\"Beyond the point\" of the comedy (the \"funny\") lies the scary territory that threatens one's very existence (Billington 92), which Wardle and others commonly have \"labeled\" or \"pigeonholed\" (depending on one's perspective) as \"menace\" (Merritt 9–10).\n\n\nThough \"comedy of menace\" is generally applied to Pinter's early work of the late 1950s through the middle of the 1960s, including \"The Collection\" (1961), \"The Lover\" (1963), \"Tea Party\" (1965, 1968), and \"The Homecoming\" (1965), even Pinter's late plays, like \"Ashes to Ashes\" (1996) and \"Celebration\" (2000), his last two full-length stage plays, exhibit his characteristic amalgam of the comic and the menacing, a sense of threat or impending doom; there is less comedy and more menace in \"Ashes to Ashes\", in which heavy echoes of the Holocaust predominate; a more comedy than menace in \"Celebration\", where heightened comic dialogue outweighs the frightening undercurrents of terror, the terrifying, or the terrible.\n\n\nWhile reviewers and other audience members describe \"Celebration\" as hilarious (\"one of Pinter's funniest plays\", according to Billington [404]), the nature of the relationships of two sets of diners (three couples) having dinner in an upscale restaurant (which some critics assume that Pinter modeled on The Ivy, in London's West End) – \"this is the best and most expensive restaurant in the whole of Europe\" (Pinter, \"Celebration\" 364) – remains characteristically ambiguous; Billington describes one set of couples as \"a strangely rootless bunch with a depleted sense of family\" (405).\n\nOne set (the two couples seated at Table One) consists of brothers Lambert and Matt and their wives, Prue and Julie, who are sisters; the second set of diners (the couple seated at Table Two) consists of a banker and his young wife, Suki, who comically turns out to have had an affair with Lambert when she was 18 (Billington 104).\n\nAs the \"maître d'hôtel\" emits platitudes geared to elevate the nouveaux riches in their own imagined esteem (\"I believe the concept of this restaurant rests in that public house of my childhood\" [Pinter, \"Celebration\" 371]), the \"maîtress d'hôtel\" appears to dwell on a peculiar past family and sex life (373–74), while the Waiter engages in \"interjections\" spinning fantasied impossible memories of a grandfather who knew writers, other artists, and various other public figures of multiple decades and geographical locations too far apart to have been experienced personally in one man's lifetime (367, 375).\n\nLambert and Matt reveal themselves to be rather uncouth bullies (\"Teddy boys\", according to some London reviews)—\n\n\"Lambert's mobile phone rings\".<br>\nLAMBERT Who the fuck's this?<br>\n\"He switches it on\".<br>\nLAMBERT (\"cont\".) Yes? What? (\"He listens briefly\".) I said no calls! It's my fucking wedding anniversary!<br>\n\"He switches it off\".<br>\nLAMBERT (\"cont\".) Cunt.<br> (Pinter, \"Celebration\" 364)—\nwho describe themselves as \"consultants … Strategy consultants. … It means we don't carry guns. … We don't have to! … We're peaceful strategy consultants. … Worldwide. Keeping the peace (379). \"Strategy consultant\" could be a euphemistic catchall for warmonger, manager of terrorism, purveyor of counter-terrorism, or orderer of covert operations.\n\nAs the banker Russell interprets their explanation, \"peaceful strategy consultants\" seems vaguely menacing: \"We need more people like you. Taking responsibility. Taking charge. Keeping the peace. Enforcing the peace. Enforcing peace. We need more like you\" (379). This speech stressing \"force\" (in the repetitions of \"Enforcing\") occurs after Russell has already revealed his own ilk:\nLook at me. I'm basically a totally disordered personality; some people would describe me as a psychopath. (\"to Suki\") Am I right?<br>\nSUKI Yes.<br>\nRUSSELL But when I'm sitting in this restaurant I suddenly find I have no psychopathic tendencies at all. I don't feel like killing everyone in sight, I don't feel like putting a bomb under everyone's arse. I feel something quite different, I have a sense of equilibrium, of harmony, I love my fellow diners. Now this is very unusual for me. Normally I feel—as I've just said—absoute malice and hatred towards everyone within spitting distance—but here I feel love. How do you explain it?<br>\nSUKI It's the ambience. (370–71)\n\nLambert and Matt are distantly reminiscent of Gus and Ben from \"The Dumb Waiter\"; but distinctly less polite while living much higher on the hog. One imagines such characters \n\"strategically\" plotting the \"peaceful\" rendition of others without any qualms while sipping Perrier and simultaneously planning their next wedding-anniversary dinner celebration (perhaps with a different set of wives) on their mobiles.\n\nAs the Waiter says in his apparently penultimate \"interjection\", in which one might detect intimations of mortality:\n\nMy grandfather introduced me to the mystery of life and I'm still in the middle of it. I can't find the door to get out. My grandfather got out of it. He left it behind him and he didn't look back.<br>\nHe got that absolutely right.<br>\nAnd I'd like to make one further interjection.<br>\n\"He stands still\".\n\"Slow fade\".<br>\n\n\nPinter mocks mobile phones comically in an ostensibly-trivial wireless conversation, while still suggesting a residual bit of menace in the unsaid, developed as his last revue sketch \"Apart From That\" (2006). As Billington observes, this dramatic sketch inspired by Pinter's strong aversion to mobile phones is \"very funny\", but \"as two people trade banalities over their mobile phones[,] there is a hint of something ominous and unspoken behind the clichéd chat\" (429), as illustrated in the following excerpt:\n\n\"Two people on mobile phones\".<br>\nGENE.<br>\nHow are you?<br>\nLAKE.<br>\nVery well. And you? Are you well?<br>\nGENE.<br>\nI'm terribly well. How about you?<br>\nLAKE.<br>\nReally well. I'm really well.<br>\nGENE.<br>\nI'm so glad.<br>\nLAKE.<br>\nApart from ... oh you know ...<br>\nGENE.<br>\nI know.<br>\nLAKE.<br>\nApart from ... oh you know ...<br>\nGENE.<br>\nI do know.

It is a hunt game, and since it uses a triangle board, Demala diviyan keliya is specifically a leopard hunt game (or leopard game). Three leopards are going up against fifteen dogs. The dogs attempt to surround and trap the leopards while the leopards attempt to capture enough of them in order to foil their objective. It is unknown how old the game is, but the game was described by H. Parker in his 1909 book \"Ancient Ceylon: An Account of the Aborigines and of Part of the Early Civilisation\". The game is also known as the Tamil leopards' game. The game is well known in Southern India, and its Hindustani name is Rafāya.\n\nThe board consist of an isosceles triangle where two additional line segments run from the apex of the triangle down to its base thus dividing the triangle into four triangular compartments. In addition, a rectangle intersects the triangle breadth-wise. The rectangle itself is divided into two rectangles as a line segment runs across its breadth. This makes a board with 21 intersection points (hereforth called \"points\"). There are fifteen dog pieces and three leopard pieces. The dog pieces should be distinguishable from the leopard pieces. \n\nPlayers decide who will play the Leopards and who will play the Dogs. \n\nHenry Parker does not describe if the board is empty in the beginning or if the three leopard pieces are entered one piece at a time or if all three are already placed on the board and exactly how and where they are placed. Parker only states that the game is played in the same way as in Hat diviyan keliya which is also a leopard game played in Sri Lanka but with less pieces and points on the board. The fifteen dog pieces are set beside the board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was established in 2008 and since 2009 has coincided with National Science and Engineering Week in the UK. In the first festival, hosted by the website attendees were only able to download a podcast featuring songs about science as a radio-style festival report. From 2009, the festival moved to its own website where listeners could listen to a variety of free music and download the radio-style report podcasts, called the \"highlights podcast\". The Geek Pop website also produces a monthly podcast and has hosted live events.\n\nOnline festivals first began in 2003 at the Exposure Festival. Online festivals have a set launch time, but do not happen in a fixed location. They are available online after their launch date.\n\nSimilar to festivals, online festivals have a set time and celebrate a particular aspect of a community, albeit an online community. The emergence of social media has enabled online festivals to allow people to communicate to each other during the online festival. At Geek Pop festivals, this communication is primarily achieved through an online \"bar\", which uses Twitter on the website to show tweets about Geek Pop.\n\nThere are environmental benefits to having an online festival as opposed to, or in conjunction with, a real festival. Half of the acts playing in 2008 were from overseas, but no carbon was used to \"bring\" them to a primarily UK audience. There is no litter or waste generated by the festival and the majority of the marketing is done online, reducing the amount of paper needed.\n\n\nGeek Pop '08 was mentioned during podcasts from the Guardian and Nature, receiving positive reviews from both – \"There were many highlights, but [our] pick of the bunch [is] Dark Matter by science troubadour Johnny Berliner\", said Nature. Laboratory Talk said that, \"this virtual festival has much to commend it… My personal highpoint was the aching rendition of Hotel Mauna Kea by the Photomixers, demonstrating simultaneously pathos, humour, and even a little musical talent.\" Since March 2008 it has also been featured on Australia's Diffusion Science Radio's 2008 Christmas Special as well as the Mr Science Show.\n\nGeek Pop '09 was launched on the 6 March 2009. Alongside the two virtual stages imagined in the podcast from the previous year, the reproductive stage and the Tesla Tent, the festival introduced a new main stage which will be called the Tetrahedron stage (in homage to Glastonbury's Pyramid stage). The major difference for the 2009 festival from the previous year was its relocation to a standalone website and the introduction of an interactive festival map that allowed listeners to choose songs to listen to.\n\nGeek Pop 2010 occurred on 12–21 March 2010 and featured a 5th virtual stage for science comedy, named the Comical Flask. There were also two live performances, one in Bristol in the Cube Microplex, and one in London in The Miller.\n\nNotable acts that contributed to the online festival and live events include Baba Brinkman, Dr Stuart Clark as Dr. Stu and the Neutron Stars, Bert Miller & the Animal Folk, Dr. Martin Austwick from Answer Me This! podcast as The Sound of the Ladies and Jonny Berliner.\n\nBaba Brinkman's \"Rationalist Anthem\" \"Off That\" appeared exclusively as part of Geek Pop 2010, featuring a video animated by Tommy Nagle.\n\nThe launch of Geek Pop 2011 coincided again with The British Science Association National Science and Engineering Week. The online festival went live on the 11 March 2011 and a live launch gig occurred at Wilton's Music Hall in London on the 10 March 2011. The festival featured music from Jeffrey Lewis, Amateur Transplants, Dr. Martin Austwick, Helen Arney and Jonny Berliner. The Amateur Transplants, Martin Austwick and Helen Arney all performed live at the Wilton's Music Hall launch gig.\n\nFor the first time, some of the music was available for purchase only, on a mini album called \"Geek Like Me\".\n\n\nThere was no Geek Pop festival in 2012 due to other commitments from the organisers, Jim Bell and Hayley Birch.\n\n"}

New technologies are obtained through physics questions to be solved by the player, occurring at intervals mirroring real-world innovation.\n\nThere are two related games, Genius: Task Force Biology (German: \"Genius: Task Force Biologie\") and Genius: Politics (German: \"Genius: Im Zentrum der Macht\").\n\nTo begin, the player chooses one of five cities of varying difficulty to play in: Pittsburgh, Detroit, Berlin, London, and Melbourne. The player starts with a single bicycle factory in 1850. At the start, the only available factory is the bicycle factory. New factories and other buildings can be obtained through research in the form of in-game puzzles and physics problems.\n\nAs time progresses, the player enlarges the empire by building new factories, mines, and worker housing. The addition of infrastructure such as water and electricity increases productivity. Later, worker amenities such as libraries and schools become available to raise employee morale.\n\nThe landscape is presented in 3/4 perspective. The landscape can be rotated up to 45° left and right from initial, for a total 90° motion.\n\nAll buildings need to be connected together by roads so that workers can commute to work. Total demand for products can be increased through shipping, such as road and rail connections at the edge of the map and airports.\n\nOne of the earliest infrastructure upgrades is to supply buildings with water and fire coverage, increasing productivity and decreasing fire risk. This done through a pumping station placed at the edge of a body of water and water towers to transport it to distant areas, with fire stations placed within the water coverage. When electricity becomes available, the addition of that resource further increases productivity. Electricity is produced by a power plant and spread by transformer stations.\n\nThere are nine factory types in game: bicycles, locomotives, optics, motorcycles, automobiles, trucks, airships, airplanes, and rockets.\n\nThe base natural resources involved in production are coal, iron, and rubber. Coal and iron can be mined, while rubber needs to be imported by ship. Coal and iron are mined from rock outcrops spread around the landscape. Coal and workers are required for all factories, though certain others also require steel and tires.\n\nThe player is responsible for providing housing to all of the company's employees. The base accommodation is a worker cottage, which can upgrade and eventually be a skyscraper given sufficient demand. The player is also tasked with setting the employee wage. Morale decreases with a decrease or stagnation of wage, leading to increased risk of strikes and financial losses.\n\nThere are six characters seen throughout the game: Mr. Hoffman, George, Production Manager Cunningham, Mrs. Friedrichs, Assistant Mary Rogers, and Assistant Henry Wagner. They provide a face and voice for the various physics problems.\n\nReviews for \"Geniu$: The Tech Tycoon Game\" were generally mixed to positive. Aggregator Metacritic gives the game an average of 63/100.\n\nAllen Rausch at GameSpy rated \"Geniu$\" at 3 out of 5 stars. For him, the game had a good premise but fell short on execution. He appreciated the attempt at mixing educational content, but was disappointed by the mathematical difficulty of some problems and the shallow gameplay.\n"}

The event starred wrestlers such as, Konnan, Chris Masters, Bobby Lashley, Trent Barreta, Samuray del Sol, The Super Smash Brothers, Cody Hall as well as IWGP Tag Team Champions Davey Boy Smith Jr. (David Hart Smith) and Lance Archer. The event had the final Canadian independent appearance of El Generico before his signing with WWE. It also featured a 12-man battle royale consisting mostly of local talent. Kevin Nash had to pull out of the event after his wife became ill. During the event wrestler Pete Wilson suffered a shoulder injury and was rushed to the ER.\n\nHarry Smith and Teddy Hart would have a rematch in 2014, after that Smith returned after performing in Japan.\n\nIn September 2015 an event was held which featured a match for the NWA World Women's Title between Santana Garrett and Shojo Machiko which Garrett won. It also featured two matches with Teddy Hart.\n\nIn December 2015 the promotion held a Hopes & Ropes charity event at the Ranchmans Roadhouse in Calgary. The main event was a match between cousins Teddy Hart and David Hart Smith. The event was put on together with the Aboriginal Friendship Centre of Calgary, the main event between Smith and Hart was for the Stu Hart Heavyweight Championship Belt. The event's goal was to raise money for anti-bullying and self-confidence programs for children.\n\nIn February 2016 it was announced that the next event would be held on March 6, 2016 and that the main event would once again be Teddy Hart vs David Hart Smith. The event was again held at the Ranchmans Roadhouse. In July 2016 the company held an event called the Stu Hart Memorial Cup.\n\nThe 2013 show, \"Resurrection\", was followed by many wrestlers claiming that the promotion failed to pay them. A hotel manager in the area has also stated that a large amount of rooms were booked but that the bills were never paid by the promotion. Teddy Hart has claimed that the responsibility lays with the owners and promoters, John Oniston and Stacey \"Angel\" Olszak, others have maintained that Teddy was the one who was said to be in charge. Hart continued to state that he simply lent his name to the event and featured as a wrestler and did not handle any of the other aspect of the promotion.\n\nWrestler Lance Storm and Jeff Jackson, who served as play by play commentator for the event, have stated that John Oniston who was the promoter for the event had talked to everyone backstage after the show had concluded and ensured them that they would be paid eventually and that they would receive a bonus of 100 C$.\n\nIn late 2013 Jackson told to CBC Radio once again mentioned that Aniston had said to him and the other workers from the event that they would be given their money later on and that they would be compensated for their troubles. He added that Teddy Hart, David Hart Smith and Wayne Hart were the only Hart family members to be involved in the promotion at the time of the event. He also stated that while he had at the time still not been paid, he said that he did not expect for his payment to ever come. Jackson claimed that the pavilion which the event was held at had at least between 1200 and 1800 people in it and that the cheapest tickets were for 25 C$, so there should not have been any problem to pay everyone. Jackson claimed that HLW originally planned another event on February 22 that was supposed to feature former WWE wrestler John Morrison but the event was canceled due to issues.\n\nThe February show was replaced by a new promotion handled by the same people and the professional wrestling newsletter \"Figure Four Online\" made the following statement:\n\nThe issue was settled by 2015.\n\nIn April 2014 Smith Hart announced that David Benoit, the son of controversial wrestler Chris Benoit was to make his in ring debut for Hart Legacy Wrestling on July 18 in Calgary in a tag team match with Chavo Guerrero, a friend of his father Chris. Hart claimed that Benoit had been trained by his nephew David Hart Smith. The match was later canceled in May when another friend of David's father, Chris Jericho informed Guerrero that David did not have any formal training, prompting Guerrero to pull out of the match. Hart had told different versions to the two men, to Guerrero he had said that David had received training for the match but had also told Jericho that David would not be wrestling, just involved in a storyline. Jericho insisted that David would not be included in the show due to his lack of training and was reportedly upset at the promotion for using David to advertise the show.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The album is a soundtrack to Cirque du Soleil's , which debuted on October 2, 2011 in Montreal.\n\nOn October 3, 2011, Sony Music Entertainment announced that over 40 of Jackson's original recordings were redesigned and reimagined by the Justin Timberlake and Rihanna producer Kevin Antunes throughout a year-period work in the studio with original multi-track master recordings. Hence it's expected that \"Immortal\" will continue a similar mixing production to the soundtracks to previous Cirque du Soleil's shows: 2006's \"Love\", with the remixed music of The Beatles (to the show of the same name), and 2010's Elvis Presley-themed remix soundtrack \"Viva Elvis\" (to the show of the same name).\n\nBeing released by Epic Records in conjunction with estate of Michael Jackson, \"Immortal\" features an alternative version of The Jackson 5 song \"ABC\", as well as a series of mashups and remixes such as a choir-assisted rendition of \"They Don't Care About Us\". Despite over 60 songs had been used for the stage show, the album release will be available as a 20-track album or a deluxe 27-track album only.\n\n\"Immortal\" is the eighth album to be released by Sony and Motown/Universal since Michael Jackson's death on June 25, 2009. It is also the third set of remixes of Jackson's music released posthumously, following two 2009 collections, \"The Stripped Mixes\", Jackson's early songs with most of rhythm section edited out, and four EPs under the common title \"The Remix Suite\".\n\nThe debut track from this album entitled \"Immortal Megamix\", which was composed of four of Michael's greatest hits - \"Can You Feel It,\" \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough,\" \"Billie Jean,\" and \"Black or White\" had been unveiled on AolMusic on October 31, 2011. Following the premiere on AOL, the track became available to stream at www.MichaelJackson.com and on Jackson's Facebook page. On November 1, 2011, the track became available as a digital download on iTunes and amazon.com. There was no television promotion or radio airplay.\n\nThe week before its release, several tracks were unveiled on SoundCloud & Billboard.com:\n\nThe whole album was unveiled via NPR on November 18, 2011.\n\nIn the United States, an early estimate predicted \"Immortal\" would sell 50,000 copies in its first week. The album opened with 43,000 copies sold, debuting at No. 24 on the \"Billboard\" 200. \"Immortal\"'s opening week was larger than the acrobatic troupe's take on Elvis Presley's \"Viva Elvis\", which debuted and peaked at No. 48 in 2010 with 13,000 sold first week. In Japan, 150,000 CD copies of this album had been sold during the first week of its release.\n\n\"Immortal\" was ranked number 174 on the list of the 200 best-selling albums of 2012 from the year-end charts of Billboard. It also was ranked number 35 on the top-selling 100 R&B albums of 2012. It is estimated that sales of \"Immortal\" as of 2013 are above 2 million units sold worldwide, with over 500,000 of those from the U.S. during 2012. It is currently the second-best selling Cirque show release, after Love from the Beatles inspired show of the same name.\n\nThe debut song \"Immortal Megamix\" received mixed reviews from music critics. Scott Shetler from \"Popcrash\" said the original songs were \"left intact on this remix with only slight musical embellishments, such as a \"Michael! Michael!\" chant that appears during 'Billie Jean'\", and despite other mixes as the \" Megamix\" that preceded his 1995 double-album were better, \"with his (Michael Jackson's) legacy of musical gold, it would be nearly impossible to create a bad mix.\"\n\nThe album received mixed reviews. Ann Powers from \"NPR\" said, this soundtrack \"adds another dimension to the Jackson omnibus,\" and it \"crafts a new version of Jackson's life story through remixes of his biggest hits and a few obscurities, as well as his own stated favorite songs. \" Kevin Antunes the musical designer for \"Immortal\" said, \"There are jewels throughout this entire CD … put there so you can truly appreciate Michael's musicality,\" and, \"It lifts you up, it challenges, it makes you feel. Being a super-fan myself, having the ability to work on this music is a true honor.\" Randall Roberts from \"latimes.com\" gave this album two and a half stars out of four, \"the soundtrack is beholden to the Cirque/Immortal story line and therefore sequenced not for the dance floor but for a Las Vegas-style production.\" \nChad Grischow from \"IGN\" said, \"the collection at least does a fine job pulling from the various eras of his career\", and \"most of the songs are simply clipped into a shorter version of themselves, with the occasional sound effects to enhance the choreography left feeling odd without it.\"\n\nKillian Fox of \"The Observer\" said, \"not much here is new\", \"the album tries to justify its bulky existence\", \"but they add little to a catalogue of music that has already been superbly produced.\" Arwa Haider from \"metro.co.uk\" said, \"the original songs are obviously fantastic\", but \"without the accompanying Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, these slightly spooky mixes don't add much to his canon. \" Michael Langston Moore from \"African American Entertainment Examiner\" said the album \"deemed to be a bit sacrilege\". Gary Trust and Keith Caulfield from \"Billboard\" pointed out that \"consumers surely didn't seem that interested in the mash-up style album.\" Nekesa Mumbi Moody from \"The Associated Press\" said, \"much of the album seems disjointed. Some songs are oddly chopped up, others are spliced together without much finesse, and there are a myriad of sound effects — bullets firing, glass shattering, the whistle of a train, basketballs bouncing — that just sound like noise,\" and \"on stage, it probably all makes sense beautifully\", \"but without that visual picture, the listening experience is a disappointment.\"\n\nMJJ Productions Inc, the record division of The Michael Jackson Company LLC, announced the titles of the tracks on \"Immortal\" and \"Immortal (Deluxe)\" as follows:\n\nCredits taken from the liner notes.\n\n\n"}

It was the first feature film made by a Sub-Saharan African woman to be commercially distributed and brought international recognition for its director. Centred on a romance, it chronicles the daily lives of people in a rural Senegalese village.\n\nNgor is a young man living in a Senegalese village who wishes to marry Columba. Ongoing drought in the village has affected its crop of groundnuts and as a result, Ngor cannot afford the bride price for Columba. He goes to Senegal's capital city, Dakar, to try to earn more money and is exploited there. He returns to the villagers and shares his experiences of the city with the other men. The story, which shows the daily lives of the villagers, is told in the form of a letter to a friend from a villager, voiced by Faye.\n\n\n\"Kaddu Beykat\" is set in Faye's family village, Fad'jal in southern Senegal. Financing for the film came from the French Ministry of Cooperation and it was made with a crew of three people. It is a mixture of documentary and fiction. For some parts of the film, Faye gathered villagers together, gave them a topic of conversation and proceeded to film them. She took advice from the villagers on what to film. As with her other work, Faye was careful to show African culture from the inside, rather than as an objective observer. The film is a critique of colonial farming practices and government policies which have encouraged single-crop farming of cash crops for export, in some cases leading villages further into poverty. The film is dedicated to Faye's grandfather who features in the film, and who died 11 days after filming ended.\n\n\"Kaddu Beykat\" played at the 1976 Berlin International Film Festival where it won the FIPRESCI Prize and the OCIC Award. It also won the Georges Sadoul Prize and an award at the Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou. It was released in France on October 20, 1976. It was initially banned in Senegal.\n\n\n"}

It is divided into three sections, each with its own focus.\n\nThis section deals with snuff films as seen in fictional movies. <br>\nIt starts with a chapter on the infamous 1976 film \"Snuff\". Made by husband-and-wife team Michael Findlay and Roberta Findlay in 1971, it was left unreleased until 1976 when Allan Shackleton added a new ending, a scene depicting what was supposed to be the film crew for the preceding movie murdering one of the actresses. Shackleton marketed the film as authentic snuff and the film was a huge hit.<br>\nThe second chapter starts with an examination of Michael Powell's 1960 \"Peeping Tom\". The film follows the exploits of a photographer, who in his spare time kills women while filming them. Considered obscene and depraved, even with its lack of nudity or blood, the film ruined Powell's otherwise good career.<br>\nThe next film looked at in this chapter is Joe D'Amato's 1976 film \"Emanuelle in America\", part of the Emanuelle series. Emanuelle, played by Laura Gemser, is a photographer and journalist who investigates a snuff film and gets a little too close to the truth.\n\nThis section of the book covered Mondo films, a series of exploitation \"shockumentaries\" that presented \"actual\" footage of deviant sexual activities or death. Many scenes in these films, while represented as real, were false.\n\nThis section of the book discusses actual deaths caught on film, as presented through the media.

The light plot specifies how each lighting instrument should be hung, focused, colored, and connected. Typically the light plot is supplemented by other paperwork such as the channel hookup or instrument schedule.\n\nUp until the development of Computer Aided Drafting (CAD) programs, light plots were hand drawn or drafted on special drafting paper. Though CAD programs and hand drafting require different techniques and methods, the information is presented and used in the same way. In order to be effective a light plot must:\n\nThe plan view is the primary view of the light plot and contains the most information on the lighting instruments and their locations. As per the design definition, the plan view illustrates how the venue space would appear to someone above it. It contains the relevant architectural information of the venue space including locations of walls, the floor level, the location of seats and balconies, and occasionally sight lines, as well as the location of each lighting instrument and other relevant hardware, like modular dimmer boxes. The plan must also include information on the electrical systems of the theater--the location of outlets connected to the theater's dimmers and the available lighting positions--rails, booms, side arms, and catwalks. The plan view may also contain scenic information, such as a drawing of the set. \n\nThe supplementary (and generally optional) section (side) and elevation (front) views contain much of the same information as the plan view. The section is a cutaway view of the house and stage from either the left or the right. The section line is typically the venue's center line. The elevation is a plot oriented as if viewing the stage from the audience. These supplementary views serve primarily to further illustrate relevant architectural and scenic features, including sight lines. Most commonly the section and elevation plots feature limited electrical information and are used mainly as a reference for the lighting designer or electrician to identify the purpose of each lighting fixture, especially as to how it interacts with any relevant scenic elements. The elevation and section views might also be provided to the electrics crew as a secondary reference for the positions of lighting instruments.\n\nThe instrument layer contains all the information relating to the lighting instruments. This includes:\n\nIn the past when plots were completely hand drafted, a lighting designer would sometimes plot the lighting instruments on a transparent overlay which could be placed over the plan, section and/or elevation views, therefore allowing the \"blank\" views (containing only architectural information) to be re-used for other lighting configurations. The advent of CAD-based lighting design has made this practice obsolete, though occasionally useful.\n\nThe information contained in the lighting instruments section should follow consistent, easy to understand rules which are explained in the key, expediting the electric crew's job of hanging and focusing the fixtures. \n\nThe title block contains several pieces of key information on the production including the show title, date, and venue name, as well as the names of the performance's lighting designer and director. The title block also contains the legend, which identifies all of the drafting symbols used in the plot, as well as any special notes\n\nIn addition to the light plot there are a number of other important pieces of paperwork (i.e. Dimmer hookup, Instrument Schedule, and Magic Sheet) in a complete lighting design. As each part of the lighting design is relevant only to a specific group of technicians, the entire design is generally provided only to the director and master electrician.\n"}

The novel was shortlisted for the 2003 Man Booker Prize.\n\nA film version was released in 2006, starring Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett. The film received four Academy Award nominations, including nominations for Dench and Blanchett.\n\nBarbara, a veteran history teacher at a comprehensive school in London, is a lonely, unmarried woman in her early sixties, and she is eager to find a close friend. However, she reveals that she has been unable to make a previous friendship last as she was considered by previous friends to be domineering and demanding. Her former friend, teacher Jennifer Dodd, even threatened her with an injunction if she tried contacting her again.

During Barbara's first visit to Sheba's residence, she tells Barbara a highly expurgated version of what has happened between her and Connolly, claiming only that he has tried to kiss her and that she discouraged his advances. Barbara offers her some advice on how to cool the boy's ardour, and considers the matter closed.\n\nSheba confesses to Barbara that despite her apparently charmed life, she feels unfulfilled. Sheba has a difficult relationship with her rebellious seventeen-year-old daughter, Polly, whose youth and beauty only intensify her mother's own feelings of aging and waste. Sheba's husband, Richard, is significantly older than she is, and their relationship sometimes has a father-daughter element to it. Sheba's complaints trouble Barbara, who had considered Sheba to have the perfect family life.\n\nBarbara eventually finds out about the affair on Guy Fawkes Night, when she sees Sheba talking to Connolly on Primrose Hill. Barbara feels betrayed that Sheba did not confide in her properly about this during the early stages of their friendship, and is angered by Sheba's obsession with Connolly and her relative neglect of their friendship. When Barbara's cat Portia is diagnosed with colon cancer and needs to be euthanised, she seeks out Sheba for support, only for her to get a call from Connolly during their meeting. Sheba abandons a distraught Barbara in favour of Connolly, compounding Barbara's sense of betrayal from her.\n\nThe power dynamics in the relationship between Connolly and Sheba are changing, with Connolly's interest in the affair waning as Sheba's grows. Sheba becomes needier and starts to write love letters to the boy. Sheba secretly visits Connolly in his parents' council house, and Connolly callously insults her when she tries to make conversation with him. Sheba still does not break off the affair, having become quite enslaved to the now barely invested Connolly.\n\nBrian Bangs, a mathematics teacher, asks Barbara to have Saturday lunch with him one day just before Christmas. He confesses his infatuation with Sheba, leading Barbara to realise that he only asked her out to use her as a means to discover information about Sheba's private life. Overcome by jealousy, Barbara alludes to Sheba's secret. (\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>Sheba likes younger men, you know. \"Much\" younger men.<nowiki>'</nowiki> I paused a moment. <nowiki>'</nowiki>I mean, you \"are\" aware of her \"unusually\" close relationship with one of the Year Eleven boys? <nowiki>'</nowiki>\") Afterwards, Barbara is wracked with guilt, but cannot summon up the courage to tell Sheba what she has done. Rather, she hopes Bangs will not report what she has told him.\n\nSheba's relationship with Polly deteriorates further when the girl's unruly behaviour results in her expulsion from her boarding school. On two occasions, Polly accuses Sheba of having an affair. Sheba is furious about the accusation, believing that she has covered her tracks successfully. Meanwhile, Sheba attempts to take comfort in Connolly throughout her troubles by calling him constantly, and when he fails to answer her calls, she shows up again at his house, only to find that Connolly has taken up with a younger girl and abandoned her. Even this new found evidence of Connolly's loss of interest in her is not enough for Sheba to cease her obsession of him, and she pines for him even knowing she will never hear from him again.\n\nThe school's headmaster is somehow informed about the illicit affair — it is implied that the culprit is Bangs. Sheba is suspended from her job and charged with indecent assault on a pupil. Her husband demands that she leave the family home and prevents her from seeing their children, especially their son Ben, who has Down's syndrome; Polly, meanwhile, refuses to have any contact with her. While Sheba's life is quickly disintegrating, Barbara thrives on the new situation, which she considers her chance to prove her qualities as a friend, even when the headmaster, glad to rid himself of one of his severest critics, forces her into early retirement. Barbara gives up the lease on her own small flat and moves with Sheba into temporary accommodation in Sheba's brother's house.\n\nSheba finds Barbara's manuscript and discovers that she has been writing an account of her relationship with Connolly. She is distraught and furious, not least because Barbara has written about events she did not personally witness, and made judgements about people close to Sheba. She is eventually reconciled with Barbara due to their shared desperation and loneliness, as both have now lost everything. Even now, Barbara uses their desperate circumstances as yet another opportunity to further their relationship, and the mentally weakened Sheba can do little to resist. The novel ends with Sheba, trapped and demoralised, resigning to Barbara's dominance of her.\n"}
{"id": "17964856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17964856", "title": "Overlanding", "text": "Overlanding\n\nOverlanding is self-reliant overland travel to remote destinations where the journey is the principal goal. Typically, but not exclusively, it is accomplished with mechanized off-road capable transport (from bicycles to trucks) where the principal form of lodging is camping, often lasting for extended lengths of time (months to years) and spanning international boundaries.\n\nHistorically, \"overlanding\" is an Australian term to denote the droving of livestock over very long distances to open up new country or to take livestock to market far from grazing grounds. Between 1906 and 1910 Alfred Canning opened up the Canning Stock Route. In Australia overlanding was inspired to a large degree by Len Beadell who, in the 1940s and 1950s, constructed many of the roads that opened up the Australian Outback. \nThose roads are still used today by Australian overlanders and still hold the names Len gave them; the Gunbarrel Highway, the Connie Sue Highway (named after his daughter), and the Anne Beadell Highway (named after his wife).\n\nOverlanding in its most modern form with the use of mechanized transport began in the middle of the last century with the advent of commercially available four-wheel-drive trucks (Mercedes-Benz G-Class's, Unimog, Jeeps and Land Rovers). Nonetheless, there were a few earlier pioneers travelling in remarkably unsophisticated vehicles. \n\nIn the early 1920s, John Weston and family travelled from Britain to Greece and back in a converted US built Commerce one ton truck with a Continental N engine. At the time, the Weston family was based in Europe but returned to South Africa, their homeland, in 1924, taking the vehicle with them. In 1931, the family set out in the same truck from the south-western tip of Africa and drove to Cairo and on to Britain. Not only is this story well-documented but remarkably the vehicle is still extant. In 1975, following renovation, it featured in the International Veteran and Vintage Car Rally from Durban to Cape Town and was then donated to the Winterton Museum, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa, where it can be seen today.\n\nIn 1949, with the Land Rover brand less than a year old, Colonel Leblanc drove his brand new 80-inch Series I Land Rover from the United Kingdom to Abyssinia.\n\nThere followed many more private journeys, with many groups setting out from Europe for remote African destinations. To aid in these endeavors the Automobile Association of South Africa published a guide titled \"Trans-African Highways, A Route Book of the Main Trunk Roads in Africa\".\nThe first edition appeared in 1949 and included sections on choice of vehicle, choice of starting time, petrol supplies, water, provisions, equipment, rules of the road, government officials and rest houses. The serious tone of this book gives some clue as to the magnitude of such a trip, and it was from these beginnings that overlanding developed in Europe and Africa. Notable early examples include Barbara Toy's solo overland journeys in a Land Rover, including one in 1951-2 from Tangier to Baghdad, and the 1955-6 Oxford and Cambridge Far Eastern Expedition, which travelled overland from London to Singapore, also in Land Rovers.\n\nOne of the most well documented overland journeys was by Horatio Nelson Jackson in 1903. In 1954, Helen and Frank Schreider drove and sailed the length of the Americas from Circle, Alaska on the Arctic Circle to Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego in a sea-going ex-army jeep.\n\nIn 2015 the Overlanding Association was created to provide help, support and information to overlanders. To date they have lobbied the European commission and the FIA to improve the rights of Carnet users in Europe.\n\nOverlanding has increased in the past couple of decades, and is getting ever more popular in large part influenced by the Camel Trophy event run from 1980 to 2000 with routes crossing some intensely difficult terrain. It is now quite common for groups of overlanders to organize meetings, and an annual meeting is held every Christmas at Ushuaia. Through the use of the Internet it is much easier to find the information required for extended overland trips in foreign lands and there are several internet forums where travelers can exchange information and tips as well as coordinate planning. While some commercially built overland capable vehicles are produced, \nmany overlanders consider the preparation of their vehicle a paramount part of the experience. Both South Africa and Australia have significant industries based on making accessories for overland travel.\n\nThe late 1960s saw the advent of commercial overland travel. Companies started offering overland tours to groups in large, specially equipped trucks. Mostly in Africa, these journeys could last for months, and relied heavily on the participation of the paying passengers for food preparation, food purchasing and setting up camp. The ultimate of these adventures was always the 'trans', or the complete journey from Europe to Cape Town in South Africa. Commercial overlanding has since expanded to all the continents of the world.\n\nAt , the Trans-Siberian Railway is one of the longest overland journeys in existence today, taking seven days to reach Vladivostok from Moscow, and providing an alternative to air travel for journeys between Europe and Asia.\n\nThe Indian Pacific railway, completed in 1970, links Sydney and Perth in Australia. Covering over four days, the railway includes the longest stretch of straight railway line in the world.\n\nThe introduction of Japan's high speed railway Tōkaidō Shinkansen in 1964 changed the face of rail travel. The railway has carried more than 4 billion passengers and its new N700 series trains are capable of . France's TGV holds the record for the fastest train, with a top speed of more than , making it faster than air travel for many journeys within the country.\n\nThe Silk Route (or Silk Road) historically connects the Mediterranean with Persia and China. Today the route refers to overland journeys between Europe and China, taking either the northern route - through Russia and Kazakhstan - or the southern route - through Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and North India - to Urumqi or Xian in China. These routes are still popular today, with companies offering tours on the southern route.\n\nSome of the longest and more traditional overland routes are in Africa. The Cairo to Cape Town and v.v. route covers more than and currently usually follows the Nile River through Egypt and Sudan, continuing to Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia along the way. In 1959 the pioneering American trailer manufacturer Wally Byam and a caravan of trailers travelled the route from Cape Town to Cairo, via Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe and Zambia), Belgian Congo (now Democratic Republic of Congo), Uganda and north from Kenya. One of the longest current commercial routes is from Reykjavik, Iceland to Cape town, South Africa.\n\nFrom the mid-1980s, the non-operation of the Aswan to Wadi Halfa ferry between Egypt and Sudan as well instability in Sudan, northern Uganda and Ethiopia, made the journey impossible. In recent years however, the Cape to Cairo and Cairo to Cape Town route has again become possible and increasingly popular both with commercial overland trucks carrying groups of 20 or so paying passengers as well as independent travellers on motorcycles or with four-wheel-drive vehicles.\n\nThe traditional Trans Africa route is from London to Nairobi, Kenya and Cape Town, South Africa. The route started in the 1970s and became very popular with small companies using old Bedford four wheel drive trucks carrying about 24 people each, plus lots of independents, normally run by groups of friends in 4x4 Land Rovers heading out of London from November to March every year. The usual route was from Morocco to Algeria with a Sahara desert crossing into Niger in West Africa, continuing to Nigeria. This was followed by a monthlong journey likened to Joseph Conrad’s “Heart of Darkness” through the forests of Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo), surfacing into the relatively modern world in Kenya via Uganda. From Kenya the last leg was south through Tanzania to either Zimbabwe or South Africa.\n\nThis route has changed dramatically due to border closures and political instability creating no-go zones. The route has reversed itself somewhat over the last few years, with trucks now crossing from the north to the south of Africa, closely following the west coast all the way from Morocco to Cape Town with the biggest change in the route being made possible by the opening of Angola to tourism. The journey then continues through Southern and East Africa from Cape Town to Nairobi and on to Cairo.\n\nIn Africa, commercial overland travel began with the Trans Africa and Cape to Cairo described above. From the mid-1980s East and Southern Africa became more sought after by tourists and Nairobi to Cape Town is now the most travelled overland route in Africa. As more tourists look for adventure trips that fit into their annual holiday, shorter sections of overland routes have become available such as two- to three-week round trip from Nairobi taking in Kenya and Uganda.\n\nIstanbul to Cairo, via Syria and Jordan, is a classic overland route. It is a route that has been travelled for centuries, particularly during the Ottoman Empire. Historically it overlapped with the Hajj, with many people covering all or part of the route as part of their pilgrimage to Mecca. Backpackers discovered it in the 1970s and 1980s, with hippies searching for spiritual peace who departed to Jerusalem from Istanbul instead of going to India via Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. After the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, onward travel from Jerusalem to Cairo became a possibility. It is now well travelled by backpackers and overland companies alike although the amount of travellers journeying the route can be affected by any unrest in neighbouring countries.\n\n\n"}

The bystanders having staked their money according to their choice on a board marked in divisions for this purpose, the horses are started revolving rapidly together by means of mechanism attached to the board, and the horse which stops nearest a marked goal wins, every player who has staked on that horse receiving so many times his stake. Figures of railway trains and other objects sometimes take the place of horses. In recent years there has been a tendency to supplant the petits chevaux at French resorts by the boule or ball game, on the same principle of gambling; in this a ball is rolled on a basin-shaped table so that it may eventually settle in one of a number of shallow cups, each marked with a figure.\n\n\"Petits-chevaux\" plays a prominent part in the Saki story, \"The Way to the Dairy\" (c. 1911).\n"}

However, when it was founded in 1840, its initial scope was to become the first Greek music academy organised on European prototypes. Its first Artistic Director was Nikolaos Halikiopoulos Mantzaros, who retained this office until his death in 1872. The Philharmonic (PSC) had a fully organised programme of tuition both in music theory and practice. Its students, who for the first time in modern Hellenic history could learn music regardless of their social class, had the opportunity to be taught by professional musicians and teachers basic music theory, harmony, counterpoint, instrumentation, composition, as well as piano, vocal music, string and wind instruments.\n\nThe tuition of the latter category found its artistic expression through the wind band of the philharmonic, an ensemble, which became very popular by developing into an integral part of public and religious festivities. Nonetheless, the popularity of the band (which was the fourth civilian band of the Ionian Islands after those of Zante (1816), Argostoli (1836) and Lixouri (1838) in Kefalonia) was so strong, that in the end in the public opinion of Corfu 'band' became synonymous to the 'philharmonic'. This misunderstanding, however, became gradually a reality, especially after the Second World War, mainly because of the financial problems that a non-governmental institution like PSC came across. as well as a result of the shortage of professional teachers.\n\nNonetheless, it was only in 1907, as well as during the 1930s when the symphonic orchestra of the society performed in the Municipal Theatre of Corfu, to much critical acclaim. The symphonic orchestra of the Philharmonic made sporadic appearances until the early postwar years. Since 2003 the orchestra has again commenced its activities (as a result of the re-organization of the tuition of the string instruments within the Society).\n\nIn 1979 Maria Desylla-Kapodistria, former mayor of Corfu and the first female mayor in Greece, bequeathed the Kapodistrias summer home under contract No. 4541/3.11.1979 to the Reading Society of Corfu, the Philharmonic Society of Corfu and the Society of Corfiote Studies for the purpose of converting it to a museum dedicated to the memory of Ioannis Kapodistrias. The Kapodistrias Museum, under the stewardship of the three societies, was formally inaugurated in 1981.\n\nThe Museum of the Corfu Philharmonic Society, which occupies the first floor of the Society's building (Nikiforou Theotoki 10), opened for the public on September 18, 2010. The Museum attempts to present in brief the history of the institution after almost two centuries of incessant activity (which coincides with some of the most dramatic periods of modern history). Moreover, the Museum honours Nikolaos Halikiopoulos Mantzaros (1795–1872), the Society’s first artistic director (1841–1872), composer –among others– of the Greek national anthem, well-known music teacher and contrapuntist, as well as inspirer of a whole generation of composers that shaped the music of Ionian Islands, and not only, during the 19th century.\n\nThe Museum of the Corfu Philharmonic Society «Nikolaos Halikiopoulos Mantzaros» consists of five thematic sections, which present its activities and history:\n\nThe Museum also organizes an annual circle of musicological lectures and has initiated a series of musicological publications. It is open Monday to Saturday from 09.30 until 13.30. The entrance is free.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31832343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31832343", "title": "Pitch-pot", "text": "Pitch-pot\n\nPitch-pot (Chinese: Touhu, Korean: Tuho, Japanese: Tōko) is a traditional East Asian game that requires players to throw sticks from a set distance into a large, sometimes ornate, canister. \"Pitch-pot\" is a literal translation of the two Chinese characters in the name (as in \"pitch it into the pot\"), and is used in Sinological literature. \n\nThe game had originated by the Warring States period of China, probably invented by archers or soldiers as a pastime during idle periods. The game began as a game of skill or a drinking game at parties, but by the time it was described in a chapter of the Chinese Classic \"Book of Rites\", it had acquired Confucian moral overtones. Initially popular among elites, it spread to other classes and remained popular in China until the end of the Qing Dynasty. During this time it also spread to Korea and Japan. Today, its popularity in Korea is highest.\n\nThe following description is from the \"Book of Rites\", following James Legge's translation.\n1. According to the rules for Pitch-pot, the host carries the arrows in both his hands put together; the superintendent of the archery carries in the same way the stand on which the tallies were placed; and an attendant holds in his hand the pot.\n\n2. The host entreats (one of the guests), saying, 'I have here these crooked arrows, and this pot with its wry mouth; but we beg you to amuse yourself with them.' The guest says, 'I have partaken, Sir, of your excellent drink and admirable viands; allow me to decline this further proposal for my pleasure.' The host rejoins, 'It is not worth the while for you to decline these poor arrows and pot; let me earnestly beg you to try them.' The guest repeats his refusal, saying, 'I have partaken (of your entertainment), and you would still further have me enjoy myself;--I venture firmly to decline.' The host again addresses his request in the same words, and then the guest says, 'I have firmly declined what you request, but you will not allow me to refuse;--I venture respectfully to obey you.'\n\nThe guest then bows twice, and signifies that he will receive (the arrows). The host wheels round, saying, 'Let me get out of the way;' and then at the top of the steps on the east, he bows to the guest and gives him the arrows. The guest wheels round, and says, 'Let me get out of the way.'\n\n3. (The host) having bowed, and received the arrows (for himself), advances to the space between the two pillars. He then retires, and returns to his station, motioning also to the guest to go to his mat (for pitching from).\n\n4. The superintendent of the archery comes forward, and measures the distance of the pot (from the mats), which should be a space of the length of two and a half arrows. He then returns to his station, sets forth the stand for the tallies, and with his face to the east, takes eight counters and stands up. He asks the guest to pitch, saying, 'When the arrow goes straight in, it is reckoned an entry. If you throw a second (without waiting for your opponent to pitch), it is not reckoned.' The victor gives the vanquished a cup to drink; and when the cups of decision have been dispatched, the superintendent begs to set up what he calls 'a horse' for the victor. If he set up one horse, then a second, and finally a third, he begs to congratulate the thrower on the number of his horses. He asks the host to pitch in the same way, and with the same words.\n\n5. He orders the cithern-players to strike up 'The Fox's Head,' with the same interval between (each repetition of the tune), and the director of the music answers, 'Yes.'\n\n6. When the superintendent announces to them on the left and right that the arrows are all used up, he requests them to pitch again. When an arrow enters, he kneels, and puts down a counter. The partners of the guest are on the right, and those of the host on the left.\n\n7. When they have done pitching, he takes up the counters, and says, 'They have done pitching, both on the left and right; allow me to take the numbers.' He then takes the numbers two by two, and leaves the single counters. After this he takes the single counters, and gives the announcement, saying, \"Such and such a side has the better by so many doubles, or naming the number of the singles.' If they are equal, he says, 'Left and right are equal.'\n\n8. He then orders the cups to be filled, saying, 'Let the cup go round,' and the cup-bearer (of the successful side) replies, 'Yes.' Those who have to drink all kneel, and raising their cups with both hands, say, 'We 'receive what you give us to drink.' The victors (also) kneel and say, 'We beg respectfully to refresh you.'\n\n9. When this cup has gone round, according to rule, (the superintendent) asks leave to exhibit the 'horses' (of the victorious side). Each 'horse' stands for so many counters. (He who has only) one 'horse' gives it to him who has two, to congratulate him (on his superiority). The usage in congratulating (the most successful) is to say, 'Your three \"horses\" are all here; allow me to congratulate you on their number.' The guests and host all express their assent. The customary cup goes round, and the superintendent asks leave to remove the 'horses.'\n\n10. The number of the counters varies according to the place in which they kneel (when playing the game). (Each round is with 4 arrows.) (If the game be in) the chamber, there are 5 sets of these; if in the hall, 7; if in the courtyard, 9. The counters are 1 cubit 2 inches long. The neck of the pot is 7 inches long; its belly, 5; and its mouth is 2½ inches in diameter. It contains a peck and 5 pints. It is filled with small beans, to prevent the arrows from leaping out. It is distant from the mats of the players, the length of 2½ arrows. The arrows are made of mulberry wood, or from the zizyphus, without the bark being removed.\n\n11. In Lû, the young people (taking part in the game) were admonished in these words, 'Do not be rude; do not be haughty; do not stand awry; do not talk about irrelevant matters; for those who stand awry, or speak about irrelevant matters, there is the regular (penal) cap.' A similar admonition in Hsieh was to this effect:--'Do not be rude; do not be haughty; do not stand awry; do not speak about irrelevant matters. Those who do any of these things must pay the penalty.'\n\n12. The superintendent of the archery, the overseer of the courtyard, and the capped officers who stood by, all belonged to the party of the guest. The musicians and the boys who acted as attendants, all belonged to the party of the host.\nTuho appears to have come to Korea from China during the Goryeo period, in 1116 CE, and was popularised by King Yejong. The king's patronage made the previously banned game into a popular courtly pastime, until the influence of the Yuan dynasty once again diminished tuho's popularity.\n\nIn the fifteenth century, the Joseon dynasty revived the game at court, promulgating it as a creation of Confucianism. It was defended from criticism by King Jungjong in 1518, who reaffirmed its respectability and its Confucian connotations. Popularity at court enabled the game to spread through the scholarly and lay community, although the Sarim scholars of the Late Joseon period dismissed it as frivolous. Despite this tuho was a favourite pastime of the scholar Yi Hwang, who recommended it to his students as a way to develop physical health and mental focus. Tuho was featured (along with Yi Hwang) on the 1000 won note from 1983-2002, but was left off of the newest version of the 1000 won note which was first issued January 22, 2007. It was also recommended by Jeong Yak-yong, in his \"Mongmin Simseo\" (\"Admonitions on Governing the People\").\n\nArrow vases sometimes feature in the sculptural imagery of \"norigae\" accessories, where they symbolise the rejection of bad fortune.\n\nThe game is a traditional diversion on Korean New Year's Day and Chuseok. Modern versions are often played with a simple canister and rubber-tipped arrows. The arrows used are usually between 50 and 60 cm long, and are thrown at the arrow vase from around ten paces away.\nTuho was also a popular drinking game. For every arrow that missed the pot, the loser or \"bulseung\" (불승/不承, lit. no-success) had to take a drink. To prevent betting on the outcome, losers could opt to sing a song as a penalty instead. Players who did not miss the canister were called \"hyeon\" (현, lit. wise).\n"}

The troupe was founded in 1993 by current Director Dameon Willich. \n\nThe troupe consists of performers from the Puget Sound area. Many of the Seattle Knights are professional actors who perform in local theaters around the Northwest, while others perform as a hobby or secondary to another career. Members are trained in a combat system that emphasizes safety and authenticity, as well as entertainment value. They have the best safety record in the industry. \n\nThe Seattle Knights and their members have worked in motion pictures, television, commercials, and radio. Members provided medieval combat stuntwork on the History Channel's 2001 series, \"Modern Marvels: Battle Gear\". Members of Seattle Knights performed equestrian stuntwork in the 1997 film \"The Postman\", and the independent film \"Warrior's End\".\n\nThe Seattle Knights are actor-combatants, who perform choreographed, medieval-style combat using real armor and weapons. They regularly perform in renaissance fairs in across the United States, and in annual benefit shows at Bridle Trails State Park. The troupe also participates in parades, state and county fairs, and other local events.\nCombat is performed by both men and women, utilizing a variety of weapons, including: spears, war hammers, axes, daggers, and swords of almost every variety. Combatants include knights, mercenaries, rogues, damsels in distress, magic wielders, elves, and a variety of monsters, depending on the needs of the story. \n\nIn the shows, equestrian wargames test the speed, courage, and horsemanship of the mounted Knights. Jousters contest in armor drawn from many different cultures and periods on a variety of breeds of horses. Warriors awaiting their turn join the audience in heckling, making wagers, and cheering on their favorites.\n\nThe more typical shows feature story lines created by Dameon Willich and Darragh Metzger, centering on the fictional land of Tír na nÓg. As the story goes, this land is entered by crossing the enchanted mists into a world existing parallel to this one. Faerie folk and humans share this world, however, not always peacefully. The ruling body in this land is referred to as the Greater Fey, who wield powers that help keep their citizens lawful. Conflicts are abated quickly by the Greater Fey and their human Triads. \n\nA Triad is created by the Greater Fey which choose humans who have proven themselves to be strong, brave and clever. They consist of Cavaliers, the warrior-knights, Rangers, light fighters, and Mystics, wielders of magic. Each Triad is connected to a Faction, designated by a color. This storyline culminates in a tournament, where each Faction may prove its skill through combat, light horse runs, and the joust.\n\nMembers of the Seattle Knights perform in two additional shows separate from their traditional medieval performances. \nThey perform in a pirate themed show as the \"Pirates of Puget Sound\". The troupe also performs as the \"Seattle Swashbucklers\" in shows featuring a 1600-1650s theme. \nThe fantasy-oriented folk music of \"A Little Knight Music\" has garnered favorable reviews across the northwest. \n\nMembers of the troupe meet weekly to practice and engage in mock battles.

{"id": "259338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=259338", "title": "Subscription business model", "text": "Subscription business model\n\nThe subscription business model is a business model in which a customer must pay a recurring price at regular intervals for access to a product or service. The model was pioneered by publishers of books and periodicals in the 17th century, and is now used by many businesses and websites.\n\nRather than selling products individually, a subscription offers periodic (monthly. yearly, or seasonal) use or access to a product or service, or, in the case of performance-oriented organizations such as opera companies, tickets to the entire run of some set number of (eg., five to fifteen) scheduled performances for an entire season. Thus, a one-time sale of a product can become a recurring sale and can build brand loyalty.\n\nMembership fees to some types of organizations, such as trade unions, are also known as subscriptions. Industries that use this model include mail order book sales clubs and music sales clubs, cable television, satellite television providers with pay television channels, satellite radio, telephone companies, mobile network operators, internet providers, software publishers, websites (e.g., blogging websites), business solutions providers, financial services firms, health clubs, lawn mowing and snowplowing services, and pharmaceuticals, as well as the traditional newspapers, magazines, and academic journals.\n\nRenewal of a subscription may be periodic and activated automatically so that the cost of a new period is automatically paid for by a pre-authorized charge to a credit card or a checking account. A common variation of the model in online games and on websites is the \"freemium\" model, in which a first tier of content is free, but access to premium features (for example, game power-ups or article archives) is limited to paying subscribers.\n\nThere are different categories of subscriptions:\n\nBusinesses benefit because they are assured a predictable and constant revenue stream from subscribed individuals for the duration of the subscriber's agreement. Not only does this greatly reduce uncertainty and the riskiness of the enterprise, but it often provides payment in advance (as with magazines, concert tickets), while allowing customers to become greatly attached to using the service and, therefore, more likely to extend by signing an agreement for the next period close to when the current agreement expires. source from Johnson Cornel, university of TUIR.\n\nIn integrated software solutions, for example, the subscription pricing structure is designed so that the revenue stream from the recurring subscriptions is considerably greater than the revenue from simple one-time purchases. In some subscription schemes (like magazines), it also increases sales, by not giving subscribers the option to accept or reject any specific issue. This reduces customer acquisition costs, and allows personalized marketing or database marketing. However, a requirement of the system is that the business must have in place an accurate, reliable and timely way to manage and track subscriptions.\n\nFrom a marketing-analyst perspective, it has the added benefit that the vendor knows the number of currently active members since a subscription typically involves a contractual agreement. This so-called 'contractual' setting facilitates customer relationship management to a large extent because the analyst knows who is an active customer and who recently churned.\n\nAdditional benefits include a higher average customer lifetime value (ACLV) than that of nonrecurring business models, greater customer inertia and a more committed customer base as it transitions from purchase to opt-out decisions, and more potential for upselling and cross-selling other products or services.\n\nSome software companies such as Adobe and Autodesk have moved from a perpetual licensing model to a subscription model, known as \"software as a service.\" This move has significant implications for sales and customer support organizations. Over time, the need to close large deals decreases resulting in lower sales costs. However the size of the customer support organization increases so that the paying customers stay happy.\n\nConsumers may find subscriptions convenient if they believe that they will buy a product on a regular basis and that they might save money. For repeated delivery of the product or service, the customer also saves time.\n\nSubscriptions which exist to support clubs and organizations call their subscribers \"members\" and they are given access to a group with similar interests. An example might be the Computer Science Book Club.\n\nSubscription pricing can make it easier to pay for expensive items, since it can often be paid for over a period of time and thus can make the product seem more affordable. On the other hand, most newspaper and magazine-type subscriptions are paid upfront, and this might actually prevent some customers from signing up.\n\nAn unlimited use subscription to a service for a fixed price may be an advantage for consumers using those services frequently. However, it could be a disadvantage to a customer who plans to use the service frequently, but later does not. The commitment to paying for a package may have been more expensive than a single purchase would have been. In addition, subscription models increase the possibility of vendor lock-in, which can have fatally business-critical implications for a customer if its business depends on the availability of a software: For example, without an online connection to a licensing server to verify the licensing status every once in a while, a software under a subscription-model would typically stop functioning or fall back to the functionality of a freemium version, thereby making it impossible (to continue) to use the software in remote places or in particularly secure environments without internet access, after the vendor has stopped supporting the version or software, or even has gone out of business thereby leaving the customer without a chance to renew the subscription and access his own data or designs maintained with the software (in some businesses it is important to have full access even to old files for decades). Also, consumers may find repeated payments to be onerous.\n\nSubscription models often require or allow the business to gather substantial amounts of information from the customer (such as magazine mailing lists) and this raises issues of privacy.\n\nA subscription model may be beneficial for the software buyer if it forces the supplier to improve its product. Accordingly, a psychological phenomenon may occur when a customer renews a subscription, that may not occur during a one-time transaction: if the buyer is not satisfied with the service, he/she can simply leave the subscription to expire and find another seller.\n\nThis is in contrast to many one-time transactions, when customers are forced to make significant commitments through high software prices. Some feel that historically, the \"one-time-purchase\" model does not give sellers incentive to maintain relationships with their customers (after all, why should they care once they've received their money?). Some who favor a subscription model for software do so because it may change this situation.\n\nThe subscription model should align customer and vendor toward common goals, as both stand to benefit if the customer receives value from the subscription. The customer that receives value is more likely to renew the subscription and possibly at an increased rate. The customer that does not receive value will, in theory, return to the marketplace.\n\nA customer who is placed in a jail or prison can be billed continuously for subscription services which may render them without funds upon release.\n\nBecause customers may not need or want all the items received, this can lead to waste and an adverse effect on the environment, depending on the products. Greater volumes of production, greater energy and natural resource consumption, and subsequently greater disposal costs are incurred.\n\nSubscription models might also create the opposite effect. This can be illustrated by subscribing to a service for mowing lawns. The effective use of a single mower increases when mowing for a collection of homes, instead of every family owning their own lawnmower which is not used as much as the service providing mower, the use of resources for producing lawnmowers, therefore, decreases while lawns stay cut.\n\n"}
{"id": "65782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65782", "title": "Teichoscopy", "text": "Teichoscopy\n\nTeichoscopy or teichoscopia, meaning \"viewing from the walls,\" is a recurring narrative strategy in ancient Greek literature. One famous instance of teichoscopy occurs in Homer's \"Iliad,\" Book 3, lines 121-244.\n\nThe passage begins with Helen approached in her chamber by Iris, disguised as her sister-in-law Laodice, the daughter of Priam. Helen is then led to the walls of the Skaian gates, where she is summoned by Priam, who asks her to point out the Achaean heroes she sees on the Trojan plain. Below her, the two armies are preparing for the duel between Menelaus and Paris. Helen identifies Agamemnon, Odysseus, Telamonian (Greater) Ajax, and Idomeneus. She also mentions that she does not see her brothers Castor and Pollux, who unbeknownst to her are already dead back in Greece. After this scene, the duel commences, with both armies praying to Zeus and the rest of the gods on Olympus to open the action.\n\nAccording to Maria C. Pantelia, Helen becomes the 'author' of a catalog when she describes for Priam the qualities of the most important Greek warriors.\" It has been suggested that the teichoscopy, as well as the duel between Paris and Menelaus, would have more likely occurred at the beginning of the war rather than during its tenth year. However, although Homer is not at the beginning of the Trojan War, he is at the beginning of the poem and therefore uses the teichoscopia as a poetic structure that provides information and suspense important for the remainder of the play and the duel to come.\n\nAlthough teichoscopy can be viewed as simply a vignette that surveys the major Greek warriors, it has been suggested that Homer is also trying to reveal something about Helen. Helen’s open admiration of both the Greek and Trojan warriors is viewed as ironic, as it seems odd that the major cause of a war that has brought devastation to the Trojans should praise the enemy. However, by doing this, Homer is, according to Frederic Will, “insisting on the importance, and centrality, of Helen’s viewpoint. He is integrating a traditional form artistically.”\n\nThe main object of teichoscopy is the synchronous discussion of events, as opposed to events being reported later by messengers or other eyewitnesses. It is a well-established technique in dramaturgy.\n\nNatural phenomena, too, may be conveyed by this device. Far-off drama such as the sun rising, or a description of stars across the firmament lend themselves to this treatment.\n"}

The screenplay by Ron Nyswaner is based on the 1925 novel of the same title by W. Somerset Maugham. Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, Toby Jones, Anthony Wong Chau Sang and Liev Schreiber appear in the leading roles.\n\nThis is the third film adaptation of the Maugham book, following a 1934 film starring Greta Garbo and Herbert Marshall and a 1957 version called \"The Seventh Sin\" with Bill Travers and Eleanor Parker.\n\nOn a brief trip back to London, earnest, bookish bacteriologist Walter Fane (Edward Norton) is dazzled by Kitty Garstin (Naomi Watts), a vain London socialite. He proposes; she accepts (\"only to get as far away from [her] mother as possible\"), and the couple honeymoon in Venice. They travel on to Walter's medical post in Shanghai, where he is stationed in a government lab studying infectious diseases. They find themselves ill-suited, with Kitty much more interested in parties and the social life of the British expatriates.\n\nKitty meets Charles Townsend (Liev Schreiber), a married British vice consul, and the two engage in a clandestine affair. When Walter discovers his wife's infidelity, he seeks to punish her by threatening to divorce her on the grounds of adultery, if she doesn't accompany him to a small village in a remote area of China. He has volunteered to treat victims of an unchecked cholera epidemic sweeping through the area. Kitty begs to be allowed to divorce him quietly, but he refuses, stating \"Why should I put myself through the smallest trouble for you?\" She hopes Townsend will leave his wife Dorothy and marry her. When she proposes this possibility to Charles, he declines to accept, despite earlier claiming to love Kitty.\n\nShe is compelled to travel to the mountainous inland region with her husband. They embark upon an arduous, two-week-long overland journey, which would be considerably faster and much easier if they traveled by river, but Walter is determined to make Kitty as unhappy and uncomfortable as possible. Upon their arrival in Mei-tan-fu, she is distressed to discover they will be living in near-squalor, far removed from everyone except their cheerful neighbor Waddington, a British deputy commissioner living with Wan Xi (Lu Yan), a young Chinese woman, in relative opulence.\n\nWalter and Kitty barely speak to each other and, except for a cook and a Chinese soldier assigned to guard her, she is alone for long hours. After visiting an orphanage run by a group of French nuns, Kitty volunteers her services, and she is assigned to work in the music room. She is surprised to learn from the Mother Superior that her husband loves children, especially babies. In this setting, she begins to see him in a new light as she learns what a selfless and caring person he can be. When he sees her with the children, he in turn realizes she is not the shallow, selfish person he thought her to be. As Walter's anger and Kitty's unhappiness subside, their marriage begins to blossom in the midst of the epidemic crisis. She soon learns she is pregnant, but is unsure who the father is. Walter – in love with Kitty again – assures her it doesn't matter.\n\nThe cholera epidemic takes many victims. As Walter and the locals are starting to get it under control, due to his importation of clean water through a system of aqueducts (as the local people did not understand water-borne infectious disease) cholera-carrying refugees from elsewhere pour into the area, forcing Walter to set up a camp outside town. He contracts the disease and Kitty lovingly nurses him, but he dies, and she is devastated. Bereft and pregnant, she leaves China.\n\nFive years later, Kitty appears well-dressed and happy in London shopping with her young son Walter. They meet Townsend by chance on the street, and he suggests that Kitty meet with him. Asking young Walter his age, he realizes from the reply that he might be the boy's father. Kitty rejects his overtures and walks away. When her son asks who Townsend is, she replies \"No one important, darling\".\n\n\nPrior to 1999, producer Sara Colleton sought to develop a script for \"The Painted Veil\". The script was frequently redrafted, being written to be close to the source material, to take liberties with the source material, and to create a feminist version. Actor Edward Norton became involved with the project in 1999. Norton explained his attraction to the project, \"It's very much a story about people getting beyond the worst in themselves and figuring out how to look at each other honestly, forgive each other for their failings and get to a better place... When I read it, I was very affected by it because in it I saw my own failings.\" The actor suggested casting Naomi Watts for the role of Kitty, which did not happen until Watts proved herself a bankable star with her performances in \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001) and \"21 Grams\" (2003). When Watts joined the project, she recommended director John Curran, with whom she had collaborated on the 2004 film \"We Don't Live Here Anymore\". The director's expertise with \"We Don't Live Here Anymore\" convinced Watts and Norton that he would be capable of depicting the dysfunctional relationship in \"The Painted Veil\". The project began development at producers Bob Yari and Mark Gordon's Stratus Film Company, but when Stratus executive Mark Gill left to start Warner Independent Pictures, he brought the project with him. Gill began production of the film in partnership with Yari. Gill was later fired before the film's completion by Warner Bros. production president Jeff Robinov, which later led to the film's marketing difficulties.\n\nYari and Warner Independent Pictures collaborated with a Chinese partner who was granted approval over the script and the finished film. The partnership permitted a budget of $19 million for \"The Painted Veil\". When the Chinese production company reviewed the film, it was unhappy with the depiction of the Chinese uprising and the cholera victims, requesting that the scenes be revised. Norton and Curran expressed concerns that their studio accepted the censorship too quickly, with the director threatening to remove his name from the film. Their pressure resulted in limiting cuts from the film to only 38 seconds' worth.\n\nScreenwriter Ron Nyswaner and Norton collaborated on the screenplay for the film. The 1925 novel by author W. Somerset Maugham was considered one-dimensional, so Norton altered the story so the character Walter Fane had a more enhanced role. The character was also rewritten to make his peace with his wife Kitty, leading to them falling in love with each other. Norton explained, \"I like to think that we didn't change the book so much as liberate it. We just imagined it on a slightly bigger scale, and made external some of what is internal in the novel.\" Norton described the novel as \"almost unremittingly bleak\" and believed that the author had thought that British colonials were unlikely to change. The actor explained of the change to the story, \"I went on the assumption that if you were willing to allow Walter and Kitty to grow... you had the potential for a love story that was both tragic and meaningful.\" Norton considered \"The Painted Veil\" to be in the spirit of films like \"Out of Africa\" (1985) and \"The English Patient\" (1996), seeing it as \"rooted in really looking at the way that men and women hurt each other\".\n\nDirector John Curran suggested setting the film during 1925, when the events of the Chinese nationalist movement were taking place. Norton, who had studied Chinese history at Yale University, agreed with the suggestion. To detail scenes from the time period, Curran, Norton, and Nyswaner relied on excerpts from historian Jonathan Spence's 1969 book \"To Change China\", which covered the inept efforts of Western advisers during these years. Norton described the character Walter Fane served as \"the proxy for the arrogance of Western rationalism\", explaining about Fane's confusion at the lack of gratitude for his help, \"Walter means well, but he's the folly of empire, and that adds a whole new dimension to what happens in the story. It's a metaphor for the way empires get crushed.\"\n\nFilming took place on location in Shanghai, China. The director did not want to build a set for the cholera-stricken village, instead seeking out an untouched parcel of land in China. He found Huang Yao Ancient Town (黄姚古镇 - huáng yáo gǔ zhèn) in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which served as the location for the village. The director described the location, \"Even the Chinese crew members were amazed at the place we found... It was like going back in time.\" According to Nyswaner, a large amount of time of the film production was spent negotiating with the Chinese government for the completion of the film, as there were disagreements over issues in the script. Most of the film was shot in Guangxi. Director John Curran commented, \"We wanted this movie to be distinctly Chinese. We didn’t want it to look like a film that you could shoot in Canada or Mexico or Italy.\" After a search of location in Hunan province, the scouts chose the location in Guangxi for the film. Line producer Antonia Barnard states that initially the film, like the novel, was going to be set in Hong Kong; however, the crew realized Hong Kong of the time period would be difficult to replicate, thus the story was altered so it would take place in Shanghai; the crew shot \"Shanghai for Shanghai in the period, and shot London scenes in Shanghai as well.\"\n\nThe official soundtrack is composed by Alexandre Desplat.\n\n\nThere are also three songs not listed on the official soundtrack. All of them are performed by the Choir of the Beijing Takahashi Culture and Art Centre: \n\nThe film's post-production schedule was initially slated to conclude in late summer 2006, but did not finish until November. According to Laura Kim, the marketing and publicity head of Warner Independent Pictures, the delay slowed award and media recognition for the film. Other studios were duplicating DVDs of their films for awards organizations, so \"The Painted Veil\" was unable to get first priority in processing. When \"The Painted Veil\" experienced a limited release in the United States on December 20, 2006 in the cities of Los Angeles and New York City, the meager marketing campaign for the film was criticized. The lack of attention caused half a dozen people associated with the film to complain about how Warner Independent Pictures was conducting the marketing campaign. Film critic Rex Reed of \"The New York Observer\" wrote, \"Nobody can understand why Warner Independent Pictures is keeping this movie such a secret; it is filled with Oscar possibilities that should be shouted from the rooftops.\"\n\nThe firing of Mark Gill, one of the initial producers of \"The Painted Veil\" who brought it to Warner Independent Pictures, was cited as a reason for the small scale of the film's marketing campaign. Director John Curran explained about the move to Warner Independent, \"Any transition is not going to be ideal. When the guy who has gotten you on board is gone, you're kind of exposed.\" Others also criticized the studio for not providing a large enough marketing budget, pointing out that the previous year's \"Good Night, and Good Luck\" had a more successful campaign with television and newspaper ads. \"The Painted Veil\" was eventually able to expand to 23 more markets on December 29, 2006, with additional cities on January 5, 2007. Warner Independent also hosted 80 screenings of \"The Painted Veil\" in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and London, as well as to various Hollywood guilds, to promote the film.\n\n\"The Painted Veil\" initially had a limited release in four theaters in the United States on December 20, 2006, grossing $51,086 over the opening weekend. The film gradually expanded its showings in the United States and Canada, peaking at 287 theaters on the weekend of January 26, 2007. \"The Painted Veil\" ultimately grossed $8,060,487 in the United States and Canada and $14,525,904 in other territories for a worldwide total of $22,586,391.\n\nOn the film review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, \"The Painted Veil\" has received a 74% 'fresh' rating based on 143 reviews. On the similar website Metacritic, the film has received a metascore of 69 out of 100 based on 33 reviews, considered generally favorable reviews.\n\nManohla Dargis of \"The New York Times\" said the story seems \"so unlikely for modern adaptation, particularly when, as is the case here, it hasn’t been refitted with a contemporary hook or allegory for audiences who wouldn’t know Maugham from Edna Ferber. Instead, as nicely directed by John Curran and adapted to the screen by Ron Nyswaner, this version of the story lulls you by turning Maugham’s distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance. Even better, the new film gives us ample opportunity to spend time with Ms. Watts, whose remarkable talent helps keep movie faith and love alive, even in the tinniest, tiniest vehicles . . . An inveterate stealer and masticator of scenes, Mr. Norton is very fine here, especially early on, before his billing gets the better of the story and he begins riding around heroically on horseback . . . Whether through craft or constitution, [he] invests Walter with a petty cruelty that makes his character’s emotional thaw and Kitty’s predicament all the more poignant.\"\n\nCarina Chocano of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said the film \"has all the elements in place to be a great epic, but it fails to connect, to paraphrase Maugham's contemporary E.M. Forster, the prose with the passion. It's impeccable, but leaves you cold.\"\n\nPeter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" rated the film three out of four stars and commented, \"If you're suspecting this third movie version of W. Somerset Maugham's 1925 novel may carry the infectious dullness of prestige filmmaking, rest easy . . . the film is a period piece propelled by emotions accessible to a modern audience . . . \"The Painted Veil\" has the power and intimacy of a timeless love story. By all means, let it sweep you away.\"\n\nMeghan Keane of the \"New York Sun\" said the film \"may at times threaten to fall into an abyss of sentimentality, and it has moments that seem mere transitions to propel the plot, but it manages a charming historic portrait without insulting the audience's intelligence.\"\n\nTodd McCarthy of \"Variety\" thought the story \"feels remote and old-school despite a frankness the two previous film versions lacked.\" He added, \"Present scripter Ron Nyswaner makes some solid fundamental decisions, beginning with the telescoping down to the barest minimum the London-set opening . . . All the same, the film is still dominated by the stuffy, repressed personality of Fane, whose emotional stonewalling of his wife produces a stifling of Kitty's naturally more vivacious, if common, personality. Despite the extremes of human experience on view, there is a certain blandness to them as they play out, a sensation matched by the eye-catching but picture-postcard-like presentation of the settings . . . Even the ultra-capable Norton and Watts aren't fully able to galvanize viewer interest in their narrowly self-absorbed characters.\"\n\nComposer Alexandre Desplat won the 2006 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score. Desplat also won an award for Best Original Score from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association for both \"The Painted Veil\" and \"The Queen\" (2006).\n\nRon Nyswaner won the National Board of Review Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Screenplay but lost to Jason Reitman for \"Thank You for Smoking\".\n\nEdward Norton was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead but lost to Ryan Gosling in \"Half Nelson\".

Hamlet is reflecting, at first admiringly, and then despairingly, on the human condition.\n\nThe soliloquy, spoken in the play by Prince Hamlet to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in Act II, Scene 2, follows in its entirety. Rather than appearing in blank verse, the typical mode of composition of Shakespeare's plays, the speech appears in straight prose:\n\nHamlet is saying that although humans may appear to think and act \"nobly\" they are essentially \"dust\". Hamlet is expressing his melancholy to his old friends over the difference between the best that men aspire to be, and how they actually behave; the great divide that depresses him.\n\nThe speech was fully omitted from Nicholas Ling's 1603 First Quarto, which reads simply:\n\nThis version has been argued to have been a bad quarto, a tourbook copy, or an initial draft. By the 1604 Second Quarto, the speech is essentially present but punctuated differently:\n\nThen, by the 1623 First Folio, it appeared as:\n\nJ. Dover Wilson, in his notes in the \"New Shakespeare\" edition, observed that the Folio text \"involves two grave difficulties\", namely that according to Elizabethan thought angels could apprehend but not act, making \"in action how like an angel\" nonsensical, and that \"express\" (which as an adjective means \"direct and purposive\") makes sense applied to \"action\", but goes very awkwardly with \"form and moving\".\n\nThese difficulties are remedied if we read it thus:\n\nA source well known to Shakespeare is Psalm 8, especially verse 5: \"You have made [humans] a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned them with glory and honor.\"\n\nScholars have pointed out this section's similarities to lines written by Montaigne:\n\nHowever, rather than being a direct influence on Shakespeare, Montaigne may have merely been reacting to the same general atmosphere of the time, making the source of these lines one of context rather than direct influence.\n\n\n\n"}
