{"id": "50735545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50735545", "title": "Agents of Mayhem", "text": "Agents of Mayhem\n\nAgents of Mayhem is an open world action-adventure video game developed by Volition and published by Deep Silver. The game was released in August 2017 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The game's themes are based on Saturday-morning cartoons and superhero films. It is set in the same fictional universe as Volition's \"Saints Row\" series, and includes several plot and character crossovers.\n\n\"Agents of Mayhem\" is an action-adventure open world game played from a third-person perspective. The game takes place in a futuristic version of Seoul, South Korea, billed as \"the city of tomorrow\". The game features twelve agents, and players can choose any three to complete missions and explore the world. The agents are comprised in four trios: the Bombshells (Italian engineer Joule, Indian immunologist Rama, and German football hooligan Red Card); the Carnage a Trois (American field strategist Braddock, American derby driver Daisy, and Russian \"Cold Warrior\" under the alias \"Yeti\"); the Firing Squad (American gang leader Pierce Washington under the alias \"Kingpin\", Japanese hitman Oni, and Middle Eastern assassin Scheherazade); and the Franchise Force (Colombian former sky pirate Fortune, United States Navy chief petty officer Hardtack, and Canadian actor and proclaimed \"Face of Mayhem\" Hollywood). Three additional agents are provided via downloadable content: Seoul police lieutenant Johnny Gat; Moroccan soldier Fatima Daoud, also known as \"Lazarus\"; and genius hacker Kinzie Kensington, under the alias \"Safeword\".\n\nEach agent has their own unique play-style and abilities. For instance, Hardtack uses shotgun as his primary weapon, while Hollywood utilizes his assault rifle. As players deal damage to enemies with their weapons, players accumulate points that will fill up a bar. When the bar is filled, players can utilize the agents' Mayhem abilities, which are superpower moves that greatly aid player in combat. Different agents have different mayhem abilities. For example, Fortune can use her drone, GLORY to stun enemies, while Hollywood can trigger massive explosions around him. Players can switch between the three agents they have selected freely, and experiment with different combinations of agents to see which trio of characters suit their playstyle the most. Movement in the game is fast. The agents can triple-jump around the city or use cars to traverse the game's world.\n\nIn addition to main campaign missions, there will also be unlock missions, which unlock new agents for players to control, and personal missions, which delves into the back-story of these agents. Different agents will have different personality, and their responses to in-game events vary. As the player progresses in the game, the agents will gain experience points, cash, skills, new gadgets, and mods that enhance their combat efficiency. There are also cosmetic customization options for the agents and the weapons featured in the game.\n\n\"Agents of Mayhem\" is set in a shared universe alongside Volition's \"Saints Row\" and \"Red Faction\" series, taking place after the \"recreate Earth\" ending of the \"Saints Row IV\" stand-alone expansion, \"\". The game's plot revolves around an organization known as M.A.Y.H.E.M. (Multinational Agency Hunting Evil Masterminds), founded by Persephone Brimstone (a character first seen in \"Gat out of Hell\") and funded by the Ultor Corporation (one of the main antagonists of \"Saints Row 2\" and the \"Red Faction\" series, later merging with the Saints in \"\"). Bearing the Saints' purple fleur-de-lis logo, M.A.Y.H.E.M's goal is to stop supervillain organization L.E.G.I.O.N. (the League of Evil Gentlemen Intent on Obliterating Nations) from destroying the world's nations. The game is set in a near-future version of Seoul, South Korea.\n\nIn the backstory, Persephone Brimstone was once part of the supervillain organization L.E.G.I.ON and part of their plans for world conquest, as well as married to the Minister of Envy. Persephone learned that L.E.G.I.O.N's leader, the Morningstar plotted to harvest the power of Dark Matter to alter reality and ascend into godhood. Persephone put a stop to those plans and took off with an airship called the ARK, and in retaliation, L.E.G.I.O.N. and her husband launched an attack on her home city of Paris. Having turned against L.E.G.I.O.N completely, Persephone used whatever recourses she could get her hands on to form M.A.Y.H.E.M and take revenge on L.E.G.I.O.N. \n\nL.E.G.I.O.N would later reveal themselves to the public with a world wide attack to topple the world’s governments. This event would later be called \"Devil's Night\" and would play into the backstories of many of M.A.Y.H.E.M's agents, such as the Franchise Force, consisting of Rod \"Hollywood\" Stone, a former actor turned self proclaimed \"face\" of M.A.Y.H.E.M; Marina \"Fortune\" Santos, a sky pirate who was recruited when Persephone was impressed with her thieving skills; and Ishmael \"Hardtrack\" Funderburke, a former Navy officer whose ship was destroyed by L.E.G.I.O.N. Other agents include Janel Braddock, a former drill sergeant and girlfriend to Persephone's right hand woman Friday; Piper \"Daisy\" Andrews, an ill tempered derby girl and Hollywood's on again off again girlfriend; Cosima \"Joule\" Bellini, a fashion model and brilliant engineer; Masamune \"Oni\" Senichi, a Yakuza assassin who turned against his crime family when he learnt they were working for L.E.G.I.O.N; Pranati \"Rama\" Malhotra, an immunologist who seeks to find a cure for a plague L.E.G.I.O.N set loose upon India; Ingo \"Red Card\" Rotkapp, a crazed soccer fan who incited a riot to fight off a L.E.G.I.O.N attack; and an enigmatic assassin that goes by Scheherazade. This game also features \"Saints Row\" characters as playable agents, such as Pierce Washington, who has become the kingpin of Stillwater, and united the gangs to fight off a L.E.G.I.O.N attack; and Ji-hoon “Johnny” Gat, who has become a police lieutenant with the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency. The events of Devil's Night put Johnny in a coma. When he woke up, he found that he was the sole survivor of the SMPA, which has been replaced by robot cops.\n\nAt the start of the game, Persephone sets up M.A.Y.H.E.M in Seoul, South Korea where they track down Dr. Babylon, the ambitious leader of the Ministry of Pride for L.E.G.I.O.N. who plans on harvesting a giant dark matter crystal from a comet. The Franchise Force is sent to kill him but fail. To distract M.A.Y.H.E.M, Babylon uses his lieutenant Hammersmith to cause destruction around Seoul to distract M.A.Y.H.E.M before Hammersmith is defeated by the agents. Babylon then uses August Gaunt, a young singer and another one of his lieutenants to brainwash his fans and attempt to turn the city of Seoul against M.A.Y.H.E.M, but the agents confront him at his concert and shut down his technology, exposing Gaunt as a fraud. \n\nM.A.Y.H.E.M then plans to retrieve a sentient computer program called AISHA, a virtual female idol group that L.E.G.I.O.N is using as a virus, but one of Babylon's cybernetic lieutenants by the name of Steeltoe falls in love with AISHA and starts a relationship with her. Steeltoe and AISHA intend to merge their AI's, but Steeltoe is killed by M.A.Y.H.E.M'S agents at their \"wedding\". A vengeful AISHA, led by their red avatar, begin a smear campaign against M.A.Y.H.E.M, eventually taking to creating a musical single that would kill its listeners, before eventually starting an attack on the ARK'S computer programs. The other AISHA's realize how unstable Red Aisha is, but most of them are killed leaving only the Red and Purple AISHA. The Purple AISHA willingly defects to M.A.Y.H.E.M as their agents destroy the Red AISHA. \n\nGetting desperate, Babylon sends in Ariadne, the brilliant daughter of a scientist Babylon killed before trying to brainwash her with a microchip. Ariadne overcomes the microchip, but the effort drove her insane and she plots revenge on Babylon. Ariadne launches robot attacks on Seoul, and abducts multiple people, including M.A.Y.H.E.M's technological engineer Katy \"Gremlin\" Fox. The agents go on to rescue Gremlin, but while they are successful, Ariadne manages to escape before cutting the microchip out of her head. \n\nFinally, M.A.Y.H.E.M seek to find Bablyon's giant robot called Project Damocles, but when they eventually uncover it, Babylon launces a city wide attack, and even an attack on the ARK before commandeering Damocles and extracting the dark matter crystal. It's then revealed that Ariadne had placed her microchip in Damocles to drive Babylon insane as revenge. This backfires, when Babylon realizes he now has the ultimate power in L.E.G.I.O.N and goes on a bid to usurp the Morningstar and remake reality in his image. Babylon uses Damocles to go on a rampage and the power of the dark matter crystal to begin to rewrite reality where he rules the world. The agents enter the rift to battle Babylon and his recreated minions, and eventually destroy the dark matter crystal. With the crystal destroyed, reality goes back to normal as the Damocles crashes to the Earth. Babylon and the agents survive the crash, but Babylon is taken and presumably killed by L.E.G.I.O.N enforcer Marcus Longinus as punishment for his failure, while Persephone has M.A.Y.H.E.M pull out of Seoul.\n\nDevelopment of the game began shortly after the release of \"Saints Row IV\". The game began its development cycle as some concept art and character descriptions, and after receiving positive comments from outsiders who have listened to their pitch, one of whom described it as \"G.I. Joe versus Cobra Megafight 2020\", the game soon entered full production. Unlike previous \"Saints Row\" games, which have only one player-controlled protagonist, \"Agents of Mayhem\" introduces multiple playable characters. This was done because Volition reflected on some of their previous fan events, where fans opted to cosplay as the supporting characters rather than the central character. They considered it an evidence to show that fans of the franchise would be interested in a character-focused game. Another reason is that the company, inspired by \"League of Legends\" and \"Dota 2\", wanted players to form a strong connection with the characters. Volition also thought that the game, being a single-player title, has a great advantage, since most games with a diverse cast of characters are multiplayer-focused. The game's tone and style was inspired by 1980s action cartoons such as \"G.I. Joe\", \"He-Man\", and television series like \"The A-Team\".\n\nIn 2014, after receiving $200,000 in incentives from the city of Champaign, Illinois, Volition began hiring upwards of 100 employees to begin work on a new project. Little was known about this game until a trademark for \"Agents of Mayhem\" filed by Koch Media (Deep Silver's parent company) was discovered in May 2016, along with résumés linking the project to Volition. Further speculation arose from a 2013 Polygon interview with Volition's Scott Phillips, referring to \"Saints Row\" players as \"agent[s] of mayhem\". The game was formally announced on June 6, 2016 with a cinematic announcement trailer released via IGN. \"Agents of Mayhem\" was released in North America on August 15, 2017 and in Europe on August 18, 2017.\n\n\"Agents of Mayhem\" received \"mixed or average\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nNick Valdez's 7/10 score on \"Destructoid\" stated that the game was \"Solid and definitely has an audience. There could be some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun.\"\n\n5/10 was Alice Bell's score on VideoGamer.com, who said \"Despite fun combat and characters, \"Agents of Mayhem\" becomes repetitive and grinding. In trying to chase the popularity of Saints Row, it misses having an identity of its own.\"\n\nMichael Goroff's score of 7/10 on \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" said that \"\"Agents of Mayhem\" is one of those games with so much potential that just doesn’t quite reach the heights it probably could. That being said, it’s exhilarating combat and unique character system have me looking forward to a more polished, more fully conceived sequel.\"\n\nConnor Sheridan said on GamesRadar \"Hero-swapping tactics add a unique edge to third-person combat, while humor and heart elevate Agents of Mayhem's typical world-saving fundamentals to memorable heights,\" and awarded it a score of 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nDan Ryckert from Giant Bomb gave the game a score of 2 out of 5 stars saying that \"It may share a genre and universe with \"Saints Row\", but \"Agents of Mayhem\" is a lifeless husk of Volition's prior work.\"\n\n\"With fun combat and a likable cast, \"Agents of Mayhem\" leans too heavily on repetitive fights to be truly heroic,\" was Jon Ryan's conclusion on IGN with a score of 7.1/10.\n\n\"PC Gamer\"s Jon Morcom scored the game a 67/100 with the consensus that it \"Serves up a generous range of play styles, but it’s hampered by repetitive levels and a few uninspired design choices.\"\n\nJustin McElroy of \"Polygon\" awarded it 5.5/10 stating that \"This has likely started to feel like a litany of sins rather than cogent critique, but it’s the best way I have of illustrating \"Agent of Mayhem\"'s failings. It is not felled by any one thing, but is rather undone by a thousand little cuts. \"Agents of Mayhem\" heaps theoretical fun on you. Characters, powers, upgrades, tons of missions — it’s desperate for the player to just have fun. It’s a noble impulse, but one that it’s depressingly incapable of consistently delivering on.\n\nBrett Todd, in a review for GameSpot, concluded \"there's little to \"Agents of Mayhem\" beyond its foul-mouthed and bombastic attitude, which push the game into grating and obnoxious territory. Throw in the poor mission design and bugs, and you've got a game with loads of mayhem, but not much else.\"\n\nBen \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw of \"Zero Punctuation\" ranked it fifth on his list of the Blandest Games of 2017. The game was nominated for \"Performance in a Comedy, Supporting\" with Eliza Schneider as Agent Rama, and for \"Writing in a Comedy\" at the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards.\n"}

The concept predated the phrase; Neil Sedaka made it big in Japan with \"One Way Ticket\" before breaking through in his native United States, while Jimmy Osmond, typically a side show to his older brothers The Osmonds in North America and Europe, cut several tracks in Japanese and received several gold records for his recordings.\n\nIn the late 20th century, notable \"big in Japan\" artists included several stadium rock bands from the United States, metal artists from Northern European countries such as Norway, Denmark, and especially Sweden and Finland (e.g. the rock band Hanoi Rocks), eurobeat artists from Austria, Germany and especially Italy, and UK rock artists.\n\nSome bands have used their popularity in Japan as a springboard to break into other audiences. Notably, the power pop group Cheap Trick, which had been known as the \"American Beatles\" in Japan for their appeal, achieved widespread success with their multi-platinum live album \"Cheap Trick at Budokan\". The band had previously struggled to break into the mainstream American market with their earlier albums. Furthermore, like Cheap Trick, some bands have lost their \"big in Japan\" titles after gaining popularity in their respective homelands. The most notable example is Bon Jovi.\n\nFor example, Scorpions initially had only mediocre success in Europe and the United States, yet were \"Big in Japan\", as evidenced by their 1978 tour of the country and the double live album \"Tokyo Tapes\". Another example is The Ventures, a band formed in 1959 and touring Japan each year since 1965, having logged over 2,000 concerts there by 2006. \"Being 'Big in Japan' turned into a positive sign of their closeness to the hearts of Japanese people, with the band embedded in national and local rock cultures.\"\n\nSwedish band The Spotnicks toured Japan in 1966 after their song \"Karelia\" topped the Japanese charts the year prior, with hardly any promotion of the band. Around this time, the band's popularity in Europe had been waning due to changed taste in music, particularly in their home country where they had relatively few hits, none of them topping the charts. They went on a few more tours there in the late '60s and occasionally toured there in the '70s, '80s and for the last time in 1998. While their popularity in Japan is small compared to the one of The Ventures, \"Karelia\" is considered a classic song.\n\nThe phrase was used as the name of a UK punk band active from 1977 to 1982 (whose name inspired the title of a 1984 hit single by new wave band Alphaville) and was the name of the lead track on the Grammy-winning 1999 album \"Mule Variations\" by Tom Waits. The mockumentary \"This is Spinal Tap\" parodies this phenomenon when the band schedules a Japanese tour after discovering that their single \"Sex Farm\" is inexplicably selling very well there.\n\nAmerican band Mountain reformed for a successful tour of Japan in 1973. A live album titled \"Twin Peaks\" was released in 1974. Mountain bass player and vocalist Felix Pappalardi then worked with the Japanese band Creation in 1976.\n\nIt has also been used in sports, for instance, to describe Major League Baseball players who join Japanese clubs at the end of their careers, such as Daryl Spencer.\n\nThe derivative phrase \"small in Japan\", originally used for AC/DC, has been used since the early 1980s. In general, a small-in-Japan artist holds significant popularity in the Western world (in most cases the United States), and visits Japan many times to promote himself/herself, yet is almost unknown and unsuccessful in Japan despite being heavily featured by Japanese music media.\n\nIn Japanese culture, the phrase \"small in Japan\" is also used to describe Japanese celebrities who are unknown, unsuccessful or \"forgotten\" in Japan but making their ways outside Japan. The phrase has been used to refer to certain musicians such as Dir En Grey, certain professional wrestlers such as Yoshihiro Tajiri and Yoshitatsu, certain fashion models such as Ai Tominaga and Tao Okamoto, and all the Miss Universe contestants from Japan, most of whom are former unsuccessful fashion models, including Kurara Chibana and Riyo Mori.\n\nIn one exceptional case, \"Digital Arts\" magazine has used the phrase to describe the Xbox, a video game console that was a success all over the world except in Japan.\n\n"}
{"id": "433329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=433329", "title": "Blob (comics)", "text": "Blob (comics)\n\nThe Blob (Frederick J. \"Fred\" Dukes) is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is usually depicted as an adversary of the X-Men. A mutant originally depicted as an obese circus freak, the Blob claims to be immovable when he so desires. He possesses an extreme amount of pliable body mass, which grants him superhuman strength. Possessing the mindset of a bully, he mostly uses his powers for petty crime and as a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants and Freedom Force. He is one of the most prominent, long-running mutants to be depowered as a result of the \"Decimation\" storyline.\n\nThe Blob appears in the 2009 superhero film \"\", where he is played by actor Kevin Durand.\n\nCreated by writer Stan Lee and artist/co-writer Jack Kirby, he first appeared in \"X-Men\" #3 (January 1964).\n\nBorn in Lubbock, Texas, Fred J. Dukes starts out as a member of a circus sideshow under the name \"The Blob\". His act would be others trying to move him. He is detected and contacted by Charles Xavier via Cyclops, who sees his performance and tells him that he (Dukes) is a mutant, and asks him to join the X-Men. At the mansion, the other X-Men dislike Dukes for his obnoxious attitude. Iceman uses his power against Dukes to create an ice block round his foot, but the Blob easily escapes. The Blob refuses Xavier's invitation, saying he is better than the other X-Men. When Xavier tries erasing his mind of what has transpired, the Blob escapes the Mansion despite the efforts of the Beast and uses the sewer to get away without being followed. He tells the manager of the carnival he is taking over, then gathers up the other circus members and they attack the mansion, as he plans to get the X-Men's technology and take over the world. Meanwhile, Xavier works on a device so he can erase the memories of many people. The carnival succeeds in defeating the X-Men despite a warning from Angel. They tie up the X-Men and leave them on the lawn. They then enter the mansion to find the Professor and his technology. Xavier telepathically contacts Marvel Girl and tells her to remove her blindfold using her telekinesis, then levitate a knife from a performer's tent to cut through her bonds, after which she frees the other members. Xavier is able to wipe everyone's minds after the carnival is stopped by a wall of ice, and the Blob goes back to the circus.\n\nThe mutant Magneto soon seeks out the Blob to recruit him into his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, restoring his memory through a jarring blow to the head. The Blob temporarily accepts the invitation, but leaves when it is revealed that Magneto has no real concern for the Blob's safety after he is hit by explosives which were launched at the X-Men. He goes back to the Circus. He teams up with Unus due to the alien Lucifer, who soon becomes his confidant. They disguise themselves as X-Men and commit crimes. The Blob also serves as a member of Factor Three. He briefly works as an operative for the Secret Empire, where he fights the Beast. With the reorganized Brotherhood, the Blob fights Professor X and the Defenders. He is reverted to infancy by Alpha the Ultimate Mutant. The Blob is later returned to adulthood, and fights the Champions of Los Angeles.\n\nHe later winds up in prison, but is freed by Mystique in order to recruit him into her incarnation of the Brotherhood. He becomes part of the plot to assassinate Senator Kelly, the event which leads to the apocalyptic alternate future of \"Days of Future Past\". He also battles the Avengers as a member of the Brotherhood. With Unus, he battles the Hulk. With the Brotherhood, he battles the X-Men once more. He witnesses the apparent death of Unus, then goes berserk and attacks Spider-Man and the Black Cat.\n\nHe remains with the Brotherhood, becoming a special operative of the federal government when the Brotherhood is reformed as the government-sponsored Freedom Force. On the team's first mission, they help capture Magneto. They then battle the X-Men in San Francisco. Blob also participates in Freedom Force's capture of the Avengers for the federal government. With Freedom Force, he attempts to capture Rusty Collins, then battles X-Factor. With Freedom Force, he battles the X-Men in San Francisco, and later assists in the attempt to arrest the X-Men in Dallas, battling the New Mutants in Dallas as well. He battles X-Factor again, and under Spiral's orders, he and Pyro battle Daredevil in an attempt to capture a young mutant. He again attempts to arrest Rusty Collins, fighting the New Mutants again. He joins Avalanche and Pyro in attacking Avengers headquarters. With Freedom Force, he finally captures Rusty Collins and fellow New Mutant Skids. He helps to capture Cable, but is defeated by Cable and then by Sunspot during an attempt to recapture Cable. With Freedom Force, he assists in thwarting a jailbreak from the Vault.\n\nAfter Freedom Force's dissolution, the Blob participates in other versions of the Brotherhood, including one led by Toad and another led by Professor X; the Blob takes over as leader of the latter when Xavier leaves.\n\nThe psychic entity Onslaught later recruits Blob, vastly upgrading his powers and abilities (in his powered-up state, his mutation becomes virtually identical to that of Phat). During this time, the Blob fights the various members of X-Force and is soundly defeated in each encounter. Months later, a powered-down Dukes joins the new Brotherhood led once again by Mystique, alongside Toad, Sabretooth, and the daughter of the original Mastermind.\n\nWhen Exodus recreates the Brotherhood of Mutants, Blob offers to join but is quickly dismissed by Exodus, who considers him useless. This is a major blow to Dukes' already weak self-esteem, for which he seeks the counsel of therapist Sean Garrison. After a session, Blob attacks the Xavier Institute, though he is defeated by the combined efforts of the New Mutants and the Hellions. He is then arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nDue to the Scarlet Witch's depowering of 90% of Earth's mutants, the Blob is one of the thousands to lose their power, though his epidermis does not shrink to compensate for his loss of mass, leaving him with huge folds of loose skin. The depressed Blob attempts to commit suicide, but his skin folds prevent him from cutting through to any major blood vessels on his throat or wrists.\n\nSomeone that resembles the Blob is seen apprehended by the Thunderbolts and is seen in the Folding Castle's Detention Quadrant.\n\nBlob later resurfaces as a member of X-Cell, a group of depowered mutants that blames the government for the loss of their powers, attacking Mutant Town in defiance of the Decimation. After mistakenly getting into a fight with Rictor and Multiple Man and getting in a cheap shot on Rictor, he stole a car. With fellow X-Cell member Fatale, he attempted to flee, eventually hitting an open manhole (left open earlier in the day by Strong Guy and Wolfsbane) and causing the car to crash leaving Blob hanging from the car. When both of them ran afoul of Marrow, Blob was thrown from the car.\n\nThrough unknown means, Dukes loses the excess skin and his fortunes turn in his favor. Now known as Freddie Dukes, he has become a weight-loss guru in Japan, and is to star in an upcoming movie filmed in San Francisco made by Kingo Sunen. He is also seen with Magneto and the High Evolutionary.\n\nIn the miniseries \"Magneto: Not a Hero\", Joseph is resurrected under unknown circumstances and forms a new Brotherhood of Mutants with Astra and mutated deformed versions of Blob, Mastermind, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, and Toad. It is soon revealed that these actually are clones created by Joseph.\n\nIn \"Uncanny X-Men\" #16, Fred Dukes is working with Mystique in Genosha and is once again shown as heavily obese and appears to have his powers restored. Mystique has supplied him with Mutant Growth Hormones (MGH) extracted from Dazzler.\n\nBefore being depowered, the Blob's mutant physiology granted him a number of advantages. He had superhuman strength, endurance, and great resistance to physical injury due to a further mutation. The Blob's elastic, blubbery skin proved to be difficult to penetrate by gunfire, missiles, and even Wolverine's claws, though with sufficient force and a favorable angle, the claws can lacerate his flesh. For instance, the Blob once sat on the X-Man, but jumped off in pain when Wolverine extended his sheathed claws into the Blob's rear. On one occasion, a concentrated optic blast fired by Cyclops was sufficient to puncture a hole through his shoulder, much to the shock of Dukes himself. The magic swords of both Black Raazer and the Arabian Knight were able to harm him.\n\nHe could also alter his personal mono-directional gravity field beneath himself to make himself virtually immovable as long as he was in contact with the ground, although an incredible force can uproot him, along with a chunk of whatever he is standing on. The only beings on record to have been able to move the Blob against his wishes are the Hulk, Juggernaut, and Strong Guy (powered-up near his limit by absorbing kinetic energy), although Colossus has managed to lift Dukes by digging underground and raising the piece of earth Dukes stands on, stating this as an exception to his immovability. Magneto once was able to move the Blob by lifting the ground under the Blob's feet via metal pipes. Despite his appearance, the Blob's speed and agility are those of a fairly athletic male of normal stature, a fact which frequently catches his opponents by surprise.\n\nThe Blob's superhuman strength greatly increased over the years, in a manner similar to that of the Thing. This improvement is said to be a result of his ongoing mutation.\n\nThe Blob is vulnerable to attacks directed at his face, as his eyes, nose, mouth, and ears do not have the same protection as the rest of his body. Dukes is also susceptible to psionic attacks and psychic manipulation, and he can be incapacitated by sensory assaults; for example, Banshee was able to render Blob unconscious solely through the use of his sonic scream. On another occasion, Sleepwalker defeated the Blob by using warp beams to wrap a steel girder around the villain, crushing his blubber and causing him great physical pain. The Hulk once took the opposite approach, harming the Blob by grabbing and stretching his flab. While he is all but invulnerable to direct kinetic attacks, such as punches, kicks or gunshots, he is susceptible to concussions and other harm resulting from sufficiently powerful impacts, as Daredevil knocked him out by luring him underneath a massive bell and then having it dropped on him with the aid of a young female mutant.\n\nDukes can be incapacitated by drinking alcohol, although due to his immense mass, a large amount of alcohol is required.\n\nBlob appears briefly in the \"Age of Apocalypse\" as a test subject that Henry McCoy was toying with in the Breeding Pens in a direct violation of the Kelly Pact that Apocalypse signed in order to keep the Human High Council occupied and at bay while he rallied his forces.\n\nMcCoy considered Blob's mutation useless which enraged Blob. Dukes freed himself, and attacked his experimenter. Havok came to McCoy's rescue, but Dukes proved to be even too much for the Prelate to handle. His pseudo freedom was fleeting for moments later the head of the pens, Havok's older brother Cyclops, showed up to deliver a searing optic blast that would put him back in his place.\n\nWhen the Age of Apocalypse was revisited in the 10th anniversary, Blob was a member of Sinister's team known as Sinister Six. It appears that McCoy or Sinister himself had his powers altered in a manner that allowed Blob to project his gravitational field outward. When the Sinister Six met the X-Men in battle, Dukes' new powers were used to sweep the X-Men off their feet with the Silver Samurai receiving a double dose. Quicksilver attempted to fell the behemoth with multiple punches, but Dukes remained standing regardless of how many hits he got in. It was not until Rogue stepped in with a punch that had the power necessary to overtake him that the mammoth would topple over. Following the Sinister Six's defeat, Blob managed to escape.\n\nLater he's seen as a member of the Black Legion, a group of psychotic altered mutants under the supervision of a now insane Weapon X. It is also revealed that he left the Age of Apocalypse timeline and joined Archangel's quest to become the new heir of Apocalypse. He's seen in Akkaba Metropolis under the North Pole and he was the one to prevent the escape of Psylocke.\n\nIn the \"Final Execution Saga\" story line in \"Uncanny X-Force\", Fredrick is part of a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants led by Daken with the aim of taking down X-Force and turning Evan Sabahnur into a new Apocalypse. During the saga the X-Force team is captured and tortured after Nightcrawler from the Age of Apocalypse universe betrays the team, to get his revenge on Fredrick due to him eating his wife Linda. Kurt seemingly succeeds in his goal of revenge by teleporting a live shark into Fredrick's stomach during a fight with him, causing him to be devoured from within.\n\nDeadpool's search for Cable across alternate timelines forces an encounter with the Blob of \"an age of Apocalypse\" (not to be confused with the X-Men story arc of the same name). In this reality, Blob has taken the mantle of Famine, one of the Horsemen of Apocalypse.\n\nPut in an internment camp after Bolivar Trask's rise to power in the \"House of M\" reality, he was freed in Magneto's first major raid on US soil. After being freed, he first took his mutant name, \"Blob\" and was instrumental in the destruction of several Sentinels. He then joined Magneto's mutant group. Blob is seen as a member of the Genoshan Black Ops version of the Marauders. It was later revealed that Dukes is also a member of an NYPD strike team called the Brotherhood.\n\nEric Magnus is Chief of Detectives and Fred appears as a member of his Brotherhood, a cabal of bent policemen. He is initially partnered with rookie Detective Peter Magnus, and later with Detective Mortimer Toynbee.\n\nBlob appears twice in the \"Marvel Zombies\" universe. He is alive when first encountered, but being pursued by several zombie versions of Marvel characters, including Pyro, Black Cat, Iron Fist, Toad and Rhino. He is later seen as a zombie fighting the X-Men.\n\nThe Ultimate Universe version of Blob, real name Franklin Dukes, is a member of the Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy. His powers are similar to that of his Earth-616 counterpart, although he has been moved by a helicopter during the \"Weapon X\" saga, suggesting that he may be less powerful. He seems to eat constantly, and is often seen browsing the internet or chatting to people via instant messaging. One such incident sees the Blob pretend to be a female model/physicist named Naomi who cyber-seduces the X-Man Beast—leading to the discovery of Magneto's survival and to the \"Ultimate War\" saga. Unlike his Earth-616 counterpart, the Blob may very well have additional superhuman-eating powers as part of his mutation, as not only has he threatened to actually eat his enemies alive, but it was expressly stated that he had personally consumed all of the Weapon X computers in a matter of moments when the Brotherhood invaded the Weapon X compound to rescue the X-Men. In \"Ultimatum\", the Blob is seen eating the Wasp, proving the cannibalistic claims are true. However, Hank Pym grows to a gigantic size and bites the Blob's head off in return.\n\nIt has been revealed that Blob was Liz Allan's estranged genetic father after she discovered her own mutant abilities. He impregnated Liz's mother while working for a circus sideshow. It has also been shown that the Blob fathered a son (Theodore \"Tubby Teddy\" Allan) by an unknown woman. Teddy is in high school and has his father's same bulky appearance and similar abilities, as he was shot at point blank range and merely said \"It tickles\". He later joins Quicksilver's new Brotherhood as the new iteration of Blob.\n\nBlob is an enforcer on the alternate universe when the Apocalypse Twins skew the time lines and create a mutant utopia.\n\nOn Earth-18119 as seen in the pages of \"Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows\", Blob is seen as a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The episode originally aired on January 27, 1999. The episode largely takes place on the holodeck, which is running a holo-program in black and white instead of the usual color. This was because of a small fire to the Bridge set that had occurred while the episode was in production; as a result the Bridge scenes were shot weeks later after the set was repaired and scenes that were originally set for the Bridge were either entirely rewritten or set on a different part of the ship.

Paris' \"Captain Proton\" program, who promptly attack them.\n\nDuring an episode of \"The Adventures of Captain Proton\" on the holodeck (a recurring Voyager hologram program homage to Flash Gordon), Ensigns Tom Paris and Harry Kim are forced to leave the program running when spatial distortions trap the ship and disrupt their control over the computer. While the command staff of \"Voyager\" seek to discover a way to free the ship from the spatial distortions, extra-dimensional aliens who exist in a photonic state cross over from their own dimension through a distortion located in the holodeck. There, they are detected and attacked by Chaotica (who bears a striking resemblance to Flash Gordon's primary villain Ming the Merciless), who believes them to be from the fifth dimension, and whose holographic (photonic) weaponry — though harmless to humans — is deadly to the aliens.\"\n\nEventually, the crew discover the war being waged between Chaotica and the fifth dimension and must defeat him by playing out their roles as the fictional Captain Proton (played by Tom Paris), his sidekick Buster Kincaid (Harry Kim) the President of Earth (the ship's holographic , who is himself a photonic being), and Arachnia, Queen of the Spider People. Captain Janeway allows Paris to convince her to take on the latter role.\n\nQueen Arachnia, posing as Chaotica's bride, eventually convinces him to lower his shields so her friends could attend their wedding. Though initially suspicious, Chaotica does as requested, and Captain Proton is able to fire his \"death ray\" at Chaotica and defeat him, thereby freeing \"Voyager\" and allowing ship and crew to continue on their journey home.\n\n"}

Founded by , the family business reimagines the equestrian and theatrical arts. With its headquarters in Montreal, Cavalia is an integral part of Canada's cultural heritage, and the largest Canadian-owned enterprise specializing in live shows. Its expertise in high technology, multimedia and special effects creates magical, unique, innovative and never-before-seen experiences. Its first show, \"Cavalia\", has been seen by more than 5 million people across North America, Europe, Australia, the Middle East and Asia since its 2003 debut. \"Odysseo\", the company's second show, has toured to rave reviews and public acclaim since its 2011 premiere.\n\nCavalia is a fabricated word, inspired by the Italian, Spanish and French words for horse (cavallo, caballo and cheval) and the French and English word cavalier.\n\nCreated in 2003 by Normand Latourelle under the name of \"Voltige\", the very first show was held in Shawinigan, Quebec. The large-scale multimedia performance the company delivers is often compared to Cirque du Soleil, of which he was one of the four original co-founders as well as Managing Director and Executive Vice-President from 1985 to 1990. Apart from Latourelle's history, Cavalia has no affiliation with Cirque du Soleil and remains a separate entity. The company's original production, \"Cavalia: A Magical Encounter Between Human and Horse\", has been touring since 2003. \"Odysseo\", Cavalia's newest show, premiered in October 2011 in Laval, Quebec.\n\nIn May 2009, the Government of Canada provided Cavalia with a $4-million loan to Cavalia Inc. to develop new productions and construct a horse-training facility in Sutton, Quebec.\n\nThe first show is a tribute to the relationship between humans and horses throughout history. It is described as an equestrian ballet, it expresses a \"dream of freedom, cooperation and harmony\". Riders, acrobats, dancers and musicians share the stage with horses. \"A Magical Encounter Between Human and Horse\" features about 50 horses, 5 musicians and 45 artists including riders, aerialists, and acrobats.\n\nMany of the horses are Lusitanos, and the remainder are Andalusian horses, Canadian Horses, American Quarter Horses, Paint horses, Belgians, Percherons, Arabians, and Appaloosas. The show's horses were originally from Canada, France, Spain, and the United States.\nThese horses eat 40 bales of hay per day; they consume \n900 kg (1980 lb) \nof grain and \n20 kg (44 lb)carrots. \n\nThe show also features a team of over 20 human stars from Guinea, Canada, France, Kyrgyzstan, United States, Australia, Mexico, and Morocco, including acrobats and horsemen and horsewomen, including most notably, the amazing husband and wife team of Frederic Pignon and Magali Delgado.\n\n150 people work for the tent raising and site preparation. The installation lasts 12 days, while the removal is completed in three days. The tent is 30 metres high, the equivalent height of a 10-story building. 6635 m2 of fabric is used to create the marquee that extends over an area of 2 440m2. A screen of 70 metres serves as a backdrop for projections and multimedia effects. The stage is 50 metres in width, the length of an Olympic pool. 2,500 tons of sand, earth and gravel, the equivalent of 100 trucks, are used to create the scene. The Big Top can accommodate up to 2, 000 spectators. Cavalia's village includes nine tents: the White Big Top, a Rendezvous VIP Tent, Entrance tents, two Artistic tents, two warming tents, the Stable and the Staff Cafeteria.\n\n\"Odysseo\" was launched in 2011. \nCavalia summarizes the show as depicting \"horses and humans leaving together to meet a world between dream and reality by traveling through the great wonders that nature has offered, deserts, waterfalls, canyons and glaciers.\" This second show portrays equestrian arts, acrobatics, music, multimedia projections and special effects under one Big Top. It features some 300 different costumes. Non-riders do acrobatics and sing west African songs.\n\n\nLike the first production's Big Top, \"Odysseo's\" tent was designed specifically for the needs of the show and the vision of its creators. It is two and a quarter times bigger than the first one and is (as of September 2013) the largest touring tent in the world.\nThe exterior consists of four poles, four arches and 2.1 square miles of canvas; is 38 meters high; measures 115 metres long and 65 metres wide;\nand occupies a surface area which extends over 120 metres in length and 95 metres wide. The interior is 2500 square metres; composed of 6,000 tons of rock, earth and sand; and has a seating capacity of 2290 people.\n\nInstallation requires 40 motors and a mechanical crane; Each arch is composed of eight 9-meter-long sections. The arches rise to 27 meters and are 62 meters long; the painting is composed of 16 pieces; 1310 piles and anchor points are used; 166 posts are required to assemble the walls of the tower; wiring has a length of 5.8 km; It takes 20 trucks to transport the tent.\n\n"}
{"id": "1677928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1677928", "title": "Children's song", "text": "Children's song\n\nA children's song may be a nursery rhyme set to music, a song that children invent and share among themselves or a modern creation intended for entertainment, use in the home or education. Although children’s songs have been recorded and studied in some cultures more than others, they appear to be universal in human society.\n\nIona and Peter Opie, pioneers of the academic study of children’s culture, divided children’s songs into two classes: those taught to children by adults, which when part of a traditional culture they saw as nursery rhymes, and those that children taught to each other, which formed part of the independent culture of childhood. A further use of the term \"children's song\" is for songs written for the entertainment or education of children, usually in the modern era. In practice none of these categories is entirely discrete, since, for example, children often reuse and adapt nursery rhymes, and many songs now considered as traditional were deliberately written by adults for commercial ends.\n\nThe Opies further divided nursery rhymes into a number of groups, including\n\n\nPlayground or children’s street rhymes they sub-divided into two major groups: those associated with games and those that were entertainments, with the second category including\n\n\nIn addition, since the advent of popular music publication in the nineteenth century, a large number of songs have been produced for and often adopted by children. Many of these imitate the form of nursery rhymes, and a number have come to be accepted as such. They can be seen to have arisen from a number of sources, including\n\n\nThe term \"nursery rhyme\" is used for \"traditional\" songs for young children in Britain and many English speaking countries; but this usage dates only from the nineteenth century, and in North America the older \"Mother Goose rhyme\" is still often used. The oldest children's songs of which we have records are lullabies, which can be found in every human culture. The Roman nurses' lullaby, \"Lalla, Lalla, Lalla, aut dormi, aut lacte\", may be the oldest to survive. Many medieval English verses associated with the birth of Jesus (including \"Lullay, my liking, my dere son, my sweting\") take the form of a lullabies and may be adaptations of contemporary lullabies.\n\nHowever, most of those used today date from the seventeenth century onwards. We know that some rhymes were medieval or sixteenth-century in origin, including \"To market, to market\" and \"Cock a doodle doo\", but most were not written down until the eighteenth century, when the publishing of children's books began to move towards entertainment. The first English collections were \"Tommy Thumb's Song Book\" and a sequel, \"Tommy Thumb's Pretty Song Book\", both thought to have been published before 1744, and at this point such songs were known as \"Tommy Thumb's songs\". The publication of John Newbery's \"Mother Goose's Melody; or, Sonnets for the Cradle\" (c. 1785) is the first record we have of many classic rhymes still in use today. These rhymes seem to have come from a variety of sources, including traditional riddles, proverbs, ballads, lines of mummers' plays, drinking songs, historical events, and, it has been suggested, ancient pagan rituals. Roughly half of the current body of recognised \"traditional\" English rhymes were known by the mid-eighteenth century.\n\nIn the early nineteenth century, printed collections of rhymes began to spread to other countries, including Robert Chambers's \"Popular Rhymes of Scotland\" (1826) and, in the United States, \"Mother Goose's Melodies\" (1833). We sometimes know the origins and authors of rhymes from this period, such as \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\", which combined an eighteenth-century French tune with a poem by the English writer Jane Taylor, and \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\", written by Sarah Josepha Hale of Boston in 1830. Nursery rhymes were also often collected by early folk-song collectors, including, in Scotland, Sir Walter Scott and, in Germany, Clemens Brentano and Achim von Arnim in \"Des Knaben Wunderhorn\" (1806–8). The first, and possibly the most important, academic collections to focus in this area were James Orchard Halliwell's \"The Nursery Rhymes of England\" (1842) and \"Popular Rhymes and Tales\" (1849). By the time of Sabine Baring-Gould's \"A Book of Nursery Songs\" (1895), child folklore had become an academic study, full of comments and footnotes. The early years of the twentieth century are notable for the addition of sophisticated illustrations to books of children's songs, including Caldecott's \"Hey Diddle Diddle Picture Book\" (1909) and Arthur Rackham's \"Mother Goose\" (1913). The definitive study of English rhymes remains the work of Iona and Peter Opie.\n\nIn contrast to nursery rhymes, which are learned in childhood and passed from adults to children only after a gap of 20 to 40 years, children's playground and street songs, like much children's lore, are learned and passed on almost immediately. The Opies noted that this had two important effects: the rapid transmission of new and adjusted versions of songs, which could cover a country like Great Britain in perhaps a month by exclusively oral transmission, and the process of \"wear and repair\", in which songs were changed, modified and fixed as words and phrases were forgotten, misunderstood or updated.\n\nSome rhymes collected in the mid-twentieth century can be seen to have origins as early in the eighteenth century. Where sources could be identified, they could often be traced to popular adult songs, including ballads and those in music hall and minstrel shows. They were also studied in 19th century New York. Children also have a tendency to recycle nursery rhymes, children's commercial songs and adult music in satirical versions. A good example is the theme from the mid-1950s Disney film \"Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier\", \"The Ballad of Davy Crockett\", with a tune by George Bruns; its opening lines, \"Born on a mountain top in Tennessee / The greenest state in the land of the free\", were endlessly satirised to make Crockett a spaceman, a parricide and even a Teddy Boy.\n\nSome of the most popular playground songs include actions to be done with the words. Among the most famous of these is \"I'm a Little Teapot\". A term from the song is now commonly used in cricket to describe a disgruntled bowler's stance when a catch has been dropped. A 'teapot' involves standing with one hand on your hip in disappointment, a 'double teapot' involves both hands on hips and a disapproving glare.\n\nMany children's playground and street songs are connected to particular games. These include clapping games, like \"Miss Susie', played in America; \"A sailor went to sea\" from Britain; and \"Mpeewa\", played in parts of Africa. Many traditional Māori children's games, some of them with educational applications—such as hand movement, stick and string games—were accompanied by particular songs. In the Congo, the traditional game \"A Wa Nsabwee\" is played by two children synchronising hand and other movements while singing. Skipping games like Double Dutch have been seen as important in the formation of hip hop and rap music.\n\nIf a playground song \"does\" have a character, it is usually a child present at the time of the song's performance or the child singing the song. The extreme awkwardness of relations between young boys and young girls is a common motif such as in the American song \"K-I-S-S-I-N-G\". \"K-I-S-S-I-N-G\" or \"Kay Eye Ess Ess Eye En Gee\" is the name of a playground song, jump-rope rhyme, or taunt. It really only achieves its desired effect—embarrassment—when sung among children to a couple that is in puppy love, or when two people who do not want to be associated with each other get tagged together. The embarrassment is derived from the prospect of romantic contact between a boy and a girl, usually an uncomfortable topic for children.\n\nThe song is learned by oral tradition:\n\nOther songs have a variety of patterns and contexts. Many of the verses used by children have an element of transgression, and a number have satirical aims. The parody of adult songs with alternative verses, such as the rewriting of \"While shepherds watched their flocks by night\" to \"While shepherds washed their socks at night\" and numerous other versions, was a prominent activity in the British playgrounds investigated by the Opies in the twentieth century. With the growth of media and advertising in some countries, advertising jingles and parodies of those jingles have become a regular feature of children's songs, including the \"McDonald's song\" in the United States, which played against adult desire for ordered and healthy eating. Humour is a major factor in children's songs. (The nature of the English language, with its many double meanings for words, may mean that it possesses more punning songs than other cultures, although they are found in other cultures—for example, China). Nonsense verses and songs, like those of Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll, have been a major feature of publications for children, and some of these have been absorbed by children, although many such verses seem to have been invented by children themselves.\n\nPlayground songs can be parodies of popular songs such as \"On Top of Old Smoky\" or \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" in the USA with suitably altered lyrics. The new lyrics are frequently highly derisive towards figures of authority such as teachers or involve ribald lyrical variations. Zero-tolerance rules in some schools now prevent this, although they are sometimes ignored by teachers who view the songs as harmless and clever.\n\nPlayground songs may also feature contemporary children's characters or child actors such as Popeye, Shirley Temple, Batman or Barney the Dinosaur. Such songs are usually set to common melodies (a popular Batman-themed song uses much of the chorus of \"Jingle Bells\") and often include subversive and crude humor; in Barney's case, schoolyard parodies of his theme song were a driving force behind a massive backlash against Barney in the 1990s.\n\nOccasionally the songs are used as a base for modern pop songs, \"Circle Circle Dot Dot\", commonly sung in American playgrounds, has been recorded as a rap song.\n\nCommercial children's music grew out of the popular music-publishing industry associated with New York's Tin Pan Alley in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Early songs included \"Ten little fingers and ten little toes\" by Ira Shuster and Edward G. Nelson and \"School Days\" (1907) by Gus Edwards and Will Cobb. Perhaps the best remembered now is \"Teddy Bears' Picnic\", with lyrics written by Jimmy Kennedy in 1932, although the tune, by the British composer John Walter Bratton, was composed in 1907. As recording technology developed, children's songs were soon being sold on record; in 1888, the first recorded discs (called \"plates\") offered for sale included Mother Goose nursery rhymes. The earliest record catalogues of several seminal firms in the recording industry—such as Edison, Berliner, and Victor—contained separate children's sections. Until the 1950s, all the major record companies produced albums for children, mostly based on popular cartoons or nursery rhymes and read by major stars of theatre or film. The role of Disney in children's cinema from the 1930s meant that it gained a unique place in the production of children's music, beginning with \"Minnies Yoo Hoo\" (1930). After the production of its first feature-length animation, \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarves\" (1937), with its highly successful score by Frank Churchill and Larry Morey, the mould was set for a combination of animation, fairy tale and distinctive songs that would carry through to the 1970s with songs from films such as \"Pinocchio\" (1940) and \"Song of the South\" (1946).\n\nThe mid-twentieth century baby boomers provided a growing market for children's music. Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, and Ella Jenkins were among the politically progressive and socially conscious performers who aimed albums at children. Novelty recordings like \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" (a Montgomery Ward jingle that became a book and later a classic children's movie) and the fictional music group Alvin and the Chipmunks were among the most commercially successful music ventures of the time. In the 1960s, as the baby boomers matured and became more politically aware, they embraced both the substance and politics of folk (\"the people's\") music. Peter, Paul, and Mary, The Limeliters and Tom Paxton were acclaimed folk artists of the period who wrote albums for children. In the 1970s, television programmes like \"Sesame Street\" became the dominant force in children's music. In the early 1990s, the songwriter, record producer, and performer Bobby Susser emerged with his award-winning children's songs and series, \"Bobby Susser Songs for Children\", that exemplified the use of songs to educate young children in schools and at home. Disney also re-entered the market for animated musical features with \"The Little Mermaid\" (1989), from which the song \"Under the Sea\" won an Oscar, becoming the first of a string of Oscar–winning Disney songs.\n\nThe twenty-first century has seen an increase in the number of independent children's music artists, with acts like Dan Zanes, Cathy Bollinger, and Laurie Berkner getting wide exposure on cable TV channels targeted at children. The band Trout Fishing in America has achieved great acclaim by continuing the tradition of merging sophisticated folk music with family-friendly lyrics, and rock-oriented acts like They Might Be Giants have released albums marketed directly to children, such as \"No!,\" \"Here Come the ABCs, Here Come the 123s\" and \"Here Comes Science\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

The game was released for iOS platforms on August 2, 2012, and on Google Play for Android on October 7, 2013.\n\nThe game is set in a fantasy-themed persistent world where the player is a chief of a village. \"Clash of Clans\" tasks players to build their own town using the resources gained from attacking other players through the game's fighting features. The main resources are gold, elixir and dark elixir. Players can conjoin to create clans, groups of up to fifty people who can then partake in Clan Wars together, donate and receive troops, and talk with each other.\n\n\"Clash of Clans\" was released to positive reviews, garnering high ratings from many critics.\n\n\"Clash of Clans\" is an online multiplayer game in which players form communities, called clans, train troops, and attack other players to earn resources. There are four currencies or resources in the game. Gold and elixir can be used to build and reload defenses that protect the player from other players' attacks. Elixir and dark elixir are also used to train and upgrade troops and spells. Gems are the premium currency. Attacks are rated on a three star scale and have a maximum timed length of three minutes.\n\nThe game also features a pseudo-single player campaign in which the player can attack a series of fortified goblin villages and earn gold, elixir and dark elixir (levels 51-75 only). The game starts with two Builders, but the player can have up to five builders through buying them with gems.\n\nTo earn and store gold and elixir, players must build gold mines and gold storages and elixir collectors and elixir storages, respectively. Elixir is used to train new troops, carry out research in the laboratory to upgrade troops, to re-load X-Bows (available from Town Hall 9), and to build and upgrade certain buildings, mostly pertaining to buildings used in attacking another player's base. Gold is used to build defensive buildings and to upgrade the town hall, which allows access to more buildings and higher levels for existing buildings. At Town Hall 7, dark elixir becomes available; this type of elixir is used to train and upgrade dark elixir troops and heroes, create dark spells (available from Town Hall 8), and fuel the Inferno Tower, a defensive building that is available only at Town Hall 10. The Eagle Artillery, a defensive building only available at Town Hall 11, is fueled by elixir. Town Hall 11 also provides access to a new hero - The Grand Warden. It is the only hero born out of elixir. To earn and store dark elixir, players must build dark elixir drills and dark elixir storages. Town Hall 12 gets a defensive building called Giga Tesla, which is already built-in after the Town Hall 12 upgrade.\n\nThere are a number of buildings available to the player to defend their village, including cannons, mortars, bombs, teslas, traps, archer towers, wizard towers, inferno towers and eagle artilleries. Players can also build walls, which can be upgraded as a player's town hall level increases.\n\nThe game has two kinds of barracks (barracks and dark barracks) and two kinds of spell factories (spell factory and dark spell factory). The barracks create troops using elixir whereas dark barracks create troops using dark elixir.\n\nThe spell factories follow the same pattern - the normal spell factory creates spells using elixir, and the dark spell factory using dark elixir. All troops and spells have different properties. As the player progresses, several new troops and spells are able to be unlocked.\n\nAlso, the workshop, a building which houses clan troops called the Siege Machine & Battle Blimp, unlocks at Town Hall 12.\n\nClans are groups of players who join together to support each other, either materially (donating troops) or verbally (giving advice). Players can join clans once they rebuild the special Clan Castle building early on. A major component of the gameplay of \"Clash of Clans\" is clans facing off against one another in the \"clan wars\". Clan leaders and co-leaders can begin wars against other clans. Each clan is then given one \"preparation day\" and one \"war day.\" When a player attacks a member of the opposing clan, they receive stars based upon the amount of destruction they cause to the opponent's community. Each player is limited to two attacks per war, and the team with the most stars at the end of the war day is declared victorious. If the two clans' number of stars are equal, then the victor is the one that has a greater percent of destruction. Players receive bonus war loot if he/she use their attacks in the war. This loot may be different on different bases and is decided by Supercell; the top base has the most war bonus loot and the last base has the least amount of bonus loot. If the clan wins the war, the bonus loot is fully delivered to the player but during a loss or draw one-third of the loot is delivered to the player. In the March 2016 update, 35v35 and 45v45 were removed. The available war sizes are 50v50, 40v40, 30v30, 25v25, 20v20, 15v15, 10v10 and 5v5. In the May 2016 update, Friendly Challenges were introduced to allow clanmates to compete amongst other clanmates, however these challenges do not provide loot or trophies and do not affect a player's army. In the October 2018 update, Clan War Leagues were introduced. Clans would fight seven other clans to advance to the next league and earn league medals by earning stars in Clan War Leagues. The clan in the group with the most stars will be promoted to a higher league, while the clans in the group with the least stars will be demoted to a lower league.\n\nA new update to the game on May 22, 2017 released a new game mode, known as the \"Builder Base\". Players can sail to a new island and create a new village, with a different set of buildings. In this mode, two players attack each other's bases simultaneously. The one with the most damage or getting more stars gets the gold, elixir, and trophies. You can only win loot from attacking three times in twelve or twenty-four hours, but can continue attacking for trophies afterwards. The player can spend gems for skip the period of time. The progress will be much faster in this base with the introduction of Clock Tower (temporarily speeds the process in the entire Builder Base) and Gem Mine (spawns gems at a very slow rate). The update also introduced a new hero, the Battle Machine. It is the only hero in the game with a reusable ability named Electric Hammer. In March 2018, Builder Hall level 8 was released, which is currently the highest Builder Hall level.\n\nIn December 2017, Supercell introduced the clan games, at first a one-off event where clan members could work together to complete tasks, which would then earn clan points, but there has been plans to make it a weekly event. When enough points are accumulated, a reward tier would be unlocked, and players can select one reward from each unlocked tier. This update also introduced Magic Items, which could be used to enhance certain aspects of the player's village. Magic items are obtainable as rewards from clan games and through events. \n\n\"Clash of Clans\" was created by Zack Ferry and developed by Supercell, the company behind other popular mobile games like \"Hay Day\". The game was released for iOS platforms on August 2, 2012, and on Google Play for Android on October 7, 2013.\n\nThe game is heavily promoted. In February 2015, Supercell released their \"Clash of Clans\" Super Bowl XLIX commercial, featuring Liam Neeson parodying his character from \"Taken\". On February 2, Business Insider reported the ad as the 5th most watched Super Bowl ad, though on February 6, VentureBeat reported the ad was the most viewed of those that appeared on the Super Bowl. YouTube users later voted the advertisement the second best Super Bowl ad, behind Nissan's \"With Dad\" ad.\n\nOn September 23, 2015, Taiwanese singers JJ Lin and Jimmy Lin released the game's theme song \"全面开战\" (\"Start a war totally\" in English), which was sung in Mandarin.\n\n\"Clash of Clans\" has received generally positive reviews. The iOS version holds an aggregate score of 74 out of 100 on Metacritic, and 80% on GameRankings.\n\nGamezebo's Leif Johnson was impressed, scoring the game 4.5 out of 5. Although he felt the gameplay was heavily skewed to encourage the player to purchase gems, he praised the addition of a single-player campaign. He concluded that \"\"Clash of Clans\" is a simple game, but that's more of a strength than a weakness. It's simple enough to provide quick, painless matches on an iPhone in an idle moment, and there are enough different units to choose from in the battle mode to make playing against other players endlessly rewarding. Best of all, the option to fight against NPC goblins gives \"Clash of Clans\" a small edge over similar strategy games that rely almost entirely on player-versus-player combat.\"\n\nPocket Gamer's Peter Willington was equally impressed, scoring the game 9 out of 10 and giving it a \"Gold Award\". Reviewing the game several months after it was released for iOS devices, Willington praised the game for requiring real strategy to play. He wrote that the gameplay was built on the progression of \"requiring more and more sophisticated units, asking you to strategise and really think about which elements you should focus on building within your camp.\" He concluded that \"\"Clash of Clans\" is a superb game, freemium or otherwise, with more nuance than most give it credit for. That's why it's passed the test of time since its launch and still has an active community devotedly constructing elaborate fortresses in the hope of becoming invincible.\"\n\n148App's Rob Rich scored the game 3.5 out of 5, writing \"It's great to play an online freemium game that doesn't shy away from the single-player experience but also offers up some honest-to-goodness direct interaction, which is a very rare combination these days. It probably won't warm the hearts of any haters out there, but it does give genre fans something with a bit more action and strategy than they might be used to.\" Tom's Guide enjoyed the player interaction.\n\nModojo's John Bedford was less impressed, scoring the game 3 out of 5. He was critical of freemium gaming in general, writing \"The novelty hasn't just worn off this particular style of greedy gaming, it's shriveled up and condensed itself into an infinitely dense singularity of self-loathing.\" Of the game itself, he concluded, \"This is a game that follows in the footsteps of no small number of titles that have made feverish demands on our wallets in exchange for just a slightly thicker slice of the gameplay. It's possible you have an unending appetite for these micromanagement titles, in which case we recommend getting heartily stuck into Supercell's latest game. While \"Clash of Clans\" brings something new to accompany its competent but unexceptional empire gameplay, for most of us it'll be a case of too little, too late.\"\n\n\"Clash of Clans\" became an App Store top 5 download between December 2012 and May 2013, and this success has been described as helping to usher in a new era in single player gaming on mobile devices. In 2013, \"Clash of Clans\" was the third-highest game in revenue generated on the App Store and number one on Google Play.\n\nIn February 2014 it was reported that the game was generating $654,000 in daily revenue for Supercell. In 2015, the game was the top grossing app on both the App Store and Google Play, with an estimated revenue of 1.5 million dollars per day.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1667421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1667421", "title": "Communal work", "text": "Communal work\n\nCommunal work is a gathering for mutually accomplishing a task or for communal fundraising, for example through a knitting bee. Communal work was more common in the past, when it provided manual labour to others, especially for major projects they couldn't achieve on their own, for example in barn raising, log rolling, subbotniks, and other bees of various kinds. They are less common in today's more individualistic cultures, where there is less reliance on others than in preindustrial agricultural and hunterer-gatherer societies. \n\nIn more modern societies, the word \"bee\" has also been used for some time already for other social gatherings without communal work, for example for competitions such as a spelling bee.\n\nEspecially in the past, major jobs, such as clearing a field of timber or raising a barn, needed many workers. It was often both a social and utilitarian event. Jobs like corn husking or sewing could be done as a group to allow socializing during an otherwise tedious chore. Such gatherings often included refreshments and entertainment. Different words have been used to describe such gatherings.\n\nThis use of the word \"bee\" is common in literature describing colonial North America. It was, and continues to be, commonly used in Australia also, most often as \"working bee\".\n\nUses in literature include:\n\n\nBecause the word describes people working together in a social group, a common false etymology is that the term derives from the insect of the same name and similar social behavior. According to etymological research recorded in dictionaries, the word probably comes from dialectal \"been\" or \"bean\" (meaning \"help given by neighbors\"), which came from Middle English \"bene\" (meaning \"prayer\", \"boon\" and \"extra service by a tenant to his lord\")\n\nHarambee () is an East African (Kenyan, Tanzanian and Ugandan) tradition of community self-help events, e.g. fundraising or development activities. \"Harambee\" literally means \"all pull together\" in Swahili, and is also the official motto of Kenya and appears on its coat of arms.\n\nEthiopia Debo To build a house, or a farm. Each contributes according to one's ability. Especially indispensable for elderly and widows who do not have a strong man to support. \n\nNaffīr () is an Arabic word used in parts of Sudan (including Kordofan, Darfur, parts of the Nuba mountains and Kassala) to describe particular types of communal work undertakings. \"Naffīr\" has been described as including a group recruited through family networks, in-laws and village neighbors for some particular purpose, which then disbands when that purpose is fulfilled. An alternative, more recent, definition describes \"naffīr\" as \"to bring someone together from the neighborhood or community to carry out a certain project, such as building a house or providing help during the harvest season.\"\n\nThe word may be related to the standard Arabic word \"nafr\" (نفر) which describes a band, party, group or troop, typically mobilized for war. In standard Arabic, a \"naffīr āmm\" (نفير عام) refers to a general call to arms.\n\n\"Naffīr\" has also been used in a military context in Sudan. For example, the term was used to refer to the \"an-Naffīr ash-Sha'abī\" or \"People's Militias\" that operated in the central Nuba Mountains region in the early 1990s.\n\nGotong-royong is a conception of sociality familiar to large parts of Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei and Malaysia. The phrase has been translated into English in many ways, most of which hearken to the conception of reciprocity or mutual aid. For M. Nasroen, \"gotong royong\" forms one of the core tenets of Indonesian philosophy. Paul Michael Taylor and Lorraine V. Aragon state that \"\"gotong royong\" [is] cooperation among many people to attain a shared goal.\"\n\nIn a 1983 essay Clifford Geertz points to the importance of \"gotong royong\" in Indonesian life:\nAn enormous inventory of highly specific and often quite intricate institutions for effecting the cooperation in work, politics, and personal relations alike, vaguely gathered under culturally charged and fairly well indefinable value-images--\"rukun\" (\"mutual adjustment\"), \"gotong royong\" (\"joint bearing of burdens\"), \"tolong-menolong\" (\"reciprocal assistance\")--governs social interaction with a force as sovereign as it is subdued.\nAnthropologist Robert A. Hahn writes:\nJavanese culture is stratified by social class and by level of adherence to Islam. ...Traditional Javanese culture does not emphasize material wealth. ...There is respect for those who contribute to the general village welfare over personal gain. And the spirit of \"gotong royong,\" or volunteerism, is promoted as a cultural value.\n\"Gotong royong\" has long functioned as the scale of the village, as a moral conception of the political economy. However, as the political economy became more privatized, capitalistic, and individualistic, \"gotong royong\" has probably waned. Pottier records the impact of the Green Revolution in Java:\n\"Before the GR, 'Java' had relatively 'open' markets, in which many local people were rewarded in kind. With the GR, rural labour markets began to foster 'exclusionary practices'... This resulted in a general loss of rights, especially secure harvesting rights within a context of mutual cooperation, known as \"gotong royong.\"\"\nCiting Ann Laura Stoler's ethnography from the 1970s, Pottier writes that cash was replacing exchange, that old patron-client ties were breaking, and that social relations were becoming characterized more by employer-employee qualities.\n\nFor Prime Minister Muhammad Natsir, \"gotong royong\" was an ethical principle of sociality, in marked contrast to both the \"unchecked\" feudalism of the West, and the social anomie of capitalism.\n\nIdeas of reciprocity, ancient and deeply enmeshed aspects of \"kampung\" morality, were seized upon by postcolonial politicians. John Sidel writes: \"Ironically, national-level politicians drew on \" village conceptions of adat and gotong royong. They drew on notions \"of traditional community to justify new forms of authoritarian rule.\" \n\nDuring the presidency of Sukarno, the idea of \"gotong royong\" was officially elevated to a central tenet of Indonesian life. For Sukarno, the new nation was to be synonymous with \"gotong royong\". He said that the \"Pancasila\" could be reduced to the idea of \"gotong royong\". On June 1, 1945, Sukarno said of the Pancasila:\nThe first two principles, nationalism and internationalism, can be pressed to one, which I used to call 'socionationalism.' Similarly with democracy 'which is not the democracy of the West' together with social justice for all can be pressed down to one, and called socio democracy. Finally belief in God. 'And so what originally was five has become three: socio nationalism, socio democracy, and belief in God.' 'If I press down five to get three, and three to get one, then I have a genuine Indonesian term GOTONG ROYONG [mutual co-operation]. The state of Indonesia which we are to establish should be a state of mutual co-operation. How fine that is ! A Gotong Royong state!\n\nIn 1960, Sukarno dissolved the elected parliament and implemented the \"Gotong Royong\" Parliament. Governor of Jakarta, Ali Sadikin, spoke of a desire to reinvigorate urban areas with village sociality, with \"gotong royong\". Suharto's New Order was characterized by much discourse about tradition. During the New Order, Siskamling harnessed the idea of gotong royong. By the 1990s, if not sooner, \"gotong royong\" had been \"fossilized\" by New Order sloganeering. During the presidency of Megawati, the Gotong Royong Cabinet was implemented. It lasted from 2001 to 2004.\n\nBayanihan (pronounced ) is a Filipino term taken from the word \"bayan\", referring to a nation, country, town or community. The whole term \"bayanihan\" refers to a spirit of communal unity or effort to achieve a particular objective.\n\nThe origin of the term \"bayanihan\" can be traced from a common tradition in Philippine towns where community members volunteer to help a family move to a new place by volunteering to transport the house to a specific location. The process involves literally carrying the house to its new location. This is done by putting bamboo poles forming a strong frame to lift the stilts from the ground and carrying the whole house with the men positioned at the ends of each pole. The tradition also features a small fiesta hosted by the family to express gratitude to the volunteers.\n\nIn society, \"bayanihan\" has been adopted as a term to refer to a local civil effort to resolve national issues. One of the first groups to use the term is the Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company which travels to countries to perform traditional folk dances of the country with the objective of promoting Philippine culture. The concept is related to \"damayán\" (\"to help one another\").\n\nIn computing, the term \"bayanihan\" has evolved into many meanings and incorporated as codenames to projects that depict the spirit of cooperative effort involving a community of members. An example of these projects is the Bayanihan Linux project which is a Philippines-based desktop-focused Linux distribution.\n\nIn ethnic newspapers, \"Bayanihan News\" is the name of community newspaper for the Philippine community in Australia. It is in English and in Filipino with regular news and articles on Philippine current events and history. It was established in October 1998 in Sydney, Australia.\n\nImece is a name given for a traditional Turkish village-scale collaboration. For example, if a couple is getting married, villagers participate in the overall organization of the ceremony including but not limited to preparation of the celebration venue, food, building and settlement of the new house for the newly weds. Tasks are often distributed according to expertise and has no central authority to govern activities.\n\nTalkoot (from Finnish: \"talkoo\", almost always used in plural, \"talkoot\") is a Finnish expression for a gathering of friends and neighbors organized to accomplish a task. The word is borrowed into Finland Swedish as \"talko\" but is unknown to most Swedes. However, cognate terms and in approximately the same context are used in Estonia (talgu(d)), Latvia (noun \"talka\", verb \"talkot\"), and Lithuania (noun \"talka\", verb \"talkauti\"). It is the cultural equivalent of communal work in a village community, although adapted to the conditions of Finland, where most families traditionally lived in isolated farms often miles away from the nearest village.\n\nA \"talkoot\" is by definition voluntary, and the work is unpaid. The voluntary nature might be imaginary due to social pressure, especially in small communities, and one's honour and reputation may be severely damaged by non-attendance or laziness. The task of the \"talkoot\" may be something that is a common concern for the good of the group, or it may be to help someone with a task that exceeds his or her own capacity. For instance, elderly neighbours or relatives can need help if their house or garden is damaged by a storm, or siblings can agree to arrange a party for a parent's special birthday as a \"talkoot\".\n\nTypically, club houses, landings, churches, and parish halls can be repaired through a \"talkoot\", or environmental tasks for the neighborhood are undertaken. The parents of pre-school children may gather to improve the playground, or the tenants of a tenement house may arrange a \"talkoot\" to put their garden in order for the summer or winter. A person unable to contribute with actual work may contribute food for the \"talkoot\" party, or act as a baby-sitter. When a \"talkoot\" is for the benefit of an individual, he or she is the host of the talkoot party and is obliged to offer as much food and drink as possible.\n\nKaláka (ˈkɒlaːkɒ) is the Hungarian word for working together for a common goal. This can be building a house or doing agricultural activities together, or any other communal work on a volunteer basis. \n\nMeitheal () is the Irish word for a work team, gang, or party and denotes the co-operative labour system in Ireland where groups of neighbours help each other in turn with farming work such as harvesting crops.\n\nThe term is used in various writings of Irish language authors. It can convey the idea of community spirit in which neighbours respond to each other's needs. In modern use for example, a meitheal could be a party of neighbours and friends invited to help decorate a house in exchange for food and drink, or in scouting, where volunteer campsite wardens maintain campsites around Ireland.\n\nDugnad is a Norwegian term for voluntary work done together with other people. It's a very core phenomenon for Norwegians and the word was voted as the Norwegian word of the year 2004 in the TV programme «Typisk Norsk» (\"Typical Norwegian\"). Participation in a \"dugnad\" is often followed by a common meal, served by the host.\n\nIn urban areas, the \"dugnad\" is most commonly identified with outdoor spring cleaning and gardening in housing co-operatives. \"Dugnader\", Dugnads, are also a big phenomenon in kindergartens and elementary schools to make the area nice, clean and safe and to do decorating etc. such as painting and other types of maintenance. \"Dugnader\" occur more widely in remote and rural areas. Neighbours sometime participate during house or garage building, and organizations (such as kindergartens or non-profit organisations) may arrange annual \"dugnader\".\n\nThe Norwegian word \"Dugnadsånd\" is translatable to the spirit of will to work together for a better community. Many Norwegians will describe this as a typical Norwegian thing to have.\n\nMoba (Serbian: моба) is an old Serbian tradition of communal self-help in villages. It was a request for help in labor-intensive activities, like harvesting wheat, building a church or repairing village roads.\n\nWork was entirely voluntary and no compensation, except possibly meals for workers, was expected.\n\nGadugi (Cherokee:ᎦᏚᎩ) is a term used in the Cherokee language which means \"working together\" or \"cooperative labor\" within a community. Historically, the word referred to a labor gang of men and/or women working together for projects such as harvesting crops or tending to gardens of elderly or infirm tribal members. The word \"Gadugi\" was derived from the Cherokee word for \"bread\", which is \"Gadu\".\n\nIn recent years the Cherokee Nation tribal government has promoted the concept of \"Gadugi.\" The GaDuGi Health Center is a tribally run clinic in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, the capital of the Cherokee Nation. The concept is becoming more widely known. In Lawrence, Kansas, in 2004 the rape crisis center affiliated with the University of Kansas, adopted the name, the Gadugi Safe Center, for its programs to aid all people affected by sexual violence.\n\nGadugi is the name of a font included with Microsoft Windows 8 that includes support for the Cherokee language along with other languages of the Americas such as Inuktitut.\n\nMink'a or minka (Quechua or Kichwa, Hispanicized \"minca, minga\") is a type of traditional communal work in the Andes in favor of the whole community \"(ayllu)\". Participants are traditionally paid in kind. Mink'a is still practiced in indigenous communities in Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Chile, especially among the Quechua and the Aymara.\nIn rural southern Chile, labor reciprocity and communal work remained common through the twentieth century and into the twenty-first, particularly in rural communities on the Archipelago of Chiloé. Referred to as \"mingas,\" the practice can be traced to pre-contact Mapuche and Huilliche traditions of communal labor. In Chiloé, mingas took the form either of \"días cambiados\" (tit for tat exchanges of labor between neighbors) or large-scale work parties hosted by a particular family, accompanied by food and drink, and often lasting several days. Most agricultural work and community construction projects were done by way of mingas. The \"tiradura de casa\" (\"house pull\") involved moving a house from one location to another.\n\nPanama\n\nIn rural Panama, especially in the Azuero peninsula region and its diaspora, it is common to hold a 'junta' party as a communal labor event. Most commonly these events are used to harvest rice, clear brush with machetes, or to build houses. Workers generally work without compensation but are provided with meals and often alcoholic beverages such as fermented chicha fuerte and seco.\n"}

DNA and RNA, handwriting, phonographic recording, magnetic tape, and optical discs are all examples of storage media. Recording is accomplished by virtually any form of energy. Electronic data storage requires electrical power to store and retrieve data. \n\nData storage in a digital, machine-readable medium is sometimes called \"digital data\". Computer data storage is one of the core functions of a general purpose computer. Electronic documents can be stored in much less space than paper documents. Barcodes and magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) are two ways of recording machine-readable data on paper.\n\nA recording medium is a physical material that holds information. Newly created information is distributed and can be stored in four storage media–print, film, magnetic, and optical–and seen or heard in four information flows–telephone, radio and TV, and the Internet as well as being observed directly. Digital information is stored on electronic media in many different recording formats.\n\nWith electronic media, the data and the recording media are sometimes referred to as \"software\" despite the more common use of the word to describe computer software. With (traditional art) static media, art materials such as crayons may be considered both equipment and medium as the wax, charcoal or chalk material from the equipment becomes part of the surface of the medium.\n\nSome recording media may be temporary either by design or by nature. Volatile organic compounds may be used to preserve the environment or to purposely make data expire over time. Data such as smoke signals or skywriting are temporary by nature. Depending on the volatility, a gas (e.g. atmosphere, smoke) or a liquid surface such as a lake would be considered a temporary recording medium if at all.\n\nA 2003 UC Berkeley report estimated that about five exabytes of new information were produced in 2002, and that 92% of this data was stored on hard disk drives. This was about twice the data produced in 2000. The amount of data transmitted over telecommunication systems in 2002 was nearly 18 exabytes—three and a half times more than was recorded on non-volatile storage. Telephone calls constituted 98% of the telecommunicated information in 2002. The researchers' highest estimate for the growth rate of newly stored information (uncompressed) was more than 30% per year.\n\nIt has been estimated that the year 2002 was the beginning of the digital age for information storage: an age in which more information is stored on digital storage devices than on analog storage devices. In 1986, approximately 1% of the world's capacity to store information was in digital format; this grew to 3% by 1993, to 25% by 2000, and to 97% by 2007. These figures correspond to less than three compressed exabytes in 1986, and 295 compressed exabytes in 2007. The quantity of digital storage doubled roughly every three years.\n\nIn a more limited study, the International Data Corporation estimated that the total amount of digital data in 2007 was 281 exabytes, and that the total amount of digital data produced exceeded the global storage capacity for the first time.\n\nA study published in 2011 estimated that the world's technological capacity to store information in analog and digital devices grew from less than three (optimally compressed) exabytes in 1986, to 295 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007, and doubles roughly every three years.\n\n"}

The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film.\n\nThe film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized, or noticed. Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay within the boundaries of the film's budget.\n\nThere are many pathways to becoming a film director. Some film directors started as screenwriters, cinematographers, film editors or actors. Other film directors have attended a film school. Directors use different approaches. Some outline a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue, while others control every aspect, and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely. Some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners. Some directors edit or appear in their films, or compose the music score for their films.\n\nA film director's task is to envisage a way to translate a screenplay into a fully formed film, and then to realize this vision. To do this, they oversee the artistic and technical elements of film production. This entails organizing the film crew in such a way to achieve their vision of the film. This requires skills of group leadership, as well as the ability to maintain a singular focus even in the stressful, fast-paced environment of a film set. Moreover, it is necessary to have an artistic eye to frame shots and to give precise feedback to cast and crew, thus, excellent communication skills are a must.\n\nSince the film director depends on the successful cooperation of many different creative individuals with possibly strongly contradicting artistic ideals and visions, he or she also needs to possess conflict resolution skills in order to mediate whenever necessary. Thus the director ensures that all individuals involved in the film production are working towards an identical vision for the completed film. The set of varying challenges he or she has to tackle has been described as \"a multi-dimensional jigsaw puzzle with egos and weather thrown in for good measure\". It adds to the pressure that the success of a film can influence when and how they will work again, if at all.\n\nGenerally, the sole superiors of the director are the producer(s) and the studio that is financing the film. The role of a director differs from producers in that producers typically manage the logistics and business operations of the production, whereas the director is tasked with making creative decisions. The director must work within the restrictions of the film's budget and the demands of the producer and studio (such as the need to get a particular age rating).\n\nDirectors also play an important role in post-production. While the film is still in production, the director sends \"dailies\" to the film editor and explains his or her overall vision for the film, allowing the editor to assemble an editor's cut. In post-production, the director works with the editor to edit the material into the director's cut. Well-established directors have the \"final cut privilege\", meaning that they have the final say on which edit of the film is released. For other directors, the studio can order further edits without the director's permission.\n\nThe director is one of the few positions that requires intimate involvement during every stage of film production. Thus, the position of film director is widely considered to be a highly stressful and demanding one. It has been said that \"20-hour days are not unusual\". Some directors also take on additional roles, such as producing, writing or editing.\n\nUnder European Union law, the film director is considered the \"author\" or one of the authors of a film, largely as a result of the influence of auteur theory. Auteur theory is a film criticism concept that holds that a film director's film reflects the director's personal creative vision, as if they were the primary \"auteur\" (the French word for \"author\"). In spite of—and sometimes even because of—the production of the film as part of an industrial process, the auteur's creative voice is distinct enough to shine through studio interference and the collective process.\n\nSome film directors started as screenwriters, film editors or actors. Several American cinematographers have become directors, including Barry Sonnenfeld, originally the Coen brothers' DP; Jan de Bont, cinematographer on films as \"Die Hard\" and \"Basic Instinct\", directed \"Speed\" and \"Twister\". Wally Pfister, cinematographer on Christopher Nolan's three Batman films made his directorial debut with \"Transcendence\". Other film directors have attended a film school to \"get formal training and education in their craft\". Film students generally study the basic skills used in making a film. This includes, for example, preparation, shot lists and storyboards, blocking, protocols of dealing with professional actors, and reading scripts. Some film schools are equipped with sound stages and post-production facilities. Besides basic technical and logistical skills, students also receive education on the nature of professional relationships that occur during film production. A full degree course can be designed for up to five years of studying. Future directors usually complete short films during their enrollment. The National Film School of Denmark has the student's final projects presented on national TV. Some film schools retain the rights for their students' works. Many directors successfully prepared for making feature films by working in television. The German Film and Television Academy Berlin consequently cooperates with the Berlin/Brandenburg TV station RBB (Berlin-Brandenburg Broadcasting) and ARTE.\n\nA handful of top directors made from $133.3 million to $257.95 million in 2011, such as James Cameron and Steven Spielberg. In May 2011, the average United States film director made $92,220.\n\n\ne Other Side of the Camera\", Visible Ink Press, 1999\n"}

Ewing, where a gambler believes they will be able to stop a risky behavior while still engaging in it. This belief frequently operates during games of chance, such as casino games. The gambler believes they will be a net winner at the game, and thus able to avoid going broke by exerting the self-control necessary to stop playing while still ahead in winnings. This is often expressed as “I’ll quit when I’m ahead.”\n\nQuitting while ahead is unlikely, though, since a gambler who is winning has little incentive to quit, and is instead encouraged to continue to gamble by their winning. Once in the throes of a winning streak, the individual may even become convinced that it is their skill, rather than chance, causing their winnings, or good luck on their side, and thus it seems especially senseless to stop.\n\nThe gambler's conceit frequently works in conjunction with the gambler's fallacy: the mistaken idea that a losing streak in a game of chance, such as roulette, has to come to an end because the frequency of one event has an effect on a following independent event. \n\nTherefore, players think that it is necessary to continue playing while winning and necessary to continue playing while losing.\n\nRelatedly, gambler's ruin shows that a player with finite resources continuously playing will inevitably go broke against a player with infinite resources in a fair or negative-expectation game. However, this is also true in a positive-expectation game if the player with finite resources continually plays and increases his stakes when winning, but does not reduce them when losing.\n\nAs casinos have a house advantage in games of chance, a casino is more likely over time to take a player's money than a player is to win money from the casino, and thus it is to the casino's advantage to keep a winning player playing. Casinos thus frequently encourage winning players to continue playing. An example can be seen in the Martin Scorsese movie \"Casino\" where Robert De Niro's character ensures that a high-stakes gambler continues to gamble to ensure that the money returns to the casino. On a smaller scale, casinos offer players free alcoholic drinks to encourage them to keep gambling.\n\n"}
{"id": "47967946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47967946", "title": "Gordon music learning theory", "text": "Gordon music learning theory\n\nGordon Music Learning Theory is a model for music education based on Edwin Gordon's research on musical aptitude and achievement in the greater field of music learning theory. The theory is an explanation of music learning, based on audiation (see below) and students' individual musical differences. The theory uses the concepts of discrimination and inference learning to explain tonal, rhythmic, and harmonic patterns.\n\n\"Audiation\" is a term Gordon coined in 1975 to refer to comprehension and internal realization of music, or the sensation of an individual hearing or feeling sound when it is not physically present. Musicians previously used terms such as \"aural perception\" or \"aural imagery\" to describe this concept, though \"aural imagery\" would imply a notational component while audiation does not necessarily do so. Gordon suggests that \"audiation is to music what thought is to language.\" His research is based on similarities between how individuals learn a language and how they learn to make and understand music. Gordon specifies that audiation potential is an element of music aptitude, arguing that to demonstrate music aptitude one must use audiation.\n\nGordon describes that audiation occurs when an individual is \"listening to, recalling, performing, interpreting, creating, improvising, reading, or writing music.\" Audiation while listening to music, he describes, is analogous to the simultaneous translation of languages, giving meaning to sound and music based on individual knowledge and experience.\n\nGordon also emphasizes that music itself is not a language as it has no words or grammar, but rather has syntax, an \"orderly arrangement of sounds, and context.\" \n\nGordon differentiates different varieties of audiation and categorizes them into 8 types and 6 stages.\n\n\nIn addition to outlining types of audiation, Gordon also differentiates between stages of audiation \n\nTo describe how students learn music, Gordon outlines two main categories of learning based on his research on audiation: discrimination learning and inference learning.\nDiscrimination learning is defined as the ability to determine whether two elements are same or not the same. Gordon describes five sequential levels of discrimination: aural/oral, verbal association, partial synthesis, symbolic association, and composite synthesis.\nGordon describes that the most basic type of discrimination being aural/oral, where students hear tonal and rhythm patterns and imitate by singing, moving, and chanting patterns back to the instructor. Students listen in the aural portion of discrimination learning, while performing represents the oral portion. At this stage, students use neutral syllables to perform tonal and rhythm patterns.\nAfter students are more able to audiate and perform basic rhythm and tonal patterns and become comfortable with imitating songs and chants in introduced tonalities and meters, Gordon explains the next step is verbal association, where contextual meaning is given to what the students are audiating and imitating through tonal or rhythm syllables (such as solfege or the names of concepts students may be audiating through tonal patterns such as tonic and dominant).\n\nAt both aural/oral and the verbal association level, students identify familiar tonal and rhythm patterns performed on neutral syllables by their verbal association.\nSymbolic association is the point at which students are introduced to notation, learning to associate written symbols and notation describing familiar tonal and rhythm patterns that had been introduced in the aural/oral and verbal association level of the skill learning sequence. \nAt the composite synthesis level, students give context to familiar tonal or rhythm patterns by reading and writing them and identifying their tonality or meter as introduced in the symbolic association stage.\nAt the inference learning level, students take an active role in their own education and learn to identify, create, and improvise \"unfamiliar\" patterns. Similar to discrimination learning, Gordon delineates separate categories of inference learning that students logically follow in the course of music learning: generalization, creativity/improvisation, and theoretical understanding.\nAs aural/oral learning is the most basic element of discrimination learning, generalization is the basic element of inference learning. Generalization consists aural/oral learning, verbal learning, symbolic reading, and writing. At the generalization level of learning, students may listen to sets of familiar and unfamiliar tonal or rhythmic patterns and determine whether the patterns are the same or different, ultimately reading familiar and unfamiliar patterns, as well. \nThe creativity/improvisation level of the above learning sequences has aural/oral and symbolic levels. At the aural/oral level, teachers present familiar or unfamiliar patterns and have students respond with patterns of their own, first on neutral syllables and later with the verbal association. At the symbolic level, students learn to recognize and sing patterns within written chord symbols, as well as learn to write their own responses to tonal patterns and rhythm patterns.\nThe final level of inference learning is theoretical understanding, in which students gain further understanding of music theory concepts in aural/oral, verbal, and symbolic contexts. Students may learn concepts such as pitch letter-names, intervals, key-signature names, or concepts such as cadences and learn to recognize and perform patterns that apply such concepts.\n\nJump Right In is an instrumental methods book with accompanying teacher editions that applies Gordon's music learning theory, co-written by Eastman School of Music music education faculty Richard F. Grunow and Christopher D Azzara alongside Gordon. The series of Winds and Percussion was first published in 1989–90, three years after the recorder edition. The collection also includes a strings methods edition.\n\nGordon's music learning theory is based on his research on music aptitude in line with cognitive theories regarding the organization of incoming stimuli. Gordon's research suggests that music aptitude is normally distributed in the general population similar to intellectual aptitude. His research also suggests that music aptitude that a child is born with can only be maintained with repeated positive exposure to musical experiences soon after (or even before) birth, up until approximately age 9 where a child reaches \"stabilized\" music aptitude.\n\nThe 1920s and 30s heralded the creation of aptitude and achievement tests by Carl Seashore, E. Thayer Gaston, H.D. Wing, Arnold Bentley, and Edwin Gordon in an effort to identify students who were most likely to benefit from private instruction. Gordon created a number of tests to determine music aptitude for various age groups; he developed his first music aptitude test, the \"Musical Aptitude Profile\", in 1965 for children in 4th to 12th grade. Later tests include \"Primary Measures of Music Audiation\" (PMMA), published in 1979 for children ages 5 to 8, \"Intermediate Measures of Music Audiation\"(IMMA) for children ages 6 to 9, and \"Audie\" for children ages 3 to 4. Gordon describes that these tests of musical aptitude are meant to allow teachers to adapt their instruction to individual students' needs and to target students with high musical aptitude who may not otherwise be receiving advanced musical instruction.\n\nCriticisms of music learning theory include Paul Woodford's concerns that the theory itself is a misnomer, and rather than a learning theory it is a \"taxonomy of musical preconditions for critical thinking\", and that \"rather than overwhelming younger students in the beginning stages of instruction by focusing only on the complexities of music, teachers should use approaches such as Gordon's along with Kodaly, Orff, and other methodologies, to help students master basic musical skills and knowledge that are prerequisites to more independent kinds of thinking.\" Gordon responded to these claims, arguing that Woodford misunderstood elements of Gordon's methodology, erroneously associating Gordon with \"clapping of rhythms\", as well as misunderstanding the difference between chronological and musical age, the difference explaining why tonal and rhythm patterns should be taught independently in order to create a foundation for \"complex cognition and independent musical thinking that relates to larger musical forms\". Gordon also agrees with Woodford's comment that Gordon's approach should be taught alongside other methodologies, also asserting that he agrees with Woodford's suggestion that \"students should be introduced to the full range of real-life kinds of musical thinking including less conventional, and even atypical, musical practices.\"\n\nSimilar criticisms include accusations that Gordon's skills-based programs of applying Music Learning Theory are \"probably too narrow and limited in scope to provide students access to the diversity of musical belief systems, practices, and groups that exist\", a concern of writer Paul G. Woodford and music education theorist Bennett Reimer. Woodford credits Gordon for his highly developed system about the nature of music teaching and learning, but cautions that Gordon's system is too prescriptive and proscriptive to students and teachers, and that music educators should also be aware of the diversity of practices and strive to not exert pressure on students to conform to conventional musical thought and behavior. Gordon's 1997 response responds to this indirectly, arguing that his methodology leaves room for other methodologies to be taught alongside it.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11535652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11535652", "title": "Gus Elen", "text": "Gus Elen\n\nErnest Augustus Elen (22 July 1862 – 17 February 1940) was an English music hall singer and comedian. He achieved success from 1891, performing cockney songs including \"Arf a Pint of Ale\", \"It's a Great Big Shame\", \"Down the Road\" and \"If It Wasn't for the 'Ouses in Between\" in a career lasting over thirty years.\n\nBorn in Pimlico, London, Elen had worked as a barman and a draper's assistant and had packed eggs for the Co-op before becoming a singer. He began busking at an early age and found a position singing in a minstrel troupe. His solo success began in 1891 when he started performing in public houses, singing songs in a manner similar to many cockney fruit sellers and ironmongers of the time, known as costermongers. Because of this, he became known as a \"coster comedian\". For the stage persona he had created, Elen dressed in a coster uniform of striped jersey, peaked cap turned towards one ear and a short clay pipe in the side of his mouth. His characters adopted a persona of being constantly bad tempered and pugnacious. In 1907 he starred in a short film called \"Wait Till the Work Comes Round.\"\n\nIn his later years, Elen went to America owing to the English music hall strike which was taking place. Elen, performed the same act as he did in the UK, but box-office sales indicated that he was less successful than his friend, the singer Albert Chevalier, and so Elen returned to the UK. Elen then undertook various performances as a top attraction in music halls across London. He appeared on stage occasionally in the 1930s, albeit briefly, where he appeared in the 1935 Royal Command Performance. He retired in 1914, shortly after returning from America. He made occasional appearances on stage and film before his death in 1940 aged 77.\n\nElen was born at 103 Pulford Street, Pimlico, London. His father was Edwin Elen, a viewer of cloth in a military store, and Mercy Elen, née Letherbarrow.\nElen started his career as a solo performer and briefly worked at the Old Marylebone Theatre in a 'blackface' comedy double act with a man named Daniels, who died in a boating accident a few years after the partnership was formed. After the death of Daniels, he returned to being a solo performer and bought the rights to \"Never introduce your donah to a pal\" from the song's writer A.E Durandeau, (donah was cockney slang meaning girlfriend). The song was performed on stage on 4 June 1891, at Harewood's varieties in Hoxton. Elen performed songs and sketches as the character of an old east end costermonger and became known as a 'coster' comedian. Elen drew inspiration from his experiences of growing up around people, similar to that of his persona on stage. Elen's performances were often misinterpreted as being a self caricature, but were performed in a realistic and simplistic manner, one that made him popular with his audiences.\n\nIn an interview, given after he had become a star, he said:\nElen's songs were often compared to those of Albert Chevalier, a contemporary to Elen and a major performer on the halls. There were many other coster performers on the Victorian music hall circuit, but throughout his career Elen maintained a particularly friendly rivalry with Chevalier.\n\nThe movements for each of Elen's songs were carefully rehearsed so that the performances themselves were clean and precise. Each gesture was powerfully distinct and could be seen from the back of the largest theatre.\n\nMany of Elen's songs spoke of the living conditions of ordinary workers and about the cramped housing conditions of the East End. Commenting on the overcrowded poor parts of London, in one of his songs, he takes on the persona of a proud tenant boasting about the dismal place he lives in, and in particular the view from his 'garden':\nThe lyrics to \"If It Wasn't for the 'Ouses In Between\" were written by Edgar Bateman, who later wrote two more of Elen's songs: \"She's Too Good to Live Is Mrs. Carter\" and \"The Postman's 'Oliday.\" The music to the songs was written by George Le Brunn, who wrote a vast number of music-hall songs and accompaniments for Marie Lloyd and Dan Leno, and also for Gus Elen's \"It's a Great Big Shame\". Chance Newton, a friend of Elen, spoke of his habit of leaving scores he was working on at the various pubs he visited en route to the particular hall he was travelling to.\n\n\"If It Wasn't for the 'Ouses In Between\" is perhaps Elen's most recognisable song and is about the little backyards of London houses which are hemmed in by row upon row of other houses in all of the other streets in the neighbourhood. It is set in a typical working day of an east end costermonger.\n\nHis songs were bitter and realistic and rooted in the poverty and life of the East Enders who were his audience. The appeal to his audience, many of whom were poor, proved to be a relief to the working classes of society within London. His act would encourage his audience to laugh at the difficulties of working class life, and to celebrate one's capacity for survival. Some songs would go further and openly reject establishment values of hard work and moral rectitude. His song \"Wait until the work comes round\" was specifically written for the unemployed people of Victorian London.\n\nIn 1907, William Morris, a respected vaudeville performer in America, was sent to London by the czar of the American legitimate theatre, Abe Erlanger, who had formed \"The Advanced Vaudeville\". It was created to act as direct competition for the newly established Vaudeville Hegemony, which was operating in the eastern half of the USA. Whilst in London, Morris saw a performance of Elen's at the Hackney Empire and signed him to take part in the new company. Elen was offered $1,500 to work in the US. He accepted the offer and appeared on the same bill as Harry Lauder and Will Evans at The New York Theatre where he performed his repertoire of cockney songs to the delight of American audiences. \"The New York Times\" described his act as being \"...strange, raucous, quavering voice with its queer breaks into the treble, the shambling gait and the sudden jerky gestures of a coster, with all the little mannerisms that serve to make him what he is\". \n\nThe New York Dramatic News cited; \"While his act is, in a sense, similar to that of Albert Chevalier, it is also radically different. Mr. Elen portrays the coster as if he actually exists in his native element\".\nThe box-office sales indicated that Chevalier, who was also appearing in America, was more popular with American audiences than Elen and so he returned to the UK and performed for a further seven years as a top attraction in music halls across London, before his retirement.\n\nElen took early retirement in 1914 after 33 years of performing. He returned in the 1930s, albeit briefly, where he appeared in a film and in the 1935 \"Royal Command Performance\".\n\nUnlike most performers, Elen kept a meticulous record of his songs with notes about the gestures and emotions, props required and stage settings. He also wrote comments about how his performance was received. Elen was praised as an \"authentic cockney from the poor streets of London\" and was well known for his involvement in personally organised charity events. For many years he and his wife distributed free Christmas gifts to the poor in public.\n\nElen was a fiercely private person and although he was married with children, he would never refer to his family by their names when interviewed by the press. From 1898 Elen lived largely in Balham, where he bred poultry and took up photography. He also became a keen fisherman, particularly during a spell in residence on the south coast, and enjoyed shooting. Elen would not socialise with fellow artists, opting instead to go fishing, shooting or driving around the English countryside.\n\nElen died of liver cancer at his home in Balham, South London, on 17 February 1940, aged 77 and is buried in Streatham Park Cemetery. There is a blue plaque at his former home, 3 Thurleigh Avenue, Balham, which was erected by Greater London Council in 1984.\n\n"}

Hanna-Barbera Land was also opened in Houston, Texas.\n\nThe sections contained in the KECO Entertainment-owned parks was retained when their parent park, except the one in Australia, was bought by Paramount Communications (formerly Gulf+Western, and later acquired by Viacom), then the parent of Paramount Pictures, which changed the name of the parks by adding \"Paramount's\" in front of their names. The park in Australia was not purchased by Paramount and was sold to a local company. KECO Entertainment was renamed into Paramount Parks in 1994, around the time of the Viacom purchase, and remained in existence until 2006. As part of the 2005 Viacom split, ownership of Paramount Parks was transferred to the CBS Corporation. CBS then sold the parks to the Sandusky, Ohio-based amusement park management company Cedar Fair Entertainment Company on June 30, 2006.\n\nAs an effect of absorption of Hanna-Barbera into Warner Bros. Animation in 2001, the parks have largely removed or rebranded the areas into other children's sections by either the Nickelodeon brand and/or the Warner Bros. brand. Current Hanna-Barbera theme parks are Bedrock City in South Dakota, the one with the same name in Arizona, Camp Cartoon, located in Six Flags Great America, as part of Camp Cartoon section, and Yogi Bear's Jellystone Park Campground.\n\nTaft Broadcasting purchased Hanna-Barbera Productions, a television animation studio, in 1967. Two years later, it purchased Cincinnati's Coney Island amusement park, moving it and expanding it on a larger allotment of land, reopening it in 1972 as Kings Island. The company partnered with Top Value Enterprises to create Family Leisure Centers in 1973, opening Virginia's Kings Dominion in 1975; the company purchases Carowinds the same year. In 1979, Taft purchases 20% of the new Canada's Wonderland theme park in Toronto, Canada, which opens in 1981. The year prior, Family Entertainment Centers was dissolved, making Taft the sole owner of Kings Dominion.\n\nBy 1984, a grouping of senior executives from Taft's Amusement Park Group and some park managers purchase Taft's theme park division. The group names the resulting company Kings Entertainment Company (KECO). Taft gives KECO a perpetual license to use \nHanna-Barbera characters at all of their current parks. Australia's Wonderland, which opens in 1985, also licenses the characters, but 1989 KECO purchase Great America doesn't opt receive the license, or opt to separately license. In their first year of incorporation, KECO opened a short-lived Hanna-Barbera Land in Houston, Texas.\n\nThe Kings Entertainment Company theme parks all had Hanna-Barbera sections, some having \"The Flintstones\" sections, and Smurf sections, after the popularity of the 1980s television series \"The Smurfs\". Through the years, these parks have largely removed or rebranded the areas into other children's sections (under the Nickelodeon brand and the Paramount Parks-created name \"KidZVille\"). Any of the still operating parks are part of Cedar Fair Entertainment Company; Australia's Wonderland and the stand-alone Hanna-Barbera Land parks are both defunct.\n\nIn October 1989, animated film producer David Kirschner became Hanna-Barbera's president and CEO; Hanna-Barbera was part of the publicly traded Great American Broadcasting Company. He set out to make the company an entertainment conglomerate to rival Disney, by utilizing its existing core characters. Recognizing the Hanna-Barbera parks needed rejuvenation, he had the company create \"The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera\", a motion simulation-ride.\n\nCreated to be one of Universal Studios Florida's original attractions, \"The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera\" cost between $13 and $14 million, and opened June 7, 1990. They also opened a concept store at the exit to the attraction, for a chain of Hanna-Barbera stores they hoped to open. The attraction operated for 12 years, until it was closed October 20, 2002, to make room for Jimmy Neutron's Nicktoon Blast.\n\nHanna–Barbera Land was a theme park based on the cartoons of the Hanna-Barbera animation studio. It was located in the Spring CDP of unincorporated Harris County, Texas, United States, north of Houston. It was open in the 1984 and 1985 seasons.\nThe park was built under the guise of Taft Broadcasting, which became the Kings Entertainment Company as of opening. Kings also owned the Australia's Wonderland, Canada's Wonderland, Carowinds, Kings Dominion, and Kings Island theme parks. Despite increased attendance in 1985, a bad regional economy and minimal spending in the park on concessions, gift shop purchases, and souvenirs meant a death knell for the attraction.\nHanna–Barbera Land was sold to private investors and SplashTown USA was built in its place, then again to Bryant Morris, then to Six Flags who purchased the park in 1999. After initially not wanting to brand the park and calling it \"a member of the Six Flags family,\" Six Flags eventually decided to re-brand the park as Six Flags SplashTown. In 2007 the park was sold to PARC Management who continues to operate the site.\n\nHanna-Barbera Land opened in 1981 with three sections. The first section was Yogi's Woods, based on \"The Yogi Bear Show\", which featured the attractions Balloon Race, Yogi's Cave, Boo Boos Buggys, and the Woodland Theatre (now the Playhouse Theatre). Scoobyville was the central town site, where a carousel and other attractions were included. On the opposite end of Scoobyville from Yogi's Wood was Bedrock, based on \"The Flintstones\". Saltwater Circus was also in the section.\n\nIn 1984, Smurf Village replaced Yogi's Woods; the section featured the newly popular Hanna-Barbera cartoon \"The Smurfs\". A walk-through attraction, Smurf Village closed at the end of the 1992 season.\n\nFor the 1993 season, the Smurf Village section of the park became Kids Kingdom. In 1998, KidZVille replaced the Kids Kingdom and its two rides, the \"Kid's Castle Playland\" and the \"Jumbo Bumps\" were renamed to \"The Candy Factory\" and the \"Twizzler Twist\" (and renamed again the next year to \"Sour Cherry Blaster Twist\"). Along with five new rides for KidZVille, \"The Busy Little Town\" was launched, and it included the characters from Nickelodeon's \"Rugrats\" series. The Playhouse Theatre still had a Hanna-Barbera themed show, \"Scooby Doo's Scary School Daze\". On slower days, the Scooby-Doo walkaround character may venture through this section of the park.\n\nThe Bedrock section of the park met its end soon after, being replaced by Nickelodeon Central in 2003. Only the bumper cars were kept, turned into the \"Rugrats Toonpike\". The restaurant was de-themed, and turned into a Pizza Pizza.\n\nIn 2010, Hanna-Barbera Land was replaced with Planet Snoopy.\n\nHappy Land of Hanna-Barbera (1975-?)\n\nIn 1984, Carowinds added Smurf Island, which was a children's play area located on the 1.3-acre (5,300 m2) island surrounded by the Carolina Sternwheeler. Access to Smurf Island was gained in one of two ways – across the Carolina Sternwheeler and a ramp built on the island side of the boat, or on diesel-powered \"Smurf Boats\" launched from the area beside Harmony Hall. Children could enjoy two ball crawls and a climbing area complete with ropes, cargo nets, wood platforms, a rope tunnel and a 60-foot (18 m) tubular slide. Smurf characters roamed the island and led guests to the hidden Smurf village with four Smurf houses that children could enter. Smurf Island was eventually closed, and later demolished to make space for the BORG Assimilator, a Star Trek themed flying roller coaster. The Borg coaster is still operating today but the theming was removed in 2008 and the name was changed to Nighthawk.\n\nOpening in 1987, Smurf Woods featured a pint-sized steel coaster, The Blue Streak (now called Woodstock Express), as well as a Smurf village with mushroom houses. Smurf Woods was closed in 1995 and replaced with Nickelodeon Splat City. One Smurf house survived and can be seen in the Picnic Grove area. The area was renamed Planet Snoopy in 2010.\n\nThe Happy Land of Hanna-Barbera (1975–1997)\n\nThe earlier Land of the Dooz Mine Train attraction became Smurf Mountain. It was eventually closed to make room for the popular Volcano: The Blast Coaster in 1998.\n\nWhen Kings Island opened in 1972, one of its original themed areas was The Happy Land of Hanna Barbera. Original attractions included:\n\nAdditionally, the parking lot featured a combination of a Hanna-Barbera character and a number, to help guests remember their location at the end of the day.\n\nFlintstone's Boulder Bumpers was added to the park in 1976. The 1977 park season wrapped with The Peanut Olympics, between teams led by Billy Carter, United States President Carter's younger brother, and Yogi Bear. The two-day event was won by Carter.\n\nFor the park's 10th anniversary in 1982, it expanded Hanna-Barbera Land, spending $2.1 million on the new attractions. Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera attended the media preview on Monday, April 9 at 10 am. The new attractions were:\n\nThe Enchanted Voyage ride was closed in 1983, to be retrofitted to the upcoming Smurfs television series. \"The Smurfs' Enchanted Voyage\" debuted in 1984, while the television series was popular. People would ride in a boat around the world of the Smurfs celebrating the seasons of Winter, Fall, Summer, and Spring.\n\nThe Flying Carpet slide was moved to Hanna-Barbera Land in 1986, becoming Scrappy's Slide.\n\nFive rides were added to Hanna-Barbera Land in 1990. In 1994, Sunshine Turnpike was closed, to give more room for Hanna-Barbera Land. The Hanna-Barbera attraction received competition in 1995, from a \"Nickelodeon Splat City\" section. The park was purchased by Paramount Parks in 1992, and a $750,000 upgrade was made to the section; new attractions were The Enchanted Theatre, Scooby Zoom, Pixie and Dixie's Swingset, and Dick Dastardly's Biplanes. Additionally, the Smurf's Enchanted Voyage was retrofitted for $3.5 million, into the Phantom Theatre. In 1998, Scooby's Ghoster Coaster (their second Scooby-themed coaster), Yogi's Skytours, and Atom Ant's Airways were added to the park; Scooby Zoom was renamed Top Cat's Taxi Jam, and Flintstone Flybots turned into Jetson's Jet Orbiters.\n\nNickelodeon Central was added to the park in 2001, taking over parts of Parts of Rivertown and Hanna-Barbera Land. For seven years in a row, 2001–2008, the collective kids area at the park has received \"Amusement Today\" magazine's \"Golden Ticket for Best Kids' Area in the World in 2007\".\n\nThe area was removed at the end of the 2005 season, to make way for Nickelodeon Universe, featuring 18 \"new\" rides. Scooby-Doo and the Haunted Castle was the only ride to remain as-is, having been created in 2003 as a complete overhaul of the existing Phantom Theater ride. The attraction was the park's first interactive ride.\n\nThe replacement section has \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" and \"Dora the Explorer\"-themed neighbourhoods and 18 attractions.\n\n\nHanna-Barbera Land (1985–2002) at Australia's Wonderland (later named Wonderland Sydney) was largely based on the layout of the Canada's Wonderland park's section.\n\n\nIt was a prototype Caripo Batflyer suspended roller coaster (billed as the first suspended coaster for kids). The ride had poor capacity and roughness complaints. It was removed in 2005 as a part of the Hanna-Barbera Land retheming at Kings Island For Nickelodeon Universe. However, the attraction using the same name in the city of Doswell, Virginia and in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada was kept its name until 2010 when the Canadian version was renamed into simply Ghoster Coaster. In Doswell, Virginia, although the name was also simplified, the usual \"Scooby-Doo\" theme was kept.\n\nThemed to \"Scooby-Doo\", it was opened together with Kings Island in 1972. The second one was opened in 1974 at Kings Dominion, prior to the park's official 1975 opening. It was also opened in Carowinds. Paying homage to \"The Beast\" after its successful launch in 1979, a tunnel was added to the bottom of the first drop for the 1980 season, and the Kings Island version was renamed \"The Beastie\".\n\nWhen those two parks were under the ownership of Viacom, they started to add areas themed to the Nickelodeon television channel. In 2005, during the process of re-branding of the roller coaster as the \"Fairly Odd Coaster\", the wooden superstructure was painted indigo, and the cars repainted to mimic the characters, Cosmo and Wanda, from \"The Fairly OddParents\"; one train pink and the other green, with the fairies' faces on the front of the cars. To depict these characters as roller coaster trains is accurate to the television show because on screen, the fairies can change their shape at will, though their faces always remain visible on whatever they become.\n\nThe same thing was done to the Kings Island version a year later. Ironically, Cedar Fair purchased both of those parks as well as the three other parks that were owned by Viacom. Cedar Fair then decided to remove all remaining Hanna-Barbera and Nickelodeon themes from the kids area in time for the start of the 2010 season.\n\nUnusually, this attraction is a wild mouse roller coaster. It isn't located at any of the former Paramount Parks altogether. It was built in 2002, and located in Warner Bros. Movie World in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.\n\nThis attraction, that found in Carowinds, Kings Dominion, Kings Island and Canada's Wonderland take on the traditional dark ride. On this ride, the scenes feature ghosts and monsters that riders shoot at using laser-outfitted guns. Riders in consecutive cars compete with each other to see who can shoot the most ghosts. In the United Kingdom, it was called Scooby-Doo and the Haunted Castle. It was possibly themed to the TV show \"What's New, Scooby-Doo?\". The ride was re-themed on November 27, 2009, to remove the \"Scooby-Doo\" characters. The move is part of the park's broader move away from Hanna-Barbera characters. It became Boo Blasters on Boo Hill, a shooting dark ride themed to a large ghost.\n\nIt is located in the South Pie section of Hanna-Barbera Land, these were simple handcars on a track. The Kings Island version was removed to make way for the Nickelodeon Universe expansion.\n\nIt can be found currently in Movie Park Germany and also in Warner Bros. Movie World Australia. It was seen in Kings Island until 2005 due to the makeover to Nick Universe. It was known as a legal successor to the \"Flintstone Flybots\" and themed to \"The Jetsons\".\n\nThis was a Giant Slide originally called Flying Carpet Slide which was moved from Coney Island to the spot where Zephyr is today. It was later relocated to Hanna-Barbera Land for the 1986 season (about where Flying Ace Aerial Chase is today) and renamed to McScrappy's Slide. The attraction was removed indefinitely in 1995 to make way for the addition of \"Nickelodeon Splat City\".\n\nTwo attractions themed to the TV show \"Top Cat\", named Top Cat's Taxi Jam and The Alley Cat 500, were located in Kings Island and Kings Dominion. Rumors said that The Alley Cat 500 was the predecessor to the Swiper's Sweepers, which closed permanently in 2010 when Cedar Fair decided to remove all remaining Hanna-Barbera and Nickelodeon themes in time for the start of the 2010 season. Top Cat's Taxi Jam was the successor of Scooby Zoom. From 2006 to 2010, it was known as the Little Bill's Giggle Coaster. It was succeeded by The Great Pumpkin Coaster, which was introduced on September 8, 2009.\n\nNo attractions themed to \"Tom and Jerry\" appeared in all of the former Paramount Parks and the now-defunct Wonderland Sydney, although a promotion advertisement with Tom Cat holding a sign was shown in Canada's Wonderland prior to 2009. In addition, several attractions themed to \"The Flintstones\" also appear in theme parks in Abu Dhabi, and South Africa. Attractions associated with DC Comics, although can be found in every parks themed to Warner Bros., and had the show \"Super Friends\" (and also \"The Dukes\") that made also by Hanna-Barbera, never appear altogether in any of the Hanna-Barbera parks - it were always under WB control.\n\nAttractions to the shows such as \"The Powerpuff Girls\", \"Dexter's Laboratory\", and any other shows that co-produced with Cartoon Network Studios were unavailable in any of the Hanna-Barbera attractions. Also attractions themed to licensed non-\"Smurfs\" properties such as \"Snorks\", \"Pac-Man\" and \"Richie Rich\" were also not allowed. Majority, attractions themed to \"The Jetsons\" is usually the \"dominant\" attraction in every H-B parks.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1194122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1194122", "title": "Hell in the Pacific", "text": "Hell in the Pacific\n\nHell in the Pacific is a 1968 British-Japanese war drama film starring Lee Marvin and Toshirō Mifune, the only two actors in the entire film. It was directed by John Boorman. It looks at the importance of human contact and the bond which can form even between enemies if lacking other contact.\n\nTwo unnamed WWII servicemen, one American (Lee Marvin) and one Japanese (Toshiro Mifune), are stranded on an uninhabited Pacific island. The Japanese soldier suddenly discovers a military plane crash kit near his camp. The American, whose plane it recently came from, watches him salvage the kit and confronts him on the beach. After aggressive gestures from both men, the American notices that the Japanese has a small reservoir of drinking water and makes a dash to drink some, but is run off into the jungle. The Japanese sets fire to the jungle, smoking out the American. After chasing him off again, he wades out into the water to check his fishing trap. While his back is turned, the American makes another run for the drinking water, eventually stealing some and running off.\n\nThe next day, the American tries to steal more water, but is caught and falls on the reservoir, destroying it. After escaping, he destroys the fish trap, makes noises and plays tricks on the Japanese. After urinating on him from the cliff above, he's chased into the jungle by the infuriated Japanese, but collapses from dehydration. The Japanese takes him prisoner, binds his arms to a log and makes him walk back and forth in the sand. Eventually, the American escapes, surprises the Japanese and then binds \"him\" to the log and makes \"him\" walk back and forth in the sand. After getting frustrated trying to cook a meal, the American cuts the Japanese loose so that he can do the cooking. They cease hostilities and share chores and food from then on.\n\nLater, the American notices the Japanese trying to build a raft. He scolds him for stealing \"his\" log to make the raft and for being sneaky about its construction. After observing what a poor attempt the raft is, he gets the idea that they should build a better one together. They argue over the design, but eventually work together and build a large raft. After setting sail and overcoming the strong waves of the reef, they hit open water.\n\nDays later, they come upon a new set of islands, on one of which there appears to be an abandoned base. The Japanese takes the lead, since he recognizes it as a Japanese base. The American then spots American supplies and runs after him, imploring any soldiers who might hear to not fire because the Japanese is his \"friend\". At one point, startled by running into his friend, the American exclaims in relief, \"for a moment there, I thought you were a Jap\". Realizing that the base truly is abandoned, they rummage around for useful items and luxuries, eventually finding shaving supplies, a bottle of wine, cigarettes and an issue of \"Life\" magazine.\n\nThat night, each seeing the other clean shaven for the first time, they drink wine together, sing songs and tell each other stories, despite the language barrier. Casually, the Japanese picks up and looks through the \"Life\" magazine and is horrified to see photos of dead and imprisoned Japanese soldiers. The American, now a little drunk, gets upset that the Japanese isn't answering a question and the two angrily glare at one another, too upset to notice the increasingly loud sounds of the island being shelled. The Japanese stands up and walks a few paces away and the American gets up and kicks over the campfire. As the Japanese turns and walks back, a shell hits the building that they're in and destroys it. In the alternate ending (available on home video releases), no shell hit occurs and the two men are shown going their separate ways.\n\n\nThe film contains little dialogue, and much like its predecessor – the film \"None but the Brave\" – is not dubbed or sub-titled, thus authentically portraying the frustration of restricted communication between the Japanese- and English-speakers. The film was entirely shot in the Rock Islands of Palau in the north Pacific Ocean, near the Philippines in the Philippine Sea.\n\nThe film was originally released with a rather abrupt ending, one that left many dissatisfied with the outcome of the struggle these men endured. The subsequent DVD release has an alternative ending, which while leaving the eventual destiny of the two ambiguous, was much more in line with the overall direction of the film.\n\nBoth actors served for their respective countries during the Pacific War. Marvin, who was in the US Marines, was wounded and received the Purple Heart during the Battle of Saipan in 1944. Mifune served in the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service.\n\nThe film was perhaps too close to the end of the Second World War to stem inevitable anti-Japanese sentiments from the American public (which is presumably partly the purpose of the film). Both actors were hugely respected in their own countries at the time (Marvin had recently won an Oscar for \"Cat Ballou\" and Mifune was probably the most famous actor in Japan at the time). However, a largely dialogue-free and action-free film was too much to ask for great audience love, and neither actor was able to show their usual potential.\n\nThe film earned rentals of $1.33 million in North America and $1.9 million elsewhere. Because of the high costs involved, by 1973 the movie had recorded a loss of $4,115,000, making it one of the biggest money losers in the short history of ABC films.\n\n\n"}

It aired Sundays on MTV in the United States, and the feature film based on the same concept was released in 2003. It stars a group of reporters with developmental disabilities who interview celebrities and politicians. It is the continuation of a documentary film project started in 1999 by Arthur Bradford at Camp Jabberwocky in Martha's Vineyard, which was made into a movie of the same name and shown on HBO in 2003. \"South Park\" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone serve as the show's executive producers. Season One had a total of 6 episodes.\n\nAccording to the \"How's Your News?\" website on April 9, 2009, the show has not been renewed for a second season on MTV, stating:\n\n\"\"The decision had little to do with the quality of the series, which was one of the most enthusiastically received and best reviewed programs on mtv this year. It’s just a tough financial time and mtv needed to keep pushing for higher ratings with other shows. Also, we always knew that our series was an unusual fit for their style of programming. We’re not “The Hills” or “America’s Next Best Dance Crew” after all…\"\"\n\nAfter completing the feature film for HBO, the concept was pitched to the Trio network, who subsequently backed the short film \"On the Campaign Trail\", about the \"How's Your News?\" teams trip to both the Democratic and Republican conventions in 2004. The half-hour film was broadcast on Trio and Channel Four England and featured candid interviews with Hillary Clinton, John McCain, Andre 3000, Ben Affleck, Howard Dean, Michael Moore and Newt Gingrich, amongst others.

The first events were no holds barred contests inspired by the Ultimate Fighting Championship and gained an international reputation for its hardcore nature.

Founded by Sergio Batarelli, it became one of the most important Vale Tudo tournaments in Brazil during its existence. While the UFC fights were held in an octagon, the IVC kept the normal ring shape. A fight lasted a maximum of 30 minutes. It was not uncommon for fighters to get a hand broken, lose teeth or receive cuts in their faces. An IVC in 1999 concluded with 8 out of 10 matches finished with strikes.\n\nAfter 14 events, the state of São Paulo (where the promotion was based) prohibited the sanctioning of the Vale Tudo fights, and the event entered an hiatus period.

{"id": "20639915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20639915", "title": "Jana Natya Manch", "text": "Jana Natya Manch\n\nJana Natya Manch (People's Theatre Front; Janam for short) is a New Delhi-based amateur theatre company specialising in left-wing street theatre in Hindi. It was founded in 1973 by a group of Delhi's radical theatre amateurs who sought to take theatre to the people. Theatre personality Safdar Hashmi is the best-known figure associated with the troupe.\n\nJanam collects donations after each performance and funds its work in this manner. As a matter of policy, the group does not accept donations or grants from state, corporate or NGO agencies. The company does street as well as open-air proscenium performances, and also occasionally organises talks, discussions, workshops, exhibitions, film shows, etc.\n\nThe company has performed its plays in festivals organised by Prithvi Theatre (Mumbai), National School of Drama (New Delhi), Sahitya Kala Parishad (New Delhi), Natrang Pratishthan (New Delhi), Sangeet Natak Akademi (Kerala), Natya Akademi (West Bengal) and others.\n\nSo far this group of self-trained actors has done over 8,500 performances of nearly 80-odd street plays and 16 proscenium plays in about 140 cities in India. The company has performed outside India once, in spring 2007, when they toured the United States, performing, lecturing and conducting workshops on several university and colleges campuses.\n\nJanam was founded in 1973 by a group of Delhi’s left-wing theatre amateurs, who sought to take theatre to the people. It was inspired by the spirit of the Indian People’s Theatre Association (IPTA). Its early plays, though initially designed for the proscenium, were performed on makeshift stages and chaupals in the big and small towns and villages of North India. It also experimented with street skits.\n\nJanam’s street theatre journey began in October 1978. The first play \"Machine\" with lyrical, stylised dialogues depicted the exploitation of industrial labour. Janam has played a significant role in popularising street theatre as a form of voicing anger and public opinion. It has done plays on price rise, elections, communalism, economic policy, unemployment, trade union rights, globalisation, women’s rights, education system, etc. Some of its best-known street plays are \"Hatyare\", \"Samrath ko Nahi Dosh Gosain\", \"Aurat\", \"Raja ka Baja\", \"Apaharan Bhaichare Ka\", \"Halla Bol\", \"Mat Banto Insaan Ko\", \"Sangharsh Karenge Jitenge\", \"Andhera Aaftaab Mangega\", \"Jinhe Yakeen Nahin Tha\", \"Aartanaad\", \"Rahul Boxer\", \"Nahin Qabul\", \"Voh Bol Uthi\" and \"Yeh Dil Mange More Guruji\".\n\nThis form of theatre has become a vital cultural tool for workers, revolutionaries and social activists. Street theatre addresses topical events and social phenomenon and takes them straight to peoples’ places of work and residence.\n\nSafdar Hashmi was Janam's Convenor, who was killed in performance in 1989. The attack on Janam took place on 1 January that year, in Sahibabad, an industrial township on the outskirts of Delhi. The play being performed was \"Halla Bol\", in support of workers' demands. This play, and its previous version \"Chakka Jam\", were both done in support of a seven-day strike of industrial workers in November 1988. A spectator, Ram Bahadur, was also killed in the attack. There were massive protests all over the country following this murder and these protests led eventually to the formation of the Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust (Sahmat) in Delhi.\n\nHashmi, a founder member of Janam, was a brilliant theoretician and practitioner of political theatre, especially street theatre. A versatile personality, he was a playwright, a lyricist, a theatre director, a designer and an organiser. He also wrote for children. His film scripts were much acclaimed. He wrote on various aspects of culture and related issues in journals and newspapers. Safdar was a member of the C.P.I. (M). In recognition of his contribution to the street theatre movement and to the growth of a democratic culture, the University of Calcutta in 1989 conferred on Safdar the degree of D.Litt. posthumously.\n\nSafdar was born to Haneef Hashmi and Qamar Azad on 12 April 1954 in Delhi. He spent his childhood in Aligarh and finished his schooling in Delhi. He did his M.A. in English literature from University of Delhi. After short stints of teaching in the universities of Garhwal, Kashmir and Delhi he worked in the Press Institute of India and then joined as the Press Information Officer of the Govt. of West Bengal in Delhi. In 1984 he gave up his job to work full-time as a political cultural activist. In 1980, Habib Tanvir directed the play \"Moti Ram ka Satyagraha\" for Janam.\n\nEvery year, Janam and CITU jointly organise an event to commemorate Hashmi's martyrdom at Jhandapur, at the same place where the 1989 attack had taken place.\n\nSince 1989 Janam has been engaged in both street and proscenium theatre (including \"Moteram ka Satyagraha\", \"Satyashodhak\", \"Varun ke Bete\", \"Hum Yahin Rahenge\", \"Ek Aurat Hypatia Bhi Thi\"). In 1993 it began a bilingual theatre quarterly \"Nukkad Janam Samvaad\" and also instituted the Safdar Hashmi Memorial Lecture series.\n\nAmong Janam’s recent proscenium plays is \"Aazadi Ne Jab Dastak Di\", based on Manini Chatterjee’s book \"Do and Die\". In January 2004, Janam created \"Bush ka Matlab Jhadi\" (Bush is a just a bush!), a multimedia presentation celebrating the anti-imperialist sentiment the world over. The play used giant masks, video projection, and live music to create a hilarious expose of the US-UK role in Iraq, their ambitions of world conquest, and the people’s resistance to it. The play was the outcome of Janam’s collaboration with many artists including Surajit Sarkar (video artist), Arunkumar (sculptor), Kriti Arora (artist), Kanishka Prasad (architect), and Ashish Ghosh (music director). This 45-minute play was commissioned by the World Social Forum in Mumbai.\n\nLater in 2004 Janam produced a proscenium play \"Shambookvadh\" on the question of caste. This play is scripted by Brijesh, has music by Kajal Ghosh, and is directed by Sudhanva Deshpande. The play was invited to the National School of Drama’s theatre festival in 2006, and to the Prithvi Festival in November 2006. In the summer of 2008, Janam produced \"Ulte Hor Zamaaney Aye\", a proscenium play written by Brijesh, with music by Kajal Ghosh and directed by Sudhanva Deshpande. This was a black comedy about a woman who struggles to get treatment for her husband, who is initially mistaken for a bomb blast victim in a hospital, but dropped like a hot brick when they find out he is actually an industrial worker.\n\nAmong Janam’s recent street plays, \"Yeh Dil Mange More Guruji\" is on the attempts of the Hindu Right brigade to destroy India’s secular and democratic framework; \"Aakhri Juloos\" is on the right to protest; \"Yeh Bhi Hinsa Hai\" is a play against the growing violence on women; \"One Two ka Four\" is a reworked version of an earlier play, \"Nahi Qubool\", on the nuclear deal; \"Yeh Hum Kyon Sahen\" is on the conditions of workers in and around Delhi.\n\nIn 1997 Janam constructed an innovative and dismantleable mobile theatre, Safar (acronym for Safdar Rangmanch), to take proscenium plays to working class areas. Safar is a flexible, innovative structure designed by Janak Mistry. It is set up by the actors of Janam wherever they go to perform their large proscenium plays, and is equipped with lights and a sound system. It can be used for a variety of purposes, and various kinds of spaces can be created in it. It can seat about 600-700 people.\n\nIn 2012, Janam moved into its own space. Located about 6 km west of Connaught Place is a neighbourhood known as Shadi Khampur, where the group has created a small black box theatre, called Studio Safdar. Janam also has premises on the top floor of the same building, and uses the open terrace to do its own rehearsals. Studio Safdar is envisaged as a space that can used by theatre and other artists to experiment in, create new work, and to show it. The larger idea of how the space came into being and the activities therein within the first year of its establishment are explained by Sudhanva Deshpande in interviews here and here. Next door to Studio Safdar is the May Day Bookstore and Cafe, managed and run by LeftWord Books.\nThe 1989 Hindi film, \"Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro\", directed by Saeed Akhtar Mirza, was dedicated to the memory of Safdar Hashmi. The 2008 Hindi film, \"Halla Bol\", directed by Rajkumar Santoshi, was inspired by his life of founder Safdar Hashmi, and also depicts a scene, where a street theatre activist is shown being beaten by political goons, but turns into a catalyst for public uprising in the film.\n\n\n"}

He was a booking agent for, and became a close personal friend of the prominent magician, Harry Houdini.\n\nMartin Beck was born to a Jewish family on July 31, 1868, in Liptovský Mikuláš, a town in northern Slovakia that at the time of his birth was ruled by the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He went with a group of actors on the SS Elbe from Bremen, Germany, to the United States in May 1884, where he worked as a waiter in a beer garden in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nHe went to San Francisco with the Schiller Vaudeville Company, then gained citizenship in the United States in October 1889. When the Orpheum Theatre in San Francisco was bought by Morris Meyerfeld Jr. in 1899, he worked with Morris to acquire more theaters. By 1905, Beck was running the organization.\n\nIn 1910 he formed the United Booking Offices with Alfred Butt.\n\nIn the spring of 1899, Beck met Harry Houdini, who was then performing at a beer hall in St. Paul, Minnesota. Beck saw Houdini struggling with magic, so he made an offer, Beck telegraphed Houdini when he got to his next stop in Chicago: \"You can open Omaha, March twenty sixth, sixty dollars, will see act probably make you proposition for all next season.\"\n\nAccording to Houdini's wife when speaking to a biographer years later, this represented Houdini's big break in his professional career as a performing magician. As Houdini wrote at the bottom of the telegram, which she had carefully preserved: \"This wire changed my whole Life's journey.\"\n\nBeck and Houdini became close personal friends. Beck advised Houdini to concentrate on his escape acts, and booked him on the Orpheum vaudeville circuit. Within months, Houdini was performing at the top vaudeville houses all over the United States, and in 1900, Beck arranged for him to tour Europe.\n\nHe built the Palace Theatre in New York City in 1913.\n\nHe was voted out of the presidency of Orpheum Circuit in a boardroom coup after it went public in 1923. Later that same year, he opened the Martin Beck Theater in New York City (renamed the Al Hirschfeld Theatre in 2003).\n\nOn January 28, 1928, Orpheum Circuit was merged with the theater chain started by Benjamin Franklin Keith and Edward Franklin Albee II to form Keith-Albee-Orpheum. A few months later, Joseph P.

The game is based in an American natural history museum and aims to teach the player many aspects of history such as technology, geology, space, American history, and prehistory. PC Magazine described the game as having kids learn about educational topics (i.e. ecology) while making logical deductions in a series sequence and solving puzzles.\n\nThe game starts in the bedroom of an American high school teenage boy who is seated at his computer, attempting to access the National Museum Interactive Service System, only to see that it is offline for repair. An interactive robot from the museum named MICK (Museum Interactive Computer Kiosk) appears onscreen and talks to the boy, explaining that the museum is in danger of losing its secrets forever.\n\nThe boy appears to have an extraordinary relationship with MICK as he alone understands that MICK can talk back to him, which he uses to learn more about the contents of the museum. MICK recognizes this understanding and thus asks the boy for help to save the museum. MICK explains that the exhibits have come to life and are acting very strangely. He announces his suspicion that a virus has infected the system while the museum was being converted to complete autonomous computer control.\n\nThe player takes the role of the boy and enters the museum. Through the game, the boy visits each of the exhibits, solving mysteries and puzzles by talking to the historical characters, rearranging objects, trading objects with characters and generally putting things back the way they were.\n\nThe game is educationally-based, and the player learns both from the many museum-like information cards placed throughout the exhibits, as well as from solving the problems in the exhibits themselves. Along the way, the boy is aided by MICK, who follows him through the exhibits, instructs him and gives additional help and advice on request.\n\nOnce the 25 exhibits are restored, the virus itself must be destroyed, which is the final puzzle to be solved.\n\nThe exhibits in the museum, which can be entered by clicking a box on the map in the Main Hall, and can be revisited if not completed (the user can exit an exhibit at any time and return later), are shown by the map to be split into five sections:\n\n\nThe player begins by entering the museum through the basement, working out the basement door's passcode. The player navigates the way into the Main Hall of the museum by a series of numbered doors with corresponding keys which are to be located in the maze of the basement (this introductory location can be skipped if desired).\n\nOnce in the Main Hall, the player must locate some batteries to power MICK, which can be found in one of the museum tour tape players. Additionally, the map of the museum on the wall in the Main Hall is found to be in pieces and needs to be reconstructed in order to continue.\n\nThen the player must choose an exhibit to try to repair, using the museum's map to select one. After attempting to repair an exhibit, the player is returned to the Main Hall to select another exhibit. Not until every single one of the exhibits has been returned to normal can the player progress in the game.\n\nWhen each of the exhibits have been restored, the player returns to the Main Hall to find MICK missing and a cassette tape in his place on the floor. Using one of the museum tape players from which the batteries used to power MICK were borrowed, the player can listen to the tape (shown as on-screen text), which consists of a message from MICK warning the player to go home; the player decides to follow MICK into the basement and finds him in pieces on a bench in the workshop. Upon reassembling MICK, the player must then access the computer to try to stop the virus by answering general knowledge questions. If the player is successful, the virus self-destructs and the museum is saved, and the game is complete.\n\n"}

The game was released in June 2017 for the PlayStation 4 video game console and Windows-based personal computers. Tentatively known as \"The Jarvis Project\" during development, veteran arcade game designer Eugene Jarvis served as a creative consultant on the project.\n\n\"Nex Machina\" is a twin-stick shoot 'em up video game played from a top-down perspective. Players move through rooms shooting waves of enemies while attempting to save humans. Power-ups and weapon upgrades are dispersed throughout levels.\n\n\"Nex Machina\" was developed by Finnish video game studio Housemarque with designer Eugene Jarvis serving as a creative consultant. Jarvis is known for his role in designing arcade shoot 'em ups such as \"Defender\" (1981), \"\" (1982), and \"Smash TV\" (1990). At the 2014 D.I.C.E. Awards, Housemarque's founders Ilari Kuittinen and Harri Tikkanen met with Jarvis and asked him if he would be interested in collaborating on a game. Jarvis' games, particularly \"Defender\", were a source of inspiration for Housemarque's 2013 game \"Resogun\". For the design of \"Nex Machina\", they combined elements from Jarvis' previous shoot 'em ups and \"Resogun\". The development team experimented with different setups for the game's firing mechanics. They followed a different design philosophy than their 2016 game \"Alienation\" by choosing not to incorporate character progression systems in \"Nex Machina\".\n\n\"Nex Machina\" is powered by a significantly enhanced version of the game engine and voxel technology that was used for \"Resogun\". The inclusion of a volumetric rendering technique known as Signed Distance Fields allows for a smooth transition between complex 3D meshes and voxel particles to give them more flexibility in how objects appear on the screen. The studio dubbed their art style for the game as cablepunk—a darker take on cyberpunk.\n\n\"Nex Machina\" was unveiled at the PlayStation Experience in December 2016. Housemarque signed a deal with Sony Interactive Entertainment to bring the game to the PlayStation 4 video game console. In March 2017, Housemarque announced that the game will also be released on Windows-based personal computers. \"Nex Machina\" was released on 20 June 2017; it is Housemarque's first self-published game. Housemarque is also considering creating a \"Nex Machina\" arcade cabinet with Jarvis' company Raw Thrills.\n\nThe game received generally positive reviews from critics. Metacritic calculated an average score of 88 out of 100 for the PlayStation 4 version based on 45 reviews and 84 out of 100 for the Windows version based on 16 reviews.\n\n\"Eurogamer\" ranked the game eighth on their list of the \"Top 50 Games of 2017\".\n\nThe game was nominated for \"PlayStation Game of the Year\" at the Golden Joystick Awards, for \"Best PC Game\" in \"Destructoid\"s Game of the Year Awards 2017, and for \"Best Action Game\" in IGN's Best of 2017 Awards. It won the award for \"Best Indie Action Game\" in \"Game Informer\"s 2017 Action Game of the Year Awards. It won \"Big Screen Game of the Year 2017\" and \"Finnish Game of the Year 2017\" in the Finnish Game Awards 2018, and was also nominated for \"Visual Design\" and \"Music Design\" at the 2018 Develop Awards.\n"}

They also maintain an active education programme and run community projects that allow non-professional performers to devise circus work, working alongside the company's own professionals. \n\nThe company's first large-scale show \"Immortal\" was described by the Scotsman newspaper as circus that \"celebrates the human soul rather than just the human body\", and elsewhere lauded as \"rich, powerful stuff [...] overwhelming in its diversity of ideas\". Writing in \"The Times\", dance critic Donald Hutera gave a more measured response, saying that it was better to \"surrender to the show's deceptively shambolic quicksilver atmosphere\" than concentrate overmuch on the plot. \"Immortal\" won a Tap Water Award, an Editor's Choice Award from threeweeks.co.uk, and The Jury Award at Spain's Tarrega Festival. \n\nNoFit State's next show, \"Tabú\", premiered at Tredegar Park, Newport in April 2008, and has been touring Britain and Europe in the time since. Directed by Firenza Guidi, who also worked on \"Immortal\", \"Tabú\" shares much of \"Immortal\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s visual and narrative style, and carries over some of the old cast. It has received mixed reviews. Lyn Gardner writing for \"The Guardian\" called it \"fabulous stuff that owes more to contemporary dance and experimental theatre than it does to sawdust and elephants\", but others have criticised that the live show seems to have \"no connection with the programme's bogglingly detailed back story\", and that the circus skills on display \"don't dramatise the original concept\".\n\nIn 2012, the company developed their show \"BIANCO: Time For Beauty\" in partnership with the Eden Project. The promenade show, also directed by Firenza Guidi, ran in the tented performance space throughout the summer, and was described by This Is Cornwall as \"an incredible experience\". The show was then redeveloped to incorporate new ideas, acts and performers in 2013 to become \"BIANCO: Turning Savage\". It opened at The Roundhouse in April 2013, and was praised by the Guardian newspaper for \"combining first-rate skills with a joyful, unashamed pleasure\". BIANCO: Turning Savage went on to tour venues across the UK in NoFit State's custom-designed big top spaceship tent, including a sell-out run at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August 2013. In 2014 the show toured to Perth, Australia, and around Europe and will continue touring in 2015.\n\nNoFit State's show NOODLES premiered at the 2013 Edinburgh Fringe Festival. The production, by Finnish circus director Maksim Komaro, is staged in a traditional theatre setting and received mixed reviews.\n\nThe company are also known for their outdoor work. Both \"Parklife\" and \"Open House\" were directed by Orit Azaz, and operate by inviting local amateur and professional performance groups to train in public with NoFit State performers. \"Barricade\", also directed by Azaz, is a large-scale outdoor performance which has played to audiences in the UK and France. The company's most recent outdoor production directed by Azaz is called Open House and combines performance with community engagement.\n\nSince 2006 NoFit State have been running a permanent training space / school in Cardiff. They provide a variety of aerial and ground-based classes for all experience levels, including ropes, silks, aerial hoop, static trapeze, acrobalance and juggling. Their training space also houses Wales' only flying trapeze rig. The company run a successful Youth Circus programme, and students have since gone on to study at Circomedia.\n\nIn January 2015, NoFit State was invited to the south of France as a featured company at the first edition of the Biennale Internationale des Arts du Cirque.\n\nOn 11 December 2015, the company launched a special 30th anniversary exhibition at its Four Elms building in Adamsdown, Cardiff, as well as a brand new NoFit State E-Archive, which details the company's 30-year history from juggling club beginnings to acclaimed global success. On the same night, the company's co-founder and one of its creative directors, Ali Williams, announced that she was to step down from her current role with the company later in 2016. \n\nIn 2016, the NoFit State celebrates its 30th anniversary. In February it will make its Chinese Premiere performing BIANCO at Queen Elizabeth Stadium in Hong Kong, and later on in May, the company will make its US debut in partnership with St Ann's Warehouse in New York City.\n\n\n"}

El Arranque's debut album, \"Tango\" (1998), was sponsored by two legendary figures of the tango world, Leopoldo Federico and Nelly Omar and brought national and international acclaim. In June–July of that same year El Arranque embarked on their first tour to Europe, performing at Tangomania Summer Festival '98 in Bologna, Italy, in Berlin, Stuttgart and Dresden. In December, the orchestra was selected by the Government of the City of Buenos Aires to play for the closing night of the first Festival Internacional de Tango de Buenos Aires with a large outdoor performance on Avenida Corrientes, which was turned into a milonga for the occasion. This event was a huge success for the orchestra and led the Argentine newspapers Clarín and La Nación to describe El Arranque as “the Tango revelation of the year”.\n\n1999 saw the beginning of a second 2-month long European tour of 12 cities, including London, Paris, and Milan. In December, El Arranque was invited again to close the second Festival Internacional de Tango de Buenos Aires.\n\nBy the year 2000 the group had established itself as the most important young tango orchestra in the world. In October of that same year El Arranque performed at Romaeuropa Festival in Rome, Italy for the \"Tango: Buenos Aires a Roma\" series of concerts. After performing in Lausanne and Padua El Arranque returned to Buenos Aires to record their second CD, \"Cabulero\", sponsored by José Libertella, founder and director of the prestigious Sexteto Mayor.\n\nIn January and February 2001, El Arranque toured fifteen cities in The Netherlands with the show \"Tango de Buenos Aires\". In March they returned to Buenos Aires to premiere \"Cabulero\", which also includes a music video as its last track. In May El Arranque performed in New York City with the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, directed by Wynton Marsalis. These concerts included original music (Concerto Grosso, for seven tango musicians and a symphony orchestra, and Suite Borgeana, in seven movements) written for both orchestras by both Wynton Marsalis and by Ramiro Gallo, El Arranque's first violinist. In June the orchestra performed at the Théâtre national de Chaillot in Paris during the Buenos Aires Tango series of concerts. El Arranque ended 2001 with several other performances in Buenos Aires and two more European tours (Festival del Grec in Barcelona, Teatro Trinidade in Lisbon, Festival de Otoño in Madrid and various cities in Germany).\n\nFrom January to March 2002, El Arranque played 50 concerts in 40 Japanese cities and 10 in Taiwan on the famous Min-On Concert Association Tour. In April, the orchestra performed two concerts at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC for the Americartes Festival and returned to Buenos Aires to launch their third CD, \"Clásicos\". This CD has sold almost 10,000 copies in Argentina alone, becoming one of the tango best sellers of 2002.\n\nEl Arranque travelled to Europe again in November 2002 to record their first live CD, \"En Vivo en la Rete Due de Suiza\". The concert was held in the famous auditorium of Rete 2 Radio in Lugano, Switzerland. The album came out in two versions, a regular one and one with a full-colour book of photographs and quotes, packaged in a hard cover. The tour continued in Italy, Germany and London, with five concerts at Porchester Hall.\n\nIn January 2003 El Arranque toured 10 cities in Norway under the auspices of the Norwegian Concert Institute. In February the orchestra took part in the fifth edition of the Festival Internacional de Tango de Buenos Aires, performing before 20,000 people in Avenida Corrientes. Meanwhile, El Arranque also performed once a week in Club del Vino, a music club in Buenos Aires. That same year the group took part in the production and recording of the new CD of tango singer Lidia Borda, \"Tal vez será su voz\", and in November toured Colombia for the first time.\n\nIn March 2004, El Arranque won the Carlos Gardel Award for Best Tango Recording of 2003 with their live CD \"En Vivo en la Rete Due de Suiza\". In June the orchestra was invited to take part in the 2004 Genova Tango Festival in Genoa, Italy. The special repertoire it prepared for the occasion included works by maestros Néstor Marconi, Julio Pane, Raúl Garello and Mauricio Marcelli, as invited soloists and composers, with special arrangements by Ramiro Gallo. This extraordinary intergenerational collaboration inspired El Arranque's fifth CD, \"Maestros\". In November 2004 El Arranque was invited to the USA to perform in the International Music and Performing Arts in Communities Tour (IMPACT), presented by the Ohio Arts Council (OAC) in partnership with the Ohio Arts Presenters Network (OAPN), Arts Midwest and the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts with shows in Lancaster, Cleveland, Akron, Dayton, Cincinnati, Sandusky, Springfield, Urbana, Columbus, Newark and Dover in Ohio and in Erie, Allegheny College in Meadville, and Franklin, Pennsylvania. The year ended with performances in Chile and Uruguay and the orchestra was nominated for the Latin Grammy awards.\n\n2005 began with a new tour of Japan, organised once again by the Min On Association, in the wake of El Arranque's huge success in that country. In the space of two months they performed 46 concerts in such cities as Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and Sapporo. That same year El Arranque also toured Brazil for the first time, performing in important theatres such as Guairão in Curitiba and Canecão in Rio de Janeiro. The year ended with a series of concerts in the Solís theatre in Montevideo, Uruguay, performances within the framework of the Joventango Festival, and the opening of the Cultural Carnival of Valparaíso in Plaza Sotomayor in front of an audience of over 10,000 people.\n\nIn June 2006 the orchestra took part once again in the Buenos Aires Tango III Festival in Chaillot National Theatre in Paris, and also performed again in Stuttgart. In September, El Arranque performed in the first Buenos Aires Tango Festival at the Auditorium Parco della Musica in Rome and in the Biennale de la Danse in Lyon. In December they celebrated their 10-year anniversary with a series of concerts in the club La Trastienda in Buenos Aires, with their colleagues Lidia Borda, Ariel Ardit, Ramiro Gallo and many more who had taken part in the project over the last decade.\n\nMarch 2007 saw their first trip to Hong Kong to take part in the 35th Hong Kong Arts Festival. They also received the Juan Canaro Prize as the revelation in tango of the last decade, awarded by SADAIC. The orchestra then took part for the second time in the XV Llao Llao Music Week in Bariloche.\n\nIn 2008, four years after the release of their last album, El Arranque premiered their sixth CD, \"Nuevos\", in the 25 de Mayo theatre in Buenos Aires. Its sixteen tracks feature the best original works by El Arranque's own musicians and colleagues of their generation. The album came out in two versions, a regular one and a full-colour hard cover boxed set featuring a snakes-and-ladders cum trivia type game inspired by El Arranque's various experiences in the world of tango during the last 12 years. The game features miniature cardboard cutouts of the various members of the group and a miniature die, as well as a trivia booklet. In September the orchestra travelled back to Rome to take part in the second edition of the Buenos Aires Tango Festival at the Auditorium Parco della Musica.\n\nOn 30 November 2011 they won the Premio Gardel (Argentina) for Best Album of a Tango Orchestra with their new cd Raras Partituras 6, recorded with Leopoldo Federico.\n\n\n\n"}

World's Greatest Shows was a circus founded in Baraboo, Wisconsin, United States in 1884 by five of the seven Ringling brothers: Albert, August, Otto, Alfred T., Charles, John, and Henry. The Ringling brothers were sons of a German immigrant, August Frederick Ruengling, who simplified his name to Ringling once in America. Four brothers were born in McGregor, Iowa: Alf T., Charles, John and Henry. The Ringling family lived in McGregor, Iowa for twelve years, from 1860 until 1872. The family then lived in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, and moved to Baraboo, Wisconsin in 1875.\nIn 1907 Ringling Bros. acquired the Barnum & Bailey Circus, merging them in 1919 to become Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, promoted as \"The Greatest Show on Earth\".\n\nIn 1882, before the Ringling brothers created their first circus, the five brothers performed skits and juggling routines in town halls around the state of Wisconsin. Their first show was on November 27, 1882, in Mazomanie, Wisconsin. They called this the \"Ringling Bros. Variety Performance\" when they took the show to the next town. With two wandering performers the next year, the brothers toured the Northwest. After the Northwest tour, they used the money earned for suits.\n\nThey expanded their acts into a one ring show in 1884. The show added a trick horse and a bear at the end of the season. The circus started traveling by trains in 1888 allowing the show to consistently expand.\n\nRingling Circus purchased the Yankee Robinson Circus and opened a joint show on May 19, 1884. This brought them to the attention of James Anthony Bailey of Barnum and Bailey's Circus as a viable competitor. The brothers met with Bailey thus agreeing to a division of areas. This was followed by them purchasing a half share of the Adam Forepaugh Sells Brothers Circus from Bailey. Bailey, under the area division, prohibited the Ringlings from playing at the Madison Garden, a location that was the brothers' ambition to perform at. In 1887 Ringling Circus changed its official title to the \"Ringling Bros. United Monster Shows, Great Double Circus, Royal European Menagerie, Museum, Caravan, and Congress of Trained Animals.\"\n\nIn 1906, Bailey died which led to the Ringlings taking over Forepaugh-Sells, which continued to operate separately. In October 1907, the stockholders of Barnum and Bailey's Circus approved the sale of the circus to the Ringlings. Due to World War I, Ringlings Circus and Barnum and Bailey's Circus were merged in 1919 as Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.\n\n"}

Federal legislation was passed to help protect television viewers living in extraterritorial and border areas from losing local television stations where viewers are living outside of the DMA.\n\nIn 2005, the FCC completed a federal study on all of the media markets in the United States. It came up with a list of counties in each state where out-of-market television stations are significantly viewed by residents who are using antennas, whether or not they are cable or satellite subscribers. The study also looked at the history of viewership of the original Community Access Television (CATV) installations throughout the country. CATV is the predecessor of cable television. Today's cable television content is much more focused on premium channel television programming than the original purpose of picking up local programming from television stations in a specific area.\n\nWith the advancement of digital cable, cable providers such as Comcast and Time Warner Cable have begun making headway in removing out-of-market television stations from basic cable lineups. This is done by cable providers to preserve bandwidth on channels 2 to 13, but also to reduce the redundancy of multiple network affiliates, and to fulfill federal mandates to keep in-market local affiliates. Some cable providers, with out-of-market and redundant affiliate stations in the past, have moved over the out-of-market stations to digital cable channels 100 and above and in the majority of cases, are not transmitted in high definition to allow in-market affiliates the prestige of carrying the programming as intended by their networks rather than the cut seen on standard definition feeds. Many cable providers nationwide are not doing this, since they are removing SV stations entirely from the cable lineup. This has led to some controversy in some parts of the country. The forerunners in the SV stations moving over to digital cable have been on-going since 2005 for several Comcast service areas in New Jersey and Virginia, and a few Time Warner Cable systems in North Carolina. The comments against the removals have mainly occurred in significantly viewed counties that are bordering nearby television markets.\n\nTwo examples of the SV channel preservation on digital cable and at the same time, CATV favoring a non-designated DMA is Belvidere, New Jersey along the Delaware River. Phillipsburg, Milford, Frenchtown, and Lambertville, all downstream on the Delaware River, sometimes lean towards this as well. Belvidere used to lean towards the Philadelphia market solely on television reception, since it was not able to receive New York City area stations. However, since it is located in Warren County, it is officially part of the New York City television market. When cable providers advanced with premium programming and later digital cable service, the Philadelphia stations disappeared from basic cable tiers but KYW-TV, WCAU and WTXF-TV were later moved to the digital cable tier.\n\nAn example of redundant affiliates serving the same area is Harrisonburg, Virginia. The Harrisonburg DMA consists of two Virginia counties and one West Virginia county. Harrisonburg is a fringe area because it is 100 miles from Washington, D.C.; Richmond, Virginia; and Roanoke, Virginia. It was originally part of the Richmond DMA. It is approximately 40 miles away from Charlottesville, Virginia, which is a separate media market that was also once part of the Richmond DMA. Comcast's Harrisonburg system carries two ABC affiliates (in-market affiliate WHSV-TV and Richmond station WRIC-TV), four NBC affiliates (WVIR out of Charlottesville, WRC-TV out of Washington, D.C., WSLS out of Roanoke, and WWBT out of Richmond), two CBS affiliates (WUSA out of Washington, D.C. and WTVR out of Richmond), two Fox affiliates (WHSV's second digital subchannel and WTTG out of Washington, D.C.).\n\nThe Harrisonburg market has only one station for PBS (in-market member station WVPT); the market's other network affiliates are WHSV's MyNetworkTV-affiliated third digital subchannel and a CW-affiliated subchannel of WVIR. Prior to 2006, many of these stations were on the same basic cable tier, but were dropped to preserve bandwidth and eliminate the redundancy of multiple affiliates. All of the stations that were not mentioned in the basic cable tier are now moved over to digital cable.\n\nA further example of this is in Toledo, Ohio; a mere 45 miles from a major market (Detroit), and close to a second major market (Cleveland), most of Detroit's signals penetrate deep into the Toledo market, and thus are carried on Buckeye CableSystem. This is similar in situation to Baltimore (which is close to Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.) and Topeka (which is within range of Kansas City's television stations).\n\nA significantly viewed, redundant affiliate may be invaluable to a cable television company in a carriage dispute if it has the same network but different local owners.\n\nAn example of controversy over residents losing a long-time out-of-market affiliate stations happened in Lumberton, North Carolina. For decades, the city has been reliant for NBC coverage from WECT out of Wilmington, North Carolina. Lumberton has been in and out of different DMAs between the Raleigh, Wilmington, and Florence-Myrtle Beach markets. It is currently in the Florence-Myrtle Beach market since the late 1990s. Parts of the market over-the-air or on cable received a different NBC affiliate, whether it was WIS (Columbia, South Carolina), WECT (Wilmington), WCNC (Charlotte), or WCBD (Charleston, South Carolina).\n\nThe Florence-Myrtle Beach market received its own NBC affiliate in August 2008, when Raycom Media built and signed on WMBF. On the day WMBF launched, cable providers were required to drop sister stations WECT and WIS from cable systems in the market. Lumberton residents who subscribed to Time Warner Cable protested the move and pushed to get WECT back on the cable channel lineup; by coincidence, WMBF, WECT and WIS are all owned by Raycom, thus the removal would in effect promote WMBF within the home market over its out-of-market sister stations. This was also in addition to the fact that WMBF's over-the-air signal does not even reach the North Carolina side of the Florence-Myrtle Beach market. On December 1, 2008, WECT returned to Time Warner Cable's Lumberton service area on a digital cable tier.\n\n\n"}

It was released on August 10, 2010 for iOS devices and on January 6, 2011 for OS X (via the Mac App Store).\n\nTwo game modes are available for play in the game: a level-by-level campaign, titled \"The Rise and Fall of Frank Solway\", and an endless mode, titled \"Endless Nightfall\".\n\nThe basic gameplay involves random objects falling from the sky, as the player tries to avoid getting hit. Control is by means of tilting the device to move left or right and tapping on the touchscreen to jump. As the game progresses, the pile of objects gets taller, and less stable. At random intervals, diamonds will fall that grant the player an extra life if collected; each level has a certain number of diamonds and the amount collected is recorded on the stage select screen. As well as falling diamonds, balloons arise from below the pile, carrying power-ups, such as coins (ten coins gives the player an extra life), a protective helmet that shields the player from damage for a limited time, an extra health unit (which cannot be replenished once lost), an item that scrolls the screen up or down, or a skull that damages the player (referred to as an \"Ancient Curse\"). If the player finds himself stuck in the middle of the pile, he can attempt to shake the device to form a bubble and float back to the top. However, this is an unreliable feature.\n\n\"The Rise and Fall of Frank Solway\" contains 7 levels, in which the player is required to climb 130 meters for the first five stages and 100 meters for the final two. To aid in this, several checkpoints are present throughout each level. Once a checkpoint is crossed, the player can restart from that position if he dies, with one replenished health unit.\n\nDeath can occur by the player being pushed off-screen by the pile or losing all health units. Items that kill the player are recorded in a museum and shown by name on the death screen (e.g. \"Death by Taxi\").\n\nFrank Solway, an average Joe, is having an ordinary day. As he tries to hail a cab, he notices that the streets are eerily empty. He then notices something above him — which turns out to be a cab falling from the sky. He dodges it, only to find more objects of all descriptions raining down on him: sofas, houseplants, vending machines, pianos. Frank keeps dodging the falling debris and climbs the ever-growing pile. Gradually he rises above the city, past the nearby mountains, and into the sky, eventually leaving earth's orbit and reaching outer space, where he hopes to discover the source of the falling objects.\n\nFrank eventually floats into a white void with what appears to be a portal in the middle. A slightly older Frank approaches from the other side. It is revealed that the older Frank also attempted to hail a cab, but instead it was sucked into the air, followed by other objects from his world; the portal drew objects from one world and deposited them in the other. Finally the two Franks touch the portal together, causing a bright light to fall on Frank's town, saving his world.\n\nAfter the game is cleared once, the player can play through it again in \"Beard Mode\", as the older Frank.\n\nSince its initial release, the game has had two major updates. The 1.2 update allows players to use their iPhone or iPod Touch as a controller, while using an iPad as a screen. The 1.3 update allows players to use a video cable with a suitable adapter attached to the iPad's dock connector to play the game on a television set or computer monitor, with the graphics reformatted to fit a HDTV screen.\n\n\"The Incident\" was met with mainly positive reviews. The iOS version holds an aggregate score of 82 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on sixteen reviews, and 85.71% on GameRankings, based on seven reviews.\n\nThe graphical style of the game, which was designed to emulate 8-bit games, has been widely praised. Kotaku called it \"attractively visually designed.\" TouchGen saw it as \"a visual homage to games of yesteryear.\" Boing Boing's Brandon Broyer referred to it as \"a simple idea executed with fantastic style.\" Gamezebo wrote \"the retro 8-bit presentation absolutely sparkles.\"\n\nKotaku's editor Michael McWhertor was impressed with the overall game. He criticized the high difficulty near the end, but concluded that \"it was the game's more clever references that appealed to me more than its graphics. There are amusing nods to films like \"\" and \"Back to the Future\" and pop culture sources like \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" and \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\". \"The Incident\" tickles your geek side expertly.\" McWhertor later referred to the game as \"one of my favorite iPhone games of 2010\", stating \"I'm still surprisingly wowed by the option for wireless iPhone control.\"\n\nGamezebo's Jim Squires scored the game 8 out of 10, writing \"players looking for an accessible yet frantic arcade-style experience are going to really dig what \"The Incident\" has to offer [...] If you're looking for a new experience with old school arcade-style simplicity, \"The Incident\" is one item you'll want to catch.\" They also praised the music and sound design. IGN's Levi Buchanan rated the game 7.5 out of 10, writing \"\"The Incident\" is a prime example of how the best iPhone games are simple ideas, perfectly executed. The climb from the street to the stars is terrifically fun and addictive.\" TouchGen's Nigel Wood scored it 4.5 out of 5, writing \"\"The Incident\" is an incredibly cool game, delivering addictive arcade platforming wrapped in classic packaging. It's a budget beauty!\"\n\nPocket Gamer's Tracy Erickson scored the game 7 out of 10, arguing that it was enjoyable in the short term only; \"\"The Incident\" is entertaining for a few short minutes, yet its one-dimensional gameplay limits the long-lasting fun [...] An amusing game of evasion, \"The Incident\" holds little in the way of lasting appeal.\" Cole Jones of 1UP rated it B+, feeling the gameplay became somewhat repetitive; \"if you try to play for a couple hours straight, its repetitive nature starts to shine through. You'll enjoy this clever platformer, but only in short spurts.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "3300078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3300078", "title": "Tumba francesa", "text": "Tumba francesa\n\nTumba francesa is a secular Afro-Cuban genre of dance, song, and drumming that emerged in Oriente, Cuba. It was introduced by slaves from Haiti—then a French colony known as Saint-Domingue—whose owners resettled in Cuba's eastern regions following the slave rebellion during the 1790s. The genre flourished in the late 19th century with the establishment of \"sociedades de tumba francesa\" (tumba francesa societies), of which only three survive.\n\nTumba francesa combines musical traditions of West African, Bantu, French and Spanish origin. Cuban ethnomusicologists agree that the word \"tumba\" derives from the Bantu and Mandinka words for drum. In Cuba, the word tumba is used to denote the drums, the ensembles and the performance itself in tumba francesa.\n\nTumbas francesas are directed by a mistress of ceremonies called \"mayora de plaza\". Performances generally begin with improvised solo singing in a mixture of Spanish and French patois termed \"kreyol cubano\" or \"patuá cubano\" by the lead vocalist (\"composé\"). After the introduction, the catá (a wooden cylindrical idiophone struck with two sticks) is played, and the \"composé\" alternates call and response singing with a group of female vocalists (\"tumberas\"). After the catá establishes the beat, the three tumbas are played. The tumbas are single-headed hand drums; from largest to smallest they are called premier (or manma), bulá and segón. The premier is now commonly called quinto, as it fulfills the same lead, improvisatory role as the quinto does among the conga drums in Cuban rumba. In the toque masón, a double-headed bass drum called tamborita (or simply tambora) establishes the rhythm together with the catá. In addition, a shaker called chachá or maruga is commonly played by the \"tumberas\" and the \"mayora\" throughout the performance. The structure of tumba francesa is related to an eastern type of Cuban rumba called tahona.\n\nThere are three main \"toques\", or types of tumba performance, each associated with a specific dance.\n\n\nAn additional toque called \"cinta\" is only performed in Santiago de Cuba. It is called so because the performance takes place around a tree trunk with coloured bands (\"cintas\"), which are red, white and blue.\n\nThe dance in tumba francesa is similar to Haitian affranchi, which involves a series of straight-backed, held-torso, French style figures followed by African improvisation on the final set, but tumba francesa is danced to drums instead of string and woodwind instruments. The clothes of the dancers are colorful and flamboyant.\n\nTumbas francesas can be traced back to the late 18th century when the Haitian Revolution triggered the migration of French colonists from Saint-Domingue, bringing their slaves to the Oriente Province of Cuba. By the late 19th century, following the abolition of slavery in 1886, tumba francesa societies became established in this region, especially in Santiago de Cuba and Guantánamo. Their establishment was in many ways similar to the old African \"cabildos\". Performers identify tumba francesa as \"French-Haitian\", acknowledging it as a product of Haiti which now resides in Cuba. By the second half of the 20th century, tumbas francesas were still performed in eastern Cuba, especially the toque masón. Other toques however are only played in the context cultural associations. Three tumba francesa societies survive at the moment: La Caridad de Oriente (originally La Fayette) in Santiago de Cuba; Bejuco in Sagua de Tánamo, Holguín; and Santa Catalina de Riccis (originally La Pompadour) in Guantánamo.\n\nUnlike other Afro-Cuban genres, tumba francesa remains poorly documented in terms of recordings. The 1976 LP \"Antología de la música afrocubana VII\", produced by Danilo Orozco and released by Areito, presents a variety of yubá and masón toques.\n\n\n"}

Tycho Brahe (1546–1601) was a Danish astronomer, astrologer, and alchemist and as such achieved some acclaim in popular folklore as a sage and magician.\n\nThe idea that certain calendar dates are lucky or unlucky is of ancient origin, going back as far as the Mesopotamian civilizations. Tables that identify lucky and unlucky days are sometimes known by the German label of \"Tagwählerei\". The Coligny calendar also identifies certain calendar dates as lucky or unlucky, and the Roman \"fasti\" marks many days and parts of others as \"dies nefasti\", unsuited for the conduct of public business. Contemporary North America preserves a tradition that Friday the 13th is an unlucky day. It has been called a \"pervasive form of divination\" that \"is found in all societies which regulate their days and nights in calendric systems.\"\n\nThe received idea concerning the origin of Tycho Brahe days was that \"Tycho Brahe, the celebrated Danish astronomer of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, was very superstitious, considering certain days in the year pregnant with misfortune, wherefore in Denmark, up to this very day, the laboring class call such days on which they happen to meet with some unfortunate accident, Tycho Brahe's days.\" In his travelogue \"A Poet's Bazaar\", Hans Christian Andersen alludes to the fact that Tycho Brahe died in exile in Prague, observing that \"Denmark owns not even his dust; but the Danes mention his name in their bad times, as if a denunciation proceeded out of it: 'These are Tycho Brahe's days!' say\nthey.\"\n\nHowever, no mention of the Tycho Brahe days is actually found in the work of Tycho Brahe. They nevertheless are often referenced in almanacs and recur in Scandinavian folklore. In the Cyprianus tradition, Tycho Brahe days are considered unlucky for magical work; several of the spells in the \"Black Books of Elverum\" note that they should not be carried out on a Tycho Brahe day.\n\nThese days were supposed to be unlucky to perform tasks such as getting married, starting a journey, or to fall ill on. Some versions claim that Tycho Brahe also identified several days as particularly lucky:\nSome lists omit certain days, or add others; there is no standard list. One should also note that Denmark was on the Julian calendar until 1700, when it switched to the Gregorian calendar.\n\nMedieval calendars often contained lists of \"dies Ægyptiaci\", \"Egyptian days\", that also were held to be unlucky. The Egyptian days were:\nThese too were days considered unlucky to begin any enterprise. Physicians were especially discouraged from performing bloodletting on the Egyptian days.\n\n"}

The market is overtaking the market in movies and music in the country.\n\nWhilst the American market for video games has declined, it is increasing in South Africa.\n\nSouth Africa boasts Expos, relatively big LAN's and a growing community of gamer's. South Africa's biggest LAN event called the NAG LAN of the former magazine company moved to Cape Town in 2016 which had an impressive turnout. Another LAN event was held in Cape Town which was only slightly smaller than the NAG LAN with 400 people. Although the gaming community in Cape Town is big, the uncontested giant in South African gaming is Johannesburg, with Gauteng in its entirety housing more gamer's than the rest of the country.\n\nPlans are also laid out by SuperSport to start an eSport channel with GINX eSports TV as the demand for streaming eSports keeps on growing.\n\nThanks to big tech companies like MWEB and Telkom whom host local server game servers which improve gaming allot in South Africa. This helps local competitive gaming to improve and bringing the local gaming community together.\n\nOne problem that South Africa is undertaking is the struggle to get protection from the government for Game Developers. There is a \"ball-passing\" going on at the different departments. The Dep. of Trade, Arts and Culture and Sports are still discussing which one will take the authority of handling the rights of game developers.\n\nSouth Africa's video gaming compared to the rest of Africa is unchallenged due to the large number of wealthy South Africans living in cities like Durban, Cape Town, Pretoria, Bloemfontein and Johannesburg. With internet infrastructure being more than sufficient to support the sport. With Fibre being almost fully integrated in cities and wealthy suburban areas the growth in online gaming can only be motivated. Video game developing in the country is not doing well, but events and eSports organizations like Mind Sports South Africa, the Digital Gaming League, Orena and LANX have jumped up in 2015 with the big demand for eSports tournaments and other gaming events in large cities. However, it is only Mind Sports South Africa that continually holds events in all the provinces and runs school events. With gaming in schools also in the rise, Mind Sports South Africa reports that there are now over 30 schools that participate in the official league, with school teams competing on an equal footing with many of the best private clubs in the country.\n\nNigeria, Kenya and Uganda are the other top game developers in Africa. The gaming industry is bringing millions of dollars in for their countries per year. This is in all categories of gaming: mobile, PC, Xbox, and PS. Because it was not the culture of the African people, the people are slowly growing into the gaming entertainment.\n\nSouth Africa also being dominant in sport in the continent and all over the world, and the country too has made its mark on the eSport scene as the national South African team has participated in every International e-Sports Federation world Championship since 2009 over a varied number of games and platforms. But Mind Sports South Africa has admitted that the gaming scene needs to mature.\n\nFurther proof that South Africa is highly respected is that Thomas Brown was selected to referee at the 2016 World Cyber Arena (WCA) in Beijing, and that on 31 July 2016 Jason Batzofin was elected onto International e-Sports Federation Athletes' Commission.\n"}

The company was founded in 1991 as a merger between Lion Rampant and \"White Wolf Magazine\" (est. 1986 in Rocky Face, GA; it later became \"White Wolf Inphobia\"), and was initially led by Mark Rein·Hagen of the former and Steve Wieck and Stewart Wieck of the latter. Since White Wolf Publishing, Inc. merged with CCP Games in 2006, White Wolf Publishing has been an imprint of CCP hf, but has ceased in-house production of any material, instead licensing their properties to other publishers. It was announced in October 2015 that White Wolf had been acquired from CCP by Paradox Interactive. The name \"White Wolf\" originates from Michael Moorcock's works.\n\nWhite Wolf published a line of several different but overlapping games set in the \"World of Darkness\", a \"modern gothic\" world that, while seemingly similar to the real world, is home to supernatural terrors, ancient conspiracies, and several approaching apocalypses. The company also published the high fantasy \"Exalted\" RPG, the modern mythic \"Scion\", and d20 system material under their Sword & Sorcery imprint, including such titles as the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" gothic horror campaign setting \"Ravenloft\", and Monte Cook's \"Arcana Unearthed\" series. In order to complement the \"World of Darkness\" game line, a LARP system dubbed \"Mind's Eye Theatre\" has been published.\n\nWhite Wolf also released several series of novels based on the Old World of Darkness, all of which are currently out of print (although many are coming back into availability via print-on-demand).\n\nWhite Wolf also ventured in the collectible card game market with \"Arcadia\", \"Rage\", and \"\" (formerly \"Jyhad\"). \"V:TES\", perhaps the most successful card game, was originally published by Wizards of the Coast in 1994, but was abandoned just two years later after a revamped base set, name change and three expansions were published. White Wolf acquired the rights to the game in 2000, even though no new material had been produced for the game in over four years. Since then, several \"V:TES\" expansions have been released, and the game was the only official source of material for the Old World of Darkness, until 2011 when the 20th Anniversary Edition of \"\" was published and the Onyx Path was announced.\n\nVideo games such as \"\" and \"\" are based on White Wolf's role-playing game \"\". There are also several .\n\nOn Saturday, 11 November 2006, White Wolf and CCP Games, the Icelandic MMO development company responsible for EVE Online, announced a merger between the two companies during the keynote address at the EVE Online Fanfest 2006. It was also revealed that a World of Darkness MMORPG was already in the planning stages. This game was cancelled in April 2014 after nine years of development.\n\nAt GenCon 2012 it was announced that CCP Games/White Wolf would not continue to produce table-top RPGs . Onyx Path Publishing, a new company by White Wolf Creative Director Richard Thomas, purchased the Trinity games and Scion from CCP and became licensee for the production of World of Darkness titles (classic and new), as well as Exalted. Onyx Path does not, however, hold a license to the Mind's Eye Theatre titles.\n\nOn Thursday, 29 October 2015, Paradox Interactive and CCP announced that Paradox had purchased White Wolf and all of its intellectual properties. Tobias Sjögren will serve as the CEO of the revived company, which will remain a subsidiary of Paradox. Martin Ericsson, formerly a developer on the World of Darkness MMO, will be serving in the \"Lead Storyteller\" role for the company.\n\nThe games of this series use White Wolf's Storyteller System. Several games inspired spinoffs in the form of \"historical\" period settings such as the Dark Ages.\n\nIn addition to those game lines a series of books was produced under the title \"World of Darkness\". These provided stand-alone materials for multiple game lines with the focus on a specific region or theme, e.g. \"WoD: Blood dimmed Tides\" (about the oceans), \"WoD: Combat\" (an alternative 'crossover' combat system to resolve contradictory mechanics and add some sophistication), \"WoD: Tokyo\" and \"WoD: Mafia\".\n\nFor the Third Edition of \"Ars Magica\", White Wolf connected that game's pseudo-historical setting to the 'future' \"World of Darkness\" setting. This was a simple adjustment (since the core premise of both settings is 'Earth as we know it' + 'supernatural fiction is reality') and particularly suited to the 'Tremere connection' between a clan of vampires from the original \"Vampire\" and a House of magi in the \"Order of Hermes\" (the central organization of \"Ars Magica\" as well as one of the 'Traditions' in \")\".\n\nThe games of this series use White Wolf's newer Storytelling System. For over a decade it was also known as \"World of Darkness,\" causing it to be referred to as the \"new World of Darkness\" or nWoD to distinguish it from the prior line of games. In December 2015, it was renamed \"Chronicles of Darkness\" by its new publisher Onyx Path in order to more clearly distinguish the two given Paradox Entertainment's intention to reboot the original setting. \n\n\n\n\nThe majority of the Old World of Darkness games were adapted into the original Mind's Eye Theatre format for live-action roleplaying. Product lines in this era include:\n\nSubsequently, the Mind's Eye Theatre was revamped for the New World of Darkness. A core \"Mind's Eye Theatre\" rulebook was published as the LARP analogue to the \"World of Darkness\" core rulebook, with several Mind's Eye Theatre adaptations following in suit: \"The Requiem\", \"The Forsaken\", and \"The Awakening\" each adapted their respective namesakes to the new system of MET rules. The license to produce Mind's Eye Theatre content was acquired by By Night Studios in 2013.\n\nAt Midwinter Gaming Convention in 2013 it was announced that as a result of CCP Games discontinuation of publishing, By Night Studios had acquired the license to all Mind's Eye Theatre titles. In May 2013, By Night Studios launched a successful Kickstarter campaign to rebuild the Mind's Eye Theatre: Vampire The Masquerade product specifically for the Live-Action Role Play audience. By Night Studios is currently in development of Mind's Eye Theatre: Werewolf The Apocalypse in the same rebuilding fashion as Vampire The Masquerade.\n\nIn the 1990s, White Wolf also published fiction. This included novels and anthologies based on White Wolf's games, as well as general fantasy and horror fiction. White Wolf printed several Elric of Melniboné collections by Michael Moorcock. The company also put out general fiction collections by Harlan Ellison, as well as several paperback editions of the \"Borderlands\" anthologies edited by Thomas F. Monteleone.\n\nWhite Wolf has different imprints under which various books are published, most notably:\n\n\nBlack Dog Game Factory was also a fictional company in the World of Darkness, as detailed in the \"Subsidiaries: A Guide to Pentex\" game supplement.\n\n\n"}

From July 1854 to September 1855 he was concurrently director of the Théâtre Lyrique, and during his short tenure the artistic and social standing of the theatre rose, although he resigned, disappointed with the results at the theatre. Wagner described him around this time as \"a well-to-do bel esprit and painter\".\n\nHe became director of the Opéra de Paris in December 1862. During this time he employed Bizet to play through scores submitted to the Opéra, although Perrin did not assist the composer in getting his work performed there. Victorien Sardou in a letter described Perrin as \"the most volatile, the most capricious, the most changeable of men\". He was dismissed from the Opéra after being accused of insufficient patriotism in May 1870.\n\nIn 1875, he was brought in to arbitrate in a dispute between Bizet and the directors of the Opéra-Comique over the preparations for \"Carmen\", despite the fact that he loathed the piece.\n\nHe was administrator-general of the Comédie-Française from 1871 up to his death. In 1876 he became a member of the Académie des beaux-arts.\n"}
