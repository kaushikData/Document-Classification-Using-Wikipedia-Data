He is one of the earliest comic strip characters and he is regarded as the first recurring character in comics.\n\nRed-nosed and blustery, an archetypal lazy schemer often found \"sloping\" through alleys to avoid his landlord and other creditors, he was created for the British magazine \"Judy\" by writer and fledgling artist Charles H. Ross, and inked and later fully illustrated by his French wife Émilie de Tessier—a rare woman comic-strip artist at the time—under the pseudonym \"Marie Duval\" (or \"Marie Du Val\"; sources differ).\n\nThe strips, which used text narrative beneath unbordered panels, premiered in the 14 August 1867 issue of \"Judy\", a humour-magazine rival of the famous \"Punch\". The highly popular character was spun off into his own comic, \"Ally Sloper's Half Holiday\", in 1884.\n\nThe first illustrations were by Ross, then Tessier took over. When publisher Gilbert Dalziel re-launched the cartoon as \"Ally Sloper's Half Holiday\", in 1884, Sloper was illustrated by William Baxter until his death in 1888. He was succeeded by W. Fletcher Thomas, who continued the illustrations until approximately 1899, when the publisher invited C. H. Chapman to illustrate the series until it ended in 1916.\n\nThe highly popular character was spun off into his own comic, \"Ally Sloper's Half Holiday\" in 1884. Sloper appeared in three feature films and a wide array of merchandising from pocket watches to door stops. His popularity and influence led to his being used on occasion as a propaganda tool for the British government's policies. Sloper has also been cited as an influence on W. C. Fields and Charlie Chaplin's \"little tramp\" character and its imitators.\n\nThe arrival of the First World War in 1914 saw severe paper rationing, and in 1916 the \"Half Holiday\" comic ceased production. Attempts after the war to revive Sloper proved short-lived, as Sloper was a somewhat stereotypical Victorian and Edwardian type, and did not fit into the new post-war world.\n\n\n"}

However, his fine baritone voice – heard in church and in local concert appearances – convinced Collins' family to send him back to Philadelphia for formal training. After concluding his studies, Collins spent some 15 years touring with various stock companies and appearing in summer opera in St. Louis. None of these ventures turned out any long term prospects for Collins, and when he married actress and singer Anna Leah Connelly in 1895 Collins swore off show business and decided to study for a career in bookkeeping. Taking occasional roles for extra money, Collins appeared in a production given by the DeWolf Hopper Opera Company in 1898, and talent scouts for Edison Records requested Collins audition which, according to his wife, took place May 16, 1898.\n\nWithin a few years, Collins proved one of the most productive and successful singers in the record business, and in his long career between 1898 and 1926 he worked for every record company active in the United States. He specialized in what were then called coon songs, popular African-American dialect numbers associated with vaudeville and minstrel shows. Collins also utilized an array of vocal effects and caricature voices which gave the impression that there were multiple persons at the horn on his recordings, though it was just Collins. Towards making that end of it more effective, Collins began to work in a duo format with tenor Joe Natus in 1901 and both sang in an Edison group called the Big Four Quartet. It is assumed that Collins first came into contact with tenor Byron G. Harlan within the context of the Big Four Quartet, and from then until the end of Collins' career in the early 1920s, Harlan was Collins's duet partner. Collins & Harlan were probably the most famous and popular male duo on early records.\n\nIn 1909, Collins joined John H. Meyer, Henry Burr, and Albert Campbell in the Peerless Quartet, a successful barbershop music group which toured as the Record Makers, and later as the Eight Popular Victor Artists. However, by 1917 bass Frank Croxton began to replace Collins on some records, a situation that became permanent by mid-1919 as Collins did not get along with Burr, who also served as the group's manager.\n\nDuring a personal appearance at the Princess Theater in Medina, Ohio on October 20, 1921, Collins was badly injured when he fell through an open trap door. While he recovered well enough to resume his singing and recording career, his health began to decline afterward and in 1926, Collins retired, relocating to Florida with his wife. He died at the age of 69 in Tice, Florida on August 3, 1933.\n\nArthur Collins recorded hundreds of songs, and in many cases he recorded the same song multiple times for various recording outfits. His signature song was \"The Preacher and the Bear\", which he first recorded in 1905. His rendition, widely dispersed among a variety of releases, constitutes the most popular non-operatic record made during the first decade of the twentieth century. Collins was still recording the number in 1922, and a 1908 remake of the piece for Victor remained in their catalog until 1941; at his personal appearances \"The Preacher and the Bear\" was invariably requested. His recording sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc, only the second one ever presented. \n\nCollins lived up to his reputation as the \"King of Ragtime Singers\" and recorded more ragtime songs than any other singer during the era when ragtime was at its peak of popularity. Collins recorded some of Bert Williams's songs before Williams did, and even recorded some numbers associated with Williams that the latter never waxed. Collins and Harlan also made best-selling records of tunes old and new that remain well cherished and iconic even in the twenty-first century, such as \"Waiting for the Robert E. Lee\", \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\", \"Lily of the Valley\", and \"The Old Grey Mare\". Collins survived into the early years of the Jazz Age, and he and Harlan recorded the earliest record known to mention jazz, \"That Funny Jas Band from Dixieland\" (Victor 18235, recorded January 12, 1917).\n\nCollins' solo recordings as well as Collins and Harlan recordings are viewed as desirable by collectors, particularly the very early ones, and such enthusiasm about their output dates back to at least the 1940s. Given the age of these recordings and their highly specialized frame of interest, few of them were reissued in the LP era; Collins has fared better in the digital age, but still lacks a single disc anthology of his characteristic recorded work.\n\n1898\n\n1899\n\n1900\n\n1901\n\n1902\n\n1903\n\n1904\n\n1905\n\n1906\n\n1907\n\n1908\n\n1909\n\n1910\n\n1911\n\n1912\n\n1916\n\n1918\n\n1919\n\n1920\n\n† Indicates a recording that reached number one on sales charts.\n\n\n"}

The game is set to launch during the winter quarter of 2018.\nThe game is set to be a first-person shooter in the same vein as classic shooters that Romero and Carmack first formulated in their early game development years. The game is described as \"a return to fast, violent and masterful play on the PC.\" The game will also feature various multiplayer modes along with its single player campaign, including co-operative play, deathmatch, and more. The controls are described as \"fast, skillful movement with rocket jumping, strafe jumping and circle strafing,\" similar to the controls featured in a previous Id Software title, Quake.\nThe game takes place in an alternate world. HOXAR, a company that specializes in virtual and alternate reality technology, has created the \"HoloSims\", a device that simulates another world to its user. However, something has gone awry with the system, and its users are beginning to see their simulations being warped and changed with terrifying results.

Billing himself as \"The Great Ballantine\", \"The Amazing Ballantine\" or \"Ballantine: The World's Greatest Magician\", his vaudeville-style comedy routine involved transparent or incompetent stage magic tricks, which tended to flop and go \"hilariously awry\" to the wisecracking Ballantine's mock chagrin. He has been credited with creating comedy magic and has influenced both comics and magicians.\n\nBallantine was born Meyer Kessler in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Israel Kessler (1883-1930) and Rose Cohen (1890-1973), both Jewish immigrants from Borshchiv, Ukraine and Russian Poland (then part of the Austrian Empire and Second Polish Republic). Nicknamed the \"Jipper,\" he was inspired at age 9 by his barber who would do magic tricks with thimbles while cutting his hair. His first job was working as a printer. In the 1930s, Kessler was doing professional straight magic as \"Count Marakoff\", \"Carlton Sharpe\", and \"Carl Sharp\" in Chicago, helping support his family, and later moved to New York City, where he performed in night clubs and on television variety shows. In the early 1940s, he gave up \"real magic\" when he realized he could not be as good as some of his peers. According to his daughter, “one night, one of his tricks got screwed up, he said something to cover, and the audience laughed. So he started adding more.” \nHe switched to comedy magic and changed his name to \"Carl Ballantine\", after he noticed a bottle of Ballantine whisky in an advertisement and decided it sounded \"show-businessy and classy\", and called the magic act \"Ballantine, the World's Greatest Magician\". He entertained troops during World War Two. He was billed as \"The Amazing Mr. Ballantine\" when he played the New York Capitol in 1950, and \"The Great Ballantine\" in \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" and \"The Steve Allen Show\" on television in the 1950s and 1960s. He was the first magician to play Las Vegas, appearing on a bill with Harry James, Betty Grable and Sammy Davis Jr. at El Rancho Vegas in 1956.\nBallantine was cast in several movies including \"McHale's Navy\" (1964), \"Penelope\" (1966), \"Speedway\" (1968), \"The Shakiest Gun in the West\" (1968), \"The World's Greatest Lover\" (1977), \"Just You and Me, Kid\" (1979), Disney's \"The North Avenue Irregulars\" (1979) and Billy Crystal’s directorial debut, \"Mr. Saturday Night\" (1992), and in numerous television series, including the ABC sitcom \"McHale's Navy\" (1962–1966), in which he played Lester Gruber, one of the PT boat sailors known for his hucksterism and wild schemes. He was a supporting player on the show, working with star Ernest Borgnine, Joe Flynn and Tim Conway. An early television role cast him as Magician “Al Henderson”, working the 53rd precinct Christmas Party for brother-in-law Officer Toody in episode 15 of the 1st season of \"Car 54, Where Are You?\", first airing December 24, 1961. He also guest starred on \"The Partridge Family\", \"I Dream of Jeannie\" as a used car salesman, and on \"The Monkees\" episode called \"The Audition\" which aired on January 23, 1967. He appeared on \"CHiPs\" as magician \"The Great Marvello.\" The episode was entitled \"Rustling\" and aired January 28, 1978. In 1973 he appeared as Dr. Hankim in \"The Girl Most Likely to...\". His last feature film appearance was in \"Aimee Semple McPherson\", a 2006 biopic about the female evangelist.\nBallantine made his only appearance on Broadway as Lycus the slave merchant in the 1972 revival of \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" starring Phil Silvers. He was also a frequent panelist/judge on \"The Gong Show\", even appearing on the series finale of the NBC daytime version.\n\nIn later years he was a recurring voice artist on \"Garfield and Friends\", usually as Al J. Swindler, a purveyor of shoddy merchandise and goods.\n\nBallantine died on November 3, 2009 at age 92 at his home in Hollywood, California. His remains were cremated.\n\nBallantine's first marriage ended in divorce. In 1955 he married actress Ceil Cabot (born Celia Cabrera; March 8, 1927 – January 24, 2000), to whom he remained married until her death in 2000. Their two daughters, Saratoga, an actress, and Molly, an advertising sales executive, are both named after racetracks.\n\nHe won the Academy of Magical Arts' (AMA) \"Special Fellowship\" in 1973, \"Performing Fellowship\" in 1984, and the \"Louie\" Award from Tannen's Magic in 1985. In 2007, he received the 2006 \"Lifetime Achievement Fellowship\" from the Academy of Magical Arts. The award was presented by Steve Martin, who calls Ballantine \"the king of bungling magicians\" in his memoir \"Born Standing Up\", and said in an interview: \"Carl Ballantine influenced not only myself but a generation of magicians and comedians. His was also the most copied act by a host of amateurs and professionals.\" According to David Copperfield, \"Carl Ballantine created comedy magic. The combination of magic and comedy had perhaps been done before, but he truly defined it and made it his own.\"\n\n"}

It was released on June 6, 2006, to largely negative reviews. Though there was never an official announcement regarding discontinuation of service, the servers have been offline since 2008, ostensibly due to a lawsuit by VWORLD, LLC.\n\nSnail Games acquired the rights to \"Dark and Light\" in 2008 and developed a \"fantasy survival sandbox RPG\", which was released as early access in 2017 with the same name.\n\nDark and Light was a third-person Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG), set in a medieval fantasy world called Ganareth. Players could choose from 12 races, 10 of which could be either male or female (the exceptions being Half-Trolls, which were male only, and Fairies, which could only be female). There were 14 playable character classes to choose from, divided into four main archetypes: Fighter, Hunter, Healer, and Mage. Fighters were designed to have good defensive abilities and armour, and also had the ability to bring the focus enemies off of other characters and onto the fighter. They could be Warriors, Paladins, or Shadow Knights. Hunters were a support character, relying more on tactics and offensive support than on damage or defense. They could be Archers, Rangers, Bards, or Thieves. The primary purpose of Healers was to heal, as the name suggests, but they also had decent ranged damage capabilities. Healers could be Clerics, Monks, Druids, or Enchanters. Mages discarded personal safety in favour of large amounts of damage, in addition to buffing other players. Mages could be Illustionists, Necromancers, or Wizards.\n\nProgression in Dark and Light experience points gained in three separate systems, or \"axes\": Combat, Crafting, and Social. Combat experience was gained through defeating enemies, crafting from creating items, and social from joining guilds and doing guild quests.\n\nCharacters had 12 different equipment slots (head, shoulders, left and right arms, gloves, chest, shirt, belt, pants, left and right thighs, and boots) in addition to two weapon slots, allowing for one ranged weapon, one or two melee weapons, or a shield. Armour was divided into 6 types: robe, cloth, leather, reinforced leather, chain mail, and plate.\n\nCrafting was divided into \"jobs\", each specified by the items that that job could produce. Tanners made leather armour, tailors made cloth armour, armourers made chain and plate armour, blacksmiths made weapons, and jewelers made jewels, jewellery, and bracelets.\n\nThe world was split into Kingdoms. Each kingdom represented one of the Gods of the realm, who in turn were subordinate to Gothar: God of Gods.\n\nThe expansive game world was one of their larger selling points, offering 39,000 square kilometers (15,000 sq. mi.) of land to explore.\n\nDevelopment on \"Dark and Light\" started by NPCube in 2002. Later, under the \"pressure from its investors and from the gaming community\", it was released underdeveloped to retail and on the internet in 2006 after a prolonged beta testing. On August 14, 2006, the publisher, Farlan Entertainment, stated that the game was released prematurely and has experienced problems due to its early release.\n\nFarlan Entertainment signed with SnailGame Entertainment, the distributor in China, to provide additional help with the graphics. All of the current subscribers were given a free 3-month period to play the game.\n\nDark and Light received largely negative reviews. Common complaints were the prevalence of gameplay bugs, low quality graphics, and poor overall implementation. Many reviewers liked the expansiveness and detail of the game world. MMORPG.com gave the game a 4 out of 10, saying that it \"offers a degree of freedom that is rare in online games\" but \"the game in its current state is broken, full of bugs and does not have half of what was promised\". GameZone gave the game 5.3 out of 10, saying that \"innovative gameplay elements are not enough to save a game that is fraught with concept flaws, lag and bugs and unfinished elements.\" OnRPG stated that \"this game had potential (yes... HAD). The whole idea of a 15,000 square-mile world would be marvelous to behold and the possibilities are quite profound\" but was still disappointed by prevalence of gameplay and graphics bugs, as well as losing gold when the character died\n\nOn 27 April 2007 VWORLD, LLC brought a lawsuit against NPCube and Farlan Entertainment for \"software counterfeit, non-respect of the right to credit and paternity, unfair competition and parasitism.\" In September 2007, NPCube responded by suing VWORLD, on the grounds \"of unfair competition and damage to NPCube's reputation\", additionally claiming that instead of VWorldTerrain technology, they were using a technology called SCAPER, developed in-house by NPCube, and demanding €710,000 in damages.\n\nNPCube's lawsuit against VWORLD was dismissed on 13 March 2008. Additionally, NPCube was found to be using VWorldTerrain technology, not SCAPER, and was liable for €50,000 in damages to VWORLD.\n\n"}
{"id": "189586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=189586", "title": "Fart lighting", "text": "Fart lighting\n\nFart lighting, also known as pyroflatulence or flatus ignition, is the practice of igniting the gases produced by human flatulence, often producing a flame of a blue hue, hence the act being known colloquially as a \"blue angel\", \"blue dart\", or in Australia, a \"blue flame\". The fact that flatus is flammable, and the actual combustion of it through this practice, gives rise to much humorous derivation. Other colors of flame such as orange and yellow are possible with the color dependent on the mixture of gases formed in the colon. In order to \"fire fart\", one must have a fart prepared in the anal cavity, and a lighter at the ready. Then they fart onto the lighter.\n\nIn 1999 author Jim Dawson observed that fart lighting has been a novelty practice primarily among young men or college students for decades, but is discouraged for its potential for causing injury. Such experiments typically occur on camping trips and in single-sex group residences, such as tree-houses, dormitories, or fraternity houses. With the advent of video sharing features online, hundreds of self-produced videos, both documentary as well as spoof, have been posted to sites such as YouTube. The people appearing in the videos are predominantly young males. In his book \"The Curse of the Self: Self-Awareness, Egotism, and the Quality of Human Life\" author Mark Richard Leary explains how a great deal of unhappiness is due to people's inability to exert control over their thoughts and behavior and that \"stupid stunts\", including lighting flatulence, were a way to make an impression and be included in group bonding or hazing.\n\nAlthough there is little scientific discourse on the combustive properties of flatus, there are many anecdotal accounts of flatus ignition and the activity has increasingly found its way into popular culture with references in comic routines, movies, and television; including cartoons. In \"Electric Don Quixote: The Definitive Story of Frank Zappa\" author Neil Slaven quotes Frank Zappa for calling fart lighting \"The manly art of fart-burning\", and another book quotes the musician Kenny Williams for saying that it demonstrates \"compression, ignition, combustion and exhaust.\"\n\nThere have been documented cases of flatulence during surgery being inadvertently ignited causing patient injury and the risk of death.\n\nThe composition of flatus varies dramatically among individuals. Flatulence produces a mixture of gases with the following six as major components:\n\nMethane burns in oxygen forming water and carbon dioxide often producing a blue hue (ΔH = −891 kJ/mol), as:\n\nHydrogen sulfide also combusts (ΔH = −519 kJ/mol) to\n\nThe odor associated with flatus is due to hydrogen sulfide, skatole, indole, volatile amines and short-chain fatty acids. These substances are detectable by olfactory neurons in concentrations as low as 10 parts per billion, hydrogen sulfide being the most detectable.\n\nSome of the gases are produced by bacteria which live in symbiosis within the large intestines of humans and other mammals. The gases are created as a by-product of the bacteria's digestion of food into relatively simpler substances. The oxygen and nitrogen component of flatus can be accounted for by aerophagy, while the CO component results from the reaction of stomach acids (HCl) with pancreatic bile (NaHCO).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3172113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3172113", "title": "George Washington Dixon", "text": "George Washington Dixon\n\nGeorge Washington Dixon (1801? – March 2, 1861) was an American singer, stage actor, and newspaper editor. He rose to prominence as a blackface performer (possibly the first American to do so) after performing \"Coal Black Rose\", \"Zip Coon\", and similar songs. He later turned to a career in journalism, during which he earned the enmity of members of the upper class for his frequent allegations against them.\n\nAt age 15, Dixon joined the circus, where he quickly established himself as a singer. In 1829, he began performing \"Coal Black Rose\" in blackface; this and similar songs would propel him to stardom. In contrast to his contemporary Thomas D. Rice, Dixon was primarily a singer rather than a dancer. He was by all accounts a gifted vocalist, and much of his material was quite challenging. \"Zip Coon\" became his trademark song.\n\nBy 1835, Dixon considered journalism to be his primary vocation. His first major paper was \"Dixon's Daily Review\", which he published from Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1835. He followed this in 1836 with \"Dixon's Saturday Night Express\", published in Boston. By this point, he had taken to using his paper to expose what he considered the misdeeds of the upper classes. These stories earned him many enemies, and Dixon was taken to court on several occasions. His most successful paper was the \"Polyanthos\", which he began publishing in 1838 from New York City. Under its masthead, he challenged some of his greatest adversaries, including Thomas S. Hamblin, Reverend Francis L. Hawks, and Madame Restell. After a brief foray into hypnotism, \"pedestrianism\" (long-distance walking), and other pursuits, he retired to New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nDetails about Dixon's childhood are scarce. The record suggests that he was born in Richmond, Virginia, probably in 1801. His parents were working-class folk, perhaps a barber and a washerwoman. He may have been educated at a charity school. Fairly detailed descriptions and portraits of Dixon survive; he had a swarthy complexion and a \"splendid head of hair\". However, the question of whether he was white or black is an open one. His enemies sometimes called him a \"mulatto\", a \"Negro\", or referred to him as \"Zip Coon\", the name of the black character in one of his songs. However, the weight of evidence suggests that if Dixon did have black ancestry, it was fairly remote.\n\nA newspaper story from 1841 claims that at age 15, Dixon's singing caught the attention of a circus proprietor named West. The man convinced Dixon to join his traveling circus as a stablehand and errand boy. Dixon traveled with this and other circuses for a time, and he appears as a singer and reciter of poems on bills dated from as early as February 1824. By early 1829, he had taken on the epithet \"The American Buffo Singer\".\n\nOver three days in late July 1829, Dixon performed \"Coal Black Rose\" in blackface at the Bowery, Chatham Garden, and Park theatres in New York City. The \"Flash\" characterized his audience as \"crowded galleries and scantily filled boxes\"; that is, mostly working-class. On September 24 at the Bowery, Dixon performed \"Love in a Cloud\", a dramatic interpretation of the events described in \"Coal Black Rose\" and possibly the first blackface farce. These performances proved a hit, and Dixon rose to celebrity, perhaps before any other American blackface performer had done so. On December 14, Dixon's benefit at the Albany Theatre grossed $155.87, the largest take there since the opening night earlier that year.\nDixon performed through 1834, most frequently at New York's three major theatres. In addition to blackface song-and-dance numbers, he did whiteface songs and scenes from popular plays; much of his material was quite challenging. Dixon's fame allowed him to pepper his material with satire and political commentary. On November 25, 1830, he sang before a crowd of 120,000 in Washington, D.C., in support of the July Revolution in France. He began selling a collection of songs and skits he had popularized called \"Dixon's Oddities\" in 1830; the book remained in print long after. Dixon mostly played to a working-class audience, including in his repertoire such songs as \"The New York Fireman\", which compared firefighters to the American Founding Fathers. Oratory made up another facet of his act; on December 4, 1832, the \"Baltimore Patriot\" reported that Dixon would read an address from the President at the Front Street Theatre.\n\nIn 1833, he started a small newspaper called the Stonington \"Cannon\". However, the publication saw little success, and by January 1834, he was performing again, now with new talents, such as ventriloquism. Dixon seemed untarnished by his yearlong hiatus. Reviews said that \"his voice seems formed of the music itself—\" 'it thrills\", it animates' ...\" The \"Telegraph\" wrote, \n\nFew Melodists have gained more celebrity or been so universally admired, ... The many effusions from the pen of this gentleman independent of his vocal powers, is sufficient proof of his being a man of considerable talent and originality—you should hear him sing his national air \"on a wing that beamed in glory\" [and it would be] unnecessary for us to enlarge on his merits as a vocalist—for his Melodies display a feeling of Patriotism which attracts the attention of every beholder.\n\nIn March, Dixon performed \"Zip Coon\" for the first time. Although Dixon had previously sung \"Long Tail Blue\", another racist tale about a black \"dandy\" trying to fit into Northern white society, \"Zip Coon\" garnered acclaim and quickly became an audience favorite and Dixon's trademark tune. He later claimed to have written the song, although others performed it before him, so this seems unlikely. Dixon accompanied his singing with an earthy jig.\n\nOn July 7, the Farren Riots erupted. Young men in New York City targeted the homes, businesses, churches, and institutions of black New Yorkers and abolitionists. On the night of July 9, the mob stormed the Bowery Theatre. Manager Thomas S. Hamblin failed to quell them, and actor Edwin Forrest did not meet their expectations when they ordered him to perform. According to the \"New York Sun\": \n\nMr. Dixon, the singer (an American,) now made his appearance. \"Let us have Zip Coon,\" exclaimed a thousand voices. The singer gave them their favorite song, amidst peals of laughter,—and his Honor the Mayor, who as the old woman said of her husband, is a \"good-natured, easy fellow,\" made his appearance, delivered a short speech, made a low bow, and went out. Dixon, who had produced such amazing good nature with \"Zip Coon,\" next addressed them—and they soon quietly dispersed.\n\nIn early 1835, Dixon moved to Lowell, Massachusetts, a small town growing out of the Industrial Revolution. By April, he had taken the epithet \"The National Melodist\" and was editing \"Dixon's Daily Review\". The paper took as motto \"Knowledge—Liberty—Utility—Representation—Responsibility\" and championed the Whig Party, Radical Republicanism, and the working class. \"Dixon's Daily Review\" also explored morality and women's place in the rapidly changing society of the urban North.\n\nDixon's criticism of his colleagues did not win him any friends, and in June, the \"Boston Post\" reported that he had \"flogged one of the editors of the \"Lowell Castigator\", and was hunting after the other.\" By the next month, Dixon had sold his paper, and the new publishers were eager to point out that Dixon no longer had anything to do with its production. By August, rumors were circulating that Dixon had started up another paper called the \"News Letter\" and was selling it in Lowell and Boston. If he did, no copies are known to have survived.\n\nBy February 1836, Dixon was touring again. He played many well-attended shows in Boston that month and did a play at the Tremont Theatre. His recent forays into publishing had soured his image in the popular press, however, and \"The New York Times\" satirized his lower-class audience: \n\n\"Tremont Teatre.\" At this classical establishment, Mr Dixon, \"the American Buffo singer,\" is at present the star. His \"third\" night is announced! Will some of the enlightened citizens of the emporium favor us with their opinion of his performance? Is his Zip Coon as thrilling as Mr Wood's \"Still so gently o'er me stealing?\"\n\nOn 16 and April 30, Dixon played the Masonic Temple in Boston. There he included material to appeal to his lower-class audience, such as a popular tune that he had adapted with lyrics about the Boston Fire Department. Nevertheless, he also reached out to a richer, middle-class patronage. For example, he played alongside a classically trained pianist, and he billed the performance as a \"concert\", a word typically reserved for high-class, non-blackface entertainment. Dixon earned a third of the gross from this engagement: $23.50. He still owed money to the printer of \"Dixon's Daily Review\", so these earnings were put in trust for the conductor of the orchestra to pick up at a later date. Dixon and the printer grew impatient and presented a forged note to the trustee to collect early. Within a few days, Dixon was arrested and jailed in Boston. The press took the opportunity to castigate him again: \"\"George Washington Dixon\", now cormorant of Boston jail, and ex-publisher, ex-editor, ex-broker, ex-melodist, &c., is quite out of tune.\" The \"Boston Courier\" called Dixon \"the most miserable apology for a vocalist that ever bored the public ear.\"\n\nAt the trial, held in mid-June, character witnesses testified that Dixon was \"a harmless, inoffensive man, but destitute of business capacity\" and \"in reply to the question whether Dixon was \"non compos mentis,\" I consider him as being on the frontier line—sometimes on one side, and sometimes on the other, just as the breeze of fortune happens to blow.\" In the end, he was found not guilty when the prosecution failed to satisfy that he had known the document to be a forgery. Dixon took the opportunity to give a speech to the public outside. He then returned to the stage, earning a considerable $527.50 in late July.\n\nDixon was still guilty in the eyes of the press, however, and his letters to clear his name only made things worse:\n\nMister Zip Coon is at his old tricks again. So far from possessing the ability to write a letter Miss Nancy-Coal-Black-Rose Dixon cannot begin to write ten consecutive words of the English language, and he must have encountered \"the Schoolmaster abroad\" in the Athenian city that teaches \"penmanship in six lessons,\" and that lately too if he can sign his name.\n\nBy the end of 1836, Dixon had moved to Boston and started a new paper, the \"Bostonian; or, Dixon's Saturday Night Express\". The paper focused on working-class issues, religious values, and opposition to abortion. It followed the lead of the \"Daily Review\" in exposing allegedly immoral affairs of well known Bostonians. One story told of two personalities eloping. Other Boston papers called the story false, and the \"Boston Herald\" labeled Dixon a \"knave\". Dixon fired back, depicting the paper's editor, Henry F. Harrington, as a monkey.\n\nIn early 1837, Dixon was again in legal trouble. Harrington accused Dixon of stealing half a ream of paper from the \"Morning Post\", the principal competition to Harrington's \"Herald\". The judge eventually dismissed the case, agreeing that the paper had been taken, but ruling that no proof pointed to Dixon as the one who had taken it. Dixon gave another post-trial speech, followed by a stage show on February 4.\n\nNot ten days after the end of the Harrington case, Dixon was charged with forging a signature on a bail bond pertaining to his previous debt from July 1835. He was sent to Lowell and jailed. The press responded with its usual glee: \"George has been a great eulogist, the defender of the Constitution! But he cannot defend himself.\" At his hearing on February 15, bail was set at $1000, an unheard of amount for the time. Unable to pay, he was transferred to a jail in Concord, Massachusetts.\n\nDixon's March 16 trial ended in conviction. His appeal to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court on April 17 resulted in a hung jury, and his prosecutors dropped the charges against him. He gave another of his by now trademark post-trial addresses. The \"Boston Post\" wrote: \"I begin to think that the Melodist bears a charmed life—and as was often said to be done in olden time, has made a bargain with the Being of Darkness for a certain term of years, during which he may defy the majesty of the law, and the wrath of his enemies.\"\n\nAnother stage tour followed, with concerts in Lowell, New England, and Maine. This was an apparent success, with one reviewer saying that Dixon had \"a voice which \"all\" unite in pronouncing to be of remarkable richness and compass.\" That Fall, he may have contemplated a tour with James Salisbury, a black musician and dancer well known in lower-class districts of Boston such as Ann Street. Instead, he appeared on December 6 at the upper-class Opera Saloon, singing selections from popular operas. His fame (or notoriety) served to get him listed as a candidate for the Boston mayoral race in December. Dixon won nine votes, despite his polite refusal to serve should he be elected.\n\nDixon performed in Boston through the end of February 1838. That spring, he moved to New York City, where he re-entered the publishing business with a newspaper called the \"Polyanthos and Fire Department Album\". Dixon again championed the lower class and aimed to expose the sordid affairs of the rich, especially those who preyed upon lower-class women.\n\nAn early \"Polyanthos\" alleged that Thomas Hamblin, manager of the Bowery Theatre, was engaging in an affair with Miss Missouri, a teen-aged performer there. Within ten days of publication, Miss Missouri turned up dead, reportedly killed by \"inflammation of the brain caused by the violent misconduct of Miss Missouri's mother and the publication of an abusive article in \"The Polyanthos\".\" On July 28, Hamblin accosted Dixon. Another assault in August prompted Dixon to start carrying a pistol. Undaunted, Dixon continued his attacks on Hamblin and others in the \"Polyanthos\". He exposed another alleged affair, this between a merchant named Rowland R. Minturn and the wife of a shipmaker named James H. Roome. Twelve days after the publication, Roome killed himself.\n\nAnother article alleged that Francis L. Hawks, an Episcopalian rector and reverend at the St. Thomas Church of New York, had been engaging in illicit sexual behavior. On December 31, Dixon was in court, charged with libel. Dixon spent a week in jail, then paid the $2000 bail. However, before he could even leave the jailhouse, he was arrested for a charge leveled by Rowland Minturn's brothers that Dixon's article had resulted in the man's death.\n\nBail was raised to $9000, an enormous amount, which Dixon protested. The prosecution argued that \"The accused is a \"criminal of the blackest dye\", and by his infamous publication is morally guilty of no less than three murders, and I hope the court will not diminish the amount of bail one iota!\" It did not. Nevertheless, a notorious New York madam named Adeline Miller paid it, and Dixon walked free. Only a month later, though, she had sent Dixon back to jail for unknown reasons. Facing seven counts (four from Hawks and three from the Minturns), the singer and editor remained incarcerated for two months while he awaited trial.\n\nThe Minturn case came first, on April 15, 1839. After three days, the jury came back unable to reach a verdict, and the Minturn brothers dropped the charges. Dixon returned to jail, but Hawks dropped his charges from four to three. The judge lowered bail to $900 on April 20, and Dixon walked free.\n\nThe press renewed their attacks on him: \n\nTo those who know the true character, and something of the personal history of this imbecile vagrant, the exuberance of indignation with which he is pursued, appears truly ridiculous. That he is disgusting, a nuisance, and a bore, we know—and so is a spider. Nobody would dream, however, of extinguishing the latter insect with a park of artillery; though all the city seem to have fancied that George Washington Dixon could be conquered with no less. The truth of him is, that he is a most unmitigated fool; and as to his pursuing any person with malice, he is not capable of any sentiment requiring the appreciation of real or fancied injury. If he were kicked down stairs, he could not decide, until told by some one else, whether the kick was the result of accident or design, and if design, whether it was intended as a compliment or an insult.\n\nDixon fought back in the \"Polyanthos\" by defending himself and his motives, and to some degree, he seems to have succeeded. The \"Herald\" for one admitted that his trial had exposed an unsavory facet of the upper class. Nevertheless, on May 10, Dixon changed his plea to guilty regarding one count, and the next day did the same for the other two. He was sentenced to six months of hard labor at the New York State Penitentiary at Blackwell's Island. Dixon reportedly responded, \"This is a pretty situation for an editor.\" He would later claim that Hawks had paid him $1000 to change his plea.\nThe press reacted with its usual fervor: \n\nDixon is a mulatto, and was, not many years ago, employed in this city, in an oyster house to open oysters and empty the shells into the carts before they were carried away. He is an impudent scoundrel, aspires to every thing, and was fit to be any body's fool. Somebody used his name (such as he called himself, for negroes have, by right, no surnames) as the publisher of a newspaper, in which every body, almost, was libelled. He is now caged, and, we may hope, will, when he comes out of prison, go to opening oysters, or some other employment appropriate to his habits and color.\n\nDixon served out his sentence then returned to New York. He resumed the \"Polyanthos\", emerging as the leader of a cadre of like-minded editors interested in exposing immorality. Dixon now focused his efforts on Austrian dancer Fanny Elssler, whom he accused of sexual misconduct. On August 21, 1840, he went so far as to rally a riot against her and then published the inciting speech in the \"Polyanthos\". He then targeted men who seduced young, working-class women, boarders who cheated their landlords, dysfunctional banks, and so-called British agents who were supposedly stirring up anti-American sentiment among American Indians and black slaves. Dixon claimed to be \"a battering-ram against vice and folly in every shape\", writing: \n\n\"The Polyanthos\" cannot die. The protecting Providence that watches over the safety of the just, and defeats the machinations of the wicked, will make it bloom ... We prophesy that the latest descendant of the youngest newsboy will animate his hearers with the desire to emulate the enviable fame of DIXON! Our name will be handed down to the end of time as one of the most independent men of the nineteenth century! Our \"very hat\" will become a relic.\nOn February 16, 1841, Dixon turned to a crusade against a New York abortionist known as Madame Restell. He vowed to reprint an anti-Restell editorial every week until the authorities took notice or Restell stopped running newspaper ads for her abortion services. As for abortion itself, Dixon claimed that it subverted marriage by inhibiting procreation and encouraged female infidelity.\n\nDixon kept his word, illustrating the editorial in later runs with woodcuts of Restell carrying a skull-and-crossbones emblem. When the March 17 \"New York Courier\" quoted the New York grand jury as saying \"We earnestly pray that if there is no law that will reach this [Madame Restell], which we present as a \"public nuisance\", the court will take measures for procuring the passage of such a law\", Dixon responded with the March 20 headline \"Restell caught at last!\" On March 22, Ann Lohman, part of the husband-and-wife team behind the Restell name, was arrested. Dixon claimed vindication and covered the trial over several issues of the \"Polyanthos\". After her conviction on July 20, he wrote, \"the monster in human shape ... has ... been convicted of one of the most hellish acts ever perpetrated in a Christian land!\"\n\nOn September 12, a man in the street struck Dixon in the head with an ax, which prompted some of the only positive press Dixon ever enjoyed that was not related to his singing. The \"Uncle Sam\" praised his editing and writing: \"Go on martyr of virtue, go on and prosper! Go on getting out extras, and defending the sacredness of the marriage institution. Go on through malice, opposition, fiery trials, persecutions and assassinations—posterity will do thee justice ... !\"\n\nEven with positive press, Dixon's troubles with the courts were not over. Around September 16, he allegedly assaulted Peter D. Formal, who was taking down bills that Dixon had posted. Dixon failed to appear for his October court date, and he skipped later dates on 1 and November 11. On November 19, he again was placed under arrest for obscenity as part of a citywide campaign by the district attorney to fight yellow journalism. On January 13, 1842, Dixon was indicted for the charges \"in absentia\". A warrant was issued for his arrest on April 13. By this time, he had handed the \"Polyanthos\" to Louse Leah, and the charges were eventually dropped.\n\nIn late 1841, Dixon had gotten into another row with a colleague. William Joseph Snelling obtained a warrant against him, and Dixon countersued. Snelling wrote anonymously in the \"Flash\": \n\nWe know him for a greedy, sordid, unscrupulous knave, of old; ... We are aware that men are judged by the company they keep and that we shall be blamed for having had anything to do with Dixon. Be it so.—We deserve rebuke, we have suffered for our folly and, if that is not enough, we are content to sit down in sackcloth and ashes; the meet attire of fools who trust to a person so vile that the English language cannot express his unmitigated baseness.\n\nIn keeping with sexual morality at the time, Dixon and his colleagues sometimes checked bordellos for cleanliness, friendliness, and other factors. Snelling drew from this, linking Dixon to organized prostitution and alleging that he had connections to a madam named Julia Brown. Eventually, another editor named George B. Wooldridge joined with Dixon for a few issues of the \"True Flash\", but they did not sell well. Rumors circulated at this time that Dixon was to be married, but sources disagreed over the identity of the fiancée; one said she was a Congressman's daughter, another that she was a madam. The \"Flash\" published a story that Julia Brown and a prostitute named Phoebe Doty had been seen fighting over the Melodist. If Dixon did marry, no record survives of it.\n\nBeginning in 1842, Dixon took on a number of new occupations, including animal magnetist and spiritualist specializing in clairvoyance. A fad for public competitions and feats of endurance served as another vehicle for him to keep his name in the public eye; he became a \"pedestrian\", a long-distance sport walker. The participation of Dixon, a blackface singer and dancer, in these contests presaged the challenge dances of performers such as Master Juba and John Diamond in the next few years.\n\nIn February, he competed to win $40,00 by walking 48 hours without stopping. When the prize failed to materialize, Dixon charged admission to watch him. Later that month, Dixon tried to break this record by walking 50 hours. His publicity was, as usual, bad. \"Brother Jonathan\" gave this advice: \"walk in one direction all the time, from this part of the compass, till ocean fetches him up, and then see how far he can swim.\" He walked for 60 hours that summer in Richmond, then did in five hours and 35 minutes in Washington, D.C. Dixon tried many other feats of endurance. For example, in late August, he stood on a plank for three days and two nights with no sleep. In September, he paced for 76 hours on a 15-foot-long (five-meter) platform.\n\nMeanwhile, he did not give up his singing career. In early 1843, Dixon (now called \"Pedestrian and Melodist\") appeared at least once more at the Bowery Theatre, and he played on bills with Richard Pelham and Billy Whitlock. On January 29, he performed at a benefit for Dan Emmett. These concerts would be his last.\n\nDespite these excursions into athletics and entertainment, Dixon still considered himself an editor. He started a new paper called \"Dixon's Regulator\" by March, and he renewed his public crusade in New York. On February 22, 1846, he posted handbills around the city publicizing a meeting to protest further activities by Madame Restell. At the rally the next day, several hundred people listened to Dixon speak against the abortionist, calling for her neighbors to demand her eviction or else to take matters into their own hands. The crowd then walked to her residence three blocks away to shout threats but eventually dispersed. Restell responded with a letter to the \"New York Tribune\" and \"New York Herald\" alleging that Dixon was simply trying to extort money from her in return for an end to his agitation: \n\nAgain and again have I been applied to by his emissaries for money, and as often have they been refused; and, as a consequence, I have been vilified and abused without stint or measure, which, of course, I expected, and, of the two, would prefer to his praise.\n\nDuring the Mexican–American War, Dixon added some timely political references to \"Zip Coon\" and briefly returned to the public eye. Another crusade seems to have drawn Dixon away from New York in 1847. He was probably one of the first Radical Republicans to entrench himself as a filibuster in the Yucatán in a bid to annex more territory for the United States.\n\nDixon retired to New Orleans, Louisiana, sometime before 1848. A city directory gives his address as \"Literary Tent\", and his obituary in the \"Baton Rouge Daily Gazette and Comet\" states that the Poydras Market \"by night and day, was the home of this waif upon society ... The 'General' was not without friends who contributed an odd 'five' to him when too frail to move about.\" He came down with pulmonary tuberculosis sometime in mid-1860. On February 27, 1861, he checked into the New Orleans Charity Hospital, noting his occupation as \"editor\". Dixon died on March 2.\n\n"}

They formed a lifelong gay partnership and shared interests in music (forming one of the most important piano duos of the 20th century), travel, and cooking.\n\nIt has often been said that Gold and Fizdale revolutionized the art of performing as a two-piano duo. While this may be a subjective statement, it must objectively be stated that they did commission and première many of the most important works for this ensemble in the second half of the 20th century, including works by John Cage (\"A Book of Music\" (1944) which is one of Cage's earliest experiments in using the prepared Piano), Paul Bowles, Virgil Thomson, Ned Rorem and many other important American Composers.\n\nThey were fixtures in New York's artistic community, being friends with literary and cultural figures such as Truman Capote, James Schuyler, George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, among others.\n\nIn 1948, they were one of the wave of American artists, musicians and writers who took advantage of the first possibility since the end of World War II to freely travel in Europe. \"The Boys\", as they were called by their friends, arrived in Paris with a letter of introduction from Marcelle de Manziarly to Germaine Tailleferre of Les six who invited them to a lunch with Francis Poulenc and Georges Auric. This lunch ended with Auric and Tailleferre taking the score of Thomson's \"The Mother of Us All\", which Thomson had given as a gift, turning it upside down on the piano and having Poulenc singing all of the roles (including Susan B. Anthony) in nonsense English syllables which were supposedly an imitation of Gertrude Stein's Libretto while Tailleferre and Auric improvised a four-hands version of Thomson's score.\n\nAfter this memorable day, Tailleferre invited the couple to her home in Grasse to spend two months while she was writing her ballet \"Paris-Magie\" and her opera \"Il était Un Petit Navire\". She wrote two-piano versions of both works and gave them to the duo as a gift. These manuscripts were later donated to the Library of Congress after the death of Robert Fizdale. Tailleferre later dedicated two other works to Gold and Fizdale: her Toccata for Two Pianos and her Sonata for Two Pianos. Francis Poulenc also wrote his own Sonata for Two Pianos for \"the Boyz\" (as he called them), a commission which was paid by their mutual friend the American Soprano and arts patron Alice Swanson Esty, according to Poulenc's correspondence.\n\nThe duo also recorded a number of recordings featuring works by Les six, Vittorio Rieti, and other composers, as well as a series of Concerto recordings with Leonard Bernstein and The New York Philharmonic, including the Poulenc Concerto for Two Pianos, The Mozart Two Piano Concerto and Saint-Saëns's \"Carnival of the Animals\".\n\nBobby Fizdale was born Robert Fish, the son of John and Rose Fish of Chicago. Had a brother Walter.\n\nBoth Gold and Fizdale were of Russian Jewish descent.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Arthur Gold began to have problems with his hands which made it difficult for him to perform, so the duo began to write biographical works, including \"Misia: the Life of Misia Sert\" (William Morrow 1981), \"The Divine Sarah: a Biography of Sarah Bernhardt\" (Knopf 1991).\n\nThe duo also began writing food articles for \"Vogue\" magazine and began a television cooking show. In 1984 they published \"The Gold and Fizdale Cookbook\" (Random House 1984), which is dedicated to their friend George Balanchine, \"In whose kitchen we spent many happy hours...\"\n\nIn 1996, after the death of Fizdale, his estate donated the personal papers, recordings and other memorabilia to the Juilliard School, where they are kept in the school's Peter Jay Sharp Special Collections Room in the Juilliard Library Gold and Fizdale are buried alongside each other at Oakland Cemetery (Sag Harbor, NY).\n\n\n"}

Presents Cannon is a two-issue comic book series that represents one of the earliest independent comics. The first issue was self-published by prominent writer-artist Wally Wood in 1969, with a second issue published by CPL Gang Publications in 1976. \n\nThis comic-book series is unrelated to the organization HEROES, Inc. (\"Honor Every Responsible Officer's Eternal Sacrifice\"), a Washington, D.C. aid group for families of police and firefighters killed in the line of duty.\n\nWriter-artist Wally Wood, who by 1969 had had a critically admired two decades in comic books, self-published the first issue of his mature-audience comic \"Heroes, Inc. Presents Cannon\" that year, after having already self-published a similar anthology, \"witzend\". These comics, along with such titles by other publishers as \"Star Reach\" (1974), \"Big Apple Comix\" (1975), and \"American Splendor\" (1976), helped bridge the gap between the countercultural underground comics and traditional mainstream fare, providing genre stories for an adult audience. Like those other examples, it was a forerunner of the late-1970s rise of the modern graphic novel and the 1980s independent-comic publishing boom.\n\nCreated for the military readership Wood had cultivated with his \"Sally Forth\" feature in \"Military News\" and \"Overseas Weekly\", the first issue contained no U.S. Postal Service indicia. The only publishing information was on an editorial page that gave the office address as \"Armed Forces Dist., P.O. Box 23635, Pleasant Hill, Calif.\" Not targeted at children and carrying no Comics Code seal, it contained more action/combat violence and more revealing clothing on nubile young women than did mainstream comics, though it did not contain nudity or gore; most deaths occurred in silhouette, off-panel or indeterminately within battle scenes. The glossy cover promoted \"Amazing Adult Adventure\".\n\nIn October 2005, Heritage Auctions auctioned off a lot containing approximately 70,000 copies of the issue.\n\nThe 32-page, color comic book featured three stories with original characters. Priced at 15 cents when a typical comic book cost 12 cents, it bore no issue number. The cover was signed \"Wally Wood 1969\". The inside front cover bore a full-page ad for Mesa Hills home sites, P.O. Box 788m Santa Fe, New Mexico. A full-page ad following the first story advertised National Diamond Sales, 437 12th Street, Oakland, California. The following page contained two stacked, half-page public-service ads, one for the U.S.O., the other for U.S. Savings Bonds. A Military Diamond Sales ad after the second story gave the same address as the editorial office. Following the stories came a full-page ad for U.S. Diamond Sales, 1128 Broadway, Oakland, California. The inside back cover contained the text piece \"Salute to a Medal of Honor Winner\", with a black-and-white photo of U.S. Marine Corps Corporal Robert E. O'Malley. The back cover was yet another diamond-company ad, for Armed Forces Diamond Sales, 1126 Broadway, Oakland, California.\n\nThe 12-page \"Cannon\", written and inked by Wood, penciled by Steve Ditko and credited as \"Wally Wood 1969\" and \"Art by Ditko and Wood\", was an espionage adventure starring the titular C.I.A. agent, who has been brainwashed so deeply during capture by cold war Communists that, when recovered by the United States military, scientists \"go all the way\" and continue brainwashing him as a covert assassin for the U.S. He is assigned to rescue or assassinate Jean Voss, a nubile young member of an American anti-missile defense lab, who was kidnapped by Asian, presumably Red Chinese, Communists with a base on the Yucatán Peninsula.\n\n\"Cannon\" went on to be published in serial form, in the U.S. Army's \"Overseas Weekly\", starting in 1971.\n\n\"The Misfits\", a 10-page story written and penciled by Wood, inked by Ralph Reese and credited \"W. Wood and R. Reese\" and \"Copyright Wally Wood 1969\", follows Mystra, a nubile young artificial human with telepathic abilities; Shag, a boyish blue extraterrestrial stranded on Earth; and Glomb, a human infant mutated by American scientists into a gray, simpleminded giant created to explore the planet Jupiter. Captives of the government's \"Operation Misfit\", they escape, only to confront an albino alien invader.\nReflecting less-enlightened times, page two of \"The Misfits\" includes this dialog from English-speaking officials at the scene of a spaceship landing:\n\nThe five-page \"Dragonella\" credited \"Script by Ron Whyte and W. Wood\", with art by Wood, and noted \"Copyright Wally Wood 1969\", is a humorous adventure of a fairy-tale baby abandoned in the woods and raised into nubile young womanhood by kindly dragons \"of the ancient and noble family Isaurus\". Named Dragonella, she eventually ventures forth seeking a prince to marry, accompanied by her dragon \"brother\", St. George.\n\nBefore the final story is a letter-from-the-editor page, hand-lettered on a montage of Wood art and signed \"Sincerely, Wallace Wood\".\n\nPublished in 1976 by CPL Gang Publications—which published the fanzines \"CPL (Contemporary Pictorial Literature)\" and \"Charlton Bullseye\" before its various editors and artists, including Roger Slifer and Roger Stern, turned professional—this magazine-sized second issue carried a $2 cover price.\n\nIt contains an untitled, seven-page \"The Misfits\" story written and drawn by Wood; the superhero feature \"The Black Angel\", with the seven-page story \"Beware the Sirens” by co-writers Mike Vosburg and Roger Stern, drawn by Vosburg; and an untitled, 14-page \"Cannon\" story, written and inked by Wood and drawn by Ditko.\n\nIn addition, the inside front cover contained a full-page Wood illustration of the character Dynamo, from Tower Comics' \"T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents\"; a two-page centerspread illustration of the original character Kadavahr the Resurrected, by John Byrne, plus an additional page of Byrne art; and a back-cover illustration by Wood of the original character Animan.\n\nThe covers for both issues were colored by Marie Severin.\n\n"}

The term is used for works of fiction which combine the literary devices of metafiction with historical fiction. Works regarded as historiographic metafiction are also distinguished by frequent allusions to other artistic, historical and literary texts (i.e. intertextuality) in order to show the extent to which works of both literature and historiography are dependent on the history of discourse.\n\nThe term is closely associated with works of postmodern literature, usually novels. According to Hutcheon, in \"A Poetics of Postmodernism\", works of historiographic metafiction are \"those well-known and popular novels which are both intensely self-reflexive and yet paradoxically also lay claim to historical events and personages\". Works often described as examples of historiographical metafiction include: William Shakespeare's \"Pericles, Prince of Tyre\" (c.1608), John Fowles' \"The French Lieutenant's Woman\" (1969), E. L. Doctorow's \"Ragtime\" (1975), William Kennedy's \"Legs\" (1975), Salman Rushdie's \"Midnight's Children\" (1981), A. S. Byatt's \"Possession\" (1990), Michael Ondaatje's \"The English Patient\" (1992), Thomas Pynchon's \"Mason & Dixon\" (1997) and many others. By seeking to represent both \"actual historical events\" from World War Two while, at the same time, \"problematizing\" the very notion of doing exactly that, Kurt Vonnegut's \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" (1969) features a metafictional, \"Janus-headed\" perspective.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43490987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43490987", "title": "Hobby horse polo", "text": "Hobby horse polo\n\nHobby horse polo () is a mixed team sport played on hobby horses. It is similar to other polo variants, such as canoe polo, cycle polo, camel polo, elephant polo, golfcart polo, Segway polo, auto polo, and yak polo, in that it uses parts of the polo rules, however it has its own specialities.\n\nHobby horse polo originated in 1998 as a mockery of \"polite society\" in Heidelberg-Neuenheim, which led in 2002 to the foundation of the First Kurfürstlich-Kurpfälzisch Polo-Club in Mannheim. It has since become a trendy sport with various teams in German cities and gained some notoriety in the press.\n\nPlaying polo with hobby horses has been described as a children's game in classical polo regions. Hugh van Skyhawk, an Indologist and professor of Islamic studies in Mainz and Islamabad, described hobby horse polo played by young boys as part of the ceremonies of the traditional Gindni (harvest preparations) festival in Hispar.\n\nIn 2013 the Grütlihüüler Guggenmusik from Allenwinden (Baar, Switzerland) organized the first Steckenpferdpolo on Swiss soil.\n\nThe objective is to score goals against an opposing team. The goals are traditionally marked by bar stools in width and height, but simple street hockey goals can also be used. Players score by driving a small soft baseball into the opposing team's goal using a long-handled croquet mallet. A full match takes six 6-minute-long \"chukkas\" (periods) and each team may consist of six persons (depending of the size of the field and amount of interest). The minimum size of the field is long and wide. A 'last man' rule applies, as any player may act as goalkeeper. As players need some protection against possible injuries, cleated shoes and shin guards are recommended. The mallets should be stable and are often taped to reduce the risk of losing the hammer head. It is preferred to hit the ball, but not other players.\n\nEach game starts with the teams in line behind their own goals and the ball in the midfield. On the umpire's command \"Polo go\", the teams gallop against each other, in one hand their mallets, in the other their hobby horses, which have to be led between the legs of the player. It is not allowed to kick or stop the ball by foot.\n\nFouls or failures to gallop or to listen to the umpires are treated by a \"punitive sherry\" (variously vodka, Brottrunk or Jägermeister based on the taste of the umpire) which has to be drunk on the spot. The German rules allow for hobbling under the influence, but require, quoting a Monty Python walking gag, \"It has to look particularly silly\".\n\nSwiss rules for ball in and out of play and the use of free kicks and time-outs are closer to association football and do not involve punitive sherries; instead free hits or penalties are applied for fouls. As the Swiss cavalry tradition keepers from Kavallerieverein Zug had been involved in the first tournament, riding boots are permitted but spurs are explicitly forbidden as well as the production of \"road apples\" on the field by either horse or rider. However, Swiss teams must confirm goals by neighing.\n\nAt the hobby horse polo tournaments in Düsseldorf, the victory cup \"is not a cup, but a cheesecake\", an homage to the traditional victor's quaffing from a milk bottle at the Indianapolis 500.\n\n"}

In the 20th century, the modernist and postmodern movements in turn discarded the romantic idea of creativity, and heightened the practice of imitation, copying, plagiarism, rewriting, appropriation and so on as the central artistic device.\n\n"}

He was recognized for his work, and is also known for having the longest running membership in the International Brotherhood of Magicians.\n\nBooth was born in Los Alamitos, California in 1912. His interest in magic began at age 10 with a magic set, and began performing semi-professionally at age 15. In 1928, Booth joined the International Brotherhood of Magicians and began publishing a serial column on magic history called \"Memoirs of a Magician's Ghost\" in their publication, The Linking Ring.\n\nIn 1934, Booth completed his college education at McMaster University and focused on magic performance as his profession. He began doing performances in high schools, but eventually was able to perform for nightclubs and hotel shows. Around this time, Booth began to write his first two books, \"Forging Ahead in Magic\" and \"Marvels of Mystery\", which had later become classic reference works for magicians.\n\nLater, Booth stopped doing show performances and left to become an ordained Unitarian Universalist minister in 1942. From personal accounts, Booth reported that he had been interested in becoming a minister, but was reluctant to begin seminary due to concerns about his own temperament. He said, \"Finally, in 1940, my misgivings evaporated. I closed a two week engagement as a magician in the Schroeder Hotel in Milwaukee (now the Hilton) and went directly to the Meadville Theological School now located in Chicago, the seminary of my father 30 years earlier.\" He spent over 30 years as a minister in the Universalist Unitarian Church.\n\nIn 1986, Booth published the book \"Psychic Paradoxes\". The book debunked the tricks of fraudulent mediums and psychics and was published by Prometheus Books.\n\nAfterwards, Booth incorporated magic topics into personal lectures and produced historical documentaries on magic, and retired at the age of 88. Booth died at age 97 in 2009.\n\nBooth is noted to be experienced as a nightclub magician who performed at premier hotels and venues, but his enduring contributions to magic were as a magic historian, as he documented magic performance through his own travels and experiences. He was purported to be one of the first to create documentaries for presentations and lectures on magic. One such account was about finding a genuine performance of the Indian rope trick, where he attempted to find a performer by paying for newspaper advertisements, but was ultimately unsuccessful at finding a true performance.\n\n\nIn 1937, early in his career, Booth was given the Sphinx Award in category of \"Professional Magician\" from the magazine \"The Sphinx\". The award was given for his notable \"Can You Tie It?\" effect submitted to and published in an earlier issue of the magazine, and noted its novelty and the subtlety of its methodology. Booth was awarded with the \"John Nevil Maskelyne Prize\" by The Magic Circle in 1987 for his literary contributions to magic performance.

Invented in 1974, over forty million units have been sold to date worldwide, under several brands, product names and variations.\nThe key element of the toy is the magnetophoretic display panel, filled with a thick, opaque white liquid containing tiny dark magnetic particles. These particles can be drawn to the drawing surface by a magnet-tipped stylus or optionally-provided shapes, or removed to the hidden back side by a sliding eraser bar. The middle layer is divided into a honeycomb of cells, keeping the liquid static and the particles evenly distributed across the panel. The liquid is formulated so that the floating particles can be pulled through it in response to the magnetic forces, but not due to gravity.\n\nThe toy was originally produced as \"Magna Doodle\" by Tyco until 1997, when Tyco was purchased by Mattel. Mattel then sold the toy under its Fisher-Price brand. The brand was later sold to the Ohio Art Company. Today, the \"Magna Doodle\" brand is owned by Cra-Z-Art. Fisher-Price have produced their own alternative called the Doodle Pro, while Ohio Art produced the similar Doodle Sketch until 2016 when it sold the brand to Spin Master.

{"id": "167816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=167816", "title": "Motion Picture Production Code", "text": "Motion Picture Production Code\n\nThe Motion Picture Production Code was the set of industry moral guidelines that was applied to most United States motion pictures released by major studios from 1930 to 1968. It is also popularly known as the Hays Code, after Will H. Hays, who was the president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) from 1922 to 1945. Under Hays' leadership, the MPPDA, later known as the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), adopted the Production Code in 1930, and began rigidly enforcing it in mid-1934. The Production Code spelled out what was acceptable and what was unacceptable content for motion pictures produced for a public audience in the United States.\n\nFrom 1934 to 1954, the code was closely identified with Joseph Breen, the administrator appointed by Hays to enforce the code in Hollywood. The film industry followed the guidelines set by the code well into the late 1950s, but during this time, the code began to weaken due to the combined impact of television, influence from foreign films, controversial directors (such as Otto Preminger) pushing boundaries, and intervention from the courts, including the Supreme Court. In 1968, after several years of minimal enforcement, the Production Code was replaced by the MPAA film rating system.\n\nIn 1922, after several risqué films and a series of off-screen scandals involving Hollywood stars, the studios enlisted Presbyterian elder Will H. Hays to rehabilitate Hollywood's image. Hollywood in the 1920s was badgered by a number of widespread scandals, such as the murder of William Desmond Taylor and alleged rape of Virginia Rappe by popular movie star Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle, which brought widespread condemnation from religious, civic, and political organizations. Many felt the movie industry had always been morally questionable. Political pressure was increasing, with legislators in 37 states introducing almost one hundred movie censorship bills in 1921. Faced with the prospect of having to comply with hundreds, and potentially thousands, of inconsistent and easily changed decency laws in order to show their movies, the studios chose self-regulation as the preferable option. Hays was paid the then-lavish sum of $100,000 a year (equal to $ today). Hays, Postmaster General under Warren G. Harding and former head of the Republican National Committee, served for 25 years as president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA), where he \"defended the industry from attacks, recited soothing \"nostrums\", and negotiated treaties to cease hostilities\".\n\nThe move mimicked the decision Major League Baseball had made in hiring judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis as League Commissioner the previous year to quell questions about the integrity of baseball in the wake of the 1919 World Series gambling scandal; \"The New York Times\" even called Hays the \"screen Landis\". In 1924, Hays introduced a set of recommendations dubbed \"The Formula\", which the studios were advised to heed, and asked filmmakers to describe to his office the plots of pictures they were planning on making. The Supreme Court had already decided unanimously in 1915 in \"Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio\" that free speech did not extend to motion pictures, and while there had been token attempts to clean up the movies before—such as when the studios formed the National Association of the Motion Picture Industry (NAMPI) in 1916—little had come of the efforts.\n\nNew York became the first state to take advantage of the Supreme Court's decision by instituting a censorship board in 1921. Virginia followed suit the following year, with eight individual states having a board by the advent of sound film, but many of these were ineffectual. By the 1920s, the New York stage — a frequent source of subsequent screen material — had topless shows, performances filled with curse words, mature subject matters, and sexually suggestive dialogue. Early in the sound system conversion process, it became apparent that what might be acceptable in New York would not be so in Kansas. Moviemakers were looking at the possibility that many states and cities would adopt their own codes of censorship, requiring a multiplicity of versions of movies made for national distribution. Self-censorship seemed a preferable outcome.\n\nIn 1927, Hays suggested to studio executives that they form a committee to discuss film censorship. Irving G. Thalberg of Metro Goldwyn Mayer, Sol Wurtzel of Fox, and E. H. Allen of Paramount responded by collaborating on a list they called the \"Don'ts and Be Carefuls\", which was based on items that were challenged by local censor boards. This list consisted of eleven subjects best avoided and twenty-six to be handled very carefully. The list was approved by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and Hays created the Studio Relations Committee (SRC) to oversee its implementation; however, there was still no way to enforce tenets. The controversy surrounding film standards came to a head in 1929.\n\nThe Code enumerated a number of key points known as the \"Don'ts\" and \"Be Carefuls\":\n\nIn 1929, a Catholic layman, Martin Quigley (editor of the prominent trade paper \"Motion Picture Herald\") and the Jesuit priest Father Daniel A. Lord created a code of standards and submitted it to the studios. Lord was particularly concerned with the effects of sound film on children, whom he considered especially susceptible to their allure.\n\nIn February 1930, several studio heads — including Irving Thalberg of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) — met with Lord and Quigley. After some revisions, they agreed to the stipulations of the Code. One of the main motivating factors in adopting the Code was to avoid direct government intervention. It was the responsibility of the SRC (headed by Colonel Jason S. Joy, a former American Red Cross Executive Secretary) to supervise film production and advise the studios when changes or cuts were required. On March 31, the MPPDA agreed it would abide by the Code.The production code was intended to put a limitation on films which were distributed to a large audience, making it more difficult to appeal to all individuals in the audiences.\n\nThe code was divided into two parts. The first was a set of \"general principles\" which prohibited a picture from \"lowering the moral standards of those who see it\", so as not to wrongly influence a specific audience of views including, women, children, lower-class, and those of “susceptible” minds, called for depictions of the \"correct standards of life\", and lastly forbade a picture to show any sort of ridicule towards a law or \"creating sympathy for its violation\". The second part was a set of \"particular applications\", which was an exacting list of items that could not be depicted. Some restrictions, such as the ban on homosexuality or on the use of specific curse words, were never directly mentioned, but were assumed to be understood without clear demarcation. Homosexuals being included under the forbiddance of sex perversion. Depiction of miscegenation (i. e., marital or sexual relations between different races) was forbidden. It also stated that the notion of an \"adults-only policy\" would be a dubious, ineffective strategy that would be difficult to enforce; however, it did allow that \"maturer minds may easily understand and accept without harm subject matter in plots which does younger people positive harm\". If children were supervised and the events implied elliptically, the code allowed \"the possibility of a cinematically inspired thought crime\".\n\nThe code sought not only to determine what could be portrayed on screen, but also to promote traditional values. Sexual relations outside marriage—which were forbidden to be portrayed as attractive or beautiful—were to be presented in a way that would not arouse passion or make them seem permissible. Any act considered sex perversion, including any suggestion of same sex relationships, sex, or romance. All criminal action had to be punished, and neither the crime nor the criminal could elicit sympathy from the audience, or the audience must at least be aware that such behavior is wrong, usually through \"compensating moral value\". Authority figures had to be treated with respect, and the clergy could not be portrayed as comic characters or villains. Under some circumstances, politicians, police officers, and judges could be villains, as long as it was clear that those individuals portrayed as villains were the exceptions to the rule.\n\nThe entire document was written with Catholic undertones, and stated that art must be handled carefully because it could be \"morally evil in its effects\", and because its \"deep moral significance\" was unquestionable. It was initially decided to keep the Catholic influence on the Code secret. A recurring theme was \"that throughout, the audience feels sure that evil is wrong, and good is right\". The Code also contained an addendum commonly referred to as the Advertising Code, which regulated advertising copy and imagery.\n\nOn February 19, 1930, \"Variety\" published the entire content of the Code and predicted that state film censorship boards would soon become obsolete; however, the men obliged to enforce the code—Jason Joy (head of the Committee until 1932) and his successor, Dr. James Wingate—were generally unenthusiastic and/or ineffective. The first film the office reviewed, \"The Blue Angel\", which was passed by Joy with no revisions, was considered indecent by a California censor. Although there were several instances where Joy negotiated cuts from films and there were definite—albeit loose—constraints, a significant amount of lurid material made it to the screen. Joy had to review 500 films a year with a small staff and little power. He was more willing to work with the studios, and his creative writing skills led to his hiring at Fox. On the other hand, Wingate struggled to keep up with the flood of scripts coming in, to the point where Warner Bros.' head of production Darryl Zanuck wrote him a letter imploring him to pick up the pace. In 1930, the Hays office did not have the authority to order studios to remove material from a film, and instead worked by reasoning and sometimes pleading with them. Complicating matters, the appeals process ultimately put the responsibility for making the final decision in the hands of the studios.\n\nOne factor in ignoring the code was the fact that some found such censorship prudish, due to the libertine social attitudes of the 1920s and early 1930s. This was a period in which the Victorian era was sometimes ridiculed as being naïve and backward. When the Code was announced, the liberal periodical \"The Nation\" attacked it. The publication stated that if crime were never to be presented in a sympathetic light, then taken literally that would mean that \"law\" and \"justice\" would become one and the same. Therefore, events such as the Boston Tea Party could not be portrayed. If clergy must always be presented in a positive way, then hypocrisy could not be dealt with either.\" The Outlook\" agreed, and, unlike \"Variety\", \"The Outlook\" predicted from the beginning that the Code would be difficult to enforce. The Great Depression of the 1930s led many studios to seek income by any way possible. Since films containing racy and violent content resulted in high ticket sales, it seemed reasonable to continue producing such films. Soon, the flouting of the code became an open secret. In 1931, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" mocked the code and quoted an anonymous screenwriter saying that \"the Hays moral code is not even a joke any more; it's just a memory\"; two years later \"Variety\" followed suit.\n\nOn June 13, 1934, an amendment to the Code was adopted which established the Production Code Administration (PCA) and required all films released on or after July 1, 1934, to obtain a certificate of approval before being released. The PCA had two offices - one in Hollywood, and the other in New York City. The first film to receive an MPPDA seal of approval was \"The World Moves On\" (1934). For more than thirty years, virtually all motion pictures produced in the United States adhered to the code. The Production Code was not created or enforced by federal, state, or city government; the Hollywood studios adopted the code in large part in the hopes of avoiding government censorship, preferring self-regulation to government regulation. The enforcement of the Production Code led to the dissolution of many local censorship boards.\n\nFather Daniel A. Lord, a Jesuit, wrote: \"Silent smut had been bad. Vocal smut cried to the censors for vengeance.\" Thomas Doherty, Professor of American studies at Brandeis University, has defined the code as \"... no mere list of Thou-Shalt-Nots, but a homily that sought to yoke Catholic doctrine to Hollywood formula. The guilty are punished, the virtuous rewarded, the authority of church and state is legitimate, and the bonds of matrimony are sacred.\" What resulted has been described as \"a Jewish owned business selling Catholic theology to Protestant America\".\n\nIn 1934, Joseph I. Breen — a prominent Catholic layman who had worked in public relations — was appointed head of the new Production Code Administration (PCA). Under Breen's leadership of the PCA, which lasted until his retirement in 1954, enforcement of the Production Code became rigid and notorious. (Even cartoon sex symbol Betty Boop had to change from being a flapper and began to wear an old-fashioned housewife's skirt.) Breen's power to change scripts and scenes angered many writers, directors, and Hollywood moguls. Breen influenced the production of \"Casablanca\", objecting to any explicit reference to Rick and Ilsa having slept together in Paris and to the film mentioning that Captain Renault extorted sexual favors from his supplicants; however, both remained strongly implied in the finished version. Adherence to the Code also ruled out any possibility of the film ending with Rick and Ilsa consummating their adulterous love, making inevitable the ending with Rick's noble renunciation, one of \"Casablanca\"s most famous scenes.\n\nThe first major instance of censorship under the Production Code involved the 1934 film \"Tarzan and His Mate\", in which brief nude scenes involving a body double for actress Maureen O'Sullivan were edited out of the master negative of the film. Another famous case of enforcement involved the 1943 western \"The Outlaw\", produced by Howard Hughes. \"The Outlaw\" was denied a certificate of approval and kept out of theaters for years, because the film's advertising focused particular attention on Jane Russell's breasts. Hughes eventually persuaded Breen that the breasts did not violate the code, and the film could be shown.\n\nThe PCA also engaged in political censorship. When Warner Bros. wanted to make a film about concentration camps in Nazi Germany, the production office forbade it—citing the above-mentioned prohibition on depicting \"in an unfavorable light\" another country's \"institutions [and] prominent people\"—with threats to take the matter to the federal government if the studio went ahead. This policy prevented a number of anti-Nazi films being produced. In 1938, the FBI unearthed and prosecuted a Nazi spy ring, subsequently allowing Warner to produce \"Confessions of a Nazi Spy\", with the Three Stooges' short subject \"You Nazty Spy!\" (January 1940) being the first Hollywood film of any sort to openly spoof the Third Reich's leadership.\n\nSome films produced outside the mainstream studio system flouted the code. One example is \"Child Bride\" (1938), which featured a nude scene involving a twelve-year-old child actress (Shirley Mills). The Code began to weaken in the late 1940s, when the formerly taboo subjects of rape and miscegenation were allowed in \"Johnny Belinda\" (1948) and \"Pinky\" (1949), respectively. In 1951, the MPAA revised the code to make it more rigid; the 1951 revisions spelled out more words and subjects that were prohibited. In 1954, Breen retired, largely due to ill health, and Geoffrey Shurlock was appointed as his successor. \"Variety\" noted \"a decided tendency towards a broader, more casual approach\" in the enforcement of the Code.\n\nHollywood continued to work within the confines of the Production Code throughout the 1950s, but during this time, the movie industry was faced with very serious competitive threats. The first threat came from a new technology, television, which did not require Americans to leave their house to watch moving pictures. Hollywood needed to offer the public something it could not get on television, which itself was under an even more restrictive censorship code. In addition to the threat of television, there was also increasing competition from foreign films, such as Vittorio De Sica's \"Bicycle Thieves\" (1948), the Swedish film \"One Summer of Happiness\" (1951), and Ingmar Bergman's \"Summer with Monika\" (1953). Vertical integration in the movie industry had been found to violate anti-trust laws, and studios had been forced to give up ownership of theaters by the Supreme Court in \"United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.\" (1948). The studios had no way to keep foreign films out, and foreign films were not bound by the Production Code. Some British films — \"Victim\" (1961), \"A Taste of Honey\" (1961), and \"The Leather Boys\" (1963) — challenged traditional gender roles, and openly confronted the prejudices against homosexuals, all in clear violation of the Hollywood Production Code. In keeping with the changes in society, sexual content that would have previously been banned by the Code was being retained.\n\nIn 1952, in the case of \"Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson\", the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously overruled its 1915 decision (\"Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio\") and held that motion pictures were entitled to First Amendment protection, so that the New York State Board of Regents could not ban \"The Miracle\", a short film that was one half of \"L'Amore\" (1948), an anthology film directed by Roberto Rossellini. Film distributor Joseph Burstyn released the film in the U.S. in 1950, and the case became known as the \"Miracle Decision\" due to its connection to Rossellini's film. That reduced the threat of government regulation, which had formerly been cited as justification for the Production Code, and the PCA's powers over the Hollywood industry were greatly reduced.\nBy the 1950s, American culture also began to change. A boycott by the National Legion of Decency no longer guaranteed a film's commercial failure, and several aspects of the code had slowly lost their taboo. In 1956, areas of the code were re-written to accept subjects such as miscegenation, adultery, and prostitution. For example, the re-make of a pre-Code film dealing with prostitution, \"Anna Christie\", was cancelled by MGM twice, in 1940 and in 1946, as the character of Anna was not allowed to be portrayed as a prostitute. By 1962, such subject matter was acceptable, and the original film was given a seal of approval.\n\nBy the late 1950s, increasingly explicit films began to appear, such as \"Anatomy of a Murder\" (1959), \"Suddenly Last Summer\" (1959), \"Psycho\" (1960), and \"The Dark at the Top of the Stairs\" (1961). The MPAA reluctantly granted the seal of approval for these films, although not until certain cuts were made. Due to its themes, Billy Wilder's \"Some Like It Hot\" (1959) was not granted a certificate of approval, but it still became a box office smash, and, as a result, it further weakened the authority of the Code.\n\nAt the forefront of contesting the Code was director Otto Preminger, whose films violated the Code repeatedly in the 1950s. His 1953 film \"The Moon Is Blue\", about a young woman who tries to play two suitors off against each other by claiming that she plans to keep her virginity until marriage, was released without a certificate of approval. He later made \"The Man with the Golden Arm\" (1955), which portrayed the prohibited subject of drug abuse, and \"Anatomy of a Murder\" (1959), which dealt with murder and rape. Like \"Some Like It Hot\", Preminger's films were direct assaults on the authority of the Production Code, and their success hastened its abandonment. In the early 1960s, films began to deal with adult subjects and sexual matters that had not been seen in Hollywood films since the early 1930s. The MPAA reluctantly granted the seal of approval for these films, although again not until certain cuts were made.\n\nIn 1964, the Holocaust film \"The Pawnbroker\", directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Rod Steiger, was initially rejected because of two scenes in which the actresses Linda Geiser and Thelma Oliver fully expose their breasts, as well as due to a sex scene between Oliver and Jaime Sánchez described as \"unacceptably sex suggestive and lustful\". Despite the rejection, the film's producers arranged for Allied Artists to release the film without the Production Code seal, with the New York censors licensing the film without the cuts demanded by Code administrators. The producers appealed the rejection to the Motion Picture Association of America. On a 6-3 vote, the MPAA granted the film an exception, conditional on \"reduction in the length of the scenes which the Production Code Administration found unapprovable\". The requested reductions of nudity were minimal; the outcome was viewed in the media as a victory for the film's producers.\n\n\"The Pawnbroker\" was the first film featuring bare breasts to receive Production Code approval. The exception to the code was granted as a \"special and unique case\" and was described by \"The New York Times\" at the time as \"an unprecedented move that will not, however, set a precedent\". In \"Pictures at a Revolution\", a 2008 study of films during that era, Mark Harris wrote that the MPAA approval was \"the first of a series of injuries to the Production Code that would prove fatal within three years\".\n\nIn 1966, Warner Bros. released \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\", the first film to feature the \"Suggested for Mature Audiences\" (SMA) label. When Jack Valenti became President of the MPAA in 1966, he was faced with censoring the film's explicit language. Valenti negotiated a compromise: the word \"screw\" was removed, but other language remained, including the phrase \"hump the hostess\". The film received Production Code approval despite the previously prohibited language.\n\nThat same year, the British-produced, American-financed film \"Blowup\" was denied Production Code approval. MGM released it anyway, the first instance of an MPAA member company distributing a film that did not have an approval certificate. That same year, the original and lengthy code was replaced by a list of eleven points. The points outlined that the boundaries of the new code would be current community standards and good taste. Any film containing content deemed suitable for older audiences would feature the label SMA in its advertising. With the creation of this new label, the MPAA unofficially began classifying films.\n\nBy the late 1960s, enforcement had become impossible and the Production Code was abandoned entirely. The MPAA began working on a rating system, under which film restrictions would lessen. The MPAA film rating system went into effect on November 1, 1968, with four ratings: \"G\" for general audiences, \"M\" for mature content, \"R\" for restricted (under 17 not admitted without an adult), and \"X\" for sexually explicit content. By the end of 1968, Geoffrey Shurlock stepped down from his post.\n\nIn 1969, the Swedish film \"I Am Curious (Yellow)\", directed by Vilgot Sjöman, was initially banned in the U.S. for its frank depiction of sexuality; however, this was overturned by the Supreme Court. In 1970, because of confusion over the meaning of \"mature audiences\", the \"M\" rating was changed to \"GP\", and then in 1972 to the current \"PG\", for \"parental guidance suggested\". In 1984, in response to public complaints regarding the severity of horror elements in PG-rated titles such as \"Gremlins\" and \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\", the \"PG-13\" rating was created as a middle tier between \"PG\" and \"R\". In 1990, the \"X\" rating was replaced by \"NC-17\" (under 17 not admitted), partly because of the stigma associated with the \"X\" rating, and partly because the \"X\" rating was not trademarked by the MPAA; pornographic bookstores and theaters were using their own \"X\", \"XX\", and \"XXX\" symbols to market products.\n\nDespite the name change from \"X\" to \"NC-17\", this highest rating is very rarely issued due to its ongoing stigma. As the American Humane Association's Hollywood office depended on the Hays Office for the right to monitor sets, the closure of the Hays Office in 1966 corresponded with an increase in animal cruelty on movie sets. According to a writer for Turner Classic Movies, the association's access did not return to Hays-era standards until 1980.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9024693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9024693", "title": "Nuevo Cine Mexicano", "text": "Nuevo Cine Mexicano\n\nNuevo Cine Mexicano, also referred to as New Mexican Cinema is a Mexican film movement started in the early 1990s. Filmmakers, critics, and scholars consider Nuevo Cine Mexicano a \"rebirth\" of Mexican cinema because of the production of higher-quality films. This rebirth led to high international praise as well as box-office success, unseen since the golden age of Mexican cinema of the 1930s to 1960s. The quality of Mexican films suffered in the decades following the golden age due in part to Mexican audiences watching more overseas films, especially Hollywood productions. This resulted in the rise of infamous Mexican genres such as Luchador films, \"sexicomedias\" and ultimately the low-budget direct-to-video Mexploitation film.\n\nMany themes addressed in Nuevo Cine Mexicano include the roles of gender, identity, tradition, and socio-political conflicts within Mexico itself. The movement has achieved international success with films such as director Alfonso Cuaron’s \"Y Tu Mamá También\" (2001), which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and at the Golden Globes for Best Foreign Film, and Alejandro G. Iñárritu's Amores Perros (2000), which was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards.\n\nThere is debate over when this “new wave” of Mexican cinema began and whether there are any clear parameters as to how it differs from other Mexican film movements other than \"newfound audience enthusiasm\". Some cite the actual rejuvenation of Mexican cinema as starting in 1998 in a Post-NAFTA Mexico, beginning with the film \"Sexo, pudor y lágrimas\" (Sex, Shame and Tears). Others believe it began because of the international acclaim of the films such as \"Like Water For Chocolate\" (1992) and its nomination for Best Foreign Film at the Golden Globes. The definition of Nuevo Cine Mexicano also leads to the question, \"What is a Mexican film?\"—is it Mexican film because of who makes or stars in it, or because it takes place in Mexico.\n\nThe Golden Age of Mexican Cinema occurred from the 1930s to the 1960s, afterward, a period of low-budget B-movies funded by the state of Mexico was the primary source for films for the Mexican public. A resurgence of Mexican cinema was believed to occur in the 1970s, however, its success was short-lived as the majority Mexican filmgoers preferred Hollywood films.\n\nBefore the 1990s, the Mexican film industry was primarily funded by the state in coordination with the Instituto Méxicano de Cinematografía (Mexican Film Institute of Cinematography), IMCINE. There was a decrease in Mexican audiences watching Mexican-produced films in favor of Hollywood blockbusters as well as \"film production dropp[ing] to an all-time low\" due to the economic crash in 1994. The IMCINE produced roughly five films a year during the crisis. The main influx of directors and filmmakers, as well as funding, primarily came from the IMCINE. The incoming filmmakers, nicknamed the \"1990s Generation\", were helped by the generation of 1968 with their filmmaking skills.\n\nOne of the most successful filmmakers of the 1990s Generation of Mexican filmmakers, Guillermo del Toro, said that \"In the 80’s there was a huge void in Mexican cinema, then my generation picked up the staff in the early 90s.\" However, during the 1970s \"technical experimentation\" took precedence within the film community, and through the 1980s films \"catered to the lowest common denominator\", the 1990s Generation learned by working together with the filmmakers of the late 60s and 70s.\n\nSocial divisions within Mexico is a reoccurring theme within Nuevo Cine Mexicano, including the films \"Y Tu Mamá También, El crimen del Padre Amaro\" (2002), and \"Amores Perros.\"\n\nThough the films touch on the “socio-geographic divisions” of Mexico in different ways. In \"Amores Perros\", the economic divisions are portrayed through the differences between the main characters' homes. El Chivo lives in a \"seedy residence\" which that is juxtaposed with his daughter’s \"respectable home\". With \"El crimen del padre Amaro\" (The Crime of father Amaro) the traditions of the Catholic Church, which remains a prominent influence in Mexico, is questioned when a young priest has sex with a teenager leading to her death from an abortion. Other subjects such as homosexuality and political corruption are briefly touched on in \"Y Tu Mamà También\" (And Your Mother Too), helping to set up a background of what Mexico is and is not. The two main male characters in the film differ in their social standings because of their families' political connections. What ultimately breaks their friendship apart is having sex with one another. Within Nuevo Cine Mexicano, filmmakers try to portray such social and economic troubles within Mexico through different perspectives, which commonly goes against the sometimes stereotypical portrayals of Mexico and its inhabitants in U.S. and European films.\n\nThe characterizations of Europeans or foreigners, specifically Spaniards, are relatively negative. In several works in Nuevo Cine Mexicano, the conflict within the story is due to a person of Spanish descent. Either the non-foreigners in the film who associate with the Spaniards are drastically changed or the Spaniards themselves meet a tragic end. The filmmakers use this trope in order to recall Mexico's past, specifically with Spain's colonization of Mexico. The style of the films generally mimics the \"art house\" films of previous decades, since the state of Mexico had the greatest authority over the production of movies. Directors specifically adopted this style in order to move away from the state and into independent productions, which a majority of Nuevo Cine Mexicano is. Production studios normally fund one to two million dollars per film, due to the lack of mainstream production. The influence of \"NAFTAtrade and tax policies\" made it harder for the public to fund such productions.\n\nGuillermo del Toro, Alfonso Cuaron, and Alejandro G. Inarritu make up the \"Three Amigos\", the main Mexican film directors of Nuevo Cine Mexicano. All have created films produced in Mexico and Hollywood. Critics and award shows consider these three as the premier directors in their craft. Each produces and uses actors and cinematographers from Mexico, even in their Hollywood made productions. \"Poster-boy\" actors Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna have also moved on to several Hollywood productions, yet their popularity in Mexican cinema has proven to endure throughout the years.\n\nSince 2000, some directors have made \"independent productions looking for more personal expression\", under a greater influence of European cinema. The most representative films of this trend are \"Japón\" and \"Batalla en el cielo\" (\"Battle in Heaven\"), both directed by Carlos Reygadas. Other films include: \"Mil nubes de paz cercan el cielo, amor, jamás acabarás de ser amor\" (\"A Thousand Clouds of Peace Fence the Sky, Love; Your Being Love Will Never End\") and \"El cielo dividido\" (\"Broken Sky\"), directed by Julián Hernández, and \"Sangre\", directed by Amat Escalante and produced by Jaime Romandía and Reygadas.\n\n"}

It was a part of the Norwegian system of municipally-owned cinemas, superseding private ownership in the field. Only the Conservative Party and the Liberal Left Party voted against municipalization. These parties subsequently attempted to privatize cinemas in the years after 1926, but failed. An important motivation for municipal ownership was the surplus from the budget, which could be used for other cultural budget posts. Oslo Concert Hall, Folketeatret, Gustav Vigeland's atelier (later the Vigeland Museum) and the Munch Museum received monetary support from the cinema fund.\n\nIn 1997 the company was turned into a joint stock company. Between 2001 and 2003 the city council of Oslo tried to orchestrate a sale of 66% of the company shares, but this did not happen. No bidder came close to the expected prize, and the sale thus fell through. The name was changed from Oslo Kinematografer to Oslo Kino in 2007.\n\nThe early directors were Jens Christian Gundersen (1926-1933) and Kristoffer Aamot (1934-1940). During the German occupation of Norway the company had three Nazi collaborators as directors: Gustav Berg-Jæger (1940-1942), Einar Schibbye (1942-1944) and Birger Ilseng (1944-1945). Kristoffer Aamot then recovered his job, and sat until 1955. Theodor Rosenquist followed (1955-1958), then Arnljot Engh (1958-1975), Eivind Hjelmtveit (1975-1993), Ingeborg Moræus Hanssen (1993-2005), Cecilie Trøan (acting, 2005-2006) and Geir Bergkastet (2006-present).\n\nPre-war chairs of the board of directors were Arthur Skjeldrup (1926-1928), Kristoffer Aamot (1929-1931), Eyvind Getz (1932-1934) and Rachel Grepp (1935-1940). The chairpersons during the German occupation of Norway are not known. After the war, Rolf Hofmo sat from 1946 to 1955, then Rolf Stranger (1956-1967), Albert Nordengen (1968-1971), Adele Lerche (1972-1975), Turid Dankertsen (1976-1979), Albert Nordengen again (1980-1983), Bjørn Bjørnseth (1984-1987), Jon Lyng (1988-1991), Christian Hambro (1992), Theo Koritzinsky (1993-1995), Jon Lyng again (1996-2003) and Heidi Larssen (2003-present). Several directors and chairs were also politicians for the Conservative Party, the party which initially opposed a municipal cinema company.\n"}
{"id": "28840234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28840234", "title": "Playdead", "text": "Playdead\n\nPlaydead ApS is a Danish independent video game developer based in Copenhagen. Game designers Arnt Jensen and Dino Patti created the company in 2006 to develop \"Limbo\", which released in 2010 to critical acclaim. After a year of Xbox 360 exclusivity, Playdead released ports of the game to PlayStation 3, Microsoft Windows, macOS, IOS and Android.\n\nDuring Xbox's E3 2014 conference, Playdead announced their second game, \"Inside\", which was a spiritual successor to \"Limbo\". It was released for Xbox One, Microsoft Windows, and PlayStation 4 in 2016 to critical acclaim, and was hailed as a worthy successor to \"Limbo\".\n\nArnt Jensen, a former IO Interactive developer, drew sketches in 2004 that led him to conceptualize \"Limbo\". Having tried programming himself, he eventually sought for additional help through an art-based teaser for the game in 2006. This led to a meeting between Jensen and Dino Patti. Patti soon realized the project was larger than the two of them, and together they founded the company, initially using their private funds and government grants before obtaining larger investments. Playdead eventually came to have eight employees during \"Limbo\" development, with temporary increases of up to 16 through freelancers. \"Limbo\" success led them to be able to reacquire the company back from investors, making Playdead completely independent.\nWithin the same year as \"Limbo\" release, Playdead began working on \"Project 2\", what would later become \"Inside\". The game was partially financed by the Danish Film Institute. Considered a spiritual successor to \"Limbo\", \"Inside\" has many of the same themes, including being a 2.5D platform game using a primarily monochrome palette. After using a custom game engine for \"Limbo\", Playdead used Unity to simplify development and a custom temporal anti-aliasing filter which was released in March 2016 under an open-source license. The game was officially announced at the E3 2014 with planned release in 2015, was later pushed to mid-2016 for further refinement, but had a demo at PAX Prime in August 2015. Martin Stig Andersen created the soundtrack again after \"Limbo\", creating sound via bone conduction with a human skull. \"Inside\" was first released in June for Xbox One, and later on Microsoft Windows, and received more overwhelming praise than \"Limbo\".\n\nShortly after the release of \"Inside\", on 19 July 2016, Patti left the company, selling his shares to Jensen. Patti felt that he was leaving Playdead \"in a state where it can definitely manage itself\", and stated \"Following almost 10 incredible years building Playdead from an idea to two dents in the games industry, I'm leaving to seek new challenges.\" Danish newspaper \"Dagbladet Børsen\" reported that a rift had developed between Patti and Jensen around 2015, that Patti described to \"Kotaku\" as \"the supposed timeline for the next project(s) and where I am in my life now\". The rift led to Jensen submitting a resignation letter to Patti from his position as creative director, though intending to stay on as a company executive. The letter had been misinterpreted by Patti as a full resignation from the company, and he subsequently removed Jensen's name from the Central Business Register for Playdead. This led to confrontation between the two and their representative lawyers that required intervention of the Danish Business Authority to resolve. This ultimately led to Patti being forced to take a payout of 50 million Danish krones (about ) for his shares. Patti was disappointed on the way his involvement with Playdead ended, but said that \"Arnt has been a really good friend and business partner for many years\". Patti went on to found a new UK-based studio, Jumpship, along with film animator Chris Olsen, by June 2017.\n\nPlaydead's third game, which has been teased as early as January 2017, will be a \"fairly lonely sci-fi game somewhere in the universe\", according to Jensen. This game will likely use a third-person perspective within a 3D world, as Jensen stated that the studio has \"been tired of the limitations in 2D games\".\n"}

{"id": "42985923", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42985923", "title": "SAGA (play)", "text": "SAGA (play)\n\nSAGA is a play written and directed by Kirjan Waage and Gwendolyn Warnock, performed by Wakka Wakka Productions in collaboration with Nordland Visual Theatre. According to Wakka Wakka's website, \"SAGA\" features 30 puppets, ranging from 3 inches to 10 feet, portrayed by an international cast of puppeteers from Iceland, Norway, Ireland, and the US'.\n\nThe play uses puppets, the puppeteers wearing masks throughout the play to make them look like Icelandic horses. It makes extensive use of recorded sound, along with sound effects produced by the puppeteers themselves, and quasi-cinematic effects like bullet time. There is some use of a diorama of the farm where the play is set, on which the movements of cars to the farm are performed. The play is in English spoken with Icelandic accents. It lasts for about an hour.\n\nThe play opens with the puppeteers performing a slow, sinister dance to bagpipe music evoking medieval music, looming over the character who turns out to be the protagonist of the play, Gunnar Oddmundsson. The play then cuts to a scene of Gunnar and his son Óli digging a hole for an outdoor jacuzzi. The scene is rural Iceland and Gunnar and Óli wear lopapeysur. Gunnar's wife Helga emerges and it becomes clear (partly through this scene and partly later in the play) that Ólafur is preparing the jacuzzi as part of a scheme to open the 'Viking Bed and Breakfast', tourist accommodation at which Helga is to run a restaurant and Gunnar to run horse and jeep tours. Their conversation is interrupted by the sudden appearance of Geir Haarde making his 'God bless Iceland' speech of October 6, 2008, breaking the news of the unfolding 2008–11 Icelandic financial crisis. Gunnar soon finds himself beset with bills he can no longer pay (literally: they flock around his head, held by the puppeteers). A flashforward shows Gunnar looking in on himself unconscious in a jeep that has crashed into the unfinished jacuzzi and telling himself to wake up. Meanwhile, flashbacks recount his earlier conversations with his friend at the bank, who glibly encouraged him to sell his fishing boat and fish-quota, invest the proceeds rather than pay off his mortgage, and to take out loans to buy his way into an idyllic pastoral life, purchasing land, a new house, a jeep, horses, and funding Gunnar's putative tourism business. The series of loans in these flashbacks are portrayed as being taken out with a growing tone of frivolity and derangement on the part of both Gunnar and the banker, with Gunnar coming to sign his name as 'Michael Jackson' and 'Elvis Presley' on loan documents, followed by a dance routine. Gunnar is also portrayed in a flashback horse-racing with his son.\n\nBack in the present time of the play, the financial strains in turn strain Gunnar's relationship with Helga: they are shown arguing over whose fault their deteriorating financial situation is. Gunnar meets his lawyer friend Jón and they agree to sue the bank in a narrative that runs through much of the play, implying that Jón becomes Gunnar's best or even only friend, but never with success. Gunnar participates in the Kitchenware Revolution, facing the police's use of tear gas of January 22, 2009 and his jubilation at the resignation of the government on January 26 is represented by the puppeteers performing an energetic dance with Icelandic flags to the soundtrack of Emilíana Torrini's 2009 hit Jungle Drum.\n\nThe revolution does not, however, help Gunnar's financial situation; while shearing sheep with Óli, he is visited by the local sheriff who serves an eviction notice: Gunnar's house is to be repossessed and put up for auction. Helga moves to Norway to take a job in a restaurant there, taking Óli with her. The backstory of her relationship with Gunnar is explored as a flashback to their first meeting, drunk, outside a bar, involving a graphic representation of drunken outdoor sex, during which Helga implicitly gets pregnant with Óli, on the occasion of whose birth Gunnar proposes marriage to Helga, which she accepts. After two months in Norway, Helga calls Gunnar asking for a divorce. Gunnar sells his horses at a knock-down price to be able to buy a plane ticket to Norway to try to save the marriage but is thwarted by the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull and their consequent disruption of air traffic. Gunnar's rage provokes the appearance of a representation of his inner Viking, depicted as a huge, bald, black-haired, axe-wielding figure reminiscent of Egill Skallagrímsson, and a fantasy of raising a \"Níðstöng\" against his oppressors followed by a homicidal, spade-wielding rampage against them. Gunnar does not, however, follow through on this, instead chasing the Viking away. However, he does not vacate his house ahead of the auction as he is supposed to, and chases away a prospective buyer. A few days later, the day before the auction, the auctioneer brings a policeman to the house to ask Gunnar to leave; Gunnar promises to and the policeman pretends that Gunnar already has. Inspired by his inner Viking, however, Gunnar instead pours petrol around the inside of the house and sets fire to it before driving the jeep into the unfinished jacuzzi. His is knocked unconscious by the crash, but wakes up, climbs out, and calls Jón asking for help. Jón is not shown to appear, however, and the play closes with Gunnar lying beside the crashed car surrounded by the sinister figures of the puppeteers.\n\nAccording to different sources, the play's world premier was in the Figurteatret in Stamsund, Norway, on December 7, 2012 or March 7th 2013 at the Baruch Performing Arts Center in New York City. It toured Norway in autumn 2013 and spring 2014 and was also performed at the National Theatre of Iceland on 5–6 June 2014.\n\nIn 2013 the play won a Drama Desk Special Award.\n"}
{"id": "76331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76331", "title": "Scarface (1932 film)", "text": "Scarface (1932 film)\n\nScarface (also known as Scarface: The Shame of the Nation and The Shame of a Nation) is a 1932 American gangster film directed by Howard Hawks and produced by Hawks and Howard Hughes. The screenplay, by Ben Hecht, is based on Armitage Trail's 1929 novel \"Scarface\", which portrays the life of Al Capone. The film stars Paul Muni as gangster Antonio \"Tony\" Camonte, and follows his violent rise through the Chicago gangland world. Ann Dvorak, and Karen Morley, Osgood Perkins, George Raft, and Boris Karloff co-star. One scene depicts a version of the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre. \n\n\"Scarface\" was produced before the introduction of the Production Code Administration in 1934, which enforced regulations on film content. However, the Hays Code, a more lenient precursor, called for major alterations, including a prologue condemning gangsters, an alternate ending to more clearly reprehend Camonte, and the alternative title \"The Shame of a Nation\". The censors believed the film glorified violence and crime. These changes delayed the film by a year, though some showings retained the original ending. Modern showings of the film of television and video represent the version with the original ending, though some DVD releases also include the alternate ending as a feature; these versions still maintain the changes Hughes and Hawks were required to make for the film to be approved by the Hays Office. A completely unaltered and uncensored version of the film is not known to exist.\n\nAudience reception was positive, but censors banned the film in several cities and states, forcing Hughes to remove it from circulation and store it in his vault. The rights to the film were recovered after Hughes's death in the 1970s. Alongside \"Little Caesar\" and \"The Public Enemy\" (both 1931), \"Scarface\" is regarded as among the most significant gangster films, and greatly influenced the genre.\n\n\"Scarface\" was added to the National Film Registry in 1994 by the Library of Congress. In 2008, the American Film Institute listed \"Scarface\" as the sixth best gangster film. It was the basis for the 1983 film of the same name starring Al Pacino.\n\nIn 1920s Chicago, Italian immigrant Antonio \"Tony\" Camonte acts on the orders of Italian mafioso John \"Johnny\" Lovo and kills \"Big\" Louis Costillo, the leading crime boss of the city's South Side. Johnny takes control of the South Side with Tony as his key lieutenant, selling large amounts of illegal beer to speakeasies and muscling in on bars run by rival outfits. However, Johnny repeatedly warns Tony not to mess with the Irish gangs led by O'Hara, who runs the North Side. Tony soon ignores these orders, barraging bars belonging to O'Hara, and attracting attention of the police and rival gangsters. Johnny realizes Tony is out of control and aspires to take his position.\n\nMeanwhile, Tony pursues Johnny's girlfriend Poppy with increasing confidence. At first, she is dismissive of him but pays him more attention as his reputation rises. She visits his \"gaudy\" apartment where he shows her his view of an electric billboard advertising Cook's Tours, which features the slogan which inspires him: \"The World is Yours.\"\n\nTony eventually decides to declare war and take over the North Side. He sends the coin flipping Guino Rinaldo, one of his best men and close friend, to kill O'Hara in a florist's shop that he uses as his base. This brings heavy retaliation from the North Side gangs, now led by Gaffney and armed with Thompson submachine guns—which instantly capture Tony's dark imagination. Tony leads his own forces to destroy the North Side gangs and take over their market, even to the point of impersonating police officers to murder several rivals in a garage. Tony kills Gaffney as he makes a strike at a bowling alley. The South side gang and Poppy go to a club and Tony and Poppy dance together in front of Johnny. After Tony conspicuously shows his intention to steal Poppy, Johnny believes his protégé is trying to take over, and he arranges for Tony to be assassinated while driving. Tony manages to escape this attack, and he and Guino kill Johnny, leaving Tony as the undisputed boss of the city. In order to elude the increasingly aggravated police force, Tony and Poppy leave Chicago for a month.\nTony's actions have provoked a public outcry, and the police are slowly closing in. After he sees his beloved sister Francesca (\"Cesca\") with Guino, he kills his friend in a jealous rage before the couple can inform him of their secret marriage. His sister runs out distraught, presumably to notify the police. The police move to arrest Tony for Guino's murder, and Tony takes cover in his house and prepares to fire at the police. Cesca comes back, planning to kill him, but decides to help him to fight the police. Tony and Cesca arm themselves and Tony shoots at the police from the window, laughing maniacally. Moments later, however, Cesca is killed by a stray bullet. Calling Cesca's name as the apartment fills with tear gas, Tony leaves on the stairs, and the police confront him. Tony pleads for his life, but makes a break for it, only to be shot by an unknown officer with a Tommy gun. He stumbles for a moment and falls in the gutter and dies. Among the sounds of cheering, the electric billboard blazes \"The World is Yours\".\n\n\nBusiness tycoon Howard Hughes, who dabbled in filmmaking, wanted a box office hit after the success of his 1931 film \"The Front Page\". Gangster films were popular in the early 1930s in the age of Prohibition, and Hughes wanted to make a film based on the life of gangster Al Capone superior to all other films in the genre. He was advised against making the film, as the genre was crowded; \"Little Caesar\" and \"The Public Enemy\" were already popular films, and Warner Bros. claimed nothing new could be done with the gangster genre. Furthermore, industry censors such as the Hays Office were becoming concerned with the glamorization of crime in media.\n\nHughes bought the rights to Armitage Trail's novel \"Scarface\", inspired by the life of Capone. Trail wrote for a number of detective story magazines during the early 20s, but died of a heart attack at the age of 28, shortly before the release of \"Scarface\". Hughes hired Fred Pasley, a New York reporter and authority on Capone, as a writer. Hughes asked Ben Hecht, who in 1929 had won the first Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for his silent crime film \"Underworld\", to be head writer. Suspicious of Hughes as an employer, Hecht requested a daily salary of one thousand dollars, to be paid every day at six o'clock. Hecht claimed he would only waste a day's labor if Hughes turned out to be a fraud. \n\nHughes wanted prominent film director Howard Hawks to direct and co-produce. This surprised Hawks, as the two had never been friendly; Hughes had filed a lawsuit against Howard Hawks in July 1930, alleging that Hawks's film \"The Dawn Patrol\" had plagiarized his film \"Hell's Angels\". Over a game of golf, Hughes promised to drop the lawsuit, and by the eighteenth hole, Hawks had become interested in directing the film. He became more convinced when he discovered Hecht would be the head writer. Hecht and Hawks worked together well, intending to portray the Capone character as of the Borgia Family, including the suggestion of incest between the main character and his sister, present in Trail's novel.\n\nHecht wrote the screenplay in eleven days in January 1931, adapted from Trail's novel. Additional writing was provided by Fred Pasley and W. R. Burnett, author of the novel \"Little Caesar,\" which the film \"Little Caesar\" was based on. Pasley wrote the screenplay including elements of book \"Al Capone: Biography of a Self-Made Man;\" the book contains a barbershop scene with Capone similar to the introduction of Tony Camonte in the film. Pasley was not credited for his work on the film. John Lee Mahin and Seton I. Miller rewrote the script for continuity and dialogue.\n\nBecause there were five writers, it is difficult to distinguish which components were contributed by which writer; however, the ending of \"Scarface\" is similar to Hecht's first gangster film \"Underworld,\" in which gangster Bull Weed traps himself in his apartment with his lover and fires at the hordes of police outside, and thus was likely a Hecht contribution.\n\nThe \"Scarface\" film bears little resemblance to the novel. Though the film contains the same major characters, plot points and incestual undertones, changes were made to reduce the length and the number of characters, and to satisfy the requests of censorship offices. To make gangsters appear less admirable, Tony's character was made to appear less intelligent and more brutish than in the novel. Similarly, the sibling relationship between Tony and the police officer was removed to avoid depicting police corruption.\n\nBoth the film and novel are loosely based upon the life of gangster Al Capone, whose nickname was \"Scarface\". The names of characters and locations were changed only minimally. Capone became Camonte and Moran became Doran. In some early scripts, Colosimo was Colisimo and O'Bannion was Bannon, but the names were changed to Costillo and O'Hara respectively. This, including other alterations made to characters and other identifying locations to maintain anonymity, were due to censorship and Hawks's concern about the overuse of historical details.\n\nBen Hecht had met Capone and \"knew a lot about Chicago\", so he did no research for the script. According to Hecht, while he worked on the script, Capone sent two men to visit him in Hollywood to make sure the film was not based on Capone's life. He told them the Scarface character was a parody of numerous people, and that the title was chosen as it was intriguing. The two left Hecht alone. \n\nThe references to Capone and actual events from the Chicago gang wars were obvious to audiences at the time. Muni's character had a scar similar to Capone, received in similar fights. The police in the film mention Camonte is a member of the Five Points Gang in Brooklyn, of which Capone was a known member. Tony kills his boss \"Big Louis\" Costillo in the lobby of his club; Capone was involved in the murder of his first boss \"Big Jim\" Colosimo in 1920. Rival boss O'Hara is murdered in his flower shop; Capone's men murdered Dean O'Bannion in his flower shop in 1924. The assassination of seven men in a garage, with two of the gunmen costumed as police officers, mirrors the St. Valentine's Day Massacre of 1929. The leader of this rival gang narrowly escapes the shooting, as did gang leader Bugs Moran. The film opens at the intersection of 22nd Street and Wabash Avenue in the middle of Capone's South Side, the site of many Capone's crimes.\n\nDespite the clear references to Capone, Capone was rumored to have liked the film so much he owned a print of it. However, this was likely an exaggerated claim by Hawks as Capone was imprisoned in Atlanta for tax evasion during the film's release.\n\nHawks and Hughes had difficulty casting popular actors, as most were under contract and studios were reluctant to let their actors freelance to independent producers. Producer Irving Thalberg suggested Clark Gable, but Hawks believed Gable was a personality, not an actor. After seeing Paul Muni on Broadway, talent agent Al Rosen suggested him for the lead role. Muni initially declined, feeling he was not physically suited for the role, but after reading the script, his wife Bella convinced him to take it. After a test run in New York, Hughes, Hawks, and Hecht approved Muni for the role. \n\nBoris Karloff was cast as British gangster Gaffney. Jack La Rue was cast as Tony Camonte's sidekick Guino Rinaldo (modeled after Capone's bodyguard Frank Rio) but as he was taller than Muni, Hawks worried he would overshadow Muni's tough Scarface persona. He was replaced with George Raft, a struggling actor at the time, after Hawks encountered him at a prizefight.\n\nThough Karen Morley was under contract at MGM, Hawks was close with MGM studio executive Eddie Mannix, who loaned out Morley for the film. She was reportedly given the choice between the role of Poppy or Cesca. Though Cesca was the stronger role, she chose Poppy as she felt Cesca would be a better fit for her friend Ann Dvorak. She considered this \"probably the nicest thing [she] did in [her] life\". Morley invited twenty-year old Dvorak to a party at Hawks' house to introduce them. According to Hawks, at the party, Dvorak zeroed in on George Raft who would be playing her love interest. He initially declined her invitation to dance. She tried to dance in front of him in order to lure him; eventually he gave in, and their dance together stopped the party. After this event, Hawks was interested in casting her, but had reservations about her lack of experience. After a screen test, he gave her the part, and MGM was willing to release her from her contract as a chorus girl. Dvorak had to both receive permission from her mother Anna Lehr and to win a petition presented to the Superior Court to be able to sign on with Howard Hawks as a minor.\n\nFilming lasted six months, which was long for films made in the early 1930s. Howard Hughes remained off-set to avoid interfering with the filming of the movie. Hughes urged Hawks to make the film as visually exciting as possible by adding car chases, crashes, and machine gun fire. Hawks shot the film at three different locations: Metropolitan Studios, Harold Lloyd Studios and the Mayan Theater in Los Angeles. Shooting took three months with the cast and crew working seven days a week. For the most violent scene of the film in the restaurant, Hawks cleared the set to avoid harming extras and had the set fired on by machine guns. The actors acted out the scene in front of a screen with the shooting projected in the back, so as everyone crowded under the tables in the restaurant, the room appeared to be simultaneously under fire.\n\nDuring filming, Hawks and Hughes met with the Hays Office to discuss revisions. Despite that, \"Scarface\" was filmed and put together quickly. In September 1931, a rough cut of the film was screened for the California Crime Commission and police officials, neither of whom thought the movie was a dangerous influence for audiences or would illicit a criminal response. Irving Thalberg was given an advanced screening and was impressed by the film. Despite the positive feedback the film was given, the Hays Office was insistent on changes before final approval.\n\n\"Scarface\" was produced and filmed during Pre-Code era of Hollywood, which spanned from 1930 to 1934. The Pre-Code era is characterized by its informal and haphazard screening and regulation of film content, prior to the establishment of the Production Code Administration (PCA) in July 1934. Before the influence of the PCA, censorship was overseen by the Motion Pictures Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA). In 1930, Will Hays, the chairman of the MPPDA, attempted to regulate the content of movies; the MPPDA became known as the Hays Office. The goal of the Hays Office was to censor nudity, sexuality, drug use and crime. More specific to \"Scarface\", the Hays Office wanted to avoid the sympathetic portrayal of crime by either showing criminals recognizing the error of their ways or showing criminals get punished. The Hays Office, however, did not have authority to remove material from a film until the MPPDA officially pledged to adhere to the Production Code in 1934, so they relied on delaying film release and lobbying to remove scenes or prevent movies from being produced. Films evaded the Hays Office by adding extremely suggestive scenes so they could remove them and satisfy the Hays Office enough that they wouldn't notice the lesser immoralities that remained in the film. \n\nJ.E. Smyth called \"Scarface\", \"one of the most highly censored films in Hollywood history.\" Howard Hawks believed the Hays Office had personal vendettas against the movie, while Hughes believed the censorship was due to \"ulterior and political motives\" of corrupt politicians. However, James Wingate of the New York censor boards rebutted that Hughes was preoccupied with \"box office publicity\" in producing the film. After repeated demands for a script rewrite from the Hays Office, Hughes ordered Hawks to shoot the film, \"Screw the Hays Office, make it as realistic, and grisly as possible.\" The Hays Office was outraged by \"Scarface\" when they screened it. The Hays office called for scenes to be deleted, scenes to be added to condemn gangsterism, and a different ending. They believed Tony's death at the end of the film was too glorifying. In addition to the violence, the MPPDA felt an inappropriate relationship between the main character and his sister was too overt, especially when he holds her in his arms after he slaps her and tears her dress; they ordered this scene be deleted. Hughes, in order to receive the MPPDA's approval, deleted the more violent scenes, added a prologue to condemn gangsterism, and wrote a new ending. \n\nIn addition, a couple scenes were added to overtly condemn gangsterism, such as a scene in which a newspaper publisher looks at the screen and directly admonishes the government and the public for their lack of action in fighting against mob violence and a scene in which the chief detective denounces the glorification of gangsters. Hawks refused to shoot the extra scenes and the alternate ending. They were directed by Richard Rossen, earning Rossen the title of \"co-director\". Hughes was instructed to change the title to \"The Menace\", \"Shame of the Nation\" or \"Yellow\" to clarify the subject of the film; after month of haggling, he compromised with the title \"Scarface, Shame of the Nation\" and by adding a foreword condemning the \"gangster\" in a general sense. Hughes made an attempt to release the film under the title \"The Scar\" when the original title was disallowed by the Hays office. Besides the title, the term \"Scarface\" was removed from the film. In the scene where Tony kills Rinaldo, Cesca says the word \"murderer\", but she can be seen mouthing the word \"Scarface\".\n\nThe original script had Tony's mother loving her son unconditionally, praising his lifestyle, and even accepting money and gifts from him. In addition, there was a politician who, despite campaigning against gangsters on the podium, is shown partying with them after hours. The script ending had Tony staying in the building, unaffected by tear gas and a multitude of bullets fired at him. After the building is on fire, Tony is forced to exit, guns blazing. He is sprayed with police gun fire but appears unfazed. Upon noticing the police officer who had been arresting him throughout the film, he fires at him, only to hear a single \"click\" noise implying his gun is empty. He is killed after the police officer shoots him several times. A repeated clicking noise is heard on the soundtrack implying he was attempting to fire while he was dying.\n\nThe first version of the film (Version A) was completed on September 8, 1931, but censors required the ending be modified or they would refuse to grant \"Scarface\" a license. Paul Muni was unable to re-film the ending in 1931 due his work on Broadway. To combat this Hawks used a body double. The body double was mainly filmed by way of shadows and long shots in order to mask Muni's absence in these scenes. The alternate ending (Version B) differs from the original ending in the manner that Tony is caught and in which he dies. Unlike the original ending where Tony escapes the police and dies after getting shot several times. In the alternate ending, Tony reluctantly handing himself over to the police. After the encounter, Tony's face is not shown. A scene follows where a judge is addressing Tony during sentencing. The next scene is the finale, in which Tony (seen from a bird's eye view) is brought to the gallows and hung.\n\nHowever, Version B did not pass the New York censors and Chicago censors. Howard Hughes felt the Hays office had suspicious intentions in rejecting the film, because Hays was friends with Louis B. Mayer and Hughes believed censorship was to prevent wealthy independent competitors from producing films. Confident his film could stand out among audiences more than Mayer's films, Hughes organized a press showing of the film in Hollywood and New York. \"The New York Herald-Tribune\" praised Hughes for his courage to stand against censors. Hughes disowned the censored film and finally in 1932 released Version A—with the added text introduction in states that lacked strict censors (Hughes attempted to take the New York censors to court). This 1932 release version led to bona-fide box office status and positive critical reviews. Hughes was successful in subsequent lawsuits against the boards that censored the film. Due to criticism from the press, Hays claimed the version shown in theaters was the censored film he had previously approved.\n\nDue to the film's urban setting, nondiegetic music (not visible on the screen or implied to be present in the story) was not used in the film. The only music that appears in the film is during the opening and closing credits and during scenes in the movie where music would appear naturally in the film's action such as in the nightclub. Adolf Tandler served as the film's musical director, while Gus Arnheim served as the orchestra's conductor. Gus Arnheim and his Cocoanut Grove Orchestra perform \"Saint Louis blues\" by W. C. Handy and \"Some of These Days\" by Shelton Brooks in the nightclub. The tune Tony whistles in the film is the sextet from Gaetano Donizetti's popular opera \"Lucia di Lammermoor.\" This tune is accompanied by words that translate to, \"What restrains me in such a moment?\", and this tune continues to appear during violent scenes in the movie. The song Cesca sings while playing the piano is \"Wreck of the Old 97\".\n\nThe serious play Tony and his friends go to see, leaving at the end of Act 2, is John Colton and Clemence Randolph's \"Rain\", based on W. Somerset Maugham's story \"Miss Sadie Thompson\". The play opened on Broadway in 1922 and ran throughout the 1920s. (A film version of the play, also titled \"Rain\" and starring Joan Crawford, was released by United Artists the same year as \"Scarface.\") Though fairly inconspicuous in the film, and unnoticed by most viewers, the Capone family was meant to be partially modeled after the Italo-Spanish Borgia family. This was most prominent thought the subtle and arguably incestuous relationship Tony Camonte and his sister share. Camonte's excessive jealousy of his sister's affairs with other men hint at this relationship. Coincidentally, Donizetti wrote the opera for \"Lucrezia Borgia\", about the Borgia family, and \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" from where Tony Camonte's whistle tune comes.\nAfter battling with censorship offices, the film was released almost a year late, behind \"The Public Enemy\" and \"Little Caesar\" which had been filmed at the same time. \"Scarface\" was released in theaters on April 9, 1932. Hughes planned a grand premiere in New York, but New York censor boards rejected the showing of the film. State censorship boards in Ohio, Virginia, Maryland, and Kansas and citywide censorship boards in Detroit, Seattle, Portland, and Chicago banned the film as well. Hughes threatened to sue censorship boards for preventing the release of his film much to the approval of \"The New York Herald Tribune\". Each state had a different board of censors which allowed Hughes to release the film in areas without strict censorship. At the request of Will Hays, Jason Joy convinced the strict censor boards to allow the release of \"Scarface\", because the Hays Office acknowledged and appreciated the changes Hughes made to \"Scarface\". Joy visited state censor boards individually, stating that that while the Hays Office was against the positive portrayal of crime, gang films were actually documents against gangster life. Joy was successful and eventually all state and municipal censorship boards allowed \"Scarface\" to be released, accepting only the cut and censored version of \"Scarface\".\n\nThe film was released on DVD on May 22, 2007, and was released again on August 28, 2012, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of Universal Studios, by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment. Both versions of the DVD include an introduction by \"Turner Classic Movies\" host and film historian Robert Osborne and the film's alternate ending. On video and on television, the film maintains Hawks's original ending but still contains the other alterations he was required to make during filming. A completely unaltered and uncensored version of the film is not known to exist.\n\nAt the time of release, audience reception was generally positive. According to George Raft, who met Al Capone a few times at casinos, even Capone himself liked the film adding, \"you tell 'em that if any of my boys are tossin' coins, they'll be twenty-dollar gold pieces.\" \"Variety\" cited \"Scarface\" as having, \"that powerful and gripping suspense which is in all gangster pictures is in this one in double doses and makes it compelling entertainment,\" and that the actors play, \"as if they'd been doing nothing else all their lives.\" The National Board of Review named \"Scarface\" as one of the best pictures of 1932. However, at the time of release in 1932, there was a general public outcry about the film and the gangster genre in general which negatively affected box office earnings of the film. Jack Alicoate gave \"Scarface\" a scathing review in \"The Film Daily\" that the violence and subject matter of the film left him with, \"the distinct feeling of nausea\". He goes on to say the film, \"should never have been made\" and showing the film would, \"do more harm to the motion picture industry, and every one connected with it, than any picture ever shown.\" Although Ben Hecht was often critical of his work for Hollywood, he admitted that \"Scarface\" was \"the best-directed picture [he has] seen\". Hecht did; however, criticize Muni's performance. Having known Al Capone, Hecht claimed that Muni portrayed Capone as too \"silent\" and \"moody\", more similar to \"Hitler\". Some critics disagreed with the casting of British actor Boris Karloff, believing his accent was out of place in a gangster film; a \"New York Times\" article stated, \"..his British accent is hardly suitable to the role\". However, other critics considered him a high point. The film earned $600,000 at the box office and while \"Scarface\" was more of a financial success than Hughes's other films at the time, due to the large cost of production, it is unlikely the film did better than break even.\n\nThe film initiated outrage among Italian organizations and individuals of Italian descent, remarking a tendency of filmmakers to portray gangsters and bootleggers in their films as Italian. In the film, an Italian American makes a speech condemning gangster activities; this was added later in production to appease censors. This, however, didn't prevent the Italian embassy from disapproving \"Scarface\". Believing the film to be offensive to the Italian community, the Order Sons of Italy in America formally denounced the film and other groups urged community members to boycott the film and other films derogatory towards Italians or Italian-Americans. Will Hays wrote to the ambassador in Italy, excusing himself from scrutiny by stating the film was an anachronism, because it had been delayed in production for two years and didn't represent the current practice of censorship at the time. Nazi Germany permanently prohibited showings of the film. Some cities in England banned the film as well, believing the British Board of Film Classification's policy on gangster films was too lax. Several cities in the United States including Chicago and some states refused to show the film. The magazine \"Movie Classics\" ran an issue urging the people to demand to see the film at theaters despite the censorship bans. The film broke box office records at the Woods Theatre in Chicago after premiering Thanksgiving Day, November 20, 1941 after having been banned from showing in Chicago by censors for nine years. Despite the favorable reception of the film among the public, the censorship battles and the unflattering reviews from some press contributed to the film's generally poor performance at the box office. Upset at the inability to make money from \"Scarface\", Howard Hughes removed the film from circulation. The film remained unavailable until 1979 except for occasional release prints of suspect quality from questionable sources. Hughes had plans in 1933 to direct and produce a sequel to \"Scarface\", but due to stricter censorship rules, the film was never made.\n\nBased on a sampling of 36 reviews from 2002–2018, on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, \"Scarface\" holds a 100% rating; all reviews were positive.\n\nIn 1994, \"Scarface\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The character of Tony Camonte ranked at number 47 on \"AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains\" list. The film was named the best American sound film by critic and director Jean-Luc Godard in \"Cahiers du Cinéma\". In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its \"Ten Top Ten\"—the best ten films in ten \"classic\" American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. \"Scarface\" was acknowledged as the sixth best in the gangster film genre. The 1983 version was placed 10th, making \"Scarface\" the only film to make the same \"10 Top 10\" list as its remake.\n\nScholars debate whether \"Scarface\" classifies as a film with historical significance or as merely a Hollywood gangster-era flick. Its historical significance was augmented by the film's writing credits: W.R. Burnett, author of gangster novel \"Little Caesar\" from which the film of the same name was based on, Fred D. Pasley, a prominent Chicago gangland historian, and ex-Chicago reporter Ben Hecht. Events similar to the assassination of Jim Colismo and the St. Valentine's Day Massacre contribute to the film's realism and authenticity. Film critic Robert E. Sherwood stated the film, \"merits...as a sociological or historical document...[and] an utterly inexcusable attempt has been made to suppress it—not because it is obscene...but because...it comes to close to telling the truth.\"\n\nAccording to film studies professor Fran Mason, a prominent theme in the film is excess. The opening of the film sets the stage as Big Louie Costillo sits in the remnants of a wild party, convincing his friends his next party will be bigger, better, and have \"much more everything\". This indicates the excessive life of a gangster, whether in pleasure or in violence. The death scene of Costillo sets the next tone of excess. In this scene, the audience sees only the shadow of Tony Camonte with a gun, hears the shots and the sound of the body hitting the floor. The violent scenes become more severe as the film progresses. Most of the violence in the film is shown through montage, as scenes go by in sequence, showing the brutal murders that Tony and his gang commit such as roughing up bar owners, a drive by bombing, and the massacre of seven men against a wall. A scene shows a peel-off calendar rapidly changing dates while shot by a machine gun, making the excessive violence clear. The violence is not only perpetrated by the gangsters. The police in the final scene with Tony and Cesca spare no effort to catch the notorious Camonte siblings, visible through the disproportionate number of police officers and cars surrounding the apartment complex to apprehend one man. Tony and the police's excessive use of violence throughout the film normalizes it. An element of parody underlies Tony's abnormal joy in using Tommy guns. In the scene in the restaurant in which men from the North side gang attempt to shoot Tony with a Tommy, he obtains pleasure from the power. Rather than cowering beneath the tables, he tries to peek out to watch the guns in action, laughing maniacally from his excitement. He reacts jovially upon getting his first Tommy gun and enthusiastically leaves to, \"write [his] name all over the town with it.\"\n\nThe gangster's excessive consumption is comically represented through Tony's quest to obtain expensive goods and show them off. In Tony's first encounter with Poppy alone on the staircase, he boasts about his new suit, jewelry, and bullet-proof car. Poppy largely dismisses his advances calling his look, \"kinda effeminate\". His feminine consumption and obsession with looks and clothes is juxtaposed by his masculine consumption which is represented by his new car. Later, Tony shows Poppy a stack of new shirts, claiming he will wear each shirt only once. His awkwardness and ignorance of his own exorbitance makes this Gatsby style scene more comical than serious. His consumption serves to symbolize the disintegration of values of modernity, specifically represented by his poor taste and obsession with money and social status. Tony's excess transcends parody and becomes dangerous, because he represents a complete lack of restraint which ultimately leads to his downfall.\n\nTony's excess is manifest in the gang wars in the city. He is given express instruction to leave O'Hara, Gaffney, and the rest of the North side gang alone. He disobeys because of his lust for more power, violence, and territory. Not only does he threaten the external power structure of the gangs in relation to physical territory, he disrupts the internal power structure of his own gang by blatantly disobeying his boss Johnny Lovo. Gaffney's physical position juxtaposes Tony's position. Throughout the film, Gaffney's movement is restricted by both setting and implication, because of the crowded spaces in which he is shown onscreen and his troupe of henchmen he is constantly surrounded by. Tony is able to move freely in the beginning of the film, becoming progressively more crowded until he is as confined as Gaffney. He is surrounded by henchmen and cannot move as freely throughout the city. This, however, is self-imposed by his own excessive desire for territory and power.\n\nThe theme of excessiveness is further exemplified by Tony's incestuous desires for his sister, Cesca, whom he attempts to control and restrict. Their mother acts as the voice of reason, but Tony does not listen to her, subjecting his family to the excess and violence he brings upon himself. His lust for violence mirror's Cesca's lust for sexual freedom, symbolized by her seductive dance for Rinaldo at the club. Rinaldo is split between his loyalty for Tony and his passion for Cesca, serving as a symbol of the power struggle between the Camonte siblings. Rinaldo is a symbol of Tony's power and prominence; his murder signifies Tony's lack of control and downfall, which ends in Tony's own death.\n\nCamonte's rise to prominence and success is modeled after the American Dream, but more overtly violent. As the film follows the rise and fall of an Italian gangster, Tony becomes increasingly more Americanized. When Tony appears from under the towel at the barbershop, this is the first time the audience gets a look at his face. He appears foreign with a noticeable Italian accent, slicked hair and an almost Neanderthal appearance evident by the scars on his cheek. As the movie progresses, he becomes more Americanized as he loses his accent and his suits change from gaudy to elegant. By the end of the film, his accent is hardly noticeable. Upon the time of his death, he had accumulated many \"objects\" which portray the success suggested by the American Dream: his own secretary, a girlfriend of significant social status (more important even is she was the mistress of his old boss), as well as a fancy apartment, big cars, and nice clothes. Camonte exemplifies the idea of the American Dream that one can obtain success in America by following Camonte's own motto to, \"Do it first, do it yourself, and keep on doin' it.\" On the other hand, Camonte represents the American urge to reject modern life and society, in turn rejecting Americanism itself. The gangster strives for the same American Dream as anyone else, but through violence and illicit activity, approaches it in a way at odds with modern societal values.\n\nControl of territory is a theme in the gangster film genre in a physical sense and on the movie screen. Tony works to control the city by getting rid of competing gangs and gaining physical control of the city, and he likewise gains control of the movie screen in his rise to power. This is most evident in scenes and interactions involving Tony, Johnny, and Poppy. In an early scene in the film, Tony comes to Johnny's apartment to receive his payment after killing Louie Costillo. Two rooms are visible in the shot: the main room, where Tony sits, and the room in the background where Poppy sits and where Johnny keeps his money. Lovo goes into the back room but Tony does not, so this room represents Johnny's power and territory. The men are sitting across from each other in the scene with Poppy sitting in the middle of them in the background representing the trophy they are both fighting for. However, they both appear equally in the shot, representing their equality of power. Later, in the nightclub scene, Tony sits himself in between Poppy and Johnny showing he is in control through his centrality in the shot. He has gained the most power and territory, as indicated by \"winning\" Poppy.\n\n\"Scarface\" represents the American fears and confusion stemmed from the technological advancement of the time: whether technological advancement and mass production be feared or celebrated. An overall anxiety post-World War 1 was whether new technology would cause ultimate destruction or whether it would help make lives easier and bring happiness. In the film, Tony excitedly revels in the possibilities of machine guns can bring by killing more people, more quickly and from further away. This represents the question of whether mass production equals mass destruction or mass efficiency.\n\nThe use of playful motifs throughout the film showcased Howard Hawks's dark comedy he expressed through his directing. In the bowling alley scene, where rival gang leader Tom Gaffney was murdered, when Gaffney throws the ball, the shot remains on the last standing bowling pin, which falls to represent the death of kingpin Tom Gaffney. In the same scene, before the death of Gaffney, a shot shows an \"X\" on the scoreboard, foreshadowing Gaffney's death. Hawks used the \"X\" foreshadowing technique 15 to 20 times throughout the film (seen first in the opening credits) which were chiefly associated with death appearing many times (but not every scene) when a death is portrayed; the motif appears in numerous places, most prominently as Tony's \"X\" scar on his left cheek. The motifs mock the life of the gangster. The gangster's hat is a common theme throughout gangster films, specifically \"Scarface\", as representative of conspicuous consumption. Hawks included hand gestures, a common motif in his films. In \"Scarface\", George Raft was instructed to repetitively flip a coin, which he does throughout the film.\n\nCamonte's apartment looks out on a neon, flashing sign that says \"The World Is Yours\". This sign represents the modern American city as a place of opportunity and individualism. As attractive as the slogan is, the message is impossible, yet Tony doesn't understand this. The view from his apartment represents the rise of the gangster. When Camonte is killed in the street outside his building, the camera pans up to show the billboard, representative of the societal paradox of the existence of opportunity yet the inability to achieve it. According to Robert Warshow, the ending scene represents how the world is not ours, but not his either. The death of the gangster momentarily releases us from the idea of the concept of success and the need to succeed. In regards to the theme of excess, the sign is a metaphor for the dividing desires created by modernity seen through the lens of the excessive desires of the gangster persona.\n\n\"Sharp\" and \"hard-edged\", \"Scarface\" set the visual style for the gangster films of the 1930s. Hawks created a violent, gripping film through his use of strong contrast of black and white in his cinematography, for example, dark rooms, silhouettes of bodies against drawn shades, and pools of carefully placed light. Much of the film is shown to take place at night. Tight grouping of subjects within the shot and stalking camera movement followed the course of action in the film. The cinematography is dynamic and characterized by highly varied camera placement and mobile framing.\n\nDespite its lack of success at the box office, \"Scarface\" was one of the most discussed films of 1932 due to its subject matter, and its struggle and triumph over censor boards. \"Scarface\" is cited (often with \"Little Caesar\" and \"The Public Enemy\") as the archetype of the gangster film genre, because it set the early standard for the genre which continue to appear in Hollywood. However, \"Scarface\" would be the last of the three big gangsters films of the early 1930s, as the outrage at the Pre-Code violence caused by the three films, particularly \"Scarface\" sparked the creation of the Production Code Administration in 1934. Howard Hawks cited \"Scarface\" as one of his favorite works and the film was a subject of pride for Howard Hughes. Hughes locked the film in his vaults a few years after release, refusing many profitable offers to distribute the film or to buy its rights. After his death in 1976, filmmakers were able to gain access to the rights to \"Scarface\" which sparked the 1983 remake starring Al Pacino.\n\nPaul Muni's performance in \"Scarface\" as \"the quintessential gangster anti-hero\" contributed greatly to his rapid ascent into his acclaimed film career. Paul Muni received significant accolades for his performance as Tony Camonte. Critics praised Muni for his robust and fierce performance. Al Pacino stated he was greatly inspired by Paul Muni and Muni influenced his own performance in the 1983 \"Scarface\" remake. However, despite the impressive portrayal of a rising gangster, critics claim the character minimally resembled Al Capone. Unlike Camonte, Capone avoided grunt work and typically employed others to do his dirty work for him. Moreover, Muni's Scarface at the end revealed the Capone character to be a coward as he pled for mercy and tried to escape before getting shot in the street. Capone wasn't known for his cowardice and didn't die in battle.\n\n\"Scarface\" would be Ann Dvorak's best and most well-known film. The film launched Raft's lengthy career as a leading man. Raft, in the film's second lead, had learned to flip a coin without looking at it, a trait of his character, and he made a strong impression in the comparatively sympathetic but colorful role. Howard Hawks told Raft to use this in the film to camouflage his lack of acting experience. A reference is made in Raft's later role as gangster Spats Columbo in \"Some Like it Hot\" (1959), wherein he asks a fellow gangster (who is flipping a coin) \"Where did you pick up cheap trick?\"\n\nThe movie \"Scarface\" may have had an influence on actual gangster life four years after the film was released. In 1936, Jack McGurn who was thought to be responsible for the St. Valentine's Massacre depicted in the film, was murdered by rivals in a bowling alley.\n\nIn October 1946, after World War II and the relations between Italy and the United States softened, Titanus, an Italian film production company was interested in translating \"Scarface\" into Italian. Initially, upon requesting approval from the Italian film office, the request was rejected due censorship concerns of the portrayal of violence and crime throughout the film. There was no initial concern about the film's portrayal of Italians. Titanus appealed to the Italian film office calling \"Scarface\", \"one of the most solid and constructive motion pictures ever produced overseas\". They lobbied to bring in a foreign language film to help domestic film producers save money in the Italian economy damaged by the recent war. After receiving approval at the end of 1946, Titanus translated a script for dubbing the film. One difference in the Italian script, is the names of the characters were changed from Italian sounding to more American sounding. For example, Tony Camonte was changed to Tony Kermont, and Guino Rinaldo was changed to Guido Reynold. This, and several other changes were made to conspicuously remove references to Italians. Another example is the difference in the scene in the restaurant with Tony and Johnny. In the American version, Tony makes an comical statement about the garlic in the pasta, whereas in the Italian translation, the food in question is a duck liver pâté, a less overtly Italian reference to food. Moreover, in the American version, the gangsters are referred to as illegal immigrants by the outraged community; however, in the Italian dubbed version, the citizen status of the criminals is not mentioned, merely the concern of repeat offenders.\n\nThe film was redubbed into Italian in 1976 by the broadcasting company \"Radio Televisione Italiana\" (RAI). Franco Dal Cer translated the script and the dub was directed by Giulio Panicali. Pino Locchi dubbed the voice of Tony Camonte for Paul Muni and Pino Colizzi dubbed the voice of Gunio Rinaldo for George Raft. A difference between the 1947 version and the 1976 version is that all of the Italian names are and Italian cultural references were untouched from the original American script. The 1976 version celebrates the Italian backgrounds of the characters, adding noticeably different Italian dialects to specific characters. This version of the dubbed film translates the opening and closing credit scenes as well as the newspaper clippings shown into Italian; however, the translation of the newspaper clippings was not done with particular aesthetic care.\n\nThe film was redubbed in the 1990s and released on Universal's digital edition. According to scholarly consensus, the 1990 dub is a combination of re-voicing and reuse of audio from the 1976 redub.\n\nAfter the rights for \"Scarface\" were obtained after the death of Howard Hughes, Brian de Palma released a remake of the film in 1983 featuring Al Pacino as Scarface. The film was set in contemporary Miami and is known for its inclusion of graphic violence and obscene language, uncharacteristic of the 1932 film. The 2003 DVD \"Anniversary Edition\" limited edition box set of the 1983 film included a copy of its 1932 counterpart. At the end of the 1983 film, a title reading \"This film is dedicated to Howard Hawks and Ben Hecht\" appears over the final shot.\n\nUniversal announced in 2011 that the studio is developing a new version of \"Scarface\". The studio claims the new film is neither a sequel nor a remake, but will take elements from both the 1932 and the 1983 version, including the basic premise of a man who becomes a kingpin in his quest for the American Dream. On August 11, 2016, Universal announced Antoine Fuqua was in talks to direct the remake. On February 10, 2017, Fuqua left the remake with the Coen brothers rewriting the script. In 2018, Fuqua was back on the project.\n\n\"Scarface\" is often associated with other pre-code crime films released in the early 1930s such as \"The Doorway to Hell\" (1930), \"Little Caesar\" (1931) and \"The Public Enemy\" (1931). According to Fran Mason of the University of Winchester, \"Scarface\" is more similar to the film \"The Roaring Twenties\" than its early 1930s gangster film contemporaries, because of its excess.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Mankiewicz and starring Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine. The screenplay by playwright Anthony Shaffer was based on his 1970 Tony Award-winning play. Both Olivier and Caine were nominated for Academy Awards for their performances. This was Mankiewicz's final film. Critics gave the film overwhelmingly positive reviews, and would later note similarities between it and Caine's 1982 film \"Deathtrap\".\n\nAndrew Wyke, a successful writer of crime fiction, who lives in a large country manor house filled with elaborate games and automata, invites his wife's lover Milo Tindle, a hairdresser of Italian heritage, to his home to discuss the situation. Andrew explains that he has tired of his wife and wants Milo to take her off his hands. In order to provide Milo with enough money to take care of her, Andrew suggests that Milo steal some jewellery from the house, with Andrew recouping his losses through an insurance claim. Milo agrees and allows Andrew to lead him through an elaborate charade to fake the robbery. At the conclusion, Andrew pulls a pistol and reveals that the entire plot was meant to frame Milo as a robber, giving Andrew an excuse for shooting him. Andrew then appears to execute Milo by shooting him in the head.\n\nA few days later, a policeman, Inspector Doppler, arrives at the manor house to investigate Milo's disappearance. Andrew at first purports to know nothing, but his guilt becomes evident as the inspector collates clues. Frightened, Andrew breaks down and explains the burglary ruse, but insists that he only pretended to shoot Milo using a blank cartridge and that his rival left the house humiliated but alive. Andrew insists that he has no knowledge of what happened to Milo after he left the house. After finding more seemingly unmistakable evidence that a murder has taken place recently in the house, Doppler arrests Andrew for murder. As Andrew is about to be taken to the station, Doppler reveals himself to actually be Milo, in disguise, having engaged in the deception to get revenge on Andrew.\n\nJust as the score seems to be even between the two, Milo explains that they will now play another game, this time involving a real murder. Milo describes how he visited Andrew's mistress, Tea, that afternoon, and strangled her. The police will soon be arriving and he has planted evidence throughout the house that could well incriminate Andrew in Tea's murder. Andrew dismisses this, but phones Tea anyway. Tea's flatmate, Joyce, tells him tearfully that Tea has been strangled and her body found. Andrew now hunts through the house in an increasing fervour, searching for each piece of evidence on cryptic clues from Milo, who is revelling in Andrew's predicament. Andrew finds the last item just as Milo sees the police arriving outside the house. Milo answers the door to the police while a dishevelled Andrew straightens himself up. In the background we hear Milo talking to the police officers in an attempt to stall their entry into the house, which Andrew pleaded with him to do. Milo then invites the officers in. However, there are no policemen. Milo reveals that he faked Tea's death with Joyce and Tea's willing help, thus fooling Andrew a second time.\n\nMilo gets ready to leave, but he continues to taunt Andrew with humiliating information he obtained from both Andrew's wife and his mistress. Andrew trains a gun on Milo and threatens to kill him. However, Milo warns him that he has anticipated this reaction and really has called the police, who are due any time. If Andrew kills him then he will be caught red-handed. Andrew, pushed too far, refuses to believe any of it and shoots Milo, mortally wounding him. The police arrive and approach the house and a distraught and defeated Andrew locks himself in the house. As Milo dies, he tells Andrew to be sure to tell the police that it was \"all just a bloody game\".\n\n\nShaffer was initially reluctant to sell the film rights to the play, fearful it would undercut the success of the stage version. When he finally did relent, he hoped the film would retain the services of Anthony Quayle, who had essayed the role of Wyke in London and on Broadway. Alan Bates was Shaffer’s pick for the part of Milo Tindle. In the end, director Mankiewicz opted for Olivier and Caine.\n\nWhen they met, Caine asked Olivier how he should address him. Olivier told him that it should be as \"Lord Olivier\", and added that now that that was settled he could call him \"Larry\". According to Shaffer, Olivier stated that when filming began he looked upon Caine as an assistant, but that by the end of filming he regarded him as a full partner.\n\nThe likeness of actress Joanne Woodward was used for the painting of Marguerite Wyke.\n\nThe production team intended to reveal as little about the movie as possible so as to make the conclusion a complete surprise to the audience. For this reason there is a false cast list at the beginning of the film which lists fictional people playing roles that do not exist. They are Alec Cawthorne as Inspector Doppler, John Matthews as Detective Sergeant Tarrant, Eve Channing (named after the characters Eve Harrington and Margo Channing from Mankiewicz's 1950 film \"All About Eve\") as Marguerite Wyke, and Teddy Martin as Police Constable Higgs.\n\nMuch of the story revolves around the theme of crime fiction, as written by Dorothy L. Sayers (Lord Merridew = Lord Peter Wimsey) or Agatha Christie, whose photo is included on Wyke's wall, and how it relates to real-life criminal investigations. Class conflict is also raised between Wyke, who has the trappings of an English country gentleman, compared to Tindle, the son of an immigrant from a poor area of London.\n\nThe film received extremely positive reviews, and with modern audiences has 96% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nThe film was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier), Best Director and Best Music, Original Dramatic Score. Olivier won the New York Film Critics award for Best Actor as a compromise selection after the voters became deadlocked in a choice between Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in \"The Godfather\" after Stacy Keach in \"Fat City\" won a plurality in initial voting and rules were changed requiring a majority. Shaffer received an Edgar Award for his screenplay.\n\nThe film was the second to have practically its entire cast (Caine and Olivier) nominated for Academy Awards after \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" in 1966 and the first where exactly all of the actors in the film were nominated. (\"Virginia Woolf\" featured uncredited bit parts by actors playing the roadhouse manager and waitress.) This feat has been repeated only by \"Give 'em Hell, Harry!\" (1975), in which James Whitmore is the sole credited actor.\n\nCritics Roger Ebert, Janet Maslin, Gary Arnold of the \"Washington Post\", and several film historians have all noted similarities between \"Sleuth\" and Caine's 1982 film \"Deathtrap\". \"SCTV\" episode 121 featured Dave Thomas playing Michael Caine, arguing that the two films were different because the library appeared on different sides of the set.\n\nWhile questioning Wyke, Doppler points out that the clown costume that Tindle was wearing when he was shot is missing, though the clown's mask is later found and put on the head of the plastic skeleton in the cellar. He is probably implying that Tindle was buried with it.\n\nIn the trailer for the film, there are the scenes with Doppler laying out the evidence against Wyke as shown in the movie. They include him pulling open the shower curtains in one of the bathrooms and exposing the clown's jacket, dripping wet and apparently with bloodstains on it. This scene was not included in the final film.\n\nThe Academy Film Archive preserved \"Sleuth\" in 2012.\n\nIn September 2006 Kenneth Branagh announced at the Venice Film Festival his new film of the play, with the screenplay by Nobel laureate Harold Pinter. Caine starred in this adaptation, this time in the role of Wyke, while Jude Law played Tindle as a struggling actor. Production was completed in March 2007, and released in the UK on 23 November 2007. The remake did not use any of the dialogue in Shaffer's original script, and was considered unsuccessful in comparison to the original.\n\n\n"}

A series of personal commentaries drawn from Greenberger's experiences with this body of work has aired regularly on National Public Radio's \"All Things Considered\". \n\nSome of the Duplex Nursing Home residents, all identified by name, became recurring characters in the zine and its various offshoots and adaptations.\n\nIn 1979, having just completed a degree in fine arts as a painter, Greenberger took a job as activities director at the Duplex Nursing Home. On his first day, he met the residents of the nursing home and abandoned painting in favor of conversation. \"This is my art,\" he said. In this unexpected setting, Greenberger found an unusual medium and a desire to portray the people he met as living human beings instead of \"just repositories of their memories or the wisdom of the ages.\" Instead of collecting oral history about significant events, Greenberger focused on talking one-on-one with ordinary people about ordinary things — the joy of a close shave or answers to questions like \"Can you fight city hall?\"\n\nMany of the elderly people interviewed in \"Duplex Planet\" appeared regularly in the pages of the zine, and collaborated directly with Greenberger.

Disillusioned by the space program, Martin agrees to handle public relations for one more mission before termination.

{"id": "31441", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31441", "title": "Tragedy of the anticommons", "text": "Tragedy of the anticommons\n\nThe tragedy of the anticommons is a type of coordination breakdown, in which a single resource has numerous rightsholders who prevent others from using it, frustrating what would be a socially desirable outcome. It is a mirror-image of the older concept of tragedy of the commons, in which numerous rightsholders' combined use exceeds the capacity of a resource and depletes or destroys it. The \"tragedy of the anticommons\" covers a range of coordination failures including patent thickets, and submarine patents. Overcoming these breakdowns can be difficult, but there are assorted means, including eminent domain, laches, patent pools, or other licensing organizations.\n\nThe term originally appeared in Michael Heller's 1998 article of the same name and is the thesis of his 2008 book. The model was formalized by James M. Buchanan and Yong Yoon. In a 1998 \"Science\" article, Heller and Rebecca Eisenberg, while not disputing the role of patents in general in motivating invention and disclosure, argue that biomedical research was one of several key areas where competing patent rights could actually prevent useful and affordable products from reaching the marketplace.\n\nIn early aviation, the Wright brothers held patents on certain aspects of aircraft, while Glenn Curtiss held patents on ailerons which was an advance on the Wrights' system, but antipathy between the patent holders prevented their use. The government was forced to step in and enforce the existence of a patent pool.\n\nIn a 1998 \"Harvard Law Review\" article by Michael Heller, he noted that after the fall of Communism, in many Eastern European cities, there were a lot of open air kiosks but also a lot of empty stores. Upon investigation, he concluded that because many different agencies and private parties had rights over the use of store space, it was difficult or even impossible for a startup retailer to negotiate successfully for the use of that space. Even though all the persons with ownership rights were losing money with the empty stores, and stores were in great demand, their competing interests got in the way of the effective use of space.\n\nMichael Heller says that the rise of the \"robber barons\" in medieval Germany was the result of the tragedy of the anticommons. Nobles commonly attempted to collect tolls on stretches of the Rhine passing by or through their fiefs, building towers alongside the river and stretching iron chains to prevent boats from carrying cargo up and down the river without paying a fee. Repeated attempts were made by the Holy Roman Empire, including several efforts over the centuries led by the Emperor himself, to regulate toll collection on the Rhine, but it was not until the establishment of the \"Rhine League\" of the Emperor, certain nobles, and certain clergy that the control of the \"robber barons\" over the Rhine was crushed by military force. River tolls on the Rhine, increasingly imposed by states rather than individual lords, remained a sticking point in relations and commerce in the Rhine basin until the establishment of the Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine in 1815.\n\nMichael Heller and Rebecca Eisenberg are academic law professors who believe that biological patents creating a \"tragedy of the anticommons,\" \"in which people underuse scarce resources because too many owners can block each other.\" Others claim that patents have not created this \"anticommons\" effect on research, based on surveys of scientists.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "53348917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53348917", "title": "Women in comedy", "text": "Women in comedy\n\nWomen in comedy refers to females who participate in comedic works as well as their experience within the social environment. While primarily dominated by men throughout history, women have been represented in the field of comedy since the mid 1700s. Comedy, or creative works with the intention of humor, is thought to have originated in ancient Greek theatre in 425 BCE. Some of the first figures to enter the field, however, were faced with resistance and discrimination. A sense of humor in women was previously thought to have meant the ability to laugh at a man's joke, rather than tell the joke herself. When women did finally enter comedy (in its various forms), it was seen as niche, thus making bookings hard to come by.\n\nEarly acts were often based in the standard roles of women as a housewife and mother. Comedy was tailored to what men would find to be both funny and non-threatening. As women gained slow acceptance to their presence in comedy, they were able to expand the topics that they covered. Since then, women have made significant gains in the field, having found fame through stand-up, television, movies, and writing. Women such as Amy Schumer, Phyllis Diller, Wanda Sykes, Gina Barreca and many others have contributed to the world of comedy, spanning both time and medium.\n\nAs comedic license has grown, comedy has become a tool within the scope of feminism. By reclaiming a previously male-exclusive art form, female comedians are able to use patriarchal structure against itself. Today, feminist comedy draws attention to female issues such as menstruation, rape, gender inequality, beauty norms, and machismo. As a readily acceptable and understandable medium of communication, comedy lends itself to the feminist movement, allowing women's issues to be more wide-spread in general society.\n\nStand-up comedy is a form of comedy in which performers act in front of a live audience, creating an interactive dependency. Jokes range from short one-liners to longer monologues. The comedic form requires a takeover the stage, in order for the comedian's material to \"kill.\" For women, the direct contact with the audience puts their womanhood on display. Many female comedians choose to wear loose-fitting clothing to take their femininity out of the spotlight.\n\nAmerican late night television (\"The Tonight Show\", \"The Daily Show\" etc...) has been dominated by white men for almost its entire existence. With the exception of \"Full Frontal\" with Samantha Bee, no woman has had a late night show on a major network of her own. The platform allows a variety of comedic (monologues and shorts) and political (interviews and exposés) opportunities.\n\nFilm in general, as well as comedic film, continues to show the gender imbalance of other forms of comedy. In 2014, a study found that there were 2.24 male characters for every one female character. Of the movies surveyed, only 30.9% of the speaking characters were female. Additionally, one of the major storylines in the film industry (the romantic comedy), consistently follows traditional female roles, relegating women to simply searching for a male partner.\n\nThe gender imbalance between men and women can be found all over, even on Wikipedia. The page: list of comedians show a much higher number of males than females.\n\nIn the United States, there is a large gender gap between men and women in comedy with regards to both pay and number. In 2014, all ten of the top ten paid comedians were male, bringing in a total of $173 million. In 2016, one female entered the list: Amy Schumer, at number two.\n\nA study in 2017 found a large gender imbalance in UK comedic panel shows, with only 31% of the appearances. However, the same study also found marked improvement since 1989, when the statistic was 3%. Additionally, the UK industry website Chortle lists 269 female comedian as compared to 1,279 male comedians.\n\nImbalance can also be seen at the level of the comedy club. For example, the prestigious New York comedy club Carolines featured 20% female performers to 80% male in 2014. Within the writers room, gender imbalance persists. Women made up only 10 percent of writers working on the top 250 domestic grossing films of 2010 and 15 percent of writers and 18 percent of creators in prime-time television during the 2010–2011 season.\n\nIn South Korea, of 70 comedic variety shows, 13 had all male hosts and guests, and 23 with all male hosts, meaning that more than half of these shows lack female hosts. Only two shows had all females hosts and guests. Shows without hosts often try to model marriages by pairing up male and female celebrities. While this does achieve some sense of gender balance, it uses very traditional roles.\n\nThe early female figures in stand up, such as Phyllis Diller, were able to enter the mainstream through their willingness to self-deprecate and declare themselves ugly. Other early female comediennes, such as Mae West and Helen Kane, used sex appeal to attract male audiences. In other words, they were able to enter, but on the terms of male comedians. More modern female comedians cite a need to tailor their comedy to what men would find to be funny, with change in this mentality only coming very recently.\n\nStand up comedy, in particular, is described as a masculine art form. The words that are used to describe success are often violent, such as \"killed\" or \"annihilated.\" The performer must take charge of the stage, claiming it as their own via the phallic symbol of the microphone. The structure of joke is often centered on an attack on another party. The aggression that such an art form necessitates is encouraged in males but discouraged in females.\n\nIn many societies around the world, a woman's role has affected her flexibility in comedy. In countries that historically view women as inferior to men, comedy is seen as a masculine discipline. The common perception that women aren't funny pervades all aspects of comedy, including stand-up, television, and movies. The comedy establishment, influenced by patriarchal society, has relegated women to the \"side of tears and loss.\" Systematic sexism can be found at the level of audience members, bookers, agents, and male comics. As a powerful social tool, comedy brings women outside of the traditional role that has been defined as theirs.\n\nWomen have experience everything from heckling audience members calling them gendered terms like bitches or sluts, to being invited to fake comedic festivals (so the organizer could have sex with the female comedian), to being introduced in roasts as the girl that \"slept with one of the judges.\"\n\nHumor has been used a tool of feminism both for its ability to point out patriarchy and the structures it creates as well as identify the common female experience. A distinction must be made between female humor and feminist humor. Female humor is self-deprecatory, turning inwards to the performer herself. Feminist humor, by contrast, looks outwards at the societal structures that demean women. It is aggressive and pointed, using comedic language formerly reserved for men only as a tool of liberation. Feminist humor is to be an agent of change for women by drawing attention to their lowered position in society.\n\nBing argues that for feminist humor to be most effective at its goal of change, it should be inclusive, rather than divisive. Divisive humor, or jokes that focus on male structures or male-bashing, do not advance feminism, but rather continue to marginalize females. Inclusive humor that riffs off of the shared experience of women, can be subversive without the negative effects of divisive humor. Bing continues to say that when humor falls into this inclusive comedy it contributes to feminism by first, contradicting the age old stereotype that women cannot be funny, and second, by undermining the status quo.\n\nHumor itself can be used to make strong structural changes in a society. Many times humor has been used to subvert hierarchical structures. For example, the Guerrilla Girls used humor to point out the patriarchal, unchanging nature of the Tony awards, which give the majority of their prizes to men. It also functions to establish an in-group (those making and understanding the joke) and an out-group (those on the receiving end). Through this process, humor can create solidarity within a group, but can also make another feel excluded. For women, this can serve to strengthen them as a community.\n\nOutside of the United States, women have been having similar experiences in their attempts to enter field of comedy, colored by their own cultural influences. One such women is Farhana Muna, a Bangladeshi Muslim comic. Her material is focused on Bangladeshi life and culture, from parties to relatives commenting on weight loss. According to Muna, she often feels constrained by what is deemed appropriate or not for a Bangladeshi Muslim women. She must watch what she says and wears. Muna reemphasized the sentiment that there is a wider range of comedy acceptable for men. She has also faced criticism for her actions, including her choice to not wear the hijab, with people calling her a bad Muslim. However, she continues her comedic work due to the community of women that she has met through it. Muna sees comedy as a collective platform of expression, a way to share her experiences in a relatable way.\n\nWomen have been on the rise in India's comedy as recently as 2016. In a country that has deeply entrenched patriarchal values, these female comedians face great amounts of cultural animosity. Despite this discrimination women such as Aditi Mittal and Neeti Palta have found success in an industry that did not readily accept them.\n\nIn South Korea, female comedians do not encounter many comedic opportunities. Only two television programs are completely hosted by females, with the other major television opportunity being couples shows. South Korean TV shows only offer gender balance when women are in gendered roles. Producers see men as more advantageous hires as the shows' audiences are majority women. Additionally, there was a worry that audiences would react badly to strong women in television. As the woman's movement grows in South Korea, so too do the opportunities for women. Rather than featuring beautiful women as prizes to be won by males contestants, new shows such as \"Sisters' Slam Dunk\" (which premiered in 2016) feature women working together to solve problems.\n\nOne of the most prominent early figures in American female comedy, Phyllis Diller made her comedic debut at the Purple Onion Comedy Club in the 1950s. Her stand-up routines focused on the problems of the suburban housewife, a previous unaddressed area by male comics. By opening acknowledging her lack of physical attractiveness and by incorporating self-deprecation into her routines, Diller was able to enter comedy in a time when funny and attractive women were seen as threatening. However, by confining her comedy to her inability to fulfill her traditional role, she reinforced female stereotypes rather than dismissing them.\n\nJoan Rivers (active from 1959–2014) was one of the first female comedians to utilize the \"talk/conversational\" method, one that was suited to television talk shows. Unlike Phyllis Diller, who was quite unlike her comedic personality, the comedy of Joan Rivers more closely reflected her personality. She often drew on her own personal experiences as a self-proclaimed Jewish princess. Unlike her predecessors, Rivers did not downplay her attractiveness, but rather incorporated it into her riffs on life as a single woman. Still, her comedy was focused on the traditional problems of a women (trying to find a boyfriend and husband, being a good wife etc).\n\nJane Curtin was a part of the inaugural class of Not Ready for Prime Time Players on \"Saturday Night Live\" in 1975. On SNL, she was the anchor for Weekend Update and started in many well known skits including \"Coneheads\". On Weekend Update, she served as the liberal counterpart to Dan Aykroyd’s conservative perspective. In 2008, when asked about the environment at Saturday Night Live, Curtin said that female writers faced an extremely difficult battle, especially when cast member like John Belushi were actively working against them. While fundamentally believing that women are not capable of humor, he also would sabotage pieces written by women. Despite this atmosphere, Jane Curtin had a very successful career at SNL and went on to work on sitcoms, Broadway, and various movies.\n\nFigures such as Tina Fey have paved the way in the modern era for large-scale growth in female comedy. Her public appointment as the first female head writer of Saturday Night Live placed her in a position to serve as a feminist comedy icon. Many of her sketches became iconic, particularly her satirical portrayal of Vice Presidential Candidate Sarah Palin. Her comedic writing (Mean Girls, 30 Rock, Bossypants, Baby Mama, Date Night etc...), in addition to achieving great public notice, was well received by critics.\n\nMiranda Hart is a female comedian from the UK. She is most well-known for her television series \"Miranda.\" Her awkward and clumsy character in the show is a embodiment of all the society neuroses that women face in daily life. Such a style of comedy makes her into an everywoman. Hart herself sees a divide in comedy, with some using comedy as a tool to increase their coolness (others) and some using comedy as a tool for clowning around (her). By staying within the clowning realm of comedy, she achieved a cult following.\n\nAmy Schumer is a female comedian from the United States, and was the highest paid entertainer in her field in 2016.

Her comedy is often focused on gender politics, touching on the issues that women face throughout their lives. One of her most famous skits centers around women not being able to accept compliments, resulting in escalating forms of self-deprecation - culminating in mass suicide, rather than accepting the compliment.\n\nGina Barreca is a female comedian from the United States, known around the world for her books. These include Babes in Boyland, I Used to be Snow White but I Drifted, If you Lean In will Men Just Look Down Your Blouse and many others.
