Conrad fighting against aliens on the Leopold spaceship.\n\n\"Assault\" is an immediate sequel to \"Alien Breed: Evolution\". Conrad, Chief Engineer of the starship \"Leopold\" , attempts to restart the engines of a hostile, alien-infested ghost ship that has crashed into his ship dragging them both towards the planet's surface. When this fails, the android Mia boards the ghost ship, and Conrad must escort her to the bridge where she can hack into the ship's computers and restart the engines. Upon arrival, Mia finds that she must connect herself to the ship's main computer.\n\nThe ships artificial intelligence then kills Mia and possesses her corpse. It reveals itself to be the ships chief science officer, who became an AI to achieve immortality. It then reveals that the ship is a 300-year-old scientific research vessel from Earth that went missing and that the chief science officer is responsible for the creation of the aliens. Conrad then sets out to destroy the AI in order to restart the engines. The game ends here on a cliffhanger.

Ammunition and items such as med kits can only be optained through computer terminals, which also serve as save points.\n\nConrad can move freely in all directions; the camera can also be rotated at will by the player. Conrad can be affected by the environment, and he will receive damage if hit by explosions, fires, electrical disturbances, and enemy turrets. Every level has an amount of data pads, which contain relevant information about the game's story. \"Assault\" includes a survival mode that puts the player to fight as much aliens as possible before being taken down.

Avex (short for audio visual expert) manages J-pop talents like Ayumi Hamasaki and internet sensation PikoTaro. It has also shifted into other business domains like anime, video games and live music events like partnering with Ultra Music Festival and hosting the annual A-nation.\n\nAvex is an acronym of the English words Audio Visual Expert. Since its foundation, its corporate name was Avex D.D., Incorporated, and ten years later it was changed to Avex, Incorporated.\n\nThe current name, Avex Group Holdings, Incorporated, was adopted in 2004 as part of reconstruction process after Tom Yoda's resignation. Avex Group Holdings, Incorporated was used for the main subsidiaries, while the old name (Avex, Incorporated) was for entertainment components of the Group.\n\nIn 2005, Avex, Incorporated became Avex Entertainment, Incorporated, and stayed on as part of the Group.\n\nAvex was registered June 1, 1973 as , although it did not become established until 1988. They began as a CD wholesaler based in Machida, Tokyo. In September 1990, they opened a recording studio and created Avex Trax as a music label. In the same year, they created \"Musique Folio Inc.\", a music publishing company, which became \"Prime Direction Inc.\"\n\nIn 1993, they transferred to Aoyama, Tokyo and created a U.S. branch, called \"AV Experience America Inc.\" The year also marked the first of Avex's yearly events. It was held in Tokyo Dome under the name \"avex rave '93\" and attracted 50,000 attendees. This marked the foundation of the Cutting Edge label.\n\nIn 1994, they formed two UK subsidiaries, \"Rhythm Republic Limited\" and \"Avex U.K. Limited,\" to particularly distribute the parent label's music releases in what would later become the Chinese special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau. Later that year, they opened a disco, claimed on their website to be \"the world's largest scale disco\", named Velfarre.\n\nIn 1997, they opened a series of concert halls called \"Zepp\" with Sony Music Entertainment Japan. That same year, following Hong Kong's handover to the People's Republic of China, \"Rhythm Republic Limited\" and \"Avex U.K. Limited\" were merged to form a new company, \"Avex Asia Limited,\" which was re-branded as \"Avex Hong Kong Limited\" in September 2008 before being absorbed into \"Avex Taiwan Incorporated\" in January 2014.\n\nIn early 1999, they signed an agreement with Walt Disney Records and Hollywood Records to handle the companies' Japanese CD releases. Later that year \"Avex Mode\", an animation company, was established. In December, the company was listed on the 1st section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol 7860.\n\nIn 2001, Avex opened the \"avex artists academy\" music school.\n\nIn 2002, they released the \"CCCD\", a type of copy-protected CD, and opened their building in Aoyama, paid for by Sumitomo Life and worth 205 billion yen.\n\nIn 2003, they opened a classical music business (named Avex Classics).\n\nIn 2004, they began selling Japanese music CDs in South Korea and Avex President Max Matsuura \"spotted\" former idol Ami Suzuki performing live at the annual festival of their school, Nihon University. He subsequently signed her to the Avex label.\n\nIn 2005, Avex acquired distribution rights for Aozora Records' catalogue including all future Hitomi Yaida releases.\n\nIn early 2008, Avex partnered with Victor JVC to officially create the label D-topia Entertainment as a business partnership between the labels and its founder, Terukado Onishi, with the sales promotion handled by Victor while the area promotion handled by Avex. As part of the Avex Group's 20th anniversary celebration, a big project occurred with avex trax's \"produced by avex trax\" artists; the band Girl Next Door, formed and debuted in September 2008.\n\nAvex Group launched its own IPTV service, BeeTV, May 2009 in partnership with NTT DoCoMo.\n\nIn August 2004, a feud between Max Matsuura and co-founder Tom Yoda almost ruined the group. It started because of Yoda's ambition to expand Avex into other entertainment-related ventures, especially producing movies. In addition, he accused Ryuhei Chiba, the company's executive director and president of Avex Inc. (now Avex Planning and Development), of pursuing personal profit from a few big artists.\n\nJuly 30: In a board meeting, Yoda introduced a resolution calling on Chiba to resign because of an alleged conflict of interest. A source says the disagreement arose because Chiba had signed an artist managed by a member of his family. The board backed Yoda's resolution in a 6-1 vote. However, Matsuura — described by insiders as a close ally of Chiba — introduced a second resolution demanding that Yoda step down due to \"a difference of opinion in management principles.\" Matsuura's motion was defeated 5-2. He and Chiba resigned the next day.\nAugust 2: Matsuura and Chiba announced their resignations in a meeting with employees of Avex. Chiba denied any fault, while Matsuura complained that Avex had lost its love of music and said he wanted to start over. They had the support of many staff who also said they would quit. More significantly, the label's top star, Ayumi Hamasaki, said would leave. As a result, Avex's stocks in the TSE fell by 16 percent that day.\n\nAugust 3: Due to pressure by employees and artists and to save the company from bankruptcy, Yoda resigned and was replaced by Toshio Kobayashi.\n\nAGHD is listed at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and Börse München of Germany under the ticker symbol AX8.\n\nMore K-pop artists from other agencies continued to sign with Avex such as YG Entertainment's 2NE1 (2010), S-plus Entertainment's SS501 member Kim Hyung Jun (2011), Pledis Entertainment's After School (2011), NH Media's U-KISS (2011) and Yejeon Media's Shu-I (2011).\n\nOn July 21, 2011, it was announced that Avex had paired with Korean management label YG Entertainment to form YGEX Entertainment.\n\nIn 2012, the group began offering limited releases for sale, DRM-free for the first time within Japan on Amazon MP3. Max Matsuura and Toshio Kobayashi, the company's top two individual shareholders, launched their own investment companies to anchor their shares in 2012.\n\nAs a show of modernization, Avex Group moved to Izumi Garden Tower in Roppongi in October 2014. The company was designated to the 36th floor – the former address of DWANGO.\n\nOn February 15, 2017, Avex Group discontinued all foreign exports of Blu-rays, DVDs, and CDs published under their Avex Pictures label. The company provided no official statement on the decision.\n\nIn April 2010 – the Avex Group corporation was re-structured to establish Avex Music Publishing Inc. as a consolidated subsidiary, in a corporate spin-off of music publishing division of Avex Group Holdings Inc. Thus the Avex Group became a pure holding company, with a corporate structure as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Group is a member of the IFPI for Hong Kong and Japan.\n\nEach year since 2002, Avex has hosted a summer concert tour around Japan, \"A-Nation\", featuring the company's most successful acts. It is held every weekend in August in different Japanese cities. Top Avex acts like Ayumi Hamasaki, Kumi Koda, AAA, Ai Otsuka, BoA, Do As Infinity, Hitomi, TRF, Every Little Thing and TVXQ perform to major crowds each year. In 2008, Namie Amuro made her first appearance at A-Nation and performed on all dates that year. For the first time in 2012, Kumi Koda did not perform due to her pregnancy.\n\nFestival sponsors include Joe Weider and his Weider fitness products, Seven & I Holdings Co., NTT DoCoMo, Mizuno Corp., Nissay (through its You May Dream!

The series was created by Jonathan E. Steinberg and Robert Levine for Starz. It debuted online for free on YouTube and other various streaming platform and video on demand services on January 18, 2014. The debut on cable television followed a week later on January 25, 2014. Steinberg is executive producer, alongside Michael Bay, Brad Fuller and Andrew Form, while Michael Angeli, Doris Egan, and Levine are co-executive producers.\n\nOn July 26, 2013, Starz renewed the show for a ten-episode second season, which premiered on January 24, 2015. The early renewal, six months before the first season premiered, was based on the positive fan reaction to the show at the San Diego Comic-Con. The series was renewed for a third season on October 12, 2014, and a fourth season on July 31, 2015, both before the respective previous seasons had premiered. On July 20, 2016, Starz announced that the series' fourth season would be its last; the season premiered on January 29, 2017, and the series concluded on April 2, 2017.\n\n\"Black Sails\" is set roughly two decades before the events of \"Treasure Island\" and during the Golden Age of Piracy. Feared Captain Flint brings on a younger crew member as they fight for the survival of New Providence island. According to the first episode, \"In 1715 West Indies, the pirates of New Providence Island threaten maritime trade in the region. The laws of every civilized nation declare them \"hostis humani generis\", enemies of all mankind. In response, the pirates adhere to a doctrine of their own...war against the world.\" Real life pirates who are fictionalized in the show include Anne Bonny, Benjamin Hornigold, Jack Rackham, Charles Vane, Ned Low, Israel Hands and Blackbeard.\n\nThe plot of the first season focuses on the hunt for the Spanish treasure galleon \"Urca de Lima.\" At the beginning of the second season, the treasure from the Urca de Lima has been stranded on the shores of Florida with Spanish soldiers guarding it, but by the conclusion of the second season, the treasure has been taken by Jack Rackham and his crew and brought to New Providence Island. During the second season, the questions of how and why Flint—a man who was a navy officer and London gentleman—turned to piracy are answered. The third and the fourth seasons focus on the war for the control of New Providence between the pirates and the British Empire, represented by Captain Woodes Rogers.\nThe series is filmed at Cape Town Film Studios in Cape Town, South Africa, with local production company Film Afrika.\n\nThe opening title sequence was made by Imaginary Forces and directors Michelle Dougherty and Karin Fong with the backing sea shanty inspired theme composed by \"Battlestar Galactica\" and \"The Walking Dead\" composer Bear McCreary. It accurately features an instrument of the period in the form of the hurdy-gurdy.\n\nFor the amount of detail that was added to the vessels, it took over 300 workers to build just one ship.\n\nIn real life, recurring actor Nick Boraine is Louise Barnes's husband; Anna-Louise Plowman and Chris Larkin are, respectively, Toby Stephens's wife and brother; and Guy Paul is Harriet Walter's husband.\n\nThe first season of \"Black Sails\" received mixed to positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the season holds a rating of 62%, based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. The site's consensus reads, \"\"Black Sails\" boasts visual appeal, but the show's bland characters aren't strong enough to keep the show from being dragged down into its murky depths of aimless exposition\". On Metacritic season one has a score of 58 of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nTim Goodman of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said, \"This ambitious pirate story is helped immensely by going beyond the pay cable freedoms that often bog down lesser shows in boobs, blood and sex. \"Black Sails\" steers itself out of that realm after a few episodes and makes a play for bigger, more complicated stories\". Robert Lloyd of \"The Los Angeles Times\" said, \"\"Black Sails\" is a pirate treasure. The Starz series vividly depicts the daily life of pirates.\" Jeff Jensen of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said, \"Not even a guilty pleasure, \"Black Sails\" is arrrrrr-estingly good\". Tom Long of the \"Detroit News\" commented \"Alliances are made and broken, power shifts go this way and that, blood is spilled, and wenches keep wenching. It's oddly addictive, and the cast—made up mostly of British, Australian, and Canadian actors—is as sharp as you'd expect from pay cable\".\n\nConversely, Brian Lowry of \"Variety\" said, \"\"Black Sails\" never quite takes off, developing into a tired treasure hunt with indifferent casting and stock characters. Counting Michael Bay among its producers, this South Africa–lensed production might tempt adventure-seeking viewers to plunge into its crystal-blue waters, but despite some handsome aspects, the show ultimately proves as hollow as its CGI-rendered ships\". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club said, \"\"Black Sails\" is a handsome illusion at times, but it rarely finds its way beyond that.\"\n\nThe second season of the show currently holds a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 5 reviews, with an average rating of 8.6/10. Neil Genzlinger of \"The New York Times\" said, \"Starz knows the formula for these costume-heavy action dramas from experience with shows like \"Spartacus\" and \"Camelot\". And that formula is executed with particular skill in 'Black Sails,' thanks to some strong performances and an exploration of the consequences of greed that could have come out of modern-day Wall Street\".\n\n"}

The record and book complement one another, with the record usually a radio theater-style version of the story or a soundtrack recording, and the book providing visuals and text to the story. Often a tone or other kind of cue in the recording will prompt the reader to turn pages.\n\nBook-and-record sets are popular as teaching tools and aids to reading, and as a simple form of multimedia entertainment. Cartoon characters are common subjects (or stars) of the stories, as are comic book superheroes and other media franchises, characters and personalities. Occasionally popular children's or family movies are adapted for book and record; the stories may either be re-presented by a new cast of performers, members of the movie cast, or the audio taken directly from the movie, with narration added.\n\nDisneyland Records and related companies produced several such works, as did Peter Pan Records (and its offshoot Power Records) and others, from the dawn of long-playing records and the 45rpm single until the digital age. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Capitol Records produced many book-and-record sets for children, ranging from everything from Bozo the Clown to the classical music fantasy \"Sparky's Magic Piano\". A \"picture storybook\" of the 1982 movie \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" narrated by Michael Jackson became a highly prized collectible, after it went out of print.

{"id": "1251796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1251796", "title": "Corporate media", "text": "Corporate media\n\nCorporate media is mass media production, distribution, ownership, and funding which is dominated by corporations and their CEOs. It is sometimes used as a pejorative term in place of \"mainstream media\", which tends to also be used as a derisive term, to indicate a media system that does not serve the public interest.\n\nMedia critics such as Robert McChesney, Ben Bagdikian, Ralph Nader, Jim Hightower, Noam Chomsky, Thom Hartmann, Edward S. Herman, Amy Goodman and Bernie Sanders suggest that such a media system, especially when allowed to dominate the mainstream media, inevitably will be manipulated by these same corporations to suit their own interests. These critics point out that the main national networks, NBC, CBS, and ABC, as well as most if not all of the smaller cable channels, are owned, funded, and controlled by an interconnected network of large corporate conglomerates and international banking interests, which may manipulate and filter out news that does not fit their corporate agenda. Media companies are slowly understanding how to accelerate the fluidity of media content across delivery channels to \"expand revenue opportunities, broaden markets and reinforce consumer loyalties and commitments\". Users are then understanding how to master these various media technologies to bring the flow of media more fully under their control and to interact/co-create with other users. Sometimes, these two forces reinforce each other, creating closer, more rewarding, relations between media producers and consumers. Sometimes the two forces conflict, resulting in constant renegotiations of power between these competing pressures on the new media ecology.\n\nNoam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman have established a propaganda model which purports to explain this bias. The common misinterpretation of this model is that all bias is conscious and centralized. The hypothesis is that the process is decentralized and operates as a confluence of factors, that includes the overt pressure from owners and advertisers, but also by the gradual internalization of the biases and values of the corporate owners, leading to self-censorship.\n\nPulitzer Prize winning American journalist Glenn Greenwald accused mainstream U.S. media of \"spreading patriotic state propaganda\". \n\nOther factors include the tendency of journalists to avoid doing original research, instead obtaining news from the same few wire services, such as Reuters and Associated Press, which themselves tend to cover the same news under the same perspective. Due to the desire to reduce operation costs, the mainstream media favor news pieces that are pre-made by these news agencies instead of conducting their own reporting.\n\nCritiques have pointed to the ownership of major news outlets in USA by corporations. Bernie Sanders, an American anti-establishment politician contends that media are an arm of the ruling class. In his view, \"corporate media by definition has conflict of interests.\" He points to alleged low pay of workers in media companies such as Disney which biases them against publishing specials on minimum wage and wealth and income equality. There have been allegations of corporate media's manipulation of presidential campaign facts against Bernie Sanders.\n\nThis same economic pressure makes media susceptible to manipulation by government and other corporate sources through the widespread use of press releases, often created by industry-funded public relations firms.\n\nThe point of view and statements made by governments, officials, military, police, national security organizations (such as the FBI and CIA), as well as various other political offices are regularly reported as facts and are published without any (or very little) fact checking by the corporate media. Perhaps the most infamous current example of the impact of the propaganda model on world events and societies was during the two-year period following the 2001 US attacks. During this time, according to a five year in-depth research project conducted by the Centre for Public Integrity; the President of the United States George W. Bush and seven high-ranking officials in his administration made at least 935 false statements about the threat posed to the world and to US national security by Saddam Hussein. These false statements were virtually uncontested by the corporate media and presented as a sound rationale for both the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the \"War on Terror\". \n\nIn \"Buying the War\" on PBS, Bill Moyers noted 27 \"Washington Post\" editorials supporting George W. Bush's ambitions to invade Iraq. National security correspondent Walter Pincus reported that he had been ordered to cease his reports that were critical of Bush administration. According to author and journalist Greg Mitchell, \"By the \"Post\" own admission, in the months before the war, it ran more than 140 stories on its front page promoting the war, while contrary information 'got lost', as one \"Post\" staffer told Kurtz.\"\n\nThe result was the \"manufacturing of consent\" for the invasion of Iraq and \"The Global War on Terror/ism\" in which hundreds of thousands of people have lost their lives to date. As an example, Jessica Yellin on Anderson Cooper 360 admitted being pressured by corporate executives to present positive stories during the run up to the Iraq war.\n\nANDERSON COOPER 360 Transcript of Jessica Yellin reporting:COOPER: Jessica, McClellan took press to task for not upholding their reputation. He writes: \"The National Press Corps was probably too deferential to the White House and to the administration in regard to the most important decision facing the nation during my years in Washington, the choice over whether to go to war in Iraq. The 'liberal media' -- in quotes -- didn't live up to its reputation. If it had, the country would have been better served.\" Dan Bartlett, former Bush adviser, called the allegation \"total crap.\" What is your take? Did the press corps drop the ball?JESSICA YELLIN, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I wouldn't go that far. I think the press corps dropped the ball at the beginning. When the lead-up to the war began, the press corps was under enormous pressure from corporate executives, frankly, to make sure that this was a war that was presented in a way that was consistent with the patriotic fever in the nation and the president's high approval ratings.And my own experience at the White House was that, the higher the president's approval ratings, the more pressure I had from news executives—and I was not at this network at the time—but the more pressure I had from news executives to put on positive stories about the president. I think, over time...COOPER: You had pressure from news executives to put on positive stories about the president?YELLIN: Not in that exact—they wouldn't say it in that way, but they would edit my pieces. They would push me in different directions. They would turn down stories that were more critical and try to put on pieces that were more positive, yes. That was my experience.Factcheck.org (Factcheck.org), created by the Annenberg school of Public Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, found hundreds of misrepresentations in political ads that were never corrected by the mainstream media. Studies also show that those who rely on the media for their information have a poor understanding of the issues and are unable to discern misrepresentations in political advertising.\n\nAs documented by authors Sheldon Rampton and John Stauber, it is becoming increasingly common for video news releases (VNR) to be created by government and corporations, mimicking TV news story-format, to be used straight into broadcasting in a newscast. Other factors include the cost of litigation. Large corporations tend to sue over any news that are against their interests, causing great expense for the news editors. Even if the litigation is lost, the cost of time and pressure will certainly bias a reporter towards avoiding such possibility.\n\nIn March 2018, American documentary filmmaker Michael Moore criticized the \"corporate media\", saying \"You turn on the TV, and it's 'Russia, Russia, Russia!' These are all shiny keys to distract us. We should know about the West Virginia strike. What an inspiration that would be. But they don't show this\".\n\nTo illustrate the growing problem of monocracy, Bagdikian notes that in the 1980s, \"less than 1 percent of all corporations, have 87 percent of all sales. [The corporates] are the aristocrats of the American Industrial economy; the remaining 359,500, in terms of their national power, are the peasantry.\" This conflict continues to arise as \"dominant media companies are further [integrating] into the ruling forces of the economy.\" The directorates of major companies interlock with others and control the content of multiple dominating media and information distribution (i.e., newspapers, magazines, radio and television companies, book publishers, film industries, and even multinational banking investors). They become directly influenced by still other powerful industry, creating the \"Endless Chain\" of mass media and economic aristocracy (Wardrip-Fruin, 479).\n\nIn 1993, 90% of media was owned by 50 companies. Today, starting in 2011,the same 90% is controlled by 6 companies. These 6 companies include Comcast, News-Corp, Disney, Viacom, Time Warner, and CBS. These 6 media companies are broken down into sub companies, for example, News-Corp is broken down into Fox, Wall Street Journal, and New York Post. Disney is broken down into ABC, ESPN, Pixar, Miramar, and Marvel Studios. Viacom is broken down into MTV, Nick Jr, BET, CMT, and Paramount Pictures. Time Warner cable is broken down into CNN, HBO, Time, and Warner Bros. Lastly, CBS is broken down into Showtime, Smithsonian channel, NFL.com, Jeopardy, and 60 minutes. 232 media executives control what media 277 million Americans consume. To put that into perspective, thats 1 media executive to 850,000 media consumers. These six big companies control 70% of cable and can make up to 275.9 billion revenue (2010 revenue for the big six). The media we receive by these 6 companies include movies which in 2010, their box office sales hit 7 billion, which is double what 140 smaller movie studios made.\n\nSeveral issues arise from the fusion; under law and business ethics, the director of a firm is obligated to act in best interest of the company he or she is involved in, and failure to oblige under some circumstances can be a federal crime. This creates a dilemma in the governance of mass media: the same person may be trapped in a situation where working for the best interest for one may damage the other corporation. Another problem which arises is that the same person can abuse his or her power to get away with injustice as exemplified by Bagdikian: \"When Sears was accused by the Federal Trade Commission of dishonest advertising and promotion, the Tribune was one of the major papers that failed to carry a word of it... (Wardrip-Fruin, 481).\" Here, a market industry was able to conceal their crime of fraud since it was also interlocked with the news media, one of the main distributors of such significant information.\n\nIn summary, the concentration of massive media firms that control American public information is troublesome for the potential for deception misleads the public away from reality. The Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs state that these facts raise fundamental issues as they can bear on social issues and possibly control the shape and direction of the nation's economy. It is further derived that \"the summits of American business now control or powerfully influence the major media that create American public opinion\" (Wardrip-Fruin, 483).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "58048237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58048237", "title": "Feminist poetry", "text": "Feminist poetry\n\nFeminist poetry is inspired by, promotes, or elaborates on feminist principles and ideas. It might be written with the conscious aim of expressing feminist principles, although sometimes it is identified as feminist by critics in a later era. Some writers are thought to express feminist ideas even if the writer was not an active member of the political movement during their era. Many feminist movements, however, have embraced poetry as a vehicle for communicating with public audiences through anthologies, poetry collections, and public readings.\n\nFormally, feminist poetry often seeks to challenge assumptions about language and meaning. It usually foregrounds women's experiences as valid and worthy of attention, and it also highlights the lived experiences of minorities and other less privileged subjects. Sometimes feminist poems seek to embody specific women's experiences, and they are often intersectional registering specific forms of oppression depending on identities related to race, sexuality, gender presentation, disability, or immigration status. This has led to feminist writing journals like So To Speak providing a statement of intention to publish the work of women and nonbinary people in particular.\n\nKim Whitehead states that feminist poetry has \"no identifiable birth date,\" but there are a few key figures identified as early proponents of feminist ideas, and who convey their politics through poetry. The title of first feminist poet is often given to Sappho, at least in part because she seems to write about female homosexuality in Ancient Greece, a culture and time when lesbian sexuality was usually ignored or erased.\n\nThe beginning of works categorised as literature in India began with the Sanskrit term \"kāvya\", a discourse separate from science or from the purely oral, and specific literary style that included works thought to contain a kind of soulfulness. In this early period, men were often posed as poets, and women as a kind of muse, as in the tenth century explanation for the origins of Indian literary culture: Poem Man's wife (\"Poetics\") chases him across South Asia creating varying kinds of literature across the region. Poetry was certainly an important part of political cultural life in the Sanskrit cosmopolis, and some women contributed; for example the poet Rajasekhara tells of women in different regions who entertain with songs.\n\nThe early civilisation of Khmer country in modern-day Cambodia cultivated a literature in Sanskrit, and diverged from its neighbours in creating a strain of poetry from the fifth century to the thirteenth century in which women were a source of praise and admiration. Take for example the Mebon Inscription of Rājendravarman, which features eulogies for specific women of note, and which is, according to Sheldon I. Pollock, \"without obvious parallel in South Asia,\" and may be related to \"specific kinship structures in the region.\"\n\nEarly anglophone women poets in India blended native traditions and literary models from Europe. Amongst these early feminists, the Dutt Sisters - Toru Dutt (1856-1877) and Aru Dutt (1854-1874) stand out, and are sometimes compared to the Brontë Sisters in England. The Dutt sisters came from a family of poets, including their father Govind Chandra Dutt, and their access to education was unprecedented. The mother of the family Kshetramoni Mitter Dutt along with all three children - Toru, Aru, and their brother Abju Dutt, had received an education in English, and to some extent, in the Bengali language. The family had a reformist bent, and some members had converted to Christianity. Both sisters visited England in the 1870s, and attended the higher lectures for women at Cambridge University. Toru Dutt's poetry in particular has been labelled extraordinary, because her writing \"created a new idiom in Indian English verse.\"\n\nSpanning the turn from the nineteenth to twentieth century, Sarojini Naidu (1879–1949) represents a figure for whom politics and poetry are intertwined. Like the Dutt Sisters, Naidu was allowed access to all the educational resources she desired, and she passed the Madras University matriculation examination at age 12. She came from a large and free-thinking family. Her father, Aghorenath Chattopadhyay, was a well-regarded doctor, known for his educational reforms, and her mother, Barada Sundari Devi, was educated at a Brahmo school. Naidu had seven siblings all of whom made contribution to Indian life, for example her brother Virendranath Chattopadhyay was an Indian revolutionary. Naidu studied at Girton College, Cambridge, which brough her into contact with writers of the day, including Arthur Symons, and W.B. Yeats. Ultimately, Naidu's unconventional upbringing and education were catalysts for her intellectual powers, since as she writes in her roman-de-clef 'Sulani,' \"\"Unlike the girls of her own nation, she had been brought up in an atmosphere of large un-convention and culture and absolute freedom of thought and action.\" After her marriage to Govindarajulu Naidu - controversial because of his age and class - Naidu began publishing poetry to international acclaim, and in parallel with this literary art, she maintained her nationalist efforts, eventually becoming the first Indian woman to serve as president of the Indian National Congress.\n\nAnthologies were an important part of foregrounding women's writing in volumes like Eunice De Souza's \"Nine Indian Women Poets\" (1997).\n\nThe Feminist Legacy of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz\n\nDuring the Latin American colonial period, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz (est 1651-1695) was a poet, dramatist, and nun. Exceptionally talented and intelligent, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz chose to spend most of her life in the Convent of the Order of St. Jérôme, and her response to a critical Bishop, \"Respuesta a Sor Filotea,\" is hailed as one of the first feminist manifestos. Not only did Sor Juana have to deal with the criticisms of men of her era, but she also faced the Spanish perception of literature from the colonies as second-rate. Sor Juana's poems challenge the assumptions of men about women, for example in 'You Foolish Men.'\n\nWhat kind of mind is odder\n\nthan his who mists\n\na mirror and then complains\n\nthat it's not clear.The fact that she chooses to avoid a heteronormative life with marriage and children is often held up as a feminist choice, and she represents the possibility to be a woman who 'pursues knowledge and procreates only through art and not through a genetic legacy.'\n\nAnthologies of women's writing in the 1980s foregrounded the importance of women poets in the Caribbean, for example in M.J. Fenwick's \"Sisters of Caliban\" (1996) described as \"a gendered and racialized position of resistance\".\n\nThough they lived in an era before an organised feminist movement, certain American poets have been lauded by feminist literary criticism as early examples of feminist writers. Feminist poetry in the United States is often thought of as beginning with Anne Bradstreet (1612-1672), the first poet of the New World. There were also, however, native poetic traditions before colonialism, which continue to the present day, and represent an important strand of American poetry. Native traditional verse has included \"lyrics, chants, anecdotes, incantations, riddles, proverbs, and legends.\" While it is difficult to ascertain from these oral traditions whether the authors of early texts were male or female, precolonial native poetry certainly addresses issues relevant to women in a sensitive and positive way, for example the Seminole poem, 'Song for Bringing a Child Into the World.' In fact, native poetry is a separate but relevant tradition in the United States; as poet Joy Harjo comments, \"The literature of the aboriginal people of North America defines America. It is not exotic.\" In the context of Canada, Anne Marie Dalton argues that at least some indigenous communities in North America (though not all) have lived by practicing ecofeminism with regard to women's roles, and the sustainability of the land.\n\nWhen colonialism did arrive, Anne Bradstreet was one of the first poets to win acclaim, and many of her poems are thought to have feminist themes. The mother of eight children, Bradstreet sometimes found herself in conflict with her domestic circumstances and her role as a Puritan woman. Feminist literary criticism defined Bradstreet in retrospect as a \"protofeminist,\" because of her \"gender awareness,\" and her treatment of domestic concerns of importance in women's lives. Poet Alicia Ostriker describes Bradstreet's style as \"a combination of rebellion and submission,\" a pattern that Ostriker also sees in poets to come like Phyllis Wheatley and Emily Dickinson.\n\nPhyllis Wheatley (1753-1784) was brought to the United States from Africa as a slave, and sold to the Wheatley family of Boston in 1771. A prodigy as a child, Wheatley was the first black person to publish a book of poems in the American colony, and though her poems are sometimes thought of as expressing \"meek submission,\" she is also what Camille Dungy describes as \"a foremother,\" and a role model for black women poets as \"part of the fabric\" of American poetry. Involved in the abolitionist movement, Wheatley became \"a spokeswoman for the cause of American independence and the abolition of slavery.\"\n\nNineteenth century poet Emily Dickinson (1830-1886) is often thought of as feminist, though she never wrote for public audiences. Not necessarily recognized in her own lifetime, Dickinson offers powerful female speakers. Engaging with male writers like Ralph Waldo Emerson or William Wordsworth, her work is praised for developing \"others ways of representing the position of a female speaking subject\" in particular romantic and psychological dynamics. See for example the declaration of desire and longing in 'Wild nights - Wild nights!.' In the 1970s, feminist literary criticism articulated Dickinson's feminism through groundbreaking studies by Margaret Homans, Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar, and Suzanne Juhasz. Critics point in particular to Dickinson's expression of anger at women's confinement, to her re-gendering of external and internal realities, to her use of feminist motifs, and to her articulation of her particular position in Puritan, patriarchal culture. Dickinson also proves that confinement to domestic life does not dictate an inability to create great poetry. As the poet Adrienne Rich writes, \"Probably no poet ever lived so much and so purposefully in one house; even, in one room.\"\n\nFeminist poets of the early twentieth century harnessed the new opportunities and rights which came as a result of coeducational resources now afforded to women. Cristianne Miller goes so far as to say that 'In no period before and rarely since have women poets had greater success and influence than in the first half of the twentieth century in the United States.'\n\nLiving through the turn of the century was Alice Moore Dunbar-Nelson(1875-1935), a poet often thought of in relation to her marriage to Paul Dunbar. Dunbar-Nelson, however, is an accomplished writer in her own right, praised by poet Camille Dungy for breaking out of writing only about \"black women's things,\" instead addressing \"the theater and war of life.\" Born in New Orleans, Dubar-Nelson's family had a heritage of African American, Anglo, Native American, and Creole roots. Camille Dungy suggests that bringing black women writers like Dunbar-Nelson into the feminist canon alongside Bradstreet and Dickinson is of great importance in rediscovering literary foremothers for black women writers.\n\nThe early twentieth century was also a significant moment for feminism, because it saw the rise of the suffragist movement, and poets responded to the political moment by writing poems regarding the debate as to whether or not women should have the right to vote. In her collection \"Suffrage Songs and Verses,\" Charlotte Perkins Gilman criticises wealthy women, who because they live a life of ease, deny other women their rights. Alice Duer Miller (1874-1942) wrote poems mocking anti-suffragist advocates, which were published in the New York Tribune, a popular news outlet of the era.\n\nWhile some poets have been embraced by the feminist canon, others are seen as awkward additions in spite of their success, for example Gertrude Stein (1874-1946) is often defined more as a poet involved in modernist experimentation than feminist discourse. Some of modernism's tenets seem incompatible with some kinds of feminism, like the repression of emotion, and avoidance of domesticity. Nevertheless, second wave feminists found modernist women poets like H.D. (1886-1961) to be a powerful example, unfairly overlooked by male critics.\n\nBy the time of the 1940s, magazines were being set up which, though perhaps not obviously feminist, certainly in their practices were very different to male-run publications: take for example Contemporary Verse (1941–52) published in Canada by a group of women writers, including Dorothy Livesay, P.K. Page, and Anne Marriott.\n\nHistorian Ruth Rosen describes the mainstream poetry world before 1960 as \"an all boy's club,\" adding that poetry was not \"women's place,\" and explains that in order to get a poetry book published, writers would have to overcome their gender and race. The interest of American feminist poets in the rights of minorities have often put them in conflict with American institutions like the American Academy of Poets. One of the strategies of feminist poets is to demonstrate \"their opposition to a dominant poetry culture that does not recognize the primacy of gender and other oppressions\".\n\n1960s feminist poetry provided a useful space for second wave American feminist politics. The poets, however, were not necessarily unified in their themes or formal techniques, but had links to specific movements and trends, such as the New York Poets, the Black Mountain poets, the San Francisco Renaissance, or the Beat Poets. Denise Levertov (1923-1997), for example, refined and built upon poetics from the Black Mountain School.\n\nWomen like Sylvia Plath (1932-1963) and Anne Sexton (1928-1974) provided a feminist version of the Confessional Poets' poetics, which worked alongside feminist texts of the day, like Betty Friedan's \"The Feminine Mystique\", to \"address taboo subjects and social limitations that plagued American women\" (although Plath died before \"The Feminine Mystique\" was published) Lucille Clifton (1936-2010) also borrowed from Confessional poetics, a strategy that was key according to Adrienne Rich for avoiding being trapped between \"misogynist black male critics and white feminists still struggling to unearth a white woman's tradition.\" Confessionalism lent to feminist poetry the possibility of agency for the female speaker, and the refusal to present well-behaved women, though it was troubling that the Confessional women poets who committed suicide tended to be foregrounded and promoted in poetry circles.\n\nMuriel Rukeyser (1913-1980) was a generation older than Plath and Sexton, and rejected the suicidal poetics of the Confessional writers. Rukeyser also wrote frankly about the body and sexuality, inspiring later poets like Sharon Olds. In addition, Rukeyser's leftist politics and militant writing style proved to be a model for poet Adrienne Rich. Both poets also contributed to the anti-Vietnam War movement: for example Rukeyser and Rich took part in readings as part of the event series, the Week of the Angry Arts Against the War in Vietnam.\n\nAdrienne Rich (1929-2012) also became a key feminist poet, praised by Alicia Ostriker for bringing \"intellect\" to poetry, \"something that women were not supposed to have,\" as well as \"a leftward leaning sensibility in which coming out as lesbian was just one part.\" Rich's 'Diving into the Wreck' is an important feminist poem, as it describes moving down as an act of triumph, where the wreck might be history, literature, or human life, and the poem itself is a kind of \"battlecry.\" Famously, when Rich received the National Book Award for her collection, \"Diving into the Wreck,\" she accepted it on behalf of all the female nominees, including Audre Lorde and Alice Walker:We, Audre Lorde, Adrienne Rich, and Alice Walker, together accept this award in the name of all the women whose voices have gone and still go unheard in a patriarchal world, and in the name of those who, like us, have been tolerated as token women in this culture, often at great cost and in great pain. We believe that we can enrich ourselves more in supporting and giving to each other than by competing against each other; and that poetry— if it is poetry— exists in a realm beyond ranking and comparison. We symbolically join together here in refusing the terms of patriarchal competition and declaring that we will share this prize among us, to be used as best we can for women.Audre Lorde (1934-1992) was a feminist poet whose poetry and prose writings have had a great impact on feminist thinking to the present day. Sometimes thought of as a writer who developed a \"black lesbian eroticism,\" Lorde's poetry also shows a deep ethical and moral commitment, which seeks to challenge racism, sexism, and homophobia. Many of Lorde's poems have a great deal in common with the modern-day campaign #blacklivesmatter, as they pose questions about institutionalised racism in American public services like the price force, for example in her poem 'Power':A policeman who shot down a ten year old in Queens\n\nstood over the boy with his cop shoes in childish blood\n\nand a voice said \"Die you little motherfucker\" and\n\nthere are tapes to prove it. At his trial\n\nthis policeman said in his own defense\n\n\"I didn't notice the size nor nothing else\n\nonly the color\". And\n\nthere are tapes to prove that, too.Lorde's work has also proved to be an inspiration to feminists working on the subject of feminist killjoys, and the trope of the angry black woman, often used as an excuse to belittle or reduce the impact of just concerns about racism. Lorde's poems often draw attention to the universalising tendencies of some white feminisms, so in a poem about a mythical woman, 'A Woman Speaks,' only at the end does Lorde draw attention to the problematic universal, white woman, adding\n\nI am\n\nwoman\n\nand not white.Lorde went on to be an effective and challenging teacher of other women poets, such as Donna Masini.\n\nIn the 1970s and 80s, feminist poetry evolved alongside the feminist movement, becoming a useful tool for activist groups organised around radical feminism, socialist feminism, and lesbian feminism. Poetry readings became spaces for feminists to come together in cities and in rural communities, and talk about sexuality, women's roles, and the possibilities beyond heteronormative life. Figures like Judy Grahn were figureheads for the women's movement, providing electrifying readings that enlivened and inspired audiences. Often the poems were political, and sometimes the writers tried to use language that \"ordinary women\" could read and understand.\n\nCountering tokenism was also an important aspect of the feminist poetry project. Carolyn Forché describes the \"blue velvet chair\" effect, inspired by group portraits of canonical poets, in which one - but only one - woman writer was allowed to join the men, often sat in a Victorian blue velvet chair.\n\nAs poetry took on a new significance for the feminist movement, so a number of new poetry anthologies were published which emphasised women's voices and experiences. Anthologies played an important role generally in opening up the political consciousness of poetry, an important example being Raymond Souster's volume, \"New Wave Canada: The Explosion in Canadian Poetry\" (1966).Louis Dudek and Michael Gnarowski describe the anthology's embracing of counterculture, including new ideas about sexuality and the role of women.\n\nOther anthologies began to focus specifically on women's writing, such as:\n\n\nOther anthologies created new canons of women's writing from the past, such as \"Black sister: poetry by black American women, 1746-1980\" (1981) edited by Erlene Stetson; or \"Writing Red: An Anthology of American Women Writers, 1930-1940\" (1987) edited by Paula Rabinowitz and Charlotte Nekola. Such anthologies \"established solid ground for the communication and circulation of feminist ideas\" in the American and Canadian Academies.\n\nConferences also provided important spaces for feminists to share and discuss ideas about the possibilities of poetry: for example a key moment for Canadian feminist poetry was the \"Women and words / Les femmes et les motes\" conference in 1983. The Vancouver convention brought together women writers, publishers, and booksellers to discuss the issues of the Canadian literary world, including gender inequity.\n\nOne change in the writing of women poets after the 1960s and 1970s was the possibility of writing about women's lives and experiences. To give authority to women's voices, writers like Honor Moore and Judy Graun held workshops specifically for women in order to overcome women's inner critics exacerbated by sexism. These networks of mentorship sprang up in feminist communities, and in universities.\n\nThe work at this time was focussing on \"images of women,\" and this often meant broadening representations. This methodology eventually began to be criticised, however, because it failed to recognise the complications of violence embedded in the very structure of language. Writers influenced by the avant-garde and by L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry sought to challenge the idea of language's neutrality. US feminist language poets like Lynn Hejinian or Susan Howe, or Canadian writers like Daphne Marlatt looked back to the legacy of experimentalist modernists like Gertrude Stein, or Mina Loy, and also to diverse sources of inspiration like Denise Levertov, Marguerite Duras, Virginia Woolf, Nicole Brossard, Phyllis Webb, Louky Bersianik, and Julia Kristeva. They also reframed the language poetics from male mentors like Charles Olson, Robert Creeley, Gary Snyder, or Allen Ginsberg.\n\nPoets also sought to intervene in spheres traditionally dominated by men. Take for example Eileen Myles' intervention into politics in her 1992 \"Write-in Campaign for President.\"\n\nBy the time of the 1990s, and the rise of intersectionality as a key feminist term, many feminist poets resisted the term \"woman poet,\" because it suggested \"too confining a collective identity.\" They also sought to undermine \"the assumption that has sometimes structured feminist political organizing and even feminist literary publishing and criticism—that gender can be separated from race, ethnicity, class, and sexuality, and that white middleclass women first and foremost have the tools and the knowhow for the enterprise of analyzing gendered experience and literary production.\"\n\nPresent day feminist poetry in North America holds space for a great variety of poets tackling identity, sexuality, and gender issues. Key writings in the recent past include Claudia Rankine's careful skewering of race related microaggressions in \"Citizen,\" Dorothea Laskey's \"ferocious confession\" in Rome for example, and Bhanu Kapil's challenge the violent inherent in structures of language and institutions.\n\nEighteenth century advocate for women's rights Mary Wollstonecraft (1797-1851), put great emphasis on the power of the poetic imagination as a liberator tool, and many nineteenth century British women writers were inspired by Wollstonecraft to use poetry to enter public debates about gender roles, poverty, and slavery. The verse-novel \"Aurora Leigh\" (1856) by Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1806-1861) is one such feminist work, which challenged a prevailing attitude that women's lives were incompatible with writing poetry. \"Aurora Leigh\" had a very public impact, for example influencing the views of American social reformer Susan B. Anthony regarding the traditional roles of women, especially in relation to the tension between marriage and women's individuality.\n\nOften cited as an early feminist poet, Amy Levy (1861-1889) is described by writer Elaine Feinstein as the first modern Jewish woman poet. At the age of 13, Levy published her first poem in the feminist journal, the \"Pelican\", and she grew to maturity surrounded by writers and social reformers on the London scene of the era, such as Eleanor Marx and Olive Schreiber. Though nothing is known for sure about Levy's sexual relationships, she is often thought of as a lesbian poet, though some critics have challenged affixing a sexual category to Levy. Levy's poems, however, are an early example of poetry that challenges heteronormative roles.\n\nLevy is often thought of as prefiguring or representing an early version of the New Woman, a stereotypical image of an independent woman who often worked rather than relying on her menfolk, and was associated with gender bending and deviance. Historically, the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century was an era of surplus women, who had to work to survive: by 1911, 77 per cent of women workers in the UK were single. Alongside the struggle of suffragettes campaigning for votes for women, many British feminist poets sought to emulate the example of Victorian women writers, often expressing their radical political beliefs through poetry. Often the writers were not professional poets, but wrote out of necessity, including satirical portraits of politicians, or writings from prison, as in \"Holloway Jingles\", a collection of writing from imprisoned women collated by the Glasgow Branch of the Women's Social and Political Union.\n\nIn the inter-war years, British women poets associated with modernism began to find themselves public figures, though their feminist ideas sometimes came into conflict with the literary establishment which remained a kind of \"exclusive male club.\" Often these writers are difficult to categorize in relation to literary groups traditionally used, like the avant-garde or modernists. This was also a period when American women poets living in Britain made an important contribution to the writing of the day: writers like H.D., Mina Loy, and Amy Lowell all combined radical poetic content with experimentation of form, allowing them to explore feminist polemic and non-heteronormative sexualities in innovative new modes. Other British feminist poets of the time like Anna Wickham, Charlotte Mew, and Sylvia Townsend Warner, receive less critical attention, but also sought to challenge and reevaluate tropes of femininity.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the Women's Liberation Movement in the UK had a great influence on the literary world. Feminist publishers, Virago (founded in 1973), Onlywomen (1974), The Women's Press (1978), and Sheba (1980), were established, alongside magazines like Spare Rib. Like their counterparts in the US, British feminist editors in the 1970s and 80s created landmark anthologies of women's poetry, which foregrounded the variety and strength of women's writing. These included Lilian Mohin's \"One Foot on the Mountain\" (1979), Jeni Couzyn's \"The Bloodaxe Book of Contemporary Women Poets\" (1985), Moira Ferguson's \"First Feminists: British Women Writers 1578-1799\" (1985), Kate Armstrong's \"Fresh Oceans\" (1989), Jude Brigley's \"Exchanges\" (1990), and Catherine Kerrigan's \"An Anthology of Scottish Women Poets\" (1991).\n\nReferences\n"}

Jericho, Papoose, Omar Epps, Big Daddy Kane, Curbside Hustle, Big Daddy Kane, G. Martin, Memphis Bleek, Lil Bibby, Kool G Rap and Bryonn Bain. The album was supported by the singles \"Best Mistake\", \"Sinner's Prayer\" and \"Nunya\".\n\nOn December 9, 2013, the album's first single \"Best Mistake\" featuring G. Martin was released. On January 21, 2014, the music video was released for \"Best Mistake\" featuring G. Martin. On July 29, 2014, the album's second single \"Sinner's Prayer\" featuring Papoose and Omar Epps was released. On August 4, 2014, the music video was released for \"Sinner's Prayer\" featuring Papoose and Omar Epps. On August 19, 2014, the album's third single \"Nunya\" was released. On September 28, 2014, the music video was released for \"Nunya\".\n\n\"G.S.N.T. 3: The Troubled Times of Brian Carenard\" received mixed reviews from music critics. Brandon Matthews of \"XXL\" gave the album an L, saying \"True hip-hop fans will appreciate his new body of work as it counteracts the contemporary formula of heavy bass driven tracks that seem to have saturated radio. His features solidify his reputable status by having tracks with legends such as Big Daddy Kane, Kool G Rap, Papoose and even features Omar Epps (whom can actually rap!). He also grabs 2014 XXL Freshman Lil Bibby and fellow New York lyricist Memphis Bleek, who both shine on “Mechanical Animals (4 generations).” His beat selection identifies his desire to be a staple in the industry as opposed to a novelty, tapping the services of DJ Premier and Clev Trev.\" Jay Balfour of HipHopDX gave the album three out of five stars, saying \"While he’s developed himself into a recognizable Hip Hop pundit outside of his music, Saigon has struggled to maintain his voice inside of it. There’s consolation in the fact that he’s still a talented emcee, but he’s tried too much while staying safe at the same time. Saigon fans will find plenty to pick through on \"GSNT3\" but they may be the most alienated listeners as well, more aware than anyone that he is capable of better.\"\n"}

{"id": "100065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=100065", "title": "Gossip columnist", "text": "Gossip columnist\n\nA gossip columnist is someone who writes a gossip column in a newspaper or magazine, especially a gossip magazine. Gossip columns are material written in a light, informal style, which relates the gossip columnist's opinions about the personal lives or conduct of celebrities from show business (motion picture movie stars, theater, and television actors), politicians, professional sports stars, and other wealthy people or public figures. Some gossip columnists broadcast segments on radio and television.\n\nThe columns mix factual material on arrests, divorces, marriages and pregnancies, obtained from official records, with more speculative gossip stories, rumors, and innuendo about romantic relationships, affairs, and purported personal problems.\n\nGossip columnists have a reciprocal relationship with the celebrities whose private lives are splashed about in the gossip column's pages. While gossip columnists sometimes engage in (borderline) defamatory conduct, spreading innuendo about alleged immoral or illegal conduct that can injure celebrities' reputations, they also are an important part of the \"Star System\" publicity machine that turns movie actors and musicians into celebrities and superstars that are the objects of the public's obsessive attention and interest. The publicity agents of celebrities often provide or \"leak\" information or rumors to gossip columnists to publicize the celebrity or their projects, or to counteract \"bad press\" that has recently surfaced about their conduct.\n\nWhile gossip columnists’ \"bread and butter\" is rumor, innuendo, and allegations of scandalous behavior, there is a fine line between legally acceptable spreading of rumor and the making of defamatory statements, which can provoke a lawsuit. Newspaper and magazine editorial policies normally require gossip columnists to have a source for all of their allegations, to protect the publisher against lawsuits for defamation (libel).\n\nIn the United States, celebrities or public figures can sue for libel if their private lives are revealed in gossip columns and they believe that their reputation has been defamed — that is, exposed to hatred, contempt, ridicule, or pecuniary loss. Gossip columnists cannot defend against libel claims by arguing that they merely repeated, but did not originate the defaming rumor or claim; instead, a columnist must prove that the allegedly defaming statement was truthful, or that it was based on a reasonably reliable source.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, rulings by the United States Supreme Court made it harder for the media to be sued for libel in the U.S. The court ruled that libel only occurred in cases where a publication printed falsehoods about a celebrity with “reckless disregard” for the truth. A celebrity suing a newspaper for libel must now prove that the paper published the falsehood with actual malice, or with deliberate knowledge that the statement was both incorrect and defamatory.\n\nMoreover, the court ruled that only factual misrepresentation is libel, not expression of opinion. Thus if a gossip columnist writes that they “...think that Celebrity X is an idiot,” the columnist does not face a risk of being sued for libel. On the other hand, if the columnist invents an allegation that “...Celebrity X is a wife beater,” with no supporting source or evidence, the celebrity can sue for libel on the grounds that their reputation was defamed.\n\nThere is however circumstances where gossip columnist may not be fact checking the information they are receiving from their sources before publishing their stories. Not to mention that there are gossip columnist that are not reputable themselves to be posting articles about celebrities. As a result of this there is a chance that there are stories that have been publish that could lead to the defamation of celebrities.\n\nThe first gossip columnist, dominating the 1930s and 40s, was Walter Winchell, who used political, entertainment, and social connections to mine information and rumors, which he then either published in his column \"On Broadway\", or used for trade or blackmail, to accumulate more power. He became \"the most feared journalist\" of his era.\n\nIn Hollywood's \"golden age\" in the 1930s and 1940s, gossip columnists were courted by the movie studios, so that the studios could use gossip columns as a powerful publicity tool. During this period, the major film studios had \"stables\" of contractually obligated actors, and the studios controlled nearly all aspects of the lives of their movie stars. From the 1930s through the 1950s, the two best-known - and competing - Hollywood gossip columnists were Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons.\n\nWell-timed leaks about a star's purported romantic adventures helped the studios to create and sustain the public's interest in the studios' star actors. As well, the movie studios' publicity agents acted as unnamed \"well-informed inside sources\" who provided misinformation and rumors to counteract whispers about celebrity secrets — such as homosexuality or an out-of-wedlock child — that could have severely damaged not only the reputation of the movie star in question, but the movie star's box office viability.\n\nHaving fallen into ill-repute after the heyday of Hopper and Parsons, gossip columnists saw a comeback in the 1980s. Today, many mainstream magazines such as \"Time\" which would once have considered the idea of hiring gossip columnists to pen articles to have been beneath their stature, have sections titled \"People\" or \"Entertainment\". These mainstream gossip columns provide a light, chatty glimpse into the private lives and misadventures of the rich and famous. At the other end of the journalism spectrum, there are entire publications that deal primarily in gossip, rumor, and innuendo about celebrities, such as the 'red-top' tabloids in the UK and celebrity 'tell-all' magazines.\n\nNotable gossip columnists include:\nGossip columns that are not named after a specific columnist, along with the media source, include:\n\n\n"}

Often, hardcore beats are used while the artist raps in Haitian Creole. Rap kreyòl has been part of Haitian culture since the early 1980s with groups such as Original Rap Staff, King Posee, Rap Kreyòl S.A., Masters of Haiti, Fighters, Blackdo, Fam-Squad, Supa Deno, Prince Berlin and Muzion attaining prominence, but lately has become very popular with Haitian youth. Another notable group from the 1990s is Black Leaders. The impact of Black Leaders and its members is lasting. Though known primarily for his role in Black Leaders, Don Roy is still an active contributor to Haitian music across many genres. Since the peak of his notoriety, Don Roy has chosen to create in other genres. While still working in a production capacity in genres such as Rap Kreyòl and Reggae, Don Roy has chosen to create and work with prominent artists of the modern roots/Rasin movement.\n\nMany Haitian rap artists have had rough childhoods and difficult living conditions producing rappers who address socio-economic topics in their lyrics. Though similar to mainstream American hip hop in that materialistic imagery is portrayed or lyricized, the negative aspects of less fortunate Haitian society, such as topics concerning slum life, gang warfare, the drug trade, and poverty, are much more common.\n\nThe most well-known exports of Haitian hip hop are two members of the legendary Grammy Award-winning hip hop group, the Fugees, Wyclef Jean and his cousin Pras Michel. Most recently, Christopher \"Freedom\" Laroche released his inspirational debut album \"Liberation 1804\", Kerns (Mr OK) Olirice released his first EP (Men Mwen) while acts like Barikad Crew, Rockfam, Brimad, Topson, Chale Republic, Pick Up Click, BriganDie, Team Lobey, Dezod Beats and G Bobby Bon Flo, Steves J. Bryan have gained popularity among the Haitian population. However, the godfather of hip hop in Haiti is the late Master Dji, who not only released the first Haitian rap song in the early 1980s, formed the group Rap Kreyòl S.A., but was also the first Haitian DJ and also influential in encouraging other young Haitians such as Supa Deno, DJ Fanfan and DJ Live to become rappers, DJs, and breakdancers.\n\n\n"}

In the late 1990s, Universal Parks and Resorts began discussing the possibility of purchasing the license for Harry Potter to create and theme amusement park rides. As Time Warner owns the license, a small walkthrough attraction was constructed at Warner Bros. Movie World called the Harry Potter Movie Magic Experience in 2001. This attraction was removed two years later. In 2010, Universal's Islands of Adventure park opened The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Similar attractions are destined for Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Japan.\n\nIn 2001, Time Warner used this license to construct and operate the Harry Potter Movie Magic Experience at Warner Bros. Movie World on the Gold Coast, Australia. The attraction was a small indoor walkthrough featuring many re-creations of locations in the first two movies. After two years of operation this attraction was removed.\n\nA \"Harry Potter\" themed attraction at a Universal Studios park or a Disney park was rumored in 2003. However, the rights to the Harry Potter franchise had been acquired by Warner Bros., who denied all rumors. In January 2007, About.com reported a rumor from a \"highly credible source\" that the Islands of Adventure park's Lost Continent area was going to be re-themed \"to the stories and characters of one of the most popular children's franchises\". Other sources followed up in the next few days with unofficial confirmation that the new area would involve \"Harry Potter\". On May 31, 2007, Universal, in partnership with Warner Bros., officially announced \"The Wizarding World of Harry Potter\" would be added to Islands of Adventure.\n\nConstruction of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter began seven months after the official announcement, in January 2008. By July, the Flying Unicorn and Enchanted Oak Tavern were closed. The Flying Unicorn then began an almost two year refurbishment which transformed it into the Flight of the Hippogriff. The Enchanted Oak Tavern was later demolished. A bridge was built to connect The Lost Continent with Jurassic Park allowing guests to avoid the construction zone that was to be the Wizarding World. Construction progressed with the Hogwarts castle slowly taking shape. By September 2008, the Dueling Dragons entrance was moved to Jurassic Park to make room for construction of Hogsmeade. One month later, the old entrance was demolished. By September 2009, the top shell of Hogwarts castle was completed. On September 15, an announcement was made as to what exactly was going to be included in the Wizarding World. In early 2010, Universal increased the marketing of the area which included newspaper advertisements, billboards and television commercials. The Dueling Dragons were closed for some maintenance before being transformed into the Dragon Challenge. Construction was complete by June 1, 2010 when the area began soft openings.\n\nA soft opening weekend was held for the media and reserved guests, starting on May 28, 2010. The park had two opening ceremonies that took place on June 16 and June 18, 2010. The first opening was reserved for the cast and crew of the \"Harry Potter\" films, J.K. Rowling (author of the novels), Universal Orlando Resort officials, as well as representatives from the media. The ceremony concluded with a fireworks display and a performance by the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra, led by John Williams (composer of the music for the first three films). On June 18, the second ceremony occurred which officially opened The Wizarding World of Harry Potter to the public. Universal Orlando representative Bill Davis introduced the area to the audience which included actors from the films including Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Michael Gambon, Warwick Davis, Tom Felton, Matthew Lewis, Bonnie Wright and James and Oliver Phelps. The NBC \"Today\" show and The Weather Channel broadcast segments live from the park.\n\nOn December 6, 2011, Universal Parks & Resorts announced an expansion plan for The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. The expansion has been described as \"significant\" by officials. Few other details have been released.\n\nOn December 1, 2011, the \"Wall Street Journal\" reported a rumour from \"people familiar with the matter\" that Universal Studios Hollywood was going to add their version of Islands of Adventure's Wizarding World of Harry Potter. The report also detailed the possibility that Universal Parks & Resorts would open additional Harry Potter-themed areas at Universal Studios Singapore and Universal Studios Japan as well as a location in Spain. This report was widely relayed by other media sources. On December 6, 2011, Universal officially announced plans to bring The Wizarding World of Harry Potter to Universal Studios Hollywood. A replica of Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey and Hogwarts will be constructed. On May 5, 2012, the Los Angeles Times reported that Universal Studios Japan would also be receiving a \"The Wizarding World of Harry Potter\" by 2014. Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey was also confirmed as one of the attractions.\n\nBelow is a list of all of the attractions at Harry Potter themed areas around the world.

The job of a home shopping host is to introduce new presenters and guests to the television audience, and help these guests explain the values and features of the product being showcased.\n\nBack in 1977, Clearwater, Florida radio station owner Lowell 'Bud' Paxson was collecting money from local companies that advertised on his station. One local company, a hardware store owner, refused payment, insisting that not one single customer had heard the broadcast of his radio advertisements. Paxson and the store owner argued back and forth, eventually coming to a compromise: Instead of a financial payment, the store owner gave Paxson a box filled with electric can openers. Paxson took the box, and returned to the radio station.\n\nWhen the station's talk radio host, Bob Circosta, was on a newsbreak, Paxson asked Circosta to sell these can openers to his audience. Circosta initially objected, but soon complied with his Paxson's wishes. \"I looked at him like he had three heads,\" Circosta said, recalling the moment. \"I thought it would be unethical because I was trying to be a serious host.\" When Circosta returned to the airwaves, he began describing the can openers and asking listeners to buy them.\n\nAll 112 can openers were purchased in under an hour.\n\nSensing the sales potential of live, on-air product selling, Lowell 'Bud' Paxson and financier Roy Speer co-founded a local cable TV channel (channel 52 on Vision Cable) in 1982 that sold products directly to Florida viewers, and then launched nationwide in 1985. The channel was the Home Shopping Club, later Home Shopping Network, and Paxson's former radio man Bob Circosta was tapped as the network's first-ever host. HSN soon became a billion dollar juggernaut and began the home shopping / electronic retailing industry. In 1996, the two sold HSN to Hollywood executive Barry Diller.\n\nIn addition to Bob Circosta, other early home shopping hosts were Alice Cleveland, Bobbi Ray Carter, Tina Berry, Dan Dennis, John Cremeans, Maven Huffman and Lisa Robertson.\n\nOn all the major television shopping channels, the home shopping host will stay on the air for one to three hours at a time, welcoming several new guests and demonstrating many new products. Since products and guests are often only given 10 or 15 minutes to sell their product in the world of home shopping, it's not uncommon for a host to be required to introduce 20 or more different products and inventions during their shift. Being quick-witted, personable, and likeable is essential for a host, as well as being able to make quick transitions from one product to another. Additionally, with networks like HSN and QVC routinely debuting brand new inventions and products, the host must also quickly articulate to the audience why the item is worth purchasing.\n\nAll the national American home shopping channels are broadcast live, 24 hours a day, so mistakes and errors cannot be edited out. This has led to some memorable on-air home shopping bloopers, such as a QVC demonstrator falling from a ladder and getting injured, or a Shop at Home host insisting that a moth in a photograph is actually a horse.\n\nMany of the guests who accompany the home shopping host on-air are not particularly TV-savvy or experienced, so the host must help guests better define the attributes and value of the items being showcased.\n\nBecause of the large influx of guests and products, hosts often lack the time to study the product beforehand, which increases the need for an effective host to possess sufficient verbal skills to mask this lack of direct product knowledge.\n\n"}

Brown\n\nJoseph Evans Brown (July 28, 1891 – July 6, 1973) was an American actor and comedian, remembered for his amiable screen persona, comic timing, and enormous elastic-mouth smile. He was one of the most popular American comedians in the 1930s and 1940s, with films like \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (1935), \"Earthworm Tractors\" (1936), and \"Alibi Ike\" (1935). In his later career Brown starred in \"Some Like It Hot\" (1959), as Osgood Fielding III, in which he utters the famous punchline, \"Well, nobody's perfect.\"\n\nBrown was born on July 28, 1891, in Holgate, Ohio, near Toledo, into a large family largely of Welsh descent. He spent most of his childhood in Toledo. In 1902, at the age of ten, he joined a troupe of circus tumblers known as the Five Marvelous Ashtons, who toured the country on both the circus and vaudeville circuits. Later he became a professional baseball player. Despite his skill, he declined an opportunity to sign with the New York Yankees to pursue his career as an entertainer. After three seasons he returned to the circus, then went into Vaudeville and finally starred on Broadway. He gradually added comedy to his act, and transformed himself into a comedian. He moved to Broadway in the 1920s, first appearing in the musical comedy \"Jim Jam Jems\".\n\nIn late 1928, Brown began making films, starting the next year with Warner Bros. He quickly became a favorite with child audiences, and shot to stardom after appearing in the first all-color all-talking musical comedy \"On with the Show\" (1929). He starred in a number of lavish Technicolor Warner Brothers musical comedies including: \"Sally\" (1929), \"Hold Everything\" (1930), \"Song of the West\" (1930), and \"Going Wild\" (1930). By 1931, Joe E. Brown had become such a star that his name was billed above the title in the films in which he appeared.\n\nHe appeared in \"Fireman, Save My Child\" (1932), a comedy in which he played a member of the St. Louis Cardinals, and in \"Elmer, the Great\" (1933) with Patricia Ellis and Claire Dodd and \"Alibi Ike\" (1935) with Olivia de Havilland, in both of which he portrayed ballplayers with the Chicago Cubs.\n\nIn 1933 he starred in \"Son of a Sailor\" with Jean Muir and Thelma Todd. In 1934, Brown starred in \"A Very Honorable Guy\" with Alice White and Robert Barrat, in \"The Circus Clown\" again with Patricia Ellis and with Dorothy Burgess, and with Maxine Doyle in \"Six-Day Bike Rider\".\n\nBrown was one of the few vaudeville comedians to appear in a Shakespeare film; he played Francis Flute in the Max Reinhardt/William Dieterle film version of Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (1935) and was highly praised for his performance. He starred in \"Polo Joe\" (1936) with Carol Hughes and Richard \"Skeets\" Gallagher, and in \"Sons o' Guns\". In 1933 and 1936, he became one of the top ten earners in films. He was sufficiently well known internationally by this point to be depicted in comic strips in the British comic \"Film Fun\" for twenty years from 1933.\n\nHe left Warner Brothers to work for producer David L. Loew, starring in \"When's Your Birthday?\" (1937). In 1938, he starred in \"The Gladiator\", a loose film adaptation of Philip Gordon Wylie's 1930 novel \"Gladiator\" that influenced the creation of \"Superman\". He gradually switched to making \"B\" pictures.\n\nIn 1939, Brown testified before the House Immigration Committee in support of a bill that would allow 20,000 German Jewish refugee children into the US. He later adopted two refugee children.\n\nDuring WWII, he spent a great deal of time entertaining troops, spending many nights working and meeting servicemen at the Hollywood Canteen. He wrote of his experiences entertaining the troops in his book \"Your Kids and Mine\".\n\nJoe E. Brown's other two sons were in the military service. In 1942 Brown's son, Captain Don E. Brown, was killed when his A-20 Havoc crashed near Palm Springs, California. At 50, Brown himself was too old to enlist, but he traveled thousands of miles at his own expense to entertain American troops. He was the first to do so, traveling to both the Caribbean and Alaska before Bob Hope had, and before the USO was organized.\n\n\"While big USO names like Bob Hope did not visit the Leyte, Philippine area my father was in (housing was not good), Leyte received any number of entertainers during the war. Dad said the entertainers were all just a bunch of nice people. One group in particular was the top actors from a very popular and large musical of the times. Dad and a few of his buddies would walk back to the tents that housed the USO performers and would visit with them. Mostly, the USO performers were curious about the events on the islands and how the men were handling things. One performer, a \"wonderful comedian\" named Joe E. Brown, would commandeer a military vehicle and be driven around the island. The entertainer would stop military pedestrians, \"ream\" them for some inconsequential matter, start laughing, then invite them into the cab so they could be driven to their destinations. Joe E. Brown was greatly appreciated.\" (Memories of Capt. Donald Courtright, told to his daughter Mary in 2011.)\n\nOn his return to the States, he brought sacks of letters, making sure they were delivered by the Post Office Department. He gave shows in all weather conditions, many in hospitals, sometimes doing his entire show for a single dying soldier. He would sign autographs for everyone. Brown was one of only two civilians to be awarded the Bronze Star in WWII.\n\nHis concern for the troops continued into the Korean War, as evidenced by a newsreel featuring his appeal for blood donations to aid the US and UN troops there that was featured in the season 4 episode of \"M*A*S*H\" titled \"Deluge\".\n\nIn 1948, he was awarded a Special Tony Award for his work in the touring company of \"Harvey\".\n\nHe had a cameo appearance in \"Around the World in 80 Days\" (1956), as the Fort Kearney stationmaster talking to Fogg (David Niven) and his entourage in a small town in Nebraska. In the similarly epic film \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" (1963), he cameoed as a union official giving a speech at a construction site in the climactic scene. On television, he was the mystery guest on \"What's My Line?\" during the January 11, 1953, episode.\n\nHis best known postwar role was that of aging millionaire Osgood Fielding III in Billy Wilder's 1959 comedy, \"Some Like It Hot\". Fielding falls for Daphne (Jerry), played by Jack Lemmon in drag; at the end of the film, Lemmon takes off his wig and reveals to Brown that he is a man, to which Brown responds; \"well, nobody's perfect\", one of the most celebrated punchlines in film history.\n\nAnother of his notable postwar roles was that of \"Cap'n Andy Hawkes\" in MGM's 1951 remake of \"Show Boat\", a role that he reprised onstage in the 1961 New York City Center revival of the musical and on tour. The musical film version included such prominent costars as Ava Gardner, Howard Keel, and Kathryn Grayson. Brown performed several dance routines in the film, and famed choreographer Gower Champion appeared along with first wife Marge. Brown's final film appearance was in \"The Comedy of Terrors\" (1964). Weeks earlier, he had appeared as Diamond \"Dimey\" Vine in an episode of Jack Palance's ABC circus drama \"The Greatest Show on Earth\".\n\nBrown was a sports enthusiast, both in film and personally. Some of his best films were the \"baseball trilogy\" which consisted of \"Fireman, Save My Child\" (1932), \"Elmer the Great\" (1933) and \"Alibi Ike\" (1935). He was also a television and radio broadcaster for the New York Yankees in 1953. His son, Joe L. Brown, inherited an interest in baseball, becoming the general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates for more than twenty years. Brown also spent Ty Cobb's last days with him before he died, discussing his life.\n\nBrown's sports enthusiasm also led to him becoming the first president of PONY Baseball and Softball (at the time named Pony League) when the organization was incorporated in 1953. He continued in the post until late 1964, when he retired. Later he traveled additional thousands of miles telling the story of PONY League, hoping to interest adults in organizing baseball programs for young people. He was also a fan of Thoroughbred horse racing, a regular at Del Mar Racetrack and the races at Santa Anita.\n\nHe was caricatured in the Disney cartoons \"Mickey's Gala Premiere\" (1933), \"Mother Goose Goes Hollywood\" (1938), and \"The Autograph Hound\" (1939); all of them contain a scene in which he is seen laughing so loud that his mouth opens extremely wide. According to the official autobiography \"Daws Butler: Characters Actor\", Daws Butler used Joe E. Brown as inspiration for the voices of two Hanna-Barbera cartoon characters: Lippy the Lion (1962) and Peter Potamus (19631966).\n\nBrown married Kathryn Francis McGraw in 1915. The marriage would last until his death in 1973. The couple had four children: two sons, Don Evan Brown (December 25, 1916 October 8, 1942; Captain in the United States Army Air Force, who was killed in the crash of an A-20B Havoc bomber while serving as a ferry pilot) and Joe LeRoy \"Joe L.\" Brown (September 1, 1918 August 15, 2010), and two daughters, Mary Katherine Ann (b. 1930) and Kathryn Francis (b. 1934). Both daughters were adopted as infants.\n\nJoe L.

The 42-issue best-selling series by Amar Chitra Katha, Mumbai was illustrated by Dilip Kadam. The team of script writers (who took turns to complete the 42 issues) included Kamala Chandrakant, TMP Nedungadi, Subba Rao, Yagya Sharma, Lopamudra, Mihir Lal Mitra, Sumona Roy, Mohan Swaminathan, Shubha Kandhekar and Margie Sastry.\n\nThe \"Mahabharata\" is often regarded as one of the most popular titles in the history of Amar Chitra Katha. It is also the longest series (42 issue run on an alternative title schedule; from 329-441 [1985-89] in over more than 1300 pages) to have been produced by the ACK. The series was originally planned for 60 albums, but it was later cut short to 42.\n\nAmar Chitra Katha had a strong commitment to the \"Mahabharata\" from the very beginning. Many of its titles were from based on particular events or characters from the \"Mahabharata\". In March 1985, the new project began, \"in response to a persistent demand from our readers for a comprehensive account of the epic.\" The ambitious series by Anant Pai was initially decided as a 60 volume project, with one issue in every fortnight. However, in 1988, Amar Chitra Katha issued only one issue a month, so that Mahabharata numbers came out only in every two months.\n\nThe \"Mahabharata\" comics was based on,\n\n\nThe comics does not include the \"Harivamsha\" (a supplement to the \"Mahabharata\"), the romance of Damayanti, the legend of Savitri and the abbreviated version of the Ramayana. It also omits the character Ugrasrava Sauti and the first issue (\"Veda Vyasa\") begins with sage Vyasa acquiring the elephant god Ganesha as his scribe and starting the dictation. It soon moves on to Vaisampayana narrating the epic to Janamejaya. This latter pair persist till the last panel of the series, appearing from time to time in panels colored differently.\n\nThe comics also included various footnotes explaining the meaning Sanskrit terms, and the few issues also consisted a pronunciation guide and glossary. Issues usually start with a page containing a summary of the last few issues, and in the backdrop illustrations of the Gita setting, with Arjuna kneeling before Krishna in the battlefield.\n\nAmar Chitra Katha series on \"Mahabarata\" (1985–89) coincided with Baldev Raj Chopra's famous television drama series \"Mahabharat\" (1988–90). Although, some fans took great pleasure in encountering Mahabharata in both mediums, the television series spelled big trouble for the comic book series. Amar Chitra Katha and the state-run Doordarshan television channel (DD National) competed for the same urban middle class audience.\n\nIt is widely accepted that visual and narrative \"homogenization\" occurs between the ACK'S \"Mahabharata\" and Baldev Raj Chopra's \"Mahabharat\". Television producers have repeatedly turned to the Amar Chitra Katha series as reference material for costume design, set production, and subject matter.\n\nThe advertisements of the comic series contained the exhortation \"Read it to enjoy your Sunday viewing [of the BR Chopra's \"Mahabharat\"]!\". It seems possible that the comic series was hastened to 42 issues from 60 to take advantage of the television series.\n\n\n"}

Muslim Youth Helpline has stated that it does not propagate any religious or political beliefs and seeks only to provide relief to and improve the social condition of vulnerable young people in the UK.\n\nMYH was founded in August 2001 by Mohammed Sadiq Mamdani, who at the time was 18, in response to the social problems endured by Muslim youth in the UK. It was at college that Mohammed first realised the extent of isolation that today's young Muslims experience; while problems such as drug misuse, depression and sexuality are issues common among many young people, he believed that young Muslims often need advice that takes into account broader religious and social contexts. \n\nBy 2004, MYH has expanded nationwide and is the only telephone helpline of its kind in the UK; it now also runs a befriending scheme through which volunteers meet up with young Muslims on a social basis or provide practical help such as accompanying them to job centres, or helping fill in application forms whenever friendly guidance is needed.\n\nIn 2004, MYH released a Prison Campaign on muslimyouth.net and was called ‘Behind Bars’. After the huge success of the initial campaign it was adopted by MYH as an annual campaign. In 2005 they launched its ‘Doing a Runner’ campaign to raise awareness within the community of the many young Muslims who run away from home, and may at various times in their life find themselves vulnerable, alone and homeless. The campaign concluded with ‘2 Dayz of Street Life’, an event involving members of the public who stayed in shelters and on the streets for two days to experience what a homeless person may go through. In February 2006 MYH was awarded with the CSV Award for the ‘Most Heart Warming Project’ of its kind.\n\nMamdani had also founded the organisation with an annual dinner, which takes place once a year in May.

{"id": "4229016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4229016", "title": "Nervous laughter", "text": "Nervous laughter\n\nNervous laughter is laughter evoked from an audience's expression of embarrassment, alarm, discomfort or confusion, rather than amusement. Nervous laughter is usually less robust in expression than \"a good belly laugh\", and may be combined with confused glances or awkward silence on the part of others in the audience. Nervous laughter is considered analogous to a courtesy laugh, which may be rendered by more of a conscious effort in an attempt to move a situation along more quickly, especially when the comedian is pausing for laughter.\n\nNervous laughter is a physical reaction to stress, tension, confusion, or anxiety. Neuroscientist Vilayanur S. Ramachandran states \"We have nervous laughter because we want to make ourselves think what horrible thing we encountered isn't really as horrible as it appears, something we want to believe.\" Those are the most embarrassing times, too, naturally.\nPsychologist and neuroscientist Robert Provine, from the University of Maryland, studied over 1,200 \"laughter episodes\" and determined that 80% of laughter isn't a response to an intentional joke. \n\nUnhealthy or \"nervous\" laughter comes from the throat. This nervous laughter is not true laughter, but an expression of tension and anxiety. Instead of relaxing a person, nervous laughter tightens them up even further. Much of this nervous laughter is produced in times of high emotional stress, especially during times where an individual is afraid they might harm another person in various ways, such as a person's feelings or even physically.\n\nPeople laugh when they need to project dignity and control during times of stress and anxiety. In these situations, people usually laugh in a subconscious attempt to reduce stress and calm down, however, it often works otherwise. Nervous laughter is often considered fake laughter and even heightens the awkwardness of the situation.\n\nPeople may laugh nervously when exposed to stress due to witnessing others' pain. For instance, in Stanley Milgram's obedience experiment, subjects (\"teachers\") were told to shock \"learners\" every time the learners answered a question incorrectly. Although the \"learners\" were not actually shocked, the subjects believed they were. As they were going through the study, many of the \"subjects showed signs of extreme tension and conflict\". Milgram observed some subjects laughing nervously when they heard the \"learners'\" false screams of pain. In \"A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness\", neuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran suggests that laughter is used as a defense mechanism used to guard against overwhelming anxiety. Laughter often diminishes the suffering associated with a traumatic event.\n\nIf the individual is shy or bashful and appears nervous when talking, they are likely to exhibit nervous laughter. Individuals who are shy and introverted who find themselves the center of conversational attention often become \"giddy\" with nervous laughter; this is a subconscious response caused by the brain over-thinking due to social anxiety or inexperience.\n"}

It was shortlisted for the 2005 Booker Prize (an award Ishiguro had previously won in 1989 for \"The Remains of the Day\"), for the 2006 Arthur C. Clarke Award and for the 2005 National Book Critics Circle Award. \"Time\" magazine named it the best novel of 2005 and included the novel in its \"TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005\". It also received an ALA Alex Award in 2006. A film adaptation directed by Mark Romanek was released in 2010; a Japanese television drama aired in 2016.\n\nKathy H. is a student at Hailsham, a boarding school in England, where the teachers are known as \"guardians\". The children are watched closely and they are often told about the importance of producing art and of being healthy (smoking is considered a taboo, almost on the level of a crime, and working in the vegetable garden is compulsory). The students' art is then displayed in an exhibition, and the best art is chosen by a woman known to the students as \"Madame\", who keeps their work in a \"gallery\". Kathy develops a close friendship with two other students, Ruth and Tommy. Kathy develops a fondness for Tommy, looking after him when he is bullied and having private talks with him. However, Tommy and Ruth form a relationship instead.\n\nIn an isolated incident, Miss Lucy, one of the guardians, tells the students that they are clones who were created to donate organs to others, and after their donations they will die young. Miss Lucy is removed from the school as a result of her disclosure, but the students passively accept their fate.\n\nRuth, Tommy and Kathy move to the \"Cottages\" when they are 16 years old. This is the first time they are allowed in the outside world, yet they keep to themselves most of the time. Ruth and Tommy are still together and Kathy has some sexual relationships with other men. Two older housemates, who had not been at Hailsham, tell Ruth that they have seen a \"possible\" for Ruth, an older woman who resembles Ruth and thus could be the woman from whom she was cloned. As a result, the five of them go on a trip to see her, but the two older students first want to discuss a rumour they have heard: that a couple can have their donations deferred if they can prove that they are truly in love. They believe that this privilege is for Hailsham students only and so wrongly expect that the others will know how to apply for it. They then find the possible, but the resemblance to Ruth is only superficial, causing Ruth to wonder angrily whether they were all cloned from \"human trash\".\n\nDuring the trip, Kathy and Tommy separate from the others and look for a copy of a music tape that Kathy had lost when at Hailsham. Tommy's recollection of the tape and desire to find it for her make clear the depth of his feelings for Kathy. They find the tape, and then Tommy shares with Kathy a theory that the reason Madame collected their art was to determine which couples were truly in love, citing a teacher who had said that their art revealed their souls. After the trip, Kathy and Tommy do not tell Ruth of the found tape, nor of Tommy's theory about the deferral.\n\nWhen Ruth finds out about the tape and Tommy's theory, she takes an opportunity to drive a wedge between Tommy and Kathy. Shortly afterwards she tells Kathy that, even if Ruth and Tommy were to split up, Tommy would never enter into a relationship with Kathy because of her sexual history. A few weeks later, Kathy applies to become a carer, meaning that she will not see Ruth or Tommy for about ten years.\n\nAfter that, Ruth's first donation goes badly and her health deteriorates. Kathy becomes Ruth's carer, and both are aware that Ruth's next donation will probably be her last. Ruth suggests that she and Kathy take a trip and bring Tommy with them. During the trip, Ruth expresses regret for keeping Kathy and Tommy apart. Attempting to make amends, Ruth hands them Madame's address, urging them to seek a deferral. Shortly afterwards, Ruth makes her second donation and completes, an implied euphemism for dying.\n\nKathy becomes Tommy's carer and they form a relationship. Encouraged by Ruth's last wishes, they go to Madame's house to see if they can defer Tommy's fourth donation, bringing Tommy's artwork with him to support their claim that they are truly in love. They find Madame at her house, and also meet Miss Emily, their former headmistress, who lives with her. The two women reveal that \"guardians\" tried to give the clones a humane education, in contrast to other institutions. The gallery was a place meant to convey to the outside world that the clones are in fact normal human beings with a soul and deserve better treatment. It is also revealed however that this experiment has failed and that this is the reason Hailsham was closed. When Kathy and Tommy ask about the deferral they find out that such deferrals never existed.\n\nTommy knows that his next donation will end his life. Kathy resigns as Tommy's carer and does not see him again. She will soon start her own donations.\n\nThe novel's title comes from a song on a cassette tape called \"Songs After Dark\", by fictional singer Judy Bridgewater. Kathy bought the tape during a swap meet-type event at Hailsham, which she often used to sing to and dance to the chorus: \"Baby, never let me go.\" On one occasion, while dancing and singing, she notices Madame watching her and crying. Madame explains the encounter when they meet at the end of the book. While Kathy reveals to the reader that she was simply thinking about holding a child, Madame connects the dancing and the song to what they are doing to the children. She is overwhelmed by guilt and sadness and thus starts to cry when she sees Kathy. \n\nIn another section of the book, Kathy refers to the three main characters \"letting each other go\" after leaving the cottages.\n\n\nCritics disagree over the genre of the novel. Writing for \"The New Yorker\", Louis Menand describes the novel as 'quasi-science-fiction', saying, 'even after the secrets have been revealed, there are still a lot of holes in the story [...] it's because, apparently, genetic science isn’t what the book is about.' \"The New York Times\" book reviewer Sarah Kerr wondered why Ishiguro would write in, what she dubs, the 'pop genre—sci-fi thriller', claiming the novel to 'quietly upend [the genre's] banal conventions.' Horror author Ramsey Campbell labelled it as one of the best horror novels since 2000, a 'classic instance of a story that's horrifying, precisely because the narrator doesn’t think it is.' \n\nJoseph O'Neill from \"The Atlantic\" suggested that the novel successfully fits into the coming of age genre. O'Neill wrote that 'Ishiguro's imagining of the children's misshapen little world is profoundly thoughtful, and their hesitant progression into knowledge of their plight is an extreme and heartbreaking version of the exodus of all children from the innocence in which the benevolent but fraudulent adult world conspires to place them.' Theo Tait, in a review for \"The Telegraph\", has a more general perspective of story: 'Gradually, it dawns on the reader that \"Never Let Me Go\" is a parable about mortality. The horribly indoctrinated voices of the Hailsham students who tell each other pathetic little stories to ward off the grisly truth about the future – they belong to us; we've been told that we're all going to die, but we've not really understood.'\n\nMark Romanek directed a British film adaptation titled \"Never Let Me Go\" in 2010. In Japan, the Horipro agency produced a stage adaptation in 2014 called \"Watashi wo Hanasanaide\" (), and in 2016 under the same title TBS Television aired a television drama adaptation set in Japan starring Haruka Ayase and Haruma Miura.\n\n"}

{"id": "26514163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26514163", "title": "Opera in Latin America", "text": "Opera in Latin America\n\nThe history of opera in Latin America dates back to at least the early 18th century. Opera arrived in Latin America as a consequence of European colonization. On October 19, 1701, \"La púrpura de la rosa\" premiered in Lima in the Viceroyalty of Peru, the first opera known to be composed and performed in the Americas. It is an opera in one act by Spanish composer Tomás de Torrejón y Velasco with a libretto by Pedro Calderón de la Barca, and is the only surviving opera by Torrejón y Velasco. It tells the myth of the love of Venus and Adonis, which provoked Mars's jealousy and his desire for vengeance.\nOpera performances were performed also in the country of Mexico. It is within that nation that the first indigenous opera composers of Latin America emerged, with Manuel de Zumaya (c. 1678–1755) being considered the first and most important early opera composer. Outsider of Perú and Mexico, opera was slower to gain a foothold, and it wasn't until the early to mid-19th century that other nations in Latin America began producing their own opera composers. Many of these 19th-century operas focus on the historical conflict between Europeans and indigenous peoples and were influenced by zarzuela, a form of Spanish opera .\n\nIn the 20th century many nationalist operas were composed across Latin America, with particularly thriving opera scenes in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil. Today, there are numerous active opera houses throughout Latin America and composers continue to write new operas. We also have organizations such as the International Brazilian Opera Company (IBOC) and Opera Hispanica who are promoting new Latin American operatic repertoire internationally.\n\nIn 1711, the opera \"Partenope\" premiered in Mexico City. Its music was by Manuel de Zumaya, the most important Mexican baroque composer. This opera is particularly important because it was the first opera composed in North America and the first opera composed in the Americas by someone from the Americas.\n\nThe first opera composed and premiered in Brazil was José Maurício Nunes Garcia's \"I Due Gemelli\"; the text has since been lost. \"A Noite de São João\" may be considered the first truly Brazilian opera, with a text in Portuguese by Elias Álvares Lobo. The most famous Brazilian composer was Antônio Carlos Gomes. Many of his operas premiered in Italy, with texts in Italian. However, Gomes often used typically Brazilian themes in his work, such as in his operas \"Il Guarany\" and \"Lo schiavo\".\n\nThe nineteenth-century opera \"Guatimotzin\" by Mexican composer Aniceto Ortega was the first conscious attempt to incorporate pre-Hispanic elements into the formal characteristics of opera. Other important 19th-century Mexican operas are \"Agorante, rey de la Nubia\" by Miguel Meneses (premiered during the commemorative festivities for the birthday of Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico), \"Pirro de Aragón\" by Leonardo Canales, and \"Keofar\" by Felipe Villanueva. The operatic works of Melesio Morales are the most important in Mexico in the 19th century. His operas \"Romeo y Julieta\", \"Ildegonda\", \"Gino Corsini\", and \"Cleopatra\" were very successful among the public of Mexico City, and premiered in Europe. The last opera by Melesio Morales, \"Anita\", which was composed in 1908, did not premiere until 2000.\n\nMorales's last period of composition coincided with the creation of operas in Mexico by his son Julio Morales, and the operas of Felipe Villanueva, Ricardo Castro, and Gustavo E. Campa. The work of Ricardo Castro is a part of the tradition of historic, nationalist operas, such as \"Guatimotzin\" by Aniceto Ortega, \"Il Guarany\" by Antônio Carlos Gomes, \"Ollanta\" and \"Atahualpa\" by José María Valle Riestra, \"Huémac\" by Pascual de Rogatis, and \"Quiché Vinak\" by Jesús Castillo. This tradition formed part of a turn-of-the-century operatic movement, in which other important figures included Eliodoro Ortiz de Zárate (Chile), José María Ponce de León (Colombia), Augusto Azzali (Colombia), León Ribeiro (Uruguay), Francisco Hargreaves (Argentina), Miguel Rojas (Argentina), and Edoardo Torrens (Argentina).\n\nThe first Venezuelan opera was \"El maestro Rufo Zapatero\", an opera buffa composed by José María Osorio in 1847. (However, many have called \"Virginia\", by José Ángel Montero, the first Venezuelan opera, though it premiered in 1877 under the auspices of the president Antonio Guzmán Blanco) . Earlier, various zarzuelas has been composed, but the first to premiere is believed to be \"Los alemanes en Italia\" by José Ángel Montero in the 1860s. Montero also premiered the one-act zarzuelas \"El Cumpleaños de Leonor\", \"El Charlatán Mudo\", \"La Modista\", and many others. Another major Venezuelan composer was Reynaldo Hahn, his operas include \"Le Merchand de Venise\" and \"Ciboulette\". Hahn's work was greatly influenced by his teacher Jules Massenet. In zarzuela, another important figure was Pedro Elías Gutiérrez, who incorporated typically Venezuelan rhythms into his work.\n\nTomás Giribaldi's \"La Parisina\" is considered the first Uruguayan opera. It premiered in September 1878. The work was very successful and awakened public interest in operas written by Uruguayan composers. Because of this success, the Uruguayan Oscar Camps y Soler wrote his opera \"Esmeralda, la gitana\", based on the Victor Hugo novel \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\"; the opera premiered in Montevideo in 1879. Other Uruguayan composers that wrote opera in this era, motivated by the success of \"La Parisina\", include León Ribeiro and Alfonso Broqua. León Ribeiro premiered his opera \"Colón\" in 1892 during the celebration of the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America. Alfonso Broqua wrote one opera, \"Tabaré\", based on the eponymous 1888 poem by José Zorrilla de San Martín.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th century, a number of operas were produced in Latin America in which conflict between Europeans and indigenous peoples was a theme. Among the most important operas of this type are \"Liropeya\" by León Ribeiro (Uruguay); \"Guatimotzin\" by Aniceto Ortega (Mexico); \"Il Guarany\" by Antonio Carlos Gomes (1836–1896), based on a novel by the Brazilian José Martiniano de Alencar; \"Atzimba\" by Ricardo Castro (Mexico, 1864–1907); the three eponymous operas based on the \"Tabaré\" by José Zorrilla de San Martín, written, respectively, by Arturo Cosgaya Ceballos (Mexico, 1869–1937), Heliodoro Oseguera (Mexico), and Alfonso Broqua (Uruguay); \"Los Martirios de Colon\" written by Federico Ruiz (Venezuela) and the three Ecuadorian operas based on the novel \"Cumandá o un drama entre salvajes\" by Juan León Mera, namely \"Cumandá\" by Luis H. Salgado (1903–1977), \"Cumandá o la virgen de las selvas\" by Pedro Pablo Traversari Salazar (1874–1956), and \"Cumandá\" by Sixto María Durán Cárdenas (1875–1947).\n\nArgentina\n\nIn Argentina, opera developed with the massive European (mainly Italian) immigration at the beginning of the century and with the opening of the Teatro Colón in 1908 where most of those world premieres took place. The most influential Argentinian opera composers include Ettore Panizza (whose opera \"Aurora\" was commissioned for the Colón inaugural season and \"Bizancio\" from 1939), Felipe Boero (\"El Matrero\" from 1929 his most famous opera, also \"Tucumán\" 1918, \"Ariana y Dyonisos\", 1920, \"Raquela\", 1923 and \"Siripo\", 1937), Juan José Castro (composer of \"Bodas de sangre\" and \"La zapatera prodigiosa\", both after Federico Garcia Lorca's plays and \"Proserpina y el extranjero\", 1952), Carlos López Buchardo (\"El sueño de Alma\", 1914), Pascual De Rogatis (\"Huemac\", 1916 and \"La novia del hereje\", 1934), Eduardo Garcia Mansilla (\"La angelical manuelita\",1917), Constantino Gaito (\"Petronio\", 1919; \"Ollantay\", 1926, \"La sangre de las guitarras\"), 1927, Floro Ugarte (\"Saika\", 1920), Gilardo Gilardi (\"Ilse\", 1923;\" La leyenda del urutaú\", 1934), Athos Palma (\"Nazdah\", 1924), Hector Iglesias Villoud (\"El Oro del Inca\", 1953), Virtú Maragno and Alberto Ginastera composer of \"Don Rodrigo\", \"Beatrix Cenci\" and \"Bomarzo\".\n\nIn recent years other Argentinean opera composers include Roberto Garcia Morillo (\"El caso Maillard\", 1977) Mario Perusso (\"La voz del silencio\"), Claudio Guidi-Drei (\"Medea\", 1973), Juan Carlos Zorzi (\"Antigona Velez\", 1991 and \"Don Juan\", 1993), Pompeyo Camps (\"La hacienda\", 1987, \"Marathon\", 1990 and \"La oscuridad de la razón\", 1996), Gerardo Gandini (\"La ciudad ausente\", 1995 and \"Liederkreis\", 2000), Ástor Piazzolla (\"Maria de Buenos Aires\") and Osvaldo Golijov (\"Ainadamar'’). \"In 2006 Centre for Experimentation (CETC) of Teatro Colón, proposed that national poet Rodolfo Enrique Fogwill work with the composer of his choice. He chose Oscar Edelstein who went on to make the script for \"Eterna flotación: Los Monstruito’\" from two poems of Fogwill, \"Contra el Cristal de La Pecera de Acuario\" (Against the Glass of the Aquarium) \" and \"El Antes de los Monstruito\" from the book \"Lo Dado\", to transform them into a continuous discourse that functions as a dramatic text. The opera dealt with the presidency of Menem and the era of decadency, leading to the headline by music critic, Juan Carlos Montero, \"The Poetic versus Social Degradation.\" \"\n\nBrazil\n\nImportant Brazilian opera composers in the first half of the 20th century include Heitor Villa-Lobos, the composer of operas such as \"Izath\", \"Yerma\", and \"Aglaia\"; and Camargo Guarnieri, composer of \"Um Homem Só\" and \"Pedro Malazarte\". Contemporary Brazilian opera continues these avant-garde tendencies, as is the case with works like \"Olga\" by Jorge Antunes, \"A Tempestade\" by Ronaldo Miranda, \"O Cientista\" by Silvio Barbato, and \"Tamanduá (The Anteater) – A Brazilian Opera\" by Joao MacDowell, founder of the International Brazilian Opera Company (IBOC), a New York-based non-profit with a mission to create new repertoire based on collaboration of Brazilian and international artists.\n\nRecent Ecuadorian operas include \"Los Enemigos\" by Mesías Maiguashca, based on the story \"The Secret Miracle\" by Jorge Luis Borges; Manuela y Bolívar by Diego Luzuriaga; and the instrumental opera \"El árbol de los pájaros\" by Arturo Rodas.\n\nMexico\n\nAnother interesting group is those composers that have tried to develop a Yucatecan operatic tradition based on Mayan legends. These composers typically work in Mérida, Yucatán, and have been scorned by Mexican nationalist historians. These composers include Cosgaya Ceballos, Ríos Escalante, Ricalde Moguel, Rivera Velador, Cárdenas Samada, and Jebe Halfdan. In the first half of the 20th century, composer Julián Carrillo was an important figure in Mexican opera, along with composers similar to him, including Antonio Gomezanda, Juan León Mariscal, Julia Alonso, Sofía Cancino de Cuevas, José F. Vásquez, Arnulfo Miramontes, Rafael J. Tello, Francisco Camacho Vega, and Efraín Pérez Cámara. All of these composers have been relegated by official musical historiography, which only recognizes the work of nationalist composers. \nSince the end of the 20th century in Mexico (and in all of Latin America), composers are increasingly interested in writing opera. Important Mexican opera composers in the early 21st century include Federico Ibarra, Daniel Catán, Leandro Espinosa, Marcela Rodríguez, Víctor Rasgado, Javier Álvarez, Roberto Bañuelas, Luis Jaime Cortez, Julio Estrada, Gabriela Ortiz, Enrique González Medina, Manuel Henríquez Romero, Leopoldo Novoa, Hilda Paredes, Mario Stern, René Torres, Juan Trigos, Samuel Zyman, Mathias Hinke, Ricardo Zohn-Muldoon, Isaac Bañuelos, Gabriel de Dios Figueroa, Enrique González-Medina, José Carlos Ibáñez Olvera, Víctor Mendoza and Emmanuel Vázquez.\n\nVenezuela\n\nIn contemporary Venezuela, there are great lyrical composers, including María Luisa Escobar, whose works include \"Kanaime\", \"Orquídeas Azules\", and \"Princesa Girasol\". Other important composers include Hector Pellegatti (author of the \"verismo\" opera \"El Negro Miguel\" with lyrics by Pedro Blanco Vilariño), Alexis Rago (author of \"El Páramo\", \"Miranda\", and \"Froilán el Infausto\"), and Federico Ruíz (author of the famous opera buffa \"Los Martirios de Colón\", with a libretto by Aquiles Nazoa). Today, most operatic activity in Venezuela takes place at Teatro Teresa Carreño. Here, operas such as \"El Páramo\" by Alexis Rago and \"Los martirios de Colón\" by Federico Ruiz have recently premiered.\n\nOther recent premieres include the opera \"Gertrudis\" by Gerardo Gerulewicz, with a libretto by Xiomara Moreno, work premiered in concert and in full stage production in Caracas, Venezuela.\n\nVenezuelan-American composer Sylvia Constantinidis who has written both, music and libretto for several lyrical works: two Dramatic Contemporary Operas, \"Araminta\" and \"Afrodita\"; one Experimental Short Opera, \"Aurora\"; and three Children Operas, \"Lincoln\", \"Ponce de Leon\", and \"The First ThanksGiving\". Some scenes from \"Araminta\" were premiered in Concert in England 2017. \"Afrodita\", was premiered in concert in England 2015 and in Miami, USA also in 2015. \"Aurora\", the Experimental Short Opera, was premiered in England in 2011. The three Children Operas: \"Lincoln\", \"Ponce de Leon\", and \"The First ThanksGiving\"; were all premiered in Florida, USA in 2001, 2002, and 2003. For these three Children Operas, Constantinidis received the \"Educator of Note Award 2003\" by the “Ethel and W. George Kennedy Family Foundation”, and the Young Patronesses of the Opera, the Florida Grand Opera.\n\nPerú\n\nIn November 2012 chamber operas \"Secreto\", \"La Cena\", \"Post Mortem\", \"María Fernanda se reb(v)ela\" and \"Sacrificio\" by composers Clara Petrozzi, Gonzalo Garrido Lecca, Sadiel Cuentas, Rafael Leonardo Junchaya and Alvaro Zúñiga were premiered in the French Alliance Theatre. All five operas had librettos by Maritza Núñez. In December 2012 Nilo Velarde's opera \"Akas Kas\", with libretto by Celeste Viale and commissioned by Perú's Culture Ministry, was premiered in Peru's Grand National Theater by Peru's National Orchestra, National Ballet, National Folklore Ensamble, National Chorus and National Children Chorus. In October 2013 Nilo Velarde's Opera \"La Ciudad Bajo el Mar\", with libretto by Maritza Núñez, was premiered in Perú's Grand National Theatre by the National Children Chorus. In December 2015 Jimmy Lopez's \"Bel Canto\", with libretto by Nilo Cruz and commissioned by the Lyric Opera of Chicago, was premiered in Ardis Krainik Theatre of the Civic Opera House, Chicago. In May 2016 Alvaro Zuñiga's \"Ger Mania\", with libretto by Maritza Núñez, was premiered in Helsinki, Finland.\n\n\n"}

It was shown on ITV from 20 June 1956 to 29 August 1956, produced by Associated Rediffusion. A second run commenced on 11 July 1964 and lasted until 20 March 1978, produced first by ABC and then by Thames. Hughie Green presented a single episode of Opportunity Knocks for RTÉ in 1979. It was revived by the BBC from 21 March 1987 to 2 June 1990, hosted initially by Bob Monkhouse from 1987 to 1989 (under the title \"Bob Says Opportunity Knocks!\") and subsequently by Les Dawson in 1990.\n\nUnlike its rival \"New Faces\", the winning acts on \"Opportunity Knocks\" were decided not by a panel of experts but by the viewing public. In the ITV version this took the form of a postal vote, the winner of which was announced the following week. The BBC revival was notable for being the first TV show to decide its winner using the now-standard method of a telephone vote. In both versions the studio audience reaction to each act was measured by a clap-o-meter, but this did not count towards the final result.\n\nThe programme was recorded the Friday before transmission, so votes had to be in by Thursday. They also, according to host Hughie Green, largely to ensure fairness, had to be in \"your own handwriting\".\n\nAlthough \"Opportunity Knocks\" did produce a number of talented acts, the method of putting the contest to a public vote did sometimes result in victories for novelty acts, in particular those involving children or animals. On one notorious occasion, the young Su Pollard was beaten into second place by a singing dog.\n\nFor the Monkhouse-fronted revival, the voting system was radically changed, making it the first British TV show to use telephone voting in order to get a more immediate result (although an updated electronic \"clap-o-meter-style\" on-screen indicator, using stars, was used during the show). The telephone voting system is now common on British TV.\n\nEntertainers who appeared included Freddie Starr and the Delmonts, Su Pollard, Paul Daniels, Darren Day, Pete the Plate Spinning Dog, Los Caracas, later to become Middle of the Road, Mary Hopkin, Bonnie Langford, Les Dawson, Maureen Myers, Barry Cummings, Royston Vasey (later to find fame as Roy 'Chubby' Brown), Little and Large, Bobby Crush, Berni Flint, Tony Holland (The Muscle Man), Millican & Nesbitt, Neil Reid, Peters and Lee, Lena Zavaroni, Frank Carson, Max Boyce, Pam Ayres, Juniper Green, Gerry Monroe, Debra Stephenson, Tammy Jones, Paper Lace, Barry and Paul Elliott and Tony Monopoly. Several winners of Opportunity Knocks (notably Tammy Jones, Champagne, Tony Monopoly) later attempted to represent the UK at the Eurovision Song Contest, taking part in the A Song for Europe competition. Lee Evans appeared in 1986 but was rejected and did not make it past the initial audition. Kaz Hawkins appeared in the 1980s' revival as a child.\n\nToday, most of the elements of this show are visible on the ITV talent search \"Britain's Got Talent\", which was created by record company executive Simon Cowell. The method of deciding a winner by telephone is used on that show and many other similar programmes around the world. \"Britain's Got Talent\" can be said to be an evolution of the original \"Opportunity Knocks\".\n\nA reference to the show can be heard on the Beatles' first live performance of \"Yesterday\" at Blackpool Night Out. George Harrison introduces the song, saying \"For Paul McCartney of Liverpool, opportunity knocks!\". This version appears on \"Anthology 2\".\n\n18 of the ITV episodes survived, which were Episode 5 of Series 3, Episode 19 of Series 6, Episodes 7-8, 22 & 25 of Series 12, Episodes 13 & 23 of Series 13, Episode 22 of Series 15, Episodes 13-14 of Series 16, Episodes 1, 7 & 15 of Series 17 and Episodes 16 and 25-27 of Series 18.\n\nAll 48 BBC1 episodes survived.\n\n"}

It is the sequel to 2009's , and stars James as the eponymous mall cop, Paul Blart, along with Neal McDonough, David Henrie, and Daniella Alonso.\n\nFilming began in April 2014 at the Wynn Las Vegas casino resort. It was released the following year on April 17, 2015. \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" was the first film shot on the Steve Wynn property. It was also the first film to receive Nevada's film tax credit enacted in 2013, receiving a $4.3 million break after spending $40.49 million in the state. The film grossed $107 million worldwide at the box office and has a 5% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nPaul Blart (Kevin James) narrates his several misfortunes and his hard recovery. His wife Amy (Jayma Mays) divorced him six days into their marriage and to feel better, Paul takes pride in patrolling the West Orange Pavilion Mall. Two years later, his mother Margaret (Shirley Knight) was killed after being hit by a milk truck. Four years after that, as Paul narrates \"he had officially peaked\", he receives an invitation to a security officers' convention in Las Vegas and begins to believe his luck is about to change. His daughter Maya Blart (Raini Rodriguez) discovers that she was accepted into UCLA and plans to move across the country to Los Angeles, but in light of her father's invitation, she decides to withhold the information for now.\n\nAfter arriving in Las Vegas, Paul and his daughter meet the general manager of Wynn Hotel, a pretty young woman named Divina Martinez (Daniella Alonso), to whom Paul is instantly attracted. He later learns that she's dating the hotel's head of security, Eduardo Furtillo (Eduardo Verástegui). Meanwhile, Maya and the hotel's valet, Lane (David Henrie) become instantly attracted to each other. A security guard from the Mall of America attending the convention, Donna Ericone (Loni Love), is aware of Paul's earlier heroics in the West Orange Pavilion Mall incident and believes Paul will be the likely keynote speaker at the event. However, Paul discovers that another security guard, Nick Panero (Nicholas Turturro), is giving the speech.\n\nIn the midst of the convention, a criminal named Vincent Sofel (Neal McDonough) and a gang of accomplices disguised as hotel employees are secretly plotting to steal priceless works of art from the hotel and replace them with replicas, then sell the real ones at auction. In the meantime, Paul has become overprotective of Maya after discovering her flirting with Lane and spies on their conversations. He is later mocked by Eduardo for his lack of professionalism in an event where hotel security was notified when Maya turns up missing. In an ensuing argument with her father, Maya boldly claims she's attending UCLA despite Paul's wishes that she remain close to home at a junior college.\n\nAt the convention, Paul, Donna, and three other security guards, Saul Gundermutt (Gary Valentine), Khan Mubi (Shelly Desai), and Gino Chizzeti (Vic Dibitetto) check out the non-lethal security equipment on display. Later, Paul finds Panero drunk hitting on a woman at the bar. Paul attempts to defuse the situation and Panero passes out, giving Paul a chance to be the event's speaker. He contacts Maya asking her to attend, but he learns that she's at a party with Lane. As Paul prepares his speech, Vincent and his cohorts put their plan into motion. Maya absentmindedly walks into the midst of the heist and is taken hostage. Lane is kidnapped as well while searching for her. After a brief fight with an ill-tempered bird in the hotel garden, Paul gives a rousing speech that moves everyone at the convention, as well as Divina, who inexplicably finds herself becoming more attracted to Paul with each passing moment. Following the speech, Paul learns about Maya and Lane's situation and rushes to help but passes out due to his hypoglycemic condition that has plagued him for years.\n\nAfter recovering, Paul is able to take down several of Vincent's thugs and gathers intel on the group's intentions. Using non-lethal equipment from the convention, he is able to take out more of Vincent's crew. Meanwhile, Maya and Lane overhear Vincent adamantly refusing an oatmeal cookie due to a severe oatmeal allergy. Working with a team – Donna, Saul, Khan, and Gino – Paul is able to clumsily dismantle Vincent's operation, with Maya severely incapacitating Vincent by rubbing oatmeal-infused concealer on his face. Afterward, Paul convinces Divina that her attraction for him is misplaced, and Eduardo is whom she should really be with. Paul also accepts Maya going to UCLA, funding her tuition with the reward money he obtained from Steve Wynn for stopping Vincent. After dropping off Maya at UCLA, Paul falls in love with a passing Mounted Police Officer who reciprocates his advances.\n\nIn January 2009, Sony expressed an interest in making a sequel to \"\". It was revealed on January 7, 2014 that Andy Fickman was in talks to direct the film while Kevin James, who also co-wrote the script with Nick Bakay, would be back to star as Blart. James produced the film along with Todd Garner and Happy Madison's Adam Sandler. The cast includes David Henrie, Raini Rodriguez, Eduardo Verástegui, Nicholas Turturro, Gary Valentine, Neal McDonough, Daniella Alonso, and D. B. Woodside, starring alongside James.\n\nOn March 14, 2014, the Nevada Film Office announced that Sony Pictures had been awarded the first certificate of eligibility for a new tax credit enacted in 2013, in regard to the filming of \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\". Nevada Film Office Director, Eric Preiss, indicated that the production would get $4.3 million in tax credits based on the proposal in their application. On April 2, 2014, Columbia Pictures announced that the film would be released on April 17, 2015.\n\nIn an October 2012 interview, James said that he liked the idea of filming the sequel at the Mall of America. Principal photography commenced on April 21, 2014, at Wynn Las Vegas, and ended on June 26, 2014. It is the first time that Steve Wynn has allowed a commercial film to be shot at this property.\n\n\"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" was released by Columbia Pictures in the United States on April 17, 2015. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray on July 14, 2015.\n\n\"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" grossed $71 million in North America and $36.2 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $107.3 million, against a production budget of $30 million. \n\nIn its opening weekend, the film grossed $23.8 million, finishing second at the box office behind \"Furious 7\" ($29.2 million).\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a rating of 5% based on 57 reviews and an average score of 2.5/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Bathed in flop sweat and bereft of purpose, \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\" strings together fat-shaming humor and Segway sight gags with uniformly unfunny results.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 13 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \"overwhelming dislike\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B-\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nSara Stewart of the \"New York Post\" gave the film one out of four stars, saying \"This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.\" Frank Scheck of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" gave the film a negative review, saying \"James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.\" Justin Chang of \"Variety\" gave the film a negative review, saying \"Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.\"\n\nChristy Lemire of RogerEbert.com gave the film zero stars, saying \"Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeate these reheated proceedings.\" Kevin P. Sullivan of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a D, saying \"Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.\" Peter Howell of the \"Toronto Star\" gave the film a half a star out of four, saying \"\"Caddyshack 2\". \"\". \"\". To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2\", a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.\" Andy Webster of \"The New York Times\" gave the film a negative review, saying \"You won’t find much offensive in Kevin James’s slick, innocuous vehicle \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.\" You won’t find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations. If Mr. James’s character thinks of safety first, so does this movie, to its extreme detriment.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "988381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=988381", "title": "Soundwave (Transformers)", "text": "Soundwave (Transformers)\n\nSoundwave is the name of a fictional character appearing in the various \"Transformers\" continuities in the Transformers robot superhero franchise. His most well-known transformation is that of a microcassette recorder. Throughout most of his incarnations, he is an undying loyal lieutenant of the Decepticon leader Megatron. He is Megatron's eyes and ears and, in some interpretations, only speaks when mocking the Autobots.\n\nSoundwave is one of the most recognizable characters from the original Transformers line, because of his alternate mode – a microcassette recorder – and his distinctive monotone, computerized voice.\n\nSoundwave is able to detect and jam transmissions across the entire energy spectrum, a talent that makes him suited to his position as Decepticon Communications Officer. Additionally, he has a photographic memory thanks to the vast data storage capacity of the magnetic disks in his chest compartment, and he is armed with a shoulder-mounted laser cannon and hand-held concussion blaster. Soundwave is physically strong compared to most Transformers. His alternative form - which involves an apparent loss of mass - is that of an Earthly microcassette deck. Within the tape compartment, which becomes his chest in robot mode, he stores a variety of Decepticon spies, all of which take the alternative form of a microcassette. These spy characters include Ravage, Laserbeak, Buzzsaw, Ratbat, Rumble, Frenzy, Slugfest, and Overkill, all of whom are under Soundwave's command in the original television series. Squawktalk and Beastbox were additional cassette characters under Soundwave's control in the US toyline, who were never shown in the cartoon.\n\nSoundwave's cassettes are quick to serve and defend Soundwave in a crisis, and generally relate to him as servants or even pets. However, when his cassette Ratbat became leader of the Decepticons in the Marvel Comics series, Soundwave fully shifted his trademark loyalty from Megatron to him. In the Dreamwave comics, Ratbat led the Ultracons faction, while Soundwave remained with the Decepticons led by Shockwave, although within that continuity these events occurred before Ratbat took up a cassette form. In the IDW comics, on pre-war Cybertron Soundwave functioned as personal assistant to Ratbat, who was a Senator at the time, however Soundwave's true loyalty lay with Megatron. When the time came for him and Starscream to massacre the Senate, he enslaved Ratbat by bestowing the smaller, weaker cassette body upon him.\n\nAccording to X-Entertainment Soundwave was the 8th top Transformers figure of all time.\n\nIn the original \"Transformers\" cartoon—his most prominent role in \"Transformers\" fiction—Soundwave was Megatron's right-hand mech, frequently sent on important reconnaissance missions with his cassettes, and often playing a key role in many schemes against the Autobots. On Cybertron, he used his ability to transform into a roadside fixture to spy on the Autobot city of Iacon, learning of the Autobots' plan to search for energy on other worlds. Joining in Megatron's attack on the Autobots' craft (known as the \"Ark\" in the Marvel Comics series at the time), Soundwave fell to the same fate as the rest of the ship's occupants when the craft crashed on prehistoric Earth, entombing everyone within stasis. Immediately after the Transformers awakened on Earth in 1984, Soundwave played an essential role in the generation of energon cubes and the formation of plans for a new space cruiser to return the Decepticons to Cybertron.\n\nLater, he used his mind-reading talents to acquire an antimatter formula for the Decepticons from the brain of Chip Chase. He and his cassette minions were often on spying missions against the Autobots.\n\nOne of Soundwave's most notable misadventures came in 1985, when, operating a plan conceived by Starscream, he brainwashed humans with ultrasonic vibrations, leading to a confrontation with his Autobot Communications Officer counterpart, Blaster, and to a lasting rivalry between the two.\n\nSoundwave rarely displayed much emotion, infrequently exhibiting any traits that could be considered to be in line with his tech spec. However, he showed distress when one of his cassettes were hurt in battle, and he always came across as extremely loyal to Megatron, even going so far as to recover his body after beaten close to death by Optimus Prime at the battle of Autobot City in 2005. But while Soundwave was loyal, he was far from outspoken, and kept silent when Megatron's body was subsequently ejected into space, and although he did suggest himself as a replacement leader (\"Soundwave: superior. Constructicons: inferior.\"), Soundwave again loyally served Megatron when he was reformatted as Galvatron.\n\nIn the year 2006, although operating in a less prominent capacity for most of the time, Soundwave played a prominent role in Galvatron's attempt to learn the secret of a sonic weapon on the planet Eurythma, where sound and music were the way of life, leaving Soundwave entranced by the planet's perfect melodies. Recording each piece of the harmony that formed the devastating sonic effect, Soundwave was defeated when the Eurythmans countered the harmony with white noise, and was again pulled into a confrontation with Blaster, who erased his recordings.\n\nSoundwave was performed by Frank Welker, whose voice was heavily modulated by a vocoder to achieve Soundwave's distinctive, metallic monotone. However, Welker's voice was left unmodulated at certain points during the episodes \"Roll for It\" and \"Webworld\" due to production errors.\n\nAlthough Soundwave only appeared as a background character in the American cartoon series finale, the three-part \"The Rebirth\", he returned to the forefront in the new Japanese-exclusive series, \"\", which was created to replace \"The Rebirth\". Reborn as Soundblaster (New Soundwave in the English version and Vizar in Italy) Soundwave's new toy incarnation was, like the series, available only in Japan.\n\nIn the year 2011, Soundwave and Blaster's rivalry had increased dramatically. In the opening cut and thrust of \"Headmasters\", Soundwave and Blaster engaged in their final clash in the Arctic Circle as the Autobots and Decepticons were in the process of searching for the missing Autobot Matrix of Leadership. The two opponents inflicted fatal damage to each other, and Soundwave's body exploded even as Blaster collapsed. Soundwave's fragments were recovered by his cassettes. Using reconstructive technology from the planet Master, the leader of the Decepticon Headmasters, Zarak successfully rebuilt and resurrected Soundwave and renamed him Soundblaster—essentially identical to his former self, except for his predominantly black color scheme. As Soundblaster, he served the same role as he had as Soundwave under the leadership of Galvatron and later Scorponok, frequently embarking on spying missions with Ratbat.\n\nHe also had a father-son relationship with the cassettes, as it was hinted on his resurrection as 'Soundblaster'.\n\nA flashback in episode 5 of Beast Machines, \"Forbidden Fruit\", showed \"Generation 1\" Soundwave (or a close likeness of him) being gunned down while helping the Maximal Nightscream escape the Vehicon tank drones. His appearance in this series is somewhat unclear since Autobots and Decepticons were replaced by Maximals and Predacons, 300 years after The Great War.\n\nSoundwave appeared in the following books:\n\nHe also appeared in the Furman written \"Reaching the Omega Point\", as one of the Transformers legends (alongside Optimus Prime, Megatron and Grimlock) who came to the aid of the forces of Optimus Primal against the Predacon/Unicron hybrid Shokaract, distracting him long enough for Primus to deal the fatal blow.\n\nIn Devil's Due's run of \"G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers\" comic book miniseries, Soundwave was among the Transformers captured by the ruthless terrorist Cobra Organization, when they discovered the Ark. Refitted by Destro, Soundwave was intended to become a battlefield communications station, but when he and the other Decepticons eventually broke free of their control he was damaged in a battle with the Autobots and his parts were captured by the US Government for study. From his data banks, the android SerpentO.R. downloaded information on the history of Cybertron, using it to further the Decepticon goal of conquest. It is indicated that his pre-Earth form was similar to his Dreamwave War Within form.\n\nIn Dreamwave's 21st century re-imagining of the Generation 1 continuity, Soundwave was recruited to the Decepticons 9 million years ago through Megatron's underground gladiatorial games, and made head of communications. When a new Autobot leader, Optimus Prime, was chosen, Soundwave was sent along with the Insecticons and Ravage, to attempt to kill him and recover the Autobot Matrix of Leadership for Megatron, but they failed, forcing Megatron to confront Optimus personally.\n\nEven in the face of failures such as this, and later the loss of Megatron in an early space bridge experiment, Soundwave's loyalty to the Decepticon cause never wavered, as he remained true to the faction under Shockwave's leadership.\n\nAs in most other continuities, the story continues in the traditional manner, with Soundwave a member of the \"Nemesis\" crew who attacked the \"Ark\" and was sent into stasis when the craft crashed on Earth, awakening again in 1984. After years of fighting on Earth, eventually the combined forces of the Autobots and their human allies were able to defeat and capture the Decepticons. The intent was for the Autobots to take their enemies back to Cybertron aboard a new craft named the \"Ark II\", but just as the ship cleared the atmosphere, it exploded, the victim of machinations by Shockwave, who did not want Prime and Megatron to return to Cybertron yet.\n\nSoundwave's body crashed back to Earth in the Arctic, where he lay inactive for several years, until rogue military scientist Adam Rook, calling himself \"Lazarus,\" recovered and reactivated him, putting him under his control with a program he had developed while studying the Transformers before their explosive departure. Several other Autobots and Decepticons fell to the same fate, and were to be sold on the black market—Soundwave himself was put on display by being sent to attack the Smitco Oil Refinery alongside several other Transformers—but when Megatron liberated himself, Soundwave was soon freed by his leader and assumed his position at his side.\n\nWhen Shockwave arranged for the capture and extradition of Prime and Megatron's forces as war criminals, Soundwave was among the captives, but when Starscream jettisoned Megatron into space on the return trip to Cybertron, Soundwave made the best of a bad lot and teamed with Starscream to return to Earth and conquer it, being reunited with Ratbat in the process. Heading back to Earth in a kidnapped Sky Lynx and with the Combaticons now added to their ranks, the Decepticons attacked the \"Ark\" in hopes of acquiring parts to make the \"Nemesis\" spaceworthy again, however Soundwave, Skywarp and Thundercracker were defeated and thrown in the \"Ark\"'s brig. When the Combaticons, combined as Bruticus, laid into the vessel, they were freed.\n\nIt was not much later that the surviving Megatron made contact with Soundwave from space, and Soundwave was all too willing to return to his service, setting up Starscream to fall before Megatron when he returned. And return, Megatron did—but the bankruptcy and subsequent closure of Dreamwave left the rest of the story untold.\n\nSoundwave also appeared in the Dreamwave Transformers/G.I. Joe series as one of the Decepticons uncovered by Cobra at the start of the World War II. Transforming into a radio, he was deactivated at the series' close by Grimlock. Although Dreamwave's collapse precluded the completion of the second series, released art and information revealed that Soundwave would have been involved in the conclusion of that series.\n\nBased on the Transformers Classics toy line, the Timelines 2007 story is set 15 years after the end of the Marvel Comics story (ignoring all events of the Marvel UK and Generation 2 comics). Megatron survived the crash of the Ark on Earth, reformatted himself into a new form and now leads Astrotrain, Laserbeak, Ramjet, Ravage, Skywarp, Soundwave, Starscream and the Constructicons. Optimus Prime has also returned to Earth commanding Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, Grimlock, Jetfire, Mirage and Rodimus (formerly Hot Rod). When the Cybertronians Skyfall and Landquake arrive on Earth unexpectedly Megatron attempts to destroy them, but Optimus Prime and his Autobots are able to drive Megatron away.\n\nSoundwave was among Megatron's troops when Megatron defeated Deathsaurus in combat for leadership of the Decepticons and when Megatron attacked Iacon with his new weapon, Devastator.\n\nSoundwave's first chronological appearance in the rebooted IDW Publishing Generation One universe was in the prequel miniseries, \"\". In the story, Soundwave works for Senator Ratbat, who takes an interest in the rising gladiator, Megatron. Ratbat sends Soundwave to offer weaponry to Megatron and his followers. Soundwave also assists Megatron with the interrogation of Autobot soldier, Bumper. Soundwave is later jailed along with Megatron and other when Sentinel Prime's forces capture them, but is released by Ratbat. When Megatron's plan is sprung, Soundwave helps Starscream massacre the Autobot Senate. He later confronts Ratbat and forcibly extracts his Spark for implantation in one of his Cassette bodies. Soundwave's alternate mode appears to be a communication vehicle with tank treads.\n\nSometime later, Soundwave was part of the conference of scientists called by Thunderwing in \"\", where he refuses to accept Thunderwing's findings that Cybertron was dying. In around the same time period he had Beachcomber captured and implanted with a cerebro-shell, having the unwilling traitor eject his opposite number Blaster into space (in \"\") in order to demoralize the Autobots prior to a Decepticon offensive.\n\nSoundwave's story was later continued in his own \"\" one-shot, where he was a self-serving and duplicitous Decepticon internal affairs agent. Soundwave was dispatched by Megatron to keep an eye on Bludgeon's investigation of Shockwave's lab. However, he kept quiet about Bludgeon's obsession with the Regenesis project, thinking he could turn it to his advantage. Following him to Earth in 1984, Soundwave monitored Bludgeon's attempts to harvest Ultra Energon and confronted him after he'd acquired it. Horrified to discover they were not planning to use it in a power-play but instead to reanimate Thunderwing (who previously devastated Cybertron), Soundwave attempted to stop them but was trapped in stasis-lock in cassette player mode. It was revealed in the epilogue that two young humans considered buying him at a pawn shop in 2007.\n\nIn \"\" #1, Optimus stated there was evidence that Soundwave had been present in Earth's history. Despite this, he did not reappear until issue #4 of \"\", where, still trapped in cassette player mode, he interfered with Skywatch's control of Laserbeak and Ravage.\n\nSoundwave also appeared as one of the Decepticon forces, serving under Starscream in the out-of-continuity \"\" tale \"Hearts of Steel\". He appeared as one of Starscream's lieutenants. He was presumably destroyed when John Henry and Bumblebee diverted the Decepticon train convoy into a chasm.\n\nLike much of the original 1984 cast of Decepticons, Soundwave played a much smaller role in the Marvel book series than he did in the cartoon. He quietly and efficiently served loyally, first under Megatron (even sending Ravage and the Insecticons to derail talks between the Autobots and Ronald Reagan at one point in the 1985 Transformers UK annual), then under Shockwave, attacking an aerospace construction plant whose facilities were used to build the Constructicons, who then built a massive radio dish that Soundwave used to beam a message back to Cybertron.\n\nContinuing to operate under Shockwave, Soundwave then moved to serving Ratbat, and co-led the defense of Buenos Aires against the Underbase-empowered Starscream alongside Fortress Maximus, only to wind up deactivated by the villain.\n\nUnlike many of the others deactivated by Starscream, Soundwave would appear again, under Scorponok's command. Throughout the U.S. comic, Soundwave was colored purple instead of his more trademark blue, and additionally was frequently drawn with a visible mouth.\n\nMeanwhile, across the Atlantic in the UK, a sister title to the American series was also in production. It reprinted the American stories, but as it was released on a weekly (as opposed to monthly) schedule, it soon began to run out of material to reprint. It opted to create its own original stories at that point, which deftly weaved in and out of the ongoing American storyline. Under writer Simon Furman, Soundwave—coloured-blue was a fairly major player, portrayed in a manner much more consistent with his profile - that of a manipulator and blackmailer, reading others' minds and using their secrets to his own ends, always working towards his own goals.\n\nWhen Megatron and Shockwave were both briefly believed deceased, he assumed leadership of the Decepticons during Optimus Prime's \"Crisis of Command\" and then the \"Dinobot Hunt\" story arcs, manipulating events to weaken the Autobot leadership and cause maximum casualties. When the two commanders returned and vied for leadership of the Decepticons, he turned the situation to his own advantage by working both sides of the field. He also enjoyed a rare victory in this period when he, Dirge and Kickback took over a NASA complex in an attempt to contact Cybertron with the facility's deep space radio equipment. The Autobots arrived, but a series of miscommunications between Prowl and Jetfire resulted in the transmission being sent, allowing the Decepticons to claim victory.\n\nTowards the end of the UK series, a storyline began which separated from the regular ongoing American continuity, covering the exploits of the proactive Autobot \"Earthforce\". In these stories, Soundwave sold Decepticon secrets to both the Autobots and Shockwave's group of Decepticons. Wildrider was blamed for this intelligence leak, and Soundwave silently allowed him to be killed rather than be discovered. After Starscream successfully removed Megatron and Shockwave from power, he and Soundwave entered into joint leadership of the Decepticons.\n\nIssue #279 of the Marvel UK Transformers comic featured a story called \"Divide and Conquor!\" where Soundwave lead the bulk of the Decepticon forces on Earth against the Autobot Earthforce headquarters while Starscream attacked an oil tanker. Sent into battle by Prowl, the Dinobots routed the main Decepticon forces while Springer lead the Autobot Survivors, Broadside, Inferno, Skids, and Carnivac to defeat Starscream.\n\nSoundwave attained leadership of the Decepticons in the future world of 2008, following the death of Shockwave (who had seized power when Galvatron traveled back in time). Soundwave led his era's Decepticons back to 1989 to participate in the Time Wars when the fabric of reality began to crumble, but as the conflict came to a head they fled back to their own time. Since it was later established that the damage done to the time stream may have resulted in their future being erased from the timeline, the final fate of the future Soundwave is unknown.\n\nSoundwave returned to the pages of the US \"Transformers\" comic books for the relaunch of the series as \"\". He participated in the Decepticon attack on Earth, and oversaw the reconstruction of the damaged Darkwing into a new, more powerful form.\n\nLike many of the other Generation 1 Decepticons, Soundwave seemed to return to a command position on Megatron's return (killing Bludgeon in the process).\n\nSoundwave made an appearance in the Decepticon forces under the command of Megatron in issue #7 of the Marvel \"Generation 2\" comic series, in a story called \"New Dawn.\" Megatron lead his Decepticons against Jhiaxus' second generation Cybertronians near the moon of Tykos. The Decepticons were defeated and Megatron left injured, presumed dead, but swearing revenge.\n\nHe was aboard the Warworld when Jhiaxus' forces attacked, but managed to evacuate. His fate within the Generation 2 comic series beyond this point is unknown.\n\nSoundwave would also play a brief but important role in the text-only novel, \"Alignment\", writer Simon Furman's take on what happened after the \"\" comic series ended. He was the one who recovered Megatron's broken body after his duel with Galvatron. Subsequently, he was the ringleader of the conspirators (along with Ravage, Ramjet and Direwolf) who gave some of their spark energy to resurrect Megatron in a more powerful body, allowing him to defeat the forces of the Liege Maximo. After Megatron executes the Decepticon High Council save Shrapnel, Soundwave once again acted as Megatron's second in command and coordinated the strike against the Maximo with Ultra Magnus. His fate beyond this is unknown, save for a brief cameo in \"Beast Machines\".\n\nSoundwave as depicted in the Marvel Universe tends to be the most intellectual and philosophical of the Decepticons. He is appalled by the barbarity of Megatron and Shockwave battling in hand to hand combat for leadership of the Decepticons, especially as the entire spectacle is being broadcast on live television for human entertainment by Robo-Master. When the future Autobots and Decepticons join forces and repel an alien invasion of Cybertron he begins to propose a lasting truce to Ultra Magnus but stops himself, observing that too much has occurred between the 2 factions and their differences are irreconcilable.\n\nSoundwave appeared in the TFcon 2009 voice actor play \"Bee for, Bee now\".\n\nA parody of the Generation 1 Transformers was aired in the December 23rd 2008 episode of \"Frank TV\", called \"Frank the Halls\". In the story, Optimus Prime and his Autobots (Bumblebee, Jazz and Wheeljack) battle Megatron and his Decepticons (Soundwave and Starscream) when Optimus runs out of gas. Optimus becomes enraged at the price of gas, steals the fuel from the annoying hybrid Autobot Prius Maximus, then joins the Decepticons in destroying the city.\n\nSoundwave appears in the \"Robot Chicken\" episode \"Toy Meets Girl\" voiced by Seth Green. He is portrayed as having retired from the Decepticon army and obtained honest employment as a transformable portable toilet. Frank Welker reprises his role of Soundwave (as well as Megatron but not Rumble) when he appears again in another \"Robot Chicken\" episode \"Werewolf vs. Unicorn\" where in the current years it's revealed that because the audio cassette tape and cassette players have long become obsolete and therefore no longer widely used, that his spy tactics now do not work (the people who discovered him in the skit were laughing at his mixtape which was Rumble being killed by them puling his tape out). He is later found by Megatron and Shockwave to be on sale on eBay with options to place a bid for 500 dollars or \"Buy it now\" for 1000 dollars, whereupon Shockwave exclaims \"Request permission to buy it now!\" The Commemorative Soundwave figure was used in \"Werewolf vs. Unicorn.\"\n\nSoundwave made a cameo appearance in the \"Family Guy\" episode \"The Courtship of Stewie's Father\" as Peter's new supervisor. In it, Soundwave releases a framed photograph from his cassette deck cavity, of himself and a human woman named Denise, who Soundwave proclaims is his wife, whom he met in a Christian chat room. Soundwave also appears in the \"Sealab 2021\" episode \"Hail, Squishface\" as a toy on an Asian girl's cart, who sells Capt. Murphy Gloop, from the show \"The Herculoids\".\n\nA music video featuring Soundwave and a robot similar to Rumble and Frenzy named Lazer (though purely white in colour) breakdancing has surfaced throughout the Internet since 2000. The video contains audio clips from both the animated series and \"\" alongside music.\n\nIn 2007, shortly before the release of the live-action \"Transformers\" film, Soundwave appeared in the viral comedy short \"Soundwave: The Touch.\"\n\n\nA character named Soundwave—but with no relation to the original character—was released as part of the \"Beast Wars Mutants\" sub-line in 2000. As a Mutant, this Soundwave transforms from bat to alligator, with no humanoid mode. Due to his in-built radar in bat mode, and crushing jaws in alligator mode, he excels at a variety of missions. However, due to his situation, Soundwave is a dark and bitter character. He has an ultra-sensitive internal radar in bat mode, and in alligator mode, his tail can send seismic shockwaves through the ground.\n\nThis version of Soundwave also appeared in IDW Publishing's miniseries. Activated on Earth by Magmatron and a group of Predacons from the future, Soundwave and the mutants emerged from their stasis pods and took up residence in a swamp that they quickly made their own. When a group newly activated Predacons led by Transquito ventured through the swamp on a mission they were attacked by the Mutants. Poison Bite attacked Retrax, Soundwave attacked Powerpinch and Icebird attacked Transquito. Deciding the swamp was not worth their lives, Scourge and Insecticon fled. However, in \"The Ascending\" it is revealed that Powerpinch, Transquito and Retrax survived.\n\nIDW's Beast Wars Sourcebook series identifies the mutant Soundwave as a former warrior who may have been a veteran of the Great War, though the details are ambiguous at best. Sourcebook #4 states that Soundwave became an actor/entertainer after the ratification of the Pax Cybertronia, developing a \"dramatic flair in everything from his movements to his speech paterns\".\n\nIn \"Transformers: Universe - The Wreckers\" the Mutants traveled to Cybertron and sought the guidance of the Oracle computer, seeking a cure for their condition. What they did not know is that the Oracle was under the influence of the Quintessons. The Mutants were sent to the outer Orion Cluster. Once there they were captured by the Quintessons, found in contempt by the five-faced aliens, and destroyed in an attack by a swarm of Sharkticons.\n\n\nIn \"\", Soundwave's origins are altered. He is the second Transformer from the mysterious Planet X. He transforms into a Planet X Jet (bearing a resemblance to a stealth bomber) and is partnered with a smaller robot called Laserbeak \"(Killer Condor in Japan)\". In the English dub of this series, he has a synthesized voice, albeit more human than his G1 counterpart, which is counterbalanced by his tendency to speak like a modern disc jockey—using terms like \"\"He got served\" and \"Peace out, bots\" and calling the battlefield, \"The Floor\"\", giving him more of a personality than his G1 counterpart.\n\nThe package bio for Soundwave mentions that Planet X itself may be a total deception, and that it is actually a term the agents use to refer to their service to Unicron. Although he and Sideways are the survivors of a dead civilization, they actually serve Unicron throughout space and time as his heralds in taking over new worlds to replace his loss of previous forms.\n\nSoundwave is armed with two cannons, and can hide himself behind holograms when working in conjunction with Laserbeak.\n\nSoundwave first makes his appearance in the episode \"Titan\", offering to lead Megatron and his minions to the planet Gigantion, however in a scene featuring Sideways and Starscream aboard the Atlantis a purple cassette player with the Decepticon symbol is on board playing music to ease the tension between the two evil robots. It is not clear if this is Soundwave or not, but it is interesting that he appeared in \"Titan\" just a few episodes later. In his first encounter with the Autobots he fought Optimus Prime and Wing Saber in their Sonic Wing mode and was able to hold his own in combat until Megatron was defeated by Metroplex and the Decepticons retreated.\n\nShortly after they arrived on Gigantion and there Megatron was upgraded into Galvatron, Soundwave abandoned the Decepticons, and joined up with his counterpart, Sideways. During a battle with the Autobot Cybertron Defense Team, he revealed the history of his world, and how they desired the Cyber Planet Keys to get revenge on the inhabitants of Gigantion.\n\nLater, he and Sideways attempted to intervene in the epic battle between Galvatron and Starscream in order to claim the Planet Keys and Omega Lock, only to be sent into another universe by the distortion caused by the two fighters' conflict.\n\nHowever, Soundwave would appear later, when Starscream reached out to Galvatron across dimensions, seemingly trapped along with him and Sideways. However, Starscream seemed to have returned by the series' end, which meant that the same possibility existed for both Sideways and Soundwave.\n\nSoundwave is the only major transformer in the series who never summons his Cyber Key. In his toy version, his Cyber Key opens his chest compartment to store Laserbeak or one of his two cannons. In his first appearance to the Autobots, Soundwave demonstrates the ability to do this without the aid of a Cyber Key.\n\nG1 Soundwave makes a cameo appearance in the animated series as a blue boombox that Sideways used to hear music.\n\nThe \"Cybertron\" incarnation of Soundwave was among the characters to appear in the comic strip published exclusively through the Transformers Collectors Club, arriving on the planet itself to observe Vector Prime, Sentinel Maximus and Omega Prime after their defeat of Unicron's heralds, Nemesis Prime and Ramjet, and capture of the Dead Matrix. Dispatching Laserbeak to recover the Dead Matrix from its place in storage, Soundwave threw the talisman into the black hole that had been created by the collapse of Unicron, allowing the Chaos Bringer's Spark to escape and infiltrate the planet Yst, which he corrupted and transformed into his new body. Soundwave would link up with his master, and watch the unfolding carnage of a Mini-Con civil war. However, when Unicron chose that moment to attack, Soundwave was attacked by several Mini-Cons, including Scythe and Perceptor. Unable to hit the smaller Mini-Cons, Soundwave fled with Unicron when Primus awoke.\n\n\nAlmost from the moment the live action \"Transformers\" movie was announced in 2007, producer Don Murphy and the production team made it clear they did not want to feature mass/size shifting in transformation (excluding the Allspark), due to concerns over realism. With this process an inherent part of Soundwave's tape deck alternate mode, there was some discussion over whether or not to change it due to its obsolescence, or to include the character in the film at all. It was announced by Hasbro at SDCC 2004 that movie Soundwave would be a helicopter. Early leaked movie scripts proposed that his alternate mode would be a helicopter, but animatics shown at the 2005 Comic Con were poorly received. This led to a rethink, with the eventual helicopter character rechristened as Vortex, then finally Blackout. 2006 script reviews named Soundwave as a spying boombox on Air Force One, able to transform into a small robot, but eventually, this character was amended to being Frenzy, with Don Murphy stating that Soundwave will be reserved for a future sequel, until they can \"do him right\". When the film was released on DVD a special on-line content from Best Buy showed early animation footage of Blackout as a blue helicopter with a head that resembled Soundwave.\n\nIn a \"USA Today\" online fan poll, Soundwave was one of the 10 Transformers that the fans wanted in the sequel, winning with 20% of the votes.\n\nSoundwave appears in \"\". Soundwave is a satellite in the film, and he is also a Triple changer as he has the form of a Cybertronian jet as well. Soundwave is not seen in his robot form in the film. Frank Welker reprised his voicing role, and used his Doctor Claw voice from \"Inspector Gadget\", which, when run through a vocoder, gives Soundwave his unique voice from the original animated series. The lack of this vocoder in the 2009 film left the voice sounding more like Doctor Claw than the original Soundwave. He has his minion Ravage to do his bidding in the film.\n\nSoundwave also appears in \"\", this time transforming into a Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG and with Laserbeak to serve him. Soundwave is armed with sonic cannons.\n\nHis Hasbro Battle Bio states that he is 22 feet tall and that his main weapon is a sonic cannon which can only be used in the atmosphere, as sound waves will not travel in vacuum.\n\nIn issue #4 of \"\", it is revealed that the reason for Soundwave to have believed to have been dead is because he was on the Decepticons ship that \"The Fallen\" was commanding, and that all of its crew were missing by the time Megatron noticed the emergency signal emitting from the ship while he was chasing the Allspark.\n\nSoundwave first appeared in issue #2 of \"\" where he arrived at the crash site of the \"Nemesis\" on Mars. There he found Dreadwing's head, as well as the body of Frenzy, then contacted Starscream and told him to rally to his signal. Starscream was surprised to hear from Soundwave, as he had been believed dead for years. Soundwave deployed a number of his forces on Earth, leaving others on his ship.\n\nIn \"Tales of the Fallen\" #5 Soundwave, still in orbit after the events of the 2009 film, notices someone has reactivated Ravage.\n\nSoundwave appears in \"\" #1, set months after the events of the 2009 film. Bumblebee, Breakaway, Jolt, Knock Out and Dune Runner are sent to investigate spark fragments detected at Kingdom Petrochemicals. Arriving first Breakaway is warned by Soundwave to leave, but unwilling to give in the Autobot is swiftly defeated. Bumblebee and his team fire on Soundwave, who escapes. In \"Nefarious\" #2, Soundwave sent Dirt Boss, Reverb, and Brakedown to Wendover, Utah to find an \"Initiative\" facility. Soundwave then contacted Ravage in order to discover how he was resurrected. Then, he proceeded to assist Reverb, Dirt Boss, and Brakedown, in a fight with the Autobots. After a battle with Optimus Prime, Soundwave convinces the Autobot leader to join forces temporarily, in order to find \"the Initiative\".\n\nIn \"Revenge of the Fallen\", Soundwave spends his time hovering above Earth in orbit. He receives a message from Wheelie about Mikaela Banes possessing a shard of the Allspark and orders him to retrieve it. Docking onto a satellite and hacking it, Soundwave intercepts information on the location of Megatron's corpse and the Allspark shard. He deploy his servant Ravage to retrieve the shard and sent the Constructicons to rendezevous at Megatron's resting place. After the death of Optimus Prime, Soundwave carried out Megatron's orders to prepare the Decepticons for the invasion of Earth. While coordinating attacks, Soundwave located Sam Witwicky's parents in Paris, France, and called Judy Witwicky via her cell phone. He demanded she tell him where Sam was, but Judy did not take him seriously, believing him to be a pervert caller, and hung up. He later intercepted calls from the Egyptian government on Sam's location, and informed the other Decepticons. Soundwave did not take part in the last battle, although Ravage did and was killed by Bumblebee.\n\nIn \"Dark of the Moon\", Soundwave is revealed to have been on Earth since the 1970s. He discovered the Autobot spaceship, the \"Ark\" on the Moon, and recruited various human servants from the U.S. and Russian space agencies to prevent further exploration of it following the initial Moon landings, while he ordered an army of Decepticons to steal most of the pillars onboard and hide under the moon's surface. In the modern day he appears at Megatron's base in Africa, where he and Laserbeak report the Autobot's recovery of Sentinel Prime and the remaining pillars from the crashed \"Ark\". Megatron praises Soundwave's initiative in the decades-long plan and orders Laserbeak to kill their human allies. The only human ally they don't kill, Dylan Gould, has Soundwave disguise himself as a Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG that belonged to Sam's girlfriend, Carly, in order to get close to the Autobots. He reveals himself and captures Carly once the two humans learn of Gould's alliance with the Decepticons, and threatens her in order to convince Sam to discover the Autobot's plans. During the battle in Chicago, Soundwave and Barricade lead several Decepticons in capturing some of the Autobots. Gould convinces Soundwave not to take prisoners, and Soundwave orders the others to execute their \"trophies\". Once Que is dead, Soundwave prepares to kill Bumblebee himself, but a Decepticon battle-cruiser hijacked by Wheelie and Brains drops fighters near Soundwave, distracting him and allowing the Autobots to fight back. Bumblebee attacks Soundwave who tries to shoot him, but is confused among the crushing ships and shoots the other Decepticons. He throws Bumblebee, but Bumblebee then slays Soundwave by sticking his cannon into Soundwave's chest and shooting upwards. This causes Soundwave's head to disintegrate, killing him instantly.\n\nIn \"Cyber Missions #1\", Soundwave successfully infiltrates the NEST command base (in his satellite mode, oddly), which is guarded by Bumblebee. Soundwave transforms and smashes the screen projecting Optimus Prime and engages the Autobot. Bumblebee fires a shot, but Soundwave sends it back to Bumblebee as a sonic boom. Bumblebee then fires several more rounds with Soundwave frantically trying to absorb all the bullets, but is finally blown backwards. In \"Cyber Missions #2\", Bumblebee trapped Soundwave in a vacuum-sealed electromagnetic bubble, rendering his abilities useless.\n\nLike the movie, Soundwave coordinates the mission to the playable Decepticon. His voice is now a similar Vocoder fashion of his G1 counterpart.\n\nIn Dark of the Moon, Soundwave is a playable character. He is ordered by Megatron to destroy a Sector 7 nest base that contains information about Sentinel Prime. Soundwave is among the Decepticons that greet Shockwave at the end of the game in South Africa. He shows Shockwave a 3D hologram of Chernobly and the artifact he must recover. He transforms into a Modified white SUV similar to a Cadillac SRX\n\nIn the Nintendo DS game \"\", Grindor, Sideways, Soundwave and Starscream greet a new Decepticon protoform and send him on a mission. Soundwave directs the new protoform to survive on Earth.\n\nIn the downloadable content pack for the Xbox 360 and PS3, Soundwave is confirmed to be a playable character. He is probably based on the Deluxe toy.\n\nIn \"\" for the Wii and 3DS Soundwave is a playable character, and (like with the PS3/360 version) transforms into a heavily modified Cadillac SRX\n\nIn \"\", Soundwave is a playable character taking the alternate form of a cybertronian truck. He is playable in levels 3, 4 and 5 of the decepticon campaign and is a boss that players have to fight in the autobot level 2. Like all characters within the game he is playable in escalation mode, and players have to have their decepticon leader look like him in multiplayer mode. In the game his default weapon is a neutron assault rifle, although he does have an energon repair ray in level 5 of the decepticon campaign.\n\nIn the \"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\" coloring book Soundwave is depicted hacking into a military satellite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoundwave appears in \"Transformers Animated\" as a modular music-based Decepticon, who specializes in sonic interference. Whilst his robot mode still retains elements of his original tapedeck incarnation, more so in his toy form, his alt-mode is now a loudspeaker-equipped Scion xB. He also possesses two supporters: Laserbeak, who transforms into an electric guitar he uses for a sonic boom attack, and Ratbat, which becomes a keytar for use in sonic hypnosis. His voice, now provided by Jeff Bennett in the United States and Nobuo Tobita in Japan, once again requires a vocoder to create Soundwave's trademark robotic monotone voice.\n\nSoundwave was originally a simple robotic toy that Sari got for her birthday, built by Megatron as a part of a plan to take advantage of Sari's careless and repeated use of her Allspark key to continuously upgrade the toy until it serves as a suitable body for Megatron to host. However, the excessive usage of the key to enhance Soundwave caused an unexpected side-effect: Developing almost Cybertronian sophistication at an alarmingly increasing rate to the point of becoming self-aware to the point where he refuses to take orders from Sari (or any other human) any more. It was by observing the common labor-robots in the city that he concluded that not only robots are superior to humans in every way, but that it's illogical that robots are forced to succumb to their human masters, and it should be the other way around. By then, Megatron introduced himself to Soundwave through televisions in a nearby electronics store as his creator \"of sorts\" to impose unto him his plan to crush the Autobots. At first, Soundwave declared this illogical to fight robot-kind until Megatron insisted that they were traitors that upheld the human race's slavery of all robot-kind, convincing Soundwave to ultimately side with the Decepticons with the intent to overthrow all humans and obliterate the robots that protect them. He used his technology-manipulating speakers to summon all nearby labor-robots to convert them into his new Transformer body while using his stereo-system to spark a robot-revolution against their \"human-oppressors.\" All automated forms of public transportation stopped and the city's labor robots jumped the Autobots when they appeared on the scene. After failing to convince Bulkhead into joining him and killing Sari in the name of all robot-kind, it appeared that Bulkhead destroyed Soundwave with a single blow of his powerful wrecking-ball arm, shattering his body into hundreds of pieces. However, unknown to the Autobot, his core survived, in the form of a small, almost-invisible media player.\n\nSoundwave regenerated at Christmas time as ex-Sumdac Systems Vice President Porter C. Powell, who had acquired Soundwave's original patents while he was in charge of the company, was distributing multiple Soundwave toys during the Christmas season. Soundwave managed to reprogram some of the toys, using one of them to spike the Autobots' oil nog. With the Autobots now sedated and out of commission, Soundwave proceeded to take them to the basement where he attempted to brainwash them into taking on his ideology as Decepticons by placing them in a virtual program in human form. However, the plan was briefly halted by the attempted intervention of Sari as well as the Autobots learning the truth of where they are. Soundwave had a backup plan, using Laserbeak to force Sari into a retreat, then using Ratbat in keytar mode to complete the Autobots' reformat. Soundwave succeeded in placing the Autobots under his control, and used the numerous toy replicas of himself to take control of the humans in Detroit. However, since Sari was techno-organic, she was immune to the mind-control waves. Soundwave was defeated when Sari recruited the help of Scrapper, Snarl and Wreck-Gar to fight the brainwashed Autobots, and was smashed apart along with Ratbat by Optimus using Laserbeak's guitar mode as a makeshift axe. Though Soundwave's core still remained intact, it was eventually turned off by Sari before being rescued by Laserbeak. It is unknown what became of Soundwave after that.\n\n\nThis Soundwave is an alternate good version of the Generation 1 character from the BotCon exclusive \"Shattered Glass\" comic, in which the Decepticons are on the side of good and the Autobots on the side of evil. His appearance is based on the white music label Soundwave MP3 player, while Buzzsaw seems to be based on Steeljaw in appearance.\n\nSoundwave first appears as a member of Megatron's forces in the \"Transformers: Timelines\" story \"Shattered Glass\" story by Fun Publications. He helps in the attack on the Autobot's Ark launching platform, working with Buzzsaw.\n\nSoundwave makes a cameo in the fiction \"Dungeons & Dinobots\", a text based story. When the Autobots are gaining the advantage in an attack on the Arch-Ayr fuel dump he calls in the Mayhem Suppression Squad to help the Decepticons.\n\nSoundwave appears in the story \"Do Over\". He is among the crew of the \"Nemesis\", which follows the Autobot's Ark to Earth. When the ship is damaged in battle with the Ark he escapes in a stasis pod to Earth.\n\nSoundwave is spotlighted in the story \"The Desert Heat!\". In this story, having crashed to Earth in an escape pod, Heatwave recovers Soundwave and helps his fellow Decepticon get back online and assume an Earth-style alternate mode.\n\nSoundwave appears in the story \"Eye in the Sky\". Cliffjumper, Crasher, Frenzy, Heatwave, Ravage and Soundwave are sent on a mission to Burpleson Air Force Base to stop the Autobots from controlling the GODS defense system. Heatwave uses his powers to convince the GODS transmitter to fire the weapon on itself and stop the Autobots from taking control.\n\nSoundwave is spotlighted in the story \"Blitzwing Bop\". The Elite Guardsman Thunderwing intercepts a radio signal from Earth which mentions Soundwave. Finding Soundwave is wanted for a minor offense from long ago he heads to Earth. Thunderwing finds Soundwave involved in a battle the Autobot Blaster for the possession of the malfunctioning Decepticon Blitzwing. Although not interested in the dispute, Soundwave convinces Thunderwing that Soundwave cannot leave Earth for trial on Cybertron until his commanding officer can be notified, and the only way to get Starscream online is to rescue Blitzwing. Thunderwing is still unwilling to takes sides in the battle against Blaster, merely following the Decepticon, but Soundwave tricks Blaster into mentioning a crime he committed on Cybertron while Thunderwing is in nearby. Thunderwing immediately goes into arrest mode and tries to capture Blaster, but Blaster escapes in a malfunctioning Stellar Spanner. With Starscream back online Soundwave confesses to his minor crimes and Thunderwing passes a sentence of community service on him.\n\nAn official toy exists, as part of the SG Blaster Vs SG Soundwave box-set, and is a repaint of the G1 Soundblaster toy (itself, a retool of the G1 Soundwave toy). In addition, the white Music Label Soundwave figure matches his colors almost exactly, save for the Decepticon symbol on his chest, and has been officially repurposed as one of this character's forms.\n\n\nSoundwave was a gladiator around the same time as Megatron. He has many pet Mini-Cons who work for him, particularly Laserbeak.\n\nSoundwave is one of the main group of Decepticons in the 2011 computer animated series \"\". Unlike his previous incarnations, Soundwave chooses not to speak with his own voice, but instead records archive audio and video from other sources and repeats it when needed, displaying it on his face, which is composed entirely of an electronic screen. The fact that Soundwave does not speak by choice is indicated in an interview with producer Jeff Kline. He is armed with two cables that extend from his chest that have an electrical appendage on each end that have a variety of uses, and he has integrated ground bridge/space bridge controls. He is rarely seen in combat, spending most of his time supporting the Decepticons as communications officer and technical specialist, but has shown himself to be a very proficient fighter when circumstances demand it, displaying not only extraordinary fighting skills, but also the expert use of Laserbeak, his electric cables, and even his ground bridge/space bridge controls as effective weapons against his enemies.\n\nWhen Soundwave speaks, he sounds like his G1 counterpart, only with his voice distortion slightly less enhanced, thus sounding more human than robotic.\n\nIn the \"Darkness Rising\" 5 part mini-series, Soundwave detects the presence of Arcee, so Starscream sends a pair of Decepticons to attack her. Later, Soundwave detects a signal from deep space, which he is certain is Megatron, so the Space Bridge is opened, and Megatron returns. Later, Soundwave deploys Laserbeak at Starscream's orders to capture Fowler in order to locate the Autobot base. He is later assigned to highjack an Earth bond radio telescope array to location of Cybertron, as part Megatron's plan to use their Space Bridge to transport Dark Energon to Cybertron. However the Autobot's young human allies figure out the Decepticons have highjacked the array and go to the array to shut it down. The young computer wiz Raf hacks into the array computer system, and Soundwave attacks them. He cuts the array's main line locking the dishes in place. While preparing to leave, the Autobots human ally Miko takes a picture of Soundwave with her cell phone, Soundwave responds to this by taking a picture of Jack, Miko, and Raf (possibly with the intention of passing it along with information of their connection with the Autobots onto his fellow Decepticons).\n\nSoundwave is well aware of Starscream's treachery against Megatron, and on several occasions saved Megatron from his treacherous lieutenant. In \"Masters & Students\", Soundwave sent Laserbeak to make sure that Starscream retrieved the incapacitated Megatron from the Space Bridge wreckage while he witnesses Optimus' battle with Skyquake. In \"Sick Mind\" when Starscream and Knock Out conspire to euthanize the comatose Megatron, Soundwave at first appears to consider agreeing with the two, but points out the cord of Bumblebee's cortical psychic patch Bumblebee is hooked up to, and orders Megatron be put back online so that he will not have fallen by an Autobot's hand.\n\nIn \"Rock Bottom\" Megatron reveals he is aware of Starscream's ongoing treachery due to Soundwave having constant surveillance on the traitor and relaying his attempts of usurping him.\n\nIn \"One Shall Rise\" Pt. 3, Airachnid is placed in temporary command of the Decepticons when Megatron leaves to aid Optimus in defeating Unicron. In an attempt to secure her power for good, and to escape Unicron's wrath, Airachnid suggests that the Decepticons leave Megatron to continue their efforts on another world. Soundwave, being eternally loyal to Megatron, vetoed her orders and displayed unexpected combat skills to secure the ship for when Megatron returned. It is implied that, although Megatron is made aware of Airachnid's attempted grab for power, he does not punish her until Soundwave reminds him of her treachery in the season 2 episode \"Crossfire\".\n\nIn \"Orion Pax\" Pt. 1, Megatron orders Soundwave to remove Arcee from the ship after she broke in to try to rescue Optimus Prime. Soundwave manages to open a ground bridge to bridge her off, right before Orion saw her.\n\nIn \"Triage\", Soundwave hunts for an ancient Cybertronian relic. Having lost his minion Laserbeak, he continues the search on his own, fighting Wheeljack to claim the relic, the Resonance Blaster and defeat Wheeljack before he reclaims Laserbeak. He returns to the Nemesis with Megatron's prize, and is highly praised for it by Megatron, putting Knock Out and Dreadwing to shame who lost their relics to Arcee, Bumblebee and Starscream.\n\nIn \"Hard Knocks\", Soundwave captured Smokescreen and brought him on board the \"Nemesis\" after the Decepticons learned that Smokescreen was a clue to finding the final Omega Key.\n\nIn \"Regeneration\" and \"Darkest Hour\", Soundwave, along with Starscream and Knock Out, captured the children and held them for ransom unless the Autobots gave the Omega Keys to the Decepticons. However, when Optimus Prime destroyed the Omega Lock (and the Keys with them), Soundwave retreated back to the \"Nemesis\" with the other Decepticons.\n\nIn \"Darkmount, NV\", when Jack and Arcee were spotted in Jasper following the destruction of the Autobot base, Soundwave sent Laserbeak, along with two Vehicons, to terminate them. However, after Laserbeak was destroyed, Soundwave was unable to retrieve any surveillance footage from his remains.\n\nIn \"Scattered\" and \"Prey\", Soundwave was present when Shockwave presented Predaking to Megatron.\n\nIn \"Rebellion\", when Starscream sent out members of his armada to investigate a number of Autobot signals, Soundwave pointed out to him that their army was thinly spread and suggested that the Autobots were using the \"Harbinger\" as a base of operations. He later retreated with the other Decepticons as Darkmount was destroyed by Optimus Prime, aided by Agent Fowler and several Air Force pilots.\n\nIn \"Thirst\", he oversees the destruction of the mutant Terrorcons and is confronted by a newly freed Airachnid and her army of minions. When she charges him he opens a space bridge to one of Cybertron's moons stranding her and her minions.\n\nIn \"Minus One\", Soundwave is taken captive by the Autobots and questioned for information regarding Megatron's motives. However, Soundwave erases all the data of Megatron's plans before Optimus gives Ratchet approval to crack him open. The normally mute Decepticon then taunts the Autobots in his own voice before deactivating. Later, Laserbeak attacks the Autobot base and hooks up with Soundwave, reactivating him and giving him a new copy of Megatron's plans. He then proceeds to incapacitate Bulkhead and Smokescreen before kidnapping Ratchet and bringing him to the Nemesis.\n\nIn \"Deadlock\", Soundwave fights Jack and Miko (who is in the Apex armor) on the bridge of the Nemesis. With help from Raf, Jack and Miko trap Soundwave in the Shadowzone.\n\nSoundwave returns from the Shadowzone in the tenth episode of the second season of the stand-alone sequel series \"\". He escapes, trapping Bumblebee in the Shadowzone. Then, he quickly immobilizes most of the Autobots before getting tricked by Fixit and the humans into letting Bumblebee back in. The Autobots corner Soundwave and throw him back into the Shadowzone.\nHowever, he returns in the third and final season, subtitled \"Combiner Force\", as a major antagonist, with a new body armor. In \"Collateral Damage\", his plan failed when he was defeated by Optimus Prime who was upgraded with Hi-Test.\n\nSoundwave appears in the novel \"\". He was one of Megatronus's opponents and nearly defeated him, however this instead brought respect between the two. Soundwave commanded the Mini-Cons Ravage, Rumble, Frenzy, and Laserbeak, and joined Megatron as one of the Decepticons.\n\nSoundwave appears in the short story \"Bumblebee at Tyger Pax\" by Alex Irvine.\n\nSoundwave appears in the novels \"\" and \"\".\n\nSoundwave appears in the 2010 video game \"\" as a playable character in the last three chapters of the Decepticon campaign. While is established as 's second-in-command, Soundwave is shown acting as Megatron's right hand during the campaign in Shockwave's absence.\n\nSoundwave assists Megatron and Breakdown into infiltrating Iacon, defeating Zeta Prime, and hunting down Omega Supreme. He is also a boss in the Autobot campaign, being the warden of Kaon Prison in the Decepticons' capital city and using his tape cassettes Frenzy, Rumble and Laserbeak to attack. The Autobots manage to defeat him, but not before he delivers a fatal blow to Zeta Prime, absorbing what remained of his life force energy in order to regenerate his own strength, and then manages to escape before Optimus can finish him.\n\nAside from transforming into a Cybertronian truck, Soundwave can also turn into a boombox, as shown right before his boss battle, in the game's ending credits and a GameStop promotional commercial for the game featuring Shockwave. In this mode, he plays the Stan Bush songs \"The Touch\" and \"Till All Are One\".\n\nIn the sequel game \"\"; Soundwave is playable in two levels. The first time is in Chapter 9 in which he rebuilds Megatron after he was destroyed by Metroplex. The other level is the final one in which Soundwave boards the \"Ark\" and helps destroy the Ark's defenses. Rumble and Laserbeak assist Soundwave in these tasks. He pops up throughout the rest of the game as an NPC.\n\n\n\n\n"}

For this masque, the English composer Sir Edward Elgar wrote the music as his Op. 66, with a libretto by Henry Hamilton. The masque consisted of two tableaux: 'The Cities of Ind' and 'Ave Imperator!'.\n\nThe masque was first performed at the Coliseum Theatre in London on 11 March 1912. Elgar composed twelve pieces for contralto, bass, chorus and orchestra:\n\nTableau I: The Cities of Ind\n\nTableau II: Ave Imperator!\n\nThe London Coliseum programme for the first week of the performance shows that \"The Crown of India\" masque was the most important of the eleven acts in the show. There were two \"Tableaux\": \"The Cities of Ind\" and \"Ave Imperator!\". The programme listed the cast, who personified 'India' herself, England represented by 'St. George', and various Indian cities. There were also attendant performers, in elaborate costumes, personifying other roles. Elgar attended the daily rehearsals for two weeks, then conducted the hour-long show two performances a day for a further two weeks.\n\nElgar later extracted five of the pieces – 1(a), 2, 5, 8 and 4 – and added an intermezzo for solo violin to create The Crown of India Suite. The first performance was at the Hereford Festival on 11 September 1912, by the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by the composer. The Suite gained immediate popularity: during Elgar's lifetime, there were 102 live performances of it on the BBC.\n\nThe Crown of India March from the incidental music for the masque is also performed separately.\n\nThe complete score for the \"Crown of India\" incidental music was only published in a piano-vocal version by Elgar's friend Hugh Blair. The remaining orchestral parts were destroyed in the 1960s. In 2007 the Elgar Society commissioned the composer Anthony Payne to complete the orchestration of the music for \"The Crown of India\". Payne is to \"complete the scoring of the piano-vocal version and combining this, where appropriate, with the orchestral suite and march.\"\n\nA fine recording exists as part of The Great British Collection. Douglas Bostock conducts The Munich Symphony Orchestra.\n\n\n"}

The first title in the series, \"Euro Truck Simulator\", was released on 29 August 2008 for Microsoft Windows and OS X and the first European-truck simulation established gameplay. The sequel to \"Euro Truck Simulator\", \"Euro Truck Simulator 2\", was released on 19 October 2012 for Microsoft Windows and in 2013 for Linux.\n\nThe first \"Euro Truck Simulator\" was released on 29 August 2008 for Microsoft Windows and OS X and the first European-developed truck simulation of the games. Players choose their starting country from Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom (versions 1.2 and 1.3 only). Initially, players only have access to their starting country, except if it contains less than three cities, in which this case one or more adjacent countries will be accessible as well. For example, if a player starts the game in Italy or Switzerland, they get connection to the other for free. From there, players choose their first truck with a budget of €100,000.\n\nAfter this, players can start taking jobs from various fictitious companies and delivering cargo to various cities in their starting country to earn money. This money can then be spent on a new truck, upgrading the current truck, expanding the business to other countries, and obtaining a license to drive flammables and chemicals.\n\nThe game features European truck models with working instruments such as flashing indicators, temperature and low fuel warning lights, wipers, and gauges. The trucks included are fictionalized variants of the Mercedes-Benz Actros (known as Majestic), the Renault Magnum (known as Runner), the Scania R-series (known as Swift), and the Volvo FH16 (known as Valiant).\n\nThe direct sequel to the \"Euro Truck Simulator\", \"Euro Truck Simulator 2\", was released on 19 October 2012 for Microsoft Windows and in 2013 for Linux. Players choose their starting city from various locations in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary (in the \"Going East!\" extension), Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nAt first, the player can only take what are known as quick jobs. These quick jobs involve the delivery of trailers and goods from one factory (garage) to another (usually involves delivery between different town and states). This quick jobs are offered by logistics and delivery companies in the game and all fuel, servicing, and highway toll fees and costs are paid by the employer (the delivery companies). Therefore, when doing quick jobs, no paying of tolls, fuel, and servicing fees are required. As the player earns money or takes out bank loans, they can eventually afford to buy themselves a truck, which they can buy from truck dealers and truck showrooms (note that the truck dealers and showrooms must be 'discovered' first). With enough money, players can acquire a home garage, and start making more money by delivering cargo using their own truck instead of just being a driver for hire (freight market). Money earned in the game can be spent on upgrading or purchasing new trucks, hiring NPC drivers to take on deliveries (relevant employment agency must be 'discovered' first), buying more garages, and expanding the home garage to accommodate more trucks and bus.\n\nThe player gains experience points after each delivery which increases the player's level, and a skill point is awarded after each level-up. Skill points can be used to unlock deliveries that require different ADR classes, longer distance deliveries, special cargo loads, fragile cargo loads, urgent deliveries, and eco-driving. This progression allows the player to take on better-paying jobs.\n\nThe game features seventy-seven cities in thirteen countries, over twenty types of cargo, and over fifteen fictional European companies.\n\nThe game included two new truck companies, Scania and Renault Trucks, with MAN returning from the original game. DAF, Iveco, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo trucks were not officially licensed and had their names changed to DAV, Ivedo, Majestic, and Valiant, respectively. Later updates included the official license for DAF, Iveco, and Volvo, and the official branding for the DAF XF, Volvo FH16, and Iveco Stralis. In January 2013 SCS Software announced a downloadable content package called \"Going East!\", expanding the game map into Eastern Europe. The DLC saw the introduction of thirteen new cities across Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and a new country, Hungary, and was released in September 2013. Unusually, Mercedes-Benz did not want their name to be in \"Euro Truck Simulator 2\", and are still referred to as \"Majestic\". The Mercedes-Benz license was added to the game with version 1.18.1.\n\n\"American Truck Simulator\" takes place in North America, and will feature over 100 cities. The game features American-style conventional trucks, instead of the European cab over trucks found in the previous two games, and was released on 2 February 2016.\n\n"}
{"id": "21000608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21000608", "title": "Turkey bowling", "text": "Turkey bowling\n\nTurkey bowling is a sport which is based on ordinary bowling: a frozen turkey serves as a bowling ball and 10 plastic bottles of soft drinks or water are the bowling pins. The turkey is bowled down a smooth surface, for example, ice or a soap covered sheet of painters plastic (using a bar of soap). It is commonly associated with Thanksgiving.\nTurkey bowling is popular in minor league ice hockey in the United States and Canada.\n\nThe original variant involves turkey bowling in an aisle of a grocery store. A Derrick Johnson claims to have invented turkey bowling in 1988 when he worked as a grocery clerk at a Newport Beach Lucky's branch, while observing a manager slide a frozen turkey across the floor and accidentally topple a soda bottle.\n\nDerrick became a self-appointed commissioner of the \"Poultry Bowlers Association\" and codified the rules and terminology, such as \"the fowl line\" (cf. \"foul line\"), \"the gobbler\" (three strikes in a row; cf. turkey (bowling)), \"the Butterball\" (a gutterball) and \"the wishbone\" (a 7-10 split).\n\nTurkey bowling was featured in the 1995 novel \"Bloodsucking Fiends: A Love Story\" by Christopher Moore, where it was the favorite sport of \"The Animals\", a wild group of night grocery stockers (continued in the sequels \"You Suck: A Love Story\" and \"\").\n\nEpisode 14 of \"10 Items or Less\" TV series was \"Turkey Bowling\".\n\nThe \"Guy's Grocery Games\" episode \"Frozen Food Fight\" featured a round where two contestants bowled a frozen turkey at nine soda bottles; the combined number knocked down was the number of non-frozen items each was allowed to use in their next dish.\n\nEvery Thanksgiving morning, Cleveland's Fox affiliate WJW-TV does its annual Turkey Bowl from a Giant Eagle store in the Greater Cleveland, Ohio area. The WJW version of turkey bowling uses 15 cans of canned cranberry sauce, stacked in a pyramid shape, and uses a one-bowl-per-round knockout tournament format. In the 2010 edition it was hosted by morning features and man about town reporter Kenny Crumpton and morning meteorologist Angelica Campos. In WJW-TV's version people win prizes anything ranging from Giant Eagle Gift Cards to monetary prizes. The contest is broadcast on WJW live and streamed around the world on WJW's Web site, with the contests taking up the full closing segment (around 7 minutes) of each half-hour of WJW's morning newscast. The broadcast began in 1999.\n\nAnimal rights proponents, who oppose the use of animals in sports, claim that turkey bowling is disrespectful to animals and sends mixed messages which may encourage violence to animals or people. Another objection is perceived disrespect to the central attribute of Thanksgiving. In 2003, an upcoming event for the title of UK Great Turkey Bowling Champion at Manchester Evening News Arena was protested against by animal rights campaigners; as a result, plastic turkeys were used instead of real frozen turkeys. In 2007 an animal sanctuary rescued a live turkey, which was in a cage, from a turkey bowling event in New York State.\n"}
{"id": "326433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=326433", "title": "Variety show", "text": "Variety show\n\nVariety shows, also known as variety arts or variety entertainment, is entertainment made up of a variety of acts including musical performances, sketch comedy, magic, acrobatics, juggling, and ventriloquism. It is normally introduced by a compère (master of ceremonies) or host. The variety format made its way from Victorian era stage to radio and then television. Variety shows were a staple of anglophone television from the late 1940s into the 1980s.\n\nWhile still widespread in some parts of the world, such as in the United Kingdom with the \"Royal Variety Performance\", the proliferation of multichannel television and evolving viewer tastes have affected the popularity of variety shows in the United States. Despite this, their influence has still had a major effect on late night television whose late night talk shows and NBC's variety series \"Saturday Night Live\" (which originally premiered in 1975) have remained popular fixtures of North American television.\n\nThe live entertainment style known as music hall in the United Kingdom and vaudeville in the United States can be considered a direct predecessor of the \"variety show\" format. Variety in the UK evolved in theatres and music halls, and later in Working Men's Clubs. British performers who honed their skills in music hall sketches include Charlie Chaplin, Stan Laurel, George Formby, Gracie Fields, Dan Leno, Gertrude Lawrence and Marie Lloyd. Most of the early top performers on British television and radio did an apprenticeship either in stage variety, or during World War II in Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA). In the UK, the ultimate accolade for a variety artist for decades was to be asked to do the annual Royal Command Performance at the London Palladium theatre, in front of the monarch. Later known as the \"Royal Variety Performance\" (from 1919), it continues today. In the 1940s, Stan Laurel revisited his music hall days when he performed at the \"Royal Variety\" show.\n\nIn the United States, former vaudeville performers such as the Marx Brothers, George Burns and Gracie Allen, W. C. Fields, and Jack Benny honed their skills in the Borscht Belt before moving to talkies, to radio shows, and then to television shows, including variety shows.\n\nVariety shows were among the first programs to be featured on television during the experimental mechanical television era. Variety shows hosted by Helen Haynes and Harriet Lee are recorded in contemporary newspapers in 1931 and 1932; because of technical limits of the era, no recordings of either show have been preserved. The genre proliferated during the Golden Age of Television, generally considered to be roughly 1948 to 1960. Many of these Golden Age variety shows were spinoffs of previous radio variety shows.\n\nFrom 1948 to 1971, \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" was one of CBS's most popular television series. Using his no-nonsense approach, host Ed Sullivan was instrumental in bringing many acts to prominence in the United States, including Elvis Presley and The Beatles. \"The Lawrence Welk Show\" (1955-1982) would go on to become one of U.S. television's longest-running variety shows; based on the concept of the big band remote from the old-time radio era, it was already one of the last shows of its kind when it debuted and far outlasted all other big-band centered broadcast series by the end of its run.\n\nOther long-running American variety shows that premiered during this time include \"Texaco Star Theatre\" (1948-1956), \"Cavalcade of Stars\", later titled \"The Jackie Gleason Show\" (1949-1955), \"The Garry Moore Show\" (1950-1967, in various incarnations), \"The Colgate Comedy Hour\" (1950-1955), \"Your Show of Shows\" (1950-1954), \"The Red Skelton Show\" (1951-1971), \"The Dinah Shore Show\" (1951-1957), \"The George Gobel Show\" (1954-1960) and \"The Dinah Shore Chevy Show\" (1956-1963). Perry Como also hosted a series of variety shows that collectively ran from 1948 to 1969, followed by variety specials that ran until 1994.\n\nShorter-lived variety shows during this period include \"The Frank Sinatra Show\" (1950-1952), \"The Jimmy Durante Show\" (1954-1956) and a different \"The Frank Sinatra Show\" (1957-1958).\n\nIn the UK, \"The Good Old Days\"—which ran from 1953 to 1983—featured modern artists performing dressed in late Victorian/Early Edwardian costume, either doing their own act or performing as a music hall artist of that period. The audience was also encouraged to dress in period costume in a similar fashion. Other long-running British variety shows that originated in the 1950s include \"Tonight at the London Palladium\" (1955-1969), \"The Black and White Minstrel Show\" (1958-1978), \"The White Heather Club\" (1958-1968) and \"Royal Variety Performance\" (an annual event televised since the 1950s).\n\nPopular American variety shows that began in the 60s include a revival of \"The Jackie Gleason Show\" (1960-1970), \"The Andy Williams Show\" (1962-1971), \"The Danny Kaye Show\" (1963-1967), \"The Hollywood Palace\" (1964-1970), \"The Dean Martin Show\" (1965-1974), \"The Carol Burnett Show\" (1967-1978) and \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\" (1967-1969). 1969 saw a flurry of new variety shows with rural appeal: \"The Johnny Cash Show\" (1969-1971), \"The Jim Nabors Hour\" (1969-1971), \"The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour\" (1969-1972) and \"Hee Haw\" (1969-1992).\n\nEntertainers with less successful variety shows in the 1960s include Judy Garland and Sammy Davis Jr.\n\nIn 1970 and 1971, the American TV networks, CBS especially, conducted the so-called \"rural purge\", in which shows that appealed to more rural and older audiences were cancelled as part of a greater focus on appealing to wealthier demographics. Many variety shows, including long-running ones, were cancelled as part of this \"purge,\" with a few shows (such as \"Hee Haw\" and \"The Lawrence Welk Show\") surviving and moving into first-run syndication. Variety shows continued to be produced in the 1970s, with most of them stripped down to only music and comedy.\n\nPopular variety shows that ran in the 1970s include \"The Flip Wilson Show\" (1970-1974), \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour\" (1971-1976, in various incarnations), \"The Bobby Goldsboro Show\" (1973-1975), \"The Midnight Special\" (1973-1981), \"Don Kirshner's Rock Concert\" (1973-1981), \"The Mac Davis Show\" (1974-1976), \"Tony Orlando and Dawn\" (1974-1976), \"Donny & Marie\" (1976-1979) and \"Sha Na Na\" (1977-1981).\n\nEntertainers with weekly variety shows that ran for one season or less in the 1970s include Captain & Tennille, The Jacksons, The Keane Brothers, Bobby Darin, Mary Tyler Moore, Julie Andrews, Dolly Parton, Shields and Yarnell, The Manhattan Transfer, Starland Vocal Band, and the cast of \"The Brady Bunch\".\n\nEntertainers with variety-based TV specials in the 70s include The Carpenters, John Denver, Shirley MacLaine and Diana Ross.\n\nBy the late 1970s, nearly every variety show had ended production, in part because of audience burnout; the highest-rated variety show of 1975, \"Cher\", was only the 22nd-most watched show of the year..\n\nBy the early 1980s, the few new variety shows being produced were of remarkably poor quality (see, for instance, the infamous \"Pink Lady and Jeff\"), hastening the format's demise. Since \"Pink Lady\", only a few traditional variety shows have been attempted by major networks: these include \"Dolly\" (starring Dolly Parton), which ran for 23 episodes on the ABC during the 1987–'88 season; a revival of \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\" from 1988 to 1989; a revival of \"The Carol Burnett Show\", which was broadcast by CBS for nine episodes in 1991; and the first incarnation of \"The Wayne Brady Show\", which was telecast by ABC in August 2001.\n\nBy the 21st century, the variety show format had fallen out of fashion, due largely to changing tastes and the fracturing of media audiences (caused by the proliferation of cable and satellite television) that makes a multiple-genre variety show impractical. Even reruns of variety shows have generally not been particularly widespread; TV Land telecasted briefly some variety shows (namely \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" and \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour\") upon its beginning in 1996, but within a few years, reruns of most of those shows (with the notable exception of \"The Flip Wilson Show\") stopped. Similarly, CMT held the rights to \"Hee Haw\" but telecast very few episodes, opting mainly to hold rights to allow them to air performance videos from the show in its video blocks. The current rights holder of \"Hee Haw\", RFD-TV, has been more prominent in its telecasts of the show; RFD-TV also airs numerous other country-style variety shows from the 1960s and 1970s up through the present day, in a rarity for modern television. Another notable exception is \"The Lawrence Welk Show\", which has been telecast continually in reruns on the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) since 1986. \"The Danny Kaye Show\" returned to television in 2017 with reruns on Jewish Life Television (and, in the case of a one-off Christmas special, the Christian-leaning network INSP); JLTV also carries other classic comedy/variety series by Jewish comics in its schedule. Digital multicast network getTV shows variety shows on an irregular basis. The Spanish language variety show \"Sabado Gigante\", which began in 1962, and then moved from Chile to the United States in 1986, continued to produce and broadcast new episodes on Univision until its cancellation in September 2015.\n\nAt least one national variety show continues on national radio: \"Live from Here\", a musical variety series hosted by Chris Thile. It has followed three formats over the course of its history, the first and longest being that of \"A Prairie Home Companion\"; founding host Garrison Keillor created the series in 1974 as an homage to rural radio variety shows, featuring sketch comedy based on radio dramas of the old-time radio era, complete with faux commercials. (The other format, \"The American Radio Company of the Air\", also hosted and created by Keillor, was set in a more urban environment and likewise was based on old-time radio; its short run in the late 1980s eventually morphed into a revival of \"A Prairie Home Companion\"). \"Live from Here\", which was established in its current format in 2016 and took on its name a year later after losing the rights to the \"A Prairie Home Companion\" name, focuses mainly on musical acts.\n\nFox's \"Osbournes Reloaded\", a variety show featuring the family of rocker Ozzy Osbourne, was canceled after only one episode had been telecast in 2009. More than two dozen affiliates refused to telecast the first episode of the show. This series had been slated for a six-episode run.\n\nNBC has made repeated attempts at reviving the variety format since the late 2000s (its last successful series in this genre, \"Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters\", left the network's schedule in 1982) . A pilot episode for \"Rosie Live\" was telecast the day before Thanksgiving Day in 2008 and, after receiving middling ratings and extremely poor reviews, was not picked up for its originally planned run in January 2009. In May 2014, NBC aired \"The Maya Rudolph Show\", a variety show starring \"SNL\" performer Maya Rudolph. Like \"Rosie Live\", the broadcast was intended to be a one-off special, but with the possibility of additional episodes depending on its performance. The special won its time slot, due mainly to a strong lead-in, and spawned the May 2016 premiere of \"Maya & Marty\", adding fellow \"SNL\" cast member Martin Short. Earlier that season, NBC aired \"Best Time Ever\", an adaptation of the British variety game show \"Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway\" starring actor Neil Patrick Harris which was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nStarting in the 1950s, some entertainers became associated with variety television specials that would reoccur on a regular basis, in some cases for decades. Such entertainers included Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Perry Como, Andy Williams and Mitzi Gaynor. Many of these were Christmas variety specials, which often showed the star in a set meant to look like their home, welcoming singers and other guests to perform duets of Christmas songs. The popularity of these Christmas shows outlasted that of weekly variety shows. In 1973, for example, even as variety shows were starting to fade in popularity, variety Christmas specials hosted by Williams and Como both attracted an enormous 40% of the American television audience. Christmas variety specials' popularity continued into the 1990s, before starting to wane in the 2000s. Nevertheless, the tradition has continued. Entertainers who have hosted Christmas variety specials in the 21st century include Kid Rock, Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson, Carrie Underwood, Lady Gaga, Michael Buble, Bill Murray and Gwen Stefani.\n\nThough the format faded in popularity in prime time, it thrived in late night. Night-time variety shows eventually evolved into late-night talk shows, which combine variety entertainment (primarily comedy and live music) with the aspects of a talk show (such as interviews with celebrities). The Emmy Awards academy considers the two genres to be related closely enough that, until 2015, the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series was open to any of these types of show; in 2015, the academy separated late-night talk shows and sketch comedy series into separate categories.\n\nDuring Johnny Carson's tenure on \"The Tonight Show\" on NBC from 1962 to 1992, the show dominated late night ratings, and the other networks attempted late-night talk shows only sporadically. This changed with Carson's retirement, and other networks began to air their own talk show competitors, starting with \"Late Show with David Letterman\" on CBS in 1993. As of 2014, late-night talk shows vary widely on their resemblance to the original variety format, with Jimmy Fallon's incarnation of \"The Tonight Show\" putting heavy emphasis on sketches and stunts, while shows such as \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" put more emphasis on desk chat.\n\n\"The Richard Bey Show\" combined the variety show with the tabloid talk show, not only having its guests talk about their problems but also having them participate in absurdist games, and \"Sally Jesse Raphael\" was known for occasionally having music and fashion in the show, especially drag and gender-bending performances.\n\nSketch comedy series such as \"Saturday Night Live\", \"In Living Color\", \"Almost Live!\" (and its successor \"Up Late NW\"), \"MADtv\", and \"SCTV\" also contain variety show elements, particularly musical performances and comedy sketches. The most obvious difference between shows such as \"Saturday Night Live\" and traditional variety shows is the lack of a single lead host (or hosts) and a large ensemble cast. \"SNL\" has used different guest hosts ever since its inception.\n\nTelevised talent shows have a variety show element, in that they feature a variety of different acts. Examples of talent shows that feature entertainers from a broad variety of disciplines include \"Star Search\", which had a run in the 1980s in syndication and a run on CBS in the early 2000s during the reality television boom; \"The Gong Show\", which reached its peak in the 1970s but has had occasional revivals since then; and the worldwide \"Got Talent\" franchise.\n\nThe variety show format also continued in the form of the telethon, which feature variety entertainment (often music) interspersed with appeals for viewers to make donations to support a charity or cause. The \"Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon\" was one of the best known telethons in the US, but it too was eventually canceled after several years of shortening (originally over 21 hours, by the time of its last telecast in 2014, by which point Lewis had been gone from the telethon several years, it was down to two hours). Another popular telethon, for United Cerebral Palsy, ended its run in 1998 shortly after the death of its founder and figurehead, Dennis James. Likewise, only a handful of long-established local telethons remain.\n\nThe prime time variety show format was popular in the early decades of Australian television, spawning such series as \"In Melbourne Tonight\", \"The Graham Kennedy Show\", \"The Don Lane Show\", and \"Hey Hey It's Saturday\", which ran for 27 years. Recent prime time variety shows include the short lived \"Micallef Tonight\" and \"The Sideshow\".\n\nAnother of today's variety shows in Asia is Taiwan's \"Guess (variety show)\" and \"100% Entertainment\". East Asian variety programs are known for its constant use of sound effects, on-screen visuals and comedic bantering. Many of the shows are presented in a live-like presentation in a fast-paced setting, with scenes repeating or fast forwarded.\n\nAnother popular variety show in Taiwan is Kangxi Lai Le, a talk show with variety show elements. The hosts and guests were associated with variety shows. Famous for its bantering, which was written before tapings.\n\nThe first Chinese variety show to become a major success was Hong Kong's \"Enjoy Yourself Tonight\", which first aired in 1967 and ran for 27 years. In Hong Kong, variety shows are often combined with elements of a cooking show or a talent competition but end in various results.\n\nVariety programming has remained one of the dominant genres of television programming. While Japanese variety shows are famous abroad for their wild stunts, they vary from talk shows to music shows, from tabloid news shows to skit comedy. The prominent use of telop on screen has created a style that has influenced variety programming across Asia. One of the most popular variety shows in Japan includes \"Downtown no Gaki No Tsukai\".\n\nIn South Korea, the hugely popular show \"Infinite Challenge\", has been broadcast by MBC from 2005 to 2018, was a new model of this, called \"Real Variety Show\". It combined comedy and variety scenes including unscripted stunts. Although many variety shows have existed in Korea long before the broadcast of \"Infinite Challenge\", this program has given a rise to a new page in the history of Korean variety shows by introducing unscripted stunts. As a result, other broadcasting channels such as KBS and SBS have followed its path and introduced programs such as \"2 Days & 1 Night\" and \"Running Man\". These types of Korean variety shows are grabbing foreign interest of countries such as Japan, China, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and even the United States bringing on a new type of the Korean wave globally.\n\nVariety shows are a huge part of daily life in the Philippines, with all of the major networks running their own variety shows usually during lunchtime and can be on the air for between one and a half hours to three hours. The most notable Philippine variety show is the longest-running \"Eat Bulaga\", which premiered in 1979 and has aired on RPN, ABS-CBN, and GMA Network in the succeeding years. Recently many other TV networks are different formats of variety. \"It's Showtime\" has shown great popularity and interest to Filipino viewers.\n\n\"Siempre en Domingo\" premiered in 1969 with Raúl Velasco hosting. It became Mexico's longest-running variety series, remaining on Televisa until 1998. Other long-running variety shows, most of which have been Televisa productions, have included \"La Carabina de Ambrosio\", \"Anabel\", \"Al Fin de Semana\", \"Silvia y Enrique\", \"La Parodia\", \"Muevete\", \"Desmadruga2\", and \"Sabadazo.\". Most, if not all, of Televisa's variety shows have aired in other countries, including the Univision networks in the United States.\n\nIn Venezuela, the best known variety show is \"Súper Sábado Sensacional\". Originally established in 1968 (as \"Sábado Espectacular\") on Radio Caracas Television, the show moved to Venevision in 1970 and was renamed \"Sábado Sensacional\". In 1990, \"Súper\" was added to the title, and is how the show is currently known today.\n\nThe Spanish-language variety show known as \"Sábados Gigantes\" (forerunner of the U.S. \"Sábado Gigante\") began in 1962 with Don Francisco and lasted into the 1990s. His daughter, Vivianne Kreutzberger, currently hosts the program under the title \"Gigantes con Vivi\", while Don Francisco has hosted the U.S. version since April 12, 1986 until the end of the show's run on September 19, 2015.\n\n\n"}

Ski tournaments take place every winter in Gulmarg, Kashmir and Manali. Winter sports are generally more common in the northern states of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand (formerly Uttaranchal), Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. Skiing, snow rugby, snow cycling and snow football are few of the common sports played in India. Skiing is more popular although India has taken part in Luge in Winter Olympics since 1998. The Bandy Federation of India is headquarters are in Mandi in Himachal Pradesh. Luge is practiced in a big way by the mountain residents in an improvised form called 'Reri'.\n\nShiva Keshavan is the only Indian to have won medals in international meets in winter sports (Asian Gold 2011, Asian Silver 2009, Asian Bronze 2008, Asian Silver (Doubles) 2005, Asian Bronze (Singles) 2005), and to have participated in four Olympic Games. He is currently the Asian Speed record holder at 134.4 km/h, making him the fastest man in Asia on ice.\n\n Ski-mountaineering is another form of skiing, usually conducted in remote areas. It is sort of wilderness skiing. It is also called back country skiing. It was introduced in Kashmir in 1979 when two local skiers Muhammad Yusuf and Mehraj Din undertook a ski - touring expedition to Lidder Valley. In 1984 a team of 10 skiers, led by Muhammad Yusuf, undertook an expedition from Lidder Valley to Sindh Valley over Sunmous Pass. It is still a record. With the passage of time ski-mountaineering has become a competitive sports. Championships are conducted in Europe regularly"}
