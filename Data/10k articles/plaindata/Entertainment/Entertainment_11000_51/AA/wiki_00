Examples include \"So Long Dearie\" from \"Hello, Dolly!\", \"Rose's Turn\" from \"Gypsy\", and \"Work the Wound\" from \"Passing Strange\". It was so named because in the days when musical performances would start at 8:30 pm, this song would occur around 11:00 pm.\n\nAmong the theatre community, there is some debate as to the characteristics of an 11 o'clock number. It often signifies a moment of revelation or change in heart of a lead character, although there are exceptions to this. The 11 o'clock number is also differentiated from the finale in that it is not the final number in the show, but even this is not considered a requirement by some commenters.\n\nOther notable 11 o'clock numbers include \"Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat\" from \"Guys and Dolls\", \"Memory\" from \"Cats\", \"Brotherhood of Man\" from \"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\", \"Gimme Gimme\" from \"Thoroughly Modern Millie\", \"Another National Anthem\" from \"Assassins\", \"The American Dream\" from \"Miss Saigon\", \"I'm Here\" from \"The Color Purple\", and \"Always Starting Over\" from \"If/Then\".\n"}

After Sebastian viciously murders the doctors who delivered him, his mother (Sara Malakul Lane) realizes that there is something seriously wrong with the child (it is later revealed that he is the son of the devil). Over the course of the movie, Sebastian brutally murders many people and tragedy strikes many others.

Ward adapted the script from a 1982 novel of the same name by Newton Thornburg; this was the first novel by Thornburg used for a movie since \"Cutter's Way\" (1981). The film was shot on location in the Flinders Ranges.\n\nThe film premiered in June 2009 at the Sydney Film Festival and was released in limited release across Australia on 6 August 2009.\n\nWriter Ned Kendall, is returning to the remote and isolated family home inhabited by his sister Sally, to say goodbye to his father, Bruce, who is dying. Ned also brings his fiancée, Toni, who has trouble getting used to the isolation and harshness of rural Australia.\n\nNed starts reliving memories of his childhood, many involving his beautiful twin sister Kate, and his older brother Cliff. These memories awaken long-buried secrets from the family's past. He begins writing, and his fiancée reads that he had an awkward sexual encounter with Kate, and leaves him without giving him a chance to explain.\n\nKate continues to entice Ned despite his obvious revulsion, and after a drunken night out with friends, Ned goes for a swim in the family dam. He is joined by Kate, who seduces and subsequently has sex with him on the banks of the dam. Ned shows immediate remorse while Kate remains unperturbed.\n\nAfter Ned's refusal to have further sexual relations with Kate, Kate instigates a fight between the brothers by suggesting that Ned made unwanted advances towards her. As punishment, Bruce makes Ned accompany Kate to the Christmas dance. During the dance, Ned leaves Kate, and she is left to go home with Cliff. Ned leaves separately and on his way home he finds his sister's dead body in Cliff's crashed car, and then finds that Cliff has hanged himself.\n\nFearing that Ned will tell Bruce the truth about Kate, Sally reveals that she knew of Ned and Kate's secret. She also reveals that the car's clock stopped on impact of the crash and no one could figure out what took Kate and Cliff so long to get home from the dance. Sally speculates that Kate also had sexual relations with Cliff, who then crashed the car in which Kate died. She tells Ned she believes that Cliff's guilt from his part in Kate's death was multiplied knowing he had committed incest. But Bruce still believes that Kate was an innocent victim, the best of his children, and she doesn't want him shattered with the truth.\n\nNed then makes amends with Bruce and says that he is sorry for blaming him over Cliff's suicide. He doesn't tell Bruce the truth about Kate and lets him die still believing that Kate was everything he thought she was. Before he leaves, he tells Sally that Bruce died never knowing that she was his greatest achievement.\n\n\n\"Beautiful Kate\" was released in 29 theaters in Australia and grossed $1,065,656 at the box office. Until the debut of the Paul Hogan-starring \"Charlie & Boots\" in early September, \"Beautiful Kate\" held the title of the largest opening weekend for an Australian film for 2009.\n\nThe film holds an 83% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 30 reviews with an average rating of 6.8 out of 10. \"Beautiful Kate\" received four and a half stars from both Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton on \"At The Movies\". Sandra Hall of \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" rated it four and a half stars out of five and wrote, \"At times the action slows to the point where escape seems the most enticing option. Don't take it, for Ward's tough-minded and uniquely Australian version of Southern Gothic does reward your perseverance by at last making you care.\" Richard Kuipers of \"Variety\" called it \"a visually beautiful and emotionally rewarding study of a dying patriarch and his estranged son\". Megan Lehmann of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" described it as \"a provocative slice of Southern Gothic refried Aussie-style\". Frank Hatherley of \"Screen Daily\" wrote that it is a \"handsome and intense love story\" that is \"awash with Ward's own spiky, brittle dialogue, delivered with relish by her cast\". Philip French of \"The Guardian\" wrote, \"The film is well acted but both blunt and awkward.\" Also writing in \"The Guardian\", Steve Rose rated it two out of four stars and said that it \"doesn't do a great deal wrong, but despite broaching taboo subjects, feels too arthouse-by-numbers\".\n\n"}

Described by Guy Trebey of the Village Voice as the \"prototypical, pre-feminist, 1960s homemaker\", Maxwell has also been described as a composite of Doris Day, Mary Tyler Moore, Auntie Mame, That Girl and Donna Reed and came to prominence in the late '90s as the host of her eponymous television show on Public-access television cable TV in Manhattan.\n\nThe pilot for the original show was produced in 1996. The show debuted on Manhattan Neighborhood Network on January 1, 1998, and aired for five years featuring tips, recipes, entertaining ideas, craft projects, home renovation and interior design schemes. It was produced by Sander’s production company, V.R.U.S.P. Inc., and directed by Sander’s mother, Mary Jane Wells.\n\nIn 2001 Sander was contacted by Amy Briamonte, east coast director of development for west coast based Termite Art Productions (now Creative Differences Productions). Briamonte and Sander developed a pitch for the show for the Bravo network and received an order for a pilot. The pilot was produced in the summer of 2002 for a show titled Charming, Needs Work. The premise for the show was Maxwell lived in an apartment that she redecorated every week. After Bravo passed on the show Briamonte, Sander and Termite Art pitched it to Stephen Schwartz and Heather Moran, newly named VP’s of programming for the Style network. The pitch resulted in an order for a 13-episode season\n\nThe first season of The Brini Maxwell Show for the Style network was taped in the summer of 2003 with studio production taking place on the main stage at Unitel Studios on west 57th St. in New York City. Location shoots for the season were taped over a period of 6 months in New York City, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. The Brini Maxwell Show debuted on the Style network on Thursday, January 1, 2004 at 9pm.\n\nThe second season went into production in the summer of 2004 and debuted in November 2004. The show was cancelled after two seasons. Nevertheless, Brini handled the cancellation with the same grace and style for which she has become well-known. She is still a popular figure in New York City's social circle.\n\nEarly Life\n\nBen was born on July 23, 1969, at Boston Lying In Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts to Peter and Mary Jane. The first seven years of his life were spent in Wellesley, MA with his father teaching theater at Brandeis University and his mother alternately keeping house and acting in professional productions in Boston and New York as well as touring with her own one woman adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. In 1976 the family moved to the small college town of Athens, Ohio, home of Ohio University. Ben attended elementary and middle school in Athens while his father taught in the graduate theater program there. In 1980 Peter Sander received a Pell grant and moved the family to Cleveland, OH, where he acted as a Dramaturge for The Cleveland Play House. The Playhouse offered Ben his first opportunity to act professionally. He was cast as Bodo in a production of Lillian Hellman’s Watch on the Rhine. They returned to Athens in 1981 for two years. In 1983 Peter took a job with The University of Missouri in Kansas City where Ben attended Center Senior High School. Ben performed in high school theatrical productions, but eventually forsook the stage for the costume room becoming the costume designer during his senior year, using his extensive collection of vintage clothing as costumes for the productions that year. After graduating high school in 1987 Sander attended the Kansas City Art Institute foundations program.\n\nIn 2006 the family again moved; this time to Hempstead, Long Island, where his father had been hired as the chair for the theater department of Hofstra University. Ben spent a few years getting his sea legs in New York City, working at various jobs and studying fashion illustration with Veronica Galati. He then applied to, and was accepted into the fashion design program at Fashion Institute of Technology in 1989. Ben spent four years studying his craft at FIT. Graduating in 1993, he obtained a job at moderate dress house, BGB as an assistant designer. His job was making patterns for the samples. The company reorganized nine months after he was hired and he was let go. After that he worked at a bridal boutique, and two furriers before moving into Manhattan and developing The Brini Maxwell Show for television.\n\n"}

At a young age, his parents were no longer able to support him financially, so he joined the army in Dalmatia. Three years later, he had returned to Venice and joined the Granelleschi Society. This society was dedicated to the pursuit of preservation of Tuscan literature from the influence of foreign culture; it was particularly interested in saving traditional Italian comedy such as Commedia dell'Arte.\n\nPietro Chiari and Carlo Goldoni, two Venetian writers, were moving away from the old style of Italian theatre, which threatened the work of the Granelleschi Society. In 1757 Gozzi defended Commedia dell'Arte by publishing a satirical poem, \"La tartana degli influssi per l'anno 1756\", and in 1761 his comedy based on a fairy tale, \"The Love for Three Oranges\" or \"Analisi riflessiva della fiaba L'amore delle tre melarance\", he parodied Chiari and Goldoni. To perform his play, he obtained the services of the Sacchi company of players, a Commedia dell'Arte troupe who had been out of work do to the dwindling interest in Commedia dell'Arte after Chiari and Goldoni's efforts. Their satirical powers thus sharpened by personal vendetta, the play was an extraordinary success, and Gozzi donated his play and the rest of his fairy tales to Sacchi's troupe, which in effect saved the company. While some have called Gozzi the savior of Commedia dell'Arte there has been much debate due to the fact that Gozzi wrote out all his scripts and traditional Commedia dell'Arte is mainly improvised.\n\nStruck by the effect produced on the audience by the introduction of the supernatural or mythical element, which he had merely used as a convenient medium for his satirical purposes, Gozzi produced a series of dramatic pieces based on fairy tales. These were hugely popular, but after Sacchi's company disbanded, they were unjustly neglected. Gozzi's fairy tales drew influence from Commedia dell'Arte, and the popularity of them caused a revival of Commedia dell'Arte in Italy. These fairy tales were much praised by Goethe, Schlegel brothers, Hoffmann, Madame de Staël, Sismondi and Ostrovsky; one of these plays, \"Turandot\" or \"La Turandotte\", was translated by Friedrich Schiller and staged by Goethe in Weimar in 1802 with great success. Gozzi was acclaimed throughout most of Europe, but was less esteemed in his own homeland.\n\nIn the last years of Gozzi's life he had begun to experiment by producing tragedies with largely comical influences, but these endeavors were met with harsh critical response. He then began to work in Spanish drama, and found minor success before his death. He was buried in the church of San Cassiano in Venice.\n\nHe is well known for his feuds with Carlo Goldoni and Pietro Chiari between 1756-1762 over the changing style of Italian theatre that was moving away from the masked and improvised styling of Commedia dell'Arte.\n\nHe was the titular protector of Teodora Ricci, and caused the voluntary exile of Pier Antonio Gratarol, a member of Venetian society whom Gozzi's \"Draghe d'Amore was\" partially based on\",\" for having an affair with and ruining the reputation of Ricci.\n\nHis brother, Gasparo Gozzi, was also a well-known writer of the time.\n\nHis collected works were published under his own superintendence at Venice in 1792, in 10 volumes.\n\nA number of twentieth-century stage works were inspired by Gozzi's plays. These include treatments of \"Turandot\" by Karl Vollmöller and Bertolt Brecht, operas based on the same story by Busoni, and, more famously, Puccini, Prokofiev's \"The Love of Three Oranges\" and Hans Werner Henze's König Hirsch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The location test revealed new features such as a redesigned song selection interface, new adjustable versions of the Sudden and Hidden modifiers, and the ability to adjust these settings and the speed of the arrows in-game using the control buttons on the cabinet. The location test version did not contain an Extra Stage song, but \"POSSESSION\" was accessible on the build if certain conditions were met.\n\n\nAll characters from the previous game return with new costume. A new character named Rinon is added. Also, Rena from the Hottest Party series makes her first arcade appearance here. There are also seven different-colored Rinons that only make appearances as opposing characters in each song in Replicant-D Action folder. Just like in DDR X, characters can be customized using various accessories.\n\nThe Extra Stage system in this game has been changed. The player must obtain performance grade of AA or AAA from the First Stage to a Final Stage to reach Extra Stage. There are no longer songs exclusive to Final Stage that are required to access Extra Stage as with previous versions. The special song available in Extra Stage is KIMONO PRINCESS, but the difficulty ratings of the chart is based on the sum of difficulty ratings and the number of stages on the credit. The list is as follows.\n\nThe Extra Stage uses Battery Dance Meter; its quantity of lives is 4. The players can choose options for Extra Stage.\n\nTo access Encore Extra Stage, the player needs to get AA or better on KIMONO PRINCESS on Expert during Extra Stage. Unlike previous version where the players may choose any song, Encore Extra Stages have been reverted to the style in DDR MAX, where only a specific song can be played. The song is (by default) Roppongi EVOLVED on Expert. The version of the song is chosen randomly. Players are still able to set options before challenging Encore Extra Stage.\n\nFor Replicant D-Action, each song has different requirements to access. \nScoring AA or better on each song would net a medal.\n\nWhen the player subsequently earns all six, the player immediately will access the special Encore Extra Stage, Valkyrie dimension on Expert. The player is forced to play the song immediately, which means the player cannot change options or take a break.\n\nThere are 83 new songs featured in X2. 17 out of 19 Licensed Songs from \"Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova\" and 10 out of 13 Licensed Songs from \"Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova 2\" have been removed due to their licenses expiring. The licensed material from \"Dance Dance Revolution X\" remains, including tracks from the Dancemania compilation series, as well as A Different Drum records. Four classic licensed songs from earlier DDR mixes have also returned in remastered form, along with a special remixed license track. The first location test build contained 14 new songs, plus one secret song, \"Possession\", which had special conditions required in order to be unlocked. Three additional songs were added on an updated build installed several days after the testing began.\n\nIn the 2010 Japanese Arcade Operators Union expo (AOU2010), Konami showed a newer build of the game. This newer version showcased even more new songs, including additional material from other BEMANI music games.\n\nThe final release of the build revealed many new unlocks, special remixes by Konami artists, and song revivals. The licenses include selections by well known Japanese and Western artists. This the very first DDR arcade release to include licenses from the \"Cyber Trance\" series of albums. It is also the first time that Super Eurobeat tracks have been featured in a DDR game since \"Dancing Stage featuring Disney's Rave\". Other songs have been ported over from the latest PlayStation 2, Wii, and Xbox 360 DDR releases. There are a total of 444 songs in this game.\n\nOne of the new features included in the main game mode is a special \"Extra Stage\" system. Known as \"Replicant D-Action\", this mode allows players to choose from a set of 6 difficult songs, 3 level 14's (slower songs) and 3 level 17's (faster + tempo change songs). When a player gets rank AA or more one of these songs (any difficulty), they receive a medal for that particular track. When players subsequently earn all 6 medals, they can access the Encore Extra Stage, \"Valkyrie dimension\" (Expert). \"Valkyrie dimension\" is known as the first song in the series is harder than the \"Extra Stage\" despite having one life, let alone the most difficult song in the entire series.\n\nOn March 23, 2011, Konami introduced a special promotion called APPEND Festival. This allowed players to unlock 2 special songs for 5 BEMANI games, including \"DDR X2\" and the recently released upgrade version of jubeat knit, \"jubeat knit APPEND\".\n\nBelow is a list of songlist changes featured in the final version. A lock indicate that the song must be unlock. A clapperboard indicate a special background videos will be played during the song. However, some of the background videos (mostly from Beatmania IIDX) are actually displayed on the large screen of the background (where the character is dancing) instead of displaying it full screen (mainly because they are considered to be too generic or distracting). A \"clapperboard\" (BG) will indicate such songs.\n\n"}

His father was a director at the mint.\n\nHe was inspired by a magic show he had attended at primary school. Since he quickly uncovered the magic trick he observed, he tried to copy it by himself. Skilled in handicraft, he constructed a cardboard box, in which he put torn newspaper and took out pieces of colored paper as a trick. Thus, he could amaze his classmates and his teacher.\n\nAfter a hard search, he found a book titled \"Fenni Eğlenceler\" (\"Scientific Entertainments\"), from which he learned the finenesses and the secrets of the stage magic art. He began his career in tents set up at special locations during bayrams, the national or religious celebrations in Turkey.\n\nAt the age of ten, he was invited to perform a magic show during a circumcision feast, for which he received a fee. In the beginning, his parents were against a career in stage magic, because they wanted him to receive a higher education like his older brother, who became an engineer. However, as he proved that he caould earn money in his job, they agreed. After secondary school, he dropped out and devoted himself to stage magic.\n\nAs he was gaining wider interest, he asked his older sister, who was a tailor, to make a tailcoat in black for him, inspired by a photo of the renowned Turkish stage magician Zati Sungur.\n\nIn 1952, when he was only twelve, Mehmet Ertuğrul Işınbark signed a five–year contract with Fethi Pehlivan, the manager of the renowned singer Zeki Müren. From then on, he used to perform 7–8 shows every night. In 1959, he went on his first tour accompanying the famous singer Safiye Ayla. Later in his career, he went several times around the country visiting many cities, towns and villages.\n\nAs he turned 20, his manager gave him the stage name \"Sihirbaz Mandrake\" (\"Mandrake the Magician\") after the famous newspaper comic strip, a nickname, with which he became well known in Turkey. He told once that even his wife and his daughter called him with that name at home.\n\nHis magic word was \"Sim Sala Gala\", different from \"Abracadabra\" or \"Hocus Pocus\", which other Turkish magicians used. He grew a goatee just like the renowned magician figure of Abracadabra.\n\nAfter he once observed a ventriloquist on the stage, he decided to perform also this type of stagecraft act. He made a puppeteered \"dummy\", which he called \"Cin Ali\" (\"Ali the Ghost\"). Upon his great success in his performance, his manager asked him to continue with ventriloquism only and to quit stage magic. However, he rejected this proposal, retaining magic shows. The number of his performances at different variety show venues increased up to twelve a night. He received more applause than some star singers on the same stage.\n\nMandrake was elected Turkish champion of stage magic during a contest in 1965. He established Turkey's first and the only school of stage magic in 1979, with the aim to share his knowledge and skills, and to contribute to the education of young people in the art of stage magic. Many Turkish stage magicians of today were his students.\n\nHis main characteristic was to invent new magic tricks. Many of his tricks were taken over into related European catalogues.\n\nIn 1958, he met his later wife Süheyla during a feast fair in Karagümrük, Istanbul. He returned from his first tour in 1959 with some money in his purse, he married her. The next year, he went into military service in Eskişehir, his wife followed him there.\n\nSüheyla became his assistant on the stage. At the age of three and half, their daughter Işın began to join them on the stage as well. After his wife retired, their daughter, a bank employee, and her husband assisted Mandrake at the shows.\n\nMehmet Ertuğrul Işınbark died of cardiac insufficiency at the age of 73 on May 28, 2014. He was hospitalized from his summer residence at Gelibolu, Çanakkale on May 19. His corpse was transferred to Istanbul on May 29, and he was given a religious ceremony at Fatih Mosque.\n"}

{"id": "3480573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3480573", "title": "Fiction writing", "text": "Fiction writing\n\nFiction writing is the composition of non-factual prose texts. Fictional writing often is produced as a story meant to entertain or convey an author's point of view. The result of this may be a short story, novel, novella, screenplay, or drama, which are all types (though not the only types) of fictional writing styles. Different types of authors practice fictional writing, including novelists, playwrights, short story writers, dramatists and screenwriters.\n\nA genre is the subject matter or category that writers use. For instance, science fiction, fantasy and mystery fiction are genres. Genre fiction also known as popular fiction, is plot-driven fictional works written with the intent of fitting into a specific literary genre, in order to appeal to readers and fans already familiar with that genre.\n\nGenre fiction is storytelling driven by plot, as opposed to literary fiction, which focuses more on theme and character. Genre fiction, or popular fiction, is written to appeal to a large audience and it sells more primarily because it is more commercialised. An example is the \"Twilight\" series which may sell more than Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick\", because the \"Twilight\" novels deal with elements of pop culture – romance and vampires.\n\nLiterary fiction is fictional works that hold literary merit, that is to say, they are works that offer social commentary, or political criticism, or focus on aspect of the human condition.\n\nLiterary fiction is usually contrasted with, popular, commercial, or genre fiction. Some have described the difference between them in terms of analysing reality (literary) rather than escaping reality (popular). The contrast between these two categories of fiction is controversial among some critics and scholars.\n\nCharacterization is one of the five elements of fiction, along with plot, setting, theme, and writing style. A character is a participant in the story, and is usually a person, but may be any persona, identity, or entity whose existence originates from a fictional work or performance.\n\nCharacters may be of several types:\n\nThe plot, or storyline, is the rendering and ordering of the events and actions of a story. Starting with the initiating event, then the rising action, conflict, climax, falling action, and ending possibly with a resolution.\n\nPlot consists of action and reaction, also referred to as stimulus and response and has a beginning, a middle, and an ending.\n\nThe climax of the novel consists of a single action-packed sentence in which the conflict (problem) of the novel is resolved. This sentence comes towards the end of the novel. The main part of the action should come before the climax.\n\nPlot also has a mid-level structure: scene and sequel. A scene is a unit of drama—where the action occurs. Then, after a transition of some sort, comes the sequel—an emotional reaction and regrouping, an aftermath.\n\nSetting is the locale and time of a story. The setting is often a real place, but may be a fictitious city or country within our own world; a different planet; or an alternate universe, which may or may not have similarities with our own universe. Sometimes setting is referred to as milieu, to include a context (such as society) beyond the immediate surroundings of the story. It is basically where and when the story takes place.\n\nTheme is what the author is trying to tell the reader. For example, the belief in the ultimate good in people, or that things are not always what they seem. This is often referred to as the \"moral of the story.\" Some fiction contains advanced themes like morality, or the value of life, whereas other stories have no theme, or a very shallow one.\n\nStyle includes the multitude of choices fiction writers make, consciously or not, in the process of writing a story. It encompasses not only the big-picture, strategic choices such as point of view and choice of narrator, but also tactical choices of grammar, punctuation, word usage, sentence and paragraph length and structure, tone, the use of imagery, chapter selection, titles, etc. In the process of creating a story, these choices meld to become the writer's voice, his or her own unique style.\n\nFor each piece of fiction, the author makes many choices, consciously or subconsciously, which combine to form the writer's unique style. The components of style are numerous, but include point of view, choice of narrator, fiction-writing mode, person and tense, grammar, punctuation, word usage, sentence length and structure, paragraph length and structure, tone, imagery, chapter usage, and title selection.\n\nThe narrator is the story teller. The main character in the book can also be the narrator.\n\nPoint of view is the perspective (or type of personal or non-personal \"lens\") through which a story is communicated. Narrative point of view or narrative perspective describes the position of the narrator, that is, the character of the storyteller, in relation to the story being told.\n\nThe tone of a literary work expresses the writer's attitude toward or feelings about the subject matter and audience.\n\nSuspension of disbelief is the reader's temporary acceptance of story elements as believable, regardless of how implausible they may seem in real life.\n\nErnest Hemingway wrote \"Prose is architecture, not interior decoration.\"\n\nStephen King, in his non-fiction, part autobiographical, part self-help writing memoir, \"\", he gives readers helpful advice on honing their craft: \"Description begins in the writer's imagination, but should finish in the reader's.\"\n\nKurt Vonnegut the author of praised novels \"Cat's Cradle\", \"Slaughterhouse-Five\", and \"Breakfast of Champions\", has given his readers, from his short story collection, \"Bagombo Snuff Box\", eight rules on how to write a successful story. The list can be found in the Introduction of the collection.\n\n\"Now lend me your ears. Here is Creative Writing 101:\n\n\n\n"}

The series was a spin-off of \"The Andy Griffith Show\", and the pilot episode was aired as the season finale of the fourth season of its parent series on May 18, 1964. The show ran for a total of 150 half-hour episodes spanning over five seasons, first in black-and-white for the first season, and then in color for the remaining four seasons. In 2006, CBS Home Entertainment (distributed by Paramount) began releasing the series on DVD. The final season was released in November 2008.\n\n\"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\" was a hit, never placing lower than tenth in the Nielsen ratings, and ended its run as the second-highest-rated series in the United States. It has enjoyed continued popularity through reruns and DVD releases. The series was created by Aaron Ruben, who also produced the show with Sheldon Leonard and Ronald Jacobs. Filmed and set in California (originally set in North Carolina), it stars Jim Nabors as Gomer Pyle, a naive but good-natured gas station attendant from the town of Mayberry, North Carolina, who enlists in the United States Marine Corps. Frank Sutton plays Gomer's high-octane, short-fused Gunnery Sergeant Vince Carter, and Ronnie Schell plays Gomer's friend Duke Slater. Roy Stuart portrayed Corporal Chuck Boyle, GySgt. Carter's good-natured sidekick. Allan Melvin played in the recurring role of Gunnery Sergeant Carter's rival, Staff Sergeant Charley Hacker.\n\nEverett Greenbaum and Jim Fritzell, writers for \"The Andy Griffith Show\", are credited with creating the character of Gomer Pyle. The character was based on an \"incompetent\" gas station attendant whom Greenbaum met and named after Gomer Cool (a writer) and Denver Pyle (an actor on \"The Andy Griffith Show\"). Jim Nabors was cast to play Gomer; he had been performing for a Santa Monica nightclub, The Horn, when Andy Griffith discovered him. Though originally intended to appear in only one episode, Gomer proved popular, and after appearing in seasons 3 and 4, Nabors was given his own spin-off produced by Aaron Ruben. The pilot episode of \"Gomer Pyle\" was filmed in 1963 as part of \"The Andy Griffith Show\", but was not aired until 1964, as the finale of \"The Andy Griffith Show\"'s fourth season.\n\nThe 1960s had a return to \"the more mundane sensibilities of comedy,\" due to viewers' wishes for television programming to be a \"cultural antidepressant.\" Thus, fantasy and rural-oriented comedies gained popularity and dominated the Nielsen ratings. Like other comedies at the time, \"Gomer Pyle\" was a \"deep escapist\" show; it avoided political commentary and offered viewers a distraction from the social changes of the 1960s. Despite being a military-themed show and airing during the peak of the Vietnam War, the show never discussed the war. Instead, the show focused on \"Gomer's innocent simplicity [and] Sergeant Carter's frustration and later concern for Gomer's well-being.\" This, compounded with the popularity of rural comedies in the 1960s, made the show popular. Frank Sutton, who played Carter, also ascribed the show's popularity to its concentration on its two main characters, and the plots being built around their respective personalities. The program remained in the top 10 of the ratings throughout its run—in the top three for all but its third season when CBS moved it from Fridays to Wednesdays. Nabors quit because he desired to move to something else, 'reach for another rung on the ladder, either up or down'.\n\nAfter \"Gomer Pyle\" left the air, Jim Nabors hosted his own variety show, \"The Jim Nabors Hour\", from 1969 to 1971. As well as showcasing Nabors' singing and rich baritone voice, the show included comedy sketches that featured Nabors's \"Gomer Pyle\" co-stars Frank Sutton and Ronnie Schell. Though told that he should not leave \"Gomer Pyle\", Nabors felt that the show would still be exciting and noted that every character he portrayed in his sketches \"turn[ed] out to be Gomer.\"\n\nThe show was produced by creator Aaron Ruben, \"Andy Griffith Show\" producer Sheldon Leonard (in partnership with Griffith), and Ronald Jacobs; it was co-produced by Bruce Bayley Johnson and Duke Vincent. Among the writers were Sam Bobrick, Harvey Miller, Aaron Ruben, Jack Elinson, and Bill Idelson; \"Andy Griffith Show\" writers Everett Greenbaum and Jim Fritzell also wrote episodes. Coby Ruskin was the primary director in the first four seasons, before John Rich took over the role for the fifth season; other directors included Gary Nelson, Peter Baldwin, and Alan Rafkin. Ruth Burch was in charge of the casting, and John Finger directed the cinematography. The theme song was composed by Earle Hagen, who also composed the themes for shows such as \"The Andy Griffith Show\", \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\", and \"That Girl\". The show was filmed at Camp Pendleton, Desilu Studios's Desilu-Cahuenga, and RKO Forty Acres backlot, where \"The Andy Griffith Show\" was filmed. Though Ruben preferred the use of a multiple-camera setup for comedy programs, \"Gomer Pyle\" used a single-camera setup because much of the shooting was conducted outdoors. In his book \"And The Show Goes On\", Sheldon Leonard explained that the armed forces offer levels of \"cooperation\" with filmmakers. Because the Marines felt that the show would be good for the branch's image, \"Gomer Pyle\" was given \"total cooperation,\" meaning that the show was allowed unlimited access to military equipment.\n\nThe vehicles in the show were provided by the Chrysler Corporation, as opposed to the parent series' vehicles that came from the Ford Motor Company. Although Jeeps are also prominent in the show, the brand itself would not become a part of Chrysler until the AMC buyout that occurred in 1987.\n\nNabors and Sutton were the only actors credited in every episode (however, Sutton did not actually appear in every episode). Ronnie Schell (who played Duke Slater) left after the third season to star in \"Good Morning, World\", though he returned for the fifth season, promoted to corporal, after graduating from non-commissioned officer training. Roy Stuart, who played Corporal Chuck Boyle, made his debut in the second season and left after the fourth. Andy Griffith, Frances Bavier, Ron Howard, and George Lindsey made guest appearances on the series reprising their respective roles from \"The Andy Griffith Show\". Denver Pyle and Allan Melvin, who both had roles on \"The Andy Griffith Show\", appeared in \"Gomer Pyle\", but did not reprise their original roles. Denver Pyle, who had played Briscoe Darling in six episodes of \"The Andy Griffith Show\", played tomato farmer Titus Purcell in the \"Gomer Pyle\" episode \"The Price of Tomatoes.\" Allan Melvin, who had played Clarence \"Doc\" Malloy and other antagonists on \"The Andy Griffith Show\", played Sergeant Carter's rival, Staff Sergeant Hacker, for four seasons. Nabors also carried the Gomer Pyle character to fellow CBS series \"The Lucy Show,\" in which he made a cameo appearance in a 1966 episode.\n\nThe premise of \"Gomer Pyle\" is similar to and perhaps inspired by Andy Griffith's movie \"No Time for Sergeants\", which was based on the Mac Hyman novel of the same name. Like Leonard's other shows, \"Gomer Pyle\" was character-driven; the main characters were \"accessible\" and \"engaging,\" and the supporting characters were often eccentric. In the show's pilot episode, Gomer, a gas-station attendant from Mayberry, joins the Marines. Gomer's naivete immediately exasperates his drill instructor, Gunnery Sergeant Carter (Frank Sutton). Originally situated in Camp Wilson in North Carolina, the setting was moved to the fictional Camp Henderson in California. The show was a piece, which, like its contemporary \"The Beverly Hillbillies\", featured rural characters out of their normal settings. Like other comedies of the 1960s, the show avoided political commentary (especially concerning the Vietnam War) and focused instead on the predicaments that ensued from Gomer's unintentional breaking of the rules or .\n\nAmong the themes explored were the honesty and \"strong family values supposedly inherent in small town life\"; according to author Gerard Jones, \"Gomer Pyle\"'s basic message was \"far simpler than any corporate suburban sitcoms with their lessons in compromise and role-following [...] It said merely that the oldest, most basic, least sophisticated sort of sweetness could redeem even the toughest modern types\". Author Elizabeth Hirschman noted that Gomer represented a \"uniquely American archetype\"—a \"large, powerful man physically\" with the \"simple, honest nature of a child or animal\". She also noted that, like stories with characters of such an archetype, Gomer's trusting nature was often taken advantage of, though in the end he \"reaps happiness\" because of his innocence. In his book \"Watching \"M*A*S*H\", Watching America\", media and communications scholar James Wittebols said that \"Gomer Pyle\" illustrated how class differences \"supposedly negated or diminished by military training\" appeared in military hierarchy.\n\nGomer Pyle (played by Jim Nabors), from Mayberry, North Carolina, is a good-natured and innocent private whose naïvete constantly annoys his drill instructor, Sergeant Carter. Eventually, however, his \"unquestioning love and trust of the world\" lead those in his platoon to befriend him. His good nature attracts the friendship of women; meanwhile, in so far as Carter's abrasiveness repels women, Gomer is in the position of salvaging numerous social occasions by charming the women whose opinions are important to officers at the Marine base. Gomer was created as a stereotype of a rural American; according to \"Time\", he \"wears a gee-whiz expression, spouts out of a lopsided mouth and lopes around uncertainly like a plowboy stepping through a field of cow dung. He is a walking disaster area.\" Though never promoted beyond private first class during the show's run, Jim Nabors (who played Gomer) was given an honorary promotion to lance corporal in 2001 and again to corporal in 2007 by the Marines.\n\nGomer Pyle's birthday was February 26.\nVince Carter (played by Frank Sutton), a gunnery sergeant from Kansas, is Gomer's irritable, abrasive, and socially inept drill instructor (later his platoon sergeant) who is constantly annoyed by Gomer's well-intentioned mistakes. Carter disdains Gomer's country idiosyncrasies (\"golly!\" \"Shazam!\" \"surprise, surprise, surprise!\"). He is also put off by Gomer's expectation that the platoon should be a family, of which Carter is the father figure: As much as Carter wants their working relationship to be temporary, as is common in the military, Gomer expects a life-long friendship, which exasperates Carter. Due to the audience's demand for more family-oriented programming, he eventually revealed his softer side: Carter became a father figure to Gomer as well as his best friend. Sutton stated that his character was created \" for the show\" and, as the actor played him \"by ear,\" Carter greatly changed during the first season. Barbara Stuart played his girlfriend \"Miss Bunny\" for three seasons.\n\nMark Slade appeared in eight episodes in 1964 in the role of \"Eddie\" though in the first of those appearances he was billed as \"Private Swanson.\"\n\nDuke Slater (played by Ronnie Schell) is Gomer's friend and platoon-mate. Schell left the show in the fourth season to star in the short-lived show \"Good Morning, World\" but returned in the final season as the corporal of Gomer's platoon.\n\nChuck Boyle (played by Roy Stuart) is Gomer's corporal. He often serves as Carter's conscience and sticks up for Gomer when Sergeant Carter is annoyed over his mistakes. Stuart debuted in the second season and left the show after the fourth season; Boyle was replaced by Duke Slater as corporal for the final season.\n\nLou-Ann Poovie (played by Elizabeth MacRae) is Gomer's girlfriend. She debuts in the third season as a singer for a nightclub, but leaves the job at Gomer's urging to return home to Turtle Creek, North Carolina, and marry her beau Monroe Efford. In a later episode in the same season, she returns to California and reveals that she called the wedding off. At the end of the episode, she reveals that she wants Gomer to be her boyfriend, to the dismay of Carter and Duke. After she loses her job at the nightclub, Gomer finds her a job as a salesclerk at a record shop.\n\nIn 1987, some 18 years after \"Gomer Pyle\" finished its broadcast run, Stanley Kubrick's film \"Full Metal Jacket\" was released. In it, the nickname \"Gomer Pyle\" is derogatorily given to Private Leonard Lawrence (played by Vincent D'Onofrio) during boot camp, after incurring the drill instructor's wrath (Gunnery Sergeant Hartman played by R. Lee Ermey) for being unable to turn off his idiot's grin and his perceived incompetence.\n\nA brief clip of the show airing on American Forces Vietnam Network television appears during the military hospital scene in the 1994 film \"Forrest Gump.\n\nE. Kitzes Knox wrote a novel based on the series, also titled \"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\" The paperback was published by Pyramid and released in 1966. Jim Nabors recorded \"Shazam!\", the official soundtrack of the show, and released it on the Columbia Records label.\n\nCBS DVD (distributed by Paramount Home Entertainment) has released all five seasons of \"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\" on DVD in Region 1. All episodes have been fully restored and digitally remastered in full-color, but due to clearance issues, some episodes that feature Nabors (and other cast members) singing have been edited to remove those performances.\n\nOn March 10, 2015, CBS DVD released\" Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.- The Complete series\" on DVD in Region 1.\n\nIn Region 4, Shock Entertainment has released all five seasons on DVD in Australia.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27144479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27144479", "title": "Hedonic music consumption model", "text": "Hedonic music consumption model\n\nThe hedonic music consumption model was created by music researchers Kathleen Lacher and Richard Mizeski in 1994. Their goal was to use this model to examine the responses that listening to rock music creates, and to find if these responses influenced the listener's intention to later purchase the music. The article begins with a discussion of why the issue of music consumption is important. Music is then explored as an aesthetic product, prior to a discussion of what hedonic consumption is, as well as its origins, and concludes with an in-depth look at the model itself.\n\nMusic is consumed in a variety of ways, through the radio, television, and internet, as well as through concerts and performances.\nNorth and Hargreaves have suggested \"record buying is perhaps the ultimate behavioural measure of musical preference, involving the purchaser's time, effort, and money\" (p. 282). The study of music purchase and consumption was quite limited as of the early 1990s, as only a few academic studies had investigated this topic at that point in time. \nThe impact of illegal music downloads and file sharing has again brought the issue of music purchases to the forefront. Much popular press and current academic work is being devoted to this topic. The latest report by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) mentions four academic studies in particular (e.g., Zenter, 2003; Liebowitz, 2006; Michael, 2006; Rob & Waldfogel, 2006;) that have examined file-sharing as having a negative impact on the record industry. Not all academics believe to be true however, as the Oberholzer & Strumpf (2004) study brought a different viewpoint to this topic in an article published in the prestigious Journal of Political Economy. These Harvard Business School professors received considerable media attention with the study's conclusion \"the empirical evidence on sales displacement is mixed…the papers using actual file-sharing data, suggest that piracy and music sales are largely unrelated\" (pp. 24–25).\n\nHedonic consumption was first introduced as an alternative to the traditional consumer behavior model by in the early 1980s. Conventional consumer research has traditionally used the black box approach and has historically analyzed the consumption activities of product categories such as package goods and major consumer durables. Hedonic consumption focuses on products such as the arts, music, and cultural events such as rock concerts, fashion shows and films. These \"experience\" types of products tend to involve individual preferences that can generate certain emotions, feelings and behaviors.\n\nMusic is an aesthetic product as it often provides an emotional or spiritually moving experience specific to an individual. Holbrook also states that music is appreciated primarily for its internal essence as opposed to being viewed strictly as an objective product. However, consumer research literature focusing on these types of products often uses the terms \"aesthetic\" and \"hedonic\" almost interchangeably. Charters (2006) points out \"hedonic consumption is essentially about pleasure\" (p. 240), and that pleasure is but one aspect of the overall aesthetic experience. He also notes that \"popular culture works may have ‘layers of meaning' for consumers\" as they may convey symbolic meaning for people in significance or emotion of some type. From a retailing standpoint, aesthetic products are characterized as having a wide range of product offerings in the marketplace.\n\nAs Hirschman and Holbrook point out, hedonic consumption expands upon the traditional definition of consumer behavior through its inclusion of \"the multi-sensory, fantasy and emotive aspects of one's experience with products…including tastes, sounds, scents, tactile impressions and visual images\" (p. 92). These types of experience-oriented products often involve \"fun, amusement, fantasy, arousal, sensory stimulation, and enjoyment\" (p. 37). In addition, hedonic consumption often uses ethnic background, social class and gender to help determine the different consumer emotions and fantasies around a product.\n\nThe study of the hedonic consumption as an academic field began in the late 1970s. It originated out of different behavioral science fields, including sociology, philosophy, psycholinguistics, and psychology. Hirschman and Holbrook considered key contributions to come from two fields of prior academic research. The first was the motivation research of the 1950s, \"which focused on the emotional aspects of products and fantasies that the products could arouse and/or fulfill\" (p. 93). Ernest Dichter was a key figure in this field of research which was popular from the 1950s to the 1970s. One of the major shortcomings of the early motivation research was the fact that many of its clinical studies lacked rigor and validity.\n\nHedonic consumption also owes a big debt to the academic field of product symbolism research. One of the important contributors to this academic field includes Sidney J. Levy, who is now the Coca-Cola Distinguished Professor of Marketing at Eller College of Management at the University of Arizona. He wrote the groundbreaking article \"Symbols for Sale\" which first appeared in the July–August 1959 edition of the \"Harvard Business Review\". \nLevy observed \"consumers buy products and brands not only for so-called functional reasons but for the various ‘symbolic meanings' that their consumption provides\" (p. 198). Another early Levy article \"Symbolism and Life Style\" was originally published in the December 1963 American Marketing Association's \"Toward Scientific Marketing\" Winter Conference Proceedings. In this article, Levy expanded upon his earlier writings by urging marketers to consider \"the sum of an individual's consumption of symbolic goods and services as a 'lifestyle'\" (p. 199). Levy was interested in the development of a taxonomy that would allow marketers to be able to think more systematically about how to meaningfully fulfill the needs of their individual consumers.\n\nHirschman and Holbrook's research in the hedonic consumption field first led Kathleen Lacher to begin to explore music as a hedonic consumption product in the late 1980s. Her goal was to try to understand the factors behind why people bought music. In 1994, she joined forces with Richard Mizerski to conduct an experiment that explored music purchase intentions. These professors proposed a theoretical model they named the \"model of music consumption and purchase intention\". Their basic premise was that people buy music because of the \"experience that the music creates by itself or because music can enhance other experiences, whether it is an individual or shared experiences with others\" (p. 367).\n\nLacher and Mizerski based their experiments on previous music research that was conducted in the fields of music education and psychology. They tested music on four \"responses\" to see what, if any, had any effect on music purchase intentions.\n\nNext, these first four inputs link together along a pathway towards music purchase using four additional factors:\n\nLacher and Mizerski conducted experiments with college students to determine if the directly linked relationships they had proposed between these eight factors stayed consistent in ultimately predicting rock music purchases. They picked this music genre as previous research suggested most recorded music was bought by people between the ages of 10 and 25, and that this was the preferred genre of the students in test groups.\n\nLacher and Mizerski found during the course of the tests that their hypotheses were not as consistent as they had thought, and in some cases, the relationships were not direct. Still they were able to make some general conclusions about why people buy music. They revised their original model to create a significant-paths-only model hedonic music consumption model detailing the revised relationships between the factors. The emotional response was broken down to include six different music dimensions that ranged from calm to exuberant. In short, their end goal was to \"foster a systematic system of why people purchase music so we can better understand this important marketplace behavior\" (p. 375). One of the ways that Lacher and Mizerski believed that this hedonic music consumption model might prove helpful in terms of future research was to explain the consumption of other \"hedonic\" products such as books, movies, plays, paintings and sports events\" (p. 377).\n\n"}

Scylla once again kidnapped Hugo's wife Hugolina and the children, but this time she keeps them captive in a cage in her new lair, located at a top of volcano in the center of the island.

The sentence is sometimes presented as a puzzle, where the solver must add the punctuation.\n\nIt refers to two students, James and John, required by an English test to describe a man who had suffered from a cold in the past. John writes \"The man had a cold\", which the teacher marks incorrect, while James writes the correct \"The man had had a cold\". Since James' answer was right, it had had a better effect on the teacher.\n\nThe sentence is much easier to understand with added punctuation and emphasis:\nIn each of the five \"had had\" word pairs in the above sentence, the first of the pair is in the past perfect form. The italicized instances denote emphasis of intonation, focusing on the differences in the students' answers, then finally identifying the correct one.\n\nThe sentence can be given as a grammatical puzzle or an item on a test, for which one must find the proper punctuation to give it meaning. Hans Reichenbach used a similar sentence in 1947 as an exercise to the reader (\"John where Jack...\"), to illustrate the different levels of language, namely object language and metalanguage.\n\nIn research showing how people make sense of information in their environment, this sentence was used to demonstrate how seemingly arbitrary decisions can drastically change meaning, analogous to how changes in the punctuation and quotes in the sentence show that the teacher alternately prefers James' work and John's work (e.g., compare: 'James, while John had had \"had,\" had...' vs. 'James, while John had had \"had had,\"...').\n\nThe sentence is also used to show the semantic vagueness of the word \"had\", as well as to demonstrate the difference between using a word and mentioning a word.\n\nIt has also been used as an example of the complexities of language, its interpretation, and their effects on a person's perceptions.\n\nFor the syntactic structure to be clear to a reader, this sentence requires, at a minimum, that the two phrases be separated by using a semicolon, period, en-dash or em-dash. Still, Jasper Fforde's novel \"The Well of Lost Plots\" employs a variation of the phrase to illustrate the confusion that may arise even from well-punctuated writing:\n"}

The series debuted on CraveTV in February 2016, and later also aired on The Comedy Network. The show stars Keeso and Nathan Dales as Wayne and Daryl, two friends living in the small town of Letterkenny, Ontario, a fictional community loosely based on Keeso's own hometown of Listowel, Ontario. \n\nOn March 10, 2016, \"Letterkenny\" was renewed for a second season of six episodes. On August 8, 2016, just weeks after production wrapped on Season 2, CraveTV announced that they had ordered a third season. On March 17, 2017, a St. Patrick's Day special episode, \"St. Perfect's Day\" was released. The third season, shot during the winter season, was released on Canada Day, July 1, 2017. A Halloween episode was announced on October 2, 2017, which was released on October 20, 2017. The fourth season of six episodes was released on December 25, 2017. On October 23, 2017, it was announced that the series has a new media partner which has agreed to a production commitment for 40 new episodes, a 26 city \"Letterkenny Live!\" tour beginning in February 2018 and the expansion of Letterkenny merchandise. The six-episode fifth season was released on June 29, 2018.\n\nAt the 5th Canadian Screen Awards in 2017, the series won the award for Best Comedy Series.\n\n\"Letterkenny\" revolves around the antics of the residents of a small rural Canadian community called Letterkenny.\n\nExpanding the cast from the web series, the series focuses on Wayne and Katy (created for the TV series), siblings who run a small farm and produce stand, with help from Wayne's two friends: Daryl and \"Squirrely\" Dan (created for the TV series). It also focuses on a pair of local hockey players (Reily and Jonesy) who are involved in a polyamorous relationship with Katy. \n\nEpisodes deal with life in a small town, amongst different types of people: the farmers (the \"hicks\"), the out-of-towners who make up the local hockey team, the town's minister, the local drug addicts (the \"skids\"), and members of the local First Nation (the \"natives\"). Often plots revolve around Wayne defending his reputation as \"the toughest guy in Letterkenny\", the exploits of the local hockey team, and Wayne's attempt to break up his sister's open relationship with two of the members of the team, the various schemes by \"the skids\" to rip off the residents of both Letterkenny and the reservation, and Wayne's various attempts to find love. In later seasons, the scripts feature wordplay and puns as a running joke to convey the intelligence of the small town characters.\n\n\"Letterkenny\" is the first original series commissioned by CraveTV, and premiered on that platform on February 7, 2016. The show has its roots in \"Letterkenny Problems\", a short-format web series created by Keeso and released on YouTube in 2013. \"Letterkenny Problems\" garnered a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Original Fiction Program or Series Created for Digital Media at the 2nd Canadian Screen Awards in 2014. The town of Letterkenny portrayed in the series is fictional, and not based on the actual ghost town in Renfrew County.\n\nTierney and Michael Dowse are also involved in the production of the series. Tierney also has a supporting role as Pastor Glen in the series, whose cast also includes Michelle Mylett, Dylan Playfair, Andrew Herr, Tyler Johnston, Lisa Codrington, Alexander De Jordy, Kaniehtiio Horn and K. Trevor Wilson.\n\nThe series is filmed in Sudbury, Ontario. A second season was ordered in March 2016, and a third was ordered in August 2016.\n\n\nJohn Doyle of \"The Globe and Mail\" called the series \"refreshing and intoxicating\", and \"funny, mad, droll, childish, and spiky.\" Focusing on the show's characteristic use of often thick Ontario dialect, he wrote that \"Not since \"Trailer Park Boys\" launched have we heard the flavourful, salty Canadian vernacular used with such aplomb and abandon\"; but also that \"Almost all the conversations are raw comedy and utterly plausible as small-town guy talk, not just in Canada but in villages and parishes wherever the grass grows.\"\n\nCraveTV has stated that \"Letterkenny\"'s debut was the biggest debut of any series on their platform since it launched in 2014, and that as of March 10, 2016, nearly one in three subscribers have watched the series.\n\n"}

From this configuration a customized magnetic field can be formed to manipulate the particle beam.\n\nThe passing particle is subjected to two vector forces formula_1 (parallel to the core), and formula_2 (parallel to the radius of the lens). formula_2 causes the particle to spiral through the lens, and this spiraling expose the electron to formula_1 which in turn focus the electron. Note that the magnetic field is inhomogeneous, particles close to the center are less strongly deflected than those passing the lens far from the axis.\n\nTelevision sets employing cathode ray tubes use a magnetic lens in the form of a \"deflection yoke\" to enable an electron beam to scan the image by deflecting it vertically and horizontally.\n\n\n"}

It is a dance developed from Afro-Brazilian dances (mainly the lundu) and from European dances (mainly the polka).\n\nLike the tango, the maxixe travelled to Europe and the United States in the early years of the 20th century.\n\nThe music was influenced by various other forms including the Spanish tango, lundu, polka and habanera, and is danced to a rapid 2/4 time. Pianist Ernesto Nazareth composed many Brazilian tangos; he was known for blending folk influences into his tangos, polkas and waltzes. He resisted using folk terms for his compositions; he preferred \"Brazilian Tango\" to \"maxixe\".\n\nThe maxixe was one of the dances that contributed to samba dance styles (such as samba de gafieira) and lambada.\n\nVernon Castle said of the maxixe in his 1914 book \"Modern Dancing\", \"The steps themselves are not difficult; on the contrary, they are childishly simple; it is the easiest dance of all to do, and I think the hardest of all to do well.\"\n\nTroy Kinney (1914) wrote the following about the Maxixe:\n\nThis is, virtually, a revival of the Two-step, plus certain Tango steps and \"enchainements\" (). Instead of the Tango's touch-and-turn-in of the foot, it employs a device of resting the heel on the floor, the foot pointed upward, while the body assumes a bent-over posture not particularly attractive.\nFirst-class passenger Edith Russell left her lifeboat, before it was lowered, to retrieve her toy pig from her cabin, then returned. When on the water, she used the toy to amuse a baby in her lifeboat, as the pig played the \"Maxixe\" whenever its tail was twisted.\n\n\n"}

NCVS is also a Center at the University of Iowa where it has laboratories in the Department of Speech Pathology and Audiology. In addition, the NCVS has collaborators in Denver and at many institutions around the United States. Its focus is vocology, or the science and practice of voice habilitation.\n\nInitially conceived as a \"center without walls,\" the NCVS was formally organized in 1990 with the assistance of a grant from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), an institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NCVS was organized on the premise that a consortium of institutions (including the Wilber James Gould Voice Center at the DCPA, University of Iowa, University of Utah, University of Wisconsin–Madison) would be better able to conduct and disseminate research than a single organization. NCVS members, although geographically separate, were linked by a common desire to fully understand the characteristics, limitations and enhancement of human voice and speech.\n\nIn 1999, NIDCD discontinued the Multi-Purpose Research and Training Center funding mechanism for the entire institute focusing instead on single-project research awards (R01s). In a July 2000 meeting, however, NCVS investigators voted unanimously to continue the concept of a national resource center for voice and speech, to be driven by a variety of single-project research awards (R01s), as well as health communication, core, and training grants. In 2001, the NCVS moved its central location to Denver, where the otolaryngologist Dr. Wilbur James Gould had founded a center to study the voice and speech patterns of stage performers.\n\nThe NCVS team of investigators, led by Ingo Titze, studies the powers, limitations and enhancement of human voice and speech. The investigators are scientists, clinicians, educators, engineers and musicians who use diverse backgrounds (i.e., speech-language pathology, physics, computer science, acoustics, vocal performance, biology, medicine and engineering) to work together on voice and speech investigations. As a direct outgrowth of their work, NCVS members also teach other investigators and practitioners who work with voice, as well as speech clients and the general public. One example is the Summer Vocology Institute, which trains voice coaches and vocal health professionals in the study of Vocology.\n\n\n\n"}

He believes that their only option is to begin forcing the refugees who have arrived since the bombs exploded to leave. Some townspeople, having lost faith, are already making plans to leave for the south, believing that it will be easier to survive in the warmer climate. Former Mayor Johnston Green begs for them to stay, fearing that most of them will die or be murdered before they can reach safety.

They also say that American forces are still engaged in pursuing the surviving terrorists all over the world.\n\nHowever, since the \"Marines\" themselves later confess that they got this information in bits and pieces of news that they had heard, and made up material to fill in the blanks, none of it can be assumed to be factual. However, it is worth noting that the \"Marines\" talked of the \"war being over\" before they were told that the citizens of Jericho have received little news about the outside world.\n\nGeoff Berkshire at the \"LA Times\" praised the episode as \"a perfect example of the show in top form\". He said \"[Sarah's] death at the hands of Robert's daughter, Allison (Jazz Raycole), is thrilling and bold. There's something rather creepy about Allison becoming the second teenage killer on this show. It's precisely that kind of unsettling choice that underscores the bleakness and desperation that makes \"Jericho\" stand out from other network dramas.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "20596440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20596440", "title": "Serious Sam (video game)", "text": "Serious Sam (video game)\n\nSerious Sam is a first-person shooter video game, released in two episodes and the first in the \"Serious Sam\" series, developed by Croteam. Originally released for Microsoft Windows only, \"Serious Sam\" rising popularity resulted in the porting of the episodes to the Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation 2, Game Boy Advance, Linux and Palm OS, as well as in the remaking of both episodes for Microsoft Windows, Linux and Xbox 360 in high-definition.\n\nThe series follows the adventures of protagonist Sam \"Serious\" Stone and his fight against the forces of the notorious extraterrestrial overlord Mental who seeks to destroy humanity.\n\nEnemies spawn frequently and attack in large waves from across the game map, and the player is intended to dodge their projectiles and charges by jumping and strafing rather than by taking cover. Health and armor are non-regenerative on most difficulty levels, and instead are replenished with the health and armor packs which are littered throughout the game. Available health is represented by a percentage number on the screen. The combat is high-paced and frenetic: The levels typically consist of a series of elaborate arenas, in which the player will defeat a set number of re-spawning enemies before proceeding to the next. Enemies range from soldiers with rocket launchers to gigantic charging robots to shrieking suicide bombers without heads and holding bombs. The environments include ancient Egyptian pyramids, tropical rainforests, and medieval castles. \"Serious Sam\" features cooperative gameplay through a split-screen mode and via the internet.\n\n\"Serious Sam\" consists of two episodes: \"Serious Sam: The First Encounter\" and \"Serious Sam: The Second Encounter\". A fan-made level-pack, \"Dark Island\", was included in \"Serious Sam: Gold\". The games are on separate CDs (in the UK version) and are identical to their individual releases, except that the Sam character model for \"The First Encounter\" was modified to match the one used in \"The Second Encounter\". After the release of the remakes, both titles had \"Classic\" added to the name to prevent confusion.\n\n\"The First Encounter\" was the first game in the series; it had been in the making since 1996 and had a video showing its early game play in 2000. \"The First Encounter\" was originally developed by Croteam as a demonstrator for their engine and this is the reason why some countries saw its initial release priced at less than half the price of other games in the genre.\n\nThe game takes place after the events of \"\" and the introduction reveals what happened before the actual story took place. In ancient times, Earth was involved in a massive conflict between Mental, an evil extraterrestrial being who wants to rule the universe, and the Sirians, a technologically advanced sentient alien race that left many of its artifacts to be discovered by humanity. In the 22nd century, Mental and his army of grotesquely twisted monsters return to Earth intending to destroy humanity. The humans are quickly overwhelmed and driven back to Earth. As a last resort, humanity uses the \"Time-Lock\". This mysterious Sirian artifact contains the power to transport a single person back to a chosen point in time. Because of his bravery in fighting these monsters, Sam \"Serious\" Stone is chosen to use the Time-Lock in hopes that he will defeat Mental and change the course of history. As the game opens, Sam appears in Egypt. He travels from one Egyptian monument to the next, fighting against the monsters Mental sent after him along the way. During Sam's journey, Sam is able to find and activate a hidden Sirian communicator in the shape of an obelisk located in Luxor, which summons a Sirian starship to Earth from deep space. Sam rushes to the Great Pyramids of Giza in order to rendezvous with the starship, only to be cornered by Mental's general, Ugh Zan III. After defeating the giant, Sam then teleports himself onto the starship. While Sam is aboard the \"SSS Centerprice\", he leaves a phone message to Mental telling him that \"he has a special delivery package for him\" and sets a course to Sirius, the Sirian homeworld.\n\n\"The Second Encounter\" starts where the previous game left off, with Sam traveling to Sirius on the SSS Centerprice. Unfortunately, the starship is accidentally hit by the \"Croteam crate-bus\" and plummets down to Earth's surface. As the starship falls, Sam reads the coordinates and frets about crash-landing into Egypt again, but instead he crashes into Central America in the Mayan age, with the starship now heavily damaged upon impact. However, not all hope is lost, since the Sirians left a \"back-up starship\" on Earth, which was a fail-safe in case anything ever happened to the SSS Centerprice. However, since this back-up starship is located in a different time and age than where and when Sam currently is, he will have to uncover the locations of the Sirian portals that will help him reach his destination. With this new objective, Sam storms through Mesoamerica, then travels to Mesopotamia and finally to Medieval Europe where the back-up starship is located. During his journey, Sam battles two of Mental's portal guardians: a powerful Mayan spirit named Kukulkan the Wind God and a biomechanical creature called the Exotech Larva. Finally, in front of the Cathedral of Sacred Blood, Sam confronts the last obstacle to overcome on his path to the Holy Grail, Mordekai the Summoner. After a glorious battle with Mordekai and his spawning minions, The Summoner is finally silenced forever. In the Cathedral, Sam lifts the Holy Grail in the palms of his hands, followed by his sarcastic confessions of his sins in a booth to Mental, during which he tells Mental that \"he's coming to get him.\" During the end credits, Sam activates the back-up starship, which turns out to be a rocket, and travels back into space toward Sirius, with the \"Croteam Big-Heads\" cheering him on. The story continues on to \"Serious Sam II\".\n\nOther than the more varied locations, \"The Second Encounter\" features some additional weapons—a chainsaw, a flamethrower, a sniper rifle, and the powerful Serious Bomb—and a number of new monsters that Sam has to face. This game has also seen the release of a level-pack titled \"Dark Island\", featuring fan-made levels for single and multiplayer mode. \"The Second Encounter\" soundtrack featured three instrumental songs from the Croatian heavy-metal band Undercode.\n\nCroteam created their own engine for use in both \"The First Encounter\" and \"The Second Encounter\". Named the \"Serious Engine\", it is designed to cope with extremely large view distances and massive numbers of models by implementing level of detail rendering. Most contemporary FPS engines were developed for a limited draw distance and only a few animating models (i.e. enemies) on screen at a time. The Serious Engine is very efficient, capable of maintaining dozens of moving enemies (often stampedes) and enormous enemies, even on a modest system challenging the well known id Tech, Unreal Engine or Source engines. The \"Serious Engine\" can render through both Direct3D or OpenGL and, while it does not support pixel or vertex shaders, it is optimised for Direct3D 7's hardware transformation, clipping and lighting. The \"Serious Engine\" is available for licensing from Croteam.\n\nA more powerful iteration of the \"Serious Engine\" was developed for use in \"Serious Sam 2\" and is known as \"Serious Engine 2\". It supports many features of modern GPUs such as pixel and vertex shaders, HDR, bloom and parallax mapping.\n\nSerious Engine 3 was used in \"Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter\" and \"Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter\". It includes detailed shading, and enemies are completely remodeled to look more realistic. This engine is also being developed to harness the full capacity of HDR and High Definition mapping. An updated version, Serious Engine 3.5, is used in \"\".\n\nThe latest version is the Serious Engine 4, which Croteam used in their most recent game, The Talos Principle.\n\nIn March 2016, Croteam released Serious Engine v1.10 as free and open source software on GitHub under the GNU General Public License v2.\n\nIn November 2001, Global Star Software announced the completion of a Palm OS version of \"The First Encounter\" developed by InterActive Vision, to be released in early December. The game included 15 levels, and came in both color and monochrome. The game was released on 6 December 2001, as well as two demos for the color and the monochrome versions of the game.\n\nThe Xbox edition of \"Serious Sam\" had notable differences including the model of Sam being changed from the model of \"The First Encounter\" to form a more cartoon style Sam, removing the shades to make him look less like Duke Nukem and more like he does today. The Xbox version includes all of the levels from both of the PC games. As a result, weapons from \"The Second Encounter\" were added to the levels that were part of \"The First Encounter\" on PC. The levels were made smaller by removing the areas outside of the playing area. Unlike the PC version, Sam can't exit too far out of the playing area. This is due to the smaller amount of memory available in the Xbox. The gameplay was given a more arcade touch. A life system was implemented into the single-player game making use of the score. Every 100,000 points grants the player a new life, which allows respawning at the place of death rather than at a save point. Combo points were added for killing multiple enemies at the same time, which allows the player to increase his/her score at a fast pace. Further changes to the game include the addition of treasure and the tweaking of save points. Save points are designated by a red phone booth. Auto-aiming was also added to the Xbox version to compensate for the degree of control usually offered by a keyboard and mouse setup.\n\nCroteam took their publishing rights from 2K Games to new startup Devolver Digital, after 2K Games became uninterested in \"Serious Sam\", waiting for their long rival \"Duke Nukem Forever\" to finish.\nBoth episodes were remade using Serious Engine 3. They featured updated visuals, better performance and lush environments, all in high-definition. The remakes featured 16-player online co-op (4-player in the Xbox Live Arcade version), deathmatch and a new game-mode called \"Co-Op Tournament\".\n\nThe remake of the first episode, \"Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter\", was released on 24 November 2009 for Microsoft Windows through Steam, on 13 January 2010 for Xbox 360 through the Xbox Live Arcade and on 20 March 2017 for Linux through Steam thanks to the Fusion Engine.\nThe remake of the second episode, \"Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter\", was released on 28 April 2010 for Microsoft Windows through Steam, on 22 September 2010 for Xbox 360 through the Xbox Live Arcade and on 4 April 2017 for Linux through Steam, again thanks to the Fusion Engine.\nOn 14 January 2011, the DLC titled \"Fusion\" was released on Steam, which merged the levels of \"The First Encounter\" into \"The Second Encounter\". This DLC was free for everyone who owned both encounters on Steam.\nAdditionally, \"The Second Encounter HD\" was expanded with new piece of DLC called \"Legend of the Beast\". Released on 15 May 2012, it contained new maps for the Survival and Multiplayer modes and a new, short set of campaign missions.\n\nIn the United States, \"Serious Sam: The First Encounter\" sold 83,000 copies by October 2001.\n\n\"The First Encounter\" was the recipient of various editorial and consumer praise, with an overall review ratio of 87/100 on Metacritic. It also received numerous awards, including multiple Game of the Year awards.\n\n\"Serious Sam\" won \"The Electric Playground\"s \"Best Independent PC Game\" prize, and was a nominee in the show's \"Best Shooter for PC\", \"Best Graphics in a PC Game\" and \"Best Action Game for PC\" categories.\n\n\n\"The Second Encounter\" was also met with critical acclaim, with an overall ratio of 85/100 on Metacritic, and the Game of the Month February 2002 by GameSpot.\n"}

{"id": "4608805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4608805", "title": "Sidewalks Entertainment", "text": "Sidewalks Entertainment\n\nSidewalks Entertainment (1988–present) is a weekly American television series that is a combination of a talk show, magazine show and variety show featuring celebrity interviews, music, artistic and novelty acts, and rising performers. The 30-minute program is primarily produced in the San Francisco Bay Area with segments from other parts of the country, including Los Angeles and New York.\n\nRichard R. Lee is the creator and executive producer, as well as lead editor and webmaster of SidewalksTV.com. On-air personalities Cindy Rhodes and Rafael Siegel are also co-producers.\n\nDuring the first six years, the show was known as Sidewalks. The producers decided to add \"Entertainment\" to the program's title, so viewers would understand it was an entertainment show and not a show related to public works or about concrete walkways. On websites and television grids, the program is listed as \"Sidewalks Entertainment\", although hosts, guests and on-air graphics may still refer to the program as \"Sidewalks\".\n\nAs of April 14, 2007, the show has produced 256 regular editions, along with a number of special episodes and temporary shows.\n\nThe current version of \"Sidewalks\" is primarily a celebrity-based interview and music show, but the original concept was somewhat different.\n\nThe initial draft was to feature street performers, who are also known as \"sidewalk performers\" (hence the show's title). Cameras would follow and showcase the street performers in San Francisco or at the studio where \"Sidewalks\" was produced. Shortly before production began, the street performer segment was dropped due to time and a lack of interest from some of the money-starved talents. Only a handful of street performers eventually appeared on the series.\n\nThe early years of \"Sidewalks\" became a TV showcase for unknown aspiring musicians and artists. Talents appeared with at least one full-length performance, followed by a short interview. For some of the talents, the show produced exclusive music videos of the acts. The \"Sidewalks\" clips became one of the trademarks of the production for guests and viewers (after airing on an episode, the videos went on to become demonstration reels for the guests and also appeared on some international television programs).\n\nIn 1990, the show expanded its format and experimented with national music videos. Along with musical clips from popular artists such as Mariah Carey, Jessica Simpson, and Destiny's Child, well-known musical stars, ranging from Fred Schneider of The B-52's to then-newcomer Mary J. Blige, became guests. Around 1992, the show journeyed into more celebrity interviews, which now included actors from TV and films. The regional show became part of the national media tour, where celebrities would come on a TV show to pitch or promote their projects. The \"Sidewalks\" host would conduct interviews either in-person or from a satellite tour.\n\nSome of the national guests who have appeared on the show:\n\n\"Sidewalks\" also took its production remotely to showcase a variety of events and conventions. Events such as KMEL radio's Summer Jam event, the nationwide Lollapalooza concert tour, Walt Disney's Aladdin ice show, The National Association of Recording Merchandisers (NARM), The Renaissance Pleasure Faire, the comic and fantasy convention WonderCon, behind-the-scenes at Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus and movie premieres were featured. The Bay Area Music Awards (Bammies) (later renamed as the California Music Awards) became one of the show's major annual events.\n\nIn 2003, the show's production went bi-coastal, thanks to returning on-air personality of Siegel, who conducted celebrity interviews on the East Coast. He had a number of prominent interviews with such stars as Wyclef Jean, Heather Headley, and Gang Starr.\n\nThe on-air personalities for \"Sidewalks\" have been a talented mix of newcomers, many of whom are getting their first opportunities in front of a camera.\n\nThe show's 17th season is currently hosted by Cindy Rhodes, Rafael Siegel and Richard R. Lee, with correspondents Natalie Manuel and Eve Galazin.\n\nHost/producer Rhodes has been the longest mainstay to the program since 1993. She has interviewed a majority of the celebrity interviews and is producing the satellite media tours segments. Host/producer Siegel, who originally started with the stage name \"Rafael Hernandez\", joined the show in 1994 as viewer-turned production crew member-turned host. Siegel returned to the show in 2003 as an East Coast correspondent. In 2005, he moved back to the West Coast where \"Sidewalks\" is taped and joined the current hosting team.\n\nThe first set of nine shows during season one was hosted by Robert Guarino, Rosie Sorenson and Mel Menefee. The older Menefee became the show's on-screen gimmick between 1988 through 1994. The \"Mel Menefee\" character was an ongoing feature as the producers used Menefee's zaniness to form comedic situations, while the other personalities were hosting the episodes. When the show returned after a year hiatus, Menefee was joined by other personalities, most notably Denise Yvonne (now using the name Dee Jones). Other personalities that appeared for a number of seasons were Marci Camacho, Sibyl Motley, Jennifer Parnoff, and Veronica Ornelas.\n\n\"Sidewalks\" also gives college students their first on-air experience. Eboni Warnking, Shereelynn Manlangit, Monica Calzada, Oakland Raiderettes cheerleader Michelle Marquez, and Nadine Toren have been some of the interns.\n\nIn early 1988, San Francisco Bay Area resident Richard R. Lee got a chance to create and produce his first television show at Televents, a local El Cerrito, California cable station, after he helped and worked on various studio productions. That TV show became \"Sidewalks\", which went before the cameras in May and debuted its first episode on September 1, 1988.\n\nThe production schedule of \"Sidewalks\" has been irregular (due to TV station and equipment availability), although the show has never left the air since 1988. \"Sidewalks\" produced nine shows during season one. Almost a year later, the production returned for several more years at the retitled cable company Bay Cablevision (later purchased by various cable companies including AT&T and Comcast).\n\nIn 1994, Lee brought the production to KCRT-TV, a non-commercial Richmond, California TV station, where Lee was already working at for a couple of years. Throughout the decade run, the TV show was an intermittent co-production between Lee and the station until 2004.\n\nThe show is now solely produced by Sidewalks Entertainment, Inc., a California corporation developed by Rhodes and Lee, to further the production.\n\nThe main producers / hosts and a new team are currently working on re-launching the original concept into a potential national broadcast TV series. They are calling the forthcoming version, \"Sidewalks: The Entertainment Project\" (a title that may change when the new show premieres).\n\nIn 2005, the team produced a new one-hour \"test pilot\", which sports among things a new logo and theme music. In the pilot, the segments were interviews with American Idol's LaToya London, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy's Carson Kressley, young actress AnnaSophia Robb, the pop music group From The Desk of Sally, a Kelly Clarkson video, and a feature about finding a talent agent. The pilot is designed to showcase the new production to commercial stations and TV networks.\n\nWhile the team is developing the new version, the producers and hosts are continuing their long-running \"Sidewalks Entertainment\" and \"\" series with brand new episodes. Parts of the \"test pilot\" were recycled into two episodes (\"American Idols\" and \"Talent Agents\") of \"Sidewalks Entertainment\"'s 16th season.\n\n\"Sidewalks\" receives music video clips from various record companies. In 1992, the show opened its fifth season with a set of music video editions. The initial reaction to the video shows didn't fared well with viewers, because the regular lineup of interviews, musical guests and artistic acts disappeared for a short time. Producer Lee decided to create a spin-off series to handle the load of clips. was born. Currently, \"Sidewalks: Video Nite\" is a regular series on KCRT-TV and some selected episodes are aired in other markets.\n\nAlong with \"Sidewalks Entertainment\" and \"Sidewalks: Video Nite\", the program’s official website, SidewalksTV.com, has become its own entity. Creator and executive producer Lee has been the webmaster for the entire variation of the site.\n\nOriginally appearing as a small, couple page website on Geocities and Xoom, the site featured basic information about the TV show and its staff. As time passed, the site moved onto other servers, presented on-line articles and displayed video clips. From the beginning until fall 2006, the site used exclusively Real video clips as its choice of web streaming. The latest clips are now encoded in Flash video for better platform delivery.\n\nThe main spotlight of the website is celebrity interviews. Since 2003, majority of the show’s interviews have been presented on the site. Generally, the website displays the complete interview with a celebrity, whereas the TV show may exhibit an edited or shorter version of the same interview due to dated content or time allotment. Many of the interviews have debuted on the website days or weeks before it appeared on an episode of \"Sidewalks\".\n\nThe website has also been presenting its own interviews and special segments taped by the \"Sidewalks\" production crew or, occasionally, an outside supplier. The crew has been recording multiple segments of an interview that can be used as separate web content. Some of the exclusive web presentations include interviews with rapper David Banner and R&B singer Raz-B; movie coverage of films “Catch A Fire” and “The Pursuit of Happiness;” behind-the-scenes interviews at The California Music Awards and sci-fi/comic convention WonderCon; and special features such as the audio mixing of movies, special health segments, and KBLX radio station’s Kevin Brown Anniversary Party.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Lee and production member Justin Langston launched the program’s blog, Sidewalks On The Corner. The blog features articles and music and movie reviews.\n\nSince May 2006, SidewalksTV.com has also been releasing selected clips on other digital platforms, such as YouTube and MySpace.\n\n\n"}

Born in rural Virginia he served in the Confederacy during the American Civil War and later as a civilian scout for the US Army during the Indian Wars.\nBefore his untimely death, Texas Jack became a legendary figure in the American Old West as a western showman performing dramas on the stage throughout the country, and was immortalized in dime novels published around the world.\n\nOmohundro was born in Palmyra on the Pleasure Hill farm in Fluvanna County, Virginia, on July 26, 1846, to John Burwell and Catherine Baker Omohundro of Anglo-American ancestry. He attended grammar school in Fluvanna and at an early age showed a strong skill in hunting and fishing.\n\nAt the start of the American Civil War, Omohundro attempted to join his older brother, Orville, in the Confederate Army. He was twice refused for his age, but was allowed to serve as a courier at the headquarters of the Virginia Militia under Major General John B. Floyd. Because of his youth and knowledge of the countryside he became known as the \"Boy Scout of the Confederacy\". In February 1864, at the age of 17, he successfully enlisted as a private in Company G of the 5th Virginia Cavalry, part of the Army of Northern Virginia, and was soon serving directly in General J.E.B. Stuart's command as a courier and scout. At the Battle of Yellow Tavern he delivered a scouting report to J.E.B. Stuart only minutes before the General was killed in battle. During the Battle of Trevilian Station, Omohundro was wounded and admitted to the Confederate States General Hospital in Charlottesville on June 20, 1864. After recovering from his injuries, and a short leave home, he returned to his Company and scouted under the command of General Lunsford Lomax. Following the Third Battle of Winchester, the 5th Virginia Cavalry was consolidated with the 15th Virginia Cavalry, where Omohundro scouted under General Fitzhugh Lee during the last months of the war.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Omohundro left Virginia at age 19 for Florida. After a short time he moved on to Texas, arriving at the Taylor Ranch near Brazos, where he began working as a cowboy participating in cattle drives, notably on the Chisholm Trail. After one drive across Arkansas to a meat-poor Tennessee, he was given nickname \"Texas Jack\" by the locals. On another drive, Omohundro found a five-year-old boy orphaned after a Native American raid killed his family. He brought the boy to safety in Fort Worth, and the boy later took the name Texas Jack Jr. in homage, going on to run the \"Texas Jack's Wild West Show and Circus\" in 1903 in South Africa.\n\nIn 1869, Texas Jack moved to Fort Hays, Kansas, where he met California Joe Milner and Wild Bill Hickok, the latter being sheriff of Ellis County at the time. Later that year, Jack met and befriended William F. \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody, who was working with the 5th U.S. Cavalry at Fort McPherson, and Jack was hired as a scout and trail guide during the Indian Wars. Special permission had to be obtained as the U.S. Government did not generally permit the employment of ex-Confederate soldiers. During the Battle of Summit Springs, Texas Jack captured his well known white horse from Indian Chief Tall Bull. \nTexas Jack moved to Cottonwood Springs, Nebraska, where, aside from his work as a scout for the government, he made a lucrative living leading hunting expeditions for American and foreign parties which were popular at the time. Notably, Texas Jack, together with Cody, led the highly publicized royal hunt of 1872 with Grand Duke Alexei of Russia and several American military figures, including General Philip Sheridan, General George Custer, and Colonel James Forsyth.\nLater in 1874, Texas Jack guided the Earl of Dunraven though Yellowstone and Geyserland.\nIn 1876, Texas Jack led Sir John Rea Reid and his party on a hunt around the Bighorn Mountains and Sweetwater country.\n\nIn December 1872, Omohundro and Cody debuted the first Wild West show, \"Scouts of the Prairie\", in Chicago written and produced by Ned Buntline. Texas Jack's performance was well-received by critics and featured the first rope act performed on the American stage. The show starred Giuseppina Morlacchi, a dancer and actress from Milan, Italy, who was performing in the theater circuit with her \"Morlacchi Ballet Troupe\" when she was invited to join \"Scouts of the Prairie\" with the group. She and Texas Jack fell in love and were married on August 31, 1873 at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Rochester, NY.\n\nIn 1873, Buntline left, and Wild Bill Hickok joined the group to headline in a new play called \"Scouts of the Plains\". Hickok did not enjoy acting, often hiding behind scenery, and in one show he shot the spotlight when it focused on him. He was released from the group after a few months.\n\nDesiring a lighter tour schedule, Texas Jack parted ways with Cody, and in 1877 he formed his own acting troupe in St. Louis, known as the \"Texas Jack Combination\" featuring Morlacchi, Arizona John Burke, the Modoc War scout Donald McKay, trick-shot Maud Oswald, and several Sweetwater & Warm Spring Indians. In May of that year he debuted \"Texas Jack in the Black Hills\", written by Harry Seymour, to rave reviews. \nOther plays the combination performed included \"The Trappers Daughter\", \"Life on the Border\", and \"The French Spy\".\n\nIn the late 19th century, dime novels depicting frontier life were becoming common, and Texas Jack became a popular subject of these stories. The dime novels, printed on inexpensive wood pulp paper and costing five to ten cents each, were published weekly or monthly. One of the first of these novels was titled \"Texas Jack; or The White King of the Pawnees\", written by Ned Buntline, and first appeared in 1872. Texas Jack's popularity grew as he was featured on covers by publishers including Beadle's New York Dime Library, The Nickle Library, Log Cabin Library, DeWitt's Ten Cent, Street and Smith, and others. Many of these stories were written by the prolific author Col. Prentiss Ingraham. Omohundro wrote articles in newspapers across the country recalling his hunting and scouting stories, and is credited as having authored one dime novel titled \"Ned Wylde, the Boy Scout\" for Beadle and Adams in 1876.\n\nIn 1900, Joel Chandler Harris wrote \"On the Wing of Occasions\", a series for the \"Saturday Evening Post\", that featured Texas Jack and the Confederate Secret Service in a fictional plot to kidnap President Lincoln. At the time the stories caused some outrage since it associated Texas Jack with John Wilkes Booth, and after publication Harris received several letters objecting to Texas Jack's portrayal and attempts to clear his name.\n\nIn 1906, Verlagshaus für Volkslitteratur und Kunst, Berlin, published a series of dime novels in German, titled \"\"Texas Jack, Der Grosse Kundschafter\" (Texas Jack, The Great Scout). Inspired by Omohundro, the stories are of the fictional Jack Hawkins, an orphan who becomes a scout and cowboy in the American West engaging in skirmishes with Indians and opium smugglers, while some stories are set during the Mormon War and in Maximilian's Mexico. In Germany the novels were republished in three subsequent series, and they were translated into eight languages - French \"Texas Jack, la Terreur Des Indiens\" (Texas Jack, the Terror of the Indians), Swedish \"Texas Jack, Amerikas mest berömde indianbekämpare\" (Texas Jack, Americas Famous Indian Fighter), Finnish, Danish, Polish, Dutch, Portuguese, and Italian.\n\nIn 1966, Lion, a weekly comic by Fleetway, published a series about Omohundro titled \"Texas Jack\", which was released in the United Kingdom and Australia after earlier success they had with other Western themed comics such as \"Cowboy Comics\", \"Buffalo Bill\", and \"Kit Carson\"\". Unlike earlier dime novels, they were formatted like comics, and the stories were illustrated using panels. In 1972, the Lion comics were translated into Spanish and reissued with new cover art by the Rollán publishing house of Madrid for distribution in Spain.\n\nTexas Jack and Morlacchi settled in Massachusetts with a home in downtown Lowell and a small farm in Billerica. In the spring of 1880, after several performances in the region the couple decided to sojourn in the silver-mining town of Leadville, Colorado. There Omohundro became acquainted with Horace Tabor and briefly joined Tabor's Light Cavalry, a local militia formed to kept order in the newly founded town. A few months after arriving, Texas Jack contracted a cold which developed into pneumonia, he died weeks later. The funeral was well-attended, and he was given full military honors, with several military companies in attendance firing a three-volley salute as his flag-draped coffin was lowered into the ground. His final resting place is Evergreen Cemetery in Leadville. Shortly after Texas Jack's death, Morlacchi returned to their home in Lowell. She never toured again.\n\nAfter several years the grave fell into disrepair, and a traveling group of comedians raised funds to provide for its upkeep. In 1908, while passing through Leadville, Cody visited the cemetery and commissioned a granite grave marker for his old friend, mistakenly listing Texas Jack's age as 39 years.\n\nIn 1980, the Texas Jack Association was formed to preserve and promote Texas Jack's memory.\n\nIn 1994, Texas Jack Omohundro was inducted into the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in the Hall of Great Western Performers.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16865093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16865093", "title": "The Description of Britain", "text": "The Description of Britain\n\nThe Description of Britain, also known by its Latin name (\"On the Situation of Britain\"), was a literary forgery perpetrated by Charles Bertram on the historians of England. It purported to be a 15th-century manuscript by the English monk Richard of Westminster, including information from a lost contemporary account of Britain by a Roman general (\"\"), new details of the Roman roads in Britain in the style of the Antonine Itinerary, and \"an antient map\" as detailed as (but improved upon) the works of Ptolemy. Bertram disclosed the existence of the work through his correspondence with the antiquarian William Stukeley by 1748, provided him \"a copy\" which was made available in London by 1749, and published it in Latin in 1757. By this point, his Richard had become conflated with the historical Richard of Cirencester. The text was treated as a legitimate and major source of information on Roman Britain from the 1750s through the 19th century, when it was progressively debunked by John Hodgson, Karl Wex, B. B. Woodward, and J. E. B. Mayor. Effects from the forgery can still be found in works on British history and it is generally credited with having named the Pennine Mountains.\n\nCharles Bertram was an English expatriate living in Copenhagen who began a flattering correspondence with the antiquarian William Stukeley in 1747 and was vouched for by Hans Gram, the royal librarian to King Frederick V. After a few further letters, Bertram mentioned \"a manuscript in a friend's hands of Richard of Westminster... a history of Roman Brittain... and an antient map of the island annex'd.\" A \"copy\" of its script was shown to David Casley, the keeper of the Cotton Library, who \"immediately\" described it as around 400 years old. Stukeley thereafter always treated Bertram as reliable. He \"press'd Mr Bertram to get the manuscript into his hands, if possible... as the greatest treasure we now can boast of in this kind of learning.\" Stukeley received the text piecemeal over a series of letters which he made available at the Royal Society's Arundel Library in London in 1749. He had received a drawing of Bertram's map by early 1750, which he also placed at the library.\n\nBertram described his text's author as \"Richard, monk of Westminster\" (). There had been a monk named Richard at Westminster Abbey in the mid-15th century and this was the approximate date offered by Bertram to Stukeley. Stukeley preferred instead to identify Bertram's \"Richard of Westminster\" with Richard of Cirencester ('), who had lived at Westminster in the late 14th century and was known to have journeyed to Rome and to have compiled another history known as the \"Historial Mirror\". Bertram fully adopted the suggestion and published his account under the name ', from the archaic Latin form of Cirencester's name.\n\nIt has since become clear that the text was the work of an 18th-century forger. Bertram claimed to have borrowed the text from a friend who admitted he had come by it as an act of theft from an English library. Its complete absence from other manuscript lists and the lack of any trace of it among Bertram's surviving papers in Copenhagen has generally led to the conclusion that Bertram himself was Pseudo-Richard.\n\nStukeley read his analysis of the work and its itineraries before the Society of Antiquaries and published his paper with its extracts in 1757. He was excited that the text provided \"more than a hundred names of cities, roads, people, and the like: which till now were absolutely unknown to us\" and found it written \"with great judgment, perspicuity, and conciseness, as by one that was altogether master of his subject\". His account of the itineraries included an engraving reorienting Bertram's map to place north at the top.\n\nLater in 1757, at Stukeley's urging, Bertram published the full text in a volume alongside Gildas's \"Ruin of Britain\" and the \"History of the Britons\" traditionally ascribed to Nennius. Bertram's preface noted that the work \"contains many fragments of a better time, which would now in vain be sought for elsewhere\". The preface goes on to note that, \"considered by Dr. Stukeley... a jewel... worthy to be rescued from destruction\", Bertram printed it \"from respect for him\". The volume included a map as well, differing from Stukeley's in several features apart from its orientation.\n\nIt contained 18 routes () of the type found in the Antonine Itinerary, compiled from fragmentary accounts of a Roman general, adding over 60 new and previously unknown stations to those mentioned in the legitimate account. Best of all, it filled up the entire map of Scotland with descriptions and the names of peoples, the part of Britain about which the least was known with any certainty. It would later be determined that it was actually a clever mosaic of information gleaned from the works of Caesar, Tacitus, William Camden, John Horsley, and others, enhanced with Bertram's own fictions.\n\nBertram's letters to Stukeley proposed that the map accompanying the text was even older than Pseudo-Richard's text. His letters state that he bought a copperplate to engrave it himself. Either this original copperplate or a freehand drawing was sent to Stukeley in late 1749 or early 1750 and formed the basis of the version reoriented and published by Stukeley in his 1757 \"Account\".\n\nBertram's own engraving appeared in his 1757 \"Three Authors\" but was dated to 1755. It retained the \"original\" map's orientation, placing east at the top of the map, but did not disguise that Bertram had tidied it up. It is inscribed with a note that it was engraved and done entirely by Bertram. Stukeley later employed this version for the 2nd edition of his own \"\", published posthumously in 1776.\n\nOnce it had been accepted as genuine, \"The Description of Britain\" exerted a profound effect upon subsequent theories, suppositions, and publications of history. It was the premier source of information—sometimes the only source—for well over 100 years.\n\nContemporary authoritative works include Gibbon's \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\", which is well-footnoted with his sources of information. \"De Situ Britanniae\" appears among his references to sources on ancient Britain, usually cited to its emended author, Richard of Cirencester. Major-General William Roy's technical ability at surveying was the inspiration for the creation of the Ordnance Survey. He spent much of his research on ancient Scottish history trying to follow the fictional itineraries described in \"De Situ Britanniae\". His historical work, \"Military Antiquities of the Romans in Britain\", relies on the forgery and is consequently lacking as a contribution to history, though his maps are still held in the highest regard. William Forbes Skene, in his introduction to \"Celtic Scotland\", written after \"De Situ Britanniae\" was debunked, disparaged several once-influential histories that relied on it, including Pinkerton's \"Enquiry\", Chalmers's \"Caledonia\", Roy's \"Military Antiquities\", and Robert Stuart's \"Caledonia Romana\".\n\nNo serious modern historian cites an argument based on the fictional \"De Situ Britanniae\", but conclusions based upon it are still cited indirectly. For example, the influential and respected Barry Cunliffe's \"Iron Age Communities in Britain\" places the ancient Selgovae people far to the east of their only known location, contradicting their placement by the sole legitimate source, Ptolemy. This misplacement relied on William Roy's attempt to make the map of the peoples of ancient Scotland fit \"De Situ Britanniae\".\n\nEnough doubts had arisen by 1838 that the English Historical Society did not include \"The Description of Britain\" in its list of important historical works. Still, the end did not come until 1845. In that year the German writer Karl Wex effectively challenged the authority of the \"Description\" in the \"Rheinisches Museum\". He had been working on a new edition of Tacitus's \"Agricola\". Consulting the \"Description\", he found that it included impossible transcription errors that had been introduced to editions of Tacitus by Venetian printers in the 15th century. His work was translated into English and printed by the \"Gentleman's Magazine\" in October 1846.\n\nBritish scholars were slow to accept the truth. Some of the routes mentioned by the work had seemed to have been subsequently borne out and excuses were made for the known errors. Further evidence of the falsity of \"The Description of Britain\" came out in the following years, however, until no serious effort could be made in defense of the document. Bertram had on several occasions adopted variant readings and hypotheses unknown before Camden. Scholars continued to hem both out of embarrassment (the same information that Wex used had been available to them all along) and because they now knew that their accounts of history had been based on a fiction rather than legitimate information. The final confirmation that the \"Description\" was spurious came in 1869, a quarter century after Wex's publication. As part of the Rolls Series, the \"Historial Mirror\" written by the real Richard of Cirencester (his only surviving work) was closely examined over the 1860s by J.E.B. Mayor, the librarian of the University of Cambridge. In his 1869 preface to the second volume of the work, he included a thorough 90-page condemnation of Bertram's manuscript. Blame fell hardest on the reputation of William Stukeley, although it also impugned Gibbon, Roy, and other scholars who had accepted it.\n\nOnce the work was no longer defensible, various accounts came forward claiming that there had been serious doubts about the \"Description\" prior to Wex. These were somewhat less than accurate. In general, they attempted to conflate earlier concerns about \"Richard of Cirencester\"'s supposed sources or about his use of his sources with the more fundamental questions raised by Wex. An example is the 1911 \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" account, which asserts that Thomas Reynolds was \"skeptical as to the value of Bertram's manuscript\". Reynolds had been skeptical of the quality of Richard of Cirencester's information, but did not express any doubts about Bertram or the validity of the manuscript. Another tack of latter reviewers was to downplay the magnitude of the earlier acceptance and reliance on the \"Description\". In 1866 and 1867, B.B. Woodward, the librarian of Windsor Castle, wrote a series of articles for the \"Gentleman's Magazine\" that challenged the validity of the text. However, his characterisation of \"The Description of Britain\" as \"plainly a clumsy forgery by an unpractised hand\" is unfair. This same document had been examined in 1749 by David Casley, the keeper of the Cotton Library, and as late as 1840 Sir Frederic Madden of the manuscript department of the British Museum had not only expressed his belief in its validity but also criticised the English Historical Society for its omission of the \"Description of Britain\" in its 1838 list of important works.\n\nThanks to Roy and others' reliance on the \"Description\", a number of its inventions found their way onto the Ordnance Survey maps. Another example of the \"Description\"’s legacy were continuing references—including in the 1911 \"Encyclopædia Britannica\"—to a naval base at Dumbarton named Theodosia, long after its sole authority had been debunked.\n\nA passage in Bertram was credited in 1853 by Arthur Hussey as originating the name of the Pennines. In 2004, George Redmonds reassessed this, finding that numerous respected writers passed over the origin of the mountains' name in silence even in works dedicated to the topological etymology of Derbyshire and Lancashire. He found that the derivation from Bertram was widely believed and considered uncomfortable. In fact, the name appears at least as early as Camden and Bertram was responsible (at most) with popularizing it against other contenders such as Defoe's \"English Andes\".\n\n\n"}

The player can transform between Dave and Deva by activating pentagrams located at certain places throughout the game's levels. During gameplay, Dave/Deva is followed by a small flying camera as well as a cameraman, and the player can switch between the two camera views as desired. Occasionally, a news helicopter will also be present and scripted cutscenes will be viewed from an aerial perspective.\n\nThe pacing, exploration, and puzzle factor of the game is similar to that of other survival horror titles. As Dave, the player has access to a variety of guns, which are equipped with laser sights to assist the player in aiming. As Deva, the player uses spells to attack enemies. Spells do not require ammunition, but do deplete mana that regenerates slowly. Some enemies generate souls when killed, and Deva can inhale souls to replenish her mana. Deva also has the ability to fly and regenerate health when standing in fire. The game uses a checkpoint save system represented by television sets found in-game.\n\nThe game's script was written by Hubert Chardot, better known for his work in the \"Alone in the Dark\" series. Its theme is similar to \"The Running Man\", written by Stephen King, whose name is mentioned early in the game.\n\nAccording to \"Der Spiegel\", \"The Devil Inside\" was commercially unsuccessful.\n\nGameSpot's Greg Kasavin awarded the game a 6.8 out of 10, citing difficulties with the control scheme. In regards to the game's action sequences, Kasavin opined that \"some of the battles are scripted very well. [...] But other times, the combat is poor.\" The environments of the game were praised for their realism and atmosphere, while character models and sound effects were rated as plain. Overall, the game was described as competent but lacking polish. \"PC Gamer US\" gave the game a score of 79% in their January 2001 issue. The review praised the animations, camera angles, the use of a dual character, and the game's low learning curve. However, the review cited \"poor polygonal figures and texturing\", and some environmental bugs as the low points of the game.\n\nIn Poland, it was one of the first of the series of cheap premiere releases in the \"ExtraGra\" magazine. Shortly after the game's release, one of Poland's most popular TV stations, TVN aired a report on the game, accusing the distributor, CD Projekt of selling satanic games in commonly accessible kiosks. The epilepsy warning, which by the time was already common among video games released in Poland and almost omnipresent in Europe, was used as an example of the game's exceptionally negative impact on young people.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "198844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=198844", "title": "The Old Castle's Secret", "text": "The Old Castle's Secret\n\n\"The Old Castle's Secret\" is a 32-page funny animal comic book adventure/mystery/horror story written, drawn, and lettered by Carl Barks. It was first published by Dell Publishing in Four Color #189 (June 1948). Characters include Uncle Scrooge, Donald Duck, and Huey, Dewey, and Louie. The story is about a treasure hunt led by Uncle Scrooge through an old castle in Scotland. It is the first of Uncle Scrooge's comic book treasure hunts. The story was published with three one-page gag stories by Barks. The cover is the first comic book cover ever drawn by Barks. The story has been reprinted many times.\n\nScrooge McDuck, in his second appearance, recruits his nephews to search for a family treasure back in Dismal Downs, the old castle of The Clan McDuck, built in the middle of a swamp in Scotland. The treasure once belonged to Sir Quackly McDuck, but both the treasure and its owner disappeared during the siege of 1057. The Clan has been searching for the treasure for centuries but Scrooge, the last McDuck, thinks that he can locate it thanks to an X-Ray machine that can examine through the castle's walls. \n\nFinding the treasure proves to be the easy part of the mission, but they have to face a mysterious ghost that steals the treasure from them and repeatedly tries to dispose of them. They can't see it but they can see its shadow, that of a skeleton. During this, Scottie, the caretaker of the castle, seems to have been murdered by Sir Quackly, and Scrooge, Donald, and the Nephews are trapped on a locked battlement. The Nephews escape by swinging across into the surrounding moat, but can't get in. However, remembering the tale of Sir Swamphole McDuck who sealed the dungeons (due to the high cost of running a dungeon), they locate a secret passageway into the castle's dungeons through his fake grave site (his skeleton was inside his armor).\n\nScrooge and Donald remain on the battlement until Scrooge reveals he has a gun which can shoot the lock and unlock the door. Scrooge, embarrassed, tells Donald to give him \"a good, swift kick!\". While in the dungeon, the Nephews find the treasure box but are nearly attacked by the ghost and find the other way out of the dungeon; the pillar upon which Sir Swamphole's armor is resting is actually a door. Scrooge, Donald, and Huey, Dewey, and Louie find the invisibility spray and give chase to the ghost, now covered in mud and no longer invisible, through the swamp. The nephews and Donald tackle him to the ground and retrieve the treasure box. The ghost is revealed to be a thief who was impersonating Scottie (who had died of old age years before) using a special spray-like formula that made him invisible but did not prevent his skeleton from casting a shadow. Donald then takes all the nephews' credit; they hadn't known the invisibility spray even existed). Enraged, the nephews then trick Donald into thinking the spray is a mosquito repellent, where they then make him completely invisible save his tail and legs.\n\nThe story is usually referred to as one of Barks' most memorable for several reasons. The plot borrows elements of horror and mystery stories, favorites of Barks; the old and mostly abandoned castle with its dark halls, hidden dungeons and crypts; ancestors' skeletons buried within the castle; the ancient McDuck cemetery with the graves of generations of the main characters' ancestors; the misty swamp, the threatening \"ghost\", and the imminent danger the characters sense. Barks detailed every panel to afford a sense of melancholy suitable for this rather moody story, and used pictures of old Scottish castles as references to add to the story's realism. \"The Old Castle's Secret\" is considered to be among Barks' best drawing efforts.\n\n\"The Old Castle's Secret\" marks the second appearance of Scrooge in a story but the first where Scrooge acts as the leader in a treasure expedition, a theme that Barks would use often for an Uncle Scrooge story. It introduces the Clan McDuck and gives a family history to the characters that would later be expanded by both Barks and his successors and firmly sets the character's origin in Scotland where a number of later stories would take place. Dismal Downs itself has been used as a setting for other stories, with its history and architecture expanded.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the first portable entry in the series, released for the PlayStation Vita. It was developed by SIE Bend Studio, with development overseen by Naughty Dog. The game was released as a launch title in Japan on December 17, 2011. It was launched in North America on February 14, 2012, Europe on February 22, 2012 and Australia on February 23, 2012. Set some time before the first game, the story follows Nathan Drake as he teams up with fellow treasure hunter Marisa Chase to find the lost city of Quivira, while dealing with crooked treasure hunter Jason Dante and his partner, warlord Roberto Guerro.\n\nThe story is set some time before the events of \"\", and begins in medias res with Nathan Drake following rival explorer Jason Dante through a temple complex in Panama. Dante has ordered his army of mercenaries to kill Drake on sight, and after a series of gunfights, the platform Drake is climbing is hit by an RPG.\n\nThe game then flashes back two weeks, when Drake and Dante, revealed to be old friends, arrive at a dig site in Panama headed by Dante's \"partner\" Marisa Chase, who doesn't trust him. At the site, they find corpses of Spanish conquistadors that were apparently poisoned and a grave marker with a Visigoth symbol. Chase also shows Drake an amulet that she hid from Dante. The dig is then interrupted by Dante's real partner, warlord Roberto Guerro. Guerro captures Drake and Chase, however they escape Guerro's base after Chase starts a diversionary fire.\n\nThey then go to the house of her grandfather Vincent Perez, who found the amulet at the site. Perez hired Dante to conduct further research after being diagnosed with terminal cancer, and Dante paid off Guerro for access to the site in return for a share of the treasure that Guerro will use to fund his conflict. Chase arrived at the site herself hoping to finish Perez's work. Upon returning to Perez's study, they learn that the marker referred to the Sete Cidades, an ancient Christian sect dedicated to finding the Seven Cities of Gold. Friar Marcos de Niza, a member of the sect, had led Coronado's expedition to find the city of Cíbola, also known as Quivira, only to find the villages of the Zuni.\n\nFollowing further clues, one referring to a \"Sword of Stephen\", they follow Perez's trail to a ruined Sete Cidades retreat. They find Perez, who succumbed to his illness, as well as evidence that leads Drake to suspect that de Niza had deliberately misled Coronado for reasons unknown. Drake then follows the ruins to a crypt that contains the Sword of Stephen - the personal sword of Esteban, de Niza's guide; however, they are interrupted by Dante, who had followed them with Guerro.\n\nGuerro takes the sword and Chase after pushing Dante off a balcony for insulting him. Drake reluctantly teams up with Dante to escape the ruins and Guerro's army, but are unable to stop Guerro from escaping with her. Dante decides to hire an army of mercenaries to rescue Chase and avenge himself on Guerro, and the two part ways after Drake objects. Although hesitant at first, Drake convinces Victor \"Sully\" Sullivan to help him find Chase and finish Perez's work. The two follow a map made from the charcoal rubbings of symbols found on the sword to a temple complex believed to house the entrance to Quivira. There they witness and fight through a battle between Dante's mercenaries and Guerro's men. Sully is injured in a fall, forcing Drake to continue by himself.\n\nDrake then fights through more of Dante's mercenaries - surviving the explosion from the prologue - and makes his way to the massive entrance of Quivira where he rescues Chase from the remnants of Guerro's army. After Chase insists that they continue, Drake uses the amulet on the gate to open it. The pair then cross a massive underground lake and make it to the Golden Abyss, a massive room whose walls are lined with gold. They also find the corpse of Esteban, who was sacrificed by Marcos. A geiger counter stowed in Chase's backpack then suddenly activates and reveals the gold to be radioactive. Realizing that the Quiviran populace had died out from radiation poisoning, they conclude that de Niza had sacrificed Esteban and his scouting party before deliberately misleading Coronado in order to prevent them from looting the irradiated gold.\n\nHowever, Dante arrives and reveals that he knew about the radiation, while still intending to sell the irradiated gold on the black market anyway. Drake defeats him in a fist fight and escapes with Chase as Dante verbally admonishes him for valuing principles above money. When they return to the gate, Chase detonates explosives that Guerro had planted beforehand, sealing Dante in the cavern for good. As the two escape the ensuing cave-in, Guerro appears and attacks them with a rocket launcher, trapping Chase under a fallen pillar. Drake fights and tricks Guerro into falling through a damaged bridge to his death with the Sword of Stephen. He then frees Chase and the two escape to the surface with Sully's help. Before they leave in a helicopter stolen by Sully, she tosses away the amulet, believing it belongs \"in hell\" with the rest of Quivira. It is also implied that the two start a relationship following the climax of the game.\n\nOn June 2, 2011, the official title for the game was unveiled as \"Golden Abyss\", and numerous hands-on previews of the game were released across several sites. This was the first public appearance of the game since its unveiling in January. Prior to the announcement though in May 2011, it was rumored that the game's title would be \"Uncharted: Golden Abyss\", before any official announcement from Sony. The game features touch and motion based controls for navigation and aiming, though these are optional control schemes. The game was developed by Sony Bend Studio, who were being overseen by Naughty Dog. The game has an optional touchscreen control feature and motion sensitive controls. In a demo at E3 2011, it was shown that weapons can be picked up and reloaded by tapping the weapon icon on-screen. Bend studio creative director John Garvin confirmed that Naughty Dog allowed them to use their mo-cap and voice-over studios. It was also confirmed that the game would contain over 2 hours of cutscenes. The game doesn't run on the full resolution of the OLED screen of the Vita (960 x 544), instead it runs about half the native resolution (720 x 408)\n\nNolan North revealed in an interview that he would return to play Drake, lending his voice acting talents along with motion capture work, as in the console games. He revealed as well that the story was also being written by Garvin. According to a motion capture video released from PlayStation, Richard McGonagle would be returning as well, reprising his role as Victor Sullivan. Naughty Dog co-president Christophe Balestra confirmed the game's stance in the franchise, as well as suggesting a greater focus on exploration rather than gunplay.\n\nThe 1.01 update added \"Black Market\", an in-game store which enables players to trade and receive bounty items that are collected in the game with other Vita players using the PS Vita's \"NEAR\" application. In addition to this, the patch also prepared the game to use the Treasure Map DLC pack. Patch update 1.02 fixed bugs and issues. Patch 1.03 enables players to unlock cards based on game collectibles for the upcoming \"Uncharted: Fight for Fortune\" game, and also improves the bounty drop from enemies.\n\nThe Treasure Map downloadable content (DLC) adds a treasure map for each chapter to help players easily locate all the collectibles in a chapter.\n\nThe musical score for\" Uncharted: Golden Abyss\" was composed by Sony PlayStation's Clint Bajakian and was the first major video game score recorded with full orchestra at Ocean Way Studios in Nashville with a 70 piece orchestra led and contracted by Alan Umstead of Nashville Music Scoring.\n\nThe game received generally positive reviews. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave it a 7/10, commenting that \"A story worthy of the franchise, \"Uncharted: Golden Abyss\" falls short in terms of pacing and controls, as the touchscreen gimmick takes the experience down a big notch.\" \"Eurogamer\" gave it an 8/10, stating that \"While the absence of multiplayer means it won't last you as long as previous instalments, new control options have allowed the developers to line the seams of Drake's adventure with flashy tassels and detailing that make for a varied and entertaining outing - perhaps even more so than its big brothers.\" \"Game Informer\" giving it an 8/10, commented \"For the first time, we're able to play a handheld game with the scale and production values of a home console title. The base level of craftsmanship on display in \"Golden Abyss\" means you'll get your money's worth – but not a penny more. I wish all the perspiration expelled in the making of the game had been complemented by a bit more inspiration.\" Game Revolution gave it 4 out of 5 stars, noting that \"[...] all the game's complaints won't detract from the simple fact that this is Uncharted on a handheld. It's just slightly diminished. \"Golden Abyss\" is more like \"Drake's Fortune\" than it is \"Deception\"-it doesn't span that many environments, has smaller set pieces, and lacks online multiplayer.\"\n\nGameSpot gave it a 7/10, feeling that \"\"Golden Abyss\" is full of disappointments. The action set pieces are great, but there's too few of them; the voice acting is exemplary, but the narrative doesn't do it justice; the touch and motion controls work well for some actions, but they ruin others. For every moment of enjoyment you have, something comes along to spoil it. Despite its problems, though, Golden Abyss still succeeds in delivering some intense, entertaining action and combat.\" GamesRadar gave it an 8/10, citing that \"It's mostly there - the charm, the gameplay, the visual presentation - but there are some key elements missing. The level design leaves much to be desired, and without the cinematic moments the experience simply isn't incredibly strong. It's still an extremely solid cover shooter with a strong story and some fine platforming elements, but as far as an Uncharted game, it comes up short of what we've come to expect.\" GameTrailers gave it an 8.6/10, calling the game \"A powerful tech demo for the PlayStation Vita, but it's also an engaging game that's a blast to play in spurts. Touch screen use is a little heavy-handed and it's missing those 'wow' moments we're used to getting from the franchise, but it's a solid action adventure with production values strong enough to quell any sense of system buyer's remorse.\" IGN's Greg Miller gave it an 8.5/10, stating that \"The game is great and an impressive launch title for the PlayStation Vita. It's just that the \"Uncharted\" series has been known for being a story-driven experience, and Golden Abyss goes in another direction. It's a beautiful, fun game with tons of collectibles, plenty of laughs, and some cool twists on a franchise PlayStation fans know so well. It's just not an instant classic like the other entries in the series.\" Anthony Severino of PlayStation LifeStyle gave the game a 9.5 out of 10 score in the first full review of the game.\n\n\"Golden Abyss\" received the first award at the Gamescom 2011 for \"Best Mobile Game\" before release. It is also nominated as \"Most Wanted Mobile Game\" at \"Computec Games Award\".\n"}
