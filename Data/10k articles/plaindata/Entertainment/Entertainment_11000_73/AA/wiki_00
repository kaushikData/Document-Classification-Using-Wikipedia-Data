{"id": "1176603", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1176603", "title": "1080i", "text": "1080i\n\n1080i (also known as Full HD or BT.709) is an abbreviation referring to a combination of frame resolution and scan type, used in high-definition television (HDTV) and high-definition video. The number \"1080\" refers to the number of horizontal lines on the screen. The \"i\" is an abbreviation for \"interlaced\"; this indicates that only the odd lines, then the even lines of each frame (each image called a video field) are drawn alternately, so that only half the number of actual image frames are used to produce video. A related display resolution is 1080p, which also has 1080 lines of resolution; the \"p\" refers to progressive scan, which indicates that the lines of resolution for each frame are \"drawn\" in on the screen sequence.\n\nThe term assumes a widescreen aspect ratio of (a rectangular TV that is wider than it is tall), so the 1080 lines of vertical resolution implies 1920 columns of horizontal resolution, or 1920 pixels × 1080 lines. A 1920 pixels × 1080 lines screen has a total of 2.1 megapixels (2.1 million pixels) and a temporal resolution of 50 or 60 interlaced fields per second. This format is used in the SMPTE 292M standard.\n\nThe choice of 1080 lines originates with Charles Poynton, who in the early 1990s pushed for \"square pixels\" to be used in HD video formats.\n\nWithin the designation \"1080i\", the \"i\" stands for interlaced scan. A frame of 1080i video consists of two sequential fields of 1920 horizontal and 540 vertical pixels. The first field consists of all odd-numbered TV lines and the second all even numbered lines. Consequently, the horizontal lines of pixels in each field are captured and displayed with a one-line vertical gap between them, so the lines of the next field can be interlaced between them, resulting in 1080 total lines. 1080i differs from 1080p, where the \"p\" stands for progressive scan, where all lines in a frame are captured at the same time. In \"native\" or \"pure\" 1080i, the two fields of a frame correspond to different instants (points in time), so motion portrayal is good (50 or 60 motion phases/second). This is true for interlaced video in general and can be easily observed in still images taken of fast motion scenes. However, when 1080p material is captured at 25 or 30 \"frames\"/second, it is converted to 1080i at 50 or 60 \"fields\"/second, respectively, for processing or broadcasting. In this situation both fields in a frame do correspond to the same instant. The field-to-instant relation is somewhat more complex for the case of 1080p at 24 \"frames\"/second converted to 1080i at 60 \"fields\"/second.\n\nThe field rate of 1080i is typically 60 Hz (i.e., 60 fields per second) for countries that use or used System M (NTSC and Brazilian PAL-M) as analog television system with 60 fields/sec (such as United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Philippines), or 50 Hz for regions that use or used 625-lines (PAL or SECAM) television system with 50 fields/sec (such as most of Europe, most of Africa, China, India, Australia, New Zealand, Middle East, and others). Both field rates can be carried by major digital television broadcast formats such as ATSC, DVB, and ISDB-T International. The frame rate can be implied by the context, while the field rate is generally specified after the letter i, such as \"1080i60\". In this case 1080i60 refers to 60 fields per second. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) prefers to use the resolution and \"frame rate\" (not field rate) separated by a slash, as in \"1080i/30\" and \"1080i/25\", likewise 480i/30 and 576i/25. Resolutions of 1080i60 or 1080i50 often refers to 1080i/30 or 1080i/25 in EBU notation.\n\n1080i is directly compatible with some CRT HDTVs on which it can be displayed natively in interlaced form, but for display on progressive-scan—e.g., most new LCD and plasma TVs, it must be deinterlaced. Depending on the television's video processing capabilities, the resulting video quality may vary, but may not necessarily suffer. For example, film material at 25fps may be deinterlaced from 1080i50 to restore a full 1080p resolution at the original frame rate without any loss. Preferably video material with 50 or 60 motion phases/second is to be converted to 50p or 60p before display.\n\nWorldwide, most HD channels on satellite and cable broadcast in 1080i. In the United States, 1080i is the preferred format for most broadcasters, with Discovery Communications, Viacom, Time Warner, Comcast owned networks broadcasting in the format; along with most smaller broadcasters. Only 21st Century Fox-owned television networks and Disney-owned television networks, along with MLB Network and a few other cable networks use 720p as the preferred format for their networks; A+E Networks channels converted from 720p to 1080i sometime in 2013 due to acquired networks already transmitting in the 1080i format. Many ABC affiliates owned by Hearst Television and former Belo Corporation stations owned by TEGNA, along with some individual affiliates of those three networks, air their signals in 1080i and upscale network programming for master control and transmission purposes, as most syndicated programming and advertising is produced and distributed in 1080i, removing a downscaling step to 720p. This also allows local newscasts on these ABC affiliates to be produced in the higher resolution (especially for weather forecasting presentation purposes for map clarity) to match the picture quality of their 1080i competitors.\n\nSome cameras and broadcast systems that use 1080 vertical lines per frame do not actually use the full 1920 pixels of a nominal 1080i picture for image capture and encoding. Common subsampling ratios include 3/4 (resulting in 1440x1080i frame resolution) and 1/2 (resulting in 960x1080i frame resolution). Where used, the lower horizontal resolution is scaled to capture and/or display a full-sized picture. Using half horizontal resolution and only one field of each frame (possibly with added anti-alias filtering or progressive capture) results in the format known as qHD, which has frame resolution 960x540 and 30 or 25 frames per second. Due to the chosen 16x16 pixel size for a compressed video packet known as a \"macroblock\" as used in ITU H.261 to H.264 video standards, a 1080 line video must be encoded as 1088 lines and cropped to 1080 by the de-compressor. The 720 line video format divides perfectly by 16 and therefore does not require any lines to be wasted.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27008752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27008752", "title": "201 (South Park)", "text": "201 (South Park)\n\n\"201\" is the sixth episode of the fourteenth season of \"South Park\", and the 201st overall episode of the series. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 21, 2010. The episode continued multiple storylines from the previous episode, \"200\", in which a group of angry celebrities demand South Park produce the Muslim prophet Muhammad. In \"201\", a superhero-like group of religious figures team up to save South Park from the celebrities and their monster Mecha-Streisand, while Eric Cartman learns the true identity of his father.\n\nThe episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. Like \"200\", it alludes to several past storylines and controversies from previous \"South Park\" episodes, especially Comedy Central's refusal to show images of Muhammad on the network following controversies in 2005 and 2007 when cartoons depicting Muhammad ran in European newspapers, resulting in riots and threats. Prior to the broadcast of \"201\", the radical Muslim organization Revolution Muslim posted a warning on their website that Parker and Stone risked being murdered for their depiction of Muhammad. Comedy Central modified Parker and Stone's version of the episode, obscuring all images and bleeping all references to Muhammad—to the effect of disruptively obscuring the entire two-minute moral conclusion of the story. Nevertheless, both \"200\" and \"201\" were nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program in 2010.\n\nThe censorship drew strong criticism of Comedy Central. Critics said that the network's action would encourage further threats from radical groups. \"201\" was not shown in repeats, has not been made available on the \"South Park\" website, and has not been shown in Sweden, Hungary, Australia or the Netherlands. In most places the episode \"Sexual Healing\" was shown instead of episode 201. In the United Kingdom, some parts were removed, and a short on-screen message appears, stating the outline of the removed parts and \"MTV (on Viva)\" or \"Comedy Central\" \"...has refused to air an image of Muhammad on their network\". According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by 3.5 million viewers, making it the most watched cable television program of the night.\n\nOn January 31, 2014, the original uncensored version was leaked when it was pulled from the South Park Studios servers and was posted online in its entirety without approval by Comedy Central.\n\nThe episode opens with Cartman, as his hand-puppet persona Mitch Conner, narrating a flashback to Connor's 1972 medical discharge from his Vietnam War tour of duty in a parody of a scene from the film \"Apocalypse Now\" as the song \"Time of the Season\" by the Zombies plays in the background. Back in the present, Mr. Garrison refuses to reveal the identity of Cartman's father, and instead sends Cartman to Dr. Mephisto. Meanwhile, the Ginger Separatist Movement and the townsfolk are negotiating the handover of Muhammad when Mecha-Streisand begins to attack South Park. Muhammad, who is visually obscured throughout the entire episode by a black box superimposed with the word \"CENSORED\", is taken by Stan, Kyle, and Kenny to Dr. Mephisto's lab. The Gingers arrive and take Muhammad and Cartman captive. The Super Best Friends are called to South Park to help; after their powers fail to subdue Mecha-Streisand, they pacify her by having Krishna adopt the form of Neil Diamond and providing her the opportunity to perform a duet with him.\n\nThe Gingers contact the celebrities and offer to share Muhammad in exchange for access to the celebrities' \"goo transfer machine\", which transfers Muhammad's power to remain free from ridicule to a target individual. Tom Cruise is the first subjected to the process, gaining a \"CENSORED\" box identical to Muhammad's, but further transfers are interrupted when the Super Best Friends arrive to free their comrade Muhammad. Meanwhile, Cartman is taken to the Ginger lair to meet Scott Tenorman, the Head Ginger. Depicted as a melodramatic madman, Scott has decorated his lair to represent the Chili Con-Carnival in which Cartman gained his revenge on Scott by tricking him into eating his own parents. He reveals to Cartman that they shared the same father, former Denver Broncos player Jack Tenorman, meaning that by his act of revenge against Scott, Cartman had killed his own father and fed him to his half-brother.\n\nThe fight between the Super Best Friends, celebrities, and Gingers spills over into the Ginger lair, and Tenorman escapes in the confusion. During the fight, Seaman leaps upon Cruise's back, leading Stan to observe, \"Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back.\" The \"CENSORED\" box over Cruise disappears, and all present continue to make jokes based on the fact that the words \"Seaman\" and \"semen\" sound the same. Cruise questions why they are able to do this, which leads to a monologue from Kyle, Jesus Christ, and Santa Claus explaining that the goo does not exist, and that threatening people with violence is the only true answer. In the censored version, this explanation is completely obscured by a continuous audio bleep.\n\nAs the town begins to rebuild following the Mecha-Streisand attack (\"for the 39th time\", according to Mayor McDaniels), Stan, Kyle, and Kenny find Cartman crying – not because he learned that he murdered his father, but because he is \"half-ginger\". Mitch Conner reminds Cartman that he is \"half-Bronco\" as well and tells him that makes him \"pretty cool\" and departs. The boys find Cruise crying for a place in which he can live without fear of mockery. Stan, Kenny and Kyle promise to help Cruise get to such a place. The episode's closing shot is of Cruise's corpse lying on the Moon's surface alongside the corpse of the orca featured in \"Free Willzyx\".\n\nWritten and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker, \"201\" was rated TV-MA L in the United States. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 21, 2010. The episode continued multiple storylines from the previous episode \"200\", the 200th entry of the series. Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone decided to celebrate their 200th episode by revisiting several subplots that had been featured throughout the show's 14 seasons. Multiple celebrities have been lampooned throughout the series' history, inspiring Parker and Stone to have all the past celebrities join in a class action lawsuit against the town of South Park. The ginger kids—children with fair skin, freckles and red hair—have been featured in several past episodes, where they were ridiculed by Cartman, who views them with prejudice. Cartman uses a hand-puppet con-artist named Mitch Conner who originally appeared in the seventh season episode \"Fat Butt and Pancake Head\", in which Cartman pretends his hand is Jennifer Lopez and uses many Hispanic stereotypes in his portrayal of her. Cartman regards Connor as a separate entity and has conversations with him, while Stan and Kyle do not accept this idea at all.\n\n\"201\" also included several characters and subplots that were not featured in \"200\", such as the return of Dr. Alphonse Mephisto and Kevin, characters that had not been featured on \"South Park\" for about 10 years. Other previously recurring characters made appearances in \"201\", including Mr. Hankey, Big Gay Al, Mr. Slave and Pip Pirrup. Scott Tenorman, and the references to Cartman's murder of Scott's parents, were from the fifth season episode \"Scott Tenorman Must Die\". At the end of \"201\", the dead body of Tom Cruise lies alongside the corpse of a killer whale, a reference to the ninth season episode \"Free Willzyx\", in which the South Park boys help an orca escape a marine amusement park and flee to the moon, believing it to be a paradise.\n\nOne of the most prominent storylines from \"200\", which continued into \"201\", was the characters' efforts to bring Muhammad into public view. This is based on two past controversies in 2005 (Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy) and 2007 (Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy), when European newspapers published cartoons of Muhammad, resulting in riots, global protests, and death threats toward the artists. As a result of those incidents, many publications and television studios have refused to broadcast images of Muhammad in any form, which was the inspiration behind Tom Cruise's efforts to harvest Muhammad's apparent immunity to satire and ridicule. Parker and Stone have previously voiced dissatisfaction that images of Muhammad had been censored on the show despite the fact that his image was shown during the 2001 episode \"Super Best Friends\", without any censorship, before the cartoon controversies began. \"201\" continues the theme from \"200\" that argues against fear and censorship, and calls for support of free speech, both of Muhammad's image and any subject considered taboo.\n\nIn the week between the broadcasts of \"200\" and \"201\", the website for the New York-based radical Muslim organization Revolution Muslim posted an entry that included a warning to creators Parker and Stone that they risked violent retribution for their depictions of Muhammad. The entry stated that they \"will probably wind up like Theo van Gogh for airing this show.\" Van Gogh was a filmmaker who was murdered by a man named Mohammed Bouyeri in 2004 for making a short documentary on violence against women in some Islamic societies. The posting provided the addresses to Comedy Central in New York and the production company in Los Angeles. The author of the post, Zachary Adam Chesser, said it was meant to serve as a warning to Parker and Stone, not a threat, and that providing the addresses was meant to give people the opportunity to protest.\n\nThe entry included audio clips of a sermon by al-Qaeda imam Anwar al-Awlaki calling for the assassination of anyone who has defamed Muhammad, saying, \"Harming Allah and his messenger is a reason to encourage Muslims to kill whoever does that.\" Subsequently, the website for the organization was hacked, temporarily redirecting web traffic to images of Prophet Muhammad with a bomb on his head and an older Muslim man kissing a young boy passionately.\n\nBefore \"201\" aired, the New York City Police Department increased security at the Comedy Central headquarters in direct response to the threats. Law enforcement officials said Revolution Muslim itself was \"all talk\" and had never engaged in any actual violence but they were concerned that the website post could inspire violence from others.\n\nDuring the original broadcast of \"201\" on April 21, 2010, all references to Muhammad's name were obscured by audio bleeps. Several other portions of dialogue were also censored, including almost the entirety of three consecutive monologues spoken by Kyle, Jesus and Santa Claus at the end regarding the moral of the episode. Muhammad's name appeared in the previous episode, \"200\", without any such censorship. Both episodes obscured all images of what was apparently Muhammad with a black \"CENSORED\" box. Immediately after the episode \"201\" aired, the series website \"South Park Studios\" posted a notice that said Comedy Central had inserted \"numerous additional bleeps throughout the episode\" after Parker and Stone submitted their final cut to the network. The network later confirmed they were responsible for the audio censorship.\n\nOn April 22, 2010, South Park Studios released a brief statement:\n\nSome of these developments had been anticipated in the 2006 \"South Park\" episodes \"Cartoon Wars Part I\" and \"Cartoon Wars Part II\". These episodes showed South Park's reaction to a controversy regarding censorship of Muhammad depictions on two (fictional) episodes of \"Family Guy\".\n\nIn the United States \"201\" has never re-aired following its original debut as \"South Park\" would usually repeat during the week, and episodes from earlier in the season were shown instead. Although \"South Park Studios\" generally makes unexpurgated versions of their episodes immediately available to view, the notice indicated Parker and Stone did not have network approval to show their original version, and thus no version of \"201\" could be seen on the website.\n\nThe Canadian Comedy Network aired \"201\" on April 25, 2010, though the episode was censored as the American broadcast was, breaking the network's multi-year practice of airing \"South Park\" completely uncensored. Neither \"200\" nor \"201\" were shown in the version of Comedy Central in the Netherlands, and neither episode is available on the Dutch \"South Park Studios\" website. The Swedish affiliate of Comedy Central also refused to broadcast \"200\" and \"201\" in Sweden, claiming:\n\nComedy Central has decided not to air these two episodes of \"South Park\". It is a decision we've made with great reluctance. Comedy Central believes strongly in creative freedom of expression; when unique and deeply insightful creative talents like those behind South Park are able to express themselves freely, we all benefit. However, the safety of our employees is our unquestioned number one priority, and therefore we have decided to take these precautionary measures.\n\n\"Super Best Friends\" was also pulled from the \"South Park Studios\" site following the increased media attention from \"201\". Episodes \"200\" and \"201\" are also unavailable on Hulu, the iTunes Store, and other streaming and download services.\n\nDuring Mitch Conner's flashback of the Vietnam War at the beginning of the episode, \"Time of the Season\" by English rock group the Zombies plays in the background. The scenes between Cartman and Scott Tenorman closely mirror a scene from the 1988 graphic novel \"\" where the Joker tortures and taunts Commissioner Gordon. Mecha-Streisand is defeated by her inability to resist performing duets with Neil Diamond, a pop singer-songwriter. During one scene, Mecha-Streisand crushes a building and someone screams, \"The Casa Bonita is gone!\" This is the name of a real-life restaurant that had been seen in the episode \"Casa Bonita\", and after which Parker and Stone's production facility was named.\n\nIn its original American broadcast on April 21, 2010, \"201\" was watched by 3.5 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, making it the most watched cable television show of the night. It outperformed the previous week's episode, \"200\", which was seen by 3.33 million viewers.\n\n\"The A.V. Club\" writer Sean O'Neal said \"201\" was an improvement over \"200\", but nevertheless felt \"201\" was \"less a cohesive episode than a grab bag of balls-out crazy scenes and cameos only loyal fans would really appreciate.\" However, he also said, \"it's sure to become one of, if not \"the\" most talked-about episode of \"South Park\" ever.\" Even after Comedy Central announced they were responsible for the censorship in \"201\", he speculated as to whether it was possibly a publicity stunt by Parker and Stone to create controversy and increase viewership. Ramsey Isler of \"IGN\" said the episode built on the events of \"200\" and delivered a strong payoff, particularly with the subplot about Cartman's father and the way it tied back to \"Scott Tenorman Must Die\". Isler said the bleeps added by Comedy Central provided some unintentional laughs and underscored the episode's underlying theme opposing censorship.\n\nAccording to a Zogby International survey conducted after \"201\" aired, a majority of Americans opposed Comedy Central's censorship of the episode. 71% disagreed with the network's decision to censor \"201\", with only 19% agreeing with the decision. 47% of those who disagreed with the censorship said they disagreed strongly, with only 5% who agreed claiming they felt strongly. Some commentators suggested because Comedy Central responded to Revolution Muslim's warnings by censoring depictions of Muhammad, the Muslim extremists scored a significant public victory.\n\nMichael Cavna of \"The Washington Post\" wrote, \"To invoke the revivified phrase: The terrorists win.\" \"Toronto Sun\" columnist Mike Strobel pointed out Revolution Muslim is a relatively small group of \"a half-dozen wannabe Osamas\", but said because of Comedy Central's response, \"The loonies and terrorists win one. No doubt, they'll try this stunt again.\" Likewise, Jean Marbella of \"The Baltimore Sun\" said, \"It's not even that the terrorists have won, it's that wannabe terrorists have won.\" Margaret Wente of \"The Globe and Mail\" said the censorship of \"201\" could be \"the lowest point in the history of American TV\", and that it represented a gravitation toward fear in a post-September 11 attacks world. \"Los Angeles Times\" columnist Patrick Goldstein said there were \"no easy answers\" and that he was not surprised Comedy Central took the threat seriously, but added, \"in a democracy, artists and political satirists should be allowed to say what they believe, even if it offends some of its audience\". Roger Catlin of the \"Hartford Courant\" suggested Comedy Central actually drew more attention to the Muhammad controversy, not less, by censoring the episode. UCLA School of Law Professor Eugene Volokh said Comedy Central's actions risk empowering other extremists:\n\nThe consequence of this position is that the thugs win and people have more incentive to be thugs. There are lots of people out there who would very much like to get certain kind of material removed, whether religious or political. The more they see others winning, the more they will be likely to do the same. Behavior that gets rewarded gets repeated.\n\nSeventeen Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonists protested the threats in a petition released April 27, 2010. Among the signatures were those of Garry Trudeau, Mark Fiore, Tony Auth, David Horsey and Paul Szep. The petition stated:\n\nWe, the undersigned, condemn the recent threats against the creators of South Park, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, by the extremist organization, Muslim Revolution. Freedom of expression is a universal right and we reject any group that seeks to silence people by violence or intimidation. In the United States we have a proud tradition of political satire and believe in the right to speak or draw freely without censorship.\n\nDuring the April 22 broadcast of Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show\", host Jon Stewart responded to the censorship of \"201\" with a ten-minute monologue about the death threats, expressing disgust toward Revolution Muslim, culminating with a song telling Revolution Muslim to \"go fuck [themselves]\". Stewart criticized Comedy Central's decision to alter the episode, while simultaneously acknowledging they likely did so to protect their employees from \"possible harmful repercussions\". Bill Maher, host of the HBO talk show \"Real Time with Bill Maher\", said the threats against \"201\" demonstrated the importance of the First Amendment and other American civil liberties, and said, \"When South Park got threatened last week by Islamists incensed at their depiction of Muhammad, it served—or should serve—as a reminder that our culture isn't just different than one that makes death threats to cartoonists. It's better.\" He added jokingly, \"If you don't get that, and you still want to kill someone over a stupid cartoon, please make it \"Garfield\".\"\n\nAs a result of Revolution Muslim's statement, Seattle cartoonist Molly Norris suggested that many people draw and publish pictures of Muhammad on May 20, 2010, which she dubbed the \"first annual Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\". However, very few cartoonists actually joined her in criticizing Islam or depicting the prophet Muhammed; instead, much like Maher and Stewart, they merely praised her for her efforts and condemned the idea of censorship. Norris herself went into hiding, shortly thereafter, on the advice of the FBI. Animated comedy series \"Family Guy\" creator Seth MacFarlane voiced this ambivalence on the part of the creative community, saying \"No one is a bigger critic of organized religion than I am\", but nevertheless added, \"It's tricky. You pick your battles. You have to judge how real the threat is against how funny the joke is. How much do I care about the joke?\" And \"The Simpsons\" also addressed the apparent hypocrisy of those who claimed to stand with \"South Park\" in a chalkboard gag during the opening sequence of the April 25, 2010 episode \"The Squirt and the Whale\", with Bart Simpson writing \"South Park—We'd Stand Beside You If We Weren't So Scared\".\n\nIn a 2016 oral history of \"South Park\" in \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Vernon Chatman, the voice of Towelie as well as a writer and producer on the show said that after Comedy Central censored the episode, series co-creator Trey Parker purchased a ticket to South Africa and showed it to the head of the network as a threat because Dave Chappelle had fled to Africa, though Parker never actually went.\n\nThe depiction of Buddha snorting cocaine in \"200\" and \"201\" prompted the government of Sri Lanka to ban the entire series outright.\n\nThe fourteenth season of \"South Park\" was released April 26, 2011 to DVD and Blu-ray, including the episode \"201\". When playing the episode, prior to the theme playing, a text card appears saying: \"The following episode appears as it originally aired on April 21, 2010. After it aired Matt Stone and Trey Parker released the following statement\" and then shows the original message that was released after the episode aired. Consequently, Muhammad, his name, and the speeches made by Kyle, Jesus, and Santa are still censored as in the broadcast version. Although the end speeches are still censored, the bleeps are accompanied with music on DVD, unlike the April 21, 2010 airing, which featured a raw audio bleep.\n\nIn the episode's audio commentary, Parker only comments on the opening scene, noting that they did the episode as intended and sent it in. He and Stone comment that they are not supposed to talk about it. For the next several moments, a large audio beep obscures the commentary before Stone says \"Yeah, that's pretty much it.\" During the commentary in both \"201\" and \"200\" Parker and Stone never mention Muhammad directly, referring to him only as \"the prophet of the Muslim faith\". Despite the package claiming otherwise, both \"200\" and \"201\" were omitted from the Region 4 release and have been completely omitted from the Region 2 (which contains the predominantly Islamic Middle East and North Africa) release as well.\n\nOn January 31, 2014, the original uncensored version of this episode was illegally leaked and distributed online without any approval of Comedy Central after a user on 4chan realized that the episode existed on the official website's web server and could be downloaded using rtmpdump.\n\nDespite having been leaked uncensored, \"201\" as well as \"Super Best Friends\" and \"200\" have still not aired in reruns and are still only legally available on DVD.\n\n"}

The duo cut a raw blend of drums, noise and organic visual work, featuring in their performances an eight-foot white sphere that hangs above Kazuhisa’s drum kit and which Dickinson maps videos on to; her work was described by William Barns-Graham of Fluid Radio as ‘cosmological and transcendental, drawing attention to the wonder of the earth and our sensuality on it’.\n\nTheir debut was at the International Festival of Projections in early 2016, and they have since performed at the End of the Road Festival, Supernormal Festival, Fort Process Festival, Zorofest in Leipzig, Splice Festival and other shows across the UK and Europe with Acid Mothers Temple and members of Wire and Bo Ningen.\n\nIn 2016, the pair completed a short film, \"Man on the Hill\", which features Kazuhisa playing drums on fire in the mountains. The film has since been featured on the British Council Film website. In 2016 the film was nominated for the BFI London Film Festival, the Encounters Short Film and Animation Festival, the BAFTA qualifying Aesthetica Short Film Festival, The London Experimental Film Festival, Vienna Independent Short Film Festival and the London Short Film Festival. The film was also featured in i-D Magazine Japan, naming Dickinson as one of the five most watched filmmakers in Japan at the time.\n\nAfter completing \"Man on the Hill,\" they went on to release their first music video \"Toy\", premiering on the Ransom Note in 2017 and following that appeared at various shows across the UK and Europe alongside the likes of Damo Suzuki (Can) and Immersion and Snapped Ankles, where their performance was described by Loud and Quiet as \"it looked like a planet, a marble, the inside of a brain, or was filled by trapped insects and humans. The effect was transfixing, and comes highly recommended.\"\n\nThey are featured as one of Cafe Oto's artists, accompanied by a review from Gavin Burrows of the blog Lucid Frenzy which reads \"The centre of the stage was taken up by projections which, always simple and often semi-abstract, never stole the limelight from the music. It was more like watching a trio, just one at work on different senses to the others. Pretty soon you weren't taking in the sights and sounds as separate elements at all, but hand been induced into a kind of synaesthesia.

{"id": "363869", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=363869", "title": "Alternative comedy", "text": "Alternative comedy\n\nAlternative comedy is a term coined in the 1980s for a style of comedy that makes a conscious break with the mainstream comedic style of an era. The phrase has had different connotations in different contexts: in the UK, it was used to describe content which was an \"alternative\" to the mainstream of live comedy, which often involved racist and sexist material. In other contexts, it is the nature of the form that is \"alternative\", avoiding reliance on a standardised structure of a sequence of jokes with punch lines. Patton Oswalt has defined it as \"comedy where the audience has no pre-set expectations about the crowd, and vice versa. In comedy clubs, there tends to be a certain vibe—alternative comedy explores different types of material.\"\n\nIn an interview with \"The A.V. Club\" after his performance in the 2011 comedy-drama film \"Young Adult\", Oswalt stated:\n\nI had come up out of that whole alternative scene, which was all about, \"Don’t try it, man. Just go up and wing it.\" I think a lot of that comes from insecurity. It's that fashion of improv and amateurism that comes from the insecurity of saying to the audience, \"Well, it doesn't matter if it doesn't go well, because I didn’t even try that hard to begin with.\" It's like, \"Oh, that's why you're not [trying]. If you actually tried hard and it sucked, then you've got to blame yourself.\" So that's what makes it hard for some people to sit down and actually just do the fucking work, because doing the work means you're making a commitment.\n\nThe official history of London's Comedy Store credits comedian and author Tony Allen with coining the term. However, in his autobiography, the late Malcolm Hardee claims to have coined the term in 1978.\n\nAlternative comedy came to describe an approach to stand-up comedy that was neither racist nor sexist but free-form and devised by the performers themselves. This style won out in a \"civil war\" against more traditional comedians who had, initially, also performed at London's Comedy Store, Dean Street, Soho, from its opening in May 1979. Traditional club comedians of the time often relied on jokes targeting women and minorities. The alternative comedy that developed from these clashes was more like comedy's answer to punk.\n\nAlexei Sayle, the Comedy Store's first MC, provided angry character comedy satirising the left. Fellow MC Tony Allen broke the taboos of personal and sexual politics, while Keith Allen confronted audiences in a fearless series of \"put-ons\" and was a big influence on the early cabaret scene that was about to emerge. As these newer comics grew in confidence, Tony Allen and Alexi Sayle founded \"Alternative Cabaret\", with other Comedy Store regulars. Their aim was to establish several alternative comedy clubs in London in addition to their flagship venue at the Elgin, Ladbroke Grove, from August 1979. Its core members were Jim Barclay, Andy De La Tour, and Pauline Melville, stand-ups who shared a background in radical fringe theatre. The pair also brought alternative stand-up to the Edinburgh Festival for the first time in August 1980 with \"Late Night Alternative\" at the Heriot-Watt Theatre. Returning with a full show in 1981, \"Alternative Cabaret\" was the critical comedy hit of that year.\n\nThe Comedy Store now advertised itself as \"The Home of Alternative Comedy\" in London's weekly Entertainment Guide, \"Time Out\", listing \"Alternative Cabaret\" as its main show. Their tours established the idea of running comedy shows in small venues around London, and sowed the seeds of the network of pub-based gigs that grew in the capital and across the UK throughout the 1980s. The new comedy got its own section, \"Cabaret\", in Listings magazines, first in \"City Limits\" followed by \"Time Out\" on 21 January 1983. Other organisations, comics, and entrepreneurs—including Maria Kempinska's Jongleurs and Roland and Clare Muldoon's CAST/New Variety—added more regular venues, bringing the number of gigs per week from 24 in 1983 to 69 by 1987.\n\nMeanwhile, another group of comics left the Comedy Store with Peter Richardson to form The Comic Strip and run their own \"Comedy Cabaret\" shows at the Boulevard Theatre, Walkers Court, Soho in October 1980. The Comic Strip, featuring double acts and sketch comedy, consisted of Manchester University and Royal Central School graduates Ade Edmondson, Rik Mayall, Nigel Planer, Dawn French, and Jennifer Saunders, who began to aim their talents at television. As \"The Comic Strip Presents\", the group made over 40 television films for both Channel 4 and BBC.\n\nBen Elton, who had by then become the Comedy Store's next MC, was invited by Rik Mayall to join him as co-writer of BBC2's TV hit sitcom \"The Young Ones\". However, it was as MC of Channel 4's new comedy show \"Saturday Live\" that Elton found fame in his own right. As author William Cook noted, \"After \"The Young Ones\" made him Alternative Comedy's hidden voice, \"Saturday Live\" (Channel 4) made him its most visible face.\"\n\nComic and broadcaster Arthur Smith observed that \"If Tony Allen, 'The Godfather of Alternative Comedy', was the theory of anarchic comedy, then Malcolm Hardee was its cock-eyed embodiment\". Hardee was the much loved MC at the Tunnel Palladium, The Mitre, Deptford 1984-89 whose audience were famous for their vocal participation and wit. There he influenced the early careers of Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer, Simon Day, Chris Lynam, Martin Soan, Harry Enfield, and many others to whom he gave their first gigs. He also found fame himself as part of The Greatest Show on Legs, which had been started by Martin Soan, his part in the legendary \"Naked Balloon Dance\" as well as his many shows and pranks at The Edinburgh Festival.\n\nJust about every major British stand-up comedian in the last thirty years started their career in alternative comedy clubs, including Ben Elton, Jo Brand, Jack Dee, Lee Evans, Eddie Izzard, Harry Hill, Peter Kay, Jimmy Carr, and Ross Noble.\n\nAlternative comedy has enjoyed a resurgence in the UK since about 2010, with Stewart Lee promoting the liberal, progressive values of the 1980's alternative comedy scene through his writing, live shows featuring veteran alternative comedians including Alexi Sayle and Norman Lovett, as well as a Comedy Central tv series showcasing a great variety of alternative acts called The Alternative Comedy Experience. Younger acts have banded together into groups dedicated to alternative comedy, including The Alternative Comedy Memorial Society and The Weirdos Collective.\n\nIn New York City, much of what is called alternative or \"downtown comedy\" is performed outside of traditional comedy clubs in theatres, such as Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre (UCB), Magnet Theater, The Creek and The Cave, and the Peoples Improv Theater (PIT), as well as cabarets that host comedy only occasionally. The comedians at these shows offer character-based humour or surreal humour, as opposed to observations of everyday life or more polemical themes. In addition, many alternative comics such as Demetri Martin and Slovin and Allen use unusual presentation styles, opting to play music, give Powerpoint presentations, or act out sketches. Many alternative comics such as Sarah Silverman, Janeane Garofalo, and Todd Barry also perform in mainstream comedy venues. The now-defunct Luna Lounge in New York's Lower East Side was home to a celebrated weekly alternative comedy stand-up series called \"Eating It\" from 1995 to 2005, co-created by Garofalo, which featured a changing line-up including Louis CK, Jim Norton, Ted Alexandro, Todd Barry, H. Jon Benjamin, Greg Giraldo, Patrice O'Neal, Patton Oswalt, Sarah Vowell, Mike Birbiglia, Marc Maron, Dave Chappelle, Roseanne Barr, Sarah Silverman, Janeane Garofalo, and numerous others, until the property was sold and the building razed.\n\nEugene Mirman started a show called Invite Them up at Rififi, a bar in New York’s East Village in 2002. The popular weekly show, co-hosted by Bobby Tisdale, never advertised or listed its performers. Comedians such as Demetri Martin, Aziz Ansari, Pete Holmes, Jon Glazer, Jon Daly, Reggie Watts and musicians such as Bright Eyes and Yo La Tengo all performed on Invite Them Up. The show spurred a host of other weekly events at Rififi hosted by Nick Kroll, Jon Mulaney, Greg Johnson, Larry Murphy and Jenny Slate. The venue was a hotbed of alternative comedy until complaints from neighbors about one of Rififi’s dance parties, Trash, got the bar closed down in 2008.\n\nWarren St. John said that the \"inspiration\" for alternative comedy in New York City is the Upright Citizens Brigade. The group originally formed at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in Chelsea in 1999. Four years later, in 2003, several performers at the UCB spun off their own theater, and formed the PIT. St. John also argues that one reason why unusual comics can succeed in New York City is that they don't have to tour part-time, as many of them also work as writers on local comedy television shows such as \"The Daily Show\" and the \"Late Show with David Letterman\".\n\nPatton Oswalt cited Dana Gould as the originator of the alternative comedy scene in the early nineties, who also cites Janeane Garofalo as another progenitor of the scene. Beth Lapides started the Un-Cabaret shows, which was the flagship of the alternative comedy movement. Other contemporaries of the scene included Bob Odenkirk, David Cross, Greg Behrendt, Andy Kindler, and Kathy Griffin.\n\nOswalt was essential in pioneering the alternative comedy on the West Coast. He created The Comedians of Comedy tour, which played across the US in independent music venues intermittently from 2004 to 2008. The original tour was hosted by Oswalt, and featured Maria Bamford, Zach Galifianakis, and Brian Posehn.\n\nCanada has a rich history of embracing alternative stand-up and sketch comedy. The ALTdot COMedy Lounge has been running for more than 20 years at The Rivoli, where \"oddball outsiders\" The Kids in the Hall also had a residency in the mid-1990s. Other notable alternative comedy shows now defunct included \"Pirate Video Cabaret\" (ended 2003), \"Laugh Sabbath\" and The Second City Theater Toronto's \"Sketchy at Best\". Other notable alt acts include Terry Clement, Sean Cullen, Jon Dore, Paul Irving, Chris Locke, Levi Macdougall, Ron Sparks and Harland Williams.\n\nWhile South African comedy often comprises racial or stereotype-based humour, alternative comedy in South Africa tends to avoid such subject matter. It is hard to define alternative comedy, but subject matter may include taboo, dark, non sequitur, geek, and various other topics, whilst excluding racial, scatological, stereotype, South Africanised humour and other topics considered mainstream. Although comedians of this genre may include mainstream topics, it does not form the majority of their sets.\n\nIt is hard to say exactly where it started, but The Underground in Melville Johannesburg was known for its risqué humour proliferated by founder John Vlismas. The Comedy Underground was fertile development ground for alternative humour with its anything goes policy. Since its closure in 2010, alternative comedy has found new venues including Foxwood theatre, Picollinos, and various others. Johannesburg remains the home of South African alternative.\n\nOne of the driving forces behind the increasing prominence of alternative comedy is the Johannesburg Comedy Cartel, whose members include Shaun Wewege, Warren Robertson, Vittorio Leonardi, and Alyn Adams. Other South African comedians who fall into the genre include Dale Amler, Roni Modimola, Mark Banks, and Vlismas.\n\nMel Miller is arguably considered one of the pioneers of the alternative genre in South Africa. During the Apartheid era, Miller's material was considered \"inappropriate\" or radical, resulting in more than one run-in and detention with the South African Bureau of State Security.\n\n"}

The current President and Acting CEO is Joseph Ianniello. Sumner Redstone, owner of National Amusements, controls CBS by way of his majority ownership of the company's Class A voting stock; he also serves as Chairman Emeritus.\n\nIt is currently the world's fifth largest entertainment company in terms of revenue after The Walt Disney Company, NBCUniversal, WarnerMedia (in which its owned by AT&T and its subsidiary Warner Bros. owns half of The CW, formerly The WB and UPN) and 21st Century Fox. The company began trading on the NYSE on January 3, 2006. Until then, the corporation was known as Viacom, and is the legal successor to said company. A new company, keeping the Viacom name, was spun off from CBS. CBS, not Viacom, retains control of over-the-air television (CBS, CW) and radio broadcasting, TV production and distribution, publishing, pay-cable, basic cable (Pop), and recording formerly owned by the larger company. CBS has its headquarters in the CBS Building (colloquially called \"Black Rock\"), Midtown, Manhattan, New York City, United States.\n\nViacom was created in 1971 as the television syndication division of CBS, and was spun off in 1971. However, in 1999, Viacom acquired its former parent, by this time also named CBS Corporation, formerly Westinghouse Electric. The prior CBS Corporation also owned CMT and The Nashville Network (now Paramount Network), which remained Viacom properties after the 2005 split, but the prior CBS did not own UPN, Showtime, Paramount Television, Paramount Parks, or Simon and Schuster.\n\nIn March 2005, Viacom announced plans of looking into splitting the company into two publicly traded companies, amid issues of the stock price stagnating (although it was alleged that another main force behind the split was the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, which led to MTV not being allowed to produce any more halftime shows, they had also produced the show for Super Bowl XXXV, the first Super Bowl CBS aired since regaining NFL rights and becoming MTV's corporate sibling).\n\nOn June 14, 2005, the Viacom Board of Directors approved the split of the company into two firms. The CBS Corporation name would be revived for one of the companies, to be headed by longtime television executive (and Viacom co-President) Leslie Moonves, and would include CBS, UPN, Infinity Broadcasting, Viacom Outdoor, Showtime Networks, and Paramount's television studio.\n\nThe split was structured such that the new Viacom was spun off from the old Viacom, which was renamed CBS Corporation. In a sense, this was a repeat of the 1971 spinoff. However, in this case, CBS retained virtually all of the prior firm's broadcast TV assets, including its various syndication companies.\n\nWith the split, the two new companies began trading on the NYSE on January 3, 2006. Investors anticipated Viacom benefiting from the split, but instead, it dropped approximately 20 percent, while CBS rose 9 percent.\n\nAnnounced in January 2006, CBS and DIC Entertainment signed a multi-year deal in which DIC bought the Saturday morning airtime as \"CBS's Saturday Morning Secret Slumber Party\". In June 2006, DiC added a production partner AOL's KOL. Thus, this block would be called \"KOL's Saturday Morning Secret Slumber Party on CBS\".\nOn January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation, and Warner Bros. announced that they were to create a new broadcast network, The CW Television Network. The network officially debuted on September 18, 2006. The network formally debuted on September 20 with the 2 hour premiere of America's Next Top Model. The network is the result of a merger of The WB (a Warner Bros. holding) and UPN (a CBS Corporation holding). CBS Corporation and Time Warner each own 50% of the network. Tribune Broadcasting (which previously owned a 25% stake on The WB) and CBS Corporation will contribute its stations as new network affiliates.\n\nThree days after the announcement of The CW, on January 27, CBS announced that it was selling its Paramount Parks division. On May 23, 2006, CBS Corporation sold Paramount Parks to the Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. With this acquisition, Cedar Fair became the third-largest theme park operator. On June 30, 2006, Cedar Fair announced that it has completed its acquisition of Paramount Parks from CBS Corporation in a cash transaction valued at US$1.24 billion. The transaction included a 10-year license that allowed Cedar Fair to use the Paramount name in the parks through the 2017 season.\n\nOn February 7, 2007, CBS announced it was selling seven stations in Providence, Rhode Island, Austin, Texas, Salt Lake City and West Palm Beach, Florida to Cerberus Capital Management for US$185 million. It sold another station, WFRV-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and its satellite station, WJMN-TV in Escanaba, Michigan, to Liberty Media on February 13, 2007. News reports estimate the deal at about US$234 million. CBS is swapping the stations and US$170 million in cash for 7.59 million shares of CBS common stock held by Liberty Media.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September 29, 2016, National Amusements sent a letter to the company and Viacom, encouraging the two companies to merge back into one company. On December 12, the deal was called off.\n\nOn January 12, 2018, CNBC reported that Viacom had re-entered talks to merge back into CBS Corporation, after Disney's proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets and the heavy competition from companies such as Netflix and Amazon. Shortly afterward, it was reported that the combined company could be a suitor for acquiring the film studio Lionsgate (which currently handles U.S distribution and global sales for CBS Films).\n\nOn March 30, 2018, CBS made an all-stock offer slightly below Viacom's market value, and insisting that its existing leadership, including long-time chairman and CEO Leslie Moonves, oversee the re-combined company. Viacom rejected the offer as being too low, requesting an increase by $2.8 billion, and requesting that Bob Bakish be maintained as president and COO under Moonves. It was reported these conflicts had resulted from Shari Redstone seeking more control over CBS and its leadership.\n\nEventually, on May 14, 2018, CBS Corporation sued its and Viacom's parent company National Amusements and accused Shari Redstone of abusing her voting power in it and forcing a merger that was not supported by it or Viacom. CBS also accused Redstone of discouraging Verizon Communications from acquiring it, which could have been beneficial to its shareholders.\n\nOn May 23, Leslie Moonves stated that he considered the Viacom channels to be an \"albatross,\" and while he favored more content for CBS All Access, he believed that there were better deals for CBS than the Viacom deal, such as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Lionsgate or Sony Pictures Entertainment. Moonves also considered Bakish a threat as he never wanted an ally of Shari Redstone as a board member of the combined company.\n\nOn September 9, 2018, following Moonves' resignation due to sexual harassment allegations, National Amusements agreed to defer any proposal of a CBS-Viacom merger for at least two years after the date of the settlement. In addition, the office of chairman will remain vacant until a new permanent CEO is appointed.\n, CBS Corporation ranked 197th on the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue.\n\nThe board of directors of CBS Corporation include:\n\nIn September 2018, CBS announced that it, together with former CEO Moonves, would be donating $20 million to #MeToo.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "64968", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64968", "title": "Cabbage Patch Kids", "text": "Cabbage Patch Kids\n\nCabbage Patch Kids are a line of soft sculptured toy doll like creatures sold by Xavier Roberts and registered in the United States copyright office in 1978. \n\nThe doll brand was one of the most popular toy fads of the 1980s and one of the longest-running doll franchises in the United States. The characters appeared in many other Cabbage Patch merchandising products ranging from animated cartoons to record albums to board games.\n\nAccording to Roberts, as a 21-year-old art student, he utilized the quilting skills he learned from his mother and the historic technique of \"needle molding\" to develop his own line of fabric sculptures. He called these hand-stitched, one-of-a-kind, soft fabric sculptures \"The Little People\". (Other soft sculpture dolls dating back to the 19th century were created using similar needle molding techniques.) His Little People were not offered for sale, but were \"adopted\" each with their own individual name and birth certificate. Instead of paying a purchase price, buyers of Little People would have to pay an adoption fee.\n\nThe Little People were first sold at arts and crafts shows, then later at Babyland General Hospital, an old medical clinic that Roberts and his friends-turned-employees converted into a toy store, in Cleveland, Georgia.\n\nAn early transaction at Babyland General Hospital worth noting is the sale of the only Little People quintuplets ever made at the facility. Bennie and Jeannie Shelton of Cumming, Georgia paid $5,000 to buy the one-of-a-kind set of five identical dolls. Also worth noting is one of Roberts' very first Little People dolls he ever created sold at an auction in Virginia in the early 1980s for $3,000.\n\nThe following is an abbreviated version of the origin story Roberts came up with for his Little People:\n\n<poem>Xavier Roberts was a ten-year-old boy who discovered the Cabbage Patch Kids by following a BunnyBee behind a waterfall into a magical Cabbage Patch, where he found the Cabbage Patch babies being born. To help them find good homes he built BabyLand General in Cleveland, Georgia where the Cabbage Patch Kids could live and play until they were adopted.\n\nBunnyBees are bee-like creatures with rabbit ears they use as wings. They pollinate cabbages with their magic crystals to make Cabbage Patch babies.\n\nColonel Casey is a large stork who oversees Babyland General Hospital. He's the narrator of the Cabbage Patch Kids' story.\n\nOtis Lee is the leader of the gang of Cabbage Patch Kids that befriended Xavier.</poem>\n\nThe name change to Cabbage Patch Kids was made in 1982 when Xavier's company, Original Appalachian Artworks, began to license a smaller version of the handmade creations to a toy manufacturer named Coleco which began mass production the same year. The Coleco Cabbage Patch Kids had large, round vinyl heads (originally of a different, hard plastic), and soft fabric bodies, and were produced from 1982 to 1989, many at a factory in Amsterdam, New York. The first two years production was all from the Far East, with nine head variations produced and computer-matched with bodies to ensure each doll was \"different\". It was, in fact, a marketing ploy that worked quite well as a wide range of variations resulted. (Source: Larry Moniz, then senior account supervisor for the Coleco account at Richard Weiner Public Relations in NYC.)\n\nAt the peak of their popularity, the dolls were a must-have toy for Christmas. Parents across the United States flocked to stores to try to obtain one of the Cabbage Patch Kids for their children, with fights occasionally erupting between parents over the hard-to-find dolls. In later years, Coleco introduced variants on the original Cabbage Patch Kids, and derivatives of the original line of dolls continued to be marketed.\n\nIn the 1980s when Coleco was producing the dolls for the North American market, the global craze was fulfilled by other companies:\nThe Dolls manufactured by each of these companies, and along with the factories that produced the dolls for North America, produced dolls that were slightly different from one another. Dolls that were made for consumers in other countries than the United States hold a higher value in the eye of some American collectors.\n\nHasbro took over the rights to produce Cabbage Patch dolls in 1988 after Coleco filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and continued to make the dolls with various gimmicks, including dolls that played kazoos. Some of the more popular doll lines to come out under the Cabbage Patch Kids name included the \"Birthday Kids\", \"Splash 'n' Tan Kids\", and \"Pretty Crimp and Curl\". Hasbro gradually began making the dolls for younger children, which led to smaller and smaller dolls. Although Cabbage Patch dolls were still best selling toys, Hasbro never really revitalized the Cabbage Patch market. In 1994, Mattel acquired the licensing rights to the dolls from Original Appalachian Artworks.\nIn 1994, Mattel took over the Cabbage Patch brand, including production. The first Mattel Cabbage Patch dolls hit the stores in 1995.\n\nThe Mattel Cabbage Patch dolls are not limited to cloth bodies and included dolls made from vinyl, which produced a more durable play doll. The Mattel dolls are mostly sized 14\" or smaller, and most variants were individualized with a gimmick to enhance their collectibility, e.g. some dolls played on water-toys, swam, ate food, or brushed their teeth.\n\nSome memorable Mattel lines include the updated Kids line of basic cloth dolls that came with birth certificates, the OlympiKids that were made to coincide with the 1996 Olympics, and the Cabbage Patch Fairies. Additionally, to celebrate the dolls' 15th anniversary, Mattel created a line of exclusively female dolls with a new molded fabric face, dressed in a custom outfits and packaged in collectible boxes. These were 16 inches tall, the same measurement of the first Coleco Cabbage Patch Kids.\n\nIn 2001, retailer Toys \"R\" Us took over the Cabbage Patch brand from Mattel, producing 20-inch Kids and 18-inch babies, both with cloth bodies and vinyl heads. They were packaged in cardboard cabbage leaf seats. In 2001, the 20-inch dolls debuted in the Times Square flagship store. These were created to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the line, and were available both online and in stores around the US.\n\nThe Toys \"R\" Us line lasted until Play Along toys obtained exclusive licensing rights to produce the Cabbage Patch Kids doll line. In 2003, Play Along launched a Cabbage Patch Kids 25th Anniversary collection using some of the original head sculpts from the very first Coleco editions. Play Along also partnered with Carvel Ice Cream in a co-branding campaign. The resulting co-branded Cabbage Patch Kids were packaged with a Carvel-branded ice cream cone.\n\nJAKKS Pacific acquired Play Along Toys and assumed the master toy licensee (c2011) for the Cabbage Patch Kids. Jakks introduced a 14-inch Cabbage Patch Kids Fashionality(TM) line and other Cabbage Patch Kid products. In 2013 Jakks Pacific released the Celebration edition to commemorate the 30th Birthday of the licensed Cabbage Patch Kids. \n\nWicked Cool Toys is now the current master toy licensee for the Cabbage Patch Kids.\n\nIn this line, WCT released new additions like Little Sprouts, a toyline of tiny collectable dolls, and Adoptimals, plush pets who interact with the Kids.\n\nThe original 1982 Cabbage Patch Kids license agreement with Coleco Industries was negotiated by Roger L. Schlaifer on behalf of Schlaifer Nance & Company, the exclusive worldwide licensing agent for Roberts' company at the time.\n\nFollowing Schlaifer Nance & Company's signing of Coleco Industries, SN&C signed over one hundred and fifty licenses for branded products ranging from the first children's licensed character diapers and low-sugar cereal to clothing, backyard pools, and thousands of other children's products — generating over $2 billion in retail sales for 1984, alone. Total sales during the Schlaifers' tenure exceeded $4.5 billion. While sales of the dolls and other licensed products declined precipitously in the late 1980s, the dolls have become a mainstay of the toy industry, and one of the few long-running doll brands in history.\n\nThese dolls were available by direct mail from the Danbury Mint. They have a rigid fabric body with porcelain legs, arms, and head.\n\nAn extension to the line was the \"Talking Cabbage Patch Kid\" introduced by Coleco, equipped with a voice chip, touch sensors, a microphone, short range 49 MHz AM transmitter and receiver for communicating with other such dolls. Touch sensors in the hands enabled the toy to detect when and how it was being played with in response to its vocalizations. For example, the doll might say \"hold my hand\" and give an appropriate speech response when the touch sensor in either hand detected pressure. It also had a movement detector to show the positioning of the doll and whether it was sensed to be on its belly, back, or even upside down. A special plastic 'drinking' cup containing a hidden magnet, which could be identified with the aid a small reed relay in the built into the head of the toy above the mouth, to signify when it should be seen to be 'drinking'. A more remarkable effect occurred when one doll detected the presence of another through its 49 MHz AM transmitter/receiver. The dolls were programmed to signal their \"awareness\" of each other with a short phrase, e.g. \"I think there's someone else to play with here!\", and then to initiate simple conversations \"between the dolls themselves\" with enough randomness to sound somewhat natural. The joint synchronised singing of 'rounds' being particularly impressive. The inclusion of the microphone was to delay the search and communication with another of its type when the ambient noise was above a certain level.\n\nBabyland General Hospital is the \"birthplace\" of Cabbage Patch Kids and is located in Cleveland, Georgia. Roberts converted an old clinic into a \"hospital\" from which to sell his dolls, originally called \"Little People\". The facility is presented as a birthing, nursery, and adoption center for the Cabbage Patch Kids. In accordance with the theme, employees dress and act the parts of the doctors and nurses caring for the dolls as if they are real. Babyland General moved to a new facility on the outskirts of Cleveland, Georgia in 2010 and has been voted one of the Travel Channel's top 10 toylands.\n\nThough Xavier Roberts is the creator of the Cabbage Patch Kids brand, many of the brand's defining characteristics, such as the dolls' overly round faces and that they came with an adoption certificate, can be traced back to Martha Nelson Thomas, an American folk artist from Kentucky. Before Roberts ever became involved in the toy industry, Thomas created and marketed her own line of dolls, called Doll Babies, which she sold at local arts and craft shows and markets. The two crossed paths at a state fair in 1976 and Roberts began purchasing her dolls to sell at a profit at his own store in Georgia. Thomas eventually confronted Roberts about his unethical business practices and ceased to sell additional dolls to him, prompting him to turn to a manufacturing company in Hong Kong to mass produce dolls similar in appearance to Thomas' at a cheaper cost to him. Thomas brought suit against Roberts and eventually settled with him out of court for an undisclosed amount in 1985. She and her husband, Tucker Thomas, told the press that she was more upset by the corruption of her dolls, for which she cared deeply, than the money she'd lost as the result of Roberts' actions. Thomas died in 2013, at the age of 62, with her most favorite dolls attending her funeral alongside her family members and friends.\n\nThen Xavier Roberts himself brought a $30 million lawsuit against Topps, the company that produced grotesque trading cards parodying his company's dolls called the Garbage Pail Kids, for copyright infringement. In 1987, in the midst of the legal proceedings, the makers of the Garbage Pail Kids announced their decision to cease parodying the Cabbage Patch Kids, to which Roberts commented to the press \"I could scream I'm so excited.\"\n\nOne line of Cabbage Patch Kids dolls, the Cabbage Patch Snacktime Kids, was designed to \"eat\" plastic snacks. The mechanism enabling this was a pair of one-way smooth metal rollers behind plastic lips. The snacks would exit the doll's back and \"magically\" appear into a backpack. The mechanism could be de-activated by releasing the backpack. They were extremely popular during Christmas 1996. The line was voluntarily withdrawn from the market following an agreement between Mattel and the Consumer Product Safety Commission in January 1997 following several incidents where children got their fingers or hair stuck in the dolls' mouths leading to safety warnings from Connecticut's consumer protection commissioner, Mark Shiffrin.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17095644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17095644", "title": "Eagle TV", "text": "Eagle TV\n\nEagle News, formerly known as Eagle TV ( \"Iigl Televiz\") is a television broadcaster in Mongolia. The station focuses on independent news, uncensored live audience feedback, and, formerly, Protestant Christian programming.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2002 Eagle Television was operated on terrestrial Channel 8 by Mongolian Broadcasting Company (MBC). MBC was a joint venture of the American nonprofit, AMONG Foundation, and Mongolia Media Corporation (MMC). Incumbent Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj-then well known Mongolian democracy leader and a Member of Parliament helped to create Mongolia's first independent TV station Eagle Television in 1994. In 2002, the American Tom Terry took over the management of MBC and Eagle TV.\n\nTerry moved to transform the TV station’s struggling news and Christian programming in keeping with his vision of political freedom and the advocacy of Christianity. This proved to be a magnet of controversy as the station was opened to uncensored live commentary from viewers and launched the nation’s first live international news coverage. Uncensored public commentary was a radical change in Mongolia’s media and political landscape. Newspaper articles and criticism from public officials on Mongolia’s State run television were countered by Eagle TV openly advocating increased freedom of speech and press through television, and it launched a strategy to increase public input into Eagle TV’s on-air operations.\n\nIn the early years, notable programming that aired on the channel included NBA playoffs with Mongolian commentary, The Flintstones (dubbed and renamed as \"The Flintstone People\") and CNN relays. This was attached to religious programming, both local and American. In 1997, it was expected that the Christian programming would be dropped by 2000.\n\nAt the same time, unbeknown to Eagle TV’s viewers, the shareholders were embroiled in long-standing and severe disagreements over issues of contribution and control of the newly dynamic TV station. One month after achieving its highest-ever ratings, the shareholders abruptly closed the station as a result of legal threats and corporate infighting. The government of Mongolia, controlled by the former communist party, reacted by revoking MBC’s broadcast license, preventing the station from re-launching its operations.\n\nAfter the station's closure, AMONG Foundation formed Eagle Broadcasting Company, appointing Tom Terry as Managing Director, and charging him with re-launching Eagle TV as a cable TV channel. About half a year later the new Eagle TV began broadcasting on SANSAR Cable as Mongolia’s first all-news cable channel.\n\nEagle TV launched a 24/7 news format with uncensored public commentary during live newscasts as a cornerstone of the station. In addition, it launched the nation’s first live coverage of in-country breaking news including the only all-day live coverage of Mongolia’s 2005 presidential election.\n\nIn light of the increasing popularity of Eagle TV’s cable operations, the former business partners AMONG and MMC negotiated their further cooperation over most of 2005. The talks resulted in an agreement in September 2005 for the Mongolian side to acquire the broadcast license for terrestrial Channel 8, and Eagle Broadcasting Company to have exclusive use of the channel for ten years, and exercising exclusive control over all television content during that period. Based upon the agreement the Mongolian government restored the license for Channel 8, paving the way for Eagle TV to return to its former channel.\n\nOn October 22, 2005, Eagle Television launched its Channel 8 broadcasts with live all-day coverage of U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld’s visit to Mongolia.\n\nOn April 1, 2011 Eagle TV was sold to Mongolia Media Corporation, a subsidiary of Bodi International. Terry resigned his position as company president and was appointed as Executive Director of AMONG Mongolia, a television production company in Ulaanbaatar producing Christian television programming airing on Eagle TV.\n\nOn February 3rd, 2014 Terry released, \"Like An Eagle,\" a biography of his nine years with Eagle Television. At this point, the station had become a full-on news channel (Eagle News) owned by Mongol Mass Media Group, also becoming a CNN partner. The channel had become entirely secular, having dropped their religious programming from the days as a station owned by the AMONG Foundation. The religious programming moved to sister channel Eagle Live, with AMONG only being involved in program production rather than channel ownership.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11665131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11665131", "title": "Edwardian musical comedy", "text": "Edwardian musical comedy\n\nEdwardian musical comedy was a form of British musical theatre that extended beyond the reign of King Edward VII in both direction, beginning in the early 1890s, when the Gilbert and Sullivan operas' dominance had ended, until the rise of the American musicals by Jerome Kern, Rodgers and Hart, George Gershwin and Cole Porter following the First World War.\n\nBetween \"In Town\" in 1892 and \"The Maid of the Mountains\", premiering in 1917, this new style of musical theatre became dominant on the musical stage in Britain and the rest of the English-speaking world. The popularity of \"In Town\" and \"A Gaiety Girl\" (1893), led to an astonishing number of hits over the next three decades, the most successful of which included \"The Shop Girl\" (1894), \"The Geisha\" (1896), \"Florodora\" (1899), \"A Chinese Honeymoon\" (1901), \"The Earl and the Girl\" (1903), \"The Arcadians\" (1909), \"Our Miss Gibbs\" (1909), \"The Quaker Girl\" (1910), \"Betty\" (1914), \"Chu Chin Chow\" (1916) and \"The Maid of the Mountains\" (1917).\n\nEdwardian musical comedy began in the last decade of the Victorian era and captured the optimism, energy and good humour of the new century and the Edwardian era, as well as providing comfort during the First World War. The Gaiety Theatre's well-loved but racy burlesques were coming to the end of their popularity, and so was the run of phenomenally successful family-friendly Gilbert and Sullivan operas. These two genres had dominated the musical stage since the 1870s. A few lighter, more romantic comic operas, beginning with \"Dorothy\" (1886) found success and showed that audiences wanted something lighter than operetta, but more coherent in construction than burlesque, that featured the modern fashions and culture of the day.\n\nThe father of the Edwardian musical was George 'The Guv'nor' Edwardes. He took over the Gaiety Theatre in the 1880s and, at first, improved the quality of the old Gaiety Theatre burlesques. Perceiving that their time had passed, he experimented with a modern-dress, family-friendly musical theatre style, with breezy, popular songs, snappy, romantic banter, and stylish spectacle. These drew on the traditions of Savoy opera and also used elements of burlesque and of Americans Harrigan and Hart. Their plots were simple, and they included elaborate displays of contemporary fashion and settings, and lighthearted parody of modern social convention and topical issues. He replaced the bawdy women of burlesque with his \"respectable\" corps of dancing, singing Gaiety Girls who wore the latest fashions, and also showed off their bodies in chorus lines and bathing attire, as well as singing, to complete the musical and visual fun. These shows were immediately widely copied at other London theatres and then in America.\nThe first Edwardian musical comedy was \"In Town\" in 1892. Its success, together with the even greater sensation of \"A Gaiety Girl\" in 1893, confirmed Edwardes on the path he was taking. These \"musical comedies\", as he called them, revolutionized the London stage and set the tone for the next three decades. According to musical theatre writer Andrew Lamb, \"The British Empire and America began to fall for the appeal of the [Edwardian] musical comedy from the time when \"A Gaiety Girl\" was taken on a world tour in 1894.\"\n\nEdwardes' early Gaiety hits included a series of light, romantic \"poor maiden loves aristocrat and wins him against all odds\" shows, usually with the word \"Girl\" in the title. After \"A Gaiety Girl\" came \"The Shop Girl\" (1894), \"The Circus Girl\" (1896) and \"A Runaway Girl\" (1898). The heroines were independent young women who often earned their own livings. The stories followed a familiar plot line – a chorus girl breaks into high society, a shop girl makes a good marriage. There was always a misunderstanding during act one and an engagement at the end. In the words of a contemporary review, Edwardes’ musicals were \"Light, bright and enjoyable.\" Later Gaiety Theatre \"girl\" musicals included \"The Orchid\" (1903), \"The Spring Chicken\" (1905), \"The Girls of Gottenberg\" (1907), \"Our Miss Gibbs\" (1909), \"The Sunshine Girl\" (1912) and \"The Girl on the Film\" (1913). Perhaps to balance the \"girl\" musicals, the Gaiety also presented a series of what could be described as \"boy\" musicals, such as \"The Messenger Boy\" (1900), \"The Toreador\" (1901), \"The New Aladdin\" (1906) and \"Theodore and Co. (1916)\". Edwardes expanded his empire to other theatres and presented slightly more complex comedy hits beginning with \"An Artist's Model\" (1895). \"The Geisha\" (1896) and \"San Toy\" (1899) each ran for more than two years and found great international success, capitalizing on the British craze for all things oriental. Other Edwardes hits included \"The Girl from Kays\" (1902), \"The Earl and the Girl\" (1903) and \"The Quaker Girl\" (1910).\n\nThe chief glories of Edwardian musical comedies lie in their musical scores. At their best, these combined the delicacy and sophistication of operetta with the robust tunefulness of the music hall. The major composers of the genre were Sidney Jones (\"The Geisha\"), Ivan Caryll (\"Our Miss Gibbs\"), Lionel Monckton (\"The Quaker Girl\"), Howard Talbot (\"A Chinese Honeymoon\"), Leslie Stuart (\"Florodora\") and Paul Rubens (\"Miss Hook of Holland\"). Scores were constantly refreshed with \"additional\" or \"specialty\" numbers and re-arranged, often by several different composers and lyricists, to keep audiences coming back. Important writers included Adrian Ross, Harry Greenbank, Percy Greenbank, Owen Hall, Charles H. Taylor and Oscar Asche. Generally, the book, lyrics and music were each written by different people, which was a first for the musical stage, although now this is the usual way of doing things. Adrian Ross wrote the lyrics for well over 50 Edwardian musicals.\nBesides Edwardes, American producer Charles Frohman and actor-managers like Seymour Hicks, Robert Evett and George Grossmith, Jr. were responsible for many of these shows. The musicals were frequently built around a resident company of artists, and the greatest stars of the era included actresses Marie Tempest, Gertie Millar, Lily Elsie, Ellaline Terriss and Phyllis Dare, leading men such as Hayden Coffin and Harry Grattan, and comics such as Rutland Barrington, George Grossmith, Jr., Huntley Wright and Edmund Payne. One critic wrote of Joseph Coyne that, like other stars of musical comedy, \"It is no good their pretending to be any one else. We go to see themselves, and all we ask is that the authors and others shall give them every chance of being themselves in the most pronounced and personal fashion\".\n\n\"The Arcadians\" is generally regarded as the masterpiece of the genre. The composers were Monckton and Talbot, both at the height of their powers. The story, about the havoc wreaked when truth-telling Arcadians arrive in corrupt London, neatly parallels the position of Edwardian musical comedies in theatrical history, with operetta-singing Arcadians, representing the past, meeting with music hall-singing Londoners, representing the future. This is an example of a common feature of shows of this period: sophistication with a common touch.\n\n\"Florodora\" (1899) by Leslie Stuart and Paul Rubens made a splash on both sides of the Atlantic, as did \"A Chinese Honeymoon\" (1901), by British lyricist George Dance and American-born composer Howard Talbot, which ran for a record setting 1,074 performances in London and 376 in New York. The story concerns couples who honeymoon in China and inadvertently break the kissing laws (shades of \"The Mikado\"). Later enormously popular hits included \"Chu Chin Chow\" (1916), which ran for 2,238 performances (more than twice as many as any previous musical), \"Theodore & Co\" (1916), \"The Boy\" (1917), \"Yes, Uncle! (1917)\" and \"The Maid of the Mountains\" (1917, the second longest-running Edwardian musical, with 1,352 performances). Audiences wanted light and uplifting entertainment during the war, and these shows delivered it.\n\nGeorge M. Cohan's sentimental \"Little Nellie Kelly\" (1922) was considered a late example of Edwardian musical comedy.\n\nMusic from Leslie Stuart and Owen Hall's \"Florodora\" (1899) \n\n\n"}

{"id": "42095885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42095885", "title": "Highbury Theatre", "text": "Highbury Theatre\n\nHighbury Theatre is a non-professional theatre situated in the Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, England. It is one of the oldest, established amateur theatres in the city and a founding member of the Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain.\n\nConceived in 1924 by Bertie English, the theatre originally started life as a simple play reading group, under the name, The Erdington ILP Play-reading Circle. As the members passion developed from just reading plays together, they began to start producing and acting in various productions. On 5 March 1925, they performed their first stage production of \"Little Sins and Pretty Sinners\" at the Folkhouse, Erdington. In 1928, a 17-year-old John English, took over from his father as the Director of the company. Rehearsals would often be held at his home which was named, \"Highbury\". Subsequently, in that same year, the group chose to rename themselves after their rehearsal space and became; The Highbury Players. Due to no theatre of their own, the company were still having to produce plays in local church halls until 1935. In hope more than expectation they set up a building fund and began to search for premises.\n\nHighbury Little Theatre officially opened on 22 May 1942 with George Bernard Shaw's \"Arms and the Man\" and has since then continually produced a season of plays for the last 7 decades. The theatre and its programme are constantly being revised and adjusted for a 21st Century theatregoing audience.\n\nIt was in 1946 that John English who, along with other theatre directors around the country, had the vision to form the Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain of which Highbury was a founder member, alongside The Crescent Theatre and The Questors Theatre with 6 other theatre companies. The early years of the twentieth century saw the beginning of the \"little theatre\" movement, whereby small, independent theatres ran on an unpaid basis providing theatre to their local areas. In January 1949, Highbury hosted its first Guild National Conference with an increased number of 14 member theatres. From the 9 original members, the LTG now have over 100 member theatres. English consequently went on to co-found The Midlands Arts Centre and the Arena Theatre Company along with his wife Mollie Randle.\n\nThe Theatre was fortunate enough to have amongst its Patrons the founder of The Birmingham Rep; Sir Barry Jackson, the actor Sir Cedric Hardwicke and MP Sir John Mellor, 2nd Baronet alongside fifteen other influential people in both the local and theatrical communities.\n\nDuring the 1980s major alterations and extensions took place. This was possible due to the acquisition of an old shop next door, which was incorporated into the theatre allowing the theatre to expand and add more facilities to a much better equipped theatre. During this period, the theatre's executive body also purchased land and houses that surrounded the theatre, as a result they could, and still remain able to, rent out the houses/apartments with the funds being used to support the theatre and allowing it to produce more challenging plays without the fear of making losses.\n\nIn 2008, the decision was made that the theatre change its name for the second time in its history, this time changing it to; Highbury Theatre Centre. This was primarily due to the fact that the theatre had been expanding over the years offering more than just theatre and offering more facilities to the community, essentially making it a community theatre. In 2018 as part of a marketing revamp, the theatre slightly edited its name once more, to the more to the point, Highbury Theatre.\n\nThe theatre's resident company remains, The Highbury Players who during the course of a 10-month season; put on 7 Main Stage productions and 3 Studio plays. The plays are chosen by an elected Arts Committee led by the Arts Director and aim to continue the Highbury tradition of having within every season; an English Classic, an International Classic and a play connecting the theatre with our own times, amongst both classic and contemporary plays. The theatre is one of two major amateur companies that operate in the Sutton Coldfield area, the other being Sutton Arts Theatre who have close ties with Highbury both historically and personally.\n\nAll plays staged at the theatre are reviewed by the online reviewers \"Behind the Arras\" who employ retired, professional theatre journalists to critique each production. Each year, plays and performances are nominated for the BFAME Awards. This is a ceremony held with all the nominated amateur theatres in the city and in which Highbury has either received a nomination in a certain category or won every year.\n\nIn September 2014 it was announced that Highbury would be working in partnership with Birmingham Town Hall and Symphony Hall (THSH) to support community arts as Birmingham City Council Arts Champions for the Sutton Coldfield District.\n\nThe theatre is a registered charity and is run entirely by a 160+ team of dedicated volunteers who are involved in many aspects from acting, directing, set design, costume, front of house amongst numerous other opportunities. The theatre welcomes newcomers allowing them to get involved in all areas, such as helping out as a costumer in their extensive wardrobe departments or by helping construct some of their award-winning sets.\n\nThe theatre is a valuable asset to the local and wider community; with various events and art exhibitions taking place there throughout the year. In late 2013, the theatre decided to resurrect one of the original theatre's features from 1943 to 1956, the Highbury Film Club. Working alongside the British Film Institute and the British Federation of Film Societies. The original club was known for showing Experimental films and arthouse films from around the world, which they have now reintroduced alongside classic films. The new, reinstated film club became a permanent fixture in 2014, now being included in all the theatre's future seasons.\n\nThe theatre is also home to Highbury Youth Theatre, which gives local children the chance to experience performing on stage, in front of a live audience, as well as developing their skills and confidence. Members are given the opportunity to work towards LAMDA examinations should they wish and have access to the National Association of Youth Theatres' workshops.\n\nThe theatre is one of very few amateur societies that has its own premises, doing so enables the theatre to be able to provide more amenities to both members and audiences. It has its own bar, coffee lounge, 3 large dressing rooms, communal green room, vast wardrobe departments, in house set building workshops, rehearsal rooms, props department, furniture store and much more. It is by having such facilities that the theatre and its equipment is available for hire by external companies who are without places to rehearse and stage their own productions.\n\nOn 29 April 2014, the theatre commemorated the 90th anniversary of the formation of The ILP Play reading circle, by having a special reading of two of the first plays ever performed by them back in 1924 when the company simply read the plays. The plays, by John Drinkwater, included; \"The Storm\" and \"X=0\". On 5 March 2015, the theatre celebrated the 90th anniversary of The Highbury Players first ever stage production. At the event, rare unseen film footage was shown of the original members building the first theatre.\n\nThe following people were Highbury Players and/or members;\n\n\n"}

He uses it to evaluate the traditional perception of rhetoric as persuasion. Burke suggests that whenever someone attempts to persuade someone else, identification occurs, because for persuasion to occur, one party must \"identify\" with another. That is, the one who becomes persuaded sees that one party is like another in some way. Burke's definition of identification works not only in relation to the self (e.g. that tree has arms and is like me, thus I identify with that tree) it also refers to exterior identification (e.g. that man eats beef patties like that group, thus he is identified with that beef-patty-eating group). One can perceive identification between objects that are not the self.\n\n\"A Rhetoric of Motives\" opens with an analysis of John Milton's \"Samson Agonistes\" and Matthew Arnold's \"Empedocles on Etna\"; from his analysis, Burke eventually extricates the term “identification.” From there, Burke uses the term to reclaim certain elements of rhetoric that have fallen away, while simultaneously expanding it to show how “identification” supplements traditional emphases on persuasion as central. The concept of identification, argues Burke, gives us an additional way of looking at rhetoric's role in human relations, specifically ways in which people enact social cohesion.\n\nIn particular, the concept of identification can expand our vision of the realm of rhetoric as more than solely agonistic. To be sure, that is the way we have traditionally situated it: “Rhetoric,” writes Burke, “is \"par excellence\" the region of the Scramble, of insult and injury, bickering, squabbling, malice and the lie, cloaked malice and the subsidized lie. . . . We begin with an anecdote of killing (in \"Samson Agonistes\" and “Empedocles on Etna”), because invective, eristic, polemic, and logomachy are so pronounced an aspect of rhetoric” (19-20). But while impelled to acknowledge this nature, we can look for more from rhetoric, he argues:\n\nWhat is identification? Burke spends most of the rest of Section I of \"A Rhetoric of Motives\" exploring the concept, at the same time hammering out the realm of rhetoric.\n\nIn identifying with the interests of another (or being persuaded that shared interests exist, even if they do not), one is “substantially one” with that other, or \"consubstantial.\" At the same time, each individual can retain unique substance. \"Substance,\" a recurring Burkean theme, was examined in terms of its “universal paradoxes” in \"Grammar of Motives\" and in its manifestations as unique constructed acts in \"Symbolic of Motives;\" here, in the \"Rhetoric,\" substance is examined in its implications of division. To “identify with” is to become consubstantial, but, at the same time, as the \"Rhetoric\" shows us, “to begin with ‘identification’ is, by the same token, though roundabout, to confront the implications of division” (22).\n\nIt is in this key discussion of identification, consubstantiality, and division that Burke lays out his crucial definition of the realm of rhetoric:\n\nIn metaphysics, “a thing is identified by its \"properties”\" (23), but a rhetorical identification by property refers to material, economic property. Identification by material property is ethical, Burke states, but it is also the source of turmoil and discord when identifications establishing themselves through property come into relation with one another. The importance of property and the simultaneous, overlapping cooperation and conflict it entails make property and identification a key rhetorical topic, Burke says: “Put identification and division ambiguously together, so that you cannot know for certain just where one ends and the other begins, and you have the characteristic invitation to rhetoric. . . . The wavering line between the two cannot be ‘scientifically’ identified; rival rhetoricians can draw it at different places, and their persuasiveness varies with the resources each has at hand” (25).\n\nIn this section, Burke also notes the way identification functions as a screen, placing the term again firmly within the realm of rhetoric. Using science as an example, Burke explains that “however ‘pure’ one’s motives may be actually, the impurities of identification lurking about the edges of such situations introduce a typical Rhetorical wrangle of the sort that can never be settled once and for all, but belongs in the field of moral controversy where men properly seek to ‘prove opposites’” (26).\n\nIdentification can also be seen as the way in which specialized activities occupy, rather than transcend or escape, larger contexts: “The fact that an activity is capable of reduction to intrinsic, autonomous principles does not argue that it is free from identification with other orders of motivation extrinsic to it. Such other orders are extrinsic to it, as considered from the standpoint of the specialized activity alone. However, they are not extrinsic to the field of moral action as such, considered from the standpoint of human activity in general. . . . ‘Identification is a word for the autonomous activity’s place in this wider context.” (27)\n\nIdentification in this particular aspect is thus yet another major path into, or topic of, rhetoric; for example, “we are clearly in the region of rhetoric when considering the identifications whereby a specialized activity makes one a participant in some social or economic class. ‘Belonging’ in this sense is rhetorical.” (28) Such identification can become sinister when unacknowledged or hidden. Moreover, consubstantiality implies that sinister morality can spread through both substances, as when the morality associated with a so-called autonomous activity serves as the morality for the larger context with which it is identified: “One’s morality as a specialist cannot be allowed to do duty for one’s morality as a citizen. Insofar as the two roles are at odds, a specialty at the service of sinister interests will itself become sinister.” (31)\n\nHere Burke suggests expanding the realm of rhetoric to include the ways in which we operate rhetorically upon ourselves, forging identifications through unexamined or nonconscious motives, self-protective or suicidal. “If a social or occupational class is not too exacting in the scrutiny of identifications that flatter its interests, its very life is a profitable malingering (profitable at least until its inaccuracies catch up with it) — and as such, it is open to attack or analysis, Rhetoric comprising both the \"use\" of persuasive resources \"(rhetorica utens,\" as with the philippics of Demosthenes) and the study of them \"(rhetorica docens,\" as with Aristotle’s treatise on the ‘art’ of Rhetoric)” (36). The key element here that brings in cunning is consciousness, or perhaps more to the point, purposeful unconsciousness, or hypocrisy: “This aspect of identification, whereby one can protect an interest merely by not using terms incisive enough to criticize it properly, often brings rhetoric to the edge of cunning” (36).\n\nDefinition of man\n"}

{"id": "26613599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26613599", "title": "Knights and Warriors", "text": "Knights and Warriors\n\nKnights and Warriors is an American competition television program created in 1992 by its executive producer, Jerry Gilden, and produced by what at the time was known as the Welk Entertainment Group. Originating at CBS/MTM Studio Center in Studio City, California, the series was similar to \"American Gladiators\" but with a medieval theme. The series matched a cast of amateur athletes against each other, as well as against the group of \"Warriors\". The show was hosted by Joe Fowler and Lisa Canning.\n\nBernard Erhard portrayed the Lord of Rules and Discipline (L.O.R.D.) who also acted as the show's resident referee. In the first season's original opening scene, he narrates the story as follows:\n\n\"It is written in the Book of Good and Evil that in a time long ago, all was peace and harmony, Paradise on Earth. Then one fateful day, the universe shifted, all was dark, and for those born on that day, their evil destiny was sealed! Now, they have united to wreak havoc on an unsuspecting world --- and forevermore will be known as WARRIORS!\"\n\nThis opening title sequence loosely resembles the legend of King Arthur and recalls how the world was a utopia until the day a dark force disrupted the balance that separated good from evil; and how, with that dark force, a barbarian horde known as the Warriors began to storm through the kingdoms. The L.O.R.D. has accordingly called for \"modern-day knights\" to battle the Warriors and restore honor.\n\nThe \"knights\" are two teams of one man and one woman. The teams are colored purple and gold. The knights must go through eight challenges set forth by the Warriors to win the game. The L.O.R.D. hands out punishment to the Warriors for any cheating, but he can also punish the knights if they cheat during competition, which was very rare in this show's all-too-short history.\n\nThe audience all wave and purple and gold triangular flags while cheering on the knights.\n\nThe Warriors are the show's antagonists. In reality, they're hired actors almost similar to the Gladiators.\n\n\nThe start and end of each event are marked by the sound of a gong and trumpet fanfare to begin the event, and only a gong sound to end the event.\n\nThe knights must catch red dodgeballs being launched by a catapult while trying to evade yellow dodgeballs being fired by the Warriors using giant slingshots. Once the red balls are caught, the knights must throw them into the ring of fire to score. Points are scored based on which section of the playing mat the knight threw the red ball from. In Season 1, the mat was divided into three sections worth 5, 10 and 15 points, with 15 being the furthest away. In Season 2, only the front two sections of the mat were used, with the middle section scoring 25 points, and the front section scoring 50 (as the knight would have to brave harder hits from the dodgeballs). After 60 seconds, the challenge is over. Both the male and female knights took a turn competing in this event.\n\nPyro was always the Warrior whose tricks would ignite the ring of fire to start the match.\n\nThe knight and Warrior run across treadmills on an elevated platform trying to knock each other down with foam bats. The challenge is 30 seconds. A win or a Warrior disqualification earns the knight 50 points while a draw is worth 25 points. Grabbing an opponent's weapon or crossing over the small barrier between the treadmills automatically disqualifies the offender. Only one gender competes in this event.\n\nThe knight has 45 seconds to run across a spinning track with two hurdles. Every completed lap on the wheel is worth 10 points each. However, a lap doesn't count if both of the knight's feet touch the inside of the wheel. The Warriors stand on the outside of the wheel swinging a 75-pound spiked ball on a chain to knock the knight off the wheel and out of the game. Whichever gender did not participate in Battle Swords competes in this event.\n\nTwo knights have 45 seconds (60 for the women) to climb up a giant 30-foot volcano-shaped net. Inside the net are 4 Warriors. One Warrior is strapped to a harness while the other three Warriors control the height and angle. The harnessed Warrior has pads to knock the knight down trying to prevent them from scoring. Scoring ranges from 3 sections of the net, each separated by a metal ring connected to the net. The bottom of the net is worth 25 points while the next section is worth 50 points and the top section is 75 points. If the knight manages to climb to the top of the Volcano and grab their team flag, he(she) will earn 100 points. Both genders compete in this event.\n\nEach knight have 45 seconds to skate around the jousting arena trying to dodge two Warriors trying to bring the knight down. The knight carries a foam lance which is used to capture rings on poles scattered around the arena. Red rings are worth 10 points while the gold rings are worth 25 points. For the first 15 seconds, the knight can take one of the paths forming an X inside the arena to escape the Warriors. Once inside the X area, the Warriors cannot enter or interfere. After 15 seconds, the Warrior-Free Zone is lifted and play resumes as normal. One gender competed in this event in Season 1, and both genders each took a turn in Season 2.\n\nThe knight and the Warrior are each standing on rotating platforms while each of them pulls on a rope. The knight has 30 seconds to pull the Warrior of their platform. If the knight wins, he or she earns 100 points. If 30 seconds expires or both go over, 50 points are awarded for a draw. Only one gender competes in this event. (In Season 1, the gender that did not participate in Roller Joust competed.)\n\nIn this challenge, the knights are pitted against each other inside a bowl-like arena. The Warriors outside the bowl rock it back and forth with the knights inside it. The object in this game is for one knight to pin the other using a pad. Depending on where the pin was, the bowl has 4 scoring sections: two 25 points, one 50 point and one 75 point section. After 45 seconds, the total number of points are added up. Pins without using the pads won't count. Both genders took a turn competing in this event.\n\nA notable moment in the show's early round one episodes occurred when Knight Robert Pavell of the purple suffered a head injury while inside the Pit; he and his opponent, Michael West of the gold team, scored no points in the Pit. He was replaced by Jeff Joccum, who later went on to score in the finale and ensure a win of the purple team.\n\nSimilar to the \"American Gladiators\" final event, the Eliminator, Target Onslaught is the show's final event. Target Onslaught is a two-part challenge.\n\nOne knight becomes the shooter, aiming a crossbow-like cannon and firing foam arrows at six targets from afar as the other knight loads the crossbow. The targets include a dragon, spinning flags, the Sun, the Moon, and two shields. The first knight has 30 seconds to shoot the targets. The first knight cannot move to the next target until the last one is shot down. Instead of points, the knight earns 5 additional seconds for his/her partner for every successful hit.\n\nAfter 30 seconds expires, the second half of Target Onslaught begins. The second knight now becomes the shooter and the first knight loads the crossbow as they attempt to shoot the Warriors which travel back and forth across the top of the arena on three rails using handrail slides. The closest rail is 50 points, the next rail is 100 points and the furthest rail is 150 points. After 30–60 seconds, the final scores are totaled.\n\nThe team with the most points at the end of the show wins and receive medals awarded to them by the L.O.R.D. and the servant girls beside him. Prizes are also awarded to the knights, indicated by hostess Lisa Canning as the show comes back from various commercial breaks.\n\nIn a \"Knights and Warriors Tournament\", which was ultimately the series finale, the champions of the Tournament are crowned \"Sir\" and \"Madam\" by the Lord of Rules and Discipline, and receive gold trophies awarded by the show.\n"}

They are common throughout northern Europe, particularly Scotland, Wales, Iceland (where they are referred to as \"steintökin\"), Scandinavia and North West England in the area that was once inhabited by the Welsh, now modern day Cumbria. Some of the stones are so heavy that there has been no authenticated lift in modern times, only legend.\n\nRecently, lifting stones have been incorporated into the World's Strongest Man competitions, using various cast, found, or established challenge stones such as the Husefell Stone. They also do a stylized version of an event derived from an ancient contest, in which men would see who could load the heaviest stone onto a stone wall, derived from building such a wall, where they are known as Atlas Stones.\n\nIn Iceland, lifting stones were categorised into the \nThey were traditionally used to qualify men for work on fishing boats, with the \"hálfsterkur\" being the minimum weight a man would have to lift onto a ledge at hip-height to qualify. One such set of stones can be found on the beach of Djúpalónssandur at the foot of Snæfellsjökull. One of the most famous Icelandic stones is the Husafell Stone which weighs 190 kg (418 lb).\n\nEvery settlement in the Faroe Islands used to have its local lifting stone, called a \"hav\", \nderived from the verb \"hevja\" which means 'to lift'. Visiting men would be challenged by the locals to show off their strength.\n\nClach cuid fir, Gaelic for \"manhood stones\", originate from Scotland. Manhood stones were used for centuries as tests of strength in Scotland. Typically, a young man was welcomed into manhood when he was able to lift his clan's testing stone to waist height. There are many examples in Scotland including:\nBoth the McGlashen Stones and the Dinnie Stones have been used in numerous Strongman competitions since the 1980s including World's Strongest Man and Pure Strength.\n\nA Clach-ultaich (; plural ) is another type of lifting stone found in Scotland. Examples are:\n\nNear Auldgirth in Dumfries and Galloway is a small farm named \"Liftingstane\" where a large stone with a iron handle once stood that was used as a test of strength.\n\nAt Old Dailly in South Ayrshire are the 'Blue or Charter Stones' that were used for trials of strength to the extent that the local council has bound them with metal bands to prevent their continued use.\n\nThe 'Leper's Charter Stone' at Kingcase in Prestwick, South Ayrshire was made of black basalt and kidney shaped, used as a lifting stane until it was broken although the parts remain, built into the walls of the old chapel.\n\nAccording to Y pedair Camp ar Hugainyn Welsh for \"24 feats of a welshman\", stone lifting was a common practice. Usually performed by young boys as a rite of passage into manhood. It is said that once a young boy can lift the stone to his waist he was considered a man. Furthermore, the stone was used to develop a man's strength in preparation for battle.\n\nThere was no set size, shape or weight for each stone. Stones varied, depending on what was available within the locality or by what was selected by the king of each region.\n\nThe king's \"Teulu\" (\"personal army\") were selected from each village or town within his borders, based upon a man's ability to lift stones, run, jump, leap, wrestle, fence, shoot a bow and arrow and throw a spear.\n\nTo date, a lifting stone \"Y Garreg Orchest\" is still in place in the town of Criccieth in Gwynedd, North Wales. Competitors travel from all across the UK to attempt to lift this mammoth stone. In 2015 there was one successful lift of the 28 stone Goliath.\n\nStone lifting is also a traditional Basque Country sport involving the lifting of stones, called \"harri jasotzea\". There are several varieties, particularly using round stones and rectangular ones. The goal can be raising and dropping a stone of certain weight as many times as possible or simply raising a heavy stone once in order to beat an existing record.\n\nThe \"stone carry\" or \"stone walk\" is a traditional Scottish and Icelandic athletic event involving the carrying of large stones down the field of competition. This type of event has become very popular in the sport of Strongman, with many variations being used in numerous competitions all over the world.\n\nThe rules are simple: the competitors each pick up a pair of very heavy stones equipped with iron handles, and carry the paired stones as far down the field as they can. The length of the field varies depending on the site, but a hundred feet is typical. This event is also known as the farmer's walk.\n\nIf two or more competitors carry the stones the entire length of the field, heavier stones are then used. At the New Hampshire Highland Games, the record carry () is a pair of stones weighing 508 pounds (230 kg) carried just under 100 feet (30 m).\n\nThe game probably originated as an outgrowth of the need to clear stones from agricultural fields to create clearance cairns.\n\nA similar Basque sport is the \"ontzi eramatea\", where the weights were originally milk canisters.\n\n"}

Brian became obsessed with becoming a super-hero, so he could find and take down her muggers.\n\nBrian was met by the Dwarf, an agent of the demon Chthon, who offered him the power to be like his idol Spider-Man via a page of the Darkhold.

Ai Apaec was shown to have been shrunken down when he is a prisoner in Iron Man's lab. When Hank Pym mentions having regrown U.S. Agent's limbs and shrunk Ai Apaec, Iron Man lashes out at him and realizes that Henry Pym's control implant had been reworked. The Dark Avengers make their way through Hell's Kitchen to get to Strangetown. They come across a building covered with webs as Ai Apaec claims that this world's Spider-Man had gone under a profound change to have created a long-lasting web. During the fight between the Dark Avengers and Spider-Man's gang, Ai Apaec tells Barney to load him onto an arrow and fire it at Spider-Man. Spider-Man's Spider-Senses go off and he catches the arrow as Ai Apaec and Spider-Man speak in a different language while the other Dark Avengers have been subdued. With help from Ai Apaec, June Covington tells them that they had poisoned Hawkeye on his left side and that the venom must be sucked out. Later on, the Dark Avengers and Spider-Man's gang arrive in Strangetown where they are attacked by the All-Seeing Eye and the Soulsnake. Ai Apaec tells Spider-Man to cast some webbing and give Barney Barton a sword which he uses to destroy the Soulsnake while Spider-Man lands a hard kick to the All-Seeing Eye. Ai Apaec is climbing on Doctor Strange's leg, telepathically calling the Dark Avengers to summon an object contained by Spider-Man's webs which would grant him the perfect distraction. Enraged at the death of Clea, Doctor Strange readies an even more powerful spell. Before he can do the spell, Ai Apaec hits him with all the poison he had killing Doctor Strange and ending his slave spell on Moonstone and Skaar. Ai Apaec and the Dark Avengers later return to their reality. When Ai Apaec reminds the Dark Avengers that he must be restored to his proper size, June Covington steps on him.\n\nAi Apaec has superhuman strength where it was stated that he was strong enough to rip off a man's head. His long sharp teeth contains a powerful poison and he has enhanced senses. His spider legs can enable him to cling to solid walls and surfaces. Like the diving bell spider, Ai Apaec can wrap himself in a bell-shaped web held by the hair on his legs and abdomen and collect oxygen from the water to exchange the carbon dioxide with the oxygen.\n\nDuring the \"Spider-Verse\" storyline, the Earth-1771 version of Ai Apaec is attacked by Karn. After a short battle, Karn drains away Apaec's essence reducing him to dust.\n\n\n\nAfter he was brought into the main universe, he kept fighting as Spider-Man.\n\n\n\nOutside of the Earth 616 universe there exists many versions of Spider-Man.\n"}

Her parents were physician William R. and Mary Manning. May had two sisters, Elmira and Elizabeth Manning and a younger brother, William B. Manning. May also had three half brothers, Samuel, Edward and Albert Eager. May met Gordon William Lillie who became famous as Pawnee Bill, while attending Smith College in 1886, they married at her parent's home in Philadelphia later that year.\n\nGordon Lillie's wedding gift to his bride was a pony and a Marlin .22 target rifle. In 1887 May debuted at a sharpshooter for \"Pawnee Bill's Great Wild West Show\" and was billed as 'the greatest Lady Horseback Rifle-shot of the World'. May traveled the country with her husband's show and was one of the first women to perform as an equestrian and shooter in American Wild West Shows. May suffered a shooting injury during an act in 1899 that required two of her fingers to be amputated. While on tour in 1907, May gave a speech to women in Chicago, she said: \"Let any normally healthy woman who is ordinarily strong screw up her courage and tackle a bucking bronco, and she will find the most fascinating pastime in the field of feminine athletic endeavor. There is nothing to compare, to increase the joy of living, and once accomplished, she’ll have more real fun than any pink tea or theater party or ballroom ever yielded.\"\n\nEventually May and Gordon settled in Pawnee, Oklahoma on Blue Hawk Peak. They built a cabin, established a buffalo herd, and, in 1910, and completed work on their Arts and Crafts style home. In 1917, May and Gordon adopted a son whom they named Billy. He died in an accident at the ranch in 1925. While her husband was on tour, May was the hands-on manager of the Lillie buffalo ranch. She believed in the buffalo’s importance to the heritage of the American West and to Plains Indian culture. May was active in the Woman's Relief Corps and was a member of the Eastern Star. She starred in \"May Lillie, Queen of the Buffalo Ranch,\" a film produced at the ranch. In 1936 she and her husband celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary in Taos, New Mexico.

Mind rhyme may be achieved either by stopping short, or by replacing the expected word with another (which may have the same rhyme or not). Teasing rhyme is the use of mind rhyme as a form of innuendo, where the unsaid word is taboo or completes a sentence indelicately. \n\nAn example, in the context of cheerleading:\nMind rhyme is often a form of word play. The implied rhyme is inferable only from the context. This contrasts with rhyming slang from which the rhyming portion has been clipped, which is part of the lexicon. (An example is \"dogs\", meaning \"feet\", a clipping of rhyming \"dog's meat\".) \n\nA traditional example is the song \"Sweet Violets\" :\n\nThere once was a farmer who took a young miss\nIn back of the barn where he gave her a lecture\nOn horses and chickens and eggs\nAnd told her that she had such beautiful\nManners that suited a girl of her charms\nA girl that he wanted to take in his\nWashing and ironing and then if she did\nThey could get married and raise lots of\nSweet violets\nSweeter than the roses\nCovered all over from head to toe\nCovered all over with sweet violets\nThe girl told the farmer that he'd better stop\nAnd she call her father and he called a\nTaxi and got there before very long\n'Cause some one was doin' his little girl\nRight for a change and so that's why he said\nIf you marry her son, you're better off single\n'Cause it's always been my belief\nMarriage will bring a man nothing but\nSweet Violets\nSweeter than the roses\nCovered all over from head to toe\nCovered all over with sweet violets\nThe farmer decided he wed anyway\nAnd started in planning for his wedding\nSuit which he purchased for only one buck\nBut then he found out he was just out of\nMoney and so he got left in the lurch\nA standin' and waitin' in front of the\nEnd of the story which just goes to show\nAll a girl wants from a man is his\nSweet Violets\nSweeter than the roses\nCovered all over from head to toe\nCovered all over with sweet violets\nSweet Violets﻿\n\nAlan Bold described the 20th century anonymous bawdy poem about the \"young man of Brighton Pier\" as \"perhaps the finest of the teasing-rhyme variety of bawdy poem\". An extract will illustrate the technique:\n\n\"Something You Can Do with Your Finger\" from \"South Park\" uses enjambment to replace taboo words with non-taboo phrases with the same initial syllable. For example \"shit>shih-tzu\" and \"meat>meeting\", in the following fragment, each start a new sentence instead of finishing the old one: \n\nSimilarly, the childhood rhyme Miss Suzie ends each section with what sounds like a taboo word, only to continue with a more innocent word.\n\nAnother example is the 1985 Bowser & Blue song \"Polka-Dot Undies\", which begins:\n\nTeasing rhymes have been popular since the 17th century. Though fairly rare in canonical literature, examples of mind rhyme can be found in the work of William Shakespeare, Emily Dickinson, Marianne Moore and others. In Lewis Carroll's \"'Tis the Voice of the Lobster\" it is generally assumed that the last words of the interrupted poem could be supplied by the reader as \"— eating the Owl\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11285403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11285403", "title": "Monodrama", "text": "Monodrama\n\nA monodrama is a theatrical or operatic piece played by a single actor or singer, usually portraying one character.\n\nIn opera, a monodrama was originally a melodrama with one role such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau's \"Pygmalion\", which was written in 1762 and first staged in Lyon in 1770, and Georg Benda's work of the same name (1779). \n\nThe term monodrama (sometimes mono-opera) is also applied to modern works with a single soloist, such as Arnold Schoenberg's \"Die glückliche Hand\" (1924), which besides the protagonist has two additional silent roles as well as a choral prologue and epilogue. \"Erwartung\" (1909) and \"La voix humaine\" (1959) closely follow the traditional definition, while in \"Eight Songs for a Mad King\" (1969) by Peter Maxwell Davies, the instrumentalists are brought to the stage to participate in the action. Twenty-first century examples can be found in \"Émilie\" (2008) by Kaija Saariaho and \"Four Sad Seasons Over Madrid\" (2008) or \"God's Sketches\" (2011) both of them by Jorge Grundman.\n\nIn England the first example of monodrama was on a mythological theme, in this case Frank Sayers' \"Pandora\" (1790), in the form of a recitation with off-stage voices. Robert Southey took up the new form, producing eleven pieces so titled between 1793-1804; so did Matthew Lewis in his publicly performed and highly melodramatic \"The Captive\". Few others actually appeared on stage and monodrama soon lost its connection with music. The term \"dramatic monologue\" came to be applied to such works, although the term \"monodrama\"\nremained in critical currency. Half a century later Tennyson himself referred to his \"Maud\" (1855) as a monodrama, and William Lancaster (John Warren, 3rd Baron de Tabley) published a verse collection titled \"Eclogues and Monodramas\" in 1864.\n\nNevertheless, Nurul Momen (\"Nemesis\", 1944), Samuel Beckett (\"Krapp's Last Tape\", 1958) and Anton Chekhov (\"On the Harmful Effects of Tobacco\", 1886, 1902), among others, have written monodramas in this sense. Patrick Süskind has one person speak to the audience in \"Der Kontrabaß\" (1981). A more recent example is \"A Night in November\" (1994) by Irish playwright Marie Jones.\n\nAs developed by Russian symbolist Nikolai Evreinov (1879–1953) and encapsulated in his book \"The Theatre in Life\" (1927), it is a dramatic representation of what passes in an individual mind. Everything one witnesses on stage is portrayed from the mental state of the given protagonist.\n\nThe largest solo theatre festival in the world, United Solo takes place annually in New York City at Theatre Row. In 2013 it featured over 120 productions. In Kiel, Germany, an international theatre festival for monodramas takes place regularly, the Thespis International Monodrama Festival.\n\n"}
{"id": "5010353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5010353", "title": "Motion graphics", "text": "Motion graphics\n\nMotion graphics are pieces of digital footage or animation which create the illusion of motion or rotation, and are usually combined with audio for use in multimedia projects. Motion graphics are usually displayed via electronic media technology, but may also be displayed via manual powered technology (e.g. thaumatrope, phenakistoscope, stroboscope, zoetrope, praxinoscope, flip book). The term distinguishes still graphics from those with a transforming appearance over time, without over-specifying the form. While any form of experimental or abstract animation can be called motion graphics, the term typically more explicitly refers to the commercial application of animation and effects to video, film, TV, and interactive applications.\n\nMotion graphics extend beyond the most commonly used methods of frame-by-frame footage and animation. Motion graphics can be distinguished from typical animation in that they are not strictly character driven or story based and often represent animated abstract shapes and forms such as logos or logo elements.\n\nSince there is no universally accepted definition of motion graphics, the official beginning of the art form is disputed. There have been presentations that could be classified as motion graphics as early as the 1800s. Michael Betancourt wrote the first in depth historical survey of the field, arguing for its foundations in visual music and the historical abstract films of the 1920s by Walther Ruttmann, Hans Richter, Viking Eggeling and Oskar Fischinger.\n\nThe history of motion graphics is closely related to the history of Computer Graphics as the new developments of computer generated graphics led to a wider use of motion design not based on optical film animation. The term motion graphics originated with digital video editing in computing, perhaps to keep pace with newer technology. Graphics for television were originally referred to as Broadcast Design.\n\nOne of the first uses of the term \"motion graphics\" was by animator John Whitney, who in 1960 founded a company called Motion Graphics Inc.\n\nSaul Bass is a major pioneer in the development of feature film title sequences. His work included title sequences for popular films such as \"The Man with the Golden Arm\" (1955), \"Vertigo\" (1958), \"Anatomy of a Murder\" (1959), \"North by Northwest\" (1959), \"Psycho\" (1960), and \"Advise & Consent\" (1962). His designs were simple, but effectively communicated the mood of the film.\n\nBefore computers were widely available, motion graphics were costly and time-consuming, limiting their use to high-budget filmmaking and television production. Computers began to be used as early as the late 1960s as super computers were capable of rendering crude graphics. John Whitney and Charles Csuri can be considered early pioneers of computer aided animation.\nIn the late 1980s to mid-1990s, expensive proprietary graphics systems such as those from British-based Quantel were quite commonplace in many television stations. Quantel workstations such as the Hal, Henry, Harry, Mirage and Paintbox were the broadcast graphics standard of the time. Many other real time graphics systems were used such as Ampex ADO, Abekas and K-Scope for live Digital video effects. Early proprietary 3D computer systems were also developed specifically for broadcast design such as the Bosch FGS-4000 which was used in the music video for Dire Straits Money for Nothing (song). The advent of more powerful desktop computers running Photoshop in the mid-90s drastically lowered the costs for producing digital graphics. With the reduced cost of producing motion graphics on a computer, the discipline has seen more widespread use. With the availability of desktop programs such as Adobe After Effects, Discreet Combustion, and Apple Motion, motion graphics have become increasingly accessible. Modern character generators (CG) from Aston Broadcast Systems and Chyron Corporation's incorporate motion graphics.\n\nThe term \"motion graphics\" was popularized by Trish and Chris Meyer's book about the use of Adobe After Effects, titled \"Creating Motion Graphics\". This was the beginning of desktop applications which specialized in video production, but were not editing or 3D programs. These new programs collected together special effects, compositing, and color correction toolsets, and primarily came between edit and 3D in the production process. This \"in-between\" notion of motion graphics and the resulting style of animation is why sometimes it is referred to as 2.5D.\n\nMotion graphics continue to evolve as an art form with the incorporation of sweeping camera paths and 3D elements. Maxon's CINEMA 4D, plugins such as MoGraph and Adobe After Effects. Despite their relative complexity, Autodesk's Maya and 3D Studio Max are widely used for the animation and design of motion graphics, as is Maya and 3D Studio which uses a node-based particle system generator similar to Cinema 4D's Thinking Particles plugin. There are also some other packages in Open Source panorama, which are gaining more features and adepts in order to use in a motion graphics workflow, while Blender integrates several of the functions of its commercial counterparts.\n\nMany motion graphics animators learn several 3D graphics packages for use according to each program's strengths. Although many trends in motion graphics tend to be based on a specific software's capabilities, the software is only a tool the broadcast designer uses while bringing the vision to life.\n\nLeaning heavily from techniques such as the collage or the pastiche, motion graphics has begun to integrate many traditional animation techniques as well, including stop-motion animation, cel animation or a combination of both.\n\nOne of the most popular motion graphics tools is a particle system: a motion graphics technology that is used for generating multiple animated elements. This type of animation is commonly referred to as procedural animation. A particle system is available as a plug-in, as a stand-alone application, or is included as an integrated part of a motion graphics package. Particles are points in 3-D or 2-D space that can be represented by a wide variety of station and animated objects such as a ball of light, a video clip, or a selection of text, to name a few. The particles are generated by a particle emitter and can be emitted in small numbers or in the thousands, depending on the project. Among other things, a particle emitter can be in the form of a single point, a line, a grid, a plane or an object such as a box or sphere, although it can also make use a custom object to serve an emitter, such as a logo, which for example, can be exploded, melted, or transformed into blowing sand. A popular particle system for motion graphics is Particular by Trapcode.\n\nOther examples of individual particles include a blurred sphere that can be used in large numbers to create smoke or fog and a video clip of a person who can be duplicated to create a crowd scene. Particles can be emitted as a single item, although it is typically used in large numbers, such as when creating smoke or rain. They are controlled by directional forces, simulated wind and gravity, objects designed to attract or repel them. Other controllable attributes can include such things as changes in color, size, or transparency. Depending on the system, one can also combine multiple simultaneous emitters, such as when simulating an explosion that combines fire, smoke and flying debris. In an advanced 3-D system the particle can be used to control an animated articulated character, a recognizable example being the warriors in the battle sequences of the film Lord of the Rings.\n\nElements of a motion graphics project can be animated by various means, depending on the capabilities of the software. These elements may be in the form of art, text, photos, and video clips, to name a few. The most popular form of animation is keyframing, in which properties of an object can be specified at certain points in time by setting a series of keyframes so that the properties of the object can be automatically altered (or tweened) in the frames between keyframes. Another method involves a behavior system such as is found in Apple Motion that controls these changes by simulating natural forces without requiring the more rigid but precise keyframing method. Yet another method involves the use of formulas or scripts, such as the expressions function in Adobe After Effects or the creation of ActionScripts within Adobe Flash. Computers are capable of calculating and randomizing changes in imagery to create the illusion of motion and transformation. Computer animations can use less information space (computer memory) by automatically tweening, a process of rendering the key changes of an image at a specified or calculated time. These key poses or frames are commonly referred to as keyframes or low CP. Adobe Flash uses computer animation tweening as well as frame-by-frame animation and video.\nStop motion graphics is the oldest type of motion graphics which has given birth to cinemas, it provides unique effect to the videos.\n\n\nEarly ground breaking motion design studios include: \n\nSince motion design is created using images and video sequences, a complementary tool is a 3d software package. Maya has new MASH module specially design for motion graphics with lots of nodes for complex but interactive animations and seamlessly exports camera, objects to Adobe After Effects. Cinema 4D is widely used for its intuitive interface, layered export to Adobe After Effects, and the additional MoGraph module, but there are other software packages as well. Such packages can generate images or video sequences with an alpha channel, which stores all the transparency information.\n\nMotion design applications include Adobe After Effects, Eyeon Fusion, Nuke, Autodesk Combustion, Apple Motion, Max/MSP, various VJ Programs, Smith Micro Software Anime Studio, Adobe Flash, Natron and Synfig Studio. 3D programs used in motion graphics include Maxon Cinema 4D, Autodesk 3ds Max and Maya, NewTek Lightwave, e-on Vue Infinite and Blender. Motion graphics plug-ins include Magic Bullet, Red Giant Software and The Foundry Visionmongers.\n\n\n"}

Although similar institutions such as brothel ownership and pimping are illegal, prostitution has remained largely unchecked by the government. UNAIDS estimate there to be 22,771 prostitutes in the country.\n\nLack of enforcement of current laws has created a profitable business out of prostitution - one in which both adults and children are a part. There are many causes to the high rates of involvement amongst the women and teens in cities, but the main reason is the high poverty levels. Participants see sex work as a viable option to escape poverty.\n\nUnfortunately, prostitution poses risks to these sex workers, especially in terms of mental, physical, and sexual health effects. There are also worldwide effects due to prostitution out of Honduras and similar countries in Central America. \n\nHonduras has tried to curb these effects but has yet to find a stable solution, despite numerous policy recommendations.\n\nAccording to a study, many commercial sex workers in cities, both men and women, are exposed to sexual and physical violence. 71.4% of street workers were exposed to violence/physical danger and almost 90% were exposed to sexual violence. On top of this, 73.5% of victims were physically abused in their childhood, which shows the origins of such mental and physical effects. For some workers, a lifestyle of abuse and exploitation is all they know.\n\nAnother important aspect is the correlation between prostitution and drug use amongst sex workers. In the same study, nearly 1 in 4 commercial sex workers abuse cocaine, which as a recreational drug, has its own physical effects.\n\nIn terms of mental effects, 63.3% of Commercial sex workers have reported having suicidal behavior in life; this percentage was even higher amongst the women. It is clear that prostitution in Honduran urban centers has created negative mental health issues among those who work in the field.\n\nContrary to the belief that prostitution equates to high levels of HIV/AIDS, a medical report from 2006 states that only “2.4%” of its sample size of 790 female sex workers had HIV. They attribute this low number to the increase in the use of protection among sex workers. In fact, government STI prevention programs have been implemented since the early 2000s in cities across Honduras. Because prostitution is prolific in cities, these programs have proven extremely effective in reducing numbers of HIV incidents.\n\nHonduras has tried, unsuccessfully, to curb Child Prostitution in its country. Lax laws have turned child prostitution into a business that has created prostitution rings both within the country and trafficking to other countries, including the US. \n\nUnfortunately, the business continues to grow as children participate in sex work as a means of surviving.\n\nAlthough this article is specific to Honduras, child prostitution can be viewed in Central America as a whole, because of the networks of prostitution rings from as north as southern Mexico to as south as Costa Rica.\n\nThe first cause is poverty. Prostitution becomes a source of economic opportunity where there is a space of economic regression. Surprisingly, many children who go into prostitution are forced by the parents in order to provide for the family, hence there were high levels of reported abuse in sex workers' childhoods. In a country where there are low literacy rates in rural areas, there is little opportunity to gain economic prosperity through education. \n\nExploiting this reality, sex-tourist agents go to the countryside to find these children and contract them out for work. The agents pay the parents large sums of money up front in exchange for contractual labour done by their children. Modern day slavery.\n\nAnother cause is the promise for a better lifestyle. Some children willingly participate in the child prostitution industry because they believe the quality of life would be better than it was before. There were even reports of some sex workers believing they would get trafficked into a better country where they could start anew. Unfortunately, Some children are homeless or surrounded by gang activity and find similar outlets to survive.\n\nAnother large issue that is rarely mentioned is the influence gender roles in prostitution. Women in Honduras are seen as sexual objects and treated as such. This is why violence levels are so high against sex workers, especially women. Because these women are fundamentally seen as passive objects for a man's pleasure, they are dehumanized and treated as less than human.\n\nThere dangerous physical effects of sex work on children. They live in terrible conditions and are poorly fed, due to their contractors. They are also physically abused by these contractors if they do not deliver well on their jobs.\n\nThere are also extreme mental effects of sex work on children. Children suffer from mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression, but also a lack of confidence and self-worth because they are used as tools. Children have been found to struggle from Complex post-traumatic stress disorder after they have grown up, because of their experience when younger.\n\nIn terms of health effects, children are more likely to suffer from life-threatening illnesses such as tuberculosis and HIV due to the amount of exposure to others in the work and the immaturity of their bodies. Additionally, they are more susceptible to transferring illnesses (STIs) due to how easily their genitals can break.\n\nSex tourism is an issue that is tied to child prostitution because of the large demand by older, adult men. First world western men come to major Honduran cities like Tegucigalpa in order to have sex with minors because it is legal and cheap. The demand of these men further spurs the business, and is the reason for the creation of the sex work contractors.\n\nAlthough pimping is considered illegal, it is still done and an industry has arisen through illegal tourism. Alongside child prostitution, there is also sex trafficking; that is the global selling of human bodies to be bought for sexual purposes, usually without the initial consent of the person who is being moved.\n\nBecause of a low-cost and available population, trafficking has occurred both in and out of Honduras. These rings have extended their reach to even the United States. Here are a few reasons why sex trafficking occurs.\n\nThe first reason is deceit. Sex workers are lured with the promise of a better life, and are sold to wealthy people in the United States. On top of this, those already in the industry voluntarily go to the United States because there is the opportunity for better.\n\nAnother reason is government corruption. Although trafficking is illegal, countries have reported government officials helping to smuggle persons and drafting fake documents to facilitate such smuggling.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Honduras as a 'Tier 2' country.\n\nHonduras has struggled to make effective government policy to combat this issue. The country planned to implement a National Plan of Action to Eradicate Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, but the plan never came to fruition.\n\nThe United Nations, the United States, and other international bodies have recommended policy to end child prostitution and sex trafficking. The number one policy to be put in place is ensuring safe and viable routes to economic prosperity, which means increasing access to education. Other Central American countries such as Costa Rica have put in educational measures to ensure their young citizens have access to academic and career opportunity.\n\nThere is also the need for child protection services. This means a legal and societal framework to stop traffickers from recruiting these children - support through laws and the community. This policy is outlined in a report on child prostitution in Honduras by the United Nations Human Rights Council. Honduras has taken these policies into consideration, but whether they are realized remains to be seen.\n\nAdditionally, Non-governmental organizations like Casa Alianza and the International Labour Organization’s International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour have created programs working alongside the Honduran Government to tackle this problem.\n"}

{"id": "14922790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14922790", "title": "Red Bull New Year No Limits", "text": "Red Bull New Year No Limits\n\nNew Year No Limits was an annual American television special that aired on ESPN from December 31, 2007 until January 1, 2012. It was created, hosted and sponsored by Red Bull. The program usually aired after the Chick-fil-A Bowl (around 11 PM) until 1 AM Eastern time.\n\nThe 2007 version originated from the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. Joe Tessitore, Mark Schlereth, Cam Steele, and Jamie Little were the commentators.\n\nOn this show, freestyle motocross rider Robbie Maddison set a new world record for the longest jump on a motorcycle, jumping 322 feet, 7½ inches. He then made a second attempt, largely because his personal goal was 360 feet. He failed in that attempt, and in fact the second jump was slightly shorter.\n\nMaddison jumped above a makeshift football field set up in the Rio's parking lot, which was used to provide a perspective of the distance.\n\nThe show was also scheduled to feature the first-ever backflip in an off-road truck, performed by Rhys Millen, best known for his skills as a drifting race car driver. However, he suffered a back injury in his final warm-up jump when the truck overshot safety barriers. Millen did speak to Schlereth by telephone.\n\nIn the original plan, Maddison was to have jumped shortly after midnight ET and Millen's flip was set for 3 a.m. ET. However, because of the overtime finish of the Chick-fil-A Bowl that preceded it, and as a safety precaution due to headwinds at the site, Maddison did not jump until approximately 12:45 a.m. (9:45 p.m. Dec. 31 in Las Vegas). \"SportsCenter\", which was set as interstitial programming, then followed at 1:10 a.m. ET and was re-run in its entirety in place of the canceled Millen stunt.\n\nAngels and Airwaves performed at the end of the show.\n\nEarly promotions indicated that \"New Year No Limits\" was presented by MGM, the distributor of the upcoming mockumentary release \"The Poughkeepsie Tapes\", though the sponsorship was dropped when MGM decided to shelve that film (which would not be released in any form until 2014).\n\nThe 2008 New Year No Limits jump once again featured Maddison, and this time the off-road attempt to backflip a truck by Millen was once again on the plan, with the popular Kiwi racer on the docket on the undercard before the motorcycle jump.\n\nAt 8:30 PM PT, Millen performed the backflip on the truck, launching at 36 MPH, traveled 80 feet at a height of 50 feet, and landed hard on all four wheels before the truck then rolled.\n\nShortly after the stroke of the new year in the Eastern time zone (about 35 minutes later), Maddison successfully connected on a ten-story high jump landing on top of a replica of the Arc de Triomphe at a Las Vegas casino. While that was successful, he lacerated his left hand on the ensuing 60' drop.\n\nThe 2009 New Year No Limits moved west to Long Beach, California, where Travis Pastrana, a four-time Rally America champion and part-time WRC driver, jumped a Subaru Impreza STI rally car off the Pine Avenue pier, soaring 269 feet on Rainbow Harbor, and landed on a floating barge shortly after 9 PM Pacific time. He celebrated by hitting a back flip off the landing ramp into Rainbow Harbor.\n\nThe 2010 New Year No Limits was planned to move to San Diego, California, where Levi LaVallee, a seven-time Winter X Games medalist and champion snocross racer, was to attempt to jump his Polaris snowmobile longer than ever before and eclipse the current record of 301 feet. The event would have taken place at the Embarcadero Marina Park in the Port of San Diego. Embarcadero is Spanish for “landing place,” making it an appropriate location for LaVallee’s jump.\n\nOn Friday December 17, Red Bull officially announced that Levi Lavallee was injured during a practice run and would be unable to make his record setting attempt during the special telecast. As a result, there was no New Year, No Limits event for 2010. During the practice sessions leading up to the event Levi managed to land a record setting 361 foot jump shattering the old record of 301 feet. Since the official event for the attempt did not take place the practice run has been submitted for the official world record title. An episode of SportsCenter aired in place of \"New Year No Limits\".\n\nThe 2011 edition of \"New Year No Limits\" featured LaVallee making a second attempt at crossing San Diego Bay while Robbie Maddison attempted to do the same on a motorcycle; the two attempts took place side-by-side. The event was televised on ESPN and was also broadcast on the Internet via ESPN3.\n\nLaVallee set a new World Record unofficially during his jump landing at a distance of 412 ft. Robbie Maddison landed his jump at 378 ft, 9 inches also an unofficial World Record, but short of his stated goal of 400 ft.\n\nThe program would not air in 2012 into 2013, and was effectively cancelled with the launch of the College Football Playoff on ESPN in 2014, which effectively monopolized New Year's Eve and New Year's Day with bowl programming rather than a need for counterprogramming.\n\n"}
{"id": "52682356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52682356", "title": "Rossa Matilda Richter", "text": "Rossa Matilda Richter\n\nRossa Matilda Richter (1863–8 December 1937) was an English aerialist and actor who became the first human cannonball at the age of 14. She began performing at a very young age, practicing aerial stunts like tightrope walking in an old London church. She took up ballet, gymnastics, and trapeze by the time she was 6 and, at 12, went on tour with a travelling acrobat troupe. In 1877, using the stage name Zazel, she was the first person to be fired out of a cannon, in front of a large crowd at the Royal Aquarium.\n\nJournalists and the public voiced concerns for her safety from the time of her earliest appearances as Zazel. She was named by a lawmaker as one of the reasons for proposed legislation in England to prevent dangerous acrobatic stunts, leading her to take the show to the United States. She toured Europe and North America with circuses including Barnum & Bailey, executing tightrope, trapeze, and high dive routines in addition to the human cannonball. Throughout her career, she suffered several accidents and injuries, the most serious of which largely ended her career in 1891. \n\nDuring time off from the circus, she started an opera company with her husband and took singing roles in some of its productions. She also volunteered time writing and holding exhibitions to promote the life-saving potential for safety nets. \n\nRichter was born in London in 1863 to parents from Dresden. Her father, Ernst Richter, was a well known talent agent who supplied performers and animals to circuses and other productions. Her mother, Susanne Richter, was a dancer in a circus. She had at least one sibling—an older sister. As a child, she was taught how to fall before she was taught how to perform, practising in an old condemned church in London, where her wire stretched from the chancel down through the nave to the gallery, and her nets spread below.\n\nShe began her performance career at the age of four or five, playing one of Cinderella's sisters in a pantomime at the Raglan Music Hall. She was only filling in for another child who had fallen ill, but according to the \"New York Clipper\", \"she filled the role so well that she became a favorite\" and gave a series of additional performances at the Drury Lane theatre. She received ballet lessons from a respected instructor and subsequently took up gymnastics, learning from teachers named Stergenbach and the Levanti brothers. She also became active as a trapeze artist from the time she was six years old, performing for the first time at Garrick Theatre in Whitechapel. She became known for a \"leap-for-life\" stunt on the trapeze which she performed throughout her career. During some of these early performances, she used the stage name La Petite Lulu. \n\nWhen she was twelve she joined a travelling Japanese or Siamese acrobat troupe, with whom she honed her balancing skills that she would rely upon throughout her circus career. They travelled to put on shows in Dublin, Marseilles, and Toulouse. According to the \"Clipper\", \"she was known as the only Japanese girl that ever visited Europe, and received many medals as rewards for her daring and skill.\" During the show in Toulouse she suffered the first of many accidents during a performance, falling during a trapeze act. Her injury was severe enough that it took her away from performing for a short time. According to her father, it was because he would not sanction further performances. Richter returned home to London in 1873.\n\nThe human cannonball act was conceived by William Leonard Hunt, a Canadian daredevil who went by the name \"The Great Farini.\" He was known both for his own high wire performances, such as when he crossed Niagara Falls, and for the high-profile performers he managed. Before Richter, Farini's best known act was his adopted son Samuel Wasgate. Starting in 1870, Farini dressed him in women's clothing and began advertising performances for \"The Beautiful Lulu the girl Aerialist and Circassian Catapultist.\" The Lulu act was very successful, and became known for stunts which involved Wasgate being launched by catapult, either into a net or up to a trapeze. It was not until a serious accident sent him to the hospital that his true identity became known. Lulu's catapult act led Farini to conceive of a cannon-based act. In 1871, years before its first public display, he filed a patent in the US for \"certain new and useful Apparatus for Projecting Persons and Articles into or through the Air.\" When the Royal Aquarium in London hired him to improve its profitability, he did so through spectacular acts like the human cannonball.\n\nErnst Richter was familiar with Farini, and had years prior sworn that he \"should never have a dog of mine, much less a daughter, for his dangerous performances. What, indeed, would the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals say to Farini firing off even a donkey from a cannon?\" Suzanne Richter was not so protective, however, and Ernst said she got him to sign an agreement with Farini by misleading him to believe it was not with Farini but one of Ernst's friends, and that Rossa would only be singing and dancing.\n\nIn April 1877, the 14-year-old Richter became the first human cannonball, performing as \"Zazel, the Beautiful Human Cannonball.\" The \"Mackay Mercury\" wrote that the event \"hurled her from the jaws of death into the arms of fame.\" She was fired out of a spring-style cannon, travelling through the air and landing in a net. Accounts of the event vary on the distance she traveled, between and . The cannon used rubber springs to limit the distance she would travel. Although Farini had filed another patent in England in 1875 (and in the US in 1879) for an \"adaptation [of the cannon] so as to use explosives as a means for releasing the catch,\" a gunpowder-based explosion was used only for effect during the show.\n\nMost sources, including the \"Guinness Book of World Records\", cite Richter as the first human cannonball. However, the claim has been contested by others who claim that \"The Australian Marvels,\" Ella Zuila and George Loyal, performed the act a few years earlier. Zuila and Loyal were hired by Adam Forepaugh, an American circus owner who learned that his rival, Barnum, may bring Richter to North America. The duo were a featured attraction in Forepaugh's circus and drew comparisons to Richter for their similar aerial stunts. Their cannonball stunts differed somewhat in that rather than being fired from a cannon into a net, Loyal was projected from the cannon and caught by Zuila, who would be hanging upside down with her knees over the bar of a trapeze.\n\nRichter was featured at the Aquarium for an extended period of time, performing sometimes twice in a day, and often to a full room of people. The show could draw tens of thousands of people to a single performance. Farini also brought her to perform at other venues in western Europe. Louis Cooke wrote in \"The Billboard\" that \"the breathless silence that always preceded the act while it was being prepared only added to its intensity, and the graceful bow of the young lady who had the temerity and muscular strength to withstand the shock and presence of mind to guide her flight never failed to receive a round of rapturous applause.\" A writer for \"The Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News\" wrote a gushing review of the act, after seeing it multiple times, in the 26 May 1877 issue. It praised \"her unhesitating confidence, the graceful ease and swiftness of her motions, together with her placidly smiling face, [which] destroy all sense of fear for her safety in the minds of the audience, and enable them to enjoy the spectacle of her extraordinary agility, strength, and seemingly terribly daring feats, with none but pleasurable, although strongly excited sensations.\" The author went on to describe the mix of anxiety and delight an audience member should expect to experience, and noted that she counted among her fans future king Edward VII, who reportedly attended two of her shows when he was Prince of Wales.\n\nMusic often accompanied her performances. At the Aquarium, musical director Charles Dubois composed waltzes for her, which featured prominently in some of the show's advertising. Farini also wrote a song, \"Zazel,\" which was sung by George Leybourne and published by Musical Bouquet.\n\nThe human cannonball was not her only act. She also began performing a high dive at around the same time, also at the Aquarium. For that stunt she would jump from a raised platform into a net, gradually increasing the distance over time until reaching a peak of . The \"West Australian\" wrote that she would start atop the proscenium arch, fall into the net, then pop up to smile at the audience. She also walked the tightrope, increasing the difficulty by sometimes forgoing the standard balancing pole. She would also perform tricks, such as running, standing on one foot, putting baskets on her feet, lying down or sitting on the wire, spinning around while holding it with her knees, and finally jumping off, falling down about into a net. \"The Era\" wrote that the dive was \"astounding\" and that \"she is wonderfully clever and graceful\" on the tightrope.\n\nOnce the human cannonball act started and became popular, people began protesting the perceived danger of the show and tried unsuccessfully to have it stopped. Concerned complaints made their way to the Home Secretary, Richard Assheton Cross, who told the Aquarium's manager, Wybrow Robertson, that he would be accountable should an accident befall Richter. In response, Robertson invited Cross to be fired out of the cannon himself.\n\nRichter's first human cannonball accident was at the Aquarium, followed by another in Portsmouth in 1879, where the net used to catch her was rotten due to wear and she fell through. Though she did not break any bones, her condition was serious enough that she could not perform the next day. \"The Citizen\" wrote about the outrage expressed at the apparently sloppy safety checks that had missed the poor condition of the net: \"If the public demands such sickening exhibitions ... then most certainly it is the bounden duty of those in authority to see that the precaution is a reality, and not a farce.\" \"The Graphic\" insisted \"When will the Home Secretary be made to see the necessity of putting some restraint upon the suicidal sensational acrobatic feats, which are now, to our shame, be it said, so popular?\" An 1880 issue of \"The Orchestra\" likewise scolded audiences, saying that these acts \"prove the morbid taste of the public who delight in such exhibitions.\"\n\nAfter the Portsmouth accident, Ernst Richter went to the office of the periodical \"Truth\" to talk to one of its writers. It had published the opinion that someone ought to prevent her from performing such a dangerous act, and Ernst came to ask them how he could do just that. He was afraid for her safety and wanted to get her away from Farini and his stunts. By that time, Ernst had left the entertainment business, worked as an engineer, and had separated from Susanna, with whom Rossa lived and who raised no such objections to the potential for danger. Ernst said that \"the newspapers say that someone ought to interfere to hinder her from risking her life for money. I am her father, and want to interfere ... When the cannon is fired off, her limbs have to be rigid. If by mistake it is fired one moment too soon, she might be killed. When she takes her dive, if she did not fall lightly, she would break a limb; and if the net underneath is rotten, as it was at Portsmouth, she might be killed.\" The \"Truth\" reporter admitted he did not know much about the law, but said he should talk to a magistrate to ask how to get an injunction, opining that the justice system should indeed \"prevent girls and children from risking their limbs in order that, with or without the consent of their parents, their task-masters may deserve profit.\"\n\nLater the same year, on 15 December 1879, she fell during a trapeze performance in Chatham, Kent. The \"New York Clipper\" reported that the net seemed not to be much protection in the spot she landed, and she \"was in an apparently senseless condition\", exclaiming \"I am killed, I am killed!\" as she was taken away from the performing area. She was not found to be seriously injured and later performed again with her hands bandaged, \"and evidently suffering from great nervousness.\"\n\nIn 1880 Edward Jenkins brought the Acrobats and Gymnasts' Bill to the House of Commons, which aimed to prevent dangerous acrobatic stunts. There was some push-back to the idea based on the notion that it might also prohibit less dangerous acrobatic performances, to which Jenkins clarified that it really had a handful of performers in mind, including Zazel. There was extended debate across two parliaments, much of it focused on how to draw the line between dangerous and acceptable acts. Many years later, Richter gave her opinion of the legal interventions in an interview with John Squire, eventually published in \"Solo & Duet\": \"A lot of those interfering men in Parliament started a committee about it and they passed a law forbidding me to do it. Oh, I was wretched! ... I loved it. They'd just no right to take away me living if I loved it. I was ambitious. I wanted to be great. You see, it was me art.\"\n\nThe relationship between Richter and Farini was nearer to manager-employee than collaborators, and Farini kept most of the earnings from the lucrative shows, amounting to 120–200 pounds sterling per week. In 1879, a reporter observed that when travelling to different venues, she did so with a normal train ticket: \"it might have been supposed that those who derive rich benefits from the clever but dangerous performances ... would have paid for her the very small difference between a first- and second-class ticket from Sloane Square to St. James's Park.\" According to P. T. Barnum, who had travelled to London to see the performance, Richter pleaded with him to take her away. She was upset at the small share of money she received from Farini, when she was the star of the act and took the physical risks.\n\nFarini made it well known that the Zazel act belonged to him, publicizing notices to that effect. When Richter began asking for more money, he secretly began training additional young women to perform as Zazel. It is unclear when and to what extent the other \"Zazels\" performed, but the number of acts using that name became common enough that Richter began to refer to herself as \"the original Zazel.\" \n\nIn 1880, during proceedings concerning the Acrobats and Gymnasts' Bill, Farini and Richter left England. She performed with the Barnum & Bailey Circus for a season, performing in France and then the United States. Her 8 April 1880 debut in New York \"was in every way successful, and received fervid applause,\" according to the \"Clipper\". Though she was best known as a human cannonball, Richter continued to perform other aerial acts, like the high dive and trapeze. She returned to Europe with Farini in November 1881, stayed a short time, and returned to the United States in 1882, touring with John B. Doris's Inter-Ocean Show.\n\nRichter married George Oscar Starr, who worked as a press agent for Barnum; and, together, they took some time away from the circus. Among other activities, they launched the Starr Opera Company in 1886. They intended it to be accessible to a popular audience, and even staged a concert for people incarcerated at Michigan State Prison. Though it had been reported that she sang a song called \"It Is So Easy\" after certain circus performances, she was not previously known for singing. Nonetheless, she played various parts in comic opera, including a performances as Regina in \"La princesse de Trébizonde\" and Eliza in \"Billee Taylor, or The Reward of Virtue\". According to the \"Clipper\", she \"showed that she had not only an excellent voice, but the grace and action which only long experience and study can give the artist.\"\n\nWhen George Starr was offered a position as managing director of Barnum & Bailey, she decided to reenter circus life. She also began using her expertise to educate the public and public safety workers about the usefulness and potential of safety nets, for example to catch people jumping out of burning buildings. Dressed in normal clothing, including jewellery and a hat, she would throw herself out of a building window into a net. An 1892 edition of \"The West Australian\" describes one such exhibition: \"There was never a more fearless woman gymnast than this Zazel, who jumped nonchalantly from a fourth storey window into a net to illustrate the possibilities of the net as a means of saving life. She tied a stout cord about her skirts, and throwing her head up and backward, she sprang to the centre of the net as confidently and as gracefully as my lady springs from her carriage.\"\n\nShe volunteered her time to advocate for the use of nets as life-saving tools for several years. In addition to performing stunts, she wrote on the subject for people who live in large buildings and worked with \"The Evening Sun\" to publicise her ideas, sparking conversation throughout the US. According to the \"Clipper\", \"she received the thanks of the New York Fire Department for her bravery and advice, and the press unite in editorially praising her actions.\"\n\nIn 1891, while touring the United States with Adam Forepaugh's circus, she nearly died during a show in New Mexico. She performed with the cannon as well as on a tight wire. The wire was about 40 feet off the ground, running from the side of the circus tent to two poles braced together in the centre, fit with a platform. According to a witness interviewed in the \"Mackay Mercury\", the poles were supposed to be fastened together with a steel band, but it was accidentally left off. When she was out on the wire, starting to put up an umbrella, she signalled to her coworkers, who thought she wanted them to tighten the wire. When they did so, the poles came apart and Richter fell to the ground. She landed on her hands and knees, and one of the poles fell on her back. When the poles were moved and someone picked her up, her body could not straighten out. Two men pulled her shoulders and legs to straighten out her appearance. The crowd panicked and she was heard screaming. The witness said it was \"the most horrible accident I ever witnessed ... and I have seen a good many accidents in my day.\" She had broken her back. Local medical professionals provided short-term treatment before she was taken to facilities in New York. The accident effectively retired her from her circus career, and she spent several months in a suspended full body cast.\n\nAt some point Rossa and her husband moved back to England, living in a house in Upper Norwood. He died in 1915 and requested that his ashes be spread to the \"four winds\" on the boat ride between the UK and US. British laws did not allow it, but she fulfilled his request secretly the following year, and then returned to England. In an update in a 1933 issue of \"The Bystander\", she said that she was living on her own in Southern England, enjoying playing roulette when she had the opportunity. She died on 8 December 1937 at Camberwell House hospital in Peckham.\n\nPress coverage of Richter's performances remarked on the impressive spectacle of the act and her fearlessness and athleticism. \"The West Australian\" wrote that \"there was never a more fearless woman gymnast\" and said that \"fear was to her an unknown quantity\". That she also jumped out of buildings to demonstrate the functionality of a safety net further established that she was brave even outside of the confines of a circus tent. The \"Clipper\" said that \"personally Zazel is bright, intelligent and noted for her acts of charity.\"\n\nThough young, Richter was sexualised in advertising materials from the time of her earliest Zazel performances. Whereas \"The Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News\" explained that women may appreciate her athleticism, it also provided several descriptions of her \"most perfect\" figure. Brian Tyson speculated that, looking at the advertising materials, some of the act's appeal may have been because \"in order to fit into the cannon, she had to shed most of her Victorian clothing.\" The painter George Frederic Watts asserted both that she was \"the bravest woman I ever saw\" and that her \"form [was] the most perfect he ever saw.\" When Watts asked her to sit for a portrait, her sister came along as a chaperone. She told \"The Bystander\" that at some point she asked her manager, likely Farini, whether she should donate Watts' portrait to the National Portrait Gallery. \"He just laughed and said 'whatever would they want in the National Gallery with a picture of \"you\"!'\" (emphasis in the original). the Gallery has three portraits of her in its collections: two lithographs by Alfred Concanen and another by an unknown artist.\n\nAccording to historians Janet Davis and Peta Tait, circus performers like Richter challenged stereotypes of femininity through acts that demonstrated unabashed feats of strength and agility. Some began to think she was actually a man dressed like a woman. Tait argued that the cannon spectacle, typically at the end of a show, served not only to provide a powerful conclusion but also to balance her other acts' more physical displays of athleticism with a more feminised, relatively passive helplessness — \"a beautiful lady shot from a monstrous cannon.\" Shane Peacock's description of the show also highlights this dynamic: \"Farini stood at the cannon, looking evil in his black beard, commanding the sweet, beautiful young Zazel to enter the mortar, and lighting the fuse to a great flourish, sending her across the [Aquarium's] great hall into a net of his own invention.\" A commentator wrote extensively about her talents, appearance, and personality, saying that \"her nature was as pure and sunshiny as her face and form were beautiful.\" Elaborating on her \"purity,\" it went on to say that \"princes sought her favor, but Zazel remained the pure girl and woman that she is today. Her purity was recognised by Queen Victoria.\" Circus promoters highlighted their female stars' domesticity so as not to be seen as too revolutionary in terms of women's equality. Interviewers asked Richter about circus life, and her marriage to Starr facilitated discussion of the wholesome, quasi-traditional lives of the performers. She told one interviewer, speaking for women in the circus in general, that \"the domestic instinct is very strong among circus women, for the reason that they are deprived of home life a great part of every year. She finds an outlet in many little ways, one of which is an appeal to the chef in charge of the dining car to be allowed to bake a cake.\" Combining statements about female performers' strength with flattering descriptions of their beauty and figure may have served a similar balancing function.\n\nRichter's cannon act inspired a scene in the Henry James Byron burlesque, \"Little Doctor Faust\", when it played at the Gaiety Theatre. Nellie Farren's titular character would climb into a cannon, escaping through a hidden trap door in the stage while her costar, Edward O'Connor Terry, used a ramrod to simulate preparing the cannon to fire. After an explosion, she would run back in from the other side of the stage. This act, too, met with an accident when the trap door failed to open. When her costar began to use the ramrod, he realised he was hitting her rather than the cannon interior. Improvising, Terry asked \"Are you in? Are you far in? Are you nearly far in?\", a pun based on her name, \"Nellie Farren.\" The scene as well as Terry's ad lib received such a strong response that they were retained in future performances.\n\n\"Young Man's Fancy\", a 1939 British comedy film written and directed by Robert Stevenson and co-written by Roland Pertwee, featured a character based on Richter. Anna Lee played the role, Ada, an Irish human cannonball.\n\n"}
{"id": "77879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=77879", "title": "Samaritans (charity)", "text": "Samaritans (charity)\n\nSamaritans is a registered charity aimed at providing emotional support to anyone in emotional distress, struggling to cope, or at risk of suicide throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland, often through their telephone helpline. Although Samaritans is a secular organisation, the name is derived from the Biblical Parable of the Good Samaritan. \n\nIts international network exists under the name Befrienders Worldwide, which is part of the Volunteer Emotional Support Helplines (VESH) with Lifeline International and the International Federation of Telephone Emergency Services (IFOTES).\n\nSamaritans was founded in 1953 by Chad Varah, a vicar in the Church of England Diocese of London. His inspiration came from an experience he had had some years earlier as a young curate in the Diocese of Lincoln. He had taken a funeral for a girl of fourteen who had killed herself because she feared she had contracted an STD. In reality, she was menstruating. Varah placed an advertisement in a newspaper encouraging people to volunteer at his church, listening to people contemplating suicide. \n\nThe movement grew rapidly: within ten years there were 40 branches and now there are 201 branches across the UK and Ireland helping many, deliberately organised without regard to national boundaries on the basis that a service which is not political or religious should not recognise sectarian or political divisions. Samaritans offers support through over 21,200 trained volunteers (2015) and is entirely dependent on voluntary support. The name was not originally chosen by Chad Varah: it was part of a headline to an article in the \"Daily Mirror\" newspaper on 7 December 1953 about Varah's work.\n\nIn 2004, Samaritans announced that volunteer numbers had reached a thirty-year low, and launched a campaign to recruit more young people (specifically targeted at ages 18–24) to become volunteers. The campaign was fronted by Phil Selway, drummer with the band Radiohead, himself a Samaritans volunteer.\n\nIn 2004, Varah announced that he had become disillusioned with Samaritans. He said, \"It's no longer what I founded. I founded an organisation to offer help to suicidal or equally desperate people. The last elected chairman re-branded the organisation. It was no longer to be an emergency service, it was to be emotional support\". One in five calls to Samaritans are from someone with suicidal feelings. Samaritans' vision is that fewer people will die by suicide.\n\nThe core of Samaritans' work is a telephone helpline, operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Samaritans was the first 24-hour telephone helpline to be set up in the UK. In addition, the organisation offers a drop-in service for face-to-face discussion, undertakes outreach at festivals and other outdoor events, trains prisoners as \"Listeners\" to provide support within prisons, and undertakes research into suicide and emotional health issues.\n\nSince 1994, Samaritans has also offered confidential email support. Initially operating from one branch, the service is now provided by 198 branches and co-ordinated from the organisation's head office. In 2011, Samaritans received over 206,000 emails, including many from outside the UK, and aims to answer each one within twelve hours.\nIn 2009, Ofcom introduced the first harmonised European numbers for harmonised services of social value, allocating 116 123 to Samaritans. This number is free to call from mobiles and landlines. From 22 September 2015, Samaritans has promoted 116123 as their main number, replacing the premium rate 0845 number previously advertised.\n\nIn 2014, Samaritans received 5,100,000 calls for help – almost one every six seconds – by phone, email, text, letter, minicom, Typetalk, face-to-face at a branch, through their work in prisons, and at local and national festivals and other events. \n\nSamaritans volunteers are given rigorous training, and as such they are non-judgmental, empathic and congruent. By listening and asking open questions, the Samaritans volunteers help people explore their feelings and work out their own way forward.\n\nSamaritans does not denounce suicide, and it is not necessary to be suicidal to contact Samaritans. In 2014, nearly 80% of the people calling Samaritans did not express suicidal feelings. Samaritans believes that offering people the opportunity to be listened to in confidence, and accepted without prejudice, can alleviate despair and make emotional health a mainstream issue.\n\nIn 2013, following extensive consultation with journalists and editors throughout the industry, Samaritans produced a set of guidelines outlining best practice when reporting suicide. Since its publication, the organisation has received many awards in recognition of its work influencing the way in which suicide is reported.\n\nOn 29 October 2014, Samaritans launched the Samaritans Radar app, which Twitter users could activate to analyse tweets posted by people they followed; it sent an email alert to the user if it detected signs of distress in a tweet. However, because Twitter users were not notified that their account was being monitored in this way, concerns were raised that the service could be abused by stalkers and internet trolls, who would instantly be made aware that an intended victim was potentially feeling vulnerable.\n\nFollowing concerns, the service was suspended on 7 November 2014, nine days after launch. Joe Ferns, policy director for Samaritans, said in a statement: \"We have made the decision to suspend the application at this time for further consideration\". He added: \"We are very aware that the range of information and opinion, which is circulating about Samaritans Radar, has created concern and worry for some people and would like to apologise to anyone who has inadvertently been caused any distress. This was not our intention\". The app was later withdrawn completely.\n\nSamaritans have a strict code of caller confidentiality, even after the death of a caller. Unless the caller gives consent to pass on information, confidentiality will be broken only in rare circumstances, such as when Samaritans receives bomb or terrorism warnings, to call an ambulance because a caller appears to be incapable of making rational decisions for him or herself, or when the caller is threatening volunteers or deliberately preventing the service being delivered to other callers.\n\nIn November 2011, the Board of Trustees UK agreed a motion breaking with confidentiality in the Republic of Ireland by agreeing, “To provide confidential support to children but report to the Health Service Executive any contacts (from either adults or children) where it appears a child is experiencing specific situations such as those that can cause them serious harm from themselves or others.”\nIn 2011, Facebook collaborated with Samaritans to offer help to people in distress. This led to 'cold case' calling, which some believed was an infringement on people's privacy. An Irish journalist wrote of her experience of receiving such a communication.\n\nThrough its email service, Samaritans' work has extended well beyond the UK and Ireland, as messages are received from all around the world.\n\nSamaritans' international reach is through Befrienders Worldwide, an organisation of over 400 centres in 38 countries offering similar activities. Samaritans took on and renamed the Befrienders International network in 2003, a year after it collapsed. Some members of Befrienders Worldwide also use the name Samaritans; this includes centres in the United States, India, Hong Kong, Serbia and Zimbabwe, among others.\n\nThe Volunteer Emotional Support Helplines (VESH) combines Samaritans (through Befrienders Worldwide) with the other two largest international services (IFOTES & Lifeline), and plans a combined international network of helplines. In their roles as emotional support service networks, they have all agreed to develop a more effective and robust international interface.\n\nSee also\n\nA number of other helplines exist that offer a similar service to Samaritans. These are often aimed at a specific sector/group of people.\n\nOne example is Nightline — student-run listening and information services, based at universities across the country, offer a night time support service for students. Each service is run specifically for students at a particular university/geographical area, and most Nightlines are members of the Nightline Association, a registered charity in England and Wales.\n\nThe NSPCC's ChildLine service is similar to Samaritans in some ways. NSPCC (National Service of Prevention of Cruelty to Children) offers support for children only, but Samaritans supports both children and adults alike. The NSPCC does not usually support adults.\n\nAnother example is Aware — a national voluntary organisation, based in Ireland, which provides supports to individuals who experience depression with their families and friends. It provides a Helpline service, as well as nationwide Support Groups and monthly lectures, which seek to educate and increase awareness of depression.\n\n\n"}

The company was launched in 2005 after the work of Samuel Loyd and his son in the 1800 and 1900’s. He produced puzzles for a number of resources including the New York Saturday Courier, Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Women’s Home Companion and created puzzle cards for advertising purposes. It was 2005 before the company was founded to republish and protect Loyd’s original work.\n\nBetween the years of 1855 and 1910, Sam Loyd produced a number of puzzles and chess problems for a variety of newspapers and magazines. These included the New York Courier and Our Puzzle Magazine. The White Horse Monument was his most successful puzzle, which was based on the White Horse Monument in Berkshire, UK.\n\nOther puzzles created by Sam Loyd still used today include, ‘Trick Donkey’s Puzzle’, ‘Get Off the Earth’ and ‘Puzzle of Teddy and the Lion’. The puzzles he created went on to be known as some of the best of all time. After his death in 1911, his son Walther continued his work.\n\nWalther Loyd began by creating a puzzle book for children, something the company would later focus on. He also created the book ‘Sam Loyd’s Cyclopedia of 500 Puzzles, Tricks and Conundrums. All the work created by Sam Loyd and his son is managed and protected by the Sam Loyd Company.\n\n71 years after the passing of Sam Loyd Jnr. work began on republishing the original ‘Get Off the Earth’ Puzzle. A website containing the puzzle was also launched. In 2004, “Get Off the Earth Puzzle' is republished as a commemorative edition, 110 years after Sam Loyd had received his original patent for the puzzle.\n\nIn 2005 The Sam Loyd Company was founded. In the same year both Trick Donkey’s and The Pony Puzzles are republished.\n\nThe Sam Loyd Company recreated a number of puzzles including figurines, republished puzzles and advertising cards. The only figurine they have produced was of the Warrior action figure, taken from the ‘Get Off the Earth’ puzzle. This figurine was a limited edition and only 500 were produced.\n\nThe company also owns the rights to a number of silent movies that were created in 1917 after the success of the puzzles. These videos have close links with Thomas Edison, who helped bring the work to life. The idea was to create educational films that could be shown in classrooms. The videos included the railroad mix up, quarrelsome neighbors and the puzzling board.\n\nThe Sam Loyd Company has close links to education. The puzzles are aimed at making algebraic and geographical problems more interesting. The idea is that people can puzzle over them without realizing they are learning at the same time. The influences came from Samuel Loyd who was quoted saying, “We see how the average boy, who abhors square root or algebra, will find delight in working out puzzles which involve identically the same principles.\n"}
{"id": "53519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53519", "title": "Theatre of Poland", "text": "Theatre of Poland\n\nIn common with other European countries, the most frequent and most popular form of theatre in Poland is dramatic theatre, based on the existence of relatively stable artistic companies. It is above all a theatre of directors, who decide on the form of its productions and the appearance of individual scenes. There is no strict division in Poland between theatre and film directors and actors, therefore many stage artists are known to theatre goers from films of Andrzej Wajda, for example: Wojciech Pszoniak, Daniel Olbrychski, Krystyna Janda, Jerzy Radziwiłowicz, and from films of Krzysztof Kieślowski, actors such as Jerzy Stuhr, Janusz Gajos and others.\n\nAlongside the many types of dramatic theatre whose basis is literature, there are in Poland historic forms of theatre in which spoken word is not the most important means of expression, e.g., visual theatre popular against state censorship, musical theatre, theatre of movement, etc. An equal popularity is being gained by theatres employing puppets, figures, or shadows; there is even a theatre of drawing as well as a theatre of fire.\n\nThe strength of Polish dramatic theatre lies in the professionalism of its actors. The tradition of the great 19th century players, with Helena Modrzejewska – the \"star of two continents\" – at its forefront, has been continued by successive generations of university trained artists. This variety and authentic commitment by so many people provides the best evidence that theatre was and still is an inspirational experience in Poland. Further proof may be seen in the degree of audience interest toward the new, experimental theatre, creating a unique ambiance around them. It may also be seen in the expansion of festival life and respected theatre magazines, e.g., \"Dialog\", which has, for decades, presented the latest achievements in world dramaturgy. Alongside the established institutions with seasoned professionals and centuries-old traditions, there are amateur theatres and travelling groups as well.\n\nAmong the professional companies, the most representative is the National Theatre in Warsaw. The core of its repertoire consists of the most cherished Polish and foreign dramas, with which directors conduct their individual dialogues, asking these classic pieces questions tormenting modern-day Poles. Within this exploration, the National Theatre frequently attempts very courageous experiments, which means that its stage, although a showcase, is not at all academic. Most characteristic are the productions of Jerzy Grzegorzewski (Theatre director between 1997–2002), who, employing complicated stage equipment (metaphoric scenographic elements such as pantographs, huge musical instruments, or symbolic props) and creating his own montage of classic texts, testing their value, searching for their relevance to the here and now.\n\nSomewhat more conservative is the second Polish theatre with national status - the National Old Theatre in Kraków, the only one in Poland belonging to the Union of European Theatres. This theatre, which shone in the seventies thanks to the well-regarded and world-famous productions of Konrad Swinarski, Jerzy Jarocki, and Andrzej Wajda, is attempting to continue these traditions, seeking worthy successors to these masters. The Old Theatre's most important current collaborator is Krystian Lupa. For years, he has been consistently producing the dramas and prose of German language writers (T. Bernhardt, R.M. Rilke, R. Musil), not even hesitating before transferring Broch's novel \"The Sleepwalkers\" to the stage. Russian literature also lies within his sphere of interest (productions of Dostoyevsky's \"The Brothers Karamazov\" and, recently, M. Bulgakov's \"The Master and Margarita\"). Lupa shatters the traditional action of the performances, stretching their tempos and concentrating on the poetic values of particular situations rather than the plot or conflict. This is a theatre of philosophical and existential reflection in whose centre is situated the modern human being, attempting to find a place in an ever more dehumanised world. For several seasons now, Lupa's productions have been regularly shown in Paris, where they have been received with great admiration by critics and audiences. Lupa is also one of the most important teachers of directing at the Ludwik Solski Academy for the Dramatic Arts in Kraków, where his students have included the newest generation of Polish directors: Krzysztof Warlikowski, Grzegorz Jarzyna, Maja Kleczewska, Anna Augustynowicz, Michal Zadara and Jan Klata.\n\nAt present, the Polish theatre actor possibly best-known outside the country is Andrzej Seweryn, who in the years 1984–1988 was a member of the international group formed by Peter Brook to work on the staging of the Mahabharata, and since 1993 has been linked with the Comédie Française. The most revered actor of the second half of the twentieth century in Poland is generally considered to be Tadeusz Łomnicki, who died in 1992 of a heart attack while rehearsing \"King Lear\".\n\nDuring the second half of the nineties, there appeared in Polish dramatic theatre a new generation of young directors, who have attempted to create productions relevant to the experience and problems of a thirty-something generation brought up surrounded by mass culture, habituated to a fast-moving lifestyle, but at the same time ever more lost in the world of consumer capitalism. The leading theatre in this movement is Warsaw's TR, known as \"the fastest theatre in town\". Among its collaborating directors, Krzysztof Warlikowski and Grzegorz Jarzyna stand out. Warlikowski has gained international recognition with a series of innovative productions of Shakespeare, performed both at Polish theatres (\"The Taming of the Shrew\", \"Hamlet\") and abroad (\"Pericles\" at the Piccolo Teatro in Milan, \"Twelfth Night\" and \"The Tempest\" at the Stadt-Theater in Stuttgart). Looking for a way to present the complex existential situation of contemporary humanity, Jarzyna reaches both for contemporary drama (Witkiewicz's \"Tropical Madness\", Gombrowicz's \"Princess Ivona\", or Frazer's \"Unidentified Human Remains...\") and classic European novels (Dostoyevsky's \"The Idiot\", Mann's \"Doktor Faustus\", directed at the Hebbel Theater in Berlin). Recently, both directors have taken an interest in the work of Sarah Kane, mounting startling productions: \"Cleansed\" (Warlikowski) and \"4.48 Psychosis\" (Jarzyna).\n\nThe true rebirth, following the collapse of the Soviet empire, was experienced by the Ludowy Theatre in Nowa Huta district of Kraków taken over by an actor, director, and politician Jerzy Fedorowicz (1989–2005). Under his management, the theatre won considerable recognition, and numerous awards. It was twice invited to the Edinburgh International Festival: in 1996 with Macbeth directed by Jerzy Stuhr, and in 1997 with Antigona directed by Włodzimierz Nurkowski. Current director is Jacek Strama, an award-winning theatre and film producer.\n\nThe theatrical map of Poland, on which for many years the most important points were Warsaw and Kraków, has undergone numerous changes over the last decade. The most recognized directors in Poland, such as Krzysztof Warlikowski, Grzegorz Jarzyna, Jan Klata, Michal Zadara or Maja Kleczewska work in Warsaw, but also travel to other cities. While it is true to say that the capital's position is safe, there is strong competition for second place between Kraków and Wrocław. Recognised masters (Jerzy Jarocki, Krystian Lupa) and a group of younger directors, with Piotr Cieplak and Paweł Miśkiewicz at the head, collaborate with Wrocław's theatres. Poznań, Gdańsk, and Łódź have similar ambitions. One of the more unanticipated surprises of recent seasons has been the blossoming of theatre in Legnica, a town which, until recent times, was the main Soviet military base in Poland, where the Artistic Director, Jacek Głomb, has been actively searching for new ways to reach the town's inhabitants. So he began putting on shows relating events in the lives of the local citizens, as well as siting classical dramas in surprising arenas (e.g., Shakespeare's \"Coriolanus\" in an old Prussian barracks). Since Pawel Lysak became the Artistic Director of the theatre in Bydgoszcz, this city in central Poland has been able to enjoy top-level theatre as well.\n\nThere is no doubt that the greatest achievements of the 20th-century Polish theatre are thanks to those artists seeking new forms and functions for the theatrical arts. From the very beginning of the great European reform movement, Polish theatre people have undertaken courageous experiments in this area. The Polish stream of reform was characterised by the linking of theatre with metaphysics. The source of this type of search was the work and thinking of the Polish Romantics, with Adam Mickiewicz at the forefront. In his \"Forefathers' Eve\", the most important work in Polish literature, there is a vision of theatre as phenomenon on the border between a show and a ceremony led by an actor. In succeeding years, the most important artists of the Polish stage referred to, and sometimes polemicized with, this vision, developing or modifying it.\nIt was from this root that Stanisław Wyspiański's art arose. Poet, painter, visionary, working at the beginning of the twentieth century he influenced the development of theatre over the course of the following century. His works, born of Romantic and symbolic inspiration, conjoining Catholic, pagan, and classic traditions with the existential and political problems of the new century, has not been completely discovered and understood to this day, forming a vivid and fascinating heritage. It was to this tradition that the originators of Polish monumental theatre, Leon Schiller (Edward Gordon Craig's collaborator), Juliusz Osterwa, and Wilam Horzyca, harked back. Tadeusz Kantor, the avant-garde visual artist who became interested in theatre while trying to find new forms of expression, also alluded to it in his theatrical searches. After years of investigation (attempts to adapt the rules of Tachism and performance art to the needs of the theatre), Kantor created his own model, called the Theatre of Death. In his most famous productions - \"The Dead Class\", \"Wielopole, Wielopole\" or \"I Shall Never Return\" - the artist presented a kind of spiritualist séance, calling pictures, words and sounds deformed by the passing of time. Referring to his memories and experiences, he portrayed a collective memory of the end of the tragic twentieth century - the century of the Holocaust.\n\nThough arising from the same roots, a totally different attempt to renew theatre was undertaken by Jerzy Grotowski. Aiming for the creation of a performance as a selfless act of sacrifice, he carried out the second great reform, after Konstantin Stanisłavski's, of the actor's art, and his book \"Towards a Poor Theatre\" is still one of the most important textbooks in drama schools the world over. The productions put on by Grotowski's Theatre Laboratory, such as \"Acropolis\" (Wyspiański's drama, re-set in a concentration camp), \"The Constant Prince\" (after Calderon-Słowacki) or \"Apocalypsis cum figuris\", are among twentieth-century world theatre's most important achievements, still points of reference for many artists. Among others, Peter Brook, Eugenio Barba, Marketa Kimbrell, Richard Schechner and Andre Gregory have derived inspiration from Grotowski's work. Over the last decade of his life, Grotowski had been investigating the possibility of creating a dramatic structure whose effect would be similar to that of a religious ceremony. After his death (1999), the work was continued by his students, Thomas Richards and Mario Biagini, leading the Workcenter, founded by Grotowski in Pontedera in Italy.\n\nGrotowski's work has also influenced many Polish theatre artistes. Włodzimierz Staniewski, who, after some years of close collaboration with Grotowski, finally rebelled, founded the \"Gardzienice\" Centre for Theatrical Practice in 1977 in a small village near Lublin. Today, 25 years later, this centre is world-famous and Staniewski's method of acting, known as \"theatre ecology,\" has been numbered among the most important of the twentieth century. The most characteristic aspect of \"Gardzienice\" is its treatment of theatre as one of many various cultural activities, including expeditions to areas inhabited by people holding onto folk traditions (e.g., the Eastern parts of Poland, Lemko villages or the Ukrainian Hucul region), and a strong link between art and the environment from which it arises. The productions themselves, unusually intense and filled with music, movement and dramatic singing - recall the fundamental myths of East and West.\n\nFor several years, Staniewski has been particularly interested in Ancient Greece as a source of European culture and spirituality. After Apuleius' \"Metamorphoses\" (performed in Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom and Spain, among other countries) he brought into being, with \"Gardzienice\", a production of Eurypides' \"Elektra\", blazing new trails in his theatrical search. From the ranks of Włodzimierz Staniewski's group have come the founders of many active and uncommonly interesting centres, and not just connected with theatre.\n\nIn Sejny, there is the Borderland Foundation, created by Krzysztof Czyżewski, a one-time Gardzienice collaborator. One of \"Borderland's\" forms of work is theatre (e.g., a production of Szymon Anski's \"Dybbuk\"), and its aim is to raise the consciousness of the inhabitants of the borderlands regarding the unique richness of their cultural tradition, which has for centuries linked Polish, Jewish, Belarusian, Lithuanian, Ukrainian, and even Tatar influences. In common with Czyżewski, the founder of the \"Music of the Eastern Lands\" Foundation, Jan Bernad, also came from Gardzienice, and has devoted himself to gathering and reconstructing the rich multiethnic traditions of the ancient music from the Eastern Borders for years.\n\nDuring the Sixties and Seventies, at the same time as Grotowski's work, the movement of social and politically engaged theatre was also developing in Poland. At first, it was, above all, a rebellious student theatre, later, during the period of martial law, the movement also accepted professionals, who organised productions for the underground Home Theatre. One specific form of political rebellion through theatre was promoted by Wrocław's Orange Alternative, an informal group which organised mass events poking fun at the symbols and ceremonies of officialdom. After the regaining of sovereignty in 1989, this movement weakened, but recently it has been reborn as an anticapitalist and antiwar movement. The most important centre for this kind of activity is Poznań, where, alongside the once famous and still active Theatre of the Eighth Day (the antiglobalist production \"Summit\"), the Travel Agency Theatre operates. One of its most important achievements is the open-air production \"Carmen Funebre\", created under the influence of events in the former Yugoslavia and shown all over the world.\n\nAnother developing stream of theatre in Poland is so-called visual theatre, using pictures above all, and almost completely avoiding the spoken word. Its originator is considered to be Józef Szajna (1922), an artist whose collaboration with theatre began with stage design, went on to direction, and, since the seventies, the creation of theatrical productions employing striking pictures referring to expressionist and surrealist aesthetics. The unique form of Szajna's theatre arose both from his artistic and personal experiences (during WWII he was a concentration camp prisoner). They were based on a vision of a deformed world in which battles are fought over the basic human values, which are constantly under threat. Szajna's most famous productions, also performed abroad, are \"Dante\", \"Cervantes\", and \"Replica\", which directly relate to his traumatic wartime experiences.\n\nCurrently, the leading representative of visual theatre is Leszek Mądzik, the founder of the Visual Stage at the Catholic University of Lublin. He has, for many years, put on productions that are a kind of theatrical meditation, touching on existential and religious topics.\n\nClose to this stream are the strongly theatrical happenings of Jerzy Kalina as well as the theatrical activities of Warsaw's Academy of Movement. Speaking of the borderline between art and theatre, it is also worth recalling that there are still active performance artists in Poland. Polish experimental theatre has been counted among the most interesting in Europe, evidence of which are regular prestigious Fringe First awards from the Edinburgh Festival. In recent years, for example, the Travel Agency, Wierszalin, Kana, Song of the Goat, and Provisorium theatres have been recognised in this way.\n\nDuring recent years in Poland, there has been a boom in musical theatre. Alongside the world-famous composers and singers, Polish directors of opera are rated ever more highly. The most important among this group has, for years, been Ryszard Peryt, collaborating with the Warsaw Chamber Opera (organising the annual Mozart Festival, among others) and the National Opera. His speciality is the production of oratorios, among which the theatrical version of Verdi's \"Requiem\", which has been performed in Moscow's Red Square, stands out. Recent seasons have been a period of great operatic success for the film director Mariusz Treliński, who has aroused the interest of New York's Metropolitan Opera. Critical acclaim has also been enjoyed by the opera stage designs of Andrzej Majewski.\n\nGrowing popularity is also enjoyed by dance theatre. In addition to classical ballet, whose best groups have for years been linked with opera halls, contemporary dance groups have been appearing since the Sixties and Seventies. Among the most important are Poznań's Polish Theatre of Dance, founded by Conrad Drzewiecki and currently led by Ewa Wycichowska, and Wrocław's \"Pantomima\", founded by Henryk Tomaszewski (1919–2001). Since the nineties, both Bytom (Silesian Dance Theatre) and Kraków have become important centres, hosting festivals which attract dancers from all over the world.\n\nInternational festivals are a particular element of Polish theatre life, occasions to allow the artistic achievements of East and West to confront each other. To this end, there are such festivals as \"Contact,\" taking place annually in Toruń, and \"Dialogue,\" organised biannually in autumn in Wrocław, in turn with Kraków's \"Dedications\" (October) and Warsaw's \"Meetings\" (November). Aside from these, the most interesting events are \"Theatrical Confrontations\" in Lublin (October), the open-air \"Malta\" festival in Poznań (June), Kraków's \"Ballet in Spring\" and the Puppet Theatre Biennial in Bielsko-Biała.\n\nOne world-famous person who had links with 20th-century Polish theatre and was Pope John Paul II. His interest in theatre dated back to his secondary school years in Wadowice, where the teenage Karol Wojtyła worked in the school theatre. During the Second World War, he co-founded, with his old teacher Mieczysław Kotlarczyk, the underground Rhapsodic Theatre, a group cultivating the Romantic tradition of live poetry. After the war, as a priest, he supported the group and was also its critic, publishing reviews of its performances. Within his literary work, John Paul II also has written a number of dramas, the best-known of which are \"Our God's Brother\" and \"The Jeweller's Shop\".\n\nThe Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz (Witkacy) Prize is an annual award of the Polish Centre of the International Theatre Institute for the foreign (Board of Polish Centre) and Polish (Critics' Circle) artists, scholars or critics for outstanding achievements in the promotion of Polish theatre throughout the world. The Prize has been given since 1983 on the occasion of the World Theatre Day.\n\nThe candidates are put up every year by the prominent people of Polish culture and the Laureates are chosen by a jury consisted of the Ministry of Culture representative, Raszewski Theatre Institute representative, Board of Polish Centre representatives and by Critics' Circle. Foreign recipient receives the original piece of art of a Polish artist and the invitation to Poland, where the stay is funded by the Ministry. During the visit, the Laureate takes part in series of meetings with Polish theatre environment, organized by the Polish Centre of ITI. The Winner also watches theatre performances and participates in many cultural events. Usually the visit is combined with the international theatre festival in Poland.\n\nSome of foreign recipients: Daniel C. Gerould (1983), Roberto Bacci (1989), Bonnie Marranca (1990), Michelle Kokosowski (1991), Richard Demarco (1992), Hendrik Lindepuu (1997), Jacques Rosner (2002), Allen Kuharski (2006), Ellen Stewart (2008), Monique Stalens (2010), Manfred Beilharz (2013), Philip Arnoult (2014), Darja Dominkuš (2015), Richard Gough (2016).\n\nSome of Polish recipients: Jerzy Jarocki (1984), Tadeusz Kantor (1989), Józef Szajna (1992), Andrzej Seweryn (1996), Krystyna Meissner (1997), Krystian Lupa (2000), Jerzy Radziwiłowicz (2000), Tadeusz Bradecki (2001), Janusz Opryński (2002), Krzysztof Warlikowski (2003), Travel Agency Theatre (2004), Grzegorz Jarzyna (2005), Mariusz Treliński (2006), Ewa Wycichowska (2008), Song of the Goat Theatre (2010), Stefan Sutkowski (2013), Andrzej Wirth (2014), Janina Szarek (2015), Andrzej Szczytko (2016).\n\n"}
{"id": "85248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=85248", "title": "Theatre of the Absurd", "text": "Theatre of the Absurd\n\nThe Theatre of the Absurd ( ) is a post–World War II designation for particular plays of absurdist fiction written by a number of primarily European playwrights in the late 1950s, as well as one for the style of theatre which has evolved from their work. Their work focused largely on the idea of existentialism and expressed what happens when human existence has no meaning or purpose and therefore all communication breaks down. Logical construction and argument gives way to irrational and illogical speech and to its ultimate conclusion, silence.\n\nCritic Martin Esslin coined the term in his 1960 essay \"Theatre of the Absurd\". He related these plays based on a broad theme of the Absurd, similar to the way Albert Camus uses the term in his 1942 essay \"The Myth of Sisyphus\". The Absurd in these plays takes the form of man's reaction to a world apparently without meaning, or man as a puppet controlled or menaced by invisible outside forces. This style of writing was first popularized by the Samuel Beckett play \"Waiting for Godot\" (1953). Although the term is applied to a wide range of plays, some characteristics coincide in many of the plays: broad comedy, often similar to vaudeville, mixed with horrific or tragic images; characters caught in hopeless situations forced to do repetitive or meaningless actions; dialogue full of clichés, wordplay, and nonsense; plots that are cyclical or absurdly expansive; either a parody or dismissal of realism and the concept of the \"well-made play\". These plays were shaped by the political turmoil, scientific breakthrough, and social upheaval going on in the world around the playwrights during these times.\n\nWhile absurdists believed that life is absurd, they also believed that death and the \"after life\" were equally absurd if not more, and that whether people live or not all of their actions are pointless and everything will lead to the same end (hence the repetitiveness in many of these absurdist plays).\n\nIn his book \"Absurd Drama\" (1965), Esslin wrote:... the Theatre of the Absurd attacks the comfortable certainties of religious or political orthodoxy. It aims to shock its audience out of complacency, to bring it face to face with the harsh facts of the human situation as these writers see it. But the challenge behind this message is anything but one of despair. It is a challenge to accept the human condition as it is, in all its mystery and absurdity, and to bear it with dignity, nobly, responsibly; precisely there are no easy solutions to the mysteries of existence, because ultimately man is alone in a meaningless world. The shedding of easy solutions, of comforting illusions, may be painful, but it leaves behind it a sense of freedom and relief. And that is why, in the last resort, the Theatre of the Absurd does not provoke tears of despair but the laughter of liberation.\n\nPlaywrights commonly associated with the Theatre of the Absurd include Samuel Beckett, Eugène Ionesco, Jean Genet, Arthur Adamov, Harold Pinter, Luigi Pirandello, Tom Stoppard, Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Miguel Mihura, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Fernando Arrabal, Václav Havel, Edward Albee, Malay Roy Choudhury, Tadeusz Różewicz, Sławomir Mrożek, N.F. Simpson, and Badal Sarkar.\n\nIn the first edition of \"The Theatre of the Absurd\", Esslin saw the work of these playwrights as giving artistic meaning to Albert Camus's philosophy that life is inherently without meaning, as illustrated in his work \"The Myth of Sisyphus\". In the first (1961) edition, Esslin presented the four defining playwrights of the movement as Samuel Beckett, Arthur Adamov, Eugène Ionesco, and Jean Genet, and in subsequent editions he added a fifth playwright, Harold Pinter—although each of these writers has unique preoccupations and characteristics that go beyond the term \"absurd.\" Other writers associated with this group by Esslin and other critics include Tom Stoppard, Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Fernando Arrabal, Edward Albee, Boris Vian, and Jean Tardieu.\n\nThough the label \"Theatre of the Absurd\" covers a wide variety of playwrights with differing styles, they do have some common stylistic precursors (Esslin [1961]). These precursors include Elizabethan tragicomedy, formal experimentation, pataphysics, surrealism, Dadaism, and most importantly existentialism.\n\nThe mode of most \"absurdist\" plays is tragicomedy. As Nell says in \"Endgame\", \"Nothing is funnier than unhappiness … it's the most comical thing in the world\". Esslin cites William Shakespeare as an influence on this aspect of the \"Absurd drama.\" Shakespeare's influence is acknowledged directly in the titles of Ionesco's \"Macbett\" and Stoppard's \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\". Friedrich Dürrenmatt says in his essay \"Problems of the Theatre\", \"Comedy alone is suitable for us … But the tragic is still possible even if pure tragedy is not. We can achieve the tragic out of comedy. We can bring it forth as a frightening moment, as an abyss that opens suddenly; indeed, many of Shakespeare's tragedies are already really comedies out of which the tragic arises.\"\n\nThough layered with a significant amount of tragedy, the Theatre of the Absurd echoes other great forms of comedic performance, according to Esslin, from Commedia dell'arte to vaudeville. Similarly, Esslin cites early film comedians and music hall artists such as Charlie Chaplin, the Keystone Cops and Buster Keaton as direct influences. (Keaton even starred in Beckett's \"Film\" in 1965.)\n\nAs an experimental form of theatre, many Theatre of the Absurd playwrights employ techniques borrowed from earlier innovators. Writers and techniques frequently mentioned in relation to the Theatre of the Absurd include the 19th-century nonsense poets, such as Lewis Carroll or Edward Lear; Polish playwright Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz; the Russians Daniil Kharms, Nikolai Erdman, and others; Bertolt Brecht's distancing techniques in his \"Epic theatre\"; and the \"dream plays\" of August Strindberg.\n\nOne commonly cited precursor is Luigi Pirandello, especially \"Six Characters in Search of an Author\". Pirandello was a highly regarded theatrical experimentalist who wanted to bring down the fourth wall presupposed by the realism of playwrights such as Henrik Ibsen. According to W. B. Worthen, \"Six Characters\" and other Pirandello plays use \"Metatheatre—roleplaying, plays-within-plays, and a flexible sense of the limits of stage and illusion—to examine a highly-theatricalized vision of identity\".\n\nAnother influential playwright was Guillaume Apollinaire whose \"The Breasts of Tiresias\" was the first work to be called \"surreal\".\n\nOne of the most significant common precursors is Alfred Jarry whose wild, irreverent, and lascivious \"Ubu\" plays scandalized Paris in the 1890s. Likewise, the concept of 'pataphysics—\"the science of imaginary solutions\"—first presented in Jarry's \"Gestes et opinions du docteur Faustroll, pataphysicien\" (\"Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, pataphysician\") was inspirational to many later Absurdists, some of whom joined the Collège de 'pataphysique, founded in honor of Jarry in 1948 (Ionesco, Arrabal, and Vian were given the title Transcendent Satrape of the Collège de 'pataphysique). The Alfred Jarry Theatre, founded by Antonin Artaud and Roger Vitrac, housed several Absurdist plays, including ones by Ionesco and Adamov.\n\nArtaud's \"The Theatre of Cruelty\" (presented in \"The Theatre and Its Double\") was a particularly important philosophical treatise. Artaud claimed theatre's reliance on literature was inadequate and that the true power of theatre was in its visceral impact. Artaud was a Surrealist, and many other members of the Surrealist group were significant influences on the Absurdists.\n\nAbsurdism is also frequently compared to Surrealism's predecessor, Dadaism (for example, the Dadaist plays by Tristan Tzara performed at the Cabaret Voltaire in Zürich). Many of the Absurdists had direct connections with the Dadaists and Surrealists. Ionesco, Adamov, and Arrabal for example, were friends with Surrealists still living in Paris at the time including Paul Eluard and André Breton, the founder of Surrealism, and Beckett translated many Surrealist poems by Breton and others from French into English.\n\nMany of the Absurdists were contemporaries with Jean-Paul Sartre, the philosophical spokesman for existentialism in Paris, but few Absurdists actually committed to Sartre's own existentialist philosophy, as expressed in \"Being and Nothingness\", and many of the Absurdists had a complicated relationship with him. Sartre praised Genet's plays, stating that for Genet, \"Good is only an illusion. Evil is a Nothingness which arises upon the ruins of Good\".\n\nIonesco, however, hated Sartre bitterly. Ionesco accused Sartre of supporting Communism but ignoring the atrocities committed by Communists; he wrote \"Rhinoceros\" as a criticism of blind conformity, whether it be to Nazism or Communism; at the end of the play, one man remains on Earth resisting transformation into a rhinoceros Sartre criticized \"Rhinoceros\" by questioning: \"Why is there one man who resists? At least we could learn why, but no, we learn not even that. He resists because he is there\". Sartre's criticism highlights a primary difference between the Theatre of the Absurd and existentialism: the Theatre of the Absurd shows the failure of man without recommending a solution. In a 1966 interview, Claude Bonnefoy, comparing the Absurdists to Sartre and Camus, said to Ionesco, \"It seems to me that Beckett, Adamov and yourself started out less from philosophical reflections or a return to classical sources, than from first-hand experience and a desire to find a new theatrical expression that would enable you to render this experience in all its acuteness and also its immediacy. If Sartre and Camus thought out these themes, you expressed them in a far more vital contemporary fashion\". Ionesco replied, \"I have the feeling that these writers – who are serious and important – were talking about absurdity and death, but that they never really lived these themes, that they did not feel them within themselves in an almost irrational, visceral way, that all this was not deeply inscribed in their language. With them it was still rhetoric, eloquence. With Adamov and Beckett it really is a very naked reality that is conveyed through the apparent dislocation of language\".\n\nIn comparison to Sartre's concepts of the function of literature, Samuel Beckett's primary focus was on the \"failure\" of man to overcome \"absurdity\" - or the repetition of life even though the end result will be the same no matter what and everything is essentially pointless - as James Knowlson says in \"Damned to Fame\", Beckett's work focuses, \"on poverty, failure, exile and loss — as he put it, on man as a 'non-knower' and as a 'non-can-er' .\" Beckett's own relationship with Sartre was complicated by a mistake made in the publication of one of his stories in Sartre's journal \"Les Temps Modernes\". Beckett said, though he liked \"Nausea\", he generally found the writing style of Sartre and Heidegger to be \"too philosophical\" and he considered himself \"not a philosopher\".\n\nThe \"Absurd\" or \"New Theater\" movement was originally a Paris-based (and a Rive Gauche) avant-garde phenomenon tied to extremely small theaters in the Quartier Latin. Some of the Absurdists, such as Jean Genet, Jean Tardieu, and Boris Vian., were born in France. Many other Absurdists were born elsewhere but lived in France, writing often in French: Samuel Beckett from Ireland; Eugène Ionesco from Romania; Arthur Adamov from Russia; Alejandro Jodorowsky from Chile and Fernando Arrabal from Spain. As the influence of the Absurdists grew, the style spread to other countries—with playwrights either directly influenced by Absurdists in Paris or playwrights labelled Absurdist by critics. In England some of those whom Esslin considered practitioners of the Theatre of the Absurd include Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard, N. F. Simpson, James Saunders, and David Campton; in the United States, Edward Albee, Sam Shepard, Jack Gelber, and John Guare; in Poland, Tadeusz Różewicz, Sławomir Mrożek, and Tadeusz Kantor; in Italy, Dino Buzzati; and in Germany, Peter Weiss, Wolfgang Hildesheimer, and Günter Grass. In India, both Mohit Chattopadhyay and Mahesh Elkunchwar have also been labeled Absurdists. Other international Absurdist playwrights include Tawfiq el-Hakim from Egypt; Hanoch Levin from Israel; Miguel Mihura from Spain; José de Almada Negreiros from Portugal; Mikhail Volokhov from Russia; Yordan Radichkov from Bulgaria; and playwright and former Czech President Václav Havel, and others from the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\n\nEchoes of elements of \"The Theatre of the Absurd\" can be seen in the work of many later playwrights, from more avant-garde or experimental playwrights like Suzan-Lori Parks—in \"The Death of the Last Black Man in the Whole Entire World\" and \"The America Play\", for example—to relatively realistic playwrights like David Mamet—in \"Glengarry Glen Ross\", which Mamet dedicated to Harold Pinter. Irish playwright Martin McDonagh in plays such as \"Pillowman\" addresses some of the themes and uses some of the techniques of Absurdism, especially reminiscent of Beckett and Pinter.\n\nIn addition, the absurd drama has also found its way in Urdu literature, \"Mazaron Ke Phool\" [i.e. Graveyard Flowers] (2008) by contemporary Pakistani writer, poet and columnist Mujtaba Haider Zaidi is the first absurd drama in the history of Urdu literature. Created in the pattern of ancient Greek tragedies, the drama contains only two characters, and carries both poetry and prose in it, and hence fulfills all the requirements necessary for a perfect Absurd drama.\n\nPlays within this group are absurd in that they focus not on logical acts, realistic occurrences, or traditional character development; they, instead, focus on human beings trapped in an incomprehensible world subject to any occurrence, no matter how illogical. The theme of incomprehensibility is coupled with the inadequacy of language to form meaningful human connections. According to Martin Esslin, Absurdism is \"the inevitable devaluation of ideals, purity, and purpose\" Absurdist drama asks its viewer to \"draw his own conclusions, make his own errors\". Though Theatre of the Absurd may be seen as nonsense, they have something to say and can be understood\". Esslin makes a distinction between the dictionary definition of absurd (\"out of harmony\" in the musical sense) and drama's understanding of the Absurd: \"Absurd is that which is devoid of purpose... Cut off from his religious, metaphysical, and transcendental roots, man is lost; all his actions become senseless, absurd, useless\".\n\nThe characters in Absurdist drama are lost and floating in an incomprehensible universe and they abandon rational devices and discursive thought because these approaches are inadequate. Many characters appear as automatons stuck in routines speaking only in cliché (Ionesco called the Old Man and Old Woman in \"The Chairs\" \"uber-marrionettes\"). Characters are frequently stereotypical, archetypal, or flat character types as in Commedia dell'arte.\n\nThe more complex characters are in crisis because the world around them is incomprehensible. Many of Pinter's plays, for example, feature characters trapped in an enclosed space menaced by some force the character can't understand. Pinter's first play was \"The Room\" – in which the main character, Rose, is menaced by Riley who invades her safe space though the actual source of menace remains a mystery – and this theme of characters in a safe space menaced by an outside force is repeated in many of his later works (perhaps most famously in \"The Birthday Party\"). In Friedrich Dürrenmatt's \"The Visit\" the main character, Alfred, is menaced by Claire Zachanassian; Claire, richest woman in the world with a decaying body and multiple husbands throughout the play, has guaranteed a payout for anyone in the town willing to kill Alfred. Characters in Absurdist drama may also face the chaos of a world that science and logic have abandoned. Ionesco's recurring character Berenger, for example, faces a killer without motivation in \"The Killer\", and Berenger's logical arguments fail to convince the killer that killing is wrong. In \"Rhinocéros\", Berenger remains the only human on Earth who hasn’t turned into a rhinoceros and must decide whether or not to conform. Characters may find themselves trapped in a routine, or in a metafictional conceit, trapped in a story; the title characters in Tom Stoppard's \"Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead\", for example, find themselves in a story (\"Hamlet\") in which the outcome has already been written.\n\nThe plots of many Absurdist plays feature characters in interdependent pairs, commonly either two males or a male and a female. Some Beckett scholars call this the \"pseudocouple\". The two characters may be roughly equal or have a begrudging interdependence (like Vladimir and Estragon in \"Waiting for Godot\" or the two main characters in \"Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead\"); one character may be clearly dominant and may torture the passive character (like Pozzo and Lucky in \"Waiting for Godot\" or Hamm and Clov in \"Endgame\"); the relationship of the characters may shift dramatically throughout the play (as in Ionesco's \"The Lesson\" or in many of Albee's plays, \"The Zoo Story\" for example).\n\nDespite its reputation for nonsense language, much of the dialogue in Absurdist plays is naturalistic. The moments when characters resort to nonsense language or clichés—when words appear to have lost their denotative function, thus creating misunderstanding among the characters—make the Theatre of the Absurd distinctive. Language frequently gains a certain phonetic, rhythmical, almost musical quality, opening up a wide range of often comedic playfulness. Jean Tardieu, for example, in the series of short pieces \"Theatre de Chambre\" arranged the language as one arranges music. Distinctively Absurdist language ranges from meaningless clichés to vaudeville-style word play to meaningless nonsense. \"The Bald Soprano\", for example, was inspired by a language book in which characters would exchange empty clichés that never ultimately amounted to true communication or true connection. Likewise, the characters in \"The Bald Soprano\"—like many other Absurdist characters—go through routine dialogue full of clichés without actually communicating anything substantive or making a human connection. In other cases, the dialogue is purposefully elliptical; the language of Absurdist Theater becomes secondary to the poetry of the concrete and objectified images of the stage. Many of Beckett's plays devalue language for the sake of the striking tableau. Harold Pinter—famous for his \"Pinter pause\"—presents more subtly elliptical dialogue; often the primary things characters should address are replaced by ellipsis or dashes. The following exchange between Aston and Davies in \"The Caretaker\" is typical of Pinter:\n\nMuch of the dialogue in Absurdist drama (especially in Beckett's and Albee's plays, for example) reflects this kind of evasiveness and inability to make a connection. When language that is apparently nonsensical appears, it also demonstrates this disconnection. It can be used for comic effect, as in Lucky's long speech in \"Godot\" when Pozzo says Lucky is demonstrating a talent for \"thinking\" as other characters comically attempt to stop him:\n\nNonsense may also be used abusively, as in Pinter's \"The Birthday Party\" when Goldberg and McCann torture Stanley with apparently nonsensical questions and non-sequiturs:\n\nAs in the above examples, nonsense in Absurdist theatre may be also used to demonstrate the limits of language while questioning or parodying the determinism of science and the knowability of truth. In Ionesco's \"The Lesson\", a professor tries to force a pupil to understand his nonsensical philology lesson:\n\nTraditional plot structures are rarely a consideration in The Theatre of the Absurd. Plots can consist of the absurd repetition of cliché and routine, as in \"Godot\" or \"The Bald Soprano\". Often there is a menacing outside force that remains a mystery; in \"The Birthday Party\", for example, Goldberg and McCann confront Stanley, torture him with absurd questions, and drag him off at the end, but it is never revealed why. In later Pinter plays, such as \"The Caretaker\" and \"The Homecoming\", the menace is no longer entering from the outside but exists within the confined space. Other Absurdists use this kind of plot, as in Edward Albee's \"A Delicate Balance\": Harry and Edna take refuge at the home of their friends Agnes and Tobias because they suddenly become frightened. They have difficulty explaining what has frightened them:\n\nAbsence, emptiness, nothingness, and unresolved mysteries are central features in many Absurdist plots: for example, in \"The Chairs\" an old couple welcomes a large number of guests to their home, but these guests are invisible so all we see is empty chairs, a representation of their absence. Likewise, the action of \"Godot\" is centered around the absence of a man named Godot, for whom the characters perpetually wait. In many of Beckett's later plays, most features are stripped away and what's left is a minimalistic tableau: a woman walking slowly back and forth in \"Footfalls\", for example, or in \"Breath\" only a junk heap on stage and the sounds of breathing.\n\nThe plot may also revolve around an unexplained metamorphosis, a supernatural change, or a shift in the laws of physics. For example, in Ionesco's \"Amédée, or How to Get Rid of It\", a couple must deal with a corpse that is steadily growing larger and larger; Ionesco never fully reveals the identity of the corpse, how this person died, or why it's continually growing, but the corpse ultimately – and, again, without explanation – floats away. In Jean Tardieu's \"The Keyhole\" a lover watches a woman through a keyhole as she removes her clothes and then her flesh.\n\nLike Pirandello, many Absurdists use meta-theatrical techniques to explore role fulfillment, fate, and the theatricality of theatre. This is true for many of Genet's plays: for example, in \"The Maids\", two maids pretend to be their mistress; in \"The Balcony\" brothel patrons take on elevated positions in role-playing games, but the line between theatre and reality starts to blur. Another complex example of this is \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead\": it's a play about two minor characters in \"Hamlet\"; these characters, in turn, have various encounters with the players who perform \"The Mousetrap\", the play-within-the-play in \"Hamlet\". In Stoppard's \"Travesties\", James Joyce and Tristan Tzara slip in and out of the plot of \"The Importance of Being Earnest\".\n\nPlots are frequently cyclical: for example, \"Endgame\" begins where the play ended – at the beginning of the play, Clov says, \"Finished, it's finished, nearly finished, it must be nearly finished\" – and themes of cycle, routine, and repetition are explored throughout.\n\n\n\n"}

She began studying at the age of 8 at the National Conservatory with Augusta Rennebaum, a pupil of Franz Liszt. She made her debut at age 15 with the Dresden Philharmonic, then toured the world for four years. She moved to the United States in 1900, first appearing in New York in 1909, with the Russian Symphony Orchestra.\n\nA week after arriving in New York, she met Hermann Irion, an executive of the Steinway Piano company, and married him only four weeks later, on 16 December 1909.\n\nIn the US she played concertos under the baton of Gustav Mahler, Leopold Stokowski and others. She later had a teaching post at her alma mater in Budapest.\n\nHer verve and bravura, but also her wayward approach, were noted. In a review of her concert at New York's Aeolian Hall in January 1919, James Huneker wrote that \"... she transformed Chopin preludes into veritable typhoons\", and \"... in the Barcarolle, instead of gondolas and the vows of lovers, moonlight and soft Adriatic zephyrs, we were shown a huge warship that steamed through the Grand Canal, sirens screaming, cannons booming, and a band playing Hungarian Rhapsody by Liszt.\"\n\nYolanda Mero made a number of piano rolls, of music by Bach, Beethoven, Sergei Bortkiewicz, Cécile Chaminade, Debussy, Dohnányi, Grieg, Handel, Haydn, Liszt, Moszkowski, Mozart, Anton Rubinstein, Schubert, Sinding, Johann Strauss II, Richard Strauss, Tchaikovsky, Max Vogrich and Wagner. She made only one 78rpm recording.\n\nSergei Bortkiewicz dedicated his \"Trois pièces pour piano\", Op. 12, to her.\n\nHer recording of Max Vogrich's \"Staccato-Caprice\" appears on the CD \"Women at the Piano: An Anthology of Historic Performances, Vol. 2\" (1926-1950). and on Welte-Mignon Piano Rolls, Vol. 1 (1905-1927) It is said to display her \"superb finish, beautiful phrasing and exquisite touch\". Her recording of Carl Heymann's \"Elfenspiel, Etude in E major\" appears on Welte-Mignon Piano Rolls, Vol. 3 (1905-1926). Her playing of Franz Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 4 is on , and can also be found on CD.\n\nMme Mero-Irion co-founded the New Opera Company, becoming at that time the world's only female impresario. She chose the repertoire, singers, conductors, artistic and stage directors, ballet masters and coaches. She produced \"The Merry Widow\" on Broadway in 1943, with choreography by George Balanchine and starring Jan Kiepura, David Wayne, Robert Rounseville and others, and Marcel Pagnol's play \"Topaze\", starring Tilly Losch, in 1947.\n\nShe also became an activist in the cause of improving the quality of the content of radio broadcasts, launching attacks on soap operas and advertising. She was founder and chairman of the Women's National Radio Committee and created the Gold Microphone Award.\n\nYolanda Mero-Irion was active in providing support for destitute musicians. She co-founded the Musicians Emergency Fund, along with Olga Samaroff, Lucrezia Bori and the wives of Ernest Schelling and Ernest Hutcheson and was its executive director. She established an endowment with the Musicians Foundation, Inc.\n\nYolanda Mero-Irion lived with her husband on their estate in Rockland County, NY. She later lived at 983 Park Avenue, New York. She died on 17 October 1963, in Lenox Hill Hospital, aged 76.\n"}
