{"id": "884209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=884209", "title": "99 Luftballons", "text": "99 Luftballons\n\n\"99 Luftballons\" (, \"99 balloons\") is a song by the German band Nena from their 1983 self-titled album. An English-language version titled \"99 Red Balloons\", with lyrics by Kevin McAlea, was also released on the album \"99 Luftballons\" in 1984 after widespread success of the original in Europe and Japan. The English version is not a direct translation of the German original and contains somewhat different lyrics.\n\nWhile at a June 1982 concert by the Rolling Stones in West Berlin, Nena's guitarist Carlo Karges noticed that balloons were being released. As he watched them move toward the horizon, he noticed them shifting and changing shapes, where they looked like strange spacecraft (referred to in the German lyrics as a \"UFO\"). He thought about what might happen if they floated over the Berlin Wall to the Soviet sector.\n\nAlso cited by the band was a newspaper article from the \"Las Vegas Review-Journal\" about five local high school students in 1973 who played a prank to simulate a UFO by launching 99 (one was lost from the original 100) aluminized Mylar balloons attached with ribbons to a traffic flare. The red flame from the flare reflected by the balloons gave the appearance of a large pulsating red object floating over Red Rock Canyon outside the Las Vegas Valley in Nevada.\n\nA direct translation of the title is sometimes given as \"Ninety-Nine Air Balloons\", but the song became known in English as \"Ninety-Nine Red Balloons\". The title \"99 Red Balloons\" almost scans correctly with the syllables falling in the right places within the rhythm of the first line of lyrics, although \"Neunundneunzig\" (99) has one syllable more than \"ninety-nine\".\n\nThe lyrics of the original German version tell a story: 99 balloons are mistaken for UFOs, causing a general to send pilots to investigate. Finding nothing but children's balloons, the pilots decide to put on a show and shoot them down. The display of force worries the nations along the borders and the defence ministers on each side bang the drums of conflict to grab power for themselves. In the end, a 99-year war results from the otherwise harmless flight of balloons, causing devastation on all sides without a victor. At the end, the singer walks through the devastated ruins and lets loose a balloon, watching it fly away.\n\nThe English version retains the spirit of the original narrative, but many of the lyrics are translated poetically rather than directly translated: red helium balloons are casually released by the civilian singer (narrator) with her unnamed friend into the sky and are registered as missiles by a faulty early warning system; the balloons are mistaken for military aircraft which results in panic and eventually nuclear war.\n\nFrom the outset Nena and other members of the band expressed disapproval for the English version of the song, \"99 Red Balloons\". In March 1984, the band's keyboardist and song co-writer Uwe Fahrenkrog Petersen said, \"We made a mistake there. I think the song loses something in translation and even sounds silly.\" In another interview that month the band including Nena herself were quoted as being \"not completely satisfied\" with the English version since it was \"too blatant\" for a group not wishing to be seen as a protest band. Despite having given in excess of 500 concerts over a period of more than 30 years, Nena has never sung \"99 Red Balloons\" live, even at her rare concerts in England, always performing the German version instead.\n\nThere have been two re-recordings of the original German version of the song that have been released by Nena: a modern version in 2002, which was included on \"Nena feat. Nena\" (2002), and a retro version in 2009, which included some verses in French.\n\nLive recordings of the song are included on all seven of Nena's live albums, dating from 1995 to 2018.\n\nA special edit that combined the English and German versions of the song was played on American Top 40 with Casey Kasem for the week of 24 March 1984 (Program #814-12).\n\nAmerican and Australian audiences preferred the original German version, which became a very successful non-English-language song, topping charts in both countries, reaching on the \"Cash Box\" chart, Kent Music Report, and on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, behind \"Jump\" by Van Halen. It was certified Gold by the RIAA. The later-released English translation, \"99 Red Balloons\", topped the charts in the UK, Canada and Ireland.\n\nVH1 Classic, an American cable television station, ran a charity event for Hurricane Katrina relief in 2006. Viewers who made donations were allowed to choose which music videos the station would play. One viewer donated $35,000 for the right to program an entire hour and requested continuous play of \"99 Luftballons\" and \"99 Red Balloons\" videos. The station broadcast the videos as requested from 2:00 to 3:00 pm EST on 26 March 2006.\n\nIn his 2010 book \"\", critic and musician Scott Miller declared that the song possesses \"one of the best hooks of the eighties\" and listed it among his top song picks for 1984. Nonetheless, he cautioned: \"It must be admitted that this song suffers from an embarrassingly out-of-place disco funk interlude, and the word \"kriegsminister\".\"\n\nThe promotional video, which was originally made for the Dutch music programme \"TopPop\" and broadcast on 13 March 1983, was shot in a Dutch military training camp, the band performing the song on a stage in front of a backdrop of fires and explosions provided by the Dutch Army. Towards the end of the video, the band are seen taking cover and abandoning the stage, which was unplanned and genuine since they believed the explosive blasts were getting out of control.\n\nIn 2006, the video was used for a $200,000 fundraising campaign for Hurricane Katrina relief efforts. VH1 Classic played the English and German versions for an hour straight as part of Mercy Corps' campaign.\n\n\n"}

It is based on the lives of Slovo's parents, Ruth First and Joe Slovo. The film was a co-production between companies from the UK and Zimbabwe, where the movie was filmed. It features Hans Zimmer's first non-collaborative film score.\n\nSet in Johannesburg in 1963, the film examines the abrupt ending of 13-year-old Molly's blithe childhood when her father, a member of the South African Communist Party, flees into exile. Ostracised by her peers, Molly draws closer to her mother who is part of the campaign against apartheid. Their relationship is challenged by hardship, political intimidation, and the mother's eventual arrest.\n\nThe film title references both the gap between the mother and her teenage girl, who fails to grasp why their family is so fixated with events beyond their comfortable white suburb, and another separating this world from that of South Africa's poverty-stricken black townships. \n\nEssentially, the film is a tribute to Ruth First by her daughter and concludes in a moment of epiphany as Molly comes to terms with her mother's activism and understands that she too must play a part in the struggle against racial injustice.\n\n\n\"A World Apart\" has an overall approval rating of 89% on Rotten Tomatoes from 9 critics.\n\n\n"}

A notable example is the former Archbishop of Manila, Jaime Sin who in 1976 was made a cardinal by Pope Paul VI, thus becoming known as \"Cardinal Sin\".\n\n\n"}

A \"rockumentary,\" advertised as \"\"Not the Beatles, but an incredible simulation\",\" it ran from 1977 to 1979 for a total of 1,006 performances.\n\n\"Beatlemania\" took the form of a roughly chronological history of The Beatles via their music. About 50 songs were performed during the show. Other than some onstage banter, there was very little dialogue during the production, which consisted mostly of exact re-enactments of the Beatles' music. The multimedia production was notable for its extensive use of backdrops, slides, newspaper headlines, and video footage to evoke the 1960s and iconic Beatle moments.\n\nBeatles tribute bands predated \"Beatlemania\" ‚Äî notably (which debuted in 1975) ‚Äî but \"Beatlemania\" was the first production to create a full multimedia theatrical experience.\n\nOriginally conceived and produced by Steve Leber and David Krebs, \"Beatlemania\" debuted in Boston at the Colonial Theatre in April 1977. It premiered on Broadway at the Winter Garden Theatre on May 31, 1977 (after previewing since May 26 ‚Äî although no critics were invited), with cast members Joe Pecorino (\"John\"), Mitch Weissman (\"Paul\"), Les Fradkin (\"George\"), and Justin McNeill (\"Ringo\").\n\nQuickly achieving sellout status without ever having an official \"opening night\", \"Beatlemania\" saw great success and coverage in \"Time\", \"People\", \"Us\", \"Newsweek\", and \"Rolling Stone\". For the first six months, every ticket for the show was sold out.\n\nThe production was nominated for the 1978 Tony Award for Best Lighting Design by designer Jules Fisher, while the sound engineer was longtime industry veteran William (Bill) Rofot. Season 3 of \"Saturday Night Live\"'s \"Weekend Update\" (airing March 15, 1978) parodied the show when Dan Aykroyd mentioned \"\"Beatlemaniamania\": not \"Beatlemania\", but an incredible simulation.\"\n\n\"Beatlemania\" ran until October 17, 1979, for a total of 1006 performances; grossing more than $40 million. During its New York run, the show moved to the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre and finally the Palace Theatre. \n\nAs the show expanded in its formative years, over 50 original cast members formed 10 \"bunks\" (or casts of a single set of four). As the New York show continued its run, shows were opened in Los Angeles, Chicago, Cincinnati, and London. At its peak, \"Beatlemania\" had several permanent shows in several cities around the world and several semi-temporary shows in many more cities in the U.S. and the rest of the world. \n\nAfter closing on Broadway, the \"Beatlemania Bus and Truck Tour\" began, running until 1983 and touring across the United States and worldwide. Short-term tours of Australia, Europe, Asia, and Africa were produced after 1982.\n\nAn updated show, \"With the Beatles\", was created as a tribute to the musical in 1983.\n\nThe 1986 decision in a lawsuit by the Beatles production company Apple Corps officially ended the show for a period of time, but revival tours still continue today, under such names as \"Beatlemania: Yesterday and Today\" and \"Beatlemania Now\".\n\nIn 1978, \"Beatlemania\" released a self-titled original cast album of the show which included contributions from the first and second cast of performers from the show (as well as five additional off-stage musicians ‚Äî keyboards; violin; cello; sax/flute/recorder; trumpet/picollo trumpet and oboe). Released on Arista Records in 1978, the album received warm audience reaction, even placing on the \"Billboard\" 200 for several weeks, before falling into obscurity. \n\nTracks from the album included most but not all of the original show's song list, and several of the tracks were either re-recorded entirely or partially re-recorded in the studio. Cast members that appear on the album include Mitch Weissman, Joe Pecorino, Les Fradkin, Justin McNeill, Randy Clark, Reed Kailing, P. M. Howard, and Bobby Taylor.\n\nAfter three years of production USA Video Productions took an interest in making a film version of the \"Beatlemania\" stage show. After a brief contract negotiation, \"Beatlemania: The Movie\" began production in late 1980 (shortly before the murder of John Lennon). Directed by Joseph Manduke, the film's cast featured Mitch Weissman (bass guitar; \"Paul\"), David Leon (rhythm guitar; \"John\"), Tom Teeley (lead guitar; \"George\"), and Ralph Castelli (drums; \"Ringo\").\n\n\"Beatlemania: The Movie\" was released in the summer of 1981 and received negative reviews. Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\", \"\"Beatlemania\" was a horror on the stage, and it's even more of a horror at close range, where the seams really show. This isn't a loving impersonation, or even an honest one. It's cheap, disingenuous and loathsome.\" Jonathan Rosenbaum of the \"Chicago Reader\" wrote, \"My idea of hell is being forced at gunpoint to resee this ... atrocity, ... based on a terrible stage musical.\" Other observers criticized the film for being too artsy and not worthy of being associated with the stageshow; plans for a follow-up film were immediately cancelled.\n\nIn 1979, Apple Corps sued show creator Steve Leber and \"Beatlemania\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s producers, alleging that Apple Corps owned various publicity rights and trademarks, and Leber and others \"appropriated to themselves\" the value of those trademarks and the Beatles' goodwill and fame without paying for it. In 1986, Los Angeles Superior Court judge Paul Breckenridge found in favor of Apple Corps, and ordered Leber and Beatlemania Inc. to pay Apple $5.6 million, plus 7% interest from September 1979. He also found that Apple was entitled to a court order barring the further unconsented use or exploitation of the Beatles, and that Beatlemania's actions \"amounted to virtually a complete appropriation of the Beatles' persona\" without their consent.\nThe judge also found that Ely Landau and the This Is The Week That Was Beatlemania Company, which produced the \"Beatlemania\" film, were liable $2 million and 7% interest, also payable to Apple Corps.\n\nThe musical numbers in the show, based on the Broadway opening, were:\n\nBecause of the vocal strain (especially for \"Paul\") involved in doing 10 or more shows per week, each production utilized two (2) casts or \"bunks,\" as they were dubbed by musical director Sandy Yaguda. The Original Broadway production featured Bunk 1 (Mitch Weissman, Joe Pecorino, Les Fradkin and Justin McNeill). and Bunk 2 (Randy Clark, Reed Kailing, P.M. Howard, and Bobby Taylor). Subsequent cast members of the Leber-Krebs production are known as \"Original\" cast members, as the show expanded with several touring casts. \n\nCasts and casting became independent after 1984 as revival and current casts tour under many different Beatle-related nomenclatures.

In Europe, the game was released by Mindscape as TV Sports: Baseball, part of the \"TV Sports\" series that included \"\" and other games based on hockey and American football.\n\nAn option allows the player to play anywhere from five to nine innings. Players can choose to throw five different kinds of pitches either slowly, at a normal speed, or very rapidly. Nintendo Power gave this game a 2.8 out of 5 in their September 1991 review while Electronic Gaming Monthly issued a 4.25 out of 10 review in their October 1991 issue of their magazine.\n\nPlayers can either play in exhibition mode or playoff mode. Either one or two players can participate. In addition to those options, a \"CPU vs CPU\" mode and a \"CPU vs CPU quick mode\" are available in order to quicken up a tournament; the purpose is to see the stats of that particular match and quickly end tournaments. The game uses city names but not the team names because of not having any proper licensing with Major League Baseball. However, the players are purely fictional and they cannot be edited. Some of the player names are parodies of real life baseball players (such as Baltimore's \"Kenrip\" being a not-so-subtle parody of Cal Ripken).\n\nThere is even a cheat code that allows players to play as an all-Bo Jackson baseball team.

As a result of his visit, experimentation with electronic music gained support from the scientific community and an electronic music laboratory was established.\n\nIn 1959, Jose Visencio Asuar published a thesis entitled \"Generaci√≥n mec√°nica y electr√≥nica del sonido musical\" (Mechanical and Electronic Generation of Musical Sound), and to demonstrate his thesis he composed \"Variaciones espectrales\" (Spectral Variations), the first piece of electronic music in Chile.\n\nIn 1966, at the Universidad Cat√≥lica, Samuel Claro released his second electronic music album, \"Estudio N¬∞1\".\n\nAsuar released \"Estudio Aletorio\" in 1962 and \"Ambientes Sonoros\" in 1967. Both records were released in Germany (Karlsruhe) and Venezuela (Caracas).\n\nIn 1968, Tom√°s Lefever composed 19 electronic tracks and released \"Klesis\", a compilation album containing works by Amen√°bar and Asuar. \n\nIt is not clear when exactly the electronic music movement as it is known today reached Chile. At the beginning of the 1990s a small underground movement had emerged, with DJs such as Cristian Vogel, Ricardo Villalobos, Mat√≠as Aguayo and Sergio Orrego, the opening of the specialist store Background, and small scale events like ‚ÄúBarracudas‚Äù in 1992, ‚ÄúCorriente Alterna‚Äù (1993), ‚ÄúDistrito Distinto‚Äù (1993), ‚ÄúBackground‚Äù (1994), ‚ÄúAvanzada multimedia‚Äù (1994), ‚ÄúFrontera Final‚Äù (1995) and ‚ÄúSpandex Parties‚Äù taking place through the 1990s. However, most commentators see the true birth of electronica in Chile at the Alacran Peninsula in the city of Arica, in an event that took place during the solar eclipse of November 1994.\n\nThe solar eclipse took place on November 3, 1994, with excellent views available in northern Chilean cities such as Arica, drawing astronomers from around the world to observe the rare phenomenon in the area‚Äôs uniquely clear skies. A group of electronica fans and DJs decided to use the eerie eclipse landscape as a backdrop to host Chile's first rave. The event was sponsored by the German clothing manufacturer Pash and took place outdoors in the Scorpion Peninsula, opposite to the historic Morro de Arica. Ravers could observe the eclipse and wait for its shadow to pass, with electronic music as a soundtrack. DJs who took part in the rave included John Acquaviva, Richie Hawtin, Ricardo Villalobos, Derrick May, Pascal, Siddhartha and Adrian.\n\nThough it was a small event, the Alacran rave has gained near legendary status in Chile and has become a landmark in the country's electronic scene. Since then, the scene has grown fast and massive events have taken place in many of Chile's major cities, including ‚ÄúC[C2] reamfields‚Äù, ‚ÄúSensation White‚Äù (a spin-off from Amsterdam‚Äôs ‚ÄúSensation‚Äù), and Ultra Music, an event that first appeared in Miami.\n\nIn the last decade, techno and house music, mostly inspired by the movement in Berlin, has grown in Santiago. These underground scene has been recorded by labels like Comeme and Pirotecnia with stars from the scene like Alejandro Paz and Mamacita. \n\nThe International Society for Chilean Music (SIMUC) has a podcast called \"MEC\" dedicated exclusively to Chilean electronic music.

It is the 5th arcade release in Europe, the 3rd arcade release in North America, and the 9th arcade release in Japan.\n\n\"SuperNova\" reintroduces characters, after their absence from \"DDRMAX\" games and \"Dance Dance Revolution Extreme\". In \"SuperNova\", character selection is random by default, but can be changed in the options menu.

The reader was depicted in arcade flyers, but it was never released. This feature already existed in \"Dance Dance Revolution Extreme\" and several earlier releases, but used original PlayStation memory cards and readers instead, which \"SuperNova\" does not support. Supplier issues with Sony forced Konami to cancel the functionality. To compensate, Konami offered a coupon or soundtrack sampler for customers in North America who purchased the game in 2006.\n\nThe game was released in North America on May 15, 2006, with the first confirmed sighting at Disneyland in Anaheim, California at the Tomorrowland Starcade. Its release in Japan was delayed slightly so that the game software could be updated to fix the reported timing issues, and was later released with an extra song (the aforementioned remix of Flow) in late July 2006.\n\nThe arcade release of \"SuperNova\" contains 304 songs, of which 120 are all-new additions to the game.

In North America, a slightly different PlayStation 2 version was released first on September 25, 2007 before that region's arcade release on January 17, 2008. It is the final arcade release to be powered by the PlayStation 2 by means of the Python 2 arcade board.\n\nSuperNova 2 features the standard gameplay modes as well as new modes to challenge seasoned players. The soundtrack ranges from classic Konami Originals to new pop and dance standards. The console version in North America features songs by Justin Timberlake, Gwen Stefani, Ian Van Dahl and Goldfrapp. Also featured is EyeToy support for additional gameplay elements as well as mini-games using the camera and online play through the PlayStation Network allowing players to face-off with other players across the country. The game was well received as a solid addition to the DDR lineup.\n\nThe original \"Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova\" arcade release in North America reached sales of about 250 brand new cabinets by distributor Betson. Conversion kits were also available, upgrading a machine with \"Dance Dance Revolution Extreme\" or older to SuperNova. As of October 2018, there are 337 \"SuperNova\" and \"SuperNova 2\" arcade machines available worldwide, of which 253 are located in the Americas.\n\nIn North America, Konami partnered with Betson to distribute \"SuperNova\" and \"SuperNova 2\" to arcades. The partnership resulted in \"lower quality footpads and monitors\" compared to Japan, though still of better quality than the infamous \"Dance Dance Revolution X\" and \"X2\" arcade releases in North America and Europe.\n\nThe PlayStation 2 release of \"SuperNova\" and \"SuperNova 2\" received mixed reviews.

The name refers to Donald Duck and was first used by author Jon Gisle in his book \"Donaldismen\" in 1973.\n\nIn some (especially European) countries, donaldism is mainly centred on comics and comic strips, while in other countries, e.g. the US, these are largely neglected while motion pictures and shorts are relatively much more popular. Originally the term, as defined by Gisle, referred to a \"Research branch as well as the material that is the object this research. In the latter meaning, the word denotes every Disney signed comic story. In the former meaning, donaldism is a branch of comics research, specialising in the study of precisely Disney's production.\" While this original meaning of the word was defined in 1973, today donaldism tends to also cover general fandom within Disney comics and even motion pictures and shorts.\n\nAlthough the term refers directly to the \"Duck universe\", it includes other Disney universes.\n\nA donaldist is a supporter of donaldism: a fan or researcher of Disney comics.\n\nAccording to the 1977 manifest of Norwegian donaldist society \"Donaldistene\", \"donaldists are Donald Duck fans who study \"Donald Duck & Co\" [Norwegian Disney comic book, editor] from social and political structures and viewpoints. Moreover, they try in the best possible way to preserve donaldistic cultural material for their own and others' collections.\"\n\nPart of Donaldist culture is to create backronyms for names and titles; this usage stems from Carl Barks's Junior Woodchucks comics, where the scout leaders generally had long and pompous titles, leading to jocular acronyms.\n\nThe term Donaldist has been used in authorized Disney publications: the collector-themed Gemstone Publishing album series \"Walt Disney Treasures\" was advertised with the slogan/question, \"Are You a Donaldist?\"\n\nOne of the first, important discoveries was in 1960 when U.S. American fan John Spicer wrote the first fan letter to Carl Barks, to which Barks replied. Until then, Walt Disney was thought to have drawn and written all comics himself, although fans suspected otherwise. It was later discovered that Disney himself had only been involved in the production of a handful of comics.\n\nIn 1973 Jon Gisle published the Donald Duck analysis \"Donaldismen. En muntert-vitenskapelig studie over Donald Duck og hans verden\".\n\nDonaldistic research is still being performed, although generally at a lower frequency than in the 1970s and '80s. Research results today are typically presented in fanzines or in Internet websites.\n\nAlthough Gisle's book was translated into Danish with the title \"Andeologien\" (\"The Donald / Duck -ology\"), after Donald's Danish name \"Anders And\", currently the Norwegian/international term \"donaldism\" is the most commonly used.\n\nIn Denmark, one of the main sources for donaldistic research and other donaldistic articles is \"Carl Barks & Co.\", with Freddy Milton as editor and main driving force. The first issue was published in 1974, and the fanzine continued until 2000 at a varied frequency; sometimes several issues per year, sometimes years passed without an issue. The fanzine presented much donaldistic research, including a large index of Danish Disney comic books (which is now maintained by the Inducks project and the original authors). Despite its name, the fanzine contained material on various fields within Disney comics, but still with an overweight on material about Carl Barks, the passing of whom unleashed the discontinuation of the fanzine.\n\nIn 2001 a Danish donaldistic society (\"Dansk Donaldist-Forening\" in Danish) was formed by a group of Danish donaldists and the following year the first issue of their fanzine \"DDF(R)appet\" was published. DDF(R)appet has a publication frequency of approximately two issues per year, and among its articles are a few research presentations.\n\nOther notable (comics) fanzines which are not donaldistic as such but still carry donaldistic material from time to time are: \"N√∏rd-nyt\", \"Rackham\", \"Seriejournalen\", and \"Strip!\".\n\n\n\"D.O.N.A.L.D.\" (\"Deutsche Organisation nichtkommerzieller Anh√§nger des lauteren Donaldismus\" or the German Organization of Non-commercial Devotees of Pure Donaldism) is the donaldistic society of Germany. Founded by Hans von Storch, it has presented many contributions to donaldistic research through its fanzine \"Der Donaldist\". It also holds several meetings and one congress each year.\n\nDonaldists have risen in rank and are actively infiltrating the culture pages of several important newspapers in Germany, such as the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, where they subtly install quotations easily recognisable to fans of the comics. The German study of Donaldism is decisively influenced by the German translations of Barks's comic books by Erika Fuchs.\n\nThey were also influential when the \"Museum for Comic and Language-Art\", called \"Erika-Fuchs-Haus\" was opened in Schwarzenbach an der Saale, Fuchs' main living place, in 2015.\n\nIn the homeland of donaldism, Norway, the fanzine \"Donaldisten\" (\"The Donaldist\") has been published since 1973. The donaldistic society \"Gammeldonaldismens Venner\" (\"Friends of the Early Donaldism\"), founded 1975, issued \"Donaldisten\" in the years 1975-88. Focusing on Jon Gisle's definition of donaldism, the issues contain many research results.\n\nIn 1995 publication of Donaldisten was continued by a new society, \"Donaldistene\" (\"The Donaldists\"), but after only one issue, a nine-year time span passed until another issue was published in 2004. The new society focuses less on research, mirroring a general change among donaldists. Mid 2007, Donaldistene still have only published two issues of Donaldisten, though.\n\nMarch 2007 a new Norwegian fanzine about donaldism entitled \"Kvakk!\" (\"Quack!\") was announced, which will bring articles, interviews, and reviews. Behind the fanzine are the same persons who also maintain Norway's most popular website on Disney comics, \"Andeby Online\" (\"Duckburg Online\"). The first issue will be out in the summer of 2007, and after that there will be four issues released every year.\n\n\nSweden has a long tradition of publishing donaldistic research and other articles in their fanzine \"NAFS\" since 1977. The fanzine is published once or twice a year by the Swedish donaldistic society, \"NAFS\" (\"Nationella Ankistf√∂rbundet i Sverige (kvack))\" or \"The Swedish National Donaldism Society (quack)\"), founded on September 21, 1976. The local name for Donaldism is \"ankism\" (lit. \"duckism\"). Donald Duck's name in Sweden is \"Kalle Anka\" (loosely translated as \"Charlie Duck\").\n\n\nBuffy studies\n\n"}

An international co-production between the United States and China, the film was released in China in March 2018 with an intended North American theatrical release date of April 2018; it was quietly pulled from the schedule and was made available on Netflix on July 20, 2018.\n\nPeng is a carefree goose whose flock is migrating in China. His attitude and demeanor is disapproved by leader Bing, who he and his flock abandon while Peng is asleep. Meanwhile, Chi and Chao, a pair of ducklings on their way to a mystical place called Pleasant Valley, ends up being separated from their flock due to a careless stunt from Peng. To hide from a sinister cat named Banzou, they end up sleeping with Peng after they see him fending off Banzou. Surprised by their presence, Peng ends up recklessly flying away from them before he breaks his wing with a gong. Flightless and frightened, Peng decides to use the ducklings to fend himself off from predators, and return safely to his flock. The ducklings reluctantly agree to go with him.\n\nAfter a series of misadventures, Peng starts to grow on the ducklings, however, before he agrees to help the ducklings reunite with their flock, he comes across his own flock, where Chi and Chao discover his true intentions. The two groups end up parting their own separate ways, as they try to get to their destinations. Peng attempts to fly one more time, but is soon knocked down by hermit squirrel Carl. Carl builds Peng a makeshift wing for him. Inspired, Peng decides to use the wing to head back to Chi and Chao. However, when the ducklings reunite with their flock, they soon realize that Pleasant Valley is actually a restaurant that serves ducklings. Peng rescues Chi and Chao, however, during their escape, they get separated again. Banzou returns and holds the ducklings hostage, Peng confronts Banzou, but becomes badly injured from fighting him. Chi and Chao light a rocket and launches him into the sky.\n\nWeakened, Peng tries to bring Chi and Chou back with his flock, but a snow storm makes him worse. The ducklings fly him towards the spring where the geese are, and Chao, remembering a honk Peng taught him calls for Peng's girlfriend Jingjing, who ultimately ends up rescuing him. The geese welcome the ducks to their flock, and Bing allows the ducks in the flock, having proven wrong of his judgment towards Peng. Peng introduces Jingjing to Chi and Chao, and tells her that might end up having more children.\n\nIn a mid credits scene, Larry, a turtle, makes his way to valley, only to find everyone gone.\n\n\nThe film was released in China on March 9, 2018. There, it would go on to gross $5,865,892 by the end of April. In other territories, it earned $9,434,082 for a worldwide total of $15,299,974.\n\nIt was originally intended to be theatrically released in the United States by Open Road Films on April 20, 2018 before being removed from the release schedule, and ultimately ending up as a Netflix original film, with a projected release of July 20.\n\n"}
{"id": "215107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=215107", "title": "Experience point", "text": "Experience point\n\nAn experience point (often abbreviated to exp or XP) is a unit of measurement used in tabletop role-playing games (RPGs) and role-playing video games to quantify a player character's progression through the game. Experience points are generally awarded for the completion of missions, overcoming obstacles and opponents, and for successful role-playing.\n\nIn many RPGs, characters start as fairly weak and untrained. When a sufficient amount of experience is obtained, the character \"levels up\", achieving the next stage of character development. Such an event usually increases the character's statistics, such as maximum health, magic and strength, and may permit the character to acquire abilities or improve existing ones. Leveling up may also give the character access to more areas or items.\n\nIn some role-playing games, particularly those derived from \"Dungeons & Dragons\", experience points are used to improve characters in discrete experience levels; in other games, such as \"GURPS\" and the \"World of Darkness\" games, experience points are spent on specific abilities or attributes chosen by the player.\n\nIn most games, as the difficulty of the challenge increases, the experience rewarded for overcoming it also increases. As players gain more experience points, the amount of experience needed to gain abilities typically increases. Alternatively, games keep the amount of experience points per level constant, but progressively lower the experience gained for the same tasks as the character's level increases. Thus, as the player character strengthens from gaining experience, they are encouraged to accept tasks that are commensurate with their improved abilities in order to advance.\n\nIn games derived from \"Dungeons & Dragons\" (\"D&D\"), an accumulation of a sufficient number of experience points (XP) increases a character's \"level\", a number that represents a character's overall skill and experience. To \"level\" or \"level up\" means to gain enough XP to reach the next level. By gaining a level, a character's abilities or stats will increase, making the character stronger and able to accomplish more difficult tasks, including safely battling stronger enemies, gaining access to more powerful abilities (such as spells or combat techniques), and to make, fix or disable more complex mechanical devices, or resolve increasingly difficult social challenges.\n\nTypically levels are associated with a character class, and many systems will allow combinations of classes, allowing a player to customize how their character develops.\n\nSome systems that use a level-based experience system also incorporate the ability to purchase specific traits with a set amount of experience; for example, \"D&D\" 3rd Edition bases the creation of magical items around a system of experience expenditure (known as \"burning xp\") and also uses a system of feat selection which closely matches the advantages of systems such as \"GURPS\" or the \"Hero System\". The d20 System also introduced the concept of prestige classes which bundle sets of mechanics, character development and requirements into a package which can be \"leveled\" like an ordinary class.\n\nSome games have a level cap, or a limit of levels available. For example, in the online game \"RuneScape\", no player can currently get higher than level 120 which needs a combined 104,273,167 experience points to gain, nor can any one skill gain more than 200 million experience. Some games have a dynamic level cap, where the level cap is dependent upon the levels of the average player (so it gradually increases).\n\nIn some systems, such as the classic tabletop role-playing games \"Traveller\", \"Call of Cthulhu\" and \"Basic Role-Playing\", and the role-playing video games \"Final Fantasy II\", \"The Elder Scrolls\", and the \"SaGa\" and \"Grandia\" series progression is based on increasing individual statistics (skills, rank and other features) of the character, and is not driven by the acquisition of (general) experience points. The skills and attributes are made to grow through exercised use. Some authors believe that activity-based progression encourages tedious grinding processes, like intentionally taking damage and attacking allied characters to increase health in Final Fantasy II, or forcing player to jump constantly to increase acrobatics skill in The Elder Scrolls series.\n\nFree-form advancement is used by many role-playing systems including \"GURPS\", \"Hero System\" or the \"World of Darkness\" series. It allows the player to select which skills to advance by allocating \"points\". Each character attribute is assigned a price to improve, so for example it might cost a character 2 points to raise an archery skill one notch, 10 points to raise overall dexterity by one, or it might cost 20 points to learn a new magic spell.\n\nPlayers are typically free to spend points however they choose, which greatly increases the control that a player has over the character's development, but also usually causes players to find that complexity increases as well. Some games therefore simplify character creation and advancement by suggesting \"packages\" or \"templates\" of pre-selected ability sets, so for example a player could have their character become an \"investigator\" by purchasing a package deal which includes many skills and abilities, rather than buying them each separately.\n\nA cash-in experience advancement system uses experience points to \"purchase\" such character advancements as class levels, skill points, new skills, feats or increasing saving throw bonuses or base attribute points each of which has a set cost in experience points with set limits on the maximum bonuses that can be purchased at a given time usually once per game session. Once experience points are used thus they are \"spent\" and are erased from the character record or marked as spent and cannot be used again. \"Final Fantasy XIII\" and \"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay\" are examples of games that use a cash-in advancement system.\n\nSome games use advancement systems which combine elements from two or more of the above types. For example, in the third edition of \"Dungeons & Dragons\", whenever a level is gained in a character class, it provides a number of skill points (the exact number is calculated based on the class and the character's intelligence statistic), which can be spent to raise various skills. Character level (generally the sum of a character's total levels in all classes) is used to calculate how high skills can be raised, when an ability score can be raised and when a character can gain new feats (a class of special abilities which include special attacks, proficiencies in various weapons and bonuses on the dice rolls used to determine the outcome of various actions) and how many experience points are needed to advance in level. In \"Ragnarok Online\", experience points are divided into two categories: base experience and job experience. Gaining base experience increases a character's base level, which is used to calculate a character's maximum HP and SP, increasing base level also provides points which can be spent to increase stats such as strength, agility and intelligence. Gaining job experience increases a character's job level, each job level provides a skill point which can be spent in the job's skill tree to gain a new ability, such as a spell, special attack or passive bonus, or improve an existing ability.\n\nSince many early role-playing video games are derived from \"Dungeons & Dragons\", most use a level-based experience system.\n\nIn many games, characters must obtain a minimum level to perform certain actions, such as wielding a particular weapon, entering a restricted area, or earning the respect of a non-player character. Some games use a system of \"character levels\", where higher-level characters hold an absolute advantage over those of lower level. In these games, statistical character management is usually kept to a minimum. Other games use a system of \"skill levels\" to measure advantages in terms of specific aptitudes, such as weapon handling, spell-casting proficiency, and stealthiness. These games allow the players to customize their characters to a greater extent.\n\nSome games, particularly among MUDs and MMORPGs, place a limit on the experience a character gains from a single encounter or challenge, to reduce the effectiveness of power-leveling.\n\nRemorting is another technique that, while encouraging power-leveling, alleviates its ill effects by giving the player a sense of achievement as it maintains balance with other characters of lower level within the game.\n\n\"Perks\" are special bonuses that video game players can add to their characters to give special abilities. The term refers to the general usage of \"perk\" as an abbreviation of \"perquisite\". Perks are a variation of the power-up mechanic, but are permanent rather than temporary and are progressively unlocked through experience points.\n\nThe concept of permanent power-ups that are progressively unlocked dates back to the early NES action RPGs, \"Deadly Towers\" (1986) and \"Rygar\" (1987), which blurred the line between the power-ups used in action-adventures and the experience points used in role-playing video games. The first video game to use the term \"perks\" to refer to such a mechanic was possibly the 1997 role-playing video game \"Fallout\". Perks have been used in various other video games in recent times, including first-person shooters such as \"\" (2007), \"\" (2009), and \"Killing Floor\" (2009), as well as action games such as \"Metal Gear Online\" (2008).\n\n\"Remorting\" (also known as \"rebirth\", \"ascending/ascension\", \"reincarnating\", or \"new game plus\") is a game mechanic in some role-playing games whereby, once the player character reaches a specified level limit, the player can elect to start over with a new version of his or her character. The bonuses that are given are dependent on several factors, which generally involve the stats of the character before the reincarnation occurs. The remorting character generally loses all levels, but gains an advantage that was previously unavailable, usually access to different races, avatars, classes, skills, or otherwise inaccessible play areas within the game. A symbol often identifies a remorted character.\n\nThe term \"remort\" comes from MUDs, in some of which players may become immortal characters‚Äîadministrative staff‚Äîsimply by advancing to the maximum level. These users are generally expected to distance themselves from gameplay, and interaction with players may be severely limited. When an immortal chooses to vacate his or her position to resume playing the game‚Äîusually from level one just as with any new character‚Äîhe or she is said to have remorted, \"becoming mortal again\". A MUD called \"Arcane Nites\", formerly \"Nitemare\", claims to have created the first remort system and coined the term.\n\nGrinding refers to the process of repeating one specific activity over and over. This is done, for example, by repeatedly participating in challenges, quests, tasks and events which reward experience points for performing repetitive, often menial challenges. This definition can also be used in multi-player games, but it is typically displaced by a much more charged meaning. A term intended to describe this style of play without pejorative connotation is optimization, also known as \"XP farming\".\n\nPower-leveling is using the help of another, stronger player to level a character more quickly than is possible alone.\n\nOne kind of power-leveling refers to an experienced character assisting a character of much lower power (who is often controlled by the experienced character's controller as an assistant character or improved future main character in training) in defeating enemies that would normally be too powerful for the inexperienced character but are easily and quickly killed by the more powerful character or, in games in which experience points or \"credits\" are distributed in proportion to group members' levels, weakened almost to the point of death by the more powerful character, who is not grouped with the inexperienced character. In the latter case, once an enemy is weakened to the point at which the lower-level character can safely finish the kill (usually with the more powerful character's use of healing spells/effects as a backup), the more powerful character uses a spell or effect to stop battle or, if the lower-level character's skills permit, allows itself to be \"rescued\" by the lower-level character, who then finishes the kill and gets all of the associated experience points. Defeating high-level enemies rewards the lower level character with more experience points than it could otherwise achieve.\n\nA second kind of power-leveling refers to a player paying a company or individual to play and level-up their character. The customer provides the company with the username and password for their account, and the company assigns an employee to play the character for the customer until a desired level is reached. This is against the terms of service of many games and, if caught, may result in the character being banned. There are also risks involved, as an unscrupulous service may \"steal\" the character, for later resale to another customer.\n\nPower-leveling increased in \"EverQuest\" as it became more common to sell characters through the Internet. Techniques of kill stealing and power-gaming would make this pursuit considerably more attractive.\n\nTo combat power-leveling and leeching, some game designers have devised better means of rewarding a player based on their actual contribution to the completion of the task. Another method used is to cap how much experience a character can gain at any single moment. For example, the game might not allow a character to gain more than 20% of the experience they need to level up by defeating an enemy. This is controversial in that it also punishes players who are skilled enough to face challenges more difficult than regular players or that band together with other players to face more difficult challenges. \n\nAnother anti-power-leveling method, popularized through widespread adoption of the CircleMUD code base, is to distribute experience points from an enemy across a party \"pro rata\" by level, such that each party member gains a fraction of the enemy's experience points corresponding to the fraction of a party's total level ownership possessed by that character. For example, after any given battle, a level-30 character in a party would earn twice as much experience as would a level-15 character. Power-levelers sometimes circumvent this provision by what could be called \"passive power-leveling\", where a high level character who has access to healing abilities does not formally join the lower-level character's party, instead \"a\") healing and/or \"powering up\" the lower-level character, \"b\") targeting the enemy with spells or effects that do not involve joining the battle, and/or \"c\") fighting alongside the lower-level character until the enemy is nearly defeated and then pausing the battle (\"e.g.\", through use of \"calm\" or a similar command) and allowing the lower-level character to resume, finish, and claim all the experience points for itself. \n\nFinally, power-leveling may be rendered more difficult by having very large jumps between experience points required for each subsequent level of experience. It is common practice to have experience needed increasing in a non-linear way relative to experience levels to push players to the next town or land, but it can also reduce the opportunities for power-leveling as a player would be forced to find a different power-leveling technique for every couple of experience levels and move and do that technique.\n\nGames, that allow several characters participating in a single event (such as battle or quest completion), implement various methods of determining how and when experience gets shared between participants. These methods include: only \"last-hitting\" character, whose hit killed the enemy, getting experience (as in \"Fire Emblem\" series); unconditionally sharing experience among characters (as in \"D&D system\"); and giving experience based on each character's actions (as in \"Final Fantasy Tactics\"). In some online games, it is possible to join a group and gain experience, loot or other rewards, while providing little or no contribution to the group. This type of behaviour is referred to as leeching, particularly when it is done without the permission of other group members. In games which allow players to gain rewards by kill stealing, this is also considered a form of leeching. This is extremely common in games such as \"Dungeon Defenders\", in which all players receive the same rewards regardless of their contributions.\n\nSome players of online games use automated programs known as bots to grind or leech for them in order to progress with minimal effort. This practice often violates the terms of service. Bots are also commonly used in commercial operations in order to powerlevel a character, either to increase the sale value of the account, or to allow the character to be used for commercial gold farming.\n\n\n"}

It is operated by a joint venture between the country's major free-to-air broadcasters ‚Äì government-owned Television New Zealand and Radio New Zealand, government-subsidised MƒÅori Television, and the Australian-owned MediaWorks New Zealand (operators of Three, Bravo and The Edge TV). It consists of a HD-capable digital terrestrial television service, to around 86% of the population in the major urban and provincial centres of New Zealand, and a standard-definition satellite television service, called Freeview Satellite, covering the whole of mainland New Zealand and the major offshore islands. Freeview uses the DVB-S and DVB-T standards on government-provided spectrum.\n\nFreeview was launched in May 2007, preparing for analogue switch-off, which began on 30 September 2012 and was completed on 1 December 2013. In 2014, it was estimated that Freeview makes up approximately 61.7% of the television share in New Zealand.\n\nFreeview-certified set-top boxes and IDTVs, as well as PVRs, are available at most major retailers. Uncertified equipment can also be used to receive the service, which may have advantages (cheaper, extra features, international channels) and disadvantages (no/limited EPG, no auto-retuning) over certified equipment.\n\nIt was announced on 15 June 2006 that Freeview's digital terrestrial television would broadcast via satellite (DVB-S) from mid-2007 and via terrestrial transmissions (DVB-T) from mid-2008. Freeview's marketing campaign began on 23 April 2007 through a website and through four television advertisements shown on Freeview's shareholders' TV channels, using the slogan \"Make bad reception a thing of the past\", and showing people using proverbial substitutes for rabbit ears for receiving TV reception. Since 2012, MƒÅori comedian Pio Terei has been the advertising face of Freeview.\n\nFreeview's satellite service began on 2 May 2007 with five television channels: TV One, TV2, TV3, C4, and MƒÅori Television. Freeview's first digital-only channel, TVNZ Sport Extra temporary channel from TVNZ, began on 18 May 2007, providing coverage of the V8 Supercar racing. The channel has since ceased broadcasting.\n\nThe Freeview terrestrial service, originally named \"Freeview<nowiki>|</nowiki>HD\", officially launched on 14 April 2008. The service initially operated only from Kordia sites for areas surrounding Auckland, Hamilton, Tauranga, Napier-Hastings, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch, and Dunedin. JDA sites were upgraded later with DVB-T QAM modulating multiplexers for non-metro areas.\n\nThe Freeview ordering groups broadcasters by how much they pay for government owned Kordia transmission services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMHEG-IC channels are from LCN 200 to 299. From 2011 it is mandatory for all TVs over 32inch and PVRs to include IP based MHEG Interaction Channel. It's optional on receivers to ensure that a lower cost option is available as New Zealand heads towards DSO.\n\nIn October 2014, \"Worldnet TV\" launched the first commercial MHEG-IC channel in New Zealand and was added to JDA regional sites as an MHEG-IC application on LCN 250 which includes seven live streams. As of 29 October 2014, live channels include NHK World, Arirang TV, MBC, Yonhap, MBN, HiTV+ and BTN.\n\nFreeview has its own eight-day electronic programme guide (EPG), named Freeview EPG; TVNZ's Teletext service was also available until it was discontinued in April 2013. The EPG via the satellite service provides an eight-day schedule with programme details on both a traditional EIT and MHEG-5 application, whereas the EPG via the terrestrial service has limited programme details via the traditional EIT with full details available only via the MHEG-5 application.\n\nFor all \"certified\" NZ Freeview (also all Australian \"Freeview EPG\" branded) receivers to activate the MHEG-5 EPG, the receiver \"must\" remap the remote control's \"guide\" button to be an extended function key for use by MHEG-5 applications which are normally limited to the four coloured buttons for launching functions. This is more common on terrestrial than on satellite due to the differences in launch dates. Receivers that do this make the traditional EIT function useless, which is why independent local broadcasters (such as the Hawke's Bay's TVHB) have to pay Freeview to include their scheduling details within the Freeview guide. Broadcasters within the UK do not have this problem as they only use the traditional EIT with MHEG-5's use limited to interactive services such as the \"Red Button\" Teletext replacement and internet streaming services.\n\nDuring the third week of December 2014, TVNZ tested using the same Huffman look-up tables the BBC implemented to force viewers to use approved Freeview receivers that restrict HD recording and viewing. The Huffman tables are being used to compress the EIT text used for terrestrial schedule event names and descriptions. From March 2015, TVNZ began compressing the EIT schedule again. Compressing the EIT text in the schedule would not achieve the same receiver use given the terrestrial EIT only has limited programme details. Receivers that don't use the BBC huffman tables will either display no details or display garbage characters.\n\nThe assigned identifiers managed by TVNZ and Kordia on behalf of Freeview are as follows:\n\nH.222 Program IDs (aka Service IDs)\nH.222 Transport IDs\nDVB Transmission Network ID for the Freeview terrestrial service is 13313.\n\nDVB Original (content) Network ID for the terrestrial service is 8746.\n\nDVB Transmission and Original (content) Network ID for the satellite service is 47 and registered to TVNZ.\n\nDVB Transmission and Original (content) Network ID for the Igloo terrestrial service is 11008 and registered to Sky.\n\nDVB-T Cell ID used by the Kordia operated terrestrial service for filtering channels by transmitter site:\n\nThis is a five digit number with the first digit identifying the transport provider, the second digit identifies the multiplexed transport, the third digit identifies the region with the final two specifying the region's transmitter site.\nProvider\n\nRegions\n\nTransmitter Site\n the Freeview platform has 30 television channels and 4 radio stations.\n\nFor the satellite service (up-linked from the Avalon studios in Lower Hutt), up to 18 channels will be available, with six each assigned to TVNZ and MediaWorks frequencies, and the balance to other networks. Given that TVNZ's and MediaWorks's current free-to-air channels will be available on Freeview, there will be eight extra channels in total, between the two.\n\nServices (taken from AsiaSat 3S @ 105 east) that were available before the Freeview launch on satellite were Zing channels ZEE TV, Cinema, News and Punjabi, BHARAT TV, Al Jazeera Arabic and English channels, DWTV, TV5 and VOA.\n\nThe Freeview|HD Demo terrestrial channel 100 was removed to free up space for various SD channels.\n\nThe TVNZ Sport Extra channel 20 was temporarily provided for the 2008 Olympics, the space on DVB-S was later used by a regional version of TV One.\n\nThe Auckland-based STRATOS channel 21 was discontinued due to service fee increases that occurred when its ratings increased, it was later replaced by ChoiceTV. STRATOS later reemerged on pay TV under the name Face TV.\n\nTVNZ 6 and 7 were discontinued due to the government-provided funding coming to an end and were respectively, replaced by U and an hour delay of TV One. TVNZ U was replaced by an hour delay of TV2 in 2013.\n\nTrackside became a pay TV only channel on 14 April 2014 as a measure to raise more revenue for increased services for New Zealand Racing Board customers.\n\nC4 closed-down on 26 June 2014 to free space for a time shifted version of FOUR.\n\nThe following channels were closed down due to being unable to meet transmission costs: Sommet Sports on 12 December 2014, Cue on 10 April 2015, and tvCentral (Hamilton and Tauranga) and TV Rotorua both on 30 April 2015.\n\nFreeview will be open to other free-to-air broadcasters if they want to join.\n\nAccording to Kordia there is space for approximately only 20 channels on the two satellite transponders that Freeview leases . However at 22.5 MBd with a FEC of 3/4 one 23¬†MHz frequency can only accommodate either six SD 4:3 H.262 QPSK channels or four HD 16:9 H.264 8PSK channels while maintaining an optimal bit rate.\n\nSatellite transmissions are broadcast in 576i, but the satellite transponder is high-definition capable.\nTerrestrial transmissions can be broadcast in high definition, and the government lets the broadcasters decide whether to broadcast in high definition or to continue in standard definition.\n\nSix channels currently broadcast in high definition: TVNZ 1, TVNZ 2, TVNZ DUKE, Three, Maori Television and Te Reo in 1080i\"\".\n\nFreeview satellite broadcasts have declined in quality since the service launched as TV ONE and TV3 are now being broadcast many times to provide region-specific advertisements; this reduces the bandwidth available to other channels on that frequency.\"\" From July 2016, Mediaworks will deregionalise TV3 so that is uses 1 SD channel alongside its HD channel. \n\nThe TVNZ frequency currently has 8 SD channels while the MediaWorks one has 12 TV channels and 5 radio channels.\n\nUHF terrestrial broadcasting using DVB-T H.264 (also known as DVB-T HD), and currently covers 86 percent of the country's population. Only three towns with a population over 10,000 do not have terrestrial service: Queenstown (pop. ), Blenheim (pop. ) and Whakatane (pop. ). In addition, Oamaru (pop. ) has limited terrestrial service through local station 45 South TV, while coverage of Cambridge (pop. ) is intermittent as hills partially block the signal from Te Aroha transmitter and Hamilton Towers transmitter is not powerful enough (63¬†watts) to reach the town. Freeview's terrestrial transmissions are broadcast from Kordia's and JDA's transmitter towers.\n\nFreeview uses the DVB-T ODFM standard for terrestrial transmission, as established in 2001 with NZS6610:2001, to avoid the multipath problem caused by New Zealand's rugged topography. ATSC, the rival US standard that uses 8-VSB modulation, had a number of first gen. demodulators that couldn't handle multipath well, so it was not chosen.\n\nTerrestrial Freeview is broadcast in H.264, which unlike H.262 has an expensive transmission patent licensing tax for free TV and subscription use. People who took part in the Auckland digital trial using terrestrial H.262 receivers needed to change their receivers to more expensive H.264 models in order to receive terrestrial Freeview. DVB-T H.264 is also known in other countries as DVB-T HD, due to H.262 being used for SD. Currently the government owned TVNZ and Kordia which operate the H.264 re-compression multiplexers are failing to fully meet the in \"Good Standing\" payments to be included in the licensees listing. MHEG-5 is used for the electronic programming guide.\n\nMHEG-5 support is built by the UK's Strategy and Technology who provided the similar applications for the BBC's \"Red Button\" and terrestrial internet streaming platform.\n\nFreeview Satellite uses the Optus D1 satellite to broadcast, on two transponders, leased from Kordia. The satellite transmissions utilise H.262 video. Freeview cannot easily move to H.264 video broadcasting in the future as the encoding is unsupported by a large number of the receivers in the Freeview Satellite install base, also the additional patent licensing tax would make the satellite service even more expensive for channel operators. Unlike the terrestrial service, the satellite service broadcasts a more useful traditional DVB EPG alongside the functionally limited MHEG-5 EPG.\n\nFreeview had discussed with Telecom about the provision of IPTV over ADSL until it was shelved due to bandwidth and availability limitations.\n\nFreeview certifies set-top boxes but does not sell them; they are marketed by electronics retailers. Freeview certification centres the localisation of multimedia data, primarily for the electronic programming guide (EPG). This data is broadcast over DVB using the MHEG-5 standard. At the moment this is only used to transmit EPG data.\n\nFreeview Record certification of digital video recorders is similar to Freeview certification, but also includes dual tuner with smart conflict resolution including alternate recordings of repeat programmes and one touch series recording from the EPG. Full fast forward and rewind cuing is available while an automatic ad skip function is not allowed. For copyrighted HD content, only devices that comply with studio DTCP are allowed to externally transfer content while all SD content is transferrable. There are no time limits on content playback. As of May 2012, there are currently two certified MyFreeview Satellite receivers available, which are from the New Zealand-based Dish TV company.\n\nMHEG-5 is used exclusively for a full 8-day terrestrial broadcast schedule as Freeview do not fully populate the DVB EIT EPG, this means there are few uncertified terrestrial receivers on the market able to run the MHEG-5 Freeview EPG application. An uncertified terrestrial DVR would have to know the specific files to extract from the DSM-CC stream to support a full EPG.\n\nFreeview certification requires set-top boxes to disallow high definition video output over connections that do not support HDCP. In practice this means nearly all HD CRT televisions sold in New Zealand and many early flat screen televisions can only receive high definition from an uncertified set-top box, which can output high definition over HDCP-free connections like component cables or on HDMI without HDCP.\n\nDigital TV Labs is an officially approved test centre for Freeview New Zealand conformance testing, where manufacturers wishing to deploy devices with the associated Freeview New Zealand logos and access to the Freeview EPG can obtain pass reports.\n\nThere are also many non-certified options are available. These and other FTA receivers have no limit on advert skipping nor restrict access to the recorded files or prevent streaming of recordings to other devices, Ultraplus X-9200HD PVR, Vu+ Duo, Xcruiser XDSR385HD PVR are all examples of units that are or have been sold in NZ and have all of this capability. They can also receive any other available non-freeview channel.\n\nA terrestrial network of 64-QAM and 256-QAM capable transmitters around New Zealand are maintained by both Kordia and Johnson Dick and Associates (JDA).\n\nKordia owned sites are on mostly crown-owned DOC land providing TV and radio digital services to only Freeview and Igloo, whereas JDA equipped sites are only on commercial land. Shared sites such as Auckland's Sky Tower have the advantage of not requiring a separate antenna unlike Nelson's Mainland TV which is located between sites. In the Wairarapa and Southland, JDA's Popoiti and Forest Hill transmitters were used rather than Kordia's Otahoua and Hedgehope transmitters which had previously been used for UHF transmitters, necessitating viewers in these regions to rotate their outdoor antennas.\n\nPolarisation (i.e., antenna orientation) is either horizontal/flat (H) or vertical/tall (V). A high-power site has a licensed broadcasting power of 10,000¬†watts or greater; a medium-power site has a licensed broadcasting power of between 500 and 10,000¬†watts; and a low-power site has a licensed broadcasting power of less than 500¬†watts.\n\nHigh-power sites are Waiatarua (H) for the Auckland metropolitan area (including Pukekohe), Te Aroha (H) for the Waikato and parts of Tauranga, Mount Erin (V) for Hawke's Bay, Mount Taranaki (H) for Taranaki, Wharite (V) for the Manawatu, Kaukau for the Wellington (H) metropolitan area, Sugarloaf (H) for Christchurch, Mount Cargill (H) for Dunedin and Forest Hill (V) for Invercargill. All except the last are operated by Kordia.\n\nMedium-power sites run by Kordia are Waiheke Island Airstrip (V) for Waiheke Island, Kopukairua (V) for Tauranga, Ngarara (V) for Kapiti, and Fitzherbert (V) for Lower Hutt and Wainuiomata.\n\nMedium-power sites run by JDA are Parihaka (V) for Whangarei, Sky Tower (V) for Auckland, Pukepoto (V) for Rotorua, Whakaroa (V) for Taupo, Parikanapa (H) and Wheatstone Road (H) for Gisborne, Popoiti (H) for the Wairarapa, Mount Campbell (V) and Botanical Ridge (H) for Nelson, and Cave Hill (V) for Timaru.\n\nLow-power sites run are Pinehill (H) for Auckland's North Shore, Remuera (V) for the Remuera area, Hamilton Towers (V) for Hamilton city, Napier Airport (V) for northern Napier, Mount Jowett (H) for Whanganui, Baxters Knob (H) for Porirua and Tawa, and Haywards (V) for the Hutt Valley. All except the last are operated by Kordia.\n\nFreeview is the second digital TV system attempted by the government. The first, in 2000, cost NZ$6.8 million.\n\nThe government will pay up to NZ$25 million and provide free radio spectrum, estimated to be worth up to NZ$10 million during the transition to digital; the companies involved will pay the remaining $50 million. Canterbury TV estimates it will need to pay NZ$1 million a year if it joins Freeview. The government claims a NZ$230 million benefit to the economy.\n\nSKY had a \"free-to-air\" package where channels similar to the ones available on Freeview were available for a monthly fee of NZ$18.29, plus an installation fee of NZ$99. Around 90,000 people use this service, generally those who cannot get a high quality signal from analogue terrestrial television. SKY has been relatively unaffected. Because both services use Optus D1, a SKY dish can be used to receive Freeview, but a separate set-top box is required.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It began as the Gamma Phi fraternity, founded in 1929 by ISU gymnastics instructor Clifford \"Pop\" Horton. The fraternity's first circus performance took place in 1931. Gamma Phi Circus is a performing arts fraternal organization and is no longer affiliated with social fraternities or sororities and is a registered student organization.\n\nGamma Phi Circus was founded in 1929 by Dr. Clifford Horton, who was a gymnastics instructor for Illinois State Normal University. The Gamma Phi fraternity was founded in 1929 and held the first Gamma Phi Circus performance in 1932 on the Illinois State University campus. The Bloomington-Normal community has had strong ties to circuses since the 1880s, and was home to the Flying Wards and the Conciellos, both trapeze acts. Women always performed in the Circuses and began to be formally initiated into the organization in 1939.\n\nCircus alumni have gone on to perform in a variety of venues including the Shrine Circuses, the Circus Kingdom, Roberts Brothers Circus, Kelly Brothers Circus, the Great American Circus, and the Circus Alleluia. They have also performed at Disney World, Sea World, Busch Gardens, Universal Studios, Great America, and at Club Med Resorts. Members and alumni have also competed several times internationally in the Rhoenradturnen (Wheel Gymnastics) World Championships. In February 2017, five members competed in two acts at the first annual VivaFest, a circus competition in Las Vegas, Nevada. Lyric Hoop and Cyr Wheel received fourth place and Dance Trapeze received fifth. There were 37 acts in Gamma Phi Circus's category.\n\nGamma Phi Circus is an entirely self-financed organization supported by revenue from the home performances. \"Home Shows\" performed at Illinois State University draw visitors to the university. Gamma Phi Circus also offers free exhibitions that publicize the show and the University. Local businesses and corporations help with the cost of the show by sponsoring certain acts and purchasing advertisement space in the program. The circus rents space from the university at full cost, buys or makes the costumes, and does maintenance and buys equipment for the rehearsal areas. Advertising is through TV, radio, newspapers, and brochures.\n\nGamma Phi Circus performs \"Home Shows\" as well as exhibitions and road shows. Every April their Home Show at Redbird Arena usually consists of twenty or more acts and typically draws an audience of over 16,000 fans. Twenty to thirty road shows and exhibitions are also performed each year for schools, businesses, and charities. Gamma Phi Circus' road show performances are approximately two hours long, and are performed in advance of the main Home Show. They perform double-duty as both a full circus performance and a preview and tune-up for the main show. Exhibitions are usually forty-five minutes in length and will normally consist of floor acts only including acrosport, globes, unicycles, gymwheel, chair balancing and juggling and are typically performed for school assemblies and open houses.\n"}

{"id": "43151763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43151763", "title": "Ink wash animation", "text": "Ink wash animation\n\nInk wash animation (Ê∞¥Â¢®Âä®Áîª, \"shuimo donghua\") is an animation style that is unique to China. This style combines both Chinese traditional aesthetics of Shui-mo and modern animation techniques. It first appeared in the 1961 with the first Chinese ink-wash animation \"Tadpoles Searching for Mother\". After the 1990s, film studios gradually gave up ink-wash animation production due to the high demand in cost and techniques.\n\nIn late 1950s, inspired by China's legendary painter Qi Baishi's water-ink painting, Chinese animation industry pioneers began to explore ways to turn Chinese traditional paintings into cartoon form. The first ink-wash animation film, \"Tadpoles Searching for Mother\", received the Best Animated Film Prize at the First Hundred Flowers Awards, as well as several international prizes. Since then, more ink-wash film were produced.\n\nBut by the 1990s, animation studios without government funding were urged to produce cheap television series instead of costly ink-wash production. Techniques that had once been identified as state secrets were used to shoot commercial advertising. \"Feeling from Mountain and Water\", produced in 1988, is said to be the last masterpiece of Chinese ink-wash animation film.\n\nThe film is based on a children's story written by Fang Huizhen and Sheng Lude. A group of newly born tadpoles decide to seek for their mother who they've never met before. On the way, they mistake golden fish, crab, tortoise and fish for their mother, and they gather new clues about their mother's appearance through each encounter.\n\nThis 14-minute film has been internationally recognized in many film festivals, including the Locarno International Film Festival in 1961, the 4th Annecy International Animation Film Festival in 1962, and the 3rd Zagreb World Festival of Animated Films in 1978.\n\nOn the surface, the film appears to be simple. However, each frame required complex techniques and much work in order to present the artistic style of ink-wash painting. The techniques were even regarded as a \"state secret\".\n\nProduced in 1963, this film uses Chinese ink paintings to depict the charming relationship between a young cow herding boy with extraordinary flute playing skills and his faithful water buffalo. The boy falls asleep in a tree, and he dreams that he has lost his buffalo. It turns out that the buffalo is drawn to the beautiful scenery of a waterfall and refuses to return to the herding boy. The boy then plays the flute, and the melody helps bring the buffalo back to him.\n\nThere is no dialogue in the film. Story is told through animation and the accompanying music, therefore the film is entirely accessible to a non-Chinese speaking audience. The flute melody was played by China's most famous bamboo flute soloist Lu Chunling. The film was awarded the Golden Prize at the Odense International Fairy Tale Film Festival in Denmark. People called ink-wash animation the \"fifth Chinese invention\".\n\nNamed after a phrase for landscape painting, \"Feeling from Mountain and Water\" became the last water-ink animation. The film tells the simple tale of an impoverished elderly zither musician and a young boy. The zither musician falls ill on his way back home. The boy kindly takes him to his house and takes care of the musician. To thank the boy, the musician begins to teach the boy zither and becomes his mentor and friend. The film eschews dialogue, yet the animation and music make the film rich in emotion and philosophical ideas.\n\nThe 18-minute film is regarded by many as the masterpiece of Chinese ink-wash animation. The musical accompaniment of the film is mainly featured by zither, however, \"some of the most moving moments of the film unfold purely through the image to the sound of rushing winds or total silence\".\n\nDuring the ten-year turmoil of Cultural Revolution, many animation producers were attacked, and the development of animation industry was suspended. \"The Cowboy's Flute\" became the target of criticism because of its representation of pastoral life instead of class struggles.\n\nWhen ink-wash animation was first produced in 1960s, China was under the planned economy. Film studios were owned and supported by the state. Fundings were granted to animation production at the standard of 8000RMB per minute. Consequently, artists and technicians in the production teams were able to fully engage in artistic creation and innovation without financial or commercial burdens.\n\nHowever, starting in the late 1980s, China began its transition into market economy. State-owned studios lost their government funding, and were urged to produce cheap television series in oder to support themselves. Ink-wash animation production was regarded as \"costly\" and \"unnecessary\".\n"}

Presently it is running in Anaheim, California, San Diego, California, Palm Springs, California, Chicago, Illinois, Hartford, Connecticut and Boston, Massachusetts. \n\nThe show was written by the husband-and-wife team of Paul and Darlyne Franklin.\n\nAudience members are active participants in the wedding nuptials and subsequent reception, which take place in a restaurant in Boston's North End owned by the bride's cousin and the play's master of ceremonies, Carmine Cannoli. The wedding, performed by \"St. Anthony's\" parish priest Pastor Fazool, brings together the families of two young lovers, Joseph Anthony Gnocchi and Maria Angelina Cavatelli. The cast of characters are all, in fact, named after Italian dishes. Chaos ensues during the ceremony with the unexpected arrival of Joey's provocatively dressed ex-girlfriend, Viola Vermicelli. Viola, it seems, is still in love with Joey. Despite Joey's roving eye, he's very much in love with Maria and loudly protests Viola's arrival. After the couple is joined, the cast leaves the room and are reintroduced one at a time by Carmine. A toast is raised by Joey's scatterbrained best man, Rocco Ravioli. During the toast, dinner is being served to the guests. \n\nUpon its completion, the cast moves about the tables, chatting and flirting with the guests. After dinner, the party itself commences with traditional Italian-American flourishes such as a sing-along and a \"tarantella.\" The traditional bouquet and garter tosses place the guests who catch them in a rather bizarre and extremely funny onstage situation in which the male guest is asked to remove the garter from the leg of the female guest using only his teeth. The arrival of Maria's Mafioso godfather Don Ziti (often played by a selected good-sport audience member) also means the arrival of a large sum of money for the new couple. The \"money\" is handed over to Joey's cousin, bridesmaid Louisa Ravioli, for safekeeping. The money later turns up missing and a male guest is \"accused\" of stealing it. He's led out the door and is met by a hail of gunfire... which misses. Joey & Maria come back dressed in snazzy traveling clothes, ready for one final dance, then off to honeymoon in Vegas and spend some of that wedding dough... \"and they all lived happily ever after!\"\n\nVery few parts of \"Joey and Maria's Comedy Italian Wedding\" are scripted, with the momentum of the play maintained by ad-libbed slapstick humor.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1220963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1220963", "title": "Manhua", "text": "Manhua\n\nManhua () are Chinese comics produced in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.\n\nThe word \"manhua\", literally \"impromptu sketches\", is originally an 18th-century term used in Chinese literati painting. It became popular in Japan as manga in the late 18th century. Feng Zikai, in his 1925 series of cartoons entitled \"Zikai Manhua\", reintroduced the term into Chinese in the modern sense.\n\nThe oldest surviving examples of Chinese drawings are stone reliefs from the 11th century BC and pottery from 5000 to 3000 B.C. Other examples include symbolic brush drawings from the Ming Dynasty, a satirical drawing titled \"Peacocks\" by the early Qing Dynasty artist Zhu Da, and a work called \"Ghosts' Farce Pictures\" from around 1771 by Luo Liang-feng. Chinese manhua was born in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, roughly during the years 1867 to 1927.\n\nThe introduction of lithographic printing methods derived from the West was a critical step in expanding the art in the early 20th century. Beginning in the 1870s, satirical drawings appeared in newspapers and periodicals. By the 1920s palm-sized picture books like Lianhuanhua were popular in Shanghai. They are considered the predecessor of modern-day manhua.\n\nOne of the first magazines of satirical cartoons came from the United Kingdom entitled \"The China Punch\". The first piece drawn by a person of Chinese nationality was \"The Situation in the Far East\" from Tse Tsan-tai in 1899, printed in Japan. Sun Yat-Sen established the Republic of China in 1911 using Hong Kong's manhua to circulate anti-Qing propaganda. Some of the manhua that mirrored the early struggles of the transitional political and war periods were \"The True Record\" and \"Renjian Pictorial\".\n\nUp until the establishment of the Shanghai Sketch Society in 1927, all prior works were Lianhuanhua or loose collections of materials. The first successful manhua magazine, \"Shanghai Sketch\" (or \"Shanghai Manhua\") appeared in 1928. Between 1934 and 1937 about 17 manhua magazines were published in Shanghai. This format would once again be put to propaganda use with the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War. By the time the Japanese occupied Hong Kong in 1941, all manhua activities had stopped. With the surrender of the Japanese in 1945, political mayhem between Chinese Nationalists and Communists took place. One of the critical manhua, \"This Is a Cartoon Era\" by Renjian Huahui made note of the political backdrop at the time.\n\nOne of the most popular and enduring comics of this period was Zhang Leping's \"Sanmao\", first published in 1935.\n\nThe rise of Chinese immigration turned Hong Kong into the main manhua-ready market, especially with the baby boom generation of children. The most influential manhua magazine for adults was the 1956 \"Cartoons World\", which fueled the best-selling Uncle Choi. The availability of Japanese and Taiwanese comics challenged the local industry, selling at a pirated bargain price of 10 cents. Manhua like \"Old Master Q\" were needed to revitalize the local industry.\n\nThe arrival of television in the 1970s was a changing point. Bruce Lee's films dominated the era and his popularity launched a new wave of Kung Fu manhua. The explicit violence helped sell comic books, and the Government of Hong Kong intervened with the Indecent Publication Law in 1975. \"Little Rascals\" was one of the pieces which absorbed all the social changes.\nThe materials would also bloom in the 90s with work like McMug and three-part stories like \"Teddy Boy\", \"Portland Street\" and \"Red Light District\".\n\nSince the 1950s, Hong Kong's manhua market has been separate from that of mainland China.\n\n\"Si loin et si proche\", by Chinese writer and illustrator Xiao Bai, won the Gold Award at the 4th International Manga Award in 2011. Several other manhua have also won the Silver and Bronze Awards at the International Manga Award.\n\nIn the second half of the 2000s and early 2010s, various Chinese cartoonists began using social media to spread satirical strips and cartoons online. Print publishing, being strictly controlled in China, is slowly being traded in for microblogging websites such as Sina Weibo and Douban, where manhua can reach a wide audience while subject to less editorial control.\n\nDespite China being a major consumer of comics for decades, the medium has never been taken as \"serious works of art\". R. Martin of \"The Comics Journal\" describes the Chinese outlook on comics as \"pulpy imitations of films\". Furthermore, China strictly controls the publishing of comics, and as a result, cartoonists faced difficulty reaching a large audience. Many cartoonists in the late 2000s began self-publishing their work on social media instead of attempting to issue paper editions. Websites such as Douban (2005) and Sina Weibo (2009) are popular venues for web manhua and webcomics.\n\nThe Taipei International Comics and Animation Festival celebrated a coming \"webcomics era\" in 2015. With increased smartphone usage with a younger generation, web manhua, webcomics, and webtoons are expected to become more popular. With an increasing prevalence of Chinese-language online comic platforms, young artists have more opportunities to publish their work and gain a reputation. In the second half of the 2010s, South Korean webtoons and webtoon platforms have become increasingly popular in China.\n\nIn 2016, two manhua have been adapted into anime television series: \"Yi Ren Zhi Xia\" and \"Soul Buster\". Another series, \"Bloodivores\", based on a web manhua, will start airing on October 1, 2016. Another series, \"The Silver Guardian\", is scheduled to premiere in 2017.\n\nIn 1925, the political work of Feng Zikai published a collection entitled \"Zi-Kai Manhua\" in \"Wenxue Zhoubao\" (Literature Weekly). While the term \"manhua\" had existed before when borrowed from Japanese \"manga\", this particular publication took precedence over the many other description of cartoon arts that came before it. As a result, the term manhua became associated with Chinese comic materials. The Chinese characters for manhua are identical for those used in Japanese manga and Korean manhwa. Someone who draws or writes manhua is referred to as a \"manhuajia\" ().\n\nBefore the official terminology was established, the art form was known by several names.\nToday's manhua are simply distinguished by four categories.\nModern Chinese-style manhua characteristics is credited to the breakthrough art work of the 1982 \"\". It had innovative, realistic drawings with details resembling real people. Most manhua work from the 1800s to the 1930s contained characters that appeared serious. The cultural openness in Hong Kong brought the translation of American Disney characters like Mickey Mouse and Pinocchio in the 1950s, demonstrating western influence in local work like \"Little Angeli\" in 1954. The influx of translated Japanese manga of the 60s, as well as televised anime in Hong Kong also made a significant impression. Unlike manga, manhua comes in full color with some panels rendered entirely in painting for the single issue format.\n\nDepending on the region where it's created, manhua can have differences in the way it is formatted and presented. Besides the use of traditional and simplified Chinese characters, manhua can also be read differently depending on where it's from. Manhua from mainland China is read from left-to-right like Western comics and Korean manhwa while manhua from Taiwan and Hong Kong is read from right-to-left like Japanese manga. The same applies to the text in its original Chinese. Text in manhua from mainland China is placed horizontally and read from left-to-right while in Taiwan and Hong Kong, the text is placed vertically going down and is read from right-to-left. This is due to the changes that the Chinese communist government made to the way Chinese text is written and read to bring it more align to the way it's done in the West. Since Taiwan and Hong Kong have some autonomy from the Chinese government, they have stuck to their traditional ways of formatting and writing.\n\nOnline manhua, known as web manhua, are a growing art form in China, where traditionally published manhua are in decline. Web manhua are posted on social media and web manhua portals, which serve as a lower bar of entry than the strictly controlled print publication outlets in the country. Though little money is currently made through online manhua in China, the medium has become popular due to ease of uploading and publishing titles, color publication, and free reading access. Some popular web manhua sites include QQ Comic and U17. In recent years, several Chinese web manhua have been adapted into animated series, with some in co-production with the Japanese animation industry.\n\nAs microblogging and webcomics were gaining popularity in China, the form was increasingly used for political activism and satire. Despite China being a major consumer of comics for decades, the medium has never been taken as \"serious works of art\". R. Martin of \"The Comics Journal\" describes the Chinese outlook on comics as \"pulpy imitations of films\". Furthermore, China strictly controls the publishing of comics, and as a result, cartoonists faced difficulty reaching a large audience. Many cartoonists in the late 2000s began self-publishing their work on social media instead of attempting to issue paper editions. Websites such as Douban (2005) and Sina Weibo (2009) are popular venues for webcomics. he Taipei International Comics and Animation Festival celebrated a coming \"webcomics era\" in 2015. With increased smartphone usage with a younger generation, webcomics featuring a scrollable infinite canvas are expected to become more popular. With an increasing prevalence of Chinese-language webcomic portals, young artists have more opportunities to publish their work and gain a reputation. In the second half of the 2010s, South Korean webcomics and webtoon platforms have become increasingly popular in China.\n\nCartoonists such as Kuang Biao and Rebel Pepper make use of the Internet to criticize the Communist Party and its leaders. Communist propaganda and figures such as Lei Feng are openly mocked on microblogs and in online cartoons, despite efforts of censorship by the Chinese government. David Bandurski, a researcher with the University of Hong Kong's China Media Project, stated that social media has \"dramatically changed the environment for cartoonists [as] they now have a really good platform to find an audience.\" Chinese animator Pi San criticized internet companies and web portals for being \"pretty cowardly\" and \"too sensitive\", as they take on the role of first line of defense through self-censorship. Rebel Pepper's account on Sina Weibo, where he posts his satiral cartoons, had been deleted over 180 times by 2012.\n\nBlogging websites such as Sina Weibo are also highly censored by the Chinese government. Reuters reported in September 2013 that about 150 graduates, all male, were employed to censor Sina Weibo day and night, and automatic censors processed around three million posts per day. A research team from Rice University, Texas, stated that they saw \"a fairly sophisticated system, where human power is amplified by computer automation, capable of removing sensitive posts within minutes.\" Images censored from Sina Weibo include a portrait of Mao Zedong wearing a pollution mask, a photo compilation identifying the expensive watches on the wrists of supposedly low-waged local officials, and criticism on police action, censorship in education, and the one child policy.\n\nWebtoons have grown in popularity in China as another form to consume and produce manhua in the country thanks in part to the popularity of South Korean webtoons. Microblogging platforms Sina Weibo and Tencent have also offered webtoons on their digital manhua sites alongside web manhua. Also Beijing-based platform Kuaikan Manhua specialises in artwork targeting young readers. Several of these manhuas have later been translated into various languages. While webtoon portals in mainland China are mainly run by the big internet companies, webtoon portals in Taiwan are offered and operated by big webtoon publishers outside the country like Comico, and Naver (under the Line brand).\n\nChina\nTaiwan\nChinese Animation and Comic Publisher Association secretary-general Roger Kao stated in 2015 that comic book sales were strongly in decline. The Taiwanese comics industry expects webcomics to prosper financially, though no accurate figures exist as of yet. Prize-winning cartoonists such as Chung Yun-de and Yeh Yu-tung were forced to turn to webcomics as their monthly income was too low to live from.\n\nBeijing cartoonist Bu Er Miao sells her webcomic \"Electric Cat and Lightning Dog\" on Douban's eBook service for 1.99 CNY (roughly 0.30 USD). When asked about whether she makes a profit off of her webcomic, Miao described the 1.79 CNY she makes per comic sold as \"an amount of money that if you saw it on the street, no one would bother to pick it up.\" Political cartoonist Liu \"Big Corpse Brother\" Jun had over 130,000 followers on Sina Weibo in December 2013, and Kuang Biao has his work appear both online and in various print journals.\n\nThe Chinese webcomic \"One Hundred Thousand Bad Jokes\" received a film adaptation of the same name released in 2014. In 2016, two anime series based on Chinese web manhua were broadcast: \"\", based on \"Yi Ren Zhi Xia\" by Dong Man Tang and \"Bloodivores\", based on a web manhua by Bai Xiao. An animated series adaptation of a web manhua by Pingzi, \"Spiritpact\", has been released in China. A Chinese-Japanese animated series based on \"Ch≈çy≈´ Sekai\" is scheduled to air in 2017. Another series, \"The Silver Guardian\", based on \"Y√≠n Zhƒ´ Sh«íu M√π R√©n\", premiered in 2017.\n\nKakao, operating the Korean webtoon portal Daum Webtoon, has collaborated with the Chinese Huace Group in order to produce live-action, Chinese language films and television dramas based on South Korean webtoons.\n\n\n\n"}

State and private media operators provide services in the main languages Sinhala, Tamil and English. The government owns two major TV stations, radio networks operated by the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC), and newspaper titles in Sinhala, Tamil, and English.\n\nAfter the growth of Sri Lankan economy, many satellite TV channels were introduced.\n\nHowever, there are over a dozen privately owned radio stations and more than 30 privately operated television stations. They often engage in political debates.\n\nThe use of the internet is a growing force within Sri Lanka, many of the newspapers now have online editions. Because of the limited circulation for the daily and weekly newspapers, they are heavily dependent on advertising. As a result of this it is very rare to see Sri Lankan newspapers engage in investigative journalism or daring expos√©s of big business.\n\nPress freedom is a major concern in Sri Lanka. Both sides in the war make efforts to silence inconvenient reporters. Around 15 reporters received death threats from one faction or the other in 2004 The assassinated reporter Aiyathurai Nadesan, correspondent in Batticaloa for several Tamil media stated just prior to his assassination in 2005:\nWe are caught between a rock and a hard place. It is very difficult for us to check reports either with the security forces or the Tamil Tigers. And when a news item on local events is datelined Colombo, it puts us at risk of reprisals on the ground.\nIn 2005, the Tamil newspaper Thinakkural was threatened by Karuna. Copies of the newspaper were burned in the Eastern provinces. On the other hand, distribution of the Tamil weekly Thinamurasu is blocked by the LTTE because it is close to another armed group, the EPDP.\n\nBBC World Service stopped its broadcast in Sinhalese and Tamil for fear of reprisal against its reporters.\n\nDuring the Rajapaksa administration, press freedom in Sri Lanka became the \"worst in any democratic country\", according to the Reporters without borders index, ranking 165th among 173 countries in the index. \nOn 21 November 2008, a twelve-member group of masked men, forcibly entered the printing press of Sunday Leader, Morning Leader and Irudina Sinhala weekly and set fire damaging printing machines and copies of newspapers printed ready for distribution. \nThe state jammed transmission of BBC programs which contained content the government disliked.\nThe main private TV network Sirasa was repeatedly threatened by minister Mervyn Silva, attacked by a petrol bomb on 2.1.2009 and raided by gunmen on 6.1.2009, who set on fire the main control room. This was in response to SLBC criticizing Sirasa's coverage of the capture of Kilinochchi.\n\nAccording to the head of the company, Chevaan Daniel: \"It's either that the citizens of Sri Lanka are able to drive around attacking institutions armed with weapons and grenades, or there is a hand behind it.\"\n\nLasantha Wickrematunge, the chief editor of the English Weekly Sunday Leader and Sri Lanka's most influential journalist, was assassinated on the Thursday January 8, 2009 by unknown gunmen. The newspaper and its editor as well as the editor of Morning Leader have been harassed and threatened continuously during the preceding three years. All Leader publications are very critical towards the government and exponents of opposition political views. According to Reporters without Borders, the Rajapaksa administration blocks investigations into the murder of journalists.\n\nDefence minister Gotabhaya Rajapaksa threatened to chase Chris Morris, a BBC journalists, out of the country, if he does not act responsibly.\n\nLocal reporters in the country continue to be threatened, as was the case with 54-year-old M.I. Rahmathulla, who was beaten in April 2009 for reporting on political corruption in the Batticaloa region of Sri Lanka's Eastern Province.\n\nImportant English language newspapers are the Sunday Leader \"Daily FT\", \"Daily Mirror\", the \"Daily News\", \"Sunday Observer\" and \"The Island\". Sinhalese newspapers are \"Dinamina\", \"Lankadeepa\", \"Lakbima\", and \"Divaena\". Tamil newspapers are \"Uthayan\", 'Tamil Mirror\" \"Thinakaran\", \"Thinakkural\", \"Sudar Oli\", \"Thinathanthi\", \"Metro\" and \"Virakesari\".\n\nRadio broadcasting in Sri Lanka dates back to 1923. Radio broadcasting, like other forms of media in the country, is generally divided along linguistic lines with state and private media operators providing services in Sinhala, Tamil, and English language.\n\nThe first Television network of Sri Lanka was launched on 13 April 1979. The ITN channel, owned by the Independent Television Network Limited (ITN) became the first terrestrial television channel of Sri Lanka. On June 5, 1979 ITN was converted to a government owned business and was later brought under the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Act of 1982 along with the newly created Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC).\n\nSignificant changes occurred in 1992 as the government permitted the establishment of private television networks. Subsequently, the Maharaja Television Network (MTV) was launched in collaboration with Singapore Telecommunications Limited (SingTel).\n\nSince then many new television networks have come into existence within Sri Lanka. There are also a number of Satellite networks and pay per view television networks in Sri Lanka such as Dialog TV which boasts over 500,000 subscribers in the country. The national telecommunications provider Sri Lanka Telecom also launched an IPTV service in 2008.\n\nSri Lankan cinema is a fledgling industry that has struggled to find a footing since its inauguration in 1947. Sri Lankan films are usually made in the Sinhalese language, the language of the majority Sinhala people.\n\nIn the first nine years most films were made in South India and followed the conventions of Indian cinema. Studio shooting was the norm, with Indian style sets erected in film studios. Even though it is popularly held that \"Rekava\", made in 1956 by pioneer director Lester James Peries, was the first Sinhala film to be shot completely out of studio, it was really the film \"Gambada Sundari\", made in 1950 which was the first film shot outside studios. It was also the first Sri Lankan film where, like in \"Rekawa\", the dialog was recorded on the spot. This was because the film was shot on 16mm, using an Auricon sound-on-film camera which recorded the sound on the 16mm film optically, unlike in the case of where the sound was recorded on a Kinevox 35mm magnetic recorder. The film was later 'blown-up' to 35mm and was screened in Colombo in 1950.\n\nThough \"Rekawa\" was acclaimed by local and international critics, the film failed to find an audience in the country and was a box office failure. Films continued to follow formulaic storylines borrowed from India up through the early 60s despite such efforts as \"Sandesaya\" and \"Kurulu Bedda\".\n\nArtists such as Tissa Abeysekara, Dr. D.B.Nihalsingha, Prasanna Vithanage and Vimukthi Jayasundara have attempted to breathe new life into the industry. Nihalsingha was an accomplished cinematographer as well as an editor: so his films has an input which was special and brought a viewpoint to all his films, most of which focused on the exploited women.\n\nVithanage's film \"Purahanda Kaluwara\" is widely considered one of the best movies made in Sri Lanka as is Jayasundara's \"Sulanga Enu Pinisa\" which won the coveted \"Camera d'Or\" for best first film at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nIn recent years, films have begun to tackle gritty subjects such as family relationships, abortion and results of the conflict between the military and Tamil Tiger rebels in the north. Director Asoka Handagama especially has drawn criticism for pursuing such material in his work.\n\nNumerous websites covering a wide range of topics, in addition to news and current affairs, exists. While all major newspaper have a web presence, many Sri Lankans turn to independent web publishers for their digital media needs.\n\n\n"}

Primero is closely related to the game of primo visto (a.k.a. prima-vista, and various other spellings), if not the same.\n\nThe gambling game with this name goes back to the 16th century, being known to Gerolamo Cardano as ', which he thought of as the noblest of all card games, to Fran√ßois Rabelais as ', and to Shakespeare as primero.\n\nIt still seems uncertain whether the game of primero is of Spanish or Italian origin. Although Daines Barrington is of the opinion that it is of Spanish origin, a poem of Francesco Berni is the earliest known writing to mention the game; it affords proof that it was at least commonly played in Italy at the beginning of the 16th century. His work entitled \"Capitolo del Gioco della Primiera\", published in Rome in 1526, and believed to be the earliest extant work describing a card game, contains some particulars on primero. According to David Parlett, the game's card-point system is found in other Italian games but nowhere else. The game is still very much played in central Europe and Spain with Italian-suited cards, under the name of \"goffo\" or \"bambara\", remaining the major native vying game of Italy. Alessandro Striggio's madrigal dramatizing a party of the game \"II gioco di primiera\" was published in 1569.\n\nThis old game of cards was called ' in France, ' in Spain, and ' in Italy. All names derived from the Latin ', 'first'. In English literature, besides the occasional use of the foreign names, the game is designated primero (and also prima-vista, a probable variant), with the usual corruptions in spelling of the early days.\n\nAccording to Stephen Skinner, primero and prima-vista are one and the same game. As for John Minshew, primero and prima-vista (', that is, first and first seen, because he that can show such an order of cards, wins the game), are two different games of cards.\n\nWhichever opinion these two seventeenth-century lexicographers might have had on the origin of primero, it seems fairly plausible that the game being played in different parts of Europe had to acquire similar names as it migrated from one country to another, or from one region to the other, notably in Italy and Spain. And with the addition of new rules to the original set of rules, or even variations on the rules that the game devised, it finally reached a level of development that made them become separate games, despite their common origin. So, as the Italian writer Berni said: \"The game is played differently in different places.\"\n\nDaines Barrington, described an Elizabethan card party painted by Federico Zuccari, and that originally belonged to Lord Falkland, in which Lord Burleigh is represented playing at cards with three other persons, apparently of distinction, each having two rings on the same fingers of both their hands. The cards used are marked as at present, although they differ from those of modern times for being narrower and longer. Eight of the cards lie on the table with the blank side uppermost, for the cards at that time had blank backs, while four remain in each of the other players hands. A particular in this painting is that one of the players is seen showing his cards, which are: the jack (knave) of hearts, the ace, 7 and 6 of clubs. The cover of the pack lying on the table displays two lions supporting a shield, upon which is what appears to be a heraldic rose (the crest of the Tudors), and underneath, though indistinctly, the partially illegible name of a French card-maker Jehan Licl**rer. This particular shows that the cards then used were at least sometimes obtained from France. The money on the table, together with considerable heaps of gold and silver, appears to be coins of Edward VI and Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nAs the first Marquess of Exeter, Lord Burleigh, is said to have entirely devoted his time to business and study, taking no diversion but that afforded by his gardens, of which he was both fond and proud, it is to be supposed that this painting was not actually a portrait of him, though mistaken for his, as was the ownership of the old manor-house of Wimbledon. So, there seems to be little doubt here as for which game the artist meant to describe, and that the person exhibiting his cards to the spectators had won a lush, for his three clubs are the best cards for counting.\n\nA passage in an old play by Robert Greene has been quoted by several writers as evidence that primero was a gambling game. But a person who objects to cards, might make such a remark with respect to any card game, whether a gambling game or not. Judging from the partial descriptions of the game which remain to us, it might seem that primero was played for either large or small stakes, as agreed upon. John Florio describes primero played by two persons for \"one shilling stake and three rest (pool).\" In Minsheu's \"Spanish Dialogues\", four play; the stake is two shillings and the rest, eight. The text is self-explanatory, explaining also the meaning of the name primero.\n\nPrimero appears to have been one of the earliest card games played in England during the Renaissance and the Tudor dynasty, and certainly it continued to be one of the most fashionable games throughout the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary I of England, Elizabeth I and James I, due to the frequent mention of it by many writers of that time. Already during the reign of Henry VII, notices of money issued several times for the King's losses at cards appear in the Remembrance's Office, dated December the 26th, in the ninth year of his reign. There, an entry is made of one hundred shillings paid at one time to him for the purpose of playing at cards. The private expenses of Princess Mary, Henry VIII's daughter and later Queen, also contain numerous items of money \"for the playe at cardes\". But despite the records, it is not certain that primero found its way to England previously to the marriage of Queen Mary I with Philip II of Spain, although there is no doubt that his coming to England from the court of Charles V would have cause it to be more generally known and played. William Shakespeare also speaks of Henry VIII playing at primero with his brother-in-law Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and makes Falstaff say: \"I never prospered since I forswore myself at primero.\" Additionally, the clown Lancelot in Shakespeare's \"The Merchant of Venice\" confides in this father that \"for mine own part, as I have set up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I have sun some ground\" (2.2.91-92). To \"set up [one's] rest\" alludes to a type of gamble in the Italian version of primero . Among the epigrams of John Harington we have one which describes \"The Story of Marcus' Life at Primero\", in which many of the terms of the game are developed in detail.\n\nJudging by the pattern of succession of games during the Renaissance, it is to be noted that many of the card games played throughout Europe, ascended in popularity to be later replaced by another type of game, again brought into England by the court gamester of that time. So that, by the last quarter of the 16th century, primero had already decreased in popularity, and was gradually replaced by the trick-taking game maw, the favorite card game of James I, and alluded by Harington as supplanting primero. According to Charles Cotton, primero, which by the time of the Restoration in 1660 had already evolved into many other variations, some of six cards, rapidly went out of fashion with the introduction of the Spanish game of Ombre.\n\nThe object of the game, as in poker, is to attain the highest possible hand, or at least bluff your competitors out of betting against you. There are no existing written rules for the 16th-century primero, only descriptions. However, a number of reconstructions of the game have been made, primarily on the basis of books describing playing strategy and references in period literature.\n\nPrimero is played with a 40-card deck, and there are special decks made for this game. It works best with four to six players. The player who holds the \"prime\", a sequence of the best cards and a good trump, is sure to be successful over the adversaries ‚Äì hence the game's name.\n\nBecause this is a gambling game, the first step is for all players to ante into the pot. The deal is counter-clockwise, starting with the dealer. Each player receives 4 cards dealt in 2's from a 40-card deck ranking K Q J 7 6 5 4 3 2 A. Anyone dealt a winning combination calls for an immediate showdown, and the player with the best hand wins the pot. Two cards go to each player, which is followed by the next phase of betting, and two more cards are dealt to each player. Then either eight cards are dealt face down on the table and the remaining cards are left out as a draw or stock pile.\n\nAlternatively, eight cards are laid out on the table and players may draw and discard from only these. When a player is satisfied with his cards, he may knock on the table, calling out: \"Vada\" (go!), which brings an immediate showdown won by the best hand. If no one bets, the stakes are carried forward to the next deal; but if one stays in, at least one other must contest the pot, this obligation ultimately falling upon the player immediately ahead of the last bettor if everyone else has folded. In a showdown, the better equal combinations are those with the highest point. Thus, a quartet of aces (4x16=64) beats a quartet of 5s (60), but it's beaten by four 6s (72). Four kings will not beat four queens or jacks, as these hands all count 40. Such ties are broken in favor of the eldest hand competing.\n\nPlayers \"vie\" or \"vye\" by stating how high a hand they are claiming to have, and may \"bluff\" by overstating it. What they apparently must not do is to underbid their hands; for as Cardano puts it: \"If anyone wins with the greatest point, he is obliged to show another card; otherwise he loses his deposit because he could have a 'Flush'... Similarly, if he 'vies' on the basis of point, he is obliged to show two different cards and one of a matching suit, so that no one may suspect him of having a 'Flush' or 'Prime'.\"\n\nA player may either knock or draw in a turn, but not both. Once a player knocks, he may no longer draw. When two players have knocked, the play stops, and cards are shown. Betting starts after the two cards are dealt, and may continue after these two cards have been dealt, and then at every round, just before the dealer's turn. The dealer always bets first. Players may match, raise, or fold any time during wagering. If all players refuse a bet, it must be withdrawn.\n\nIn Rome, the full 52-card deck was used. In Florence, it is custom to leave out the 7s, 8s and 9s, keeping and vying only with the smaller cards; the \"rest\" (\"to set up a rest\" means 'to win [something]', and is a phrase which occurs in almost every poem in the times of James and Charles. It is taken from terms used at primero, and perhaps other games then played) is made at the second card, and when the first player say \"pass\", every one is obliged to discard, notwithstanding any one may have an ace or a 6 in hand. In Venice, for instance, the mode of playing may be different; in Lombardy, Naples, France and Spain, so many countries, so many customs. But of all the modes, none can be superior to that of the court of Rome. There, the 7s, 8s and 9s are not withdrawn; there it is allowed to discard, but not both cards after \"pass\" is once said; nor can this be done with the two cards of the \"rest\", as it is usual in other places. The most essential operation of this game may be its two principal hands, the \"flush\" and the ', and a third, derived from the first, which is called '; from these three are deducted all the varieties which daily occur at primero, as the greater and lesser \"flush\", the great and little \"prime\", and more or less points; this diversity gives rise to numerous controversies and disputable points. Another excellent hand in this game is four-of-a-kind; four court cards, four aces, etc., beat both the flush and \".\n\nJacob Le Duchat, in a note on that chapter of Rabelais, in which the games Gargantua played at are enumerated, has described the mode of playing primero, and a similar account may be gathered from the \"Dictionary of the Spanish Academy.\" According to Duchat, there are two kinds of primero, the greater and the lesser; the difference between them is that the former is played with the figured cards, while at the latter the highest card is the 7, which counts for 21. Each player has four cards, which are dealt one by one. the next card in value to the 7 is the 6, which counts for 18; then the 6, which counts for 15. The ace is equivalent to 6 points, but the 2 (deuce), the 3 (trey) and the 4 count only for their respective numbers. To these cards may be added, if the players choose, the \"\", for which the jack of hearts is most commonly chosen, and of which he may make what card and what colour he likes. After which each of the players show their four cards, and he whose cards are all of different sorts wins the prime, if they are all of one colour he wins the Flush.\nMeanwhile, according to the \"Great Spanish Dictionary\", is played by dealing four cards to each player; the value of the 7, 6 and ace, are the same; but the 2 is said to count for 12, the 3 for 13, the 4 for 14, and the 5 for 15, the figured cards are each equivalent to 10. The best hand is the flush, that is, four cards of high numbers and one of one colour; the next is the '(supremus), consisting of the , 7, 6, and ace, which count for 55; then the , or prime, which is four cards of different suits. Should two persons have flushes, the player who counts the highest number, or the greatest flush wins, and the same regulation holds good in regard to the prime. But should there be neither flush nor prime, the one who can count the most points in one suit wins.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2969247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2969247", "title": "Quantum of Solace", "text": "Quantum of Solace\n\nQuantum of Solace is a 2008 British spy film, the twenty-second in the \"James Bond\" series produced by Eon Productions, directed by Marc Forster and written by Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. It is the second film to star Daniel Craig as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. The film also stars Olga Kurylenko, Mathieu Amalric, Gemma Arterton, Jeffrey Wright, and Judi Dench. In the film, Bond seeks revenge for the death of his lover, Vesper Lynd, and is assisted by Camille Montes, who is plotting revenge for the murder of her own family. The trail eventually leads them to wealthy businessman Dominic Greene, a member of the Quantum organisation, who intends to stage a \"coup d'√©tat\" in Bolivia to seize control of their water supply.\n\nProducer Michael G. Wilson developed the film's plot while the previous film in the series, \"Casino Royale\", was being shot. Purvis, Wade, and Haggis contributed to the script. Craig and Forster had to write some sections themselves due to the Writers' Strike, though they were not given the screenwriter credit in the final cut. The title was chosen from a 1959 short story in Ian Fleming's \"For Your Eyes Only\", though the film does not contain any elements of that story. Location filming took place in Mexico, Panama, Chile, Italy, Austria and Wales, while interior sets were built and filmed at Pinewood Studios. Forster aimed to make a modern film that also featured classic cinema motifs: a vintage Douglas DC-3 was used for a flight sequence, and Dennis Gassner's set designs are reminiscent of Ken Adam's work on several early \"Bond\" films. Taking a course away from the usual Bond villains, Forster rejected any grotesque appearance for the character Dominic Greene to emphasise the hidden and secret nature of the film's contemporary villains.\n\nThe film was also marked by its frequent depictions of violence, with a 2012 study by the University of Otago in New Zealand finding it to be the most violent film in the franchise. Whereas \"Dr. No\" featured 109 \"trivial or severely violent\" acts, \"Quantum of Solace\" had a count of 250‚Äîthe most depictions of violence in any \"Bond\" film‚Äîeven more prominent since it was also the shortest film in the franchise. \"Quantum of Solace\" premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square on 29 October 2008, gathering mixed reviews, which mainly praised Craig's gritty performance and the film's action sequences, but felt that the film was less impressive than its predecessor \"Casino Royale\". , it is the fourth-highest-grossing \"James Bond\" film, without adjusting for inflation, earning $586¬†million worldwide, and becoming the seventh highest-grossing film of 2008.\n\nJames Bond is driving from Lake Garda to Siena, Italy, with the captured Mr. White (Jesper Christensen) in the boot of his car. After evading pursuers, Bond delivers White to M, who interrogates him regarding his organisation, Quantum. M's bodyguard, Craig Mitchell (Glenn Foster), is a double agent; he attacks M, enabling White to escape. Bond chases Mitchell and kills him. Bond and M return to London and search Mitchell's flat, discovering Mitchell had a contact in Haiti, Edmund Slate (Neil Jackson). Bond learns Slate is a hitman sent to kill Camille Montes (Olga Kurylenko) at the behest of her lover, environmentalist entrepreneur Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric). Observing her subsequent meeting with Greene, Bond learns Greene is helping exiled Bolivian General Medrano (Joaqu√≠n Cos√≠o), who murdered Camille's family, to overthrow his government and become the new president, in exchange for a seemingly barren piece of desert.\n\nAfter rescuing Camille from Medrano, Bond follows Greene to a performance of \"Tosca\" in Bregenz, Austria. Meanwhile, the head of the CIA's South American section, Gregg Beam (David Harbour), strikes a noninterference deal with Greene for access to putative stocks of Bolivian oil. Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, identifying members of Quantum's executive board, and a gunfight ensues. A Special Branch bodyguard working for Quantum member Guy Haines (Paul Ritter), is killed by one of Greene's men after Bond throws him off a roof. M assumes Bond killed him, and has Bond's passports and credit cards revoked. Bond heads to Italy and convinces his old ally Ren√© Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) to accompany him to Bolivia. They are greeted by Strawberry Fields (Gemma Arterton), a consular employee who demands Bond return to the UK immediately. Bond seduces her and they attend a fundraising party Greene holds that night. At the party, Bond again rescues Camille from Greene. Leaving, Bond and Camille are pulled over by Bolivian police working for Medrano. They had earlier attacked Mathis and put him in the boot of Bond's car to frame Bond. In the ensuing struggle, Mathis and the cops are killed.\n\nThe following day, Bond and Camille survey Quantum's intended land acquisition by air; their plane is shot down by a Bolivian fighter aircraft. They skydive into a sinkhole, and discover Quantum is damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water to create a monopoly. Back in La Paz, Bond meets M and learns Quantum killed Fields by drowning her in crude oil. Bond meets CIA Agent Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), who discloses Greene and Medrano will meet in the Atacama Desert to finalise their agreement. Warned by Leiter, he evades the CIA's Special Activities Division when they attempt to kill him.\n\nAt an eco hotel in the desert, Greene tells Medrano that now he controls the majority of Bolivia's water supply, Medrano must accept a new contract that makes Greene Planet Bolivia's sole water utility company at significantly higher rates. Bond infiltrates the complex, kills the chief of police (Fernando Guill√©n Cuervo) for betraying Mathis, and single-handedly assaults the hotel. After killing the security detail, he confronts Greene. Meanwhile, Camille kills Medrano, avenging the murders of her family. The struggle leaves the hotel destroyed by fire. Bond captures Greene and interrogates him about Quantum, leaving him stranded in the desert with only a can of engine oil, wondering if Greene will get thirsty enough to drink it.\n\nBond travels to Kazan, Russia, where he finds Vesper Lynd's former lover, Yusef Kabira (Simon Kassianides), a member of Quantum who seduces women with valuable connections, and who is indirectly responsible for her death. Bond tells Kabira's latest target, Corrine Veneau (Stana Katic), a Canadian Intelligence agent, of Kabira's true intentions, thus sparing her Vesper's fate. He allows MI6 to arrest Kabira. Outside, M tells Bond that Greene was found dead in the middle of the desert, shot twice and with engine oil in his stomach. M tells Bond she needs him back; he responds that he never left. Walking away, he drops Vesper's necklace in the snow.\n\n\nMarc Forster asked his friends and fellow directors Guillermo del Toro and Alfonso Cuar√≥n to appear in cameos. Cuar√≥n appears as a Bolivian helicopter pilot, while del Toro provides several other voices.\n\nIn July 2006, as \"Casino Royale\" entered post-production, Eon Productions announced that the next film would be based on an original idea by producer Michael G. Wilson. It was decided beforehand the film would be a direct sequel, to exploit Bond's emotions following Vesper's death in the previous film. Just as \"Casino Royale\" theme was terrorism, the sequel focuses on environmentalism. The film was confirmed for a 2 May 2008 release date, with Craig reprising the lead role. Roger Michell, who directed Craig in \"Enduring Love\" and \"The Mother\", was in negotiations to direct, but opted out because there was no script. Sony Entertainment vice-chairman Jeff Blake admitted a production schedule of 18 months was a very short window, and the release date was pushed back to late 2008. Neal Purvis and Robert Wade completed their draft of the script by April 2007, and Paul Haggis, who polished the \"Casino Royale\" script, began his rewrite the next month.\n\nIn June 2007, Marc Forster was confirmed as director. He was surprised that he was approached for the job, stating he was not a big Bond film fan through the years, and that he would not have accepted the project had he not seen \"Casino Royale\" prior to making his decision: he felt Bond had been humanised in that film, arguing since travelling the world had become less exotic since the series' advent, it made sense to focus more on Bond as a character. Born in Germany and raised in Switzerland, Forster was the first Bond director not to come from the British Commonwealth of Nations, although he noted Bond's mother is Swiss, making him somewhat appropriate to handle the British icon. The director collaborated strongly with Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, noting they only blocked two very expensive ideas he had. The director found \"Casino Royale\"s 144-minute running time too long, and wanted his follow-up to be \"tight and fast ‚Ä¶ like a bullet.\"\n\nHaggis, Forster and Wilson rewrote the story from scratch. Haggis said he completed his script two hours before the 2007‚Äì2008 Writers Guild of America strike officially began. Forster noted a running theme in his films were emotionally repressed protagonists, and the theme of the picture would be Bond learning to trust after feeling betrayed by Vesper. Forster said he created the Camille character as a strong female counterpart to Bond rather than a casual love interest: she openly shows emotions similar to those which Bond experiences but is unable to express. Haggis located his draft's climax in the Swiss Alps, but Forster wanted the action sequences to be based around the four classical elements of earth, water, air and fire. The decision to homage Oddjob's murder of Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton) in \"Goldfinger\" in Fields's death came about as Forster wanted to show oil had replaced gold as the most precious material. The producers rejected Haggis's idea that Vesper Lynd had a child, because \"Bond was an orphan ‚Ä¶ Once he finds the kid, Bond can't just leave the kid.\" The water supply issue in Bolivia was the main theme of the film, with a story based on the Cochabamba Water Revolt.\n\nMichael G. Wilson decided on the film's title \"Quantum of Solace\" only \"a few days\" before its announcement on 24 January 2008. It was the name of a short story in Ian Fleming's anthology \"For Your Eyes Only\" (1960). The film is related to the title in one of its thematic elements: \"when the 'Quantum of Solace' drops to zero, humanity and consideration of one human for another is gone.\" Daniel Craig admitted, \"I was unsure at first. Bond is looking for his quantum of solace and that's what he wants, he wants his closure. Ian Fleming says that if you don't have a quantum of solace in your relationship then the relationship is over. It's that spark of niceness in a relationship that if you don't have you might as well give up.\" He said that \"Bond doesn't have that because his girlfriend [Vesper Lynd] has been killed,\" and therefore, \"[Bond is] looking for revenge ‚Ä¶ to make himself happy with the world again.\" Afterwards, Quantum was made the name of the organisation introduced in \"Casino Royale\". Craig noted the letter Q itself looks rather odd. Near the end of the film, the Camille Montes character and Bond have a discussion about their individual quests to avenge the deaths of their loved ones. Montes asks Bond to \"let me know what it feels like\" when he succeeds, the implication of the title being that it will be a small amount of solace compared to his despair. Bond's lack of emotion when he does exact revenge shows this to be the case.\n\nAccording to a December 2011 interview with Craig, \"We had the bare bones of a script and then there was a writers' strike and there was nothing we could do. We couldn't employ a writer to finish it. I say to myself, 'Never again', but who knows? There was me trying to rewrite scenes‚Äîand a writer I am not.\" He said that he and Forster \"were the ones allowed to do it. The rules were that you couldn't employ anyone as a writer, but the actor and director could work on scenes together. We were stuffed. We got away with it, but only just. It was never meant to be as much of a sequel as it was, but it ended up being a sequel, starting where the last one finished.\"\n\nDuring filming, after the strike ended, Forster read a spec script by Joshua Zetumer, which he liked, and hired him to reshape scenes for the later parts of the shoot, which the director was still unsatisfied with. Forster had the actors rehearse their scenes, as he liked to film scenes continually. Zetumer rewrote dialogue depending on the actors' ideas each day.\n\n\"Quantum of Solace\" was shot in six countries. Second unit filming began in Italy at the Palio di Siena horse race on 16 August 2007, although at that point Forster was unsure how it would fit into the film. Some scenes were filmed also in Maratea and Craco, two small distinctive towns in Basilicata in southern Italy. Other places used for location shooting were Madrid in August 2007; Baja California, Mexico in early 2008, for shots of the aerial battle; Malcesine, Limone sul Garda and Tremosine in Italy during March, and at Talamone during the end of April. The main unit began on 3 January 2008 at Pinewood Studios. The 007 Stage was used for the fight in the art gallery, and an MI6 safehouse hidden within the city's cisterns, while other stages housed Bond's Bolivian hotel suite, and the MI6 headquarters. Interior and exterior airport scenes were filmed at Farnborough Airfield and the snowy closing scenes were filmed at the Bruneval Barracks in Aldershot.\n\nShooting in Panama City began on 7 February 2008 at Howard Air Force Base. The country doubled for Haiti and Bolivia, with the National Institute of Culture of Panama standing in for a hotel in the latter country. A sequence requiring several hundred extras was also shot at nearby Col√≥n. Shooting in Panama was also carried out at Fort Sherman, a former US military base on the Col√≥n coast. Forster was disappointed he could only shoot the boat chase in that harbour, as he had a more spectacular vision for the scene. Officials in the country worked with the locals to \"minimise inconvenience\" for the cast and crew, and in return hoped the city's exposure in the film would increase tourism. The crew was going to move to Cusco, Peru for ten days of filming on 2 March, but the location was cancelled for budget reasons. Twelve days of filming in Chile began on 24 March at Antofagasta. There was shooting in Cobija, the Paranal Observatory, and other locations in the Atacama Desert. Forster chose the desert and the observatory's ESO Hotel to represent Bond's rigid emotions, and being on the verge of committing a vengeful act as he confronts Greene in the film's climax.\n\nDuring filming in Sierra Gorda, Chile, the local mayor, Carlos Lopez, staged a protest because he was angry at the filmmakers' portrayal of the Antofagasta Region as part of Bolivia. He was arrested, detained briefly, and put on trial two days later. Eon dismissed his claim that they needed his permission to film in the area. Michael G. Wilson explained that Bolivia was appropriate to the plot, because of the country's history of water problems, and was surprised the two countries disliked each other a century after the War of the Pacific. In a poll by Chilean daily newspaper \"La Segunda\", 75% of its readers disagreed with Lopez's actions, due to the negative image of Chile they felt it presented, and the controversy's potential to put off productions looking to film in the country in the future.\n\nFrom 4‚Äì12 April the main unit shot on Sienese rooftops. Shooting on the real rooftops turned out to be less expensive than building them at Pinewood. The next four weeks were scheduled for filming the car chase at Lake Garda and Carrara. On 19 April, an Aston Martin employee driving a DBS to the set crashed into the lake. He survived, and was fined ¬£400 for reckless driving. Another accident occurred on 21 April, and two days later, two stuntmen were seriously injured, with one, Greek stuntman Aris Comninos, having to be put in intensive care. Filming of the scenes was temporarily halted so that Italian police could investigate the causes of the accidents. Stunt co-ordinator Gary Powell said the accidents were a testament to the realism of the action. Rumours of a \"curse\" spread among tabloid media, something which deeply offended Craig, who disliked that they compared Comninos' accident to something like his minor finger injury later on the shoot (also part of the \"curse\"). Comninos recovered safely from his injury.\n\nFor the role Craig trained to be less bulky than in \"Casino Royale\" and told \"Men's Fitness\" magazine \"In fact, I was much fitter for this film compared to \"Casino Royale\"‚ÄîI really had to be‚Äîand I was running a hell of a lot more in training, just so I could do these scenes, whereas last time I spent far more time pumping heavy weights to bulk up so I could look big.\"\n\nFilming took place at the floating opera stage at Bregenz, Austria, from 28 April ‚Äì 9 May 2008. The sequence in which Bond stalks the villains during a performance of \"Tosca\" required 1,500 extras. The production used a large model of an eye, which Forster felt fitted in the Bond style, and the opera itself has parallels to the film. A short driving sequence was filmed at the nearby Feldkirch, Vorarlberg. The crew returned to Italy from 13‚Äì17 May to shoot a (planned) car crash at the marble quarry in Carrara, and a recreation of the Palio di Siena at the Piazza del Campo in Siena. 1,000 extras were hired for a scene where Bond emerges from the \"Fonte Gaia\". Originally, he would have emerged from the city's cisterns at Siena Cathedral, but this was thought disrespectful. By June the crew returned to Pinewood for four weeks, where new sets (including the interior of the hotel in the climax) were built. The wrap party was held on 21 June.\n\nProduction designer Peter Lamont, a crew member on 18 previous Bond films, retired after \"Casino Royale\". Forster hired Dennis Gassner in his stead, having admired his work on \"The Truman Show\" and the films of the Coen brothers. Craig said the film would have \"a touch of Ken Adam,\" while Michael G. Wilson also called Gassner's designs \"a postmodern look at modernism.\" Forster said he felt the early Bond films' design \"were ahead of their time,\" and enjoyed the clashing of an older style with his own because it created a unique look unto itself. Gassner wanted his sets to emphasise Craig's \"great angular, textured face and wonderful blue eyes,\" and totally redesigned the MI6 headquarters because he felt Judi Dench \"was a bit tired in the last film, so I thought, let's bring her into a new world.\"\n\nLouise Frogley replaced Lindy Hemming as costume designer, though Hemming remained as supervisor. Hemming hired Brioni for Bond's suits since her tenure on the series began with 1995's \"GoldenEye\", but Lindsay Pugh, another supervisor, explained their suits were \"too relaxed.\" Tom Ford was hired to tailor \"sharper\" suits for Craig. Pugh said the costumes aimed towards the 1960s feel, especially for Bond and Fields. Prada provided the dresses for both Bond girls. Jasper Conran designed Camille's ginger bandeau, bronze skirt and gold fish necklace, while Chrome Hearts designed gothic jewellery for Amalric's character, which the actor liked enough to keep after filming. Sophie Harley, who created Vesper Lynd's earrings and Algerian loveknot necklace in \"Casino Royale\", was called upon to create another version of the necklace.\n\nThe film returns to the traditional gun barrel opening shot, which was altered into part of the story for \"Casino Royale\" where it was moved to the beginning of the title sequence. In this film the gun barrel sequence was moved to the end of the movie, which Wilson explained was done for a surprise, and to signify the conclusion of the story begun in the previous film. The opening credits sequence was created by MK12. Having worked on Forster's \"Stranger than Fiction\" and \"The Kite Runner\", MK12 spontaneously began developing the sequence early on in production, and had a good idea of its appearance which meant it did not have to be redone when the title singer was changed. MK12 selected various twilight colours to represent Bond's mood and focused on a dot motif based on the gunbarrel shot. MK12 also worked on scenes with graphical user interface, including the electronic table MI6 use, and the Port-au-Prince, Haiti title cards.\n\n\"Quantum of Solace\" was the last in Ford Motor's three-film deal that began with 2002's \"Die Another Day\". Although Ford sold over 90% of the Aston Martin company in 2007, the Aston Martin DBS V12 returned for the film's car chase around Lake Garda; Dan Bradley was hired as second unit director because of his work on the second and third \"Bourne\" films, so the film would continue the gritty action style begun in \"Casino Royale\". He had intended to use Ford GTs for the opening chase, but it was replaced by the Alfa Romeo 159. After location filming in Italy, further close-ups of Craig, the cars and the truck were shot at Pinewood against a blue screen. Originally three Alfa Romeos were in the sequence: but Forster felt the scene was running too long and re-edited the scene so it only looked like two Alfas were chasing Bond. Six Aston Martins were destroyed during filming, and one of them was purchased by a fan.\n\nFourteen cameras were used to film the Palio di Siena footage, which was later edited into the main sequence. Aerial shots using helicopters were banned, and the crew were also forbidden from showing any violence \"involving either people or animals.\" To shoot the foot chase in Siena in April 2008 four camera cranes were built in the town, and a cable camera was also used. Framestore worked on the Siena chase, duplicating the 1,000 extras during principal photography to match shots of the 40,000-strong audience at the real Palio, removing wires that held Craig and the stuntmen in the rooftop segment of the chase, and digital expansion of the floor and skylight in the art gallery Bond and Mitchell fall into. The art gallery fight was intended to be simple, but during filming Craig's stunt double accidentally fell from the construction scaffolding. Forster preferred the idea of Bond hanging from ropes reaching for his gun to kill Mitchell, rather than having both men run out of the building to continue their chase as specified in the script, and the number of effects shots increased.\n\nTo film the aerial dogfight, a \"Snakehead\" camera was built and placed on the nose and tail of a Piper Aerostar 700. SolidWorks, who provided the software used to design the camera, stated \"pilots for the first time can fly as aggressively as they dare without sacrificing the drama of the shot.\" The camera could turn 360 degrees and was shaped like a periscope. The crew also mounted SpaceCams on helicopters, and placed cameras with 1600mm lenses underground, to cover the action. Forster wanted to film the plane fight as a homage to Alfred Hitchcock's \"North by Northwest\", and chose planes like the Douglas DC-3 to suit that.\n\nThe free-fall scene involved its own set of challenges; Craig disliked the idea of \"being hung by wires and blown by a large fan in front of a green screen\", but actual sky diving coverage has serious drawbacks. It's not only difficult, dangerous and time-consuming, but nearly always results in problematic head-replacements for close-ups. Stunt co-ordinator Gary Powell and VFX Designer Kevin Tod Haug presented the idea of filming the scene in a large vertical wind tunnel in Bedford to do this sequence as practically as possible.\nWhile a great solution for the actors' performances, the technique presented enormous VFX challenges: relighting shots captured in a tall white tube to match the sky over the Bolivian desert; and the impossibility of filming medium to wide shots of the actors. An array of eight Dalsa Origin cameras (supported by seven HD cameras and a 35mm hand-held camera, all running in sync) was used to create a virtual camera with which to shoot the actors floating in the simulator. Ged Wright and his team at Double Negative developed a method to use the data from these cameras that allowed these real performances to be placed in a synthetic environment as seen by a synthetic camera.\nDuring the shooting in the wind tunnel Craig and Kurylenko wore wind-resistant contact lenses that enabled them to open their eyes as they fell. For safety and comfort, they only shot for 30 seconds at a time. Forster wished he had had more time to work on the free-fall scene.\n\nThe Moving Picture Company created the climactic hotel sequence. The fire effects were supervised by Chris Corbould, and post-production MPC had to enhance the sequence by making the smoke look closer to the actors, so it would look more dangerous. A full-scale replica of the building's exterior was used for the exploding part Bond and Camille escape from.\nThe boat chase was another scene that required very little CGI. Machine FX worked on replacing a few shots of visible stuntmen with a digital version of Craig's head, and recreated the boats Bond jumps over on his motorcycle to make it look more dangerous. Crowd creation was done for the \"Tosca\" scene by Machine FX, to make the performance look like it had sold out. Forster edited the opera scene to resemble \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\". In total, there are 900+ visual effects shots in \"Quantum of Solace\".\n\nDavid Arnold, who composed the scores for the previous four Bond films, returned for \"Quantum of Solace\". He said that Forster likes to work very closely with his composers and that, in comparison to the accelerated schedule he was tied to on \"Casino Royale\", the intention was to spend a long time scoring the film to \"really work it out.\" He also said he would be \"taking a different approach\" with the score. Arnold composed the music based on impressions from reading the script, and Forster edited those into the film. As with \"Casino Royale\", Arnold kept use of the \"James Bond Theme\" to a minimum. Arnold collaborated with Kieran Hebden for \"Crawl, End Crawl,\" a remix of the score played during the end credits.\n\nJack White of The White Stripes and Alicia Keys collaborated on \"Another Way to Die,\" the first Bond music duet. They had wanted to work together for two years beforehand. The song was recorded in Nashville, Tennessee; White played the drums while Keys performed on the piano. The Memphis Horns also contributed to the track. White's favourite Bond theme is John Barry's instrumental piece for \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", and he watched various opening credit sequences from the series for inspiration while mixing the track. Mark Ronson and Amy Winehouse had recorded a demo track for the film, but Ronson explained Winehouse's well-publicised legal issues in the preceding weeks made her \"not ready to record any music\" at that time.\n\nThe film premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square on 29 October 2008. Princes William and Harry attended, and proceeds from the screening were donated to the charities Help for Heroes and the Royal British Legion. The film was originally scheduled to be released in the UK and North America on 7 November; however, Eon pushed forward the British date to 31 October during filming, while the American date was pushed back in August to 14 November, after \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" had been moved to 2009, thereby allowing the distributors to market the film over the autumn blockbuster Thanksgiving holiday weekend. In Australia, the film was moved a week to 19 November, after 20th Century Fox chose to release \"Australia\" on \"Quantum of Solace\"s original date of 26 November.\n\nReturning product placement partners from \"Casino Royale\" included Ford, Heineken, Smirnoff, Omega SA, Virgin Atlantic and Sony Ericsson. A reported ¬£50¬†million was earned in product placement, which tops the Bond films' record of ¬£44¬†million for \"Die Another Day\". The 2009 Ford Ka is driven by Camille in the film. Avon created a fragrance called Bond Girl 007 with Gemma Arterton as the \"face\" of the product. Coca-Cola became a promotional partner, rebranding Coke Zero as \"Coke Zero Zero 7.\" A tie-in advert featured the orchestral element of \"Another Way to Die.\" In the film, Coca-Cola was briefly seen being served at Dominic Greene's party. Sony held a competition, \"Mission for a Million,\" enabling registered players to use their products to complete certain tasks. Each completed \"mission\" gave consumers a chance to win $1¬†million and a trip to a top-secret location.\n\nCorgi International Limited made 5-inch action figures and gadgets (such as a voice-activated briefcase), as well as its traditional die-cast toy vehicles. It also created 7-inch figures of characters from the previous films. Scalextric released four racing sets to coincide with the film. Activision released its first James Bond game, also titled \"Quantum of Solace\", which is based on both \"Casino Royale\" and \"Quantum of Solace\". It is the first Bond game to feature Craig's likeness and the first seventh-generation console game in the series. Swatch designed a series of wrist watches, each of them inspired by a Bond villain.\n\nThough the screenplay did not get made into a novel despite its original storyline, Penguin Books published a compilation of Fleming's short stories entitled \"Quantum of Solace: The Complete James Bond Short Stories\", with a UK release date of 29 May 2008 and a North American release date of 26 August 2008. The book combines the contents of Fleming's two short story collections, \"For Your Eyes Only\"‚Äîincluding the original \"Quantum of Solace\" short story‚Äîand \"Octopussy and The Living Daylights\".\n\n\"Quantum of Solace\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray by MGM via 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in Australia, the UK and North America from 18 to 24 March 2009. On the DVD sales chart the film opened at No. 3, grossing $21,894,957 from 1.21m DVD units sold. , 2,643,250 DVD units were sold, generating $44,110,750 in sales revenue. These figures do not include Blu-ray sales or DVD rentals. The DVDs were released in both a standard one-disc set and a deluxe two-disc special edition. There are no audio commentaries or deleted scenes on these editions.\n\nUpon its opening in the UK, the film grossed ¬£4.9¬†million ($8¬†million), breaking the record for the largest Friday opening (31 October 2008) in the UK. The film then broke the UK opening-weekend record, taking ¬£15.5¬†million ($25¬†million) in its first weekend, surpassing the previous record of ¬£14.9¬†million held by \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\". It earned a further ¬£14¬†million in France and Sweden‚Äîwhere it opened on the same day. The weekend gross of the equivalent of $10.6¬†million in France was a record for the series, surpassing what \"Casino Royale\" made in five days by 16%. The $2.7¬†million gross in Sweden was the fourth-highest opening for a film there.\n\nThe following week, the film was playing in sixty countries. It grossed the equivalent of $39.3¬†million in the UK, $16.5¬†million in France and $7.7¬†million in Germany on 7 November 2008. The film broke records in Switzerland, Finland, United Arab Emirates, Nigeria, Romania and Slovenia. Its Chinese and Indian openings were the second-largest ever for foreign-language films.\n\nThe film grossed $27¬†million on its opening day in 3,451 cinemas in Canada and the United States, where it was the number one film for the weekend, with $67.5¬†million and $19,568 average per cinema. It was the highest-grossing opening weekend \"Bond\" film in the US, and tied with \"The Incredibles\" for the biggest November opening outside of the \"Harry Potter\" series. The film earned a B- from CinemaScore's audience surveys. From the British opening on 31 October, through to the US opening weekend on 14 November, the film had grossed a total $319,128,882 worldwide. As of 10 February 2010, it had grossed the equivalent of $417,722,300 in countries other than Canada and the US, where it grossed $168,368,427, to give a total of $586,090,727.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 65% based on 285 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Brutal and breathless, \"Quantum Of Solace\" delivers tender emotions along with frenetic action, but coming on the heels of \"Casino Royale\", it's still a bit of a disappointment.\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100 based on 48 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Critics generally preferred \"Casino Royale\", but continued to praise Daniel Craig's depiction of Bond, and agree that the film is still an enjoyable addition to the series. The action sequences and pacing were praised, but criticism grew over the realism and serious but gritty feel that the film carried over.\n\nRoger Moore, the third actor to play Bond in the films, said that Daniel Craig was a \"damn good Bond but the film as a whole, there was a bit too much flash cutting [and] it was just like a commercial of the action. There didn't seem to be any geography and you were wondering what the hell was going on.\" Kim Newman of \"Empire\" gave it 4/5, remarking it was not \"bigger and better than \"Casino Royale\", [which is] perhaps a smart move in that there's still a sense at the finish that Bond's mission has barely begun.\" However, he expressed nostalgia for the more humorous Bond films. \"The Sunday Times\" review noted that \"following \"Casino Royale\" was never going to be easy, but the director Marc Forster has brought the brand's successful relaunch crashing back to earth‚Äîwith a yawn\"; the screenplay \"is at times incomprehensible\" and the casting \"is a mess.\" The review concludes that \"Bond has been stripped of his iconic status. He no longer represents anything particularly British, or even modern. In place of glamour, we get a spurious grit; instead of style, we get product placement; in place of fantasy, we get a redundant and silly realism.\" \"The Guardian\" gave a more positive review, rating it as 4 stars, and was particularly fond of Daniel Craig's performance, saying he \"made the part his own, every inch the coolly ruthless agent-killer, nursing a broken heart and coldly suppressed rage\" and calling the film \"a crash-bang Bond, high on action, low on quips, long on location glamour, short on product placement\"; it concludes \"\"Quantum of Solace\" isn't as good as \"Casino Royale\": the smart elegance off Daniel Craig's Bond debut has been toned down in favour of conventional action. But the man himself powers this movie; he carries the film: it's an indefinably difficult task for an actor. Craig measures up.\"\n\n\"Screen Daily\" says, \"Notices will focus‚Äîrightly‚Äîon Craig's magnetism as the steely, sexy, murderous MI6 agent, but two other factors weigh in and freshen up proceedings: Forster's new technical team, led by cinematographer Roberto Schaefer and production designer Dennis Gassner. And the ongoing shift of M, as played by Judi Dench, to front and centre: the Bond girls fade into insignificance as she becomes his moral counterpoint and theirs is the only real relationship on screen.\" The review continues, \"Bond is, as has been previously noted, practically the Martin Scorsese of the BAFTAs: 22 films later, with grosses probably close to the GDP of one of the small nations it depicts, it's still waiting for that Alexander Korda award. The best \"Casino Royale\" could achieve was a gong for sound. Will this be the year that changes its fortunes?\" Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", who praised the previous film, disliked \"Quantum of Solace\". He wrote that the plot was mediocre, characters weak and that Bond lacked his usual personality, despite his praise for Daniel Craig's interpretation of the role. Throughout his review, he emphasised that \"James Bond is not an action hero.\" Kate Muir wrote in \"The Times\" that \"The \"Bond\" franchise is 50 years old this year, and the scriptless mess of \"Quantum of Solace\" may be considered its mid-life crisis\", before she went on to praise the film's successor \"Skyfall\" as a \"resurrection\". Some writers criticised the choice of \"Quantum of Solace\" as a title. \"Yes, it's a bad title,\" wrote Marni Weisz, the editor of \"Famous\", a Canadian film publication distributed in cinemas in that country, in an editorial entitled \"At least it's not \"Octopussy\".\"\n\nNot all the reviews were as critical. Tim Robey of \"The Daily Telegraph\", in a reflective review of the film in 2013, was positive. He praised the film's shorter runtime, claiming that many other \"Bond\" films run out of steam before the end, and included \"Casino Royale\" in this category. Describing the film as having a \"rock-solid dramatic idea and the intelligence to run with it\", he gave the film four stars out of five.\n\nThe film was nominated for Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Visual Effects, Film and Sound Editing at the 2008 Satellite Awards, winning Best Song. It was nominated for Best Action Movie at the 2009 Critics' Choice Awards, and at the Empire Awards, which is voted for by the public, it was shortlisted for Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Newcomer, Best Thriller and Best Soundtrack. It was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film, while Kurylenko and Dench were both nominated for the Best Supporting Actress award. It was nominated by the Visual Effects Society Awards for \"Outstanding Compositing in a Feature Motion Picture.\"\n\nAn editorial by \"The Times\" also listed the film's pre-titles sequence as the tenth-greatest car chase in film history.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1255024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1255024", "title": "The Hebrew Hammer", "text": "The Hebrew Hammer\n\nThe Hebrew Hammer is a 2003 American comedy film written and directed by Jonathan Kesselman. It stars Adam Goldberg, Judy Greer, Andy Dick, Mario Van Peebles, and Peter Coyote. The plot concerns a Jewish blaxploitation crime fighter known as the Hebrew Hammer who must save Hanukkah from the evil son of Santa Claus, who wants to destroy Hanukkah and Kwanzaa and make everyone celebrate Christmas.\n\nThe film parodies blaxploitation films, and features Melvin Van Peebles in a cameo as \"Sweetback\".\n\nThe film begins with a flashback to a young Mordechai Jefferson Carver. At school, Mordechai is tormented by his fellow students and his teacher for being a Jewish child in a public school predominantly attended by Christians, and for celebrating Hanukkah while everyone else celebrates Christmas. He feels further alienated as he walks through his neighborhood and sees a seemingly endless number of Christmas decorations and window displays celebrating the holiday and announcing that Jews aren't welcome. As he lies down on the sidewalk in front of a store saying \"Jews Welcome (for about 5 minutes)\" and spins his dreidel to cheer himself up, Santa Claus walks by and crushes the toy under his foot, then gives Mordechai the finger.\n\nThe scene then changes to the present with Mordechai as the Hebrew Hammer, a certified circumcised dick who has dedicated his life to defending Jews. His snappy dress (a cross between that of a pimp and a Hasidic Jew) and tough-guy demeanor have made him a local hero within the Jewish community. Jews and African-Americans have enjoyed a tenuous peace with the White Christians over the previous few decades, because the current Santa (the son of the cruel Santa who stomped Mordechai's dreidel years earlier) has pursued a policy of inclusion and tolerance. This Santa is murdered and replaced by his son, Damian, who seeks to destroy Hanukkah and Kwanzaa thus reserving December for Christmas alone. Mordechai is reluctantly recruited to stop Damian, gaining allies along the way, including love interest and daughter of the Chief of the Jewish Justice League Esther Bloomenbergensteinenthal and the Kwanzaa Liberation Front's leader Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim.\n\nThe fight takes them to exotic locales such as Israel, K-Mart, the Jewish Atomic Clock outside Jerusalem and the final battle at the North Pole.\n\n\n\"The Hebrew Hammer\" parodies many common stereotypes about Jews. During filming, the movie came to the attention of the Anti-Defamation League, which were concerned that it might promote unfavorable images of Jews; the film happens to include a direct parody of the ADL as members of the fictional Jewish Justice League. After viewing the film, Warren Katz of the ADL brought legal action against the producers of the film, but lost in a summary ruling handed down by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. The film also drew criticism from some Christian groups, who argued that the film portrayed most Christians as being anti-Semitic and intolerant. \n\nMany scenes were shot in Borough Park, Brooklyn, which has a large community of Hasidic Jews. Filmmakers were initially concerned that members of the Hasidic community might protest the movie, as they did with the 1998 film \"A Price Above Rubies\", and shut down filming. Reaction of the Hasidim in Borough Park was mixed, however. No organized protest was pursued, and some residents of the neighborhood actually agreed to appear as extras in the film.\n\nThe film received a rating of 52% on aggregate review site Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nIn 2017, plans for a sequel titled \"The Hebrew Hammer Vs. Hitler\" were announced. The sequel will be funded in part by crowd funding. It will begin in the present day, with the Hammer coming out of retirement to fight the increase in racism brought on by Donald Trump's election. He does this by going back in time to fight the worst source of antisemitism in the 20th century.\n\n"}

{"id": "3257715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3257715", "title": "Women artists", "text": "Women artists\n\nThough women artists have been involved in the making of art throughout history, their work, when compared to that of their male counterparts, is often both overlooked and undervalued. Prevailing stereotypes about the sexes have caused certain media, such as textile or fiber arts, to be primarily associated with women, despite having once been categories both men and women participated in. Additionally, art forms that have gained this distinction are, as in the case of both textile and fabric arts, demoted to categories like \"arts and crafts\", rather than fine art.\n\nWomen in art have been faced with challenges due to gender biases in the mainstream fine art world. They have often encountered difficulties in training, travelling and trading their work, as well as gaining recognition. Beginning in the late 1960s and 1970s, feminist artists and art historians created a Feminist art movement that overtly addresses the role of women in the art world and explores the role of women in art history and in society.\n\nThere are no records of who the artists of the prehistoric eras were, but studies of many early ethnographers and cultural anthropologists indicate that women often were the principal artisans in Neolithic cultures, in which they created pottery, textiles, baskets, painted surfaces and jewelry. Collaboration on large projects was typical. Extrapolation to the artwork and skills of the Paleolithic era suggests that these cultures followed similar patterns. Cave paintings of this era often have human hand prints, 75% of which are identifiable as women's.\n\n\"For about three thousand years, the women ‚Äì and only the women ‚Äì of Mithila have been making devotional paintings of the gods and goddesses of the Hindu pantheon. It is no exaggeration, then, to say that this art is the expression of the most genuine aspect of Indian civilization.\"\n\nThe earliest records of western cultures rarely mention specific individuals, although women are depicted in all of the art and some are shown laboring as artists. Ancient references by Homer, Cicero, and Virgil mention the prominent roles of women in textiles, poetry, music, and other cultural activities, without discussion of individual artists. Among the earliest European historical records concerning individual artists is that of Pliny the Elder, who wrote about a number of Greek women who were painters, including Helena of Egypt, daughter of Timon of Egypt, Some modern critics posit that \"Alexander Mosaic\" might not have been the work of Philoxenus, but of Helena of Egypt. One of the few named women painters who might have worked in Ancient Greece, she was reputed to have produced a painting of the battle of Issus which hung in the Temple of Peace during the time of Vespasian. Other women include Timarete, Eirene, Kalypso, Aristarete, Iaia, and Olympias. While only some of their work survives, in Ancient Greek pottery there is a \"caputi hydria\" in the Torno Collection in Milan. It is attribute to the Leningrad painter from BCE and shows women working alongside men in a workshop where both painted vases.\n\nArtists from the Medieval period include Claricia, Diemudus, Ende, Guda, Herrade of Landsberg and Hildegard of Bingen. In the early Medieval period, women often worked alongside men. Manuscript illuminations, embroideries, and carved capitals from the period clearly demonstrate examples of women at work in these arts. Documents show that they also were brewers, butchers, wool merchants, and iron mongers. Artists of the time period, including women, were from a small subset of society whose status allowed them freedom from these more strenuous types of work. Women artists often were of two literate classes, either wealthy aristocratic women or nuns. Women in the former category often created embroideries and textiles; those in the later category often produced illuminations.\n\nThere were a number of embroidery workshops in England at the time, particularly at Canterbury and Winchester; \"Opus Anglicanum\" or English embroidery was already famous across Europe ‚Äì a 13th-century papal inventory counted over two hundred pieces. It is presumed that women were almost entirely responsible for this production. One of the most famous embroideries of the Medieval period is the Bayeux Tapestry, which was embroidered with wool and is 230 feet long. Its images narrate the Battle of Hastings and the Norman Conquest of England. The Bayeux Tapestry may have been created in either a commercial workshop by a royal or an aristocratic lady and her retinue, or in a workshop in a nunnery. In the 14th century, a royal workshop is documented, based at the Tower of London, and there may have been other earlier arrangements. Manuscript illumination affords us many of the named artists of the Medieval Period including Ende, a 10th-century Spanish nun; Guda, a 12th-century German nun; and Claricia, a 12th-century laywoman in a Bavarian scriptorium. These women, and many more unnamed illuminators, benefited from the nature of convents as the major loci of learning for women in the period and the most tenable option for intellectuals among them.\n\nIn many parts of Europe, with the Gregorian Reforms of the 11th century and the rise in feudalism, women faced many strictures that they did not face in the Early Medieval period. With these societal changes, the status of the convent changed. In the British Isles, the Norman Conquest marked the beginning of the gradual decline of the convent as a seat of learning and a place where women could gain power. Convents were made subsidiary to male abbots, rather than being headed by an abbess, as they had been previously. In Pagan Scandinavia (in Sweden) the only historically confirmed female runemaster, Gunnborga, worked in the 11th century.\n\nIn Germany, however, under the Ottonian Dynasty, convents retained their position as institutions of learning. This might be partially because convents were often headed and populated by unmarried women from royal and aristocratic families. Therefore, the greatest late Medieval period work by women originates in Germany, as exemplified by that of Herrade of Landsberg and Hildegard of Bingen. Hildegard of Bingen (1098‚Äì1179) is a particularly fine example of a German Medieval intellectual and artist. She wrote \"The Divine Works of a Simple Man\", \"The Meritorious Life\", sixty-five hymns, a miracle play, and a long treatise of nine books on the different natures of trees, plants, animals, birds, fish, minerals, and metals. From an early age, she claimed to have visions. When the Papacy supported these claims by the headmistress, her position as an important intellectual was galvanized. The visions became part of one of her seminal works in 1142, \"Scivias\" \"(Know the Ways of the Lord)\", which consists of thirty-five visions relating and illustrating the history of salvation. The illustrations in the \"Scivias\", as exemplified in the first illustration, depict Hildegarde experiencing visions while seated in the monastery at Bingen. They differ greatly from others created in Germany during the same period, as they are characterized by bright colors, emphasis on line, and simplified forms. While Hildegard likely did not pen the images, their idiosyncratic nature leads one to believe they were created under her close supervision.\n\nThe 12th century saw the rise of the city in Europe, along with the rise in trade, travel, and universities. These changes in society also engendered changes in the lives of women. Women were allowed to head their husbands' businesses if they were widowed. The Wife of Bath in Chaucer's \"The Canterbury Tales\" is one such case. During this time, women also were allowed to be part of some artisan guilds. Guild records show that women were particularly active in the textile industries in Flanders and Northern France. Medieval manuscripts have many marginalia depicting women with spindles. In England, women were responsible for creating \"Opus Anglicanum\", or rich embroideries for ecclesiastical or secular use on clothes and various types of hangings. Women also became more active in illumination. A number of women likely worked alongside their husbands or fathers, including the daughter of Ma√Ætre Honor√© and the daughter of Jean le Noir. By the 13th century most illuminated manuscripts were being produced by commercial workshops, and by the end of the Middle Ages, when production of manuscripts had become an important industry in certain centres, women seem to have represented a majority of the artists and scribes employed, especially in Paris. The movement to printing, and of book illustration to the printmaking techniques of woodcut and engraving, where women seem to have been little involved, represented a setback to the progress of women artists.\n\nArtists from the Renaissance era include Sofonisba Anguissola, Lucia Anguissola, Lavinia Fontana, Fede Galizia, Diana Scultori Ghisi, Caterina van Hemessen, Esther Inglis, Barbara Longhi, Maria Ormani, Marietta Robusti (daughter of Tintoretto), Properzia de' Rossi, Plautilla Nelli, Levina Teerlinc, Mayken Verhulst, and St. Catherine of Bologna (Caterina dei Vigri).\n\nThis is the first period in Western history in which a number of secular female artists gained international reputations. The rise in women artists during this period may be attributed to major cultural shifts. One such shift was a move toward humanism, a philosophy affirming the dignity of all people, that became central to Renaissance thinking and helped raise the status of women. In addition, the identity of the individual artist in general was regarded as more important; significant artists from this period whose identities are unknown virtually cease to exist. Two important texts, \"On Famous Women\" and \"The City of Women\", illustrate this cultural change. Boccaccio, a 14th-century humanist, wrote \"De mulieribus claris\" (Latin for \"On Famous Women\") (1335‚Äì59), a collection of biographies of women. Among the 104 biographies he included was that of Thamar (or Thmyris), an ancient Greek vase painter. Curiously, among the 15th-century manuscript illuminations of \"On Famous Women\", Thamar was depicted painting a self-portrait or perhaps painting a small image of the Virgin and Child. Christine de Pizan, a remarkable late medieval French writer, rhetorician, and critic, wrote \"Book of the City of Ladies\" in 1405, a text about an allegorical city in which independent women lived free from the slander of men. In her work she included real women artists, such as Anastasia, who was considered one of the best Parisian illuminators, although none of her work has survived. Other humanist texts led to increased education for Italian women.\n\nThe most notable of these was \"Il Cortegiano\" or \"The Courtier\" by 16th-century Italian humanist Baldassare Castiglione. This enormously popular work stated that men and women should be educated in the social arts. His influence made it acceptable for women to engage in the visual, musical, and literary arts. Thanks to Castiglione, this was the first period of renaissance history in which noblewomen were able to study painting. Sofonisba Anguissola was the most successful of these minor aristocrats who first benefited from humanist education and then went on to recognition as painters. Artists who were not noblewomen were affected by the rise in humanism as well. In addition to conventional subject matter, artists such as Lavinia Fontana and Caterina van Hemessen began to depict themselves in self-portraits, not just as painters but also as musicians and scholars, thereby highlighting their well-rounded education. Along with the rise in humanism, there was a shift from craftsmen to artists. Artists, unlike earlier craftsmen, were now expected to have knowledge of perspective, mathematics, ancient art, and study of the human body. In the late Renaissance the training of artists began to move from the master's workshop to the Academy, and women began a long struggle, not resolved until the late 19th century, to gain full access to this training. Study of the human body required working from male nudes and corpses. This was considered essential background for creating realistic group scenes. Women were generally barred from training from male nudes, and therefore they were precluded from creating such scenes. Such depictions of nudes were required for the large-scale religious compositions, which received the most prestigious commissions.\n\nAlthough many aristocratic women had access to some training in art, though without the benefit of figure drawing from nude male models, most of those women chose marriage over a career in art. This was true, for example, of two of Sofonisba Anguissola's sisters. The women recognized as artists in this period were either nuns or children of painters. Of the few who emerged as Italian artists in the 15th century, those known today are associated with convents. These artists who were nuns include Caterina dei Virgi, Antonia Uccello, and Suor Barbara Ragnoni. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the vast majority of women who gained any modicum of success as artists were the children of painters. This is likely because they were able to gain training in their fathers' workshops. Examples of women artists who were trained by their fathers include the painter Lavinia Fontana, the miniature portraitist Levina Teerlinc, and the portrait painter Caterina van Hemessen. Italian women artists during this period, even those trained by their family, seem somewhat unusual. However, in certain parts of Europe, particularly northern France and Flanders, it was more common for children of both genders to enter into their father's profession. In fact, in the Low Countries where women had more freedom, there were a number of artists in the Renaissance who were women. For example, the records of the Guild of Saint Luke in Bruges show not only that they admit women as practicing members, but also that by the 1480s twenty-five percent of its members were women (many probably working as manuscript illuminators).\n\nArtists from the Baroque era include: Mary Beale, √âlisabeth Sophie Ch√©ron, Maria Theresa van Thielen, Katharina Pepijn, Catharina Peeters, Johanna Vergouwen, Isabel de Cisneros, Giovanna Garzoni Artemisia Gentileschi, Judith Leyster, Maria Sibylla Merian, Louise Moillon, Josefa de Ayala better known as Josefa de √ìbidos, Maria van Oosterwijk, Magdalena de Passe, Clara Peeters, Maria Virginia Borghese (daughter of art collector Olimpia Aldobrandini), Luisa Rold√°n known as La Roldana, Rachel Ruysch, Maria Theresa van Thielen, Anna Maria van Thielen, Francisca-Catherina van Thielen and Elisabetta Sirani. As in the Renaissance Period, many women among the Baroque artists came from artist families. Artemisia Gentileschi is an excellent example of this. She was trained by her father, Orazio Gentileschi, and she worked alongside him on many of his commissions. Luisa Rold√°n was trained in her father's (Pedro Rold√°n) sculpture workshop.\n\nWomen artists in this period began to change the way women were depicted in art. Many of the women working as artists in the Baroque era were not able to train from nude models, who were always male, but they were very familiar with the female body. Women such as Elisabetta Sirani created images of women as conscious beings rather than detached muses. One of the best examples of this novel expression is in Artemesia Gentileschi's \"Judith beheading Holofernes\", in which Judith is depicted as a strong woman determining her own destiny. While other artists, including Botticelli and the more traditional woman, Fede Galizia, depicted the same scene with a passive Judith, in her novel treatment, Gentileschi's Judith appears to be an able actor in the task at hand. Action is the essence of it and another painting by her of Judith leaving the scene. Still life emerged as an important genre around 1600, particularly in the Netherlands. Women were at the forefront of this painting trend. This genre was particularly suited to women, as they could access the materials for still life readily. In the North, these practitioners included Clara Peeters, a painter of \"banketje\" or breakfast pieces, and scenes of arranged luxury goods; Maria van Oosterwijk, the internationally renowned flower painter; and Rachel Ruysch, a painter of visually charged flower arrangements. In other regions, still life was less common, but there were important women artists in the genre including Giovanna Garzoni, who created realistic vegetable arrangements on parchment, and Louise Moillon, whose fruit still life paintings were noted for their brilliant colors.\n\nArtists from this period include, Rosalba Carriera, Maria Cosway, Marguerite G√©rard, Angelica Kauffman, Ad√©la√Øde Labille-Guiard, Giulia Lama, Mary Moser, Ulrika Pasch, Ad√®le Romany, Anna Dorothea Therbusch, Anne Vallayer-Coster, and Elisabeth Vig√©e-Le Brun.\n\nIn many countries of Europe, the Academies were the arbiters of style. The Academies also were responsible for training artists, exhibiting artwork, and, inadvertently or not, promoting the sale of art. Most Academies were not open to women. In France, for example, the powerful Academy in Paris had 450 members between the 17th century and the French Revolution, and only fifteen were women. Of those, most were daughters or wives of members. In the late 18th century, the French Academy resolved not to admit any women at all. The pinnacle of painting during the period was history painting, especially large scale compositions with groups of figures depicting historical or mythical situations. In preparation to create such paintings, artists studied casts of antique sculptures and drew from male nudes. Women had limited, or no access to this Academic learning, and as such there are no extant large-scale history paintings by women from this period. Some women made their name in other genres such as portraiture. Elisabeth Vigee-Lebrun used her experience in portraiture to create an allegorical scene, \"Peace Bringing Back Plenty\", which she classified as a history painting and used as her grounds for admittance into the Academy. After the display of her work, it was demanded that she attend formal classes, or lose her license to paint. She became a court favourite, and a celebrity, who painted over forty self-portraits, which she was able to sell.\n\nIn England, two women, Angelica Kauffman and Mary Moser, were founding members of the Royal Academy of Arts in London in 1768. Kauffmann helped Maria Cosway enter the Academy. Although Cosway went on to gain success as a painter of mythological scenes, both women remained in a somewhat ambivalent position at the Royal Academy, as evidenced by the group portrait of \"The Academicians of the Royal Academy\" by Johan Zoffany now in The Royal Collection. In it, only the men of the Academy are assembled in a large artist studio, together with nude male models. For reasons of decorum given the nude models, the two women are not shown as present, but as portraits on the wall instead. The emphasis in Academic art on studies of the nude during training remained a considerable barrier for women studying art until the 20th century, both in terms of actual access to the classes and in terms of family and social attitudes to middle-class women becoming artists. After these three, no woman became a full member of the Academy until Laura Knight in 1936, and women were not admitted to the Academy's schools until 1861. By the late 18th century, there were important steps forward for artists who were women. In Paris, the Salon, the exhibition of work founded by the Academy, became open to non-Academic painters in 1791, allowing women to showcase their work in the prestigious annual exhibition. Additionally, women were more frequently being accepted as students by famous artists such as Jacques-Louis David and Jean-Baptiste Greuze.\n\nWomen artists of the early part of the 19th century include Marie-Denise Villers, who specialized in portraiture; Constance Mayer, who painted portraits and allegories; Marie Ellenrieder, who was noted mainly for her religious paintings in the Nazarene style.\n\nIn the second half of the century, Emma Sandys, Marie Spartali Stillman, Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale, and Maria Zambaco were women artists of the Pre-Raphaelite movement. Also influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites were Evelyn De Morgan and the activist and painter Barbara Bodichon.\n\nImpressionist painters Berthe Morisot, Marie Bracquemond, and the Americans, Mary Cassatt and Lucy Bacon, became involved in the French Impressionist movement of the 1860s and 1870s. American Impressionist Lilla Cabot Perry was influenced by her studies with Monet and by Japanese art in the late 19th century. Cecilia Beaux was an American portrait painter who also studied in France. Olga Bozna≈Ñska is considered the best-known of all Polish women artists, and was stylistically associated with Impressionism. \n\nRosa Bonheur was the best-known female artist of her time, internationally renowned for her paintings of animals. Elizabeth Thompson (Lady Butler), perhaps inspired by her life-classes of armoured figures at the Government School, was one of the first women to become famous for large history paintings, specializing in scenes of military action, usually with many horses, most famously \"Scotland Forever!\", showing a cavalry charge at Waterloo.\n\nKitty Lange Kielland was a Norwegian landscape painter.\n\nElizabeth Jane Gardner was an American academic painter who was the first American woman to exhibit at the Paris Salon. In 1872 she became the first woman to ever win a gold medal at the Salon. \n\nIn 1894, Suzanne Valadon was the first woman admitted to the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts in France. Anna Boch was a post-impressionist painter, as was Laura Muntz Lyall, who exhibited at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois, and then in 1894 as part of the Soci√©t√© des artistes fran√ßais in Paris. \n\nJulia Margaret Cameron and Gertrude Kasebier became well known in the new medium of photography, where there were no traditional restrictions, and no established training, to hold them back. \n\nCamille Claudel, Edmonia Lewis and Enid Yandell.\n\nIn the late 19th century, Edmonia Lewis, an African-Ojibwe-Haitian American artist from New York began her art studies at Oberlin College. Her sculpting career began in 1863. She established a studio in Rome, Italy and exhibited her marble sculptures through Europe and the United States.\n\nDuring the century, access to academies and formal art training expanded more for women in Europe and North America. The British Government School of Design, which later became the Royal College of Art, admitted women from its founding in 1837, but only into a \"Female School\" which was treated somewhat differently, with \"life\"- classes consisting for several years of drawing a man wearing a suit of armour. \n\nThe Royal Academy Schools finally admitted women beginning in 1861, but students drew initially only draped models. However, other schools in London, including the Slade School of Art from the 1870s, were more liberal. By the end of the century women were able to study the naked, or very nearly naked, figure in many Western European and North American cities. The Society of Female Artists (now called \"The Society of Women Artists\") was established in 1855 in London and has staged annual exhibitions since 1857, when 358 works were shown by 149 women, some using a pseudonym.\n\nNotable women artists from this period include:\n\nHannelore Baron, Lee Bontecou, Louise Bourgeois, Romaine Brooks, Emily Carr, Leonora Carrington, Mary Cassatt, Elizabeth Catlett, Camille Claudel, Sonia Delaunay, Marthe Donas, Joan Eardley, Marisol Escobar, Dulah Marie Evans, Audrey Flack, Mary Frank, Helen Frankenthaler, Elisabeth Frink, Wilhelmina Weber Furlong, Fran√ßoise Gilot, Natalia Goncharova, Nancy Graves, Grace Hartigan, Barbara Hepworth, Eva Hesse, Sigrid Hjert√©n, Hannah H√∂ch, Frances Hodgkins, Malvina Hoffman, Margaret Ponce Israel, Gwen John, K√§the Kollwitz, Lee Krasner, Frida Kahlo, Hilma af Klint, Laura Knight, Barbara Kruger, Marie Laurencin, Tamara de Lempicka, S√©raphine Louis, Dora Maar, Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh, Maruja Mallo, Agnes Martin, Ana Mendieta, Joan Mitchell, Paula Modersohn-Becker, Gabriele M√ºnter, Alice Neel, Louise Nevelson, Georgia O'Keeffe, Orovida Camille Pissarro, Irene Rice Pereira, Bridget Riley, Ver√≥nica Ruiz de Velasco, Anne Ryan, Charlotte Salomon, Augusta Savage, Zofia Stryje≈Ñska, Zinaida Serebriakova, Sarai Sherman, Henrietta Shore, Sr. Maria Stanisia, Marjorie Strider, Carrie Sweetser, Suzanne Valadon, Remedios Varo, Maria Helena Vieira da Silva, Nellie Walker, Marianne von Werefkin and Ogura Yuki.\n\nHilma af Klint (1862‚Äì1944) was a pioneer abstract painter, working long before her abstract expressionist male counterparts. She was Swedish and regularly exhibited her paintings dealing with realism, but the abstract works were not shown until 20 years after her death, at her request. She considered herself to be a spiritualist and mystic.\n\nMargaret Macdonald Mackintosh (1865‚Äì1933) was a Scottish artist whose works helped define the \"Glasgow Style\" of the 1890s and early 20th century. She often collaborated with her husband, the architect and designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh, in works that had influence in Europe. She exhibited with Mackintosh at the 1900 Vienna Secession, where her work is thought to have had an influence on the Secessionists such as Gustav Klimt.\n\nWilhelmina Weber Furlong (1878‚Äì1962) was an early American modernist in New York City. She made significant contributions to modern American art through her work at the Art Students League and the Whitney Studio Club. Aleksandra Ekster and Lyubov Popova were Constructivist, Cubo-Futurist, and Suprematist artists well known and respected in Kiev, Moscow and Paris in the early 20th century. Among the other women artists prominent in the Russian avant-garde were Natalia Goncharova, Varvara Stepanova and Nadezhda Udaltsova. Sonia Delaunay and her husband were the founders of Orphism.\n\nIn the Art Deco era, Hildreth Meiere made large-scale mosaics and was the first woman honored with the Fine Arts Medal of the American Institute of Architects. Tamara de Lempicka, also of this era, was an Art Deco painter from Poland. Sr. Maria Stanisia became a notable portraitist, mainly of clergy. Georgia O'Keeffe was born in the late 19th century. She became known for her paintings, featuring flowers, bones, and landscapes of New Mexico. In 1927, Dod Procter's painting \"Morning\" was voted Picture of the Year in the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, and bought by the \"Daily Mail\" for the Tate gallery. Its popularity resulted in its showing in New York and a two-year tour of Britain. Surrealism, an important artistic style in the 1920s and 1930s, had a number of prominent women artists, including Leonora Carrington, Kay Sage, Dorothea Tanning, and Remedios Varo.\nLee Miller rediscovered solarization and became a high fashion photographer. Dorothea Lange documented the Depression. Margaret Bourke-White created the industrial photographs that were featured on the cover and in the lead article of the first \"Life Magazine\". Diane Arbus based her photography on outsiders to mainstream society. Graciela Iturbide's works dealt with Mexican life and feminism, while Tina Modotti produced \"revolutionary icons\" from Mexico in the 1920s. Annie Leibovitz's photographic work was of rock and roll and other celebrity figures. \n\nMary Carroll Nelson founded the Society of Layerists in Multi-Media (SLMM), whose artist members follow in the tradition of Emil Bisttram and the Transcendental Painting Group, as well as Morris Graves of the Pacific Northwest Visionary Art School. In the 1970s, Judy Chicago created \"The Dinner Party\", a very important work of feminist art. Helen Frankenthaler was an Abstract Expressionist painter and she was influenced by Jackson Pollock. Lee Krasner was also an Abstract Expressionist artist and married to Pollock and a student of Hans Hofmann. Elaine de Kooning was a student and later the wife of Willem de Kooning, she was an abstract figurative painter. Anne Ryan was a collagist. Jane Frank, also a student of Hans Hofmann, worked with mixed media on canvas. In Canada, Marcelle Ferron was an exponent of automatism.\n\nFrom the 1960s on, feminism led to a great increase in interest in women artists and their academic study. Notable contributions have been made by the art historians Germaine Greer, Linda Nochlin, Griselda Pollock and others. Some art historians such as Daphne Haldin have attempted to redress the balance of male-focused histories by compiling lists of women artists, though many of these efforts remain unpublished. Figures like Artemesia Gentileschi and Frida Kahlo emerged from relative obscurity to become feminist icons. The Guerilla Girls, an anonymous group of females formed in 1985, were \"the conscience of the art world.\" They spoke out about indifference and inequalities for gender and race, particularly in the art world. The Guerilla Girls have made many posters as a way of bringing attention, typically in a humorous way, to the community to raise awareness and create change. In 1996, Catherine de Zegher curated an exhibition of 37 great women artists from the twentieth century. The exhibition, \"Inside the Visible\", that travelled from the ICA in Boston to the National Museum for Women in the Arts in Washington, the Whitechapel in London and the Art Gallery of Western Australia in Perth, included artists' works from the 1930s through the 1990s featuring Claude Cahun, Louise Bourgeois, Bracha Ettinger, Agnes Martin, Carrie Mae Weems, Charlotte Salomon, Eva Hesse, Nancy Spero, Francesca Woodman, Lygia Clark and Mona Hatoum among others.\n\nIn 1993, Rachel Whiteread was the first woman to win the Tate Gallery's Turner Prize. Gillian Wearing won the prize in 1997, when there was an all-woman shortlist, the other nominees being Christine Borland, Angela Bulloch and Cornelia Parker. In 1999, Tracey Emin gained considerable media coverage for her entry \"My Bed\", but did not win. In 2006 the prize was awarded to abstract painter, Tomma Abts. In 2001, a conference called \"Women Artists at the Millennium\" was organized at Princeton University. A book by that name was published in 2006, featuring major art historians such as Linda Nochlin analysing prominent women artists such as Louise Bourgeois, Yvonne Rainer, Bracha Ettinger, Sally Mann, Eva Hesse, Rachel Whiteread and Rosemarie Trockel. Internationally prominent contemporary artists who are women also include Magdalena Abakanowicz, Marina Abramoviƒá, Jaroslava Brychtova, Lynda Benglis, Lee Bul, Sophie Calle, Janet Cardiff, Li Chevalier, Marlene Dumas, Marisol Escobar, Jenny Holzer, Runa Islam, Chantal Joffe, Yayoi Kusama, Karen Kilimnik, Sarah Lucas, Yoko Ono, Jenny Saville, Carolee Schneeman, Cindy Sherman, Shazia Sikander, Lorna Simpson, Lisa Steele, Stella Vine, Kara Walker, Rebecca Warren, Bettina Werner and Susan Dorothea White. \n\nJapanese artist Yayoi Kusama's paintings, collages, soft sculptures, performance art and environmental installations all share an obsession with repetition, pattern, and accumulation. Her work shows some attributes of feminism, minimalism, surrealism, Art Brut, pop art, and abstract expressionism, and is infused with autobiographical, psychological, and sexual content. She describes herself as an \"obsessive artist\". In November 2008, Christie's auction house New York sold her 1959 painting \"No. 2\" for $5,100,000, the record price in 2008 for a work by a living female artist. During 2010‚Äì2011, Pompidou Centre in Paris presented its curators' choice of contemporary women artists in a three-volume's exhibition named \"elles@Centrepompidou\". The museum showed works of major women artists from its own collection. 2010 saw Eileen Cooper elected as the first ever woman 'Keeper of the Royal Academy'. 1995 saw Dame Elizabeth Blackadder in the 300-year history made 'Her Majesty's painter and limber in Scotland, she was awarded the OBE in 1982.\n\nAn interesting genre of women's art is women's environmental art. As of December 2013, the Women Environmental Artists Directory listed 307 women environmental artists, such as Marina DeBris, Vernita Nemec and Betty Beaumont. DeBris uses beach trash to raise awareness of beach and ocean pollution. and to educate children about beach trash. Nemec recently used junk mail to demonstrate the complexity of modern life. Beaumont has been described as a pioneer of environmental art and uses art to challenge our beliefs and actions.\n\nWomen artists have often been mis-characterized in historical accounts, both intentionally and unintentionally; such misrepresentations have often been dictated by the socio-political mores of the given era. There are a number of issues that lie behind this, including:\n\n\n"}
