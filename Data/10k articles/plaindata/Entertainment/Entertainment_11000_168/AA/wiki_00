Published on 1 November 2012 (9 September 2013 in the US), it is a trivia book containing 1,227 facts collected during the making of the series, which had been ten years in the making at the time of publication.\n\nLloyd said in an interview with \"The Daily Telegraph\": \"This book is like a set of haiku. I think it's the best thing we've ever done. It has purity and simplicity.\"\n\nThe book contains lists of facts, normally four per page. All the sources for the facts are listed online on the QI website. Other than Lloyd, Mitchinson and Harkin, credit for authorship is also given to \"QI\" researchers (also known as \"Elves\") Anne Miller, Andy Murray and Alex Bell.\n\nThe reason for the number of facts being 1,227, according to Lloyd and Mitchinson, was that they had originally planned to have 1,000 facts and when they wrote down the list containing all the facts that would go in the book, they discovered that they had gone past the number, to 1,227.\n\n"}
{"id": "42705775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42705775", "title": "Agent Carter (TV series)", "text": "Agent Carter (TV series)\n\nMarvel's Agent Carter, or simply Agent Carter, is an American television series created for ABC by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, inspired by the 2011 film \"\", and the 2013 Marvel One-Shot short film of the same name. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films and other television series of the franchise. The series was produced by ABC Studios, Marvel Television, and F&B Fazekas & Butters, with Tara Butters, Michele Fazekas, and Chris Dingess serving as showrunners.\n\nThe series features the Marvel Comics character Peggy Carter, with Hayley Atwell reprising her role from the film series and One-Shot, as she must balance life as a secret agent with that of a single woman in 1940s America. Development on a series inspired by the \"Agent Carter\" short film had begun by September 2013, with Atwell's involvement confirmed in January 2014. That May, ABC bypassed a pilot, ordering the show straight to series, with James D'Arcy, Chad Michael Murray, and Enver Gjokaj starring alongside Atwell; they are joined by Shea Whigham for the first season. The series introduces the origins of several characters and storylines from MCU films, while other characters from the films also appear.\n\nThe first season, consisting of eight episodes, originally aired from January 6 to February 24, 2015, while the second season, consisting of 10 episodes, originally aired from January 19 to March 1, 2016. Both seasons aired during mid-season breaks of \"Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" Despite a positive critical response, viewership fell steadily, and on May 12, 2016, ABC canceled \"Agent Carter\".\n\nThe first season takes place in 1946, with Peggy Carter having to balance the routine office work she does for the Strategic Scientific Reserve (SSR) in New York City with secretly assisting Howard Stark, who finds himself framed for supplying deadly weapons to enemies of the United States. Carter is assisted by Stark's butler, Edwin Jarvis, to find those responsible and dispose of the weapons. In the second season, Carter moves from New York City to Los Angeles to deal with the threats of the new Atomic Age by the Secret Empire in the aftermath of World War II, gaining new friends, a new home, and a potential new love interest.\n\n\nA potential \"Agent Carter\" series was initially brought up in July 2013 by Louis D'Esposito, after a screening of his \"Agent Carter\" One-Shot at San Diego Comic-Con. By September, Marvel Television was developing a series inspired by the short film, featuring Peggy Carter, and was in search of a writer for the series. In January 2014, ABC Entertainment Group president Paul Lee confirmed that the show was in development, and revealed that Tara Butters and Michele Fazekas would act as the series' showrunners. Chris Dingess also serves as a showrunner. In March 2014, Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, writers of the \"Captain America\" films, stated that they envisioned the series, which had not yet been greenlit, as a limited series of approximately 13 episodes. By April 2014, there were indications that the series would be ordered straight to series, bypassing a pilot order, and would air between the late 2014 and early 2015 portions of \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\", if that series got a second season renewal. On May 8, 2014, ABC officially ordered the series for eight episodes, with executive producers Butters, Fazekas, Markus, McFeely, Dingess, Kevin Feige, Louis D'Esposito, Alan Fine, Joe Quesada, Stan Lee, and Jeph Loeb. The series was renewed for a second season on May 7, 2015, of 10 episodes.\n\nMarkus and McFeely stated in March 2014 that the series would be set in 1946 initially, occurring in the middle of the timeline established in the One-Shot, and would focus on one case for Carter. Additional seasons would then advance a year and examine a new case. Despite working on \"\" at the same time, Markus and McFeely remained involved with the series after writing the first script. When the showrunners joined the series, they went on a \"mini-camp\" with Markus and McFeely to develop the series from a pilot script written by the pair. They looked to several different influences outside of Marvel in developing the series, including \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", \"L.A. Confidential\", and the works of author James Ellroy. Elaborating on deviating from the comics, Fazekas said, for example, \"if we're using a minor character or a bad guy from an old comic book, we don't have to adhere to what that character was in that comic book from 1945. Because there are so many different iterations of a specific character, you can't be true to every single one.\" ABC asked the producers to not have the series follow a \"Gadget of the Week or Bad Guy of the Week\" model, and instead focus on telling the story of Carter balancing her personal and professional lives. Fazekas called this \"such a nice change\" from previous television experience, with the group feeling free to drop whole story ideas in favor of focusing on the series' central storyline.\n\nOn the time periods the series could potentially explore following the first season given Carter's role in \"\", Atwell said, \"I think the great thing about the fact that I've already played her at the end of her life means that we know ... [Now] we have an opportunity, if the show does go into second and third and fourth and fifth [seasons], we know that we can explore all of these aspects of her character because we know she lives such a long life and she's had a fulfilled life. I think what's going to start happening in Season 1 is seeds are going to be planted as to what happens in her personal life—and yet it's still open to the possibility of new men coming into her life, deepening relationships with the men that we discover in Season 1. Obviously, the era is 1946 but in the second, third, fourth, fifth season—if it goes onto that—we can explore different time periods. We can explore the late forties, the early fifties, the sixties, the seventies, the eighties, up until present day, so it's very exciting because of that.\" However, Butters clarified that future seasons would likely stay in the same time period, possibly changing location to a place like Hollywood or Europe, to remain in a pre-S.H.I.E.L.D. setting and avoid competing with \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" This was the case with the second season, which moved the series to 1947 Los Angeles.\n\nAtwell, who portrayed Carter in \"\", \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\", and the \"Agent Carter\" short film, expressed interest in returning as the character in October 2013, before Lee confirmed her involvement in January 2014. That August, Chad Michael Murray and Enver Gjokaj were cast as SSR agents Jack Thompson and Daniel Sousa, respectively, while James D'Arcy was cast the next month as Edwin Jarvis, the character who would eventually inspire the artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S. from the MCU films. Shea Whigham was also cast, as SSR chief Roger Dooley. Atwell, D'Arcy, Gjokaj, and Murray returned for the second season.\n\nThe costume designer for the series is Giovanna Ottobre-Melton, who felt comfortable with the series' period setting after spending months researching American styles in the 1940s for the 2013 television series \"Mob City\". She noted that \"many comic books were all blended by the color, style, and fabrics\" from 1940s New York. Due to the large amount of action in the series, fabrics \"with the feel and texture of the 1940s\" had to be sourced in large quantities, to allow for the creation of four, five, or more of each costume. Ottobre-Melton's process \"for each episode, [is to] read the script first, and then search for historic photos that relate to what the episode is about. Afterwards I chose the fabrics, and then begin to design the outfits.\"\n\nWhen creating the gadgets for the series, the writers noted the need to combine the period setting with the influence of Howard Stark, who opens the door to \"things that are fantastic for the time period\". They worked closely with the props department to develop technology that appears \"both retro and futuristic at the same time\", with Fazekas explaining that the goal was to avoid a science fiction look, so the fantastical aspects were reserved solely for function while the aesthetic was kept within the realms of that time period.\n\nFilming for the series took place in Los Angeles, with the story's location shifting from New York City to Los Angeles with the second season to capitalize on this. Gabriel Beristain, cinematographer for the One-Shot and the first season of the series, used a combination of modern digital technology and traditional analog techniques to replicate the feel of classic films that are set in the 1940s, but to also have the convenience and consistency of modern technology, such as using the Arri Alexa digital camera, along with Leica Lenses and silk-stocking diffusion nets. Edward J. Pei took over as cinematographer for the second season. Stunt coordinator Casey O'Neill, who also worked on the One-Shot and \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\", incorporated the specific fighting styles of the characters, such as the more \"CIA-trained\" fighting of Carter or the more acrobatic, \"Black Widow\"-inspired style of antagonist Dottie Underwood.\n\nSheena Duggal serves as visual effect supervisor, returning in the same capacity from the \"Agent Carter\" One-Shot, with the visual effects for the series created by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Base FX, and later DNeg TV. Duggal worked closest with ILM, who coordinated with Base and DNeg to ensure a \"seamless workflow\". The majority of the series' visual effects work focuses on set extensions to depict the period setting, as well as the more fantastical aspects such as Howard Stark's inventions, or Zero Matter and Jason Wilkes' intangibility in the second season.\n\nIn June 2014, Christopher Lennertz, who composed the music for the \"Agent Carter\" One-Shot, talked about potentially working on the series, saying, D'Esposito \"told me last summer at Comic-Con that there was a possibility this was going to become a series. And he said that if he was going to be involved, he wanted me to be involved, too.\" In September 2014, Lennertz officially signed on to compose for the series. Lennertz combined all the different style elements of the show in the music, such as mixing jazz and period elements, with orchestra and electronic elements. Lennertz said, the music is \"always done from a sense of being sort of in control and savvy and clever, rather than just being strong or just having a superpower or sort of being so much further along than anybody else physically. Part of it was just trying to make it that she's just smarter than everybody else. She's got such command over so many of these situations, and that was the most important thing was to give her that personality.\" A soundtrack album for the first season was released on iTunes on December 11, 2015, and the single \"Whatcha Gonna Do (It's Up to You)\" from the second season was released on March 18, 2016.\n\nBecause Carter originates from the films, Marvel Studios co-presidents Feige and D'Esposito \"are very invested in this and they've been really collaborative and very generous with their world\". Markus, talking about the series' place in the greater architecture of the MCU, later said \"you really only need to drop the tiniest bit of hint and its connected. You don't have to go, 'Howard Stark's wearing the same pants that Tony wears!' ... Everything is enhanced just by the knowledge that its all connected.\" Butters said, \"We always want to feel like you see us as a piece of [the MCU]. But because of our time period, we kind of are on our own a little bit.\"\n\nIn July 2014, Fazekas talked about how the series would relate to the One-Shot, saying, \"The short really is the basis for the series. [Carter]'s working at SSR, post-war...If you think of the short as sort of the end of the series, the series would be leading up to that moment where she gets assigned to S.H.I.E.L.D.\" Markus reiterated this in January 2015, but added that \"we all agree and understand that [keeping continuity with the short is] going to get tougher if we continue\" making the series. The first season introduces the origins of the Black Widow and Winter Soldier programs, which both appear in several MCU films, while the second season shows the discovery of the Darkforce (known as Zero Matter in the series), which previously appeared in \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" and has ties to Doctor Strange.\n\n\"Agent Carter\" aired on ABC in the United States, in 720p high definition and 5.1 surround sound. It also aired on CTV in Canada, and TV2 in New Zealand. In October 2014, Channel 4, the channel that airs \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" in the United Kingdom, stated that they did not \"have any current plans [to air] \"Agent Carter\"\". In June 2015, FOX UK purchased the broadcast rights for the United Kingdom, with the series premiering on July 12, 2015. In February 2016, the series was announced to air on 7flix in Australia.\n\nThe complete first season became available on Blu-ray and DVD on September 18, 2015, as an Amazon.com exclusive.\n\nMaureen Ryan of \"Variety\" blamed both seasons' low viewership on \"the questionable scheduling decisions\" made by then ABC president Paul Lee, saying that the series \"has received lackluster promotion, especially [for its second season]. The botched rollout of season two included a changed premiere date and episodes that were difficult to access in advance on Marvel's dreadful media site. Capping the mishandling is the fact that the full first season was only made available on ABC.com days before season two began, which frustrated viewers who might have wanted to jump on board in advance.\"\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 95% approval rating with an average rating of 7.9/10 based on 34 reviews for the first season. The website's consensus reads, \"Focusing on Peggy Carter as a person first and an action hero second makes \"Marvel's Agent Carter\" a winning, stylish drama with bursts of excitement and an undercurrent of cheeky fun\". Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 73 out of 100 based on 27 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". The second season scored an 81% approval rating with an average score of 7.9/10 based on 16 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"A move from New York to Hollywood gives Agent Carter new territory to explore, as the series continues to search for a storyline as dynamic as its heroine\".\n\nArguing for the renewal of the series for a third season following its low viewership, Ryan said that \"letting the show die would be a serious mistake, for the network and for the bigger Disney-ABC conglomerate...These days, entertainment properties have to be viewed not just through the lens of their ratings (admittedly weak for \"Agent Carter\"). They have to be evaluated within the context of the overall value they bring to any entertainment colossus, and what \"Agent Carter\" adds to Disney-ABC is simply too valuable to give up ... [bringing] something different to the company's superhero portfolio.\" She suggested if ABC did not renew the series for broadcast, that it should explore other opportunities, such as debuting on its online Watch ABC app, or being sold to Netflix, where \"fans of super-heroic storytelling already flock to\" and \"Agent Carter\"s \"status as a period piece—which may have harmed it on broadcast—could be a real draw for Netflix viewers\". Ryan also felt Marvel \"could copy what CBS is \" by creating a subscription service for a monthly fee, where consumers could access Marvel's films and televisions shows \"as well as premium exclusives like a third season of \"Agent Carter\"\". Ryan concluded, \"A third \"Agent Carter\" season could help solidify Marvel's standing not just with female fans, but with everyone who appreciates excellent and adventurous storytelling.\"\n\nWhen the series was canceled shortly after the release of \"\", in which Carter dies, Meagan Damore of Comic Book Resources felt that \"for all intents and purposes\" Carter had \"effectively been phased out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe\", and the universe had subsequently lost \"a wonderful role model and...inspiration\" to fans of the character and series. Damore lamented the fact that the second season's cliffhanger ending had been left unresolved, and that viewers would never get the chance to see Carter's \"happy ending\", despite knowing she gets one, leaving the character's \"fate unfulfilled, languishing in the obscurity of 'what could have beens. She also noted that Marvel had now lost \"the opportunity to show several prominent MCU events, not the least of which is the founding of S.H.I.E.L.D.\", and added that despite making \"leaps and bounds for women in the MCU, the same [could not] be said for people of color\", wishing the series had addressed Asian American women like Hazel Ying Lee, one of 38 Women Airforce Service Pilots who died in the line of duty, or Black women like Harriet Ida Pikens and Frances Wills, the first two Black members of the United States Naval Reserve.\n\nIn March 2015, Butters stated that there had been discussions about creating a podcast with \"Thrilling Adventure Hour\" co-creator and writer Ben Blacker, centered around the fictional \"Captain America Adventure Program\" radio show that is depicted during the series' first season. Butters said that well-received segments had not been part of the original pitch to Marvel, and noted that a second season renewal for the series would help the real world podcast's chances. She stated that the potential episodes would be \"little fifteen-minute storylines\".\n\nIn March 2016, Fazekas said the producers felt \"bad\" about the chances for a third season due to the series' low viewership, adding she \"would love to see it live on, even if it's in some other form, digital or whatever. I doubt that there's a Netflix play for it.\" She also added that ABC wanted some sort of conclusion to the series, and so the writers and producers would find a way to conclude the lingering plot threads in some form if the series was not renewed. On May 12, 2016, ABC canceled the series. Loeb said he did not understand the decision, as \"there were no conversations\" regarding the series, with Marvel only receiving a call from ABC saying \"Agent Carter\" was canceled. He added that since the networks decide what content they would like from Marvel Television, \"if someone wants to call and say, 'We want a two-hour \"Agent Carter\" [film special] for May 2017,' . We'll put together the greatest \"Agent Carter\" movie we can.\" Atwell added that she was also not part of the conversation to cancel the series and called it \"a network political thing\" since ABC wanted Atwell to headline the more \"mainstream\" drama \"Conviction\" \"to get their ratings up\" instead of staying on \"Agent Carter\", which Atwell felt had gained a \"cult following\". After speculation regarding a revival for the series by Netflix, chief content officer Ted Sarandos stated the streaming service passed on reviving \"Agent Carter\" because it is \"looking for truly original brands to own and in that Marvel space we already have\" original Marvel series. He also added that due to existing international broadcasting \"deal complexities\" for the series, Netflix would not have been able to air \"Agent Carter\" globally, as \"Some of those output partners still had it on the air, so they would argue its covered by their output [deals]. Unfortunately, it was a business decision more than a creative one.\"\n\nAtwell had stated on potential further seasons, \"We think that there could be more to come...the [second season] finale doesn't suggest that that's it and they live happily ever after; that's the end. We know that's not the case. They've done it in a very clever way which wraps up and that gives the audience a very satisfying conclusion but they're not quite finishing it and leaving it there.\" On the location for a third season, Fazekas stated that moving the series to London had been a possibility, an idea that creators Markus and McFeely had early on. Fazekas added, \"you can put the show anywhere, because it's spies. [The location is] all going to be determined by what story we want to tell. I loved [Los Angeles]. I loved how it looked, I loved how it looked on Peggy. We would be very happy to do another L.A. season, but we're not married to it.\" Fazekas also said that seeds for a third season had been planted all throughout the second, and that the end of the second season, with someone shooting Thompson and taking the M. Carter file, was \"very much tied to a third season arc\", with the shooter and their reason for taking the file already determined. Atwell added that the third season would have gone \"further back into [Carter's] past\" while having \"a possible kind of twist... into something to do with [her] family\". She also added that more insight would have been provided on Carter's brother, Michael. Writer Jose Molina expanded on this, stated that the season would have focused on the investigation of the assassination attempt on Thompson's life, along with the revelation that Michael was still alive and involved in some \"very nefarious, super-villainous shenanigans\".\n\n"}

Baithak is a social gathering. It is a mix of Bhojpuri folk songs with other Caribbean influences. It is similar to Chutney music that originated in Trinidad and Tobago. The most popular exponent in Surinam of the genre were Ramdew Chaitoe and Dropati.\n\nIn basic Baithak Gana there are three instruments (though there are other instruments that could be added to the ensemble), harmonium, dholak and the dhantal. The harmonium is a free-standing keyboard instrument similar to a reed organ. The dholak is a double headed drum that originated in Northern India, however, it is still used in the folk songs from Pakistan or Nepal. The last instrument that is used in this style of music is the dhantal which serves as the rhythmic piece of the ensemble, it consists of a long steel rod which is then \"struck\" by a U-formed piece, the origin of this device is unclear, as it may have been brought by the Indian indentured-laborers. The origin of the dhantal was formed from the use of a long steel rod with an almost-enclosed circle tip at the end used in the yoke of bull-driven carts that were used to transport sugar cane to guide the bulls. The U-shaped handle piece was derived the use of a horse shoe.\n\nBaithak Gana has its roots from the North Indian styles of music. The contract labours brought this form of style of music from India to South American, Caribbean, Oceanian, and African countries. In South America, you can think of the countries of Suriname and Guyana. In the Caribbean you can think of the countries of Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica. In Oceania they mean the country Fiji. In Africa they mean the countries of Mauritius and South Africa. With the migration of the Indian community Baithak Gana has been exported to the Netherlands, the United States and Canada.\n\nNoteworthy artists that had a significant influence on Baithak Gana are Ramdew Chaitoe and Dropati.\n\nAfter the independence of Surinam in 1975, many Indo-Surinamese people migrated to the Netherlands and took their folk music along. Almost 40 years later the folk music has evolved into a new style. Implementing new music instruments such as a synthesizers and electronic drums.\n"}

It was one of the two controversial carnivals of the 1880s and 1890s, the other being the annual masked ball, held in the spring. The carnival was an annual event with different themes. It was held particularly for the students of the four branches of architecture, painting, sculpture, and engraving of the École des Beaux-Arts. It was considered a \"riotous Saturnalia\". The girls accompanying the students for the carnival painted their bodies and wore costumes over them which would eventually come off during the wild revelry. The first ball was held in 1892 in Montmartre. It was modest when compared with later ones, and it was considered a success, though it was immediately put into the hands of organizers.\n\nThe second event was a costume ball held 9 February 1893 at the Moulin Rouge; along with merriment and drinking. Nude models walked about as living paintings and a nude woman was noted to be standing on a table at midnight. A lawsuit arose thereafter. Sarah Brown (née Marie or Marie-Florentine Roger or Royer), who posed as an atelier model, was arrested and fined for nudity after the Bal des Quat'z'Arts carnival in 1893. This led to student rioting in the Latin Quarter. Later, when her whereabouts could not be determined, it was conjectured that she had committed suicide.\n\nStarting in 1900, the theme became singular – ancient – drawing on Greece and Homer. The theme was documented in invitations, programs and posters.\n\nMonths were spent in the creation of floats and in the costuming of students and models. The favorite wit of the different ateliers was given the task of painting the banner of the atelier, which was carried at the head of the several corteges. Special instructions were issued to the different ateliers while preparations were in progress, such as this one from the ball of 1899:\n\nThe four different ateliers each created various floats and corteges. Prizes were given for the most successful interpretations. A jury composed of painters and sculptors reviewed the costumes as each person entered the ball. If someone did not achieve the appropriate artistic standard, they were turned away. Tickets were not transferable. It was difficult for someone who was not an enrolled student in one of the four ateliers to enter the ball. The ball featured a procession of moving tableaux. When dawn approached the students formed a huge circle to watch the dancing that began in the morning hours. When the dance ended, there would be a shout, \"Long live the Quat'z' Arts!\" The ball closed at about seven in the morning. It was followed by a procession through the Latin Quarter, finally reaching the Louvre where a general romp would occur. The march would resume over the Pont du Carrousel, until the Théâtre de l'Odéon was reached, where the attendees would disband.\n\nIn 2012 the Bal des Quat'z'Arts was revived on the initiative of Nicolas Bourriaud when director of the École des Beaux-Arts.\n\n\nhttp://www.4zarts.org/\n"}

The game is similar in gameplay and appearance to the classic from 1992. The player controls the main character from a third person sidescrolling perspective.\n\nThe main character is Jack Thompson, a member of a US air force strategic bomber squadron during World War II. During a mission above Germany his plane gets attacked by German fighters and catches fire. Somehow, a portal opens up as the plane is going down, and it enters what is presumably a parallel universe or an alternate timeline. Jack finds himself descending not upon the German countryside, but on a strange, unfamiliar jungle landscape. Meanwhile, on the ground, we see a tied up young woman, struggling to get loose as a gigantic carnivorous dinosaur approaches. Jack's plane luckily hits and decapitates the creature, preventing the woman from being eaten. At the last second Jack bails out, and at the beginning of the game he dangles in his parachute from a tree, with a boot-knife as his only weapon.\nAfter cutting the woman loose, she is revealed to be a princess who was going to be sacrificed as an attempt to save her father's life. She becomes Jack's companion throughout the game. The adventure consists of a large number of static panels across which the player moves to solve puzzles and battle dinosaurs. Objects can be picked up, and using them in the right context is often required to progress to the next screen. Other problems are often solved by jumping or interacting with the princess.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews. Most agreed however that the game's graphics were excellent for its time. Coming Soon Magazine wrote: \n\"The most delightful aspect of this game has to be the background scenery. Every panel is unique and represents enormous effort and talent.\" justadventure.com, however, were overall critical of the game because of its hard puzzles, and gave it a \"D\" on a scale running from A through F. The reviewer wrote: \"Eye and ear candy are nothing if a game's no fun to play, and The Bermuda Syndrome is definitely not fun to play.\" On the other hand, a-for-adventure.com praised the graphics as well as the challenge provided for experienced adventure-gamers.\n\nAfter the end of support for the game, Gregory Montoir reverse engineered in 2007 the game engine and wrote a substitute which allowed the porting of the game to modern platforms, like the OpenPandora handheld.\n"}

It was produced by John Wayne, directed by William A. Wellman, and stars Wayne and Lauren Bacall.\n\nThe ship of Captain Tom Wilder, an American Merchant Mariner, is seized by the Chinese Communists, and he is imprisoned for two years. He is helped to escape using bribery and then given the uniform of a Soviet army officer. He is transported to Chiku Shan village by a large Chinese man who will not divulge why he was broken out of prison.\n\nThe village headman, Mr. Tso, explains all to the captain when he arrives: Wilder has been recruited to transport the people of Chiku Shan out of Red China to the British port of Hong Kong. In order to do this Captain Wilder must use a stolen, wood-burning, flat-bottomed, 19th Century stern-wheel riverboat. He will also need to utilize his detailed memory of the China coast to make a handmade chart and use an unreliable magnetic compass by which to navigate. Finally, he must rely upon the determination of the villagers and use their other assets in order to escape to freedom.\n\nTheir plan has been underway for more than a year. The villagers have been gradually raising the bottom of their harbor channel with stones, in order to trap the local Red Chinese patrol boat once it has been lured inside. Sinking sampans loaded with rocks at the channel mouth will cause it to run aground and be trapped while the village makes its escape. They have also been quietly accumulating arms, ranging from Browning machine guns to Mosin–Nagant rifles and Nagant revolvers. They are forced to deal with the complication of the Communist Feng family, who must be brought along so they cannot inform on the rest of the villagers or be shot for allowing the escape.\n\nThe villagers include the riverboat's Chief Engineer, a U.S. Navy-trained marine engineer named Tack, who helps to take over and steal the steamboat ferry. Tack and Wilder bring the stern wheeler to Chiku Shan village, where she is loaded with furnace firewood and boiler water, provisioned, and given the name of the village.\n\nWilder is attracted to a tough and determined American named Cathy Grainger, whose father is a medical missionary in Chiku Shan village. Dr. Grainger was recently murdered by the Red Chinese following his failed surgery on a political commissar. Wilder is forced to inform Cathy of her father's death just before the villagers leave Chiku Shan, to keep her from staying behind. She refuses to believe him.\n\nFollowing their plan, the villagers lure the patrol boat into the harbor and trap it there. They flee down the coast, bluffing their way past a People's Liberation Army Navy destroyer, then disappearing into a fog bank, hiding by day and sailing by night. Along the way, the Fengs first poison the food supply and then during a storm attempt to take over the riverboat, an attempt that fails. During the storm, Cathy comes to terms with her feelings for and attraction to the gruff Captain Wilder.\n\nForced by a shortage of wood and fresh water, the \"Chiku Shan\" pulls into the Graveyard of Ships at Honghai Bay. Captain Wilder orders the wrecks stripped of wood for fuel and water siphoned from depressions and tanks for the boiler and for drinking water. A heavy timber plows through the stern wheel while mooring the steamboat, snapping one of its paddle blades. This forces Wilder to stay in the Graveyard longer than he had planned to repair it. At the same time, Cathy goes ashore and returns after learning that Wilder had told her the truth about her father's death. The Fengs are put off, only to be taken back aboard when the pursuing Red Chinese destroyer shells the Graveyard and sends its powered boats in search of the ferry, which has run into a marshy estuary and disappeared.\n\nDue to the fact smoke would give away their position, the villagers both pole and tow the riverboat through miles of marshlands until they reach the open sea beyond the destroyer's search area. Tack fires up the boiler, and the \"Chiku Shan\" proceeds to Hong Kong with her 170-plus refugees. Her triumphant arrival there is greeted by the repeated sounding of steam whistles and ship's sirens from every vessel in the harbor.\n\nThe film's screenplay was written by Albert Sidney Fleischman, based on his novel, and was produced by Wayne's Batjac Productions. Location filming took place in and near China Camp, a shrimp fishing village in the San Francisco Bay. Additional filming occurred at Point Orient shrimp camp (located on Point San Pablo) where the film crew was largely based in what is now known as Point San Pablo Yacht Harbor.\n\nThe Chinese Communist soldiers who search the village are armed with Model 1891 Mosin–Nagant rifles (probably ex-U.S. Rifle, 7.62 mm, Model of 1916 rifles) rather than the more appropriate Model 91/30s the Communists would have carried, having been exported to Mao's army during the Chinese Civil War. The determination as to model can be made in the scene where Captain Wilder is shown watching Mr. Feng in his car with the Mosin–Nagant laid across his knees. The single blade front sight and thick barrel bands of the Model 1891 are unmistakable.\n\nThe real Blood Alley was located in Shanghai, where Fleischman had visited as a sailor on the USS Albert T. Harris (DE-447). He was paid $5000 for the rights for his novel and was allowed to write the screenplay.\n\nThe Communist patrol boat that the villagers trap on their artificial reef was actually a rescue boat on loan to the film company by the U.S. Air Force.\n\nWayne plays a Merchant Marine captain in a role originally intended for Robert Mitchum prior to an altercation with the producers. Mitchum was fired from the production by Wellman. Wayne took over the lead after Gregory Peck turned the film down and Humphrey Bogart requested a large amount of money to assume the role.\n\nSwedish actress Anita Ekberg, veteran actor Paul Fix, and film thug Mike Mazurki all play Chinese roles.\n\nThe film was promoted by the appearance of Wayne on the number-one rated television show, \"I Love Lucy\". In an unusual two-episode arc airing as the show's season opener on October 10, 1955, Lucy and Ethel steal Wayne's footprints from the forecourt of Grauman's Chinese Theater the night before the premiere of \"Blood Alley\", and complications ensue. At one point early in the episode, a studio employee interrupts Wayne in his dressing room to show him a poster for \"Blood Alley\".\n\nDespite the star power of its lead actors and director, \"Blood Alley\" received a lukewarm reception from critics. \"The New York Times\" said, \"\"Blood Alley\", despite its exotic, oriental setting, is a standard chase melodrama patterned on a familiar blueprint.\" Today's critics have focused on \"Blood Alley\"s anti-communist aspect. DVD Talk called it \"preposterous but entertaining\" and said, \"Wayne and Bacall have no chemistry at all\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1486032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1486032", "title": "Buddy film", "text": "Buddy film\n\nThe buddy film is a film genre in which two (or on occasion, more than two) people—often both men—are put together. The two often contrast in personality, which creates a different dynamic onscreen than a pairing of two people of the opposite gender. The contrast is sometimes accentuated by an ethnic difference between the two. The buddy film is commonplace in American cinema; unlike some other film genres, it endured through the 20th century with different pairings and different themes.\n\nA buddy film portrays the pairing of two people, often the same sex, historically men. A friendship between the two people is the key relationship in a buddy film. The two people often come from different backgrounds or have different personalities, and they tend to misunderstand one another. Through the events of the buddy film, they gain a stronger friendship and mutual respect. Buddy films often deal with crises of masculinity, especially related to class, race, and gender. \"American Masculinities: A Historical Encyclopedia\" explains, \"[Buddy films] offer male movie–going audiences an opportunity to indulge in a form of male bonding and behavior usually discouraged by social constraints.\" Ira Konigsberg wrote in \"The Complete Film Dictionary\", \"Such films extol the virtues of male comradeship and relegate male–female relationships to a subsidiary position.\"\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" in 2001 called the genre \"a necessary escapist fantasy\", writing, \"It's one of the few arenas where men can openly express their feelings for each other, even though men on screen today seem less comfortable with each other than ever before.\" In buddy films, the two men are markedly different, and their relationship with each other is challenged by events in the film. The two are often different enough that one is aggravated by the other. The interaction between two men also differs from the interaction between a man and a woman, which shapes a film's dynamics. Robert Kolker writes in \"A Cinema of Loneliness\", \"The buddy complex views sexuality as an obstacle to manly acts. But this denial of sexuality carries a covert admission of the possibilities of homosexuality, which, of course, is inadmissible.\" Kolker says the main characters typically have relationships with female secondary characters who are relegated to the background. In the 1962 Italian film \"Il sorpasso\" (English title: \"The Easy Life\"), the characters Roberto and Bruno spend time together and grow emotionally attached. Sergio Rigoletto writes, \"Their statements of emotional proximity are... always quite oblique... in doing so they comply with the dominant social conventions according to which the love between two men cannot be clearly spoken in films.\" While the characters do not have sex with women in the film, they express desire for heterosexual adventures. Women in the film are secondary characters and possess traits that negatively contrast them with the male–male relationship.\n\nA female buddy film is similar to a buddy film except that the main characters are female, and it is centered on their situation. The cast may be mainly female depending on the plot. \"The female buddy film is a recent trend in mainstream cinema. However, \"Thelma and Louise\" in the early ‘90s had a similar popular impact to \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\", paving the way for onscreen female friendships such as those in \"Waiting to Exhale\" and \"Walking and Talking,\" and the relationship between Evelyn Couch and Ninny Threadgoode in \"Fried Green Tomatoes\"\",\".\"\n\nBuddy films are often hybridized with other film genres, such as road movies, Westerns, comedies, and action films featuring cops. The \"threats to [the] masculinity\" of the male–male relationship depend on the genre: women in comedies, the law in films about outlaw buddies, and criminals in action films about cop buddies.\nThe buddy film is more common to cinema in the United States than cinema in other Western countries, which tend to focus on male–female romantic relationships or an individual male hero. Film historian David Thomson observes that buddy films are rare among British and French films, \"You just wouldn't see three Englishmen behave the way American men do, who are truly happiest when they are together with other men.\" Portrayal of male bonding in the United States traces back to 19th-century author Mark Twain's characters Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer as a \"good boy-bad boy combo\", as well as Huck Finn and the slave Jim in Twain's 1884 novel \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\". Vaudeville acts in early 20th century United States often featured male pairs.\n\nFrom the 1930s to the 1960s in the United States, male comedy duos often appeared in buddy films. Laurel and Hardy and Abbott and Costello were popular in the 1930s and 1940s. Laurel and Hardy starred in films like \"Sons of the Desert\" (1933), and Abbott and Costello starred in films like \"Buck Privates\" (1941). Another comedy duo was Wheeler & Woolsey, who starred in \"Half Shot at Sunrise\" (1930). Bing Crosby and Bob Hope starred together in the 1940 Paramount Pictures film \"Road to Singapore\", which led to other 1940s buddy films that the \"Los Angeles Times\" described as \"escapist wartime fantasies\". Hope and Crosby starred together in a series of films that lasted to the 1960s. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis were a popular duo in the 1950s, and Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon were famous in the 1960s, starring in the hit 1969 film \"The Odd Couple\".\n\nA major departure from the more comic buddy films of the era was Akira Kurosawa's 1949 Japanese film \"Stray Dog\", starring Toshirō Mifune and Takashi Shimura. It was a more serious police procedural film noir that served as a precursor to the buddy cop film genre.\n\nThroughout the 1960s and the 1970s, the feminist movement and \"a widespread questioning\" of social institutions influenced buddy films. The films explored male friendships more dramatically and encouraged individualism—particularly to be free from women and society. Critics like Molly Haskell and Robin Wood saw the decades' films as \"a backlash from the feminist movement.\" Philippa Gates wrote, \"To punish women for their desire for equality, the buddy film pushes them out of the center of the narrative... By making both protagonists men, the central issue of the film becomes the growth and development of their friendship. Women as potential love interests are thus eliminated from the narrative space.\" The buddy films of these decades were also hybridized with road movies. The decades' buddy films included \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" (1969), \"Easy Rider\" (1969), \"Midnight Cowboy\" (1969), \"Thunderbolt and Lightfoot\" (1974), and \"Dog Day Afternoon\" (1975). The \"Los Angeles Times\" said films like \"Scarecrow\" (1973) and \"All the President's Men\" (1974) reflected the \"paranoia and alienation\" felt in the era. Beyond Hollywood, a notable buddy road movie of that era was the Bollywood \"Curry Western\" film \"Sholay\" (1975), which was the highest-grossing Indian film of all time.\n\nBiracial buddy films emerged in the 1970s and 1980s; Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder initiated the movement with \"Silver Streak\" (1976) and \"Stir Crazy\" (1980). Eddie Murphy was a key actor in biracial buddy films, starring in \"48 Hours\" (1982) with Nick Nolte and in \"Trading Places\" (1983) with Dan Aykroyd. Throughout the 1980s, the individual roles in biracial buddy films are reversed. The \"racial other... is too civilized\" while the white man \"is equipped for survival in... the urban landscape\".\n\nThe 1980s was a popular decade for action films, and the genre that \"blended masculinity, heroism, and patriotism into an idealized image\" was hybridized with buddy films. Following the Civil Rights Movement, black advancement was also reflected in more common biracial pairings. In this decade, the buddy cop film took the place of the buddy road movie. Action films with biracial pairings include the 1982 film \"48 Hours\" starring Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte and the 1987 film \"Lethal Weapon\" starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. \"American Masculinities\" writes, \"The African-American character is typically the sidekick to the white hero and isolated from the African-American community. He thus offers his skills and bravery for the preservation of mainstream (white) cultural values.\" Another combination of the action film and the buddy film in the 1980s and another biracial reversal was the 1988 film \"Die Hard\" in which Bruce Willis's heroic character John McClane is supported by the black cop Al (played by Reginald VelJohnson).\n\nIn the early 1990s, the masculine figure in films became more sensitive, and some buddy films \"contemplated a masculinity that required sensitive relations between men\". Such films included \"The Fisher King\" (1991) and \"The Shawshank Redemption\" (1994). The decade also saw new approaches to the genre. The 1991 film \"Thelma & Louise\" featured a female pairing of Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon, and the 1993 film \"The Pelican Brief\" featured a male–female platonic pairing of Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington. The 1998 film \"Rush Hour\" featured a nonwhite male pairing of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, which the \"Los Angeles Times\" said symbolized color blindness in American cinema.\n\nBiracial buddy films continued in the 1990s and 2000s and were combined with different genres, such as \"Another 48 Hours\" (1990), \"White Men Can't Jump\" (1992), \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994), \"Wild Wild West\" (1999), \"Miami Vice\" (2006) and the \"Men in Black\" series, \n\nAlso in the 1990s and 2000s, John Woo's Hollywood films imported the \"wuxia\" \"themes of loyalty and trust\" from his previous Hong Kong-produced films to create different takes on male bonding. Kin–Yan Szeto writes in \"The Martial Arts Cinema of the Chinese Diaspora\", \"[In] his third Hollywood film, \"Face/Off\"... Woo manages to deploy and politicize themes of homosociality with the possibility of contesting hegemonic masculinity that consolidates kinship and family.\" Woo's 2001 World War II film \"Windtalkers\" depicted two buddy pairs, with each pair indicating inequality through ethnicity (white American soldiers protecting Navajo code talkers but ready to kill the talkers to protect the code). Szeto explains, \"Woo uses the twin buddy pairs to explore the shifting meanings and multiple possibilities in interracial bonding, rather than simply recuperating and empowering dominant positions for white heterosexual men.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It originally aired on YouTube on February 4, 2016, and has run for eight seasons.\n\n\"BuzzFeed Unsolved\" follows Ryan Bergara and co-host Shane Madej who discuss unsolved crimes, haunted places, alleged demonic possessions and historical occurrences. While the topics of discussion are often morbid, most episodes are presented in some form of a comedic manner. The show is filmed primarily in Los Angeles with some episodes having parts filmed across the U.S, and even some in other countries. \n\nThe show has also become a ratings hit for BuzzFeed, regularly featuring as one of the network's most-watched shows. Prior to the premiere of the eighth season, BuzzFeed renewed the show for a ninth season, set to air in late 2018. \n\nThe show's success has also spawned a spin-off dedicated to sports, which airs on Facebook Watch. Bergara and Zack Evans host the series.\n\nThe \"Buzzfeed Unsolved: True Crime\" and \"Supernatural\" shows are currently co-hosted by Ryan Bergara and Shane Madej. Madej took over from the original co-host, Brent Bennett, in late 2016. The greatest difference between Bennett and Madej lay in their responses to Bergara's theories: unlike Bennett, who would humor Bergara, Madej stands firm as a skeptic; this stark dichotomy proved the missing piece of the puzzle for the show. Other important members of the main Unsolved crew include TJ Marchbank, 1st AD, Devon Joralman, line producer, and cameraman Mark Celestino. \n\nThe contrast between Bergara's belief in conspiracies and the paranormal versus Madej’s skepticism provides the majority of the dialogue. Bergara strongly believes in otherworldly spirits like ghosts or poltergeists, and frequently defends the existence of these throughout the series. However, Bergara shows reluctance towards things such as Bigfoot and sometimes aliens. Madej is a true skeptic of all that is non-scientific and constantly provides comedic relief toward spiritual encounters. Still he tends to regard Bigfoot and aliens as somewhat realistic or grounded in reality.\n\nIn \"BuzzFeed Unsolved: Supernatural\" Season 4 \"Ancient Aliens\" contributor Giorgio Tsoukalos was featured in the discussion about a potential UFO sighting. A recurring guest on the show, in person and by mentions is a \"Vatican approved exorcist\" Father Gary Thomas, who counsels the hosts how to and how not to approach the entities. Ricky Goldsworth, Ryan’s serial killer alter ego, sometimes emerges during the episodes.\n\nThe \"Hot Daga\" is a animated mini show series shown at the end of Post Mortem episodes, created, written and narrated by host Shane Madej. The first episode of the Hot Daga Saga began at the end of the Post Mortem episode \"The Boy in the Box - Q+A\". Although at the beginning of episodes Madej jokes that the show is commissioned by Madej's cohost Ryan Bergara, Bergara is infamously not a fan of the series. However Bergara listens to the gripping show as it is narrated to the audience. . \n\nNotable characters include Pam, the evil hotdog witch, Gene, the wonderfully written french fries, Maizie, a hologram lesbian corn, and the Plupples (fruits that are like peaches, but sexier and blue). Another character, Dr. Goondis, is voiced by Ryan against his will, as Shane Madej spliced many of his dialogues from Unsolved and connected them to create the voice of the character. The series originated when Madej jokingly wanted a skate boarding hot dog at the end of a Q + A episode, and it has grown to multiple mini-episodes and musical numbers. Fans of the series have also made season compilations on YouTube for other fans to watch the shorts in their entirety.\n"}

Several new stories using Charlton's \"Action Heroes\" appeared, before they were sold to DC Comics in 1983. After the cancellation of \"Charlton Bullseye\", stories intended for the title were published in \"Scary Tales\" #36–40, which explains the superhero story \"Mr. Jigsaw\" in issue #38 and \"Dragon Force\" in issue #40. Several other unpublished stories for the title were published by AC Comics.\n\nAccording to the 1980 press release for the series, an artist showed up at the Charlton offices and offered to work for them for free in hopes of accumulating enough credits to get a job with one of the two leading comics publishers. \"Charlton Bullseye\" was based around this concept; contributors to the series were paid only in contributor copies, all original art was returned to the artists after publication, and contributors would hold the copyrights to any original characters they introduced.\n\n\nIn 1985, a final attempt at a revival was spearheaded by new editor T.C.

In 1924, Samama-Chikli directed a medium-length film called \"Ain Al-Ghazal\" (\"The Girl from Carthage\") thus making him, one of the very first native filmmakers on the North African continent. In 1966, the first feature Tunisian film (95 minutes) \"Al-Fajr\" (\"The Dawn\") was directed and produced by Omar Khlifi; it was shot on a 35 mm film. Tunisia also hosts the Carthage Film Festival which has been taking place since 1966. The festival gives priority to films from Arab and African countries. It is the oldest film festival on the African continent and the Arab World.\n\nIn 1927, the first Tunisian film distribution company, Tunis-Film, started its activities. After independence, movies were exclusively produced by Société Anonyme Tunisienne de Production et d'Expansion Cinématographique (SATPEC) which controlled cinema and filming productions in the country at the time. Nevertheless, during the 1980s, private production companies and studios emerged and wanted to make Tunisia the Mediterranean Hollywood. The producer Tarak Ben Ammar, a nephew of Wasila Bourguiba, succeeded in attracting some big production companies to shoot inside his studios in Monastir. Major foreign movies were filmed in Tunisia including Roman Polanski's \"Pirates\" and Franco Zeffirelli's \"Jesus of Nazareth\". After visiting Tunisia George Lucas was seduced by the natural beauty and authentic old architecture of some Southern Tunisian towns where he decided to film important scenes of \"Star Wars\", as well as \"Indiana Jones\". Moreover, Anthony Minghella filmed the nine Academy Awards winner \"The English Patient\" in a south-west oasis of the country.\n\nWhen it comes to domestic productions, they were rare: the few movies which were produced since 1967 tried to reflect the new social dynamics, development, identity research and modernity shock. Some of them achieved a relative success outside Tunisia such as \"La Goulette\" (\"Halq El-Wadi\" 1996) directed by Ferid Boughedir which showed a flashback of typical community life in the small suburb of La Goulette in a period where Muslims, Jews and Christians lived together in tolerance and peace. \"Halfaouine: Child of the Terraces\" (\"Asfour Stah\" 1990), from the same director Boughdir is possibly the biggest popular success in the history of Tunisian Cinema. The movie showed the life of a child from Tunis (Halfouine suburb) in the 60s who was on a quest to understand relationships, the world of women and how to be a man. In another earlier movie entitled Man of Ashes (\"Rih Essedd\" 1986) Boughdir was as always depicting Tunisian society without fear or favour and talked about prostitution, paedophilia and inter-faith relations between Tunisian Muslims and Tunisian Jews. In the 1991's film \"Bezness\", he talked about the emerging sexual tourism inside the country. \"The Ambassadors\" (As-Soufraa 1975) directed by Naceur Ktari portrayed the life of immigrant Maghrebins in France and their struggle against racism. The film won the Golden Tanit for the best picture during the Carthage Film Festival in 1976, the special jury award from the Locarno International Film Festival in the same year and it has been classified in the \"Un Certain Regard\" category during the 1978 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe first Tunisian actress was Haydée Chikly, who starred in the short film, \"Zohra\" in 1922. The first feature film to be directed by a woman was \"Fatma 75\" (1975) by Selma Baccar. Subsequent female directors films such as Néjia Ben Mabrouk's \"Sama\" (1988) and Moufida Tlatli's \"The Silences of Palace\" (1994).\n\nIn 2007, several films were produced and grabbed public attention such as \"Making Of\" directed by Nouri Bouzid and Nejib Belkadi's \"VHS Kahloucha\".\n\nIn 2013, Abdellatif Kechiche was the first-ever Tunisian director to win the Palme D'Or award. For his film \"Blue Is the Warmest Colour\" he split the award with his two lead actresses.\n\nOn March 21, 2018, the country opened its first City of Culture, a project one of its kind in Africa and the Arab world , located in downtown Tunis. The complex contains several theaters, cinemas, screens, art and history galeries, exhibition halls, a contemporary and modern art museum, a national book centre and a cultural investment centre. \nAs of March 2018, there were 22 screens all across Tunisia.\n\nThe first ever Cineplex in Tunisia is set to open in Tunis City in Tunis in summer 2018, it will consist of 8 screeens and will be operated by Les Cinémas Gaumont Pathé. Two other multiplexes are set to open by Les Cinémas Gaumont Pathé in the coming years, one containing 8 screens at new Azur city mall in Banlieu Sud of Tunis and one of 6 screens in Sousse. Hotel chain La cigale announced in 2017, that it is building a hotel along with a mall and a multiplex of 10 screens in Gammarth, Banlieue Nord of Tunis and is set to open in 2020.\n\nAs of July 2018, there are 24 screens all across Tunisia.\n\nTunisia has submitted films for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film on an irregular basis since 1995. The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. As of 2009, only two Tunisian films have been submitted for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and neither was nominated for an Oscar.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11275122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11275122", "title": "Dance science", "text": "Dance science\n\nDance science is the scientific study of dance and dancers, as well as the practical application of scientific principles to dance. Its aims are the enhancement of performance, the reduction of injury, and the improvement of well-being and health.\n\nDance medicine and science as a field of study developed in the 1970s and 80s out of the field of sports medicine. In the early 1980s, the American Dance Festival (ADF) started including dance medicine courses in their course work for dancers. When ADF moved to Duke University, physicians from Duke University Hospital became interested in dancers. Then, in 1990, the International Association for Dance Medicine and Science (IADMS) was formed by an international group of dance medicine practitioners, dance educators, dance scientists, and dancers. Membership of IADMS began with 48 members in 1991, and has grown to over 900 members in 35 countries as of 2016.\n\nDance science as an academic discipline has been evolving over the past 20 years. In the United Kingdom, three degrees (at master's level) now exist: one at the University of Bedfordshire, one at the University of Wolverhampton, and one at the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in London. With regards to dance science research, another UK institution which has staff and students active in the area is the University of Birmingham. Some undergraduate degrees in dance, or other dance courses, also include one or several modules in dance science, with the aim of promoting healthy dance practices. These include the University of Wolverhampton, the Royal Academy of Dance, and Bird College.\n\nSeveral universities in the United States also offer dance science courses as part of their dance curriculum, accommodating both undergraduate and graduate level students. These include, but are not limited to: Cornish College of the Arts, Columbia College of Chicago, California State - Long Beach, Elon University, Florida State University, Goucher College, Long Island University - Brooklyn Campus, Ohio State University, Ohio University, UCLA - Irvine, University of Colorado, University of Illinois - Urbana Champagne, and the University of Oregon.\n\nTypically, the subject areas within dance science are similar to those studied in \"sports science\", though naturally with a focus on dance and the special considerations that this involves. They include: physiology, anatomy, kinesiology, psychology, biomechanics, nutrition, and similar. However, unlike sports science, dance science sometimes also studies related topics such as creativity and somatic techniques, including the practices of Pilates, yoga, Alexander technique, Feldenkrais method, etc.\n\nSome dance companies employ dance scientists to provide support services, such as physiological testing, psychological support, conditioning and nutritional counseling. Such professionals include physical therapists, nutritionists, pilates instructors, massage therapists, and dance medicine physicians. Dancers that are not employed by a dance company that offers rehabilitation benefits on-site can sometimes have access to such facilities within their city of residence. Dancers in New York City have access to The Harkness Center for Dance Injuries, located at the NYU-Hospital for Joint Diseases, NYU Langone Medical Center, which offers many subsidized and free services for the dance community. These services include \"clinics staffed by orthopedists and dance physical therapists; state-of-the art research and rehabilitation technology and free injury prevention screenings and lectures.\" Westside Physical Therapy, directed and founded by Marika Molnar - the first physical therapist hired by the New York City Ballet - is another example of a physical therapy clinic in New York City that offers specialized care to dancers (as well as to non-dancers).\n\nThe largest organization promoting dance science internationally is the International Association for Dance Medicine and Science (IADMS). As well as producing a scientific peer-reviewed journal, \"Journal of Dance Medicine and Science\", it also holds an annual conference. The Performing Arts Medicine Association (PAMA), which holds its annual symposium in Aspen-Snowmass, Colorado, is a unique organization that concerns itself with the injuries and health issues of musicians as well as dancers. In the UK, DanceUK is perhaps the foremost proponent of dance science and healthy dance practice more generally. A conference entitled \"From Cognition to Conditioning\" was held at Middlesex University in February 2007.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "488817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=488817", "title": "Danny Tenaglia", "text": "Danny Tenaglia\n\nDaniel \"Danny\" Tenaglia (born March 7, 1961) is a New York-based DJ and Grammy nominated record producer. He is also a 3 time International Dance Music Award winner, 3 time DJ Awards winner and 2 time Muzik Awards recipient.\n\nAt the age of ten, Tenaglia first started to collect records. In 1979, he began going to nightclub Paradise Garage, where DJ Larry Levan's genre-less blend of music appealed to him. This was the club model Tenaglia would one day emulate: Levan's bold style, the venue's plain décor, and the party's warmth and inclusiveness.\n\nTenaglia left New York in 1985 and started DJ-ing in Miami as a resident at Cheers nightclub, playing classic New York and Chicago house. He returned to New York five years later. At this time, he started to create some remixes, including Right Said Fred's \"I'm Too Sexy\" (1991), Jamiroquai's \"Emergency on Planet Earth\" (1993), and Madonna's \"Human Nature\" (1994).\n\nTenaglia's first mainstream success was with a remix of The Daou's \"Surrender Yourself\" (1993). The title of his 1995 debut artist album on New York's TRIBAL America/IRS Records described the genre as \"Hard & Soul\". Tenaglia cited his influences ranged from Patti LaBelle to Kraftwerk, with many lesser-known soul, R&B, Latin, samba and disco artists in between.\n\nSubsequent to this Tenaglia released three label compilations - \"Mix This Pussy\" (1994) and \"Can Your Pussy Do The Dog?\" (1995) for TRIBAL, and \"Gag Me with a Tune\" (1996) for Maxi.\n\nIn 1996, after working for a short time at the New York nightclub Roxy, Tenaglia started a Saturday night residency at Twilo, a position that brought him some public attention. Contrary to the music popular in New York at the time, Tenaglia was producing the more minimal, tech-y grooves originating in European production studios. This period produced remixes like Grace's \"Not Over Yet\" (1996) and Janet Jackson's \"The Pleasure Principle\" (1996). In 1998, he moved his residency over to NY club Tunnel.\n\nIn 1998, Danny released another full-length LP titled \"Tourism\". The album featured the notable track \"Elements\". With his own warped voice providing the narration, \"Elements\" walked the listener through the different components of a dance track in real time, going from kick to drum loop to snare hit, letting each layer over the other until the track exploded with dark, drum-heavy energy. \"Elements\" was #1 on the Billboard Dance Chart for two weeks in 1998. \"Music is the answer\" featuring Celeda (also on the LP Tourism) was on the top 40 charts in the UK. Next to ostentatious radio anthems, its simplicity was a revelation.\n\nThe release of his first installment in the UK-based Global Underground series of DJ mixes, titled Athens (2000), was well received. Back in New York, Tenaglia grew tired of Tunnel and sought a venue more similar to the Paradise Garage. He landed at Vinyl, a black-walled, single-environment, no-liquor club about one-quarter the size of Tunnel. He named the night \"Be Yourself,\" after the self-affirming, heavy-bottomed vocal track he had recently recorded with Chicago's Celeda.\n\nIn 2000, Tenaglia's annual party during Miami's Winter Music Conference outgrew its home at the cramped Groovejet and moved to just-opened superclub Space. DJ giants like Carl Cox danced on top of the speakers with the Deep Dish boys, Fatboy Slim mingled on the patio, and for a day the ego inherent to DJ culture evaporated: Tenaglia was hailed as the \"DJ's DJ.\" His revamp of Green Velvet's \"Flash\" won \"Best Remix\" at the UK's Muzik Awards, where he was also awarded the \"Best International DJ\" prize.\n\nIn the two years that followed, Tenaglia released another Global Underground installment titled London, remixed Billy Nichols' \"Give Your Body Up To The Music\" (a Garage anthem); got nominated for a Grammy (for his remix of Depeche Mode's \"I Feel Loved,\" also nominated for Best Dance Song) and won a Dancestar Lifetime Achievement award.\n\nIn 2003, Danny came full circle with the release of Choice: A Collection Of Classics, a two-CD mixed compilation that let him pay direct tribute to many of the artists who had influenced his sound and style. It featured artists such as Blaze, Adeva and Imagination, along with his own liner notes explaining the significance of each track. He also remixed another Garage classic (Yoko Ono's \"Walking On Thin Ice,\" which became her first Billboard number one ever), opened another Space during Winter Music Conference (the new location down the block), and took another Dancestar award, this time 'Best Party' for \"Be Yourself.\"\n\n\"Be Yourself\" took the same honor again in 2004, but by this time, Vinyl, now called Arc, had already been sold to condo developers. Danny closed the club on Sunday, April 25, 2004.\n\nSince then Danny has remained prolific in the clubs and has played in NYC locations including Avalon, Crobar, Pacha NYC, Roxy and Webster Hall. In 2007, Tenaglia participated in the Dance parade. After a long studio silence, Danny re-emerged in 2008 with a single on Tommy Boy Records, \"The Space Dance\". It was named in honor of his first weekly residency during the summer season of 2008 at renowned global clubbing institution Space Ibiza. The track reached number 1 on the Billboard Club Charts during November 2008.\n\nImmediately following that, Danny released his first compilation album in five years, entitled Futurism, also on Tommy Boy Records, with a nod to the modern dance floor and Danny's outlook for tomorrow's sounds. The compilation featured tracks from artists whom Danny had been championing for several years including Davide Squillace, The Wighnomy Brothers and Afefe Iku. On January 24, 2016, Danny was the closing DJ of yet another club, Pacha NYC. At the end of his 7-hour set, while taking requests, he made reference to his multiple club-closings, by rejecting some songs by stating that they were already played at the closing of Vinyl / Arc and others.\n\nAfter over 30 years of DJing Danny still continues to tour around the world. His commitment to playing new music and incorporating it with music from his past is still a very big part of his performances.\n\nIncluded:\nThe DJ Awards organizes the annual electronic music DJ awards event it is the only international ceremony for DJs and also the oldest, the awards are held once a year at Pacha club in Ibiza Spain it is one of the most important accolades an artist can win or be honoured by.\n\nTengalia has won the \"Best Set of the Season Award\" 2 times and the \"DJ's DJ Award\" 1 time and received 5 nominations overall.\n\nTengalia has achieved 3 wins from 15 nominations overall.\n\n\n"}

The leaves can be stopped from bouncing by a switch on the underside of the device.\n\nThe Flip Flap has a large cult following in Japan, but the popularity of the ornamental gadget is growing in the UK being marketed under the Tomy brand. Flip Flaps come in different models like the \"Q\" (which is round) and \"F\" (which has the shape of a flower pot). The big Flip Flaps (depends on the number) usually have three movements. Once you turn it on, the leaves begin to move up and down. If you tap one of the leaves, it shall begin to move seesaw to the direction in which the leaf was tapped.\n\nAs with other Tomy manufactured solar powered toys, there are fake Flip Flaps being sold in stores. These are often cheaply made in China and are limited to only an up-and-down motion, and are incapable of the 3 different movements characteristic of authentic Flip Flaps. The fake and real versions look extremely similar, but consumers can differentiate between the two by looking for the Tomy logo, almost entirely Japanese characters on the box (limited English), and dark green leaves (fake Flip Flaps have light green leaves, as opposed to the darker, real ones of slightly better quality). Other Flip Flap knockoffs are sold that are solely inspired by Flip Flaps, but not directly based on Flip Flaps, as they are sold in very different packaging than the authentic ones and have flowers that look different.\n\nAccording to the EU patent database, the patent was copied by a small Chinese company called \"SHENZHEN LONGGANG PINGHU TENGY\". It seems that Tomy has sold the licence to market this product as \"Flip Flap\" in EU and the Chinese company infringed the copyright. .\n\nThe electronics for this toys is well known and was originally used for electronic clocks.

Eighty-six people were reported to have died and another 127 were injured when a locomotive engineer fell asleep and ran his train into the rear of another near Hammond, Indiana. The circus train held 400 performers and roustabouts of the Hagenbeck-Wallace circus. \n\nThe Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus used old wooden cars that were lit with oil lamps. The circus train had two train segments, and the segment that was loaded with animals was dispatched prior, and had left the train with all the performers and workers on the tracks. The cars were being moved to a spot near Gary, Indiana, so a mechanical problem could be addressed, and some of the cars had been left on the main line track.\n\nIn the early morning hours of June 22, 1918, Alonzo Sargent was at the throttle of a Michigan Central Railroad troop train pulled by New York Central Class K80r 4-6-2 \"Pacific\" number 8485 with 20 empty Pullman cars. He was aware that his train was closely following a slower circus train. Sargent, an experienced man at the throttle, had slept little if at all in the preceding 24 hours. The effects of a lack of sleep, several heavy meals, some kidney pills, and the gentle rolling of his locomotive are thought to have caused him to fall asleep at the controls.\n\nAt approximately 4 a.m., he missed at least two automatic signals and warnings posted by a brakeman of the 26-car circus train, which had made an emergency stop to check a hot box on one of the flatcars. The second train plowed into the caboose and four rear wooden sleeping cars of the circus train at a rail crossing known as Ivanhoe Interlocking ( east of Hammond, Indiana) at an estimated speed of . Upon impact, the circus trains lamps ignited the wooden cars and quickly spread. \n\nTwo men were stationed at the Ivanhoe Signal Tower, about 100 feet from the accident, and phoned multiple people in an attempt to raise help for the victims. The first on the scene was the Mayor of Gary, Indiana, who brought the fire chief, and then phoned all the medical personnel he could. Triage for the victims was performed at the Michigan Central Railroad station in Hammond, Indiana and then they were sent to St. Margaret's Hospital.\n\nMost of the 86 who were killed in the train wreck perished in the first 35 seconds after the collision. Then, the wreckage caught on fire. The fire was so intense that many of the victims were thought initially to be some of the African-American porters on the train, until later investigations identified it as being severe burns.\n\nAmong the dead were Arthur Dierckx and Max Nietzborn of the Great Dierckx Brothers, a strongman act, and Jennie Ward Todd of The Flying Wards. There were also 127 injuries.\n\nFive days later, 53 of those killed were buried in Woodlawn Cemetery, at the intersection of Cermak Road and Des Plaines Avenue in Forest Park, Illinois, in a section set aside as Showmen's Rest, which had been purchased by the Showmen's League of America only a few months earlier. The section is surrounded by statues of elephants in a symbolic mourning posture.\n\nOnly five of those buried were formally identified, and so the graves of most of the casualties are marked \"Unknown Male\" or \"Unknown Female.\" One grave is marked \"Smiley\", one \"Baldy\", and another \"4 Horse Driver\". The more recent graves at the location are those who traveled with the circus and wanted to be buried there after they died.\n\nThe wreck is described in great detail in the report of the joint Interstate Commerce Commission and Indiana Public Service Commission following an investigation.\n\nSargent, who was under arrest, refused to testify at any of the hearings on advice of his counsel. In his report of the accident to the officials of the railroad company, he made the following statement:\n\nI was called shortly after 8 p.m. June 21, for deadhead equipment west, engine 8485, for 10.15 p.m., and left Kalamazoo, Michigan at 10.35 p.m. Had been up since 5 a.m., June 21, dead heading from my home in Jackson on Train No. 41, and had had little or no sleep during the day. Had had a couple of heavy meals before going out, realizing that I would not get anything more to eat until some time the next morning. Leaving Kalamazoo, followed freight train to Michigan City yard and stopped at signal near Center Street. Got proceed signal from some one on ground, pulled up to Michigan City, stopped at standpipe and took water. While following this freight train, we stopped first between Dowagiac and Pokagon on account signal at danger. Stopped again at Pokagon and Niles for same reason, this freight train being ahead.\n\n<br>Leaving Michigan City, had clear track to East Gary and there caught block of train ahead, reduced speed, but did not have to stop, as block cleared before I reached it. Reduced speed going through Gary to comply with rules, and saw no more signals at caution or danger until approaching curve east of Ivanhoe, where I found second signal east of wreck at caution. Was going about 25 miles per hour at this point, but did not reduce speed, as I expected that the next signal would probably clear before I got to it, or that I would see it, if at danger, in time to stop. The wind was blowing very hard into cab on my side and I closed the window, which made the inside of cab more comfortable. Before reaching the next signal I dozed on account of heat in cab and missed it. Not realizing what had happened to me until within 75 to 90 feet, I awoke suddenly and saw the tail or marker lights showing red on a train directly ahead of me. Not realizing that the rear end of this train was so close. I started to make a service application, but before completing it placed brake-valve handle into emergency position. We struck almost instantly after making the brake application. Don't know whether I closed the throttle or not, but think I did. Looked to see where the fireman was and saw he was running toward the gangway. Did not see a fusee, hear a torpedo, or see any other warning signal up to the time I saw the red tail lights. Wreck happened at about 4.05 a.m., June 22, and I stayed there for an hour or more assisting in getting people out of the wreckage. I have been in the service of the Michigan Central Railroad Co. for approximately 28 or 29 years, the last 16 of which I have been continuously employed as an engineer. I am in perfect physical condition, as well as mental condition, and have had no illness within 25 or 30 years requiring the service of a doctor. There was nothing defective about the air brakes or other mechanism of the engine or train that I was operating, nor was there any defective condition of any of the signals or track upon which I was operating to the best of my knowledge. The accident was due solely to the fact that I accidentally fell asleep, and I had no intent to injure any person, nor was same done with malice, but solely through an accident, as aforesaid.\n\nThe ICC report concluded, \"This accident was caused by Engine-man Sargent being asleep, and from this cause, failing to observe the stop indication of automatic signal 2581, and the warnings of the flagman of the circus train, and to be governed by them.\"\n\nThe report was also critical of the older wooden cars, whose oil lamps may have ignited the fire immediately after the collision.\n\nAlthough Sargent and his fireman, Gustave Klauss, were criminally charged in Lake County, Indiana, following a trial the jury found itself deadlocked, and a mistrial was declared. Prosecutors declined to re-try the case, and charges were dismissed on June 9, 1920.\n\nThe train wreck was on a Saturday, and its effects caused the show in Hammond and one in Monroe, Wisconsin on June 24 to be canceled. However, the circus performed on June 25 in Beloit, Wisconsin with other circuses providing some of the acts. \n\n\n"}

In 2014, Sharma's play \"Best Of\" (staged four times to rave reviews in Singapore and Malaysia) and \"Eclipse\" (staged in both Singapore and Scotland) were published.\n\nHaresh Sharma also wrote the lyrics to Singapore's National Day Parade 2011's withdrawn \"Fun Pack Song\", which modified the lyrics of Lady Gaga's 'Bad Romance' to widespread criticism.\n\nIn 2015, \"Fundamentally Happy\" was selected by \"The Business Times\" as one of the \"finest plays in 50 years\" alongside productions by Goh Poh Seng, Michael Chiang and Alfian Sa'at and others.\n\nBorn in Singapore, Sharma attended Tanjong Katong Secondary School, Temasek Junior College, as well as the National University of Singapore(Nus), where he majored in English Language and Literature. It was also at the National University of Singapore in 1987 where he met Alvin Tan, then a fellow undergraduate and founder of The Necessary Stage. He soon became involved in productions – first doing backstage, publicity, sound, and the occasional acting – then eventually moving on to scriptwriting when one of his plays won the NUS-Shell Short Play Competition in 1988.\n\n\n2.

They were well-known on Spanish language television in Latin America throughout much of the twentieth century before returning to Spain and attaining further success.\n\nHeirs of a long family tradition of circus performance, which stretches back to the nineteenth century, they were sons of Emilio Aragón the elder and nephews of José María and Teodoro Aragón - Emig, Pompoff y Teddy. Other members of the family with circus connections included their cousins Nabucodonosorcito and Zampabollos.\n\nGaby, Fofó y Miliki began their activities in Spain in 1939 at the Circo Price. In 1946, the three brothers emigrated across the Atlantic, where they remained for more than a quarter of a century. They first set up shop in Cuba, where they made their first incursions into the world of television in 1949. In the following years, the diffusion of their shows in other countries in Latin America made them familiar faces in Mexico, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, and the United States. Between 1965 and 1971 they moved to Puerto Rico, where they transmitted a daily program called El Show de las 5, one of the most popular and remembered shows in the history of TV in that country. \n\nIn 1970 they arrived in Argentina, and achieved great success through their program \"El zapato roto\" (The broken Shoe), which they then renamed \"El show de Gaby, Fofó y Miliki\". Soon a new member of the family, \"Fofito\" (the son of Fofó), made appearances.\n\nTwo years later, in 1972, they returned to Spain, contracting with Televisión Española to front a new program called \"El Gran Circo de TVE\". It was a great success, remaining on air until 1981, and became an enormous cultural phenomenon in Spain in the 1970s. The group was awarded a TP de Oro, a prestigious Spanish television award, for \"most popular personality\" in 1974.\n\nAfter the death of Fofó in 1976, the son of Miliki, Emilio Aragón Jr., joined the group under the name \"Milikito\". He is a mute clown, in the tradition of Harpo Marx, and communicates with a cow bell. Much later, after the show ended in 1981, \"Rody\", the youngest son of Fofó, joined the group in the persona of a black Cuban.\n\nFinally, the program (which in its final form was called \"El loco mundo de los payasos\", or \"The Crazy World of the Clowns\"), was retired from Spanish television in 1983. After several circus tours during the following two years, under the title \"El fabuloso mundo del circo\" (The Fabulous World of the Circus), the group (which by this time Miliki had already left) dissolved definitively.\n\n\n\nIn 1971 a comic strip, \"Gaby, Fofó, Miliki y Milikito\" (1971), was made, based on Los Payasos de la Tele. It was drawn by Felix Saborido.\n\n"}

{"id": "57685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57685", "title": "Music history", "text": "Music history\n\nMusic history, sometimes called historical musicology, is the highly diverse subfield of the broader discipline of musicology that studies music from a historical viewpoint.\nIn theory, \"music history\" could refer to the study of the history of any type or genre of music (e.g., the history of Indian music or the history of rock). In practice, these research topics are often categorized as part of ethnomusicology or cultural studies, whether or not they are ethnographically based. The terms \"music history\" and \"historical musicology\" usually refer to the history of the notated music of Western elites, sometimes called \"art music\" (by analogy to art history, which tends to focus on elite art).\n\nThe methods of music history include source studies (esp. manuscript studies), paleography, philology (especially textual criticism), style criticism, historiography (the choice of historical method), musical analysis, and iconography. The application of musical analysis to further these goals is often a part of music history, though pure analysis or the development of new tools of music analysis is more likely to be seen in the field of music theory. Some of the intellectual products of music historians include editions of musical works, biography of composers and other musicians, studies of the relationship between words and music, and the reflections upon the place of music in society.\n\nAlthough most performers of classical and traditional instruments receive some instruction in music, art pop, or rock and roll history from teachers throughout their training, the majority of formal music history courses are offered at the college level. In Canada, some music students receive training prior to undergraduate studies because examinations in music history (as well as music theory) are required to complete Royal Conservatory certification at the Grade 9 level and higher\n\nMost medium and large institutions will offer both types of courses. The two types of courses will usually differ in length (one to two semesters vs. two to four), breadth (many music appreciation courses begin at the late Baroque or classical eras and might omit music after WWII while courses for majors traditionally span the period from the Middle Ages to recent times), and depth. Both types of courses tend to emphasize a balance among the acquisition of musical repertory (often emphasized through listening examinations), study and analysis of these works, biographical and cultural details of music and musicians, and writing about music, perhaps through music criticism.\n\nMore specialized seminars in music history tend to use a similar approach on a narrower subject while introducing more of the tools of research in music history.The range of possible topics is virtually limitless. Some examples might be \"Music during World War I,\" \"Medieval and Renaissance instrumental music,\" \"Music and Process,\" \"Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\".\"\n\nThe methods and tools of music history are nearly as many as its subjects and therefore make a strict categorization impossible. However, a few trends and approaches can be outlined here. Like in any other historical discipline, most research in music history can be roughly divided into two categories: the establishing of factual and correct data and the interpretation of data. Most historical research does not fall into one category solely, but rather employs a combination of methods from both categories. It should also be noted that the act of establishing factual data can never be fully separate from the act of interpretation.\n\nArchival work may be conducted to find connections to music or musicians in a collection of documents of broader interests (e.g., Vatican pay records, letters to a patroness of the arts) or to more systematically study a collection of documents related to a musician. In some cases, where records, scores, and letters have been digitized, archival work can be done online. One example of a composer for whom archival materials can be examined online is the Arnold Schoenberg Center.\nPerformance practice draws on many of the tools of historical musicology to answer the specific question of how music was performed in various places at various times in the past. Scholars investigate questions such as which instruments or voices were used to perform a given work, what tempos (or tempo changes) were used, and how (or if) ornaments were used. Although performance practice was previously confined to early music from the Baroque era, since the 1990s, research in performance practice has examined other historical eras, such as how early Classical era piano concerti were performed, how the early history of recording affected the use of vibrato in classical music, or which instruments were used in Klezmer music.\n\nBiographical studies of composers can give a better sense of the chronology of compositions, influences on style and works, and provide important background to the interpretation (by performers or listeners) of works. Thus biography can form one part of the larger study of the cultural significance, underlying program, or agenda of a work; a study which gained increasing importance in the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nSociological studies focus on the function of music in society as well as its meaning for individuals and society as a whole. Researchers emphasizing the social importance of music (including classical music) are sometimes called New musicologists.\n\nSemiotic studies are most conventionally the province of music analysts rather than historians. However, crucial to the practice of musical semiotics – the interpretation of meaning in a work or style – is its situation in a historical context. The interpretative work of scholars such as Kofi Agawu and Lawrence Kramer fall between the analytic and the music historical.\n\nThe first studies of Western musical history date back to the middle of the 18th century. G.B. Martini published a three volume history titled \"Storia della musica\" (\"History of Music\") between 1757 and 1781. Martin Gerbert published a two volume history of sacred music titled \"De cantu de musica sacra\" in 1774. Gerbert followed this work with a three volume work \"Scriptores ecclesiastici de musica sacra\" containing significant writings on sacred music from the 3rd century onwards in 1784.\n\nIn the 20th century, the work of and others developed studies in Medieval music and early Renaissance music. Wolf's writings on the history of musical notation are considered to be particularly notable by musicologists. Historical musicology has played a critical role in renewed interest in Baroque music as well as medieval and Renaissance music. In particular, the authentic performance movement owes much to historical musicological scholarship. Towards the middle of the 20th century, musicology (and its largest subfield of historical musicology) expanded significantly as a field of study. Concurrently the number of musicological and music journals increased to create further outlets for the publication of research. The domination of German language scholarship ebbed as significant journals sprang up throughout the West, especially America.\n\nIn its most narrow definition, historical musicology is the music history of Western culture. Such a definition arbitrarily excludes disciplines other than history, cultures other than Western, and forms of music other than \"classical\" (\"art\", \"serious\", \"high culture\") or notated (\"artificial\") – implying that the omitted disciplines, cultures, and musical styles/genres are somehow inferior. A somewhat broader definition incorporating all musical humanities is still problematic, because it arbitrarily excludes the relevant (natural) sciences (acoustics, psychology, physiology, neurosciences, information and computer sciences, empirical sociology and aesthetics) as well as musical practice. The musicological sub-disciplines of music theory and music analysis have likewise historically been rather uneasily separated from the most narrow definition of historical musicology.\n\nWithin historical musicology, scholars have been reluctant to adopt postmodern and critical approaches that are common elsewhere in the humanities. According to Susan McClary (2000, p. 1285) the discipline of \"music lags behind the other arts; it picks up ideas from other media just when they have become outmoded.\" Only in the 1990s did historical musicologists, preceded by feminist musicologists in the late 1980s, begin to address issues such as gender, sexualities, bodies, emotions, and subjectivities which dominated the humanities for twenty years before (ibid, p. 10). In McClary's words (1991, p. 5), \"It almost seems that musicology managed miraculously to pass directly from pre- to postfeminism without ever having to change – or even examine – its ways.\" Furthermore, in their discussion on musicology and rock music, Susan McClary and Robert Walser also address a key struggle within the discipline: how musicology has often \"dismisse[d] questions of socio-musical interaction out of hand, that part of classical music's greatness is ascribed to its autonomy from society.\" (1988, p. 283)\n\nAccording to Richard Middleton, the strongest criticism of (historical) musicology has been that it generally ignores popular music. Though musicological study of popular music has vastly increased in quantity recently, Middleton's assertion in 1990—that most major \"works of musicology, theoretical or historical, act as though popular music did not exist\"—holds true. Academic and conservatory training typically only peripherally addresses this broad spectrum of musics, and many (historical) musicologists who are \"both contemptuous and condescending are looking for types of production, musical form, and listening which they associate with a \"different\" kind of music...'classical music'...and they generally find popular music lacking\"\n\nHe cites three main aspects of this problem (p. 104–6). The terminology of historical musicology is \"slanted by the needs and history of a particular music ('classical music').\" He acknowledges that \"there is a rich vocabulary for certain areas [harmony, tonality, certain part-writing and forms], important in musicology's typical corpus\"; yet he points out that there is \"an impoverished vocabulary for other areas [rhythm, pitch nuance and gradation, and timbre], which are less well developed\" in Classical music. Middleton argues that a number of \"terms are ideologically loaded\" in that \"they always involve selective, and often unconsciously formulated, conceptions of what music \"is\".\"\n\nAs well, he claims that historical musicology uses \"a methodology slanted by the characteristics of notation,\" 'notational centricity' (Tagg 1979, p. 28–32). As a result, \"musicological methods tend to foreground those musical parameters which can be easily notated\" such as pitch relationships or the relationship between words and music. On the other hand, historical musicology tends to \"neglect or have difficulty with parameters which are not easily notated\", such as tone colour or non-Western rhythms. In addition, he claims that the \"notation-centric training\" of Western music schools \"induces particular forms of \"listening\", and these then tend to be applied to \"all\" sorts of music, appropriately or not\". As a result, Western music students trained in historical musicology may listen to a funk or Latin song that is very rhythmically complex, but then dismiss it as a low-level musical work because it has a very simple melody and only uses two or five chords.\n\nNotational centricity also encourages \"reification: the score comes to be seen as 'the music', or perhaps the music in an ideal form.\" As such, music that does not use a written score, such as jazz, blues, or folk, can become demoted to a lower level of status. As well, historical musicology has \"an ideology slanted by the origins and development of a particular body of music and its aesthetic...It arose at a specific moment, in a specific context – nineteenth-century Europe, especially Germany – and in close association with that movement in the musical \"practice\" of the period which was codifying the very repertory then taken by musicology as the centre of its attention.\" These terminological, methodological, and ideological problems affect even works sympathetic to popular music. However, it is not \"that musicology \"cannot\" understand popular music, or that students of popular music should abandon musicology.\" (Middleton, p. 104).\n\nDuring the Lebanese Civil War, Lydia Canaan, musical pioneer widely regarded as the first rock star of the Middle East, defied convention, social stigma, socio-religious authorities, and broke millennia-old gender barriers with her musical splash. Her initial performances under the stage name Angel were historically unprecedented on more than one front; her career began with her risking her life to perform amidst enemy military attacks, her concerts literally being held in vicinities of Lebanon which were simultaneously being bombed. According to \"Arabian Woman\" magazine: \"As...A girl who grew up in the midst of a bloody civil war...Canaan was breaking down seemingly insurmountable barriers...She rocked the establishment\". As noted by \"The Gulf Today\": \"It is incredible that amidst the state of civil war that existed in Lebanon at that time, when most people had no idea if they would see another day, she managed to keep her ambitions alive\". \"Society\" magazine attests: \"In a small country that was ripped by war, there was this young girl making a difference\". Concerning Canaan's first concert as Angel, \"The Gulf Today\" writes: \"The first show produced a phenomenal reaction\". \"Society\" magazine states: \"Tickets were sold out but more teenagers stormed in to see the young Angel perform...To accommodate the crowd, the concert organizers had to stamp on each fan's hand as they ran out of tickets. It was...Her first success\". In 2015 Canaan was listed in the catalog of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's Library and Archives as the first rock star of the Middle East. Canaan is a prime example of how popular music can be categorized as music history in theory, though in practice fall under cultural studies.\n"}

It is suggested that the vast supply of communications Americans receive may elicit only a superficial concern with the problems of society. This would result in real societal action being neglected, while superficiality covers up mass apathy. Thus, it is termed \"dysfunctional\" as it indicates the inherent dysfunction of both mass media and social media during controversial incidents and events. The theory assumes that it is not in the best interests of people to form a social mass that is politically apathetic and inert. The term \"narcotizing dysfunction\" was identified in the article \"Mass Communication, Popular Taste and Organized Social Action\", by Paul F. Lazarsfeld, and Robert K. Merton.\n\nMass media's overwhelming flow of information has caused the populace to become passive in their social activism. Because the individual is assailed with information about a huge range of issues and problems and they are knowledgeable about or able to discuss these issues, they believe they are helping to resolve these issues. As more time is spent educating oneself on current issues, there is a decrease in time available to take organized social action. Courses of action may be discussed, but they are rather internalized and rarely come to fruition. In short, people have unwittingly substituted knowledge for action. People's consciences are clear, as they think they have done something to address the issue. However, being informed and concerned is not a replacement for action. Even though there are increasing numbers of political messages, information, and advertisements available through traditional media and online media, political participation continues to decline. People pay close attention to the media, but there is an overexposure of messages that can get confusing and contradictory so people do not get involved in the political process.\n\nThe term narcotizing dysfunction gained popularity from its use in the 1948 article \"Mass Communication, Popular Taste, and Organized Social Action\", by Paul F. Lazarsfeld and Robert K. Merton. In Lazarsfeld and Merton's article, it appears as the third function of mass media's problematic social effects, alongside social status conferral function and the enforcement of social norms.\n\n\n"}

According to an interview in \"The Comic Reader\" #202 (May 1982) the series was instead put on indefinite hiatus “due to Len Wein's inability to find the time to write it.” Launched instead was \"Arion, Lord of Atlantis\", which had run for several months as a backup feature in \"The Warlord\".\n\nWhen Bob Rozakis asked him about the character, Len Wein responded with:\n\nEven I had forgotten about Pandora Pann. The answer is that Ross Andru penciled most of a terrific-looking 15 page insert to be included in \"Swamp Thing\", before going off into her own book. But for reasons sadly lost to history (meaning, for the life of me, I can no longer remember why), we never went ahead with the series. A shame too, since it would have preceded things like Tomb Raider and Relic Hunter by decades. And there you have another Secret Behind the Comics.\n--Len Wein\n\n"}

The Photographophone could record and reproduce speech and music through a celluloid film. The process started by speaking into a microphone. The electrical signal from the microphone through a transformer supplied electric current from a battery pack that caused a corresponding variation in the light of an arc (later used an incandescent lamp). The light from the arc lamp passes through the cylindrical lens slot which created sharp white lines on the moving sensitive film. This film, after being taken out of the box and developed, shows a series of perpendicular striations parallel to one another, which are really a photographic record of the sound waves originally entering the telephone transmitter. \nTo reproduce the sound an projector directs light through the film traveling with the velocity equal to that with which the record is made. Behind the film a sensitive selenium cell is mounted receiving the variations in light producing a variation in its resistance and a corresponding effect in the telephone receivers connected.\n\n\"It is truly a wonderful process: sound becomes electricity, becomes light, causes chemical action, becomes light and electricity again, and finally sound.\"\n"}

{"id": "1017592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1017592", "title": "Robert Wilson (director)", "text": "Robert Wilson (director)\n\nRobert Wilson (born October 4, 1941) is an American experimental theater stage director and playwright who has been described by the media as \"[America]'s – or even the world's – foremost avant-garde 'theater artist. Over the course of his wide-ranging career, he has also worked as a choreographer, performer, painter, sculptor, video artist, and sound and lighting designer. \n\nHe is best known for his collaborations with Philip Glass on \"Einstein on the Beach\", and with numerous other artists, including Heiner Müller, William S. Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, Lou Reed, Tom Waits, David Byrne, Laurie Anderson, Gavin Bryars, Rufus Wainwright, Marina Abramović, Willem Dafoe, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Darryl Pinckney, Richard Gallo, and Lady Gaga. In 1991 Wilson established The Watermill Center, \"a laboratory for performance\" on the East End of Long Island, New York. He has received more commissions for new works in Europe than in the United States since the late 20th century, regularly working with opera and theatre companies, as well as cultural festivals.\n\nWilson was born in Waco, Texas, the son of Loree Velma (née Hamilton) and D.M. Wilson, a lawyer. After attending local schools, he studied business administration at the University of Texas from 1959 to 1962. \n\nHe moved to Brooklyn, New York in 1963 in order to change fields. He received a BFA in architecture from the Pratt Institute in 1966. During this period, he also attended lectures by Sibyl Moholy-Nagy (widow of László Moholy-Nagy), and studied painting with artist George McNeil. Later he went to Arizona to study architecture with Paolo Soleri at his desert complex.\n\nAfter moving to New York, Wilson found himself drawn to the work of pioneering choreographers George Balanchine, Merce Cunningham, and Martha Graham, among others. In 1968, he founded an experimental performance company, the Byrd Hoffman School of Byrds (named for a teacher who helped him overcome a severe stutter while a teenager). With this company, he directed his first major works, beginning with 1969's \"The King of Spain\" and \"The Life and Times of Sigmund Freud\". He began to work in opera in the early 1970s, creating \"Einstein on the Beach\" with composer Philip Glass. This work brought the two artists worldwide renown. Following \"Einstein\", Wilson worked increasingly with major European theaters and opera houses. For the New York debut of his first opera, the Metropolitan Opera allowed Wilson to rent the house on a Sunday, when they did not have a production, but would not produce the work. The house sold out in two days.\n\nIn 1972, Wilson's \"Deafman Glance\", a long, silent play, was premiered at the Nancy Festival in France. It later opened in Paris, championed by the designer Pierre Cardin. The Surrealist poet Louis Aragon loved it and published a letter to the Surrealist poet André Breton (who had died in 1966), in which he praised Wilson as: \"What we, from whom Surrealism was born, dreamed would come after us and go beyond us\".\n\nIn 1983/84, Wilson planned a performance for the 1984 Summer Olympics, \"the CIVIL warS: A Tree Is Best Measured When It Is Down\"; the complete work was to have been 12 hours long, in 6 parts. The production was only partially completed; the full event was cancelled by the Olympic Arts Festival, due to insufficient funds. In 1986, the Pulitzer Prize jury unanimously selected \"the CIVIL warS\" for the drama prize, but the supervisory board rejected the choice and gave no drama award that year.\n\nIn 1990 alone, Wilson created four new productions in four different West German cities: Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" in Frankfurt, Chekhov's \"Swan Song\" in Munich, an adaptation of Virginia Woolf's \"Orlando\" in West Berlin, and \"The Black Rider,\" a collaboration by Wilson, Tom Waits and William S. Burroughs, in Hamburg.\n\nWilson is known for pushing the boundaries of theatre. His works are noted for their austere style, very slow movement, and often extreme scale in space or in time. \"The Life and Times of Joseph Stalin\" was a 12-hour performance, while \"KA MOUNTain and GUARDenia Terrace\" was staged on a mountaintop in Iran and lasted seven days.\n\nIn 2010 Wilson was working on a new stage musical with composer (and long-time collaborator) Tom Waits and the Irish playwright, Martin McDonagh. His theatrical production of \"Lecture on Nothing\", which was commissioned for a celebration of the John Cage centenary at the 2012 Ruhrtriennale, had its U.S. premiere in Royce Hall, UCLA, by the Center for the Art of Performance.\n\nIn 2013 Wilson, in collaboration with Mikhail Baryshnikov and co-starring Willem Dafoe, developed \"The Old Woman\", an adaptation of the work by the Russian author Daniil Kharms. The play premiered at MIF13, Manchester International Festival. Wilson wrote that he and Baryshnikov had discussed creating a play together for years, perhaps based on a Russian text. The final production included dance, light, singing and bilingual monologue.\n\nSince 1999, Wilson has premiered nine theatrical works in Berlin. By contrast, as of 2013, his last commission in the United States was 21 years ago. \n\nHe continues to direct revivals of his most celebrated productions, including \"The Black Rider\" in London, San Francisco, Sydney, Australia, and Los Angeles; \"The Temptation of St. Anthony\" in New York and Barcelona; \"Erwartung\" in Berlin; \"Madama Butterfly\" at the Bolshoi Opera in Moscow; and Wagner's \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" at Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris. He also directs all Monteverdi operas for the opera houses of La Scala in Milan and the Palais Garnier in Paris.\n\nIn addition to his work for the stage, Wilson creates sculpture, drawings, and furniture designs. He won the Golden Lion at the 1993 Venice Biennale for a sculptural installation. Exhibited in December 1976 at the Paula Cooper Gallery, Wilson's storyboards were described by one critic as \"serial art, equivalent to the slow-motion tempo of [Wilson's] theatrical style. In drawing after drawing after drawing, a detail is proposed, analyzed, refined, redefined, moved through various positions.\"\n\nIn 2004, Ali Hossaini offered Wilson a residency at the television channel LAB HD. Since then Wilson, with producer Esther Gordon (and among others Brad Pitt, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Robert Downey, Jr., Winona Ryder, Juliette Binoche, Isabelle Huppert, Dita von Teese, and Peter Sarsgaard) and later with Matthew Shattuck, has produced dozens of high-definition videos known as the Voom Portraits. Collaborators on this well-received project included the composer Michael Galasso, the late artist and designer Eugene Tsai, fashion designer Kevin Santos, and lighting designer Urs Schönebaum. In addition to celebrity subjects, sitters have included royalty, animals, Nobel Prize winners and hobos.\n\nAmerican pop singer Lady Gaga announced in 2013 that she would collaborate with Wilson as part of her ARTPOP project. He subsequently designed the set for her 2013 MTV Video Music Awards performance.\n\nWilson also suggested that Gaga pose for his Voom Portraits. Knowing he had an upcoming residency as guest curator at the Louvre, Wilson chose themes from the museum's collection, all dealing with death. They shot the videos in a London studio over three days, Gaga standing for 14 or 15 hours at a time. Called \"Living Rooms,\" the resulting exhibition included two video works: one inspired by Jacques-Louis David's \"The Death of Marat\", hung in the painting galleries, and another in which Lady Gaga brings to life a painting by Ingres. In the Louvre's auditorium, Wilson hosted and took part in a series of performances, conversations, film screenings, and discussions. The centerpiece of the residency is a room filled with objects from the artist's personal collection in New York, including African masks, a Shaker chair, ancient Chinese ceramics, shoes worn by Marlene Dietrich and a photo of Wilson and Glass taken in the early 1980s by Robert Mapplethorpe.\n\nIn 2011, Wilson designed an art park dedicated to the Finnish designer Tapio Wirkkala (1915–1985), situated in the Arabianranta district of Helsinki. His plans for the rectangular park feature a central square divided into nine equally sized fields separated by bushes. Each field will be installed with objects related to the home. For example, one unit will consist of a small fireplace surrounded by stones that serve as seating. The park will be lit by large, lightbox-style lamps build into the ground and by smaller ones modelled on ordinary floor lamps.\n\nLanguage is one of the most important elements of theatre and Robert Wilson feels at home with commanding it in many different ways. Wilson's impact on this part of theatre alone is immense. Arthur Holmberg, Professor of Theatre at Brandeis University, says that \"In theatre, no one has dramatized the crisis of language with as much ferocious genius as Robert Wilson\". Wilson makes it evident in his work that what's and why's of language are terribly important and cannot be overlooked. Tom Waits, acclaimed songwriter and collaborator with Wilson, said this about Wilson's unique relationship with words:\n\nWords for Bob are like tacks on the kitchen floor in the dark of night and you're barefoot. So Bob clears a path he can walk through words without getting hurt. Bob changes the values and shapes of words. In some sense they take on more meaning; in some cases, less.\n\nWilson shows the importance of language through all of his works and in many varying fashions. He credits his reading of the work of Gertrude Stein and listening to recordings of her speaking with \"changing [his] way of thinking forever.\" Wilson directed three of Stein's works in the 1990s: \"Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights\" (1992), \"Four Saints in Three Acts\" (1996), and \"Saints and Singing\" (1998).\n\nWilson considers language and, down to its very ingredients, words, as a sort of \"a social artifact\". Not only does language change with time but it changes with person, with culture. Using his experience of working with mentally handicapped children and enlisting the collaboration of Christopher Knowles, a renowned autistic poet, has allowed Wilson attack language from many views. Wilson embraces this by often \"juxtaposing levels of diction – Miltonic opulence and contemporary ling, crib poetry and pre-verbal screams\" in an attempt to show his audience how elusive language really is and how ever-changing it can be. Visually showing words is another method Wilson uses to show the beauty of language. Often his set designs, program covers, and posters are graffiti'd with words. This allows the audience to look at the \"language itself\" rather than \"the objects and meanings it refers to.\".\n\nThe lack of language becomes essential to Wilson's work as well. In the same way an artist uses positive and negative space, Wilson uses noise and silence. In working on a production of \"King Lear\", Wilson inadvertently describes his necessity of silence:\n\nThe way actors are trained here is wrong. All they think about is interpreting a text. They worry about how to speak words and know nothing about their bodies. You see that by the way they walk. They don't understand the weight of a gesture in space. A good actor can command an audience by moving one finger.\n\nThis emphasis on silence is fully explored in some of his works. \"Deafman Glance\" is a play without words, and his adaptation of Heiner Müller's play \"\" contained a fifteen-minute wordless prologue. Holmberg describes these works stating, \n\nLanguage does many things and does them well. But we tend to shut our eyes to what language does not do well. Despite the arrogance of words – they rule traditional theatre with an iron fist – not all experience can be translated into a linguistic code.\n\nCelebrated twentieth century playwright Eugène Ionesco said that Wilson \"surpassed Beckett\" because \"[Wilson's] silence is a silence that speaks\". This silence onstage may be unnerving to audience members but serves a purpose of showing how important language is by its absence. It is Wilson's means of answering his own question: \"Why is it no one looks? Why is it no one knows how to look? Why does no one see anything on stage?\".\n\nAnother technique Wilson uses is that of what words can mean to a particular character. His piece, \"I was sitting on my patio this guy appeared I thought I was hallucinating\", features only two characters, both of whom deliver the same stream-of-consciousness monologue. In the play's first production one character was \"aloof, cold, [and] precise\" while the other \"brought screwball comedy… warmth and color… playful[ness]\". The different emphases and deliveries brought to the monologue two different meanings; \"audiences found it hard to believe they heard the same monologue twice\". Rather than tell his audience what words are supposed to mean, he opens them up for interpretation, presenting the idea that \"meanings are not tethered to words like horses to hitching posts\".\n\nMovement is another key element in Wilson's work. As a dancer, he sees the importance of the way an actor moves onstage and knows the weight their movement bears. When speaking of his \"play without words\" rendition of Ibsen's \"When We Dead Awaken\", Wilson says:\n\nI do movement before we work on the text. Later we'll put text and movement together. I do movement first to make sure it's strong enough to stand on its own two feet without words. The movement must have a rhythm and structure of its own. It must not follow the text. It can reinforce a text without illustrating it. What you hear and what you see are two different layers. When you put them together, you create another texture.\n\nWith such an emphasis on movement, Wilson even tailors his auditions around the necessity of it. In his auditions, \"Wilson often does an elaborate movement sequence\" and \"asks the actor to repeat it\". Thomas Derrah, an actor in \"the CIVIL warS\", found the audition process to be baffling: \"When I went in, [Wilson] asked me to walk across the room on a count of 31, sit down on a count of 7, put my hand to my forehead on a count of 59. I was mystified by the whole process\". To further cement the importance of movement in Wilson's works, Seth Goldstein, another actor in \"the CIVIL warS\", stated \"every movement from the moment I walked onto the platform until I left was choreographed to the second. During the scene at table all I did was count movements. All I thought about was timing\".\n\nWhen it comes time to add the text in with movement, there is still much work to be done. Wilson pays close attention to the text and still makes sure there is enough \"space around a text\" in order for the audience to soak it up. At this point, the actors know their movements and the time in which they are executed, allowing Wilson to tack the actions onto specific pieces of text. His overall goal is to have the rhythm of the text differ from that of the movement so his audience can see them as two completely different pieces, seeing each as what it is. When in the text/movement stage, Wilson often interrupts the rehearsal, saying things like \"Something is wrong. We have to check your scripts to see if you put the numbers in the right place\". He goes on to explain the importance of this:\n\nI know it's hell to separate text and movement and maintain two different rhythms. It takes time to train yourself to keep tongue and body working against each other. But things happen with the body that have nothing to do with what we say. It's more interesting if the mind and the body are in two different places, occupying different zones of reality.\n\nThese rhythms keep the mind on its toes, consciously and subconsciously taking in the meanings behind the movement and how it is matching up with the language.\n\nSimilar to Wilson's use of the lack of language in his works, he also sees the importance that a lack of movement can have. In his production of \"Medea\", Wilson arranged a scene in which the lead singer stood still during her entire song while many others moved around her. Wilson recalls that \"she complained that if I didn't give her any movements, no one would notice her. I told her if she knew how to stand, everyone would watch her. I told her to stand like a marble statue of a goddess who had been standing in the same spot for a thousand years\". Allowing an actor to have such stage presence without ever saying a word is very provocative, which is precisely what Wilson means to accomplish with any sense of movement he puts on the stage.\n\nWilson believes that, \"The most important part of theatre\" is light. He is concerned with how images are defined onstage, and this is related to the light of an object or tableau. He feels that the lighting design can really bring the production to life. The set designer for Wilson's \"\", Tom Kamm, describes his philosophy: \"a set for Wilson is a canvas for the light to hit like paint\". He explains, \"If you know how to light, you can make shit look like gold. I paint, I build, I compose with light. Light is a magic wand\".\n\nWilson is \"the only major director to get billing as a lighting designer\" and is recognized by some as \"the greatest light artist of our time\". He designs with light to be flowing rather than an off-and-on pattern, thus making his lighting \"like a musical score\". Wilson's lighting designs feature \"dense, palpable textures\" and allow \"people and objects to leap out from the background\". In his design for \"Quartett\", Wilson used four hundred light cues in a span of only ninety minutes.\n\nHe is a perfectionist, persisting to achieve every aspect of his vision. A fifteen-minute monologue in \"Quartett\" took two days for him to light while a single hand gesture took nearly three hours. This attention to detail expresses his conviction that, \"light is the most important actor on stage\".\n\nWilson's interest in design extends to the props in his productions, which he designs and sometimes participates in constructing. Whether it is furniture, a light bulb, or a giant crocodile, Wilson treats each as a work of art in its own right. He demands that a full-scale model of each prop be constructed before the final one is made, in order \"to check proportion, balance, and visual relationships\" on stage. Once he has approved the model, the crew builds the prop, and Wilson is \"renowned for sending them back again and again and again until they satisfy him\". He is so strict in his attention to detail that when Jeff Muscovin, his tech director for \"Quartett\", suggested they use an aluminum chair with a wood skin rather than a completely wooden chair, Wilson replied:\n\nNo, Jeff, I want wood chairs. If we make them out of aluminum, they won't sound right when they fall over and hit the floor. They'll sound like metal, not wood. It will sound false. Just make sure you get strong wood. And no knots.\n\nSuch attention to detail and perfectionism usually resulted in an expensive collection of props. \"Curators regard them as sculptures\", and the props have been sold for prices ranging from \"$4,500 to $80,000\".\n\nWilson is gay.\n\nIn 2007, Wilson was evicted from the Vestry Street loft he had lived and worked in for 34 years by developer Aby Rosen. That same year, he signed a lease at 111 Front Street.\n\nIn 2011, New York-based company International Flavors & Fragrances created a new scent, titled Black Rider, in Wilson's honor on the occasion of the director's 70th birthday.\n\nExtensive retrospectives have been presented at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris (1991) and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (1991). He has presented installations at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, Museum Boymans-van Beuningen, Rotterdam (1993), London's Clink Street Vaults (1995), Neue Nationalgalerie (2003), and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York and the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. His tribute to Isamu Noguchi was exhibited at the Seattle Art Museum and his \"Voom Portraits\" exhibition traveled to Hamburg, Milan, Miami, and Philadelphia. In 2012, Times Square Arts invited Wilson to show selections from his three-minute video portraits on more than twenty digital screens that lined Times Square. In 2013 he participated at the White House Biennial / Thessaloniki Biennale 4.\n\nWilson is represented exclusively and worldwide by RW Work, Ltd. (New York), and his gallerist in New York City is Paula Cooper Gallery.\n\nIn 1991 Wilson established The Watermill Center on the site of a former Western Union laboratory on the East End of Long Island, New York. Originally styled as \"a laboratory for performance\", The Watermill Center now operates year-round artist residencies, public education programs, exhibitions, and performances. The Center is situated within a 10-acre campus of gardens and designed landscape, and contains numerous works of art collected by Wilson.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Rogers developed a technically highly proficient ventriloquism act with her ventriloquist figure Shorty Harris, first of all appearing as a supporting act in music hall in the 1950s. Like her contemporary fellow ventriloquist Bobbie Kimber, she began life as a man but underwent gender reassignment surgery on the National Health Service in the early 1960s. This brought her some short-lived notoriety but did not hamper her career. Rogers won acclaim for her appearance in the 1968 review \"Boys Will be Girls\" at the Theatre Royal Stratford East and went on to become a highly regarded performer on the UK cabaret circuit. She was the only variety act ever to appear at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club. From 1974 onwards she was a regular, though somewhat incongruous, guest on TV on \"The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club\". She also appeared on BBC TV's long running Music Hall variety show, The Good Old Days. Her cabaret career eventually extended internationally including appearances at Las Vegas and The Magic Castle in Hollywood, and on United States TV.\n\nHer work as a magician was always something of a sideline but she was an ingenious developer of magic tricks including illusions for David Copperfield and Paul Daniels.

It was released on May 31, 1999 as the lead single from their album \"Hooray for Boobies\", which was released a year later, in the US and UK. The song was remixed by many artists including God Lives Underwater, KMFDM, and Eiffel 65.\n\nThe song's video features the band dressed in \"MonkeyRat\" costumes with oversized ears, in numerous locations of Paris (including the Place de l'Estrapade, Avenue de Saxe, and Champ de Mars), and the Eiffel Tower is visible in many shots. During the video, the band uses blowguns to shoot tranquilizer darts into the buttocks of four passing young women dressed in black with short skirts and stockings, then carrying them away. They then use a fishing rod to dangle a croissant in front of a group of French chefs, enticing them to follow. The band members dance around for a few seconds and then lure three chefs into following them. The band members swallow several mealworms, before finding two stereotypically French effeminate gay men in a café, who are then beaten over the head with baguettes and knocked unconscious. A dwarf mime artist played by actor Jordan Prentice is captured in a net and then thrown into a cage with the four women, three chefs and the gay couple in a clear parody of animal collectors capturing frightened specimens.

{"id": "3174307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3174307", "title": "The Three Princes of Serendip", "text": "The Three Princes of Serendip\n\nThe Three Princes of Serendip is the English version of the story \"Peregrinaggio di tre giovani figliuoli del re di Serendippo\" published by Michele Tramezzino in Venice in 1557. Tramezzino claimed to have heard the story from one , who had translated the Persian fairy tale into Italian, adapting Book One of Amir Khusrau's \"Hasht-Bihisht\" of 1302. The story first came to English via a French translation, and now exists in several out-of-print translations.\n\"Serendip\" is the Old Persian name for Sri Lanka (Ceylon).\n\nThe story has become known in the English-speaking world as the source of the word serendipity, coined by Horace Walpole because of his recollection of the part of the \"silly fairy tale\" in which the three princes by \"accidents and sagacity\" discern the nature of a lost camel. In a separate line of descent, the story was used by Voltaire in his 1747 \"Zadig\", and through this contributed to both the evolution of detective fiction and the self-understanding of scientific method.\n\n\"In ancient times there existed in the country of Serendippo, in the Far East, a great and powerful king by the name of Giaffer. He had three sons who were very dear to him. And being a good father and very concerned about their education, he decided that he had to leave them endowed not only with great power, but also with all kinds of virtues of which princes are particularly in need.\"\n\nThe father searches out the best possible tutors. \"And to them he entrusted the training of his sons, with the understanding that the best they could do for him was to teach them in such a way that they could be immediately recognized as his very own.\"\n\nWhen the tutors are pleased with the excellent progress that the three princes make in the arts and sciences, they report it to the king. He, however, still doubts their training, and summoning each in turn, declares that he will retire to the contemplative life leaving them as king. Each politely declines, affirming the father's superior wisdom and fitness to rule.\n\nThe king is pleased, but fearing that his sons' education may have been too sheltered and privileged, feigns anger at them for refusing the throne and sends them away from the land.\n\nNo sooner do the three princes arrive abroad than they trace clues to identify precisely a camel they have never seen. They conclude that the camel is lame, blind in one eye, missing a tooth, carrying a pregnant woman, and bearing honey on one side and butter on the other. When they later encounter the merchant who has lost the camel, they report their observations to him. He accuses them of stealing the camel and takes them to the Emperor Beramo, where he demands punishment.\n\nBeramo then asks how they are able to give such an accurate description of the camel if they have never seen it. It is clear from the princes' replies that they have used small clues to infer cleverly the nature of the camel.\n\nGrass had been eaten from the side of the road where it was less green, so the princes had inferred that the camel was blind on the other side. Because there were lumps of chewed grass on the road that were the size of a camel’s tooth, they inferred they had fallen through the gap left by a missing tooth. The tracks showed the prints of only three feet, the fourth being dragged, indicating that the animal was lame. That butter was carried on one side of the camel and honey on the other was evident because ants had been attracted to melted butter on one side of the road and flies to spilled honey on the other.\n\nAs for the woman, one of the princes said: \"I guessed that the camel must have carried a woman, because I had noticed that near the tracks where the animal had knelt down the imprint of a foot was visible. Because some urine was nearby, I wet my fingers and as a reaction to its odour I felt a sort of carnal concupiscence, which convinced me that the imprint was of a woman’s foot.\"\n\n\"I guessed that the same woman must have been pregnant,\" said another prince, \"because I had noticed nearby handprints which were indicative that the woman, being pregnant, had helped herself up with her hands while urinating.\"\n\nAt this moment, a traveller enters the scene to say that he has just found a missing camel wandering in the desert. Beramo spares the lives of the three princes, lavishes rich rewards on them, and appoints them to be his advisors.\n\nThe three princes have many other adventures, where they continue to display their sagacity, stories-within-stories are told, and, of course, there is a happy ending.\n\nThe fairy tale \"The Three Princes of Serendip\" is based upon the life of Persian King Bahram V, who ruled the Sassanid Empire (420–440). Stories of his rule are told in epic poetry of the region (Firdausi's \"Shahnameh\" of 1010, Nizami's \"Haft Paykar\" of 1197, Khusrau's Hasht Bihisht of 1302), parts of which are based upon historical facts with embellishments derived from folklore going back hundreds of years to oral traditions in India and \"The Book of One Thousand and One Nights\". With the exception of the well-known camel story, English translations are very hard to come by.\n\nA version of the fable of a camel blind in one eye is included in the Talmud, attributed to Rabbi Yochanan. While it might be seen as implying that gentiles, in comparison to Jews, are rude and defecate on the road, it is worth noting that Jewish law has strong injunctions of modesty and cleanliness, including strict injunctions against open or public urination or defecation.\n\nIn chapter three of Voltaire's 1747 novel Zadig, there is an adaptation of \"The Three Princes of Serendip\", this time involving, instead of a camel, a horse and a dog, which the eponymous Zadig is able to describe in great detail from his observations of the tracks on the ground. When he is accused of theft and taken before the judges, Zadig clears himself by recounting the mental process which allows him to describe the two animals he has never seen: \"I saw on the sand the tracks of an animal, and I easily judged that they were those of a little dog. Long, shallow furrows imprinted on little rises in the sand between the tracks of the paws informed me that it was a bitch whose dugs were hanging down, and that therefore she had had puppies a few days before.\"\n\nZadig's detective work was influential. Cuvier wrote, in 1834, in the context of the new science of paleontology:\n\nT. H. Huxley, the proponent of Darwin’s theories of evolution, also found Zadig's approach instructive, and wrote in his 1880 article \"The method of Zadig\":\nEdgar Allan Poe in his turn was probably inspired by Zadig when he created C. Auguste Dupin in \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\", calling it a \"tale of ratiocination\" wherein \"the extent of information obtained lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the quality of the observation.\"\nPoe's M. Dupin stories mark the start of the modern detective fiction genre. Émile Gaboriau, and Arthur Conan Doyle were perhaps also influenced by Zadig.\n\n"}
{"id": "4398469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4398469", "title": "The Trevor Project", "text": "The Trevor Project\n\nThe Trevor Project is an American non-profit organization founded in 1998 focused on suicide prevention efforts among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth. Through a toll-free telephone number, it operates The Trevor Lifeline, a confidential service that offers trained counselors. The stated goals of the project are to provide crisis intervention and suicide prevention services for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) young people ages 13–24, as well as to offer guidance and resources to parents and educators in order to foster safe, accepting, and inclusive environments for all youth, at home and at school.\n\nThe project was founded in 1998 in West Hollywood, California, by James Lecesne, Peggy Rajski, and Randy Stone. They are the creators of the 1994 Academy Award-winning short film \"Trevor\", a dramedy about Trevor, a gay thirteen-year-old boy who, when rejected by friends because of his sexuality, makes an attempt to take his life. When the film was scheduled to air on HBO television in 1998, the filmmakers realized that some of the program's young viewers might be facing the same kind of crisis as Trevor, and began to search for a support line to be broadcast during the airing. They discovered that no such helpline existed, and decided to dedicate themselves to forming what was, in their view, a much-needed resource: an organization to promote acceptance of LGBTQ youth, and to aid in crisis and suicide prevention among that group.\n\nThe Trevor Lifeline was established with seed funds provided by The Colin Higgins Foundation and HBO's license fee. As a result, it became the first nationwide, around-the-clock crisis and suicide prevention helpline for LGBTQ youth. The project also provides online support to young people through the project's website, as well as guidance and resources to educators and parents.\n\nIn November 2009, the project was contracted by the Tulare County Suicide Prevention Task Force, located in Tulare County, California. With this agreement, the project received public funds for the first time. In June 2009, seven Tulare County volunteers completed The Trevor Project Lifeguard Workshop Facilitator training. Lifeguard workshops have been done in schools in Tulare County municipalities, including Dinuba, Lindsay, Porterville and Visalia, as well as in Hanford in adjacent Kings County.\n\nThe Trevor Project has been supported by various celebrities, including Ellen DeGeneres, Troye Sivan, Kathy Griffin, Shay Mitchell, Daniel Radcliffe, Neil Patrick Harris, James Marsden, Chris Colfer, Kim Kardashian, Darren Criss, Dianna Agron, George Takei, Anderson Cooper, John Oliver and Tyler Oakley.\n\nThe Trevor Lifeline is the only nationwide, around-the-clock crisis and suicide prevention helpline for LGBTQ youth in the United States. The lifeline is a free and confidential service from trained counselors trained to listen without judging, and can refer callers to supportive local organizations and groups; this information is also available on the project's website.\n\nOn August 10, 2009, the project announced that it received a major cash donation to support the lifeline from actor Daniel Radcliffe, star of the \"Harry Potter\" film series. Radcliffe said in a statement:\n\n\"Ask Trevor\" is an online non-time-sensitive question-and-answer resource for young people with questions surrounding sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nTrevorChat is a free, confidential, live and secure online messaging service provided by The Trevor Project with hours of 12 pm to 7 pm Pacific time.\n\nTrevorSpace is an online social networking community for LGBTQ+ youth ages 13 through 24, along with their friends and allies. Youth can create personal profiles, which are verified by the administrators before they are allowed to interact with other profiles, and connect with other young people internationally, as well as find resources within their communities. TrevorSpace is commonly used to receive or give advice and make friends who have shared similar experiences as the user. TrevorSpace is carefully monitored by administrators designated by the project to ensure all content is age-appropriate, youth-friendly and factual. Members over the age of 18 cannot privately message members under the age of 18. TrevorSpace links members to The Trevor Project's home page, where information about The Trevor Lifeline, \"Dear Trevor,\" and other resources is available. The software used to create TrevorSpace was donated to the project by Tim Gill, an American software entrepreneur and philanthropist.\n\nThrough the Palette Fund Internship Program, the project provides for five internships in both its Los Angeles and New York City offices. Interns are placed among the program, communication, and development departments. The program provides an opportunity for young people to learn about working in the non-profit sector. Palette Fund internships are specifically designed to introduce young leaders to the LGBTQ movement.\n\nThe Youth Advisory Council serves as a liaison between youth nationwide and the project on issues surrounding suicide, sexuality and gender identity. The council submits recommendations to the project in an effort to increase project visibility and best serve the LGBTQ youth population.\n\nThe project's Lifeguard Workshop Program uses a structured, age-appropriate curriculum to address topics around sexuality, gender identity, the impacts of language and behavior, and what it means for young people to feel different. The program also teaches young people to recognize depression and suicide amongst their peers, the impacts of language and behavior on LGBTQ youth, and suicide prevention skills in schools.\n\nOn February 10, 2014, YouTube personality Tyler Oakley started a fundraiser to collect $150,000 for the Trevor Project. Oakley set the deadline for the money to be collected by the time of his birthday, March 22, but the goal was reached after only six days. Oakley later extended the fundraiser and more than $462,000 had been raised as of March 29. On March 31, the fundraiser ended, with a total of $525,754 raised.\n\nThe Trevor Project uses annual events to honor individuals and businesses that have been leaders in supporting LGBT rights and advocated against bullying and hate crimes. In 1998, it held the first Cracked Xmas fundraiser in Los Angeles. In 2001, a New York City-based annual event was added, using entertainers to raise financial resources for the organization. As of 2009, Cracked Xmas was the group's largest annual fundraiser.\n\n\nThe Trevor Life Award honors a person who is an inspiration to LGBTQ youth. Recipients include:\n\nThe Trevor Hope Award is presented to businesses that have demonstrated support for the LGBTQ community and \"has increased the visibility and understanding of LGBT issues.\" It was first presented in 2004. Recipients include:\n\nAwarded to businesses that support LGBT rights, started in 2007.\n\nAwarded to LGBTQ or straight people under the age of 25 who work to support, inspire, and empower LGBTQ youth. Recipients include:\n\n"}
{"id": "8248661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8248661", "title": "Video gaming in Germany", "text": "Video gaming in Germany\n\nGermany has the largest video games market in Europe with 44.3 million gamers in 2018, outpacing the United Kingdom.\n\nThe annual Gamescom in Cologne is the world's largest gaming expo by number of attendees.\n\nGerman production of popular video-games began principally on the 16-bit systems such as the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST in the 1980s, although a number of successful titles were also released on the Commodore 64 which dominated the 8-bit computer market in the country at the time. One of the earliest internationally successful companies was Gütersloh-based Rainbow Arts (founded in 1984) who were, among others, responsible for publishing the popular \"Turrican\" series of games. Other popular developers of the 16-bit era included Thalion, Factor 5 (who were responsible for developing the entire \"Turrican\" series) and Blue Byte. Blue Byte and Factor 5 remain in existence in 2006 and produce titles for systems such as Windows PCs and seventh generation.\n\nBy 2002, German games were heavily tilted toward construction and management simulations, according \"Der Spiegel\"s Frank Patalong. He noted that \"nowhere else in the world are simulations as successful as here at home. Titles such as \"The Settlers\", \"Die Völker\" or \"Anno 1602\" have dominated the German sales charts for years\". Released in 1998, \"Anno 1602\" by Sunflowers Interactive was Germany's best-selling computer game of all time as of December 2002, with sales of 2.5 million copies worldwide and 1.7 million in the German market. Its sequel, \"Anno 1503\", broke several of its sales records, becoming Germany's fastest-selling game and fastest full-price computer game to reach 500,000 domestic sales. It ultimately sold over one million units in German-speaking countries, and, when combined with its predecesor, reached 4.5 million sales worldwide by October 2006. The titles began the \"Anno\" series.\n\nOne of the most famed titles to come out of Germany in recent years is \"Far Cry\" by Frankfurt-based Crytek, who also produced \"Crysis\". Factor 5 had been concentrating on the \"\" series of gaming from 1999 until 2003, and released \"Lair\", an action game for the PlayStation 3, in 2007.\n\nAscaron produced the \"Elite\" homage \"Darkstar One\" and continued to produce the popular \"Anstoss\" (lit. \"Kick off\") football series of games, the first two installations of which were released under the title \"On the Ball\" in English-speaking countries.\n\n\nWithin Germany there is a popular taste for historical trade simulations that exceeds that of many other countries, including home-grown ones such as \"1602 A.D.\" and its sequels and \"The Patrician (video game)\".\n\nVehicle simulator games are also very popular in Germany.\n\nFirst-person shooters have also been traditionally quite popular in recent years, which has become a controversial debate. There has been much discussion about the violent content of first-person shooter games, and as such these games, especially uncut versions, are highly coveted in gaming circles.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2008 the main video gaming trade fair in Germany was the Games Convention which was held annually in Leipzig, and was highly recognized by the press. Since 2009 it was discontinued, as the Gamescom in Cologne took the place of the major gaming trade fair in the world.\n\nViolence in video games is a controversial subject in Germany, and German localisations of violent games are often heavily cut by the publishers to permit a public release. Usually this entails a simple removal or reduction of depictions of blood and gore, but often extends to cuts in the content or plot of the game, as was the case in games such as \"Phantasmagoria\", \"\", \"Counter-Strike\", \"Grand Theft Auto\", or \"\".\n\nAll games that are released to the public are required to carry a certificate given by the USK (Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle - Voluntary Monitoring Organisation of Entertainment Software). If the USK refuses certification of a title, it may be, and often is, placed upon the index of media harmful to youth kept by an offshoot of the Federal Ministry of Family Affairs. The compulsory nature of the USK label was a consequence of the 2003 modification of the \"Jugendschutzgesetz,\" or youth protection laws.\n\nThe 2003 changes to the \"Jugendschutzgesetz\" also announced an intent to extend the restrictions on the depiction of violence in video gaming, leaving open the possibility of banning any depiction of violence in video gaming, which was met by widespread outcry from the video gaming community in Germany. The then in power CDU/SPD coalition government announced an intention to enact this in 2005, but in November 2006 it was announced that such restrictions would not be enacted at this time.\n"}
