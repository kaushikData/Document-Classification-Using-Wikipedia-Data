{"id": "92605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92605", "title": "12 Angry Men (1957 film)", "text": "12 Angry Men (1957 film)\n\n12 Angry Men is a 1957 American courtroom drama film adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. Written and co-produced by Rose and directed by Sidney Lumet, this trial film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the conviction or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt, forcing the jurors to question their morals and values. In the United States, a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous. The film is notable for its almost exclusive use of one set: out of 96 minutes of run time, only three minutes take place outside of the jury room.\n\n\"12 Angry Men\" explores many techniques of consensus-building and the difficulties encountered in the process among a group of men whose range of personalities adds intensity and conflict. It also explores the power one person has to elicit change. No names are used in the film; the jury members are identified by number until two members exchange names at the end. The defendant is referred to as \"the boy\" and the witnesses as \"the old man\" and \"the lady across the street\". The film forces the characters and audience to evaluate their own self-image through observing the personality, experiences, and actions of the jurors.\n\nIn 2007, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The film was selected as the second-best courtroom drama ever by the American Film Institute during their AFI's 10 Top 10 list and is the highest courtroom drama on Rotten Tomatoes' Top 100 Movies of All Time.\n\nIn a New York City courthouse a jury commences deliberating the case of an 18-year-old boy from a slum, on trial for allegedly stabbing his father to death. If there is any reasonable doubt they are to return a verdict of not guilty. If found guilty, the boy will receive a death sentence.\n\nIn a preliminary vote, all jurors vote \"guilty\" except Juror 8, who argues that the boy deserves some deliberation. This irritates some of the other jurors, who are impatient for a quick deliberation, especially Juror 7 who has tickets to the evening's Yankees game, and 10 who demonstrates blatant prejudice against people from slums. Juror 8 questions the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses, and the prosecution's claim that the murder weapon, a common switchblade (of which he possesses an identical copy), was \"rare\". Juror 8 argues that reasonable doubt exists and that he, therefore, cannot vote \"guilty\", but concedes that he has merely hung the jury.\n\nJuror 8 suggests a secret ballot, from which he will abstain, and agrees to change his vote if the others unanimously vote \"guilty\". The ballot is held and a new \"not guilty\" vote appears. An angry Juror 3 accuses Juror 5, who grew up in a slum, of changing his vote out of sympathy towards slum children. However, Juror 9 reveals it was he that changed his vote, agreeing there should be some discussion. Juror 8 argues that the noise of a passing train would have obscured the verbal threat that one witness claimed to have heard the boy tell his father \"I'm going to kill you\". Juror 5 then changes his vote. Juror 11 also changes his vote, believing the boy would not likely have tried to retrieve the murder weapon from the scene if it had been cleaned of fingerprints.\n\nJurors 5, 6 and 8 question the witness' claim to have seen the defendant fleeing 15 seconds after hearing the father's body hit the floor since he was physically incapable of reaching an appropriate vantage point in time due to a stroke. An angry Juror 3 shouts that they are losing their chance to \"burn\" the boy. Juror 8 accuses him of being a sadistic \"public avenger\", which causes Juror 3 to nearly attack Juror 8. Jurors 2 and 6 then change their votes, tying the vote at 6–6. Shortly after, a thunderstorm begins, which will cancel Juror 7's baseball game.\n\nJuror 4 doubts the boy's alibi of being at the movies, because he could not recall it in much detail. Juror 8 tests how well Juror 4 remembers previous days, which he does, with difficulty. Juror 2 questions the likelihood that the boy, who was almost a foot shorter than his father, could have inflicted the downward stab wound found in the body. Jurors 3 and 8 then conduct an experiment to see whether a shorter person could stab downwards on a taller person. The experiment proves the possibility but Juror 5 then steps up and demonstrates the correct way to hold and use a switchblade, revealing that anyone skilled with a switchblade, as the boy would be, would always stab underhanded at an upwards angle against an opponent who was taller than them, as the grip of stabbing downwards would be too awkward and the act of changing hands too time consuming.\n\nIncreasingly impatient, Juror 7 changes his vote to hasten the deliberation, which earns him the ire of other jurors (especially 11) for voting frivolously; still he insists, unconvincingly, that he actually thinks the boy is not guilty. Jurors 12 and 1 then change their votes, leaving only three dissenters: Jurors 3, 4 and 10. Juror 10 then vents a torrent of condemnation of slum-born people, claiming they are no better than animals who kill for fun. Most of the others turn their backs to him, with Juror 4 finally telling Juror 10 to be quiet. Juror 8 reminds the rest that personal prejudice can cloud judgments. When the remaining \"guilty\" voters are pressed to explain themselves, Juror 4 states that, despite all the previous evidence, the woman from across the street who saw the killing still stands as solid evidence. Juror 12 then reverts his vote, making the vote 8–4.\n\nJuror 9, seeing Juror 4 rub his nose (which is being irritated by his glasses), realizes that the woman who allegedly saw the murder had impressions in the sides of her nose, indicating that she probably wears glasses, but did not wear them in court out of vanity. Other jurors, most notably Juror 1, confirm that they saw the same thing. Juror 8 adds that she would not have been wearing them while trying to sleep, and points out that on her own evidence the attack happened so swiftly that she wouldn't have had time to put them on. Jurors 12, 10 and 4 then change their vote to \"not guilty\", leaving only Juror 3. Juror 3 gives a long and increasingly tortured string of arguments, building on earlier remarks that his relationship with his own son is deeply strained, which is ultimately why he wants the boy to be guilty. He finally loses his temper and tears up a photo of him and his son, but suddenly breaks down crying and changes his vote to \"not guilty\", making the vote unanimous. Outside, Jurors 8 and 9 finally exchange names, and all of the jurors descend the courthouse steps to return to their individual lives.\n\n\nUncredited\n\nReginald Rose's screenplay for \"12 Angry Men\" was initially produced for television (starring Robert Cummings as Juror 8), and was broadcast live on the CBS program \"Studio One\" in September 1954. A complete kinescope of that performance, which had been missing for years and was feared lost, was discovered in 2003. It was staged at Chelsea Studios in New York City.\n\nThe success of the television production resulted in a film adaptation. Sidney Lumet, whose prior directorial credits included dramas for television productions such as \"The Alcoa Hour\" and \"Studio One\", was recruited by Henry Fonda and Rose to direct. \"12 Angry Men\" was Lumet's first feature film, and the only producing credit for Fonda and Rose. Fonda later stated that he would never again produce a film.\n\nThe filming was completed after a short but rigorous rehearsal schedule, in less than three weeks, on a tight budget of $340,000 ().\n\nAt the beginning of the film, the cameras are positioned above eye level and mounted with wide-angle lenses, to give the appearance of greater depth between subjects, but as the film progresses the focal length of the lenses is gradually increased. By the end of the film, nearly everyone is shown in closeup, using telephoto lenses from a lower angle, which decreases or \"shortens\" depth of field. Lumet stated that his intention in using these techniques with cinematographer Boris Kaufman was to create a nearly palpable claustrophobia.\n\nOn its first release, \"12 Angry Men\" received critical acclaim. A. H. Weiler of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"It makes for taut, absorbing, and compelling drama that reaches far beyond the close confines of its jury room setting.\" His observation of the twelve men was that \"their dramas are powerful and provocative enough to keep a viewer spellbound.\" \"Variety\" called it an \"absorbing drama\" with acting that was \"perhaps the best seen recently in any single film,\" Philip K. Scheuer of the \"Los Angeles Times\" declared it a \"tour de force in movie making,\" \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" deemed it \"a compelling and outstandingly well handled drama,\" and John McCarten of \"The New Yorker\" called it \"a fairly substantial addition to the celluloid landscape.\"\n\nHowever, the film was a box office disappointment. The advent of color and widescreen productions may have contributed to its disappointing box office performance. It was not until its first airing on television that the movie finally found its audience.\n\nThe film is viewed as a classic, highly regarded from both a critical and popular viewpoint: Roger Ebert listed it as one of his \"Great Movies\". The American Film Institute named Juror 8, played by Henry Fonda, 28th in a list of the 50 greatest movie heroes of the 20th century. AFI also named \"12 Angry Men\" the 42nd most inspiring film, the 88th most heart-pounding film and the 87th best film of the past hundred years. The film was also nominated for the 100 movies list in 1998. , the film holds a 100% approval rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes. In 2011, the film was the second most screened film in secondary schools in the United Kingdom.\n\nAmerican Film Institute lists:\n\nThe film was nominated for Academy Awards in the categories of Best Director, Best Picture, and Best Writing of Adapted Screenplay. It lost to \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" in all three categories. At the 7th Berlin International Film Festival, the film won the Golden Bear Award.\n\nSpeaking at a screening of the film during the 2010 Fordham University Law School Film festival, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor stated that seeing \"12 Angry Men\" while she was in college influenced her decision to pursue a career in law. She was particularly inspired by immigrant Juror 11's monologue on his reverence for the American justice system. She also told the audience of law students that, as a lower-court judge, she would sometimes instruct juries to not follow the film's example, because most of the jurors' conclusions are based on speculation, not fact. Sotomayor noted that events such as Juror 8 entering a similar knife into the proceeding; performing outside research into the case matter in the first place; and ultimately the jury as a whole making broad, wide-ranging assumptions far beyond the scope of reasonable doubt (such as the inferences regarding the woman wearing glasses) would not be allowed in a real life jury situation, and would in fact have yielded a mistrial (assuming, of course, that applicable law permitted the content of jury deliberations to be revealed).\n\nThe movie has had a number of adaptations. A 1963 German TV production (\"Die Zwölf Geschworenen\") was directed by Günter Gräwert, while a 1991 homage by Kōki Mitani, \"Juninin no Yasashii Nihonjin\" (\"12 gentle Japanese\"), posits a Japan with a jury system and features a group of Japanese people grappling with their responsibility in the face of Japanese cultural norms. The 1987 Indian film \"Ek Ruka Hua Faisla\" (\"a pending decision\") is a remake of the film, with an almost identical storyline. Russian director Nikita Mikhalkov also made a 2007 adaptation, \"12\". A 2015 Chinese adaptation, \"12 Citizens\", follows the plot of the original 1957 American movie, while including characters reflecting contemporary Beijing society, including a cab driver, guard, businessman, policeman, a retiree persecuted in a 1950s' political movement, and others. The detective drama television show \"Veronica Mars\", which like the film includes the theme of class issues, featured an episode, \"One Angry Veronica\", in which the title character is selected for jury duty. The episode flips the film's format and depicts one holdout convincing the jury to \"convict\" the privileged defendants of assault against a less well-off victim, despite their lawyers initially convincing 11 jury members of a not guilty verdict.\n\nIn 1997, a television remake of the film under the same title was directed by William Friedkin and produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. In the newer version, the judge is a woman and four of the jurors are Black, but the overall plot remains intact. Modernizations include not smoking in the jury room, changes in references to pop culture figures and income, references to execution by lethal injection as opposed to the electric chair, more race-related dialogue and profanity.\n\nThe film has also been subject to parody. In 2015, the Comedy Central TV series \"Inside Amy Schumer\" aired a half-hour parody of the film titled \"12 Angry Men Inside Amy Schumer\". BBC Radio comedy \"Hancock's Half Hour\", starring Tony Hancock and Sid James, and written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, broadcast a half-hour parody on October 16, 1959, also known as \"Twelve Angry Men\". \"The Flintstones\" story \"Disorder in the Court\" and \"The Simpsons\" story \"The Boy Who Knew Too Much\" similarly feature the respective patriarchs of both families playing holdout jurors. \"Family Guy\" paid tribute to the film with its Season 11 episode titled \"12 and a Half Angry Men\", and \"King of The Hill\" acknowledged the film with their parody \"Nine Pretty Darn Angry Men\" in season 3. Sitcom \"Happy Days\" also features a similar story in the season 5 episode \"Fonzie for the Defense\", when Howard Cunningham and Fonzie are picked for a jury, and Fonzie is the lone hold-out for innocence, swaying the rest of the jury. \"Saturday Night Live\" parodied the film in 1984 in a sketch called First Draft Theater. The American TV situation comedy, \"The Odd Couple\", starring Jack Klugman (juror 5 in the movie), satirizes the film in \"The Jury Story\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18436536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18436536", "title": "2012 (film)", "text": "2012 (film)\n\n2012 is a 2009 American epic science fiction disaster film directed by Roland Emmerich and starring John Cusack, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Amanda Peet, Oliver Platt, Thandie Newton, Danny Glover and Woody Harrelson. The film was produced by Centropolis Entertainment and distributed by Columbia Pictures.\n\nFilming, originally planned for Los Angeles, began in Vancouver in August 2008. The plot follows novelist Jackson Curtis as he attempts to bring his family to safety amid a worldwide geological disaster. The film refers to Mayanism and the 2012 phenomenon in its portrayal of cataclysmic events.\n\nAfter a lengthy advertising campaign which included the creation of a website from its main character's point of view and a viral marketing website on which filmgoers could register for a lottery number to save them from the ensuing disaster, \"2012\" was released internationally on November 13, 2009. Critics gave the film mixed reviews, praising its special effects and dark tone relative to Emmerich's other work and criticizing its screenplay and length. It was a commercial success and one of 2009's highest-grossing films.\n\nIn 2009, American geologist Adrian Helmsley visits astrophysicist Satnam Tsurutani in India and learns that neutrinos from a huge solar flare are heating Earth's core. Helmsley presents his information to White House Chief of Staff Carl Anheuser, who brings him to meet the president.\n\nThe following year, U.S. President Thomas Wilson and other world leaders begin a secret project to ensure the survival of humanity. China and the G8 nations begin building nine arks, each capable of carrying 100,000 people, in the Himalayas near Cho Ming, Tibet. Nima, a Buddhist monk, is evacuated and his brother Tenzin joins the ark project. Funding is raised by selling tickets at €1 billion per person. By 2011, articles of value are moved to the arks with the help of art expert and First Daughter Laura Wilson.\n\nIn 2012, struggling Los Angeles science-fiction writer Jackson Curtis is a chauffeur for Russian billionaire Yuri Karpov. Jackson's former wife Kate and their children Noah and Lilly live with Kate's boyfriend, plastic surgeon and pilot Gordon Silberman. Jackson takes Noah and Lilly camping in Yellowstone National Park. When they find an area fenced off by the Army, Jackson and his children climb over the fence. They are caught and brought to Adrian, who has read Jackson's books. After they are released they meet conspiracy theorist Charlie Frost, who hosts a radio show from the park.\n\nThat night, after the military evacuates Yellowstone, Jackson watches Charlie's video of Charles Hapgood's theory that polar shifts and the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar predict a 2012 phenomenon and the end of the world as we know it. According to Charlie, anyone who attempted to inform the public was killed. Soon after Jackson and his children return home, earthquakes begin in California; Jackson heeds Charlie's warning, and rents a private plane. He rescues his family as the Earth-crust displacement begins, causing a 10.9 magnitude earthquake, and Jackson and his family escape from Los Angeles by air as the city collapses and sinks into the Pacific Ocean, killing millions of residents. \n\nThey fly to Yellowstone to retrieve a map from Charlie with the arks' location. As they leave, the Yellowstone Caldera erupts; Charlie is killed when he stays behind to cover the eruption. The group lands in Las Vegas to find a larger plane and meet Yuri, his twin sons Alec and Oleg, his girlfriend Tamara and their pilot Sasha. Sasha and Gordon fly them out in an Antonov An-500 as the Yellowstone ash cloud envelops Las Vegas. An attempted refueling stop in Hawaii is abandoned after seeing the islands consumed by flows of lava as a result of the erupting volcanos.\n\nAdrian, Carl, and Laura fly to the arks on Air Force One. Knowing that his daughter will survive, President Wilson remains in Washington, D.C. to address the nation for the last time while millions of people die in earthquakes and megatsunamis worldwide, including himself. With the presidential line of succession gone, Carl assumes the position of acting commander-in-chief.\n\nWhen Jackson's group reaches China, their plane runs out of fuel. Sasha continues flying the plane as the others escape on a Bentley Continental Flying Spur stored in the cargo hold. Sasha is killed when the plane crashes, and the others are spotted by Chinese Air Force helicopters. Yuri and his sons (who have tickets) are brought to the arks and the Curtis family, Tamara and Gordon are left behind as Sasha and Tamara were having an affair. The remaining group is picked up by Nima and brought to the arks with his grandparents. With Tenzin's help, they stow away on Ark 4, where the U.S. contingent is located. As a megatsunami breaches the Himalayas and approaches the site, an impact driver lodges in the ark-door gears. This keeps a boarding gate open, which prevents the ship's engines from starting. In the ensuing chaos, Yuri, Tamara, and Gordon are killed. Tenzin is injured, the ark begins filling with water and is set adrift. Jackson and Noah dislodge the tool and the crew regains control of the Ark before it strikes Mount Everest. Jackson is reunited with his family and reconciles with Kate.\n\nTwenty-seven days later, the waters are receding. The arks approach the Cape of Good Hope, where the Drakensberg (now the tallest mountain range on Earth) is emerging. Adrian and Laura begin a relationship, and Jackson and Kate rekindle their romance.\n\nAn alternate ending appears in the film's DVD version. After Captain Michaels (the Ark 4 captain) announces that they are heading for the Cape of Good Hope, Adrian learns by phone that his father (Harry) is still alive. Harry tells him that he, Tony (whose arm is in a sling) and some passengers and crew survived the megatsunami which struck the Genesis, and Captain Michaels says that they should soon see the ocean liner. Kate thanks Laura for taking care of Lily, and Laura tells Jackson that she enjoyed his book. Jackson returns Noah's cell phone, which he recovered during the Ark 4 flood. Lily says that she sees an island, and the ark finds the shipwrecked Genesis and her survivors on a beach.\n\nGraham Hancock's \"Fingerprints of the Gods\" was listed in \"2012\" credits as the film's inspiration, and Emmerich said in a \"Time Out\" interview: \"I always wanted to do a biblical flood movie, but I never felt I had the hook. I first read about the Earth's Crust Displacement Theory in Graham Hancock's \"Fingerprints of the Gods\".\" He and composer-producer Harald Kloser worked closely together, co-writing a spec script (also entitled \"2012\") which was marketed to studios in February 2008. A number of studios heard a budget projection and story plans from Emmerich and his representatives, a process repeated by the director after \"Independence Day\" (1996) and \"The Day After Tomorrow\" (2004).\n\nLater that month, Sony Pictures Entertainment received the rights to the spec script. Planned for distribution by Columbia Pictures, \"2012\" cost less than its budget; according to Emmerich, the film was produced for about $200 million.\n\nFilming, originally scheduled to begin in Los Angeles in July 2008, began in Kamloops, Savona, Cache Creek and Ashcroft, British Columbia. With a Screen Actors Guild strike looming, the film's producers made a contingency plan to salvage it. Uncharted Territory, Digital Domain, Double Negative, Scanline, and Sony Pictures Imageworks were hired to create \"2012\" computer-animated visual effects.\n\nThe film depicts the destruction of several cultural and historical icons around the world. Emmerich said that the Kaaba was considered for selection, but Kloser was concerned about a possible fatwā against him.\n\n\"2012\" was marketed by the fictional Institute for Human Continuity, featuring a book by Jackson Curtis (\"Farewell Atlantis\"), streaming media, blog updates and radio broadcasts from zealot Charlie Frost on his website, \"This Is The End\". On November 12, 2008, the studio released the first trailer for \"2012\". With a tsunami surging over the Himalayas and a purportedly-scientific message that the world would end in 2012, the trailer's message was that international governments were not preparing their populations for the event. The trailer ended with a suggestion to viewers to \"find out the truth\" by entering \"2012\" on a search engine. \"The Guardian\" called the film's marketing \"deeply flawed\", associating it with \"websites that make even more spurious claims about 2012\".\n\nThe studio introduced a viral marketing website operated by the Institute for Human Continuity, where filmgoers could register for a lottery number to be part of a small population which would be rescued from the global destruction. David Morrison of NASA, who received over 1,000 inquiries from people who thought the website was genuine, condemned it. \"I've even had cases of teenagers writing to me saying they are contemplating suicide because they don't want to see the world end\", Morrison said. \"I think when you lie on the internet and scare children to make a buck, that is ethically wrong.\" Another marketing website promoted \"Farewell Atlantis\", the fictional novel about the events of 2012.\n\nComcast organized a \"roadblock campaign\" to promote the film in which a two-minute scene was broadcast on 450 American commercial television networks, local English-language and Spanish-language stations, and 89 cable outlets during a ten-minute window between 10:50 and 11:00 pm Eastern and Pacific Time on October 1, 2009. The scene featured the destruction of Los Angeles and ended with a cliffhanger, with the entire 5:38 clip available on Comcast's Fancast website. According to \"Variety\", \"The stunt will put the footage in front of 90% of all households watching ad-supported TV, or nearly 110 million viewers. When combined with online and mobile streams, that could increase to more than 140 million\".\n\nThe film's score was composed by Harald Kloser and Thomas Wander. Singer Adam Lambert contributed a song to the film, \"Time for Miracles\", and expressed his gratitude in an MTV interview. The 24-song soundtrack includes \"Fades Like a Photograph\" by Filter and \"It Ain't the End of the World\" by George Segal and Blu Mankuma. The trailer track was \"Master of Shadows\" by Two Steps From Hell.\n\"2012\" was released to cinemas on November 13, 2009 in Sweden, Canada, Denmark, Mexico, India, the United States, and Japan. According to the studio, the film could have been completed for a summer release but the delay allowed more time for production.\n\nThe DVD and Blu-ray versions were released on March 2, 2010. The two-disc Blu-ray edition includes over 90 minutes of features, including Adam Lambert's music video for \"Time for Miracles\" and a digital copy for PSP, PC, Mac, and iPod. A 3D version was released in Cinemex theaters in Mexico in February 2010.\n\n\"2012\" grossed $166.1 million in North America and $603.6 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $769.7 million against a production budget of $200 million, making it the first film to gross over $700 million worldwide without crossing $200 million domestically. Worldwide, it was the fifth-highest-grossing 2009 film and the fifth-highest-grossing film distributed by Sony-Columbia, (behind Sam Raimi's \"Spider-Man\" trilogy and \"Skyfall\"). \"2012\" is the second-highest-grossing film directed by Roland Emmerich, behind \"Independence Day\" (1996). It earned $230.5 million on its worldwide opening weekend, the fourth-largest opening of 2009 and for Sony-Columbia.\n\n\"2012\" ranked number one on its opening weekend, grossing $65,237,614 on its first weekend (the fourth-largest opening for a disaster film). Outside North America it is the 28th-highest-grossing film, the fourth-highest-grossing 2009 film, and the second-highest-grossing film distributed by Sony-Columbia, after \"Skyfall\". \"2012\" earned $165.2 million on its opening weekend, the 20th-largest overseas opening. Its largest opening was in France and the Maghreb ($18.0 million). In total earnings, the film's three highest-grossing territories after North America were China ($68.7 million), France and the Maghreb ($44.0 million), and Japan ($42.6 million).\n\n\"2012\" received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 40% based on 240 reviews with an average rating of 5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Roland Emmerich's \"2012\" provides plenty of visual thrills, but lacks a strong enough script to support its massive scope and inflated length.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score 49 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nRoger Ebert praised \"2012\", giving it stars out of 4 and saying that it \"delivers what it promises, and since no sentient being will buy a ticket expecting anything else, it will be, for its audiences, one of the most satisfactory films of the year\". Ebert and Claudia Puig of \"USA Today\" called the film the \"mother of all disaster movies\". But Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" compared it to \"\": \"Beware \"2012\", which works the dubious miracle of almost matching \"Transformers 2\" for sheer, cynical, mind-numbing, time-wasting, money-draining, soul-sucking stupidity.\"\n\nNorth Korea reportedly banned the possession or viewing of \"2012\". The year was the 100th anniversary of the birth of the nation's founder, Kim Il-sung, and was designated as \"the year for opening the grand gates to becoming a rising superpower\"; a film depicting the year negatively was deemed offensive by the North Korean government. Several people in North Korea were reportedly arrested for possessing (or viewing) imported copies of \"2012\" and charged with \"grave provocation against the development of the state\".\n\nIn 2010 \"Entertainment Weekly\" reported a planned spin-off television series, \"2013\", which would have been a sequel to the film. \"2012\" executive producer Mark Gordon told the magazine, \"ABC will have an opening in their disaster-related programming after \"Lost\" ends, so people would be interested in this topic on a weekly basis. There's hope for the world despite the magnitude of the 2012 disaster as seen in the film. After the movie, there are some people who survive, and the question is how will these survivors build a new world and what will it look like. That might make an interesting TV series.\" However, plans were later canceled for budgetary reasons. It would have been Emmerich's third film to spawn a spin-off; the first was \"Stargate\" (followed by \"Stargate SG-1\", \"Stargate Infinity\", \"Stargate Atlantis\", \"Stargate Universe\"), and the second was \"Godzilla\" (followed by the animated \"\").\n\n"}

It was originally published in Germany by Queen Games in a language-interdependent version; an English-specific version was released in North America by the now-defunct Überplay. The game is an Arabian-themed update, set during the construction of the Alhambra palace in 14th century Granada, of the 1998 stock trading board game \"Stimmt So!\", which in turn was an update of the 1992 mafia influence board game \"Al Capone\"; the original version was subsequently released as \"\".\n\n\"Alhambra\" won the Spiel des Jahres award, the Schweizer Spielepreis for Family Games, the As d'Or and the Essen Feather for the year of its release and placed second in the Deutscher Spiele Preis. Its success has led to the release of numerous expansion packs and spin-off games, and is becoming Queen Games' flagship franchise.\n\nThe game consists of a deck of \"currency cards\" of various values in four currencies (suits) and a bag of \"building tiles\" of various prices, as well as a number of boards (a currency market, a building market, a reserve board for each player and a scoring track). Six of the building tiles are \"Alhambra tiles\"; these are taken out of the bag and one is given to each player. Each player is then dealt currency cards until the total value of cards in their hand is greater than or equal to twenty. The currency cards are shuffled into five piles, and the two special scoring cards are inserted into the second and fourth piles. The five piles are then placed in order to form the currency deck. Four currency cards are drawn and placed on the currency market, and four building tiles are drawn and placed on the four spaces of the building market. The set of tiles connected to a player's Alhambra tile is called their \"Alhambra.\"\n\nPlayers then take turns, during which they may perform one of the following actions:\nCurrency cards and Building tiles are then added to any spaces on the Currency market or the Building market.\n\nSome tiles have walls along one or more edges. When players add tiles to their Alhambra, it must be possible to trace a path from the new tile to the fountain that was their start tile, remaining within tiles and without crossing any walls. It is also not permitted to create \"holes\" such that all four sides of a gap are closed in.\n\nWhen the scoring cards are drawn from the Currency deck, or when there are fewer than four buildings remaining to be sold, scoring occurs. Each player scores one point for each wall segment in their longest wall. The player with the most of a given building card type scores points according to that type; in case of a tie, points are split between players. More common building types are worth more points, and building types are worth more points in later scoring rounds. In the final scoring round, the player with the most of a given currency type takes the tile of that currency type and may add it to their Alhambra before scoring.\n\nDue to the original game's popularity, there are, as of 2013, six expansion packs, termed \"extensions,\" to \"Alhambra\", each of which adds four \"modules\" to the game. These modules may be played together or separately and modules may be combined from different expansions. The extensions are designed by both Dirk Henn and Wolfgang Panning and are named for one of its modules. These are, in order of release:\n\nThe promo expansion/module \"The Magic Buildings\" adds 6 magic building tiles to the game. When drawn, these tiles can be placed to score extra points depending on their surrounding tiles.\nThe promo expansion/module \"The Medina Buildings\" adds 9 Medina building tiles to the game. During the scoring rounds, they award \"negative\" points to the player with the fewest of these tiles in his/her Alhambra.\n\nThe success of \"Alhambra\" has also led Henn to release or re-release some other games under the \"Alhambra\" name and Moorish theme:\n\nA video game version was being developed by Vivendi Games for the Xbox 360 console system via Xbox Live Arcade, but has been indefinitely postponed.\n\n"}
{"id": "3958324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3958324", "title": "Archetypal literary criticism", "text": "Archetypal literary criticism\n\nArchetypal literary criticism is a type of critical theory that interprets a text by focusing on recurring myths and archetypes (from the Greek \"archē\", \"beginning\", and \"typos\", \"imprint\") in the narrative, symbols, images, and character types in literary work. As a form of literary criticism, it dates back to 1934 when Maud Bodkin published \"Archetypal Patterns in Poetry\".\n\nArchetypal literary criticism's origins are rooted in two other academic disciplines, social anthropology and psychoanalysis; each contributed to literary criticism in separate ways, with the latter being a sub-branch of critical theory. Archetypal criticism was at its most popular in the 1940s and 1950s, largely due to the work of Canadian literary critic Northrop Frye. Though archetypal literary criticism is no longer widely practiced, nor have there been any major developments in the field, it still has a place in the tradition of literary studies.\n\nThe anthropological origins of archetypal criticism can pre-date its analytical psychology origins by over 30 years. \"The Golden Bough\" (1890–1915), written by the Scottish anthropologist Sir James George Frazer, was the first influential text dealing with cultural mythologies. Frazer was part of a group of comparative anthropologists working out of Cambridge University who worked extensively on the topic. \"The Golden Bough\" was widely accepted as the seminal text on myth that spawned numerous studies on the same subject. Eventually, the momentum of Frazer's work carried over into literary studies.\n\nIn \"The Golden Bough\" Frazer identifies practices and mythological beliefs shared among primitive religions and modern religions. Frazer argues that the death-rebirth myth is present in almost all cultural mythologies, and is acted out in terms of growing seasons and vegetation. The myth is symbolized by the death (i.e., final harvest) and rebirth (i.e., spring) of the god of vegetation. As an example, Frazer cites the Greek myth of Persephone, who was taken to the Underworld by Hades. Her mother Demeter, the goddess of the harvest, was so sad that she struck the world with fall and winter. While in the underworld Persephone ate six of the twelve pomegranate seeds given to her by Hades; consequently, she was forced to spend half the year, from then on, in the Underworld, representative of autumn and winter, or the death in the death-rebirth myth. The other half of the year Persephone was permitted to be with Demeter in the mortal realm, which represents spring and summer, or the rebirth in the death-rebirth myth.\n\nWhile Frazer's work deals with mythology and archetypes in material terms, the work of Carl Gustav Jung, the Swiss-born founder of analytical psychology, is, in contrast, immaterial in its focus. Jung's work theorizes about myths and archetypes in relation to the unconscious, an inaccessible part of the mind. From a Jungian perspective, myths are the \"culturally elaborated representations of the contents of the deepest recess of the human psyche: the world of the archetypes\" (Walker 4).\n\nJungian analytical psychology distinguishes between the personal and collective unconscious, the latter being particularly relevant to archetypal criticism. The collective unconscious, or the objective psyche as it is less frequently known, is a number of innate thoughts, feelings, instincts, and memories that reside in the unconsciousness of all people. Jung's definition of the term is inconsistent in his many writings. At one time he calls the collective unconscious the \"a priori, inborn forms of intuition\" (Lietch 998), while in another instance it is a series of \"experience(s) that come upon us like fate\" (998). Regardless of the many nuances between Jung's definitions, the collective unconsciousness is a shared part of the unconscious.\n\nTo Jung, an archetype in the collective unconscious, as quoted from Leitch et al., is \"irrepresentable, but has effects which make visualizations of it possible, namely, the archetypal images and ideas\" (988), due to the fact they are at an inaccessible part of the mind. The archetypes to which Jung refers are represented through primordial images, a term he coined. Primordial images originate from the initial stages of humanity and have been part of the collective unconscious ever since. It is through primordial images that universal archetypes are experienced, and more importantly, that the unconscious is revealed.\n\nWith the same death-rebirth myth that Frazer sees as being representative of the growing seasons and agriculture as a point of comparison, a Jungian analysis envisions the death-rebirth archetype as a \"symbolic expression of a process taking place not in the world but in the mind. That process is the return of the ego to the unconscious—a kind of temporary death of the ego—and its re-emergence, or rebirth, from the unconscious\" (Segal 4).\n\nBy itself, Jung's theory of the collective unconscious accounts for a considerable share of writings in archetypal literary criticism; it also pre-dates the height of archetypal literary criticism by over a decade. The Jungian archetypal approach treats literary texts as an avenue in which primordial images are represented. It would not be until the 1950s when the other branch of archetypal literary criticism developed.\n\nBodkin's \"Archetypal Patterns in Poetry\", the first work on the subject of archetypal literary criticism, applies Jung's theories about the collective unconscious, archetypes, and primordial images to literature. It was not until the work of the Canadian literary critic Northrop Frye that archetypal criticism was theorized in purely literary terms. The major work of Frye's to deal with archetypes is \"Anatomy of Criticism\"\nbut his essay \"The Archetypes of Literature\" is a precursor to the book. Frye's thesis in \"The Archetypes of Literature\" remains largely unchanged in \"Anatomy of Criticism\". Frye's work helped displace New Criticism as the major mode of analyzing literary texts, before giving way to structuralism and semiotics.\n\nFrye's work breaks from both Frazer and Jung in such a way that it is distinct from its anthropological and psychoanalytical precursors. For Frye, the death-rebirth myth, that Frazer sees manifest in agriculture and the harvest, is not ritualistic since it is involuntary, and therefore, must be done. As for Jung, Frye was uninterested about the collective unconscious on the grounds of feeling it was unnecessary: since the unconscious is unknowable it cannot be studied. How archetypes came to be was also of no concern to Frye; rather, the function and effect of archetypes is his interest. For Frye, literary archetypes \"play an essential role in refashioning the material universe into an alternative verbal universe that is humanly intelligible and viable, because it is adapted to essential human needs and concerns\" (Abrams 224-225).\n\nThere are two basic categories in Frye's framework, comedic and tragic. Each category is further subdivided into two categories: comedy and romance for the comedic; tragedy and satire (or ironic) for the tragic. Though he is dismissive of Frazer, Frye uses the seasons in his archetypal schema. Each season is aligned with a literary genre: comedy with spring, romance with summer, tragedy with autumn, and satire with winter.\n\nComedy is aligned with spring because the genre of comedy is characterized by the birth of the hero, revival and resurrection. Also, spring symbolizes the defeat of winter and darkness. Romance and summer are paired together because summer is the culmination of life in the seasonal calendar, and the romance genre culminates with some sort of triumph, usually a marriage. Autumn is the dying stage of the seasonal calendar, which parallels the tragedy genre because it is, above all, known for the \"fall\" or demise of the protagonist. Satire is metonymized with winter on the grounds that satire is a \"dark\" genre; satire is a disillusioned and mocking form of the three other genres. It is noted for its darkness, dissolution, the return of chaos, and the defeat of the heroic figure.\n\nSummer – Romance. The birth of the hero.\nAutumn – Tragedy. Movement towards the death or defeat of the hero.\nWinter – Irony/Satire. The hero is absent. \nSpring – Comedy. The rebirth of the hero.\n\nThe context of a genre determines how a symbol or image is to be interpreted. Frye outlines five different spheres in his schema: human, animal, vegetation, mineral, and water. The comedic human world is representative of wish-fulfillment and being community centred. In contrast, the tragic human world is of isolation, tyranny, and the fallen hero. Animals in the comedic genres are docile and pastoral (e.g. sheep), while animals are predatory and hunters in the tragic (e.g. wolves). For the realm of vegetation, the comedic is, again, pastoral but also represented by gardens, parks, roses and lotuses. As for the tragic, vegetation is of a wild forest, or as being barren. Cities, a temple, or precious stones represent the comedic mineral realm. The tragic mineral realm is noted for being a desert, ruins, or \"of sinister geometrical images\" (Frye 1456). Lastly, the water realm is represented by rivers in the comedic. With the tragic, the seas, and especially floods, signify the water sphere.\n\nFrye admits that his schema in \"The Archetypes of Literature\" is simplistic, but makes room for exceptions by noting that there are neutral archetypes. The example he cites are islands such as Circe's or Prospero's which cannot be categorized under the tragic or comedic.\n\nMaud Bodkin wrote \"Archetypal Patterns in Poetry\" in 1934, applying the ideas of Jung to poetry, and examining archetypes such as the ancient mariner and rebirth, heaven and hell, images of the devil, the hero and God. \nBodkin book.\n\nIn his 1949 book \"Hero with a Thousand Faces\", Joseph Campbell pioneered the idea of the ‘monomyth' (though the term was borrowed from James Joyce), a universal pattern in heroic tales across different cultures and genres. His deep examination of the eight step hero's journey (and the common variations that exist) had a huge impact on the Abstract Expressionists of the 1950s, and continues to inspire creative artists today.\n\nIt has been argued that Frye's version of archetypal criticism strictly categorizes works based on their genres, which determines how an archetype is to be interpreted in a text. According to this argument the dilemma Frye's archetypal criticism faces with more contemporary literature, and that of post-modernism in general, is that genres and categories are no longer distinctly separate and that the very concept of genres has become blurred, thus problematizing Frye's schema. For instance Beckett's \"Waiting For Godot\" is considered a tragicomedy, a play with elements of tragedy and satire, with the implication that interpreting textual elements in the play becomes difficult as the two opposing seasons and conventions that Frye associated with genres are pitted against each other. But in fact arguments about generic blends such as tragicomedy go back to the Renaissance, and Frye always conceived of genres as fluid. Frye thought literary forms were part of a great circle and were capable of shading into other generic forms. (He contemplated including a diagram of his wheel in \"Anatomy of Criticism\" but thought better of it.)Myth and archetype deals with origin of literary.\n\n\nArchetypal symbols vary more than archetype narratives or character types. The best archetypal pattern is any symbol with deep roots in a culture's mythology, such as the forbidden fruit in Genesis or even the poison apple in Snow White. These are examples of symbols that resonate with archetypal critics.\n\nArchetypes reveal shared roles among universal societies. This archetype may create a shared imaginary which is defined by many stereotypes that have not separated themselves from the traditional, biological, religious and mythical framework.\n\n\n"}

The series premiered on the Vervegirl (rebranded as KindaTV as of January 2016) YouTube channel on August 19, 2014. U by Kotex is the executive producer of the web series. The series takes place at the fictional Silas University in Styria, Austria and is told through vlogs recorded by Laura, a first-year student. When Laura begins investigating the disappearance of her roommate, she is assigned a new roommate named Carmilla.\n\nThe first and second seasons each consist of 36 three to seven-minute episodes. A twelve-episode prequel mini-season, \"season zero,\" was announced just after the release of the final episode of season 2. On February 13, 2016, it was announced that \"Carmilla\" would air its third and final season in the summer of 2016. The third season was eventually released in September and October 2016, in three acts. On October 6, 2016, it was announced that there would be a movie (not sponsored by U by Kotex) that would take place five years after the end of the third season. The film, called \"The Carmilla Movie\", was released in 2017.\n\nIn 2016, the series won a Canadian Screen Award and a Rockie Award for Branded Content at the Banff World Media Festival. As of August 2017, \"Carmilla\" had generated over 70 million views on YouTube.\n\nThe series is told through a fictional vlog broadcast by Laura Hollis (Bauman), a freshman studying journalism who has decided to document her college experience. When her roommate Betty (Glowicki) suddenly goes missing at a swim team party, Laura is assigned a new roommate, Carmilla Karnstein (Negovanlis), whom Laura describes as \"broody.\"\n\nLaura, aided by her friends, discovers that her former roommate is not the only girl to have abruptly gone missing from Silas. The season follows Laura's investigation and her relationship with Carmilla, which progresses from hostile to romantic over the course of the season.\n\nBetween the first and second seasons, series story editor Ellen Simpson published additional story content. Canon Twitter accounts under Laura, Carmilla, and LaFontaine's names relay the group's encounters with supernatural Styrian dangers while trying to escape the Silas campus.\n\nBetween stories on the Twitter accounts, a Christmas special was released detailing the group's not-so-pleasant encounter with a seemingly-pleasant Mama Klaus.\n\nThe second season begins with Laura, Carmilla, LaFontaine, and Perry's return to the Silas campus. Laura decides to investigate the murder of several members of the newspaper staff.

The first class of students were accepted less on the quality of their drawing and more on their critical thinking skills, literary merit, storytelling abilities and curiosity.\n\nThe Center's first commencement took place on May 19, 2007, with roughly 20 students graduating. In 2007 CCS was approved by the State of Vermont to award Master of Fine Arts degrees and certificates, which have been awarded to students from all subsequent classes. It currently has a student body of 48 students with an average age of 24. About 20 new students are accepted each year.\n\nThe school educates students to be proficient in all aspects of graphic design and production, including self-publication and promotion. This is a notable step away from the specialized production model of mainstream comics companies such as Marvel Comics and DC Comics, wherein writing, pencilwork, inking, coloring, and lettering are most often handled by separate individuals. This inclination is in part due to many of the faculty's and significant donor Peter Laird's experience with alternative comics. The State of Vermont Department of Education approved CCS for degree granting authority and the school is also a member of Vermont Higher Education Council.\n\nThe Center for Cartoon Studies currently operates out of two buildings in the historic district of White River Junction, Vermont. The school rents space in the former Colodny’s Surprise Department Store Building, and in December 2011 the school purchased a former Post Office a few buildings down from Department Store Building. The schools Schulz Library used to be housed in a former fire station on Bridge Street, a building also occupied by the Main Street Museum, but had to be evacuated in August 2011 due to flood waters from Hurricane Irene.\n\nAll the main operational and educational facilities of the Center for Cartoon Studies are located in the former Colodny’s Surprise Department Store Building. Built in 1929, the building is the only Art Deco building in downtown White River Junction, and is built partially with Antique Verde marble quarried from Rochester, Vermont. CCS inhabits the first floor and basement of the building and includes multiple offices, a classroom, and an \"open basement studio.\" \n\nThe Former Post office Building in downtown White River Junction was purchased by the school in December 2011. The brick building is constructed in a colonial revival architectural style and was built in 1934 as a Works Progress Administration structure. This building will become the main structure for the Center for Cartoon Studies and includes classrooms, faculty offices and lounges, and the Schulz Library. The top floor of the Post Office Building is still rented to the current tenants. It also includes studio space for the Inky Solomon Center, a grant-program geared towards CCS alumni, their comics and community outreach.\n\nThe Schulz Library, named after Charles M. Schulz is the official library of the Center for Cartoon Studies and currently houses over 9,000 titles in one room. The Library is currently in storage, but was previously housed in the former Bridge Street firehouse, owned by the Main Street Museum. The material in the library had to be evacuated in August 2011 due to flood waters from Hurricane Irene. The Library's collection focuses on comic books, graphic novels, as well as \"books about cartooning – both academic and instructional.\" The Schulz's collection has grown largely from donations from collectors and publishers, as well as artists. By the fall semester of 2012 the Schulz library will be moved to the Post Office Building the CCS purchased in 2011.\n\nSpecial collections located at the Library include collections of gag cartoons, classic newspaper comic strips, Zines and mini-comics, and a large collection of rare and hard to find Peanuts books, as well as \"a near-complete run of The Comics Journal.\" Many hard-to-find titles and previews of student work are featured on the Schulz Library Blog.\n\nThe Center For Cartoon Studies offers a Master of Fine Arts degree, both one and two-year certificate programs, as well as summer programs.\n\nEach term, roughly 14 well known cartoon artists and others in the field come to CCS as visiting faculty and guest lecturers. The visiting faculty lecture, critique, and discuss with students of the school the student work and their own. Past visiting faculty have included Alison Bechdel, Ed Brubaker, Ivan Brunetti, James Kochalka, Jason Lutes, Scott McCloud, Seth, Art Spiegelman, Craig Thompson, and Chris Ware.\n\nA senior Thesis is required at the Center, which usually involves the creation of a full scale graphic novel or a full year's worth of work.\n\nIn addition to Sturm, Stephen R. Bissette, Jason Lutes and Alec Longstreth are permanent faculty. For the 2011-2012 school year, carnoonist and animator Robert Sikoryak joined the faculty.\n\nStudents and alumni from the Center for Cartoon Studies have received Ignatz Awards, Eisner Award nominations and Xeric Foundation grants for their work. One alumni, who launched their drag career while attending the school, has won \"RuPaul's Drag Race\".\n\n\nCCS is the subject of a documentary film, \"Cartoon College,\" by Josh Melrod and Tara Wray. The film follows a group of CCS students from the 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 classes and includes interviews with notable faculty and luminaries. It has been screened at film festivals in California, Vancouver (Canada), Washington, Florida, Glasgow, Maryland and of course, White River Junction. Future shows include New York City, Atlanta and New Zealand.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10294603", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10294603", "title": "Coupon-eligible converter box", "text": "Coupon-eligible converter box\n\nA coupon-eligible converter box (CECB) was a digital television adapter that met eligibility specifications for subsidy \"coupons\" from the United States government. The subsidy program was enacted to provide over-the-air television viewers with an affordable way to continue receiving free digital over-the-air television services after the nation's television service transitioned to digital transmission and analog transmissions ceased. The specification was developed by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), with input from the broadcast and consumer electronics industries as well as public interest groups.\n\nIn March 2005, United States House Commerce Committee chairman Joe Barton of Texas said he would introduce a bill requiring the transition to digital television \"sometime in the spring\", saying he wanted analog broadcasting to end on December 31, 2006. Included in his plan was a $400–$500 million subsidy for converter boxes, which were expected to cost $50 each. The subsidies were intended only for people who could not afford a pay service such as cable or satellite television. Each home would receive a rebate coupon for one box, which could be mailed to the United States Treasury for redemption. Barton estimated that 8 to 10 million converters would be needed.\n\nThe United States Digital Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005, part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, required that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) direct all full-power television stations to cease analog TV broadcasting before midnight on February 17, 2009. (This deadline later changed to June 12.) Recognizing that consumers might wish to continue receiving broadcast programming over-the-air using analog-only televisions, the Act authorized the NTIA to create a digital-to-analog converter box assistance program. Consumer education plans for the subsidy program were targeted to low-income, elderly, disabled, inner city, immigrant, and rural Americans, because these groups were more likely to use an antenna instead of cable or satellite television. The Act also established a new Treasury fund, known as the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund. It directed the FCC to deposit the receipts from the spectrum auction of the returned analog television frequencies into the fund.\n\nThe Act directed the NTIA to implement and administer a program through which eligible US households could obtain a maximum of two \"coupons\" (actually payment vouchers) of $40 each, to be applied towards the purchase of a digital-to-analog converter box. The Act defines the term \"converter box\" to mean \"a stand-alone device that does not contain features or functions except those necessary to enable a consumer to convert any channel broadcast in the digital television service into a format that the consumer can display on television receivers designed to receive and display signals only in the analog television service, but may also include a remote control device.\" The Act, however, did not define \"eligible household\".\n\nAs of April 2006, 20 million people (some with more than one set) received only over-the-air TV. When the number of people subscribing to cable or satellite who also had TVs that only used an antenna, an estimated 70 million TVs would need upgrading.\n\nIn 2006, the NTIA let people see its plan for distributing coupons and comment on it. The plan prohibited people with cable or satellite service from requesting coupons. In order to get two coupons, consumers had to state that they had two television sets. In an effort to limit misconduct, coupon requests would be only be taken between January 1, 2008 and March 31, 2009; each coupon would be valid for three months. The consumer-education program only had a budget of $5 million, so the companies participating in the transition would have to help.\n\nOn March 12, 2007, the NTIA held a news conference to announce the standards for the converter boxes and the requirements for receiving coupons. With the standards established, manufacturing could begin and the NTIA could select a company to send out coupons.\n\nWith $1.5 billion in funding, the coupons would account for only half of the 73 million analog TVs not using a pay service, including 18 million in homes having only over-the-air TV reception. The Commerce Department had no plans to make coupons available only to the poor.\n\nCoupons could be requested by phone, mail, or online. At first, anyone would be able to apply, even for those who had one or more TVs connected to cable or satellite.\n\nThe NTIA set the standards for the converter box based on what manufacturers and broadcasters wanted. LG Electronics, Thomson, Samsung, and Jasco were the first companies to announce plans to make the devices. After June 1, 2007, retailers could apply to sell converter boxes. Each would have to be in the NTIA's Central Contractor Registration database, and have been in the consumer-electronics business for at least a year.\nTo implement the coupon program, the Act authorized NTIA to use up to $990 million from the fund, including $100 million for program administration. Those funds supported an initial \"non-contingent\" program that was available to all requesting households. NTIA was also authorized to spend up to $1.5 billion for the program (including $160 million for administration) if the initial $990 million were insufficient to fulfill the non-contingent coupon requests. In that case, a \"contingent\" fund would be available for US households not serviced by cable or satellite. If the funds were insufficient, the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate would be notified.\n\nAn initial funding of $990 million was expected to allow all US households an opportunity to apply for the coupons, which expired 90 days after they were mailed. After that money was used up, $510 million in additional funds was available to households that stated they did not already subscribe to cable or satellite television services. Neither allotment had a means test.\n\nThe NTIA planned to start processing coupon requests a year before the original transition date of February 17, 2009; 2.4 million people had applied for 4.7 million coupons, out of an estimated 13 million homes that still received television with an antenna.\n\nBy the end of 2008, the \"New York Times\" said \"about 40 million coupons have been requested, but to date 16 million have been redeemed, compared with an estimated 35 million televisions that will lose a signal.\" Institutions, such as retirement homes, were initially excluded from the program; while this was partially remedied (to allow one coupon per retirement-home resident), prisons, homeless shelters and residential hotels remained disqualified from the coupon program.\n\nOn January 4, 2009, the NTIA began placing coupon requests on a waiting list after the program reached its maximum allowed funding. Only after unredeemed coupons expire could new requests be fulfilled. By January 7, NTIA's waiting list included just under a million requested coupons. A week later, the list had grown to two million coupons.\n\nOn January 7, both Consumers Union and Representative Ed Markey of Massachusetts (who headed the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee’s telecom subcommittee) advocated that the February 17, 2009 analog shutoff date be postponed, due to the lack of coupons and NTIA's inability to handle the expected public enquiries. On January 8, President-Elect Barack Obama's transition team contacted key legislators to express support for a delay, largely because of problems funding coupons for converters. The delay passed early in February (see below).\n\nThe NTIA Specification is arranged in three categories, describing required, permitted, and disqualifying features.\n\nThese features were absolutely required, but varied in the way they are provided by the box.\n\nCoupon-eligible converter boxes had to convert all ATSC (digital) formats to the traditional NTSC analog system used by analog US television sets. The box must output signals both as a radio frequency output (compatible with a television's antenna input), as well as composite video and stereo audio outputs. It must include a remote control, and be compatible with universal remotes.\n\nThe units had to support both a center crop of a transmitted image, and a letterbox rendition of a transmitted image. The video outputs had to produce video at an ITU-R BT.500-11 quality scale of Grade 4 or higher. Various technical performance parameters for the digital tuner were also specified.\n\nThe boxes must decode Emergency Alert System (EAS) messages, Closed Captioning data, and Parental Control (V-Chip) descriptors. They must decode the Program and System Information Protocol (PSIP) data from the digital transmission, and use it to provide the user with tuned channel and program information.\n\nCECBs must consume no more than an average of 2 watts of power when not in use (no video or audio display). They must provide an automatic power-down option that can put the unit in standby mode when it has not received any commands for a while.\n\nManufacturers could self-certify compliance with these requirements, but had to provide test results and two units to the NTIA for \"ad hoc\" testing. The FCC could also test converter boxes at the NTIA's request. Among the optional features permitted, but not required, were the following:\n\n\nWhile an outdoor antenna is required for adequate digital reception in most locations beyond from TV transmitters, and smart antenna interfaces were an optionally permitted feature of coupon-eligible converter boxes, there were no subsidies for antennas. Although manufacturers could sell a converter/smart-antenna bundle, they were required to also offer the converter by itself to consumers.\n\nDTV converter boxes could earn a United States Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star label if they consume no more than eight watts of electricity while operating, no more than one watt while in standby mode, and if they automatically power-down after four hours of inactivity.\n\nSome features disqualified a converter box from coupon eligibility, such as high-definition video output and built-in DVR functionality. Digital cable and satellite set-top boxes that incorporate a digital tuner were also disqualified.\n\nCertain output features were prohibited from coupon-eligible devices: component video, VGA, RGB, DVI, HDMI, USB video, IEEE-1394/iLink/Firewire video, Ethernet video, and IEEE-802.11/WiFi video outputs.\n\nCoupon-eligible converter boxes only tune to one channel at a time, as they only contain one digital tuner and no analog tuner. In order to watch one channel while recording another, one must have two such converter boxes, unless the recording device has its own digital TV tuner.\n\nMost video recorders were also unable to change channels under control of built-in timers when using a converter, as channel selection was then handled by the converter. Some converter boxes have a programmable timer, which the user could program to match the recording schedule of their VCR. Then, the converter's tuner will change to the appropriate channel at the time the VCR needs to record. This requires a separate box for the VCR, or the viewer will have to watch what is being recorded. Another, less common option is an \"IR blaster\", which a recorder can use to control an external tuner, like a cable set-top box or converter box. However, older devices with IR blasters may not be fully compatible with digital subchannels; the converter box may require the use of a [-] or [.] button to specify the subchannel, which the pre-digital recorder may not know how to transmit. Some older TiVo brand digital recorders received software updates specifically to control digital converter boxes via the TiVo's included IR blaster.\n\nSmall battery-operated portable televisions, while valuable in time of disaster, are generally poorly suited to digital conversion. While at least one CECB (Winegard's RCDT09A) is operable from an external battery pack, the combination of television, converter, external antenna, and power supply limits portability. , portable digital LCD TV sets cost at least $100, and could not be used while in motion at significant speeds (restoring this analog functionality would require broadcasters to transmit mobile TV via the separate ATSC-M/H standard, which would in itself require new tuners).\n\nThe inability of some boxes to add new digital channels without a full re-scan—deleting all existing channel settings—renders them unusable to viewers who rely on directional antennas and rotors to receive distant stations. Signal strength meters, where available, are awkward, typically only displaying information for channels that have already been found. This is problematic, as digital signals are most often transmitted on higher frequencies or with far less power than their analog counterparts, requiring careful antenna installation, orientation and location to avoid obstructions, fading and multipath interference problems. Where the converter fails to receive a channel, an often-cumbersome manual process is usually provided; however, this requires knowledge of which frequencies each missing station is actually transmitting on, rather than the virtual channels each is mapped to by the ATSC protocol.\n\nSince the NTIA did not require CECBs to output MTS stereo signals via their radio-frequency output, THAT Corporation noted that consumers using RF-only connections with CECBs will lose stereo TV sound. This problem may be avoided by using the converter's line level audio outputs.\n\nA year before the transition, Ron Bruno, president of the Community Broadcasters Association (CBA), said only four of 37 NTIA-certified converter boxes had analog passthrough, and none had analog tuners.\n\nIn late March 2008, the CBA filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia seeking an injunction to halt the sale and distribution of CECBs. According to the CBA, the converters' lack of support for analog transmissions would harm its member stations, which include low-power and class A television stations, as it was cost-prohibitive for many of them to convert to digital transmission. The CBA claimed that the new boxes would prevent viewers from being able to watch these analog-only stations; viewers might not even be aware such stations still existed, because the boxes would not list them. At the time of the digital transition, the FCC did not set a deadline for existing LPTV stations to convert to digital service; however, it announced that no new analog LPTV stations would be authorized.\n\nResponding to the CBA, the FCC and NTIA urged manufacturers to include analog support voluntarily in all converter boxes. Manufacturers responded by releasing a new generation of models with the feature. Some new DVD recorders and personal video recorders also provide both analog and digital tuners, and therefore could perform the basic functions of a set-top box in both modes.\n\nIn early May 2008, the D.C. district court denied the CBA petition without comment. The CBA felt that the court wanted them to continue working with the FCC. The association said it would continue to pressure the FCC to support analog functionality as a requirement of the All-Channel Receiver Act, urge more government funding for low power and Class A broadcasters to transition to digital, and ask Congress to increase the number of such stations eligible for funds.\n\nOn August 13, 2009, the CBA announced that it would cease operations. One reason given was the cost required to fight \"restrictive regulations that kept the Class A and LPTV industry from realizing its potential\", including the campaign to require analog passthrough. Amy Brown, former CBA executive director, said \"some 40 percent of Class A and LPTV station operators believe they will have to shut down in the next year if they are not helped through the digital transition.\"\n\nIn June 2010, the FCC stopped accepting new applications for digital LPTV stations while it considered the spectrum needs of the National Broadband Plan. In a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published in September 2010, the FCC suggested setting a shutoff date for all analog TV transmissions, including LPTV stations, in 2012. It also proposed moving all low-power stations on channels 52–69 to new frequencies, to free the 700 MHz band for other uses. In April 2011, the NTIA announced that it would stop accepting applications for grants toward upgrading LPTV stations to digital transmission as of July 2, 2012. The grant program was initially funded with $44 million; , over $30 million in grant funding remained available.\n\nThe final deadline for LPTV Shutdown is 1 September 2015. The last NTIA grants offered to LPTV Broadcasters/Repeaters to convert their systems to digital ended in July 2012. The September 2015 deadline is to allow for possible new construction to accommodate digital equipment. Unlike the TV Full-Power Transmitter Digital Conversion in 2009, there will be no consumer subsidy program for the final LPTV digital conversion deadline since it is anticipated that without DTV Set-Top Converter Boxes, the majority of remaining SDTV/EDTV models in use should have left the consumer market by then.\n\nBy early January 2009, the NTIA had issued $1.34 billion worth of coupons for converter boxes, reaching the obligation limit set by the U.S. Congress in the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005. As a result, the NTIA started placing requests for coupons on a waiting list, issuing coupons as previously-issued but unredeemed coupons reached their expiration date.\n\nIn December 2008, FCC commissioner McDowell urged \"those who don't need the government subsidy not to wait on that process before purchasing a converter box for themselves or as a gift for someone else. During the weeks it takes for the government to process coupon requests, you will lose precious time to hook up the box, check antenna connections, and start enjoying free digital broadcast TV right away.\"\n\nNielsen Media Research estimated in August 2008 that 25 percent of affected viewers would opt for inexpensive converters instead of replacing existing televisions or switching to cable and satellite television subscriptions. By November 2008, 38.3 percent were planning to buy the less-costly converter boxes.\n\nMany retailers had stocked converters based on coupon use and shortages of the converter boxes themselves remained possible. In early February 2009, the Consumer Electronics Association estimated that three to six million converters were available, while Nielsen estimated 5.8 million American households were completely unready for digital transition. The \"New York Times\" estimated that converter supplies could run out by the end of the month. Manufacturers who had halted production ahead of the original February 17, 2009 deadline were to resume converter box assembly but this new stock was not expected in stores until April.\n\nLegislators from the American southwest were among those supporting a delay in the digital cutover, citing safety concerns because as many as a quarter of households in television markets there had not prepared to receive digital signals by January 2009. A judge from Hildago County, Texas noted that Latino, low-income, elderly, and rural homes were at risk. Some residents could receive analog signals from Mexico; Mexico does not plan to transition to digital transmission until the end of 2015.\n\nThe DTV Delay Act, signed into law on February 11, 2009, extended the digital transition deadline to June 12, 2009. The DTV Delay Act did not address the shortfall in funding for converter-box coupons; the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, part of a larger appropriations bill signed into law on February 17, 2009, added $650 million in funding—$490 million of that for coupons, increasing the total coupon-fund expenditure to $1.83 billion. By February 18, 36 percent of the United States's full-power stations had transitioned to digital-only, but five million of the nation's 115 million households remained entirely unready; at the time, 4.3 million coupon requests remained on the NTIA waiting list. The NTIA resumed issuing coupons in early March 2009, expecting to clear its backlog in two and a half weeks. Political issues had contributed to the delays in sending out coupons; the NTIA could not issue coupons above the spending limit set in the bill, even knowing that many already-issued coupons would expire. Even though unused coupons meant more money for the program, the coupons had to actually expire before the money could be \"reused\" for newly issued coupons. Those coupons it did send out were sent via standard mail, rather than first-class mail, as Congress had required in the legislation, but that caused coupons to be delayed up to four weeks.\n\nThe NTIA was legally required to issue coupons on a first-come, first-served basis; viewers in markets where individual stations ended analog broadcasts by the original deadline did not receive priority handling of their DTV coupon requests.\n\nOn March 24, 2009, the NTIA announced that the four-million-person waiting-list backlog had been cleared, meaning those whose coupons had expired could reapply. The NTIA estimated 17 million coupons had expired, while 25.7 million—56 percent of those issued—had been used. On April 12, Nielsen estimated that 3.6 million households remained unready.\n\nThe analog shutdown for full-power TV stations was completed in mid-2009, with several stations ending analog transmissions well before the June 12, 2009 deadline. (Many transitioned on the original February 17 date.) In most cases, at least one station in each media market continued analog broadcasts for up to 30 days afterward as an \"analog nightlight\"—prohibited from broadcasting regular programming, but allowed to transmit information on how to obtain and connect a converter box to receive digital programming (and send Emergency Alert System broadcasts.). This allowed viewers who had not converted by the deadline to receive at least one channel that would explain the absence of the other analog channels. The half-hour public service announcement with English and Spanish segments seen on most such stations was produced by the National Association of Broadcasters.\n\nNielsen said 2.5 million homes were still incapable of receiving a digital signal two days after the deadline. On June 17, 2009, the NTIA said two million requested coupons had not yet been mailed.\n\nThe NTIA reported that, as of July 22, 2009, 33,578,000 coupons had been used—more than the 33.5 million possible with the original $1.34 billion allocation. $435 million of the extra money added was already owed for pending requests.\n\nU.S. Representative Peter DeFazio and Senator Bernie Sanders introduced legislation which would have extended the converter-box coupon program beyond July 31, 2009, subsidized antennas, and require satellite and cable TV companies to provide a $10 basic-broadcast-channel package available to those who had lost the ability to receive at least one over-the-air channel because of the transition. Neither Congressman's bill was passed into law.\n\nAt midnight on July 31, 2009, the CECB program expired, without extension. Toward the end of July, consumers were making 35,000 requests for coupons per day, with just over half those issued being used. On July 30, though, the number of requests totalled 78,000, and on the final day, 169,000 were received. Requests sent via mail with a postmark of July 31 or earlier were processed; about $300 million in funding remained. By August 5, 2009, consumers had used 33,962,696 coupons.\n\nThe NTIA said 4,287,379 coupons had been requested but not redeemed. As of August 12, $310,796,690 was available, and if all requested coupons were redeemed, $139,300,174 would be left.\n\nAn unidentified NTIA source said the agency returned $241.6 million to the Treasury Department; $2.6 million went to \"final closeout costs\". After the program ended, $250 million from the original bill had not been used, and the additional $490 million allocated in February 2009 had not been touched. These funds almost equalled the $490 million Congress had appropriated to boost the program in January 2008, when it appeared the program would run out of money. The additional funding was needed to satisfy the accounting rules imposed on the program by Congress, rather than an actual need for the funds. The unused funds from the original bill went to a DTV public safety fund, as required in the legislation.\n\n\n\n"}

She has been credited with being a defining early influence on the gay and lesbian club scene in Sydney's Oxford Street and Newtown.\n\nBorn circa 1928 in the Sydney suburb of Paddington, she won a bursary to St Vincent's College, Potts Point, run by the Sisters of Charity. She left school at age 15, and three years later, aged 18, won the Australian ladies speed skating championship, turned professional and taught at the Glaciarium before going to London and Paris. She was briefly married to a butcher named Des Irwin. Her career began as an international ice skater when she was a teenager. It was while touring Paris as a performer in the \"Puss in Boots\" on ice show, she had her first romance with another woman.\n\nAfter her promising skating career was cut short by injury, O'Donnell ran a butcher shop in Double Bay and a parking lot in Ultimo, before opening her first gay bar, The Trolley Bar, off Broadway in 1968. Next she opened a gay bath-house (above a cake shop in Bondi Junction, New South Wales), followed in 1969 by Capriccio's, a gay night club on Oxford Street famous for its drag shows, which drew visiting celebrities from around the world.\n\nShe recognised the gay and lesbian potential of Oxford Street. At this time, homosexual acts between men were still illegal in New South Wales, and Dawn O'Donnell was known to pay bail to release gay men from police custody. Her gay and lesbian venues gave many \"a place to come out\". In 2001, O'Donnell recounted: \"The most fascinating thing in the world for me was eventually to see the New South Wales Police Force have a gay public relations officer. I never thought to my dying day I'd ever see that.\"\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, O'Donnell controlled a string of lesbian and gay venues in East Sydney, including:\n\nSome of these ventures were run in partnership with the late French restaurateur Roger Claude Teyssedre and controversial Sydney businessman Abe Saffron. The clubs attracted gays and lesbians from across Australia and around the world.\n\nDuring the 1980s, O'Donnell began to shift her focus from Oxford Street to the inner-west suburb of Newtown. She bought the Newtown and Imperial Hotels in nearby Erskineville, transforming the Newtown area into a gay precinct to rival Oxford Street. The Imperial Hotel featured in the opening scenes of the movie, \"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\". \n\nAccording to Graeme Browning (a.k.a. \"Mitzi Macintosh\") who performed drag shows at O'Donnell-owned venues for 10 years, \"She made the Sydney drag scene what it is, but our gay scene wouldn't be what it is without her either.\" Another drag performer, David Williams (aka \"Beatrice\") said \"she invented the idea of Oxford Street\", helping to make Sydney one of the gay capitals of the world.\n\nIn 1977, aged 49, O'Donnell met her long-term partner, Dutch-born Aniek Baten, who was 26 years old. They later married, both wearing white for the wedding.\n"}

It is a day for companies to thank their employees for their hard work and effort throughout the year. This day was created for the purpose of strengthening the bond between employer and employee.\n\nThough the holiday is still gaining in adoption in the U.S. and abroad, like Boss's Day, Employee Appreciation Day has become an opportunity for managers, company leadership and HR to remember the importance of appreciating employees. Companies often celebrate by letting employees leave early, offering gifts, events or special recognition for workers. Studies show that recognition and appreciation are growing in importance as drivers of employee happiness and engagement. This has resulted in more and more companies and organizations using the day to thank their employees.\n\nMany publications such as \"Inc.\" magazine, \"Forbes\", and Boston.com, are writing about the holiday to remind employers to recognize and reward employee effort and to offer tips for building a stronger corporate culture through appreciation. Showing employees appreciation can result in a company's higher retention rate, not only increasing the productivity of employees but the company as a whole.\n"}

It was published by Image Comics between January 2012 and July 2014. The series was initially announced as a 12-issue limited series, but it was later extended to 24 issues.\n\nThe series was originally announced in the back of the final issue of Brubaker and Phillips' previous collaboration, \"Criminal: Last of the Innocent\". Further details about the series, including its publisher, were revealed at the 2011 New York Comic Con. Brubaker also released a video teaser for the series.\n\nThe series began publishing monthly in January 2012. Although initially billed as a twelve-issue series, the length was increased in November 2012. The series concluded after 24 issues.\n\nSeveral issues featured an article written by Jess Nevins and others on the crime/noir characters, both fictional and real.\n\n\"Fatale\" chronicles the life of Josephine, or \"Jo\", an archetypal femme fatale who is seemingly immortal, having survived from the 1930s to the modern day unaged, and also has a supernatural ability to hypnotize men into becoming intensely infatuated with her, whether she wants them to be or not.\n\nThrough the decades, Jo struggles to understand and control her powers while being pursued by a violent cult. The cult worships cosmic gods reminiscent of Lovecraftian horrors, which are somehow tied to Jo.\n\nDuring her travels, Jo also encounters many men who quickly become entranced by her, often to fanatical degrees. They become entangled in her escapades, possibly as guardians, collaborators, and lovers. A motif of the series is how these men pay dearly for becoming involved with Jo.\n\nThe narrative jumps back and forth between different time periods and points of view, primarily Jo and the men entranced by her. The majority of the action in the first story arc takes place in the 1950s, the second in the 1970s, the third during the 1930s and World War II, while the fourth arc is set in the 1990s.\n\nA couple of issues featured stand-alone stories focused on \"fatales\" before Jo. Issue #12 tells the story of Mathilda in 13th century France, while Issue #13 tells the story of \"Black\" Bonnie in the Wild West. Aside from her powers, both women also shared striking physical similarities with Jo and found themselves pursued by the same cult.\n\nThe first ten issues were also collected into a deluxe hardcover edition, it includes behind-the-scenes art and stories, sketches and layouts, back page illustrations, and several of Jess Nevins' historical essays. A second hardcover collected issues 11-24.\n\nThe first issue sold well enough to return to press four times. Reviews for the series were mostly positive with comparisons to the creative team's previous work on \"Sleeper\", \"Criminal\", and \"Incognito\".\n\nEd Brubaker and Sean Phillips received multiple Eisner Awards nominations for \"Fatale\" in 2013: \"Best Continuing Series\" (Brubaker and Phillips), \"Best New Series\" (Brubaker and Phillips), \"Best Writer\" (Brubaker), \"Best Penciller/Inker\" (Phillips), and \"Best Cover Artist\" (Phillips).\n\nDavid Stewart received a 2013 Eisner award for \"Best Coloring\".\n"}

It is the prequel to \"Evergrace\".\n\n\"Forever Kingdom\" takes place directly before the events of \"Evergrace\". Darius lived a somewhat sheltered life with his parents in the small village of Solta. Though not having any siblings, Darius was very close to his friend Sharline, whom he cared for like a sister. However, Darius' simple home life in Solta would come to a tragic end when assassins hired by the secluded village of Morea murdered Darius' parents for unknown reasons. In addition to facing the loss of his family, Sharline was nowhere to be found, leaving Darius with the conclusion that she was also killed.\n\nShortly after the tragedy, Darius sought refuge with his childhood friend, Ruyan, from the village of Seclue. Ruyan's father agreed to take Darius under his wing, as well as training him in swordplay so that he might one day take vengeance against his adversaries. As time passed, Darius and Ruyan tirelessly trained together, eventually forming \"The Four Swordsmen of Solta\" with two other mentionable warriors, Drumhort and Saris.\n\nOnce prepared for his journey, Darius left Seclue in search of some answers into his parents' murder, as well as the disappearance of Sharline. Ruyan, being close to Darius, also decided to come along in hopes of aiding Darius in realizing his revenge. Though they travelled far abroad the continent of Edinbury, Darius and Ruyan's efforts had proven daunting. Just when they were about to give up all hope, however, the two suddenly stumbled upon an unconscious girl, who later claimed to suffer from amnesia. She could only recall her name—Faeana. Having nowhere else to go, Faeana decided to tag along with Darius and Ruyan, hoping that she might recognize someone or something along their journey.\n\nA year or so ago, as Darius and Ruyan were on their journey, a great 'cataclysm' had taken place, believed to be a war between Rieubane and another political power. The war generally affected much of Edinbury and its people, causing somewhat of a great depression. Though the political affairs of Rieubane—as well as the cause of the war—yet remain unknown, Faeana is believed to have some strange involvement in the Eve of Disaster. However, she herself cannot recall the events.\n\nAlong their travels, Darius and co. happen upon a mysterious girl named Solca. Before any acquaintances can be made, however, a dark wizard named Darsul and his clad guardian appear to abduct the girl, making quick work of Darius and his party. Before vanishing into thin-air with Solca, however, Darsul places a curse known as the 'Soul Bind' on Darius and his friends. It is later discovered that the 'Soul Bind' is a powerful spell which links the lifeforce of those afflicted, causing them to share the same experiences through a form of empathy. Baring this in mind, the three have no choice but to temporarily set aside their affairs and seek a cure, lest they otherwise perish together.\n\nDarius - \nA young swordsman from the village of Solta. His parents were murdered as a child, and his childhood friend Sharline was abducted, as well. He spent the rest of his childhood with his friend Ruyan, training to become one of \"The Four Swordsmen of Solta.\"\n\nHe has somewhat of a reserve about him, which often intimidates others. However, Darius has a genuine heart, and ultimately wishes to help those in need of his abilities.\n\nRuyan - \nA close childhood friend of Darius. Having much sympathy toward Darius' tragic past, Ruyan trains himself as a skilled swordsman so that he may fight by Darius' side and bring an end to the Eve of Disaster.\n\nRuyan is a very warm-hearted young man whose kind ethos prevents him from intently harming another. However, no cost—whether it be bloodshed or otherwise—is too great to achieve peace.\n\nFaeana - \nAn amnesiac young girl who was discovered unconscious by Darius and Ruyan on their travels. Having felt a warm presence about them, she travels at their side, hoping that she might recognize something along the way, or perhaps otherwise recall her memory.\n\nDarsul - \nA rather shady wizard who has some interest in a girl named Solca. Upon running into Darius and his party, Darsul inflicts them with the Soul Bind, and abducts Sulca without much revealing much of his reasoning.\n\nDrumhort - \nA clad swordsman currently travelling with Darsul for unknown reasons. He also aids in the abduction of Solca.\n\nSolca - \nA mysterious young girl who was being pursued by Darsul and Drumhort. Before her abduction, Darius and co. had shortly run into Solca, causing Faeana to experience strange feelings. Perhaps she and Faeana have some connection, though details are yet unknown.\n\nKarmyla - \nA dark woman with a very gothic-appearance who later accompanies Darsul, aiding him with much great wisdom. However, her intentions with Darsul otherwise remain shadowed from Darius and his party.\n\nFelk - \nCurrently leading the Solta army, Felk spends most of his time searching for his lost half-brother. He is usually accompanied by a swordsman named Saris.\n\nSaris - \nA nomadic mercenary foreign to Edinbury. He often accompanies Felk, serving as his right-hand man.\n\nThe Soul Bind is a curse placed on Darius and his party which causes them to share the same lifeforce. Thus, if a member of Darius' party is attacked, then they all endure damage. Consequently, healing one character also heals the other two, as well.\n\nGenerally, a 'Soul' gauge measures the overall lifeforce of the party, which is displayed at the bottom-left corner of the screen. When damage is taken by any of the three player-characters, the gauge decreases. If the gauge is completely depleted, then the entire party perishes simultaneously. While proving to be somewhat frustrating, the game features an option which allows Life Extracts (healing potions) to be used at the press of the button, removing some of the challenge of managing three characters who share one life gauge.\n\nRather than implementing a level-up system like most RPGs, Forever Kingdom utilizes character growth through equipment upgrading. Each item either raises or lowers attributes respectively, and may be tampered with at shops to increase this effectivity. Though very cost-heavy, character growth is seen to be more customizable with this method.\n\n"}

It opened in 1959, designed by Arto Monaco and built by amusement park builder Charles Wood. The park was approximately 3-4 city blocks in size, and featured some standard amusement rides, (a Ferris wheel, merry-go-round, bumper cars, Tilt a Whirl, etc.) as well as some unusual rides. The main feature of the park was the Opera House where Vaudeville-style shows, including an Ice Show, melodramas, and a wide variety of stage acts performed all day and until lights-out each evening. The park was closed in 1989.

When Canada's Wonderland first opened in 1981, there were 26 attractions. Today, there are 69, including the attractions inside Splash Works, a water park adjacent to the main theme park. Since the opening of the amusement park, at least one attraction has been added every year except 2009 and 2013. In addition, SkyRider closed permanently in 2014; it was the only roller coaster to close in the park's history and was relocated to Italy. SkyHawk, a Sky Roller by Gerstlauer Rides, and Flying Eagles from Larson International opened in 2016. The 2017 additions include Soaring Timbers and Muskoka Plunge and the 2018 additions include Lumberjack and Flying Canoes; Soaring Timbers, Lumberjack, and Flying Canoes are flat rides, while Muskoka Plunge is a water ride.\n\nUp until 1992, Canada's Wonderland did not have a water park. Eleven years after the park opened, Splash Works was constructed in the area surrounding the Mighty Canadian Minebuster. Original plans and park maps during construction of the park show that the area that is now Splash Works and White Water Canyon was originally planned to be a themed area called \"Frontier Canada\", a section of the park devoted to the Canadian wilderness. Although this section was never built, several of the elements that were to be included are now scattered across the park.\n\nFor safety, Canada's Wonderland uses a ride rating system that classifies the attractions based on the intensity of the ride. The ratings vary from 1, for rides that are calm and gentle, to 5, for rides that have high speeds, aggressive forces, and rapid elevation changes. A separate set of ride ratings criteria is used for attractions inside Splash Works, though the rides are still rated on a scale from 1 to 5.\n\nSplash Works opened in 1992, eleven years after Canada's Wonderland opened. Four years later, Canada's Wonderland expanded the water park by adding Whitewater Bay (a wave pool), The Pump House (an interactive children's playground), and The Black Hole (an enclosed water slide). There were two more expansions in 1999 and 2002. 12 years later, the park announced that Splash Works would receive a new water slide, Typhoon, and an interactive aquatic playground. In 2017, Muskoka Plunge opened. Some attractions require a personal flotation device (PFD; \"lifejacket\").\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4541419", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4541419", "title": "List of David Letterman sketches", "text": "List of David Letterman sketches\n\nCBS's Late Show with David Letterman regularly featured different sketches that follow the monologue and precede interviews with guests. Often these are repeated absurdist segments, involving various cast members, Dave's friends, audience participation, edited or contrived news or promotional videos, or competitions or stunts staged outside the Ed Sullivan Theater. Many of the same sketches originally debuted on Letterman's previous series, NBC's \"Late Night with David Letterman\" and \"The David Letterman Show\".\n\nThe show's regularly scheduled segments consisted of \"Small Town News\" on Mondays and \"Fun Facts\" on Fridays. Thursdays often featured a rotating set of three audience participation segments: \"Know Your Current Events\", \"Stump the Band\", and \"Audience Show and Tell.\"\n\n\"Stupid Pet Tricks\" and \"Stupid Human Tricks\", two of Letterman's trademark bits from \"Late Night\", continued to be presented on the \"Late Show\", though much less frequently.\n\nThere were also running gags, which may continue for about a month, such as playing José Feliciano's \"Old Turkey Buzzard\" or Do The Hammerlock Or other sound effects when a card \"crashes through the window\" or telephone calls from \"Len Easton, California Highway Patrol\" or Joe McCain on a telephone that Dave acknowledges is a prop that is not connected. Dave expresses amusement or annoyance when these recurring events.\n\nThis article focuses on sketches that have been featured on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\".\n\nAnnouncer Alan Kalter's (and before him, Bill Wendell's) introduction of Letterman, while technically not a skit, assigned a bizarre modification to Letterman's name and appears at the beginning of every show. (\"\"And now: Microscopic Sea Creature, David Letterman!\") Letterman's title changes every night and often makes reference to a current event. (\"And now: Disenfranchised French Youth, David Letterman!\") Prior to September 11, 2001, the first line of Wendell's and Kalter's introductions contained humorous descriptions of New York City (\"From New York! Where the rats hate the subways, too!\"). Once the \"Late Show\" returned to air on September 17, 2001, the introduction changed simply to, \"From New York! The \"greatest\" city in the world!\"\" This remained the standard introduction for over ten years; however, \"The greatest city in the world!\" is omitted from episodes with guest hosts, as is the host 'title'. In 2011, Kalter took to shortening 'David' to 'Dave', in his introduction of Letterman. At some point prior to late 2012, he once again returned to using 'David'. Beginning on January 2, 2013, the introduction began \"\"From the heart of Broadway, broadcasting across the nation and around the world!\", while Alan also included a brief self-introduction of himself (\"I'm Alan Kalter\"\") after introducing Paul Shaffer & The CBS Orchestra at this time as well.\n\nWhile Letterman himself often participated in many of the show's non-\"desk comedy\" routines in its earlier years (as well as on \"Late Night\"), over time he has increasingly preferred to have others star in them instead. Letterman is now rarely featured in any of the show's frequent pre-taped bits.\n\nKalter, bandleader and sidekick Paul Shaffer, and Hello Deli proprietor Rupert Jee are often used instead in comedy routines, as are stage manager Biff Henderson, stagehands Pat Farmer and Kenny Sheehan, handyman George Clarke, \"cue card boy\" Tony Mendez, head carpenter Harold Larkin, cameraman Dave Dorsett, assistant Stephanie Birkitt, former writers Gerard Mulligan and Chris Elliott (who almost always appear together), and Johnny Dark (a personal comedy friend of Letterman's).\n\nLetterman's mother, Dorothy, also made appearances (via satellite from Indianapolis) from time to time, including each Thanksgiving. She perhaps rose to fame mostly as a result of her nightly reporting from the 1994 Winter Olympics in Norway.\n\nFormer recurring players from the show include Mujibur Rahman and Sirajul Islam (employees of a nearby gift store which has since relocated), Calvert DeForest (a.k.a. Larry \"Bud\" Melman), and scenic designer Kathleen Ankers (reprising her \"Late Night\" role of \"Peggy, the Foulmouthed Chambermaid\"; on CBS, she was the equally censored \"Helen, the Ill-tempered Ticket Lady\").\n\nRandom cameo appearances were made during the span of the show, most notably in the earlier years by the Tony Randall, with Regis Philbin later filling that void.\n\nFor a while, Letterman took great delight in making fun of his employer, continuing a tradition established at NBC, with senior CBS Corporation executive Les Moonves often serving as the target of his abuse. In time, Letterman's relationship with Moonves improved; a segment titled \"More with Les\" featured jocular phone calls between Letterman and Moonves.\n\nAnnouncer Alan Kalter was frequently used in comedy bits, often with Kalter as the butt of the joke:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Letterman left NBC and moved to CBS to begin the \"Late Show\" in the summer of 1993, several of \"Late Night's\" long-running comedy bits made the move with him, including perhaps his best known, the Top Ten List. Letterman renamed a few of his regular bits to avoid legal problems over trademark infringement (NBC claimed that what he did on \"Late Night\" was \"intellectual property\" of the network). For example, \"Viewer Mail\" on NBC became the \"CBS Mailbag\", and Larry \"Bud\" Melman began to use his real name, Calvert DeForest.\n\nOne recurring sketch on both the NBC and CBS shows has been the destruction of household items by various methods including explosives, steamrollers, and - most often - throwing them off the roof of the Ed Sullivan Theater. While popular with fans, Letterman gradually lessened the frequency of such segments.\n\nLetterman also has a knack for consuming food products and drinks that appear on his show. Among the items that he has consumed are: wine from a bottle used for a cooking demonstration; various kinds of liquor (while quipping \"\"We're gonna lose our liquor license\"); Popeyes \"Full Flavor Green Beans\";\" \"motor oil\" (actually chocolate syrup) from a bottle that bore a \"Quaker State\" label; Red Bull; liquid from a bottle that supposedly contained Wite-Out; pills from boxes labeled \"Lipitor\" and \"Cialis\" (obviously not really the drugs); and even cosmetic products. On one occasion, Letterman took a healthy swig of \"low-carb suntan lotion\" and immediately spit it out, having discovered that it actually \"was\" suntan lotion.\n\n\"The Late Show\" is well known for its repeated absurdist segments, often taking the form of competitions or audience participation. The charm of such segments is often that they are completely pointless, yet are taken seriously by Letterman and all involved.\n\nThe Top Ten List appears almost daily on the \"Late Show\", and remains one of the few regular segments carried over from \"Late Night.\" It is often the last comedic segment presented prior to the show's first guest. List topics are often inspired by current news and pop cultural events, with typical lists bearing titles such as \"Top Ten Signs...\" and \"Top Ten Reasons...\" The Top Ten List is compiled by the show's writing staff, and is usually read by Letterman, although the show occasionally uses guest presenters. Some Top Ten List themes reappear seasonally, such as the carolers singing \"Top Ten Least Popular Holiday Songs.\"\n\nFor a long time, the Top Ten Lists were said to have been written in a so-called \"Home Office\". There were various Home Offices before the part was dropped, but the list included Sioux City, Iowa; Grand Rapids, Michigan; and Wahoo, Nebraska - all actual, extant towns. (\"Late Show\" staffer Mike McIntee's nightly online recap of the show, the \"Wahoo Gazette,\" is named after the Nebraska town.)\n\nThe Top Ten List has occasionally been a casualty of time constraints. Letterman may announce that the Top Ten List is coming up, or Kalter will promote it before the first commercial, when, in fact, it is not delivered on that night's show and is instead held until the next morning, when it is broadcast across Westwood One/CBS Radio Network.\n\n\"Great Moments in Presidential Speeches\" was a near-daily segment which presented a series of three video excerpts. Originally, the first two come from actual famous moments, Franklin D. Roosevelt's inaugural speech (\"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself\") and John F. Kennedy's inaugural speech (\"Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country\").\n\nThe third excerpt featured President George W. Bush in an unintentionally comical moment, often during press conferences or town hall gatherings. These moments frequently focused on President Bush stuttering, finding himself at a loss for words, or uttering a nonsensical Bushism. The excerpts were also often taken out of context for humorous effect, such as when Bush declared, \"My kids can't read!\", \"My lawyer's a Latino\" or \"Why should I care about Africa?\"\n\nThe \"Great Moments\" presentation also featured Dwight Eisenhower, Harry S. Truman, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and even President Bush's father, followed by Bush himself. One adaptation was of President Kennedy's Berlin speech, with the words \"Ich bin ein Berliner\", followed by President Reagan's Berlin speech (\"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall\") in 1987 (Reagan was also featured in another Letterman skit \"The Reagan Diaries\"), and as always, an excerpt from President Bush's recent speeches. An Abraham Lincoln impostor (Johnny Dark) has also given the \"Tear down this wall\" speech. President Lyndon Johnson made his debut on \"Great Moments\" with his declaration not to seek reelection in 1968. George Washington's, Abraham Lincoln's, Roosevelt's, and Kennedy's portraits were shown in the graphic at the beginning and end of \"Great Moments.\"\n\nAfter a few months into the segment's inception, the Kennedy inauguration clip began to include a \"Late Show\" staffer (often dressed in formal period garb) superimposed over the empty seat to Kennedy's right. The staffers included announcer Alan Kalter, \"cue card boy\" Tony \"Inky\" Mendez (who showed cue cards to President Kennedy), costume designer Susan Hum (whose actions included taking his picture with a disposable camera, removing lint from his shoulder, stealing his wallet, and eating a jumbo pretzel), associate producer Nancy Agostini, and stage manager Biff Henderson. All \"cameos\" ended with the staffers clapping along in real-time response to Kennedy's speech.\n\nAfter the incident when an Iraqi journalist threw his shoes at Bush, flying shoes were shown in the introductory vignettes of the other Presidents, including shoes thrown at Abraham Lincoln giving the Gettysburg Address.\n\nThe last airing of the sketch involving Bush was January 16, four days before the inauguration of President Barack Obama.\n\nThe first airing of the sketch after President Obama entered office was Monday January 26, 2009, but the Obama speech that was captured appeared to have no comedic value, thus heralding the beginning of the Obama presidency as well as fulfilling the actual purpose of the Great Moments segment. On the next GMIPS, aired January 28, 2009, President Obama's face was superimposed over the body of former President Bush in one of his speeches, pretending that Obama was speaking comically, but it was actually the voice of President Bush. After that, other sketches, such as \"This Day in the Clinton Marriage\", were substituted in the time slot when \"Great Moments\" previously appeared.\n\nAn item is dropped into a tank of water by two models, often referred to by Letterman as \"The Hi-Ho Girls.\" The segment starts out with Kalter identifying a household item that will be tested, and a faux prize that is supposedly at stake. A picture of that prize is flashed on screen for a split second. Letterman and Shaffer debate the buoyant properties of the item before they each decide on whether it will sink or float (a frequent deciding factor is the nature of the item's container).\n\nTwo models then drop the item into the tank while the \"Late Show\" \"Hula Hoop Girl\" (Anna Jack) and \"Grinder Girl\" (Kiva Kahl) perform on either side of the tank. Depending upon the outcome, large flashing words appear reading, \"It Floats!\" (accompanied by a ringing bell) or \"It Sinks!\" (accompanied by a buzzer).\n\nLetterman often espouses the educational merit of the game in jest, citing positive feedback from parents, educators, and clergymen. He has acknowledged that while the segment is not popular with the \"Late Show\" staff, he insists on continuing it for his own amusement. Letterman joked that the skit was adapted from a similar BBC programme entitled \"Is It Buoyant?\" He also often advertises the (fictional) \"Will It Float\" home game, which \"has everything you need in a box to play the game for only $19.99.\" The game consists only of a list of suggested household items and a bottle of water. Recently, Letterman has also been advertising the PlayStation 3 version of the \"Will It Float?\" home game, and in the past would highlight the Xbox 360 version. At one point, he issued viewers a warning to stay away from the knockoff version, \"Does it Sink?\", which could be found being hawked by street vendors on Canal Street. After the game is over, Letterman often addresses the women by saying he will see them at \"the big 'Will It Float?' party\" after the show.\n\nIn this segment, the stage curtain is raised to reveal an individual or team performing an unusual stunt, often accompanied by music from the CBS Orchestra. Flanking the performer, who varies, are two previous performers who became regulars for the segment:\n\n\nAfter about thirty seconds the curtain is lowered and Letterman discusses with Shaffer whether the act was \"something\" or \"nothing.\" As the segment continued over the course of time, Letterman would increasingly express disinterest in the featured performer, opting instead to admire the Grinder Girl. Shaffer in turn would often admit to having been too distracted with his performance of the music.\n\nOn an episode in June 2003, the curtain rose to reveal members of the Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils. Martin Brodeur hoisted the trophy, leading the crowd in a chant of \"Devils! Devils!\" Letterman and Shaffer ruled it as definitely \"something.\"\n\n\"Is This Anything\" lay dormant for almost a year before it was resurrected on the March 22, 2006 episode. A man balanced himself on a ladder and juggled: Paul Shaffer voted a clear \"nothing\", and Letterman was going to vote \"something\" before he noticed a safety mat. Letterman then concurred with Shaffer.\n\nIn an uncharacteristic move, Letterman invited Sharon Osbourne to assist in officiating \"Is This Anything\" on the July 26, 2007 episode, due to her involvement with \"America's Got Talent\". The act consisted of a man balancing an aluminum ladder on his chin while riding a unicycle, and all three agreed that it was nothing.\n\nOften presented on Mondays, Letterman presents a series of actual news items, advertisements, and police blotter excerpts which are shown to be unintentionally humorous. In earlier incarnations, Letterman would precede the segment by asking the audience to \"please wait for the humorous comment\", which consisted of him reciting a scripted follow-up to each news item. While this ostensibly differentiated the segment from Jay Leno's similar sketch, \"Headlines\" (though \"Small Town News\" was a segment on Late Night from its 1982 inception, and even appeared on Letterman's 1980 daytime show), the later revival of \"Small Town News\" only includes an occasional impromptu remark from Letterman. On at least one occasion, Letterman has claimed that Leno's headlines is a copy of the sketch.\n\nThursday episodes usually include one of three rotating variations of audience participation segments. Each game starts with Letterman making small talk with each of the featured audience members, asking about their background and occupations, often with humorous results. When the individual has completed their portion, they are given a gift certificate to a local restaurant as well as random gift items. Occasionally, the participant is a ringer from the show staff.\n\n\n\n\nUsually presented on Fridays, the segment consists of Letterman reading a series of trivia, records, and statistics. Letterman explains that the \"Fun Facts\" are submitted to the show each week by \"Gary Sherman\", the head of the fictional \"Federal Bureau of Miscellaneous Information\" (FBMI) and a supposed acquaintance of Shaffer whom Letterman claims he met at Shaffer's wedding. The segment often begins with Letterman presenting a few real facts to set up the premise (although they are often of a humorous nature in their own right and are mistaken by some audience members as made-up). He then presents several humorous, fictional \"facts.\" Most of these are of an absurdist nature, such as \"The first pair of binoculars had a 1x magnification\", or \"For a short amount of time, the rock band The Who broke up, and formed two new bands called The When and The What.\" An irrelevant promotional announcement of some kind is mixed in on occasion, much to Letterman's confusion.\n\nThe segment was initially presented on the show sporadically before being made a regular weekly feature. Letterman is also promoting a Fun Facts book (unlike the \"Will it Float?\" game, a real book, ).\n\nA camera crew is sent to Rupert Jee in the neighboring Hello Deli, where Jee is asked to invite a potential player from the crowd outside. The player introduces him or herself, relates his or her background, and is told what prize is to be won. Regardless of the outcome, the player is also awarded a \"Hello Deli Platter\" by the Hi-Ho Girls.\n\nRecurring games include \"Beat the Clock\"—echoing the title of a game show from the early days of television—in which the confused player helplessly attempts to stop a clock from counting down to zero, and \"What's on the iPod?\", in which Rupert tunelessly sings along to a song on his iPod and the contestant has to guess what song he is listening to.\n\nOther games involve a player searching for a hidden item in the deli, and guessing the nature of an item obscured under an item of clothing worn by Jee (such as a Hillary Clinton-esque pantsuit). Occasionally, the supposed player is a \"plant\" and the segment ends when the \"player\" appears to be severely injured. Johnny Dark has appeared, under various names, as the contestant, in which case the routine consists of him asking so many questions that there is no time for the game itself. Biff Henderson has hosted similar games on the street.\n\nThese segments were carried over from \"Late Night\", and consist of three pre-selected participants (or in the case of \"Pet Tricks\", pets and their owners), who each demonstrate an unusual talent or stunt on the stage. Letterman will often precede the segment with the tongue-in-cheek warning: \"Remember, this is not a competition, it is only an exhibition — please, no wagering.\" While still a trademark feature of the \"Late Show\", the segment has been featured on a more sporadic basis in recent years. The show's regular \"Audience Show and Tell\" bit will often include an audience member performing a \"Stupid Human Trick\"-type act.\n\nExplod-O-Pop is a brand of popping corn, and is usually given as a prize to the participants of the audience participation games. Letterman often describes the product using various slogans such as \"America's Only Atomic Popping Corn\", \"It's Carbolicious\", and \"It's Contaminated with Flavor!\"\n\nIt was available at CBS's online store, with the proceeds benefitting the American Foundation for Courtesy and Grooming, a charity of Letterman's which contributes its proceeds to a wide variety of foundations, most of which are of a health, youth, or educational nature.\n\nLate in the show, a short segment will consist of a camera panning across the audience as it applauds during the break. A comedy piece will usually be superimposed above this video; in most cases this is either a graphic presenting a game or announcement narrated by Kalter, or a comedy piece featuring Kalter himself. Since returning from the hiatus caused by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, however, these segments now usually feature a Kalter voice-over promoting future guests, concluded by a phrase such as \"Get your VCRs ready!\"\n\n\n\n\nDuring the mid-1990s a frequent \"Late Show\" routine was The Quiz Machine, a large device wheeled out onto the stage, which progressively got bigger and more advanced as weeks went on.

{"id": "4245984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4245984", "title": "Little Iodine", "text": "Little Iodine\n\nLittle Iodine was an American Sunday comic strip, created by Jimmy Hatlo, which was syndicated by King Features and ran 1943 until 1985. The strip was a spin-off of \"They'll Do It Every Time\", an earlier Hatlo creation.\n\nFrom 1943 to 1963, \"Little Iodine\" was written and drawn by Hatlo, who said, \"I tried to make her the embodiment of all the brats I knew... I tried to make her naughty as hell—and still likable.\"\n\nAl Scaduto also contributed to the strip in 1966, with Hy Eisman and Bob Dunn taking the strip from 1967 through its end in 1985. Iodine also appeared in a series of 56 Dell Comics between 1949 and 1962.\n\nFirst seen during the 1930s in a supporting role in Hatlo's popular gag panel, \"They'll Do It Every Time\", Little Iodine was the daughter of Henry Tremblechin and his wife, Cora. Her purpose was to serve as a pesky nuisance to the strip's star, Henry, and her behavior caused endless misery for her mild-mannered, easily unsettled father.\n\nHowever, Iodine proved to be popular in her own right, stealing the strip from her parents, so Hatlo promoted the character into her own strip in 1943. Iodine's antics gave the Sunday comics page a female precursor to Hank Ketcham's \"Dennis the Menace\".\n\nIn 1946, Comet Productions, a company established by Mary Pickford, her husband, Charles Rogers and Columbia executive Ralph Cohn, produced a 56-minute feature film, \"Little Iodine\", starring Hobart Cavanaugh as Henry, Irene Ryan as Cora and Jo Ann Marlowe as Little Iodine. The film was directed by Reginald Le Borg.\n\nIn the movie, Iodine thinks that her mother is having an affair with Professor Simkins (Leon Belasco). Consequently, she tries one antic after another to break up the adulterous couple. Her efforts backfire when they cause conflict between Henry and his employer, Mr. Bigdome (Emory Parnell). \n\nThe film was scheduled for release earlier than October 20, 1946 (its actual distribution date), but that date was postponed due to an epidemic of polio that prevented children across the United States from attending films. The film is currently believed to be lost.\n\n\n"}

In the first episode Luntik is shown hatching from an egg on the moon and then falling to Earth. All of the following series take place at a forest glade near a pond where Luntik finds a new home. Early on in the series, Luntik is adopted by two anthropomorphic bees that become his grandfather and grandmother. Like the bees, the majority of the characters are small anthropomorphic animals such as insects, fish, frogs, and turtles, playing the roles of adults and children. The main characters learn about the world through new experiences and interactions with one another. The series provides a positive message; even the negative characters, such as the two trouble-making caterpillars and the angry leech are shown as also having positive qualities. The series runs in a format of 6-minute episodes, each unfolding as a separate, self-contained story.\n\nIn Russia, the show premiered on the TV channel Russia-1 and was broadcast for 8 years from 1 September 2006 until 15 May 2014.

{"id": "32566705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32566705", "title": "Marshall Pinckney Wilder", "text": "Marshall Pinckney Wilder\n\nMarshall Pinckney Wilder (September 19, 1859 – January 10, 1915) was an American actor, monologist, humorist and sketch artist.\n\nMarshall Pinckney Wilder (sometimes spelled Marshal) was born along the north shore of Seneca Lake at Geneva, New York, the son of Dr. Louis de Valois Wilder and the former Mary A. Bostwick. He shared the same name as his great-uncle, a distinguished amateur pomologist and floriculturist who helped found the Boston Horticultural Society and American Pomological Society. His father was an 1843 graduate of the Geneva Medical College and for a number of years an attending physician at Flower Hospital at the New York Medical College and a member of the New York Homeopathic Medical Society.\n\nWhile still a boy, Wilder's family moved to Rochester where he became popular for his talent as a storyteller and apparent gift as a clairvoyant. It was also at Rochester that Wilder received his early inspiration for a later vocation after attending a public reading at Corinthian Hall. In his youth he worked as a pin-boy at a bowling alley and storeroom clerk for a summer resort, before moving to New York City around the age of twenty where found employment as a file boy with a commercial firm. Wilder starting augmenting his income by giving humorous monologues for 50 cents a performance.\n\nThese early performances held in the drawing rooms of wealthy New Yorkers gained him the notoriety to soon join the ranks of full-time entertainers. In 1883 Wilder traveled to London where he became a favorite of the British Royal Family. While still the Prince of Wales, King Edward VII became an admirer of Wilder and over the years would attend nearly twenty of his performances. Wilder's career eventually branched into vaudeville and in 1904 embarked on a round the world tour.\n\nIn describing his monologues the \"Syracuse Herald\" wrote in a 1907 article: \"His pathos, his humor, his indescribable droll and uplifting optimism keeps bubbling forth all through the evening\".\n\nWilder, who always signed his correspondence \"Merrily yours\", authored three books over his career: \"The People I've Smiled With\" (1899), \"The Sunnyside of the Street\" (1905), and \"Smiling Around the World\" (1908); and edited a number of volumes of \"The Wit and Humor of America\" and \"The Ten Books of the Merrymakers\". \"The Washington Post\" wrote in 1915 of his coping with physical disabilities (dwarfism and kyphosis), \"Wilder coaxed the frown of adverse fortune into a smile.\"\n\nThough nearly forgotten today, Wilder was heralded in his lifetime and did not let his dwarfism be an excuse for cheap entertainment. Wilder shunned offers by showmen like P.T. Barnum to instead become an established legitimate stage actor and sketch artist. He made his earliest motion picture appearance in 1897, for which he received $600, and his last in 1913. Wilder also left recordings of his routines.\n\nAt the end of each performance Wilder was known to seek out everyone involved in the show to shake their hand always with a generous tip in his palm. Wilder was until his final curtain call a headliner earning a five-figure annual income. At one point in his career Wilder was willing to take a cut in pay in order to play a vaudeville circuit he felt catered to an audience that better appreciated his humor. This did not happen, however, because of booking issues.\n\nIn 1903 Marshall Wilder married Sophie Cornell Hanks, the daughter of a New Jersey dentist. Sophie was a writer and dramatist who collaborated with Wilder on his books. Their daughter Grace was born in 1905 around the time the couple returned from the world tour. Marshall Jr. followed a year or so later. On December 20, 1913, Sophie died at the age of 35 in New York City after a brief illness and failed operation. She was in the city to give dramatic readings of her new book, \"The Golden Lotus\".\n\nFollowing the loss of his wife, Wilder's health began to decline and a little over a year later fell ill while in St. Paul, Minnesota, for an engagement. His death there on January 10, 1915, was attributed to heart disease complicated by pneumonia. The funeral service was held a few days later at the Stephen Merritt Mortuary Chapel in New York. The writer and artist Elbert Hubbard wrote an obituary for Wilder which declared Wilder \"picked up the lemons that Fate had sent him and started a lemonade-stand.\" Marshal Wilder was survived by his children, who shared the bulk of his quarter-million-dollar estate, and a sister, Jennie Cornelia Wilder, who also had some success as an entertainer of diminutive stature.\n\nDuring the Great Depression Grace Wilder served as director of the Puppets and Marionettes department of the Public Works Administration (PWA) Drama Division. She would later serve in a similar capacity as a social worker in New York City and with community puppet theaters in California. According to one of his obituaries, puppetry was a childhood interest of her father's who would entertain his neighbors with Punch and Judy shows charging two cents admission or a nickel for reserved seating.\n\nMarshall P. Wilder Jr. (1913–1964) became a pioneer in the development of television when in 1931 he participated in the first successful transmission of a signal to a ship stationed some 50 miles offshore. And later during World War II was one of the technicians who helped develop what today are called smart bombs by engineering a television camera small enough to fit into the nosecone of a bomb or unmanned aircraft that could be directed by remote control.\n\n\n"}

The game was one of the first Czech point-and-click adventures. \n\nMael Software Group was formed in 1994 in Děčín by Petr Mandík. The game was worked on by Petr Mandík, who programmed on a black-and-white PC, and Tomáš Jerie, who created the graphics once it was already programmed on the Commodore Amiga 500 computer. The game engine is similar to Sierra Entertainment's \"\", which Mandík had played in the summer of 1994. After finishing that title, he tried to program a similar one, which took about four weeks. The following four weeks after that saw the game's narrative and graphics come into being. The duo playtested the game together in their house and decided that it was fun; they chose to distribute it to players after the holidays, which they did by copying the game to floppy disks and offering it to retail stores.\n\nThe player takes control of Earthling Mavlin Malner who is kidnapped by aliens in a flying saucer to the planet of Moguns, and must make his way back home again. The game has fail-states; it is possible for the main character to die.\n\nThe gameplay takes the form of a point and click sci-fi adventure, whereby players control Mavlin via six graphically presented commands. The game contains an inventory, however items may only be interacted with hotspots on the screen, and can't be combined.\n\nUnlike other contemporary Czech games such as \"Tajemství Oslího ostrova\" (1994) and \"7 dní a 7 nocí\" (1994), \"Mavlin: Vesmírný únik\" received a negative reception. For instance, \"Excalibur\" magazine only gave the game a rating of 18%, particularly criticising the music and graphic design. Computer Experts likened the title to \"Stíny noci\".\n\n"}

The basically one-woman show, conceived and written by Will Holt and Linda Hopkins and performed by Hopkins, features songs by Lil Green, Clarence Williams, Henry Creamer, Andy Razaf, and Jimmy Cox, among others. \n\nIt originally was presented at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. from November 1-17, 1974, then produced by the Center Theatre Group and staged by Robert Greenwald at the Mark Taper Forum from April 4 through May 3, 1975. \n\nThe Broadway production was directed by Greenwald, with special dance sequences choreographed by Lester Wilson for two characters, identified only as Man and Woman (Lester Wilson and Gerri Dean). Howlett Smith and Lenny Hambro were co-Musical Directors. Donald Harris was responsible for scenic design.\n\nFollowing two previews, it opened at the Ambassador Theatre on October 22, 1975. It transferred to the Edison Theatre on December 3, 1975 and remained there until December 5, 1976, running for a total of 453 performances. Between September 24 and its closing, it ran in repertory with \"Oh! Calcutta!\"\n\n\"In and Around Town\", a weekly critical guide for entertainment in \"New York\", included a capsule review for \"Me and Bessie\" that read, \"The raw fervor of Linda Hopkins's blues singing is all that matters here, and it's enough. Unfortunately, the show is also burdened with a silly script by Will Holt, which consists mostly of having Miss Hopkins disavow the fact that she's Bessie Smith with all the fervor of a Kennedy disavowing politics.\" However, in 2011, Backstage magazine remembered Hopkin's performance as Smith: \"It's been 36 years since I saw her in it at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, but she's stayed with me as the definitive Bessie Smith, and of course the cast album plays even more powerfully than Smith's original.\" \n\nLinda Hopkins was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Unique Theatrical Experience but lost to \"The Norman Conquests\". The production held the record for the longest-running one-woman show in Broadway history until \"Golda's Balcony\", starring Tovah Feldshuh, surpassed it by forty performances. \n\n"}
{"id": "183181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=183181", "title": "Media of Canada", "text": "Media of Canada\n\nCanada has a well-developed media sector, but its cultural output particularly in English films, television shows, and magazines is often overshadowed by imports from the United States. Television, magazines, and newspapers are primarily for-profit corporations based on advertising, subscription, and other sales-related revenues. Nevertheless, both the television broadcasting and publications sectors require a number of government interventions to remain profitable, ranging from regulation that bars foreign companies in the broadcasting industry to tax laws that limit foreign competition in magazine advertising.\n\nIn the broadcasting sector, Canada has a government-funded broadcaster, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation/Société Radio-Canada, which operates radio and TV networks in English and French. As well, some provincial governments offer their own public educational TV broadcast services as well, such as Ontario's TVOntario and Quebec's Télé-Québec. Given Canada's small market and its position next to the dominant producer of feature films (the United States), the Canadian film industry receives substantial assistance from the government. In the 2000s, about half of the budget of a typical Canadian film came from various federal and provincial government sources.\n\nThe organization Reporters Without Borders compiles and publishes an annual ranking of countries based upon the organization's assessment of their press freedom records. In 2011-12 Canada was ranked 10th out of 179 countries, which was an improvement from the preceding year.\n\nThe history of Canadian media performers goes back to the first days of radio. In the 1940s, the Radio Artists of Toronto Society (RATS) was formed. Radio performers in Montreal, Winnipeg and Vancouver also organized to fight for artists' rights, working conditions and better fees. In 1943, the Association of Canadian Radio Artists (ACRA) was formed as a loose national coalition of actors' groups. Over the years, ACRA evolved to become the Association of Canadian Radio and Television Artists, the Canadian Council of Authors and Artists, the Association of Canadian Television and Radio Artists and, in 1984, the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists.\n\nThe Canadian Broadcasting Act, historically and in its modern conception, is based on the fact that since the start of the 20th century, it was important for broadcasters to ensure that information flowed freely and reflected the diversity of Canadian points of view, as opposed to the classic approach, which gives media owners more freedom to express their views. The Canadian broadcasting system as it exists today \"would probably not exist if we had allowed the marketplace to regulate ownership rights.\"\n\nThe Canadian government regulates media ownership and the state of media through the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Commission. Section 3 of the Canadian Broadcasting Act states that media organizations should reflect \"equal rights, the linguistic duality and multicultural and multiracial nature society and the special place of aboriginal peoples within that society\".\n\nThe Canadian television broadcasting industry is split between public and private ownership. Canada currently has 130 originating television stations, which broadcast on 1,456 transmitters across the country, on both the VHF and UHF bands.\n\nIn addition to the public Canadian Broadcasting Corporation/Société Radio-Canada, which operates both English (CBC Television) and French (Ici Radio-Canada Télé) television networks, there are five major private TV networks. CTV, Global, and Citytv broadcast in English, and are available throughout the country. TVA and V broadcast in French and operate over-the-air in French-language markets (including Quebec and parts of Ontario and New Brunswick), although are also available across Canada via pay television. Ici Radio-Canada Télé, TVA and V function in the particular cultural context of Quebec television. Most network stations are owned and operated by the networks themselves, although all networks have some affiliates with different ownership.\n\nIn addition, the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, a service devoted mainly to programming of interest to the Aboriginal peoples of Canada, is considered a network by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, although the network airs terrestrially only in the three Canadian territories, and must be carried by all television providers in the rest of Canada. There are, as well, a number of smaller television systems, such as CTV Two (a compliment to the main CTV network in smaller and secondary markets), and Omni Television a group of Rogers-owned ethnic broadcasters.\n\nSeveral provinces maintain provincial public broadcasting networks in addition to the CBC, including Télé-Québec, TVOntario, TFO, and Knowledge (British Columbia). Citytv Saskatchewan and CTV Two Alberta were formerly provincial public broadcasters (SCN and Access), but both have since been privatized and amalgamated into commercial networks operated by their current owners (Rogers and Bell). While both outlets devote a portion of their schedules to their networks' respective, advertising-supported entertainment programming, both networks are still required to adhere to an educational remit in the majority of their programming. Unlike in the United States, where a statewide public network is usually the state's primary PBS member station, the provincially owned public systems in Canada are independent of each other and have their own programming.\n\nOnly CBC/Radio-Canada, TVA and APTN are officially considered national networks by the CRTC, while V is a provincial network in Quebec. City, CTV and Global are legally considered \"television services\" even though they operate as networks for all practical purposes. As well, there are a few independent stations, including CFTU in Montreal, CJON in St. John's and CJIL in Lethbridge. However, most of these are not general entertainment stations like independent stations in the United States, but are instead specialty community channels or educational services. CJON is the only independent commercial station currently operating in Canada, although CJON sublicenses a mix of programming from Global, CTV and other sources rather than purchasing program rights independently.\n\nTV station callsigns in Canada are usually made up of four letters, although two stations have three call letters (CKX in Brandon and CKY in Winnipeg) and some (primarily CBC-owned Radio-Canada stations) have five. The first call letter is always \"C\", and callsigns of privately owned television stations start with the two-letter combinations of \"CF\", \"CH\", \"CI\", \"CJ\", or \"CK\". The combinations \"CG\", \"CY\", \"CZ\" and several combinations beginning with \"V\" and \"X\" are also assigned to Canada, but to date no Canadian television station has ever been licensed to take a call sign within those ranges. There is no clear rule for the call letters of rebroadcasters—some are labelled by the call-letters of the originating station, followed by a number, while others have their own distinct call letters. Low-power repeater transmitters (LPRTs) have their own unique callsign format, which consists of the letters CH followed by four numbers. Some rebroadcast transmitters are licensed as \"semi-satellites\", which are licensed to air separate commercials (and, on rarer occasions, a limited amount of distinct programming) targeted to their community of license.\n\nCBC-owned stations use call letters beginning with the combination \"CB\" (through a special agreement with the government of Chile); private affiliates of the CBC use the same combinations as other private stations. The CBC has also sometimes directly acquired former private affiliate stations; these usually (although not always) retain their historic call sign rather than changing to a CB call. While Canadian TV stations are technically required to identify themselves over the air by their call letters, the rule is rarely enforced by the CRTC. As a result, most TV stations never use their call letters for any purpose other than official CRTC business, and instead brand under regional names such as CTV Northern Ontario or Global Regina. Even then, most network-owned stations may only use these brands for station identification and newscasts, and promote the majority of their programming under the network brand without any disambiguation.\n\nDue to their proximity to American media markets, a number of Canadian cities and regions receive US broadcasters as part of their local media. This has required special dispensation for Canadian content for broadcasters in the Windsor, Ontario region (due to it falling within the Detroit media footprint), and there has also been a case of a US-based broadcaster (KCND-TV of Pembina, North Dakota, now CKND-DT of Winnipeg) targeting its programming and advertising at Canadian viewers.\n\nAlthough all broadcast networks in Canada are required to produce and air some Canadian content, only the English and French networks of the CBC run predominantly Canadian-produced schedules, though, the English network does run some imported programming (such as \"Coronation Street\" and \"Grand Designs\"). Both CTV and Global have at times faced criticism over their level of commitment to producing and airing Canadian programming. Both networks often find it easier to purchase rights to hit American series than to invest in Canadian productions, which are often prohibitively costly for the comparatively small size of the Canadian market. The French-language networks traditionally have had less difficulty meeting their Canadian content obligations, as the language difference makes Francophone audiences much more readily receptive to home-grown programming than to dubbed American imports.\n\nDigital television is an emerging technology in Canada. Although some TV stations have begun broadcasting digital signals in addition to their regular VHF or UHF broadcasts, this is not yet as widespread as in the United States. Although most markets have digital channel assignments already in place, to date digital broadcasts have only launched in the largest metropolitan areas. Digital television sets are available in Canadian stores, but are not widely owned by consumers at this time.\n\nSeveral broadcasters, including the CBC, have argued that there is no viable business case for a comprehensive digital conversion strategy in Canada. At CRTC hearings in 2007 on the future direction of regulatory policy for television, broadcasters proposed a number of strategies, including funding digital conversion by eliminating restrictions on the amount of advertising that television broadcasters are permitted to air, allowing terrestrial broadcasters to charge cable viewers a subscription fee similar to that already charged by cable specialty channels, permitting license fees similar to those which fund the BBC in the United Kingdom, or eliminating terrestrial television broadcasting entirely and moving to an exclusively cable-based distribution model.\n\nIn May 2007, the CRTC set August 31, 2011 as the deadline for digital conversion in Canada. This is approximately two years later than the cutoff date in the United States. The CRTC ultimately decided to relax restrictions on advertising as the funding mechanism. However, a CRTC statement issued in June 2008 indicated that as of that date, only 22 digital transmitters had been fully installed across the entire country, and expressed the regulator's concern that Canada's television broadcasters were not adequately preparing for the shift to digital broadcasting.\n\nCable television is a very common method of television programming delivery in Canada. Many Canadian cities have cable penetration rates of 90 per cent or more of television households.\n\nThere are currently 739 licensed cable distributors in Canada. This significant decline from over 2000 just a few years ago is attributable both to major cable companies acquiring smaller distributors and to a recent change in CRTC rules by which independent cable operators with fewer than 2,000 subscribers are no longer required to operate under full CRTC licences. (However, the CRTC does retain some regulatory authority over these operators. This is an exemption granted by the CRTC to previously licensed companies that continue to meet certain conditions, and does \"not\" mean that anybody can simply set up their own small cable company without CRTC approval.)\n\nMajor Canadian cable companies include Rogers, Shaw, Cogeco, Vidéotron and EastLink/Persona. Most Canadian cities are served by only one cable company per market; in the few cities that are served by more than one cable company, each company is restricted to a specific geographical division within the market. For instance, in Hamilton, Cogeco Cable, Mountain Cablevision and Source Cable are all licensed operators, but each has a monopoly in a specific area of the city.\n\nHowever, two major companies offer direct broadcast satellite delivery as an alternative to cable: Bell TV, which is a division of BCE Inc., and Shaw Direct, which is a division of Shaw. \"Grey market\" DBS dishes can also be obtained from American services such as DirecTV and Dish Network, but as these are not licensed Canadian providers, stores that sell those packages—and users who buy them—are at risk of criminal charges.\n\nIn some remote communities in the Territories (Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut), cable delivery is prohibitively costly, so similar services are offered through MMDS technology.\n\nA \"basic cable\" package in English Canada traditionally includes:\n\n\nA further set of Canadian and American special interest channels are offered as \"extended cable\" packages, which are available for additional fees. In the past, cable companies have engaged in the controversial practice of negative option billing, in which a subscriber is automatically given and billed for the new services unless he or she specifically declines them, but this is now illegal.\n\nAs well, a package of \"pay TV\" channels is also available for further fees, including movie networks such as The Movie Network, Movie Central, Super Channel and Super Écran, and American superstations such as WSBK, WPIX, WGN and KTLA (which are often affiliated with The CW and MyNetworkTV.) These services, however, require a descrambler box.\n\nA study in 2006 said the CRTC had licensed five ethnic specialty and pay-television services, and 44 digital specialty services across the country.\n\nCable companies now offer digital cable packages in most Canadian cities, including a number of channels which have been licensed exclusively for digital package distribution. Digital cable also typically includes a range of audio broadcast services such as Galaxie and Max Trax. In some markets, digital cable service may also include local radio stations; where this is offered, it has largely \"replaced\" the availability of cable FM service. Digital cable, however, is provided only if a customer chooses to subscribe to that package. As of 2016, cable companies are also now required to offer a \"skinny basic\" option, whereby a small selection of channels typically the main over-the-air networks, along with \"public service\" channels such as The Weather Network and CPAC are packaged for a maximum fee of $25 with additional channels available on a pick and pay basis at the subcriber's discretion. Although this package has had some popularity, the traditional larger and more expensive cable packages remain the dominant subscription mode.\n\nAlthough this is sometimes controversial, Canadian cable companies are required by the CRTC to practise simultaneous substitution when a Canadian channel and a non-Canadian channel (which is usually American) are airing the same program at the same time. Programming on an American service may also be blocked if it has significant bearing on a Canadian legal matter (one episode of \"Law & Order\", inspired by the trials of Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka, was blocked in Canada) or if it interferes with a Canadian channel's broadcast rights (such as James Bond movies airing on Spike TV; the Canadian broadcast rights are held by Bell Media.)\n\nMany cable companies also offer high speed cable Internet service.\n\n\nCanada is served by approximately 2,000 radio stations, on both the AM and FM bands.\n\nAs with television stations, radio callsigns in Canada are made up of four letters beginning with the two-letter combinations of \"CF\", \"CH\", \"CI\", \"CJ\", or \"CK\", although a few stations use three-letter callsigns. In addition to private stations CKX and CKY, some CBC stations have three-letter callsigns, generally in major cities where the stations first aired in the 1930s. Newer CBC stations have normal four-letter callsigns, however. As with CBC television, CBC radio uses callsigns beginning with \"CB\", through a special arrangement with the government of Chile. A few exceptions, such as CKSB in Winnipeg and CJBC in Toronto, exist where the CBC acquired an existing station with a historically significant callsign.\n\nThe combinations \"CG\", \"CY\", \"CZ\" and several combinations beginning with \"V\" and \"X\" are also assigned to Canada. Only four Canadian radio stations, all in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, have taken call signs in those ranges. Three of these stations, VOAR, VOWR and VOCM, began broadcasting before Newfoundland was a Canadian province, and retained their \"VO\" call letters when Newfoundland joined Canadian Confederation in 1949. The other station, VOCM-FM, adopted the callsign in 1981 because of its ownership association with VOCM. With the exception of VOCM-FM, radio stations licensed in Newfoundland after 1949 use the same \"CF\"-\"CK\" range as other Canadian stations.\n\nThe future of \"VO\" callsigns in Canada is unknown. It would not be at all unusual for Industry Canada to simplify all callsigns used in Canada as part of the ongoing modernization and simplification of domestic telecom regulations.\n\nThere is no clear rule for the call letters of repeater stations—some repeaters are labelled by the call-letters of the originating station, followed by a number, while others have their own distinct call letters. Low-power repeater transmitters (LPRTs) have their own unique callsign format, which consists of the letters VE or VF followed by four numbers.\n\nAs of 2014, the four largest major commercial radio broadcast groups in Canada are Newcap Broadcasting, Rogers Communications, Corus Entertainment, and Bell Media. However, many smaller broadcasters operate radio stations as well. Most genres of music are represented on the Canadian commercial radio spectrum, including pop, rock, hip hop, country, jazz and classical. News, sports, talk radio and religious stations are also available in many cities. In addition, many Canadian universities and colleges have licensed campus radio stations, and some communities also have community radio stations or Christian radio stations licensed to non-profit groups or co-operatives. Canada has approximately 14 full-time ethnic radio stations.\n\nAs well, the publicly owned Canadian Broadcasting Corporation operates four national radio networks, two each in English and French. The English Radio One and the French \"Ici Radio-Canada Première\" provide news and information programming to most communities in Canada, regardless of size, on either the AM or FM band. The English CBC Music and French \"Ici Musique\" provide arts and culture programming, including classical music and opera, and are always on FM, generally serving larger communities only.\n\nMusic-based commercial radio stations in Canada are mandated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to reserve at least 35 per cent of their playlists for Canadian content, although exemptions are granted in some border cities (e.g. Windsor, Ontario) where the competition from American stations threatens the survival of Canadian broadcasters, and for stations whose formats may not have enough Canadian recordings available to meet the 35 per cent target (e.g. classical, jazz or pop standards).\n\nIn recent years, a notable trend in Canadian radio has been the gradual abandonment of the AM band, with many AM stations applying for and receiving authorization from the CRTC to convert to the FM band. In some Canadian cities, in fact, the AM band is now either nearly or entirely vacant. Because Canada is more sparsely populated than the United States, the limitations of AM broadcasting (particularly at night, when the AM dial is often overwhelmed by distant signals) have a much more pronounced effect on Canadian broadcasters. AM radio stations have the additional protection that cable companies which offer cable FM services are required by the CRTC to distribute all locally available AM stations through conversion to a cable FM signal, but cable FM only accounts for a small percentage of radio listeners in Canada.\n\nDigital audio broadcasting, or DAB, is an emerging technology in Canada. Although there are currently 73 licensed digital audio broadcasters in Canada, not many consumers yet own digital radios, and the existing digital audio broadcast signals duplicate AM or FM broadcasts. No Canadian radio broadcaster currently offers an exclusively DAB signal.\n\nOn November 1, 2004, the CRTC began hearing applications for satellite radio services. Three applications were filed: one by XM Radio Canada, one by Sirius Canada, and one by the partnership of CHUM Limited and Astral Media. These services, which were approved by the CRTC on June 16, 2005, were Canada's first official satellite radio services, although a small \"grey market\" already existed for American satellite radio receivers. Sirius and XM both launched in December 2005. The CHUM-Astral service, however, was never launched, and its license expired on June 16, 2007; CHUM stated that its business plan was based in part on the expectation that in the interests of Canadian content, the CRTC would have rejected the Sirius and XM applications, approving \"only\" the CHUM-Astral service. The two active services, XM and Sirius, merged into Sirius XM Canada in 2011, several months after a similar merger between their American counterparts.\n\nAlmost all Canadian cities are served by at least one daily newspaper, along with community and neighbourhood weeklies. In large cities which have more than one daily newspaper, usually at least one daily is a tabloid format. Bilingual cities like Montreal and Ottawa have important papers in both French and English.\n\nCanada currently has two major \"national\" newspapers, \"The Globe and Mail\" and the \"National Post\". \"Le Devoir\", though not widely read outside Quebec, is the French-language counterpart to the national newspapers.\n\nThe newspaper with the highest circulation overall is the \"Toronto Star\", while the newspaper with the highest readership per capita is the \"Windsor Star\" (with the \"Calgary Herald\" running a very close second).\n\nCanadian newspapers are mostly owned by large chains. The largest of these is the CanWest News Service chain, owned by CanWest. Quebecor owns many tabloid newspapers through its Sun Media subsidiary, including \"Le Journal de Montréal\" and the \"Toronto Sun\".\n\nAt various times there have been concerns about concentration of newspaper ownership, notably in 1970 and 1980 with two commissions, the Davey Committee on combines and the Kent Royal Commission on Newspapers respectively, and most recently when Conrad Black's Hollinger acquired the Southam newspapers in the late 1990s. When Hollinger sold its Canadian properties, however, many of their smaller-market newspapers were in fact purchased by a variety of new ownership groups such as Osprey Media, increasing the diversity of newspaper ownership for the first time in many years.\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s have seen the emergence of city-based alternative weekly newspapers, geared toward a younger audience with coverage of the arts and alternative news. In recent years, many of these weeklies have also been acquired or driven out of business by conglomerates like Canwest, Quebecor and Brunswick News. Smaller newspapers like \"The Dominion\", publishing primarily online but in a newspaper format, have attempted to fill gaps in Canada's journalistic coverage while avoiding the vulnerabilities of the previous generation of alternative media. Canada has over 250 ethnic newspapers.\n\nIn the 2000s, a number of online news and culture magazines have launched to provide alternative sources of journalism. Some important online publications include \"rabble.ca\", \"The Tyee\", \"The Vancouver Observer\", CBC Radio 3/Bande à part and \"SooToday.com\".\n\nMost of Canada's film (and television) industry produces output geared towards mainstream North American audiences, with Alliance Atlantis and Lions Gate Entertainment in particular enjoying significant successes in recent years. Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver are major production centres, with Vancouver being the second largest film and television production centre in North America (after Los Angeles). The Toronto International Film Festival is considered one of the most important events in North American film, showcasing both Canadian talent and Hollywood films.\n\nAlliance Atlantis has become by far the largest and most successful Canadian film studio, both as a film and television production house (the company's television properties include \"Due South\", \"This Hour Has 22 Minutes\" and \"\"), and as the major Canadian distributor of independent American and international films. Lions Gate Entertainment has also become a major player in recent years.\n\nCanada also produces films of a characteristically \"Canadian\" nature, and of all Canadian cultural industries, this segment of the film industry has the hardest time escaping the shadow of its (North) American counterpart. Between the marketing budgets of mainstream films, and the largely American-controlled film distribution networks, it has been nearly impossible for most distinctively Canadian films to break through to a wide audience. In many Canadian cities, in fact, moviegoers don't even have the \"option\" of seeing such films, as there aren't any theatres showing them. As a result, a Canadian film is usually considered a runaway hit if it makes as little as $1 million at the box office.\n\nFrench Canadian films, on the other hand, are often more successful—as with French-language television, the language difference makes Quebec audiences much more receptive to Canadian-produced film. In many years, the top-grossing Canadian film is a French-language film from Quebec.\n\nAs a result of the economic challenges involved in Canadian film production, film funding is often provided by government bodies such as Telefilm Canada, and CBC television is often a Canadian film's most lucrative potential market. However, there is an established network of film festivals which also provide important marketing and audience opportunities for Canadian films. In addition to Toronto's film festival, the smaller Vancouver International Film Festival features films from around the world, and festivals in Montreal, Quebec and Greater Sudbury, Ontario—among other cities—are also important opportunities for Canadian filmmakers to gain exposure among more populist film audiences.\n\nOne particular film production house, the National Film Board of Canada, has become internationally famous for its animation and documentary production.\n\nCanada's most famous book publisher is McClelland and Stewart, which made its name in the 1970s as the leading publisher of English language Canadian literature. English Canada also has many smaller publishing houses, including Coach House Press, the Porcupine's Quill, House of Anansi, Key Porter Books, Hidden Brook Press, and Douglas & McIntyre. Numerous American and British publishers, including Random House, HarperCollins, Alfred A. Knopf and Penguin Books, also have Canadian divisions.\n\nMajor francophone publishers in Quebec include Bibliothèque québécoise, Alire, Québec-Amérique, Éditions Guérin and Groupe Beauchemin. Several small francophone publishers also operate outside of Quebec, including Éditions Le Nordir and Prise de parole.\n\nCanada's largest English science fiction genre publisher is EDGE Science Fiction and Fantasy Publishing, which now also owns the Tesseract Books imprint, well known for producing excellent Canadian speculative fiction.\n\nMagazines published in Canada include:\n\n\nA notable controversy in Canadian magazine publishing in recent years has been the existence of \"split run\" magazines, where a title published in another country, such as \"TIME\" or \"Sports Illustrated\", is republished in Canada with a few pages of special Canadian content, in order to take advantage of Canadian advertising sales revenues. The government of Canada imposed a special excise tax on split run publications in 1995 to discourage the practice, although this continues to be controversial.\n\n"}
{"id": "15860999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15860999", "title": "Media of Greece", "text": "Media of Greece\n\nThe media of Greece refers to mass media outlets based in the Republic of Greece. Television, magazines, and newspapers are all operated by both state-owned and for-profit corporations which depend on advertising, subscription, and other sales-related revenues. The Constitution of Greece guarantees freedom of speech.\n\nPress freedom sharply eroded in Greece during the economic and financial crisis of 2010–2015, passing from the 35th place in 2009 in Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index to the 99th place in 2014, well below all Western Balkans countries as well as states with repressive media policies such as Gabon, Kuwait or Liberia. Greece is today the EU member state \"where journalism and the media face their most acute crisis\".\nFreedom of expression is guaranteed by the Constitution of Greece since the return to civilian rule in 1975. According to Article 14, everyone may express his thoughts orally, in writing and through the press in compliance with the laws. \nThe same article establishes that the press is free, that censorship and the seizure of publications are forbidden, and that the right to reply to errors is also guaranteed.\nArt.14(9) foresees that media ownership and financing are registered, and prohibits concentration of ownership.\nArt.15 states that “protective provisions for the press are not applicable to films, sound recordings, radio, television or any other similar medium for the transmission of speech or images. Radio and television shall be under the direct control of the state. The control and imposition of administrative sanctions are under the exclusive competence of the NCRTV, which is an independent authority, as specified by law.”.\n\nThe law restricts speech that incites fear, violence and public unrest, as well as publication that are obscene, offending religious belief or calling for violence against the political system. Defamation and insults are crimes punished up to imprisonment.\n\nAccess to information is established by the Constitution, and individual access mechanisms are detailed by a 1999 amendment to the Administrative Procedure Code. Access can be restricted for information concerning national security, criminal investigations, as well as privacy concerns.\n\nThe press is regulated first by Law 1092/1938, which includes obligations to respect privacy and separate news from comments, as well as to publish corrections. The press is deemed to respect different opinion and refrain from inciting mass panic.\n\nThe public service broadcaster Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) is regulated by Law 1730/1987. ERT is mandated to manage and develop state radio and TV, and broadcast the activities of the Greek Parliament. It should aim at reaching as many social groups possible and cover a wide range of topics, to satisfy the public interest.\n\nCommercial radio and TV stations were allowed following Law 1866/1989. The state monopoly was finally abolished with Law 2328/1995, which conditions the granting of licenses by NCRTV for commercial channels to whether they would serve a public interest. Commercial channels have quality requirements to maintain their licences.\nThe same Law 1866/1989 sets limits for media ownership, outlawing cross-ownership among the main newspaper publications. Companies are also limited to owning only one TV station, radio station, or electronic media company.\nThe 2007 “Law of the Basic Shareholder” allows acquisition of shares in other media companies if for a minor quota in the company (beyond the 10 first shareholders) and in the market (not beyond 35% of sector market share).\nForeign companies are also limited to acquire maximum 25% shares in a Greek media company.\n\nSubscription-based radio and television services are regulated by Law 2644/1998. Terrestrial transmissions require a competitive licensing procedure; licenses are granted only to limited companies (S.A.), whose shares must be registered. Satellite transmissions must anyway submit an application to NCRTV. Licenses are limited to ensure pluralism and prevent dominant market positions. Cross-ownership is limited: \"an interested party may only participate in one company that provides subscription-based services using the same means of distribution as well as a second company that uses different means of distribution\". The maximum share that an entity can own in a broadcasting media is of 40%. Further provisions on media ownership are included in Law 3592/2007.\n\nThe Television Without Frontiers (TVWF) directive was transposed in Greece with the Decree 100/2000. The New Audiovisual Media Service Directive (AVMS) has also been transposed by 2009. TV programmes are classified and labelled according to their potential negative influence on minors.\n\nThe state has as traditional strong interventionist role in the media field in Greece, both as a censor (in dictatorship times), an owner (of TV and radio broadcasting channels) and a subsidizer of the media. This has proved feritle ground for patronage politics, with the intertwining of political, economic and sectoral interest, and a culture of self-censorship in journalism.\n\nDeregulation is deemed to have increased the choice menu of viewers, but also to have promoted ownership concentration of press, TV and radio outlets in the hands of few large organisations. At the same time, law in Grek has been ineffective, e.g. in license regulation, leaving the market be dominated by few big interests, which regulatory authorities have proved only superficial and ambivalent in the work.\n\nThe journalists' job in Greece has been heavily affected by the financial crisis of the last years. With the decline in advertising revenues and circulation, many media outlets have scaled down or closed. Strikes for unpaid wages have happened more and more often.\n\nThe NCRTV issues a Code of Journalist Ethics which is regulatory and mandatory for printed press journalists in Greece. \nThe NCRTV also developed a Code of Conduct for News and Other Political Programs, for broadcast media, in consultation with professional bodies (the National Federation of the Reporters' Associations, advertising agencies, and public and private broadcasters), which was ratified by the Presidential Decree 77/2003.\nFinally, the NCRTV issued a Code of Ethics on Broadcasting Advertisement. The NCRTV can issue penalties for non-compliance with its codes, up to halting the operations of the broadcasting station for three months.\n\nOther non-mandatory codes of conduct have been developed by unions and professional organisations. \nIn 1988 the five main journalists' unions ratified a Code of Ethics of Greek journalists. The Union of Owners of Daily Newspapers of Athens (AADNP) and the Union of Owners of Regional Newspapers also co-issued a Code of Ethics.\n\nSelf-regulation in advertising is contained in the Hellenic Advertising Code, agreed upon by the major media and the advertising industry. The Code establishes a two-tier system for hearing complaints, through a Committee for the Control of Advertisements, and a second-level Joint Committee for the Control of Advertisements.\n\nUntil the Greek government closed the company down on 11 June 2013, the state radio and television broadcasting agency was ERT (Elliniki Radiofonia kai Tileorasi - Greek Radio & Television). The station owned 3 national television stations, ET-1, NET (Nea Elliniki Tileorasi) and ET-3 which was based out of Thessaloniki. In January 2006, ERT launched Digital Terrestrial Television with 3 channels. By March 2006, at least 65% of the Greek population was able to view Digital TV for free with the use of set-top boxes. ERT also operated 7 national radio stations, including ERA 5, the Voice of Greece, which broadcast internationally via shortwave. ERT was based in Athens.\n\nAs above, the Greek government announced the closure of ERT on 11 June 2013 with effect from midnight that evening. Since its official closure, employees of ERT have continued broadcasting with their feed being retransmitted online by various websites both inside and outside of Greece notably the CYBC in Cyprus and via the website of the EBU (European Broadcasting Union). The closure of ERT has had political implications in Greece with the smallest party of the Greek coalition government, the Democratic Left withdrawing from government leaving Greece with a New Democracy / PASOK coalition government which has a majority of only three seats.\n\nThe closure of ERT left Greece without a broadcaster with national reach, and deprived the country of a voice that, although seen as promoting the government line and having a state-appointed board, also aired opposition views and employed competent and professional journalists. The end of ERT was deemed to damage pluralism in Greek journalism, as ERT was the only broadcaster legally obliged to air unbiased news. The loss of job security for almost 3,000 permanent and temporary employees was a big blow, forcing professional Greek journalists to accept work under deteriorated conditions in private media.\n\nAfter the closure of ERT, due to its perceived lack of financial transparency, many journalists protested with sit-ins and continued self-managed broadcasts of \"ERT OPEN\", also in regional facilities, until evicted by police forces. Electricity cuts to the ERT HQ in Rhodes led to a transmitter being taking off air and the facility being looted. ERT OPEN survived for one year based on donations from unions and workers.\nAt the end of 2014, many former ERT employees still had not received severance pay, while others had been disqualified from it or had to face severance cuts.\n\nERT was later replaced with NERIT, a media with a smaller budget and staff base (around 500), under the control of the government.\n\nThe first non-pirate private radio station to broadcast in Greece was Athena 98.4 FM, in 1987. Private television began in November 1989 when Mega Channel began operating. Today, over 1,000 radio stations and approximately 150 television stations broadcast in Greece. Digital satellite broadcasting began in 1999 by the South-African conglomerate Naspers which uses the trademark Nova.\n\nThe Broadcasting Media in Greece was deemed considerably free and fair in 2012. Established state-run and commercial TV networks broadcast nationally and compete actively against each other, and hundreds of thousands of viewers subscribe to satellite pay-TV services.Domestically-made variety programmes, comedies and game shows dominate the peak-time TV schedules and are highly popular and widely shown in Greece.\n\nThe last licensing tender for the broadcast media was held in 2002 and licenses have since expired. The government has repeatedly issued one-year extensions, notwithstanding a 2011 decision of the Council of State declaring the practice unconstitutional. Many stations rely on \"certificates of legality\" that are subject to arbitrary revocation.\n\nTV and radio stations operate on the same frequencies as in 1999, notwithstanding interferences from neighbouring countries. Since August 2014, \"news station\" radios can change into \"non-news stations\", but not the other way around, giving rise to risk of insulation of the news station market.\n\nLicensing and regulations constitute strong barriers in the media market, particularly for broadcasting, since purchasing an existing station is the only way to enter the market.\n\nInformation on media ownership is available to the public, but it is often \"veiled\" through holding companies and other little-known legal entities. No ownership information is provided for print or online media.\n\nMedia ownership concentration in Greece is a growing issue, with cross-media ownership also affecting media independence, due to the economic interests of media owners in other sectors of the economy (particularly shipping and telecommunications). The sector is dominated by six large multimedia companies: Antenna Group, Lambrakis Press Group, Pegasus Press Group, Skai Group, Alpha Media Group, and Vardiniogiannis Group.\n\nNotwithstanding the dire financial conditions of many enterprises in the sector, media have been able to secure loans even during bank recapitalisation and selective lending periods. Mega Channel received a 98 million € loan in 2013.\n\nThe placement of state advertising in the media has been pointed as based on political patronage rather than audience size. Political parties also tend to favour favourable media outlets for advertising campaigns (e.g. Syriza's relation with Hot Doc magazine). Th 20% tax on advertising revenues for TV stations, introduced in 2010, has never been collected; TV stations were once again exempted in 2014.\n\nThe main newspapers in Greece are Kathimerini (established 1919, 47,682 copies daily in 2010), To Vima (1922, 44,144 copies in 2010), Ta Nea (1931, 55,014 copies in 2010) and Εleftherotypia (1975, 40,848 copies in 2010).\n\nIn 2010 there were 82 national newspapers in Greece, of which 8 morning editions, 13 evening, 22 Sunday and 16 weekly. Sunday newspapers remained the main format, with 56.2% of sales. Most Sunday readers in 2010 chose Proto Thema and To Vima tis Kyriakis (189,389 and 187,664 copies) followed by Kyriakatiki Eleftherotypia (153,085 copies).\n\n607 regional/local editions also circulated, of which 65 for Attica. The free press was introduced in Greece in 2000 with Metrorama (later Metro), later followed by City Press.\n\nIntroduction of private television in the late 1980s likely led to a decline of newspapers sales throughout the 1990s, from a daily average of 2.6m copies in 1989 to 1.9m in 1992. Most Greek newspapers found themselves in a dire financial situation already in the mid-1990s. The end of the decade brought the system back to stability, with increasing circulation for a pluralistic and critical press, although linked to parties' partisanships. Sunday newspapers brought quality editions to readers. The good period (+26% circulation) went on till around 2005. The 2005–2010 years brought the Greek press back in the state of the early 1990s.\n\nThe press market in Greece shows a strong concentration of ownership among few publishers: Lambrakis Press S.A., Pegasus Publishing and Printing S.A (Bobolas Publishing Group), Tegopoulos Publishing S.A (Tegopoulos Publishing Group), Kathimerini Publications S.A. (Alafouzos Publishing Group) and Acropolis (Apogevmatini Publishing Group).\n\nInterest- and sector-based magazines also have a strong market in Greece, with around 174 magazines in 2010; glossy publications have to compete with Sunday supplements of newspapers, including popular issues such as To Vima's Vimagazino.\n\nThe print sector has shrunk recently, due to the fallout of the financial crisis. Circulation figures have fallen, and many outlets were forced to shut down, due to reduced advertisement revenues. This has also affected employment, with journalists driven to accept lower work conditions and to resort to self-censorship to preserve job security.\n\nMajor public and private publications show strong partisan bias. The relations between media owners and political (and governmental) officers have a cooling effect on the presence of critical commentaries in the press.\n\nExamples of new models of journalism include the Editors' Newspaper (\"EfSyn\"), the magazine \"Unfollow\" and the online \"Press Project\".\nOnline news portals include in.gr, TV Without Borders, and The Press Project. Internet has grown in prominence, yet it also has been indicated as a source of low-quality journalism and dependence on big-firm advertisement.\n\nThe Greek publishing industry mainly features small and medium enterprises, often family-based, and mostly founded after the democratisation in 1974, with very little agglomeration among them.\nPublishing companies active on the Greek market were 374 in 1990 and grew to 841 in 2008. Most of them were based in Athens (82%), 11% in Thessaloniki, and only 7% elsewhere. The market is quite concentrated: 23% of companies published 81% of books in 2008. \nOnly one publishing company is listed at the Athens Stock Exchange. Most of the production is outsourced. Book selling is done through networks of small and medium distributors, selling different publishers' books through companies salespeople. Book prices are set by the publishers, and since 1998 retailers are compelled by law not to sell at more than 10% discount for the first two years, nor to add more than a 5% surcharge. Average paperback book prices reached 17,00 euros in 2007/2008. VAT on books is of 4.5%, compared to 9% and 19% on other products.\n\nThe publishing industry doubled the number of published titles in the 1990s, arriving at a total sale in 2004 of 569.7 million euros. Since then, the market came at an approximate number of 9,500 new titles yearly in 2005–08, of which around 2,000 in humanities and social sciences. These numbers have shrunk since the financial crisis.\n\nThe 10 leading Greek publishing companies in 2008 included Patakis (346 titles), Modern Times (343 titles), Lambrakis Press (268 titles), Minoas (211 titles), Metaichmio (204 titles), Livanis (193 titles), Savalas (191 titles), Kastaniotis (185 titles), Kedros (180 titles), and Psichogios (146 titles). Other important Greek publishing companies are Ellinika Grammata (2007: 295 titles) and A.N. Sakkoulas (2007: 226 titles)\n\nBookshops in Greece are more than 2,000, with 3,500 other sales outlets, including magazine retailers and supermarkets. Most of them are in Athens (50%) and in other major centres. The major chainstores are Papasotiriou, Eleftheroudakis, Ianos, Protoporia, Kosmos-Floras, Leader Books, Hellenic Distribution Agency / Newsstand, Fnac, Public.\n\nThe Greek Federation of Publishers and Booksellers is member of the International Publishers Association (IPA), the Federation of European Publishers (FEP) and the European Booksellers Federation (EBF).\n\nThe main book fair in the country is the International Thessaloniki Book Fair, held every year in April or May and open to the public. It is organised by the NationalBook Centre of Greece in cooperation with HELEXPO S.A., the Hellenic Federation of Publishers and Booksellers, and the city of Thessaloniki, and has the Greek ministry of culture as its patron.\n\nThe use of radio is widespread in Greece, with 5.02 million receivers in 1997. The public service broadcaster ERT owns five radio stations: Second Programme, ERA-3, NET Radio, ERA Sport, KOSMOS.\n\nAthena 9.84 FM was in 1987 the first non-pirate private radio station in Greece, aired by the Municipality of Athens. In 2010 there were around 1,000 radio stations (56 in Attica) mostly private and with local coverage. 90% of them did not hold an official license, but could be deemed eligible for one. Around 60 Athens radio had been shut down in 2001, allegedly for interfering with frequencies used by the new Athens International Airport, but most of them re-opened in 2002-2005. The licensing process remains inconsistent.\n\nThe main channels were the music stations Skai Radio (owned by Alafouzos Publishing Company) with 10.8% and Rythmos (8.4%); the main sports station was Nova Sport FM (7.1%).\n\nThe International Hellenic Radio Network, managed by ERT, broadcasts Greek radio abroad. Radio programmes in other languages than Greek are foreseen by e.g. Athens 9.84 and Skai Radio.\n\nA 2007 law requires radio stations to use the Greek language as the main language, as well as to have certain funds in reserve and to employ a minimum number of full-time employees. This creates a disproportionate burden for smaller and municipality-owned radio stations; there is no separate provision for community-based radios, and several student-run radios were subject to attempts by authorities to shut them down in 2014.\nThe 2007 law also allows those radio stations affiliated to political parties represented in the Hellenic Parliament to broadcast without a license. This was extended in 2013 by a NCRTV decision to Art TV, owned by LAOS, that only had European Parliament representation. Art TV remained on air also after LAOS lost European Parliament representation at the 2014 elections.\nSince August 2014, \"news station\" radios can change into \"non-news stations\", but not the other way around, giving rise to risk of insulation of the news station market.\nRising utility costs and prohibitive music licensing fees led to many radio stations facing large unpaid debts by the end of 2014.\n\nTelevision broadcasting in Greece was officially allowed in 1951. Broadcasts started in 1966.\n\nTelevision was the main means of information for most Greek citizens in 2010, with 3.7 million households with a TV set. The market was de-regulated in 1989 with the end of state monopoly and the creation of private television stations, that now dominate the market.\n\nThe public service broadcasters are ERT and Vouli TV (dedicated to Parliament debates). Eight national TV stations are licensed: 902 Aristera sta FM, Alpha TV, Alter Channel, ANT1, Mega Channel, Skai TV, Star Channel, Makedonia TV. The three licensed local/regional TVs are Tileasti, Tiletora and the Municipal Channel of Thessaloniki. Other 123 had applied for a license in 2010.\n\nSatellite broadcasting channels include the public ERT-World and Vouli TV and the private Antenna-Sat, Mega Cosmos, Alpha Without Frontiers, Star International, Teleasty, Alter Globe, Channel 10, Mad International and Extra 3. Foreign satellite channels are broadcast by ERT for free, including CNN International, Cyprus Sat, RIK 1. The Hellas-Sat 2 satellites allows to re-broadcast programmes to Europe, the Middle East and South Africa.\n\nIn 2010, the TV market was led by Mega Channel (22.1 percent audience) and Antenna (16.8%), followed by Alpha TV (15.1 percent) and Star (11.4 percent). Public channels have lower viewerships (NET 10.09 percent, ET-3 4 percent and ET-1 3.7 percent). Advertisers likewise favour private channels.\n\nPay-TV was introduced by Multichoice Hellas with its NOVA bouquet of satellite channels. Poor infrastructure has kept back the development of cable TV (below 1% penetration). Until 1998, only public service broadcasters could lay and operate cable infrastructure. At 8.9%, Greece had the lowest EU rate of cable and satellite TV penetration in 2010.\n\nIn 2013 the company Digea (co-owned by Greece's main private TV network) won the tender for a nationwide license to operate Greece's digital television transmitters, also due to the closure of the possible competitor, the public broadcaster ERT. The tender, which was reported as \"heavily tailored\", created a new monopoly, since Digea is able to collect monthly fees from all TV stations wishing to broadcast digitally, despite a law prohibiting a network provider from being a content provider too.\n\nOn September 2, 2016, four national television licenses were auctioned in Greece in a highly unusual competitive bidding process. The licenses were bought by ANT1 TV (Thodoris Kyriakou) for €75.9m, Alter Ego (Evangelos Marinakis) for €73.9m, Ioannis-Vladimiros Kalogritsas for 52.6m and SKAI TV (Iannis Alafouzos) for €43.6m.\n\n\nCinema first appeared in Greece in 1896 but the first actual cine-theatre was opened in 1907. In 1914 the \"Asty Films Company\" was founded and the production of long films begun. \"Golfo\" (Γκόλφω), a well known traditional love story, is the first Greek long movie, although there were several minor productions such as newscasts before this. In 1931, Orestis Laskos directed \"Daphnis and Chloe\" (\"Δάφνις και Χλόη\"), contained the first nude scene in the history of European cinema; it was also the first Greek movie which was played abroad. In 1944 Katina Paxinou was honoured with the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\".\n\nThe 1950s and early 1960s are considered by many as the Greek Golden age of Cinema. Directors and actors of this era were recognized as important historical figures in Greece and some gained international acclaim: Mihalis Kakogiannis, Alekos Sakellarios, Melina Mercouri, Nikos Tsiforos, Iakovos Kambanelis, Katina Paxinou, Nikos Koundouros, Ellie Lambeti, Irene Papas etc. More than sixty films per year were made, with the majority having film noir elements. Notable films were \"Η κάλπικη λίρα\" (1955 directed by Giorgos Tzavellas), \"Πικρό Ψωμί\" (1951, directed by Grigoris Grigoriou), \"O Drakos\" (1956 directed by Nikos Koundouros), \"Stella\" (1955 directed by Cacoyannis and written by Kampanellis). Cacoyannis also directed \"Zorba the Greek\" with Anthony Quinn which received Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film nominations. Finos Film also contributed to this period with movies such as \"Λατέρνα, Φτώχεια και Φιλότιμο\", \"Η Θεία από το Σικάγο\", \"Το ξύλο βγήκε από τον Παράδεισο\" and many more. During the 1970s and 1980s Theo Angelopoulos directed a series of notable and appreciated movies. His film \"Eternity and a Day\" won the Palme d'Or and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThere were also internationally renowned filmmakers in the Greek diaspora such as the Greek-American Elia Kazan.\n\nThe Greek Film Centre recorded 13 fiction films and 14 documentaries shot in Greece in 2008. \nIn 2007, 274 cinemas were registered in Greece, and in 2008 38.5 percent of Greeks went to cinema at least once.\n\nThe telecommunications and postal services market in Greece is regulated by the Hellenic Telecommunications and Post Commission (EETT), which issing official licences to service providers.\n\nOTE, the former state monopoly until 1994, is the main player in fixed line telephony. Since the liberalization of the telecommunications market, OTE has been slowly losing market share to competing telecom operators, such as hellas online, Wind, Cyta, Forthnet and Tilefonia. As of 2005, OTE's share on the market hovered around 76%. Land lines in use were 6,348,800 in 2004.\n\nGreece has three mobile telecom companies; Cosmote (state-owned), Vodafone, WIND and CYTA. Active mobile lines were 20,285,000 in September 2009, which means 180% penetration.\n\nGreece owns one telecommunications satellite, named Hellas-sat, which provides telecommunication services in a major part of Eastern Europe and Western Asia.\n\nThe Internet in Greece relied on PSTN/ISDN modem dial-up from 1990 until 2003, when ADSL was commercially launched by incumbent operator OTE. ADSL2+ and VDSL2 is currently the main broadband standard. Greece also has 3G and 4G+ mobile broadband (HSPA) and a more expensive Satellite Internet access.\nGreece has an extensive fiber optic network throughout the country.\n\n63% of the Greek population regularly accessed the internet in 2014.\n\nGreece's public news agency is the Athens-Macedonian News Agency (AMNA), created in 2006 by the merger of Athens News Agency (ANA, est. 1895) with the Macedonian News Agency (MPA, est. 1991). In 2010 AMNA had 250 employees, of which 180 journalists, and it publishes items in Greek, English and French. Other news agencies include regional ones (Cretian News Agency, Aegean News), sport-focused (Sport Idea, Action image), religion (The Religious News Network), agriculture (Agronews Agency), Greek diaspora (Hellenic World, Greek American news agency, Diaspora News Agency etc.), photography (Inke photography agency, EPA photography agency).\n\nTrade unions among journalists are widespread in Greece and organised on a regional base. They include the Union of Journalists of Daily Newspapers of Athens, the Union of Journalists of Daily Newspapers of Macedonia-Thrace; the Union of Journalists of Daily Newspapers of Peloponissos, Epirus and Islands; the Union of Journalists of Daily Newspapers of Thessaly, Sterea, Evia; and the Union of Journalists of Periodical Press. \nThe Pan Hellenic Confederation of Associations of ERT Personnel represents the public service broadcaster's employees.\n\nMedia employers' associations include the Association of Athens Daily Newspaper Publishers, the Association of Daily Provincial Newspaper Publishers, the Association of Regional TV Channels, the Union of Owners of Athenian Private Radio Stations.\n\nOther major industry organisations include: The National Private TV Channels Association, the Hellenic Association of Radio Owners, the Hellenic Radio Technicians Association, the Greek Association of Film Critics and the Association of Greek Film Producers – Directors.\n\nThe main regulatory authority in Greece is the General Secretariat of Information – Communication (formerly the Ministry of Press & Mass Media), which fomulates policy and supervises the implementation of legislation in the media sector.\n\nThe Greek National Council for Radio and Television (ESR/NCRTV), founded in 1989, is the independent supervisory and regulatory administrative authority of the radio and television market. It consists of seven members – a President, a Vice President and five members, which are all appointed by the Greek Parliament.\nThe NCRTV is the main regulator for private and public broadcast media, established by the Law 1866/1989 as an independent authority whose action is only subordinated to the courts. It grants licenses to private radios and TV, and ensures the respect of the law by license-holders. It can impose penalties, up to suspending or cancelling licenses.\nThe last licensing tender was held in 2002 and licenses have since expired. The government has repeatedly issued one-year extensions, notwithstanding a 2011 decision of the Council of State declaring the practice unconstitutional. Many stations rely on \"certificates of legality\" that are subject to arbitrary revocation.\nThe terms of several NCRTV members, included its President, expired in 2012, but they have remained in their position despite the Council of State's 2013 declaration of unconstitutionality of the status quo.\nThe NCRTV has been accused of lacking impartiality and of uneven implementation of regulations and penalties, based on political affiliations of media outlets.\n\nThe TV Audience Research Control Committee (TV ARCC) is the audience measurement authority. It includes representatives from the Union of Hellenic Advertisers, the Union of Hellenic Advertising Agencies, the public broadcaster (ERT), the major commercial broadcasters and the Association of Hellenic Market and Opinion Research Companies.\n\nThe Assembly of Viewers and Listeners (ASKE) has a consultative role on TV programming and advertising.\n\nThe Hellenic Telecommunications and Post Commission (EETT) is the main authority in the telecommunication and postal services field.\n\nThe Ministry of Culture is the responsible body for regulating the cinema sector, in collaboration with the Greek Film Centre, aiming to ensure “the protection, support and development of the art of film in Greece” and “the presentation, promulgation and promotion of Greek films both at home and abroad.”\n\nOther independent regulatory bodies include the Hellenic Authority for Communication Security and Privacy (ADAE), and the Hellenic Data Protection Authority.\n\nThe Greek Self-Regulating Organisation for Internet Content, or Safenet, is a no profit organisation founded in 1999 by the three main Greek ISPs, together with the Greek National Research Network, the Greek Association of Internet Users and a large Greek Consumers Association (Ekpizo). Safenet aims to promote internet self-regulation to combat illegal and offensive Web content, as well as raising awareness about it.\n\nIn Greece, level of media concentration is high. It affects both the print and broadcasting sectors and has increased in last decades together with the emergence of cross-ownership problems. The interdependence between political and media elites is considered among the major factors leading to ineffective and contradictory media policies and poor implementation of anti-corruption rules.\n\nThe Greek media landscape changed significantly after the deregulation process affecting the broadcasting sector in the late 1980s. Until the 1980s, the media landscape was dominated by the monopoly of public broadcaster (ERT) while private owners of publishing firms had their business activities limited to this sector (i.e. newspaper, periodical printing and publishing). Tis situation changed in the 1980s with the entrance in the media market of new investors and big industrials and led to a transformation of ownership patterns. During this transition, the owners of some renowned newspapers (\"Akropolis\", \"Khatimerini\", etc.), unable to implement modernization programs were forced to sell their activities. At the same time, new editorial projects were launched by entrepreneurs whose activities extended also in other sectors. This process went together with the increase of business opportunities in the information sector.\n\nThe process of deregulation of broadcasting and radio sectors happened in a legal void which provided opportunities to media owners to grab television and radio frequencies and to initiate broadcasting without licenses.\n\nMedia market concentration in terms of market concentration was a consequence of the diversification of newspaper publishers in the field of television, which happened in a poorly regulated and hardly transparent media environment. Private TV expanded rapidly, without embracing a pluralistic profile.\n\nThe internet and digital information services have become more increasingly relevant in the Greek media landscape, in particular among young people. This, in principle, offered the potentials for more pluralism in the news offer and variety, yet, such services have often offered low-quality information, gossip, copy-and-paste news and dependence on big firms for advertisements. However, despite these problems, Internet is beginning to host also alternative voices, independent and quality journalism.\n\nThe re-opening of the Greek public broadcaster, the ERT SA in 2015, after a two-year closure, was considered a positive step towards pluralism.\n\nIn Greece, the \"levels of concentration of media ownership and cross-media concentration are high\". The main reason for is lies in the diversification and deregulation process which led several newspaper groups to invest in electronic media. This happened in a poorly regulated media environment.\n\nAs for the print sector, the three largest press groups - Lambrakis Press SA (DOL), Tegopoulos Publishing, and Pegasus SA (Bobolas family) - are also shareholders in the main terrestrial channel MEGA. Press Institution SA holds shares in terrestrial channel STAR, and the Alafouzos family owns terrestrial channel SKAI and several radio stations. The rise of the Internet has added a concentration problem as the highest-visited websites include those of the mainstream publishing groups like DOL, Pegasus and also MEGA chennel. In the last decade, the problem of media concentration worsened significantly., as demonstrated by the following data: in 2008 the four leading publishing house controlled 69.7% of the market compared to 57.3% in 2000, 62.9% in 1995 and 59% in 1990. The publishers of such outlets adopted a diversification strategy, leading to investment into other different sectors and industries.\n\nAs for the broadcasting sector, after the deregulation process of the late 1980s, the number of private television stations increased significantly. However, despite the large number of media outlets, the media scene is dominated by five private channels (MEGA, Ant1, Alpha, Star and Alter) belonging to conglomerates with activities also in other sectors.\n\nConcerning the regulation of media concentration, the relevant law, i.e. Law 2328/1995 did not prevent high levels of concentration, whereas the more recent Law 3592/2007 named \"New Act on concentration and Licensing of Media Undertakings\" provided more opportunities for deregulation and market liberalisation by abolishing some older regulations. A 2014 amendment to the above Law further relaxed ownership and cross-media ownership requirements by allowing partnerships between electronic media businesses of the same type (television, online, or radio) if this results in a cut of operating costs (through economies of scale or joint utilization of financial resources). This is an indicator of the government's intention to create large media conglomerates for economic viability.\n\nAnother problem affecting the Greek media system is cross-ownership. Anti-concentration rules and restrictions were never enforced. According to some experts, governments preferred to satisfy the interest of media owners aspiring to boost their position and power in the media communication landscape emerged after the dismissal of state monopoly, instead of regulating the system. Furthermore, political instability in the years 1989-1990 created the conditions for media owners to exercise pressure on the government. This led to the creation of a powerful oligopoly, constructed around a small number of media corporations owning national dailies, radio and TV stations, several magazines and publishing houses and involved also in the fields of new media, telecommunications and culture.\n\nThe problem of cross-ownership, as well as media concentration and instrumentalization of the media have become highly important in Greece to the point to dominate the public and political debate in the country.\n\nTransparency of media ownership refers to the public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures. A legal regime guaranteeing transparency of media ownership makes possible for the public as well as for media authorities to find out who effectively owns, controls and influences the media as well as media influence on political parties or state bodies.\n\nThe Greek Constitution, under Article No. 14 (9), affirms the importance of transparency and pluralism in the media sector. Also, the Constitution affirms that the law \"may specify that the means of financing newspapers and periodicals should be disclosed\" In recent years a number of measures have been undertaken to increase transparency of the media. For instance, the Secretariat-General of Mass Media, a governmental body, monitors the allocation of state subsidies and other support measures addressed to the media, including public sector advertising and press distribution and telecommunications subsidies. Specifically, the Secretariat makes public through its website: approved programs and accounts of the advertising expenditure of public bodies; data on procurement of all services related to the supply of goods and services; information on government grants to the press; names of staff employed at the Secretariat for each directorates and departments. However, such information is not always comprehensive and updated.\n\nAs for electronic media, the broadcast regulator, namely the National Council on Radio and Television (NCRTV) makes public all radio and TV’s licenses through its website. The information published includes the name of the company, contact details, and the scope of the media outlet’s territorial coverage. However, a comprehensive legislative framework for transparency of online media has not been established yet. The regulator is also responsible for collecting and keeping records and shareholders information on media outlets and media-related enterprises, such as press agencies, advertising, etc. All these data are publicly available and accessible to the public.\n\nArticle 6 of the Presidential Decree 109/2010 which incorporated the EU Audio-visual Media Services Directive sets forth rules for enhancing transparency in the audiovisual sector by obliging providers to make public information such as company name, address, contact details, etc. Also, press enterprises are required to disclose the names of their owners, publisher and managers in their editions. In order to obtain the license to broadcast, radio and TV stations must submit to the NCRT a declaration on their shareholdings. Any transfer of ownership above 1% of the capital of a TV or radio station has to be notified to, and approved by, the NCRT. The role of owner, partner, main shareholder or management executive of a media outlet is not compatible with the role of owner, partner, main shareholder or management executive of an enterprise working for the public sector.\n\nMoreover, there is no independent financial supervision of the public-service broadcasters. Their financial status is problematic.\n\nThe principle of transparency in all areas of public life, including media, is expected to be enhanced given that there is an Action Plan Promoting Open Government since 2014 (Greek Action Plan 2014-16). Technical and institutional changes have been adopted to enhance the principle of transparency and these should lead to the enhancement of the functionality of the DIAVGEIA project (Transparency Program Initiative), to the publication of public procurements and to the open, transparent and secure exchange of public documents. The DIAVGEIA project began on October 1, 2010. Under this Transparency Program Initiative, all government institutions are obliged to upload their acts and decisions on the Internet with special attention to issues of national security and sensitive personal data. Each document is digitally signed and assigned a unique Internet Uploading Number (IUN) certifying that the decision has been uploaded at the “Transparency Portal”. Following the latest legislative initiative (Law 4210/2013) of the Ministry of Administrative Reform and e-Governance, administrative acts and decisions are not valid unless published online.\n\nThe Greek Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, under Article 14. Independent media are active and express a wide variety of views. The law permits any prosecutor to order the seizure of publications that insult the president, offend any religion, contain obscenity, advocate for the violent overthrow of the political system, or disclose military secrets. The law provides criminal penalties for defamation, however, in most criminal defamation cases, authorities released defendants on bail pending trial and they served no time in jail. Both the Greek Constitution and Greek legislation prohibit arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence. However, NGOs such as the Greek Helsinki Monitor report that authorities do not always respect these provisions in practice.\n\nPress freedom sharply eroded in Greece during the economic and financial crisis of 2010-2015, passing from the 35th place in 2009 in Reporters Without Borders World Press Freedom Index to the 99th place in 2014, well below all Western Balkans countries as well as states with repressive media policies such as Gabon, Kuwait or Liberia. Greece is ranked in the 88th place in the 2017 World Press Freedom Index of Reporters Without Borders. Greece is today the EU member state \"where journalism and the media face their most acute crisis\".\n\nThe crisis has laid bare the unsustainability of Greek media, and the dependence of media owners on state support in terms of tax breaks and public advertisement revenues, and reciprocating by publishing favourable stories, in a self-censorship mode. When public funds dried up, media went bankrupt, while the government resorted to more open tactics of media manipulation via coercion, censorship, and shutdowns. Lack of job security for journalists have driven them to self-censorship too, limiting themselves to stories understood to be acceptable to owners and politicians.\n\nDefamation, insult and slander are criminalized in Greece, respectively under Articles 361-364 of the Greek Criminal Code. Notably, defamation of a corporation is provided by the latter provision. Prosecutions under these provisions can only be initiated upon complaint, but may be conducted ex officio when the offended party is a public official.\n\nDefaming the Head of the State is a crime under art. No. 168 of the Criminal Code; moreover, the Constitution permits seizures of publications offending the Head of the State. Malicious blasphemy is a criminal offence under Art. 198 of the Criminal Code, as well as publicly reviling the Eastern Orthodox Church of Christ or any other religion tolerated in Greece (Article No. 199). The Greek Constitution allows the seizure of publications insulting religions, too.\n\nOn December 22, 2015, the Press Law was amended, specifically the so-called “press killer” provisions regarding civil defamation. In the past, such provisions led, among other things, to non-proportionate fees against media outlets and to a consequent climate of self- censorship. The president of the Panhellenic Federation of Journalists’ Unions (POESY) noticed that “huge amounts that the plaintiffs were asking from the journalists were aiming to terrorise them, impose censorship and hinder a free and democratic dialogue on contemporary political issues”.\n\nIn the last years several instances have been reported in which either extremists or security forces have attacked journalist while they were covering newsworthy events. Impunity is too often the norm. The inappropriate use of violence by police forces against journalists has been attributed both to a strategy of silencing and to the lack of competence of police about how to deal with city riots.\nAccording to the Hellenic Photojournalists' Union (EFE), only 1 out of 16 incidents of police attacks against photojournalists between 2010 and 2014 resulted in legal consequences. In a 2016 statement, reporters Without Borders condemned impunity for police violence against journalists.\n\nMoreover, the organization advocating for free expression Index on Censorship reports of increasing dangers for journalists reporting on the refugee crisis in Greece.\n\nIndex on Censorship curates the Mapping Media Freedom project- a database identifying threats, violations and limitations faced by members of the press throughout European Union member states, candidates for entry and neighbouring countries- where threats on Greek journalists and foreign journalists in Greece are regularly monitored.\n\nReporters Without Borders signaled negatively the attempt to meddle in DOL, one of Greece's most prominent newspaper groups, by appointing a former SYRIZA MP in charge for its rescue.\n\nPolitical interferences in the media sphere in Greece often happen through judicial ruling, themselves deemed to be politically motivated or influenced. In May 2014 the Council of State declared the constitutionality of ERT 2013 closure, notwithstanding procedural irregularities. Lower courts' rulings invalidating dismissals were not enforced by the government in 2014.\n\nPolitical influence in the Greek media has been on the rise in 2014. The set-up of ERT's successor, NERIT, was marked by scandals and irregularities, including the undue involvement of the Ministr of State. An August 2014 law stripped NERIT of its administrative independence and entrusted the government with the power to name its supervisory body, which in turn selects the public broadcaster's president. This was deprecated by the European Broadcasting Union, resulting in complications in NERIT's membership application.\n\nNERIT has been accused repeatedly of political bias, including after blocking the airing of Syriza opposition leader Alexis Tsipras at the Thessaloniki International Fair, while giving ample space to Antonis Samaras' campaign. Several NERIT officials later resigned, citing widespread governmental interference. Hiring scandals and preferential legal treatment from the authorities complete the framework.\n\nAudience shares of NERIT never approached those of ERT, being limited to 5% of viewers. According to former ERT employee Nicos Tsibidas, this left Greece with \"a stern state broadcaster\", controlled by the government, and \"private media oligarchs\".\n\nPrivate channels also presented partisan bias, particularly pro-governmental. ANT1 TV featured reports warning citizens about the negative consequences of not voting for the governmental coalition.\n\n\nPoliticians and other actors launched several proceedings and lawsuits against journalists and media workers, especially after the beginning of the Greek economic and financial crisis and using defamation charges. \n\nThere are no government restrictions on access to the Internet or reports that the government monitors e-mail or Internet chat rooms without appropriate legal authority.\n\n\nOn January 16, 2014, the creator of the original \"Elder Pastitsios\" website was found guilty of \"repeatedly insulting religion\" and was sentenced to ten months in jail, suspended while the prosecutor had recommended a smaller sentence.\n\n"}

Sano remained as a sound director for the second game, and his music was used as a reference for the third. Multiple albums have been released for the music of the series: \"Drag-On Dragoon Original Soundtrack Vol.1\" and \"Vol.2\" were released on October and November 2004, while a two-disc re-release titled \"Drag-On Dragoon Original Soundtrack\" was released in April 2011. The \"Drag-On Dragoon 2 Original Soundtrack\" was released on July 20, 2005. A promotional disc with two tracks from the soundtrack was released in the same year. The official soundtrack for the third game, \"Drag-On Dragoon 3 Original Soundtrack\", was released January 21, 2014. An compilation of chiptune remixes of the previous games and \"Nier\", \"Drag-On Dragoon Chips Music\", was released on December 19, 2013 as part of the \"Drag-On Dragoon 10 Anniversary Box\".\n\nThe series has also received theme songs from multiple Japanese pop artists, all of which have been released as singles. A re-orchestration of Mika Nakashima's single \"Hitori\" was used as the theme for \"Drakengard 2\", incorporating elements from the game. Two theme songs were written for \"Drakengard 3\": \"Kuroi Uta\" and \"This Silence is Mine\". The former was sung by Eir Aoi, a fan of the series, and written by \"Nier\" writer Kikuchi Hana. The latter was specially written and sung by Onitsuka Chihiro, who created the song around the themes and characters of the game. Both songs were composed by Okabe. All three singles have been in the top 40 best-selling singles in the Japanese Oricon music charts.\n\nThe soundtracks have received mixed to positive reviews from both dedicated video game music outlets and video game critics. The first game was noted for its disturbing style, which both drew criticism for repetitiveness and praise for suiting the game's atmosphere. It has been generally cited as an experimental soundtrack. The second game's soundtrack received a more positive reception, with the general opinion being that it was a more traditional and consequently more comfortable soundtrack. The third game's soundtrack also received fairly positive comments, mainly praising its quality, although critiques were made concerning its variety. The chiptune compilation was generally liked, except for its exclusivity to the special release. The singles have also received praise.\n\nThe music of the first game in the \"Drakengard\" series was composed by Nobuyoshi Sano and Takayuki Aihara. In creating the score, they sampled excerpts from pieces of classical music (selected by Aihara), then rearranged, remixed and layered them in various ways. Their main objective was to create music that emulated the game's hack-and-slash gameplay, as well as the dark story and general narrative theme of \"madness\". The music was intended to be \"experimental\" and \"expressionistic\" rather than \"commercial\". After being composed, all the tracks were performed by a full orchestra. The team who worked on the music also worked on the \"Tekken\" series, and they sought to emulate the music of Northern Europe. One of the soundtracks that inspired Sano and Aihara in their work was the score for \"The Exorcist\". The theme song, , was composed by Sano, written by the game's scenario writer Sawako Natori and sung by Eriko Hatsune.\n\n\"Drakengard 2\"s soundtrack was composed by Ryoki Matsumoto and Aoi Yoshiki, with supervision by Sano, who acted as sound director. The CGI cutscenes were scored by Masashi Yano. Due to widespread criticisms of his work on the first game, Sano was asked by the game's producer, Takamasa Shiba, to bring in outside help for the second game's soundtrack, which upset Sano to a degree. Shiba wanted a composer less linked to video games to compose the music: Matsumoto was brought in because of his work on the non-video-game J-pop songs \"Yuki no Hana\" and \"Tsuki no Shizuku\". Because of the size of the project, Matsumoto in turn brought in his friend Yoshiki to help. The soundtrack was designed a fusion of J-pop and video game music, and to evoke the emotions of the various characters and the feeling of battle. The theme song for the game's English release was \"Growing Wings\", a localized version of the first game's theme song sung by Kari Wahlgren.\n\nThe third game's music was composed by Keiichi Okabe, who also created the score for \"Nier\", a spin-off game of the series. While writing the music, Okabe felt he needed to match Sano's work on \"Drakengard\", rather than copy it, and so felt that there was no need to \"rehash\" the original music despite the potential merits. He commented that the musical creation was \"a tough production, but for this game, there's part of it I'm doing that I've never experienced before.\" At director Taro Yoko's request, Okabe worked on separating the style of the music from that of \"Nier\": he did this by including both soft, gentle tunes similar to \"Nier\" and more intense tracks. The two styles were also inspired by the game's world theme of \"the sense of contrast\". One musical piece, \"Exhausted 3\", is a re-orchestration of \"Drakengard\"s theme song, intended by Okabe as a nod to earlier installments while staying true to Yoko's wishes.\n\nMusic from \"Drag-on Dragoon\" has been released in several albums. The soundtrack was originally released in two volumes under the names \"Drag-On Dragoon Original Soundtrack Vol.1\" and \"Vol.2\", released on October 22 and November 21, 2003 respectively. The soundtrack was re-released on April 20, 2011 as a two-disc set under the title \"Drag-On Dragoon Original Soundtrack\". The re-release reached #57 in the Japanese Oricon music charts and remained in the charts for two weeks.\n\nThe individual albums received a mixed response from critics. The reviewer for \"RPGFan\" was weakly positive about the first album, calling it \"extremely experimental\" and stating that people needed to be open-minded while listening, while also citing it as better than the soundtrack for \"\". The reviewer echoed most of these sentiments for the second album, while also stating that it contained the better musical pieces from the game of the two albums. Luc Nadeau of \"Game Music Online\", who reviewed all three releases of the soundtrack, was mixed to positive in his opinions. He generally liked the music, but noted, like the \"RPGFan\" reviewer, that it was highly experimental and would not be to everyone's taste. He also cited his preference for the 2011 two-disc re-release over the original albums. Reviewing the re-release, Jayson Napolitano of \"Original Sound Version\" called it \"one of the most experimental and disturbing soundtracks I've heard in a while\". He praised the soundtrack despite not finding it memorable, and commented that he found it more appealing when he knew some of the plot details that were censored in the game's western release.\n\nReviewers of the game itself also noted the soundtrack. Greg Kasavin of \"GameSpot\" mentioned it as the most distinctive aspect of the game, stating that it was \"the most nerve-racking and most intense aspect of [\"Drakengard\"]\". Adam Jarvis of \"VideoGamer.com\" was also positive, calling the soundtrack \"haunting\" and saying that it \"helps create a suitably dark atmosphere\". \"IGN\"s Jeremy Dunham was both impressed by the atmosphere of the tracks and critical of multiple instances of grueling repetition, summing the music up as \"disappointing\".\n\nUnlike \"Drakengard\", \"Drakengard 2\" has only had one soundtrack album released. \"Drag-On Dragoon 2 Original Soundtrack\" was released on July 20, 2005 under the catalog number \"AICL-1628\". It consists of 22 tracks lasting 1:13:03. It contains the tracks used during gameplay and not those used during cutscenes, but does include the game's theme song, \"Hitori\", which was also released as a separate single. Two tracks from the game were released as a promotional CD for the game, both as a limited giveaway and part of press kits. It included concept art, interviews, and trailers.\n\nThe album has received very positive reviews. Chris Greening of \"Game Music Online\" praised the shift to a more classical style and the general intensity of multiple tracks, ending the review by applauding Yoshiki's hard work. Mike Wilson, writing for \"RPGFan\", echoed many of these sentiments despite thinking that there were too few tracks on the album, giving the soundtrack ten out of ten. Both reviewers stated that it was an easier listening experience than the soundtrack for the first \"Drag-on Dragoon\" game. \"Game-OST\"s Simon Smith also praised it, calling the soundtrack \"a complete attack on the senses as an entire orchestra and full sized choir rampage as much power and tension on you as possible.\"\n\nOutside soundtrack reviews, opinions from reviews of the game itself have also been positive. \"IGN\"s Ed Lewis called the music \"appropriately dramatic\", though stated it was often drowned out by the ambient noise and voice acting. \"GameSpot\"s Greg Mueller called the music \"varied and interesting\", while stating that the vocal theme was \"sappy, but it's used sparingly enough, so it doesn't get terribly annoying\". The \"GameTrailers\" reviewer cited the score as \"top-notch\", referring to it as one of the few well-done aspects of the game.\n\nLike the second game, there has only been one soundtrack album release for \"Drakengard 3\". \"Drag-on Dragoon 3 Original Soundtrack\" was released on January 21, 2014 under the catalog number \"SQEX-10414~5\". The game's two theme songs were released both as part of the soundtrack and as singles.\n\nChristopher Huynh of \"Game Music Online\" generally praised the soundtrack's quality, but felt there was too little variety. \"RPGFan\"s Patrick Gann was generally positive, although he had little commentary on individual tracks, and recommended the album to people who had enjoyed the soundtrack of \"Nier\". The album reached #18 in the Oricon charts and remained in the charts for four weeks.\n\nReviewers of the game have also praised the soundtrack. \"USGamer\"s Kat Bailey was fairly positive about it despite not finding it very memorable, calling it \"aggressively anime, mixing piano riffs with the odd bit of J-Pop for emphasis\". Chris Carter of \"Destructoid\" called the music \"stupendous, and one of the best JRPG soundtracks I've heard in a long while.\" Andrew Barker, writing an analysis of the game for \"RPGFan\", called the music \"the backbone\" of \"Drakengard 3\". He also cited the music as being \"universally praised\" by critics.\n\nIn addition to the soundtrack albums, a single compilation of music from across the series has been produced. \"Drag-On Dragoon Chips Music\" was released on December 19, 2013 under the catalog number \"TGCS-7750\". The release consists of a selection of tracks from \"Drakengard\" (Sano, Aihara), \"Drakengard 2\" (Aoi, Matsumoto) and \"Nier\" (Okabe) remixed as chiptunes. Also included is a version of \"Exhausted\" by Sano for the piano, used as background music for \"Drakengard 3\"s Japanese website. The compilation was exclusively released as part of the \"Drag-On Dragoon 10th Anniversary Box\", featuring a copy of \"Drakengard 3\" and multiple books and artwork relating to the series. The music was accompanied by images representative of scenes from the game where the selected music plays.\n\nThe compilation received mixed to positive opinions from music reviewers. Patrick Gann of \"RPGFan\" was generally positive about the remixes, especially those of tracks from \"Nier\". \"Game Music Online\"s Christopher Huynh was a little less enthusiastic, saying that there were \"some pieces working better than others but none that should be considered bad.\" His main complaint was that there was little creativity in the remixes. Both reviewers were pleased with the piano remix of \"Exhausted\", and both criticized its exclusivity to the special bundle.\n\n is the theme song for the Japanese version of \"Drakengard 2\". It was sung by Mika Nakashima, composed by Ryoki Matsumoto, and written by Satomi. Nakashima also worked as a producer for the soundtrack. The song, originally released as part of Nakashima's third album \"Music\", was based on a previous composition for \"\". The song was written as a musical followup to \"Yuki no Hana\", and the lyrics were written to include thematic connections to the game's story.\n\nThe single was released by Sony Music Entertainment Japan on June 16, 2005, containing four versions of the song. It reached #15 in the Oricon charts upon release and remained in the charts for six weeks. Opinions on the song have been generally positive. In his review of the soundtrack, \"Game-OST\"s Simon Smith called it \"a soft jazz song with sultry smooth vocals and a nice tune\", and praised it despite it not becoming one of his favorites. Mike Wilson, writing for \"RPGFan\", referred to it as \"possibly the most beautiful vocal I've ever heard in a video game.\" Chris Greening of \"Game Music Online\" called it \"a strong rival to every single pop ballad released from Square Enix, proving rich yet accessible.\"\n\n is one of the two theme songs for \"Drakengard 3\". It was sung by Eir Aoi, composed by \"Drakengard 3\" composer Keichi Okabe and written by Kikuchi Hana, one of the original scenario writers for \"Nier\". Aoi, a singer native to Hokkaido, was chosen by Okabe to perform the song due to her outspoken admiration of the \"Drakengard\" series.\n\nEir Aoi's fifth single, \"Kuroi Uta\" was originally released on November 13, 2013 as the final track on the single disc \"Sirius\". The single reached #21 in the Oricon charts and remained in the charts for fourteen weeks.\n\n\"This Silence Is Mine\", the game's second theme song, was specially written and sung by Onitsuka Chihiro. It was composed by Okabe. Okabe asked Chihiro to help with the song because he felt she would be the perfect singer to project the world and themes of \"Drakengard 3\". The intention was to make the song emotionally intense, but at the same time \"cold\" and \"empty\". While writing the song, Chihiro was inspired by Zero's presentation within the game. The original draft of the song was created in around five minutes, and Chihiro had to sing the song five times before Okabe was satisfied with her performance. The song debuted in the game's trailer at the 2013 Tokyo Game Show.\n\nThe single was released on a CD along with a version of her following single . The single reached 36th place in the Oricon charts. Huynh was positive about the song in his review of the soundtrack, saying that Chihiro \"[brought] her best, delivering an emotional track with a powerful buildup to a dizzying climax.\" Gann was also positive, saying Chihiro's singing style fitted the tone of both game and series, calling the delivery \"superb\". He also called Okabe's production of the song \"very smart\".\n\n"}

{"id": "39469456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39469456", "title": "Oculus (film)", "text": "Oculus (film)\n\nOculus is a 2013 American supernatural horror film written, edited, and directed by Mike Flanagan. It is based on his short film \"Oculus: Chapter 3 – The Man with the Plan\", and stars Karen Gillan as a young woman who is convinced that an antique mirror is responsible for the death and misfortune that her family suffered.\n\nThe film had its world premiere on September 5, 2013, at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) and received a wide theatrical release on April 11, 2014. It received generally positive reviews from critics, and was a box office success.\n\nThe film takes place in two different times: the present and 11 years earlier. The two plot lines are told in parallel through flashbacks. In 2002, software engineer Alan Russell moves into a new house with his wife Marie, 10-year-old son Tim, and 12-year-old daughter Kaylie. Alan purchases an antique mirror to decorate his office. Unbeknownst to them, the mirror supernaturally induces hallucinations. Marie is haunted by visions of her own body decaying, while Alan is seduced by a ghostly woman named Marisol, who has mirrors in place of eyes.\n\nOver time, the parents become psychotic; Alan isolates himself in his office, and Marie becomes withdrawn and paranoid. All of the plants in the house die, and the family dog disappears after being shut in the office with the mirror. After Kaylie sees Alan with Marisol, she tells her mother, and the parents fight. One night, Marie goes insane and attempts to kill her children, but Alan locks her away. When the family runs out of food, the children realize that their father is under the influence of the mirror, so Kaylie goes to seek help from their mother, and finds her chained to the wall, acting like an animal. Kaylie and Tim try going to their neighbors for help, but the neighbors disbelieve their stories. When Kaylie attempts to use the phone, she discovers that all of her phone calls are answered by the same man.\n\nOne night, Alan unchains Marie, and both parents attack the children. Marie briefly comes to her senses, only to be shot dead by Alan. The children try to destroy the mirror but it tricks them, making them believe they are hitting the mirror when they are actually hitting the wall. Alan also experiences a moment of lucidity and kills himself by forcing Tim to pull the trigger of the gun and shoot him. Before dying, he begs the children to run, but Marisol and other victims of the mirror appear as horrific ghosts. The police arrive and take Tim into custody. Before the siblings are separated, they promise to reunite as adults and destroy the mirror. As Tim is taken away, he sees the ghosts of his parents watching him from the house.\n\nEleven years later, Tim is discharged from a psychiatric hospital, having come to believe that there were no supernatural events involved in his parents' deaths. Kaylie has spent most of her young adulthood researching the history of the mirror. Using her position as an employee of an auction house, she obtains access to the mirror and has it transported to the family home, where she places it in a room filled with surveillance cameras and a \"kill switch\" — an anchor weighted to the ceiling. Kaylie intends to destroy the mirror, but first wants to document its powers, proving Tim's innocence.\n\nTim attempts to convince Kaylie that she's wrong and the siblings argue. When they notice the houseplants begin to wilt, they review the camera footage and see themselves performing actions they have no memory of. Tim finally accepts that the mirror has an evil power and attempts to escape the house with Kaylie, only for the pair to be drawn back by the mirror's influence. Seeing a hallucination of her mother, Kaylie stabs it in the neck, only to realize that she has stabbed her fiancé. They try to call the police, but are only able to reach the same voice who spoke to them on the phone as children. Tim activates the kill switch, realizing too late that Kaylie stood in its path, and he has killed her. The police arrive and arrest Tim, who is hysterical, just as they did when he was younger. As both a boy and an adult, Tim claims the mirror is responsible. As he is taken away, Tim's adult incarnation sees Kaylie's ghost standing in the house with his parents.\n\n\nThe film is based on Flanagan's earlier 2005 short horror film, also called \"Oculus\". The short contained only one setting, a single actor, and a mirror. The short became highly acclaimed, and interest quickly arose regarding the adaptation of the short into a feature. Initially, studios were interested in making the film in accordance with the found footage genre; however, Flanagan was opposed to this and passed on such offers. Eventually, Intrepid Pictures expressed interest in producing the film \"as long as you don't do it found footage\".\n\nExpanding the premise to a feature-length screenplay proved challenging, as Flanagan felt like he had \"pushed the limit\" of what could be done with the premise in the short. The solution Flanagan came across was to combine two storylines, past and present, intercut with one another. The idea was to \"create a sense of distortion and disorientation that would be similar for the viewer as it was for Tim and Kaylie in the room.\" In early drafts, it was difficult to distinguish between the two timelines, until the team hit upon the idea of writing all of the scenes from the past in italics.\n\nInspired by the stories of H. P. Lovecraft, Flanagan chose to not explain the mirror's origins, describing to Den of Geek that he liked how Lovecraftian literature often seemed to be an \"alien force that if you even were to try to comprehend it completely it would drive you mad.\" He expanded: \"Evil in the world doesn't have an answer.\"\n\nOn October 27, 2012, filming wrapped in Fairhope, Alabama, after three weeks.\n\nThe film was first released on September 5, 2013, at the 2013 TIFF, and received a worldwide theatrical release on April 11, 2014.\n\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on August 5, 2014.\n\nThe soundtrack to \"Oculus\" was released digitally on April 8, 2014 and on CD on April 15, 2014.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 74% based on 144 reviews with an average rating of 6.5/10. The site’s critical consensus reads, \"With an emphasis on dread over gore and an ending that leaves the door wide open for sequels, \"Oculus\" could be just the first spine-tingling chapter in a new franchise for discerning horror fans.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100 based on 28 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nShock Till You Drop gave \"Oculus\" a positive review, stating that it was \"smart and scary stuff\". Film School Rejects gave a mixed review and stated that it was \"well-acted, looks quite good, and manages some moments of entertainment, but as the minutes tick by it grows weaker and weaker until its final cheat is designed to allow for a shocker ending.\"\n\nReleased in the United States on April 11, 2014, \"Oculus\" grossed $4,966,899 on its opening day, nearly equaling its production budget of $5 million. As of October 3, 2014, the film has taken in an estimated $27,695,246 at the North American box office and another $16,335,000 internationally for a worldwide total of $44,030,246.\n\nIn March 2015, Relativity Media, B4U Television Network, and Balaji Telefilms confirmed a Bollywood remake with the title \"Zahhak\". The title was later changed to \"\". This film is directed by Prawaal Raman and stars Huma Qureshi and Saqib Saleem in the leading roles. Director Mike Flanagan served as the executive producer. The film was released on June 2, 2017.\n\n\n"}

Due to World War II, Koke left Bali and surfing did not catch on again until the late 1960s and early 1970s when traveling surfers began discovering surf spots off Bali, made especially famous (although they were not named) in the classic surfing film \"Morning of the Earth\" by Albert Falzon. Later Bali would become a stepping-stone for other Indonesian wave discoveries such as Nias, G-Land, and the Mentawai Islands. Although much of the Indonesian coastline has been scoured in search of surfing areas, every year continues to yield new discoveries, even today.\nToday, surfing is an ubiquitous multi-million dollar Indonesian industry, which includes transportation, accommodation, dining, entertainment, and surfing services and products. Some islands have beach communities that make a living directly from surfing, such as Lakey Peak in Sumbawa, Sorake Beach in Nias, and Uluwatu Beach in Bali. Multinational surfing brands such as Billabong, Quiksilver, and Oakley, Inc. run their entire Southeast Asia operation and distribution out of their Bali headquarters, most of which are found in the Kuta district.\n\nIndonesian surfers are among the most successful in Asia and are ranked by the Asian Surfing Championships, an organization that holds surfing contests throughout Asia. Raditya Rondi from Kuta Beach, Bali, was crowned the ASC Champion 2015, retaining both the Indonesian and Asian titles. Several international contests have been held in Indonesia over the years and 2013 alone saw two big international pro events, the Rip Curl Cup at Padang Padang invite-only event (won by Mega Semadhi from Pecatu, Bali), and the Oakley Pro Bali, which was the 5th stop of the world tour (won by 2012 World Champion Joel Parkinson, Australia). Both contests were broadcast live online to over 2 million viewers worldwide.\n\nRegional governments have realized the positive impact surfing has on their communities and the travel industry and have held ASC surfing contests in order to promote their waves and beaches. Surfing was admitted into the 2007 Asian Beach Games in Bali as a sport by the International Olympic Committee, the first major stepping stone to getting into the Olympic Games. Indonesian surfers are making an impact nationally and overseas with media coverage and contests result and strive to qualify for the ASP World Championship Tour. Still, the Indonesian central government has not acknowledged surfing as a major sport in Indonesia or supported it in any way.\n\nIndonesia is considered a surfer's paradise as it is composed of numerous islands with world class surf spots in warm water, some of them still unexplored.\n\nThe island of Bali is the most touristic destination for surfing in Indonesia as it has many world class waves and infrastructures to put up the tourists. The most famous surfing destinations on the island are Padang Padang, Uluwatu, Bali and Keramas.\n\nPadang Padang is another popular surf spot located on the south west of Bali.\n\nUluwatu is considered the most famous surfing spot in Bali. It is located on the south west of the island.\n\nKeramas is located on the south east of Bali. It is a right and left wave breaking on rocks.\n\nJava has many surf spots, the most popular one being G-Land.\n\nG-Land is located on the east side of Java. It is a hollow and powerful left, breaking on a sharp reef.\nLombok island is the neighboring island eastward of Bali, as beautiful but much less developed.\n\nGerupuk Inside is a couple of hollow lefts and rights. It fits well for beginners. \n\nGerupuk Outside is the most famous surfing spot in Lombok, it is composed of two rights a quarter of miles apart.\n\nEkas is located opposite to the small harbour of Awang. It is right and left.\n\nMawi is also located on the south coast, but at the opposite west near Selong Belanak. It is also right and left.\n\nThe Mentawai is a chain of islands consisting of four main islands surrounded by numerous smaller islands. It is located near Sumatra island. There are several surf spots accessible by boat, with the best known being Macaroni, Lances Left and Lances Right.\n\nMacaroni is a hollow left located in North Pagai.\n\nLances Right is a right with hollow barrels, located in Sipura.\n\nLances Left is located near Lances Right. It is similar to Lances Right except that it is a left.\n\nThe Panaitan Islands are located near Java. These islands host many surf spots, the most famous being One Palm Point and Apocalypse.\n\nOne Palm Point is a legendary left point break with a shallow bottom.\n\nApocalypse is a hollow right slab.\n\nKrui in Lampung Province. \n\nSumbawa island is located at the east of Lombok. It has plenty of popular surf spots, with the most famous being Lakey Peak and Scar Reef.\n\nBob Koke (USA) was the first surfer to ride Indonesian waves in the late 1930s. He then settled there and taught some Balinese to surf. \nRizal Tanjung is one of the best known Indonesian surfers in the world as he was the first Indonesian to compete on the WQS. He was one of the first Indonesian surfers to travel as a professional surfer. He won the Indonesian Surfing Championship circuit in 2002 and 2006. He was called \"The most recognizable Asian surfer alive\" by Transworld Surf magazine. He also owns Kurawa and Rizt (two brands). He appeared in many surfing videos, including the famous Loose Change and Stranger Than Fiction.\n\nOney Anwar was the first surfer from Sumbawa to compete on the WQS. He learned to surf in Lakey Peak and joined the Rip Curl team when he was 10. He moved to Australia in a Rip Curl program for young surfers and came back later in Indonesia. He is now internationally known and looking to qualify for the WCT.\n\nRaditya Rondi has been winning the Asian Surfing Championships since their creation in 2011. Indeed, he won the title of champion three consecutive years. He built a solid reputation in the Asian surfing scene and is internationally known.\n\nThe Indonesian Surfing Championships (ISC) were launched by Tipi Jabrik in 2003, with a first edition in 2004 in partnership with Quiksilver. Its goal was to promote the growth of the sport of surfing in Indonesia through the organization of surfing competitions. It immediately met a big success, finally leading to a partnership with Coca-Cola Amatil Indonesia in 2008. This partnership lasted almost five years, including the creation of the Asian Surfing Championships (ASC) from the success of the ISC. The ISC still exists today, with competitions part of the ASC tour, which is also based in Indonesia. Therefore, the ASC is the leading player of the Asian Surfing scene.\n\nIndonesia is a popular tourist destination because of its warm water and climate, its beautiful landscapes, and its perfect waves.\n\nTourism is the second largest sector of employment in Indonesia. 3% of the national GDP is generated by the tourism industry for a total amount of 4.5 billion $. In the island of Bali, which attracts the most foreign tourists, this sector represents two thirds of the local economy. There are no data to count the part of surfers among the tourists but according to the crowd in the water and to the part of foreigners in it, it attracts a lot of people. It is estimated that the surfing business generates more than half billion dollars in Bali alone, which represents more than 10% of the amount generated by tourism. Taking into account that the largest part of the surfers in Bali are tourists, surfing can be considered as a major part of tourism in Indonesia.\n\nIndonesia has various other spots in other islands (like Lakey Peak or G-Land) which attract tourists only for surfing. Surfing has therefore developed a touristic activity in places which probably would not have attracted people otherwise.\n\nSome surf spots contain sharp reefs which are best avoided by beginners. Sunburns can also pose a problem, as the sun is strong and can quickly cause burns. Shark attacks occur (though rarely), and the water is also the home of several kinds of jellyfish which can sting surfers severely.\n\n"}
{"id": "6803252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6803252", "title": "Telephone recording laws", "text": "Telephone recording laws\n\nTelephone recording laws are laws that govern the civilian recording of telephone conversations by the participants. Recording of private conversations by government or law enforcement (wiretapping) are usually covered by distinct laws.\n\nTelephone tapping is strictly regulated in many countries, especially in all developed democracies, to safeguard the privacy of telephone users. Telephone tapping often must be authorized by a court, and is normally only approved when evidence shows it is not possible to detect criminal or subversive activity in less intrusive ways; often the law and regulations require that the crime investigated must be at least of a certain severity. In many jurisdictions, however, permission for telephone tapping is easily obtained on a routine basis without further investigation by the court or other entity granting such permission. Illegal or unauthorized telephone tapping is often a criminal offense. However, in certain jurisdictions such as Germany, criminal courts may accept illegally recorded phone calls without the other party's consent as evidence.\n\nThe federal \"Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979\" and State and Territory listening devices laws may both apply to monitoring or recording of telephone conversations. The general rule is that the call may not be recorded. Section 7 of the \"Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979\" prohibits intercepting a telephone call. \"Interception\" is defined in section 6, of which one element is that it is made \"without the knowledge of the person making the communication\". There are exceptions to these rules in very limited circumstances, including where a warrant applies.\n\nIf a call is to be recorded or monitored, an organization must tell you at the beginning of the conversation so that you have the chance either to end the call, or to ask to be transferred to another line where monitoring or recording does not take place (if this is available).\n\nReasons organizations may monitor or record conversations could include:\n\nIn the state of Queensland it is not illegal to simply record a telephone conversation if you are a party to the conversation.\n\nIn Canada, organizations subject to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) must comply with PIPEDA when recording calls.\n\nIn order to comply with the PIPEDA, organizations should take the following steps when recording conversations:\n\nAn individual may record a call as long as he or she is one of the participants of the call. The recording can be used as evidence in a lawsuit.\n\nHowever, it is illegal to record communications that the recording party is not participating in. An illegal recording can lead to a sentence of up to five years in prison. Section 183 (Part VI) of the Criminal Code also outlaws surreptitious recording of communications without consent of one of the intended recipients.\n\nCalls and conversations may be recorded by any active participant, with no requirement to make other parties aware of the recording. But forwarding or playing calls considered private is illegal.\n\nIn the case of private persons, calls and conversations may be recorded by any active participant. There is no requirement to make other parties aware of the recording, but the use of recordings, depending on their content, may be subject to various laws, such as data protection (privacy) legislation, libel laws, laws governing trade and national secrets, and any agreements, such as non-disclosure agreements.\n\nRecording of calls by a company or an employer is subject to data protection legislation and, as a general rule, requires informing the participants prior to recording.\n\nGermany is a two-party consent state—telephone recording without the consent of the two or, when applicable, more, parties is a criminal offence according to Sec. 201 of the German Criminal Code—violation of the confidentiality of the spoken word. Telephone tapping by authorities has to be approved by a judge. Telephone recording by a private citizen can be allowed in cases of self-defence, Sec. 32 of the German Criminal Code, or Necessity, Sec. 34 of the German Criminal Code.\n\nFor discussion on lawful interception in Germany please see (German language).\n\nIn India, telephone tapping has to be approved by a designated authority. It is illegal otherwise.\nThe Central Government or State Government is empowered to order interception of messages per 12section 5 of Indian Telegraph Act 1885. Rule 419 and 419A sets out the procedure of interception and monitoring of telephone messages. There is a provision for a review committee to supervise the order of interception.\n\nPhone tapping is permitted based on Court order only and such permission is granted only if it is required to prevent a major offence involving national security or to gather intelligence on anti-national/terrorist activities.\n\nThough economic offences/tax evasion were initially covered under the reasons for interception of phones, the same was withdrawn in 1999 by the Government based on a Supreme Court order citing protection to privacy of the individual.\n\nAs per Rule 428 of the India telegraphic rules, no person without the sanction of the telegraph authority, use any telephone or cause or suffer it to be used, purposes other than the establishment of local or trunk calls.\n\nThe Government of India instructions provide for approved attachments. There is no provision for attachment for recording conversation.\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court of Cassation, recorded conversations are legal and can be used as evidence in court, even if the other party is unaware of being recorded, provided that the recording party takes part of the conversation.\n\nRecorded calls are legal and can be used as evidence in court, providing the person recording is a participant to the conversation, or has consent from at least one participant from the conversation. \n\nCalls and conversations by private persons may be recorded by any active participant. There is no requirement in laws to make other parties aware of the recording, but the use of recordings, depending on their content, may be subject to various laws.\n\nRecording of phone calls by private persons falls under interception-related provisions of the Crimes Act 1961, which has a general prohibition on the use of interception devices. An exception is made for when the person intercepting the call is a party to the conversation. There is no requirement that both parties be aware of the interception.\n\nIntercepting communications falls under the provisions of the Penal Code and, in the case of electronic communications, under the Telecommunications Act (506/2004). The recording of a conversation by a private member to that conversation is specifically permitted. Nevertheless, while such recordings are legal, making use of them may fall subject to further civil or criminal law. Their admissibility as evidence also depends on the circumstances.\n\nThere are strict conditions for both the act of surveillance as well as the storage of that data, but as long as it is clear enough of what exactly is being used for as well as implementation procedures were legal by authorities, it is deemed as alright. The subject at hand was suspected for not related criminal investigation therefore the telephone tapping was justified. \n\nAccording to the Swedish Penal Code (Brottsbalken) (SFS1962/700) Chapter 4, 8–9 §§, it is illegal to make \"unauthorized\" recordings of telephone conversatios. A court can grant permission for law enforcement agencies to tap telephone lines. Also, anyone participating in the telephone call may record the conversation — at least one party in the call must be aware of the recording being made. A recording is always admissible as evidence in a court, even if obtained in illegal matters.\n\nThe Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 in general prohibits interception of communications by a third party, with exceptions related to government agencies. A recording made by one party to a phone call or e-mail without notifying the other is not prohibited provided that the recording is for their own use; recording without notification is prohibited where some of the contents of the communication—a phone conversation or an e-mail—are made available to a third party. Businesses may record with the knowledge of their employees, but without notifying the other party, to\n\nThey may monitor without recording phone calls or e-mails that have been received to see whether they are relevant to the business (e.g., to check for business communications addressed to an employee who is away); but such monitoring must be proportional and in accordance with data protection laws and codes of practice.\n\nThis summary does not necessarily cover all possible cases. The main legislation which must be complied with is:\n\nUnder RIPA unlawful recording or monitoring of communications is a tort, allowing civil action in the courts. There is a summary of applicable rules on the Oftel website.\n\nRecording is sometimes advised, as in recording business transactions carried out by telephone to provide a record. It is sometimes mandatory; from March 2009 Financial Services Authority rules required firms to record all telephone conversations and electronic communications relating to client orders and the conclusion of transactions in the equity, bond, and derivatives markets. In November 2011 this was extended to cover the recording of mobile phone conversations that related to client orders and transactions by regulated firms.\n\nIn \"Rathbun v United States\", the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in regard to interstate or foreign communication that \"the clear inference is that one entitled to receive the communication may use it for his own benefit or have another use it for him. The communication itself is not privileged, and one party may not force the other to secrecy merely by using a telephone. It has been conceded by those who believe the conduct here violates Section 605 [of the Federal Communication Act] that either party may record the conversation and publish it.\" See United States v. Polakoff, 113 F. 2d 888, 889. (Therefore, every communications including interstate phone calls, to and from any States in the USA and every foreign phone call to and from the USA, are under the control and the jurisdiction of the Federal government of the USA pursuant to the Federal communication Act of June 19, 1934, 48 Stat. 1064, 1104, 47 U.S.C. Section 605. That any party to the phone conversation can him/herself record the phone conversation or have another person record the phone conversation for him/her and publish it, including posting it on social media.)\n\nFederal law requires that at least one party taking part in the call must be notified of the recording (18 U.S.C. §2511(2)(d)). For example, it would be illegal to record, without notification, the phone calls of people who come into a place of business and ask to use the telephone. \n\nTelephone recording laws in some U.S. states require only one party to be aware of the recording, while other states require both parties to be aware. Several states require that all parties consent when one party wants to record a telephone conversation. Telephone scammers and others intentionally violating the federal Do Not Call list may try to locate in those states, or use their area codes. Many businesses and other organizations record their telephone calls so that they can prove what was said, train their staff, or monitor performance. This activity may not be considered telephone tapping in some, but not all, jurisdictions because it is done with the knowledge of at least one of the parties to the telephone conversation.\n\nTelephone recordings are governed by federal law and by mainly two types of state laws:\n\nStates that currently require that all parties consent to the recording include:\n\n\nOther states (and the District of Columbia) not listed above require only that one party consent to the recording.\n\nOne Party Consent States\n\n\nFollowing the Illinois Supreme Court's decision in \"People v. Clark\" on March 20, 2014, which struck down Illinois' two-party consent law, Illinois was a one-party consent state. However, the state legislature amended the statute and, as of December 30, 2014, Illinois is once again a two-party consent state, although the revised law establishes a one-party consent rule for private electronic communications.\n\nThe Michigan Court of Appeals ruled in 1982 that participants in a conversation may record a discussion without getting the permission of other participants. The ruling stated that eavesdropping only applies to: \"a third party not otherwise involved in the conversation being eavesdropped on\". This is because the law uses the wording, \"the private discourse of others\", rather than the wording, \"the private discourse of others \"or with others\". Michigan law is often misinterpreted as requiring the consent of all parties to a conversation.\n\nThe California Supreme Court ruled in 2006 that if a caller in a one-party state records a conversation with someone in California, that one-party state caller is subject to the stricter of the laws and must have consent from all callers (cf. \"Kearney v. Salomon Smith Barney Inc.\", 39 Cal. 4th 95). However, non-disclosure recordings by one of the parties can legally be made if the other party is threatening kidnapping, extortion, bribery, human trafficking, or other felony violence. Also included in the exception is misdemeanor obscenity and threats of injury to persons or property via an electronic communication device (usually a telephone) if directed in whole or in part towards a conversation participant or family members.\n\nAccording to the Digital Media Law Project, 'New York is a one-party consent state.'\n\nSome states distinguish between electronic and in-person communication. For example, Oregon is a one-party consent state for electronic communication, but requires all-party consent for live in-person communication, with a few exceptions.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission defines accepted forms of notification for telephone recording by telephone companies as:\n\n\n"}

It is the fifth game entry in \"The House of the Dead\" series, a prequel to the original game chronologically and the first in the series to be released solely on a home console. An \"Extended Cut\" edition for PlayStation 3, compatible with the PlayStation Move accessory, was released in 2011. A mobile version, The Lost Reels was released on iOS and Android devices in 2013.\n\nAn alternate version, The Typing of The Dead: Overkill, was released for Microsoft Windows in 2013, replacing the game's shooting gameplay with keyboard typing mechanics from 1999's \"The Typing of the Dead\". It includes the original shooting mechanics as an option.\n\nLike previous games in the \"House of the Dead\" series, \"Overkill\" is a rail shooter, with pre-determined character movement, with the shooting element under player control by pointing the Wii Remote at the screen, moving the aiming reticle. The player can point the reticle near the edge of the screen to move the camera angle slightly in that direction, allowing a further field of view known as \"Danger Cam\". The story mode can be played solo or with another human player, with one weapon or dual-wielding controls.\n\nPlayers can also build up a combo meter by killing mutants to receive a score, with further points gained by performing head-shots, shooting bonus pickup, saving civilians and attaining multiple kills without missing a shot. If a player dies, points from his or her overall score can be spent to continue playing. At the end of each level, the player is awarded a grade that depends on his or her final score among other factors such as not dying, and accuracy of shots. Along with score bonuses, other pick ups scattered throughout levels include health packs, grenades, the \"Slow Mo-Fo\" pick up that puts everything into slow motion temporarily and the \"Evil Eye\" feature in which shooting a certain environmental point destroys any lurking mutants nearby.\n\nNew guns and gun upgrades can be bought with cash earned from the player's end of level score, between levels at the Gun Shop. Upon completing the story mode, Director's Cut is unlocked providing the same game as story mode but with tougher enemies, extended levels and a limited amount of continues.\n\n\nYears ago during the Cold War, the U.S. military made a new superhuman formula called Formula X but the project for its use failed. The bunker for the experiments was shut down and abandoned. In 1991, seven years before The Curien Mansion Incident, AMS Special Agent G is given his first assignment and sent to a small town in Louisiana to investigate a series of disappearances and hunt down a deranged crime boss, Papa Caesar. Due to the presence of mutants, G is forced to team up with police detective Isaac Washington who is out to avenge his father's murder, which Caesar masterminded.\n\nIn the first episode \"Papa's Palace of Pain\", the pair first storm a mansion owned by Caesar out in the woods. Upon entering the basement, they find Caesar has fled, and the disabled scientist Jasper Guns, whom Caesar used, is horrifically mutated from injecting himself with an unknown substance. Upon defeating Jasper, G and Isaac meet Varla Guns, a stripper and Jasper's older sister who vows revenge on Caesar. In the second episode, \"Ballistic Trauma\", G and Isaac track Caesar to a hospital that is swarming with mutants. After killing the mutants and a mutant woman called the Screamer, they find a ringing phone hidden inside it. Caesar answers from the other end and the hospital is set to explode. G and Isaac escape in the nick of time with Varla on a motorbike. In the third episode, \"Carny\", they stop at a mutant infested carnival to investigate the mutant situation, in the process defeating former circus entertainers turned horrific creature Nigel & Sebastian. Afterwards, they continue to follow Caesar on an ice cream truck. In the fourth episode, \"Scream Train\", they and Varla catch Caesar at a train station. But they argue over what to do with him: G wants to arrest him, Issac wants to avenge his father, and Varla wants to avenge her brother. Caesar then escapes on a train with G and Isaac giving chase while Varla is left behind. The pair made their way through the mutant-infested train, defeating a mutated mantis, the Crawler, in the process. An explosion causes the train to crash in a swamp where Caesar takes Varla hostage and drives off before throwing a cassette tape to Isaac. In the fifth episode, \"Fetid Waters\", G and Isaac make their way to the swamps, finding an alternate way to wherever Caesar and Varla were heading for, and in the process, defeat another boss mutant called the Lobber.\n\nIn the sixth, penultimate episode 'Jailhouse Judgment', G and Isaac track Caesar to a high security prison. Before they enter, they run into its strange warden, Clement Darling, who noticed where Caesar and Varla headed but knows nothing about the mutants. As G and Isaac shoot their way through the prison they finally reach the electric chair theater where Varla and Caesar are strapped into the chairs. Clement then appears and, in a plot twist, reveals that he was behind the mutant outbreak and that Caesar was just an accomplice. Clement then executes Caesar, robbing Isaac of his revenge. Clement explains that his experiments were to save his dying mother (following this, it is implied Clement has an incestuous relationship with his mother). Clement then descends on a giant elevator along with Varla, his mother, and Caesar's corpse. Seconds later, Clement tells G and Isaac to look at the stage behind them where two gigantic, physically enhanced, convicts wearing black masks lumber in through the door. Clement reads the two convicts' previous crimes which include murder, assault, rape, and even eating a little boy's puppy. One of the convicts, Brutus, suddenly turns around and beats his fellow convict to death before turning his attention to G and Isaac.\n\nAfter killing Brutus and descending the elevator in pursuit of Clement in the final episode \"Overkill\", G and Isaac shoot their way through hordes of mutants inside Clement's underground lab before finally reaching his center of operations. They discover Varla's brain has been taken out, kept alive in a jar, while Clement's mother's brain has been transplanted into Varla's body. At first it seems the experiment was a success, then Varla's body begins to vomit and she falls into a pit after being gunned down by G and Isaac, mutating her into a giant monster. G and Isaac draw their guns and aim them at the newly mutated Mother. The duo's statements lead gamers to believe that they are about to play a frantic last stand shootout against the giant mutant, but then the screen cuts to a missing reel screen for a few moments. Once the reel resumes G and Isaac are outside claiming victory over Clement and the giant monster, thanking the use of miniguns they found randomly lying around nearby. However, the monster returns and the pair battle her again. After finally killing it, Clement appears and seeks to atone for all the problems he caused by \"returning to the womb\" and enters the monster's body.\n\nG and Isaac are picked up by a helicopter along with Varla's (still active) brain in a jar where Isaac releases the detonator to destroy the facility. G tells Varla of his feelings for her, prompting him and Isaac to discuss the moral and political messages in the game's storyline and potential backlash, particularly from feminists. Soon after, the two realize the helicopter is being piloted by a mutant and point their guns at it, ending the game.\n\nIn \"Extended Cut\", there are two new levels featuring Varla Guns and a stripper named Candi Stryper, who was in love with Jasper Guns. It is a side story during the main game (set after the second and fourth levels). It sees the girls traveling through a strip club and a meat packing plant, fighting grotesque mutant strippers Coco and Sindy, as well as Meat Katie, a minotaur-like female butcher. The side story ends with Candi dying of blood loss after the battle with Meat Katie.\n\nAfter the credits roll, Caesar's tape recording from before is played, revealing a message to Isaac that Clement's plans were small-minded but he has powerful friends (possibly the future DBR corporation), and that Isaac's father is still alive.\n\nThe game was originally intended to follow the same style as previous \"The House of the Dead\" games, while other themes such as steampunk were also considered. Headstrong ultimately chose a theme inspired by exploitation films after watching the film \"Planet Terror\", which inspired the art direction, plot and marketing.\n\nMost of the main characters were modeled after several famous individuals. For example, Detective Washington was modeled after rapper Common, Varla Guns after glamor model Vikki Blows, Papa Caesar after Burt Reynolds, Jasper Guns after Stephen Hawking, and Agent G on Keanu Reeves as he appears in \"Point Break\".\n\nThe soundtrack is written and composed by John Sanderson and Nadeem Daya. The songs are pop, rock, funk, country and disco genres of the 1970s era. Despite many requests from fans, neither Sega nor Headstrong Games have any plans to release an official soundtrack, although there exist bootleg versions on the Internet.\n\n\"The House of the Dead: Overkill\" was originally released on the Wii on February 10, 2009 in North America and February 13, 2009 in Europe. The game was later released in Japan on September 17, 2009 bundled with the Wii Zapper accessory.\n\nThe game was also released in a limited collector's edition that includes a graphic novel prequel to the game called \"Prelude to an Overkill\". A special release of the game in Australia, the \"Bang Bang Box\", comes packaged with the graphic novel in addition to two Wii Remote gun shells modeled after the AMS pistols carried by the main characters in the game (similar to a Desert Eagle pistol).\n\nOn October 25, 2011, the game was released on the PlayStation 3 with PlayStation Move compatibility in North America, Europe and Australia and on February 23, 2012 in Japan. It came with the Sixaxis controllers and DualShock 3 titled, . \"Extended Cut\" features the same on-rails gameplay with all new redone High Definition cutscenes and levels, albeit still virtually identical to the Wii version, including that the missing reel is restored. The game also has 3D compatibility with the use of an HD 3D TV. Music and audio are still the same along with new music featured.\n\nExclusive are two new levels not included in the original Wii release, \"Naked Terror\" and \"Creeping Flesh\". They both serve as a sidestory in-between the main game featuring Varla Gunns and a new female character, stripper Candi Stryper. They contain new enemy types (strippers, meat plantation workers and skinless zombies), additional bonus materials for you to collect, and two new boss battles. New weapons like a crossbow and a few others have been added to \"Extended Cut\" as well as an entirely new in-game screen layout. Extras from the Wii version like the mini games and Director's Cut mode also make it to the \"Extended Cut\", along with new content. A pre-order comic book, \"Prelude to an Overkill\" is available in-game as a collectible bonus material.\n\n\"The House of the Dead: Overkill – The Lost Reels\" was released for iOS and Android devices on April 25, 2013. The game is split into three chapters, with the first two included and the latter third requiring an additional fee. Money can also be spent in exchange for coins that can unlock better weapons, including some based on other Sega games such as \"Vectorman\". The Lost Reels eventually became free-to-play until Sega removed the game from the App Store a year later due to negative reviews.\n\n\"The Typing of the Dead: Overkill\", developed by Modern Dream, was simultaneously announced and released on Microsoft Windows on October 29, 2013. The game follows the same premise of the 1999 game, \"The Typing of the Dead\", following the same storyline of \"Overkill: Extended Cut\", but requiring players to type out words and phrases using a keyboard to defeat zombies as opposed to shooting them. The game also includes the \"Extended Cut\" version of \"The House of the Dead: Overkill\", playable with mouse or controller, and features downloadable dictionaries and multiplayer after an update.\n\nThe game began development at Blitz Games Studios, which was liquidated in September 2013. Upon the studio's closure, the development team were able to convince Sega to let them complete the game under a new license. Several DLC text packs have been released that replace the typed words. Shakespeare and Filth packs were released in 2013 and Love at First Bite (Valentine's Day-themed) pack was released in 2014.\n\nUpon release, \"The House of the Dead: Overkill\" received a generally favorable response from critics, with an average review score of 81% at GameRankings and 79/100 at Metacritic. Many critics praised the fast-paced balanced gameplay, with X-Play stating \"the arcade style shooting is satisfying and provides a challenge for experienced players\" yet \"easily conquered for those who can't aim a Wiimote to save their life.\" Games Radar found the simple gameplay to be \"varied enough to keep the momentum going.\" Although considered to be easier than past games of the series, GameSpot calling the difficulty a \"cake walk\" at pure gore and bloodiest game times, Eurogamer opined the game \"almost never tries your patience, and it's made with such infectious and irreverent glee and such obvious pride, you can't help but join in.\" The over-the-top B movie grindhouse style was particularly praised. \"Game Informer\" stated \"the parade of F-bombs and one-liners fit in perfect harmony with the grindhouse presentation\", even recommending it to Tarantino fans. GameSpot claimed it \"reinvents the aging shooter series for the better with an over-the-top grindhouse theme that resonates in its every aspect, from the hilarious story to the fantastic vintage soundtrack.\" \"Edge\" stated that \"Overkill\" \"raises the bar for third party production values on this generation's best-selling console.\" Though 1UP \"still enjoyed the game\", they did consider that \"with its constant stream of expletives and toilet humor, it may turn just as many people away\" and started their review with a disclaimer for younger gamers not to play, being strictly an adult game. Another issue critics found was a number of technical issues, particularly with the frame rate, which IGN called \"sketchy\" and \"sad to see in a game that has so much amazing content in it.\" \"GamePro\" also experienced this, notably when \"the screen became cluttered with enemies\", originally hoping the issue to be fixed before the game's final release. Another issue were glitches, with \"Computer and Video Games\" reportedly experiencing no enemies appearing at all at times and sometimes requiring to restart the console.\n\nOn the Special Achievement Award, GameSpot awarded \"Overkill\" Funniest Game of 2009, going on to say: \"The interplay between Washington and Special Agent G is pure gold. Like Martin and Lewis with F-bombs. Mix that up with grindball atmosphere and Overkill cements its place as the funniest game of 2009.\" The game received a \"Guinness World Record\" for being the most profane video game in history. Jonathan Burroughs, the game's writer, said: \"It is a dubious honor to receive such an accolade working in an industry where so often the fruits of your labors are derided and dismissed for being puerile or irresponsible. But in the case of \"The House Of The Dead: Overkill\", a little puerility was the order of business. Parodying the profane excess of grindhouse cinema was (game developer) Headstrong Games' objective and I am flattered that this record acknowledges that we not only rose to that challenge, but entirely exceeded it.\" This record was beaten a year later by \"Mafia II\".\n\nNPD Group reported that the game sold 45,000 units in the United States in its debut month. Sega of America has expressed satisfaction with the game's sales numbers, claiming that it has \"absolutely met our expectations.\"\n\n"}

Active throughout the 1970s, they were pioneers of street dance. Don Campbell is the founder of the locking dance style, and originally, Locking was called The Campbellock - a style that was based on the dance and song that Don Campbell created. Toni Basil met Campbell at a club in 1971 and together they formed The Lockers as a dance group. Toni Basil also served as The Lockers' manager, and was responsible for staging the act. All the dancers contributed steps and choreography with their unique and individual styles. By 1975 they were \"Dancing their way to stardom\" on their own. Individual members' contributions (as soloist performers) to the dance style and group image coupled with their unique presentation in staging and concept broke down many barriers. It has been said on the reality dance competition \"So You Think You Can Dance\" that \"The Lockers' emergence on the dance scene changed the face of dance not only for street dancers but for dance in general and has made street dance a true American art form.\"\n\nThe Lockers' many television appearances include \"Saturday Night Live\", \"Soul Train\", \"Carol Burnett\", \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" and \"The Midnight Special\" (Ohio Players performance). They have performed live on stage at Radio City Music Hall, Carnegie Hall, Disneyland, The MGM Grand Las Vegas, Harrah's Reno, and Harrah's Lake Tahoe. The group was animated for their appearance in the 1982 film \"Hey Good Lookin'\" directed by Ralph Bakshi. They appeared in commercials for Schlitz Malt Liquor and Billy Preston's \"Nothing From Nothing\".\n\nFrom 1973 to 1976, The Lockers consisted of the following members:\nThere were alternates who filled in for original members from time to time:\n\nIn mid 1976, three and a half years after the inception of The Lockers, Mr. Berry and Ms. Basil left the group amicably. At the end of 1976, dancer Tony \"GO GO\" Lewis Foster became an alternate member.\n\nAfter The Lockers disbanded, group members continued to find success individually. Both Don Campbell and Toni Basil have received the \"Living Legend of Hip Hop\" award from Hip Hop International.\n\nBasil, who already had a successful career as a choreographer and actress prior to the Lockers, would go on to achieve pop music success with the Grammy nominated single \"Mickey.\"\n\nAdolfo Quinones starred as Ozone in the street dance films, \"Breakin'\" and \"\". He also did the choreography for Madonna's \"Who's That Girl\" tour. His awards include the \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" for outstanding contributions to hip-hop from and the Drama Critic's Circle Award for Best Choreography for the musical \"Standup Tragedy\".\n\nFred Berry would later find greater fame in the role of \"Rerun\" on the ABC sitcom \"What's Happening!!\". One episode would feature a performance by The Lockers (except for Toni Basil). Berry also makes a cameo appearance in Toni Basil's \"Shoppin' from A to Z\" video.\n\nGreg \"Campbellock Jr\" Pope died January 28, 2010.\n\n"}

Beginning in 2004, the trio cultivated a large following when they brought the \"Misshapes Dance Party\" to downtown New York City. The name was taken from the title of a Pulp song, \"\"Mis-Shapes\".\" The party was first hosted at 21 Seventh Avenue South in the West Village of New York City. Geordon and Leigh had to lie about their ages as well as falsify resumes to obtain access to the space at the time.\n\nWith the help of the Internet, the party's popularity grew within the fashion, music and art scene. In 2005, following a performance by Madonna and Stuart Price, Misshapes experienced continued capacity issues and the party was moved to SoHo club, Don Hill's. At its new location, the event, as well as the DJs, enjoyed growing success. Downtown it-kids and celebrities partied together. Creative DIY-style flyers were created and sent around.

The film was produced by Hunt Stromberg for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Based on the 1925 novel \"The Painted Veil\" by W. Somerset Maugham, with a screenplay by John Meehan, Salka Viertel, and Edith Fitzgerald, the film is about a woman who accompanies her new husband to China while he conducts medical research. Feeling neglected by her husband, the woman soon falls in love with a handsome diplomatic attaché. The film score was by Herbert Stothart, the cinematography by William H. Daniels, the art direction by Cedric Gibbons, and the costume design by Adrian. The film earned $1,658,000 at the box office.\n\nAfter her sister Olga marries and leaves home, Katrin Koerber, the daughter of an Austrian medical professor, fights loneliness and dreams of a more exciting life outside Austria. Consequently, when Dr. Walter Fane, a British bacteriologist, asks her to marry him and move to Hong Kong, she agrees, even though she is not in love with him.\n\nAs soon as the newlyweds arrive in Hong Kong, however, Walter becomes consumed with his medical work, and Katrin becomes the romantic target of Jack Townsend, the unhappily married attaché to the British embassy. While showing her the city's exotic sights, Jack flirts with Katrin and kisses her. Katrin, unnerved by Jack's actions, retreats to her house, but soon rejoins him to observe local dancers performing at a Buddhist festival. Stimulated by the dancing and the atmosphere of a Buddhist temple, Jack confesses his love to Katrin, and Katrin admits that she is not in love with Walter.\n\nAt home, Katrin then treats Walter coolly and reveals that his chronic lateness and fatigue annoy her. To make amends, Walter comes home early the next day, but discovers Katrin's bedroom door locked and Jack's hat on a table. That evening, Walter confronts Katrin with his suspicions, and she admits that she loves Jack. Distraught, Walter tells Katrin that he will grant her a divorce only if Jack promises in writing that he will divorce his wife and marry her. When Katrin presents Walter's conditions to Jack, he tells her that a divorce would ruin both his career and his reputation and backs out of the affair.\n\nHeartbroken, Katrin reluctantly accompanies Walter to an inland region of China, where a cholera epidemic is raging. While Walter struggles to arrest the epidemic, Katrin grows more and more despondent and lonely. Eventually, Walter's inundation in the death and destruction wrought by the epidemic causes him to see his resentment toward Katrin as insignificant. He tells her that he still loves her and will end her suffering by sending her back to Hong Kong, while he prepares to leave for a remote river village that has been identified as the root of the epidemic. She replies that although she is still conflicted in her feelings for Jack, she nonetheless now understands what a good man Walter is and that she's ashamed of having cuckolded him.\n\nAfter Walter has left, Jack realizes his genuine love for Katrin and leaves Hong Kong for the inland. Walter returns from the village after ordering it to be burned to combat the spread of the disease. He is overjoyed to find that Katrin has remained to help young cholera victims at a local orphanage, rather than returning to Hong Kong. Walter is knifed in the melee when villagers riot over having their houses burned and Katrin rushes to be near him. While waiting to see her husband, Katrin is confronted by Jack, but tells him that she now loves only Walter and at last understands the sacrifices he makes for medicine. After Jack departs, Katrin assures the wounded Walter that she at last has fallen in love with him.\n\nThis film marks the uncredited acting debut of Keye Luke, who would later found fame as Lee Chan in the Charlie Chan film series, Kato in the Green Hornet film shorts, and Mr. Wing in the Gremlins film series.\n\nThe film grossed a total (domestic and foreign) of $1,658,000: $538,000 from the US and Canada and $1,120,000 elsewhere. It made a profit of $138,000.\n\n"}

The headquarters were in London, United Kingdom.\n\nThe UKeSA was responsible for governing amateur and professional eSports, building a structure with the government, industry and community in mind. These include Metropolitan Police Service, BBC, Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association, Procter & Gamble, Future Publishing, Electronic Arts, Codemasters, The New World Assembly, XLEAGUE.TV, Team Dignitas, Reason Gaming, Team Infused, Fnatic, QuadV and Cadred. The association was launched on 31 October 2008 during the London Games Festival and was chaired by former XLEAGUE.TV channel head Ray Mia. He explained that UKeSA will essentially be the eSports equivalent of The Football Association, offering a centralised infustructure to UK eSports as well as support towards semi-professional and professional team and UK community led projects with the government.\n\nUKeSA set up leagues and cup tournaments, split between three divisions: Open Division, Championship Division and Premiership Division. Each division represents the different levels of competition from amateur to professional and is played online via the internet through the means of a personal computer or a video games console. Teams can compete in a series of video games including \"FIFA 09\", \"Call of Duty 4\" and \"Counter-Strike\". Competition finals of these divisions were hosted at a specially selected venue in the United Kingdom. Teams are gathered to play against each other in off-line, local area network (LAN) setups as opposed to online play in the initial stages of the tournament.\n\n31 October 2008 sees the official launch of the United Kingdom eSports Association during the 2008 London Games Festival in London. The launch party was held at the Haymarket branch of the Sports Cafe.\n\nOn 26 November 2008, it has been announced that several of the following organisations, both private and public sector, have been involved in the setup of UKeSA: Metropolitan Police Service, BBC, Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association, Procter & Gamble, Future Publishing, Electronic Arts, Codemasters, The New World Assembly, XLEAGUE.TV, Team Dignitas, Reason Gaming, Team Infused, Fnatic, QuadV and Cadred.\n\nThe Executive Committee of UKeSA were announced on 12 January 2009.

London\" exhibition at the Olympia Exhibition Centre, London, which takes place in June 2009.\n\nThe governing body signs up to become a member of the International eSports Federation.\n\nIn December 2009, amid controversy, the UKeSA signed for bankruptcy and has since made no attempt to pay back any individual or organisation it owed.\n\nThe UKeSA structure is made up of three key committees and a players union. Each committee plays a vital role in the operations of the eSports Association. So far, only the Executive Committee and the Community Council has been officially announced.\n\nThe Executive Committees purpose is to assist, direct and act as ambassadors for UK eSports to the wider public. The Committee shall be composed of prominent industry, media and government figures and shall include senior representatives from the games industry.\n\n\nThe Community Council consists of six people: Three elected members of the UK eSports community, two permanent Executive Committee members of the UKeSA and one Senior Operational Manager. Originally, the three elected members of the eSports community had to be Team Managers from Championship or Premiership Teams. This was changed to make the Community Council both representative and inclusive of the UK eSports community. However, candidates must be UK passport holders and they must reside in the United Kingdom.\n\nCandidates put themselves up for electoral status and are given an opportunity to state their wishes as to why they should be chosen for the Community Council. Questions are then submitted to the candidates by the public and are then answered by writing or through a live debate broadcast on Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) or web-streaming.\n\nVoting for potential Community Council members are done via public vote and are tallied via electronic means, such as a website. Voters are allowed to vote for 3 candidates and can only choose once per election. Elected members are not able to sit in the Community Council for two consecutive terms, however, they are able to be re-elected after standing down from a single term. No length of time has been given as to indicate how long these terms are.\n\nElected members of the committee are responsible for community related operational and disciplinary matters. These include the enforcement of game, tournament and cup regulations and rules, disciplinary breaches of regulations and conduct, allocation of the seasonal cash retainers, game type and rule suggestions and responsibility for video game specific sub-committees. Attendance is required for Community Committee members through bi-monthly conference calls and physical meetings by attending the General Assembly.\n\nOn 18 March 2009, UKeSA have announced the results of the elections for the Community Council. The following will be sitting in as members of the Community Council for one term:\n\n\nAlso on the board for the Community Council is Ray Mia, who sits in as the permanent Executive Committee members of the Council and Peter Simpson as the Senior Operational Manager.\n\nThe Ethics Commission is charged with defining and updating a framework of ethical principles, including a Code of Ethics & Conduct, based upon the values and principles enshrined in the UKeSA Charter.\n\nThe Players Association is a separate entity that is supported by the UKeSA. This body, once established will be permanently represented on the Ethics Commission.\n\nMeetings are set up between the Executive Committee, Community Council, Ethics Commission, Players Association and other leading figures among the government, the eSports community (such as the International eSports Federation) and video games industry. Held three times a year, these meetings consist of debated issues concerning eSports in the United Kingdom, how they relate to operational aspects of UKeSA and the endorsement of the UKeSA Charter. The General Assembly is invitational only, with permanent membership endorsed by elective procedures.\n\nCompetitions are split into three divisions, some of which will comprise a league and a cup tournament. Each of the divisions represent the different levels, citing grassroots amateur level to the professional level. There are three seasons per year, which last approximately three months per season. Teams from each division can face promotions and relegation depending on how they perform in each of the leagues during the season. Throughout each of the seasons, a trophy cup tournament is held between teams of the Open and Championship Division. Competition finals of the Cup Tournament, Championship and Premiership divisions are hosted at a specially selected venue in the United Kingdom each season. Qualifying eSports teams are gathered to play against each other in offline, local area network (LAN) setups as opposed to online play in the initial stages of the tournament.\n\nThe Open Division represents the grassroots of eSports and form part of the amateur competitions. Playing restrictions are set to a minimum standard and games are played for fun or for practise. Because the Open Division is viewed as the amateur level of eSports, many teams that participate are generally those who have just started or want to determine whether they are suitable at competitive level before moving to the semi-professional side of eSports.\n\nThe Championship Division represents the semi-professional competition level. Teams that choose to play in this division are generally groups who wish to move to the next stage of eSports and play for financial gain. Many of these team are established and may have squads for each individual game/title. Teams can be promoted from this division into the Premiership Division, through participation. Support and training are given to teams to aid their development. Such training includes both management and business elements, which is seen as crucial to building a team into global brand.\n\nThe Premiership Division represents the professional level. Teams are given retainers to support themselves and develop their internal infrastructure as well as business support and training. Teams can be demoted through participation of competitions and must follow guidelines and rules throughout their participation.\n\nA seasonal Cup Tournament is held between the teams of the Open Division and the Championship Division. Teams are required to pay to enter and games are then carried out online. The final remaining teams will face at an offline, local area network (LAN) event. Premiership Division teams are not allowed to enter.\n\nCurrently, there are 13 selected eSports teams that represent the professional level of eSports. These teams participate in the UKeSA Premiership Division and play in different leagues that represent the video games they compete in. These teams are given media coverage through website editorials, terrestrial, satellite and cable television, internet protocol television and podcast. Business, management and financial support are given throughout the season, offering training managerial skills and business development, which will prepare the teams for sponsorships from companies like Dell, Adidas and other major business companies. Retainers are paid to Premiership teams at the end of each season, which will give financial support they need to carry on pushing the team brand as a primary business.\n\nThe number of Championship Division teams are determined by several factors such as paid entry fees and completion of team data like video game user identification tags, with teams submitting themselves for the competition each season. These teams are working towards being promoted into the UKeSA Premiership Division, which will offer the team the support they need to get their brand off the ground. Teams in the UKeSA Championship Division are given limited support for business and management training, while financial support comes from winning the competition.\n\nThere are a total of 17 video game titles currently used throughout the different divisions. They consist from a range of first person shooters, driving simulation, beat 'em ups, real-time strategy, sports simulation and rhythm action genres. Each of the video game titles have some element of competitive online and offline multiplayer modes, which allow the players to play against each other, specifically using competitive gaming rules set by UKeSA.\n\nNew video games titles are added when the eSports community requests for the inclusion in the competition. Titles are first placed into the Open Division to gauge the amount of sign-ups for that specific video game. If enough players register in the Open Division, UKeSA will move to include it into the semi-professional, Championship Division, where eSports athletes will be able to register to play for the prize fund. If a particular video game title is popular enough in the Championship Division, UKeSA will warrant that video game a place in the Premiership Division.\n\nNot all video game titles are suitable for use in a competitive environment as certain video game titles do not allow private sessions hosted by the players via peer-to-peer or server-led gaming rooms. Such games include UbiSoft's EndWar, where online play is restricted to its open Theatre of War lobby system.\n\nThe association was one of the members of the International eSport Federation (IeSF) alongside the following eSports associations:\n\n\nJapan, Bulgaria and China were also looking to join the federation at the GStar 2008 exhibition held in South Korea.\n\nUKeSA filed for bankruptcy whilst owing a large number of teams, players and industry related companies significant sums of money (http://www.cadred.org/News/Article/88207/)\n\nUKeSA are not to be confused by the Electronic Sports Ltd's eSports competitions organized by Richard Millington and Morgan Olsson under the same name from 2002 to 2005.\n\n"}

{"id": "7476563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7476563", "title": "Wolf System stage combat training", "text": "Wolf System stage combat training\n\nThe Wolf System was founded in 1988 by fight choreographer and stage combat/martial arts instructor Tony Wolf. It has been applied to a range of production genres including professional theatre, opera, ballet, film, television and motion capture, notably including \"The Lord of the Rings\" film trilogy, as well as to physical theater, martial arts and self defense training.\n\nThe Wolf System (under the name \"Re:Action\") was originally a collection of techniques adapted from professional wrestling, historical fencing, mime and various martial arts styles. Over time, and due in part to the pedagogical influence of the modern dance discipline of contact improvisation and of the Russian martial art of Ryabko Systema, the Wolf system's emphasis shifted from a curriculum of specific techniques to an open-ended progression of largely improvised training games and exercises.\n\nThe system was first introduced to the international community at the Paddy Crean International Stage Combat Conferences held at the Banff Centre in Alberta, Canada, in 1998. Since that time, aspects of the system have been taught to actors, directors, martial artists, dancers, choreographers and stunt performers throughout New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the U.S., as well as at master-class seminars in England, Ireland, Norway, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany.\n\nThe Wolf System is designed to teach a series of fundamental movement and/or performance skills. \n\nThe skills are divided into the following categories:\n\nSynergy - non-verbal, especially tactile responsiveness and communication \n\nArticulation - cycles of preparation, action and reaction in performing stage combat techniques, both for the safety of the performers and for clarity of live or on-camera performance\n\nIllusion - methods of misdirection and of concealing certain safety measures from the audience or camera to preserve the illusion of actual combat\n\nAlignment - methods of skeletal alignment supported by muscular control as used in maintaining balance and in supporting another person's body weight\n\nExtension - methods of projecting momentum\n\nCascade - methods of safely moving from a standing position to the floor by collapsing or rolling \n\nMeasure - methods of judging the active distance between oneself and another person\n\nOf the above list, both Articulation and Illusion are specific to the use of the Wolf System in stage combat training. The two fundamental premises of the Wolf System in stage combat are defined as Safety and Storytelling, both with reference to performance combat as a skill of theatrical illusion.\n\nSome of the games and exercises may be performed individually while others may be performed in pairs or by groups of up to twenty people. \n\nParticipants in this form of training constantly alternate between co-operating and competing with their partner(s) during different exercises. Co-operative games require the participants to work together to achieve a specific result, such as balancing against each other's bodies while in physically awkward positions or keeping their hands in contact while performing various improvised movement exercises. Competitive games require the participants to work against each other, as in contests of balance and speed.\n\nParticipants also alternate between moving \"in character\" and as themselves, between improvised and choreographed exercises and between assuming active and passive roles during the various exercises.\n\nTo perform Wolf System exercises with a partner or in a group environment is known as jamming, a term borrowed from contact improvisation and from jazz.\n\nThe Wolf System can be used to introduce combative concepts and skills to students who may not have any previous background in fencing, martial arts or related disciplines. Also, the open-ended nature of the exercises allow participants to experiment with a wide range of unusual fighting techniques and styles, including many that are not typically offered in more orthodox stage combat or martial arts training programs.\n\nWolf, Tony: \"Action Design: New Directions in Fight Choreography\".
