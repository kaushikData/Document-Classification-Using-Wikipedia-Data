The film, which follows the all-male sport of 9-man, was produced by a largely female crew, led by first-time director Ursula Liang and editor Michelle Chang. Featured in the film are U.S. volleyball Olympian and NBC commentator Kevin Wong and Chinatown historian John Kuo Wei Tchen. 9-Man also features the now deceased \"mayor\" of Boston's Chinatown, Reggie Wong, who was a leader in the 9-man community.\n\n9-Man was part of the SkyFest series on Virgin America airlines in the summer of 2015.\n\nThe music for the film was written by Adam Rubenstein and Scott CHOPS Jung, the pioneering Chinese-American hip-hop producer and member of Mountain Brothers.\n\nThe documentary follows several modern-day 9-man teams throughout one season framed by a historical portrait of Chinatown history and the game of 9-man. The first act of the film introduces the Boston Knights, Washington CYC (Chinese Youth Club), Toronto Connex and the Boston Freemasons as they begin the season preparing for competition with other teams. As the first act closes you are introduced to a character from New York Haiyan Townsmen, and east coast regional teams compete in the New York Mini tournament crowning an early season favorite. The second act of the film introduces the history of the game—traveling to Toisan (Taishan), China—and its modern day rules, which include limiting participation by players who are not \"100% Chinese.\" The sport and isolation of the game are revealed as direct descendant of the Chinese Exclusion Act and racism faced by the community. The final act of the film unites the characters, teams and conflicts at the NACIVT championship tournament in Boston's Chinatown, setting up Olympian Kevin Wong as the player to beat. As teams fight for the title, they also bring to light the cultural belonging and loss of the modern Chinatown and 9-man community. The film concludes with a scene featuring the funeral of a beloved community member and another scene where 9-man leaders contemplate moving the tournament to a new city—with no Chinatown.\n\n"}

Originally produced, written and emceed by Robert J. Sherman, \"A Spoonful of Sherman\" first served as the UK book launch for Sherman's father's (posthumously released) autobiography: \"\" for which Sherman was also the book's editor. After each performance of that original run, Sherman participated in a book signing after the show. The show was billed as \"A Celebration of the Life, Times and Songs of Robert B. Sherman\" and was received extremely well by the crowd and the critics alike. The cast consisted of four rising West End theatre stars including Charlotte Wakefield, Emma Williams, Stuart Matthew Price and Greg Castiglioni. Musical Direction was provided by Colin Billing and the show was directed by Stewart Nicholls. Lighting was designed by the show's Stage Manager Andrew Holton. In the 2017 version of the show, focus of the show's narrative shifted to both Sherman Brothers' lives as well as to the life of their father, Al Sherman.\n\nThe show was produced by MusicWorld (UK) in association with the St. James Theatre, James Albrecht, Creative Director. Joanne Benjamin and Clive Chenery of The Entertainment Business provided General Management.\n\n\"A Spoonful of Sherman\" received outstanding notices, garnering four stars from Clive Davis of the London Times as well as four and five star reviews from dozens of other papers and online reviewers. The show covered ninety years of Sherman songwriting (including material written by the Sherman Brothers' father, Al Sherman (who began writing music in the early 1920s.) Songs written by the younger Robert Sherman were also included in the show as well) but the focus of the evening was the music and lyrics of Robert B. Sherman and the Sherman Brothers. \"In deciding what songs to select, particular emphasis was put on material that would propel the narrative of Robert B. Sherman's life story forward. My narration would then fill in the gaps. Of course almost all of the famous stuff made it in. \"Mary Poppins\", \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\", \"Winnie the Pooh\" , \"The Jungle Book\" and \"It's A Small World (After All)\" were represented, but I'm particularly pleased that we were able to include some unexpected gems in the mix as well.\" \"A Spoonful of Sherman\" was so successful in its own right, that further shows were scheduled for April 2014.\n\n\"A Spoonful of Sherman\" returned to London, playing August 7 - 20, 2017 at \"Live at Zédel\". Helena Blackman and Daniel Boys starred alongside pianist/singer Christopher Hamilton. Narrating the show once again was Robert J. Sherman. While the book for the two 2014 productions largely remained the same, in the 2017 version, Sherman modified his script, removing emphasis on his father, Robert B. Sherman's life and making the story more about both Sherman Brothers (Robert and Richard) and their Tin Pan Alley era songwriter father, Al Sherman. New musical arrangements were provided by Rowland Lee. Robert J. Sherman explained that changes had to do with the evolution of the show's purpose for being. In 2014 the show was designed merely to serve as a \"happy memorial\" to his recently deceased songwriter father, Robert B. Sherman. But as the show grew, it began to take on a life of its own, the purpose, and therefore, the focus of the show needed to change as well.\n\nOn December 20, 2017, producers James Yeoburn of United Theatrical and Robert J. Sherman announced the launch of the first \"A Spoonful of Sherman\" UK/Ireland. The tour premiered on February 14, 2018 at the EM Forester Theatre in Tonbridge, Kent with its press night held on March 27 in Greenwich. The tour was a radical departure from the previous three productions. The evolution could be described as a morphing from a clever cabaret to a fully realized albeit minimalist, stage musical. Cast members for the tour include Sophie-Louise Dann, Mark Read, Glen Facey, Jenna Innes and Ben Stock. Directing and choreographing is Stewart Nicholls. A new book was devised by Robert Sherman. Stage and costume design is by Gabriella Slade and new musical arrangements and musical supervision is by Rowland Lee. Listed among the first tranche of tour venues are Pavilion Theatre (Bournemouth); Theatre Royal (St. Helens); Tivoli Theatre (Aberdeen); Eden Court (Inverness); Hippodrome (Darlington); Chequer Mead (East Grinstead); Yvonne Arnaud Theatre (Guildford); Theatre Royal (Windsor); Greenwich Theatre (London) Buxton Opera House (Buxton); Swansea Grand Theatre (Swansea); Harrogate Theatre (Harrogate); Atkinson Theatre (Southport); Queens Theatre (Hornchurch); \nShanklin Theatre (Isle of Wight); Riverfront Center Theatre, (Newport); Octagon Theatre (Yeovil); Wyvern Theatre (Swindon); Theatre Royal (Lincoln); Playhouse Theatre (Weston-super-Mare); Northcott Theatre (Exeter); Queens Theatre, (Barnstaple); Theatre Royal, (Dumfries); Beacon Arts Centre, (Greenock); Everyman Theatre (Cork) and Pavilion Theatre (Dublin).\n\n\"A Spoonful of Sherman\" is derived from the title of the popular song \"A Spoonful of Sugar\" from the successful 1964 Walt Disney musical motion picture, \"Mary Poppins\". The song was written by the Sherman Brothers.\n\n\n\nThe double CD, Original London Cast Recording was recorded between July 2014 and February 2015. It was produced by Nicholas Lloyd Webber and mixed and engineered by Matthew Weir at the Palace Studios, located in London. Mastering was produced by Simon Grieff and engineered by Sam Featherstone at Price Recording. The executive producer of the album was Robert Sherman who also wrote and performed the narration and co-conceived the show with musical director, arranger and pianist, Colin Billing. It was released by SimG Records on July 13, 2015. CD available at Dress Circle Reviews of the CD were extremely favorable. The cast recording was released digitally on iTunes September 7, 2015.\n\n"}

Ltd. for the PlayStation 2. The game is the sequel to \"\".\n\nAlthough \"Atelier Iris 2\"s combat system is an improvement from its predecessor's, out-of-battle gameplay is less complex and the alchemy and invention systems were merged.\nBattles are primarily turn-based. The game is unique in having two playable, switchable characters: Felt and Viese. Felt focuses on exploration and battle, and Viese on item creation and support. Only Viese can use alchemy, although Felt collects alchemical recipes.\n\n\"Atelier Iris 2\" has an item-customization and -creation scheme known as alchemy. By obtaining a recipe and the necessary ingredients, items can be synthesized for equipment or to progress in the game. Alchemy is divided into three categories: \"mana\" items, accessories and alchemy items.\n\nEach character is equipped with a weapon and can equip two accessories and two alchemy items. \nAs the player progresses through the game they will obtain a large number of Mana elements, which can be used to synthesize \"mana\" items.\n\nField play was simplified from the game's predecessor. Instead of possessing a number of tools to solve puzzles, each character has the ability to jump and absorb \"mana\".\n\nJapanese voice-overs can be enabled.\n\nFelt and Viese, alchemists-in-training on the floating continent of Eden, are the game's main characters. Viese becomes a full-fledged alchemist, and when she finds Felt at the Belkhyde Gate (a sealed gateway to another world), they go to a forest so Viese can make a pact with an elemental spirit. They find the Azure Azoth, an Excaliber-like sword, and Felt succeeds in pulling it out.\n\nHe hears a voice telling him he must go to Belkhyde (which has been unsealed by the Azure Azoth) because Eden is in turmoil. After parting from Viese, he staggers across the Tatalian desert before collapsing and being found by Noin. Noin claims to be part of the Simsilt, an army fighting to liberate Belkhyde from the Empire. Felt and Noin rescue Max, leader of the Simsilt, from the Riesevelt lighthouse and move to Agito Cove (Simsilt's base). Felt and Viese learn about the Share Ring, which allows a user to send items to another. Hagel (the blacksmith) is recruited, and they are rescued by the dragon man Gray. Felt returns to Agito, travels to the eastern continent and sees the sea for the first time.\n\nDuring the journey to Altena Church, Felt finds the girl who tried to kill him poisoned in a forest. After bringing her to Max's Camp, Viese develops a cure for Fungo's poison. Felt and the others go to Altena Church and are stopped by Chaos, who defeats Felt and Fee and is chased by Gray. When they reach Altena Church, the purposes of the Azoths, Eden and the Gardo Continental Drive are revealed. When Viese finds a map of workshops scattered across Belkhyde, this becomes the focus of the rest of the game.\n\nFelt looks for Chaos, who was not present at the battle. He finds an Altena Nun on the bridge leading to the western continent who tells him that Chaos arrived at Altena Church. When Felt arrives, he finds Mother Eizlen frozen by the Crimson Azoth's spell (which killed Max earlier). Felt fights Chaos in the lower levels of Altena Church (where the Gardo Continental Drive is stored), and is fossilized with the Exzanosis spell. Viese begins to worry about Felt, and follows him to Belkhyde.\n\nAfter the restoration of the Azure Azoth, Felt dissipates the mist which Palaxius spread over Eden. After chasing him to the Temple of Creation, Felt and his friends learn about Iris (the reincarnation of Lilith) and defeat Palaxius. Iris is freed, and everyone finds a place in the world.\n\nSimilar to its predecessor, \"Atelier Iris 2: The Azoth of Destiny\" has several playable characters. Three characters can be in a battle party at once, with the player free to switch the others in and out at any time.\n\n\n\nAs in \"Atelier Iris\", the driving forces behind the game's alchemy are the Mana spirits and Atelier Iris 2 has a greater number of Mana. The Mana and their element are:\n\nIts soundtrack, composed by Ken Nakagawa and Daisuke Achiwa, was released May 18, 2005 in Japan by TEAM Entertainment. The opening song is \"Eternal Story\" by Haruka Shimotsuki, and the ending song is \"Tachidachi no Tobira\" (\"Door of Departure\") by Mami Horie.\n\n\"Atelier Iris 2: The Azoth of Destiny\" received mixed reviews. It received an aggregated score of 69.99% on GameRankings based on 43 reviews and 68/100 on Metacritic based on 34 reviews.\n\n"}

An example in film might be when the audience knows the killer is hiding in the closet while the protagonist does not.\n\nAnother example of audience superior position is the use of dramatic irony.

The audience is aware there is a shark in the film Jaws long before the protagonists accept this fact.\n\nAudience inferior position is when the audience knows less than one or more of the characters in a narrative work. A key example is in murder mysteries, when the detective solves the crime before the audience. If the audience were to solve the crime before the detective, the audience would lose all interest in following the story.\n\nMuch of the time in narrative works, the audience knows exactly as much as the characters they are following, and are not given more or less information by the author.\n\n"}

While helping a Beijing film crew scout for a suburban mansion, he encounters Li Qing (Xu Fan), a former acquaintance house sitting for a wealthy Taiwanese family. Liu convinces Li Qing she lacks the requisite skills to survive in an American city, and buys her an air ticket to fly back to Beijing.

{"id": "56716597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56716597", "title": "Body horror", "text": "Body horror\n\nBody horror or biological horror is a subgenre of horror which intentionally showcases graphic or psychologically disturbing violations of the human body. These violations may manifest through aberrant sex, mutations, mutilation, zombification, gratuitous violence, disease, or unnatural movements of the body. Body horror was a description originally applied to an emerging subgenre of American horror films, but has roots in early Gothic literature and has expanded to include other media.\n\nBody horror falls into one of three \"gross\" genres or \"genres of excess\" which also includes pornography and melodrama. According to film scholar Linda Williams, the success of these body genres \"is often measured by the degree to which the audience sensation mimics what is seen on the screen\". For example, an audience may experience feelings of terror through horror, sympathy through melodrama, or sexual arousal through pornography. Body horror specifically focuses on the limits and transformative capabilities of the human body.\n\nBody horror often overlaps with, but is distinct from, other horror subgenres. For example, while elements of mutilation may be present in body horror, other similar subgenres such as slasher, splatter, or monster horror may also share this trope, but differ in message and intent. A common difference in the body horror genre is that violations or distortions of the body are rarely the result of immediate or initial violence. Instead, they are generally marked by a loss of conscious control over the body through mutation, disease, or other tropes involving uncontrolled transformation. The genre can invoke intense feelings of physical and psychological disgust, or squick, and play upon anxieties of physical vulnerability. In addition to common tropes used within the broader horror genre, some tropes specific to the body horror subgenre may include invasion, contagion, mutation, transformation, disease, mutilation, or other unnatural or violent distortions of the human body.\n\nThe terminology \"body horror\" was first used by Phillip Brophy in his 1989 article \"Horrality: The Textuality of the Contemporary Horror Film.\" He coined this term to describe an emerging subgenre which occurred during a short golden period for contemporary horror film. Although Brophy coined the term to specifically describe a trend within cinema, film director Stuart Gordon notes that the body horror trope had existed prior to its adaptation to the screen, most notably within fictional writing. \n\nMary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\" (1818) is an early example of the body horror subgenre within fictional writing. The success of gothic horror in the 19th century in combination with the birth of science fiction as a literary form is thought to be the origin of body horror as a literary genre. According to Halberstam: \"By focusing on the body as a locus of fear, Shelley's novel suggests that it is people (or at least bodies) who terrify people... the landscape of fear is replaced by sutured skin.\"\n\nCanadian filmmaker David Cronenberg is considered a principal originator of body horror through early films such as \"Shivers\" and \"Rabid\", and his remake of \"The Fly\". However, body horror tropes existed within film prior to official recognition of the genre. Early examples of the body horror genre arose out of 1950s American horror cinema including \"The Blob\" and \"The Fly\", both of which set the standard for the genre due to the films primary focus on bodily mutilation and visceral special effects. Many contemporary films of the horror genre (those produced after 1968), including body horror, are considered to be postmodern in contrast to classical horror. Because of this, delineations between the genres are difficult to define, since postmodernism is concerned with blurring boundaries between categories.\n\nThe body horror genre is widely represented throughout Japanese horror and within contemporary media, such as anime. Katsuhiro Otomo's 1988 film \"Akira\" is an early example of body horror within anime. The film utilizes the genre to explore \"notion of the adolescent body as a site of metamorphosis, a metamorphosis that can appear monstrous both to the figure undergoing it and to the outside world.\"\n\nMany manga authors, or mangaka, such as Junji Ito, specialize in writing within the horror genre and utilize body horror tropes in combination with narrative storytelling devices of Japanese horror. Highly influenced by H.P Lovecraft, Ito's manga depict obscene body horror through both aesthetic and narrative in order to invoke feelings of abject terror. In contrast, Canadian cartoonist Michael DeForge incorporates recurring body horror aspects within his work through less graphic aesthetic and narrative styles.\n\nFilms and media that fall under the body horror subgenre reflect a specific corporeal societal anxiety and may provide social commentary about history and influence contemporary culture.\n\nSince the 18th century, the horror genre has been popular among readers but dismissed as controversial by critics who saw the genre and its thematic elements threatening or dangerous to society. \n\nOwing to the use of graphic and gratuitous violence or themes that may be considered taboo, horror media that fall within the body horror genre are often censored or banned across a variety of countries. For example, the Human Centipede films have been referred to as \"torture porn\" and widely criticized to include overly \"exploitative, gratuitous portrayals of destructive sexual perversion. That assessment was concretized when several countries – including the UK and Australia – officially banned the sequel in its uncut form.\"\n\n"}

Because coins are small, most coin tricks are considered close-up magic or table magic, as the audience must be close to the performer to see the effects. Though stage conjurers generally do not use coin effects, coin magic is sometimes performed onstage using large coins. In a different type of performance setting, a close-up coin magician (or 'coin worker') will use a large video projector so the audience can see the magic on a big screen. Coin magic is generally considered harder to master than other close-up techniques such as card magic, as it requires great skill and grace to perform convincingly, and this takes a lot of practice to acquire.\n\nCoin effects include productions, vanishes, transformations, transpositions, teleportations, penetrations, restorations, levitations and mental magic—some are combined in a single routine. A simple effect might involve borrowing a coin, making it vanish, concealing the coin, then reproducing it again unexpectedly and returning it to the owner. More complex effects may involve multiple coins, substituting or switching coins and other objects or props can be employed (i.e. handkerchiefs, glasses) as well as the coins. However, the power of most coin magic lies in its simplicity and the solidity of the object; the basic skills of sleight of hand and misdirection often appear most magical without complex equipment. Almost any audience will be amazed by the simplest mystery, such as passing a coin through a table.\n\nSome classic coin magic effects:\n\nSome classic coin magic plots:\n\nA sampling of coin sleights and moves:\n\nSome magicians widely known for coin magic include:\n\nAlthough some coin magic use gimmicks (e.g. modified coins or trick coins), such gimmicks usually do not entirely create the magical effect. Gimmicked coins are made by several major manufacturers, such as Sterling, Johnson, Sasco or Tango Magic. Producing a memorable mystery requires significant skill in presenting the effect and utilizing misdirection to distract the audience from the secret of the gimmick. A performer who relies entirely on special equipment may not impress an audience. Many people are more impressed by an effect which depends (or seems to depend) entirely on skillful manipulation and misdirection than by an effect which appears to depend to some extent on specially made props. A performer who has mastered the basic skills can nonetheless use gimmicks to powerful effect without it being obvious to the audience. Some prefer not to use gimmicks at all, though most well-known coin magicians do use simple coin gimmicks.\n\nCanadian novelist Robertson Davies devotes a good part of his \"Deptford Trilogy\" to the art of coin magic. All three novels follow in part or wholly the career of a fictitious magician, Magnus Eisengrim, who was abducted as a boy by a traveling circus and learned his craft while concealed in a papier-mâché automaton. The descriptions of coin magic throughout are remarkable for their clarity. The final novel in the series, World of Wonders, details his life and career.\n\nIn the Neil Gaiman novel \"American Gods\", the main character, Shadow, is experienced with coin magic, and many different tricks and aspects of coin magic are discussed in the book.\n\nIn the Dean Koontz novel \"From the Corner of His Eye\", a police officer uses coin magic to interrogate suspects.\n\nThieves, wizards, and jesters, in historical and fantasy literature are often depicted as being skilled in sleight of hand, and are often depicted doing standard coin magic. Rolling a coin across the knuckles (coin walking) is a popular image. Silk in David Eddings's \"Belgariad\", and Mat Cauthon and Thom Merrilin in Robert Jordan's \"Wheel of Time\" do this frequently. Johnny Depp's whimsical character Jack Sparrow coin walks in the end of Pirates of the Caribbean. Also, Vila Restal in the BBC science fiction television program \"Blake's 7\" mixed his skills as a thief with such tricks.\n\n"}

Soon, she was touring, promoting her book and giving her conversion testimony in churches and at conferences across the United States, dressed in Indian garb.\n\nLater editions of her books, which were published by Moody Press, included a disclaimer that said names, dates, and places had been changed. In 1979, Moody Press took the books out of print due to concerns that the books were not presented as fiction. Stafford said the problem arose due to \"an unfortunate misunderstanding\" between herself and Moody Press, connected to changes in staff and policies at Moody. She maintained that \"Crying Wind\" \"is still based on my life\", and that her mother was indeed raised on a Kickapoo reservation. Her next publisher, Harvest House, stated that it is honest to call \"Crying Wind\" a \"biographical novel.\"\n\nHer book \"Crying Wind\" sold over 80,000 copies, and has been translated into over a dozen foreign languages.\"Indian Life\" has published two of her other books, \"When the Stars Danced\" and \"Thunder in Our Hearts Lightning in Our Veins\" under their imprint, Sequoyah Editions.\n\n"}

Due to the sometimes graphic subject matter, such music was often banned from radio and only available on a jukebox. The style was most popular in the years before World War II, although it had a revival in the 1960s.\n\nMany songs used innuendo, slang terms, or double entendres, such as Lil Johnson's \"Press My Button (Ring My Bell)\" (\"Come on baby, let's have some fun / Just put your hot dog in my bun\"). However, some were very explicit. The most extreme examples were rarely recorded at all. Lucille Bogan's obscene song, \"Shave 'Em Dry\" (1935), being a rare example. It was noted by one music historian as \"by far the most explicit blues song preserved at a commercial pre-war recording session\".\n\nThe more noteworthy musicians who utilised the style included Bo Carter, Bull Moose Jackson, Harlem Hamfats, Wynonie Harris, and Hank Ballard and The Midnighters.\n\nCompilation albums include \"The Copulatin' Blues\" (Stash Records: 1976, re-released Mojo Records: 1996) and \"Them Dirty Blues\" (Jass Records: 1989).\n\n\n"}

She joined The Track in the mid-sixties and was a founding member of The Nocturnes, originally alongside Sandra Stevens (later of Brotherhood of Man) and then Lyn Paul (her future colleague in The New Seekers), recording for UK Columbia Records between 1967-69.\n\nIn 1969 she joined songwriter Roger Cooke for a single release, again on Columbia, called \"Smiling Through My Tears\" shortly before becoming a founder member of The New Seekers in 1969 and was lead singer on the majority of their early hits, including the world wide Number One hit - \"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing\". Other songs that featured Graham as lead vocalist included the US and Canadian smash \"Look What They've Done To My Song, Ma\", the British Top 5 hit \"Circles\", the Japanese No.1 \"The Greatest Song I've Ever Heard\" and the ecologically conscious Roger Cook-Roger Greenaway composition \"We've Got To Do It Now\".\n\nGraham's three-octave range was showcased on several songs, most notably the British and European smash hit \"Never Ending Song of Love\", in which she reached D6. Though mainly a vocalist, she played acoustic guitar on stage in the Chuck Berry-influenced skiffle number \"Good Old-Fashioned Music\" and kazoo in the comic song \"(Ever Since You Told Me That You Loved Me) I'm A Nut\".\n\nIn 1974 the group disbanded and Graham moved onto solo cabaret work, but rejoined a reconstituted New Seekers in 1976 and sang lead on their hits \"It's So Nice To Have You Home\" and \"I Wanna Go Back\". In 1978 she left once more, and again performed as a solo singer, as well as marrying another ex-New Seeker Kevin Finn (known professionally as Danny Finn) on 1 June 1979. They toured as a duo for many years and released one single \"Ocean and Blue Sky\".\n\nGraham retired in 2000 after a last charity performance, and originally said that she could not envisage being tempted out of retirement. In 2005 former New Seekers record producer David Mackay produced a new album with her - \"The Mountains Welcome Me Home\". It was released as a CD and DVD, and contains Scottish traditionals and new recordings of old New Seekers songs. A Christmas themed album, \"Til The Season Comes Round Again\", followed in 2006.\n\nIn 2008, she told \"The Independent\" newspaper that after the band broke up she found work fitting bras, in a branch of Debenhams department store in Essex. She lived in Abernethy, Perthshire with her husband Kevin, who worked for a kitchen and bathroom design company. Kevin died on 22 February 2016 after a short illness. Graham told \"The Independent\" that owing to contractual problems she has not received any royalties since 1973.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "51141048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51141048", "title": "Gray rape", "text": "Gray rape\n\nGray rape or grey rape is sex for which consent is unclear. The term was popularized by Laura Sessions Stepp in her 2007 \"Cosmopolitan\" article \"A New Kind of Date Rape\", which says gray rape is \"somewhere between consent and denial and is even more confusing than date rape because often both parties are unsure of who wanted what\". The term has been criticized. Lisa Jervis, founder of \"Bitch\" magazine, argued that gray rape and date rape \"are the same thing\", and that the popularization of gray rape constituted a backlash against women's sexual empowerment and risked rolling back the gains women had made in having rape taken seriously. \n\nFormer chief of sex crimes for Manhattan district attorney’s office Linda Fairstein states that while \"in the criminal justice system there’s no such thing as gray rape, [it] is not a new term and not a new experience. For journalists, it may be, but for those of us who had worked in advocacy or law enforcement, this description of something being in a gray area has been around all the time.” ConsentEd, a Canadian nonprofit sexual education foundation, dismisses the idea of gray rape, stating that in rape, perpetrators know exactly what they are doing; rape is not an accident.\n\nThe concept was mentioned in Katie Roiphe's 1994 book \"\" where she writes, \"there is a gray area in which one person’s rape may be another’s bad night.\"Roiphe \"...argued that college campus feminists’ activism against rape infantilized women by redefining ambiguously coercive sexual encounters as rape\"; she claims that \"...contemporary feminists’ widening of the definition of rape is a puritanical infantilization of women in the guise of progressive politics.\" \n\nAccording to \"HuffPost\" writer Emma Gray, \"gray sex\" can be defined as \"sex that feels violating even when it's not criminal\"; Rachel Thompson states that \"while these \"experiences might not technically fall under a legal definition of sexual assault\", we \"...use the term \"grey area\" because we do not currently have the terminology to describe these experiences.\" Elsie Whittington stated that this \"...grey area is \"such a tricky topic\" because \"we don't really have a language for talking about it.\" \n\nKatrina Margolis states that there \"...is a space that lies between rape and consensual sex that remains unnamed and undiscussed.\" Margolis states that when a woman has \"...been drinking with a guy, and it gets past 2am, there is a certain expectation of sex if you end up together in a bedroom\"; or, \"after flirting, and inviting a guy home, I didn’t exactly want to have sex, but it was easier [to say yes] than saying no, ...easier to just let it happen.\"\n\nAshley C. Ford described a female roommate's experience with her boyfriends, which she describes as \"just lay there and let them do it\", such as \"...when you come home and you're drunk, or you're too tired, or you don't feel like it, but he's there and he wants to, so you just...kinda...let him\". Ford \"identified... the need for \"more definitive language\" to facilitate nuanced conversations about the \"spectrum of harm\" inflicted on women physically and psychologically as a result of these experiences.\" \n\nIn a \"New York Times\" article entitled “When saying ‘yes’ is easier than saying ‘no,’” Jessica Bennett describes the \"complex situation\" of sexual encounters \"...you thought you wanted, or maybe you actually never wanted, but somehow here you are and it’s happening and you desperately want out, but you know that at this point exiting the situation would be more difficult than simply lying there and waiting for it to be over. In other words: saying yes when we really mean no\", which have been termed “the point of no return,” “gray zone sex,” “begrudgingly consensual sex,” “lukewarm sex,” and “bad sex,” an expression in which \"bad\" refers “not to the perceived pleasure of it, but to the way you feel in the aftermath.” \n\nThe term gray rape was used to describe the 1996 Brown University rape allegation involving students Adam Lack and Sara Klein. According to Lack he had consensual sex with Klein. Klein was apparently unaware the two had sex until days later after Lack asked about the experience. She said she did not remember the incident due to her consumption of alcohol, and 5 weeks later, filed charges. Lack said she not only gave consent, but was the one initiating and that he was unaware she was intoxicated. The charges were subsequently dropped, but Lack received academic discipline as a result.\n\nAfter Laura Sessions Stepp's \"Cosmopolitan\" article, \"A New Kind of Date Rape\", gray rape definition came to include regrettable sexual experiences and decisions made under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Reina Gattuso states that women have sexual \"experiences that feel violating yet ambiguous\", which \"challenge us to think of violence as a spectrum of power and coercion, rather than a simple dichotomy between “good sex” and “rape.”\" Gattuso states that the “gray zone” \"...idea has often functioned as a tactic to minimize or dismiss violence [in couples], and therefore evade accountability, by claiming that sex is inherently a murky, illegible realm.\"\n\nFeminist magazine \"Bust\" defines the expression “gray zone” as \"sex that isn't completely consensual, but isn't sexual assault\" or as an “unwanted sexual experience.\" Amanda Sileo states that the \"gray zone\" was \"...constructed by a society engulfed in rape culture and should not exist\", because \"open communication is missing from so many sexual encounters\" and because \"women feel too unsafe to speak up\". Sileo states that “If you've ever tried to put your finger up a straight guy's ass during sex, you'll know that they actually understand ongoing consent, withdrawal of consent and sexual boundaries very well. They act confused when it's our [women's] bodies.” Sileo states that during an encounter, \"without the enthusiastic consent of your partner for a new sexual activity [when changing activities], you are no longer participating in consensual sex.\"\n\nAn article about a woman (pseudonymously named Grace) \"regarding her sexual encounter with proclaimed feminist actor and comedian Aziz Ansari\" was perceived by the woman as “violating,” telling Ansari the next day via text that “You ignored clear non-verbal cues; you kept going with advances.” Following this story, there was widespread discussion in the media; \"The New York Times\" stated that “Everyone seems to have an opinion about what she did, what he did and whether talking about gray-zone sex, where the man believes that everything that happened was consensual and the woman feels otherwise.\" Writer Anna North states that \"[s]ituations like the one Grace describes, in which a man keeps pushing and a woman, though uncomfortable, doesn’t immediately leave, happen all the time\"; Samantha Bee commented that “We need to set a higher standard for sex.”\n\nThe University of Florida stated that a \"debate has erupted over a particular kind of encounter, one that may not be viewed as sexual assault but which constitutes something murkier than a bad date.\"\n\nIn 2014, Washington and Lee University expelled a student identified only as John Doe for what was described as \"gray rape\" after he allegedly raped a woman identified as Jane Doe. According to the claim, Jane met John at a party in February 2014 where the two had sex; she did not ask him to stop at the time, but later regretted it, reportedly after seeing him kiss another woman. In the summer of 2014 while working at a women’s clinic that helps sexual assault victims, Jane spoke with staff and later reassessed the encounter as rape. Within 21 days John was expelled from Washington and Lee. John Doe later sued the school. In 2015, Washington and Lee filed to dismiss the lawsuit, but Judge Norman K. Moon denied the motion to dismiss allowing John Doe to continue seeking damages from his expulsion believing that John had been the wrongly accused of sexual misconduct. Washington and Lee University ended up settling out of court with the student.\n\nSome reject the idea of gray rape, saying that it promotes the myth that rape can be an accident. They say that consent is consent, and there is no gray area between consent and lack of consent. In Sara Alcid's 2013 article \"Navigating Consent: Debunking the “Gray Area” Myth\", she argues that the “gray area” around sex and consent that \"...we have come to know as an inevitable part of sex and consent is a product of our culture’s less than healthy or communicative approach to sex\"; Alcid states that \"women’s outfits...are [wrongly] perceived as an invitation for sex or a signal of pre-consent\"; \"[f]lirting and acting romantically interested in someone is commonly interpreted [incorrectly] as a desire to have sex\"; the incorrect belief that dating confers \"a permanent state of consenting to sex\", or the myth that being pressured or intoxicated is consent.\n\nSusuana Amoah, who founded the I Heart Consent Campaign, has called for more consent education, including on boundaries: \"To avoid grey areas, it's important that people of all ages are educated about what sexual consent means and are able to have informed wider discussions about coercion, body language and abuse of power.\"\n\nRachel Thompson has called for more \"conversations of grey areas\", noting the wide-ranging discussion over the short story \"Cat Person\" in \"New Yorker\", which examined the \"realm of bad sex\" and the \"reality of terrible sex and its emotional impact\". Conor Friedersdorf stated that \"singling out individuals\"—like Aziz Ansari—isn't an \"effective\" way to explore \"these thorny, noncriminal, nonworkplace flaws in sexual culture.\" Friedersdorf stated that it may be better to discuss the fictional portrayals of sex in movies and TV shows.\n\nKate Margolis states that \"[w]e need to get to the point where saying no is much, much easier. We need to make no-guilt-attached sexual refusal the norm\" and it \"should be easier to say, “I don’t really feel like having sex” without the addition of an adamant push, or a neighbor-alarming yell\"; she says discussing these issues could \"help men to distinguish between genuine enthusiasm and silent reluctance\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2309572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2309572", "title": "Hammocking", "text": "Hammocking\n\nHammocking is a technique used in broadcast programming whereby an unpopular television program is scheduled between two popular ones in the hope that viewers will watch it. Public broadcasting uses this as a way of promoting serious but valuable content. A strong show, followed by a weak show which then is followed by a strong show. This is especially used for new shows. Hammocking may lead to situations where even if programs remain weak, audience rating will be high.\n\nThe main theory in play is that audiences are less likely to change channels for a single time slot. However, it is a concept mainly limited to prime time, where \"appointment television\" is strong. However, there is a risk. If the middle show is weak, the audience could change the channel altogether even if they “would have stayed if the two popular programs had formed a block.”\n\nHammocking has been fairly reliable over the years. It was largely discovered by accident in the late 1950s: Michael Dann is credited with developing the concept after \"December Bride\", thought to be a major hit at the time, underperformed when it lost its lead-in, \"I Love Lucy\". In some cases, the middle show becomes a hit. When the new show becomes just as popular, it has caught on. NBC used this strategy for years with its Must See TV Thursday night schedule, where the strong series on the night, \"Friends\", \"Seinfeld\"/\"Will & Grace\" and \"ER\", provided two half-hour hammock spots in the night where newer sitcoms were positioned in order to provide strength throughout the night and build the network's bench on other nights if they proved successful, though many of the programs were critically derided for poor writing and acting and \"floating by\" on the ratings of other shows (\"The Single Guy\" and \"Union Square\" being the most prominent and higher-rated examples). So dominant was Must See TV, that a common industry joke of that era was the comparison of the hammocked shows to NBC instead placing a test pattern in the half-hour between the end of one top-of-the-hour show and the start of the other, and garnering equivalent ratings for much less effort and cost.\n\nAlso related is the concept of tent-pole programming, or using popular, well-established television shows scheduled in pivotal time periods to boost the ratings of the shows around them.\n\nIn the 2003-04 season, NBC experimented with a new hammocking format with Donald Trump's \"The Apprentice\", which aired between \"Friends\" and \"ER\". \"Much was made of the ratings for \"The Apprentice\", but in truth, even in its protected spot, it lost almost 4 points compared with the \"Friends\" lead-in and 2 points compared with \"ER\". Moreover, when moved to the unprotected Wednesday night slot, it dropped into the bottom third of the ratings.\"\n\nMore recently, ABC has attempted to hammock programming after \"Modern Family\" and a drama after (in this case, either \"Revenge\", \"Designated Survivor\", or \"A Million Little Things\"), to middling or little success. Trying to hammock programs that have little in common with each other can have unusual consequences: TNBC, a block of programming NBC carried during the 1990s that had been aimed at teenagers, had a lead-in from \"Weekend Today\", a news program targeting those teens' parents. By the end of TNBC's run, after the block's teen viewership had declined, the average age of those recognized by the Nielsens as watching TNBC was 41 years old, driven mainly by the lead-in from \"Weekend Today\".\n\nThe Super Bowl has regularly been used as a hammocking opportunity to take advantage of the massive lead-out audience the game produces. See list of Super Bowl lead-out programs for more information.\n"}

She was known for her appearance in one silent film, \"The Lilliputians Courtship\" (1915).\n\nWarren was born at Middleborough, Massachusetts, as Mercy Lavinia Warren Bump, a descendant of a French Catholic family named Bonpasse, of Governor Thomas Mayhew, and five Mayflower passengers: John Billington, Francis Cooke, Edward Doty, Stephen Hopkins, and Richard Warren—New England families which intermarried many times over.\n\nLavinia and her younger sister Huldah Pierce Warren Bump had a form of proportionate dwarfism (considered to be desirable by sideshows and \"museums\" of that era owing to its perfectly miniaturized characteristics, with the same proportions as common larger people) caused by a pituitary disorder which seemingly occurs when close relatives (cousins) descended of identically replicating DNA (twins) produce offspring.\n\nLavinia's parents were 4th cousins, the mother being a 2nd-great-grandchild of married cousins, descended of a twin. The maternal 2nd-great-grandfather of Lavinia's father James Sullivan Bump, Medad Tupper born 1677, was a son of Thomas Tupper and Martha Mayhew. The paternal 2nd-great-grandfather of Lavinia's mother Huldah Pierce Warren, Ichabod Tupper born 1673 who married his cousin Mary Tupper born 1685, was a son of Thomas Tupper and Martha Mayhew. Thomas Tupper was born 16 January 1638 as a twin of Henry Tupper in Sandwich, Barnstable, Massachusetts.\n\nLavinia's family was a long-established and well-respected New England family. Her childhood was entirely normal for the time.\n\nAfter a successful career as a well-respected school teacher, which began at the age of 16, Lavinia went to work as a miniature dancing chanteuse upon a Mississippi showboat owned by a cousin. She enjoyed performing, learned of Tom Thumb's success, alongside the rest of the nation, and pursued a performing career as an adult. Under the management of showman P. T. Barnum, she changed her name from Mercy Lavinia Bumpus to Lavinia Warren, the stage name she had previously used while performing on the Mississippi River.\n\nIn February 1872 she visited England with her husband, sister and Commodore Nutt. They were photographed in Stonehouse, Plymouth, and all four signed the photograph.\n\nRomantically pursued by the tiny entertainer Commodore Nutt, her affections belonged to General Tom Thumb from their first introduction. Lavinia met General Tom Thumb while working in P.T. Barnum's circus. Their wedding was one of the biggest events in nineteenth century New York. She was married in an elaborate ceremony to Tom Thumb on February 10, 1863 at Grace Episcopal Church and the wedding reception was held at the Metropolitan Hotel which included the couple greeting guests from atop the grand piano. Her sister Minnie Warren was her bridesmaid. While admission to the actual wedding was free, Barnum sold tickets to the reception for $75 each to the first five thousand to apply. After Lavinia and Tom were married they both got even more famous.\n\nLavinia and General Tom Thumb were living a life of luxury due to their fame, but this also came with some down sides. Lavinia and Tom were presented as childlike to the public by P.T. Barnum. This was an advertising strategy to make the audience feel sympathetic for them in order to sell more tickets. Though they were some of the most famous people in America at the time, due to the way they were presented, people treated them like children. Many people Lavinia met wanted to pet her and hold her. She wrote in her autobiography \"It seemed impossible, to make people understand at first that I was not a child; that, being a woman, I had the womanly instinct of shrinking from a form of familiarity which in the case of a child of my size would have been as natural as it was permissible.\" Even though Lavinia was not extremely fond of how she was viewed by the public, she still continued to perform. Since Lavinia’s life revolved around her presence in the media, she once said \"I belong to the public.\"\n\nTogether, Tom Thumb and Lavinia Warren became famous, perhaps the most famous public personages of the 1860s. President Abraham Lincoln and his wife provided a reception for the new couple at the White House. Tiffany and Co. gave a silver coach to the couple. They amassed and spent a fortune over the course of their life together which would have made them millionaires by today's standards. They had no actual children, though they did pretend to in the public eye (pictured).\nMinnie, who grew to be high, also married a little person in P.T. Barnum's employ: Major Edward Newell. She became pregnant with a normal-sized child, but excitement was cut short by tragedy on July 23, 1878 when Minnie and her -baby died during the birthing. Several years later, Lavinia and her husband stayed at Newhall House in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and were narrowly rescued by their friend and manager, Sylvester Bleeker, from what had been referred to as \"one of the worst hotel fires in American history.\" Within 6 months, on July 15, 1883, her husband suddenly died at age 45 of a stroke.\n\nTwo years after her husband's death, Lavinia married an Italian dwarf, Count Primo Magri, and they operated a famous roadside stand in Middleborough, Massachusetts. At age 73, she appeared alongside Count Magri in a 1915 silent film, \"The Lilliputian's Courtship\".\n\nWarren died on November 25, 1919 at the age of 77 and is buried next to her first husband with a simple gravestone that reads: \"His Wife.\"\n\n\n"}

In contrast with the first game's modern law enforcement theme, \"Lethal Enforcers II\" takes place in the American Old West.\n\nPorts of the game were released for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive and the Sega CD. The game was bundled along with the first \"Lethal Enforcers\" game as part of the PlayStation compilation \"Lethal Enforcers I & II\".\n\nYears later, Konami released \"Lethal Enforcers 3\".\n\nThe object in the game is to shoot outlaws in order to eradicate crime from a stereotypical Old West town. At the beginning of the game, three to five life units are available. In the arcade version, more can be purchased by inserting additional coins. Life units are also awarded based on how many points the player scores while playing the game. Every time the player is shot or an innocent townsperson or lawmen is shot, one life unit will be lost. The game ends when all life units are gone, but continue play is available.\n\n\"Lethal Enforcers 2\" has five stages: \"The Bank Robbery\", \"The Stage-Holdup\", \"Saloon Showdown\", \"The Train Robbery\", and \"The Hide-Out\". During each stage, the player must shoot the armed outlaws without harming any innocent townsfolk or fellow lawmen. One shot is enough to kill most enemies. At the end of each stage, a boss must be killed in order to complete the stage (though a unique case happened in the third stage where the boss battle is in the form of a dueling mini-game). Just like the original game, a dip switch setting in the arcade version allows operators to let players progress through the stages in a linear fashion (\"arcade mode\") or select individual stages (\"street mode\"), including the between level target practice stages.\n\nThe player's gun (a six-shooter) can carry up to six bullets. To reload, the player must aim the lightgun away from the screen and pull the trigger. Additional weaponry can be found throughout the game that will give the player better firepower: .50 caliber Sharps, rifles, double rigs, shotguns, Gatling guns, and cannons. The Gatling guns and cannons can each be used only once but the other four weapons can be reloaded the same way as the regular gun. If a player is shot while in possession of one of those weapons, the weapon is lost and the player will return to the regular gun.\n\nThere are different ranks that the player can attain, depending on how well the player performs. The ranks are: Posse, Deputy, Sheriff, Deputy Marshal and U.S. Marshal. When the game begins, the player's rank is Posse, and after each stage the player will be promoted, provided they have not killed any innocents. If the player has killed innocents on any stage, they will either maintain their rank or will be demoted. On the Sega Genesis, the accuracy for each stage corresponds to the given rank:\n\n\n\"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave the Genesis version a 6.2 out of 10 average, commenting positively on the two-player mode and variety of weapons. \"GamePro\" gave the Genesis version a perfect score, citing the variety of weapons and their individually distinct firing patterns, sharp digitized sprites, realistic backgrounds, and the quality build and accuracy of the Justifier peripheral, which they felt worked better with \"Lethal Enforcers II\" than with the original game. They gave the Sega CD version a positive review as well, saying that it is generally identical to the Genesis version but has more voices. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave the Sega CD version a 6.6 out of 10, commenting that it has better music and sound effects than the Genesis version, but that the game is far more difficult than the first \"Lethal Enforcers\".\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the Sega CD version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"The graphics aren't good [...] but it's more challenging, since many more of the targets move this time. If you liked it once, you'll like it again.\"\n\n"}

The basic 35 mm anamorphic format originally popularized as CinemaScope has been known by a number of other monikers. In some cases, these names actually refer to different lens designs and technologies implemented; however, the great majority are simply re-branded lenses originally known by another name. In recent decades, it has generally been considered a cliché throwback, and thus the generic name of \"anamorphic format\" has become predominant.\n\nAll of the following trade names refer to the modern SMPTE-standard anamorphic 35 mm format or what was regarded as the standard at that time. Generically speaking, this means a 2× anamorphosis lens with 4-perf negative pulldown for both image origination and projection, and an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 until 1970 (requiring special, narrow \"negative assembly\" splices) and 2.39:1 after 1970 (using conventional \"negative assembly\" splices). The change from 2.35:1 to 2.39:1 (sometimes rounded to 2.4:1 or, mathematically incorrectly, to 2.40:1) was mainly intended to facilitate \"negative assembly\", and also to better hide \"negative assembly\" splices, which otherwise may appear as a slight \"flash\" at the upper edge of the frame, during a splice.

{"id": "2055363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055363", "title": "Master of Animals", "text": "Master of Animals\n\nThe Master of Animals or Lord of Animals is a motif in ancient art showing a human between and grasping two confronted animals. It is very widespread in the art of the Ancient Near East and Egypt. The figure is normally male, but not always, the animals may be realistic or fantastical, and the figure may have animal elements such as horns, or an animal upper body. Unless he is shown with specific divine attributes, he is typically described as a hero, although what the motif represented to the cultures which created the works probably varies greatly. The motif is so widespread and visually effective that many depictions were probably conceived as decoration with only a vague meaning attached to them. The Master of Animals is the \"favorite motif of Achaemenian official seals\", but the figures in these cases should be understood as the king.\n\nThe human figure may be standing, found from the 4th millennium BC, or kneeling on one knee, these latter found from the 3rd millennium BC. They are usually shown looking frontally, but in Assyrian pieces typically shown from the side. Sometimes the animals are clearly alive, whether fairly passive and tamed, or still struggling or attacking. In other pieces they may represent dead hunter's prey.\n\nOther associated representations show a figure controlling or \"taming\" a single animal, usually to the right of the figure. But the many representations of heroes or kings killing an animal are distinguished from these.\n\nThe motif takes pride of place at the top of the famous Gebel el-Arak Knife in the Louvre, an ivory and flint knife dating from the Naqada II d period of Egyptian prehistory, which began c.3450 BC. Here a figure in Mesopotamian dress, often taken to be a god, grapples with two lions. It has been connected to the famous Pashupati seal from the Indus Valley Civilization (2500-1500 BC), showing a figure seated in a yoga-like posture, with a horned headress (or horns), and surrounded by animals. This in turn is related to a figure on the Gundestrup cauldron, who sits with legs part-crossed, has antlers, is surrounded by animals and grasps a snake in one hand and a torc in the other. This famous and puzzling object probably dates to 200 BC, or possibly as late as 300 AD, and though found in Denmark was perhaps made in Thrace.\n\nA form of the master of animals motif appears on an Early Medieval belt buckle from Kanton Wallis, Switzerland, which depicts the biblical figure of Daniel between two lions. \n\nThe purse-lid from the Sutton Hoo burial of about 620 AD has two plaques with a man between two wolves, and the motif is common in Anglo-Saxon art and related Early Medieval styles, where the animals generally remain aggressive. Other notable examples of the motif in Germanic art include one of the Torslunda plates, and helmets from Vendel and Valsgärde\n\nIn the art of Mesopotamia the motif appears very early, usually with a \"naked hero\", for example at Uruk in the Uruk period (c. 4000 to 3100 BC), but was \"outmoded in Mesopotamia by the seventh century BC\". In Luristan bronzes the motif is extremely common, and often highly stylized. In terms of its composition the Master of Animals motif compares with another very common motif in the art of the ancient Near East and Mediterranean, that of two confronted animals flanking and grazing on a Tree of Life.\n\nAlthough such figures are not all, or even usually, deities, the term can also be a generic name for a number of deities from a variety of cultures with close relationships to the animal kingdom or in part animal form (in cultures where that is not the norm). These figures control animals, usually wild ones, and are responsible for their continued reproduction and availability for hunters. They sometimes also have female equivalents, the so-called Mistress of the Animals. Many Mesopotamian examples may represent Enkidu, a central figure in the Ancient Mesopotamian \"Epic of Gilgamesh\". They may all have a Stone Age precursor who was probably a hunter's deity. Many relate to the horned deity of the hunt, another common type, typified by Cernunnos, and a variety of stag, bull, ram and goat gods. Horned gods are not universal however, and in some cultures bear gods, like Arktos might take the role, or even the more anthropomorphic deities who lead the Wild Hunt. Such figures are also often referred to as 'Lord of the forest'* or 'Lord of the mountain'.\n\n\"Potnia Theron\", a phrase used by Homer meaning \"Mistress of the Animals\" is used for early Greek depictions of goddesses, usually Artemis, holding animals. The Greek god shown as \"Master of Animals\" is usually Apollo, the god of hunting. Shiva has the epithet Pashupati meaning the \"Lord of cattle\", and these figures may derive from a Proto-Indo-European deity or archetype. Chapter 39 of the Book of Job has been interpreted as an assertion of the God of the Hebrew Bible as Master of Animals.\n\n\n\n"}

It originated as a private collection in 1916 by Félix Alfaro Fournier, the grandson of the founder of Naipes Heraclio Fournier. It was bought by the government of Álava and was declared \"Bien de Interés Cultural\" in 1984. In 1994, it moved to its current location in the Bendaña palace which it shares with the Álava Museum of Archaeology.\n\nThe Fournier Museum of Playing Cards is located at the Bendaña Palace, whose courtyard is the beginning of this tour. This Renaissance building was built in the first half of the 16th century. In 1525, Juan López de Arrieta ordered its construction on a piece of land belonging to his family, on the place that once was the defensive medieval tower of the old House of Maestu. Although it was built in the middle of the Renaissance, the building shows some elements of the late Gothic period, such as the pointed-arch gate of the main façade at Cuchilleria Street or the starred octagonal vault on the inner stairs. The organisation and the Renaissance decorative shapes are found mainly in this courtyard, which is a typical example of residential palaces of that time, with three floors of open arched corridors.\n\nThe collection of the Fournier Museum of Playing Cards was started by Félix Alfaro Fournier in 1916, when he succeeded his grandfather in the factory after his death.\n\nIn 1984, the Alava Provincial Council purchased the collection, that at that time included approximately 3,400 decks of cards, which they exhibited at the Fine Arts Museum of Alava, located at the Augustin Palace. From that moment, the funds of the collection continued increasing and so did the necessity for a bigger space. So, in 1994, the collection was moved to the Bendaña Palace.\n\nThe originality of this museum lies with its interesting collection and on the few number of museums devoted to playing cards in the world.\n\nThe museum’s permanent exhibition is a small showing selected from among more than 20,000 decks of cards that are part of the funds, coming from different countries, from the five continents.\n\nThe Fournier Museum of Playing Cards offers the visitor not only a historic journey, but also a thematic journey showing the development of playing cards, from the 15th century to the present. Besides decks of cards, the centre also exhibits different machines and other objects used for manufacturing playing cards throughout history.\n\nWe will visit the Palace on a historic, technical and thematic journey through the development of playing cards, from the 15th century to our time.\n\n\n"}

The circus had its most successful years during the Communist Albania era and had difficulties in the 1990-2010 period when its personnel was reduced. The circus has been known to list famous Albanian athletes among its workers.\n\nThe circus was founded in 1952 in Tirana, Albania, by Telat Agolli, Bajram Kurti, Xhuzepina Prendi (Shkurti), Bardhyl Jareci, and Abdyl Karakashi. \n\nThe circus' first performance, \"Shkopi Magjik\", () was staged in 1959. In 1964 the circus started to maintain much higher standards of performance with the premiere of \"Fluturime akrobatike\" (). From 1952 to 1973 the circus operated as part of the Estrada of Tirana; in 1973, the circus split off to become its own company.\nIn 1975 the circus started using a canvas tent for the first time and began to perform in other parts of Albania besides Tirana. In 1977 the \"Drejt lartësive\" () show premiered in Tirana; in that same year a studio started to work full-time on the preparation of new artists by the circus masters. This brought the number of the people working for the circus to more than a hundred.\n\nIn the 1990s, after the fall of communism and with Albania's transitional problems, the circus' staff shrank to almost half of what it had been in the prior decade. The canvas tent started to have problems and it was not repaired until 2000. A United Nations Development Programme project financed some of the circus' activities and by 2010, the Tirana Circus was doing much better than in the 1990s, still being the major circus in the country. However, after the serious financial problems of 1990-2010, the Tirana Circus has been placed under the administration of Albania's Ministry of Tourism, Culture, Youth and Sports.\n\nMany Albanian athletes have emerged from the Tirana Circus, the best known of which are former World Champion weightlifter Ymer Pampuri and Olympic weightlifter Romela Begaj. Weightlifter Ymer Pampuri (born in 1944) started his circus career when he was only 7, the same year the circus was founded, and grew up as an acrobat. Later on he started to practice weightlifting. He stopped competing in 1981 when he was 37, and he returned to circus where he was again an acrobat until 1994, when he retired at the age of 50.\n"}
{"id": "20264914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20264914", "title": "November Steps", "text": "November Steps\n\nIn his early career, Takemitsu had been reluctant to make use of traditional Japanese music in his compositions, as he said this music \"always recalled the bitter memories of war\". He began experimenting with traditional Japanese instruments in the early 1960s, using them in the soundtrack to Masaki Kobayashi's 1962 film, \"Harakiri\". Other film soundtracks in which Takemitsu used traditional instruments include Shinoda's \"Assassination\" and Masaki Kobayashi's \"Kwaidan\" (both 1964). Takemitsu's first concert composition for traditional Japanese musical instruments was \"Eclipse\" (1966) for the \"biwa\" performer, Kinshi Tsuruta, and the \"shakuhachi\" player, Katsuya Yokoyama. When Seiji Ozawa played Leonard Bernstein a tape of \"Eclipse\", Bernstein suggested combining the instruments in a composition with the western orchestra.\n\nOf the title to \"November Steps\", Takemitsu offered two explanations. Taking a literal view of the title, he wrote, \"It was performed in November, and to me that project represented a new step: thus, I titled the work \"November Steps\".\" He further explained, \"In Japanese music, \"danmono\" are the equivalent of western variations, and the word \"dan\" means step. My 'November Steps' are a set of eleven variations.\"\n\nDuring the composition of \"November Steps\", Takemitsu secluded himself to a mountain villa, taking with him the scores to Debussy's \"Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun\" (1894) and \"Jeux\" (1912). At first intending to unite the Japanese and the western musical instruments in the composition, he came to the decision early on that the differences between the two musical traditions were too vast to overcome. On the brink of abandoning the project, he instead decided to make the difference between the two traditions a theme of the work. Takemitsu later wrote, \"It might well be that as a composition it would fail, but I completed the work in order to show as great a difference between the two traditions without blending them.\"\n\nFollowing this line of thought, Takemitsu stated that he did not attempt to integrate the Japanese and western sounds but to display them in juxtaposition to one another, thereby emphasizing their differences. Nevertheless, the work does present correspondences between the two sounds. The plucking of the \"biwa\" with the plectrum is echoed in the orchestra by percussive effects on the strings. The \"shakuhachi\"'s breath effects are echoed by clusters and glissandi in the strings. In this way, Takemitsu creates a harmony between the two instrumental bodies while maintaining their unique sound characteristics.\n\nTakemitsu reported that the natural sounds, such as birds and wind, at first disturbed his concentration. When he began listening to them more carefully, he came to view these sounds as not different from his own music. Later, when listening to \"November Steps\" while working in Africa, the cultural anthropologist Junzo Kawada commented that the sounds of nature did not interfere with the enjoyment of Takemitsu's composition.\n\nThe performers of the New York Philharmonic were openly skeptical of playing with the two Japanese instruments, however, after hearing the first extended passage for the \"biwa\" and \"shakuhachi\", concerns began to wane. Shouts of \"Bravo!\" came from the orchestra after the end of the first rehearsal. The first performance received compliments from Leonard Bernstein, Krzysztof Penderecki, Aaron Copland and other prominent musicians. Takemitsu expressed the view the positive reception of the work was proof that if a sound has value it will appeal to all people, not just to particular nationalities.\n\nShortly after the premier, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, under its conductor Seiji Ozawa, gave \"November Steps\" its second performance in Toronto's Massey Hall. The work was distributed widely in the West when Ozawa and the Toronto Symphony included it on the fourth side of an LP of Messiaen's \"Turangalîla Symphony\" recorded in December 1967. Under Ozawa, this orchestra also gave the work its first televised performance, in a 1970 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation program, \"East-West Concerto\". In 1970, \"November Steps\" also had the distinction of being the only Japanese-composed music performed at Expo '70 when Ozawa conducted it in Suita, Osaka, Japan\n\nThe process of writing \"November Steps\", and its success, resulted in a new direction for Takemitsu's music. Takemitsu wrote that the effort in writing the piece, \"somehow liberated music from a certain stagnation and brought to music something distinctly new and different\". One of the ways in which the work changed Takemitsu's music was in a less traditional approach to musical form, which was replaced with a \"stream of sound\". \"Green\" (1967), composed for orchestra at the same time as \"November Steps\", is more conventional, shows the influence of the two Debussy scores in a more direct way than does \"November Steps\". In contrast, \"November Steps\" does not adhere to traditional western concepts of musical form, but takes the view that each sound is the focus of attention.\n\n"}

Many workers operate using newspaper advertisements, mobile phones and secondary rented apartments, some accept credit cards. \n\nIn Switzerland, prostitution has been legal since 1942.\n\nIn 1992, the sexual criminal law was revised, since then pimping and passive soliciting are no longer punishable.\n\nThe Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons between Switzerland and the EU of 21 June 1999, which was extended to Romania and Bulgaria in 2009, resulted in an increase in the number of prostitutes in the country. \n\nIn 2013, \"sex boxes\" were erected in the Altstetten district of Zurich (such as Strichplatz Depotweg) and one street where street prostitution was allowed was closed. In the same year, street prostitutes in Zurich had to buy nightly permits from a vending machine installed in the area at a cost of 5 francs.\n\nIn January 2014, it was publicly announced that inmates of La Pâquerette, a social therapy department for prisoners, were allowed to visit prostitutes in the Champ-Dollon detention center near Geneva, accompanied by social therapists.\n\nAs well as Federal law, individual Cantons may also make additional provisions in the form of legislation or regulations.\n\nStreet prostitution is illegal, except in specially designated areas in the major cities.\n\nArticle 182 of the Swiss Criminal Code is designed to combat human trafficking, Article 195 limits the power pimps can have over prostitutes. Swiss prostitutes are self-employed: regular employment requirements such when and where to work would make the employer likely to be in breach of article 195.\n\nIt is legal to advertise for \"massages\" in Swiss tabloid newspapers. \n\nSwiss sex workers are subject to taxation and social insurance contributions.\n\nForeigners sex worker from the European Union can obtain permission to work for 90 days as a prostitute if they present themselves to the city authorities, undergo a police interview, and provide proof of a health insurance plan.\n\nFull service sex work is only legal if the seller is over 18 years of age, and it is a criminal act to pay for sex with anyone who is under 18 years old. This age was raised from 16 (the country's age of sexual consent) in 2013 to bring the country in line with a Council of Europe treaty signed in 2010. The maximum sentence for those who pay for sex with 16-year-old or 17-year-old prostitutes is three years in prison. The maximum sentence for pimping anyone under 18 is ten years in prison. (see Article 196 of the Criminal Code of Switzerland ).\n\nThe local authorities in Zurich installed carport-like constructions called \"Verrichtungsboxen\" or 'sex boxes' to protect street based sex workers. In 2012, voters approved the creation of \"sex boxes\" in Zurich to control suburban sex work. These were been described as a \"success\" by local authorities after a year but a number of sex workers who have seen their earnings decline, disagree. The measure has been criticised by several organisations as restrictive.\n\nThere are red-light districts in most of the major Swiss cities: Zurich (Langstrasse}; Bern {Lorraine}; Geneva (Les Pâquis); Lausanne (Sevelin) and Lugano (Loreto).\n\nSwitzerland is primarily a destination and, to a lesser extent, a transit country for women, children, and transgender people subjected to sex trafficking. Foreign trafficking victims originate primarily from Central and Eastern Europe—particularly Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, with increasing numbers from Nigeria and Thailand. Victims also come from China, Brazil, Cameroon, and the Dominican Republic. The number of victims among asylum-seekers continues to grow. Female victims among asylum-seekers came from Nigeria, Eritrea, and Ethiopia, and were often forced into prostitution. Male victims among asylum-seekers came primarily from Eritrea and Afghanistan and were exploited in prostitution.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Switzerland as a 'Tier 1' country.\n\n"}

Records and slides were sold for it in combination (known as Picturesound\nprograms). The slide strips, a flat plastic key 11 inches long\ncontaining a strip of 16mm color film, was inserted into the top of the device. As the record played (typically telling a story), the slide strip, through which the images were projected on the screen, would automatically advance to illustrate it. The mechanism by which the slide advanced was purely mechanical, and was based on the rotation of the turntable, so proper operation required manually spinning it a few revolutions before beginning the presentation. The original selling price of the unit was $29.95\nand Picturesound programs sold for 99 cents with \"a library of five programs\" selling for $4.95.\n\nThirty-five programs were grouped in seven \"libraries\" initially:\n\n\nLicensed film strip and record packages were produced for many different children's properties, including Disney and Sesame Street. An advertisement in LIFE Magazine also specifically mentions Pinocchio, Peter Pan, and the Wizard of Oz \"as well as educational programs created by World Book Encyclopedia.\" By 1965, there were 140 programs available.

{"id": "1408745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1408745", "title": "Stage (theatre)", "text": "Stage (theatre)\n\nIn theatre and performing arts, the stage (sometimes referred to as the deck in stagecraft) is a designated space for the performance of productions. The stage serves as a space for actors or performers and a focal point (the screen in cinema theaters) for the members of the audience. As an architectural feature, the stage may consist of a platform (often raised) or series of platforms. In some cases, these may be temporary or adjustable but in theaters and other buildings devoted to such productions, the stage is often a permanent feature.\n\nThere are several types of stages that vary as to the usage and the relation of the audience to them. The most common form found in the West is the proscenium stage. In this type, the audience is located on one side of the stage with the remaining sides hidden and used by the performers and technicians. Thrust stages may be similar to proscenium stages but with a platform or performance area that extends into the audience space so that the audience is located on three sides. In theatre in the round, the audience is located on all four sides of the stage. The fourth type of stage incorporates created and found stages which may be constructed specifically for a performance or may involve a space that is adapted as a stage.\n\nSince the Italian Renaissance, the most common stage used in the West has been the proscenium stage which may also be referred to as a \"picture frame stage\". The primary feature is a large opening known as the proscenium arch through which the audience views the performance. The audience directly faces the stage—which is typically raised several feet above front row audience level—and views only one side of the scene. This one side is commonly known as the invisible \"fourth wall\" of the scene. The proscenium arch evolved from the \"proskenium\" in Ancient Greek theaters. This was the space in front of the \"skênê\" or backdrop where the actors actually played.\n\nThe first indoor theatres were created in French tennis courts and Italian Renaissance palaces where the newly embraced principles of perspective allowed designers to create stunning vistas with buildings and trees decreasing in size toward a \"vanishing point\" on the horizon. Stage floors were raked upward slightly from front to back in order to contribute to the perspective illusion and also to make actors more visible to audiences, who were seated on level floors. Subsequently, audience seating was raked, and balconies were added to give audiences a fuller view. By the end of the 19th century most stages had level floors, and much of the audience looked down on, rather than up to, the stage.\n\nThe competition among royals to produce elegant and elaborate entertainments fueled and financed the expansion of European court theatres. The proscenium—which often was extremely decorative in the manner of a triumphal arch—\"framed\" the prospective picture. The desire of court painters to show more than one of their perspective backgrounds led court architects to adapt the pin-rails and pulleys of sailing ships to the unrolling, and later to the lowering and raising, of canvas backdrops. A wood (and later steel) \"grid\" above the stage supported pulleys from which wooden battens, and later steel pipes, rolled down, or descended, with attached scenery pieces. The weight of heavy pieces was counterbalanced by sandbags. This system required the creation of a storage \"stage house\" or \"loft\" that was usually as high or higher than the proscenium itself. A \"full-fly\" stage could store the entire height of scenery above the visible stage using the pin-rails before or during performance, whereas a \"half-fly\" stage (common in smaller locations) could only store props of limited size and thus required more careful backdrop and scenery design. Theatres using these rope systems, which are manually operated by stage hands, are known as \"hemp houses\". They have been largely supplanted by counterweight fly systems.\n\nThe proscenium, in conjunction with stage curtains called \"legs\", conceals the sides of the stage, which are known as the \"wings\". The wings may be used by theatre personnel during performances and as storage spaces for scenery and theatrical properties. Several rows of short curtains across the top of the stage, called \"teasers,\" hide the backdrops, which in turn are hidden above the stage in the fly system loft until ready for use.\nOften, a stage may extend in front of the proscenium arch which offers additional playing area to the actors. This area is a referred to as the apron. Underneath and in front of the apron is sometimes an orchestra pit which is used by musicians during musicals and operas. The orchestra pit may sometimes be covered and used as an additional playing space in order to bring the actors closer to the audience. The stage is often raised higher than the audience. Space above some proscenium stages may include a flyloft where curtains, scenery, and battens supporting a variety of lighting instruments may hang.\n\nThe numerous advantages of the proscenium stage have led to its popularity in the West. Many theatrical properties and scenery may be utilized. Backdrops, curtains and lighting can be used to greater effect without risk of rigging being visible to the audience. Entrances and exits can be made more graceful; surprise becomes possible. The actors only have to concentrate on playing to the audience in one direction.\n\n\"Boxes\" are a feature of more modern stage designs in which temporary walls are built inside any proscenium stage, at a slight angle to the original walls, in order to allow audience members located to the left or right of the proscenium (the further out, the larger the angle) to see the entirety of the stage. They enable the creation of rat runs around the back of the stage, which are when cast members have to walk between entrances and exits without being seen by the audience.\n\nThis type of stage is located in the centre of the audience, with the audience facing it from all sides. The audience is placed close to the action, which provides a feeling of intimacy and involvement.\n\nIn-the-round stages require special considerations in production, such as:\n\n\nA thrust stage is one that extends into the audience on three sides and is connected to the backstage area by its upstage end. A thrust has the benefit of greater intimacy between the audience and performers than a proscenium, while retaining the utility of a backstage area. Entrances onto a thrust are most readily made from backstage, although some theatres provide for performers to enter through the audience using vomitory entrances. An arena, exposed on all sides to the audience, is without a backstage and relies entirely on entrances in the house or from under the stage.\n\nAs with an arena, the audience in a thrust stage theatre may view the stage from three or more sides. If a performance employs the fourth wall, that imaginary wall must be maintained on multiple sides. Similar to theatre in the round, the audience can view the performance from a variety of perspectives, and as such it is usual for the blocking, props and scenery to receive thorough consideration to ensure that no perspective is blocked from view. A high backed chair, for instance, when placed stage right, could create a blind spot in the stage left action.\n\nA black box theater consists of a simple, somewhat unadorned performance space, ideally a large square room with black walls and a flat floor, which can be used flexibly to create a stage and audience area.\n\nA stage can also be improvised where ever a suitable space can be found. Examples may include staging a performance in a non traditional space such as a basement of a building, a side of a hill or, in the case of a busking troupe, the street. In a similar manner, a makeshift stage can be created by modifying an environment. For example, demarcating the boundaries of a stage in an open space by laying a carpet and arranging seating before it. The theater company Shakespeare In The Park, in fact, is based around performing Shakespeare plays in a space that one wouldn't likely find it, namely, Central Park in New York City. \n\nThe stage itself has been given named areas to facilitate the precise movement and positioning of actors on a stage (see Blocking (stage)).\n\nTo an actor facing the audience, \"left\" and \"right\" are the reverse of what they are for the audience. To prevent confusion, actors and directors never use the unmarked terms \"left\" or \"right\" for the sides of the stage. Rather, they use a phrase specifying the viewpoint. The terms \"stage left\" and \"stage right\", respectively, denote the sides of the stage that are on the actor's left and right when the actor is facing the audience, while \"house left\" and \"house right\" are the reverse, denoting the sides of the stage as viewed by the audience. In Germany, stage right and left are reversed, being the director's view rather than the actor's.\n\nLess ambiguous terms used in theatres that follow a British tradition are \"Prompt Side\" or \"P Side\" (Stage left) and \"Off-Prompt\" or \"O.P. Side\" (Stage Right), relating to the traditional location of the Stage Manager.\n\nLikewise, the meaning of \"front\" and \"back\" would be unclear because they depend on perspective. Instead, the term \"upstage\" is used to denote the part of the stage furthest from the audience or to motion away from the audience, while \"downstage\" denotes the portion of the stage closest to the audience or to motion in that direction. These terms were common in older theatres, which gave the audience a better view of the action by inclining the floor (known as a raked stage), so upstage actually was at a higher elevation than downstage.\n\nA raked stage can vary in its incline; ten degrees is considered ideal for the audience and actor comfort. A dancing surface incline is often different from an acting incline and can vary from three degrees to twenty degrees.\n\n"}

{"id": "180233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=180233", "title": "Theatre in the round", "text": "Theatre in the round\n\nA theatre in the round, arena theatre or central staging is a space for theatre in which the audience surrounds the stage.\n\nThe Glenn Hughes Penthouse Theatre in Seattle, Washington was the first theatre-in-the-round venue built in the United States. It first opened on May 19, 1940 with a production of \"Spring Dance\", a comedy by playwright Philip Barry. The 160-seat theatre is located on the campus of the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington, and is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn 1947, Margo Jones established America's first professional theatre-in-the-round company when she opened her Theater '47 in Dallas.\n\nThe stage design as developed by Margo Jones was used by directors in later years for such well-known shows as the Tony award winning musical Fun Home, the original stage production of \"Man of La Mancha,\" and all plays staged at the ANTA Washington Square Theatre (demolished in the late 1960s), including Arthur Miller's autobiographical \"After the Fall\". Such theatres had previously existed in colleges, but not in professional spaces for almost two millennia. It is also a popular setup used in contemporary pop concerts in an arena or stadium setting.\n\nThe stage is always in the centre with the audience arranged on all sides, and is most commonly rectangular, circular, diamond, or triangular. Actors may enter and exit through the audience from different directions or from below the stage. The stage is usually on an even level with or below the audience in a \"pit\" or \"arena\" formation.\n\nThis configuration lends itself to high-energy productions and anything that requires audience participation. It is favoured by producers of classical theatre and it has continued as a creative alternative to the more common proscenium format.\n\nIn effect, theatre-in-the-round removes the fourth wall and brings the actor into the same space as the audience. This is often problematic for proscenium or end stage trained actors who are taught that they must never turn their backs to the audience, something that is unavoidable in this format. However, it allows for strong and direct engagement with the audience.\n\nIt is also employed when theatrical performances are presented in non-traditional spaces such as restaurants, public areas such as fairs or festivals, or street theater. Set design is often minimal in order not to obscure the audience's view of the performance.\n\nTheatre-in-the-round was common in ancient theatre, particularly that of Greece and Rome but was not widely explored again until the latter half of the 20th century.\n\nIn Margo Jones' survey of theatre-in-the-round, the first two sources of central staging in the United States she identified were the productions by Azubah Latham and Milton Smith at Columbia University dating from 1914, and T. Earl Pardoe's productions at Brigham Young University in 1922.\n\nIn 1924, Gilmore Brown founded the Fair Oaks Playbox in Pasadena, California, an important early practitioner of central staging in addition to other stage configurations that it pioneered in its advent of flexible staging. As Indicated by Jones, the centrally staged productions of the Fair-oaks Play box were followed approximately eight years later by the work of Glenn Hughes in his Seattle Penthouse.\n\nStephen Joseph was the first to populise the form in the United Kingdom from the US in the 1950s and set up theatres-in-the-round in Newcastle-under-Lyme and the Studio Theatre in Scarborough. The current theatre, opened in 1996, is known as the Stephen Joseph Theatre. Joseph was reputed to have once rhetorically asked, \"Why must authorities stand with their back to a wall?\" His answer was: \"So nobody can knife them from behind.\"\n\nSam Walters set up an impromptu performance space in the upstairs of the Orange Tree pub in Richmond, London in the early 1970s and subsequently moved across the road to a permanent Orange Tree Theatre.\n\nIn 1972, RG Gregory set up the Word and Action theatre company in Dorset in England to work exclusively in theatre-in-the-round. Gregory sought to create a grammar that would enable actors to maximise the form's potential for connecting with the audience both as individuals and as a collective. All Word and Action productions were performed in normal lighting conditions, without costumes or makeup.\n\nThe innovations of Margo Jones were an obvious influence on Albert McCleery when he created his \"Cameo Theatre\" for television in 1950. Continuing until 1955, McCleery offered dramas seen against pure black backgrounds instead of walls of a set. This enabled cameras in the darkness to pick up shots from any position.\n\nRichard Nixon's 1968 U.S. Presidential campaign staged nine live televised question and answer sessions using a ground-breaking theatre-in-the-round format, adapted for a live televised audience. The first time use of the staging device was memorialized in the book, \"The Selling of the President 1968\" by Joe McGinniss . The producer of these Nixon \"Man in the Arena\" programs was Roger Ailes , who later went to on start FOX News . Ailes' innovation of the theatre-in-the-round format for candidate forums became the blueprint for modern \"town hall\" candidate formats and even multiple-candidate debates.\n\nElvis Presley's \"'68 Comeback Special\" TV programme was performed with the musicians seated using a raised staging in-the-round format.\n\nWhen an arena staging was conceived for the progressive-rock group Yes by their tour manager Jim Halley in the mid-1970s, it prompted a redesign of rock concerts and venue seating arrangements.\n\nThe politics of theater-in-the-round were explored most deliberately by RG Gregory. In his view the lit space of a proscenium arch is analogous to the seat of power; the audience adopts the role of passive receivers. In traditional theatre design, maximum care is taken with sight lines in order to ensure that the actor can engage every member of the audience at the same time.\n\nHowever, once removed from the picture frame of the arch, the actors are compelled to turn their back on some members of the audience and so necessarily lose exclusive command of the acting space. All members of the audience can see the actor, but the actor can no longer see all of them. At this point, in order for the play to function, the audience themselves must be allowed to become key conductors of the meaning of the performance.\n\nSome, like the writer Mick Fealty, have stressed a close analogy between Gregory's description of the rudimentary dynamics of theater-in-the-round with the network effect of Internet-based communication in comparison to traditional broadcast and marketing channels.\n\nGeorge Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia is home to the largest arena stage archive and contains material from the theatre's 50-year history. Included in the collection are photographs, production notebooks, scrapbooks, playbills, oral histories and handwritten correspondence. According to their website, the total volume is or linear and is housed in the Fenwick Library.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25373878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25373878", "title": "Twice Through the Heart", "text": "Twice Through the Heart\n\nTwice Through the Heart is a musical work by the English composer Mark-Anthony Turnage, variously described as a dramatic \"scena\", as a monodrama, as a song cycle, as a chamber opera or even as a \"dramatic song-cycle-cum-scena\". It is scored for mezzo-soprano and 16 instrumentalists and sets an English-language libretto by the Scottish poet Jackie Kay based on her script for a television programme about a woman jailed for killing her violent husband.\n\nOriginally intended to be a full-length opera, \"Twice\" was composed between 1994 and 1996, undergoing substantial reworking before Turnage found a form with which he was satisfied. It was first performed in 1997 when it was put on both in the concert hall and in the opera house. The critical reception has been generally favourable, with several authors commenting positively about the instrumental writing and emotional impact of the work, though some critics see limitations in the libretto, find the mood of the work too unrelenting or note the great demands that the vocal writing provides for the soloist.\n\n\"Twice Through the Heart\" is based on a 1992 poetry documentary of the same name that Kay had written for the BBC television series \"Words on Film\". Kay was concerned by inequalities in how the legal system treats men and women who kill their spouses and, in particular, in how the law on provocation in the United Kingdom was then interpreted, allowing a defence to murder only in the context of what happened immediately before a homicide and excluding the battered woman defence which considers the broader context which may have involved years of violent abuse. She chose to base the poems on a specific true case, that of Amelia Rossiter, a woman in her sixties who refused to give evidence in court about the years of violence from her husband that eventually led to her stabbing him twice through the heart with a kitchen knife. By the time Kay's programme was broadcast, Rossiter had been freed, her conviction reduced to manslaughter after her plea of provocation was accepted.\n\nTurnage, who had previously composed one full-length opera, \"Greek\", worked on the musical version of \"Twice\" between 1994 and 1996. It was commissioned by the John S. Cohen Foundation. He had learnt of Kay's original work after he was shown a copy of the BBC video by poet and artistic director Maura Dooley. It was a difficult development with Turnage at one point abandoning the work in favour of other pieces. Composer and librettist had started out with the intention of developing a full-length opera including both soprano and baritone narrators. (The original television script had included poems for the judge as well as for the woman.) However, the creators felt that their attempts at redeveloping and expanding the original work \"water[ed] down its impact\" and they eventually cut everything apart from the woman's words. Both text and setting also underwent repeated changes in detail. Kay changed some of the wording to make it easier to sing. Similarly, Turnage revised the music after trying it out with Sally Burgess who was to give the first performance. He had become Composer in Association with English National Opera (ENO) in 1995 and was able to thoroughly workshop \"Twice\" and its companion piece with ENO's Contemporary Opera Studio before arriving at their respective final versions.\n\n\"Twice Through the Heart\" lasts for approximately 30 minutes. It consists of nine musical numbers arranged in three sections. It is narrated by a woman in the prison cell where she has been sent for the murder of her husband. To express the woman's feelings, Kay deliberately chose a voice that was unpoetic: \"I wanted the voice to be so everyday, it would be banal.\" Turnage's music too includes similarly basic material, what critic Tom Service describes as \"simple hummable tunes\", but these are transformed and distorted, a metaphor for how initial loving intimacy is destroyed and distorted by years of violence and abuse. Turnage's musical language is modernist but influenced by jazz, an area of musical interest he shared with Kay.\n\nThe instrumental scoring is for flute (doubling alto flute), oboe (doubling cor anglais), 2 clarinets (one doubling bass clarinet), horn, trumpet, trombone, one percussionist, harp, piano (doubling celeste), violin, 2 violas, 2 cellos and double bass. The percussion consists of 8 crotales, vibraphone, marimba, suspended cymbal, 3 gongs, tam-tam, bass drum, pedal bass drum, ratchet, claves and whip.\n\n1. \"No Way Out\" — The woman tells of how her husband beat her and threatened to garotte her with a towel and of how she picked up a kitchen knife to defend herself.<br>\n2. \"Inside (part 1)\" — The woman is in jail thinking of how she failed to take her lawyer's advice to give evidence about her husband's violence, because she did not want to be disloyal.<br>\n3. \"Love\" — She remembers how she and her husband once loved each other and how things went wrong after their child was born.\n\n4. \"By the Sea\" — She thinks of how she felt trapped in their house by the sea because she could not talk of his violence.<br>\n5. \"Inside (part 2)\" — She thinks of her husband and of her \"heart, broken like bones\".<br>\n6. \"Four Walls\" — She is trapped within the four walls of her house, her husband turning down suggestions of holidays and writing instructions for her in notes.\n\n7. \"Interlude\" — Instrumental section.<br>\n8. \"Landslide\" — Her husband is buried in land, she in prison.<br>\n9. \"China Cup\" — She is locked in with only the decorated china cup which she has taken from home to prison.\n\n\"Twice Through the Heart\" was first performed on 13 June 1997 at the Snape Maltings Concert Hall during the 50th Aldeburgh Festival. Sally Burgess was accompanied by the ENO Contemporary Opera Studio conducted by Nicholas Kok. The companion piece was the chamber opera \"The Country of the Blind\" which Turnage had composed relatively quickly in order to make up a full programme after \"Twice\" had turned out much shorter than originally intended. To Turnage's surprise, ENO decided to follow up the original four performances, split between Snape Maltings and the Queen Elizabeth Hall, with a staging at its main home in the London Coliseum. This production was premiered on 20 October 1997 with Susan Bickley as the soloist and with Kok again conducting. In this context it was a companion piece for \"From the House of the Dead\", an opera set in a Siberian prison camp.\n\n\"Twice\" had received its mainland European premiere a day earlier than the first Coliseum performance, when it was given by the State Opera in Gießen, Germany. In 1998, \"Twice\" received its North American premiere in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada and was also given in the United States, (by the New York Philharmonic,) Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands. In these last two countries composer Oliver Knussen conducted. The work has continued to receive international performances, for example by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 2009.\n\nA commercial recording was made in 2007 with Sarah Connolly singing and Marin Alsop conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Some live performances have been recorded for broadcast, including one at the Queen Elizabeth Hall with the original performers, and the Winnipeg performance.\n\nIn reviewing the first performance for \"The Independent\", Nick Kimberley felt that the \"Twice Through the Heart\" \"w[ore] the scars of a difficult birth\" with Sally Burgess \"strain[ing] to find specific expression in the sharp angles and steep slides Turnage provided\" in a work that Kimberley considered less natural than its relatively quickly written companion piece. For this critic, the instrumental writing came over far more successfully than the vocal part with Kimberley praising the use of colour and finding the \"draining\" final climax particularly effective. Michael Kennedy, in contrast to Kimberley, found the \"scena\" \"the more dramatic and musically more inventive\" of the two works performed that night.\n\nBernard Holland, of \"The New York Times\" heard both the Aldeburgh and New York premieres. He noted the influence both of Alban Berg and, in the strings and percussion, of rock music and appreciated a musical language that makes modernism easier on the ears. However, he felt a degree of ambivalence about a composer he described as \"theatrical... in both the good and bad senses of the word.\"\n\nGeoff Brown, reviewing Marin Alsop and Sarah Connolly's recording in \"The Times\", praised the directness of both Kay's and Turnage's writing and described \"Twice Through the Heart\" and its \"awful clarity\" as \"among the best in Turnage's recent output\". David Gutman suggested in \"Gramophone\" that \"if listeners feel uncomfortable with the mix of artful delivery and documentary realism, that may be part of the intended effect.\" The critics of \"The Daily Telegraph\" were later to list this disc among the hundred best classical recordings.\n\nJohn von Rhein of the \"Chicago Tribune\" noted the trickiness of the solo part and criticised the \"banality\" of Kay's verse but reported that he \"was held by the sensitive lyrical, rather Bergian vocal writing and often translucent scoring\". \"The woman's suppressed anger and fear rise to the surface through Turnage's music — poignant gritty yet always compassionate.\" Considering the same Chicago performance, freelance music critic Lawrence A. Johnson, was taken by the use of instrumental colour and also by Turnage's \"whipcrack rhythmic vitality\", but \"If \"Twice through the Heart\" [sic] just misses being one of Turnage's top-drawer works, it's because of the somewhat unvaried air of doleful melancholy as well as the text's more pedestrian moments and repetition.\"\n\nNot all critics have been hostile to Kay's poetry: reviewing a concert by the London Sinfonietta, Nicholas Williams refers to her \"arresting text\". Whether positive or negative, the music critics only assessed part of Kay's original work. In considering the original television version of \"Twice\", the literary critic Laura Severin, praised the contrasted voices and the use of repetition as an adaptation to a medium where listeners would be less attentive to the words than if they were attending a conventional poetry reading. She also saw Kay's portrayal of Rossiter as one that avoided both a conventional masculine representation of her as a ruthless murderer and an overly simplistic feminist one of her as a passive victim.\n"}
{"id": "31526583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31526583", "title": "United States v. Scheinberg", "text": "United States v. Scheinberg\n\nUnited States v. Scheinberg, 10 Cr. 336 (2011), is a United States federal criminal case against the founders of the three largest online poker companies, PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and Cereus (Absolute Poker/Ultimatebet), and a handful of their associates, which alleges that the defendants violated the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) and engaged in bank fraud and money laundering to process transfers to and from their customers. A companion civil case, United States v. PokerStars, et al., 11 Civ. 2564 (2011), included Full Tilt and Cereus as defendants and seeks the recovery of forfeiture equalling approximately $3 billion in assets belonging to the companies. After the indictment was unsealed on April 15, 2011, a date quickly dubbed Black Friday by the online poker community, PokerStars and Full Tilt stopped offering real money play to their United States customers.\nThree years after the start of the poker boom in 2003, the U.S. Congress passed UIGEA to extend existing gambling laws into cyberspace. The law made processing payments for illegal online gambling a crime; however, the defendant companies remained in the U.S. market in the belief that the law did not cover poker. A former payment processor for the companies turned state's evidence after initially being charged with violating UIGEA himself. On September 20, the civil suit was amended claiming individual fraud by Messrs. Howard Lederer, Chris Ferguson and Rafael Furst.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice seized the .com internet addresses of the three online gambling sites, replacing them with a takedown notice, but let Full Tilt and PokerStars use them again once they pledged to no longer serve the U.S. About 76 bank accounts in 14 countries were frozen, including an unknown amount of player funds. The prosecutors are seeking jail sentences for the 11 criminal defendants including site founders and executives, U.S. payment processors, and an executive of a small Utah bank, who prosecutors maintain were engaged in an elaborate criminal fraud scheme, using the bank in Utah to mis-code transactions with other banks to bypass UIGEA restrictions.\n\nAntigua and Barbuda officials considered action in the World Trade Organization. The companies ceased their U.S.-facing ad campaigns, resulting in cancellations of poker-themed television shows. In June, Full Tilt's eGambling license was suspended, which halted all of its remaining online play. The Alderney Gambling Control Commission on the British Channel Islands later revoked its license on September 29.\n\nOn July 31, 2012, US government dismissed \"with prejudice\" all civil complaints against all PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker companies after coming to a settlement with PokerStars which includes PokerStars purchasing Full Tilt. PokerStars and Full Tilt admitted no wrongdoing as part of the settlement, which ends all litigation between the government and the poker companies. The criminal indictments remain in place for the named individuals.\n\nIn 2003, ESPN expanded its coverage of the World Series of Poker. Between 2003 and 2006 the number of contestants in the $10,000 No Limit Texas hold'em Main Event grew from 839 to 8773. After the UIGEA was passed the World Series of Poker main event decreased in size, to 6358 players in 2007. In 2015 6420 players participated.\n\nOn October 13, 2006, the United States Congress passed Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, which makes it a federal offense, punishable by up to five years in prison, for a gambling business to \"knowingly accept\" payments \"in connection with the participation of another person in unlawful Internet gambling.\" However, according to syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum, the law did not define or alter the definition of unlawful gambling, which under Federal law only applies to sports betting via the Wire Act.\n\nNevertheless, Party Poker, at the time the largest provider for U.S. demand, decided to withdraw from servicing the United States poker market. The United States Department of Justice later indicted them for services provided prior to 2006 in violation of the Wire Act, a case they settled out of court in the hopes of being allowed to serve the U.S. market at a later date. Also in 2006, several other online poker service providers withdrew from the market, including Sportingbet's Paradise Poker, 888 Holdings' Pacific Poker, and the iPoker Network's CD Poker.\n\nSeveral other sites continued to facilitate the demand for online poker in the U.S., which had been growing about 20% per year.\n\nA 2006 law passed in Washington State that made it a felony to play online poker was upheld as constitutional by the Washington Supreme Court in September 2010. PokerStars immediately withdrew from Washington's market, and Full Tilt soon followed suit, but both sites continued to provide services to players in the other 49 U.S. states.\n\nThis case was preceded by a 2009 seizure of $34 million worth of winnings in transit U.S. poker players (q.v. Southern District of New York action against online poker players).\n\nSince Federal law says nothing specifically about online poker, or any gambling other than sports betting, Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, bases his case on a New York law that makes it a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in prison, to run a game of chance where bets are placed within the state. Although none of the sites are actually run out of New York (PokerStars is based on the Isle of Man, Full Tilt Poker is in Ireland and Absolute Poker is from Costa Rica), he was able to obtain a felony indictment for UIGEA violations. In addition to the 2006 UIGEA, the defendants were charged with violating the Illegal Gambling Business Act (18 USC 1955).\n\nAdditionally, in April 2010, the former head of Intabill, a defunct payment processor in Australia, Daniel Tzvetkoff, was arrested in Las Vegas by the FBI. He was charged with money laundering, bank fraud, and wire fraud. PokerStars and Full Tilt had previously claimed that Tzvetkoff cheated them out of at least 100 million dollars. However, he was quietly let go a few months later in August 2010. He reportedly turned state's evidence after being threatened with a 75-year prison sentence for alleged UIGEA violations.\n\nThe indictment also alleged that the executive officers of the sites had sought investment in SunFirst Bank in Utah, which they were using to obtain and pay out player funds by allegedly mis-coding transactions. Although no one was actually being defrauded \"per se\", and money from an otherwise legal operation can not be \"laundered\", these actions form the basis for the fraud and money laundering charges. This case marks only the second time that the Department of Justice has alleged violations of the 2006 UIGEA, (after the indictment of Daniel Tzvetkoff).\n\nA secret grand jury handed down a sealed indictment on March 10, 2011.\n\nOn April 15, the Department of Justice seized the .com internet addresses of the three online gambling sites, a total of five URLs: Pokerstars.com, Fulltiltpoker.com, Absolutepoker.com, Ultimatebet.com and UB.com.\n\nOn April 20, 2011, use of two of the domain names were returned to PokerStars and Full Tilt by the U.S. Attorney's office, \"to facilitate the withdrawal of U.S. players' funds held in account with the companies\"; in exchange the companies agreed to continue prohibiting United States residents from playing until the case was resolved. Ultimate control of the domains remains in the hands of US Attorney's office.\n\nBecause the charges against Absolute Poker and UltimateBet represent a much larger percentage of its revenues, their survival is in jeopardy. However, Cereus did eventually reach an agreement by which funds could be returned to United States players.\n\nOn July 31, 2012, US government dismissed \"with prejudice\" all civil complaints against all PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker companies after coming to a settlement with PokerStars which includes PokerStars purchasing Full Tilt. PokerStars and Full Tilt admitted no wrongdoing as part of the settlement, which ends all litigation between the government and the companies. The criminal indictments remain in place for the named individuals.\n\nAbout 76 bank accounts in 14 countries were then frozen, preventing players from accessing balances held by the companies, according to the FBI's New York office. That Full Tilt and Pokerstars accepted a total of $500 million in total player deposits is a conservative estimate.\n\nThe indictment named eleven individuals who were each charged with four crimes. The persons named in the indictment are:\n\nThe prosecutors are seeking jail sentences for the indicted executives and $3 billion from the poker companies. When the U.S. Department of Justice pursued Party Poker in 2006, it led to a $300 million plea agreement by PartyGaming co-founder Anurag Dikshit and a $105 million settlement with the company itself in 2009. In the criminal case, \"The maximum penalty for violation of the UIGEA and operating a gambling business is 5 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss for each charge, for conspiracy to commit wire fraud is 30 years in prison and a fine of $1 million or twice the gross gain or loss, and for money laundering conspiracy is 20 years in prison and a fine of $500,000 or twice the amount laundered.\"\n\nPreet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, expressed his view when the indictment was unsealed:\n\nAs charged, these defendants concocted an elaborate criminal fraud scheme, alternately tricking some U.S. banks and effectively bribing others to assure the continued flow of billions in illegal gambling profits. Moreover, as we allege, in their zeal to circumvent the gambling laws, the defendants also engaged in massive money laundering and bank fraud. Foreign firms that choose to operate in the United States are not free to flout the laws they don't like simply because they can't bear to be parted from their profits.\n\nFBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Janice K. Fedarcyk added: \n\nThese defendants, knowing full well that their business with U.S. customers and U.S. banks was illegal, tried to stack the deck. They lied to banks about the true nature of their business. Then, some of the defendants found banks willing to flout the law for a fee. The defendants bet the house that they could continue their scheme, and they lost.\n\nIn the amended complaint the government alleged that \"Full Tilt Poker did not maintain funds sufficient to repay all players, and in addition, the company used player funds to pay board members and other owners more than $440 million since April 2007.\"\nFurthermore, the amended complaint uses the term ponzi scheme prominently, including in its title.\n\nA lawyer for Ferguson has denied the allegations, suggesting that the issues may have been the result of mismanagement not malice. A lawyer for some of the defendants issued a press release stating that the phrase ponzi scheme was inaccurate, unfair and disingenuous and that its use was counterproductive.\n\nThe parties reached a settlement on July 31, 2012, ending all litigation between the government and the PokerStars/Full Tilt companies.\n\n\"Along with everyone else in the poker world, I'm shocked,\" said Brandon Adams, a poker professional who has appeared in televised tournaments on NBC and ESPN. \"The expectation was that there would be warning signs. These sites went from multibillion-dollar enterprises to on the ropes overnight.\" He added: \"Some players have literally millions of dollars in their online poker accounts.\"\n\nThe Poker Players Alliance called upon poker players affected by the shutdown to contact their Congressional representatives.\n\nPoker player and then-current U.S. Congressman Barney Frank, in an interview with \"The Hill\", lamented that the Justice Department is more focused on prosecuting online poker sites than those responsible for the mortgage crisis and financial meltdown.\n\nIn an editorial in the \"Washington Post\", poker player and former U.S. Senator Alfonse D'Amato, a long-time favorite of industry lobbyists, wrote: \"This is an attack on Internet poker and American poker players like me. Through these strong-arm tactics, prosecutors think they can ban Internet poker. Instead, they are making millions of Americans victims in an attempt to make online poker illegal without the support of legislators or the public.\" He called on President Barack Obama to rein in the prosecuting attorneys in the Southern District of New York.\n\nAntigua and Barbuda officials considered action in the World Trade Organization (WTO) saying that the United States violated global trade law by shutting down Internet gambling sites. Antigua and Barbuda have previously brought suit against the United States successfully with the WTO when it awarded monetary damages for violating international agreements on trade in services by prosecuting the operators of offshore internet gambling sites. Online poker is the second largest industry in Antigua's economy. Mark Mendel, the Caribbean government's legal adviser, told Reuters: \"I don't think there's another country in the world that puts people in jail for engaging in trade that's lawful under international law. It's as if Antigua would put Americans in jail for selling pineapples.\"\n\nOn June 29, the Alderney Gambling Control Commission (AGCC) suspended Full Tilt's license as a result of an investigation that arose after earlier federal indictments in New York, accusing company executives and associates of bank fraud, money laundering and other crimes. The license is suspended pending a July 26 hearing in London. Immediately following the suspension, the companies real money completely ceased operations. The actions by the AGCC mandated the cessation of the following:\n\nVarious sources report that this opened the way for Jack Binion to buy Full Tilt and ensure all Full Tilt Poker players get refunded in the process. On June 30, European investors agreed to provide capital to repay Full Tilt Players in exchange for a majority stake in the company. On July 26, the hearing revealed that Full Tilt owed () in overdue licensing fees to the AGCC, which Full Tilt paid within seven days as promised clearing the way for approval of a refinancing deal. The hearing was suspended until no later than September 15 as a result of the revelation. The delay until September 15 offers Full Tilt a chance to complete its negotiated settlement. On September 29, the AGCC stripped Full Tilt of its license. The AGCC's statement said that Full Tilt had misrepresented its financial situation, while Full Tilt said the action would jeopardize its ability to repay its customers.\n\nPrior to the indictments, the United States accounted for 25 to 40% the poker business for these companies. For PokerStars the International business share was 70 to 75% and for Full Tilt it was 50 to 60%, according to one source. Darren Rovell cites a source that says the three companies had a 95% market share in online poker in the United States. Following the shut down of play in the United States, traffic was down 24%, 49%, and 45% at PokerStars, Full Tilt and Absolute, respectively. Meanwhile, companies not affected by the indictment saw traffic spike.\n\nThe companies combined for an estimated US$200 million in advertising and marketing in the United States and their withdrawal from the U.S. market left network shows such as \"Poker After Dark\" and \"The Big Game\" without advertising sponsors. On cable television, ESPN's contract with PokerStars was for $22 million. ESPN withdrew its Pokerstars advertising. On Sunday April 17, ESPN2 cancelled its scheduled broadcast of 2011 North American Poker Tour presented by PokerStars.net. On Game Show Network, prepaid episodes of \"High Stakes Poker\" continued to air for several months after the event, but the show was in danger of not returning.\n\nThe companies accounted for a large proportion of World Series of Poker qualifiers via online satellites. Additionally, other players lost access to the funds they could use to play in the events. As a result, the 2011 World Series of Poker main event had the highest percentage of foreign players (and lowest percentage of American players) in history with 2,265 foreign players.\n\nWynn Resorts allied with PokerStars on March 25 to seek the legalization of Internet gambling in the U.S., but terminated the accord on April 15.\n\nU.S. citizens who play online poker for a living effectively lost their livelihoods due to the DOJ action. Pokernews pointed out a thread on the Two Plus Two forums where the PPA asked players to share their stories. Among the poker networks seen as potential destinations for U.S. Poker players looking for a new online home are Carbon Poker and DoylesRoom.\n\nAccording to Brandon Adams, live poker gambling at casinos might be a short-term beneficiary of the crackdown, but often online and live poker are not competitive but complementary, with players honing their skills in cheap, fast games online before gaining the nerve to play for higher stakes at a casino.\n\nAccording to \"Time\", the opposition to legalized domestic online gambling is depriving the United States economy from a huge potential source of tax revenues. One political action committee that received approximately $300,000 from PokerStars returned the money.\n\nOn April 26, PokerStars began processing cashouts. On May 4, Blanca Gaming of Antigua, the parent company to UB and Absolute Poker who had already laid off 95% of its employees, decided that it would have to pursue bankruptcy. On May 6, Pokerstars augmented their cashout policies to allow players to cashout frequent player points and pro-rata portions of partially earned VIP rewards bonuses.\n\nOn May 27, the Department of Justice unfroze an Irish account containing more than one-third of the more than $100 million that was owed to players. The account belonged to Full Tilt and its co-founder, Raymond Bitar. This was one of nine frozen Irish accounts. Full Tilt Poker had failed to uphold its promise to return U.S. Poker players by May 15, following the April 15 events. As a result, Full Tilt Pro Phil Ivey announced he would not be playing the 2011 World Series of Poker and suing Full Tilt. Ivey voluntarily withdrew the suit on June 30.\n\nJohn Campos and Chad Elie were arrested on Black Friday. Campos is part-owner and vice chairman of the board of directors for SunFirst Bank. On Monday, April 18, Campos, of St. George, Utah, appeared in a Utah court, but did not enter a plea. He was released on $25,000 bond, ordered to surrender his passport and to appear in a New York court for his next appearance. Chad Elie, of Las Vegas, made his first court appearance in Manhattan on Tuesday April 19. He was released on $250,000 bail.\n\nBradley Franzen made a court appearance in Manhattan on Monday April 18, entering a plea of 'not guilty' to the nine counts listed on his indictment, including bank fraud and money laundering charges. Franzen's bail was set at $200,000, for which his parents' house was used as collateral. Franzen pleaded guilty in a New York court on May 23, 2011. It is not known when he will be sentenced, however, it appears that Franzen struck a plea agreement with prosecutors, in which he agreed to cooperate in the probe, in return for which prosecutors would recommend leniency. Most of the other named defendants were out of the country. Ira Rubin, indicted on illegal gambling, fraud, and money laundering charges was arrested on Monday, April 25, 2011, in Guatemala. He made his initial court appearance in Miami on April 27, and was remanded in custody to his next appearance on April 29.\n\nRay Bitar surrendered to authorities on July 2, 2012.\n\nOn December 20, 2011, Absolute Poker co-founder Brent Buckley pleaded guilty to misleading banks. The plea deal calls for him to receive a sentence between a year and a year and a half in prison. Sentencing was set for April 19, 2012. Buckley was sentenced to 14 months.\n\nOn January 17, 2012, Ira Rubin entered a plea agreement in a Manhattan federal court in front of US Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein. Rubin agreed to plead guilty to three of the nine counts of conspiracy to commit bank fraud he faced and was expected to be sentenced to 18–24 months of prison. He received a three-year sentence, Judge Kaplan said, \"You are an unreformed con man and fraudster,\" and calling his actions a \"brazen\" defiance of US law. \"A significant sentence is necessary to protect the community.\"\n\nJohn Campos pleaded guilty in March 2012 to a single misdemeanor bank gambling charge. He was sentenced in June to three months in prison. During his plea, Campos said his processing of the gambling proceeds for PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker was not in return for a $10 million investment in the bank.\n\n"}

Reportedly, he was deformed and had a mouth that stretched from ear to ear.\n\nAmong the tales told of his prowess with sleight of hand is one in which, during an argument with a visiting juggler, he swallowed him whole, except for his shoes. He returned a time later, leading his opponent by the hand. Supposedly this occurred during the wedding of Wenceslaus and Sophia.\n\nAt a banquet, he caused a commotion outside, and when the guests went to look, he affixed deer antlers to their heads, which prevented them from drawing their heads back inside. While they struggled to remove them, he helped himself to sweets from their tables.\n\nIn another, he sold a butcher a dozen pigs, under the condition they not drink from running water. When they did so, the pigs changed into kernels of corn. He was angry at Žito and accosted him roughly, tearing one of his arms out by the roots. The argument soon attracted a crowd and Žito called out that the butcher was actually selling human flesh in his stall. The crowd rushed to look and found the proof. When the butcher was about to be torn apart, Žito called out for the crowd to look again. They found only animal meat.\n\nHe traveled in a cart drawn by poultry.\n\nAccording to \"\"; published in 1552 by Dubravius, he was at the end taken to Hell, in \"both body and soul\".\n\nP. T. Barnum considered the story of the butcher to be fictional, pointing out that it closely resembles a story about Doctor Faustus selling a horse.\n\nWhile many of his exploits can be seen as the product of skilled illusions such as Misdirection and Quick-change, in the past this was seen as the product of sorcery.\n\nAppeared in House of Secrets' short feature \"Realm of the Mystics\".\n\nAppeared on a postage stamp of the Czech Republic in 1997.\n\nIn Holub's poem \"Žito the Magician\", Žito can do many wondrous things, but he can't make a formula_1 greater than one.\n"}
