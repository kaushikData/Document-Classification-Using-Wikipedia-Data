(DSI) from Vancouver.\n\nIts first version, 1.0, was published by Mindscape in June 1991. The game was released for PC, Apple Macintosh, Atari ST, Amiga and Fujitsu FM Towns Marty. The Macintosh version has slightly improved graphics, but a smaller screen size.\n\nThe game features stylized boxers in polygon-based graphics, composed of triangles, some with names suggestive of non-fictional people. All opponent boxers have different fighting styles — some prefer to attack, some to counter-attack. Some (like Smokin' Joe Blow) have great punching power, some have amazing speed; The Champ has nearly perfect attributes. The game is regarded as one of earliest, and possibly first, examples of a 3D head-to-head fighting game. During the game, the player can choose which attributes to improve in his avatar: speed, power or stamina. While fighting, different tactics and strategies can be used, like all-out attacks, counter-attacks, dodging, etc. Sometimes fights end in a unanimous decision, even 15 round fights. Draws and disqualifications are also possibilities.\n\nA second version, 2.0, was published in February 1992. Version 2.0 was the \"Electronic Arts\" version which had different music, introductions, and pupils added to the boxers' eyes. The FM Towns Marty version was based on Version 2 but with higher quality sound.\n\n\"Computer Gaming World\" stated that the polygon graphics were strange-looking but very accurately modeled boxers' bodies and punches. The magazine concluded that \"\"4D Boxing\" is an excellent and thoroughly enjoyable game with an effective representation of boxing skills ... a welcome and often-played addition to any sports game library\". That year the magazine named it one of the year's best sports games.\n\nIn 1994, \"PC Gamer US\" named \"4D Boxing\" the 47th best computer game ever.\n"}

The screenplay by Arnold Schulman is based on the book of the 1975 stage production of the same name by James Kirkwood Jr. and Nicholas Dante. The songs were composed by Marvin Hamlisch and Edward Kleban.\n\nThe film was released theatrically on December 13, 1985 by Columbia Pictures. It received mixed to negative reviews from critics and was a box office bomb, grossing only $14 million from a $25 million budget.\n\nA group of dancers congregate on the stage of a Broadway theatre to audition for a new musical production directed by Zach (Michael Douglas). After the initial eliminations, sixteen hopefuls remain. Arriving late is former lead dancer Cassie (Alyson Reed) who once had a tempestuous romantic relationship with Zach but left him to take a job in Hollywood. Now she hasn't worked in over a year, and is desperate enough for work to even just be part of the chorus line. Whether he's willing to let professionalism overcome his personal feelings about their past remains to be seen.\n\nAs the film unfolds, the backstory of each of the dancers is revealed. Some are funny, some ironic, some heartbreaking. No matter what their background, however, they all have one thing in common: a passion for dance.\n\n\nThe songs \"And...\", \"Sing!\", and \"The Tap Combination\" from the stage version are eliminated in the film, as well as most of \"The Montage\" (\"Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love\")\n\nBefore the show had premiered, Hollywood producers expressed interest in a motion picture version of the musical. Universal Pictures acquired the rights for $5.5 million plus 20% of the distributor's gross rentals above $30 million with the stage musical's director Michael Bennett hired as producer and director. Bennett declined to participate when his proposal to present the film as an audition to cast the movie version of the stage play, instead of a literal translation of the play, was rejected. Many directors turned down the project, insisting that not only was \"A Chorus Line\" too beloved, but it would not translate well to the screen. When Attenborough accepted the project in 1984, there was some apprehension as to the treatment the British director would give the musical's quintessentially American story.\n\nUniversal sold the rights to PolyGram for $7.8 million in 1982 and in 1983 Embassy Pictures joined as co-producers.\n\nIn February 1984, according to Attenborough, the singer Madonna auditioned at the Royale Theatre on Broadway for a dance role in the movie using her birth name of Ciccone. He rejected her.\n\nThe decision to tamper with the score disappointed fans of the show. \"Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love,\" \"Sing!,\" and \"The Music and the Mirror\" were deleted (the first was touched on briefly) and new songs \"Surprise, Surprise\" and \"Let Me Dance For You\" were added. The show's breakout tune, \"What I Did for Love,\" was originally performed by Diana as a paean to dancers and their dedication to their craft, but in the film it becomes a wistful love song by Cassie about Zach as she leaves the stage.\n\nThe stage musical was one of the first productions to address the subject of gay actors within the theatre. The film version opted instead to make a more \"family friendly\" film by dealing less with the experiences of gay actors. \nThe dance numbers were choreographed by Jeffrey Hornaday.\n\nAudrey Landers could move well but was not a trained dancer as was the rest of the cast. Attenborough cast her in the film despite her lack of formal dance training. She is absent from some of the more difficult choreographed dance numbers.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. In his review in \"The New York Times\", Vincent Canby observed, \"Though it was generally agreed that \"Hair\" would not work as a film, Miloš Forman transformed it into one of the most original pieces of musical cinema of the last 20 years. Then they said that \"A Chorus Line\" couldn't be done—and this time they were right...Mr. Attenborough has elected to make a more or less straightforward film version that is fatally halfhearted.\"\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" stated, \"The result may not please purists who want a film record of what they saw on stage, but this is one of the most intelligent and compelling movie musicals in a long time—and the most grown up, since it isn't limited, as so many contemporary musicals are, to the celebration of the survival qualities of geriatric actresses.\"\n\n\"Variety\" said, \"\"Chorus\" often seems static and confined, rarely venturing beyond the immediate. Attenborough merely films the stage show as best he could. Nonetheless, the director and lenser Ronnie Taylor have done an excellent job working within the limitations, using every trick they could think of to keep the picture moving. More importantly, they have a fine cast, good music and a great, popular show to work with. So if all they did was get it on film, that's not so bad.\"\n\n\"Time Out London\" says, \"The grit and drive of the original have been dissipated into studiously unkempt glitz as empty as plasticised pop ... It's too corny and unbelievable for words.\"\n\nKelly Bishop, the original stage Sheila, noted, \"It was appalling when director Richard Attenborough went on a talk show and said 'this is a story about kids trying to break into show business.' I almost tossed my TV out the window; I mean what an idiot! It's about veteran dancers looking for one last job before it's too late for them to dance anymore. No wonder the film sucked!\"\n\nThe film was nominated for the following awards:\n\n\n\nNote: At the Golden Globes, \"A Chorus Line\" lost out in both categories to \"Prizzi's Honor\", while at the BAFTA Awards it lost out in both categories to \"Amadeus\".\n\n\"A Chorus Line\" was released to DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on April 15, 2003 as a Region 1 widescreen DVD, with a re-release in new packaging on January 14, 2014 and a Blu-ray release on the same date.\n\n"}

AIMIA's membership includes Australia's top digital power houses, digital content, services and applications companies, and major industry suppliers.\n\nAIMIA is best known for its annual awards that recognise the best digital work in Australia. Now approaching their 20th year, the AIMIA Awards are the longest running and most prestigious awards in Australia's digital industry. Winners for the 19th AIMIA Awards are listed here\n\nThe AIMIA Awards are the peak awards for the digital industry in Australia, and year after year continue to deliver a strong and innovative showcase of award winning digital creations.\n\nAIMIA was founded by Richard Heale the CEO of the Perth-based New Media company Interactive Logic and a group of other invited CEO's from companies in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.\n\nThe idea for AIMIA came from a conversation between Richard and Michael Gale who at the time was the CEO of the Authorware distributorship in Australia. Michael's commercial network afforded the opportunity to invite interested parties to an initial meeting in Sydney. Michael Gale also provided the initial funding and sponsorship for the organization. At this meeting Richard Heale brought a Perth lawyer, Martin Haas of Murie Edward, to draft an initial constitution and AIMIA was born.\n\nRichard Heale was the first AIMIA President, a position he held for the first two years of the organizations life. Paul Campbell of ICE Media in Brisbane was elected Treasurer and John Caitlin of Applied Learning in Sydney its Vice-President, other board members included Stephen Schwalger, Marius Coomans & Kevin Karp.\n\nAIMIA's initial primary focus was not on creating awards and their associated ceremonies but on creating federal government support for the fledgling New Media industry. AIMIA did organize awards and ceremonies the first taking place in Perth in 1992. However, at the time the AIMIA board realized that New Media had a significant role to play in Australia's mixed economy. New Media had both export potential and the opportunity to make certain aspects of the economy more efficient and effective.\n\nIn 1994 the AIMIA board gained funding from the Department of Industry and Technology to appoint the organizations first permanent national CEO and subsequently state based officers. Interviews were conducted in Sydney & Melbourne, by federal government and AIMIA officials, and from a strong list of candidates Stephen Schwalger was appointed.\n\nThe appointment of Stephen Schwalger (CEO 1994-1997), who had been a member of AIMIA's first national board, gave AIMIA the everyday horsepower it needed to develop appropriate foundations for the New Media industry in Australia.\n\nAfter considerable lobbying of the federal government by the AIMIA board & CEO, significant funds were allocated to AIMIA and the New Media industry as part of the 'Creative Nation' initiative from the Keating labour government. Creative Nation was launched in each Australian capital city in 1994 by the Hon Simon Crean and Richard Heale AIMIA's president.\n\nSignificant components of the Creative Nation initiative included:\n\nThe Multimedia Enterprise - A funding bank for the creation of CD titles (there was no internet at that time for content commercialization)\nAustralia on CD - Where Australian cultural institutions and New Media companies were encouraged to collaborate and bid for a pool of funds to create CD titles that reflected Australian history and culture.\n\nOver the next three (1994 - 1997) years AIMIA grew from a membership of 40 companies to over 800, set up State and federal structure for the association and negotiated state federal funding for industry development staff in 4 states, developed and managed a three-year export strategy in conjunction with Austrade which resulted in Australian companies entering markets in UK, USA, Europe, Canada, Japan, Korea and Taiwan.

{"id": "3741454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3741454", "title": "Ballet Mécanique", "text": "Ballet Mécanique\n\nBallet Mécanique (1923–24) is a Dadaist post-Cubist art film conceived, written, and co-directed by the artist Fernand Léger in collaboration with the filmmaker Dudley Murphy (with cinematographic input from Man Ray). It has a musical score by the American composer George Antheil. However, the film premiered in a silent version on 24 September 1924 at the Internationale Ausstellung neuer Theatertechnik (International Exposition for New Theater Technique) in Vienna presented by Frederick Kiesler. It is considered one of the masterpieces of early experimental filmmaking.\n\nIn her book \"Dudley Murphy: Hollywood Wild Card\", film historian Susan Delson argues that Murphy was the film's driving force but that Léger was more successful at promoting the film as his own creation. However, after fighting at the front in World War I and spending the year of 1917 in a hospital after being gassed there, Fernand Léger exclusively made the dazzling effects of mechanical technology the subject of his art, and it is clear that he conceived of the film himself.\n\nLéger's experiences in World War I had a significant effect on all of his work. Mobilized in August 1914 for service in the French army, he spent two years at the front in Argonne. He produced many sketches of artillery pieces, airplanes, and fellow soldiers while in the trenches, and painted \"Soldier with a Pipe\" (1916) while on furlough. In September 1916 he almost died after a mustard gas attack by the German troops at Verdun. During a period of convalescence in Villepinte he painted \"The Card Players\" (1917), a canvas whose robot-like, monstrous figures reflect the ambivalence of his experience of war. As he explained:... I was stunned by the sight of the breech of a 75 millimeter in the sunlight. It was the magic of light on the white metal. That's all it took for me to forget the abstract art of 1912–1913. The crudeness, variety, humor, and downright perfection of certain men around me, their precise sense of utilitarian reality and its application in the midst of the life-and-death drama we were in ... made me want to paint in slang with all its color and mobility. \"The Card Players\" marked the beginning of his \"mechanical period\" of which \"Ballet Mécanique\" is a part, an artistic technique that combined the dynamic abstraction of constructivism with the absurd and unruly qualities of Dada. We see this trend in the film from beginning to end.\n\nHowever, a photo of a Dada sculpture with the name \"Ballet Mécanique\" had been previously featured in 391, a periodical created and edited by the Dadaist Francis Picabia that first appeared in January 1917, and continued to be published until 1924. But it is not known if Fernand Léger was aware of it or not.\n\nIn its original release, the film's French title was \"Charlot présente le ballet mécanique\" (as seen on the original print), referring to Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp character as he was known in France. The image of a Cubist-style paper puppet of Charlot, by Leger, appears several times in the film. It is only the first of many visual puns in the film—a seeming display of the film's sheer visual modernity, as intended by its creators from the get-go.\n\nGeorge Antheil's \"Ballet Mécanique\" (1924) was originally conceived as an accompaniment for the film and was scheduled to be premiered at the Internationale Ausstellung neuer Theatertechnik. However before completion, director and composer agreed to go their different ways. The musical work runs close to 30 minutes, while the film is about 19 minutes long.\n\nAntheil's music for \"Ballet Mécanique\" became a concert piece, premiered by Antheil himself in Paris in 1926. Antheil assiduously promoted the work, and even engineered his supposed \"disappearance\" while on a visit to Africa so as to get media attention for a preview concert. The official Paris première in June 1926 was sponsored by an American patroness who at the end of the concert was tossed in a blanket by three baronesses and a duke. The work enraged some of the concert-goers, whose objections were drowned out by the cacophonous music, while others vocally supported the work. After the concert, there were some fights in the street. Antheil tried to replicate this scandal at Carnegie Hall by hiring provocateurs, but they were largely ignored.\n\nAlthough the film was intended to use Antheil's score as a soundtrack, the two parts were not brought together until the 1990s. In 2000, Paul Lehrman produced a married print of the film. This version of the film was included in the DVD collection \"Unseen Cinema: Early American Avant Garde Film 1894–1941\" released in October 2005.\n\nAs a composition, \"Ballet Mécanique\" is Antheil's best known and most enduring work. It remains famous for its radical repetitive style and instrumentation, as well as its storied history. Antheil himself was not a Dadaist, though he had many friends and supporters in that community.\n\nIn concert performance, the \"Ballet Mécanique\" is not a show of human dancers but of mechanical instruments. Among these, player pianos, airplane propellers, and electric bells stand prominently onstage, moving as machines do, and providing the visual side of the ballet. As the bizarre instrumentation may suggest, this was no ordinary piece of music. It was loud and percussive – a medley of noises, much as the Italian Futurists envisioned new music of the 20th century.\n\nIn 1927, Antheil arranged the first part of the Ballet for Welte-Mignon. This piano-roll was performed on 16 July 1927 at the \"Deutsche Kammermusik Baden-Baden 1927\". Unfortunately, these piano rolls are now thought to be lost.\n\nThe original orchestration called for 16 player pianos (or pianolas) in four parts, 2 regular pianos, 3 xylophones, at least 7 electric bells, 3 propellers, siren, 4 bass drums, and 1 tam-tam. As it turned out, there was no way to keep so many pianolas synchronized, so early performances combined the four parts into a single set of pianola rolls and augmented the two human-played pianos with 6 or more additional instruments.\n\nIn 1953, Antheil wrote a shortened (and much tamer) version for four pianos, four xylophones, two electric bells, two propellers, timpani, glockenspiel, and other percussion. The original orchestration was first realized in 1992 by Maurice Peress.\n\nIn 1999, the University of Massachusetts Lowell Percussion Ensemble presented the first performance of the original score (without the film) using 16 player pianos and live players. The player pianos were Yamaha Disklaviers, controlled via MIDI using the Macintosh software program Opcode StudioVision.\n\nIn 1986, the film was premiered with a new score by Michael Nyman.\n\nThe score and film were successfully combined in 2000 by Paul Lehrman, who used an edited version of the original orchestration in which he used player pianos recorded after the Lowell performance, with the rest of the instruments played electronically. This version is available in the DVD set \"Unseen Cinema: Early American Avant Garde Film 1894–1941\" released in October 2005 and also in the DVD set \"Bad Boy Made Good\", which also contains Lehrman's documentary film about Antheil and the Ballet mécanique, which was released in April 2006. The featured film print is the original version, premiered in Vienna on 24 September 1924 by Frederick Kiesler.\n\nIn November 2002, a version of the score for live ensemble (which required further editing, since live players couldn't play it as fast as electronic instruments) was premiered in Columbus, Ohio by an ensemble from the Peabody Conservatory of Music, conducted by Julian Pellicano. The performance, with the newly-realized soundtrack and the 1952 version of Ballet mécanique, was repeated at the Friedberg Concert Hall at Peabody Conservatory on February 17, 2003. The work was then performed in Montreal at the Montréal/Nouvelles Musiques festival, conducted by Walter Boudreau. This version was then performed a dozen times in Europe by the London Sinfonietta in 2004 and 2005.\n\nIn 2005, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC commissioned Lehrman and the League of Electronic Musical Urban Robots (LEMUR), Eric Singer, director, to create a computer-driven robotic ensemble to play the Ballet mécanique. This installation was at the Gallery from 12 March to 7 May 2006. It was installed in December 2007 at the Wolfsonian Museum in Miami Beach, FL, and again at 3-Legged Dog in New York City, where it was used to accompany a play about Antheil and Hedy Lamarr, and their invention of spread-spectrum technology, called \"Frequency Hopping.\" During the run of the play, the Léger/Murphy film was shown, with the robotic orchestra performing the score, at two special \"after-concerts.\"\n\nThe Ballet is hard to surmise from just looking at the score—one must hear it to get a real sense of its chaos. It moves frighteningly quickly, up to 32nd notes at tempo (quarter = 152). It sounds like an onslaught of confusing chords, punctuated by random rings, wails, or pauses. The meter rarely stays the same for more than three measures, distracting from the larger form of the music and instead highlighting the driving rhythms. However, the piece is definitely structured in a sonata rondo.\n\nThe sonata rondo form follows an [AB] [A'C] [A'’B'’] [Coda] pattern, where A is a first theme, B is a second theme, and C is a middle section loosely related to A and B:\n\nA – Theme 1 starts at the beginning of the piece. It is easily identified by the oscillating melody in the xylophones. It moves through rhythmic and intervallic variations until a bridge into the next theme (measure 38 in the original scoring).\n\nB – Theme 2 (m77) features the pianolas, supported by drums. The melody is mostly built from parallel series of consonant chords, sometimes sounding pentatonic but often making no tonal sense at all. Antheil uses pianolas for things that would be difficult for human players (a 7-note chord at m142, for example).\n\nA' – Xylophones return in triple meter to recall Theme 1 (m187). This is not strictly a repeat of Theme 1 but another variation and development upon it. This section descends into increasing chaos (starting m283) which signals a transition into part C (m328).\n\nC – The xylophones and pianolas play a new tune. They stay in better rhythmic agreement here and give a more ordered feel to this section. The xylophones eventually cut out to make way for a serene pianola passage.\n\nA'’B'’ – The xylophones return (m403) with the theme from the beginning. There are differences from the original AB part, including new bitonal passage (m530) and miniature round (m622) between xylophones and pianolas. The pentatonic melody, hinted in part B, returns (m649) and gets developed in the context of the round.\n\nCoda – A startling change occurs when all instruments cut out except for a lone bell (m1134). This signals the beginning of a very long and thinly textured coda. It alternates between irregular measures of complete silence and pianola with percussion. The measures of silence get longer until the listener begins to wonder whether the piece is already over. Finally, there is a crescendo of pianola, a flurry of percussion and a bang to mark the real ending. The score indicates the last measure of the piece to be ended with the pianos and drums only, but modern performances have the xylophones joining back in and doubling the melody of the pianolas to create a more firm, solid, and recognizable ending.\n\nThe mechanical pianos keep the tempo strictly at (quarter = 152). All longer rests in the pianola part are notated in 8th rests, as if to suggest the exactness of the instrument. At this rate, the 1920s pianola played 8.5 feet per minute of paper rolls over three rolls. This logistical nightmare has been described by some scholars as being an error, and that Antheil's suggested tempo was actually half that (quarter = 76), but in fact Antheil's 1953 \"Ballet Mécanique\" score indicates a tempo of 144–160.\n\nThe airplane propellers were actually large electric fans, into which musicians would insert object such as wooden poles or leather straps to create sound, since the fans don't make much noise. In the Paris performances, beginning in June 1926, the fans were pointed up at the ceiling. However, at the Carnegie Hall premiere on 10 April 1927, the fans were positioned to blow into the audience, upsetting the patrons.\n\nNevertheless, with respect to the original synchronized film, and despite the quality of last sound performance and its consistent reliability with Antheil's original plans for its concert (made by Lehrman himself and endorsed by the Schirmer publisher for the DVD \"Unseen Cinema: Early American Avant Garde Film 1894–1941\", 2005), its timing with the film it is still in full debate today.\n\nNew points of view offers Ortiz Morales, in his thesis \" El ballet mécanique y el Synchro-ciné \", already in 2008. He refutes all the points of view that have given origin to the realization of Lehrman and proposes other alternatives within what he calls \"the state of confusion\" around the film. Among others, the score of 30 minutes and 16 synchronized pianolas so laboriously obtained is not really the original musical idea for the film, but a subsequent \"expansion\" of the original idea, which was carried out by Antheil as a \" spectacular \" and independent concert, once proved that it could not synchronize its music together with the images of Léger. The true film score must have been much simpler and more precise, and possibly the one that would end up orchestrating in 1953. It argues, therefore, that the problem of \"original synchronization\" was never in the 16 synchronized pianolas of the giant score, but the problem with the simple version (for the film) must have been in the device that had to synchronize it \"mechanically\" : the Synchro-Ciné of the inventor Charles Delacommune, possibly the first audio-visual mixing table of the story and with which it is known that they were desperately trying for a while (there is documented) the material for that film, signed by Léger and Delacommune). According to technical studies on documentation (the apparatus as such was lost in II World War ) , it seems that the synchro-ciné was a \" synchronizer \" capable of good audio-video simultaneities in standard measures, but the fleeting and devilish rhythm of the work far exceeded its possibilities: especially the amalgamated ones, of 7 and 5, very used in the work and impossible to obtain with a such precarious device. With a more restrained and square music, they could have been tuned and synchronized mechanically, which was what Léger promised to the press after talking to Delacommune (but before having tried it in practice with the music of Antheil).\n\nThis thesis, and the implications that it originates, has been greatly reinforced in 2016 with the publication of the original reconstruction of kinematic synchronism according to it in the so-called \"Canonical version\". This version, made with the collaboration of the Ensemble Modern, and from the few truly reliable and objective data that have reached today, searches through algorithms computer the exact copy of the film and the correct Antheil score, which they both joined together in 1935 (the only time they know that proper 'timing' occurred, according to themselves). Since the various copies that have come to us from the Ballet Mecanique are different from each other (some a lot), because it seems that Léger was, little by little replacing the original images of Man Ray and Dudley Murphy until almost the end of his lifetime. Thus, in each period, a slightly different copy of the Ballet has circulated: no two are alike. That is to say, that the film was going from dadaist to cubist, gradually, which explains, in part, doubts about its ascription to a certain aesthetic.\n\n\n\n"}

It also manages the library in Villa La Grange.\n\nIt focuses on the humanities and the social sciences with special emphasis on the Reformation, the Enlightenment and \"Genevensia\" (i.e. anything published in Geneva or whose author or subject is connected to Geneva).\n\nGeneva has one of the oldest legal deposit systems in the world, dating from 1539, with all Genevan publications originally being deposited with a \"Chambre des comptes\". John Calvin created the library twenty years later to serve the Académie in what is now Collège Calvin. The earliest mention of the library goes back to 1562. \n\nIn 1720, the Genevan theologian Ami Lullin acquired the Petau collection of illuminated manuscripts and left it to the library in 1756. \n\nIn 1872, the library moved to its current building in Parc des Bastions alongside Uni Bastions. \n\nThe Institut et Musée Voltaire was founded in 1954, Geneva's music library, now called La Musicale, in 1962, and the Centre d'iconographie in 1993.\n\nIn 1999, the library was added to the Swiss Inventory of Cultural Property of National and Regional Significance. In 2011, its Jean-Jacques Rousseau collections were included, jointly with those of the , in the Unesco Memory of the World Register.\n\nIn 2014, there were more that two million print volumes in the library's collections. Since the 20th century, the library has focused on the humanities and social sciences. Many of its incunable and other early modern books are available on e-rara.ch.\n\nAs well as 1,500 papyri and 380 medieval manuscripts, the Bibliothèque de Genève holds the papers of such Geneva personalities as John Calvin, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Horace-Bénédict de Saussure, Édouard Naville, Emile Jaques-Dalcroze and Nicolas Bouvier. Some of these manuscripts are available on e-codices.ch.\n\n\nThe map collection was begun in 1893, when the Genevan cartographer , who drew most of the maps for Élisée Reclus's \"Nouvelle Géographie universelle\", gave approximately 7,000 items to the library. It now has about 45,000 maps, dating from the 16th to the mid-20th century.\n\nMaps of the city and canton of Geneva are kept at the Centre d'iconographie. The evolution of Geneva over the centuries can be seen on the GE200.ch website using some of these maps.\n\nThe library began collecting posters in 1851 and now has about 130,000. The collection documents life in Geneva, focusing on advertising, culture, social life, tourism and politics, including the struggles of the 1930s and protests from the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe Musée Voltaire, previously known as the \"Institut et Musée Voltaire\", is both a museum and a library devoted to Voltaire and the 18th century. It is located on Geneva's right bank, in the Délices area. The museum has works by Jean Huber, Jean-Antoine Houdon, Hans Erni and others. The library has a significant number of manuscripts and 22,000 volumes, to be read in the reading room (not for loan).\n\nLa Musicale, previously known as the \"Bibliothèque musicale de la ville de Genève\", is Geneva's specialist music library, open to all. It is located near the Conservatoire, the Victoria Hall and the Grand Théâtre, on the first floor of the Maison des arts du Grütli. It has about 50,000 music scores (classical, jazz, rock, world music...), as well as relevant books and journals, and posters and concert programmes going back to the 19th century.\n\nThe Centre d'iconographie, previously known as the \"Centre d'iconographie de la ville de Genève\" or CIG, is an archive of about 4 million images, primarily of the city and canton of Geneva and the surrounding area, though not exclusively. It includes, for example, photos by the Genevan photographer Frédéric Boissonnas of the Balkans, Greece and North Africa. It is located near the Boulevard du Pont-d'Arve. Its collections are included in the Swiss Inventory of Cultural Property of National and Regional Significance.\n\nThe private library of Guillaume Favre (1770-1851) contains about 5,600 works, in over 12,000 volumes, on history, literature and ancient languages, still in their original setting in Parc La Grange.

{"id": "7278058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7278058", "title": "Blue Blouse", "text": "Blue Blouse\n\nThe Blue Blouse () was an influential agitprop theatre collective in the early Soviet Union. Boris Yuzhanin created the first Blue Blouse troupe under the auspices of the Moscow Institute of Journalism in 1923. Their example encouraged similar workers' theatre companies across the country and worldwide; by 1927 there were more than 5,000 Blue Blouse troupes in the Soviet Union with more than 100,000 members. In the autumn of that year, the original troupe began a tour in Erwin Piscator's theatre in Berlin that provoked a rapid growth of agitprop troupes across Weimar Germany.\n\nThe blue workers' uniforms, in which the actors performed, gave the troupe its name, under which they also published a magazine, which contained scripts and detailed descriptions of staging, costumes, and the troupe's other theatrical techniques, along with news reports and current affairs. Its variety style made many demands on its performers, requiring \"a young deft man trained in physical culture, trained in the striking word, in the cheerful, bold and hard-hitting song and couplet, in the contemporary rhythm of the grotesque and simplistic,\" its magazine explained.\n\nThe rehearsal process was extremely rigorous, requiring actors to stay physically and mentally alert through a strict exercise program and by keeping up with the political topics of the day. The year 1927 marked the end of the Blue Blouse organisation, when it was forced to merge with the more orthodox Workers' Youth Theatre (TRAM).\n\nBlue Blouse theatre combined many stylistic elements and art forms and imbued them with socio-political meaning with the intent of reaching the Soviet people. In the early years of the Soviet Union, multiple small form amateur theatre groups arose. Blue Blouse became one of the most popular because of its dynamic performances that were able to use entertainment and comedy to connect with the people on a personal level about daily life and news. Each performance, though enjoyable, had a political message, which expressed the opinions of the Soviet regime to the common people, targeting the working class.\n\nBlue Blouse theatre had specific requirements when it came to basic features of performance, such as outfits, props, and setting. They even published a manifesto with details on the specific characteristics of what to wear, how to act, and what music to use. The most basic component of their outfit, and where they got their name, was the blue workers shirt as well as black trousers or a skirt. The actors used workers garments to help connect to the populace. Other clothing also made it easy to switch characters. The clothing was often embellished with props to distinguish the role of the performer, a capitalist often being defined by a top hat or a bureaucrat by a red pencil. The only time the actors did not wear workers clothing was during acrobatic or gymnastic performances. The performances were meant to be practical and accessible as well as enjoyable.\n\nThe performances took place in clubs, cafeterias, factory floors, and outside. Tables and stools were sometimes used as props if they served a purpose but were otherwise thought to \"slow down the tempo of movement and obstruct access to the stage.\" The Blue Blouse collective wrote a document where they state that they \"are against bright beauty and realistic sets and decoration.\" Blue Blouse was very particular about all aspects of performance having a specific purpose to convey a specific message.\n\nBlue Blouse theatre incorporated a myriad of different artistic mediums of performance as well as talents such as dancing and singing to create dynamic performances with identifiable acts. Blue Blouse continued with the tradition of living newspaper, which involved presenting the important news stories of the day to the people. This originally stemmed from high illiteracy rates, so somebody would read the newspaper out loud. This practice evolved to the paper being acted out with visual assistance, providing an effective way to get news across and speak to the workers. Blue Blouse used the living newspaper technique through \"satirical songs, lively posters, dances, and pantomime.\"\n\nThe performances were made to be interesting for the audience and used a variety of techniques. One technique was dramatic form, which included monologue, dialogue, and singing. Other forms were those derived from dance and gymnastics, such as acrobatics. Blue Blouse made use of posters, as well as musical numbers, and even some film. There was an incredible amount of variety. Due to all the different techniques used the actors needed to be versatile and have the ability to sing, be athletic, and \"transform,\" meaning to be able to easily adjust from act to act. Actors were also not supposed to show any emotion. The performance would begin with a parade of headliners and continue with 8-10 vignettes on topics ranging from international affairs to local ones. The performance would end with a parade as well as a recap of the performance, with special attention on the political message.\n\nThough the performances were meant to be fun, they were also meant to help the Soviet regime. Blue Blouse drew on folk theatre as well as urban culture to help appeal to the populace. The people were familiar with folk theatre so aspects were intertwined with Blue Blouse, such as a \"rupor\" whose role was to present the scene and tie skits together. As urban culture grew it was also incorporated, Blue Blouse theatre trying to stay in touch with their audience. As for the actual dialogue of Blue Blouse performances, it was supposed to be taken from the Blue Blouse newspaper that was published and tied in with local themes, using materials from papers and magazines. Information was to be kept relevant to the lives of those watching the performances.\n\nThe history behind Blue Blouse serves as an explanation for how the theatre group emerged as a means of political propaganda in the Soviet Union. Shortly after the beginning of the Soviet Union, the government put the New Economic Policy into action, which helped stabilize the country economically. Funds were still tight but the Soviet regime saw the benefit of beginning a cultural campaign to turn the populace to the communist way of life. Theatre revival had already begun after the revolution and so the Soviets wanted to use this as a means to reach the people, and one that proved to be effective. Blue Blouse in particular became very popular along with other small forms because of their lack of funds and resources and their intimacy with the audience. The Soviet regime saw that they could use theatre as a means of speaking to and manipulating the population.\n\nThough Blue Blouse was very entertaining, it had political content and a specific agenda to get across. By the summer of 1924 all living newspapers gained backing as a \"method of agitation and propaganda serving the political, productive, and domestic tasks of the proletariat.\" Those who were enemies of the Soviets were satirized, and those who were heroes were put on a pedestal. Blue Blouse was used to \"impart lessons on how Soviet citizens should live, what books they should read, what their hygienic habits should be, and how they should relate to the Soviet regime.\" Whatever topics were relevant to the politics of the time were incorporated into Blue Blouse theatre.\n\nCommon characters that emerged in Blue Blouse for political commentary were capitalist, banker, premier, NEPman, Kulak, Menshevik, Social Revolutionary, General, Lady, Female Worker, Female Komsomol, Red Army Man, the Peasant, and the Worker. All of these characters were extremely pertinent at the time and carried strong political messages. In a time of industrialization the worker was a very relevant character and one that was targeted in the performances. The Russian Revolution had happened recently in 1917 and was still fresh in everyone’s minds. The NEP was currently underway as Blue Blouse prospered, making it a very pertinent topic, especially since it involved restricted capitalism and the revolution was against this. Blue Blouse frequently used these characters, and always to the advantage and opinions of the regime. Asides from characters, Blue Blouse included important political topics such as industrialization. There was one skit done called \"Industrialization\" which involved the actors wearing symbols which made clear they were supposed to be factories and other items relevant to industrialization. They ended by standing on each other’s backs to represent the finished system. It was very abstract and humorous yet imbued with meaning.\n\nBlue Blouse was an important theatre movement and political tool in the Soviet Union. Critics of Blue Blouse thought it was theatre for the workers but not by the workers or wasn’t educational because it was so entertaining. Overall though, it was influential and received a positive response, becoming extremely popular, very fast, due to its relevancy and ability to be entertaining. Due to Blue Blouse serving as political propaganda for the Soviet Union, it serves as a way of looking at the Soviet agenda and influence through theatre.\n\n\n\n"}

It was one of five Federal Project Number One projects sponsored by the Works Progress Administration. It was created not as a cultural activity but as a relief measure to employ artists, writers, directors and theater workers. It was shaped by national director Hallie Flanagan into a federation of regional theatres that created relevant art, encouraged experimentation in new forms and techniques, and made it possible for millions of Americans to see live theatre for the first time. The Federal Theatre Project ended when its funding was canceled after strong Congressional objections to the left-wing political tone of a small percentage of its productions.\n\nPart of the Works Progress Administration, the Federal Theatre Project was a New Deal program established August 27, 1935, funded under the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935. Of the $4.88 billion allocated to the WPA, $27 million was approved for the employment of artists, musicians, writers and actors under the WPA's Federal Project Number One.\n\nGovernment relief efforts through the Federal Emergency Relief Administration and Civil Works Administration in the two preceding years were amateur experiments regarded as charity, not a theatre program. The Federal Theatre Project was a new approach to unemployment in the theatre profession. Only those certified as employable could be offered work, and that work was to be within the individual's defined skills and trades.\n\n\"For the first time in the relief experiments of this country the preservation of the skill of the worker, and hence the preservation of his self-respect, became important,\" wrote Hallie Flanagan, director of the Federal Theatre Project. A theater professor at Vassar College who had studied the operation of government-sponsored theatre abroad for the Guggenheim Foundation, Flanagan was chosen to head the Federal Theatre Project by WPA head Harry Hopkins, a former classmate at Grinnell College. Roosevelt and Hopkins selected her despite considerable pressure to choose someone from the commercial theatre; they believed the project should be led by someone with academic credentials and a national perspective.\n\nFlanagan was given the daunting task of building a nationwide theater program to employ thousands of unemployed artists in as little time as possible. The problems of the theatre preceded the financial collapse of 1929. By that time it was already threatened with extinction due to the growing popularity of films and radio, but the commercial theatre was reluctant to adapt its practices. Many actors, technicians and stagehands had suffered since 1914, when movies began to replace stock, vaudeville and other live stage performances nationwide. Sound motion pictures displaced 30,000 musicians. In the Great Depression, people who had no money for entertainment found an entire evening of entertainment at the movies for 25 cents, while commercial theatre charged $1.10 to $2.20 admission to cover the cost of theater rental, advertising and fees to performers and union technicians. Unemployed directors, actors, designers, musicians and stagecrew took any kind of work they were able to find, whatever it paid, and charity was often their only recourse.\n\n\"This is a tough job we're asking you to do,\" Hopkins told Flanagan at their first meeting in May 1935. \"I don't know why I still hang on to the idea that unemployed actors get just as hungry as anybody else.\"\n\nHopkins promised \"a free, adult, uncensored theatre\" — something Flanagan spent the next four years trying to build. She emphasized the development of local and regional theatre, \"to lay the foundation for the development of a truly creative theatre in the United States with outstanding producing centers in each of those regions which have common interests as a result of geography, language origins, history, tradition, custom, occupations of the people.\"\n\nOn October 24, 1935, Flanagan prefaced her instructions on the Federal Theatre's operation with a statement of purpose:\n\nThe primary aim of the Federal Theatre Project is the reemployment of theatre workers now on public relief rolls: actors, directors, playwrights, designers, vaudeville artists, stage technicians, and other workers in the theatre field. The far reaching purpose is the establishment of theatres so vital to community life that they will continue to function after the program of this Federal Project is completed.\n\nWithin a year the Federal Theatre Project employed 15,000 men and women, paying them $23.86 a week. During its nearly four years of existence it played to 30 million people in more than 200 theaters nationwide — renting many that had been shuttered — as well as parks, schools, churches, clubs, factories, hospitals and closed-off streets. Its productions totalled approximately 1,200, not including its radio programs. Because the Federal Theatre was created to employ and train people, not to generate revenue, no provision was made for the receipt of money when the project began. At its conclusion, 65 percent of its productions were still presented free of charge. The total cost of the Federal Theatre Project was $46 million.\n\n\"In any consideration of the cost of the Federal Theatre,\" Flanagan wrote, \"it should be borne in mind that the funds were allotted, according to the terms of the Relief Act of 1935, to pay wages to unemployed people. Therefore, when Federal Theatre was criticized for spending money, it was criticized for doing what it was set up to do.\"\n\nThe Federal Theatre Project established five regional centers in New York, New York, Boston (Northeast), Chicago (Midwest), Los Angeles (West), and New Orleans (South). The FTP did not operate in every state, since many lacked a sufficient number of unemployed people in the theatre profession. The project in Alabama was closed in January 1937 when its personnel were transferred to a new unit in Georgia. Only one event was presented in Arkansas. Units created in Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin were closed in 1936; projects in Indiana, Nebraska, Rhode Island and Texas were discontinued in 1937; and the Iowa project was closed in 1938.\n\nMany of the notable artists of the time participated in the Federal Theatre Project, including Susan Glaspell who served as Midwest bureau director. The legacy of the Federal Theatre Project can also be found in beginning the careers of a new generation of theater artists. Arthur Miller, Orson Welles, John Houseman, Martin Ritt, Elia Kazan, Joseph Losey, Marc Blitzstein and Abe Feder are among those who became established, in part, through their work in the Federal Theatre. Blitzstein, Houseman, Welles and Feder collaborated on the controversial production, \"The Cradle Will Rock\".\n\nThe Federal Theatre Project was the most costly of the Federal One projects, consuming 29.1 percent of Federal One's budget, which was itself less than three-fourths of one percent of the total WPA budget.\n\nOn June 30, 1939, the Federal Theatre Project ended when its funding was canceled, largely due to strong Congressional objections to the overtly left-wing political tones of less than 10 percent of the Federal Theatre Project productions.\n\nLiving Newspapers were plays written by teams of researchers-turned-playwrights. These men and women clipped articles from newspapers about current events, often hot button issues like farm policy, syphilis testing, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and housing inequity. These newspaper clippings were adapted into plays intended to inform audiences, often with progressive or left-wing themes. \"Triple-A Plowed Under\", for instance, attacked the U.S. Supreme Court for killing an aid agency for farmers. These politically themed plays quickly drew criticism from members of Congress.\n\nAlthough the undisguised political invective in the Living Newspapers sparked controversy, they also proved popular with audiences. As an art form, the Living Newspaper is perhaps the Federal Theatre's most well-known work.\n\nProblems with the Federal Theatre Project and Congress intensified when the State Department objected to the first Living Newspaper, \"Ethiopia\", about Haile Selassie and his nation's struggles against Benito Mussolini's invading Italian forces. The U.S. government soon mandated that the Federal Theatre Project, a government agency, could not depict foreign heads of state on the stage for fear of diplomatic backlash. Playwright and director Elmer Rice, head of the New York office of the FTP, resigned in protest and was succeeded by his assistant, Philip W. Barber.\n\nNumbers following the city of origin indicate the number of additional cities where the play was presented.\n\nThe Negro Theatre Unit was part of the Federal Theatre Project and had units that were set up in cities throughout the United States. The units were located in four different geographical regions of the country. In the West, units were located in Seattle, Washington, and Los Angeles, California. In the East, units were located in New York City, New York, Boston, Massachusetts, Hartford, Connecticut, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Newark, New Jersey. In the South, there were units in Raleigh, North Carolina, Durham, North Carolina, and Birmingham, Alabama. In the Midwest, units were located in Chicago, Illinois, Peoria, Illinois, and Cleveland, Ohio. The project provided employment and apprenticeships to black playwrights, directors, actors, and technicians. The project offered a much needed source of assistance for African-American theatre from 1935 to 1939. The project's inspiring purposes further influenced the founding within a year of the American Negro Theater, 1940 – 1949.\n\nThe Negro Theatre Unit of New York City was the best known. It was headquartered at the Lafayette Theatre in Harlem, where some 30 plays were presented. The first was Frank H. Wilson's folk drama, \"Walk Together Chillun\" (1936), about the deportation of 100 African-Americans from the South to the North to work for low wages. The second was \"Conjur' Man Dies\" (1936), a comedy-mystery adapted by Arna Bontemps and Countee Cullen from Rudolph Fisher's novel. The most popular production was the third, which came to be called the \"Voodoo Macbeth\" (1936), director Orson Welles's adaptation of Shakespeare's play set on a mythical island suggesting the Haitian court of King Henri Christophe.\n\nNumbers following the city of origin indicate the number of additional cities where the play was presented.\nNumbers following the city of origin indicate the number of additional cities where the play was presented.\n\nNumbers following the city of origin indicate the number of additional cities where the play was presented.\nThese plays were given their first professional production in the United States by the Federal Theatre Project. Titles are shown as they appeared on event programs. Numbers following the city of origin indicate the number of additional cities where the play was presented.\n\nThe Federal Theatre of the Air began weekly broadcasts March 15, 1936. For three years the radio division of the Federal Theatre Project presented an average of 3,000 programs annually on commercial stations and the NBC, Mutual and CBS networks. The major programs originated in New York; radio divisions were also created in 11 states.\n\nSeries included \"Professional Parade\", hosted by Fred Niblo; \"Experiments in Symphonic Drama\", original stories written for classical music; \"Gilbert and Sullivan Light Opera\", the complete works performed by Federal Theatre actors and recordings by D'Oyly Carte; \"Ibsen's Plays\", performances of 12 major plays; \"Repertory Theatre of the Air\", presenting literary classics; \"Contemporary Theatre\", presenting plays by modern authors; and the interview program, \"Exploring the Arts and Sciences\".\n\nThe radio division presented a wide range of programs on health and safety, art, music and history. The American Legion sponsored James Truslow Adams's \"Epic of America\". The children's program, \"Once Upon a Time\", and Paul de Kruif's \"Men Against Death\" were both honored by the National Committee for Education by Radio. In March 1939, at the invitation of the BBC, Flanagan broadcast the story of the Federal Theatre Project to Britain. Asked to expand the program to encompass the entire WPA, the radio division produced \"No Help Wanted\", a dramatization by William N. Robson with music by Leith Stevens. \"The Times\" called it \"the best broadcast ever sent us from the Americas\".\n\nA total of 81 of the Federal Theatre Project's 830 major titles were criticized by members of Congress for their content in public statements, committee hearings, on the floor of the Senate or House, or in testimony before Congressional committees. Only 29 were original productions of the Federal Theatre Project. The others included 32 revivals or stock productions; seven plays that were initiated by community groups; five that were never produced by the project; two works of Americana; two classics; one children's play; one Italian translation; and one Yiddish play.\n\nThe Living Newspapers that drew criticism were \"Injunction Granted\", a history of American labor relations; \"One-Third of a Nation\", about housing conditions in New York; \"Power\", about energy from the consumer's point of view; and \"Triple A Plowed Under\", on farming problems in America. Another that was criticized, on the history of medicine, was not completed.\n\nDramas criticized by Congress were \"American Holiday\", about a small-town murder trial; \"Around the Corner\", a Depression-era comedy; \"Chalk Dust\", about an urban high school; \"Class of '29\", the Depression years as seen through young college graduates; \"Created Equal\", a review of American life since colonial times; \"It Can't Happen Here\", Sinclair Lewis's parable of democracy and dictatorship; \"No More Peace\", Ernst Toller's satire on dictatorships; \"Professor Mamlock\", about Nazi persecution of Jews; \"Prologue to Glory\", about the early life of Abraham Lincoln; \"The Sun and I\", about Joseph in Egypt; and \"Woman of Destiny\", about a female President who works for peace.\n\nNegro Theatre Unit productions that drew criticism were \"The Case of Philip Lawrence\", a portrait of life in Harlem; \"Did Adam Sin?\", a review of black folklore with music; and \"Haiti\", a play about Toussaint Louverture.\n\nAlso criticized for their content were the dance dramas \"Candide\", from Voltaire; \"How Long Brethren\", featuring songs by future Guggenheim Fellowship recipient Lawrence Gellert; and \"Trojan Incident\", a translation of Euripides with a prologue from Homer.\n\n\"Help Yourself\", a satire on high-pressure business tactics, was among the comedies criticized by Congress. Others were \"Machine Age\", about mass production; \"On the Rocks\" by George Bernard Shaw; and \"The Tailor Becomes a Storekeeper\".\n\nChildren's plays singled out were \"Mother Goose Goes to Town\", and \"Revolt of the Beavers\", which the \"New York American\" called a \"pleasing fantasy for children\".\n\nThe musical \"Sing for Your Supper\" also met with Congressional criticism, although its patriotic finale, \"Ballad for Americans\", was chosen as the theme song of the 1940 Republican National Convention.\n\nA fictionalized view of the Federal Theatre Project is presented in the 1999 film \"Cradle Will Rock\", in which Cherry Jones portrays Hallie Flanagan.\n\n\n"}

From 1961 till 1991 she was a research fellow with the Museum of Puppets under the State Academic Central Puppet Theatre led by Sergey Obraztsov. She began her research career by investigating folk puppet shows in pre-revolutionary Russia, then in Europe and the Americas.. By the late 1960s she prepared some volume of documents, descriptions, and so on (about 3000 typed pages) on the history of the Russian folk puppet theatre. In 1993 a small part of this work was printed in the book \"Puppets come in the stage\". Beginning in the mid-1970s, Inna Solomonik turned to studies of oriental puppet performances. In 1980 she was ready with her PhD thesis. The kernel of this research was a semiotic analysis of the silhouettes of Wayang Purwa figures. Later Inna Solomonik continued to study the Asian puppet theatre, and published two monographs on the subject (1983, 1992). In 2001 she published the book-album on Javanese Wayang Beber.

{"id": "1992406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1992406", "title": "Jazz piano", "text": "Jazz piano\n\nJazz piano is a collective term for the techniques pianists use when playing jazz. The piano has been an integral part of the jazz idiom since its inception, in both solo and ensemble settings. Its role is multifaceted due largely to the instrument's combined melodic and harmonic capabilities. For this reason it is an important tool of jazz musicians and composers for teaching and learning jazz theory and set arrangement, regardless of their main instrument. (By extension the phrase 'jazz piano' can refer to similar techniques on any keyboard instrument.)\n\nAlong with the guitar, vibraphone, and other keyboard instruments, the piano is one of the instruments in a jazz combo that can play both single notes and chords rather than only single notes as does the saxophone or trumpet.\n\nA new style known as “stride” or “Harlem stride” emerged during the 1920s, predominantly in New York. James P. Johnson was a prominent adherent. The left hand was used to establish rhythm while the right hand improvised melodies.\n\nMastering the various chord voicings—simple to advanced—is the first building block of learning jazz piano. Jazz piano technique uses all the chords found in Western art music, such as major, minor, augmented, diminished, seventh, diminished seventh, sixth, minor seventh, major seventh, suspended fourth, and so on. A second key skill is learning to play with a swing rhythm and \"feel\". In jazz, the roots are usually omitted from keyboard voicings, as this task is left to the double bass player. Jazz pianists also make extensive use of chord \"extensions\", such as adding the ninth, eleventh or thirteenth scale degree to the chord. In some cases, these extensions may be \"altered\" i.e. sharpened or flattened, as in the case of a \"sharp 11\" chord.\n\nThe next step is learning to improvise melodic lines using scales and chord tones. This ability is perfected after long experience, including much practice, which internalizes the physical skills of playing and the technical elements of harmony, and it requires a great natural 'ear' for extemporaneous music-making. When jazz pianists improvise, they use the scales, modes, and arpeggios associated with the chords in a tune's chord progression. The approach to improvising has changed since the earliest eras of jazz piano. During the Swing era, many soloists improvised \"by ear\" by embellishing the melody with ornaments and passing notes. However, during the bebop era, the rapid tempo and complicated chord progressions made it increasingly harder to play \"by ear.\" Along with other improvisers, such as saxes and guitar players, bebop-era jazz pianists began to improvise over the chord changes using scales (whole tone scale, chromatic scale, etc.) and arpeggios.\n\nJazz piano (the technique) and the instrument itself offer soloists an exhaustive number of choices. One may play the bass register in an ostinato pattern, popular in boogie-woogie style, where the left hand repeats a phrase numerous times throughout a song, as performed by Rob Agerbeek in \"Boogie Woogie Stomp.\" The left hand can also be played as a melodic counterline that emulates the walking of an upright bass. In stride piano, (similar to the earlier ragtime) the left hand rapidly plays alternate positions between notes in the bass register and chords in the tenor register, while the right hand plays melody and improvises, as performed in George Gershwin's \"Liza\". The right hand may play melodic lines, or harmonic content, chordally or in octaves. It may also be played in lockstep with the left hand, using a double melody block chord called \"locked-hand\" voicing, or Shearing voicing—a technique popularized, though not invented, by the pianist and set leader George Shearing.\n\nJazz piano has played a leading role in developing the sound of jazz. Early on, black jazz musicians created ragtime on the piano. As the genre progressed the piano was usually featured in the rhythm section of a band, which was typically configured as one or more of piano, guitar, bass, or drums, or other instruments, such as the vibraphone.\n\nOver time, playing piano-accompaniment in ensemble sets, and then bands, changed from primarily time-keeping (consisting of repetitive left-hand figures) to a more flexible role. Ultimately, the skilled pianist was free both to lead and to answer the instrumental soloist, using both short and sustained, chordal and melodic, fragments—a technique known as 'comping'. Good comping musicians were capable of many and different chord voicings, so to match the various moods the different soloists were aiming for. In the early days not all leading pianists were concerned to provide comping. Others—notably Duke Ellington, who became famous during the Harlem Renaissance at the Cotton Club—earned great esteem among band members as well as other musicians. Ellington comped enthusiastically in support of the soloist and did much to develop the technique.\n\nJazz piano moved away from playing lead melody to providing foundation for song sets; soon, skilled jazz pianists were performing as soloists. In the 1940s and 1950s, a number of great piano players emerged. Pianists like Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell helped create and establish the sound of bebop. Bill Evans built upon the style of Bud Powell while adding a distinct classical influence to his playing while Oscar Peterson pushed rhythmic variations and was influenced by the style of Art Tatum, Teddy Wilson and Nat King Cole. Wynton Kelly, Red Garland, Herbie Hancock, and Keith Jarrett were also exceptional pianists who played with Miles Davis. Tommy Flanagan was featured by John Coltrane on his hit album \"Giant Steps\". McCoy Tyner is also an influential player who played with Coltrane.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2671685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2671685", "title": "Key light", "text": "Key light\n\nThe key light is the first and usually most important light that a photographer, cinematographer, lighting cameraman, or other scene composer will use in a lighting setup. The purpose of the key light is to highlight the form and dimension of the subject. The key light is not a rigid requirement; omitting the key light can result in a silhouette effect. Many key lights may be placed in a scene to illuminate a moving subject at opportune moments.\n\nThe key light can be \"hard\" (focused) or \"soft\" (diffused), and depending on the desired setup can be placed at different angles relative to the subject. When part of the most common setup—three-point lighting—the key light is placed at a 30–60° angle (with the camera marking 0 degrees). In addition to the horizontal angle, the key light can be placed high or low producing different effects. The most common vertical position for the key light is at a 30° angle (i.e. slightly above the eye line; the nose should not cast a shadow on the lips).\n\nA key light positioned low appears to distort the actor's features, since most natural or ambient light is normally overhead. A dramatic effect used in horror or comedy cinematography is a key light illuminating the face from below. A high key light will result in more prominent cheek bones and long nose shadows. Marlene Dietrich was famous for insisting that her key light be placed high.\n\nUsing just a key light results in a high-contrast scene, especially if the background is not illuminated. A fill light decreases contrast and adds more details to the dark areas of an image. An alternative to the fill light is to reflect existing light or to illuminate other objects in the scene (which in turn further illuminate the subject).\n\nIn addition to a key light, a back light may be added to \"separate\" the subject from the background. When the subject and/or camera are moving or turning around, the key light and back light may change roles.\n\nThe key light does not have to directly illuminate the subject: it may pass through various filters, screens, or reflectors. Light passing through tree leaves, window panes, and other obstacles can make a scene more visually interesting, as well as cue the audience to the location of the subject. The key light also does not have to be white light—a colored key (especially when used with fill/back lighting of other colors) can add more emotional depth to a scene than full white alone. In mixed indoor/outdoor daytime scenes, sunlight may appear to be a \"warm\" white, and indoor lighting to be a \"neutral\" or artificially-toned white. By contrast, moonlight appears to be \"cooler\" than indoor lighting.\n\nIn many cases, the key light is a stage light for indoor scenes, or sunlight for outdoors. A lighting instrument may also be used outdoors to supplement sunlight or as the primary light source with sunlight or skylight serving as fill lighting. Actual lamps, lighting fixtures, can serve as key lights, provided they are of sufficient brightness. They may also appear within the scene as props — in which case they are called \"practicals.\" Similarly, fire, candles and other natural sources of light can be used\n\n"}

On a technical note, dying-and-rising and vegetation gods and deities who descend into the underworld could be seen as specific types of liminal deities. They by their very nature must cross the boundary of life and death, probably the most important boundary there is, to be classified as such. Vegetation gods in particular must die and revive every year to mimic the dying and returning of plant life after winter, making them fairly permanent liminal deities. Dying-and-rising gods and those deities that descend into the underworld (typically to save a dead god and bring them back, thus hoping to make the deceased into a dying-and-rising god) are usually one-time ordeals, making these two categories \"lesser types\" of the liminal deity and the gods that take part in them temporary liminal deities.\n\nThe word \"liminal\", first attested to in English in 1884, comes from the Latin word \"limen\", meaning \"threshold\". \"Liminality\" is a term given currency in twentieth century anthropology by Victor Turner of the University of Chicago.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "51430647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51430647", "title": "Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe", "text": "Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe\n\nThe music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is the film and television scores composed by various composers for the films and television series of that franchise. Ramin Djawadi provided the first MCU music with his original score for \"Iron Man\" in 2008. Alan Silvestri was the first composer to work on multiple MCU films after he transitioned from scoring \"\" (2011) to \"Marvel's The Avengers\" (2012), while Brian Tyler was the first composer to reference the work of another MCU composer when he quoted Silvestri's \"Captain America March\" in his score for \"\" (2013). Silvestri has scored three MCU films, the most for any composer in the franchise, in addition to his contributions being referenced in multiple other films. \n\nOriginal music has also been composed for the Marvel One-Shots short film series, and other related projects of the MCU, including the fanfares for the two Marvel Studios logos, composed by Tyler and Michael Giacchino, respectively. Additionally, original songs have been created specifically for use in the franchise, including \"Make Way For Tomorrow, Today\" by Richard M. Sherman and \"Star Spangled Man\" by Alan Menken and David Zippel, both of which have been used in multiple MCU projects. The scores for every MCU film and television series have received album releases, and several compilation albums featuring existing songs used in the films have also been released.\n\nCritical response to the MCU's music has been mixed, with focus placed on a lack of memorable, identifiable themes that are comparable to other large media franchises, and on the lack of continuity between works. Despite this, some critics have shown appreciation for the individual work of some of the more traditional composers like Silvestri, and for Tyler's efforts in attempting to establish a consistent tone for the franchise and some thematic continuity between his scores and Silvestri's work.\n\nRamin Djawadi had been a fan of the character Iron Man as a child, saying that he always liked superheroes \"that actually don’t have any superpowers\". After \"Iron Man\" director Jon Favreau's previous collaborator John Debney was unavailable to score the film, Djawadi sought out the role himself. Filming on \"Iron Man\" had already been completed by the time Djawadi joined the production, and rather than wait until he could see the completed film, as he usually would, Djawadi began \"playing with ideas\" as soon as he saw the first trailer. Due to time constraints and the final cut of the film changing until \"the last possible minute\", Djawadi had help with arrangements and additional cues from Hans Zimmer and Remote Control Productions. Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, who makes a cameo appearance in the film, contributed guitar performances to the score.\n\nFavreau had a clear vision of heavy metal music and guitars for the project, saying that Tony Stark was more of a rock star than a traditional superhero, and \"there’s \"Spider-man\", \"Batman\" and all these superhero movies. This superhero movie’s different. I want to do something completely different, instead of going down the orchestral route. I want to do more rock and roll.\" Djawadi subsequently composed most of the film's score on guitar, before arranging it for orchestra. Djawadi composed several themes for the character of Tony Stark, representing his different moods and attitudes, all inspired by Robert Downey, Jr.'s performance. Other themes for the film are \"not so much character based, but rather plot based that carry you through the movie\". Musicians John O'Brien and Rick Boston, frequent collaborators with Favreau, provided a big band-style arrangement of the Iron Man theme song from the 1966 cartoon \"The Marvel Super Heroes\" for a scene where Stark attends a casino.\n\nDirector Louis Leterrier's first choice for composer on \"The Incredible Hulk\" was Craig Armstrong, once the arranger for Massive Attack, a band Leterrier was fond of and had collaborated with on the 2005 film \"Unleashed\"; this choice had surprised Marvel, who often had directors asking for the likes of John Williams or Danny Elfman, and the studio was hesitant due to Armstrong's lack of experience writing for action films. Leterrier listened to Armstrong's previous music while planning and editing the film, and music editor Peter Myles used Armstrong's work and similar music by others in the film's temp score. Armstrong chose not to listen to the temp, or watch Ang Lee's \"Hulk\", before composing the score, which he begun in his home in Glasgow, Scotland, before moving to Remote Control in Los Angeles to be closer to the production. The score was recorded in four days, resulting in little time for adjustments on the day, forcing Armstrong to \"create very specific demos\" that were \"completely accurate\" for Matt Dunkley to orchestrate. Leterrier favored an orchestral sound over electronics, \"because he didn’t want the work to sound dated so quickly\", though Armstrong did electronically enhance a lot of the orchestral recordings. Additionally, \"about half the score\" features various ethnic instruments performed by Pete Lockett.\n\nWhen Armstrong first began working in Glasgow, he did so with three sequences which he called \"the keys to opening up\" the score: the Abomination and the Hulk's alley fight, \"which was complex because of its choreography\"; Bruce Banner and Betty Ross' reunion, \"the romantic element of the score\"; and the Hulk and Betty in the cave, which \"combines The Hulk Theme and when Hulk and Betty are together, so the Bruce and Betty Theme was totally different than my music for The Hulk and Betty\". For the Hulk's theme, Armstrong compared it to Williams' main theme for \"Jaws\", with \"simple notation\" that \"summed up the complete concept\". The theme features a bass C note, with string glissandos up an octave and then back down to the original note. Other themes include Bruce Banner's theme, for \"when he’s alone and searching for the cure\"; two theme's for the Abomination, a dark one for the soldier Emil Blonsky and a more aggressive one for when he becomes a monster himself (the latter is combined with the Hulk theme when those character's fight); the love theme for Banner and Betty Ross; and a scientific theme, for \"when they are trying to crack the codes of the Hulk\". Joe Harnell's \"The Lonely Man\" theme for the 1978 \"The Incredible Hulk\" television series is briefly quoted in the cue \"Bruce Goes Home\", with Armstrong playing the piano for the piece himself.\n\nFor the sequel to \"Iron Man\", Debney returned to work with Favreau, replacing Djawadi as composer. Debney called his score for \"Iron Man 2\" \"quite different in many ways from the last score. This score while employing much guitar and more contemporary elements, it is also much bigger and darker in tone and scope.\" He described his music as \"Led Zeppelin with an orchestra\", and elaborated that \"The two scores share a common pedigree [of rock-and-roll and electric guitar] but are generally different. They are different scores with different results.\" Debney was not influenced by the AC/DC soundtrack for the film, feeling that \"the songs and score play two very different roles in the film\", and unlike the previous score he used a large choir for some of the film's more dramatic moments. Morello returned to again contribute guitar performances for the film, this time collaborating with Debney to write some of the music itself, with Debney first composing the score, and then working with Morello on the guitar parts and \"textures\".\n\nDebney called \"Iron Man 2\" \"odd in that there were not a lot of places where a true superhero theme could be played. Tony Stark is uber cool even as Iron Man, so, musically, we couldn’t state a full-blown superhero theme. The strains of Iron Man’s theme are heard only in a few spots by design. I’m hoping with future films, Iron Man might get his full-blown theme played aggressively.\" For instance, Debney recorded several different versions of the score for scenes where Stark puts on the Iron Man suit, each with \"different portions of the theme fleshed out or left out\". What was ultimately chosen \"was less thematic. It was sort of a groove with a little bit of French horn. Maybe that was the right choice, but it was a difficult decision. It was difficult to find the areas in the movie where we could let Tony be a superhero.\" He continued, \"There were moments where I wanted to play a scene broadly or make a love scene out of it but we were never able to go there\", such as for the end of the film where \"Tony finally kisses Pepper ... there were a couple of versions I did that were really gorgeous and lush but it just didn't fit. It's a different kind of movie because they kiss and then all of a sudden the mood is broken. It's just the nature of this character.\" Debney felt that this process led to the score being \"watered down and mashed up a little bit\" from what he originally intended. However, Debney did not feel the same about his music for the villain, Ivan Vanko, which he described as a personal \"joy\". He said that Favreau \"gave me a great opportunity to get into [the opening] scene and learn [Vanko]'s circumstances and to play sincerely sad music for him and the relationship he had with his father. Jon gave me the opportunity to morph that and turn it into something really dark and twisted. For me that was the most satisfactory part of the score and the film\". For Vanko's theme, the choir sang in Russian to \"capture the dark Russian soul\" of the character.\n\nDirector Kenneth Branagh's frequent composing collaborator Patrick Doyle called \"Thor\" \"the most commercially high profile film I have done since \"Frankenstein\"\", and noted that \"Marvel Studios have a brand in \"Thor\". Their interest, like mine, was for strong thematic material that would capture the essence of that brand.\" Branagh and Doyle wanted the score to have a contemporary feel, while Doyle \"was also eager for the score to contain a strong sense of melody, which [Branagh] responds to in my work. He was keen, as indeed I was, that the grand images were not in any way hyperbolized, and that there would be a balance between playing with, and against the images.\" To distinguish between the realms of Asgard and Earth musically, Doyle used \"broader orchestral strokes and thicker orchestration\" to depict the grandeur and beauty of Asgard, and more \"contemporary, electronic and percussion driven\" music for the Earth scenes, incorporating the then-popular ostinato technique \"in a symphonic way whenever appropriate\".\n\nDoyle took inspiration for the score from his own Celtic background, which he described as \"very intertwined\" with the Norse mythology that \"Thor\" is based on, as well as the works of Richard Wagner. He found the main challenge of the score to be composing a \"superhero theme\" for the titular character, and a second main theme representing Asgard, the latter of which Doyle wanted \"to come across as an old folk song from a Celtic world\". He noted that the Asgard theme develops throughout the film to also represent traveling, action, and fighting. Of the other themes he composed for the film, Doyle also noted a theme for Jotunheim, another world visited in the film. On specific instrumentation for the character of Thor, Doyle jokingly noted that a piccolo would be inappropriate, and that a character with such a big personality and physicality required \"a slightly more robust set of musical instruments: horns, low brass, slow strings etc.\" To represent the character's longing for home after he is banished from Asgard to Earth, Doyle used a cor anglais, which he felt also captured Thor's pathos and nobility.\n\nBy February 2011, Marvel chose Alan Silvestri to provide the score for \"\" after composing the \"iconic scores\" for \"Back to the Future\" and \"Forrest Gump\", over a number of other composers including Michael Giacchino, John Powell, and Henry Jackman. Silvestri then met with director Joe Johnston to spot the film, and had seven and a half weeks to compose the score. Johnston wanted a full orchestral score \"to allow for movement\" between the film's two genres: a period piece and a futuristic, high-tech sci-fi film. Silvestri noted the appropriateness of the fact that his style of music, which he describes as \"romantically heroic\", is often described by others as \"patriotic\", as well as his tendency to use brass instruments, which can \"compete sonically and give the music some kind of presence where it might not have any\", something necessary during the film's action sequences.\n\nIn Silvestri's first meeting with Johnston, the latter raised his desire for a central theme. On this, Silvestri said, \"To have some kind of musical signature either for a character or some aspect of the film, truly holds the score together. A theme makes the music feel like one piece in a sense.\" For this central theme, a fanfare for Captain America, Silvestri did not look to any past film scores in particular, instead looking to \"certain kinds of elements that we have, over time, associated with that kind of heroic statement\", such as the percussive elements, intervals, and brass instrumentation of Aaron Copland's \"Fanfare for the Common Man\". He noted that Captain America is a \"very bold and bombastic idea, so you don’t need to inflate that in any way. But that doesn’t mean you have to play those elements down either\", adding that he felt Captain America was fleshed out more as a character simply by facing \"a really bad guy\" in the Red Skull in a similar way to Luke Skywalker's development in the presence of Darth Vader. On the Red Skull himself, Silvestri looked to take the character seriously and \"play him as bad\", but allowed for more compassion for the character when he talks about his tortured past. He also introduced a theme for the Tesseract, Red Skull's energy source.\n\nIn November 2011, Marvel announced that Silvestri would return to compose the score for the crossover film \"Marvel's The Avengers\". Silvestri found it helpful to have already been part of the \"Marvel process\", which gave him a \"sense of how Marvel treats their characters, cares for them, and a bit of what that Marvel post-production process feels like\". Director Joss Whedon preferred an \"old-school ... old-fashioned\" score to using pre-existing songs, which he felt makes \"the moment [become] about the song\". He called Silvestri \"letter perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion ... but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love.\" Silvestri did not want the score to have the same \"military\" feeling as \"Captain America: The First Avengers\"s, as Stark says in the film \"We’re not soldiers.\" However, Whedon did want aspects of the film to resemble a war film, and \"there are times where [the Avengers are] absolutely functioning as this paramilitary unit\", so Silvestri did add some \"military seasoning\" in places. Both Whedon and Silvestri wanted the score to build throughout the film, to climax in the final battle. For the aftermath of that fight, Silvestri uses a simple guitar piece to give the audience a rest with a \"complete sonic break\" from what comes before in the film. He then segues back into the full orchestra for the end of the film. For a sequence where the villain Loki attacks while a string quartet plays Franz Schubert's String Quartet No. 13 in A minor, the editors had already overlaid the piece with a temp track for when Loki \"starts to do his thing\". Silvestri expanded on this for the final score, having the music transition from the onscreen quartet to the entire orchestra playing the same piece when the fighting begins.\n\nOn composing for a film with such a large cast, Silvestri said, \"I’ve worked on films where there have been a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world ... the film is really about the coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together.\" Later elaborating on this, Silvestri said, \"We knew that if we were to have a theme for every character in this movie, the music would get very clunky and intrusive. So I stayed away from all of that.\" Instead, Marvel and Whedon wanted a central, definable \"Avengers\" theme for the film, which Silvestri wanted to have a heroic aspect and a grandness, but also be \"generated from that scene when they’re all gathering for the last great battle ... the interesting thing about it as the 'big moment; of the score is that they’re not doing anything. They’re standing there, which allowed me to move away from the idea of it being an action moment.\" Silvestri did ultimately use some other themes in the score: he developed a motif for Loki as the central villain of the film, a \"low, ominous sequence of chords, [used] when his presence is either visible or implied\"; he reprised his Captain America theme, for when that character \"makes his entrance, or when he’s in the middle of a fight scene ... yet not using it fully\" as \"a little of his theme goes a long, long way\", and his Tesseract theme, including over the opening logos of the film; and midway through Silvestri's work writing the score, Whedon had seen some completed scenes featuring the Black Widow and \"wanted to explore music that was a bit more thematic for her\", so Silvestri introduced \"a lonely, plucked theme with an Eastern European flavor\" to define the character. For the other major characters, Silvestri used instrumentation to differentiate their scenes, for instance Iron Man \"always has the more contemporary, rhythmic component to a lot of his music.\"\n\nWith \"Iron Man 3\" featuring a post-\"Avengers\" Tony Stark, Marvel and incoming director Shane Black wanted to move away from the rock sound of the previous \"Iron Man\" films, and towards \"a score that echoed the classics of super hero film history\", for which they approached Brian Tyler, a Marvel fan whose previous music had often been used in temp scores for other films by the studio. Tyler stated that Marvel was interested in him for his more thematic work from the likes of \"The Greatest Game Ever Played\", \"Annapolis\", and \"Partition\", rather than his \"modern\" action music such as that for \"The Fast and the Furious\" films and \"\", and wanted him to combine the energy of the latter with the sensibilities of the former. In addition to the classic orchestra, Tyler recorded metallic sounds such as anvils being hit to add an element of \"iron\" to the score. As a nod to the previous \"Iron Man\" composer's use of guitars, Tyler added instances of the orchestra performing Black Sabbath-like riffs throughout the film.\n\nMarvel specifically asked Tyler for a new and different, \"really identifiable\" theme for Iron Man to represent his \"serious\" new role in the MCU as a \"legitimate superhero\", which Tyler described as a thematic reboot. To create a \"bigger and grander\" sound than the previous \"Iron Man\" scores, Tyler took influence from the works of John Williams, Alex North, and John Barry, among others. Tyler composed the new theme on piano, but always intended it to be a \"march and anthem\" with a large brass component. Tyler also used the same theme played on a harp to represent Stark's sad emotional state after he is stranded without the Iron Man suit, and created a \"wild 1960s style\" arrangement of it for the film's main titles which had reminded Tyler of a typical police series from that era. For the Extremis technology, Tyler wanted a motif with a magical quality as he felt that it was technology so futuristic that it seemed like magic, and so looked to Williams' \"The Well of the Souls\" cue from \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" for inspiration, giving the motif a spiritual feel. The idea of spirituality also extends to the Mandarin's theme; Tyler noted the ambiguity of the character in terms of ethnicity and culture, and how he appears in the film as a \"be-all\" terrorist, as well as his role as a fanatical, \"quasi-religious leader\" comparable to Jim Jones. The theme ultimately combines religious music from multiple cultures—including Monastic, Gothic, and Christian chants and choirs, and sounds from the Middle-East and Asia—and was primarily played on the bansuri and bazantar.\n\nBranagh chose not to return for the sequel to \"Thor\", and was replaced as director by Alan Taylor. By August 2012, Doyle had discussed potentially returning to score the film with Taylor, however, Taylor's first choice for composer was Carter Burwell, who signed on to \"\" by April 2013. A month later, Burwell left the film in what Marvel described as a \"creative split\", and Tyler signed on to replace him that June. President of Marvel Studios Kevin Feige later explained that Marvel had approved of Taylor's choice based on Burwell's collaborations with the Coen brothers, but the studio ultimately felt that Burwell was not the right fit for the film, and had to make an early decision to replace the composer due to the relatively short time left for post-production on the film; Feige admitted that if there was \"time for trial and error, it might have worked\" out. Tyler was chosen by Marvel to replace Burwell based on the positive experience the company had working with him on \"Iron Man 3\".\n\nOn differentiating his scores for \"Iron Man 3\" and \"The Dark World\", Tyler said that they were at the opposite ends of the \"superhero spectrum\", and so even though he used full orchestras for both, \"the actual writing of the notes and the harmonies and all that was different.\" He later elaborated that \"The feel of Thor is a very different than Iron Man. Yet they live in the same universe. For me, it’s like somehow Indiana Jones showed up on the Enterprise, or something.\" Tyler described \"The Dark World\" as \"science fiction meeting classic medieval war\", and saw it as a cross between \"Star Wars\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\"—\"there’s spaceships and lasers ... but within it they wear capes and fight with swords and ride horses ... those were not elements really present as much in the first one. So it required something different. I think my score for \"Thor: The Dark World\" would have been out of place in the first film and vice versa.\" Azam Ali, who collaborated with Tyler on \"Children of Dune\", and Tori Letzler are featured vocalists for the score; Tyler felt that their contributions provided \"something emotional\" to the score.\n\nRather than have Tyler reprise Doyle's themes from the first film, Marvel wanted Tyler to create a new, post-\"Avengers\" Thor theme as he did for Tony Stark in \"Iron Man 3\". Tyler described his new theme as mature, regal, and epic, and noted that the romantic elements with the character Jane Foster become \"kind of melancholy\" for the sequel, \"because she’s this mortal that he’s fallen for, which could not be further from his side of the train tracks\". The theme for Thor evolved from a more \"pageant\"-like theme that represents Asgard in the film, which has a much more lived-in feeling than it did in the first film. Tyler also introduced a new theme for post-\"Avengers\" Loki to reflect his increasingly complicated personality and storyline, performed on a harp to play against expectations. Despite not reprising Doyle's themes, Tyler looked to pay homage to his general style and sound from the first film during quieter moments like dialogue scenes. He also quotes Silvestri's Captain America theme when that character makes a brief cameo appearance.\n\nWhen Henry Jackman was in the running to score \"Captain America: The First Avenger\", he had written \"a full-on traditional symphonic, Americana score\" as proof-of-concept for Marvel, which he looked to return to when Marvel asked him to score the sequel, \"\". He felt that Silvestri had used that same style to great effect in the first film, but found that the second film \"could not have been more different, and the score was not suitable, so I had to rewrite it\". Jackman said of his work on the film, \"it’s 50% production and all the tricks I’ve learnt from spending years in the record industry but then it’s also got the kind of injection of symphonic, thematic, heroic music that all kind of merges into one musical, and hopefully coherent piece\". He described the film as aesthetically \"way closer to something like \"Dark Knight Rises\" than it is to say the Richard Donner's \"Superman\", or the traditional, nostalgic superhero film.\" Some of Silvestri's work from the first film is tracked into the opening of the sequel, which Jackman said \"reminds everyone where we left off. This character is about to get hurled into a completely different environment, so it’s a nice way to tie the two films together.\"\n\nJackman first created three pieces of music for directors Anthony and Joe Russo: a modern Captain America theme; a six-to-seven minute suite for the Winter Soldier; and a track representing Hydra. Concerning Captain America, Jackman struggled to balance having \"enough theme so that you’ve got something heroic to cling onto, but not so much that it’s just becoming nostalgic and irrelevant\", and stated that in the third act \"the more melodic, the more lyrical, the more thematic element [starts] to come through\". The one note Feige gave Jackman on the score was asking him to embrace \"those moments that are emotional or historical or nostalgic\", such as when the character visits his own Smithsonian exhibit. For those, Jackman took some inspiration from the works of Aaron Copland. Jackman described the Winter Soldier as \"a mechanized, violent, relentless, nihilistic beast that just destroys everything in its path\", so approaching the character in a Wagnerian way would be \"inappropriate ... instead [I decided] to embrace it and start exploiting all these other tricks I've learned in working in the record industry and making drum and bass records.\" In the Winter Soldier suite, \"the strings only show up for the last minute. It is violent—it's got screaming and banging and it's dystopian and dysfunctional. Much closer to a modern electronic thing than anything orchestral.\" Jackman spent ten days just processing vocal recordings to give the theme a sense of \"tortured, time-stretched human cries of someone who has been so processed that it's become mechanized at the same time but you can still hear the human in there\". He also tried to give the piece an arc, where the human elements get more \"revealed toward the end of the film\" as Captain America and the audience come to learn who the Winter Soldier is and care about him. When Jackman played the suite for the directors, they loved the unique and non-film music sound, and asked that Jackman not sanitize or water it down for the film—Joe said, \"I really want to hear that in the movie and not just 20% of\" it. For Hydra, Jackman wanted to move away from the \"Wagnerian symphonic baddie music\" of the first film, and \"come up with a sinister tonality that didn’t feel like the muhahahaha of an arch villain, because the sinister nature of the neo-fascist within the film is modern, credible and politically contemporary.\" Jackman also introduces a motif for the Falcon.\n\nAs he did on his previous films, director James Gunn brought his composer Tyler Bates onto \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" in pre-production so Bates could write music ahead of time for Gunn to film to. Gunn provided material such as \"pre-video sequences\" for Bates to use while writing the music, and then \"during action scenes and huge dramatic moments we blare the score on set so that the cast, crew, and camera can move in harmony with the music. Music is often an afterthought in film, but never for us.\" Bates then re-wrote most of the score once the film was being edited. Bates found the score to be his \"most demanding\", and explained that \"at least half the cues in the movie have more than 500 tracks of audio\", consisting of multiple orchestral passes, choirs, overdubs, and other instrumentation. On working in with all of the songs that Gunn put in the film's soundtrack, Bates said, \"The music is literally a different personality in the movie, has a different function than the songs. It exists more, not only to be propulsive in the action sequences and to set up some of the comedic moments, but really to underscore the emotional depth of the characters.\"\n\nBates said on using themes and motifs in the score, \"Very few movies that are made these days are fantastical enough to sustain huge, bold identifiable themes. Even with the majority of the comic-book films, they have a tendency to be steeped in a realism that would be disturbed or interrupted by highly emotive, melodic themes, and it seems like a lot of the stuff going in these films is propulsive and somewhat cold emotionally.\" He felt that \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" did not fit this model, and \"unabashedly embraced leitmotifs for the array of cosmic characters\" that appear in it. Bates described creating a new main theme for a Marvel franchise as \"the most rewarding aspect of stepping into a movie like this\". Gunn asked for \"something kickass that a 4-year-old would remember\", and Bates came up with the theme by \"noodling\" on an electric guitar. The villain Ronan's theme is quoted in full only once in the film, as Bates and Gunn wanted him to be more serious and scary which they felt would be undermined by a loud, melodic theme. His presence is generally represented with tones \"chock full of low-brass\" and synths. Bates has \"some spongy synthesizers pulsing through\" the motif for Groot, which he developed in pre-production. Bates said that he would have infused the score with more of those electronic elements if it was not for the \"frenetic working process\" on the film.\n\nAfter scoring both \"Iron Man 3\" and \"Thor: The Dark World\", Brian Tyler was rumored for several months to be scoring \"The Avengers\" sequel \"\", before officially signing on to the film in March 2014. He said that his template for the film was game changing scores such as those for \"Star Wars\", \"Superman\", and \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", feeling that \"You have to build in nostalgia and do it upfront so you can relate to it.\" In February 2015, Danny Elfman was revealed to have composed additional music for the score, ultimately receiving co-composer credit. On working with Elfman, Tyler said, \"The movie is such a large canvas that there were parts that really benefited from his kind of voice. But also, it needed to all fit together and hang together seamlessly, and that was something we worked really hard on doing.\" Tyler and Elfman strove to orchestrate, record, and mix their music similarly. Tyler wrote much more quiet and emotional music for \"Age of Ultron\" \"than you would've thought ... you can go deeper in a second movie because in the first movie you really have to set everyone up\". He gave Hulk's farewell to Black Widow, Quicksilver's sacrifice, and the time spent at Hawkeye's farm as examples of this.\n\nTyler stated that his usual approach to taking over a franchise from another composer is to \"try to take from what's before me and also forge ahead\". So, though Tyler \"was really married to\" the idea of reprising Silvestri's Avengers theme from the first film in the sequel and wanted to keep in-line with \"the language of what Alan had done in \"The Avengers\"\", he instead began by composing a \"classic, epic\" suite of his own for the film. Titled \"Rise Together\", Tyler said that it \"is much more about pageantry and a march, and there's a slight militaristic aspect. I tend to stay away from that, but I felt that that, combined with a choir, would make them feel larger than life. And certainly, this is when they're 'rising together,' so you need to have that unifying heroic theme with them.\" Elfman then took Silvestri's theme and \"pulled it into\" the new material for the sequel to make a \"kind of a hybrid\" theme for the film. Tyler also looked to reference his own Iron Man and Thor themes in the score, as well as previous Captain America material, \"in order to create a similar musical universe\", especially since those character's post-\"Avengers\" solo films \"set up\" \"Age of Ultron\".\n\nTyler composed several other new themes for the film, to represent the titular villain Ultron; the relationship that develops between Black Widow and the Hulk; and the new Avenger Vision. Tyler wanted Ultron's theme to sound \"almost heroic\", since Ultron thinks he is saving the world, \"but dissonant and tweaky enough\" to reflect that \"he doesn't quite have it right\" and is still a villain. The melody is simple so that it is easy to remember, but starts flat by one note to make the theme sound slightly \"off\", is played on two pianos with one of them out of tune, and when the main phrase is repeated the last note is played \"ahead by a beat\" the second time; \"not only out of tune, but out of time.\" The theme also features an artificially distorted guitar to give it a machine-like tone. Tyler described the Black Widow/Hulk relationship as an \"unrequited romance and this kind of sad situation\" with \"the curse of the Hulk being a barrier between [the two characters] and what they really want. And so that melody, that had to be almost like a lullaby, but broken.\" Tyler wrote the \"lullaby\" to be understated, and it is often played on piano or cello. For the Vision's theme, Tyler \"wanted to go for something that was underneath and delicate, and had kind of a wispy nature to it, in a sense—and almost towards the romantic\". He tried to reflect the character's role as a messianic figure of sorts, and Ultron's intended redemption for Earth, and said, \"you don’t really know what side he’s on. You have this guy who’s literally two minutes old and is born in this movie with this knowledge of humanity. It’s Machiavellian in a way.\" The theme is an adagio that is \"not your typical bombast, look how muscley this guy is; it’s more of a mystery.\" To represent the character's youth and questions about himself, it features string glissandos that constantly change between chords during his introduction, and often momentarily settle on uncertain notes and sounds. Tyler constantly instructed the orchestra to play quieter, \"trying to say more with less for Vision\". The music for the visions that the Scarlet Witch gives the Avengers pays homage to scores from the 1950s, with Tyler using a \"randomly played\" vibraphone and strings such as a harp to create a \"dreaminess\" and \"hypnotic effect\".\n\nSteven Price was announced as the composer for \"Ant-Man\" by director Edgar Wright, who he had previously worked with, in February 2014, but they both left the film that March. In January 2015, Christophe Beck was hired to score the film, having previously worked with the new director, Peyton Reed. Beck and Reed began experimenting with \"high concept\" electronic music to create a \"glitched out, digital, electronic, skittery score\" that could represent the insect and technology aspects of the film, but it was ultimately \"too weird and quirky ... almost weird for its own sake\". Feige asked that they instead take \"the classic symphonic approach with big themes and bold brass\", which Beck did with the unique twist of \"a sneaky sense of fun since it is, after all, not only a superhero movie, but also a heist comedy.\" That heist genre gave Beck \"a little latitude to use a rhythm section and something a little bit more funky and jazzy and groovy that I wouldn’t otherwise have been able to get away with.\"\n\nBeck composed two main themes for the film: the Ant-Man superhero theme and a theme for family. In addition to using the traditional brass for the Ant-Man theme, Beck used an alto flute and violas, which he felt had \"a little bit of the sound world of the heist movie and the spy movie, the old James Bond sound.\" For a sequence where Ant-Man surfs down a water pipe on a raft made of ants, Beck began arranging the theme as a \"regular action cue\" but found it \"a little too intense for the scene\". Reed wanted it to have more of a sense of fun, and Beck eventually wrote a piece evoking the \"classic guitar surf music\", but with the orchestra rather than a guitar. The family theme represents the film's two father-daughter relationships, between Scott Lang and his daughter Cassie, and between Hank Pym and his daughter Hope van Dyne. Beck also intended for it to \"signify the emergence of Hope as something of a hero herself\". Additionally, the villainous Yellowjacket has \"a more traditional theme, presented in traditional fashion, but augmented with processed electronics to convey the crazed and obsessed nature of the character\". Of the many ant species featured in the film, Reed and Beck felt that the bullet ants deserved their \"own identity\"; since the species is primarily indigenous to South America, Beck used ancient Aztec drums and tribal flutes to give them a \"regional flavor\". For a scene where Ant-Man infiltrates the Avengers headquarters, Beck quotes Silvestri's Avengers theme and Jackman's Falcon motif from \"Winter Soldier\".\n\nThe Russo brothers confirmed in August 2014 that Jackman would return to score \"\". In July 2015, Jackman noted the industrial elements of his Winter Soldier suite from the previous film was an indication of what the new score would sound like, but did caution that \"it's just a jumping off point since the Russos are looking for something new—similar with a twist.\" Once Jackman read the script for the film, he realized that the \"movie tonally was so different to the second one ... it’s sort of half Captain America, half an \"Avengers\" film in a way\" and so Jackman ultimately wrote a much more symphonic and orchestral score than he did for \"Winter Soldier\". This culminates in the final fight between Captain America, Winter Soldier, and Iron Man, the music for which Jackman described as \"somewhat operatic and ... almost classical in its style ... some of the harmony and the orchestration really does get quite classical.\"\n\nConcerning the central conflict of the film, Jackman found that he was in \"constant danger of tipping it too much\" and pushing the audience to one side or the other, so he composed a new main theme for the film to represent that Civil War, which he called \"a generic theme to balance everything out\", and \"a narrative theme toward which all the characters can gravitate. It wrapped them all up and it helped to bind the movie together rather than do endless disparate themes.\" The second major theme in the film is a thriller theme, that appears whenever the central mystery surrounding several character's pasts and Zemo's plan is teased or explored. It consists of a flute motif tied to the Winter Soldier's Russian handlers and a rising adagio that represents Zemo's twisted determination, and was inspired by the works of Jerry Goldsmith. Of the character themes from previous films that Jackman did use, \"where appropriate\", he evolved them to fit the tone and style of the new score. Captain America's theme could not be too prominent or heroic, as that would suggest that he was the hero of the film when the Russos were trying to create an ambiguity surrounding the main conflict—this does change throughout the film though, becoming more heroic when Captain America \"turns out to be right all along\". For the Winter Soldier, Jackman took a \"rising string rhyme\" that was buried underneath \"the chaos and the industrial stuff\" in the end of the character's suite from \"The Winter Soldier\", and developed that into a much more symphonic theme for the character, in keeping with his much more human portrayal in this film.\n\nJackman also wrote motifs for the major characters introduced in the film: Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Zemo. Spider-Man's motif has a small arc to match that character's few appearances, being introduced very gently as the \"somewhat confused, slightly tender\" Peter Parker first appears, followed by \"the seed of his heroism\" when he is recruited for the Avengers, and finally a \"full-blown version\" plays when he fights alongside the other heroes. For Black Panther, Jackman used a combination of African woodwind instruments whenever the character talks about his ancestors, while muted trombones \"brought his character into the grandeur of the symphony orchestra, but there’s a slightly vengeful, serrated sound to muted trombones if you pick the right kind of mood\". Zemo's personal theme was performed on \"a lot of these rather unusual tuned bells\" that gave him an \"otherly sound\", as well as a cimbalon to represent his Eastern European roots.\n\nHaving known Kevin Feige for some time, Michael Giacchino spent years working with him on potentially scoring one of Marvel's films. When he heard of development on \"Doctor Strange\", Giacchino was particularly interested in working on the film, feeling that it would have more of an independent film feel than other Marvel films. He contacted Feige, \"and that ball just rolled very quickly downhill, and I was on\" the film. Giacchino revealed his involvement with \"Doctor Strange\" in May 2016. Director Scott Derrickson called the score \"magic in the literal sense of the word\" and said that Giacchino \"is doing what good scorers do, which is he is not just creating music that supports the images, he's adding a third thing to the movie. It becomes something new with his music in there that it didn't have with temp music.\"\n\nFor the score, Giacchino felt no pressure to align his music with the style or tone of previous MCU films, and \"in fact they encouraged me to go in my direction, so there were never any handcuffs put on me.\" In regards to the title character, Giacchino felt the key \"was getting inside of him—not worrying so much about the magic stuff, more just thinking about who he was as a person, what he lost and then how that loss affected him. For me it's a very sad story, and a lot of the music has this very melancholy feel to it.\" To particularly differentiate the score, and help create a \"mystical mood\", Giacchino used a harpsichord and an electric sitar.\n\nBates was confirmed to be returning for the second \"Guardians\" film, \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\", in August 2015, and began composing by that December for Gunn to once again film to. On using this technique again on the sequel, Bates said, \"We’ve gone even further down that road ... I would rather establish the DNA of our music prior to post-production when everything’s so frenetic so that we can work on themes and establish melodies that are original to the film.\"\n\nWhile promoting \"Doctor Strange\" in early November 2016, Feige accidentally revealed that Giacchino would be returning to compose the score for \"\". Giacchino soon confirmed this himself.\n\nBy August 2016, Mark Mothersbaugh was set to score the .\n\nWanting to put a \"personal stamp\" on \"Black Panther\" and differentiate it from other MCU films, director Ryan Coogler looked to bring back several of his previous collaborators to work on the film, including composer Ludwig Göransson, whom he had worked with on \"Fruitvale Station\" and \"Creed\".\n\nSilvestri announced in June 2016 that he would be returning to score \"\".\n\nIn June 2017, Reed confirmed that Beck would be returning to score \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\".\n\nIn June 2018, Pinar Toprak announced that she would score \"Captain Marvel\", the first female composer for the MCU.\n\nSilvestri announced in June 2016 that he would be returning to score the sequel to \"Avengers: Infinity War\".\n\nIn October 2018, Giacchino was confirmed to return to score \"\".\n\nMarvel's first two Marvel One-Shot short films, \"The Consultant\" and \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer\", were both scored by DJ Paul Oakenfold.\n\nThe third One-Shot, \"Item 47\", had a bigger scope and budget than the previous shorts. Marvel approached Christopher Lennertz to provide a \"big and fun and funny\" score; Lennertz described the One-Shots as \"a little quirkier than the movies, in terms of making sure that they’re fast and they usually have a little bit more of a comedic bent to it\". Lennertz' score for the short is \"rock-based\", with a lot of electronics and guitars. For the opening bank robbery, \"We had a big twangy low guitar theme, almost like a Jack White kind of a thing on guitar\". At the end of the short, when money 'rains down', Lennertz paid homage to Ennio Morricone with vocals in a \"classic spoofy\" way.\n\nLennertz, who returned to score the One-Shot, and D'Esposito, the director, wanted a more traditional, orchestral score for \"Agent Carter\", with D'Esposito wanting to balance the period setting and modern Marvel superhero feel. D'Esposito referenced Johnny Rivers' \"Secret Agent Man\", \"even though it was in the 60's\" as inspiration. Lennertz felt D'Esposito \"did a terrific job getting that [feeling with the One-Shot] and reaching that\" while having \"a James Bond secret agent sentiment to it too.\" To create the score, Lennertz \"put together a big band, combined it with an orchestra, and added modern electronic and dub-step elements\", to represent the 40s setting, the Marvel feeling, and the advanced technology, respectively.\n\nWith \"All Hail the King\" serving as a spin-off/sequel to \"Iron Man 3\", many crew members from the film worked on the short alongside returning actor Ben Kingsley, including composer Brian Tyler. He described his music for \"All Hail the King\"—which features a title sequence inspired by \"Dr. No\", \"Charade\", and \"Iron Monkey\", as well as other exploitation films \"ranging from obscure Kung Fu to funky Italian Horror\"—as \"retro vibed\".\n\nFor Marvel's first television series set in the MCU, the Whedon-created \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\", frequent genre television series composer Bear McCreary signed on to compose the score. \"The series centers on the behind-the-scenes people, their heroism and their quirks,\" McCreary explained, \"As such, the music I wrote is heroic and, at times, quirky and offbeat.\" McCreary spoke at length with Whedon \"about the challenge of creating a score that is big enough in its orchestral presence that it feels cinematic and feels at home in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It also must capture the intimate human characteristics that define this series. In editorial, it became clear that simply tracking in typical big 'superhero movie' music wasn’t going to work. So Joss helped guide me to find a sound that lives a little in both worlds.\" McCreary worked with several soloists throughout the series, including Oingo Boingo guitarist Steve Bartek; vocalist Raya Yarbrough; composer Jeremy Zuckerman playing the gu zheng for \"Girl in the Flower Dress\"; and cellist Eric Buyers for when \"the cellist\" character Audrey performs in \"The Only Light in the Darkness\".\n\nIn addition to his orchestral music for the series, McCreary intertwined \"these intricate symphonic layers ... with complex synthesizer programming, giving the score a modern edge.\" He described this programming as \"clean\", with \"warm, round tones, built from simple sine waves with rudimentary reverb, delay and filters added for personality.\" With the second season, McCreary permanently expanded the brass section and \"thinned out\" the woodwinds section to give the orchestra \"more weight in the lower frequencies\", matching the darker look and tone of the season. He also cut back on his use of electric guitar, which was often used for Skye before she became an official agent; McCreary felt that \"a common instrument that stood out from the epic orchestral texture associated with our true S.H.I.E.L.D. agents\" had felt more natural for the then \"lovable hacker, a relatable outsider from our world\". He also evolved his synthesizer use, making them \"mangled under heavy distortion, mutilated beneath waves of noise\". After the introduction of the Inhumans, McCreary expanded the sound of the score \"in a big way\" for the third season, adding larger percussion, and many more trombones than previously, which required the recording space to be reconfigured. For \"Maveth\", McCreary used a 90-piece orchestra rather than the series' typical 50 or 70 players.\n\nMcCreary saw his main theme for the series, which also represents the central team of agents, as primarily being a theme for Phil Coulson. McCreary noted that \"in one of the movies that would be inappropriate. You wouldn't do that for Coulson when Thor or Captain America are in the same story. But here Coulson is the hero ... It's all about him.\" McCreary initially wrote the theme in F major, \"giving it a very triumphant sound\", with one instance in the pilot diminishing it to F minor. Executive producer Jed Whedon \"astutely pointed out that the minor version was more satisfying than the major version\", and so McCreary 'tweaked' the theme permanently into F minor. ABC and Marvel allowed McCreary to use a full symphonic orchestra for every episode, and so there is \"a full section of brass that's pounding out his theme when he comes out in his heroic moments.\" McCreary had to work harder than usual to make the theme heard, given that the show does not have a traditional title sequence. To accompany the main theme, McCreary wrote an ostinato \"that doesn’t draw as much attention to itself as a full-blown melody. I use this catchy little riff to build up steam before sweeping statements of the Main Theme.\"\n\nMike Peterson's theme is most commonly performed on a solo electric guitar—McCreary felt that \"the image of a single guitar player trying to hold his own against a 90-piece orchestra is a nice metaphor for how Mike must feel\"—which is \"consumed by distorted synthesizers and low brass\" whenever the darker or more unstable sides of the character's superpowers are shown. McCreary also introduced a theme for the mysterious Centipede group in the pilot. \"To imply the centipede-nature of the theme,\" McCreary \"used ten notes, divided into two groups of 5. Played on delicate bells and de-tuned piano, the percussive nature of the notes evokes two rows of tiny insect feet crawling across a string.\" This theme also comes to represent the group's leader, the Clairvoyant. The emotional bond between the central characters is represented by \"The Agents\" theme, a much more intimate and accessible idea than the main theme. McCreary described the theme as unfolding \"essentially like a pop-song, with a simple A-B-A-A structure\". The Skye theme is most clearly heard in emotional moments dealing with that character's backstory, but also appears in many other variations, including brief, romantic statements to highlight her early relationship with Grant Ward. Fitz and Simmons' theme is \" less melodic than the other themes, and more motivic. It’s essentially an ostinato that rolls over itself again and again, evolving into subtly different variations with each turn through the pattern. This musically emulates their speaking pattern, where they are constantly stumbling over one another and saying the same thing in slightly different ways.\" \"The Hub\" introduces the audience (and Skye) to \"Big S.H.I.E.L.D.\", as opposed to Coulson's small team, which McCreary gave its own, more militaristic theme. The theme for John Garrett has two parts, an ostinato and a melody, and \"represents his adventurous personality, designed to be fun, bouncy and as far away from ominous as possible\".\n\nThe episode \"Turn, Turn, Turn\" reveals to the series' characters that Hydra has infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. For much of the episode, they believe that Agent Victoria Hand, who was introduced in \"The Hub\", is a Hydra agent, and so the Big S.H.I.E.L.D. theme functions as the series' Hydra theme. Once John Garrett is revealed to be the traitor, and the Clairvoyant, the Centipede became the new Hydra theme, though McCreary continued to use his Garrett theme rather than outright replace it with the Hydra theme as Bill Paxton's \"performance after being revealed as the Clairvoyant is even more fun and energetic. So, his theme still fits him perfectly, it just shows us a different side of his personality.\" With the second season came new Hydra characters, and their new MacGuffin, the Obelisk, for which McCreary wanted to use a Hydra theme. Feeling that his previous themes had become too complicated during the first season, and were too tied to that season's narrative, McCreary composed a new Hydra theme, which \"in true bad-guy-theme fashion ... is constructed from distantly related minor chords, and contains lots of close intervals.\"\n\nMcCreary created his own theme for the Tesseract, \"an ominous melodic line that shifts between two distantly related minor chords\", and for Asgard, \"like an old fanfare, a melody that capture[s] the majesty of Asgardian nobility\" though it is generally performed as a \"smaller version\" since the series is still \"rooted in reality\". However, when Peggy Carter makes guest appearances on the series through flashbacks, McCreary quotes Christopher Lennertz's \"Agent Carter\" theme. McCreary said on this, \"I was excited for the opportunity to incorporate his music into my S.H.I.E.L.D. score, because it further cements the Marvel [Cinematic] Universe together as a coherent whole ... Chris was thrilled and sent me his scores for reference.\"\n\nIn June 2014, after a television series extension of the One-Shot \"Agent Carter\" was ordered by ABC, the short's composer Christopher Lennertz talked about the possibility of him being involved with the series saying Louis D'Esposito, the One-Shot director also involved with the series, wanted Lennertz involved, before officially signing on to compose for the series that September. On his music for the series, Lennertz said, \"I get to mix a lot of things that don’t often get to go together in terms of period, music, jazz, trumpet, mixed with orchestra, mixed with electronics and brushes on a drum set and things.\" He researched \"what was going on between '46 and 1950 and what it was that would be part of that era ... I knew Count Basie. I knew Glenn Miller, all those things were happening at the time, but then we also figured out that it was sort of changing from big band to smaller jazz ensembles.\" This led to Lennertz focusing a lot on trumpets for Peggy Carter's sound, \"which makes a lot of sense because it’s also very sneaky, and it lends itself to espionage and that kind of thing\". Lennertz introduced a folk choral piece performed by a Russian men's choir during \"The Iron Ceiling\".\n\nJohn Paesano sought out the composer role for the first Marvel/Netflix series, \"Daredevil\", after he had previously worked with showrunner Steven S. DeKnight on a proof of concept. After successfully auditioning for the job, Paesano joined the series several weeks into post-production, and had to provide around 25–30 minutes of music per episode. He averaged \"around an episode every four or five days\". DeKnight \"had a very clear vision of what he wanted. He wanted to really keep the show grounded and he wanted to make it feel real and not so fantastical like some of the other Marvel properties were. He wanted music you could feel and not necessarily hear. We cut the score to be minimalistic.\" Once Daredevil gets his superhero costume at the end of the first season, \"the music starts to change color and we start to get more in to that Marvel universe.\" Due to his schedule and the style of the score, Paesano ultimately used mostly electronic sounds and music, but did try to add acoustic instruments, such as cellos, where possible to have more of a hybrid sound, often using these in non-traditional ways. Instead of more traditional percussion, Paesano used a low pulse throughout the series, emulating a heartbeat since the titular character often listens to people's heartbeats with his heightened senses. Paesano took inspiration from James Newton Howard's \"Michael Clayton\" score for the series' lawyer-oriented scenes.\n\nOn returning for the series' second season, with new showrunners Douglas Petrie and Marco Ramirez (who had worked with DeKnight on the first season), Paesano felt that the two \"really were true to what we were trying to do\" with the first season, but the score still changed to reflect the new elements of season two \"that we had to acknowledge. Obviously we have two characters being introduced, we have the Punisher and Elektra, and they both have their own backstories, their own interactions with Matt Murdock, so there are way more branches in this season than there were last season ... we just had to broaden the score to handle some of these different stories.\" Paesano continued, \"even though there are these new stories, it’s still in the same Hell’s Kitchen atmosphere that we’re creating. So there’s definitely differences, but it’s not like we all of the sudden went into John Williams territory ... it’s definitely a very grounded show but it definitely jumps up a couple levels.\" Paesano worked closely with the series' sound design team, spotting episodes with them to coordinate where \"we were going to hit what\" and \"maintain that definable aspect of New York\" and its sound.\n\nFor his audition, Paesano created a demo which included a simple piano motif. Though this material would usually not be used in the final score, in this instance Paesano took the motif and converted it into a main theme for the series, which becomes the theme for Daredevil in the show. The final theme was co-composed by Braden Kimball. The first episode ends with a montage that the editors originally temped with a song, but DeKnight wanted to use original music instead. Paesano subsequently wrote a more \"songish\" version of the main theme for the sequence, with a basic verse-chorus-verse structure, and instrumentation such as guitars and a drum kit to retain the feel and energy of the originally chosen song. Besides the main theme, Paesano tended to focus more on \"a feel and a tone and a sound\" rather than \"Star Wars\"-style motifs and \"heavy, thematic, melodic elements\". The approach for villain Wilson Fisk was to juxtapose \"this big bullish threatening character\" with \"light and sparse and elegant\" classical music. For when his \"evil twisted side\" shows through, Paesano \"took classical pieces of music and I twisted them up and played them backwards or redid some of the harmony or put them through distortion and created a classical vibe but really mangled and twisted\". For Stick, Paesano used a cello bow on the neck of the cello, a technique called col legno, to replicate the sound of the blind man's cane. Paesano described his \"themes\" for Punisher and Elektra in the second season as \"angry\" and \"mystical\" sounding, respectively.\n\nAt a San Diego Comic-Con panel in 2015, Sean Callery revealed that he would be composing the score for \"Jessica Jones\". The series' showrunner, Melissa Rosenberg, asked for Callery based on his work for \"Homeland\", which she felt sounded like it could serve \"Jessica Jones\" well. However, Callery's music for the latter ultimately became \"something so completely and wonderfully different\" once he started exploring the tone and \"color\" of \"Jessica Jones\". Callery found that the more intimate and organic his music, the more it \"clicked with the series\". To match the series' psychological thriller and neo-noir tone, Callery used a \"smaller ensemble, it's almost like a jazz score, but there's some very weird, gooey sound design elements that kind of come in\". Callery was influenced by the style and works of Bill Evans for the score. Rosenberg often asked Callery to have the music \"do less\", such as when he scored a fight sequence as a big, percussive superhero scene, and Rosenberg felt that even then the series should feel intimate; she suggested Callery just use a regular drum kit for the fights instead. Callery's assistant Jamie Forsyth also contributed to the music for the series.\n\nCallery did not begin composing the series' main theme until after reading two or three scripts, and did not see the opening graphics until after the second episode, at which point he had \"a framework for a theme that [he] hoped would work\". At this time, Callery said he started \"fooling around\" with ideas for the theme, and eventually settled on one that he felt had a \"sneaky and fun\" quality, adding, Jessica Jones \"has dry humor, a real edge to her. But there was something to this character that had a little whisker of playfulness in there, like a cat or something.\" After creating the theme, Callery expanded it, adding a \"fun\" rhythmic quality, and eventually fully orchestrating it to include a piano, which he played himself, as well as instruments such as the acoustic bass, and additional sound design. Regarding the electric guitar's entrance, Callery pointed out that it got \"bigger there because as I looked at the graphics, the lights got a little more strobe-y. So that's when I decided the electric guitar might be a kind of neat add there so that the whole piece will arc a little more.\"\n\nJessica Jones has several personal themes that Callery \"wove throughout the series\", which he found to be most effective when played on solo instruments—\"Whether they were guitar or solo piano, we always found that when the textures and the orchestration were minimal, soloistic, and expressive it just hit the right tone.\" One theme for the character represents \"a light inside of her that is untouched by the cruelties that have befallen her. I stopped short of saying that it’s a happy theme, but it’s about her untouched pure self that she can trust in and is truly hers; it’s one of compassion and of caring.\" Another is more inline with her outward appearance and personality, which Callery described as tough and resilient, and \"something that she totally owns\". For the villainous Kilgrave, who is not seen in some of the series' early episodes, Callery \"had to suggest his presence without actually seeing him. So initially he had a moody tone to him, which eventually started morphing into a darker theme\" as the character physically appears and begins to play a larger role in the series.\n\nIn April 2016, showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker revealed that Adrian Younge and Ali Shaheed Muhammad were composing the music for \"Luke Cage\", with \"a '90s hip-hop vibe\". Coker had contacted Younge and Muhammad separately, asking if they would like to work together on the series, not knowing that the pair were already working together on an album. Younge and Muhammad composed the score as if they were creating 13 albums, one for each episode, with the music inspired by Wu-Tang Clan, Ennio Morricone, and Muhammad's group A Tribe Called Quest. Muhammad felt that the music was \"about getting that hip-hop foundation and making sure those drums were as big as day\", while Younge said, \"we wanted to make something great. Not just for black people or minorities, just something great that just happens to be based on our culture.\" The duo composed around twenty minutes of music for each episode, composing the entire season's score in nine months.\n\nYounge and Muhammad looked at all of the different sounds of Harlem, including hip-hop, jazz, blues, and psychedelic rock, to give each character \"their own theme and their own sound\" that was all still representative of the culture. For Luke Cage specifically, Coker noted that he is a character who understands the roots of the modern culture, and understands where modern Harlem and hip-hop sensibilities originated, so Younge and Muhammad looked to the beginnings of modern hip-hop for his sound. For Cage's more dramatic or emotional moments, vocalist Loren Oden was used as \"kind of like [Cage's] inner voice\". For the character of Diamondback, opera singer Brooke deRosa, whom Younge had often worked with before, was used. To reflect the character Cottonmouth's status in the series as a musician who primarily plays the Fender Rhodes, the composers \"pretty much exclusively use Fender Rhodes keyboards for him. That is who he is.\" The most difficult episode for the composers was the fourth, which features flashbacks to Cage's time in prison. They felt that the episode's temp music was \"all over the place, and it didn’t feel cohesive\", and were unsure whether to illustrate the idea of an incarcerated black man using \"old slave-blues-type\" music, to go with a \"Bernard Herrmann–Alfred Hitchcock-type scary vibe\", or to stick with \"straight hip-hop, '90s stuff\". Younge offered that there was \"some intense thinking, but it wasn’t necessarily difficult to execute once we figured it out.\"\n\nTrevor Morris was revealed to be composing the music for the first season of \"Iron Fist\" in late October 2016. The producers of the series wanted a \"modern\" sounding score, so Morris focused on synthesizer sounds and made a rule that traditional orchestral instruments, such as strings and horns, would not be used for the series. He said that by \"taking those heavy-hitters off the table, it leaves you to find a unique way to solve these problems. That sound is also very fashionable right now, which I think is great.\" Some of the synthesizer sounds were intended to acknowledge the title character's childhood iPod on which he listens to music from the 1990s. In terms of Asian influences on the score, Morris attempted to use several instruments to represent Asian culture, particularly for scenes set in a dojo or featuring Kung Fu, but \"the producers didn’t like it. They thought it was too traditional.\" He ultimately used some Japanese flutes throughout the show, but after they were \"heavily affected\" digitally. Robert Lydecker replaced Morris as composer for the second season.\n\nIn February 2017, Paesano was announced as returning to compose for the miniseries \"The Defenders\".\n\nAt the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con, Loeb announced Sean Callery as the composer for \"Inhumans\".\n\nIn April 2017, Tyler Bates was announced as the composer for \"The Punisher\".\n\nIn May 2017, Siddhartha Khosla was hired to compose the music for \"Runaways\".\n\nMark Isham announced in May 2017 that he would compose the music for \"Cloak & Dagger\".\n\nAfter Marvel Entertainment was bought by the Walt Disney Company and Marvel Studios became its \"own entity\", without other companies working with them as distribution companies, the studio commissioned a new production logo for their films and television series starting with \"Thor: The Dark World\", the first film to feature solely the Marvel logo. Feige explained that \"We didn’t want to re-invent the wheel [from the previous logo], but we wanted it to feel bigger, to feel more substantial, [and] like all great studio logos, you need a fanfare, and we’d never had that before.\" Therefore, Marvel commissioned Brian Tyler, who had just scored \"Iron Man 3\" and \"The Dark World\" for them, to compose a new \"spectacular\" fanfare to accompany the logo.\n\nWhen approaching the fanfare, Tyler looked not just at the films, but \"Marvel as a whole...going all the way back from The Human Torch through\" the comics. Because \"there was very little time for the listener or the viewer to really hone in on what's there musically\", Tyler \"needed something that could be played a little bit more simply as a melody. Then all the orchestration—you know, I wrote these string lines that are actually, have kind of a fantastical, more complex nature to it. That just supports a melody that is more of a whistler.\" Marvel agreed with this approach and worked with Tyler to hone the orchestration; \"as the graphics were being done we really wanted to hit little moments with some sparkly shimmer and get it more specific.\" The main melody remained unchanged from Tyler's initial composition.\n\nIn July 2016, Marvel introduced a new logo focusing on the film studio and featuring imagery from the MCU, rather than Marvel in general and its history in comic books. To accompany the new logo, first seen on \"Doctor Strange\", Michael Giacchino, the composer for \"Doctor Strange\", composed a new Marvel Studios fanfare. For \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\", the fanfare introduced with \"Doctor Strange\" was replaced by \"Theme from Spider-Man (Original Television Series)\", Giacchino's version of the theme from the 1967 cartoon series.\n\nTyler composed for Marvel Studios once again in March 2014, by providing the music for the television special \"\".\n\nIn February 2016, a commercial for Coca-Cola mini cans starring Ant-Man and the Hulk aired during Super Bowl 50. It was created through a partnership with Marvel, and directed by the Russo brothers. The ad was scored by \"Ant-Man\" composer Christophe Beck and Jeff Morrow, who had contributed additional material to \"Ant-Man\".\n\n\"Iron Man 2\" introduces the 1974 Stark Expo, based on the 1964 New York World's Fair. Richard M. Sherman, who wrote many Disney songs with his brother Robert, wrote the original song \"Make Way For Tomorrow, Today\" to serve as the in-universe theme for the Stark Expo. Sherman described Howard Stark, the character who created the Expo, as \"a cross between Walt Disney and Howard Hughes\", noting that Disney was himself involved in the creation of the 1964 World's Fair. He continued, \"The filmmakers wanted a Disney-esque song to be the theme song of the Stark Expo,\" admitting that the song was inspired by his own \"There's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow\", which was written for the Carousel of Progress attraction that Disney created for the World's Fair. \"Make Way For Tomorrow, Today\" is heard again in \"Captain America: The First Avenger\", when an earlier version of the Stark Expo appears, with Sherman noting of the reprisal, \"different style, same song\".\n\n\"Captain America: The First Avenger\" features a montage of the titular character and a chorus line touring the U.S., performing a song-and-dance number to the patriotic song \"Star Spangled Man\". The song was written for the film by Alan Menken and lyricist David Zippel, and recorded by the Metro Voices. Menken had wanted to provide the score for the film as well, but was unable to due to scheduling conflicts, so they wrote the song before the film began principal photography (a process Menken would use on an animated film), and hoped that it would mesh with Alan Silvestri's score. Menken said the song \"screamed out for Irving Berlin, in the sense of \"This Is The Army, Mr. Jones\" or \"God Bless America\". It should be patriotic and it should be fun. The goal was to come up with orchestration that felt authentic to the ‘40s, USO [experience].\" Christopher Lennertz conducted a new arrangement of the song for the first season of \"Agent Carter\", where it is used as the theme music of a 1940s Captain America radio drama.\n\nFor \"All Hail the King\", Drew Pearce created a fictional CBS 1980s television pilot titled \"Caged Heat\" (starring Ben Kingsley's Trevor Slattery character), and Feige encouraged him \"to go off. The whole purpose of Trevor is to go off the rails.\" Feige and Marvel subsequently suggested that Pearce create a full title sequence for the pilot. Feige's love of film soundtracks \"started when I had a little tape recorder and I would tape the themes to \"Simon and Simon\" and \"The A-Team\" and play it back, and those were all Mike Post\", so Pearce contacted Post about using one of his old themes for the sequence. Because Post had sold the rights to all of the themes he had written, and felt that none of them fit the \"Russian \"Magnum P.I.\"\" tone that Pearce was aiming for anyway, he offered to write a new theme specifically for the project. Post recorded the theme music on the same equipment he used for his iconic 1980s series' themes.\n\nThe \"Agent Carter\" episode \"A Little Song and Dance\" begins with a dream sequence that begins in black and white, before transitioning to color in \"true \"Wizard of Oz\" fashion\" for a Broadway-style dance number featuring an original song from composer Christopher Lennertz and lyricist David Zippel, in conjunction with series executive producers Tara Butters and Michele Fazekas. Titled \"Watcha Gonna Do (It's Up to You)\", the song was performed by actors Enver Gjokaj and Hayley Atwell. On working with Zippel, Lennertz said, \"It was such a thrill to collaborate on a song with David. His musical style blended well with the jazzy musical tone we were going for, especially on this episode.\"\n\nThe first season of \"Luke Cage\" sees Method Man make a guest appearance in the episode \"Soliloquy of Chaos\", in which he witnesses the heroics of the title character. The artist then goes on to make an original rap song in the episode titled \"Bulletproof Love\", which he performs himself. The actual track was arranged by the series' composers, Adrian Younge and Ali Shaheed Muhammad, for Method Man, and includes much of the socio-political commentary that showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker wished to convey throughout the series. It is accompanied in the episode by a montage of \"black men walking the streets in Cage’s signature 'bulletproof' hoodie\".\n\n\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" features an original song in the film's credits. Co-written by the film's writer and director James Gunn and score composer Tyler Bates, it was \"meant as a sort of \"Guardians\" take on Meco's disco \"Star Wars\" theme [\"Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band\"].\" David Hasselhoff was chosen as the vocalist because he is one of Peter Quill's childhood heroes, and Gunn was a fan of Hasselhoff when he starred on \"Knight Rider\".\n\nIn a flashback during the second season of \"Jessica Jones\", former child star Trish Walker is shown to have had a brief pop-star career, during which she released a song titled \"I Want Your Cray Cray\". Performed by Rachael Taylor, who portrays Walker in the series, and Kandi Marks, the song was described as \"sufficiently addictive\" by Taylor, who noted that the sequence was explaining why Walker is \"going in a number of different directions ... She's been made to feel in her life that she was not respected. She was [a drug] addict. It emotionally explains a lot about what season two is\".\n\n<onlyinclude>===Film soundtracks===\n</onlyinclude>\n\n\n\n\"AC/DC: Iron Man 2\" debuted on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart at number four. On February 14, 2012, the album was certified Gold by the RIAA, for selling over 500,000 copies. In August 2014, \"Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Vol. 1\" had reached the top of the \"Billboard\" 200 chart in its second week of release, becoming the first soundtrack album in history consisting entirely of previously released songs to top the chart. Eight weeks after its release in September 2014, \"Awesome Mix Vol. 1\" was certified Gold by the RIAA, and in January 2015, it was certified Platinum for selling over 1 million copies. \"Awesome Mix Vol. 1\" also peaked at number one on the \"Billboard\" Top Soundtracks, \"Billboard\" Top Rock Albums, and \"Billboard\" Top Digital Albums charts.\n\nIn October 2014, John Coggin looked back on the music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far for \"International Policy Digest\". He felt that the music was a major failing of the shared universe, especially in comparison to other major franchises such as \"Star Wars\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\", because of a lack of \"strong fanfares\" for the films' heroes and a lack of continuity between the different scores. He felt that Patrick Doyle's \"Thor\" was the best in terms of \"thematic strength and unity\", while other films did not develop their own musical themes in a memorable way, and found it \"remarkable\" that Brian Tyler completely discarded all of Doyle's themes. Coggin ended his piece by noting that the MCU was \"still young\", and \"in time, Marvel can and should develop bolder themes for its individual heroes. It should establish some thematic continuity between films.\" Emily Asher-Perrin, writing for \"Tor.com\", discussed the issue of musical continuity further. She pointed out how continuity between films was such an important aspect of the MCU for Marvel, and therefore found it confusing that the \"same consistency wasn’t applied to their soundtracks\". Raising numerous examples of other franchises recalling thematic material to great effect, Asher-Perrin opined that the lack of continuity in the scores was not only \"off-putting\", but a missed opportunity for Marvel and the cohesiveness of the franchise.\nChristian Clemmenson of Filmtracks.com agreed that the scores for the Marvel films \"always struggled to form any kind of cohesive identity\". He felt that Silvestri had been the most successful composer at creating memorable themes, and saw Tyler's work for \"Iron Man 3\" and \"Thor: The Dark World\" as strong in establishing an appropriate tone for the franchise by \"combining the masculinity of the Hans Zimmer blockbuster expectations from the studio with the Jerry Goldsmith rhythmic flair that actually (still) works\". Clemmenson did criticize Tyler's work on \"The Dark World\" for his \"inexplicable\" replacing of Doyle's themes with his own \"generic\" ones, and subsequently praised the composer's efforts on \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" to maintain the sound that he previously established while reusing Silvestri's previous themes as well as his own. He also highlighted the way that Danny Elfman adapted and evolved Silvestri's Avengers theme for that film, \"rather than simply arranging it for regurgitation\". Despite this praise, Clemmenson ultimately only called the \"Age of Ultron\" score \"functional\", and felt that the way the music was edited and used in the film was \"an absolute mess\", an issue he saw with many of the MCU scores.\n\nAt Flickering Myth, Simon Columb responded to a description of Tyler's scores for \"Iron Man 3\" and \"Thor: The Dark World\" as \"alright\" with an opinion piece titled \"The Forgettable Soundtrack to Marvel’s Movies\". He argued that film music is such a \"core element\" that the scores deserve more criticism than a dismissive \"alright\"; he felt that all MCU scores were \"consistently below par ... the soundtracks have always felt unclear, confused and inconsistent.\" He also touched on the lack of continuity, lamenting the missed opportunity to \"use the themes and music to carve out a consistent harmonic atmosphere\". /Film's Jacob Hall focused on the quality of the MCU's music, describing it as \"the musical equivalent of vanilla pudding. No single MCU movie features identifiable music and that’s a shame.\" Hall hoped that the hiring of Michael Giacchino, whom he called \"one of the most talented and celebrated modern composers of music for film and television\", and the rehiring of Silvestri, who he felt had composed the only memorable and recognizable theme with his \"Captain America March\", during Marvel's Phase Three slate of films would change this trend, particularly hoping that Giacchino could \"bring some much-needed magic to the MCU\".\n\nIn September 2016, the YouTube channel Every Frame a Painting, which analyzes films and the filmmaking process, posted a video essay discussing the music of the MCU. The video also highlights the lack of memorability for general audience members compared to franchises such as \"Star Wars\" and \"James Bond\", and proposes several reasons for why this is: the tendency for the music to be background noise, or to be \"hidden\" behind other sounds such as voiceovers; how it closely reflects the events on screen, and so does not stand out or surprise the audience; and how it is often similar to other music, which the video blames on the temp process and filmmakers editing the film to the temp music before bringing in the composer, or asking composers to imitate the temp tracks. Saying that the music is not bad, just \"bland and inoffensive\", the video states that Marvel could improve their music by simply taking more risks with it, like putting more emphasis on the music without any other sound effects, or mismatching it with the visuals—for example, playing \"emotional\" music during an otherwise \"humorous\" scene to give more impact to the underlying feelings of the characters rather than their surface actions.\n"}

People's Artist of the USSR (1969).\n\nPopov was born on 31 July 1930, the son of a clock-repairman. At age 12, he began working as an apprentice typographer for the newspaper \"Pravda\", and he later joined \"Pravda\"'s Athletic Club. There, in 1945, someone suggested that he apply for Moscow's State College of Circus and Variety Arts (better known as the \"Moscow Circus School\"). He was accepted and studied acrobatics, juggling, and other circus skills there, graduating in 1949. He made his debut at the Tbilisi Circus in the Georgian SSR. Afterwards, he continued his career at the Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard (today Circus Nikulin).\n\nIn 1955, Popov performed abroad for the first time, in Warsaw, and the following year, he toured with the Moscow Circus in France, Belgium, and England, and was immediately noticed by the press, which made him a circus star. The Soviet regime quickly built on his success abroad and transformed him into a goodwill ambassador for the Soviet Union. He appeared in 1958 at the Brussels World Fair, and in 1957, he was broadcast from Moscow on American television. He toured the United States in 1963 and 1972 with the Moscow Circus. In 1969, Popov was honored with the title of People's Artist of the USSR. He toured extensively around the world in subsequent years with the Moscow Circus. In Australia, he was named \"King of Moomba\" (1971).\n\nPopov performed as a clown, combining his talents as a mime, a tightrope walker, and a juggler. At the 8th International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo in 1981, he received the coveted Gold Clown award as a tribute to his stellar career. His clown character followed the tradition of the Russian folk character \"Ivanushka,\" who fools other people and who is teased himself.\n\nIn the early 1990s, at the fall of the Soviet Union, he began touring for a few years with a unit of the Moscow Circus in Germany, where he eventually resettled. He later performed extensively in Germany, in circus shows, on television, or with his own touring show. He married Gabriela Lehmann, a German circus performer, in 1991, she is 32 years younger than her husband. In 2006, Popov was invited to perform at the 30th anniversary of the International Circus Festival of Monte Carlo. Aged 75 years of age, he received a standing ovation.\n\nIn 2015, he returned for the first time to Russia after 28 years of living in Germany; it was at the First \"Master\" gala event (the Russian circus equivalent of the Oscars ceremony) at the State Circus of Sochi, where he was greeted with a long standing ovation. The Russian Minister of Culture, Vladimir Medinsky read a welcoming message from President Vladimir Putin. In December 2015 he was back to Russia again – now to become one of the judges at the final show of “The Blue Bird” contest – a young talent competition on Russia 1 TV channel. He also teamed up with Artem Shilo – a young pianist and one of the contestants – to support him in the competition.\n\nPopov appeared in four films, \"Арена Смелых\" (\"Ring of Daring\", 1953), \"Ma-ma\" (1977), \"The Blue Bird\" (1976) and \"Ritzar bez bronya\" (Poland, 1966). He published a book of memoirs in 1967, which has been widely translated into numerous languages including English (as \"Russian Clown\", 1970). From a first marriage with a violinist, Alexandra, Oleg Popov had a daughter, Olga (b. 1953).\n\nPopov died on 2 November 2016, from a cardiac arrest while on tour, at a hotel in Rostov-on-Don at the age of 86.\n\n\n"}

The riff is sometimes accompanied by the sound of a gong.\n\nThe Oriental riff is a Western invention, dating back to the \"Aladdin Quick Step\" used in an \"Aladdin\" stage show, \"The Grand Chinese Spectacle of Aladdin or The Wonderful Lamp\", in 1847. The notes used in the riff are part of a pentatonic scale and often harmonized with parallel open fourths, which makes the riff sound like East Asian music to a typical Western listener.\n\nThe Oriental riff and interpretations of the Oriental riff have been included as part of numerous musical works in Western music. Examples of its use include \"Kung Fu Fighting\" by Carl Douglas and Biddu (1974), The Vapors' \"Turning Japanese\", and Rush's \"A Passage to Bangkok\". The Oriental riff has also been adapted for use as video game \"Yie Ar Kung-Fu\"s main theme, the Chai Kingdom theme in \"Super Mario Land\" and the fighting theme of the Kung-Fu chapter in \"Live A Live\".\n\nThe riff was also used in an Eastern series, the Japanese anime \"The Super Dimension Fortress Macross\".

Every combination of strategies (one for each player) is an outcome of the game. A primary purpose of game theory is to determine which outcomes are stable according to a solution concept (e.g. Nash equilibria).\n\nIn a game where chance or a random event is involved, the outcome is not known from only the set of strategies, but is only realized when the random event(s) are realized.\n\nA set of payoffs can be considered a set of N-tuples, where \"N\" is the number of players in the game, and the cardinality of the set is equal to the total number of possible outcomes when the strategies of the players are varied. The payoff set can thus be partially ordered, where the partial ordering comes from the value of each entry in the N-tuple. How players interact to allocate the payoffs among themselves is a fundamental aspect of economics.\n\nMany different concepts exist to express how players might interact. An optimal interaction may be one in which no player's payoff can be made greater, without making any other player's payoff lesser. Such a payoff is described as Pareto efficient, and the set of such payoffs is called the Pareto frontier.\n\nMany economists study the ways in which payoffs are in some sort of economic equilibrium. One example of such an equilibrium is the Nash equilibrium, where each player plays a strategy such that their payoff is maximized given the strategy of the other players.\n\nEquilibria are not always Pareto efficient, and a number of game theorists design ways to enforce Pareto efficient play, or play that satisfies some other sort of social optimality. The theory of this is called implementation theory. Other economists seek to design games based on a certain set of outcomes, an effort which goes under the name of mechanism design.\n"}
{"id": "21212510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21212510", "title": "Quinze", "text": "Quinze\n\nQuinze, \"Quince\", also known as Ace-low, is a 17th-century French card game of Spanish origin that was much patronized in some parts of Europe. It is considered a forerunner of the French Vingt-et-un, a game very popular at the court of Louis XV, and also a two-player simplification of the modern game of Blackjack.\n\nQuinze is generally admired for its simplicity and fairness, depending entirely upon chance, and not requiring the attention of most other games on the cards, and therefore calculated for those who love to sport upon an equal hazard. It is a card game of chance in which players compete with each other to acquire a hand of 15 points or as close to 15 as possible, hence the game is also known as Fifteen. It is usually played by two persons only, with a full pack of 52 cards.\n\nThe cards are shuffled by both players and when they have it cut for deal, which falls to the lot of that who cuts the lowest card, being Ace low and King high, the dealer is then free to shuffle them again. When this is done, the adversary cuts them, after which the dealer gives one card to his opponent and one to himself.\n\nShould the dealer's adversary not approve of his card, he is entitled to have as many cards given to him, one after the other, as will make fifteen, or come nearest to that number, which are usually given from the top of the pack. That is, if the player is dealt a Two and then a Five, which amounts to seven, he must continue going on in expectation of coming nearer to fifteen. If he is dealt an Eight, which will make just fifteen, he, as having the best hand, is sure of winning the game. But if he is overdealt and makes more than fifteen, he loses, unless the dealer should do the same, in which case it is a drawn game, and the players double their stakes thus going on until one of them has won the game by being exactly fifteen or by standing as closest to this.\n\nAt the conclusion of each game, the cards are put up and shuffled and the players cut again for deal, and the elder then taken on the advantage of dealing the cards.\n\n\n"}

The series, centred on the sport of robot combat, involves teams of amateur and professional roboteers operating their own constructed remote controlled robots to fight against each other, whilst also avoiding arena hazards and more powerful \"House Robots\", which were not bound by the same weight or weapon limits as the contestants. Earlier series included assault and trial courses for competing robots before they were ceased from the first \"Extreme\" series onwards.\n\nThe show was first broadcast on BBC Two from 20 February 1998 to 23 February 2001, on BBC Choice from 8 October 2001 to 7 February 2003 (later repeated on BBC Two), on Channel 5 from 2 November 2003 to 28 March 2004 before being revived in 2016 and broadcast on BBC Two from 24 July 2016 to 7 January 2018. To date, the show has been broadcast as 10 main series each centred around a single competition, two \"Extreme\" series with several unconnected events and several special episodes.\n\nJeremy Clarkson presented the first series, with \"Master of Mayhem\" Craig Charles taking over for the second to seventh series. Philippa Forrester co-hosted the first three series, the fifth and Extreme 2. Forrester also hosted the spin-off series \"Robot Wars Revealed\" from 1998 to 1999. The fourth series and Extreme 1 were co-hosted by Julia Reed and the seventh by Jayne Middlemiss. Jonathan Pearce provided commentary for all series. The revived series were hosted by Dara Ó Briain and Angela Scanlon.\n\nAdditional series were filmed at the UK venue for specific sectors of the global market, including two series of \"Robot Wars Extreme Warriors\" with American competitors for the TNN network (hosted by Mick Foley with Rebecca Grant serving as pit reporter), two of \"Dutch Robot Wars\" for distribution in the Netherlands and a single series for Germany. The fourth series of the UK \"Robot Wars\" was shown in the US on TNN as \"Robot Wars: Grand Champions\" in 2002 and hosted by Joanie Laurer.\n\nIts merchandising was commercially successful, being one of the most popular selling toy ranges in 2002. It included a mini arena, pullback, friction and ripcord toys and radio-controlled versions of the House Robots.\n\nIn 2003, the roboteers themselves formed \"The Fighting Robot Association\" and with their associated event organizers, carry on participating in competitions for new audiences. In 2013, Roaming Robots purchased the rights to the \"Robot Wars\" brand from Robot Wars LLC and operated their travelling robotic combat show under that name. The use of the name \"Robot Wars\" for live shows ceased in early 2017, being renamed \"Extreme Robots\".\n\nWith a peak audience of six million viewers in the UK during the late 1990s, the format went on to become a worldwide success, showing in 45 countries including the US, Australia, Canada, China, India, Germany and Italy. In March 2003, it was dropped by BBC Two after eight series and Mentorn announced it was making 22 episodes for Channel 5, concluding with The Third World Championships broadcast in March 2004. Channel 5 later axed the show after one series due to low ratings.\n\nIn July 2016, the show returned to BBC Two with a new arena, house robots and presenters. The first episode was well received becoming the top trending topic on Twitter that evening and having two million viewers, more than the last episode of the 23rd series of \"Top Gear\" in the same 8pm Sunday slot just a few weeks earlier. The revived show ran for three series, before it ended in March 2018.\n\n\"Robot Wars\" was the brainchild of Marc Thorpe, a designer working for the LucasToys division of Lucasfilm. In 1992, Thorpe had the initial idea for robot combat sport after unsuccessfully attempting to create a radio-controlled vacuum cleaner. In 1994, Marc Thorpe created \"Robot Wars\" and held the first competition at the Fort Mason Center in San Francisco. Approximately one month prior to the event, Thorpe formed a partnership with New York-based record company Sm:)e Communications, later Profile Records, who provided additional funding.\n\nBetween 1995 and 1997, three further \"Robot Wars\" events took place in America and in 1995, Profile Records partnered with production company Mentorn to produce and televise a \"Robot Wars\" event in the UK. Mentorn acquired the worldwide television rights from Profile in 1995 after Tom Gutteridge (the head of Mentorn) had seen an amateur tape of a San Francisco event.\n\nGutteridge and one of his producers Steve Carsey created a television format based on the \"Robot Wars\" concept. They produced a live event opposite BBC Television Centre in Wood Lane, Shepherd's Bush, London and hired Derek Foxwell to build 3 combat robots, 2 of which were named The Mouse and Grunt who would eventually take part in the first UK series of \"Robot Wars\", to take on three American robots, Thor, La Machine and The Master, all of which were veterans of the original American competition. The Controller of BBC Two, Michael Jackson, attended the event, which was not filmed and he promised to commission a series. However, it was not until 1998 that a subsequent Controller of BBC Two, Mark Thompson, fulfilled Jackson's promise and actually commissioned 6 episodes. Gutteridge and Carsey were producers and Foxwell was the technical supervisor and senior technical consultant. He drafted the rules and regulations and was in charge of the pit area and the technical team, which scrutinised the robots, got them on and off stage and helped the contestants prepare and repair their robots. Mat Irvine, initially a member of the technical team, served as a member of the judging panel in 2002 and 2003.\n\nThe three person judging panel consisted of Noel Sharkey (head judge on every series: 1998–2003, 2016–), Eric Dickinson (1998), Adam Harper (1998–99), Martin Smith (1999–2003), Myra Wilson (2000–01), Mat Irvine (2001–03), Sethu Vijayakumar (2016–) and Lucy Rogers (2016–).\n\nProfile sought no input or consent from Thorpe before doing this and this aggravated the already troubled relationship between Thorpe and Profile Records and indirectly spurred legal disagreements surrounding the ownership of the \"Robot Wars\" concept. The legal proceedings surrounding these would last until 6 February 2002. Mentorn used Thorpe as a Consultant on the series, however and the initial series of \"Robot Wars\" in the UK was broadcast over six weeks in February and March 1998. It was an immediate hit, with more than two million viewers and a further 18 episodes were commissioned by the BBC that year. 155 episodes were produced in total and the show was seen in 26 countries. Two series were produced in the US for The National Network (now Paramount Network) and a version was also shown on Nickelodeon. Series were also produced in many European countries. Although the series had various directors and producers, all were produced in the UK by Mentorn and executive produced by Tom Gutteridge and Steve Carsey. The initial series were staged in various film studios around London but the stage and pit area became too large to fit into any of the conventional studios, so filming was later moved to an aircraft hangar at RAF Newton.\n\nViewing figures dropped significantly in the early 2000s, reaching only 1.2 million in the sixth series - the final to be broadcast on BBC Two. Following its move to Channel 5 in November 2003, the show first began airing in a new Sunday night slot and launched with one million viewers; however ratings fell quickly to 800,000 resulting in the show moving to Saturday nights after just three episodes.\n\nOn 13 January 2016, the BBC confirmed that it would be rebooting the show for a six-part series. The revived series was hosted by Dara Ó Briain and Angela Scanlon with Jonathan Pearce returning as commentator. The first episode was broadcast on 24 July at 8pm, the same slot as \"Top Gear\". Some robots from the original series returned, including Behemoth and Storm II, as well as four of the original House Robots, which were upgraded to be heavier, faster, better armed and with new looks. The 2016 series was filmed in a warehouse at Westway Park in Renfrew, Scotland.\n\nThe first episode received about two million viewers and was the top trending topic on Twitter with over 20,000 tweets.\n\nA second rebooted series was commissioned with a first celebrity special in 16 years, in which celebrities, such as Olympians Kadeena Cox and Alistair Brownlee and Jonny Brownlee, TV presenters Suzi Perry, Neil Oliver and Maggie Aderin-Pocock, singer Jordan Stevens and radio presenters Scott Mills and Robbie Savage had bespoke robots designed for them by eight major roboteers, who mentored them during the specials.\n\nDuring its original airing, the first rebooted series was sometimes referred to as 'Series 1', presenting itself as a completely new show. Starting in 2017, however, the BBC began referring to it as Series 8, with the following second series appropriately dubbed Series 9, acknowledging itself as a continuation of the original show.\n\nA robot could lose a match in several ways during the knockout format of the show:\n\nAlthough the format changed several times over the years, these rules remained the same across all series and competitions.\n\nThere were also two series made for the UK, \"Robot Wars Extreme\", which did not focus on a single championship.\n\nThe first series of \"Robot Wars\" was presented by Jeremy Clarkson and co-hosted by Philippa Forrester. In keeping with his edgy persona established on \"Top Gear\", Clarkson frequently made tongue-in-cheek jokes about competitors and their robots, such as remarking that a contestant robot called \"Skarab\" looked like \"cheese on toast\".\n\nClarkson left \"Robot Wars\" after the first series and was replaced with Craig Charles. Charles, well known as playing the character Dave Lister in the science fiction-themed sitcom \"Red Dwarf\", was seen as taking the programme and its contestants more seriously than Clarkson and was more enthusiastic while presenting it. Charles would close each episode with a four line poem ending with the words \"Robot Wars\". Charles presented \"Robot Wars\" until it ceased production in 2004.\n\nIn comparison to Charles' background in science fiction, Philippa Forrester was best known as co-host of the science and technology programme \"Tomorrow's World\". Her role on \"Robot Wars\" was as the pit reporter who would speak to contestants about their robots before and after battles. Forrester was pit reporter for six of the show's nine series; Julia Reed took the role for Series 4 and Extreme 1 since Forrester was unable to participate in the programme due to pregnancy, but Forrester returned for Series 5, Series 6 and Extreme 2. When the programme moved to Channel 5 for the seventh series, Forrester did not return for unknown reasons, so Jayne Middlemiss took over the pit reporter duties.\n\nJonathan Pearce was the show's commentator throughout its entire run. He commentated in the same loud and enthusiastic manner as his football commentaries. The programme was well known for phrases such as \"Roboteers, stand by\", \"3. 2. 1. Activate\" and \"Cease!\". These phrases were announced by the director, Stuart McDonald and became a recognisable part of the series for the entire duration of its run.\n\nIn 2016, Dara Ó Briain and Angela Scanlon were announced as the hosts of the eighth series, with Jonathan Pearce returning as commentator. They reprised their roles in the ninth and tenth series.\n\nThroughout the series, house robots acted as obstacles to competing robots in battles and challenges. House robots were permitted to attack robots that were in the Corner Patrol Zones at the corners of the arena or upon the submission of a competing robot. The house robots were an intrinsic part of the programme's success and merchandising of these robots was highly successful. Furthermore, the house robots were not subject to the weight limit or weapon rules that contestant robots had to adhere to, the most notable example of this was Sergeant Bash's flamethrower.\n\nFrom the Fourth Wars, a non-competitive \"Refbot\" was present during fights. This robot conveyed officiating signals (such as counting out immobile competitors) on the arena, gave occasional nudges to help battles along and could deploy a fire extinguisher where necessary.\n\nFor Series 8, new versions of Matilda, Shunt, Dead Metal and Sir Killalot were constructed. They are considerably heavier with improved weaponry. All the house robots are over in weight and Sir Killalot now weighs . Visually, all four look similar to their predecessors, but with significant differences: Dead Metal's head has been enlarged with glowing eyes, Matilda's back-mounted fins have been replaced with smaller crocodilian scales, spikes appear on her frill, her eyes are now red and her whole head section now flips up; Shunt has enlarged wheel protectors and metal chimneys replacing the smokestack; and Sir Killalot's armour and helmet has been entirely redesigned. This was said to be to show the actual shape of Sir Killalot's head, rather than the helmet he is wearing. The other house robots did not return for this series.\n\nBold text indicates house robots that returned for the new series.\n\nThere were numerous arena incarnations used during the original run of \"Robot Wars\" on the BBC. These arenas were also used by international versions such as \"Robot Wars: Extreme Warriors\" in the United States. The arena was approximately . For Series 1 to 3 the arena was not enclosed as such, as the audience were raised above the arena. The increasing sophistication of weaponry from contestant robots - most notably demonstrated by Hypno-Disc in Series 3 - as well as arena hazards prompted producers to enclose the arena entirely in a perspex box high from Series 4 onwards, to protect the audience and production team from debris.\n\nIn early 2004, the Robot Wars arena was purchased from the television production firm Mentorn by a company called Robot Arenas Ltd., based in the UK, an organization set up by a past competitor in Robot Wars to continue the sport of robot combat in the UK. The arena - valued originally at £11,000 - was sold for scrap in 2005 for £250 by the new owners of the former RAF Newton air base, where the arena was housed. A suit filed against RAF Newton by Robot Arenas Ltd. found that RAF Newton had acted reasonably in the matter and owed no compensation to Robot Arenas Ltd.\n\nIn 2016, a new arena was constructed in a warehouse in Renfrew, on the outskirts of Glasgow, for use in the rebooted series. This arena is square, with a steel floor and higher bulletproof walls, making it harder for robots to be thrown out of the arena.\n\nThroughout Robot Wars' run, arena hazards were introduced and amended. Generally, hazards which proved ineffective were omitted in later series, however some hazards proved to be a success (such as the Pit of Oblivion, Floor Flipper and the Drop Zone) and were retained. The assorted hazards in the arena that changed from one series the next included:\n\n\n\nPullback and friction toys were made of all the House Robots, with the exception of Cassius Chrome as the toys had stopped production when it was introduced for The Seventh Wars and the toys would have resumed production by Series 10 but this did not happen until Hexbug did so rather late in 2018. There were also pullback and ripcord toys of Chaos 2, Dantomkia, Firestorm, Hypno-Disc, Panic Attack, Pussycat, Razer, Stinger, Tornado, Wheely Big Cheese and X-Terminator 2. Each came with an accessory.\n\nThere were remote controlled versions of Shunt, Matilda, Sir Killalot and Growler. There were also smaller remote control battlers, which had \"immobilisation spots\" on the rear of the toy. Sgt. Bash and the competitor robot Tornado were the only two made. These were smaller than the other remote control robots mentioned above.\n\nThere were customisable kit toys of the House Robot Matilda and competitors Hypno-Disc and Panic Attack. A Sergeant Bash pitstop kit was prototyped but never released.\n\nMinibots were a series of small die-cast replica robots. The range included all of the Series 5 House Robots along with competitor robots Chaos 2, Dominator 2, Firestorm III, Gemini, Hypno-Disc, Mega Morg, Panic Attack, Plunderbird 5, Pussycat, Razer, Suicidal Tendencies, Tornado, Wheely Big Cheese, Wild Thing and X-Terminator 2. They had an interactive replica arena and two additional playsets.\n\nSeveral VHS videos were released of the show. These included \"The First Great War\" a look at the making of Series 1, \"The First World Championship\" which was released exclusively on video at the time and the \"Ultimate Warrior Collection\" featuring exclusive access to the teams of Chaos 2, Hypno-Disc and Razer, along with footage of their battles. Along the same lines an \"Ultimate Archive Collection\" was released showing exclusive footage of the House Robots and their operators along with some of their greatest battles and most embarrassing moments.\n\nThe Ultimate Warrior Collection, Ultimate Archive Collection and First Great War were also released on DVD. The footage and content remained the same as the VHS releases. Series 8 was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 29 August 2016, making it the first full series of \"Robot Wars\" to be released on home media. It was later released digitally.

Critics praised the game's authentic recreation of the look and feel of the TV series, but often criticized its gameplay as repetitive and clunky.\n\nIn the game, the player controls a member of the Deep Space Nine's crew, mostly captain Benjamin Sisko, also doctor Julian Bashir, major Kira Nerys and Odo. Most of the game's levels are cinematic platformers, one is a horizontal-scrolling shooter. Platformer levels are of two types: 'adventure' levels and 'action' levels. In 'adventure' levels, the player character moves around the Deep Space Nine, talking with NPCs and ultimately reaching a certain point in the plot. In 'action' levels, the player wanders the level in the cinematic platformer style, climbing ledges, fighting enemies with a phaser, finding and using items, with an ultimate goal to fulfill a certain mission, sometimes within a given time limit.\n\nReviewing the Genesis version, \"GamePro\" summarized \"Despite DS9's remarkable graphics and authentic Trekkie atmosphere, its simple, repetitive action will attract only puzzle fiends and devotees of the TV show.\" They elaborated that the puzzles are time-consuming, every conflict can be won just by crouching and shooting, and that players must view the same conversations every time their character dies. A different \"GamePro\" critic reviewed the SNES version. He criticized that the controls are clunky and that the levels are repetitive and similar-looking to each other, but also remarked that the authentic Deep Space Nine look and spirit would make the game enjoyable for fans of the show. A reviewer for \"Next Generation\" complimented the game's story and faithfulness to the source material, but concluded that the slow pace, unclear objectives, and muddy graphics make it \"Recommended only for undiscriminating fans.\" The four reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave the game a positive review. Two of them criticized that the pace is too slow, but all four praised the backgrounds and character sprites as reproducing the look of the TV show with great attention to detail, and they emphasized that fans of the show should try the game. Though they remarked that the graphics are not as good in the Genesis version, all four reviewers gave the two versions identical scores.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the Genesis version of the game, and stated that \"This game is boring and will only be of minor interest to \"Deep Space Nine\" freaks.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "25496814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25496814", "title": "Super Saturday", "text": "Super Saturday\n\nSuper Saturday or Panic Saturday is the last Saturday before Christmas Eve or Christmas in Poland, a major day of revenue for American retailers, marking the end of the shopping season they and many customers believe begins on Black Friday. Super Saturday targets last-minute shoppers. Typically the day is ridden with one-day sales in an effort to accrue more revenue than any other day in the Christmas and holiday season. The date in Poland is always the second to last Saturday in December and is slightly more likely to fall on December 22, December 19, December 17, or December 24 (in Poland) (58 in 400 years each), than on December 21 or December 20 (57), and slightly less likely to occur on December 23 or December 18 (56).\n\nSuper Saturday typically nets approximately $15 billion in retail sales. To compete with each other, stores offer significant discounts and extend store hours in an attempt to attract customers and drive impulse buying.\n\nSuper Saturday accounts for a significant portion of the holiday sales for retail stores. In 2006, a study determined that sales between December 21 and 24 accounted for 13.6 percent of holiday sales. (In 2006, Super Saturday fell on December 23.) Some businesses do as much as 60 percent of their sales on this day.\n\nIn an effort to attract customers, stores often extend their hours during these crucial days of the retail season. Some stores go as far as to leave their stores open all day long until Christmas Eve in hopes that customers will take the extra time during off-peak hours to both review alternative options and to spread out workloads for cashiers. Because stores predict double or triple their typical customer turnout on Super Saturday, many increase their staffing during these critical days to be able to handle the demand.\n\nThe day typically nets a significant amount of revenue for retailers because of the demand by shoppers. 2009 reports indicated that by the middle of December, more than half of all shoppers in the United States still had more holiday shopping to do. Some experts predicted that approximately 40% of consumers hadn't started their holiday shopping by Super Saturday in 2009, with some customers citing full-time jobs as impeding their access to stores earlier in the year. Cathy Bergh from The Christmas House notes that the day is significant because it is \"the last chance [for shoppers] to get out and do their shopping.\"\n\nSome shoppers, however, intentionally wait for Super Saturday to finish their shopping due to the availability of discounts. Alternative reasons for waiting until the final Saturday to make holiday purchases include ensuring that purchases are within budget. Other customers choose to do their shopping early in an attempt to avoid the long lines and large crowds associated with the retail holiday.\n\nUnlike Black Friday, online shopping does not typically infringe upon retail stores' access to customers. Due to Super Saturday's proximity to Christmas, shoppers are typically reluctant to venture online for deals, as purchases may not be able to arrive in time for the holiday. However, this is not always the case. If customers are unable to gain access to the stores, like what happened during the North American blizzard of 2009, customers who have little time left to buy their gifts may be forced online.\n\nSuper Saturday can also be used for any Saturday where a large number of related events are held. In the context of the Eurovision Song Contest for example, the Saturday on which most broadcasters organize their national final is often declared as Super Saturday.\n\nThe final Saturday of the US Open in tennis is called \"Super Saturday\". If the tournament is running to schedule and has not been delayed by inclement weather or similar, both the men's semi-finals and the women's final are played on this day, with the men's semi-finals in the afternoon, then the women's final at night.\n\nThe phrase was also used (mainly by the British media) to refer to the middle Saturday of the 2012 Summer Olympics (4 August) where Team GB athletes Jessica Ennis, Mo Farah, Greg Rutherford, Danielle King, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell, Tom James, Pete Reed, Andrew Triggs Hodge, Alex Gregory, Katherine Copeland and Sophie Hosking all won gold medals.\n\n"}

The label's most successful act was the rock band Deep Purple.\n\nTetragrammaton was also responsible for releasing the controversial 1968 Apple Records album, \"\" in the United States. This avant-garde album was recorded by John Lennon and Yoko Ono and featured nude photos of the pair on the front and back cover. Tetragrammaton stepped in as distributor after Capitol Records, the usual US distributor for Apple and the Beatles, refused the album, citing a possible negative response from retailers. \n\nThe Lennon/Ono album was also declared to be pornography by some authorities. Tetragrammaton quickly fell into financial difficulties related in part to their distribution of this album. Approximately 30,000 copies of the record were seized by police at a warehouse in New Jersey. The records were held as evidence in a court case, which made it impossible for the label to sell them at the time.\n\nBill Cosby's 1969 stand-up comedy album, \"\", was also released by the label, as were two albums by comedian Murray Roman, \"You Can't Beat People Up & Have Them Say I Love You\" and \"A Blind Man's Movie\".\n\nA number of the label's projects were left unissued. Among these were a second album by singer songwriter Elyse Weinberg, and an album by Memphis musician Captain Milk (real name, Edwin Hubbard) who described himself as a \"flute picker\". Tetragrammaton did however release a single of the Lennon/McCartney song \"Hey Jude\" from the Captain Milk recording sessions. An English rock band named Bodast also recorded an unreleased album for Tetragrammaton in 1968. The group featured guitarist Steve Howe, later a member of Yes. The Bodast recordings were first released in 1981 by another label. \n\nDespite having several popular artists on its roster, Tetragrammaton permanently closed its doors after declaring bankruptcy in 1971. In 1972, Deep Purple's new label, Warner Bros. Records (also Cosby's former label), reissued various tracks from the group's first three Tetragrammaton albums on one compilation album entitled \"Purple Passages\". In Canada, some of Tetragrammaton's releases were manufactured and distributed by the Canadian division of Polydor Records, which also issued several Canada-only Deep Purple compilations after Tetragrammaton's demise.\n\nTetragrammaton's co-founder, Marvin Deane, died of heart failure on August 16, 2010, in Los Angeles, California.\n\n\n\n"}

The game performs as the direct sequel to The Bigs. On March 3, 2009, the first trailer for the game was released revealing that players like Ozzie Smith, Wade Boggs, Roberto Clemente, and Reggie Jackson and a number of other Hall of Famers would be playable in the game. On April 7, 2009, the Milwaukee Brewers All-Star first baseman Prince Fielder was announced as the cover athlete chosen by 2K Sports. For the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Wii editions of the game, play-by-play is announced in English by Damon Bruce and in Japanese by Kasey Ryne Mazak. It was released on July 7, 2009.\n\n\"The BIGS 2\" features an over-the-top playing style, like the first game established. Unlike the first game, The BIGS 2 allows players to play through the full 162 game season and will allow the player to act both as general manager and as the players on the field by allowing the player to trade, draft, and manage other front office activities. The game also, includes new game stats called \"Power\", \"Glove\", and \"Contact\". The Bigs 2 does not support the Wii MotionPlus for improving control precision.\n\nAt bat, the game also gives the player a new hitting system that consists of a \"wheelhouse\". Pitches thrown into the wheelhouse can be hit more efficiently by the batter or gain more turbo if taken for a strike. Strikes in the wheelhouse also shrink the radius of the wheelhouse. For some hitters, the circle will be bigger based on stats. For example, Alex Rodriguez possesses very high hitting stats. His wheelhouse radius covers nearly the entire strike zone, excluding the four corners.\n\nThe game also include real-time sequences where the player can quickly tap a button to catch a ball speeding quickly past a fielder's head. Like the original game, each button simply like (X) will stand for a different base. When the button is pressed, the ball would be thrown to the selected base.\n\nThe new \"Big Slam\" mechanic allows the player to bring four consecutive batters up. If the first batter makes contact a single will automatically register. This will continue until the 4th batter is reached. If the first three players reached base by making contact, the 4th batter, upon making contact, will automatically hit a grand slam.\n\nBecome a Legend is a mode where the player creates a character who is recovering from an injury in the Mexican League, is picked up by a Major League team, and then tries to reach \"Legendary Status\".\n\nA demo for the game has been released in the PlayStation Store and Xbox Live Marketplace, but the only playable teams are the NL and AL All Star Teams. The games only last 3 innings. Also, an intro to the mini game \"Home run pinball\" is included.\n\nThe Bigs 2 was released in the UK on 17 July 2009. It was the first baseball game to be released in the UK on Xbox 360. It was released as a budget game with many retailers listing the pre-order for less than £20.00.\n\nThe Bigs 2 was released for the Nintendo DS on September 8, 2009.\n\n\"The Bigs 2\" received mostly favorable reviews. Many reviews cited the fast-paced arcade style gameplay as one of the most addictive part of the game. However, the game was also criticized for the lack of \"fundamental aspects of baseball.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "31560245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31560245", "title": "The Media Equation", "text": "The Media Equation\n\nThe Media Equation is a general communication theory that claims that people tend to treat computers and other media as if they were either real people or real places. The effects of this phenomenon on people experiencing these media are often profound, leading them to behave and to respond to these experiences in unexpected ways, most of which they are completely unaware of.\n\nOriginally based on the research of Clifford Nass and Byron Reeves at Stanford University, the theory explains that people tend to respond to media as they would either to another person (by being polite, cooperative, attributing personality characteristics such as aggressiveness, humor, expertise, and even gender) – or to places and phenomena in the physical world – depending on the cues they receive from the media. Numerous studies that have evolved from the research in psychology, social science and other fields indicate that this type of reaction is automatic, unavoidable, and happens more often than people realize. Reeves and Nass (1996) argue that, “Individuals’ interactions with computers, television, and new media are fundamentally social and natural, just like interactions in real life,” (p. 5).\n\nReeves and Nass established two rules before the test- when a computer asks a user about itself, the user will give more positive responses than when a different computer asks the same questions. They expected people to be less variable with their responses when they took a test and then answered a questionnaire on the same computer. They wanted to see that computers, although not human, can implement social responses. The independent variable was the computer (there are 2 in the test), and the dependent variable was the evaluation responses. The control was a pen-and-paper questionnaire.\n\nThe media equation relies on eight propositions derived from the research:\n\n\nThe assumptions and conclusions of the media equation are based on a rigorous research agenda that relies on objective empirical data using reliable social science research methods. As Reeves and Nass (1996) explain, “Our strategy for learning about media was to go to the social science section of the library, find theories and experiments about human-human interaction – and then borrow…Take out a pen, cross out ‘human’ or ‘environment’ and substitute media. When we did this, all of the predictions and experiments led to the media equation: People’s responses to media are fundamentally social and natural,” (p. 251). \nThe empirical data to support the media equation is thorough and expansive. Studies have tested a wide variety of communication characteristics with the media – manners, personality, emotion, social roles and form. Below are explanations of some of the more interesting findings that support the media equation.\n\nPoliteness is one measure that researchers have used to study human-computer interaction. Being polite is an automatic response in most interpersonal interactions. When a person asks a question about themselves, most people will give a positive response, even if it may be a dishonest answer, to avoid hurting the other person’s feelings. To test this idea with human-computer interaction, researchers designed an experiment in which participants would work with a computer on a tutoring exercise. The computer would provide them with a fact about American culture and then provide supplemental information. The computer then prompted participants to take a test to evaluate what they have learned. After completing the tests participants were asked to evaluate the computer’s performance. The participants were assigned to one of three conditions – a pencil and paper evaluation, an evaluation on a different computer, or an evaluation on the same computer. The results indicate that participants who were asked to evaluate the same computer gave the computer more positive feedback than the other two conditions. To learn more about this experiment, see Nass, Moon, & Carney, 1999.\n\nIn psychology there is a law of hedonic asymmetry that says evaluations of good and bad are important but not the same; negative experiences tend to dominate. In other words, people tend to dwell on the negative more than the positive. Responses to negative situations are automatic and require more attention to process than positive experiences. Allocating more resources to process negative information takes away from resources available to process positive information, thus impeding one’s ability to remember events preceding the negative event. The media equation suggests that people have a similar experience when they encounter a negative experience with media. A study was developed to examine the idea that “negative images retroactively inhibit memory for material that precedes them, while they proactively enhance memory for material that follows them,” (Newhagen & Reeves, 1992, p. 25). In other words, will watching negative images on the news prevent someone from remembering information that they learned just prior to viewing the negative material? And conversely, will they better remember information they received just after viewing the negative material?\n\nIn the study, researchers created two versions of the same news story – one with compelling negative images and one without. Participants were asked to watch a 20-minute news video (half of the participants saw the negative images and the other half did not) and an additional ten-minute video. They were instructed to pay attention because they would be tested afterwards. A follow up survey was sent 6 to 7 weeks later to measure memory and recall from the news video. The results support the idea that people better remember information that comes after a negative event. Respondents who viewed the negative images better remembered the second half of the newscast than the part preceding the negative images. The findings of this study further support the media equation assumption that mediated experiences are the same as natural experiences.\n\nFor a more in depth look at this study, see Newhagen & Reeves, 1992.\n\nPsychology has demonstrated that being a part of a team has a direct influence on attitude and behavior of team members. Members of a team think they are more similar to each other than people on the outside. There are two main characteristics that define team interactions – identity and interdependence. For a group to become a team the members must identify with each other and exhibit some degree of interdependence on each other. These two characteristics were tested to determine if a computer can be a teammate.\n\nIn this study, participants were assigned to one of two conditions. In the first condition they would be paired with a computer and would become the blue team. The computer had a blue sticker and the human wore a blue wristband to signify that they were in fact a team. The second condition was blue individual, in which a person would use a computer but they were not considered teammates, rather the computer was just a resource. The task was to complete a “Desert Survival Guide” activity in which participants rank items they deem most important if they were left on a deserted island. Human participants initially completed the activity on their own and then completed it using a computer (either as a teammate where both the computer and human were evaluated or just using the computer as a resource). Finally, the participants were allowed to revise their rankings, if they wished to do so. The results of this study indicated that participants who worked with the computer as a teammate viewed the computer as more like them, worked in a similar style to their own, was more cooperative and friendlier than people who worked individually. Another finding of this study showed that participants who worked with the computer as a teammate were more likely to change their behavior and conform to the group ideal even when the teammate was a computer. This study supports the notion that developing a sense of interdependency is the key to establishing team affiliation.\nFor a more detailed account of this study, see Nass, Fogg, & Moon, 1996.\n\nThese are just a few of the many studies that support the media equation. For more in depth reading on this subject and past studies, see the “Further Reading” section at the end of this article.\n\nSome alternative explanations for the media equation have been proposed. But, as Nass and Moon (2000) argue, these explanations do not add up to the body of empirical evidence that supports media equation. One explanation is that people attribute human characteristics to computers, also known as anthropomorphism. Nass and Moon (2000) refute this claim, saying, “Participants in our experiment were adult, experienced computer users. When debriefed, they insisted that they would never respond socially to a computer, and vehemently denied the specific behavior they had in fact exhibited during the experiments,” (p. 93). A second argument against media equation is that participants are actually responding to the programmers behind the computer. Nass and Moon (2000) refute this argument by citing that studies involving multiple computers generally found differences in interactions from computer to computer. If a person was interacting with the programmer behind the computer, then there would be no difference in interaction between computers. Critics have also argued that the way the experiments and questionnaires were designed in the Stanford research may have predisposed their subjects to interact socially with technology. Nass and Moon (2000) counter-argued by saying that the experiments were not misleading. None of the computers used in the experiments were personalized; the computer never referred to itself as “I” and participants interacted with simple text on a screen.\n\nReeves and Nass explain that H. Paul Grice’s maxims for politeness are perhaps the most generally accepted rules on politeness communication and that Grice's rules are a vital basis to explaining the media equation. The four principles consist of Quality, Quantity, Clarity, and Relevance. Reeves and Nass used these principles to help explain how they believed computers could be social actors. Quality refers to how information presented in a conversation should have value, truth, and importance. Quantity refers to how speakers in interaction should present just the right amount of information to make the conversation as useful as possible. Too much or too little information may damage value of information. Reeves and Nass argue that quantity is not something social media executed very well; they feel it causes frustration because computers display too much or too little information to humans when trying to communicate. Relevance refers to the content of information being translated into an interaction- this information should be both relevant and on-topic. Reeves and Nass argue that computers should be customizable so the user has control over relevance, and they observed how computers struggle to respond to wishes or goals of the user.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "528520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=528520", "title": "Theatre of ancient Greece", "text": "Theatre of ancient Greece\n\nThe ancient Greek drama was a theatrical culture that flourished in ancient Greece from 700 BC. The city-state of Athens, which became a significant cultural, political, and military power during this period, was its center, where it was institutionalised as part of a festival called the Dionysia, which honored the god Dionysus. Tragedy (late 500 BC), comedy (490 BC), and the satyr play were the three dramatic genres to emerge there. Athens exported the festival to its numerous colonies.\n\nThe word τραγῳδία ('tragodia'), from which the word \"tragedy\" is derived, is a compound of two Greek words: τράγος (\"tragos\") or \"goat\" and ᾠδή (\"ode\") meaning \"song\", from ἀείδειν (\"aeidein\"), \"to sing\".\nThis etymology indicates a link with the practices of the ancient Dionysian cults. It is impossible, however, to know with certainty how these fertility rituals became the basis for tragedy and comedy.\n\nThe classical Greek valued the power of spoken word, and it was their main method of communication and storytelling. Bahn and Bahn write, \"To Greeks the spoken word was a living thing and infinitely preferable to the dead symbols of a written language.\" Socrates himself believed that once something has been written down, it lost its ability for change and growth. For these reasons, among many others, oral storytelling flourished in Greece.\n\nGreek tragedy as we know it was created in Athens around the time of 532 BC, when Thespis was the earliest recorded actor. Being a winner of the first theatrical contest held in Athens, he was the \"exarchon\", or leader, of the dithyrambs performed in and around Attica, especially at the rural Dionysia. By Thespis' time, the dithyramb had evolved far away from its cult roots. Under the influence of heroic epic, Doric choral lyric and the innovations of the poet Arion, it had become a narrative, ballad-like genre. Because of these, Thespis is often called the \"Father of Tragedy\"; however, his importance is disputed, and Thespis is sometimes listed as late as 16th in the chronological order of Greek tragedians; the statesman Solon, for example, is credited with creating poems in which characters speak with their own voice, and spoken performances of Homer's epics by rhapsodes were popular in festivals prior to 534 BC. Thus, Thespis's true contribution to drama is unclear at best, but his name has been given a longer life, in English, as a common term for performer — i.e., a \"thespian.\"\n\nThe dramatic performances were important to the Athenians – this is made clear by the creation of a tragedy competition and festival in the City Dionysia. This was organized possibly to foster loyalty among the tribes of Attica (recently created by Cleisthenes). The festival was created roughly around 508 BC. While no drama texts exist from the sixth century BC, we do know the names of three competitors besides Thespis: Choerilus, Pratinas, and Phrynichus. Each is credited with different innovations in the field.\n\nMore is known about Phrynichus. He won his first competition between 511 BC and 508 BC. He produced tragedies on themes and subjects later exploited in the golden age such as the \"Danaids\", \"Phoenician Women\" and \"Alcestis\". He was the first poet we know of to use a historical subject – his \"Fall of Miletus\", produced in 493-2, chronicled the fate of the town of Miletus after it was conquered by the Persians. Herodotus reports that \"the Athenians made clear their deep grief for the taking of Miletus in many ways, but especially in this: when Phrynichus wrote a play entitled \"The Fall of Miletus\" and produced it, the whole theatre fell to weeping; they fined Phrynichus a thousand drachmas for bringing to mind a calamity that affected them so personally and forbade the performance of that play forever.\" He is also thought to be the first to use female characters (though not female performers).\n\nUntil the Hellenistic period, all tragedies were unique pieces written in honour of Dionysus and played only once, so that today we primarily have the pieces that were still remembered well enough to have been repeated when the repetition of old tragedies became fashionable (the accidents of survival, as well as the subjective tastes of the Hellenistic librarians later in Greek history, also played a role in what survived from this period).\n\nAfter the Great Destruction of Athens by the Persian Empire in 480 BCE, the town and acropolis were rebuilt, and theatre became formalized and an even greater part of Athenian culture and civic pride. This century is normally regarded as the Golden Age of Greek drama. The centre-piece of the annual Dionysia, which took place once in winter and once in spring, was a competition between three tragic playwrights at the Theatre of Dionysus. Each submitted three tragedies, plus a satyr play (a comic, burlesque version of a mythological subject). Beginning in a first competition in 486 BC each playwright submitted a comedy. Aristotle claimed that Aeschylus added the second actor (deuteragonist), and that Sophocles introduced the third (tritagonist). Apparently the Greek playwrights never used more than three actors based on what is known about Greek theatre.\n\nTragedy and comedy were viewed as completely separate genres, and no plays ever merged aspects of the two. Satyr plays dealt with the mythological subject matter of the tragedies, but in a purely comedic manner.\n\nThe power of Athens declined following its defeat in the Peloponnesian War against the Spartans. From that time on, the theatre started performing old tragedies again. Although its theatrical traditions seem to have lost their vitality, Greek theatre continued into the Hellenistic period (the period following Alexander the Great's conquests in the fourth century BCE). However, the primary Hellenistic theatrical form was not tragedy but 'New Comedy', comic episodes about the lives of ordinary citizens. The only extant playwright from the period is Menander. One of New Comedy's most important contributions was its influence on Roman comedy, an influence that can be seen in the surviving works of Plautus and Terence.\n\nThe plays had a chorus from 12 to 15 people, who performed the plays in verse accompanied by music, beginning in the morning and lasting until the evening. The performance space was a simple circular space, the \"orchestra\", where the chorus danced and sang. The orchestra, which had an average diameter of 78 feet, was situated on a flattened terrace at the foot of a hill, the slope of which produced a natural \"theatron\", literally \"seeing place\". Later, the term \"theatre\" came to be applied to the whole area of theatron, orchestra, and skené. The \"coryphaeus\" was the head chorus member who could enter the story as a character able to interact with the characters of a play.\nThe theatres were originally built on a very large scale to accommodate the large number of people on stage, as well as the large number of people in the audience, up to fourteen thousand. Mathematics played a large role in the construction of these theatres, as their designers had to be able to create acoustics in them such that the actors' voices could be heard throughout the theatre, including the very top row of seats. The Greek's understanding of acoustics compares very favourably with the current state of the art. The first seats in Greek theatres (other than just sitting on the ground) were wooden, but around 499 BCE the practice of inlaying stone blocks into the side of the hill to create permanent, stable seating became more common. They were called the \"prohedria\" and reserved for priests and a few most respected citizens.\n\nIn 465 BCE, the playwrights began using a backdrop or scenic wall, which hung or stood behind the orchestra, which also served as an area where actors could change their costumes. It was known as the \"skênê\" (from which the word \"scene\" derives). The death of a character was always heard behind the \"skênê\", for it was considered inappropriate to show a killing in view of the audience. Conversely, there are scholarly arguments that death in Greek tragedy was portrayed off stage primarily because of dramatic considerations, and not prudishness or sensitivity of the audience. In 425 BC a stone scene wall, called a paraskenia, became a common supplement to \"skênê\" in the theatres. A paraskenia was a long wall with projecting sides, which may have had doorways for entrances and exits. Just behind the paraskenia was the proskenion. The proskenion (\"in front of the scene\") was beautiful, and was similar to the modern day proscenium.\n\nGreek theatres also had tall arched entrances called parodoi or eisodoi, through which actors and chorus members entered and exited the orchestra. By the end of the 5th century BC, around the time of the Peloponnesian War, the \"skênê\", the back wall, was two stories high. The upper story was called the episkenion. Some theatres also had a raised speaking place on the orchestra called the logeion.\n\nThere were several scenic elements commonly used in Greek theatre:\n\n\nThe Ancient Greek term for a mask is \"prosopon\" (lit., \"face\"), and was a significant element in the worship of Dionysus at Athens, likely used in ceremonial rites and celebrations. Most of the evidence comes from only a few vase paintings of the 5th century BC, such as one showing a mask of the god suspended from a tree with decorated robe hanging below it and dancing and the \"Pronomos\" vase, which depicts actors preparing for a Satyr play. No physical evidence remains available to us, as the masks were made of organic materials and not considered permanent objects, ultimately being dedicated at the altar of Dionysus after performances. Nevertheless, the mask is known to have been used since the time of Aeschylus and considered to be one of the iconic conventions of classical Greek theatre.\n\nMasks were also made for members of the chorus, who play some part in the action and provide a commentary on the events in which they are caught up. Although there are twelve or fifteen members of the tragic chorus they all wear the same mask because they are considered to be representing one character.\n\nIllustrations of theatrical masks from 5th century display helmet-like masks, covering the entire face and head, with holes for the eyes and a small aperture for the mouth, as well as an integrated wig. These paintings never show actual masks on the actors in performance; they are most often shown being handled by the actors before or after a performance, that liminal space between the audience and the stage, between myth and reality. Effectively, the mask transformed the actor as much as memorization of the text. Therefore, performance in ancient Greece did not distinguish the masked actor from the theatrical character.\n\nThe mask-makers were called \"skeuopoios\" or \"maker of the properties,\" thus suggesting that their role encompassed multiple duties and tasks. The masks were most likely made out of light weight, organic materials like stiffened linen, leather, wood, or cork, with the wig consisting of human or animal hair. Due to the visual restrictions imposed by these masks, it was imperative that the actors hear in order to orient and balance themselves. Thus, it is believed that the ears were covered by substantial amounts of hair and not the helmet-mask itself. The mouth opening was relatively small, preventing the mouth to be seen during performances. Vervain and Wiles posit that this small size discourages the idea that the mask functioned as a megaphone, as originally presented in the 1960s. Greek mask-maker, Thanos Vovolis, suggests that the mask serves as a resonator for the head, thus enhancing vocal acoustics and altering its quality. This leads to increased energy and presence, allowing for the more complete metamorphosis of the actor into his character.\n\nIn a large open-air theatre, like the Theatre of Dionysus in Athens, the classical masks were able to create a sense of dread in the audience creating large scale panic, especially since they had intensely exaggerated facial features and expressions. They enabled an actor to appear and reappear in several different roles, thus preventing the audience from identifying the actor to one specific character. Their variations help the audience to distinguish sex, age, and social status, in addition to revealing a change in a particular character's appearance, e.g. Oedipus after blinding himself. Unique masks were also created for specific characters and events in a play, such as The Furies in Aeschylus' \"Eumenides\" and Pentheus and Cadmus in Euripides' \"The Bacchae\". Worn by the chorus, the masks created a sense of unity and uniformity, while representing a multi-voiced persona or single organism and simultaneously encouraged interdependency and a heightened sensitivity between each individual of the group. Only 2-3 actors were allowed on the stage at one time, and masks permitted quick transitions from one character to another. There were only male actors, but masks allowed them to play female characters.\n\nThe actors in these plays that had tragic roles wore boots called \"cothurni\" that elevated them above the other actors. The actors with comedic roles only wore a thin soled shoe called a sock. For this reason, dramatic art is sometimes alluded to as \"Sock and Buskin.\"\n\nMelpomene is the muse of tragedy and is often depicted holding the tragic mask and wearing cothurni. Thalia is the muse of comedy and is similarly associated with the mask of comedy and the comedic \"socks\".\n\nMale actors playing female roles would wear a wooden structure on their chests (posterneda) to imitate the look of breasts and another structure on their stomachs (progastreda) to make them appear softer and more lady like. They would also wear white body stockings under their costumes to make their skin appear fairer.\n\nMost costuming detail comes from pottery paintings from that time as costumes and masks were fabricated out of disposable material, so there are little to no remains of any costume from that time. The biggest source of information is the Pronomos Vase where actors are painted at a show's after party.\n\nCostuming would give off a sense of character, as in gender, age, social status, and class. For example, characters of higher class would be dressed in nicer clothing, although everyone was dressed fairly nicely. Contrary to popular belief, they did not dress in only rags and sandals, as they wanted to impress. Some examples of Greek theatre costuming include long robes called the chiton that reached the floor for actors playing gods, heroes, and old men. Actors playing Goddesses and women characters that held a lot of power wore purples and golds. Actors playing Queens and Princesses wore long cloaks that dragged on the ground and were decorated with gold stars and other jewels, and warriors were dressed in a variety of armor and wore helmets adorned with plumes. Costumes were supposed to be colourful and obvious to be easily seen by every seat in the audience.\n\n\n"}

It is the sequel to 1998's \"Rainbow Six\" game based on the Tom Clancy novel of the same name.\n\n\"Rogue Spear\" is based on the same game engine and features gameplay and presentation similar to that of the original \"Rainbow Six\". The game pits the counter-terrorist unit, Rainbow, against global terrorist organizations that in some cases have taken hostages or have armed themselves with weapons of mass destruction. \"Rogue Spear\" focuses on realism, planning, strategy, and teamwork. \"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear\" was released for Microsoft Windows on August 31, 1999, with versions for the Mac OS (2000), Dreamcast (2000), PlayStation (2001), and Game Boy Advance (2002) released later. A PlayStation 2 port was also announced at the time, but it was later canceled.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the economic situation in Russia and the former Eastern Europe falls into chaos. Terrorism in the region is commonplace as people fight a seemingly endless stream of battles for supplies and other necessities. In this power vacuum though a dangerous a situation arises: the Russian mafia has begun buying up surplus military equipment with the assistance of current members of the Russian Army. During one such arms deal Rainbow forces raid the meeting grounds and recover weapons grade plutonium, tracing the missile material to an Arctic naval base. As it turns out, one boss in the Oil Mafia has been supplying arms and intel to various small-time terrorist groups whose international attacks Rainbow has had to deal with: A hostage situation at the Met in New York City, the attempted bombing of a tanker in the Sea of Japan, an airline hijacking in Brussels, and the neofascist takeover of a London TV station. But after the hijacking, an anonymous informant who has seen that this terror campaign has gone too far supplies information to Rainbow on who's behind the attacks and where his men will strike next.\n\nA subsequent investigation reveals that the plutonium deals are part of a plan between a Russian organized crime boss named Maxim Kutkin and Azeri arms dealer Samed Vezirzade. These two men intend to use the plutonium purchased from the military to create suitcase sized nuclear weapons through the use of abandoned Russian military facilities, then distribute these weapons to terrorists on the black market. To prevent any instance of nuclear terrorism, Rainbow mobilizes against both parties, raiding the nuclear weapons production facility and intercepting two separate meetings between the mob and potential buyers with the aid of a dissident group of the Russian mob.\n\nIn the final two missions Rainbow zeros in Vezirzade's base of operations, raiding his fortress and killing him after an attempt to bring him in alive fails. In the aftermath of Vezirzade's death, Kutkin realizes that the overall plan to manufacture and sell nuclear weapons has failed, and seeks vengeance for the collapse of the arms deals. With the assistance of a small number of men loyal to him, Kutkin seizes control of a commercial nuclear power plant and threatens to shut off the cooling system for the reactors, which would result in a nuclear meltdown. To prevent a potential repeat of the Chernobyl disaster, Rainbow forces storm the plant and manage to recapture the facility intact.\n\nIn the final debriefing, Kutkin is confirmed to have been killed in the raid. His mansion in Russia is acquired by the \"Russian Godfather\", whose assistance had been vital during Rainbow's operations (it turns out he was the anonymous informant, and Kutkin was his own insane son-in-law). After arriving at the mansion, the Russian Godfather makes a short speech which is picked up by surveillance bugs planted during an earlier Rainbow intelligence operation. The godfather then shoots the bug, preventing any further monitoring of the mafia from the mansion.\n\nThe term \"Rogue Spear\" was invented by Clancy and refers to the possession of nuclear weapons by a non-state entity, equivalent to the official terminology Pinnacle-Empty Quiver.\n\nRogue Spear’s online multiplayer consists of two modes: cooperative and adversarial. In cooperative mode, individuals team up with other players to complete missions against the computer AI in formats similar to the single-player missions. Adversarial mode pits players against one another with Survival, a mode similar to Deathmatch, and Team Survival, similar to Team Deathmatch garnering the vast majority of play. Rogue Spear does not support dedicated servers, with games being limited to sixteen players per server. An active competitive scene has surrounded the game, with players forming clans and participating in ladder play.\n\n\"Rogue Spear Mission Pack: Urban Operations\", released on April 4, 2000, was the first expansion for \"Rogue Spear\". It was developed and published by Red Storm Entertainment. It added eight new maps and five classic \"Rainbow Six\" maps from the original game, as well as three new weapons.\n\n\"Urban Operations\" was re-released by KAMA Digital Entertainment in South Korea - this new edition included two exclusive missions and two new weapons.\n\nWith the release of \"Urban Operations\", a built-in mod system was added to manage user-made \"mods\" or modifications.\n\n\"Rainbow Six: Covert Ops\" is a stand-alone expansion pack of \"Rogue Spear\". The training simulator was developed by Magic Lantern Playware, six of the levels were done by Zombie Studios and three of the levels were done by Red Storm Entertainment. It was published by Red Storm Entertainment. It was released on September 28, 2000. It included nine new missions, because the product was primarily developed as an educational program on real life counter-terrorism history and tactics.\n\nThe training simulator developed by Magic Lantern Playware was actually a Computer Based Training program. \"Recruits\" would create a profile, and then read educational materials such as actual military Field Manuals, view video interviews from anti-terrorist experts, take multiple-choice tests to progress in rank, and see live-fire demonstrations of the weapons included in the game. For the live-fire videos, Sergeant Anthony Levatino (now Deputy Chief) from the Santa Ana, California Police Department was contracted to provide content expertise for the educational material and for the on-camera demonstrations. Having access to all the weapons included in the game, and being a SWAT Team Leader/Sniper and SWAT Academy instructor, Sergeant Levatino provided brief weapon introductions and live-fire demonstrations.\n\n\"Rogue Spear: Black Thorn\" was developed by Red Storm Entertainment, published by Ubisoft, and released as a stand-alone add-on on December 15, 2001, featuring new singleplayer and multiplayer maps, along with new weapons and a new multiplayer game mode. The singleplayer plot features a mentally disturbed ex-SAS operative challenging Team Rainbow with reenactments of real-life terrorist attacks, such as the Entebbe Operation and the Japanese embassy hostage crisis.\n\n\"Rogue Spear\" was met with positive to mixed reception upon release. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 85.97% for the PC version; 75.77% and 76 out of 100 for the Game Boy Advance version; 72.62% and 75 out of 100 for the Dreamcast version; and 60.07% for the PlayStation version.\n\nIn the United States, \"Rogue Spear\"s sales reached 240,503 copies by April 2000. In the same country, the game's \"Platinum\" re-release sold another 240,000 copies and earned $7.7 million by August 2006, after its launch in October 2001. It was the country's 85th best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006.\n\nThe editors of \"PC Gamer US\" named \"Rogue Spear\" the best action game of 1999, and wrote, \"Congratulations, Red Storm... in a loud market, you made the quiet revolution.\" \"Rogue Spear\" was a finalist for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences' 1999 \"Action Game of the Year\" award, which ultimately went to \"\".\n\nExpansion packs of the PC version received lower scores than the original release. The most recent was \"Black Thorn\", which currently has a score of 71.92% on GameRankings, and 67 out of 100 on Metacritic.\n\n"}

It was founded in 1971, following the opening of Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Florida.\n\nOriginally, the company was known as Walt Disney Outdoor Recreation Division and later as Walt Disney Attractions. The chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts was Bob Chapek, formerly president of Disney Consumer Products. Chapek reports to Disney CEO Bob Iger. In 2016, the company's theme parks hosted over 140.4 million guests, making Disney Parks the world's most visited theme park company worldwide,<ref name=\"TEA/AECOM\"></ref> with United Kingdom-based Merlin Entertainments coming in second. It is by far Disney's largest business segment according to employee headcount, with approximately 130,000 of the company's 180,000 employees as of 2015. In March 2018, Parks and Resorts was merged with Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media to form Walt Disney Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products.\n\nIn 1949, Ice Capades added a Disney segment to its performances. Costumes from those shows were used at the opening of Disneyland in 1955 with some performers hired away for Disney.\n\nOriginally, entry into the theme park and travel business was a side project of Walt Disney himself. As the Disneylandia project started to become a reality, Walt Disney Productions at Walt's request set up Disneyland, Inc. (DLI) in 1951 and agreed to a design deal in March 1953 with WED Enterprises (WED), Walt's personal corporation, which then included what would now be called Disney Imagineering. With the WED concept designs and prospectus for Disneylandia, Roy Disney in September 1953 met with TV networks in a deal for Disney-produced TV show and Disneyland investment. American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres (AB-PT) agreed to the Disneyland, Inc. investment. Joining AB-PT as Disneyland investors were Walt Disney Productions (WDP), Western Publishing and Walt Disney. Walt Disney Productions had the option to repurchase the Walt Disney, WED and Western Publishing shares (31%) by May 1, 1959, for $562,500.\n\nWith a need for the Disneyland Hotel nearby and no funding available for Disney to build it, Walt Disney approached Jack Wrather to build the hotel who agreed.\n\nDisneyland, changed from Disneylandia, was announced in by Walt to be opened in . On , the Disneyland park with five themed \"lands\" containing eighteen attractions with double the expected guests. WED owned Santa Fe & Disneyland Railroad opened, too.\n\nOn , Disney Production exercised its options to purchase all but AB-PT's common stock outstanding. This allowed WDP to consolidate DLI into its 1957 annual accounting statements adding four months worth of net profits, $511K. In June 1960, Walt Disney Productions completed the purchase of AB-PT's share of the company for nearly $7.5 million and its TV contract, and the theme park became a fully owned subsidiary of Walt Disney Productions. The first Audio-Animatronic attraction, Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room, opened at Disneyland in 1963.\n\nBeginning in 1958 with the contracting of Economics Research Associates (ERA) to find a location for another Disney resort, Disney Productions moved beyond a single park. ERA recommended Florida; another study in 1961 named Ocala or Orlando in Florida as possible locations. In , Walt Disney made a trip to Florida for final site selection. In 1962, Disney Productions purchased Celebrity Sports Center (opened on September 17, 1960, in Denver, Colorado) from its owners, including Walt Disney, Art Linkletter, and John Payne, to use as a staff training center for its second resort. In 1963, Roy made plans to buy from , which was carried out in 1964, amassing by . Plans for the Florida project that would eventually become Walt Disney World were announced to the public in . Legislation forming the Reedy Creek Improvement District was signed into law by Florida Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. on May 12, 1967, allowing Disney to build the infrastructure for the second park. Ground breaking followed for the future Reedy Creek park on May 30. In Roy O. Disney's last act as CEO in 1968, he officially named the second park Walt Disney World.\n\nDisneyland International was incorporated on . The next year, The Oriental Land Company contacted Disney about building a theme park.\n\nIn , the WED-owned Disneyland-Alweg Monorail System was installed at Disneyland. Disneyland's first new themed land, New Orleans Square, opened in . Tomorrowland was revamped in 1967 with seven new attractions. The design and architectural group and the WED Enterprise name was purchased from Walt's corporation, renamed as Retlaw Enterprise.\n\nDisney expanded into attractions at the 1964 New York World's Fair with It's a Small World and costumed character appearances. When the characters proved a hit at the 1964 World's Fair, Walt wanted another outlet for \"live\" characters; thus, Disneyland put on \"Disney on Parade\", a self-produced live arena show starting in 1969. Small World and its famous song lasted two years at the fair; it was then moved to Disneyland as an expanded major attraction in 1966 and later duplicated in the other Disney theme parks.\n\nIn 1965, Walt Disney won a bid with the US Forest Service to develop Mineral King as a ski resort. The Sierra Club sued in to stop the development, which was granted by the federal district judge. The Forest Service appealed and won at the appeal and the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruling left open to the Club the possibility of refiling. In the next round of lawsuits, the same district judge blocked the redevelopment. The injunction and the passage of the National Environmental Policy Act led to Disney backing out.\n\n$40 million worth of Walt Disney Productions Convertible Debentures were sold in to fund Disney World (WDW). The next year in February, an agreement was made with multiple labor unions, in which the unions exchanged the right to strike for regular pay increases during the first building phase. By 1971, chairman of the Park Operations Committee and vice president of park operations Dick Nunis was appointed executive vice president of Disneyland and Walt Disney World.\n\nWalt Disney World began operation on , with the Magic Kingdom park at a cost of $400 million. The Magic Kingdom had six themed lands: Main Street, Adventureland, Fantasyland, Frontierland, Liberty Square, and Tomorrowland. Additionally, Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort campground and two hotels, Disney's Contemporary Resort and Disney's Polynesian Village Resort, also opened.\n\nDisneyland expanded in 1972 with a seventh themed land, Bear Country, replacing the Indian Village of Frontierland, and later renamed Critter Country. In 1979, the Disneyland crafts and maintenance union workers went on strike for 15 days, at first rejecting and then accepting the park's contract. Space Mountain opens at Disneyland in 1977.\n\nTwo more hotels opened in 1973 at Walt Disney World: the Golf Resort and the Gold Resort; Disney's Village Resort hotel opened in 1974. Disney opened the Buena Vista Club golf club in Lake Buena Vista on . Lake Buena Vista Village, the shopping area, opened on and was renamed Walt Disney World Village in 1977. Celebrity Sports Center, Disney World's training center, was sold on March 29, 1979.\n\nAt Walt Disney World, the Treasure Island nature preserve pens opened on April 8, 1974, renamed Discovery Island in 1977. On , the WEDway PeopleMover opened in the Magic Kingdom's Tomorrowland. The first water park, River Country, opened on at Disney World. EPCOT Center's groundbreaking occurred at Walt Disney World in May 1979.\n\nIn 1979, Oriental Land and Disney agreed to build a Japanese theme park. Tokyo Disneyland opened on on in Urayasu, Chiba, Japan.\n\nWith the June 3, 1980, retirement of Donn Tatum as Walt Disney Productions' Chairman and CEO, three divisions were formed, including the Walt Disney Outdoor Recreation Division, of which Nunis was named division president. Disneyland started using Disney Dollars on May 5, 1987, while Walt Disney World parks started with Epcot on October 2. A renegotiated Disneyland Japan royalty agreement in April 1988 by Chief Financial Officer Gary L. Wilson netted Disney US$723 million in cash in exchange for lower royalty payments.\n\nThe steam railroad and monorail at Disneyland were purchased from Retlaw Enterprises, formerly WED Enterprises, in 1982. Bear Country was renamed Critter Country on November 23, 1988.\n\nTishman Company's plans for two Walt Disney World hotels were rejected by new CEO Michael Eisner on September 30, 1984, marking a change in Disney architecture. New plans for the Dolphin and Swan hotels were submitted by Michael Graves in July 1986; ground breaking took place on January 28, 1988. The first non-Disney owned hotel, Pickett Suite Resort, opened in Disney World Village on March 15, 1987.\n\nOn June 1, 1982, the Walt Disney World monorail line was extended to EPCOT Center from the Ticket and Transportation Center. The EPCOT Center theme park opened on October 1, 1982, at a building cost of US$1.2 billion, with two areas, Future World and World Showcase.\n\nPlans for a Hollywood-style theme park were announced in April 1985 for the Walt Disney World resort at a project cost of US$300 million. In April 1985, Disney signed a licensing agreement with MGM, giving Disney the right to use the MGM name, logo and movie library for this third park. Construction of the Disney-MGM Studios theme park began in 1986. Disney-MGM Studios opened on May 1, 1989, along with a Pleasure Island entertainment area; its second water park, Disney's Typhoon Lagoon, opened on June 1. In 1983, Walt Disney World Village's name was changed to the Disney Village Marketplace. A new themed area, Mickey's Birthdayland, opened in the Magic Kingdom near Fantasyland on June 18, 1988.\n\nIn 1987, Disney and Ron Brierley's Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd., already a 28% owner of the Wrather Corporation, agreed to purchase the remaining Wrather Corporation stock with a 50% share each. Wrather Corporation owned the Disneyland Hotel and operated the Queen Mary and Spruce Goose tourist attractions. In March 1988, Disney purchased Industrial Equity's half of Wrather Corporation.\n\nIn 1985, Premier Cruise Line became the licensed partner cruise line with Disney. This allowed Disney characters on their ships and combined cruise, hotel, and theme park packages.\n\nThe Walt Disney Outdoor Recreation Division was incorporated as Walt Disney Attractions, Inc. on August 10, 1989. In January 1990, Disney CEO Eisner announced plans to expand both Disneyland (by 20% in 10 years) and Disney World (WDW). The plan would have WDW add another theme park and 16 new attractions in Disney-MGM Studios. Disney and The Coca-Cola Company agreed to a 15-year marketing contract on January 25: Coca-Cola products would be exclusive in Disney theme parks, and Coca-Cola would use some Disney characters in their ads. On March 16, 1990, Attractions president Nunis announced a 25-year plan for a development in Osceola, Florida, with homes, shopping malls and industrial buildings.\n\nIn 1990, the possibility of a West Coast version of Epcot Center was placed in development. This was announced as WestCOT in 1991, to be placed at the Disneyland Resort. On July 31, 1990, a new ocean-themed park and resort, Port Disney, was announced for Long Beach. Port was to have a cruise-ship terminal, five hotels, restaurants, and shopping area, costing $2 billion to build. On December 12, 1991, Disney selected only one California project to go forward with, Disneyland Resort, which was to include the WestCOT Center, hotels, a shopping mall and a lake. Port Disney was abandoned in March 1992, and Disney canceled its leases on the Queen Mary and Spruce Goose attractions picked up from the Wrather Corporation. Mickey's Toontown, a new themed land at Disneyland, opened on January 24, 1993. Disney canceled its plans for WestCOT in mid-1995 due to financial issues at Disneyland Paris and the park's projected high cost. That park was then replaced by plans for the California Adventure park, hotels and a retail district.\n\nAt Walt Disney World, Mickey's Birthdayland closed on April 22, 1991, then reopened on May 26 as Mickey's Starland. In order to expand Disney World on wetland, on April 23, 1993, the company agreed to form a wilderness preserve in Florida. The Disney Inn hotel was leased starting February 1, 1994, by the US Army, then purchased on January 12, 1996, and later renamed Shades of Green. Planet Hollywood opened a location in Pleasure Island on December 17, 1994. The third water park at Walt Disney World, Disney's Blizzard Beach, opened on April 1, 1995. The Magic Kingdom's Tomorrowland was completely refurbished and reopened in June, 1995. Taking up a corner of the Magic Kingdom parking lot, the Walt Disney World Speedway opened on November 28, 1995.

In July 1965, Disney canceled the project.\n\nIn the 1960s, Disney initiated a plan for a ski resort at Mineral King in California. Opposition from environmental groups led by the Sierra Club led to a temporary court injunction in 1969 and legal battles through the 1970s. The project's planning and scale changed multiple times, and in 1978, Mineral King was annexed into Sequoia National Park, ending any possibility of developing a ski resort.\n\nDisney reportedly had plans to build a park named Disney's America. The park was to have been located in Haymarket, Virginia, but local opposition to the idea persuaded Disney to abandon the idea in 1994.

The project will be partially funded by Shamrock Holdings, a Disney-affiliated investment firm. In the wake of reports from Israeli business newspaper \"Globes\" and industry newswire \"Amusement Management\" that Disney itself would be involved in the project's development, a spokesperson for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts clarified to \"Fast Company\" that Disney did not have any plans to involve itself in the building of the park.\n\nIt was reported in August 2014 that beginning in 2015, Disney planned to expand the presence of \"Star Wars\" throughout their theme parks (though it was initially unclear which parks) and could also create an entire theme park area dedicated to the film franchise.

In 2012, Disney acquired Lucasfilm, which includes the rights to the \"Star Wars\" franchise and \"Indiana Jones\" franchise (which is also expected to see an increase in presence at the theme parks), and in December 2015, Disney released \"\", the first of a new trilogy of films. was announced on August 15, 2015 as Star Wars Land, and is currently under construction at the Disneyland Resort in California and Disney's Hollywood Studios in Florida. Both lands are set to open in 2019.

Future Avatar-themed lands could be built for the other Disney Resorts, including the locations in Shanghai and Hong Kong.\n\nBoth Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Disneyland Paris Resort have room for future expansion. CEO Robert Iger frequently has cited international expansion as one of the company's three strategic priorities.\n\nDue to its acquisitions of Marvel Entertainment in 2009 and Lucasfilm in 2012, some Disney-owned franchises are represented in its competitors' parks. Marvel Super Hero Island, a themed land featuring characters and settings from Marvel Comics, has operated at Universal Orlando Resort's Islands of Adventure park since 1999, as well as the Islands of Adventure cloned ride \"The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man\" at Universal Studios Japan since 2004. Under Marvel's 1994 agreement with Universal Parks & Resorts in regional terms, none of the Marvel characters and other persons related to such characters (e.g., side characters, team members, and the villains associated with the Avengers, Fantastic Four, X-Men, Spider-Man, etc.) connected with Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios Japan can be used at Walt Disney World and Tokyo Disney Resort. Disneyland Resort, Walt Disney World, and Tokyo Disney also cannot use the Marvel name as part of an attraction or marketing and the Marvel-themed simulator ride. This clause has allowed Walt Disney World to have meet and greets with Marvel characters not associated with the ones at Islands of Adventure, such as Star-Lord and Gamora from \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" as well as Baymax and Hiro from \"Big Hero 6\". Hong Kong Disneyland, Shanghai Disneyland, and Disneyland Paris either have or planned to incorporate meet and greets as well as attractions relating to the Marvel characters, as well as using the Marvel name and the Marvel simulator ride.\n\nA \"Star Wars\"-themed section of Legoland California's Miniland USA opened in 2011, with a similar version opening at Legoland Florida in November 2012, just weeks after Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm and the \"Star Wars\" franchise.\n\nIMG Worlds of Adventure in Dubai has a Marvel-themed section.\n\nWhile Disney Parks generally adapt movies into rides, some Disney theme park attractions have been adapted into or have served inspiration for films, books, comic books, and television pilots. Disney entered the television field with a network TV show named after Disneyland (which was then its only park, and was being built at the time), in order to fund the park. In this series, some episodes featured the park or a park attraction. The Walt Disney Company pioneered and is the only film company and theme park company to have converted theme park attractions to film productions. However, lackluster results were achieved for most of these films except for the Pirates Of The Caribbean series. Disney Pictures made two Pirates Of The Caribbean sequels in 2006 and 2011 that made over a billion-dollar at the box office.\n\nAt first, Disney had merely dabbled with this type of film. Disney Telefilms made the first movie-based-on-ride, Tower of Terror, for the Wonderful World of Disney anthology television series in 1997. In 2000, Touchstone Pictures made \"Mission to Mars\" based on the closed ride of the same name.\n\nWalt Disney Pictures took the Country Bear Jamboree attraction and made it into \"The Country Bears\" in 2002. In 2003, Walt Disney Pictures issued two ride-based films in \"\" and \"The Haunted Mansion\". \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" launched a film series and a franchise. After four Pirates sequels, the franchise took in more than $5.4 billion worldwide.\n\nDisney Publishing Worldwide started mining Disney Parks with its The Kingdom Keepers series. The first novel of the series, \"Disney after Dark\", was released in 2005. A five-book series was laid out by Pearson, but was extended to seven with the first book's success.\n\nWith the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise as Disney Pictures' top franchise, the company had been looking for additional projects in this category for a decade. Disney Pictures took another push at additional adaptations in the 2010s. By November 2010, Jon Favreau had been tapped to develop the Magic Kingdom park into a \"Night at the Museum\" like film, with Strike Entertainment signed on to produce it after a script by Ronald D. Moore was turned down. Another Haunted Mansion film was in the works with Guillermo del Toro as of August 2012. Mr. Toad's Wild Ride ride film was in the works at Disney Pictures by January 2013. Tomorrowland, first to be loosely based on a theme park area, was announced in January 2013 for a December 2014 release. Also in 2013, American Broadcasting Company had ordered a pilot based on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. It's A Small World was added to the list of known projects in April 2014. Tower of Terror was given a theatrical treatment by John August under producer Jim Whitaker in October 2015, while the long-in-production Jungle Cruise gained an actor.\n\nMarvel Publishing with Disney announced in October 2013 that in January 2014 it would release its first comic book title under their joint \"Disney Kingdoms\" imprint \"Seekers of the Weird\", a five-issue miniseries inspired by a never built Disneyland attraction Museum of the Weird. On March 31, 2015, the first novel in The Kingdom Keeper sequel trilogy series was released.\n\nIn May 2017, Freeform cable channel aired a special documentary, \"Disney's Fairy Tale Weddings\", based on the services provided by Disney Parks and Resorts unit, Disney's Fairy Tale Weddings & Honeymoons. With success of the May special, the show was picked up as a series with seven episodes in October 2017. However, another special, Holiday Magic, was aired on December 11, 2017 with the now six episode regular series starting on June 11, 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
