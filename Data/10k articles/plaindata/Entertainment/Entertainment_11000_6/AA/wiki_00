Its lyrics were written by the Buenos Aires-born politician Vicente López y Planes and the music was composed by the Spanish musician Blas Parera. The work was adopted as the sole official song on May 11, 1813, three years after the May Revolution; May 11 is therefore now Anthem Day in Argentina.\n\nSome first, quite different, anthems were composed from 1810; a version was then introduced in 1813 which was used throughout the nineteenth century. The present, much shorter, anthem comprises only the first and last verses and the chorus of the 1813 Patriotic March, omitting much emotional text about the struggle for independence from Spain (\"with strong arms they tear to pieces the arrogant Iberian lion\").\n\nThe third Argentine national anthem was originally named \" (), later renamed \" (), and then \"\" (). It has been called \"Himno Nacional Argentino\" since it was published with that name in 1847.\n\nThe first Argentine national anthem was the \"Patriotic March\", published on 15 November 1810 in the \"\". It had lyrics by Esteban de Luca and music by Blas Parera. This original composition made no reference to the name of Argentina (the country was not formally named \"República Argentina\" until 1826, although it was referred to as such) or an independentist will, and talked instead about Spain being conquered by France in the Peninsular War, the absolutist restoration begun by the Council of Regency, and the need to keep the republican freedoms achieved so far in the Americas: \"Spain was victim / of the plotting Gaul / because to the tyrants / she bent her neck / If there treachery / has doomed a thousands cities / let sacred freedom and union reign here / Let the father to the sons / be able to say / enjoy rights / that I did not enjoy\".\n\nIn mid-1812, the ruling triumvirate ordered the Buenos Aires Cabildo to commission a national anthem. Cayetano Rodríguez, a Franciscan friar, wrote a text that was approved on 4 August. The Catalan musician Blas Parera, music director of the local theater, set it to music and performed it for the first time with the orchestra he conducted on 1 November.\n\nLess than a year later the Assembly of Year XIII estimated that the song was not effective enough to serve as a national anthem. On 6 March 1813 several poets were asked to submit lyrics. The poem by the lawyer Vicente López y Planes was unanimously considered the best. It was approved as the \"sole national march\" (\"\") on May 11, 1813. Parera was asked to compose a new musical setting around the same date. He must have finished the piece in a few days. Oral tradition has it that the premiere took place on May 14, 1813 at the home of the aristocrat Mariquita Sánchez de Thompson, but there is no documentary evidence of that. If this episode is true, then Parera, contrary to certain misconceptions, wrote quickly and under no visible coercion. The published song sheet is dated 14 May 1813. He again conducted the official premiere in the theater on May 28, and was paid 200 pesos.\n\nThe composition was then known as ' (National Patriotic Song), and later simply as ' (Patriotic Song), but in Juan Pedro Esnaola's early arrangement, dated around 1848, it appeared under the title \"\", and the name has been retained until today. In the complete version of the Anthem of May (as was christened by López) it is noted that the political vision portrayed is not only Argentine, but Latin American. The lyrics are ardently pro-independence and anti-Spanish, as the country was at that time fighting for its independence from Spain.\n\nThe song became popular immediately. Within ten years documented performances took place throughout Argentina, and also in Chile, Peru, and Colombia until they had their own national anthems. Different versions emerged, making mass singing difficult; several reforms were then proposed. In 1860 Esnaola was commissioned to create an official version. He took the task to heart, making many changes to the music, including a slower tempo, a fuller texture, alterations to the melody, and enrichment of the harmony. In 1927 a committee produced a historicist version that undid several of Esnaola's changes, but introduced new problems in the sung line. After a heated public debate fueled by the newspaper \"\", this version was rejected and, following the recommendations of a second committee, Esnaola's arrangement was officially reinstated. In 1944 it was confirmed as the official anthem.\n\nThroughout the 19th century the anthem was sung in its entirety. However, once harsh feelings against Spain had dissipated, and the country had become home to many Spanish immigrants, a modification was introduced by a decree of President Julio Argentino Roca on March 30, 1900:\nThe song includes a line that has given rise to controversy: \"Buenos--Ayres se [o]pone á la frente De los pueblos de la ínclita union\". In the manuscript and an early printed song-sheet the word \"opone\" is used; a slightly later version of the song-sheet correcting obvious errors such as spelling mistakes was issued with the same date of 14 May 1813, but with \"opone\" changed to \"pone\". The meaning reverses: \"Buenos Aires \"opposes\" the front of the people of the union\" to \"Buenos Aires \"positions itself at\" the front ...\". The original \"opone\" has been interpreted as advancing part of the centralist views in Buenos Aires, but has also been considered a \"tragical misprint\". In many other lines the anthem goes beyond the Argentine theater of the Spanish American wars of independence and references events in Mexico, Central America, Northern South America, and Upper Peru. The growing ideas of independence are reflected in lines such as \"On the surface of the earth rises a glorious new nation, her head is crowned with laurels, and a Lion lies defeated at her feet\". This portrays not just Spanish absolutism, but Spain itself, as the enemy.\n\nThe words strongly attacking Spain were no longer sung.\n\nPerformance of the national anthem is mandatory during all official events, and Argentines in attendance are expected to stand up and sing it. Radio broadcasters voluntarily perform the anthem at midnight, while TV channels do so before closing down their daily broadcast. On national holidays, it is mandatory to perform the national anthem at midnight and noon.\n\nThe national anthem is ruled in Argentine law by Decree 10302/1944.\n\nThe rock musician Charly García broke legal regulations dealing with the reproduction of the song when he included an idiosyncratic cover version in his 1990 album ', stirring much controversy. In 1998 various Argentine artists reedited the anthem and other patriotic songs in the joint album '. Other singers followed on their footsteps recreating the piece in their own ways.\n\nA line from the original version of the national anthem was used as the Argentine title of the 1928 film known in English as \"The Charge of the Gauchos\".\n\nThe national anthem appears at the beginning of the 1985 film \"The Official Story\", an Academy Award winner.\n\nDue to the excessive length of the official version, in international events such as the Olympic Games, professional soccer games, and the Rugby World Cup, only the instrumental introduction (which lasts 1 minute 6 seconds) is played. Another variation is to play the musical break that leads into the chorus, the chorus itself, and the coda. Although traditional, these arrangements are not recognized by Argentine law.\n\nThe following is the modern version, adopted in 1924, omitting the long anti-Spanish middle section.\n"}

{"id": "25136770", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25136770", "title": "Cognitive musicology", "text": "Cognitive musicology\n\nCognitive musicology is a branch of cognitive science concerned with computationally modeling musical knowledge with the goal of understanding both music and cognition.\n\nCognitive musicology can be differentiated from other branches of music psychology via its methodological emphasis, using computer modeling to study music-related knowledge representation with roots in artificial intelligence and cognitive science. The use of computer models provides an exacting, interactive medium in which to formulate and test theories.\n\nThis interdisciplinary field investigates topics such as the parallels between language and music in the brain. Biologically inspired models of computation are often included in research, such as neural networks and evolutionary programs. This field seeks to model how musical knowledge is represented, stored, perceived, performed, and generated. By using a well-structured computer environment, the systematic structures of these cognitive phenomena can be investigated.\n\nEven while enjoying the simplest of melodies there are multiple brain processes that are synchronizing to comprehend what is going on. After the stimulus enters and undergoes the processes of the ear, it enters the auditory cortex, part of the temporal lobe, which begins processing the sound by assessing its pitch and volume. From here, brain functioning differs amongst the analysis of different aspects of music. For instance, the rhythm is processed and regulated by the left frontal cortex, the left parietal cortex and the right cerebellum standardly. Tonality, the building of musical structure around a central chord, is assessed by the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum (Abram, 2015). Music is able to access many different brain functions that play an integral role in other higher brain functions such as motor control, memory, language, reading and emotion. Research has shown that music can be used as an alternative method to access these functions that may be unavailable through non-musical stimulus due to a disorder. Musicology explores the use of music and how it can provide alternative transmission routes for information processing in the brain for diseases such as Parkinson's and dyslexia as well.\n\nThe polymath Christopher Longuet-Higgins, who coined the term \"cognitive science\", is one of the pioneers of cognitive musicology. Among other things, he is noted for the computational implementation of an early key-finding algorithm. Key finding is an essential element of tonal music, and the key-finding problem has attracted considerable attention in the psychology of music over the past several decades. Carol Krumhansl and Mark Schmuckler proposed an empirically grounded key-finding algorithm which bears their names. Their approach is based on key-profiles which were painstakingly determined by what has come to be known as the probe-tone technique. This algorithm has successfully been able to model the perception of musical key in short excerpts of music, as well as to track listeners' changing sense of key movement throughout an entire piece of music. David Temperley, whose early work within the field of cognitive musicology applied dynamic programming to aspects of music cognition, has suggested a number of refinements to the Krumhansl-Schmuckler Key-Finding Algorithm.\n\nOtto Laske was a champion of cognitive musicology. A collection of papers that he co-edited served to heighten the visibility of cognitive musicology and to strengthen its association with AI and music. The foreword of this book reprints a free-wheeling interview with Marvin Minsky, one of the founding fathers of AI, in which he discusses some of his early writings on music and the mind. AI researcher turned cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter has also contributed a number of ideas pertaining to music from an AI perspective. Musician Steve Larson, who worked for a time in Hofstadter's lab, formulated a theory of \"musical forces\" derived by analogy with physical forces. Hofstadter also weighed in on David Cope's experiments in musical intelligence, which take the form of a computer program called EMI which produces music in the form of, say, Bach, or Chopin, or Cope.\n\nCope's programs are written in Lisp, which turns out to be a popular language for research in cognitive musicology. Desain and Honing have exploited Lisp in their efforts to tap the potential of microworld methodology in cognitive musicology research. Also working in Lisp, Heinrich Taube has explored computer composition from a wide variety of perspectives. There are, of course, researchers who chose to use languages other than Lisp for their research into the computational modeling of musical processes. Tim Rowe, for example, explores \"machine musicianship\" through C++ programming. A rather different computational methodology for researching musical phenomena is the toolkit approach advocated by David Huron. At a higher level of abstraction, Gerraint Wiggins has investigated general properties of music knowledge representations such as structural generality and expressive completeness.\n\nAlthough a great deal of cognitive musicology research features symbolic computation, notable contributions have been made from the biologically inspired computational paradigms. For example, Jamshed Bharucha and Peter Todd have modeled music perception in tonal music with neural networks. Al Biles has applied genetic algorithms to the composition of jazz solos. Numerous researchers have explored algorithmic composition grounded in a wide range of mathematical formalisms.\n\nWithin cognitive psychology, among the most prominent researchers is Diana Deutsch, who has engaged in a wide variety of work ranging from studies of absolute pitch and musical illusions to the formulation of musical knowledge representations to relationships between music and language. Equally important is Aniruddh D. Patel, whose work combines traditional methodologies of cognitive psychology with neuroscience. Patel is also the author of a comprehensive survey of cognitive science research on music.\n\nPerhaps the most significant contribution to viewing music from a linguistic perspective is the Generative Theory of Tonal Music (GTTM) proposed by Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff. Although GTTM is presented at the algorithmic level of abstraction rather than the implementational level, their ideas have found computational manifestations in a number of computational projects.\n\nFor the German-speaking area, Laske's conception of cognitive musicology has been advanced by Uwe Seifert in his book \"Systematische Musiktheorie und Kognitionswissenschaft. Zur Grundlegung der kognitiven Musikwissenschaft\" (\"Systematic music theory and cognitive science. The foundation of cognitive musicology\") and subsequent publications.\n\nBoth music and speech rely on sound processing and require interpretation of several sound features such as timbre, pitch, duration, and their interactions (Elzbieta, 2015). A fMRI study revealed that the Broca's and Wernicke's areas, two areas that are known to activated during speech and language processing, were found activated while the subject was listening to unexpected musical chords (Elzbieta, 2015). This relation between language and music may explain why, it has been found that exposure to music has produced an acceleration in the development of behaviors related to the acquisition of language. The Suzuki music education which is very widely known, emphasizes learning music by ear over reading musical notation and preferably begins with formal lessons between the ages of 3 and 5 years. One fundamental reasoning in favor of this education points to a parallelism between natural speech acquisition and purely auditory based musical training as opposed to musical training due to visual cues. There is evidence that children who take music classes have obtained skills to help them in language acquisition and learning (Oechslin, 2015), an ability that relies heavily on the dorsal pathway. Other studies show an overall enhancement of verbal intelligence in children taking music classes. Since both activities tap into several integrated brain functions and have shared brain pathways it is understandable why strength in music acquisition might also correlate with strength in language acquisition.\n\nExtensive prenatal exposure to a melody has been shown to induce neural representations that last for several months. In a study done by Partanen in 2013, mothers in the learning group listened to the ‘Twinkle twinkle little star' melody 5 times per week during their last trimester. After birth and again at the age of 4 months, they played the infants in the control and learning group a modified melody in which some of the notes were changed. Both at birth and at the age of 4 months, infants in the \"learning group\" had stronger event related potentials to the unchanged notes than the \"control group\". Since listening to music at a young age can already map out neural representations that are lasting, exposure to music could help strengthen brain plasticity in areas of the brain that are involved in language and speech processing.\n\nIf neural pathways can be stimulated with entertainment there is a higher chance that it will be more easily accessible. This illustrates why music is so powerful and can be used in such a myriad of different therapies. Music that is enjoyable to a person illicit an interesting response that we are all aware of. Listening to music is not perceived as a chore because it is enjoyable, however our brain is still learning and utilizing the same brain functions as it would when speaking or acquiring language. Music has the capability to be a very productive form of therapy mostly because it is stimulating, entertaining, and appears rewarding. Using fMRI, Menon and Levitin found for the first time that listening to music strongly modulates activity in a network of mesolimbic structures involved in reward processing. This included the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), as well as the hypothalamus, and insula, which are all thought to be involved in regulating autonomic and physiological responses to rewarding and emotional stimuli (Gold, 2013).\n\nPitch perception was positively correlated with phonemic awareness and reading abilities in children (Flaugnacco, 2014). Likewise, the ability to tap to a rhythmic beat correlated with performance on reading and attention tests (Flaugnacco, 2014). These are only a fraction of the studies that have linked reading skills with rhythmic perception, which is shown in a meta-analysis of 25 cross-sectional studies that found a significant association between music training and reading skills (Butzlaff, 2000). Since the correlation is so extensive it is natural that researchers have tried to see if music could serve as an alternative pathway to strengthen reading abilities in people with developmental disorders such as dyslexia. Dyslexia is a disorder characterized by a long lasting difficulty in reading acquisition, specifically text decoding. Reading results have been shown to be slow and inaccurate, despite adequate intelligence and instruction. The difficulties have been shown to stem from a phonological core deficit that impacts reading comprehension, memory and prediction abilities (Flaugnacco, 2014). It was shown that music training modified reading and phonological abilities even when these skills are severely impaired. By improving temporal processing and rhythm abilities, through training, phonological awareness and reading skills in children with dyslexia were improved. The OPERA hypothesis proposed by Patel (2011), states that since music places higher demands on the process than speech it bring brings adaptive brain plasticity of the same neural network involved in language processing.\n\nParkinson's disease is a complex neurological disorder that negatively impacts both motor and non-motor functions caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (Ashoori, 2015). This in turn leads to a DA deficiency in the basal ganglia. The deficiencies of dopamine in these areas of the brain have shown to cause symptoms such as tremors at rest, rigidity, akinesia, and postural instability. They are also associated with impairments of internal timing of an individual (Ashoori, 2015). Rhythm is a powerful sensory cue that has shown to help regulate motor timing and coordination when there is a deficient internal timing system in the brain. Some studies have shown that musically cued gait training significantly improves multiple deficits of Parkinsons, including in gait, motor timing, and perceptual timing. Ashoori's study consisted of 15 non-demented patients with idiopathic Parkinson's who had no prior musical training and maintained their dopamine therapy during the trials. There were three 30-min training sessions per week for 1 month where the participants walked to the beats of German folk music without explicit instructions to synchronize their footsteps to the beat. Compared to pre-training gait performance, the Parkinson's patients showed significant improvement in gait velocity and stride length during the training sessions. The gait improvement was sustained for 1 month after training, which indicates a lasting therapeutic effect. Even though this was uncued it shows how the gait of these Parkinson's patients was automatically synchronized with the rhythm of the music. Also the lasting therapeutic effect shows that this might have affected the internal timing of the individual in a way that could not be accessed by other means.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4404443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4404443", "title": "Coin board", "text": "Coin board\n\nThere are two kinds of coin boards.\n\nThe first kind, also known as a merchandise board, is a variation on pull-tab games. A game board of this type typically comes with a registered package of pull-tab tickets, a signers card, and a pay-out slip.\n\nWhen a ticket is sold, the player opens the ticket to reveal its hidden numbers. If a number on the ticket matches a number on the game board, the player wins a prize and/or a chance at one or more seal prizes, which are revealed at the end of the game.\n\nThe game board displays the winning numbers along with the prizes. Some of the winners receive instant cash only, while some of the winning numbers match numbers on coins, wallets, or small panels that are built into the board. When a player opens a ticket containing one of these numbers, the game manager removes the coin or panel and gives it to the player. When the coin or panel is removed, a prize is revealed that may consist of instant cash, merchandise, and/or a chance at a seal prize. Instant cash or merchandise winnings are given to the player immediately by the manager.\n\nIf a player wins a chance at a seal prize, that player's name is added to the signers card. When the game ends—all the tickets sell out, or all the prizes are won—the manager opens the seals on the game board (or, in some versions, scratches off an opaque substance) to reveal the winning numbers. The players whose names appear next to the winning numbers on the signers card win a seal prize. The seal prizes are usually the most valuable prizes.\n\nUnited States collector coins are embedded in most coin boards sold in the US. Sometimes they are visible, and sometimes they are hidden behind panels. \"Coin boards\" contain only coin and cash prizes. \"Merchandise boards\" also contain coins, but some or all of the prizes consist of merchandise rather than cash.\n\nThe \"pay-out slip\" that is typically provided with each board lists the number of winners and values of all prizes. This information may be used for accounting purposes and to verify that the game complies with local gaming regulations.\n\nThe second kind of coin board, also known as a coin collecting board, is one intended for collectors of coins to assemble a complete set of dates and mints for a particular coin series. It consists of a strip of cardboard, typically measuring 11 inches wide by 14 inches tall, with holes punched into it the size of the particular coins. A face paper having the same hole pattern carries the appropriate text and graphics. This typically consists of dates and mintmarks printed beneath each opening, sometimes with the addition of the number of pieces coined for that issue. A bold title for the coin series will appear at the top of the board, and the bottom of the face will have publication and copyright information. On some coin boards the bottom of the face will also provide some historical and technical information about the coin series, as well as misguided instructions for cleaning the coins. On the most common coin boards, those published by Whitman, this information was later moved to the back of the board, and this is more typical for other publishers, too.\n\nThe coin collecting board was invented in 1934 by Joseph Kent Post, an engineer with Kimberly-Clark in Neenah, Wisconsin. His knowledge of paper products and their manufacture, combined with his interest in coin collecting, prompted him to devise this inexpensive means to collect coins. Debuting early in 1935, his first coin boards (one each for Indian Head and Lincoln Cents) were priced at 25 cents retail, and these quickly proved successful. Sold at newsstands, stationery stores, 5-and-10-cent stores and similar retail outlets, coin boards were the point of entry for thousands of new coin collectors between 1935 and 1942, when most publishers discontinued them in favor of the more convenient coin folders still used today. Post marketed his coin boards under the brand name Kent Co. Coin Card, but later in 1935 he sold his invention to Whitman Publishing Company of Racine, Wisconsin, which was already a leading producer of puzzles, games and other paper novelties. Whitman became the most prolific of coin board producers and had the most extensive list of coin series titles.\n\nOther publishers of coin boards included Colonial Coin & Stamp Company and Gramercy Stamp Company, both located in New York City, J. Oberwise & Company and Lincoln Printing Company, both located in Los Angeles, California, and Earl & Koehler of Portland, Oregon. Whitman and Oberwise boards are seen with some frequency, but the other companies' boards are fairly scarce, those of Gramercy and E & K being genuinely rare. Coin collecting boards have been retired from their original usage for the most part, and all are now considered quite collectable. Their collector value varies with their relative rarity and condition.\n\nSource: Lange, David W., \"Coin Collecting Boards of the 1930s & 1940s A Complete History, Catalog and Value Guide\", Pennyboard Press, Florida, 2007.\n\nFor gaming coin boards:\n\nFor coin collecting boards:\n"}

The site itself folded in 2007 after a long history as a target for strategic lawsuits against public participation by companies.\n\nThe \"Rotten.com Dead Pool\", the largest in the world, uses NNDB as its source of qualified celebrities, and as arbiter of their life status. \n\nThe concept and success strategies are also detailed in a (previously) annual guide called \"The Dead Pool,\" written by KQRS-FM radio personality Mike Gelfand and author Mike Wilkinson. KQRS-FM in Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota also does an annual on air dead pool contest, where show hosts and listeners will attempt to pick which celebrity will die in that calendar year.\n\nIn his AP news article \"Some say death pools are in poor taste\" (which brought national attention to \"The Old Blue Eyes Celebrity Death Watch\"), author Matt Sedensky writes, \"Players scour newspapers and Web sites for news on celebrities' health; they rely on tips from insiders; and they consider a public figure's lifestyle, absence of recent appearances and rumors of illness\".\n\nA dead pool is a key plot element of the 1988 final installment of the \"Dirty Harry\" film series, \"The Dead Pool\". Harry investigates the players, when several people listed in a game of dead pool die in suspicious circumstances.\n\nThe Marvel Comics character Deadpool takes his name after escaping from Ajax and Dr. Killebrew, who formed their own dead pool based on which of their experimental subjects would die first. In the 2016 film \"Deadpool\", the character takes his name from a dead pool of mercenaries, himself included, who are regular patrons at his favorite bar.\n\nIn the MTV show \"Teen Wolf\", the main plotline of Season 4 revolves around a dead pool specifically targeting the supernaturals of Beacon Hills, which is set up by a mysterious character named The Benefactor.\n\n"}

Students are encouraged to wear jeans on a particular day to communicate their support of gay rights.\n\nThe organizers of Gay Jeans Day at CMU analyse the action in this way.\n\nDuring campus debates in the early 1990s about such Jeans Days, the Lesbian and Gay Alliance at Bowling Green State University published a letter to the local newspaper indicating that part of the logic of using a common piece of clothing such as jeans was to demonstrate that, when jeans indicated participation in affirming such rights, people would deliberately wear another form of clothing in tacit protest.\n\nMany supporters of the protest argued that the protest was effective because it forced heterosexuals to do something to actively engage in homophobia (wear something else that day), or wear their usual attire (blue jeans) and become possible targets of homophobia themselves, and that many people unaware of the\nprotest might wear blue jeans and be educated by becoming targets of homophobia\n\nOthers argue that the protest simply forces everyone to examine their own\npersonal relationship to homophobia by leaving no space to be uninterested.\n\nThe date and name of 'wear Blue Jeans if You're Gay Day' 'Jeans Day', 'Gay Jeans Day' etc. varies with place and time. BSC celebrates on October 11, the same day as National Coming Out Day. Other universities celebrate the day some time during Pride month (June) or on a day when many students will be on campus (e.g., the first day of the semester).\n\n\"Jeans Day\" began at Rutgers University in 1974.\n\n"}

Released in October 2011, it was the first game to have the \"Jane's\" title in over a decade. Unlike the previous games in the \"Jane's Combat Simulations\" line, \"JASF\" does not feature realistic gameplay and instead focuses more on arcade-style action.\n\nFor ten long years, the small island nation of Azbaristan has been rent by a disastrous civil war. Two factions of the government―the Northern People's Republic of Azbaristan and the Southern Azbaristan Democratic Front―have fought over resources and thousands have died in the struggle. When the cease-fire was negotiated, the North controlled everything except the Southern capital city of Talvade. Knowing that the North's fiery leader, Chairman Kropanin Borzai, could order his forces to resume the war at any moment, the SADF wasted no time in petitioning the Western Democratic Alliance in a desperate plea for support. In exchange for exclusive trade rights to South Azbaristan's vast oil and natural gas reserves, the WDA sent help in the form of military advisors and hardware.\n\nOne exceptional individual is a fighter pilot known only by his callsign, Razor, who served in the Second Gulf War and the War on Terror and has extensive experience in both air-to-air and air-to-ground operations with almost any fixed-wing combat aircraft. The skill and ability of this one pilot rivals that of an entire squadron, North or South, and can hold his own even when outnumbered ten to one.\n\nThere are fifteen combat aircraft of four profiles to choose from―ground attack, multirole, fighter and air superiority―each with two versions. They're divided by generation and range from classics like the F-4 Phantom II and MiG-21 Fishbed to the most advanced stealth aircraft like the F-22 Raptor and Su-50 PAK-FA, armed with a variety of air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions. Some are more specialized to one mission profile than others, with armament weighted toward that specialization, but all carry a cannon.\n\nWhen Trickstar Studios and Maximum Family Games announced the release of JASF, hopes were high for the game's reception. The air combat flight simulation craze was at its peak and games of the theme were experiencing record sales. The \"Ace Combat\" series was ultra-popular, the \"Blazing Angels\" were getting older but still maintaining a fan base among historical fiction nuts and Tom Clancy's \"HAWX\" games were on the rise. It was assumed that this one was destined to take its place in the air combat flight simulator community.\n\nThe game garnered a mixed reaction from the players, however. While the graphics were impressive, the game was plagued by a weak storyline, jumpy mechanics, a repetitive score, poor AI and some very frustrating rendering issues. It also lacked a choice mechanic, which applied rewards and consequences to choices the player made in-game. This made the experience very linear and locked players in a brain-melting \"same-darn-thing-every-time\" routine. With these shortcomings, the game experienced a brief life and met an abrupt end.\n\nReviews on aggregator Metacritic have been generally negative and below 50 points.\n"}

It is typically performed by one or two main performers, called Keertankar, accompanied by Harmonium and Tabla musicians. It involves singing, acting, dancing, and story-telling, However it is unlike any other performing art as it is basically pure glorification of god and godly acts. \n\nBased on the format and subjects, Keertan / Kirtan has been classified into several types, described in the sections below.\n\nIn Indian mythology the story of Bhakta Prahlad is famous for the uninterrupted devotion of a small child towards the almighty God, despite the obstacles created by his own father demon Hiranyakashipu. In the same \"Avatar katha\" child Prahlad the heavenly prince defines 9 types of \"Bhakti\" devotion. The relevant shloka\n\n<poem>\nShrawanam keertanam vishnoh smaranam padsevanam |\nArchanam vandanam dasyam sakhyam atmanivedanam ||\n</poem>\n\nMeaning -There are 9 types (stages) of \"Bhakti\" or ways of devotion.\n\nThe second type namely, \"Keertan or Kirtan\" as is called is performing art of presenting sayings from old good books and mythological literature along with a tint of music, dance, humor, etc. Due to scarce means of transport and communications, the performers called Keertankars use to travel a lot. Town to town and place to place over long periods and offer performances so as to enlighten the people. All over India this form of devotion is still live and prevalent in one form or another. All states have Keertans in Temples, Gurudwaras, mandirs and holy festival places too.\n\nKeertan is also called Hari Keertan, Katha or Harikatha, Sankirtan, Nam sankeertan, etc. Keertan carries a tradition as old as times of age old muni Narada the best devotee of lord Vishnu. Naradiya keertan follows a format that is named after Narada the sacred son of Brahmadev or lord Brahma\n\nor \"Naradiya Kirtan\" an age old form of devotion,admire of gods and godly acts,glorification of the almighty,and also a tool used by the performers to keep people updated on the world out of their towns and also to educate the masses about good values of life and very purpose of human life,thru a medium of \"ONE MAN SHOW\" consisting of prose and musical performance given at the temples and other holy places.\n\nIn this format Keertan is divided into 5 parts\n\nIt lasts for period of any length, ideally for half an hour to 3 hours at a stretch.\n\nThere are no hard and fast written rules,and different dress codes are prevalent in different geographic and social environments. However, by convention and as an age old practice and tradition, men wear\n\n\nThe performer has accomplishment of musical instruments like harmonium, drums and string instruments of various types mostly \"Zanz\",\"chipali\", \"Tal\" or \"Chimata\".Performer needs to study a lot of things in literature, music dance, humor and acting. He has to be a good orator and able debating artist. Usually the subjects are full of devotion, sacrifice, kindness, bravery, values of life, extinguishing ills of life, personal development of each individual physically and spiritually.\n\nA lot of reading, practice of debating, musical training, sound memory and all round knowledge only can make a good performer in Keertan. But after all,the main cause and purpose of Keertan is \"glorification of god and godly acts\"\n\nThe main institute for training is \"Keertan Kul\", with office situated at Sangli and the \"Shankaracharya of Karaveer Peeth \" as Chair person. There are some institutes offering the training in Keertan apart from individual schools and coaching classes in small towns all over India.\n\nMarathi Naradiya keertan is taught at the following locations in its formal traditional way:\n\nThere are also some smaller schools at Goa, Beed and Ujjain.\n\nThese are working as independent autonomous bodies. Different institutes offer education in different languages as suitable for the students and audiences around e.g. Institutes in Maharashtra prefer Marathi medium while those in Karnataka go for Kannada, Hindi is medium in U P and M.P,and Punjabi in Punjab and so on. Some have started training in various mediums including Hindi and English too along with the local language.\n\nNaradiya Keertan knows no boundaries.It accepts saying from great authors all over the world,if they suit their subject under consideration as to prove the principle or spiritual lessons.The training is also available by postal course also if one wants to do it at home as self studying,with outside guidance in literature and music.A good knowledge of \"Sanskrit\" the ancient language of India is essential for a best performer.Mostly it tells stories of old mythology and religious deeds of great lives including god and godly men.\n\nhaving taken inspiration from Indian freedom fighter Lokmanya Tilak, a medical practitioner from a small town of Wai- district Satara shri Dattopant Patwardhan, left his profession and became the pioneer of this form of Naradiya Keertan . He started this new era of Rashtriya keertan. he used the format of Naradiya keertan to teach masses and make awareness amongst them about the struggle for freedom against the British regime.He used many mythological stories from great epics which gave the message to masses and encouraged the movement for liberty.\nIn modern times, stories of great scientists, warriors, freedom fighters and social reformers National leaders,battles fought, etc.are conveniently selected to entertain and educate the masses.So, Naradiya keertan is still a popular tool of mass education .It serves today as an art of spiritual training through entertainment.It is devotion with added stint of an art.\n\nThis form was named after Samarth Ramdas. Here the format is like Naradiya Keertan, only difference is it is based on poetry by Samarth Ramdas, and mostly the stories selected are from \"Ramayana\". In between chanting is also dedicated to lord Ram, glorifying his deeds and bravery. In his world known book \"Dasbodh\", Samarth Ramdas has explained in detail how a keertan should be performed effectively.\n\nVarkari Keertan was pioneered by Sant Namdev around 900 years back in Maharashtra. It is usually based on poetry of 7 famous saints of Maharashtra namely, Saint Nivruttinath, Sant Dnyaneshwar, Sopandev, Muktabai, saint Eknath, Saint Namdev, and Saint Tukaram maharaj. Sometimes other sayings of saints are chosen.\n\nThe show goes for 2 or 3 hours as time permits and is not divided into parts like \"Naradiya Keertan\". This form was effectively performed for years by personalities like \"Hari Bhakti Parayan\" (sincere devotee of god) Sonopant (mama) Dandekar, Dhunda maharaj Deglurkar, Babamaharaj Satarkar, Dekhanebuwa, and many others in modern times. An institute at Alandi near Pune offers training in this form of Keertan.\n\nThis format is just like Naradiya Keertan. It was most evolved form that is performed by two persons together. The philosophy is presented from all angles, sometimes contradicting each other. The performance is more interesting as it goes in question-Answer form, sometimes creating a dialogue with audiences also. Finally both the performers come to a conclusion that gives some spiritual lesson for the listeners.\n"}

The track features rappers , Rick Ross, Nicki Minaj, and singer Justin Vernon of indie folk group Bon Iver. All five credited performers have writing credits on the posse cut, with the production handled by West and Mike Dean. Lyrically, the song expresses often disturbing, horror film influenced concepts, with some comparing the track's eerie aesthetic to the Michael Jackson song \"Thriller\". The song contains an atmospheric, drum-heavy composition, notable for featuring no samples.\n\nOriginally released through West's GOOD Friday initiative, a weekly free music giveaway started by the rapper to promote \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\", the song was later confirmed to be featured on the album, and was released as a digital download on October 23. The song was listed amongst the best tracks of 2010 by publications, with \"NME\" placing it at number 53 on its list of the \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\".\n\nThe song debuted and peaked on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at position 18. The track was promoted with a music video directed by Jake Nava. The music video had several references to horror films and featured extensive horror imagery, with zombies, decapitated corpses and heavily atmospheric cinematography. The music video was widely controversial, being banned from MTV. The video has been criticized for its portrayal of women, and the content of the video was described as weird and disturbing in nature.\n\nTo promote his upcoming fifth album, West launched GOOD Fridays, a weekly free music giveaway. The intention was to release a free new song every Friday for a few months, and the weekly tracks generally featured various rappers from his label, GOOD Music, and other artists he usually collaborated with. In the first week West released onto his website a remix of the album's first single, \"Power\", and \"Monster\" was released on the second week. The song was promptly removed from his website and replaced with another track, with \"Monster\" being uploaded as a digital single onto iTunes. West announced that \"Monster\" was actually intended for his collaborative album \"Watch the Throne\" with Jay-Z. West's announcement failed to surface however, and the song actually appeared on \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\" and was released as the album's third single.\n\nFollowing some media controversies, West chose to record his fifth studio \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\" in a reclusive manner in Oahu, Hawaii. Like the majority of the album, \"Monster\" was composed there. Rapper Rick Ross was invited to Hawaii to work with West, because West was set to produce the song \"Live Fast, Die Young\", which appeared on \"Teflon Don\", an album by Ross. While Ross was there with West in his recording studio, he actually walked in on West while recording another song. Ross was not initially intended to be featured on West's album, however Ross was so impressed with what he heard he decided to record a quick, though short verse.\n\nRoss had the concept of the song explained to him by West, which according to Ross, blew him away in presentation. West was so impressed by Ross that he invited him back to his studio during the final stages of the album, where he also appeared on \"Devil in a New Dress\". While Ross was there, both Jay-Z and Minaj were recording their verses. Ross expressed his admiration for Minaj, who impressed him during the recording. He stated that what he had observed had earned him respect for Minaj, who called the recording process a \"moment of history\".\n\nMinaj expressed excitement when approached to collaborate on the song, and she had contributed 32 bars to the track. Her main inspiration behind working on the track was the possibility of meeting Jay-Z, with whom she was obsessed since a young age. According to her, she literally couldn't have a conversation without quoting a line by him, and it was a dream come true to collaborate with the artist. Minaj had recorded her lines around four months before the lyrics finally appeared on the song. Minaj described both Jay-Z and West as \"icons\", and stated that she was blessed to be working with them. In an interview with Rap-Up, Minaj mused \"never in a billion years would've thought that I would've not only been on a song with one of them but both them\".\n\nJustin Vernon's involvement on the song stemmed from being approached by West directly. West first got into contact with Vernon when he directly phoned him, with the intention of sampling his song \"Woods\". The two talked on the phone for about 40 minutes, where West explained some of the concepts for the project, and invited him down to his studio in Hawaii. West is a big admirer of Bon Iver's album \"For Emma, Forever Ago\", and was impressed with Vernon's unique use of auto-tune. The two artists became friends while playing games of basketball together, and West introduced him to Jeff Bhasker, one of his main producers.\n\nVernon was sampled on another song from the album, \"Lost in the World\" and appears on vocals on \"Monster\". While there during recording sessions, he had reportedly recorded 10 tracks. He watched Minaj record her verse, and he too, expressed admiration for Minaj's performance on the song, however he noted that initially he had no idea who she was. Vernon described the process as highly artistic, stating that the fourteen-hour day recording schedule allowed for a lot of fun and creativity. West, talking about recording the song with Vernon, stated that he was \"similar to me, where he just does shit just so people would be like, 'Oh shit, how did you do that? How did that happen?' He's just a really cool guy to be around.\"\n\nConsidered a horrorcore song, \"Monster\" has been described as brooding, disturbing, creepy and the \"weirdest A-list event-rap posse cut in recent memory.\" The song begins with an ominous, distorted vocal roar, sung by Justin Vernon of Bon Iver, with Vernon declaring \"I shoot the lights out\", which sets up the dark atmosphere of the track. The intro of the song is followed by a brief verse given by Ross, delivered in the rapping style of boom bap. In a deep voice, Ross asserts the lines \"bitch, I'm a monster, no good bloodsucker, fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble,\" over the eerie production featured during the beginning. Following the introduction by Ross, West then provides the song's hook, singing \"everybody know / I'm a motherfuckin' monster\" in a heavily distorted manner. West then launches into a full verse. \"Chicago Sun-Times\" writer Thomas Conner stated that West rhyming \"esophagus\" with \"sarcophagus\" was surely a hip-hop first.\n\nJay-Z appears on the song after West's verse, and raps in a more forceful, sinister flow. During his verse, Jay-Z references several different horror characters, including the Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, the Loch Ness Monster, goblins, ghouls and zombies. Lyrically Jay-Z discusses his discontent at former associates, and concludes his verse by admitting that his achilles' heel is \"love\". Minaj is the final rapper to appear on the song, who delivers her lines in an urgent, energetic manner. Minaj's delivery has been described as surreal, changing delivery in mid-line. The song ends in a spooky, hoarse vocal riff delivered by Vernon, reminiscent of the track \"Thriller\". An extended vocal riff, described as \"scratchy\" closes the track. \"Pitchfork\"'s Tom Breihan summarized the content of the song, writing:\nRick Ross drops by to say hi, keeping his appearance so brief that I can't help but wonder what he's even doing here. Justin Vernon inexplicably bookends the thing, pushing his falsetto into Antony range on the outro and muttering befuddling lyrics that have nothing to do with the rest of the song. All this over the straight-up funkiest beat Kanye West has made in years, a rippling electro push-pull that adds an effortless strut to his recent progged-out chilliness. But all that other stuff fades into the background when Nicki Minaj shows up. [...] She's a whirlwind of energy, showing her full repertoire of nutso voices and kicking the living fuck out of the beat, sounding like she's having an absolute blast the whole time.\"\n\nThe song heavily features bombastic tribal drums, and paranoia-inducing strings that create a feeling of tension. The beat of \"Monster\" has been described as a \"hyperventilating death rattle\" by \"The Washington Post\"s Chris Richards, commenting that the song was permeated with dark, urgent-sounding moans. The chorus of the song has two separate meanings; on the surface, it appears that West is bragging about his abilities as a rapper, while also making a comment on the media's reception of him, with lines like \"gossip, gossip, nigga just stop it, everybody knows I'm a muthafuckin' monster\".\n\nBecky Bain of Idolator stated that while the song featured five distinct artists, Minaj actually had the brightest appearance on the song. Sara D. Anderson of AOL gave the song a positive review, complimenting each artist on their contribution. Chris Ryan of \"MTV\" positively reviewed West, Jay-Z and Minaj as the stand out rappers in the song, stating \"on car stereos, computers and in clubs all over, nothing got more burn than 'Monster,' his new beastly posse cut. Kanye spits about his presence being a present to us all, Jay-Z comes through with what might be his strongest verse in years, and that's where Nicki comes in, more than holding her own against the bad boys.\" Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal reported that Minaj gave the verse of her life, and applauded the contributions by Ross, who added a \"hallucinatory tone\" to the song. Another Pitchfork writer, Tom Breihan mused that the track contained the \"straight-up funkiest beat\" West has made in years, while commenting that Minaj was the best in show.\n\n\"The Village Voice\"s Sean Fennessey commented that \"Monster\" was the track that announced Minaj's \"brilliance\" to most people, stating that when the posse cut \"crept up the Hot 100, the song became more than track six—it became an essential part of this album's story, delivered months early.\" Alex Denney of \"NME\" mused that the track \"proves a riotous bit of respite\" and features West \"sending up his rep with a self-mocking diatribe about drowning his pain in a blizzard of blow jobs and mass adulation while Nicki Minaj sets the dials to 'ridiculous' with a fire-breathing, raga-inflected verse.\" Embling of Tiny Mix Tapes felt that with \"super-sized cipher cuts\" like \"Monster\" and \"So Appalled\", West balanced out some of the darker moments of \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\", and that the song contained heavy \"shit-talking.\" Slant Magazine's Cole Matthew also commented that posse cuts \"Monster\" and \"So Appalled\" were amongst the hardest tracks ever produced by West.\n\nIGN's Chad Grischow mused that the track featured great guest appearances from Jay-Z and Minaj, going as far as saying that Minaj's performance \"clears up what all the hype is about for anyone still unsure\". Robert Christgau of MSN Music stated that West perfectly acknowledged his status as a rapper, and noted that his persona seems to be aware that his \"bling-and-sex brag is about to get blown away by padrone Jay-Z's 'all I see is these niggaz I made millionaires/Millin about' and pink-haired Nicki Minaj's 'bitch from Sri Lanka-Willy Wonka-watch the queen conquer' trifecta.\" David Amidon of PopMatters praised the production of the song, and stated that the track features \"glass-shattering bass\". Nitsuh Abebe of \"New York\" declared that Minaj gave one of the best verses of the year.\n\nNathan Rabin of \"The A.V. Club\" praised the guest picks on the album, musing that West trades verses with the \"few superstars fit to breathe his rarified air, including Jay-Z, Rick Ross, and Nicki Minaj, who single-handedly justifies her deafening buzz with her verse on the song.\" Kitty Empire of \"The Guardian\" praised West's performance on the song describing it as \"brilliant\", but also noted that on the particular song Minaj and Jay-Z were superior to him, citing Minaj's verse as her career's best. Dan Vidal of \"URB\" stated that West milks the potential of his guest rappers to the most impressive degree, reporting that Jay-Z's generally relaxed performance was \"with a fiery growl on\" and that it \"features Nicki Minaj going even more bonkers with her flow than we're accustomed to.\" Sputnikmusic's Channing Freeman echoed the consensus about Minaj stating that her verse was the most memorable part of the song, though felt that Bon Iver's appearance didn't add up to much.\n\nThe song was named the \"Collaboration of the Year\" 2010 by HipHopDX. Minaj's verse for the song was named \"Verse of the Year\" by the same website. \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it number 10 on its list of the Best Singles of 2010. Rap-Up declared the song the third best of 2010. MTV News declared the track the 14th best of the year, with other West singles \"Power\" and \"Runaway\" making the top 10. In October 2011, \"NME\" placed it at number 53 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\", with the site's staff stating that while West had a good performance on the song, it was \"star turns from Jay-Z (channeling his world-weary hip hop legend who just needed a cuddle) and Nicki Minaj (a show stealing turn from the heir apparent who was battling herself as much as the haters) that took this track over.\" In 2013, Complex Magazine gave Minaj's Monster verse the title \"Best Rap Verse of the Past 5 Years\". In January 2011, \"The Village Voice\"s Pazz & Jop annual critics' poll named \"Monster\" the sixth-best single of 2010; West's other singles \"Power\" and \"Runaway\" were ranked at numbers five and four, respectively on the same poll, with their parent album \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\" ranked the best album of 2010 as well. It was ranked at number 69 by \"Rolling Stone\" on their list of \"100 Greatest Hip-Hop songs of all time\".\n\n\"Monster\" was sent to radio on September 21, and it was released to the iTunes Store on October 23, 2010 around Halloween. It spent five weeks on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, peaking at number 18 on the chart. The song also appeared within the top 30 on both the \"Billboard\" Hot Rap Songs and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. The song also appeared on the UK Singles Chart at position 146. \"Monster\" was certified platinum on March 31, 2014.\n\nThe song was performed at Jay-Z's and Eminem's \"Home & Home\" concert in the new Yankee Stadium, during Jay-Z's portion of the performance. Both Minaj and West joined Jay-Z at the concert and performed the song together as a group, though Ross was absent. After joining Jay-Z during the performance, West remained on stage and performed his own singles, including the remixed version of \"Power\", \"Can't Tell Me Nothing\" and \"Good Life\". West wore exactly the same outfit he did for his 2010 MTV Video Music Awards performance and his subsequent \"Saturday Night Live\" performance; a red suit accessorized with his gold Egyptian god Horus necklace and red Louis Vuitton shoes. During a live performance in New York City, West joined Ross and performed \"Devil in a New Dress\" and \"Monster\".\n\nMinaj performed the song live at Britney Spears' Femme Fatale Tour as one of the final songs in her setlist. On one occasion, West performed the track alongside Minaj on the tour, on August 2, 2011 at the Nassau Coliseum in Long Island, New York, as a surprise guest. During his set at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, West performed \"Monster\" during the first half of his setlist. The performance was accompanied by Vernon who provided his vocal hook on the song. West's performance was described as \"one of the most memorable performances in Coachella history.\" The song was performed by West and Jay-Z during their Watch the Throne Tour. Minaj has also performed her verse on the European and American legs of her debut concert tour, the Pink Friday Tour. She has also rapped her verse on her .\n\nAn unfinished version of a music video, directed by Jake Nava leaked online before the official release on December 30, 2010. West was annoyed at the leak of the video, and nearly shelved the video altogether. A finalized version of the video was officially released on June 4, 2011 on West's official website. A promotional trailer for the music video was released online. When released, the video came with a disclaimer, stating \"the following content is in no way to be interpreted as misogynistic or negative towards any groups of people. It is an art piece and it shall be taken as such.\"\n\nThe music video is inspired by horror films and extensively features gothic and horror related imagery, including references to \"Michael Jackson's Thriller\". The video features references to horror cult films such as \"American Psycho\" and \"Saw\" as well as the supposedly haunted painting \"The Hands Resist Him\". \"The Hand Resists Him\" is a painting created by artist Bill Stoneham in 1972, depicting a young boy and female doll standing in front of a glass paneled door against which many hands are pressed. The painting became famous for apparently being haunted. The painting is referenced during a scene in the video where West attempts to hold a door closed, from the monsters outside attempting to enter. The video features mostly naked corpse looking models, some of which are decapitated. West's role in the video is similar to Doctor Frankenstein, with the video set in a castle. Jay-Z appears in the video dressed in a tuxedo, standing in front of a nude corpse in a darkly-lit library. The video contains two versions of Minaj; a vampire version who is dressed in a gothic inspired outfit (representing her alter ego Roman Zolanski), and a pink-haired version (representing her alter ego Barbie) which the other half tortures during the video. Zombies also appear in the video, with hanging corpses and blood-splattered furniture.\n\nHitFix's Melinda Newman called the video both \"chilling\" and \"raw\" and stated that the video captured the concept of the song well, expressing that it was a \"brutal reveal of West's psyche\". Simon Vozick-Levinson of \"Entertainment Weekly\" stated that the video should have been more creative and called it offensive, stating that Minaj's appearance was the best part. Matthew Perpetua of \"Rolling Stone\" commented that the video was morbid, comparing it to \"Thriller\", though noted that \"instead of dancing zombies, he gives us undead, barely dressed and occasionally dismembered models\". Perpetua called Minaj's appearance \"cameo of the year\" describing her appearance in the video:\n\n\"She switches up her delivery repeatedly over the course of 31 bars, veering between cartoonish sweetness and unhinged villainy. She dramatizes the jarring dynamic shifts in the clip by appearing as a fanged dominatrix torturing a far more innocent version of herself in a neon pink wig and frilly white dress. It's a brilliant visual take on a breathtakingly badass verse, but really, they could've just focused in on her incredible facial expressions and called it a day. She's just that entertaining to watch.\" \n\nThe music video for Monster was widely controversial, being banned on MTV. Ta-Nehisi Coates of \"The Atlantic\" questioned \"what would have become of John Mayer, had he cut a video with dead black women strewn about and invoked black women throughout his lyrics in the manner Kanye does\" and labeled the video both racist and sexist in nature. However, Brandon Soderberg of \"Spin\" argues that the video was simply a \"surreal response to hip-hop misogyny\" and a \"knowing provocation\", and commented that the video was in fact inspired by horror films.\n\nDaphne Bramham of the \"Vancouver Sun\" commented that \"what's entertaining about women in lingerie hanging by their necks on chains? What's artful about images of drugged, unconscious women about to be sexually assaulted?\" Mikhail Lyubansky of the \"Huffington Post\" had a negative opinion of the video, stating that the video \"not-so-subtly suggests that complete female passivity, lifelessness, and even death are erotic\", and interpreted the message of the video as being that \"for women, what's sexually desirable is passivity, lifelessness, and death.\" The release of the video was received by American activist Ann Simonton with an internet petition seeking the preemptive removal of the full video from broadcast or promotion, criticizing the video as glorifying sexual violence against women.\n\nDue to negative reactions the video was removed from Kanye West's YouTube channel. It is unknown if it violated YouTube's policy against showing gory content or if Vevo took it down. However, the video is available on Nicki Minaj's YouTube channel.\n\nMinaj's verse has become so iconic and acclaimed that artists like Demi Lovato, Chloë Grace Moretz, Ed Sheeran, Troye Sivan, Millie Bobby Brown, among others, have rapped the verse in concerts or interviews.\n\nIn January 2016, singer Adele rapped Nicki Minaj's verse on \"The Late Late Show with James Corden\" during a segment called \"Carpool Karaoke\", which Minaj reacted to with praise. British actress Millie Bobby Brown rapped the same verse while on \"The Tonight Show\" with Jimmy Fallon in September 2016.\nSinger/Songwriter Ed Sheeran attempted to rap the verse on The Breakfast Club which was published on March 10, 2017 on the show's YouTube channel, but forgot the words to it.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3275684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3275684", "title": "Nicolas Economou", "text": "Nicolas Economou\n\nNicolas Economou (; 11 August 1953 – 29 December 1993) was a Cypriot composer and pianist born in Nicosia, Cyprus.\n\nA precociously gifted pianist, Economou came to international attention at the 1969 Tchaikovsky Competition when he was 16. After studying at the Tchaikovsky Conservatory in Moscow he eventually moved via Düsseldorf to Munich. From his base there he established himself throughout Europe as a concert pianist, composer, arranger, conductor and organiser of music festivals. In December 1993 Economou was killed in an automobile accident in Cyprus while driving at night in thick fog.\n\nNicolas Economou was the first child of his family. His parents, who loved classical music, decided to expose him to music as a creative outlet rather than a career. At the age of five, he started taking piano lessons and he soon revealed his extraordinary talent by improvising on the piano and composing short pieces of music. When Solon Michaelides, the celebrated Cypriot composer, conductor, musicologist and friend of the family heard him play for the first time, when Economou was not yet seven years old, he declared: \"This child is a blessing to his parents, Cyprus, and the World\". On his advice, Economou's musical training was undertaken by George Arvanitakis.\n\nThe turning point in Economou's life came at the age of ten. It had to be decided whether he would eventually take up music as a career. Again Solon Michaelides, who was following Economou's progress, suggested that his musical education should be continued outside Cyprus where he would have greater opportunities. In September 1964, after an audition, he was accepted at the Special School of Music of the Tchaikovsky Conservatory in Moscow, a preparatory school for youngsters to enter the Conservatory. In December of that year, in Athens, he won the \"Keti Papaioannou\" Panhellenic Competition for young musicians up to the age of seventeen. Events themselves were now forming the course of Economou's life. The following year at the age of twelve, far away from his family and culture, he began his musical studies in Moscow.\n\nAfter three years of studies, his piano teacher suggested that he should enter the Tchaikovsky Competition, a world-renowned international music competition. After a year of preparation and at the age of sixteen, he participated in the competition, gaining favourable reviews from the press, radio and television. A year later, he was admitted to the Tchaikovsky Conservatory itself. Leaving Moscow in 1972, he moved to Düsseldorf, before settling in Munich, Germany.\n\nAs a performer, he appeared in Europe, the USA and Canada as well as the USSR, Japan, Iceland, and Israel. He performed solo, and with orchestras and other famous performers and composers like Martha Argerich, Rodion Shchedrin, Sviatoslav Richter, Michel Beroff, Chick Corea and others. As well as performing in concert with Martha Argerich and Chick Corea, he also recorded with them. The record with Chick Corea, entitled \"On Two Pianos\", was the result of a series of concerts in Germany in 1981/82 during which the two musicians interacted with each other by improvising in their own style. He also released two other solo albums.\n\nThe Nicolas Economou Foundation posthumously published seven CDs under the series title \"L'Art de Nicolas Economou\", compiling hours of recordings that Economou left behind.\n\nEconomou studied composition with Vladislav Zolotaryov and Wilhelm Killmayer. He wrote music for piano, for small ensembles, symphonic music and film music. Many of his compositions have themes and rhythms from Cyprus and the Mediterranean. Some of his compositions are: \"Children Studies\", \"Sonata for Chick\" (dedicated to Chick Corea) for piano, \"Cyprus Picture\" and \"Cyprus Dances\" for an ensemble of eight players. He wrote the soundtracks for twelve films including \"Rosa Luxemburg\" and \"Die bleierne Zeit\", both by Margarethe von Trotta.\n\nEconomou also arranged Tchaikovsky's \"The Nutcracker Suite\" (originally written for orchestra) for two pianos, dedicated to his daughter and Martha Argerich's daughter. Performers and critics alike have praised this arrangement, since all the musical colours portrayed by the orchestra are very well conveyed by two pianos. Economou also arranged Vivaldi's \"The Four Seasons\" for four pianos.\n\nIn 1978, with the collaboration of the City of Munich, Economou organised a \"Cyprus Week\" in Munich, with artists from Cyprus including actors, musicians, painters, sculptors and the late shadow performer, Paphios. He was also the founder of the \"Solisten Ensemble\" in Munich with which he performed some of his compositions and those of other composers. He was the co-founder of the well-established Münchner Klaviersommer (Munich Piano Summer). In February 1992 he organised in Venice the first of a series of piano festivals he intended to establish in Europe with the title \"Pianisti non-Solo\".\n\nAs a conductor he directed the distinguished Moscow Chamber Orchestra, the Bavarian Symphony Orchestra, Germany's Youth Orchestra and the La Fenice Opera Orchestra of Venice.\n\nIn acknowledgement of his services and contribution to culture and the arts in general, Economou was honoured on various occasions by several bodies.\n\nEconomou was a thinker and expressed many of this thoughts and ideas in literary work, poetry and prose. He was a citizen of the World and refused to accept borders, either in the geographical sense, in artistic expression or ideas.\n\nHe had many well-known friends, not only musicians but also persons coming from a variety of intellectual backgrounds. Among them as the late philosopher and playwright Friedrich Dürrenmatt, with whom he had a special bond. Others include Arthur Miller and his family, Rodion Shchedrin and the legendary Maja Plisestkaya, Maximilian and Maria Schell, Volker Schlondorff and Margarethe von Trotta. In Greece he had close ties with the late Solon Michaelides and Manos Hadjidakis.\n\nEven though he spent almost all of his life far away from his birthplace, deep inside he remained a Cypriot with all the characteristics of the Mediterranean people. He never lost touch with the island and during his visits to Cyprus he used to mix with all kinds of people, regardless of their background. He greatly enjoyed discussing politics and would eagerly prompt discussions on life and philosophical issues. He was always frank and direct and had no inhibitions in expressing an opinion, and for this he was very much respected.\n\nNicolas Economou is the father of Semeli Economou from his first marriage to Greek-American born Maritsa Tsirigos.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23597331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23597331", "title": "Nintendo Campus Challenge", "text": "Nintendo Campus Challenge\n\nNintendo Campus Challenge was a video game competition sponsored by Nintendo and held at nearly 60 college campuses and other events throughout the United States, including a Canadian Tour. There were two Campus Challenge events, one in 1991 and another in 1992.\n\nLike Nintendo World Championships, the official event gave each player 6 minutes and 21 seconds to play in the contest, but there are three different minigames. The first minigame of the competition is \"Super Mario Bros. 3\", where players must collect 25 coins. The next minigame is a version of \"Pin*Bot\"\",\" where players must get 100,000 points. The final minigame is \"Dr. Mario\", which lasts until the time expires. Once time expires, a player's score is totaled using the following formula:\n\nThe following advertisement was printed in Game Players Strategy Guide to Nintendo Games Vol. 4, issue #5:\n\n\"Ok, you should really be studying for that calculus test next week. And there's a paper due in English Lit. But who cares? The Nintendo Camps Challenge is coming! Nintendo of America is following up its hugely successful Nintendo World Champions with its first Nintendo Campus Challenge. During the next year, competitions will be held at 50 universities and popular spring break gatherings throughout the U.S. One lucky student will become the 'college valedictorian of videogames.' Contestants will play a special combination of three Nintendo games - Dr. Mario, Rad Racer, and Super Mario Bros. 3. There are categories for both men and women, and all finalists receive round-trip airfare to the January 1992 championship. Prizes include new cars and cash scholarships. Meanwhile, don't let those grades slide too badly.\" \n\n\"Rad Racer\" was not used in the final version of the competition cartridge, as it had previously appeared on the Nintendo World Championships cartridge and that both games used a different mapper chip than what the 1991 Nintendo Campus Challenge uses.\n\nThere is only one known original copy of the 1991 Campus Challenge cartridge known to exist. The game was found by a video game collector, Rob Walters, at a garage sale in New York in 2006. The game sold for $14,000 in July 2009 to collector JJ Hendricks. After 3 months, Hendricks resold the game on eBay for $20,100.\n\nThe Nintendo Campus Challenge 1991 was held at 58 college campuses and spring break locations. The event consisted of three stages. The main stage had the competition on 12 different game stations. The second stage was Nintendo Entertainment System systems with various games while the third stage had Game Boy systems. Attendees at the events could play as many times as they wanted and the highest score at the end of the day was announced the winner.\n\nThe winner from each location was flown to Disney World in Orlando, Florida over New Year's weekend in January 1992. All the competitors played in the first round followed by a second round with the six highest scoring players only. The final round was a head-to-head match between Steven Lucas and Matt Sekelsky. Steven Lucas won with a score of 2,394,130.\n\nThe SNES Campus Challenge cart has an unusual shape, with the PCB board parallel to the SNES. The cart has four ROM chips, presumably three for each game plus the additional one to link them all together. It also has the DSP-1 chip, which is used in \"Pilotwings\". There is a set of eight switches, which were likely used to change the settings in the game, although they seemed to have no effect when changed. A phone jack is present, likely to relay the scores to a Nintendo server to determine the grand prize winner.\n\nThe rules are the same as the 1991 version, except with three SNES minigames. The first minigame of the competition is \"Super Mario World\", where players must collect 50 coins (very similar to Nintendo World Championships' first minigame, \"Super Mario Bros.\"). The second game is a version of \"F-Zero,\" where players must complete two laps. The final minigame is \"Pilotwings,\" where players must land on two targets successfully. Once time expires, a player's score is totaled using the following formula:\n\n\nThere are reportedly three cartridges in existence, but only two known are known. One was found at the same New York City garage sale by Rob Walters as the 1991 cartridge. The cartridge is owned by a video game collector named Rick Bruns. The second one was found in an attic of a former employee of a company who did projects for Nintendo. Nintendo sent the cartridge to the company along with some systems and other games.\n\nThe 1992 \"Nintendo Campus Challenge\" competition was held at 35 college campuses throughout the US, including Central Michigan University, Arizona State University, and Texas A&M University. The winner at each location won a Super NES Super Set with two controllers and a \"Super Mario World\" game cartridge, along with individual copies of \" F-Zero\", and \"Pilotwings\". Consolation prizes of $100, $75, and $50 were awarded to second, third, and fourth place contestants. The winner of the whole US competition won $10,000. In addition, all the winners were put into a draw to win prizes of $5,000. Along with the competition cartridge, Nintendo sent previews for new games, including \"\", \"Rival Turf\",\" \", \"The Addams Family\", and \"Super Scope 6\".\n\nSimilar competitions were held in Europe and Japan in 1992. The winner of the US competition, Jeff Hanson, won against the winner of the Japanese competition, Yuichi Suyama, and became the World Champion at the 1993 Consumer Electronics Show.\n\n"}

Support began to dwindle upon Reigns's transition to a heroic main event singles act in 2014, largely due to his perceived forced push. This would manifest itself with Reigns main eventing consecutive WrestleManias (WWE's premier annual pay-per-view event) facing Brock Lesnar in a singles turned triple threat match due to Seth Rollins’ Money in the Bank cash-in for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 31, Triple H in a singles match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 32, The Undertaker in a No Holds Barred match at WrestleMania 33 and Brock Lesnar for the second time one-on-one in a singles match for the WWE Universal Championship at WrestleMania 34 while being booed in all four main events. He has also won the WWE World Heavyweight Championship three times, having a \"mixed, at best\" crowd reaction on his first world title win, being cheered for his second and being completely booed for his third, but cheered for his first WWE Universal Championship win at SummerSlam in August 2018.\n\nWrestling journalists have offered both praise and criticism for Reigns, noting both his talent and WWE's apparent attempts to conceal fan hostility towards him. David Shoemaker of \"Grantland\" wrote in 2016 that Reigns was the company's \"most despised wrestler\" in over 25 years. Fans have taken issue with Reigns over various reasons: his perceived special treatment, real-life demeanor, wrestling moveset, speaking skills and character presentation. After Reigns was suspended for drug use, Yahoo! Sports pondered whether he is \"the biggest failure in professional wrestling history\". In 2016, Reigns was voted the Most Overrated by \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" readers as well as the Most Hated Wrestler of the Year by \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" readers, a first for a heroic character since the award was devised in 1972. Into 2017, WWE continued trying to establish Reigns as a megastar despite audience rejection. \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" critics, including editor Wade Keller, have said that company chairman Vince McMahon is engaged in a \"war on fans\".\n\nAnoaʻi himself has suggested that there is \"possible jealousy\" from fans over his \"major success\", mocked those who question if he deserves his fictional role, discounted critiques from anyone who \"weren't wrestlers\" and declared that he will not change to appease his critics. To remedy the negative reception, Anoa'i has stated that he will \"continue to show up\" and that his and WWE's approach is for him to \"go out there and work hard\". Anoa'i's childhood idol Bret Hart stated that he believes WWE themselves have \"ruined\" the Reigns character by utilizing bad storytelling and poor writing and blames the company's leaders primarily for Anoa'i failing to reach his potential.\n\nWhile in NXT (the new developmental system) during 2012, Reigns' character was described as a \"businessman\" who was \"always dressed to impress\" and viewed himself as \"the most valuable commodity in WWE\".\n\nReigns debuted to the main roster as part of The Shield in November 18, 2012 at Survivor Series. After transferring to WWE's main roster, his character was changed to the \"powerhouse\" and \"heavy hitter\" of The Shield, as well as an \"exceptional athlete\". Noted as the least talkative of The Shield members, Reigns' character was tweaked from \"the quiet muscle\" to being an \"ultra-confident\" source of leadership with \"quiet strength\" in mid-2013. CM Punk alleged in an interview that he was constantly reminded to make Reigns look \"really, really strong\" despite The Shield being booked to lose to Punk at the 2013 event. In 2013, Reigns was voted the Most Improved by \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" readers.\n\nDuring the 2014 Royal Rumble match on January 26, the live crowd cheered for Reigns over eventual winner Batista despite Reigns being a villain. Anoaʻi later acknowledged the reaction as \"a cool situation\". In mid-2014, Stone Cold Steve Austin said he saw great potential in Reigns while David Shoemaker of \"Grantland\" wrote that Reigns had \"mystery and intensity\" as well as \"superstar written all over him\".\n\nAfter The Shield disbanded, Reigns (unlike the other former Shield members) retained much of The Shield's aesthetic including ring attire, a remixed version of the group's theme music and ring entrance. Initially, Roman was one of the most popular stars on the roster with fans. From December 2014 to January 2015, Reigns' positive crowd reactions were diminishing. Reigns' win of WWE's 2014 Superstar of the Year Slammy Award garnered surprise to the point of accusations of vote-rigging, although both Dave Meltzer and \"Pro Wrestling Insider\" allege the fan vote was legitimate. Writers from the \"Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter\" criticized Reigns in 2014 and 2015, for a \"very limited\" in-ring moveset, \"forced promo delivery\" and a \"petulant and annoyed\" attitude ill-befitting of a top fan favorite. Fellow professional wrestler Mikey Whipwreck said Reigns was \"trying to be like John Cena\", who was \"very polarizing\".\n\nAt the 2015 Royal Rumble on January 25, Reigns was booed heavily after his victory despite portraying a heroic character. In February on \"WWE Raw\", Paul Heyman praised Reigns as better than \"any other guy in history\", which garnered negative reactions as Heyman stated esteemed wrestling figures, including Bruno Sammartino, Hulk Hogan, Andre the Giant, Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock and John Cena, were inferior to Reigns. By March, Anoaʻi altered his character's physical appearance by wearing contact lenses in order to have blue eyes. From late 2014 to early 2015, various critics raised concerns that Reigns, despite being \"not fully ready\", was \"being pushed too hard, too soon\" while WWE tried to make him their next \"flagship star\", \"no matter how fans reacted\". Anoaʻi reacted by saying that he only entertained criticism of his wrestling by people that were involved with wrestling, discounting negative opinion by critics that \"weren't wrestlers\" and who wouldn't understand how to \"lock up\". Going into WrestleMania in 2015, Anoaʻi declared WWE as \"my ship now, I'm the captain here\", while Dave Meltzer said that Reigns was the least over WrestleMania main eventer ever. At WrestleMania 31 on March 29, \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" described Reigns as needing security for his entrance while receiving \"universal boos\" and middle fingers. Reigns was unable to defeat Brock Lesnar for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship after Seth Rollins cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and pinned Reigns to win the world title. Rollins received positive reactions for his victory despite being a villain. Despite the fan backlash in early 2015, critics praised Reigns' performances at Fastlane, WrestleMania 31 and Extreme Rules as exceeding expectations while the negative reactions continued at Money in the Bank and SummerSlam.\nIn late 2015, critics described WWE presenting Reigns' character as a \"hard-luck underdog\" chasing the world title, with WWE having \"spent an overwhelming amount of time\" on Reigns, \"bending over backwards to create new obstacles for him to overcome [...] at the expense of almost everyone else on the roster\". In November 2015, Reigns received a “mixed, at best” reaction upon winning and losing his first WWE World Heavyweight Championship at the 2015 Survivor Series event after Sheamus, another villainous character, cashed in his Money in the Bank contract to defeat Reigns, a move made to try and get Reigns over with the crowd, and a positive reaction on winning his second world title at the \"Raw\" after on December 14, although a \"WrestleView\" writer reflected that \"it's been downhill ever since\" for Reigns from then until March 2016. In 2015 and 2016, WWE has reportedly taken several measures to hide fans' disapproval of Reigns, this included: confiscating anti-Reigns fan signs, editing out anti-Reigns fan signs for photos on their website, muting hostile crowds (including at WrestleMania 32) and piping in canned cheers during Reigns' appearances.\nIn 2016, Reigns main evented the first seven WWE pay-per-view events (before the brand split started) and was booed in all of them: Royal Rumble, Fastlane, WrestleMania 32 (which ended with a chorus of boos when Reigns won his third world title), Payback, Extreme Rules, Money in the Bank and Battleground. CNET described a \"fan rebellion\" against WWE \"moving heaven and earth\" to make Reigns \"the face of the company... for the next decade\"; while \"many fans are aware\" that former Shield member Dean Ambrose \"is the true dark horse, both on camera and behind the scenes\". ESPN described that \"WWE started building Roman Reigns as the next great hero of the company about 18 months ago\", but Reigns instead became \"the most despised wrestler WWE has had since it turned Sgt. Slaughter into an Iraq-sympathizing traitor in 1990\". Leading up to WrestleMania 32, WWE Hall of Famers Stone Cold Steve Austin, Rikishi and Hulk Hogan have encouraged WWE to turn him into a villain. Meanwhile, during interviews promoting WrestleMania 32, Anoa'i acknowledged the fan backlash, but declared that WWE is a \"kids show\" and that he was not wrestling to impress \"grown men\" who boo him. He defiantly told his critics that he would not believe any of their negative opinions of him. As for his detractors, Anoa'i told them to \"continue to be ready to boo. You're going to be mad a long time. I'm not going away\".\n\nOn the \"Raw\" after WrestleMania 32, Reigns declared that he was now not a \"bad guy\" nor a \"good guy\", but \"The Guy\", which supposedly indicated a morally ambiguous character turn, but this went nowhere. In April, \"Pro Wrestling Dot Net\" reported that WWE \"went out of their way to use [the charity] Make A Wish in hopes of getting [Reigns] over as a good guy\". As soon as broadcasting for Payback on May 1 stopped, Reigns reportedly turned on the crowd, yelling angrily at them. Also in May, Dave Meltzer said WWE wanted Reigns as \"the guy who does the charity work, so he has to be positioned as a babyface\" (the heroic character), adding that WWE's \"new gimmick\" was positioning that people actually \"really like\" Reigns and only boo because \"it's fun to boo him\", which Meltzer said was \"absolutely not true\" in reality. Critics wondered if WWE was \"leaving money on the table\" by not slotting former Shield teammate Seth Rollins as a fan favorite and Reigns as a villain, as fans were cheering Rollins and booing Reigns. In June, Reigns wrestled against Rollins at both Money in the Bank and the next night on \"Raw\", where Reigns played a villain in the first match and a fan favorite in the second, while on the next night on \"Raw\" during his promo he told the fans who were booing him to \"shut their mouths\". Reigns' wellness policy suspension on June 21 resulted in \"Yahoo! TV\" urging WWE to \"quit pretending he's some kind of lovable underdog\" with a villain turn for Reigns, after wasting a \"dozen\" chances \"since the boos first reigned\" at the 2015 Royal Rumble.\nAs soon as Reigns returned from suspension in July and leading into SummerSlam, writers from the \"Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter\" wrote that \"Raw\" was \"still the Roman Reigns Show\", \"with him necessarily closing out the show with the last laugh\" (post-SummerSlam, \"\"Raw\" is Roman\" continued). Also in August, Anoa'i no longer wore the contact lenses, again changing the Reigns' character look. Although Reigns dropped from world title contention to being United States Champion in September, he remained unable to connect with fans. Nonetheless, calculated efforts to garner crowd support persisted. Wade Keller of the \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" said that WWE was damaging its product by associating Reigns with \"really good\" and \"popular\" performers in a \"hapless attempt\" to get him over. \"Pro Wrestling Dot Net\" columnist Jason Powell said that McMahon's \"obsession\" with generating support for Reigns had handicapped Seth Rollins, whom fans wanted to see as a fan favorite in May, but was kept as a villain to oppose the heroic (and thoroughly booed) Reigns until a \"horrible\" turn into a fan favorite in September. In November, Fin Martin of \"Power Slam\" remarked: \"Vince [McMahon] has successfully trained or retrained most of his audience to consume what he is serving. Roman Reigns being the exception, of course. It says something that fans will cheer Shane McMahon's toe-curlingly naff attempts at pro wrestling in the ring and his entrance dance... yet they won't cheer for Reigns, no matter how heroically he is portrayed\". As a result of his achievements in 2016, despite topping \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" (\"PWI\") annual \"PWI 500\" which is mainly about kayfabe results, Reigns was voted by \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" readers as Most Hated Wrestler of the Year, a first for a heroic character since the award was devised in 1972. \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" readers instead awarded Reigns the 2016 Most Overrated award. Reigns had finished in second place for Most Overrated in both 2014 and 2015. In January 2017, \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" began their weekly \"Monday Night Reigns-o-meter\", which monitored his \"ability to beat the odds and come out on top\".\nGoing into 2017, WWE continued to edit reactions for Reigns, one example being after he lost the United States Championship to Chris Jericho, when an audience member was shown live jumping for joy at the result, but when WWE showed replays of Reigns' loss they showed a clip of the same fan looking unhappy. Veteran wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin and \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" editor Wade Keller criticised Reigns' attitude in mainstream interviews, specifically Reigns stating that he \"just\" worked 9-to-5 before becoming a professional wrestler as well as flaunting his financial prospects within WWE, with Austin saying Reigns has \"got to watch\" what he says and needs to be \"smarter\" while Keller saw him as \"trying to impress the people interviewing him\" and \"not thinking about the fans who are paying the money for the seats\". Keller also scolded Reigns and WWE for publicly claiming they are happy with any crowd reaction for Reigns, whether positive or negative, describing such statements as \"insincere\" and \"spin\" since they \"turn the volume down; they seek out fans who are cheering him; they doctor footage to make it seem like fans are cheering him when they're not... they manipulate in every way that they can to make it seem like he's not getting a negative reaction\".\n\nIn the 2017 Royal Rumble match on January 29, Reigns entered as the surprise last entrant despite losing a WWE Universal Championship match against Kevin Owens earlier that night. Fans had anticipated other surprise entrants including Finn Bálor, Kurt Angle, Samoa Joe, Shinsuke Nakamura and Kenny Omega—international media outlets noted that this drew \"This is bullshit!\" chants from the live crowd and even more boos when he eliminated The Undertaker. Reigns was still booed after eliminating villain wrestlers Chris Jericho and Bray Wyatt. Stone Cold Steve Austin believed that Reigns was the \"set-up guy\" and \"did a favor\" to help Randy Orton by letting Orton eliminate him to win the Royal Rumble. The following night on \"Raw\", the villainous Braun Strowman received a \"Thank you Strowman!\" chant for costing Reigns his WWE Universal Championship match at the Royal Rumble. This chant was repeated after Strowman cost Reigns a match on the February 6 episode \"Raw\", with Tom Colohue of \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" writing that Strowman's vendetta against Reigns may have \"accidentally turned\" the villain into a fan favorite. In February 2017, Meltzer said it was \"obvious\" that WWE's push of Reigns \"will never end\". Later that month, wrestling podcaster Peter Rosenberg lamented that—unlike the similarly powerful Hulk Hogan—Reigns \"doesn't show vulnerability, ever\".\n\nOn March 5 at Fastlane, Reigns defeated Strowman and became the first man to successfully pin him in WWE. Although the match itself was praised, this booking choice was poorly received by critics, who agreed that, despite adding nothing to Reigns' reputation, the match's ending would severely hurt Strowman's \"unstoppable beast\" image, \"undid\" all the momentum Strowman had acquired during the previous months and might even damage his career and future in WWE. Many believed that a better, more logical booking move would have been for The Undertaker, who was heavily rumored to face Reigns at WrestleMania 33 after Reigns eliminated him during the Royal Rumble match, to interfere in the match, causing Reigns to either win by disqualification, thus letting Strowman unpinned, or lose because of The Undertaker, thus still looking strong. The rumor did end up being true and Reigns and The Undertaker had a face-off on the March 6 episode of \"Raw\", hinting a confrontation at WrestleMania 33. The crowd chanted \"Roman sucks!\" loudly during both Reigns' entrance and the face-off between the two, but when releasing the video on their YouTube channel WWE edited the audio to make those chants inaudible, which led to many media outlets reporting and criticizing the edit. Wade Keller of \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" noted that \"the crowd popped\" for WWE Hall of Famer Shawn Michaels when he came out for a promo with Reigns on the March 13 episode of \"Raw\", but then booed Michaels after he endorsed Reigns, who would again be beaten down by Strowman to the delight of the crowd. Keller's colleague Tom Colohue noted that \"everybody wants [Reigns] to fail\", but applauded his \"simple, effective promo\" that was \"probably the best work Roman's ever done on the mic\".\nIn March 2017, Dave Meltzer reported that WWE's long term plans (\"which obviously could change\") for 2018's WrestleMania 34 was to \"once again build for a year and have the big coronation\" for Reigns, who would still be a heroic character \"between now and then\" and beat Brock Lesnar for the WWE Universal Championship \"to fully replace John Cena as the lead babyface of the company\", while the \"idea\" for Lesnar's role \"for years now\" was \"to become a monster, be unbeatable, run through everybody, and then lose to Roman Reigns\". At WrestleMania 33 on April 2, Reigns was booed before, during and after the main event (his third WrestleMania main event in a row), which saw Reigns beating The Undertaker, who seemingly retired. Before the match, \"Pro Wrestling Insider\"'s Dave Scherer predicted that if Reigns beat and retired The Undertaker, then \"the fans that hate him will hate him forever\". Critics reported that after the match, WWE \"did clearly turn down the sound\" from the audience \"and then they hit the pyro\", but boos were still heard during a break in Reigns' music being played. On the \"Raw\" after WrestleMania, Reigns was loudly booed and the crowd microphone volumes were turned down when he appeared, but multiple chants of \"Delete\", \"Fuck you, Roman\", \"You suck\", \"Asshole\", \"Roman sucks\", \"Shut the fuck up\" and \"Go away\" were still heard before Reigns chose to speak. After that segment, WWE commentators labelled the post-WrestleMania 33 crowd as \"non-traditional WWE fans\" who may cheer for those they normally boo and boo those they normally cheer \"all in the name of fun\", which echoed similar comments a year prior for the post-WrestleMania 32 crowd. \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" editor Wade Keller wrote that these comments would anger fans as \"genuine dissatisfaction with the product is reframed by Vince McMahon's propaganda machine\" – Undertaker received the usual reaction from fans, as did Reigns, just more intensely. Following Reigns' victory over The Undertaker and given that Reigns was reportedly selling more merchandise than any other full-time WWE wrestler (John Cena, who sold more, was considered a part-timer), \"Forbes\" writer Blake Oestriecher declared Reigns as \"indeed the new face of WWE, one who could remain in that spot for the next decade\".\n\nGreat Balls of Fire saw a post-match attack by Reigns after he lost an ambulance match to Strowman, which was widely described as the protagonist Reigns attempting to murder the villainous Strowman. As a result, there has been some speculation on whether or not this angle was a double turn (where Reigns and Strowman swap roles as the hero and the villain), with Reigns being described as a \"sore loser\" attacking Strowman, who won fairly to the stipulation, to the point of attempted murder. However, nothing of this sort ultimately came to fruition and Reigns was even awarded a WWE Universal Championship shot at SummerSlam with speculation that the plans for Reigns to face Lesnar at WrestleMania 34 had been changed. At the event on August 20, Lesnar retained the title by pinning Reigns in a match also involving Strowman and Samoa Joe. Meltzer claimed that the plans for the Lesnar–Reigns match at WrestleMania 34 were scrapped, but after seeing Reigns get pinned by Lesnar, he stated that the plans might still be in place. In September on \"Raw\", both (storyline) general manager Kurt Angle and commentator Corey Graves described Reigns as a wrestling \"icon\". At No Mercy, Reigns defeated John Cena, seemingly ending Cena's full-time wrestling career as this was seen as a \"passing of the torch\" moment in which Reigns had indeed replaced Cena as the face of the company. During the match, Reigns was booked to kick out of four \"Attitude Adjustments\" (one of which was off the top rope) and then defeated Cena with two spears. In October 2017, Reigns was revealed as the highest rated wrestler in the \"WWE 2K18\" game. GamesRadar+ wrote that \"this is likely a call made by WWE [...] rather than [game] developer 2K\" and that by ranking Reigns higher than historic wrestlers \"in their prime\" like the 1997 version of the Stone Cold Steve Austin character, Reigns is being treated as the \"greatest wrestler of all-time\".\n\nIn a December 2017 interview, Anoaʻi called himself \"the best performer, in-ring, in the world right now\". In response, Brian Campbell of CBS Sports wrote that Anoaʻi \"isn't even the best performer in his own company\" and \"wouldn't even finish in the top five\" in the world. Meanwhile, fellow wrestler Kenny Omega commented that \"it sounds so ridiculous\" and that there was \"no possible way\" Anoaʻi believed what he said. Also that month, WWE vice president Triple H said regarding Reigns: \"I think he is one of the best that WWE have right now [...] the truth is, and some people will listen to this and want to argue against it, but honestly most of the people who argue against it aren't qualified to make that argument. I am\".\n\nIn March 2018, Reigns said regarding his reception that \"everyone wants to see you do good, but not too good\"; and that there is \"possible jealousy\" from fans regarding his \"major success\". Before WrestleMania 34 in April 2018, Reigns said that he would not try to change for anyone that did not like him. Reigns' main event match with Lesnar at WrestleMania 34 was resoundingly rejected by the crowd, as Reigns was booed while the crowd played with beach balls and instead chanted \"CM Punk\", \"Boring\" and \"This is awful!\" Troy L. Smith of Cleveland.com concluded that this match was the worst ever WrestleMania main event due to the \"utter disdain\" it produced, with there never being a more \"disinterested\" crowd for a WrestleMania main event. Meltzer wrote that Reigns' loss was \"done for sympathy for Reigns when it was over to make him a babyface as they concentrated on showing him all beaten up\".\nOn April 30, the go-home edition of \"Raw\" before Backlash, Reigns was met with great hostility from the crowd in Montreal. Reigns was heavily booed, in contrast to his rival Samoa Joe, who received overwhelming cheers despite being portrayed as a heel. At Backlash, a large number of the crowd in New Jersey reportedly walked out of the arena during Reigns' match with Joe, a match Reigns was booked to win. Brian Campbell and Adam Silverstein of CBS Sports wrote that it was \"just impossible to ignore how poorly WWE continues to treat its own fanbase...this has escalated to the point where the psychology and storyline simply makes no sense in ways that can't be good for business\". Meltzer described that \"lots of people were leaving\" during Reigns' match and that the crowd was chanting that the match was boring. \"Pro Wrestling Dot Net\" editor Jason Powell described WWE Chairman Vince McMahon as \"completely insane when it comes to his obsession with Reigns being his company’s top babyface\" when the \"definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results\". Powell went on to mock WWE's \"frequently repeated line about how WWE listens to its fans\" and another WWE claim that \"any reaction is a good reaction\". Meltzer said that the character of Reigns was being modeled after Daniel Bryan's, with the similar storyline that WWE \"management is screwing him over and that's why he's not the champion\", and that despite fans not buying this storyline, no one in WWE had a better idea for Reigns. Even though Reigns lost his matches to Lesnar at WrestleMania 34 and at the Greatest Royal Rumble, it was still indicated by the company that the two would face each other again at SummerSlam.\n\nAt Money in the Bank, Reigns' match with Jinder Mahal was widely rejected by crowd in Illinois. Within the first two minutes of the match, once again, chants of \"CM Punk\" and \"Boring\" were heard. The crowd continued to ignore the match by playing with beach balls, performing the Mexican wave, and continued chants of other wrestlers names, booing officials who confiscated the beach balls, and continued negative chants about the match. Every other match on the card, however, was well received. In July 2018 on \"Raw\", Reigns told fans who \"boo\", \"hate\", or claim that he \"is being crammed down our throats\" to \"learn to like it or close your mouth.\" Meanwhile, Wade Keller of \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" criticised Anoa’i for arguing that he deserves his push due to hard work and winning many titles. Keller pointed out that Anoa’i \"doesn't work harder than dozens of other colleagues, yet he acts as if he's special\", and that Reigns' title wins were \"granted by Vince McMahon.\" At Extreme Rules, Reigns again received overwhelming boos while his opponent Bobby Lashley was wildly cheered. During the match, security threatened to eject anti-Reigns fans and confiscated anti-Reigns signs. Lashley received wild cheers for his victory over Roman, as well as chants of \"Thank you Lashley!\"\n\nIn August 2018 at SummerSlam, the audience started out giving Reigns a fairly mixed reaction during his entrance. Following Braun Strowman's announcement of his plan to cash-in post match, the crowd cheered. A brief chant of \"Let's go Roman/Roman Sucks\" filled the arena at one point, followed by chants of \"You both suck\" directed at both Lesnar and Reigns. in the ring. When Reigns pinned Lesnar to win the WWE Universal Championship, the crowd cheered. \n\nThe following night on \"Raw\", Reigns was again booed early in the show, but received a mixed reaction for suggesting that he defend his newly-won championship against Finn Bálor later that night. After beating Bálor, Reigns was again heavily booed by the crowd, which increased in intensity after the match when Braun Strowman attempted to cash in his Money in the Bank title shot. The subsequent Shield reunion and attack on Strowman was positively received by the Brooklyn audience, but was viewed by many as a cheap attempt to garner positive reactions for Reigns. At Hell in a Cell, Reigns defended his Universal Championship against Braun Strowman, during which Reigns was booed heavily while the villainous Strowman was wildly cheered by fans. The match was victim to high controversy, with the first incident being when special guest referee Mick Foley counted Reigns down for a three count, but instead of Strowman getting the victory, the pinfall was simply ignored, with the second being when the match ended in a no contest after interference from a returning Brock Lesnar. After the match ended, the network stream abruptly ended with many saying this was done to avoid broadcasting the heavy boos from fans with many taking to social media claiming that chants of \"Bullshit!\" and \"We want refunds!\" along with heavy booing broke out as Reigns, Strowman and Lesnar all had walked to the back.\n\nOn the October 22, 2018 episode of \"Raw\", Reigns announced that he was re-diagnosed with leukemia after 11 years and would be taking a hiatus to treat it. As a result, he relinquished the Universal Championship, ending his reign of 64 days. Reigns initially received a mixed reaction upon entering the arena, but was welcomed with a positive reception after his announcement of leukemia was made.\n\n"}

{"id": "1001141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1001141", "title": "Royal Game of Ur", "text": "Royal Game of Ur\n\nThe Royal Game of Ur, also known as the Game of Twenty Squares or simply the Game of Ur, is a two-player strategy race board game that was first played in ancient Mesopotamia during the early third millennium BC. The game was popular across the Middle East among people of all social strata and boards for playing it have been found at locations as far away from Mesopotamia as Crete and Sri Lanka. At the height of its popularity, the game acquired spiritual significance, and events in the game were believed to reflect a player's future and convey messages from deities or other supernatural beings. The Game of Ur remained popular until late antiquity, when it stopped being played, possibly evolving into, or being displaced by, an early form of backgammon. It was eventually forgotten everywhere except among the Jewish population of the Indian city of Kochi, who continued playing a version of it until the 1950s when they began emigrating to Israel.\n\nThe Game of Ur received its name because it was first rediscovered by the English archaeologist Sir Leonard Woolley during his excavations of the Royal Cemetery at Ur between 1922 and 1934. Copies of the game have since been found by other archaeologists across the Middle East. The rules of the Game of Ur as it was played in the second century BC have been preserved on a Babylonian clay tablet written by the scribe Itti-Marduk-balālu. Based on this tablet and the shape of the , British Museum curator Irving Finkel has reconstructed the basic rules of how the game might have been played. The object of the game is to run the course of the board and bear all one's pieces off before one's opponent. Like modern backgammon, the game combines elements of both strategy and random chance.\n\nThe Game of Ur was popular across the Middle East and boards for it have been found in Iran, Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, Sri Lanka, Cyprus, and Crete. Four gameboards bearing a very close resemblance to the Royal Game of Ur were found in the funeral chamber of the Tomb of Tutankhamun. These boards came with small boxes to store dice and game pieces and many had senet boards on the reverse sides so that the same board could be used to play either game and merely had to be flipped over. The game was popular among all social classes. A graffito version of the game carved with a sharp object, possibly a dagger, was discovered on one of the human-headed winged bull gate sentinels from the palace of Sargon II (721–705 BC) in the city of Khorsabad.\n\nThe Game of Ur eventually acquired superstitious significance and the tablet of Itti-Marduk-balālu provides vague predictions for the players' futures if they land on certain spaces, such as \"You will find a friend\", \"You will become powerful like a lion\", or \"You will draw fine beer\". People saw relationships between a player's success in the game and his or her success in real life. Seemingly random events such as landing on a certain square were interpreted as messages from deities, ghosts of deceased ancestors, or from a person's own soul.\n\nIt is unclear what led to the Game of Ur's eventual decline during late antiquity. One theory holds that it evolved into backgammon; whereas another holds that early forms of backgammon eclipsed the Game of Ur in popularity, causing players to eventually forget about the older game. At some point before the game fell out of popularity in the Middle East, it was apparently introduced to the Indian city of Kochi by a group of Jewish merchants. Members of the Jewish population of Kochi were still playing a recognizable form of the Game of Ur by the time they started emigrating to Israel in the 1950s after World War II. The Kochi version of the game had twenty squares, just like the original Mesopotamian version, but each player had twelve pieces rather than seven and the placement of the twenty squares was slightly different.\n\nThe British archaeologist Sir Leonard Woolley discovered five gameboards of the Game of Ur during his excavation of the Royal Cemetery at Ur between 1922 and 1934. Because the game was first discovered in the Royal Cemetery at Ur, it became known as the \"Royal Game of Ur\", but later archaeologists uncovered other copies of the game from various other locations across the Middle East. Each of the boards discovered by Wooley date to around 3000 BC. All five boards were of an identical type, but they were made of different materials and had different decorations. Woolley reproduced images of two of these boards in his 1949 book, \"The First Phases\". One of these is a relatively simple set with a background composed of discs of shell with blue or red centers set in wood-covered bitumen. The other is a more elaborate one completely covered with shell plaques, inlaid with red limestone and lapis lazuli. Other gameboards are often engraved with images of animals.\n\nWhen the Game of Ur was first discovered, no one knew how it was played. Then, in the early 1980s, Irving Finkel, a curator at the British Museum, translated a clay tablet written 177 BC by the Babylonian scribe Itti-Marduk-balālu describing how the game was played during that time period, based on an earlier description of the rules by another scribe named Iddin-Bēl. This tablet was written during the waning days of Babylonian civilization, long after the time when the Game of Ur was first played. It had been discovered in 1880 in the ruins of Babylon and sold to the British Museum. Finkel also used photographs of another tablet describing the rules, which had been in the personal collection of Count Aymar de Liedekerke-Beaufort, but had been destroyed during World War I. This second tablet was undated, but is believed by archaeologists to have been written several centuries earlier than the tablet by Itti-Marduk-balālu and to have originated from the city of Uruk. The backs of both tablets show diagrams of the gameboard, clearly indicating which game they are describing. Based on these rules and the shape of the gameboard, Finkel was able to reconstruct how the game might have been played.\n\nThe Game of Ur is a race game and it is probably a direct ancestor of the tables, or backgammon, family of games, which are still played today. The Game of Ur is played using two sets of seven checker-like game pieces. One set of pieces are white with five black dots and the other set is black with five white dots. The gameboard is composed of two rectangular sets of boxes, one containing three rows of four boxes each and the other containing three rows of two boxes each, joined together by a \"narrow bridge\" of two boxes. The gameplay involves elements of both luck and strategy. Movements are determined by rolling a set of four-sided, pyramid-shaped dice. Two of the four corners of each die are marked and the other two are not, giving each die an equal chance of landing with a marked or unmarked corner facing up. The number of marked ends facing upwards after a roll of the dice indicates how many spaces a player may move during that turn. A single game can last up to half an hour and can be very intense.\n\nThe object of the game is for a player to move all seven of his or her pieces along the course (\"two proposed versions of which are shown at right\") and off the board before his or her opponent. On all surviving gameboards, the two sides of the board are always identical with each other, indicating that the two sides of the board belong to each player. When a piece is on one of the player's own squares, it is safe from capture, but, when it is on one of the eight squares in the middle of the board, the opponent's pieces may capture it by landing on the same space, sending the piece back off the board so that it must restart the course from the beginning. This means there are six \"safe\" squares and eight \"combat\" squares. There can never be more than one piece on a single square at any given time, so having too many pieces on the board at once can impede a player's mobility.\n\nWhen a player rolls a number using the dice, he or she may choose to move any of his or her pieces on the board or add a new piece to the board if he or she still has pieces that have not entered the game. A player is not required to capture a piece every time he or she has the opportunity. Nonetheless, players are required to move a piece whenever possible, even if it results in an unfavorable outcome. All surviving gameboards have a colored rosette in the middle of the center row. According to Finkel's reconstruction, if a piece is located on the space with the rosette, it is safe from capture. In order to remove a piece from the board, a player must roll exactly the number of spaces remaining until the end of the course plus one. If the player rolls a number any higher or lower than this number, he or she may not remove the piece from the board.\n\nOne archaeological dig uncovered twenty-one white balls alongside a set of the Game of Ur. It is believed that these balls were probably used for placing wagers. According to the tablet of Itti-Marduk-balālu, whenever a player skips one of the boxes marked with a rosette, he or she must place a token in the pot. If a player lands on a rosette, he or she may take a token from the pot.\n\n\n"}

The game was developed by Iguana Entertainment and published by Acclaim Entertainment for the Nintendo 64 in 1998 for North America and in 1999 for Europe. It was later ported to Microsoft Windows in 1999 and released in North America only. The PlayStation port was developed by Appaloosa Interactive in 1999. A Game Boy Color version was in development, but it was eventually canceled by creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, feelings the game would not fit in a console marketed towards children. However, they did keep a few copies of the Game Boy Color version to commemorate what was originally started as the first \"South Park\" game. Despite the Nintendo 64 version's positive reception, the PC and PlayStation versions of \"South Park\" were panned by critics. A Sega Dreamcast version was planned for a 2000 release, but was cancelled during development for unknown reasons. In 2018, a ROM image of the Game Boy Color version was leaked online.\n\n\"South Park\" is a first-person shooter. The game's single player mode places the player in control of one of the four main characters of South Park (Cartman, Kyle, Stan or Kenny). The player must defeat a variety of enemies using the various weapons found throughout each stage in order to reach the exit point at the end.\n\nIn addition to completing levels, the player must also prevent large enemies in the stage (dubbed 'Tanks') from reaching the exit before they do. If they fail to do so, they will be forced to defend South Park from the 'Tanks' in a short minigame after the stage.\n\nIn Head-to-Head mode, the players select a level, characters, and game style (time limited, damage limited, or unending). The Microsoft Windows version allows for online head-to-head play.\n\nIn the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions, upon reaching select stages in single player mode, codes are revealed. These can then be input into the \"Cheesy Poofs Decoder\" to unlock additional characters for Head-to-Head play. All characters are unlocked in the Microsoft Windows version.\n\nA mysterious comet is approaching the earth, described by the opening narration as a force of concentrated evil that no force of good can stand against. As it comes closer, South Park is beset by enemies, including rabid mutant turkeys, deformed clones of the townsfolk, alien visitors, berserk robots, and sentient killer toys. Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny hear about the dangers from Chef, and take up arms to investigate their sources and defend the town.\n\n\"South Park\"s reception depended on the platform. Overall, the game was met with overwhelmingly negative critical reception with the PC and PlayStation versions, while the Nintendo 64 version generally received positive reviews from critics. The PlayStation and PC versions received poor reception due to the bad graphics, poor visuals and bad voice acting. The Nintendo 64 version received the best reviews upon release. Aggregating review website GameRankings gave the Nintendo 64 version 67.11%, the PC version 51.72% and the PlayStation version 41.22%.\n\nGameSpot gave the PlayStation version a 1.4/10, stating that \"\"South Park\" is definitely one of those games that is bound to come up when you start thinking about the worst game you've ever played.\" IGN called the PlayStation version \"frustrating\" due to poor graphics, repetition of the voice acting, and lack of play value for the head-to-head mode. GameSpot stated in the PC version that \"A good license and good graphics aren't enough.\" The voice acting, done by the original voice actors, was criticized for being repetitive, isolated, and old. The weapons of the game were also criticized for being unprofessional.\n\nDespite the negative reception from the Windows and PlayStation versions, the Nintendo 64 version was praised for its 3D graphics and storyline, with IGN calling the game \"just as funny as the Comedy Central series.\" GameSpot stated in the Nintendo 64 version that the level design was \"really not very good on its own, but given the license, it at least makes sense.\"\n\nA spiritual sequel in the style of a sandbox action-adventure game was in development for the PlayStation 2, Gamecube and Xbox, but was not finished. Little was known about the game until a build was found on an Xbox development kit, but only video footage of the beta build has been released to the public. The footage appears to showcase the PlayStation 2 version, due to the visual button displays used in the game. A cutscene from the game was even leaked on YouTube showing Cartman in a mental hospital.\n"}

The film premiere in Ukraine took place on March 7, 2018. \n\nThe film tells about a wandering artist Ruslan who saves princess Mila kidnapped by evil sorcerer Chornomor.\n\nIn Ukrainian version, the roles were dubbed by:\n\nTwo sorcerers, Finn and Shernomore, have an intense magical duel in favor of saving Finn's wife, Meena. Finn gains the upperhand at first, but is defeated by Shernomore who deceives him by stepping on a \"force field\", and losing all of his powers and youthfullness, which then transfers to Shernomore and transforms Meena into a stone statue in exchange for her power of love as a source of his magic.\n\nIn the present day, Ruslan, a wandering artist dreaming to become a knight, is having a small play which he plays the role of Finn and Shernomore, and is written by an eccentric and an aspiring playwright, Lester. In the castle lived a adventurous and kind princess named Meelah. She considers the castle as a hindrance for his father and the King, is forcing her to get married despite she doesn't love whoever he suggests. One night, she sneaks out and she was almost harrased by two men, until Ruslan arrives. He saves Meelah from the two and escape. When the two are alone, Ruslan, afraid of being judged by his status, disguises himself as a knight.\n\nThe next day, they share romantic moments as they develop their feelings for each other. Unfortunately, much to Ruslan's surprise and horror, Meelah was kidnapped via a tornado by Shernomore, He tries to pursue Meelah, but fails to do so and knocks himself unconscious. When he gained consciousness, he is confronted by the King, who mistakenly accuses him of harming the princess. He tries to tell the truth, but none of them belived him. Realizing Shernomore is real, he consults Lester and they set off to the cave where a wise cat lives. \n\nThe two asks for help on where to find Meelah and reveals to them a magic vortex where they discover a magical place and gives them a pea pod as a \"gift\". When they reached the cliff, a hamster suddenly steals the pod and they pursue it. But they realized that they are supposed to give it to him and unlocks a dinosaur-like bridge.\n\nMeanwhile, at Shernomore's castle, Meelah awakens at a bed and she tries to escape using a hat that makes the user invisible. Despite Shernomore casting a spell that makes all of the desserts there alive, she manages to defeat these and discovers the other ladies who are victims of Shernomore's evil sorcery.\n\nWhen the two arrive at the cave, they meet a strange old man who holds a staff similar to a wizard, and asks help on where to find Finn. However, the old man reveals himself to be Finn. But due to him having no contact on the outside world for too long, he is too paranoid to communicate with. With the help of Ruslan's plan, they pretend to be \"wizards\" who are casting a \"spell\" to lure him down. Finn, beliving that his powers are restored, tries to stop them. Ruslan and the gang pretend to be dead, only for them to contain Finn. When they got him, Ruslan asks where to find Shernomore and how to stop him, Finn tells them that his castle is made of spiky rocks and the source of his power is in his beard, asking him to cut it off, but no one was able to do that. And he tells Ruslan that he needs a magic sword in order to do that. After asking for the directions on where to find the sword, they locate and it is guarded by a giant knight. The giant challenges Ruslan in exchange for the armor and sword, but Ruslan manages to defeat all of them and they went to Shernomore's castle. \n\nWhen they got to the castle, they splitted to find Meelah. Ruslan finds Meelah in a different outfit and appearance and tells him that she does not need to rescue her, for she is happy at this place. This breaks Ruslan's heart. Feeling down, he slowly leaves the place. Suddenly, a giant monster attacks them. Lester tries to convince Ruslan to fight, but he's too lonely to do so. The bird gets Meelah's pendant and makes Ruslan realize that he is being deceived by Shernomore and gains courage to fight the monster. \n\nAfter defeating the monster, they went to the place where Meelah is kept and he and Shernomore engages at a n intense duel. Ruslan is defeated at first, but manages to incapacitate Shernomore by cutting his beard, losing his powers and transforms the stone staues and Finn back to normal. Ruslan tries to escape with Meelah, but they are trapped in the force field the same way as Finn did before. Ruslan sacrifices himself by pushing Meelah out of the trap, leaving him incapacitated. Meelah tries to pull Ruslan out, but is interrupted by the three nights, resulting in Ruslan's soul being zapped from him and leaving him lifeless. Enraged, Meelah fights the three knights and defeats them all (including Shernomore who is tied up). \n\nMeelah mourns for the apparent death of Ruslan and says that she loves him so much. A now-rejuvenated Finn appears and brings back Ruslan to life. The two reunite including Lester and Finn and Meena reunites as well. Ruslan confesses that he is not a real knight, but Meelah accepts this, and tells she still loves him no matter what. Finn conjures up a fireworks display, and they lived happily ever after.\n\nDuring the credits, Ruslan and Meelah shows being married and living a happy life.\n\nThe film is co-financed by Ukrainian State Film Agency: its share is 19.5 million UAH (total production cost of the film is 95.2 million UAH).\n\nOn January 30, 2013 producer Egor Olesov informed about the development of Ruslan and Lyudmila project based on a fairy tale poem with the same title by Aleksandr Pushkin. In September 2013, press service of FILM.UA Group announced the start of film production, and later the protagonists and synopsis for Ruslan and Lyudmila were presented with the film itself announced as 2D animation; later, however, the concept changed, and a decision was made to create a 3D animated film. \n\nHollywood consultants helped with developing the characters. According to the authors of the film, Ruslan and Lyudmila was made in English and then dubbed in Ukrainian. As Olesov says, Hollywood celebrities will be involved in English dubbing, and in Ukraine, popular local actors will lend their voices to the film. For the international market, the film was given another title, \"The Stolen Princess\".\n\nIn December 2015, the script and characters’ stories were finalized; animation of approved scenes was completed.\n\n\"The Stolen Princess\" became the first project in the line of theatrically animated premieres from Animagrad, which also includes Mavka. The Forest Song (2018), Snow Republic (2019), and Roksolana and Suleiman (2021). According to the company director, Animagrad plans to release one animated feature per year, both for local Ukrainian and international distribution.\n\nIn February 2015 at the European film market during Berlin International Film Festival, the rights to film distribution were sold to Israel and South Korea; in May 2016 at Marché du Film of Cannes International Film Festival, to France, French-speaking territories, Bulgaria, Iran, and Poland. On December 10, 2016, The Hollywood Reporter informed that the film after its presentation a month before at the American film market was sold to China, (Germany), Austria, Switzerland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, North Africa, and the Middle East. It was also announced that sales to some other territories were pending.\n\nOn March 13–16, 2017 in Hong Kong, FILMART took place, which is an annual film and TV content market. The FILM.UA Group stand presented projects of Animagrad studio, including \"The Stolen Princess\". On the penultimate day of the market, the scenes from the animated film were screened in Asia for the first time; the invitation to the premiere appeared on the cover of The Hollywood Reporter, and the screening itself was successful and gathered positive feedback from market participants. In early April, Cannes hosted MIPTV (Marché International des Programmes de Télévision), a major European market of audiovisual content. The stand of Ukrainian delegation presented, among others, \"The Stolen Princess\" film. On May 19 and 23, 2017 the biggest film market Marche du Film under the aegis of the 70th Cannes International Film Festival held market screenings of \"The Stolen Princess\", which enjoyed considerable success: the project gathered countless positive reviews, and negotiations on rights sales for the new territories began.\n\nImmediately after Ukrainian release, the theatrical release took place in Romania (March 16) and Turkey (March 23). During the first Romanian weekend, Ukrainian animated feature film collected $165,066 in the box office and placed second after American blockbuster Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer). It is interesting to compare the film with the main animated releases of 2017–2018 from Hollywood majors such as Disney Pixar, DreamWorks Animation, and Blue Sky Studios, which also took place in Romania: the box office of Ukrainian Princess during the first weekend exceeded those of Coco, Ferdinand the Bull, and Baby Boss, ceding only to the third movie of Cars franchise. The premiere box office of the Ukrainian film places it third among animated releases in Turkey in 2018.\n\nAs of April 13, \"The Stolen Princess\" is now shown in the cinemas of Ukraine, Romania, Turkey, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Lebanon, Jordan, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain. In total, the rights to the animated film screening have been sold to more than 50 countries, including France, Germany, countries of the Middle East, Southern Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In November 2018 Ukrainian media reported that the film had been shown in more than 40 countries with more than half a million viewers. In January 2019 the film will become the first Ukrainian film to be commercially released to cinemas in China.\n\nIn late December 2016 it was announced that the film will change its title from Ruslan and Lyudmila to \"The Stolen Princess\" for its Ukrainian release as well (before that, in February 2016 the film producers already informed that they will use \"The Stolen Princess\", not Ruslan and Lyudmila as the title for international distribution). In October 2017 it became known that film producers changed the title of the film for Ukrainian release again, to \"The Stolen Princess: Ruslan and Lyudmila\". The date of Ukrainian release, March 7, 2018, also became known. \nOn December 15, 2015, in the framework of winter film market of Odessa International Film Festival Novyi TV channel acquired the rights to TV broadcast of the film. According to the deal, the TV premiere of the film is scheduled in six months after the start of its theatrical release.\n\nThe theme song of the film Do zirok (To the Stars) was performed by Vremya i Steklo band. On February 14, a music video for the song was presented. The author of the Ukrainian lyrics is Oleksandra Ruban, the arrangement to the song was made by Milos Jelic, keyboard player in Okean Elzy band, and the instrumental part was performed by the musicians of Kyiv Virtuosos orchestra. \nThe final song in the end credits to the feature film, Ty Lyubov Moya (You’re My Love), was performed by Jamala.\n\nDuring the first weekend in Ukraine, the film collected 21 million UAH ($0.8 million) in its box office. During five weekends, the film collected 35,857,041 UAH and hit a record among films produced in Ukraine.\n\nThe film got mixed reviews. The audience noted the lack of Ukrainian flavor and blind copying of Hollywood standards, inappropriate references to current realia, and lack of charisma among certain characters. However, the reviewers have also praised high animation standards, clever jokes, and the animated feature film appealing to topics of interest to both adults and children.\n\n"}

Jason Statham plays Frank Martin in the first three movies, a professional freelance courier driver for hire. Statham himself is an accomplished martial artist, allowing him to do all the combat scenes involving Frank Martin himself. This permits the films' signature Hong Kong-style fight scenes, choreographed by Corey Yuen. \nChris Vance portrays Frank Martin in the and Ed Skrein portrays Frank Martin in the fourth film, a reboot.\n\nFrank Martin (Jason Statham) is a highly skilled driver known only as \"The Transporter.\" He will transport anything, no questions asked, always on time, and he is known as the best in the business. He strictly follows three rules when transporting: Rule Number 1: \"Once the deal is made, it is final\", Rule Number 2: \"No names\", and Rule Number 3: \"Never open the package.\" Frank inadvertently breaks his own rule, opens the package and finds a bound and gagged woman.\n\nFrank is working as the driver/chauffeur for a wealthy family, in the United States. Martin bonds with their young son, whom he drives to school every day. When the boy is kidnapped, Frank must again take action in order to protect his young \"package\" and his family. Eventually, Martin unravels a scheme involving biological weapons and the nefarious Gianni Chellini. Martin is forced to remove a bomb from the bottom of his car by executing an aerial corkscrew manoeuver underneath a crane. The crane catches the bomb and Martin escapes unharmed. Frank debuts the Audi A8 W12 in this film.\n\nInspector Tarconi plays an even more prominent role in this film. It is established that he and Frank are now friends, and Tarconi goes as far as to lie to the police to cover for Frank. His cooking prowess is established as well.\n\nFrank has been pressured into transporting Valentina (Natalya Rudakova) the kidnapped daughter of Leonid Vasilev (Jeroen Krabbé), the head of the Environmental Protection Agency for Ukraine, from Marseille through Stuttgart and Budapest until he ends up in Odessa on the Black Sea. Along the way, with the help of Inspector Tarconi (François Berléand), Frank has to contend with the people who strong armed him to take the job, agents sent by Vasilev to intercept him, and the general non-cooperation of his passenger, who he realises is the package mid-way through the film. Despite Valentina's cynical disposition and Frank's resistance to get involved, Frank and Valentina fall for each other, while escaping from one life-threatening situation after another. Martin again drives an armoured Audi A8 W12 in the film, as well as a BMX bicycle.\n\nIn May 2013, at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, a new reboot trilogy was announced with EuropaCorp and China's Fundamental Films co-producing and distributing the titles. The films will likely be budgeted between $30 million to $40 million each and at least one will be shot in China. Luc Besson will co-finance, distribute, produce and write all the films. English actor Ed Skrein replaced Jason Statham as Frank Martin on the fourth installment of the series. The fourth film, \"The Transporter Refueled\", was released in the United States on 4 September 2015 with Camille Delamarre directing.\n\n\"Transporter: The Series\" is a television series based on the Transporter films which premiered in 2012 on 11 October in Germany on RTL, and on 6 December in France on M6. Chris Vance took over the role of Frank from Jason Statham and was joined by Hungarian actress Andrea Osvárt, who played Carla, the leading female role in the series, starring as a former Intelligence agent who organises his missions, and French actor François Berléand, the only returning actor from the film series, who reprised his role as Inspector Tarconi.\nThe show was initially supposed to premiere on the cable network Cinemax but Cinemax pulled out due to production problems. TNT picked up the show and aired the 12-episode first season on the TNT network. TNT also ordered a 12-episode second season which aired in the autumn of 2014.\n\nFrank Martin is the protagonist of the films and television series. He initially serves as a reluctant hero. He is portrayed as a former Special Forces operative who was a team leader of a search and destroy unit. His military background includes operations \"in and out of\" Lebanon, Syria and Sudan. He retires from this after becoming fatigued and disenchanted with his superior officers. In simple terms, he got tired of seeing his best efforts turned to nothing by the same people paying him to do the job. So he puts his skills to action as a private driver for hire.\n\n"}

{"id": "1015733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1015733", "title": "Ueno Zoo", "text": "Ueno Zoo\n\nThe is a zoo, managed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, and located in Taitō, Tokyo, Japan. It is Japan's oldest zoo, opening on March 20, 1882. It is a five-minute walk from the Park Exit of Ueno Station, with convenient access from Tokyo's public-transportation network. The Ueno Zoo Monorail, the first monorail in the country, connects the eastern and western parts of the grounds.\n\nThe zoo is in Ueno Park, a large urban park that is home to museums, a small amusement park, and other attractions. The zoo is closed Mondays (Tuesday if Monday is a holiday).\n\nThe zoo started life as a menagerie attached to the National Museum of Natural History. In 1881, responsibility for this menagerie was handed to naturalist and civil servant Tanaka Yoshio, who oversaw its transition into a public zoo. The ground was originally estate of the imperial family, but was to the municipal government in 1924 — along with Ueno Park — on the occasion of crown prince Hirohito's wedding.\n\nIn August 1943, the administrator of Tokyo, Shigeo Ōdachi, ordered that all \"wild and dangerous animals\" at the zoo be killed, claiming that bombs could hit the zoo and escaping wild animals would wreak havoc in the streets of Tokyo. Requests by the staff at the zoo for a reprieve, or to evacuate the animals elsewhere, were refused. The animals were executed primarily by poisoning, strangulation or by simply placing the animals on starvation diets. A memorial service was held for the animals in September 1943 (while two of the elephants were still starving) and a permanent memorial (built anew in 1975) can be found in the Ueno Zoo.\n\nShortly after the March 1945 bombings of Tokyo, the Japanese placed U.S. Army Air Force navigator and bombardier Ray \"Hap\" Halloran on display naked in a Ueno Zoo tiger cage so civilians could walk in front of the cage and view the B-29 prisoner.\n\nThe zoo provides animals an environment similar to the natural habitat. In recent years, the old-fashioned cages of the past have been replaced with modern habitats, such as the \"Gorilla Woods,\" built after two well-publicized mishaps in 1999.\n\nThe zoo is home to more than 3,000 individuals representing over 400 species. The Sumatran tiger, and western lowland gorilla head the list of the zoo's population. Ueno has more species on exhibition than any other zoo in Japan.\n\nThe zoo is also home to zebras, Japanese macaques, red-crowned cranes, white-tailed eagles and king penguins, along with goats, sheep, pigs, llamas, ostriches, and rabbits.\n\nAt some point, redistribution of the animals among Tokyo's other zoos (including Tama Zoo and Inokashira Nature Park) left Ueno without a lion. However, in response to public demand, Ueno borrowed a female from the Yokohama Municipal Zoo. \n\nAfter the death of Giant panda Ling Ling in 2008, Ueno Zoo was without a member of this species for the first time since 1972. Two new giant pandas arrived from the Chinese Wolong Nature Reserve in February 2011. The male panda, Billy (比力 ビーリー) was renamed in Ueno to Līlī (力力 リーリー) to emphasize his playful vitality. The female's name Siennyu (仙女 シィエンニュ ‘Fairy’) was changed to Shinshin (真真 シンシン), referring to purity (純真) and innocence (天真). The new names were based on a public poll. The final choices picked by the zoo were, however, not among top choices. Reduplication is very common in panda names.\n\nOther animals housed at the zoo include Asiatic lions, Polar bears, Asian elephants, gorillas, Reticulated giraffes, Sumatran tigers, otters, red foxes, bats, toucans, tapirs, kangaroos, California sea lions, koalas, penguins, sun bears, flamingos, pangolins, slow lorises, southern three-banded armadillos, fennec foxes, pygmy hippos, hippos, okapis, anteaters, crocodiles, turtles, lemurs, pelicans, puffins and black rhinoceroses.\n\n\n"}

It is a style of Argentine music and Argentine folk dance. Zamba is very different from its homophone, the samba - musically, rhythmically, temperamentally, in the steps of the dance and in its costume. It has six beats to the bar and is a majestic dance, performed by couples who circle each other waving white handkerchiefs very elegantly. It has common elements with the cueca.\n\nZambas are composed about every genre, from those that celebrate people or events of Argentine history, to those that describe the beauty of a region, or of its women. There are zambas of political protest, and even one called \"Aerolíneas Argentinas\". The \"bombo legüero\" drum is prominent in the playing of the zamba.\n\nThe name \"zamba\" refers to a colonial term for zambo (people that are descendants of Amerindian and African people). It is therefore called zamba because its lyrical content was aimed at its native listeners.\n\nThe dance originated in the Argentine province of Salta in the Creole genre known as the zamacueca of Peru, in 1824 at the same time that Peru, under José de San Martín, obtained independence. It came to Argentina through \"Alto Peru,\" a region that is modern day Bolivia and through Chile between 1825 and 1830.\n\nThe Zamba is a slow dance in three-quarter time played primarily on guitar and bombo legüero. The steps of the dance are a walking step, an alternate step (two steps at one time), and a tip toe alternate step or \"sobrepaso punteado\" (three steps at one time). The Zamba also requires a handkerchief.\n\nToday Zamba is frequently danced in the streets of Argentina and always danced in Argentine folklore parties and festivals.It is performed during the national holidays of Argentina.\n\n"}
