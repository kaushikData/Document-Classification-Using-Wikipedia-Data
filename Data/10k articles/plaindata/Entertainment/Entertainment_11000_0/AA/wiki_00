{"id": "4162675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4162675", "title": "Bad Influence!", "text": "Bad Influence!\n\nBad Influence! is an early to mid-1990s British factual television programme broadcast on CITV between 1992 and 1996, and was produced in Leeds by Yorkshire Television (now known as ITV Studios). It looked at video games and computer technology, and was described as a \"kid’s Tomorrow's World\". It was shown on Thursday afternoons and had a run of four series of between 13 and 15 shows, each of 20 minutes duration. For three of the four series, it had the highest ratings of any CITV programme at the time. Its working title was \"Deep Techies\", a colloquial term derived from 'techies' basically meaning technology-obsessed individuals. The show's finished title was a reference to how video games were often viewed by the UK press at the time.\n\n\"Bad Influence!\" began during the 16 bit-era of computer and video gaming, and featured in-depth news, previews and reviews about the very latest in gaming and computer technology. The series ran long enough to feature the launch of the Nintendo 64 console (then acknowledged by its working title, the Ultra 64) in its fourth and final series. The show was originally presented by then children's TV presenters Violet Berlin and Andy Crane (of 1980s CBBC Broom Cupboard fame [The Broom Cupboard being the nickname for the CBBC's continuity announcer's booth]), who were studio based, and US teen actor Z Wright, who filed location reports from the US until Series 4. There was also a cheats segment character called Nam Rood (played by Andy Wear), an anarchic \"furtler\" who lived in a shed in the first two series, and then in the basement for Series 3. He would give viewers gaming cheats (written on cards he would stick to his forehead) in between mock experiment comedy sketches three times per episode. He would always greet viewers with his trademark catchphrases \"slimy furtlers\" and \"scrotty furtlers\", the term \"furtler\" equating to the term \"techie\".\n\nOther features included three game reviews per episode by teenagers local to the area where Bad Influence! was produced, namely the city of Leeds in West Yorkshire. Although these teenagers stints on the show varied, a small number appeared in all four series of the programme. Each game was given two separate scores, one from the girls and one from the boys. Although the majority of mid-programme reports were filed from the US by Z Wright, they were sometimes filed by Violet Berlin and on rare occasions by Andy Crane, in place of Z Wright. The programme usually focused on PC and Amiga segments early on in an episode, with more console-based segments later on. There was also a weekly competition towards the end of the programme, directly before one of the show's most distinctive features - the 'Datablast' sequence. The Datablast - which viewers were encouraged to record on their video recorders - consisted of a number of pages of gaming articles and information that were flashed rapidly onto the screen during the credits. Viewers could then read the pages by replaying it in slow motion on their video player. The information consisted of a watered down version of most of that episodes features, as well as some exclusive content, such as Top Ten video games charts.\n\nIn Series 1, a spin-off Bad Influence! magazine was launched by Europress and promoted on the show, however only two editions were ever published.\n\nIn Series 2, as part of a report, Violet Berlin was included as a character in the Mega Drive game Micro Machines 2. She was also included in another video game in Series 4.\n\nIn Series 3, the show experienced a revamp. The virtual reality title sequence and credits, which by the end of Series 2 had begun to look somewhat dated, were replaced by a new, industrial-style title sequence, influenced by the mega-flop beat-em-up Rise of the Robots. There was also a remixed, industrial-style theme tune and a slightly more anarchic feel to the show, suggesting it was now targeting a slightly older teen audience. This demographic refocusing was in tune with gaming trends which were moving more towards older teens and younger adults, yet at odds with CITV viewer trends which showed that CITV audiences were actually getting younger. Also in Series 3, the Datablast section only appeared once, at the end of the series, which would prove to be its final appearance. Also making their final appearance were Z Wright and Nam Rood.\n\nIn Series 4, the final series, Z Wright had been replaced by Violet Berlin presenting global reports (rather than solely US reports) and she was also granted her own slot, called Virtual Violet. Back in the studio, Crane was now joined by new co-presenter Sonya Saul. Nam Rood and the Datablast had both been discarded. In the final edition, Berlin, Crane and Saul all presented together in the studio, the only time this ever occurred.\n\nShortly after the 4th series ended, a report on the now defunct television information service Teletext reported that plans were afoot to remarket Bad Influence! at a younger audience if it were to get a Series 5. However these plans were never implemented, most likely because gamers were getting older whilst CITV's audience was getting younger, and so would have had little appeal to CITV's increasingly younger audience. Subsequently, a fifth series was not commissioned and the show was axed.\n"}

He had one older brother, Allen Jacobson.\n\nParks' had his first experience in amateur theatre when he was four years old. He graduated from Marist College, a Catholic preparatory school in Atlanta Georgia.\n\nParks entered radio broadcasting at age 16, for Atlanta's WGST. Three years later, he moved to New York City and was hired as a singer and straight man on \"The Eddie Cantor Show\", then becoming a CBS Radio staff announcer. Parks was the host of \"Break the Bank\", which premiered on radio in 1945 and was telecast from 1948 to 1957, as well as \"Stop the Music\" on radio in 1948 and television from 1949 to 1952. The success of \"Stop the Music\" took a toll on the ratings of the popular radio show hosted by satirist Fred Allen, who began spoofing Parks's program with skits mocking the premise of the show, one called \"Cease The Melody.\"\n\nWith other celebrities, he hosted NBC radio's \"Monitor\" during the 1960s.\n\nParks' first game show was \"Party Line\" on NBC (broadcast from New York City NBC flagship station WNBT), which involved viewers calling in to answer questions and win $5 prizes; \"Party Line\" ran from June 8 to August 31, 1947, making its one surviving episode the oldest known game show and one of the oldest surviving television shows to have been recorded. Commercial kinescopes did not come out until fall 1947 (co-sponsored by NBC, DuMont, and Kodak), and the only kinescopes known to predate \"Party Line\" are a few episodes of \"Kraft Television Theater\" from February and June 1947.\n\nOther games that Parks hosted in early television include \"Stop the Music\" (1949-52/1954-56), \"Double or Nothing\" (1952–54), \"Balance Your Budget\" (1952–53), \"Two in Love\" (1954), \"Giant Step\" (1956–57), \"Hold That Note\" (1957), \"Bid 'n' Buy\" (1958), \"County Fair\" (1958–59), \"Masquerade Party\" (1958–60), \"The Big Payoff\" (1959), \"Yours for a Song\" (1961–63), and the pilot for \"Hollywood Squares\" (April 21, 1965). His last game show hosting job was in 1968, on the pilot for a revival of Heatter-Quigley's \"The Celebrity Game\"; the show did not sell.\n\nHe also helmed a daytime variety show in 1950, simply called \"The Bert Parks Show\". In addition, he also starred in a syndicated series called \"Circus!\" (featuring various circus acts from around the world) in the early 1970s. Parks also appeared in a 1976 episode of \"The Bionic Woman\" as the nefarious host of the \"Miss United States\" beauty pageant, involved in a plot to sell national security technology.\n\nHowever, Parks is most famous for hosting the Miss America telecast from 1955–79, after which he was unceremoniously fired by the organization (he heard a newscast while on vacation) in an attempt to attract a more youthful audience. \"The Tonight Show\" host Johnny Carson led an on-air campaign to get Parks rehired, but was unsuccessful. In 1990, for the 70th anniversary of the Miss America pageant (during which Miss America 1991 was crowned), Parks was brought on by host Gary Collins to sing \"There She Is\" to the new Miss America, Marjorie Judith Vincent. It was the last time Parks performed the song live.\n\nParks' last known television appearance, a Pepsi commercial, first aired in June 1991.\n\nA recording of \"There She Is, Miss America\" as sung by Parks was used each year in the Miss America scholarship pageant until 2012 as the new reigning titleholder takes her walk down the runway in her newly earned crown. On September 13, 2015, the recording was reused for the 95th Anniversary of the Miss America pageant.\n\nParks did a take-off of his hosting role in \"The Freshman\" (1990), starring Marlon Brando, Matthew Broderick and Bruno Kirby. He played the emcee of a Gourmet Club dinner where guests supposedly eat a Komodo dragon, singing a spoof of \"There She Is\" in a salute to the soon-to-be-deceased dragon. Some of his other film appearances were in \"That's the Way of the World\" (1975) and \"The Great Balloon Race\" (1977).\n\nParks appeared on \"WKRP in Cincinnati\" in the 1980 episode \"Herb's Dad\", playing Herb Tarlek Sr. (father of series' regular Herb Tarlek Jr.). In 1988, Parks appeared on an episode of \"227\" as himself, and in 1991, Parks appeared on an episode of \"Night Court\" as himself.\n\nParks died of lung cancer at La Jolla, California on February 2, 1992 at the age of 77. He was survived by his wife of 49 years, Annette (Liebman) Parks (June 28, 1921 – December 19, 2013), and their three children.\n\n"}

{"id": "5042460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5042460", "title": "Cage Rage Championships", "text": "Cage Rage Championships\n\nCage Rage Championships, also known as Cage Rage, was a United Kingdom-based, mixed martial arts promotion that premiered on 7 September 2002 in London. Cage Rage went into liquidation and is now no longer trading. Cage Rage had been owned and managed by Elite XC until that company ceased operating, and the British promoters behind Cage Rage formed a new organization and withdrew all the old Cage Rage titles. Matchmaker and on-screen personality Dave O'Donnell was also a minority shareholder in the company. Fellow on-screen personality and co-promoter Andy Geer also owned a minority stake until he left the promotion in 2008. Cage Rage events were replayed on Nuts TV, along with their own weekday show on The Fight Network (UK & Ireland) until these channels closed down. Every Cage Rage event and bout is now archived as part of the UFC FIGHT PASS library.\n\nCage Rage started when Alex Jones and Tom Bell set out to raise money by promoting a small mixed martial arts show, to provide new mats for their martial arts school. The first Cage Rage event in Elephant and Castle, London was a success, which led to fans and fighters asking for a follow up show, leading to further shows and promotion as it exists today.\n\nIn March 2007, after the purchase of PRIDE Fighting Championships by Frank Fertitta III and Lorenzo Fertitta from Dream Stage Entertainment, Cage Rage were announced as members of a promotional alliance instigated by ProElite and FEG, the parent companies of EliteXC and Hero's respectively, along with Strikeforce, BodogFight K-1 and Spirit MC.\n\nHowever, this working relationship barely lasted a month. When Cage Rage signed K-1 star Bob Sapp to a main event in London for their show on 21 April 2007, K-1 stopped Sapp from fighting on the card. This left a desperate Geer and O'Donnell scrambling for a new main event on just days notice with aged veteran Tank Abbott eventually stepping in.\n\nDue to the closeness of the two promotions, ProElite purchased the majority shareholding in Cage Rage in September 2007 from Cage Rage's silent partner John Faraday.\n\nAndy Geer Left the group he founded in April 2008, and was replaced by former King of the Cage boss Christopher Cordeiro.\n\nIn May 2008, Sky Sports said in a statement they would no longer be airing Cage Rage events on their channels. The official line was that they could not continue with Cage Rage as a fighter (Paul Daley) had sworn on live TV on a previous show. However, this was thought to be an excuse as the incident (where Daley used several sexual cursewords) took place well after the 9pm \"watershed\". Much more likely Sky was disappointed with the average 19,000 viewers Cage Rage was getting.\n\nSince the closure of Cage Rage, Dave O'Donnell created Cage Rage UK, the parent company of another Mixed Martial Arts promotion, Ultimate Challenge MMA (UCMMA).\n\nCage Rage's rules were based upon the \"Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts\" that were originally established by the New Jersey State Athletic Control Board and modified by the Nevada State Athletic Commission. These rules were adopted across the US in other states that regulate mixed martial arts. As a result, they became the standard \"de facto\" set of rules for professional mixed martial arts across the US and for cage-based MMA worldwide.\n\nAt Cage Rage 13, amendments to the \"Unified Rules\" were made, most notably\nthe \"Open Guard\" rule and the banning of elbow strikes to a downed opponent.\n\nAll Cage Rage fights were contested over three, five-minute rounds, with a one-minute rest period in-between rounds.\n\nCage Rage had six weight classes:\n\nCage Rage used an eight-sided caged arena to stage bouts similar to the UFC's trademarked Octagon, though it was smaller in size. It had foam padding around the top and between each of the eight sections, with two entry/exit gates on opposite sides. The canvas was marked with a line a metre away from the fence at all points.\n\nAs per the \"Unified Rules of MMA\", Cage Rage only allowed competitors to fight in approved shorts, without shoes or any other sort of foot padding. Fighters used approved light gloves (4-6 ounces) that allow fingers to grab.\n\nMatches usually end via:\n\nA fight can also end in a technical decision, technical draw, disqualification, forfeit or no contest.\n\nThe 10-point must system was used for all Cage Rage fights; three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points, the loser nine points or less. If the round is even, both fighters receive ten points. The decision is announced at the end of the match but the judge's scorecards are not announced.\n\nThe following are considered fouls in Cage Rage:\n\n\nWhen a foul is charged, the referee in their discretion may deduct one or more points as a penalty. If a foul incapacitates a fighter, then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a no contest if unintentional. If a foul causes a fighter to be unable to continue later in the bout, it ends with a technical decision win to the injured fighter if the injured fighter is ahead on points, otherwise it is a technical draw.\n\nThe referee has the right to stop the fighters and stand them up if they reach a stalemate on the ground (where neither are in a dominant position nor working toward one) after a verbal warning.\n\nCage Rage was the home of a unique rule in the world of cage-based MMA; the \"open guard\" rule. Designed to prevent stalling on the ground, it allowed a standing fighter to use strikes on a downed opponent that would otherwise be fouls.\n\nIf a downed fighter was at least a meter away from the cage, on his back and able to avoid or defend against attacks, the referee would raise his arm and call \"open guard\". Once an open guard was called, the standing fighter could use the following attacks on their opponent:\n\nUnless an open guard has been called, these strikes were fouls.\n\nThis rule was introduced at Cage Rage 13 and was designed to prevent a fighter from laying in an open guard where his opponent can only throw leg kicks or drop to initiate grappling. However, due to their ongoing desire to standardise rules across the UK and work with a potential MMA board of control, this rule was scrapped.\n\nThe first Cage Rage event featured top British fighters, such as Matt Ewin and Robbie Olivier, and international fighters, such as Chute Boxe Academy-trained Jean Silva. This formula has continued down the years since the first show, with such top domestic fighters like Ian Freeman and Michael Bisping appearing, as well as internationally-known fighters like Murilo Rua and Anderson Silva.\n\nCage Rage 26 was the first main Cage Rage show to be held outside London.\n\nIn early 2006, Cage Rage Championships launched Cage Rage Contenders, a secondary-level show for up-and-coming fighters to showcase their skills. Trying to conjure up the feel of early Cage Rage shows, these shows take place in a nightclub setting with VIP tables surrounding the cage.\n\nCage Rage also aimed to franchise the Contenders name to other promoters across the country, the first promoter of which was Jay Gilbey of Intense Fighting in Peterborough.\n\nSince then, Contenders shows have been expanded to Ireland, Wales and Nottingham.\n\nThe following fighters (in alphabetical order) have won titles in Cage Rage and are well known in the world of MMA.\nNon-titleholders who have competed in other top-level promotions.\n"}

He first came to public attention in 1843 as an accordion player at the Thalian Hall at 42 Grand Street. That summer, he joined the \"Kentucky Minstrels\" troupe at the Vauxhall Garden Theatre on Fourth Avenue.\n\nAfter Daddy Rice popularized blackface with his Jim Crow character White first incorporated some \"negro act\" with his accordion playing and then founded White's Kitchen Minstrels in New York in the early 1840s, opening at the Melodeon on the Bowery.

{"id": "70393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70393", "title": "Countertenor", "text": "Countertenor\n\nA countertenor (also contra tenor) is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range is equivalent to that of the female contralto or mezzo-soprano voice types, generally extending from around G to D or E, although a sopranist (a specific kind of countertenor) may match the soprano's range of around C to C. Countertenors often are baritones or tenors at core, but on rare occasions use this vocal range in performance.\n\nThe nature of the counter-tenor voice has radically changed throughout musical history, from a modal voice, to a modal and falsetto voice, to the primarily falsetto voice which is denoted by the term today. This is partly because of changes in human physiology and partly because of fluctuations in pitch.\n\nThe term first came into use in England during the mid-17th century and was in wide use by the late 17th century. However, the use of adult male falsettos in polyphony, commonly in the soprano range, was known in European all-male sacred choirs for some decades previous, as early as the mid-16th century. Modern-day ensembles such as The Tallis Scholars and The Sixteen have counter-tenors on alto parts in works of this period. There is no evidence that falsetto singing was known in Britain before the early 17th century, when it was occasionally heard on soprano parts.\n\nDuring the Romantic period, the popularity of the countertenor voice waned and few compositions were written with that voice type in mind.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, there was great interest in and renewed popularity of the countertenor voice, partly due to pioneers such as Alfred Deller, as well as the increased popularity of Baroque opera and the need of male singers to replace the castrati roles in such works. Although the voice has been considered largely an early music phenomenon, there is a growing modern repertoire.\n\nIn polyphonic compositions of the 14th and early 15th centuries, the \"contratenor\" was a voice part added to the basic two-part contrapuntal texture of discant (\"superius\") and tenor (from the Latin \"tenere\" which means to hold, since this part \"held\" the music's melody, while the \"superius\" descanted upon it at a higher pitch). Though having approximately the same range as the tenor, it was generally of a much less melodic nature than either of these other two parts. With the introduction in about 1450 of four-part writing by composers such as Ockeghem and Obrecht, the \"contratenor\" split into \"contratenor altus\" and \"contratenor bassus\", which were respectively above and below the tenor. Later the term became obsolete: in Italy, \"contratenor altus\" became simply \"altus\", in France, \"haute-contre\", and in England, countertenor. Though originally these words were used to designate a vocal part, they are now used to describe singers of that part, whose vocal techniques may differ (see below).\n\nIn the Catholic Church during the Renaissance, St Paul's admonition \"mulieres in ecclesiis taceant\" (\"let the women keep silence in the churches\") still prevailed, and women were banned from singing in church services. Countertenors, though rarely described as such, therefore found a prominent part in liturgical music, whether singing a line alone or with boy trebles or altos. (Spain had a long tradition of male falsettists singing soprano lines). However, countertenors were never used for roles in early opera, the rise of which coincided with the arrival of a fashion for castrati. For example, they took several roles in the first performance of Monteverdi's \"L'Orfeo\" (1607). Castrati were already prominent by this date in Italian church choirs, replacing both falsettists and trebles; the last soprano falsettist singing in Rome, Juan [Johannes de] San[c]tos (a Spaniard), died in 1652. In Italian opera, by the late seventeenth century castrati predominated, while in France, the modal high tenor, called the \"haute-contre\", was established as the voice of choice for leading male roles.\n\nIn England Purcell wrote significant music for a higher male voice that he called a \"counter-tenor\", for example, the roles of Secrecy and Summer in \"The Fairy-Queen\" (1692). \"These lines have often challenged modern singers, who have been unsure whether they are high tenor parts or are meant for falsettists\". Contemporary vocal treatises, however, make clear that Purcell’s singers would have been trained to blend both methods of vocal production. In Purcell's choral music the situation is further complicated by the occasional appearance of more than one solo part designated \"countertenor\", but with a considerable difference in range and tessitura. Such is the case in \"Hail, bright Cecilia\" (\"The Ode on St Cecilia's Day 1692\") in which the solo, \"'Tis Nature's Voice,\" has the range F to B (similar to those stage roles cited previously), whereas, in the duet, \"Hark each tree,\" the countertenor soloist sings from E to D (in the trio \"With that sublime celestial lay\". Later in the same work, Purcell's own manuscript designates the same singer, Mr Howel, described as \"a High Contra tenor\" to perform in the range G to C; it is very likely that he took some of the lowest notes in a well-blended \"chest voice\" – see below).\n\n\"The Purcell counter-tenor 'tenor' did not flourish in England much beyond the early years of the [eighteenth] century; within twenty years of Purcell's death Handel had settled in London and \"opera seria\", which was underpinned entirely by Italian singing, soon became entrenched in British theatres\". In parallel, by Handel's time, castrati had come to dominate the English operatic stage as much as that of Italy (and indeed most of Europe outside France). They also took part in several of Handel's oratorios, though countertenors, too, occasionally featured as soloists in the latter, the parts written for them being closer in compass to the higher ones of Purcell, with a usual range of A to E. They also sang the alto parts in Handel's choruses. It was as choral singers within the Anglican church tradition (as well as in the secular genre of the glee) that countertenors survived as performers throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Otherwise they largely faded from public notice.\n\nThe most visible person of the countertenor revival in the twentieth century was Alfred Deller, an English singer and champion of authentic early music performance. Deller initially identified as an \"alto\", but his collaborator Michael Tippett recommended the archaic term \"countertenor\" to describe his voice. In the 1950s and 60s, his group, the Deller Consort, was important in increasing audiences' awareness (and appreciation) of Renaissance and Baroque music. Deller was the first modern countertenor to achieve fame and has had many prominent successors. Benjamin Britten wrote the leading role of Oberon in his setting of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (1960) especially for Deller. The countertenor role of Apollo in Britten's \"Death in Venice\" (1973) was created by James Bowman, the best-known amongst the next generation of English countertenors. Russell Oberlin was Deller's American counterpart and another early music pioneer. Oberlin's success was entirely unprecedented in a country that did not have much experience of performance of works prior to Bach, and it paved the way for the great success of countertenors following him. Oberlin, however, harked back to the earlier tradition of countertenors using only their modal voices.\n\nToday, countertenors are much in demand in many forms of classical music. In opera, many roles originally written for castrati (castrated males) are now sung and recorded by countertenors, as are some trouser roles originally written for female singers. The former category is much more numerous and includes Orfeo in Gluck's \"Orfeo ed Euridice\" and many Handel roles, such as the name parts in \"Giulio Cesare\" and \"Orlando\", and Bertarido in \"Rodelinda\". Mozart also had castrati roles in his early operas, including Amintas in \"Il re pastore\" and Cecilio in \"Lucio Silla\".\n\nMany modern composers other than Britten have written, and continue to write, countertenor parts, both in choral works and opera, as well as songs and song-cycles for the voice. Men's choral groups such as Chanticleer and The King's Singers employ the voice to great effect in a variety of genres, including early music, gospel, and even folk songs. Other recent operatic parts written for the countertenor voice include Edgar in Aribert Reimann's \"Lear\" (1978), the messenger in his \"Medea\" (2010), the title role in Philip Glass's \"Akhnaten\" (1983), Claire in John Lunn's \"The Maids\" (1998), the Refugee in Jonathan Dove's \"Flight\" (1998), Trinculo in Thomas Adès's \"The Tempest\" (2004), the Boy in George Benjamin's \"Written on Skin\" (2012) and several others (see Roles in opera below).\n\nThe vocal range of a countertenor is equivalent to that of the female contralto or mezzo-soprano voice types. A trained countertenor will typically have a vocal center similar in placement to that of a contralto or mezzo-soprano. Peter Giles, a professional countertenor and noted author on the subject, defines the countertenor as a musical part rather than as a vocal style or mechanism. In modern usage, the term \"countertenor\" is essentially equivalent to the medieval term \"contratenor altus\" (see above). In this way, a countertenor singer can be operationally defined as a man who sings the countertenor part, whatever vocal style or mechanism is employed. The countertenor range is generally equivalent to an alto range, extending from approximately G to D or E. In comparison to female voices the male voice usually has an extended range towards the low notes, but the lowest parts of the range are usually not used. In actual practice, it is generally acknowledged that a majority of countertenors sing with a falsetto vocal production for at least the upper half of this range, although most use some form of \"chest voice\" (akin to the range of their speaking voice) for the lower notes. The most difficult challenge for such a singer is managing the lower middle range, for there are normally a few notes (around B) that can be sung with either vocal mechanism, and the transition between registers must somehow be blended or smoothly managed.\n\nIn response to the (in his view) pejorative connotation of the term falsetto, Giles refuses to use it, calling the upper register \"head voice.\" Many voice experts would disagree with this choice of terminology, reserving the designation \"head voice\" for the high damped register accompanied by a relatively low larynx that is typical of modern high operatic tenor voice production. The latter type of head voice is, in terms of the vocal cord vibration, actually more similar to \"chest voice\" than to falsetto, since it uses the same \"speaking voice\" production (referred to as \"modal\" by voice scientists), and this is reflected in the timbre.\n\nParticularly in the British choral tradition, the terms \"male soprano\" and \"male alto\" serve to identify men who rely on falsetto vocal production, rather than the modal voice, to sing in the soprano or alto vocal range. Elsewhere, the terms have less universal currency. Some authorities do accept them as descriptive of male falsettists, although this view is subject to controversy; they would reserve the term \"countertenor\" for men who, like Russell Oberlin, achieve a soprano range voice with little or no falsetto, equating it with \"haute-contre\" and the Italian \"tenor altino\". Adherents to this view maintain that a countertenor will have unusually short vocal cords and consequently a higher speaking voice and lower range and tessitura than their falsettist counterparts, perhaps from D to D. Operatic vocal classification, on the other hand, prefers the terms \"countertenor\" and \"sopranist\" to \"male soprano\" and \"male alto,\" and some scholars consider the latter two terms inaccurate owing to physiological differences between male and female vocal production. The only known man who can claim to be a true male soprano by that definition is Michael Maniaci, whose modal voice falls in the soprano range, akin to a woman's, because his larynx did not develop fully in puberty.\n\nNotable countertenor roles include:\n\n\n\n"}

Since Medieval ages, European dances tend to be refined, as they are based on the court dances of aristocrats.\n\nIn ancient times, European dances were performed as either sacred dances in religious ceremonies or for popular entertainment.\n\nGreek dance included religious worship, education, religious or civil ceremonies and festivities. One famous Greek dance is the dithyramb, in honor of Dionysus.\n\nOriginally Rome had exclusively religious dances. As Rome gained dominance, including conquering Greece, more dance traditions were absorbed. The Bacchanalia and Lupercalia festivals highlight the importance of dance in Rome.\n\nUnder Christianity, dance fell under the control and condemnation of the Church. Records of Medieval dance are fragmented and limited, but a noteworthy dance reference from the medieval period is the allegory of the Danse Macabre.\n\nDuring the Renaissance, dance became more diverse. Country dances, performed for pleasure, became distinct from court dances, which had ceremonial and political functions.\n\nIn Germany, from a modified ländler, the waltz was introduced in all the European courts. Thus, group dance gives way to couples dance.\n\nThe 16th century Queen of France Catherine de' Medici promoted and popularized dance in France. Catherine helped develop the \"ballet de cour.\" The production of the \"Ballet Comique de la Reine\" in 1581 is regarded by scholars as the first authentic ballet.\n\nIn the 17th century, the French minuet, characterized by its bows, courtesies and gallant gestures, permeated the European cultural landscape.\n\nGermany does not have an official national dance, but recognized dance styles include:\n\n"}
{"id": "718645", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=718645", "title": "Extreme Ghostbusters", "text": "Extreme Ghostbusters\n\nExtreme Ghostbusters is an American animated television series and a follow-up to the animated series \"The Real Ghostbusters\". It is a part of the \"Ghostbusters\" franchise. The series originally aired in late 1997, and features a team of younger college-level Ghostbusters who are led by veteran Ghostbuster Egon Spengler. In some TV listings, the show was called \"Ghostbusters Dark\".\n\nSet years after the end of \"The Real Ghostbusters\", lack of supernatural activity has put the Ghostbusters out of business. Each member has gone their separate way, except for Dr. Egon Spengler, who still lives in the firehouse to monitor the containment unit, take care of Slimer, further his studies and teach a class on the paranormal at a local college. When ghosts start to reappear, Egon is forced to recruit his lone four students as the new Ghostbusters. These are Kylie Griffin, a goth girl genius and expert on the occult; Eduardo Rivera, a cynical Latino slacker; Garrett Miller, a young white paraplegic athlete who uses a wheelchair; and Roland Jackson, a studious African-American machinery whiz. Filling the cast are Janine Melnitz, the Ghostbusters' previous secretary who returns to the job, and Slimer, a hungry ghost.\n\nThe series follows the adventures of this \"Next Generation\" of Ghostbusters tracking down and capturing ghosts all over New York and occasionally beyond the city. The series is styled as a supernatural comedy, following the trend set by its predecessor, but given an updated and darker feel. This is reflected by the use of a gritty, rock/punk-inspired variation of Ray Parker, Jr.'s song \"Ghostbusters\" as the opening theme written by Jim Latham and performed by voice actor Jim Cummings. Recurring themes throughout the series are the new team learning to work together despite their differences, Janine's largely unrequited affection for Egon, the love-hate relationship between Kylie and Eduardo that is never resolved, and the Ghostbusters' frequent clashes with authority figures who disbelieve their work.\n\n\nShowrunner Bob Higgins told \"Ability Magazine\" that the decision to create a new \"Ghostbusters\" was taken by the studio, which hoped to reinvigorate a lucrative franchise. Originally announced as \"Super Ghostbusters\" in 1996, the initial press release had Janine, teaching history at a local college, bringing together a new team with \"a hip new attitude\" to face a new plague of ghosts; \"short on time and more than a little desperate, Janine turns to four of her teenaged students\". (Egon would be \"huddled in front of a computer screen, battling program bugs instead of spooks\".)\n\nThe show's creators decided \"what we wanted to do was really put together a team of misfits in a way, people that you would not necessarily associate with being superheroes on television\": hence Eduardo as a slacker, Roland as a \"square\", and Kylie as moody and sarcastic, with Garrett as the balance, \"an adrenaline junkie... who could kind of kick start the team\". Fil Barlow, the designer, was given rough outlines and originally designed all the characters bar Eduardo as girls (Garrett as Lucy and Roland as Julia), with Egon originally designed as bearded and robed. This aspect would be dropped. (Barlow pitched \"Egon as an ambassador to the ghost realm trying to stop an impending war on the other side\")\n\nDuring production, Lucy/Garrett was found to be quite bland and annoying until producer Jeff Kline suggested putting the character in a wheelchair; Higgins stated this made Garrett more interesting to write, as he was now \"one of these guys that takes what he is given and makes the best of it and really lives up to any potential that he has\". When designed as Lucy, she was given proton-blasting callipers and crutches but producer Richard Raynis requested the wheelchair instead. (Barlow attempted to show a female character could \"be fearless and gung ho\" but Raynis requested the gender change) The show ended up winning an award from the Los Angeles Commission on Disabilities for its work on Garrett.\n\nVarious elements would be changed before airing: Egon would replace Janine as the teacher, Slimer lost a goblin sidekick called Gnat, and Garrett was originally \"Lucas\". Roland was originally a clumsy \"gentle giant\", Eduardo had a dream of running in the Olympics, and Lucas had a hair-trigger temper. (Some of these still made it to the character profiles on the EGB website)\n\nThe team that helmed \"Extreme Ghostbusters\" consisted of many producers and writers that had done work on \"The Real Ghostbusters\", including Richard Raynis. As a result, the show was made as an explicit sequel to \"Real\". This made the show one of the few direct sequels to a 1980s cartoon series — other franchises, such as \"Masters of the Universe\" and \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\", opted for series relaunches — and as such opted for a more realistic passage of time. Maurice LaMarche was brought back to play Egon Spengler — though Frank Welker and Laura Summer did not return to play Slimer and Janine, respectively. The series would start to have more explicit tie-ins to \"Real\" as it went on — \"Slimer's Sacrifice\" referenced Egon entering the Containment Unit in an episode of \"Real Ghostbusters: Xmas Marks the Spot\"; \"Grundelesque,\" was a direct sequel to \"Real Ghostbusters\" episode \"The Grundel\", bringing back the eponymous villain and revealing Kylie lost a friend during its first attack. Finally and notably was the two-part finale \"Back in the Saddle\", which featured the remaining original Ghostbusters returning and teaming up with their successors — with Dave Coulier (the second voice of Peter Venkman), Buster Jones (the second voice of Winston Zeddemore), and Frank Welker (the voice of Ray Stantz) all reprising their roles.\n\nThe cartoon series generated a line of action figures released by Trendmasters. The line included Roland, Eduardo, Kylie, and several ghosts, as well as an updated version of Egon Spengler, and the Ecto-1; Garrett did not have a figure released, although collectors have found a prototype figure. Also released was a role playing Proton Pack and Ghost Trap.\n\nIn 1999, three VHS volumes of the show were released by Columbia TriStar Home Video, all of which are now out of print. These videotapes were available to purchase separately or as a packaged boxed set containing all three volumes. The episodes included on the VHS volumes were:\n\n\nA two disc DVD set of the series was released in Australia on June 2, 2009 and in the UK on June 15 the same year, along with Germany, Italy and The Netherlands, all containing the first thirteen episodes of the series, with the UK releases being slightly edited.\n\nThere is currently no plan to release the series on DVD in the United States.\n\nThe first series was re-released in the UK on the 27th of June 2016.\n\nThree video games based on the series were also created, \"Extreme Ghostbusters\" for the Game Boy Color, \"\" for Game Boy Advance and \"\" for the PlayStation. There are also two PC games: and Extreme Ghostbusters Creativity Centre.\n\nThe original website (still available online) contained a Flash tour of the Firehouse, character profiles, descriptions of the ghosts fought, and a Flash game. Some of the character details in the profiles had never made it into an episode.\n\nThe \"Spengler's Spirit Guide\" section contained journal entries by \"Egon\" himself, about haunted areas and the how-to of ghostbusting. Two of the entries, The Bermuda Triangle and The Jersey Devil, were topics that showed up in episodes.\n\nIn a retrospective of the show, \"SFX\" referred to the \"consensus that any extension of the \"Ghostbusters\" brand requires a whole new team of newbies to take on the mantle\" and that \"Extreme Ghostbusters\" was the first time it was put into practice. The failure of the show, blamed by the showrunners on poor US scheduling and the decline of non-educational children's syndication in favor of carriage on networks such as Fox Kids and Kids' WB and cable channels (\"broadcast mid-morning in a slot only suitable for pre-schools,\" though some American stations still did carry the show between 3:00pm and 5:00pm in the afterschool period), was seen by \"SFX\" as showing \"the appeal of Ghostbusters was only partially the concept... that it's the characters we love above all must be a sobering thought for anyone charged with rebooting \"Ghostbusters\" again.\" The show was also noted for being aimed at \"a slightly more adolescent audience with a tougher edge\", \"clearly intended to test the boundaries of child-friendly horror\" and the Eduardo/Kylie relationship pushed the edges of the ratings.\n\nThe character of Kylie Griffin appeared in the IDW comics in the 2010s.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "720474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=720474", "title": "Fire Emblem (video game)", "text": "Fire Emblem (video game)\n\nFire Emblem is a tactical role-playing game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance handheld video game console. It is the seventh entry in the \"Fire Emblem\" series, the second to be released for the platform after \"\", and the first to be localized for Western audiences. It was released in Japan and North America in 2003, and in Europe and Australia in 2004.\n\nThe game is a prequel to \"The Binding Blade\", set on the continent of Elibe. It tells the story of Lyn, Eliwood, and Hector, three young lords of the Lycian lineage who journey to find Eliwood's father and later thwart a larger conspiracy threatening the stability of Elibe. The gameplay, which draws from earlier \"Fire Emblem\" entries, features tactical combat between armies on a grid-based map. Characters are assigned different character classes that affect abilities and are subjected to permanent death if defeated in battle.\n\nDevelopment began in 2002 as a companion title to \"The Binding Blade\", but development was prolonged from its initial seven-month window as new features were added. While the \"Fire Emblem\" series had remained exclusive to Japan due to concerns about its difficulty, the success of \"Advance Wars\" and popular demand following the inclusion of \"Fire Emblem\" characters in \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" prompted the game's localization. The game was released to positive sales and international critical acclaim, establishing the \"Fire Emblem\" series in the West. Its overseas success fueled the development of \"\" for the GameCube home console.\n\n\"Fire Emblem\" is a tactical role-playing game where players take the role of story protagonists Lyn, Eliwood, and Hector as they navigate story-driven missions across the fictional continent of Elibe. The player takes the role of an unseen tactician directing the player army. The single-player campaign is divided into chapters which generally begin with story elements presented through the use of scenes animated with still images of the main characters, then followed by a battle with an enemy; after each battle, the player is given the opportunity to save their progress. In-game currency is gained either through battles in the game's various Arenas or through other means, rather than from defeating units. Currency can be used to buy new items and weapons at merchants at specific locations within maps. Items can also be exchanged between units during battles.\n\nBattles in the story take place on maps divided into a square-based grid. Battle actions are governed by a turn-based system where each unit on both sides is given their chance to move and act. During gameplay, weather and terrain effects appear such as fog of war or elements of the environment that can be manipulated to one side's advantage, affecting the progress of battle. Units are split between player, enemy and allied non-player character (NPC) units. Each unit's movement range and attack range is displayed when selected. The player must clear a map to advance the story: the objectives for clearing a level can vary from defeating all enemies to capturing strongholds or rescuing NPCs. When engaging a unit, the scene transitions into a battle between the player and enemy unit, with battle animation playing out. When hit with an attack, a character loses health points (HP). For player characters, HP can be restored with items or by units with healing magic; it can also be regained by standing on forts, gates or castles, or using a special spell that replenishes health based on damage dealt to an enemy.\n\nEach unit is governed by a character class system, with their class affecting what weapons they can use. After each action in battle gains experience points (EXP). Upon reaching 100 EXP, a unit levels up and its statistics such as attack power and defense are randomly raised, while weapon ranks increase naturally when using their respective weapons. Upon reaching Level 10, and using a special item, a unit's class can be upgraded to a more powerful version with access to new items and weapons. If a unit is defeated in battle, they are subject to permanent death, being removed from all future encounters and the overall storyline with a few exceptions for story-related characters. If characters crucial to the storyline like Lyn, Eliwood or Hector fall, the game ends and the player must restart the level.\n\nWeapon strengths and weaknesses are governed by the series' Weapons Triangle system; axes are strong against lances, lances strong against swords, and swords strong against axes. Bows are independent of the system, being effective against airborne units. A similar system, dubbed the Magic Trinity in-game, governs how different types of spells react; elemental magic is strong against light, light against dark and dark against elemental. The strength of weapon types assigned to a particular unit is raised through usage, with its rank ranging from E to S, with S being the highest possible affinity with a promoted character. Characters also have a Support system, where talking both in battle and outside during rest periods strengthens two characters' relationship, and consequently provides stat boosts. The higher the Support rank, which ranges from \"C\" to \"A\", the better the boons.\n\nOutside the main campaign, players can battle against the game's artificial intelligence (AI) in the Link Arena: after building a team, the player fights a battle against their own units controlled by the game AI. \"Fire Emblem\" also features a Link Arena multiplayer option in which up to four players can link up and do battle with teams of characters from the single-player save file. Players choose up to five characters and equip them like in the main story. During battle, each player takes turns to attack with one character. Weapons selected automatically for each battle Victory is determined either by surviving a period of time or aggregating the highest number of points.\n\nThe events of \"Fire Emblem\" take place on the fictional continent of Elibe, twenty years before the events of \"\": in ancient times, humans and dragons coexisted, but humans turned against and banished the dragons in a conflict called \"The Scouring\". The player adopts the perspective of a tactician who is found by a girl named Lyn. Lyn discovers that she is the granddaughter of the marquess of Caelin, Hausen. She recruits companions in a quest to prevent Lundgren, her great uncle, from ascending the Caelin throne. Lundgren had wanted to gain power by poisoning the current marquess; he also sent soldiers out to destroy Lyn and any knowledge of her as she is higher in the line of succession. Lyn eventually defeats Lundgren and reunites with her grandfather.\n\nThe following chapters revolve around the Lycian lords Eliwood, Hector and their party, which the tactician, (and eventually Lyn) joins. The group are hunting down an antagonistic faction known as the Black Fang, a group of assassins based in Bern. The Black Fang, manipulated by a mysterious figure named Nergal, are attempting to provoke a full-scale war in Elibe, providing Nergal with an enormous amount of \"quintessence\", or life-force from fallen warriors. Nergal creates his morphs, artificial beings with jet-black hair and golden eyes, to remotely control the Black Fang, and to obtain the quintessence for him. The Black Fang engage Eliwood's interest by capturing his father Lord Elbert, and by inciting rebellion in Lycia. The protagonists' ultimate goal is to prevent Nergal from using their companions Ninian's and Nils' quintessence to open the Dragons' Gate, a portal where dragons reside, and thus ignite Elibe in conflict. As Eliwood and the party hunt the Black Fang down, they eliminate crucial figures of the Black Fang, as well as gaining allies and protecting Bern's royal prince Zephiel (a younger version of the main antagonist from \"The Binding Blade\"). The game ends when Eliwood and the party slay Nergal and the dragon that had been summoned via Nergal's quintessence. Eliwood becomes marquess of Pherae, and Hector inherits his brother's title as marquess of Ostia. A secret ending shows an older Eliwood and Hector introducing their respective children Roy and Lilina to each other, while a grown-up Zephiel, now the king of Bern, is being confronted by a robed man who accuses him of awakening the Demon Dragon.\n\n\"Fire Emblem\", known in Japan as \"Fire Emblem: Rekka no Ken\", was created by series developer Intelligent Systems. Toru Narihiro and Takehiro Izushi from Intelligent Systems acted as producers, and Hitoshi Yamagami from Nintendo supervised, and Taeko Kaneda and Kentarou Nishimura directed. The script was written by Ken Yokoyama and Kouhei Maeda. Character designs were done by Sachiko Wada, who would reprise her role for \"\". A second artist on the project was Ryo Hirata, who had previously done illustration work for Production I.G and would go on to work on \"The Sacred Stones\". Eiji Kaneda, who worked on \"The Binding Blade\", did uncredited illustration work. Background graphics, particularly those for the Fire Dragons, were done by Daisuke Izuka. The music was composed by Yuka Tsujiyoko, who had worked on every game since the series' inception, although \"Fire Emblem\" would be her last work on the series as a composer. She was helped by Saki Haruyama.\n\nDevelopment of \"Fire Emblem\" began in 2002 after the release of \"The Binding Blade\". Intended as a companion title built upon the foundation of \"The Binding Blade\", development time was initially estimated at seven months. The storyline was built around three main characters and their strengths in battle; the central character Eliwood was made fairly weak to fit the concept of an \"easy\" mode for new players, while the other two characters provided both a steeper gameplay challenge and altered story segments. As with \"The Binding Blade\", the titular \"Fire Emblem\" is represented as a family crest. The gameplay, initially identical to \"The Binding Blade\", underwent multiple changes including expansions on the role of the player in the storyline through the unseen strategist character, and the added tutorial stages that helped introduce the mechanics to new players. It was also the first entry in the \"Fire Emblem\" series to introduce multiplayer functionality. Due to the multiple extra features, development overran substantially, ultimately lasting over a year. The tutorial was included because the game's steep difficulty was proving off-putting to new players; this inclusion was part of a move to make \"Fire Emblem\" a major series for Nintendo.\n\n\"Fire Emblem\" was first announced in early 2003. It was the second title in the \"Fire Emblem\" series to have been developed for the Game Boy Advance (GBA). The game was released on April 25, 2003. It was also compatible with the newly released Game Boy Advance SP, an upgraded version of the GBA. Prior to 2017, the game's Japanese subtitle was translated as \"The Sword of Flame\". In 2017, the subtitle was officially translated by Nintendo as \"The Blazing Blade\". The game was later released on the Virtual Console for Wii U on May 14, 2014.\n\nThe concept of localizing a \"Fire Emblem\" game in the West had been around for some time, but the combined elements of extensive use of text and a view that tactical RPGs would meet with low sales overseas had kept the series exclusive to Japan since its inception. Another major factor was the appearance of Roy from \"The Binding Blade\" and Marth from the in the 2001 fighting game \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\". The director of \"Melee\", Masahiro Sakurai, had wanted to include Marth since the original \"Super Smash Bros.\", and included him as part of a push for more sword-wielding characters. Gameplay-wise, Roy was included to act as a clone of Marth. There were difficulties including both Marth and Roy as the \"Fire Emblem\" series had not seen an overseas release at that point. Sakurai, with support from Nintendo of America, managed to keep both Marth and Roy in the game. The growing base of tactical role-playing games including \"Advance Wars\", in addition to the interest garnered by the appearance of Roy and Marth in \"Melee\", meant that Nintendo were more willing to bring \"Fire Emblem\" overseas. Speaking in a later interview, localization producer Tim O'Leary said that localizing the title was more difficult than its successor \"The Sacred Stones\", but was smaller in scale than \"\".\n\nA Western release was first hinted at in mid 2003, when it was listed on a leaked release list from Nintendo of America. It was first shown at the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo, along with a playable demo. For its Western release, the subtitle was removed, with it simply being dubbed \"Fire Emblem\". The game released in North America on November 3, 2003; in Australia on February 20, 2004; and in Europe on July 16. It was later re-released on Virtual Console for Wii U on August 21, 2014 in Europe; and in North America on December 4 of that year.\n\n\"Fire Emblem\" met with generally positive reviews from critics. On aggregate site Metacritic, \"Fire Emblem\" garnered a score of 88/100 based on 31 reviews. It was the 6th best-reviewed GBA title of 2003.\n\nJapanese magazine \"Famitsu\" praised the characters and felt it was a suitable addition to the \"Fire Emblem\" series, while Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell cited the storyline as being similar to better examples within the Japanese role-playing genre and its near-seamless integration with gameplay mechanics. \"GamePro\" reviewer Star Dingo called the narrative \"a complex (but not convoluted) classic fantasy yarn\", while GameSpot's Bethany Massimilla called the story standard while praising the writing and character development. Christian Nutt of GameSpy praised the writing as highly enjoyable for both the Japanese and Western releases, and IGN's Craig Harris believed that the game was superior to \"Advance Wars\" through its portrayal of characters despite some minor complaints about characters that remained alive for story reasons despite falling in battle. PALGN reviewer Andrew Burns commented that the story gained a serious edge once Lyn's opening story arc was completed.\n\nSpeaking about the gameplay, \"Famitsu\" was slightly mixed about some aspects; one critic praised the added tutorial for allowing new players to be eased in the series gameplay, while another compared the tutorial to a nagging mother and said it and the unseen Tactician representing the player might grate with series fans. Bramwell praised the integration of RPG elements and tactical gameplay, in addition to finding the permanent death of characters a suitable fit for the game's world. Dingo was positive about the level design and controls, but warned that it was quite short and lacking in depth when compared to \"Final Fantasy Tactics Advance\". Massimilla found the gameplay both accessible and challenging as she made her way through the game, while Nutt was skeptical about the permanent death system and critical of the in-game economy despite generally enjoying the experience. Harris again compared it to \"Advance Wars\", but said that \"Fire Emblem\" had enough unique elements to make it its own product, and generally praised the title's accomplishments. Burns, who had experience of earlier \"Fire Emblem\" titles, praised the game as a worthy entry in the series and a good entry for the West to experience.\n\nIn its debut week, \"Rekka no Ken\" entered Japanese gaming charts at #2 with sales of 93,880 units. The following week it had dropped to #4, selling a further 47,550 and bringing total sales to 141,430 units. The following week it had reached #3 with further sales of 23,296 units. The game continued to steadily into July, reaching #21 in the top 100 best-selling games for that half of 2003 with total sales of 223,575 units. As of 2012, \"Rekka no Ken\" has sold 272,000 units in Japan. While no exact sales figure are available for Western territories, developers later stated that \"Fire Emblem\" was a commercial success overseas, and prompted the development of \"Path of Radiance\" for the GameCube home console.\n\n\"Fire Emblem\" was named \"Editor's Choice\" by both IGN and GameSpy as part of their reviews. During its 2004 awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences named \"Fire Emblem\" \"Handheld Game of the Year\". In the same year, the International Game Developers Association awarded the game for \"Excellence in Writing\" alongside titles including \"Beyond Good & Evil\" and \"\". In lists compiled by IGN, GamesRadar and \"Game Informer\", \"Fire Emblem\" was ranked among the best games for the GBA.\n\n"}
{"id": "3782389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3782389", "title": "George Robey", "text": "George Robey\n\nSir George Edward Wade, CBE (20 September 1869 – 29 November 1954), known professionally as George Robey, was an English comedian, singer and actor in musical theatre, who became known as one of the greatest music hall performers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As a comedian, he mixed everyday situations and observations with comic absurdity. Apart from his music hall acts, he was a popular Christmas pantomime performer in the English provinces, where he excelled in the dame roles. He scored notable successes in musical revues during and after the First World War, particularly with the song \"If You Were the Only Girl (In the World)\", which he performed with Violet Loraine in the revue \"The Bing Boys Are Here\" (1916). One of his best-known original characters in his six-decade long career was the Prime Minister of Mirth.\n\nBorn in London, Robey came from a middle-class family. After schooling in England and Germany, and a series of office jobs, he made his debut on the London stage, at the age of 21, as the straight man to a comic hypnotist. Robey soon developed his own act and appeared at the Oxford Music Hall in 1890, where he earned favourable notices singing \"The Simple Pimple\" and \"He'll Get It Where He's Gone to Now\". In 1892, he appeared in his first pantomime, \"Whittington Up-to-date\" in Brighton, which brought him to a wider audience. More provincial engagements followed in Manchester, Birmingham and Liverpool, and he became a mainstay of the popular Christmas pantomime scene.\n\nRobey's music hall act matured in the first decade of the 1900s, and he undertook a number of foreign tours. He starred in the Royal Command Performance in 1912 and regularly entertained before aristocracy. He was an avid sportsman, playing cricket and football at a semi-professional level. During the First World War, in addition to his performances in revues, he raised money for many war charities and was appointed a CBE in 1919. From 1918, he created sketches based on his Prime Minister of Mirth character and used a costume he had designed in the 1890s as a basis for the character's attire. He made a successful transition from music hall to variety shows and starred in the revue \"Round in Fifty\" in 1922, which earned him still wider notice. With the exception of his performances in revue and pantomime, he appeared as his Prime Minister of Mirth character in all the other entertainment media including variety, music hall and radio.\n\nIn 1913 Robey made his film debut, but he had only modest success in the medium. He continued to perform in variety theatre in the inter-war years and, in 1932, starred in \"Helen!\", his first straight theatre role. His appearance brought him to the attention of many influential directors, including Sydney Carroll, who signed him to appear on stage as Falstaff in \"Henry IV, Part 1\" in 1935, a role that he later repeated in Laurence Olivier's 1944 film, \"Henry V\". During the Second World War, Robey raised money for charities and promoted recruitment into the forces. By the 1950s, his health had deteriorated, and he entered into semi-retirement. He was knighted a few months before his death in 1954.\n\nRobey was born at 334 Kennington Road, Kennington, London. His father, Charles Wade, was a civil engineer who spent much of his career on tramline design and construction. Robey's mother, Elizabeth Mary Wade Keene, was a housewife; he also had two sisters. His paternal ancestors originated from Hampshire; his uncle, George Wade, married into aristocracy in 1848, a link which provided a proud topic of conversation for future generations of the Wade family. When Robey was five, his father moved the family to Birkenhead, where he helped in the construction of the Mersey Railway. Robey began his schooling in nearby Hoylake at a dame school. Three years later the family moved back to London, near the border between Camberwell and Peckham. At around this time, trams were being introduced to the area, providing Charles Wade with a regular, well-paid job.\n\nTo fulfil an offer of work, Charles Wade moved the family to Germany in 1880, and Robey attended a school in Dresden. He devoted his leisure hours to visiting the city's museums, art galleries and opera houses and gained a reasonable fluency in German by the time he was 12. He enjoyed life in the country and was impressed with the many operatic productions held in the city and with the Germans' high regard for the arts. When he was 14, his father allowed him to move in with a clergyman's family in the German countryside, which he used as a base while studying science at Leipzig University. To earn money, he taught English to his landlord's children and minded them while their parents were at work. Having successfully enrolled at the university, he studied art and music and stayed with the family for a further 18 months so he could complete his studies before returning to England in 1885. He later claimed, apparently untruthfully, to have studied at the University of Cambridge.\n\nAt the age of 18 Robey travelled to Birmingham, where he worked in a civil engineer's office. It was here that he became interested in a career on the stage and often dreamed of starring in his own circus. He learned to play the mandolin and became a skilled performer on the instrument. This drew interest from a group of local musicians and, together with a friend from the group who played the guitar, Robey travelled the local area in search of engagements. Soon afterwards, they were hired to play at a charity concert at the local church, St Mary and St Ambrose in Edgbaston, a performance that led to more local bookings. For the next appearance, Robey performed an impromptu version of \"Killaloo\", a comic ditty taken from the burlesque \"Miss Esmeralda\". The positive response from the audience encouraged him to give up playing the mandolin to concentrate instead on singing comic songs.\n\nBy 1890 Robey had become homesick, and so he returned to South London, where he took employment in a civil engineering company. He also joined a local branch of the Thirteen Club, whose members, many of whom were amateur musicians, performed in small venues across London. Hearing of his talent, the founder of the club, W. H. Branch, invited Robey to appear at Anderton's Hotel in Fleet Street, where he performed the popular new comic song \"Where Did You Get That Hat?\". Robey's performance secured him a number of private engagements for which he was paid a guinea a night. By the early months of 1891, Robey was much in demand, and he decided to change his stage name. He swapped \"Wade\" for \"Robey\" after working for a company in Birmingham that bore the latter name. It was at around this time that he met E. W. Rogers, an established music hall composer who wrote songs for Marie Lloyd and Jenny Hill. For Robey, Rogers wrote three songs: \"My Hat's a Brown 'Un\", \"The Simple Pimple\" and \"It Suddenly Dawned Upon Me\".\n\nIn 1891 Robey visited the Royal Aquarium in Westminster where he watched \"Professor Kennedy\", a burlesque mesmerist from America. After the performance, Robey visited Kennedy in his dressing room and offered himself as the stooge for his next appearance. They agreed that Robey, as his young apprentice, would be \"mesmerised\" into singing a comic song. At a later rehearsal, Robey negotiated a deal to sing one of the comic songs that had been written for him by Rogers. Robey's turn was a great success, and as a result he secured a permanent theatrical residency at the venue. Later that year, he appeared as a solo act at the Oxford Music Hall, where he performed \"The Simple Pimple\" and \"He'll Get It Where He's Gone to Now\". The theatrical press soon became aware of his act, and \"The Stage\" called him a \"comedian with a pretty sense of humour [who] delivers his songs with considerable point and meets with all success\". In early 1892, together with his performances at the Royal Aquarium and the Oxford Music Hall, Robey starred alongside Jenny Hill, Bessie Bonehill and Harriet Vernon at the Paragon Theatre of Varieties in Mile End, where, according to his biographer Peter Cotes, he \"stole the notices from experienced troupers\".\n\nThat summer, Robey conducted a music hall tour of the English provinces which began in Chatham and took him to Liverpool, at a venue owned by the mother of the influential London impresario Oswald Stoll. Through this engagement Robey met Stoll, and the two became lifelong friends. In early December, Robey appeared in five music halls a night, including Gatti's Under the Arches, the Tivoli Music Hall and the London Pavilion. In mid-December, he travelled to Brighton, where he appeared in his first Christmas pantomime, \"Whittington Up-to-Date\". Pantomime would become a lucrative and regular source of employment for the comedian. Cotes calls Robey's festive performances the \"cornerstone of his comic art\", and the source of \"some of his greatest successes\".\n\nDuring the 1890s Robey created a number of music hall characters centred on everyday life. Among them were \"The Chinese Laundryman\" and \"Clarence, the Last of the Dandies\". As Clarence, Robey dressed in a top hat and frock coat and carried a malacca cane, the garb of a stereotypical Victorian gentleman. For his drag pieces, the comedian established \"The Lady Dresser\", a female tailor who was desperate to out-dress her high class customers, and \"Daisy Dillwater, the District Nurse\" who arrived on stage with a bicycle to share light-hearted scandal and gossip with the audience before hurriedly cycling off.\n\nWith Robey's popularity came an eagerness to differentiate himself from his music hall rivals, and so he devised a signature costume when appearing as himself: an oversized black coat fastened from the neck down with large, wooden buttons; black, unkempt, baggy trousers and a partially bald wig with black, whispery strands of unbrushed, dirty-looking hair that poked below a large, dishevelled top-hat. He applied thick white face paint and exaggerated the redness on his cheeks and nose with bright red make-up; his eye line and eyebrows were also enhanced with thick, black greasepaint. He held a short, misshaped, wooden walking stick, which was curved at the top. Robey later used the costume for his character, The Prime Minister of Mirth. The outfit helped Robey become instantly recognisable on the London music hall circuit. He next made a start at building his repertoire and bought the rights to comic songs and monologues by several well-established music hall writers, including Sax Rohmer and Bennett Scott. For his routines, Robey developed a characteristic delivery described by Cotes as \"a kind of machine-gun staccato rattle through each polysyllabic line, ending abruptly, and holding the pause while he fixed his audience with his basilisk stare.\"\n\nAt the start of 1894, Robey travelled to Manchester to participate in the pantomime \"Jack and Jill\", where he was paid £25 a week for a three-month contract. He did not appear in \"Jack and Jill\" until the third act but pleased the holiday crowds nonetheless. During one performance the scenery mechanism failed, which forced him to improvise for the first time. Robey fabricated a story that he had just dined with the Lord Mayor before detailing exactly what he had eaten. The routine was such a hit that it was incorporated into the show as part of the script.\nIn the final months of 1894, Robey returned to London to honour a contract for Augustus Harris at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, the details of which are unknown. In September he starred in a series of stand-up comedy shows that he would perform every September between 1894 and 1899. These short performances, in English seaside resorts including Scarborough and Bournemouth, were designed chiefly to enhance his name among provincial audiences. For the 1895 and 1896 Christmas pantomimes, he appeared in Manchester and Birmingham, respectively, in the title role of \"Dick Whittington\", for which he received favourable reviews and praise from audiences. Despite the show's success, Robey and his co-stars disliked the experience. The actress Ada Reeve felt that the production had a bad back-stage atmosphere and was thankful when the season ended, while the comedian Barry Lupino was dismayed at having his role, Muffins, considerably reduced.\n\nOn 29 April 1898, Robey married his first wife, the Australian-born musical theatre actress Ethel Hayden, at St Clement Danes church in the Strand, London. The congregation was made up of various theatrical colleagues; J. Pitt Hardacre was his best man, and composer Leslie Stuart was the organist. Robey and Ethel resided briefly in Circus Road, St John's Wood, until the birth of their first child Edward in 1900. They then moved to 83 Finchley Road in Swiss Cottage, Hampstead. Family life suited Robey; his son Edward recalled many happy experiences with his father, including the evenings when he would accompany him to the half-dozen music halls at which he would be appearing each night.\nBy the start of the new century, Robey was a big name in pantomime, and he was able to choose his roles. Pantomime enjoyed wide popularity until the 1890s, but by the time Robey had reached his peak, interest in it was on the wane. A type of character he particularly enjoyed taking on was the pantomime dame, which historically was played by comedians from the music hall. Robey was inspired by the older comedians Herbert Campbell and Dan Leno, and, although post-dating them, he rivalled their eccentricity and popularity, earning the festive entertainment a new audience. In his 1972 biography of Robey, Neville Cardus thought that the comedian was \"at his fullest as a pantomime Dame\".\n\nIn 1902 Robey created the character \"The Prehistoric Man\". He dressed as a caveman and spoke of modern political issues, often complaining about the government \"slapping another pound of rock on his taxes\". The character was received favourably by audiences, who found it easy to relate to his topical observations. That year he released \"The Prehistoric Man\" and \"Not That I Wish to Say Anything\" on shellac discs using the early acoustic recording process.\n\nRobey signed a six-year contract in June 1904 to appear annually at, among other venues, the Oxford Music Hall in London, for a fee of £120 a week. The contract also required him to perform during the spring and autumn seasons between 1910 and 1912. Robey disputed this part of the contract and stated that he agreed to this only as a personal favour to the music hall manager George Adney Payne and that it should have become void on Payne's death in 1907. The management of the Oxford counter-claimed and forbade Robey from appearing in any other music hall during this period. The matter went to court, where the judge found in Robey's favour.\n\nRobey was engaged to play the title role in the 1905 pantomime \"Queen of Hearts\". The show was considered risqué by the theatrical press. In one scene Robey accidentally sat on his crown before bellowing \"Assistance! Methinks I have sat upon a hedgehog\"; in another sketch, the comedian mused, \"Then there's Mrs Simkins, the swank! Many's the squeeze she's had of my blue bag on washing day.\" Robey scored a further hit with the show the following year, in Birmingham, which Cotes describes as \"the most famous of all famous Birmingham Theatre Royal pantomimes\". Robey incorporated \"The Dresser\", a music hall sketch taken from his own repertoire, into the show. Over the next few years he continued to tour the music hall circuit both in London and the English provinces and recorded two songs, \"What Are You Looking at Me For?\" and \"The Mayor of Mudcumdyke\", which were later released by the Gramophone and Typewriter Company.\n\nOff-stage, Robey led an active lifestyle and was a keen amateur sportsman. He was proud of his healthy physique and maintained it by performing frequent exercise and following a careful diet. By the time he was in his mid-thirties, he had played as an amateur against Millwall, Chelsea and Fulham football clubs. He organised and played in many charity football matches throughout England, which were described by the sporting press as being of a very high standard, and he remained an active football player well into his fifties. Robey became associated with cricket by 1895 when he led a team of amateur players for a match at Turney Road in Dulwich. In September 1904, while appearing in Hull, he was asked by the cricketer Harry Wrathall to take part in a charity cricket match at the Yorkshire County Cricket Club. Robey played so well that Wrathall asked him to return the following Saturday to take part in a professional game. That weekend, while waiting in the pavilion before the game, Robey was approached by an agent for Hull City A.F.C., who asked the comedian to play in a match that same afternoon. Robey agreed, swapped his cricket flannels for a football kit and played with the team against Nottingham Forest as an inside right.\nBy 1903 Robey was playing at a semi-professional level. He was signed as an inside forward by Millwall Football Club and scored many goals for them. He also displayed a good level of ability in vigoro, an Australian sport derived from both cricket and baseball which was short-lived in England. Two years later he became a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club and played in minor games for them for many years. He gained a reputation at the club for his comic antics on the field, such as raising his eyebrows at the approaching bowler in an attempt to distract him. The writer Neville Cardus was complimentary about Robey's cricket prowess and called him \"an elegant player\" whose performances on the cricket field were as entertaining as they were on the stage. Although a versatile player, Robey thought of himself as a \"medium-paced, right-handed bowler\".\n\nRobey was asked to help organise a charity football match in 1907 by friends of the Scottish football trainer James Miller, who had died the previous year. Robey compiled a team of amateur footballers from the theatrical profession and met Miller's former team Chelsea Football Club at their home ground. The match raised considerable proceeds for Miller's widow. Robey was proud of the match and joked: \"I just wanted to make sure that Chelsea stay in the first division.\"\n\nIn his spare time, Robey made violins, a hobby that he first took up during his years in Dresden. He became a skilled craftsman of the instrument, although he never intended for them to be played in public. Speaking in the 1960s, the violinist and composer Yehudi Menuhin, who played one of Robey's violins for a public performance during that decade, called the comedian's finished instrument \"very professional\". He was intrigued by the idea that a man as famous as Robey could produce such a \"beautifully finished\" instrument, unbeknown to the public. Robey was also an artist, and some of his pen and ink self-caricatures are kept at the National Portrait Gallery, London.\n\nRobey's first high-profile invitation came in the first decade of the 1900s from Hugh Lowther, 5th Earl of Lonsdale, who hired him as entertainment for a party he was hosting at Carlton House Terrace in Westminster. Soon afterwards, the comedian appeared for the first time before royalty when King Edward VII had Robey hired for several private functions. Robey performed a series of songs and monologues and introduced the \"Mayor of Mudcumdyke\", all of which was met with much praise and admiration from the royal watchers. He was later hired by Edward's son, the Prince of Wales (the future King George V), who arranged a performance at Carlton House Terrace for his friend Lord Curzon.\n\nIn July 1912, at the invitation of the impresario Oswald Stoll, Robey took part for the first time in the Royal Command Performance, to which Cotes attributes \"one of the prime factors in his continuing popularity\". King George V and Queen Mary were \"delighted\" with Robey's comic sketch, in which he performed the \"Mayor of Mudcumdyke\" in public for the first time. Robey found the royal show to be a less daunting experience than the numerous private command performances that he gave during his career.\n\nAt the outbreak of the First World War, Robey wished to enlist in the army but, now in his 40s, he was too old for active service. Instead, he volunteered for the Special Constabulary and raised money for charity through his performances as a comedian. It was not uncommon for him to finish at the theatre at 1:00 am and then to patrol as a special constable until 6:00 am, where he would frequently help out during zeppelin raids. He combined his civilian duties with work for a volunteer motor transport unit towards the end of the war, in which he served as a lieutenant. He committed three nights a week to the corps while organising performances during the day to benefit war charities. Robey was a strong supporter of the Merchant Navy and thought that they were often overlooked when it came to charitable donations. He raised £22,000 at a benefit held at the London Coliseum, which he donated in the navy's favour.\n\nRobey's first experience in cinema was in 1913, with two early sound film shorts: \"And Very Nice Too\" and \"Good Queen Bess\", made in the Kinoplasticon process, where the film was synchronised with phonograph records. The next year, he tried to emulate his music hall colleagues Billy Merson and Charlie Austin, who had set up Homeland Films and found success with the \"Squibs\" series of films starring Betty Balfour. Robey met filmmakers from the Burns Film Company, who engaged him in a silent short entitled \"George Robey Turns Anarchist\", in which he played a character who fails to blow up the Houses of Parliament. He continued to appear sporadically in film throughout the rest of his career, never achieving more than a modest amount of success.\n\nIn 1914, for the first time in many years, Robey appeared in a Christmas pantomime as a male when he was engaged to play the title role in \"Sinbad the Sailor\"; Fred Emney Sr played the dame role. Although the critics were surprised by the casting, it appealed to audiences, and the scenes featuring Robey and Emney together proved the most memorable. During the war the demand for light entertainment in the English provinces guaranteed Robey frequent bookings and a regular income. His appearances in Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle and Glasgow were as popular as his annual performances in Birmingham. His wife Ethel accompanied him on these tours and frequently starred alongside him.\n\nBy the First World War, music hall entertainment had fallen out of favour with audiences. Theatrical historians blame the music hall's decline on the increasing salaries of performers and the halls' inability to present profitably the twenty or thirty acts that the audiences expected to see. Revue appealed to wartime audiences, and Robey decided to capitalise on the medium's popularity. Stoll offered Robey a lucrative contract in 1916 to appear in the new revue \"The Bing Boys Are Here\" at the Alhambra Theatre, London. Dividing his time between three or four music halls a night had become unappealing to the comedian, and he relished the opportunity to appear in a single theatre. He was cast as Lucius Bing opposite Violet Loraine, who played his love interest Emma, and the couple duetted in the show's signature song \"If You Were the Only Girl (In the World)\", which became an international success.\nThis London engagement was a new experience for Robey, who had only been familiar with provincial pantomimes and week-long, one-man comedy shows. Aside from pantomime, he had never taken part in a long-running production, and he had never had to memorise lines precisely or keep to schedules enforced by strict directors and theatre managers. \"The Bing Boys Are Here\" ran for 378 performances and occupied the Alhambra for more than a year. The theatrical press praised Robey as \"the first actor of the halls\". He made two films towards the end of the war: \"The Anti-frivolity League\" in 1916 and \"Doing His Bit\" the following year.\n\nRobey left the cast of \"The Bing Boys\" during its run, in January 1917, to star at the London Hippodrome in Albert de Courville, Dave Stamper and Gene Buck's lavishly-staged revue \"Zig-Zag!\". Robey included a sketch based on his music hall character \"The Prehistoric Man\", with Daphne Pollard playing the role of \"She of the Tireless Tongue\". In another scene, he played a drunken gentleman who accidentally secures a box at the Savoy Theatre instead of an intended hotel room. The audience appeared unresponsive to the character, so he changed it mid-performance to that of a naive Yorkshire man. The change provoked much amusement, and it became one of the most popular scenes of the show. \"Zig-Zag\" ran for 648 performances. Stoll again secured Robey for the Alhambra in 1918 for a sequel, \"The Bing Boys on Broadway\". The show, again co-starring Violet Loraine, matched the popularity of its predecessor and beat the original show's run with a total of 562 performances.\n\nRobey returned to the London Hippodrome in 1919 where he took a leading role in another hit revue, \"Joy Bells\". Phyllis Bedells took over from Pollard as his stage partner, with Anita Elson and Leon Errol as supporting dancers. Robey played the role of an old-fashioned father who is mystified over the changing traditions after the First World War. He interpolated two music hall sketches: \"No, No, No\" centred on turning innocent, everyday sayings into suggestive and provocative maxims, and \"The Rest Cure\" told the story of a pre-op hospital patient who hears worrying stories of malpractice from his well-meaning friends who visit him. In the Italian newspaper \"La Tribuna\", the writer Emilio Cecchi commented: \"Robey, just by being Robey, makes us laugh until we weep. We do not want to see either Figaro or Othello; it is quite enough for Robey to appear in travelling costume and to turn his eyes in crab-like fashion from one side of the auditorium to another. Robey's aspect in dealing with his audience is paternal and, one might say, apostolic.\" \"Joy Bells\" ran for 723 performances.\n\nIn the early months of 1919, Robey completed a book of memoirs, \"My Rest Cure\", which was published later that year. During the run of \"Joy Bells\" he was awarded the Legion of Honour for raising £14,000 for the French Red Cross. He declined a knighthood that same year because, according to Cotes, he was worried that the title would distance him from his working-class audiences; he was appointed a CBE by George V at Buckingham Palace instead. On the morning of the penultimate \"Joy Bells\" performance, Robey was invited to Stoll's London office, where he was offered a role in a new revue at the Alhambra Theatre. On the journey, he met the theatre impresario Sir Alfred Butt, who agreed to pay him £100 more, but out of loyalty to Stoll, he declined the offer and resumed his £600 a week contract at the Alhambra. On 28 July 1919, Robey took part in his second Royal Command Performance, at the London Coliseum. He and Loraine sang \"If You Were the Only Girl (In the World)\".\n\nA gap in the Alhambra's schedule allowed Stoll to showcase Robey in a new short film. \"George Robey's Day Off\" (1919) showed the comedian acting out his daily domestic routines to comic effect, but the picture failed at the box office. The British director John Baxter concluded that producers did not know how best to apply Robey's stage talents to film.\n\nBy 1920 variety theatre had become popular in Britain, and Robey had completed the successful transition from music hall to variety star. Pantomime, which relied on its stars to make up much of the script through ad lib, was also beginning to fall out of favour, and his contemporaries were finding it too difficult to create fresh material for every performance; for Robey, however, the festive entertainment continued to be a lucrative source of employment.\n\nRobey's first revue of the 1920s was \"Johnny Jones\", which opened on 1 June 1920 at the Alhambra Theatre. The show also featured Ivy St. Helier, Lupino Lane and Eric Blore and carried the advertisement \"A Robey salad with musical dressing\". One of the show's more popular gags was a scene in which Robey picked and ate cherries off St. Helier's hat, before tossing the stones into the orchestra pit which were then met by loud bangs from the bass drum. A sign of his popularity came in August 1920 when he was depicted in scouting costume for a series of 12 Royal Mail stamps in aid of the Printers Pension Corporation War Orphans and the Prince of Wales Boy Scout Funds.\n\nThe revue \"Robey en Casserole\" (1921) was next for Robey, during which he led a troupe of dancers in a musical piece called the \"Policemen Ballet\". Each dancer was dressed in a mock police uniform on top and a tutu below. The show was the first failure for the comedian under Stoll's management. That December Robey appeared in his only London pantomime, \"Jack and the Beanstalk\", at the Hippodrome. His biographer, Peter Cotes, remembered the comedian's interpretation of Dame Trot as \"enormously funny: a bucolic caricature of a woman, sturdy and fruity, leathery and forbidding\" and thought that Robey's comic timing was \"in a class of its own.\" In March 1922 Robey remained at the Hippodrome in the revue \"Round in Fifty\", a modernised version of \"Round the World in Eighty Days\", which proved to be another hit for the London theatre, and a personal favourite of the comedian.\n\nStoll brought Robey to cinema audiences a further four times during 1923. The first two films were written with the intention of showcasing the comedian's pantomime talents: \"One Arabian Night\" was a reworking of \"Aladdin\" and co-starred Lionelle Howard and Edward O'Neill, while \"Harlequinade\" visited the roots of pantomime. One of Robey's more notable roles under Stoll was Sancho Panza in Maurice Elvey's 1923 film \"Don Quixote\", for which he received a fee of £700 a week. The amount of time he spent working away from home led to the breakdown of his marriage, and he separated from Ethel in 1923. He had a brief affair with one of his leading ladies and walked out of the family home.\n\nRobey made a return to the London Hippodrome in 1924 in the revue \"Leap Year\" in which he co-starred with Laddie Cliff, Betty Chester and Vera Pearce. \"Leap Year\" was set in South Africa, Australia and Canada, and was written to appeal to the tourists who were visiting London from the Commonwealth countries. Robey was much to their tastes, and his rendition of \"My Old Dutch\" helped the show achieve another long run of 421 performances. \"Sky High\" was next and opened at the London Palladium in March 1925. The chorus dancer Marie Blanche was his co-star, a partnership that caused the gossip columnists to comment on the performers' alleged romance two years previously. Despite the rumours Blanche continued as his leading lady for the next four years, and \"Sky High\" lasted for 309 performances on the West End stage.\n\nThe year 1926 was lacking in variety entertainment, a fact largely attributed to the UK general strike that had occurred in May of that year. The strike was unexpected by Robey, who had signed the previous year to star in a series of variety dates for Moss Empires. The contract was lucrative, made more so by the comedian's willingness to manage his own bookings. He took the show to the provinces under the title of \"Bits and Pieces\" and employed a company of 25 artists as well as engineers and support staff. Despite the economic hardships of Britain in 1926, large numbers of people turned out to see the show. He returned to Birmingham, a city where he was held in great affection, and where he was sure the audiences would embrace his new show. However, censors demanded that he omit the provocative song \"I Stopped, I Looked, I Listened\" and that he heavily edit the sketch \"The Cheat\". The restrictions failed to dampen the audiences' enthusiasm, and \"Bits and Pieces\" enjoyed rave reviews. It ran until Christmas and earned a six-month extension.\n\nIn the spring of 1927 Robey embraced the opportunity to tour abroad, when he and his company took \"Bits and Pieces\" to South Africa, where it was received favourably. By the time he had left Cape Town, he had played to over 60,000 people and had travelled in excess of 15,000 miles. Upon his return to England in October, he took \"Bits and Pieces\" to Bradford. In August 1928, Robey and his company travelled to Canada, where they played to packed audiences for three months. It was there that he produced a new revue, \"Between Ourselves\", in Vancouver, which was staged especially for the country's armed forces. The Canadians were enthusiastic about Robey; he was awarded the freedom of the city in London, Ontario, made a chieftain of the Sarcee tribe, and was an honorary guest at a cricket match in Edmonton, Alberta. He described the tour as \"one of unbroken happiness.\" In the late 1920s Robey also wrote and starred in two Phonofilm sound-on-film productions, \"Safety First\" (1928) and \"Mrs. Mephistopheles\" (1929).\n\nIn early 1929 Robey returned to South Africa and then Canada for another tour with \"Bits and Pieces\", after which he started another series of variety dates back in England. Among the towns he visited was Woolwich, where he performed to packed audiences over the course of a week. Here he met the theatre managers Frank and Agnes Littler, with the latter briefly becoming his manager. In 1932 Robey appeared in his first sound film, \"The Temperance Fête\", and followed this with \"Marry Me\", which was, according to his biographer A. E. Wilson, one of the most successful musical films of the comedian's career. The film tells the story of a sound recordist in a gramophone company who romances a colleague when she becomes the family housekeeper.\n\nBy the later months of 1932, Robey had formed a romantic relationship with the Littlers' daughter Blanche (1897–1981), who then took over as his manager. The couple grew close during the filming of \"Don Quixote\", a remake of the comedian's 1923 success as Sancho Panza. Unlike its predecessor, \"Don Quixote\" had an ambitious script, big budget and an authentic foreign setting. Robey, however, resented having to grow a beard for the role and disliked the French climate and gruelling 12-week filming schedule. He refused to act out his character's death scene in a farcical way and also objected to the lateness of the \"dreadfully banal\" scripts, which were often written the night before filming.\n\nUntil 1932 Robey had never played in legitimate theatre, although he read Shakespeare from an early age. That year he took the part of King Menelaus in \"Helen!\", which was an English-language adaptation by A. P. Herbert of Offenbach's operetta \"La belle Hélène\". The show's producer C. B. Cochran, a longstanding admirer of Robey, engaged a prestigious cast for the production, including Evelyn Laye and W. H. Berry, with choreography by Léonide Massine and sets by Oliver Messel. The operetta opened on 30 January 1932, becoming the Adelphi Theatre's most successful show of the year. The critic Harold Conway wrote that while Robey had reached the pinnacle of his career as a variety star, which only required him to rely on his \"breezy, cheeky personality\", he had reservations about the comedian's ability to \"integrate himself with the other stars ... to learn many pages of dialogue, and to remember countless cues.\"\n\nAfter the run of \"Helen!\", Robey briefly resumed his commitments to the variety stage before signing a contract to appear at the Savoy Theatre as Bold Ben Blister in the operetta \"Jolly Roger\", which premiered in March 1933. The production had a run of bad luck, including an actors' strike which was caused by Robey's refusal to join the actors' union Equity. The dispute was settled when he was included as a co-producer of the show, thus excluding him as a full-time actor. Robey made a substantial donation to the union, and the production went ahead. Despite its troubles, the show was a success and received much praise from the press. Harold Conway of the \"Daily Mail\" called the piece \"one of the outstanding triumphs of personality witnessed in a London theatre\". Later that year, Robey completed his final autobiography, \"Looking Back on Life\". The literary critic Graham Sutton admired Robey for his honest and frank account, and thought that he was \"at his best when most personal\".\n\nAccording to Wilson, Robey revered Shakespeare and had an \"excellent reading knowledge of the Bard\" even though the comedian had never seen a Shakespeare play. As a child, he had committed to memory the \"ghost\" scene in \"Hamlet\". Writing in 1933, Cochran expressed the opinion that Robey had been a victim of a largely conservative and \"snobbish\" attitude from theatre managers, that the comedian was \"cut out for Shakespeare\", and that if he had been frequently engaged in playing the Bard's works, then \"Shakespeare would probably have been popular.\" In 1934, the theatre director Sydney Carroll offered Robey the chance to appear as Nick Bottom in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" at the Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park, but he initially declined the offer, citing a hectic schedule, including a conflict with his appearance in that year's Royal Variety Performance on 8 May. He was also concerned that he would not be taken seriously by legitimate theatre critics and knew that he would not be able to include a comic sketch or to engage in his customary resourceful gagging. In the same year, Robey starred in a film version of the hit musical \"Chu Chin Chow\". \"The New York Times\" called him \"a lovable and laughable Ali Baba\".\n\nAt the start of 1935 Robey accepted his first Shakespearean role, as Falstaff in \"Henry IV, Part 1\", which surprised the press and worried fans who thought that he might retire the Prime Minister of Mirth. The theatrical press were sceptical of a music hall performer taking on such a distinguished role; Carroll, the play's producer, vehemently defended his casting choice. Carroll later admitted taking a gamble on employing Robey but wrote that the comedian \"has unlimited courage in challenging criticism and risking his reputation on a venture of this kind; he takes both his past and his future in both hands and is faced with the alternative of dashing them into the depths or lifting them to a height hitherto undreamt of.\" Carroll further opined that \"[Robey] has never failed in anything he has undertaken. He is one of the most intelligent and capable of actors.\"\n\n\"Henry IV, Part I\" opened on 28 February at Her Majesty's Theatre, and Robey proved himself to be a capable Shakespearean actor, though his Shakespearean debut was marred initially by an inability to remember his lines. A journalist from \"The Daily Express\" thought that Robey seemed uncomfortable, displayed a halting delivery and was \"far from word perfect\". Writing in \"The Observer\", the critic Ivor Brown said of Robey's portrayal: \"In no performance within my memory has the actor been more obviously the afflicted servant of his lines and more obviously the omnipotent master of the situation\". Another journalist, writing in the \"Daily Mirror\", thought that Robey \"gave 25 percent of Shakespeare and 75 percent of himself\".\n\nIn any case, such was Robey's popularity in the role that the German theatre and film producer Max Reinhardt declared that, should the opportunity arise for a film version, the comedian would be his perfect choice as Falstaff. Cotes described Robey as having \"a great vitality and immense command of the [role]. He never faltered, he had to take his audience by the throat and make them attentive at once because he couldn't play himself in.\" Although he was eager to be taken seriously as a legitimate actor, Robey provided a subtle nod in the direction of his comic career by using the wooden cane intended for the Prime Minister of Mirth for the majority of his scenes as Falstaff. The poet John Betjeman responded to the critics' early scepticism: \"Variety artistes are a separate world from the legitimate stage. They are separate too, from ballet, opera, and musical comedy. It is possible for variety artists to appear in all of these. Indeed, no one who saw will ever forget the superb pathos and humour of George Robey's Falstaff\". Later, in 1935, Blanche Littler persuaded Robey to accept Carroll's earlier offer to play Bottom, and the comedian cancelled three weeks' worth of dates. The press were complimentary of his performance, and he later attributed his success to Littler and her encouragement.\n\nRobey made his radio debut in 1936 when he was interviewed for \"The Spice of Life\" programme for the BBC. He spoke about his private life and his time spent on the music hall circuit, which he described as the \"most enjoyable experience\" of his life. The usually reserved Robey admitted that privately he was not a sociable person and that he often grew tired of his audiences while performing on stage, but that he got his biggest thrill from making others laugh. He also declared a love for the outdoors and mentioned that, to relax, he would draw \"comic scribbles\" of himself as the Prime Minister of Mirth, which he would occasionally give to fans. As a result of the interview he received more than a thousand fan letters from listeners. Wilson thought that Robey's \"perfect diction and intimate manner made him an ideal broadcast speaker\". The press commented favourably on his performance, with one reporter from \"Variety Life\" writing: \"I doubt whether any speaker other than a stage idol could have used, as Robey did, the first person singular almost incessantly for half an hour without causing something akin to resentment. ... The comedian's talk was brilliantly conceived and written.\"\n\nIn the later months of 1936, Robey repeated his radio success with a thirty-minute programme entitled \"Music-Hall\", recorded for American audiences, to honour the tenth birthday of the National Broadcasting Corporation. In it, he presented a montage of his characterisations as well as impressions of other famous acts of the day. A second programme, which he recorded the following year, featured the comedian speaking fondly of cricket and of the many well-known players whom he had met on his frequent visits to the Oval and Lord's cricket grounds over his fifty-year association.\n\nIn the summer of 1938 Robey appeared in the film \"A Girl Must Live\", directed by Carol Reed, in which he played the role of Horace Blount. A report in the \"Kinematograph Weekly\" commented that the 69-year-old comedian was still able to \"stand up to the screen by day and variety by night.\" A journalist for \"The Times\" opined that Robey's performance as an elderly furrier, the love interest of both Margaret Lockwood and Lilli Palmer, was \"a perfect study in bewildered embarrassment\".\n\nRobey made his television debut in August 1938 but was unenthused with the medium and only made rare appearances. The BBC producer Grace Wyndham Goldie was dismayed at how little of his \"comic quality\" was conveyed on the small screen. Goldie thought that Robey's comic abilities were not limited to his voice and depended largely on the relation between his facial expressions and his witty words. She felt that he should \"be forbidden, by his own angel, if nobody else, to approach the ordinary microphone\". Nonetheless, Goldie remained optimistic about Robey's future television career. The journalist L. Marsland Gander disagreed and thought that Robey's methods were \"really too slow for television\".\n\nThat November, and with his divorce from Ethel finalised, Robey married Blanche Littler, who was more than two decades his junior, at Marylebone Town Hall. At Christmas, he fractured three ribs and bruised his spine when he accidentally fell into the orchestra pit while appearing in the 1938–39 pantomime \"Robinson Crusoe\" in Birmingham. He attributed the fall to his face mask which gave him a limited view of the stage. The critic Harold Conway was less forgiving, blaming the accident on the comedian's \"lost self-confidence\" and opining that the accident was the start of Robey's professional decline.\n\nAware of demand for his act in Australia, Robey conducted a second tour of the country at the start of 1939. While he was appearing at the Tivoli Theatre in Sydney, war broke out with Germany. Robey returned to England and concentrated his efforts on entertaining to raise money for the war effort. He signed up with the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) for whom he appeared in a wide range of shows and also in his own one-man engagements. He would sometimes turn up unannounced to perform at hospitals, munition factories, airfields, anti-aircraft posts and other venues where there was an audience of just a few people.\n\nDuring the 1940s, Robey appeared predominantly in troop concerts as himself but caused controversy by jokingly supporting the Nazis and belittling black people during his act. His intentions were to gently poke fun at the \"Little Englanders\", but audiences thought that he was sympathising with Nazism. His jocular view that a defeat for Hitler would mean a victory for bolshevism was highlighted in a series of controversial interviews, which caused him much embarrassment when challenged and which he regretted afterwards. His views became known in the press as \"Robeyisms\", which drew increasing criticism, but his Prime Minister of Mirth remained popular, and he used the character to divert the negative publicity. Cotes wrote that Robey was not a politician, merely a jingoist, who \"lived long enough to feel [that] his little-Englander outlook [was causing him] acute embarrassment, and his army of admirers deep dismay.\"\n\nRobey starred in the film \"Salute John Citizen\" in 1942, directed by Maurice Elvey and co-starring Edward Rigby and Stanley Holloway, about the effects that the war had on a normal British family. In a 1944 review of the film, Robey was described as being \"convincing in [an] important role\" but the film itself had \"dull moments in the simple tale\". That Christmas, Robey travelled to Bristol, where he starred in the pantomime \"Robinson Crusoe\". A further four films followed in 1943, one of which promoted war propaganda while the other two displayed the popular medium of cine-variety. Cine-variety introduced Robey to the Astoria in Finsbury Park, London, a venue which was used to huge audiences and big-name acts and was described as \"a super-cinema\".\n\nDuring the early months of 1944, Robey returned to the role of Falstaff when he appeared in the film version of \"Henry V\", produced by Eagle-Lion Films. The American film critic Bosley Crowther had mixed opinions of the film. Writing in \"The New York Times\" in 1946, he thought that it showcased \"a fine group of British film craftsmen and actors\", who contributed to \"a stunningly brilliant and intriguing screen spectacle\". Despite that, he considered the film's additional screenplay poor and called Falstaff's deathbed scene \"non-essential and just a bit grotesque.\" Late in 1944, he appeared in Burnley in a show entitled \"Vive Paree\" alongside Janice Hart and Frank O'Brian. In 1945, Robey starred in two minor film roles, as \"Old Sam\" in \"The Trojan Brothers\", a short comedy film in which two actors experience various problems as a pantomime horse, and as \"Vogel\" in the musical romance \"Waltz Time\". He spent 1947 touring England, while the following spring he undertook a provincial tour of Frederick Bowyer's fairy play \"The Windmill Man\", which he also co-produced with his wife.\n\nIn June 1951, now aged 81, Robey starred in a midnight gala performance at the London Palladium in aid of the family of Sid Field who had died that year. For the finale, Robey performed \"I Stopped, I Looked, I Listened\" and \"If You Were the Only Girl in the World\"; the rest of the three-hour performance featured celebrities from the radio, television and film mediums. The American comedian Danny Kaye, who was also engaged for the performance, called Robey a \"great, great artist\". The same month, Robey returned to Birmingham, where he opened a garden party at St. Mary and St. Ambrose Church, a venue in which he had appeared at the beginning of his career. On 25 September he appeared for the BBC on an edition of the radio series \"Desert Island Discs\" for which he chose among others \"Mondo ladro\", Falstaff's rueful complaint about the wicked world in Verdi's opera \"Falstaff\". For the rest of the year Robey made a number of personal appearances opening fetes and attending charity events.\n\nRobey took part in the Festival of Variety for the BBC in 1951, which paid tribute to the British music hall. For his performance, he adopted an ad-lib style rather than use a script. His wife sat at the side of the stage, ready to provide support should he need it. According to Wilson, Robey's turn earned the loudest applause of the evening. The following month Robey undertook a long provincial tour in the variety show \"Do You Remember?\" under the management of Bernard Delfont. After an evening's performance in Sheffield, he was asked by a local newspaper reporter if he considered retiring. The comedian quipped: \"Me retire? Good gracious, I'm too old for that. I could not think of starting a new career at my age!\" In December, he opened the Lansbury Lodge home for retired cricketers in Poplar, East London; he considered the ceremony to be one of the \"happiest memories of his life.\"\n\nBy early 1952, Robey was becoming noticeably frail, and he lost interest in many of his sporting pastimes. Instead, he stayed at home and drew comic sketches featuring the Prime Minister of Mirth. In May he filmed \"The Pickwick Papers\", in which he played the role of old Tony Weller, a part which he had initially turned down on health grounds. The following year, and in aid of the games fund, he starred as Clown in a short pantomime at the Olympic Variety Show at the Victoria Palace Theatre. Organisers asked for him to appear in the Prime Minister of Mirth costume instead of the usual clown garb, a request the comedian was happy to fulfil.\n\nIn the early months of 1954, a knighthood was conferred on Robey by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother at Buckingham Palace. During the following weeks, his health declined; he became confined to a wheelchair and spent the majority of his time at home under the care of his wife. In May he opened a British Red Cross fete in Seaford, East Sussex, and, a month later, made his last public appearance, on television as a panellist in the English version of \"The Name's the Same\". Wilson called Robey's performance \"pathetic\" and thought that he appeared with only \"a hint of his old self\". By June he had become housebound and quietly celebrated his 85th birthday surrounded by family; visiting friends were organised into appointments by his wife Blanche, but theatrical colleagues were barred in case they caused the comedian too much excitement.\n\nRobey suffered a stroke on 20 November and remained in a semi-coma for just over a week. He died on 29 November 1954 at his home in Saltdean, East Sussex, and was cremated at the Downs Crematorium in Brighton. Blanche continued to live on the Sussex coast until her death at the age of 83 in 1981.\n\nNews of Robey's death prompted tributes from the press, who printed illustrations, anecdotes and reminders of his stage performances and charitable activities. \"Knighthood notwithstanding, George Robey long ago made himself a place as an entertainer and artist of the people\", declared a reporter from the \"Daily Worker\", while a critic for the \"Daily Mail\" wrote: \"Personality has become a wildly misused word since his heyday, but George Robey breathed it in every pore.\" In Robey's obituary in \"The Spectator\", Compton Mackenzie called the comedian \"one of the last great figures of the late Victorian and Edwardian music-hall.\"\n\nIn December 1954, a memorial service for Robey was held at St Paul's Cathedral. The diverse congregation consisted of royalty, actors, hospital workers, stage personnel, students and taxi drivers, among others. The Bishop of Stepney, Joost de Blank, said: \"We have lost a great English music hall artist, one of the greatest this country has known in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\" Performers gave readings at the service, including the comedian Leslie Henson, who called Robey \"that great obstinate bullock of variety\". In his lifetime, Robey helped to earn more than £2,000,000 for charitable causes, with £500,000 of that figure being raised during the First World War. In recognition of his efforts, the Merchant Seaman's Convalescent Home in Limpsfield, Surrey, named a ward after him, and managerial staff at the Royal Sussex Hospital later bought a new dialysis machine in his memory.\n\nRobey's comic delivery influenced other comedians, but opinions of his effectiveness as a comic vary. The radio personality Robb Wilton acknowledged learning a lot from him, and although he felt that Robey \"was not very funny\", he could time a comic situation perfectly. Similarly, the comedian Charlie Chester admitted that, as a comedian, Robey \"still didn't make me laugh,\" although he described him as \"a legend\" whose Prime Minister of Mirth character used a beautiful make-up design. Robey's biographer Peter Cotes disagreed with these assessments, praising the comedian's \"droll like humour\" and comparing it in greatness to Chaplin's miming and Grock's clowning. Cotes wrote: \"His Mayor, Professor of Music, Saracen, Dame Trot, Queen of Hearts, District Nurse, Pro's Landlady, and of course his immortal Prime Minister, were all absurdities: rich, outsize in prim and pride, gloriously disapproving bureaucratic petty officialdom at its worst, best and funniest.\"\n\nViolet Loraine called her former co-star \"one of the greatest comedians the world has ever known\", while the theatrical producer Basil Dean opined that \"George was a great artist, one of the last and the really big figures of his era. They don't breed them like that now.\" The actor John Gielgud, who remembered meeting Robey at the Alhambra Theatre in 1953, called the comedian \"charming, gracious [and] one of the few really great ones\" of the music hall era. Upon his death, Robey's costume for the Prime Minister of Mirth was donated to the London Museum, where it is on permanent display.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n"}

The Hall of Fame preserved and interpreted the state's musical heritage through programs of collection, exhibition, education and performance; it attempted to foster an appreciation for Georgia music and tried to stimulate economic growth through a variety of dynamic partnerships and initiatives statewide. The Hall of Fame closed due to low attendance and reduced state funding.\n\nMercer University purchased the former Hall of Fame building in June 2012; the university will use the building for expanded programs within its School of Medicine.\n\nThe Georgia Music Hall of Fame's permanent exhibit space was designed to resemble a Georgia town where venues such as the Jazz and Swing Club, Vintage Vinyl and Rhythm & Blues Revue house artifacts, interpretive text and audio visual elements. Temporary exhibits included \"Keeps Calling Me Home: A Gram Parsons Retrospective\", \"Let Freedom Sing: Music and the Civil Rights Movement\" and '\"Otis Redding: I've Got Dreams to Remember\", named \"Museum Exhibition of the Year\" in 2008 by the Georgia Association of Museums and Galleries.\n\nEducation was at the core of the Georgia Music Hall of Fame's mission. The Billy Watson Music Factory served children grades pre-K through elementary by encouraging the exploration of musical concepts like rhythm, melody and composition in a hands-on learning environment. MIKE (Music in Kid's Education) provided a series of programs offering live music performances and music instruction opportunities throughout the year.\n\nThe Georgia Music Hall of Fame Foundation published \"Georgia Music Magazine\" quarterly as both the official museum magazine and an in-depth look at Georgia music. The state's legends, landmarks and unsung heroes were explored through insightful features, historical articles, news and reviews.\n\nThe Georgia Music Hall of Fame's institutional history began in 1978 when the Georgia General Assembly created the Senate Music Recording Industry Committee to study the economic impact of the state's music industry and to explore ways to promote Georgia music and attract music businesses to the state. In 1979, the Committee developed a Georgia Music Hall of Fame program honoring Georgia musicians who have made significant contributions to the music industry, with Ray Charles and music publisher Bill Lowery named the first inductees on Sept. 26, 1979. Owing much to the vision of then Lt. Governor Zell Miller, the Committee also endeavored to create a public museum and archive to document the state's music heritage and serve as a cultural heritage destination. In 1990, the Georgia Music Hall of Fame Authority was created as an instrumentality of the State of Georgia and a public corporation with the stated corporate purpose and general nature: 1) to construct and maintain a facility to house the Georgia Music Hall of Fame; 2) to operate, advertise and promote the Georgia Music Hall of Fame; and 3) to promote music events at the facility and throughout the state. On Sept. 22, 1996, the Georgia Music Hall of Fame opened as a facility housing a main exhibit hall, a retail store, the Zell Miller Center for Georgia Music Studies, an administrative wing, a classroom and a reception room. In 1999, the second phase of the museum, The Billy Watson Music Factory, an interactive and interpretive exhibit space for pre-K through elementary students, opened. The hall was closed on June 12, 2011 due to lack of attendance. The exhibits are now being housed at the University of Georgia, Georgia State University, the University of West Georgia and in private collections.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "87323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=87323", "title": "History of music", "text": "History of music\n\nMusic is found in every known culture, past and present, varying widely between times and places. Since all people of the world, including the most isolated tribal groups, have a form of music, it may be concluded that music is likely to have been present in the ancestral population prior to the dispersal of humans around the world. Consequently, music may have been in existence for at least 50,000 years and the first music may have been invented in Africa and then evolved to become a fundamental constituent of human life.\n\nA culture's music is influenced by all other aspects of that culture, including social and economic organization and experience, climate, and access to technology. The emotions and ideas that music expresses, the situations in which music is played and listened to, and the attitudes toward music players and composers all vary between regions and periods. \"Music history\" is the distinct subfield of musicology and history which studies music (particularly Western art music) from a chronological perspective.\n\nPrehistoric music, once more commonly called primitive music, is the name given to all music produced in preliterate cultures (prehistory), beginning somewhere in very late geological history. Prehistoric music is followed by ancient music in most of Europe (1500 BC) and later music in subsequent European-influenced areas, but still exists in isolated areas.\n\nPrehistoric music thus technically includes all of the world's music that has existed before the advent of any currently extant historical sources concerning that music, for example, traditional Native American music of preliterate tribes and Australian Aboriginal music. However, it is more common to refer to the \"prehistoric\" music of non-European continents – especially that which still survives – as folk, indigenous or traditional music. The origin of music is unknown as it occurred prior to recorded history. Some suggest that the origin of music likely stems from naturally occurring sounds and rhythms. Human music may echo these phenomena using patterns, repetition and tonality. Even today, some cultures have certain instances of their music intending to imitate natural sounds. In some instances, this feature is related to shamanistic beliefs or practice. It may also serve entertainment (game) or practical (luring animals in hunt) functions.\n\nIt is probable that the first musical instrument was the human voice itself, which can make a vast array of sounds, from singing, humming and whistling through to clicking, coughing and yawning. As for other musical instruments, in 2008 archaeologists discovered a bone flute in the Hohle Fels cave near Ulm, Germany. Considered to be about 35,000 years old, the five-holed flute has a V-shaped mouthpiece and is made from a vulture wing bone. The oldest known wooden pipes were discovered near Greystones, Ireland, in 2004. A wood-lined pit contained a group of six flutes made from yew wood, between 30 and 50 cm long, tapered at one end, but without any finger holes. They may once have been strapped together.\n\nIt has been suggested that the \"Divje Babe Flute\", a cave bear femur dated to be approximately 43,500 years old, is the world's oldest musical instrument and was produced by Neanderthals. Claims that the femur is indeed a musical instrument are, however, contested by alternative theories including the suggestion that the femur may have been gnawed by carnivores to produce holes. \n\nThe prehistoric age is considered to have ended with the development of writing, and with it, by definition, prehistoric music. \"Ancient music\" is the name given to the music that followed. The \"oldest known song\" was written in cuneiform, dating to 3400 years ago from Ugarit in Syria. It was a part of the Hurrian songs, more specifically Hurian hymn no. 6. It was deciphered by Anne Draffkorn Kilmer, and was demonstrated to be composed in harmonies of thirds, like ancient \"gymel\", and also was written using a Pythagorean tuning of the diatonic scale. The oldest surviving example of a complete musical composition, including musical notation, from anywhere in the world, is the Seikilos epitaph.\n\nDouble pipes, such as those used by the ancient Greeks, and ancient bagpipes, as well as a review of ancient drawings on vases and walls, etc., and ancient writings (such as in Aristotle, \"Problems,\" Book XIX.12) which described musical techniques of the time, indicate polyphony. One pipe in the aulos pairs (double flutes) likely served as a drone or \"keynote,\" while the other played melodic passages. Instruments, such as the seven holed flute and various types of stringed instruments have been recovered from the Indus valley civilization archaeological sites.\n\nIndian classical music (\"marga\") can be found from the scriptures of the Hindu tradition, the Vedas. Samaveda, one of the four vedas, describes music at length.\n\nRavanahatha (ravanhatta, rawanhattha, ravanastron or ravana hasta veena) is a bowed fiddle popular in Western India. It is believed to have originated among the Hela civilization of Sri Lanka in the time of King Ravana. This string instrument has been recognised as one of the oldest string instruments in world history.\n\nThe history of musical development in Iran (Persian music) dates back to the prehistoric era. The great legendary king, Jamshid, is credited with the invention of music. Music in Iran can be traced back to the days of the Elamite Empire (2500–644 BC). Fragmentary documents from various periods of the country's history establish that the ancient Persians possessed an elaborate musical culture. The Sassanid period (AD 226–651), in particular, has left us ample evidence pointing to the existence of a lively musical life in Persia. The names of some important musicians such as Barbod, Nakissa and Ramtin, and titles of some of their works have survived.\n\nThe Early music era may also include contemporary but traditional or folk music, including Asian music, Persian music, music of India, Jewish music, Greek music, Roman music, the music of Mesopotamia, the music of Egypt, and Muslim music.\n\nGreece\nGreek written history extends far back into Ancient Greece, and was a major part of ancient Greek theatre. In ancient Greece, mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration and spiritual reasons. Instruments included the double-reed aulos and the plucked string instrument, the lyre, especially the special kind called a kithara. Music was an important part of education in ancient Greece, and boys were taught music starting at age six.\n\nAccording to Easton's Bible Dictionary, Jubal was named by the Bible as the inventor of musical instruments (Gen. 4:21). The Hebrews were much given to the cultivation of music. Their whole history and literature afford abundant evidence of this. After the Deluge, the first mention of music is in the account of Laban's interview with Jacob (Gen. 31:27). After their triumphal passage of the Red Sea, Moses and the children of Israel sang their song of deliverance (Ex. 15). But the period of Samuel, David, and Solomon was the golden age of Hebrew music, as it was of Hebrew poetry. Music was now for the first time systematically cultivated. It was an essential part of training in the schools of the prophets (1 Sam. 10:5). There now arose also a class of professional singers (2 Sam. 19:35; Eccl. 2:8). Solomon's Temple, however, was the great school of music. In the conducting of its services large bands of trained singers and players on instruments were constantly employed (2 Sam. 6:5; 1 Chr. 15:16; 23;5; 25:1–6). In private life also music seems to have held an important place among the Hebrews (Eccl. 2:8; Amos 6:4–6; Isa. 5:11, 12; 24:8, 9; Ps. 137; Jer. 48:33; Luke 15:25).\n\nMusic and theatre scholars studying the history and anthropology of Semitic and early Judeo-Christian culture, have also discovered common links between theatrical and musical activity in the classical cultures of the Hebrews with those of the later cultures of the Greeks and Romans. The common area of performance is found in a \"social phenomenon called litany,\" a form of prayer consisting of a series of invocations or supplications. \"The Journal of Religion and Theatre\" notes that among the earliest forms of litany, \"Hebrew litany was accompanied by a rich musical tradition:\"\n\nEarly music is music of the European classical tradition from after the fall of the Roman Empire, in 476 AD, until the end of the Baroque era in the middle of the 18th century. Music within this enormous span of time was extremely diverse, encompassing multiple cultural traditions within a wide geographic area; many of the cultural groups out of which medieval Europe developed already had musical traditions, about which little is known. What unified these cultures in the Middle Ages was the Roman Catholic Church, and its music served as the focal point for musical development for the first thousand years of this period.\n\nWhile musical life was undoubtedly rich in the early Medieval era, as attested by artistic depictions of instruments, writings about music, and other records, the only repertory of music which has survived from before 800 to the present day is the plainsong liturgical music of the Roman Catholic Church, the largest part of which is called Gregorian chant. Pope Gregory I, who gave his name to the musical repertory and may himself have been a composer, is usually claimed to be the originator of the musical portion of the liturgy in its present form, though the sources giving details on his contribution date from more than a hundred years after his death. Many scholars believe that his reputation has been exaggerated by legend. Most of the chant repertory was composed anonymously in the centuries between the time of Gregory and Charlemagne.\n\nDuring the 9th century several important developments took place. First, there was a major effort by the Church to unify the many chant traditions, and suppress many of them in favor of the Gregorian liturgy. Second, the earliest polyphonic music was sung, a form of parallel singing known as organum. Third, and of greatest significance for music history, notation was reinvented after a lapse of about five hundred years, though it would be several more centuries before a system of pitch and rhythm notation evolved having the precision and flexibility that modern musicians take for granted.\n\nSeveral schools of polyphony flourished in the period after 1100: the St. Martial school of organum, the music of which was often characterized by a swiftly moving part over a single sustained line; the Notre Dame school of polyphony, which included the composers Léonin and Pérotin, and which produced the first music for more than two parts around 1200; the musical melting-pot of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, a pilgrimage destination and site where musicians from many traditions came together in the late Middle Ages, the music of whom survives in the Codex Calixtinus; and the English school, the music of which survives in the Worcester Fragments and the Old Hall Manuscript. Alongside these schools of sacred music a vibrant tradition of secular song developed, as exemplified in the music of the troubadours, trouvères and Minnesänger. Much of the later secular music of the early Renaissance evolved from the forms, ideas, and the musical aesthetic of the troubadours, courtly poets and itinerant musicians, whose culture was largely exterminated during the Albigensian Crusade in the early 13th century.\n\nForms of sacred music which developed during the late 13th century included the motet, conductus, discant, and clausulae. One unusual development was the \"Geisslerlieder\", the music of wandering bands of flagellants during two periods: the middle of the 13th century (until they were suppressed by the Church); and the period during and immediately following the Black Death, around 1350, when their activities were vividly recorded and well-documented with notated music. Their music mixed folk song styles with penitential or apocalyptic texts. The 14th century in European music history is dominated by the style of the \"ars nova\", which by convention is grouped with the medieval era in music, even though it had much in common with early Renaissance ideals and aesthetics. Much of the surviving music of the time is secular, and tends to use the formes fixes: the ballade, the virelai, the lai, the rondeau, which correspond to poetic forms of the same names. Most pieces in these forms are for one to three voices, likely with instrumental accompaniment: famous composers include Guillaume de Machaut and Francesco Landini.\n\nThe beginning of the Renaissance in music is not as clearly marked as the beginning of the Renaissance in the other arts, and unlike in the other arts, it did not begin in Italy, but in northern Europe, specifically in the area currently comprising central and northern France, the Netherlands, and Belgium. The style of the Burgundian composers, as the first generation of the Franco-Flemish school is known, was at first a reaction against the excessive complexity and mannered style of the late 14th century \"ars subtilior\", and contained clear, singable melody and balanced polyphony in all voices. The most famous composers of the Burgundian school in the mid-15th century are Guillaume Dufay, Gilles Binchois, and Antoine Busnois.\n\nBy the middle of the 15th century, composers and singers from the Low Countries and adjacent areas began to spread across Europe, especially into Italy, where they were employed by the papal chapel and the aristocratic patrons of the arts (such as the Medici, the Este, and the Sforza families). They carried their style with them: smooth polyphony which could be adapted for sacred or secular use as appropriate. Principal forms of sacred musical composition at the time were the mass, the motet, and the laude; secular forms included the chanson, the frottola, and later the madrigal.\n\nThe invention of printing had an immense influence on the dissemination of musical styles, and along with the movement of the Franco-Flemish musicians, contributed to the establishment of the first truly international style in European music since the unification of Gregorian chant under Charlemagne. Composers of the middle generation of the Franco-Flemish school included Johannes Ockeghem, who wrote music in a contrapuntally complex style, with varied texture and an elaborate use of canonical devices; Jacob Obrecht, one of the most famous composers of masses in the last decades of the 15th century; and Josquin des Prez, probably the most famous composer in Europe before Palestrina, and who during the 16th century was renowned as one of the greatest artists in any form. Music in the generation after Josquin explored increasing complexity of counterpoint; possibly the most extreme expression is in the music of Nicolas Gombert, whose contrapuntal complexities influenced early instrumental music, such as the canzona and the ricercar, ultimately culminating in Baroque fugal forms.\n\nBy the middle of the 16th century, the international style began to break down, and several highly diverse stylistic trends became evident: a trend towards simplicity in sacred music, as directed by the Counter-Reformation Council of Trent, exemplified in the music of Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina; a trend towards complexity and chromaticism in the madrigal, which reached its extreme expression in the avant-garde style of the Ferrara School of Luzzaschi and the late century madrigalist Carlo Gesualdo; and the grandiose, sonorous music of the Venetian school, which used the architecture of the Basilica San Marco di Venezia to create antiphonal contrasts. The music of the Venetian school included the development of orchestration, ornamented instrumental parts, and continuo bass parts, all of which occurred within a span of several decades around 1600. Famous composers in Venice included the Gabrielis, Andrea and Giovanni, as well as Claudio Monteverdi, one of the most significant innovators at the end of the era.\n\nMost parts of Europe had active and well-differentiated musical traditions by late in the century. In England, composers such as Thomas Tallis and William Byrd wrote sacred music in a style similar to that written on the continent, while an active group of home-grown madrigalists adapted the Italian form for English tastes: famous composers included Thomas Morley, John Wilbye and Thomas Weelkes. Spain developed instrumental and vocal styles of its own, with Tomás Luis de Victoria writing refined music similar to that of Palestrina, and numerous other composers writing for the new guitar. Germany cultivated polyphonic forms built on the Protestant chorales, which replaced the Roman Catholic Gregorian Chant as a basis for sacred music, and imported the style of the Venetian school (the appearance of which defined the start of the Baroque era there). In addition, German composers wrote enormous amounts of organ music, establishing the basis for the later Baroque organ style which culminated in the work of J.S. Bach. France developed a unique style of musical diction known as musique mesurée, used in secular chansons, with composers such as Guillaume Costeley and Claude Le Jeune prominent in the movement.\n\nOne of the most revolutionary movements in the era took place in Florence in the 1570s and 1580s, with the work of the Florentine Camerata, who ironically had a reactionary intent: dissatisfied with what they saw as contemporary musical depravities, their goal was to restore the music of the ancient Greeks. Chief among them were Vincenzo Galilei, the father of the astronomer, and Giulio Caccini. The fruits of their labors was a declamatory melodic singing style known as monody, and a corresponding staged dramatic form: a form known today as opera. The first operas, written around 1600, also define the end of the Renaissance and the beginning of the Baroque eras.\n\nMusic prior to 1600 was modal rather than tonal. Several theoretical developments late in the 16th century, such as the writings on scales on modes by Gioseffo Zarlino and Franchinus Gaffurius, led directly to the development of common practice tonality. The major and minor scales began to predominate over the old church modes, a feature which was at first most obvious at cadential points in compositions, but gradually became pervasive. Music after 1600, beginning with the tonal music of the Baroque era, is often referred to as belonging to the common practice period.\n\nThe Baroque era took place from 1600 to 1750, as the Baroque artistic style flourished across Europe and, during this time, music expanded in its range and complexity. Baroque music began when the first operas (dramatic solo vocal music accompanied by orchestra) were written. During the Baroque era, polyphonic contrapuntal music, in which multiple, simultaneous independent melody lines were used, remained important (counterpoint was important in the vocal music of the Medieval era). German, Italian, French, Dutch, Polish, Spanish, Portuguese, and English Baroque composers wrote for small ensembles including strings, brass, and woodwinds, as well as for choirs and keyboard instruments such as pipe organ, harpsichord, and clavichord. During this period several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the fugue, the invention, the sonata, and the concerto. The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Important composers from the Baroque era include Johann Sebastian Bach, Arcangelo Corelli, François Couperin, Girolamo Frescobaldi, George Frideric Handel, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Claudio Monteverdi, Georg Philipp Telemann and Antonio Vivaldi.\n\nThe music of the Classical period is characterized by homophonic texture, or an obvious melody with accompaniment. These new melodies tended to be almost voice-like and singable, allowing composers to actually replace singers as the focus of the music. Instrumental music therefore quickly replaced opera and other sung forms (such as oratorio) as the favorite of the musical audience and the epitome of great composition. However, opera did not disappear: during the classical period, several composers began producing operas for the general public in their native languages (previous operas were generally in Italian).\nAlong with the gradual displacement of the voice in favor of stronger, clearer melodies, counterpoint also typically became a decorative flourish, often used near the end of a work or for a single movement. In its stead, simple patterns, such as arpeggios and, in piano music, Alberti bass (an accompaniment with a repeated pattern typically in the left hand), were used to liven the movement of the piece without creating a confusing additional voice. The now-popular instrumental music was dominated by several well-defined forms: the sonata, the symphony, and the concerto, though none of these were specifically defined or taught at the time as they are now in music theory. All three derive from sonata form, which is both the overlying form of an entire work and the structure of a single movement. Sonata form matured during the Classical era to become the primary form of instrumental compositions throughout the 19th century.\n\nThe early Classical period was ushered in by the Mannheim School, which included such composers as Johann Stamitz, Franz Xaver Richter, Carl Stamitz, and Christian Cannabich. It exerted a profound influence on Joseph Haydn and, through him, on all subsequent European music. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was the central figure of the Classical period, and his phenomenal and varied output in all genres defines our perception of the period. Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert were transitional composers, leading into the Romantic period, with their expansion of existing genres, forms, and even functions of music.\n\nIn the Romantic period, music became more expressive and emotional, expanding to encompass literature, art, and philosophy. Famous early Romantic composers include Schumann, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Bellini, and Berlioz. The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra, and in the role of concerts as part of urban society. Famous composers from the second half of the century include Johann Strauss II, Brahms, Liszt, Tchaikovsky, Verdi, and Wagner. Between 1890 and 1910, a third wave of composers including Dvořák, Mahler, Richard Strauss, Puccini, and Sibelius built on the work of middle Romantic composers to create even more complex – and often much longer – musical works. A prominent mark of late 19th century music is its nationalistic fervor, as exemplified by such figures as Dvořák, Sibelius, and Grieg. Other prominent late-century figures include Saint-Saëns, Fauré, Rachmaninoff and Franck.\n\nThe 20th century saw a revolution in music listening as the radio gained popularity worldwide and new media and technologies were developed to record, capture, reproduce and distribute music. Music performances became increasingly visual with the broadcast and recording of music videos and concerts. Music of all kinds also became increasingly portable. Headphones allowed people sitting next to each other to listen to entirely different performances or share the same performance.\n\n20th-century music brought a new freedom and wide experimentation with new musical styles and forms that challenged the accepted rules of music of earlier periods. The invention of musical amplification and electronic instruments, especially the synthesizer, in the mid-20th century revolutionized popular music and accelerated the development of new forms of music.\n\nAs for classical music, two fundamental schools determined the course of the century: that of Arnold Schoenberg and that of Igor Stravinsky.\n\nSub-Saharan African music is by a strong rhythmic interest that exhibits common characteristics in all regions of this vast territory, so that Arthur Morris Jones (1889–1980) has described the many local approaches as constituting one main system.\nC. K. also affirms the profound homogeneity of approach. West African rhythmic techniques carried over the Atlantic were fundamental ingredients in various musical styles of the Americas: samba, forró, maracatu and coco in Brazil, Afro-Cuban music and Afro-American musical genres such as blues, jazz, rhythm & blues, funk, soul, reggae, hip hop and rock and roll were thereby of immense importance in 20th-century popular music.\n\nByzantine music (Greek: Βυζαντινή Μουσική) is the music of the Byzantine Empire composed to Greek texts as ceremonial, festival, or church music. Greek and foreign historians agree that the ecclesiastical tones and in general the whole system of Byzantine music is closely related to the ancient Greek system. It remains the oldest genre of extant music, of which the manner of performance and (with increasing accuracy from the 5th century onwards) the names of the composers, and sometimes the particulars of each musical work's circumstances, are known.\n\nAsian music covers the music cultures of Arabia, Central Asia, East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.\n\nIndian music is one of the oldest musical traditions in the world. The Indus Valley civilization left sculptures which show dance and musical instruments (some no longer in use), like the seven holed flute. Various types of stringed instruments and drums have been recovered from Harrappa and Mohenjo Daro by excavations carried out by Sir Mortimer Wheeler. The Rigveda has elements of present Indian music, with a musical notation to denote the metre and the mode of chanting. Early Indian musical tradition also speaks of three accents and vocal music known as \"Samagan\" (Sama meaning melody and Gan meaning to sing). The classical music of India includes two major traditions: the southern Carnatic music and the northern Hindustani classical music. India's classical music tradition is millennia long and remains important to the lives of Indians today as a source of religious inspiration, cultural expression, and entertainment.\n\nIndian classical music (marga) is monophonic, and based on a single melody line or raga rhythmically organized through talas. Carnatic music is largely devotional; the majority of the songs are addressed to the Hindu deities. There are a lot of songs emphasising love and other social issues. In contrast to Carnatic music, Hindustani music was not only influenced by ancient Hindu musical traditions, Vedic philosophy and native Indian sounds but also by the Persian performance practices of the Afghan Mughals. The origins of Indian classical music can be found from the oldest of scriptures, part of the Hindu tradition, the Vedas. Samaveda, one of the four vedas describes music at length.\n\nChinese classical music is the traditional art or court music of China. It has a long history stretching for more than three thousand years. It has its own unique systems of musical notation, as well as musical tuning and pitch, musical instruments and styles or musical genres. Chinese music is pentatonic-diatonic, having a scale of twelve notes to an octave (5+7 = 12) as does European-influenced music.\n\nPersian music is the music of Persia and Persian language countries: \"musiqi\", the science and art of music, and \"muzik\", the sound and performance of music . See: Music of Iran, Music of Afghanistan, Music of Tajikistan, Music of Uzbekistan.\n\nTo the right are some music samples.\n\n\n\n"}

The anagram map was circulated on the web in February 2006.\n\nThe map was featured on thousands of blogs before a Transport for London lawyer requested that the map be removed. It inspired some people to create anagram versions of their hometown's metro system with similar legal repercussions. The fact that it was appreciated internationally, despite some not knowing the stations behind the anagrams, is a recognition of Harry Beck's iconic Tube map design.\n\nThe map was created by 'Barry Heck' using a photoshopped Tube map and an online anagram generator, on 7 February 2006. It was originally shown in a thread on the Thingbox chat forum and, after being submitted by one of the site owners, appeared on BoingBoing a couple of days later receiving 31,000 hits within the next six days. (The name Barry Heck is a pseudonym chosen because it is an anagram and spoonerism of Harry Beck.)\n\nThe idea came from The Great Bear, a 1992 artwork by UK artist Simon Patterson on display at Tate Modern in London, but it was not until Dorian Lynskey's music genre tube map appeared in a newspaper in 2006 that Barry Heck decided to make it. \n\nIn 2000, Scottish artist Mark Campbell created the Glasgow Anagram Tour which involved a large light box anagram map of glasgow and Pop-out Maps with anagrams of Glasgow's cultural establishments which were for sale to commemorate Scotland's Year of the Artist 2000.\n\nTransport for London claimed the image was a copyright infringement and had one of their lawyers ask for the map to be removed from the web. The site hosting it complied and it was removed on 22 February 2006 with the action being reported on BoingBoing again.\n\nTransport for London also censored other websites that hosted the image such as the www.geofftech.co.uk site. But an online backlash against TFL's lawyers meant that many other websites made mirrors of Geoff's page, thus resulting in more copies of tube map \"mash-ups\" on the internet.\n\nThe owner of the site – Geoff Marshall, was interviewed on BBC Radio 5 Live by Chris Vallance about \"map-mashing\" (making parody maps) in which the London Underground anagram map was discussed. This was broadcast on 14 March 2006.\n\nBoingBoing has reported that Washington, Toronto, Amsterdam, Chicago, Oslo, Boston, New York City, Atlanta, Sydney, and Vienna had anagram maps created for their metro systems, inspired by the London map.\n\nThe anagram map was featured in thousands of blogs and its progress can be tracked at Technorati.com. Because of similarities with Neverwhere it was mentioned in the letters page of author Neil Gaiman's blog, with his fanbase ensuring over 1,700 others linked to it. But nearly 21,000 other blogs linked to BoingBoing's article alone.\n\nBlackwall and Hornchurch stations could not be properly anagrammatized and instead were split into their component words and reversed to produce \"Wall Black\" and \"Church Horn\" respectively. Burch Chow/Chow Burch (from the gynaecological Burch procedure) was rejected as an anagram for Bow Church, because of a dislike for uncommon proper nouns, leaving it reversed as \"Church Bow\". Bank was anagrammatized into 'nabk', the edible berry of the Ziziphus lotus tree.\n\nNot all derivatives for other cities followed this pattern. For Toronto, the impossible stations were named after streets, so the namesake's designation as \"Avenue\" or \"Street\" was appended before anagramming (Queen became Queen Street became Queerest Ten).\n\n"}

{"id": "24438177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24438177", "title": "Monte Bank", "text": "Monte Bank\n\nMonte Bank, Mountebank, Spanish Monte and Mexican Monte, sometimes just Monte, is a Spanish gambling card game and was known in the 19th century as the national card game of Mexico. It ultimately derives from basset, where the banker (dealer) pays on matching cards. The term \"monte\" has also been used for a variety of other gambling games, especially varieties of three-card poker, and for the swindle three-card monte.\n\nThe two-card version Mexican monte, and the four-card version Spanish monte, are card games played in Spain before coming to Mexico and then the American Southwest. They were originally played with Spanish playing cards and later with cards made expressly for the game, known as Monte cards, as well as modified standard decks. These games became popular in the United States, specially in Texas, after they were brought back by returning troops from the Mexican–American War in 1848. They remained popular through the end of the century particularly in the American West, and even among the American Indians.\n\nMonte uses a deck of 40 playing cards (removing the 10s, 9s, and 8s from a standard 52-card deck). One or more people may play against the house, known as the \"bank\" or \"banker\", who is the dealer.\n\nIn some versions, the monte banker, or dealer, must have the whole of his bank, or money which he risks at the game, in sight upon the table. The play begins with the dealer drawing one card from the bottom of the deck and placing it face up on the table, this card becomes the “bottom layout”. Similarly, another card is drawn from the top of the deck, known as the “top layout”, and placed face up on the table, usually closer to the dealer. The remaining stack of cards, called the “monte”, is placed face-down in front of the dealer. Sometimes a monte box was used to hold the monte.\n\nThe players, sometimes known as punters, place bets on the layout of their choice, or on both. Starting with the player to banker's right and proceeding counter-clockwise, each player has one chance to place his stake on the layouts. After the last player has placed his stake, the banker turns the monte face-up. The card now showing is known as the “gate”. The banker pays, one for one, any bet on a matching suit. The banker takes all the bets from a layout if the “gate” did not match the suit in the layout.\n\nThe play in four-card monte is similar. Instead of one card in the bottom and top layouts, the dealer takes two cards from the top and two more from the bottom of the deck and place them all slightly apart upon the table to form the \"bottom layout\" and the \"top layout\", respectively. The deal is valid whatever suit appears, even if all four cards are of the same suit. Except for the banker, each player may bet on either pair or both, by placing the bet between that pair. If the “gate” card's suit matches one or both of the cards in a layout, or even cards in both layouts, the players win any bets, but if no card is matched all bets are lost. This decreases the house odds somewhat, as there are frequently two suits in a layout, increasing the possibility of a match.\n\nAfter the hand, known as \"coup\", the banker collects all losing bets and pays the winners one to one, all players whose bets matched the “gate” card in the layout. He then takes both layouts off the table, placing them aside to form a discard pile. Turning the \"monte\" face down, he takes the used “gate” card from the bottom of the deck and also puts it on the discard pile. He then deals for the next layout without shuffling or cutting the cards.\n\nThe bank and deal remain with one player up to a maximum of five \"coups\", six, or any previously agreed number of hands, when all of the cards are reshuffled together and in friendly play the bank (dealer) passes to the left. At least ten cards should remain unplayed to prevent players from calculating which suits still remain in the deck. If at any time the bank is emptied, bank and deal pass to the left. In casino play, the house retains the bank.\n\n\n"}

The day is celebrated on the first Thursday in May of every year, to coincide with the National Day of Prayer, which many atheist and secular groups view to be unconstitutional. The purpose of the National Day of Reason is to \"celebrate reason—a concept all Americans can support—and to raise public awareness about the persistent threat to religious liberty posed by government intrusion into the private sphere of worship.\" The National Day of Reason is also meant to help build community among the non-religious in the United States.\n\nThe National Day of Reason was created by the American Humanist Association and the Washington Area Secular Humanists in 2003. In addition to serving as a holiday for constitutionalists and secularists, the National Day of Reason was created in response to the perceived unconstitutionality of the National Day of Prayer. According to the organizers of the National Day of Reason, the National Day of Prayer, \"violates the First Amendment of the United States Constitution because it asks federal, state, and local government entities to set aside tax dollar supported time and space to engage in religious ceremonies\".\n\nIn 2005, the New York city-based Center for Atheism began to strongly advocate for observers of the National Day of Reason to celebrate in a positive manner. They decided to donate blood as a group in order to make a \"public statement about the life-affirming ideas of nonbelievers.\"\n\nThe National Day of Reason has taken some time to gain popularity, however, over time, more local and state governments have been giving the Day of Reason official recognition. In 2011 and 2012, Representative Pete Stark supported a proclamation in support of the National Day of Reason in the United States House of Representatives. For the first time, a resolution to honor the National Day of Reason was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives. The resolution, U.S. House Resolution 228, was proposed by Representative Mike Honda on April 29, 2015. Another resolution to designate the National Day of Reason was sponsored by Representative Jared Huffman in 2018.\n\nSeveral organizations associated with the National Day of Reason have organized food drives and blood donations, while other groups have called for an end to prayer invocations at city meetings. Other organizations, such as the Oklahoma Atheists and the Minnesota Atheists, have organized local secular celebrations as alternatives to the National Day of Prayer. Additionally, many individuals affiliated with these atheistic groups choose to protest the National Day of Prayer.\n\nSome politicians have supported the National Day of Reason. In Omaha, Nebraska, Mayor Jean Stothert signed a proclamation supporting the National Day of Reason and urging all citizens to \"promote the development and application of reason.\" City governments who affirm the National Day of Prayer have also been asked to consider affirming the National Day of Reason as well.\n\n"}

(The Italian translation was titled \"Lo squalificato\", \"The Disqualified\".)\n\nThis novel, despite being serialized as a work of fiction in 1948, is narrated in the first person and contains several elements which betray an autobiographical basis, such as suicide—a recurring theme in the author's life. Many also believe the book to have been his will, as he took his own life shortly after the last part of the book was published, on June 13, 1948.\n\nOne modern analyst has proposed Dazai was suffering from complex post-traumatic stress disorder when he wrote the book.\n\n\"No Longer Human\" is told in the form of notebooks left by one , a troubled man incapable of revealing his true self to others, and who is instead forced to uphold a facade of hollow jocularity.\n\nThe novel is composed of three chapters, or \"memoranda\", which chronicle the life of Ōba from early childhood to late twenties.\n\n\nThe story is bookended with two other, shorter, chapters from the point of view of a neutral observer, who sees three photos of Ōba and eventually tracks down one of the characters mentioned in the notebooks who knew him personally.\n\nŌba refers to himself throughout the book using the reflexive pronoun , whereas the personal pronoun is used both in the foreword and afterword to the book by the writer, whose name is unclear. The name \"Ōba\" is actually taken from one of Dazai's early works, .\n\n\"Ningen Shikkaku\" was adapted to film in 2009, the 100th anniversary of Dazai's birth. The film was directed by Genjiro Arato, the producer responsible for the award-winning \"Zigeunerweisen\" in 1980. Filming started in July, and it was released on February 20, 2010.\nThe film stars Toma Ikuta (24) as Ōba Yōzō, a young man who finds it hard to relate to the world around him, but masks this sense of alienation with a jovial demeanor. Still, his life spirals toward self-destruction. Actress Satomi Ishihara (22) plays one of the several women in his life, and the only one he marries.\nThe film was marketed outside Japan under the title \"Fallen Angel\".\n\nA new version of \"Ningen Shikkaku\" is to be released in 2019, starring Shun Oguri in the role of writer Osamu Dazai. Movie is directed by photographer and film director Mika Ninagawa.\n\nAnother adaption of the story was told in the four first episodes of the anime series \"Aoi Bungaku\" that was released in 2009. The anime won the Platinum Grand Prize at the Future Film festival in Italy.\n\nAn anime titled \"Bungou Stray Dogs\" features a character named after Osamu, as well as various influences from \"No Longer Human\".\n\nUsamaru Furuya created a three-volume manga version of \"No Longer Human\", serialized in Shinchosha's \"Comic Bunch\" magazine beginning in number 10, 2009. An English edition was published by Vertical, Inc. in 2011–2012.\n\nYasunori Ninose created another manga version of \"No Longer Human\", titled \"Ningen Shikkaku Kai\" (壊,\"kai\" = \"destruction\"), serialized in \"Champion Red\" from April to July in 2010. Unlike Furuya's version, this manga depicts human beings' negative emotion and sexual intercourse as tentacles, which have enthralled Ninose since he was five years old.\n\nA third version (), a straight retelling of the story in its original pre-WWII setting, was commissioned for the \"Manga de Dokuha\" series (comic adaptations of classic literature), published by Gakken. An English edition was published in online format by JManga in 2011.\n\nWilliam Bradbury of \"The Japan Times\" called it a timeless novel, saying that \"The struggle of the individual to fit into a normalizing society remains just as relevant today as it was at the time of writing.\" Serdar Yegulalp of Genji Press noted the strength of Dazai in portraying the situation of the protagonist, describing the novel as \"bleak in a way that is both extreme and yet also strangely unforced\". Both critics have noted the autobiographical qualities of the novel, but claim that Dazai's style causes readers to connect to Ōba rather than focus on the author.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2375938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2375938", "title": "Perceptor", "text": "Perceptor\n\nPerceptor is the name of several different fictional characters in the Transformers franchise.\n\nPerceptor (Percepto in France, Supervista (\"Superviser\") in Italy) transforms into a microscope that also functions as a telescope. He is a renowned Cybertronian Autobot scientist and craves knowledge. His discoveries have helped his allies on many occasions. His specialties lie in metallurgy, electrical engineering, and other sciences closely related to Transformer physiology though his intelligence has made him reliable in many fields. Though he is an awful bore, but all the Autobots estimate and like him because of his good nature. He is always ready to help and to save everybody (even Megatron himself) whose life is in danger. Engaging in a physical melee is not his preference, but when he fights Decepticons he uses a concussion rifle.\n\nAccording to the voice actor Paul Eiding, Perceptor was voiced with inspiration from C-3PO and The Absent-Minded Professor with a British accent.\n\nPerceptor was named the oddest thing that G1 Transformers transform into by Topless Robot.\n\nPerceptor was originally part of an Autobot group in the \"Dead End\" region of Cybertron. Serving as the group's scientist, Perceptor would nonetheless lead a mission to save the captured Blaster from being executed by the local Decepticon commander Lord Straxus. Later, he was opposed to the plan to save the captive scientist Spanner, but was outvoted. Accompanying the others to blow up the Decepticon base, they were horrified to discover that the Decepticons had built Spanner into the Space Bridge itself. Destroying the Bridge as a mercy-killing, Perceptor and his comrades (Beachcomber, Blaster, Cosmos, Powerglide, Seaspray and Warpath), with no chance of escaping to Cybertron, crossed the bridge to Earth.\n\nAfter an attack by Megatron, they were then captured by Circuit Breaker and her Rapid Anti-Robot Attack Team, taken to her lab and then dissected. After capturing the Aerialbots she encountered a new problem - the Decepticon Battlechargers Runabout and Runamuck were causing mayhem across America. Using the parts from all the captured Autobots she created a giant Autobot with herself in control, striking a deal with them that if they would co-operate she would let them go. Circuit Breaker then used them to battle the two Decepticons, who were attacking the Statue of Liberty. After defeating the Decepticons with Circuit Breaker the Autobots were released.\n\nAfter a side-adventure in the U.K. comics in which they encountered (and were almost killed by) the future Decepticon Galvatron, Perceptor's group linked up with the main Autobots - only to learn of the death of Optimus Prime.\n\nIn issue #27, \"King of the Hill!\", Perceptor summoned his fellow Autobots Blaster, Hot Spot, Jetfire, Omega Supreme, Ratchet and Silverbolt in order to decide who should take leadership of the Autobots. After an attack by the giant Decepticon Trypticon the leader was chosen - Grimlock.\n\nHe soon regretted this, as Grimlock became more and more tyrannical. After Blaster returned (having gone rogue over Grimlock's leadership) Perceptor was one of those who welcomed him back.\n\nAfter Prime's return as a Powermaster, Perceptor continued to serve loyally, battling the Decepticons in the Arctic and getting jumped by the Seacons in the process. Perceptor was deactivated when Starscream blew up the Decepticon island ship with Perceptor aboard in Transformers #50.\n\nPerceptor's body was seen among the deactivated Autobots Ratchet was doing his best to revive in Transformers #56, \"Back from the Dead\".\n\nThe future movie continuity also appeared in the \"Space Pirates\" arc of the UK comic, where he was defeated in the Quintesson attack on Autobot City.\n\nPerceptor would appear in the comics as one of the Autobot scientists studying the victims of the Swarm, indicating he was revived by Nucleon at some point.\n\nPerceptor made his first appearance in \"Dinobot Island Part 2\" when he assisted Chip Chase at understanding some unusual phenomena occurring in that episode.\n\nHis first major role is in \"Microbots\" when Megatron acquired \"the Heart of Cybertron\", which was decimating the Autobots. He used his shrinking device to shrink himself, Bumblebee and Brawn, so they could infiltrate Megatron's body and disable the Heart of Cybertron, which he later destroyed.\n\nIn \"The Golden Lagoon\" episode, Perceptor with some Autobots were out until they were attacked by the Decepticon's then he and Seaspray got captured as they were brought to Megatron's underwater headquarters. Later, Perceptor with Seaspray were brought in by Starscream to entertain him and the rest of the Decepticon's where they tried to escape but were caught by Megatron when he came back with a captured Beachcomber. Thanks to Beachcomber, Perceptor with Seaspray and Beachcomber were able to escape then headed over to the golden lagoon, filled with electrum. After meeting up with the rest of the Autobots, Perceptor joined the battle against the Decepticon's while covered in electrum as they were able to send them retreating, after their electrum wore off and when they destroy the golden lagoon. \n\nIn the episode \"The God Gambit\" Cosmos collected data in space on a potential new power source, but was attacked by Astrotrain, Thrust and Starscream. Crashing on the moon Titan, the local priests worshiped the Decepticons as \"Sky Gods\", but rebels were able to reactivate Cosmos and call for aid from the Autobots. Optimus Prime sent Omega Supreme with Perceptor and Jazz. Astrotrain set himself up as the chief god of the moon and forced the natives to gather energy crystals. The trip to Titan drained Omega of most of his energy, but Perceptor and Jazz were able to gather enough crystals to reactivate Omega and defeat the three Decepticons. Vowing to not let the Autobots gain the crystals, Astrotrain set up a chain reaction destroying them. The Autobots aided the natives to escape the explosion and helped them settle in another area of the moon.\n\nPerceptor appeared in \"Cosmic Rust\", where he invented Corrostop and using special rust-proof formula on the Statue of Liberty. In the episode, Megatron had been infected with some disease that made him rust. Perceptor was kidnapped by the Stunticons and Blitzwing to treat Megatron's hideous rusting. He diagnoses it as \"cosmic rust\", and uses some of the formula on Megatron. He himself was also infected, as well as all the Autobots. He and fellow Autobot scientist Wheeljack got the Matter Duplicator to duplicate the rust-proof formula, as the key ingredient was extinct. With this, the cosmic rust was gone, and the Autobots were saved.\n\nPerceptor would continue to appear throughout season 3, acting as Rodimus Prime's scientific advisor. Perceptor was one of the known pre-1986 Autobots to survive \"\", along with Jazz, Cliffjumper, Bumblebee, Blaster, Cosmos, Seaspray, Beachcomber, Warpath, Powerglide, Omega Supreme, the Aerialbots, the Protectobots, and the Dinobots. His role as chief Autobot scientist meant he could be used instead of either Ratchet and Wheeljack, whose toys had been discontinued; both being killed off in \"The Transformers: The Movie\".\n\nIn episode 78, \"Madman's Paradise\", Spike Witwicky and his wife Carly hosted a banquet for a visiting ambassador. Their son Daniel got bored and wandered off. Grimlock followed him, and they fell into a lost chamber where Quintessons banished their criminals to other dimensions. They slipped through to the sorcerous other-dimensional realm of Menonia, and were tricked into fighting on the Red Wizard's side, only to find out that he was the Quintesson criminal, who overthrew the Golden One. Ultra Magnus, Blaster, Eject, Rewind, Ramhorn, and Steeljaw followed, and using Blaster's amplification, they help the Golden One defeat the Red Wizard. With the help of Perceptor, the Autobots and Daniel all returned to Cybertron.\n\nPerceptor last appeared in episode 93, \"The Face of Ninjika\". Battling over a Quadrant Lock Disc, Autobot, Decepticon, and Quintesson forces cross a rip in space and become trapped there, landing on the planet Zimojin. An inhabitant named Katsu Don, a Zamojin, removes Perceptor's Autobot sigil which had his universal emulator on it and uses it as the head and face for an ancient robot named Ninjika. Due to having his universal emulator inside his Autobot sigil, Perceptor's consciousness transferred inside the robot body, due to his real robot body suffering from transformation lock. Perceptor befriended Katsu Don as he tells him about the history of his world then they headed over to his town to warn his people about the Quintesson, who sealed the Zamojin world away with the quadrant lock. However, Perceptor ended up getting captured and was forced to give the Quintesson his universal emulator in exchange for Katsu Don safety, who was captured with him. Perceptor hacked into the Quintesson quadrant lock to help free the Zamojin world then was rescued by his Autobots friends. After the Quintesson and Cyclonus retreated off the planet, Perceptor was put back in his robot body and his transformation lock was fixed also he was very pleased to see that his new friend world was put back into right but was more pleased to hear that Katsu Don is gonna continue the work his ancestor did. \n\nPerceptor made an appearance in 1989, in Transformers: Victory in Japan. Wheeljack, along with Perceptor and Minerva were called upon to save God Ginrai, who they converted into Victory Leo.\n\nPerceptor appeared in the Classicverse Lithograph sold at BotCon 2007.\n\nIn the story \"Games of Decepticon\" Springer uses a jamming device given to him by Perceptor to disrupt the Cerebro Shells used by Bugbite to control the Decepticons.\n\nIn \"Transformers Invasion\" Perceptor is among the Autobots in Canada who help get people to safety from an Earthquake caused by \"Shattered Glass\" Ultra Magnus using the Terminus Blade.\n\nPerceptor would make his first chronological appearance in the third volume of \"The War Within\", as an Autobot scientist supporting the peace between the Autobots, Decepticons and Ultracons. Megatron's return with a massive army of Seeker clones forced Perceptor to seek a desperate solution - locating the missing Optimus Prime. Recruiting the Turbomasters, Perceptor hoped to use his equipment to find where Optimus had been transported to - but Flash interfered with it and was transported instead. Dreamwave's closure would prevent this story from being finished.\n\nLater, he appeared in the second volume of the Generation One series as part of an Autobot resistance movement opposed to Shockwave. He appears pleading with the Cybertronian Council to investigate Shockwave's modifications to other Transformers, but would later join Prime's attack on Iacon.\n\nPerceptor featured in the second G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers tale from Devil's Due Publishing, as one of the resistance group under Ultra Magnus.\n\nPerceptor returned in the third series of G.I. Joe vs. The Transformers. Grimlock, Arcee, Bumblebee and Perceptor were sent to Earth to aid G.I. Joe in removing the influence of Cybertonian technology on the planet. Several of the Joes, such as Snake Eyes, Hawk and Roadblock, end up piloting large, human-like robots themselves. When Cobra attacks the Joe base, the Autobots helped repel the Cobra Battle Android Trooper armies. An investigation reveals a secret facility literally beneath the Joe's own HQ. Megatron's head is found, inactive and on the floor. Perceptor is enraged, believing Hawk had violated their agreement by messing around with Cybertronian technology. He is soon convinced that Hawk did not know this was happening. The existence of the facility's project, Serpentor, is discovered. A robot himself, smaller than the ones the Joe's pilot, he has the ability to take over mechanical systems with coils. Though the Transformer technology gives him trouble, all of the Joe's mechas are corrupted. Perceptor ends up personally battling Scarlett's mecha, though she is not in it. Serpentor soon literally buries the entire team in rubble, leaving to conquer Cybertron.\n\nPursuing Serpentor to Cybertron (and unable to convince Hawk to stay behind) the group were quickly captured by Serpentor's new army, but were freed by Snake Eyes and Scarlett. Wounded by the Cobra Commander possessed Serpentor, Perceptor later recovers, laughing at Roadblock tales.\n\nPerceptor appeared in a flashback scene in issue #2 of the Transformers: Universe - Wreckers comic, where Rodimus Prime consulted Quickmix, Skids, Perceptor and Rad on his plans to send out ships to gather information on threats from space after the defeat of Unicron.\n\nPerceptor made his first IDW Publishing appearance in \"\" issue on Kup, as the head of a team aboard the Ark-17 trying to rescue the veteran Autobot. However, the radiation filled surroundings and Kup's madness led to the failure of all rescue attempts. Perceptor then attempted to reason with Springer, agreeing with Prowl that it was a waste of lives and resources - until Trailbreaker arrived.\n\nPerceptor was on the Autobot Orbital Command Hub in \"Spotlight: Blaster\". He was present when Blaster was recovered and returned to the Autobots.\n\nPerceptor is mentioned in the final BotCon storyline, \"Dawn of the Predacus,\" in which he detected the Tripredacus Council's experiments with transwarp technology. He subsequently perished under unknown circumstances, forcing the Primal Council to replace him with the shellshocked Autobot Unit-3 in their formation of Magnaboss.\n\nPerceptor appears in the Tfcon 2008 voice play prelude comic called \"Ground Effects\" where he detects a repeat repeat wave.\n\nPerceptor appears among the characters in \"Re-Unification\", the 2010 TFcon voice actor play prelude comic.\n\nThe name Perceptor reappeared in the \"Transformers: Armada\" line, this time as the name of a Mini-Con combiner formed from the members of the Street Action Team.\n\nPerceptor's bio told how the three beings that make up Perceptor - Grindor, High Wire and Sureshock - are, despite the war raging over them, unflaggingly, unfailingly positive. They try to help all those they meet, and it is this common unity that explains why they work so well together as Perceptor. It stands as a symbol of Mini-Con unity, battling the Decepticons on their own terms, with their unbelievable coordination giving them an edge. However, this comes at a price - Megatron desires their abilities, and will stop at nothing to possess them.\n\nIn the Energon comic series by Dreamwave comics Perceptor appeared in issues 27-29 of the series. He originally appeared as part of the Autobot reinforcements under Jetfire who headed to Earth to fend off the Terrorcon invasion. Perceptor was part of the team who travelled to Los Angeles to battle the Insecticon clones, alongside Landquake, Cliffjumper, Bulkhead and Tow-Line. They were in danger of being overwhelmed by the sheer number of clones until they were rescued by a surprising source - Megatron, resurrected in a new body by Optimus Prime. Megatron decimated the Insecticon clones, leaving the Autobots to help with the devastation.\n\nPerceptor appeared in IDW's Transformers Collectors Club exclusive comic story, set during the events of . He appeared as one of the Mini-Cons loyal to the Mini-Con council, battling the rebel forces of Thrust and Sunstorm. However, when Unicron attacked Cybertron once again, Perceptor was one of those who battled Soundwave, forcing him to flee. However, in \"Revelations part 6\", Optimus Prime returned to Cybertron, bearing word of Vector Prime's death in battle. Perceptor was amongst those that mourned his loss.\n\n\nThis Perceptor is an evil mirror-image of the \"Generation 1\" character. In contrast to the original's peaceful nature, this Perceptor is portrayed as being very violent.\n\nPerceptor was seen standing guard in Autobot headquarters in Fun Publications \"Transformers: Timelines\" story \"Shattered Glass\".\n\nPerceptor appears in the story arc \"Reunification\" by Fun Publications. This character is one of 's evil Autobots, but secretly loyal to . He takes captive at the order of Alpha Trion.\n\nThe Decepticon Magnificus redeco of the original Perceptor toy has been repurposed as Shattered Glass Perceptor.\n\nPerceptor was recently confirmed for the third season by show artist Derrick J Wyatt. His appearance is very G1-based although he now has a large cranium, what appear to be glasses, and has very scrawny limbs. A leaked model sheet revealed that his vehicle mode is that of a pick-up truck, the rear of which can transform into a mini-laboratory.\n\nUnlike all of the other characters in the series, Perceptor is voiced by a computer through speech synthesis, using the \"Fred\" voice in Mac OS X's PlainTalk software.\n\nIn the episode \"Transwarped\" it was revealed that he was the one who built Omega Supreme. He next appeared in \"Decepticon Air\", unsuccessfully trying to convince Sentinel Prime not to take command of the Autobots following Shockwave's attack on Ultra Magnus. He also appeared in \"This is Why I Hate Machines\", protesting against Sentinel's extreme suggestion to fire on a Decepticon-controlled Omega Supreme.\n\nIn the \"Aligned Universe\", Perceptor is the Autobot's chief scientist, and is one of Optimus' most trusted advisors.\n\nIn the \"\" episode \"T.M.I.\", Bulkhead, whilst transcribing a procedure to form synthetic energon, mentions Perceptor's name as he negates \"Perceptor's paradox\", the nature of which is never specified.\n\nPerceptor appears in \"\" and in the sequel novel \"\". His role is relatively minor-he serves as Optimus Prime's scientific adviser. In homage to his G1 counterpart, he often talks in highly complicated technical terms that infuriate his peers and his commanding officer.\n\nPerceptor appears in \"\".\n\nPerceptor appears in \"\".\n\n"}

Petrushkas are traditionally marionettes, as well as hand puppets. The character is a kind of a jester distinguished by his red dress, a red \"kolpak\", and often a long nose.\n\nAlthough the Russian word \"petrushka\" has a homonym meaning \"parsley\", in this context the word is actually a hypocoristic (diminutive) for \"Pyotr\" (Пётр), which is Peter in Russian. Despite this, the character has little or nothing in common with the Commedia del l'Arte stock characters of Petruccio or Pierrot, but is instead a Russian version of Punch or Pulcinella.\n\nPietro-Mira Pedrillo of Italy, the court jester of the Empress Anna Ioannovna, allegedly served as a prototype for Petrushka.\n\nLike Punch, Petrushka's voice was created with the help of a special whistle, and the dialogue was based on a momentary change of the pishchik and the \"live\" voice of other characters. There were a number of basic plots: the medical treatment of Petrushka, his learning of soldier’s service, the scene with his bride, and the buying of a horse and testing it.\n\nInitially, Petrushka was characteristic of typical slapstick comedy, targeting an adult audience. As puppet theatre gradually became a predominantly children's entertainment, Petrushka became less vulgar and aggressive. In the Soviet Union, Petrushka appeared widely in agitprop theater, defending poor peasants and attacking kulaks.\n\nThe Russian Children's Welfare Society (RCWS) hosts an annual \"Petroushka Ball\", which is named after a version of the Petrushka character who fell in love with a graceful ballerina.\n\n"}

In 1881 her mother and sister were recorded as actresses living in London's theatre district off The Strand, and Leighton started to become known as a child star. Her tall stately appearance, hourglass figure and auburn hair gained her starring roles. In 1898 Leighton married a surgeon, William Hotten George; he was ten years older than her and was dead by 1908. By this time Leighton had a successful stage career in London.\n\nShe was a much loved principal boy in a number of Drury Lane theatre pantomimes. Women dressed in drag were becoming fashionable in the Edwardian theatre and Leighton was a popular artist in this genre. She appeared as Prince Charming, Dick Whittington, Sinbad, Aladdin and in other musical plays. In 1901 she appeared as Doña Teresa in \"The Toreador\".\n\nLeighton went on tour but whilst appearing as Sinbad in Bradford she had an accident, falling off a stage whale during the performance. She recovered but did not continue to play the leads at Drury Lane afterwards.\n\nIn 1911 Leighton met young music hall manager Frederick Charles Cockerill (1882–1953); at the start of the 1914-18 War Cockerill received a commission in the Artists' Rifles and in 1915 he and Leighton married.\n\nLeighton was one of the many stage artists who came under pressure to recruit soldiers through their performances with much emphasis on the patriotic aspect of their songs such as \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\". Leighton was reported to have followed up her act at the Royal Hippodrome, Dover, with a tour of the town depositing 'half a dozen young recruits at Dover town hall'. Cockerill was injured and returned to his home town of Northampton where Leighton continued her recruiting work from The New Theatre, Northampton in 1918.\n\nDuring World War I Leighton appeared in the silent film \"Screen Struck\" (1916), but she was not a success and her career began to fail from this time. Her second and final film was \"Under the Greenwood Tree\" (1929).\n\nLeighton died in Farnworth in Lancashire in 1943. She did not have any children from either of her marriages.\n\n"}

{"id": "26952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26952", "title": "Slave narrative", "text": "Slave narrative\n\nThe slave narrative is a type of literary work that is made up of the written accounts of enslaved Africans in Great Britain and its colonies, including the later United States, Canada, and Caribbean nations. Some six thousand former slaves from North America and the Caribbean gave accounts of their lives during the 18th and 19th centuries, with about 150 narratives published as separate books or pamphlets. In the U.S. during the Great Depression (1930s), more than 2,300 additional oral histories on life during slavery were collected by writers sponsored and published by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration. Most of the 26 audio-recorded interviews are held by the Library of Congress.\n\nSome of the earliest memoirs of captivity known in England and the British Isles were written by white Europeans and later Americans captured and sometimes enslaved in North Africa, usually by Barbary pirates. These were part of a broad category of \"captivity narratives\" by English-speaking Europeans. Beginning in the 18th century, these included accounts by colonists and American settlers in North America and the United States who were captured and held by Native Americans. Several well-known captivity narratives were published before the American Revolution, and they often followed forms established with the narratives of captivity in North Africa. Later North American accounts were by Americans captured by western tribes during 19th-century migrations.\n\nFor the Europeans and Americans, the division between captivity as slaves and as prisoners of war was not always clear. Given the problem of international contemporary slavery in the 20th and 21st centuries, additional slave narratives are being written and published. It is an ubiquitous issue that still persists and remains largely undocumented.\n\nThe development of slave narratives from autobiographical accounts to modern fictional works led to the establishment of slave narratives as a literary genre. This large rubric of this so-called \"captivity literature\" includes more generally \"any account of the life, or a major portion of the life, of a fugitive or former slave, either written or orally related by the slave himself or herself\". Whereas the first narratives told the stories of fugitive or freed slaves in a time of racial prejudice, they further developed into retrospective fictional novels and extended their influence until common days. Not only maintaining the memory and capturing the historical truth transmitted in these accounts, but slave narratives were primarily the tool for fugitive or former slaves to state their independence in the 19th century, and carry on and conserve authentic and true historical facts from a first-person perspective. They go further than just autobiographies, and are moreover \"a source for reconstructing historical experience\". The freed slaves that wrote the narratives are considered as historians, since \"memory and history come together\". These accounts link elements of the slave's personal life and destiny with key historical events, such as the American Civil War and the Underground Railroad.\n\nIn simple, yet powerful storylines, slave narratives follow in general a plot common to all of them: starting from the initial situation, the slave in his master's home, the protagonist escapes in the wilderness and narrates the struggle for survival and recognition throughout his uncertain journey to freedom. After all, these narratives were written retrospectively by freed slaves and/or their abolitionist advocate, hence the focus on the transformation from the dehumanized slave to the self-emancipated free man. This change often entailed literacy as a means to overcome captivity, as the case of Frederick Douglass highlights. The narratives are very graphic to the extent as extensive accounts of e.g. whipping, abuse and rape of enslaved women are exposed in detail (see Treatment of slaves in the United States). The denunciation of the slave owners, in particular their cruelty and hypocrisy, is a recurring theme in slave narratives, and in some examples took a comic stance denouncing the double standards (e.g. in Douglass' narrative, his slave owner Hopkins is a very religious, but also brutal man).\n\nAccording to James Olney, a typical outline looks the following way:\n"}
{"id": "42019540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42019540", "title": "Styx: Master of Shadows", "text": "Styx: Master of Shadows\n\nStyx: Master of Shadows is a stealth video game developed by Cyanide Studios for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game is a prequel, and the second video game to take place in the world established by 2012's \"Of Orcs and Men\".\n\n\"Styx: Master of Shadows\" is a stealth game where the player must keep to the shadows to survive. Styx has arcane abilities that assist him in his escapades, including the ability to make himself invisible (also featured in \"Of Orcs and Men\"), and the ability to use amber-vision to detect hidden foes and areas. His ability to clone himself through magic offers opportunities to disrupt the traditional stealth gaming formula. It gives the player a clone for purposes such as scouting without risk and creating a diversion.\n\nGuards, soldiers and other protectors of the Tower will adapt their behavior dynamically, depending on the player's actions. The player is expected to keep a low profile and prepare a course of action beforehand: study the guard patrols closely, use areas of light and shadow to one's advantage, lure a target to a secluded area to assassinate him silently, or arrange \"accidents\" to remain undetected. \nStyx: Master of Shadows also includes RPG game mechanics, the player gains experience, which can unlock new skills, special moves, new and more lethal weapons, all divided into six talent trees.\n\nStyx infiltrates the Tower of Akenash, a massive flying fortress held aloft by the magic of the World Tree, around which the fortress was built. Styx desires to reach the heart of the World-Tree and rescue an imprisoned friend elsewhere in the fortress, but he doesn't know why he wants to do these things: he suffers from confused memories and a voice in his head that prods him on. When he finally liberates his \"friend\", he discovers that it is a goblin identical to himself. The protagonist up to this point has in fact been a clone of the real Styx, who has been held in an interrogation chamber all this time.\n\nThe original Styx was once an orc scholar who sought to study the World Tree, and somehow was transformed by the tree's magical amber into the first goblin. He has for centuries been plagued by the voices of the elves who sleep among the roots of the World Tree. The elves share a telepathic hive mind, and because they too are creatures of the amber, Styx can hear their chattering and cannot shut it out. Stealing the heart of the World-Tree will silence the elves permanently and possibly give him a means to become an orc again.\n\nOne of the gifts that the amber gave Styx was the ability to spawn clones of himself. Usually these clones are stupid thralls, but when Styx infiltrated Akenash he created a clone with an exceptionally high degree of free will and ability so that it could accomplish more difficult tasks without guidance, such as rescuing Styx if he were captured. The original Styx still considers this clone to be a disposable tool like all the others. Furious, Clone-Styx swears to destroy Original-Styx and make a new life for himself.\n\nWith the help of an elf, Clone-Styx breaks the telepathic control that Original-Styx has on him, then chases Original-Styx to the Heart of the World Tree. Clone-Styx destroys the Heart, then commits suicide by leaping into the pool of amber at the base of the tree. Hordes of goblins, all imperfect clones of Styx, emerge from the amber and tear Original-Styx apart. This is the birth of the goblin race. As the World Tree dies, the magic that kept Akenash aloft fails and the tower crashes to the ground. One clone, perhaps Clone-Styx, emerges from the ruins with his memories gone but with his intellect intact and the awareness that somehow his name is \"Styx\".\n\"Styx: Master of Shadows\" received mixed to positive reviews. Aggregating review website Metacritic gave the Xbox One version 69/100 based on 8 reviews, the Microsoft Windows version 71/100 based on 31 reviews and the PlayStation 4 version 70/100 based on 9 reviews.\n\nBritton Peele of GameSpot complained that the combat \"feels stiff and unwieldy, making battle a painful experience whether you win or lose.\" William Murphy of MMORPG said \"nothing is more frustrating in Styx’s adventure than its combat,\" though he also noted that \"it feels a bit silly to knock a stealth-based game for its combat.\" However, some publications praised the system for disincentivizing confrontation. Geoff Thew of Hardcore Gamer said that \"Styx\" \"makes full-on assaults next to impossible, and forces you to observe, think, and plan in order to advance.\". Thew went on to say that, as a pure stealth game, \"Styx\" delivers \"a satisfying tension that few games can match\", and praised its levels for having \"much more depth than the flat environments typical of the genre,\" concluding that \"Styx\" is \"one of the best titles the [stealth] genre has to offer.\" Heather Newman of Venture Beat said that Styx is \"truly engrossing for hardcore stealth fans, at a bargain price,\" and advised that you should \"be ready to save often and die a lot — with a smile on your face.\"\n\nA sequel of the game, titled \"\" was announced on 14 October 2015. It is powered by Unreal Engine 4, and has a larger budget than the original \"Master of Shadows\". The game was released worldwide on 14 March 2017 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.\n\n"}

It has been running for about a decade. This show was inspired by the 1997 British film \"Full Monty\".\n\n\"Sólo Para Mujeres\" came after the success of its predecessor, \"Sólo Para Hombres\" (\"For Men Only\"), a play that starred Lorena Herrera, among others, and which came about after Herrera's participation in the famous telenovela, \"Dos Mujeres, un Camino\". \"Sólo Para Hombres\" featured Herrera and other famous Mexican actresses dancing on stage with scant outfits. \"Sólo Para Mujeres\" followed the same lines: muscular actors would dance, for an audience that consists mainly of women, wearing underwear only or suggestive clothing.\n\nAlthough Televisa is not directly connected with the play, many of the actors on \"Sólo Para Mujeres\" have had previous experience acting in soap operas for the largest Mexican television network. Among those are Alexis Ayala, Jorge Salinas, Sergio Sendel, Alfonso de Nigris and the play's producer, Sergio Mayer. Former Menudo Johnny Lozada also participated at the play for a number of years.\n\nThe play was not expected to be as successful as \"Sólo Para Hombres\" was: Mexico, as with most of Latin America, still has a society with relatively machista views, and so the first expectations for \"Sólo Para Mujeres\" were that it would last, at most, a couple of years. The play managed, however, to outlast \"Sólo Para Hombres\".\n\nSolo Para Mujeres The Movie is now officially in the Philippines including Aventurera. Coming soon will be upcoming movie produced by Star Cinema, Pantelion Films, DARA TV Production and Viva Films. Directed by Theodore Boborol. starring Sandara Park, David Zepeda, Sergio Mayer, Alexis Ayala, Manuel Landeta, Ignacio Casano, Juan Vidal, Beauty Gonzalez, Sofia Andres, Arci Muñoz, Diego Loyzaga, Ellen Adarna and Ms. Dayanara Torres with Andrés Palacios and Horacio Pancheri and More.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn May 5, 2005, the production team of \"Sólo Para Mujeres\" suffered a tragedy when, during the filming of a video at a Mexico City street, a man who was allegedly driving over the speed limit drove into the scene and crashed his car against the motorcycles used by five members of the \"Sólo Para Mujeres\" play, killing actor Edgar Ponce and injuring three others.\n\nMany among the public are clamoring for a full investigation of the incident. Among some publicly expressed doubts are the fact that the street had not been closed before the filming of the video, and also that the members of \"Sólo Para Mujeres\" were not provided with protective helmets before getting on their motorcycles. Also, driving motorcycles on the street where the tragedy happened is prohibited by the law.\n\nMembers of the play declared that it was not of their knowledge that driving motorcycles was prohibited on the particular street where the tragedy happened, because they had passed there on their bikes before and no one had admonished them for it. On the other hand, the man who drove the car into the motorcycles was released on bond until the case is seen at a Mexican court. Mayer demonstrated great displeasure when given the news that that man was not in jail anymore.\n\nThis show is currently touring the USA with presentations in Atlanta, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Arizona and Miami.\n\n"}

Together, they control 80% of the pan-Arabee ENJ broadcasting market. Though private television stations cannot operate from Saudi soil, the country is a major market for pan-Arab satellite and pay-TV. Saudi investors are behind the major networks MBC, which is based in Dubai, and Emirates based OSN. Although satellite dishes have been officially banned since 1990, Saudi Arabia has the second highest satellite TV penetration in the Arab Region, at 97%, and there are 85 free-to-air satellite channels headquartered in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Saudi government estimated that in 2000 the average Saudi spent 50% to 100% more time watching television than his or her European or US counterpart. On average, 2.7 hours are spent daily watching TV in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe pay-TV market in Saudi Arabia is small, with a penetration estimated at 21%. Al Jazeera Sports is one of the largest pay-TV players in terms of subscriptions, with a market share of 59%. Due to the current absence of cinema in the country, pay TV penetration is expected to increase.\n\nThe first television broadcasts in Saudi Arabia originated from a 200-watt television station, AJL-TV, \"The Eye of the Desert\". These were English-language programs for the personnel of the USAF Dhahran Airfield, and started on 17 June 1955. The programming was from contemporary American television, but all references to Christianity, Israel or alcohol were edited out. In September 1957, ARAMCO began a television service for its 9,000 employees in Dhahran.\n\nFor many years, Wahhabi clerics opposed the establishment of a national television service, as they believed it immoral to produce images of humans. The first national television broadcasts began in 1965, and the first broadcast was a recitation of the Quran. The introduction of television offended some Saudis, and one of King Faisal's nephews, Prince Khalid ibn Musa'id ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz, was killed in a police shootout in August 1965 after he led an assault on one of the new television stations.\n\nNawal Baksh was the first Saudi woman to appear on Saudi television, in 1966. After the 1979 Mecca siege, women were banned from television for a short time, after which written rules for Saudi television continued to include a ban on women appearing during Ramadan.\n\nPrior to the introduction of satellite broadcasting, Saudi TV channels One and Two had a reach of 60% of the adult Saudi population. The exception was with regard to Eastern Province audiences who traditionally tuned into Bahrain TV.\n\nArab satellite first became available in 1985 with the launching of Arabsat, but it was not until the 1990s that satellite television became commercially viable. Accessibility of Western entertainment and news programs had a profound effect, as the foreign programs were instantly popular, leading Saudi TV to respond with more programs, including a live political talk show in which senior officials responded to questions by viewers.\n\nThe first private satellite channel in the Arab world, the Middle East Broadcasting Centre, was founded in 1991. In the early 1990s, King Fahd began to invest in the television business through Abdul Aziz Al Ibrahim and Khalid Al Ibrahim, the brothers of Al-Johara, his favourite wife. Other private channels soon followed, led for the most part by Saudis and Lebanese. By 2003, there were 15 private Arab satellite television channels, four of them owned by Saudis.\n\nBy the mid-2000s, many women presented shows on Saudi television. After trials in 2004 and 2005 in Jeddah, Digital Terrestrial Television launched in July 2006 and covered five major cities. To continue DTT transition and extend the service across the Kingdom, the Ministry of Culture and Information signed a contract with Thomson in May 2008. By 2010, its network of 100 digital terrestrial broadcasting towers covered nearly 90% of the population. However, probably due to the adoption of multichannel TV on satellite, the uptake of DTT remains limited; in 2012 it was estimated at 1% of total households.\n\nThe terrestrial broadcast sector in Saudi Arabia is state-owned through the Ministry of Culture and Information. The state-run Broadcasting Services of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia operates almost all domestic broadcasting outlets. State-run television consists of four channels: Saudi One, the main channel in Arabic launched in 1963; Saudi Two, an English language channel; Al Riyadiah, a sports channel; and the news channel Al Ekhbariya.\n\nGovernment-owned terrestrial television has changed little since 1969. Its programming is still predominantly focused on educational, entertainment, and religious subjects. Reruns of Arabic-language cinema, particularly Egyptian movies, are also broadcast. Political content other than official government announcements has remained relatively limited.\n\nKalam Nawaaem, a popular female-hosted Arabic talkshow discussing various societal topics, and Arab Idol, both showing on MBC, are the most popular TV programs in Saudi Arabia. Sada Al Malaeb, a sports talkshow, is the third preferred show. Turkish drama series also capture a strong following.\n\nAverage daily reach, total Arab population, September 2011:\n\n\n"}

Longfellow claimed that the story was true, but the historical evidence is inconclusive. Nevertheless, the ballad was very popular in nineteenth-century America, immortalizing the Pilgrims.\n\nThe poem was a literary counterpoint to Longfellow's earlier \"Evangeline\" (1847), the tragic tale of a woman whose lover disappears during the deportation of the Acadian people in 1755. Together, \"Evangeline\" and \"The Courtship of Miles Standish\" captured the bittersweet quality of America's colonial era. However, the plot of \"The Courtship of Miles Standish\" deliberately varies in emotional tone, unlike the steady tragedy of Longfellow's \"Evangeline\". The Pilgrims grimly battle against disease and Indians, but are also obsessed with an eccentric love triangle, creating a curious mix of drama and comedy. Bumbling, feuding roommates Miles Standish and John Alden vie for the affections of the beautiful Priscilla Mullins, who slyly tweaks the noses of her undiplomatic suitors. The independent-minded woman utters the famous retort, \"Why don't you speak for yourself, John?\" The saga has a surprise ending, one full of optimism for the American future.\n\nThis story takes place nearly 400 years ago (c. 1621) and led to a marital union that has produced numerous descendants in North America. Many Canadians and Americans living today are direct descendants of this love story.\n\nA debate persists as to whether the tale is fact or fiction. Main characters Miles Standish, John Alden, and Priscilla Mullins are based upon real \"Mayflower\" Pilgrims. Longfellow was a descendant of the Pilgrims through his mother Zilpah Wadsworth, including John Alden and Priscilla Mullins, and he claimed that he was relating oral history. Skeptics dismiss his saga as a folktale, but no conclusive evidence exists either way.\n\nAt minimum, Longfellow used poetic license, condensing several years of events. Scholars have confirmed the cherished place of romantic love in Pilgrim culture, and have documented the Indian war described by Longfellow. Circumstantial evidence of the love triangle also exists. Miles Standish and John Alden were likely roommates; Priscilla Mullins was the only single woman of marriageable age. The families of the alleged lovers remained close for several generations and intermarried, moving together to Duxbury, Massachusetts in the late 1620s. Descendants still retell the love triangle of their ancestors.\n\nThe first reference to the poem recorded in Longfellow's journal is dated December 29, 1857, where the project is referred to as \"Priscilla\". By March 1 the next year, it was renamed \"The Courtship of Miles Standish\".\n\nIt was published in book form on October 16, 1858, and it sold 25,000 copies after two months. Reportedly, 10,000 copies were sold in London in a single day.\n\n\"Courtship of Miles Standish\" is written in dactylic hexameter, the same meter used in classical epic poetry such as Homer's \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\" and Vergil's \"Aeneid\". Longfellow used the same meter in his poem \"Evangeline\". He wrote this poem in the language of English.\n\n\"The Courtship of Miles Standish\" (1923 film)\n\n — includes this poem.\n"}

The documentary was originally broadcast as six one-hour conversations between mythologist Joseph Campbell (1904–1987) and journalist Bill Moyers. It remains one of the most popular series in the history of American public television.\n\nThe interviews in the first five episodes were filmed at George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch in California, with the sixth interview conducted at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, during the final two summers of Campbell's life. (The series was broadcast on television the year following his death.) In these discussions Campbell presents his ideas about comparative mythology and the ongoing role of myth in human society. These talks include excerpts from Campbell's seminal work \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\"\n\nThe documentary series \"Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth\" was broadcast in six parts:\n\nAbout Campbell, hero types, hero deeds, Jesus Christ, the Buddha, Krishna, movie heroes, Star Wars as a metaphor, an Iroquois story: the refusal of suitors, dragons, dreams and Jungian psychology, “follow your bliss,” consciousness in plants, Gaia, Chartres cathedral, spirituality vs. economics, emerging myths, “Earthrise” as a symbol.\n\nCreation myths, transcending duality, pairs of opposites, God vs. Nature, sin, morality, participation in sorrow, the Gospel of Thomas, Old Time Religion, computers, religion as “software,” the story of Indra: “What a great boy am I!,” participation in society.\n\nAnimal memories, harmonization with body and life-cycle, consciousness vs. its vehicle, killing for food, story: “The Buffalo's Wife,” buffalo massacre, initiation ritual, rituals diminishing, crime increasing, artists, the Shaman, the center of the world.\n\nChief Seattle, the sacred Earth, agricultural renewal, human sacrifice, sacrifice of the Mass, transcendence of death, story: “The Green Knight,” societal dictates vs. following bliss, “hidden hands” guiding life's work.\n\nThe Troubadours, Eros, romantic love, Tristan, libido vs. credo, separation from love, Satan, loving your enemy, the Crucifixion as atonement, virgin birth, the story of Isis, Osiris and Horus, the Madonna, the Big Bang, the correlation between the earth or mother Goddess and images of fertility (the sacred feminine).\n\nIdentifying with the infinite, the circle as a symbol, clowns and masks, epiphanies and James Joyce, artistic arrest, the monstrous as sublime, the dance of Shiva, that which is beyond words.\n\nThe companion book for the series, \"The Power of Myth\" (Joseph Campbell, Bill Moyers, and editor Betty Sue Flowers), was released in 1988 at the same time the series aired on PBS. In the editor's note to \"The Power of Myth\", Flowers credits Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, as \"the Doubleday editor, whose interest in the ideas of Joseph Campbell was the prime mover in the publication of this book.\" The book follows the format of the documentary and provides additional discussions not included in the original six-hour release. Chapters:\n\n\n\"The Power of Myth\" is based on the interviews between Joseph Campbell and Bill Moyers that were the basis for the acclaimed television series. It deals with the universality and evolution of myths in the history of the human race and the place of myths in modern society. Campbell blends accounts of his own upbringing and experience with stories from many cultures and civilizations to present the reader with his most compelling thesis that modern society is going through a transition from the old mythologies and traditions to a new way of thinking where a global mythology will emerge.\n\nSome of the material in the first chapter comes from Campbell's previously published books, \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" and \"The Masks of God\". The main theme of the book is the universality of myths—what Campbell calls \"mankind's one great story\"— that occur throughout the history of mankind, no matter which epoch or whichever culture or society is considered. Myths are the body of stories and legends that a people perceive as being an integral part of their culture. Before the invention of writing, these stories and legends were handed down from generation to generation in the form of rituals and oral traditions. The reappearance of certain themes, time and again, in different mythologies, leads to the realization that these themes portray universal and eternal truths about mankind.\n\nCampbell defines the function of a mythology as the provision of a cultural framework for a society or people to educate their young, and to provide them with a means of coping with their passage through the different stages of life from birth to death. In a general sense myths include religion as well and the development of religion is an intrinsic part of a society's culture. A mythology is inevitably bound to the society and time in which it occurs and cannot be divorced from this culture and environment. This is true even though Western society previously learnt from, and was informed by, the mythology of other cultures by including the study of Greek and Roman writings as part of its heritage.\n\nThe record of the history of the development of a culture and society is embodied in its mythology. For example, the Bible describes the evolution of the Judeo-Christian concept of God from the time when the Jews were in Babylon and the god they worshiped corresponded to a local tribal god, to when the concept became that of a world savior as a result of the Hebrews becoming a major force in the East Mediterranean region. The geographic context of a specific mythology also plays a role in its evolution. The physical scope of Biblical mythology was limited to the general area of the Middle East but in other parts of the world, Chinese and Aztec religions and cultures emerged as separate and distinct belief systems. When different cultures expand their spheres of influence they eventually come into contact with each other, and the outcome of the collision, be it conquest, subjugation, or amalgamation, will be evident in the resultant mythology.\n\nThe form and function of mythology in the modern world is the main topic of this chapter and to illustrate his ideas, Campbell recounts aspects of his own earlier life. Without specifically stating it, the assumption is made that the modern world under consideration is that of Campbell's world—the Christian-based, urbanized culture of North America, the so-called Modern Western Society.\n\nCampbell describes his own upbringing as a Roman Catholic and his early fascination with the myths and stories of the American Indians. He recalls the excitement he felt when he realized that the motifs of creation, death, resurrection, and ascension into heaven, which the nuns were teaching him at his school, also occurred in American Indian myths. This was the beginning of his lifelong interest in comparative mythology. Later on in life he found the same universal themes in Hinduism and in the medieval Arthurian legends.\n\nThe discussion considers the role of myth and ritual in contemporary society. Contemporary rituals are carried out to mark special events in private lives, such as an individual's marriage or enlistment in a branch of the armed forces and, on public occasions such as the inauguration of civil and national leaders. In the Introduction to the book, Moyers recalls Campbell's description of the solemn state funeral after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, as an \"illustration of the high service of ritual to a society,\" and where Campbell identifies the ritualized occasion as fulfilling a great social necessity.\n\nIn general, however, Campbell and Moyers, reach the conclusion that there is a lack of effective mythology and ritual in modern American society. They find nothing that compares with the powerful puberty rituals of primitive societies. They claim that the exclusion of classical studies from the modern educational syllabus has led to a lack of awareness of the mythological foundations of western society's heritage. This, combined with an increased materialism and emphasis on technology, has led to modern youth in New York, becoming alienated from the mainstream of society and inventing their own morality, initiations and gangs.\n\nMarriage, as an example of a paramount modern social institution, becomes the next subject of discussion. Campbell differentiates between marriage and love affairs and imparts some very lofty ideals to marriage, in contrast to love affairs, that he categorically states inevitably end in disappointment. True marriage, in Campbell's opinion, embodies a spiritual identity and invokes the image of an incarnate God. Campbell and Moyers agree that the main objective of marriage is not the birth of children and the raising of families. They discard the concept of perpetuation of the human species as being the primary function of marriage and relegate this to a first stage. This first stage is followed by a second one where the offspring have departed into the world and only the couple is left. Campbell invokes the image of marriage as being an ordeal in which the ego is sacrificed to a relationship in which two have become one. This, he states, is a mythological image that embodies the sacrifice of the visible for a transcendent good. Campbell labels this stage of marriage as the alchemical stage. On the subject of the ritual of marriage, Campbell and Moyers complain that it has lost its force and has become a mere remnant of the original; they contend that the ritual that once conveyed an inner reality is now merely form.\n\nThe interviews between Campbell and Moyers are recorded at George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch. Campbell and Lucas became friends when Lucas publicly acknowledged the influence Campbell's writings had on the development of his hugely successful film \"Star Wars.\" Campbell expresses great enthusiasm for this film; a film that he says conforms to classical mythological legends. So it is not surprising that there are many references to the characters from \"Star Wars\" throughout the book. In a similar fashion, John Wayne is identified as a modern myth and Campbell recalls Douglas Fairbanks as having been a boyhood hero.\n\nAt the beginning of this chapter, and in other parts of the book, Campbell states that modern society lacks the stability it previously derived from being educated in the mythology and legends of the Greek and Roman classics. Campbell and Moyers agree that there is no effective mythology in modern society by which individuals can relate to their role in the world. An analysis of the national symbols of the United States is used by Campbell to illustrate the ability for myths to incorporate the beliefs of a whole society and to provide the mythology to unify a nation. More recently, when the image of the earth, taken from the lunar landings, was published, it led to the universal realization that human beings must identify with the entire planet. This concept of the emergence of a new mythology based on global aspects of life is reiterated several times by Campbell.\n\nIn the first episode of the series, \"The Hero's Adventure\", and the fifth chapter of the book, \"The Hero's Adventure,\" Moyers and Campbell discuss George Lucas' report that Campbell's work directly influenced the creation of the \"Star Wars\" films.\nMoyers and Lucas filmed an interview 12 years later in 1999, modeled after \"The Power of Myth\". It was called the \"Mythology of Star Wars with George Lucas & Bill Moyers\" and further discussed the impact of Campbell's work on Lucas' films.\n\nThe words attributed to Chief Seattle, read by Campbell in the fourth episode of the series, were actually written by Ted Perry for a 1972 ecology film called \"Home\". Perry adapted the text from newspaper accounts that were, in turn, published years after Chief Seattle delivered the actual speech.\n\nCampbell did respond to the yearning by religious fundamentalists for a return to the 'old-time religion'. The following part of the interview reveals Campbell's views on religious fundamentalism which, in the modern world, is conceptualised by the desire by some adherents of world's disparate religions, to return to the old practices of a given religion.\n\nBill Moyers: You've seen what happens when primitive societies are unsettled by white man's \ncivilization. They go to pieces, they disintegrate, they become \ndiseased. Hasn't the same thing been happening to us since myths began to disappear?\n\nJoseph Campbell: Absolutely, it has.\n\nBill Moyers: Isn't that why conservative religions today are calling for the old-time religion?\n\nJoseph Campbell: Yes, and they're making a terrible mistake. They are going back to something that is vestigial {something that has passed}, that doesn't serve life.\n\nBill Moyers: But didn't it serve us?\n\nJoseph Campbell: Sure it did.\n\nBill Moyers: I understand the yearning. In my youth I had fixed stars. They comforted me with their permanence. They gave me a known horizon. And they told me there \nwas loving, kind, and just father out there looking down on me, ready to receive me, thinking of my concerns all the time. Now, Saul Bellow says that science has made a housecleaning of beliefs. But there was value in these things for me. I am today what I am because of those beliefs. I wonder what happens to children who don't have those fixed stars, that known horizon - those myths?\n\nJoseph Campbell: Well, as I said, all you have to do is read the newspapers. It's a mess. On this immediate level of life and structure, myths offer life models. But the models have to be appropriate to the time in which you are living, and our time has changed so fast that what was proper fifty years ago is not proper today. \"The virtues of the past are the vices of today. And many of what were thought to be the vices of the past are the necessities of today. The moral order has to catch up with the moral necessities of actual life in time, here and now\". \"And that is what we are not doing. The old-time religion belongs to another age, another people, another set of human values, another universe. By going back you throw yourself out of sync with history. Our kids lose their faith in the religions that were taught to them, and they go inside.\"\n\nPrint\n\nAudio\n\nVideo\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30873652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30873652", "title": "The Puppet Play of Don Cristóbal", "text": "The Puppet Play of Don Cristóbal\n\nThe Puppet Play of Don Cristóbal (\"Retablillo de Don Cristóbal\") is a play for puppet theatre by the twentieth-century Spanish dramatist Federico García Lorca. It was written in 1931 and was first performed on 11 May 1935 at the Book Fair in Madrid, in a performance in which Lorca operated the puppets himself. Don Cristóbal is a kind of Punch character (which itself was based on Pulcinella), who also appears in García Lorca's earlier puppet play, \"The Billy-Club Puppets\" (written in 1931).\n\nKnown as \"A Farce of Puppets\" the one-act Spanish puppet play was written by Federico García Lorca. Don Cristóbal and the other puppets are Punch and Judy Style puppets. The play is a Tragic Comedy involving adultery, crude humor, and violent actions. It was the only Punch and Judy Style puppet piece Lorca would write. The play itself plays off the theme rich old man buys young beautiful wife and the consequences that ensue.\n\nLorca wrote the play in 1931 but it did not have its first production until 1935, which he directed, one year before his assassination.\nAround this time he became director for the touring company \"La Barraca\".\n\n\nThe play begins with a prologue within a prologue with a voice addressing the audience as \"Ladies and Gentlemen\". The voice preaches that the author has written the piece knowing the audience would accept the delight and vulgarity of the puppet show they are about to witness. The Poet enters, and the Voice continues his monologue, telling a child to shut up, telling the audience how quiet they must be during the performance and that he is going to go eat a piece of bread and then iron the company’s costumes. As he begins to tell how roses grow he lowers himself down and his other hand becomes the Director. He tells this puppeteer to put a sock in it and where he should have ended his dialogue. The Poet and the Director begin to quarrel about how the play should be written. The Poet believes Don Cristóbal is good, while the Director says that he is bad. During the fight, there are threats and breaking of the fourth wall, and each of them calls out to the other characters to get ready to being the play. Rosita says she’s putting on her shoes, while Cristóbal says he’ll be out once he has finished peeing. The Director tells him he is a doctor and has to get married. This is where the play truly begins when the Patient Enters. He tells Cristóbal of a pain in his neck and Cristóbal feels the only way to cure him is by ripping off his head. He seizes the Patient and tries to remove his head, and when he fails, he exits and reenters with a stick. He threatens the Patient demanding money and the Patient tells Cristóbal all the places he has money on his person, a questionable place up his behind being one of them, and Cristóbal begins to beat him multiple times with the stick. Cristóbal beats him to death and the Patient falls with a thud. The Director reenters and asks Cristóbal if he had any money, and with a positive answer tells Cristóbal he can now get married. The Mother enters, and with a side tells of her daughter and how she needs to find a man to marry. Cristóbal approaches her and tells her he is a gentlemen looking to get married. They negotiate and Mother trades her daughter off to Cristóbal for a Mule. When Mother tells Cristóbal where he can find Rosita, Rosita has a brief monologue depicting her adventures and desires with all of her lovers. During banter between Mother and Cristóbal, he informs her everyone he meets must tremble before him, and he demands she summon Rosita. Cristóbal and Rosita meet, Mother asks him to take care of her, and Cristóbal alls out for the priest with bells ringing out.\n\nThe Poet reenters and addresses the audience how the characters could and should play out but the Director keeps them on a narrow path. The Director reenters and the Poet quickly fibs about what he had just spoken aloud. The Director threatens him and Cristóbal and Rosita reenter. He begins to tell her what he plans to do to her in his drunken state, and Rosita has the idea for him to take a nap. When Cristóbal falls asleep a man enters and begins to kiss Rosita. Cristóbal wakes up to the sounds of kissing and the man quickly disappears. Rosita makes an excuse and tells him to go take another nap. This pattern continues with the Poet and the recently deceased Patient entering, kissing Rosita, Cristóbal waking up, and Rosita lying about what he had heard. The Mother enters and tells Rosita the doctor is here and Rosita says she has fallen and ill and the women demand Cristóbal to give them his money. They exit and the Director enters telling Cristóbal that Dona Rosita is not only ill, but she is giving birth. Cristóbal asks who is the father, and is informed she’s already had four children. He threatens her aloud and confronts Mother. He Strikes her when she says he is the father. The Director tells them both she is having the fifth and Cristóbal asks who the father is again, striking her every time she says it’s his. He eventually beats her to death, addressing the murder and boasting he will find out who the father is, but Mother arises and continues to say the baby is Cristóbal’s child. Cristóbal continues to beat her until the Director says enough and addressees the audience. The play ends with the Director telling the audience that we only accept the vulgarity and content of the show because its puppets who are delivering the dialogue instead of real actors and Don Cristóbal is a character the ancient spirit of theatre survives.\n\n"}

The first print of the story is found in the Ming Dynasty \"Ocean Stories of Past and Present\" () published in 1544.\n\nThe story is set during the late Spring and Autumn period. King Jian Zi (趙簡子 - BC?-BC 476) was leading a hunting party through Zhongshan when he happen to come across a wolf. King Jian takes aim with his bow and arrow but misses and hits a stone instead. The wolf desperately flees through the forest with the hunting party in pursuit. As the wolf makes its way through the forest he stumbles upon a traveling Mohist scholar Mr. Dongguo (). The wolf appeals to the scholar's belief of \"universal love\" and implores for his help. Mr. Dongguo takes pity on the creature and hides it in one of his books bags strapped to his donkey.\n\nWhen the hunters approach him, Mr. Dongguo denies any knowledge of the wolf's whereabouts. After the hunters had left, Mr. Dongguo lets the wolf out of his bag, got on his donkey, and was about to take his leave only to be stopped by the wolf. The wolf now asked the scholar to save his life again, this time from starvation. Mr. Dongguo offered the wolf some pastries, but the wolf smile and said \"I don't eat those, I dine solely on meat\". Puzzled, Mr. Dongguo inquires if the wolf intended to eat his donkey and the wolf replies \"No, no, donkey meat is no good\". The donkey, upon hearing this, bolts from the scene as fast as its four legs to carry it leaving Mr. Dongguo behind with the wolf. To Mr. Dongguo's surprise, the hungry wolf pounced on him and announced its intention to eat him. When Mr. Dongguo protests at the wolf's ingratitude, the wolf presents the argument: since the scholar saved his life once why not do it again? Now that it was starving, only by serving as the wolf's food will the scholar have fulfilled the act of saving his life. Besides, the wolf complained that it nearly suffocated while it was crammed in the scholar's bag and the scholar now owed him. Dongguo and the wolf debated and finally decided to present their case to the judgment of three elders.\n\nThe first elder they present their argument to is an old withering apricot tree. The tree relates its own experience to the two on how when it was young, children used to pick its fruits from its branches and the tree would tell them to eat their fill. Now it was about to be chopped down to provide firewood. The tree sides with the wolf. The wolf is very pleased.\n\nThe second elder they present their argument to was an elderly water buffalo. The buffalo tells its story of how it served its masters for many years dutifully providing him with milk and plowing his fields. Now his master wants to butcher it so he can eat his meat. The buffalo too sides with the wolf. The wolf grins and feels even more justified in his request to eat the scholar. Mr. Dongguo reminds the wolf that they have one more elder to seek out.\n\nThe last elder they present their argument to is an elderly farmer. The farmer was skeptical and didn't believe that the wolf could fit into the bag. To illustrate its point, the wolf crawled back into the bag and right away the old farmer tied up the bag and started to beat the wolf with his hoe. The farmer bashes the wolf to an inch of his life then unties the bag and drags his dying wolf out of the bag.\n\nSeeing the pitiful wolf the scholar thinks that the old farmer was too cruel but just then a weeping woman comes running towards them. She pointed to the wolf and told Mr. Dongguo and the farmer how it dragged off her little boy. Mr Dongguo now no longer pitied the wolf. He picked up the hoe and strikes the final blow to the wolf's head.\n\nThe authorship of this text is a matter of dispute. The text originally appeared in the \"Hǎishuō Gǔjīn\" as an anonymous text with no author listed but it has generally been attributed to Ma Zhongxi () (1446–1512). In classical Chinese literature, this tale is quite unusual in the fact that it is a fully developed animal fable. In most prose fables or poems where animals are imbued with human characteristics (e.g., \"Huli jing\"), they are usually first transformed into human form before they are allowed to speak.\n\nThe term Mr. Dongguo (Dōngguō Xiānshēng) has now become a Chinese idiom for a naive person who gets into trouble through being softhearted to evil people.\n\nAnother variation of this tale can be found in the \"Precious Scroll of Shancai and Longnü\".\n\nLeo Tolstoy in one of his \"readers\" for elementary school has a similar story, entitled \"The Wolf and the Farmer\" ().\n\n\n"}

The game was originally announced for release in downloadable installments on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live Arcade, with the first one released in March 2009 to coincide with the film's theatrical release. The second episode was released in July and August 2009.\n\nBoth episodes were released together on disc on July 21, 2009 for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. A limited edition of the PlayStation 3 version was released billed as \"The Complete Experience\", which also included the extended Director's Cut version of the film in Blu-ray format.\n\nThe game allows players to take on the roles of either Rorschach or Nite Owl in single player or cooperative multiplayer. Rorschach and Nite Owl are the only playable characters in the game's first episode, which comprises six \"chapters.\" Cutscenes that look like animated comic panels, similar to those seen in the \"Watchmen\" motion comics released on iTunes, bookend each chapter. Two of the film's actors, Patrick Wilson and Jackie Earle Haley, provide their voices for their characters Nite Owl and Rorschach, respectively. The game features a mix of beat-em-up and puzzle gameplay, with the two characters having different strengths and abilities. Rorschach is faster with unconventional attacks and makes use of improvised weapons like crowbars and baseball bats; Nite Owl is slower but has a solid martial arts method and uses technological devices, such as \"screecher bombs\", and the grappling gun. The characters must work cooperatively to pass puzzles and defeat enemies.\n\nThe game is set in 1972 during the Crimebusters (for the film adaptation, The Watchmen) era. The first chapter of the game is a tutorial taking place while Rorschach and Nite Owl infiltrate a prison. Underboss, a villain mentioned in the comic book, appears in the game, as do other adversaries who are only mentioned or briefly shown in flashbacks in the original comic. Nite Owl's flying craft, \"Archimedes\", appears, though the player never has control over it during the game.\n\nAn article on Comicmix.com emphasized the game's focus on teamwork between the two characters: in single-player mode, the AI controls the other character aside from the main character, while the game can be played in Local Co-op with two players as both characters. The article also mentioned there would be no online Co-op mode.\n\n\"The End Is Nigh\" takes place during the Crimebusters era (renamed \"Watchmen\" for the film adaptation), when Rorschach and Nite Owl II were crime-fighting vigilantes before the Keene Act passed in 1977. Upon hearing a police bulletin, Nite Owl and Rorschach make their way to Sing Sing prison to help quell the rioting that has erupted there.\n\nOnce there, they find out the riots were a ruse to cover up the escape of The Underboss, a crime lord. They make their way to a bar, the Rumrunner, and question one of the patrons to find out who orchestrated the escape. They find out Jimmy the Gimmick was behind it, so they chase him down the docks to an abandoned amusement park. They corner him on the tracks of a roller coaster, where someone activates the carts to try to kill Jimmy. Nite Owl holds them back with his grappling hook but a mysterious sniper shoots the cable, causing the carts to fly right into Jimmy, causing him to be severely injured. Before his fall off the roller coaster, Jimmy managed to tell them the Underboss is in his old hideout in the sewers, so after calling an ambulance for Jimmy, that is where Nite Owl and Rorschach go.\n\nThey don't find him, but they do find a missing FBI associate director, Mark Felt, tied up and bleeding heavily, seemingly tortured. He tells them that someone (who the heroes presume to be Underboss) means to kill two reporters, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the would-be informers of the Watergate scandal. Upon leaving the sewers, Nite Owl and Rorschach are ambushed by the police, Rorschach chiming in that they have been set up.\n\nThey fight their way through them to get to the construction site where Felt told them Underboss is, only to find that the reporters are already dead. Underboss claims he had nothing to do with it, that he was set up. The duo chases him up the construction site and manages to corner him, but the Comedian snipes him from afar. It turned out the Comedian was the mastermind behind all the events, working on behalf of the American government to cover up the Watergate Scandal (a reference to a comment made about Woodward and Bernstein by the Comedian in both the graphic novel and film).\n\nIn Part 2, Rorschach sets on the trail of a missing girl named Violet Greene. With a reluctant Nite Owl in tow, they infiltrate a seedy strip club, where they discover that the kidnapper is the Twilight Lady, an old flame of Nite Owl's. They break into her mansion (which acts as a high class brothel) and discover that Violet enjoys being a prostitute, however Rorschach claims that she may have been brainwashed. Nite Owl says that if Violet is there of her \"own free will\" then there is nothing that they can do. Rorschach disagrees, and the pair chase Twilight Lady through the mansion, before she is thrown into a skylight. The ending of the chapter depends upon the outcome of the final battle (between Nite Owl and Rorschach). If Nite Owl wins, then he throws Rorschach through the skylight and rescues Twilight Lady before ordering her to leave town and never return. If Rorschach wins, however, he throws Nite Owl to one side and shoots Twilight Lady with the harpoon gun, killing her. Whichever character is the victor, the game ends with the partnership between Nite Owl and Rorschach being severed, and Nite Owl teaming up with the Comedian to quell a riot (an event which is depicted both in the graphic novel, and the film).\n\nWarner Bros. Interactive Entertainment was announced to be publishing two downloadable games during the theatrical and DVD releases of the 2009 film. Deadline Games is developing the two properties. WB took this low-key approach to adapting the film to avoid rushing the game on this tight schedule, as most film games are panned by critics and gamers. The game is written by Len Wein, the comic's editor. Dave Gibbons, the comic's artist, is also an advisor.\n\n\"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" announced the title of the game to be \"Watchmen: The End Is Nigh\" and had the game as its cover story for December 2008.\n\nA teaser trailer premiered on Spike's Video Game Awards show on December 14, 2008.\n\nThe PC and PlayStation 3 demos were released on 3 March 2009, available on Steam and the PlayStation Network respectively.\n\nThe Xbox 360 version of \"Watchmen: The End Is Nigh - Part II\" was released through Xbox Live Arcade on Wednesday, August 26, 2009.\n\n\"Part 1\" received \"mixed\" reviews on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. \"1UP.com\"s review stated that \"Part 1\" was a \"decent HD-generation beat-em-up\" but cautioned that \"as gorgeous as everything is, it's also repetitive.\" \"Official Xbox Magazine\" said that co-op was fun, but that they were disappointed no online co-op was given. \"Hyper\"'s Daniel Wilks commended \"Part 1\" for its \"rain effects [and] shadow and character models\" as well as its \"decent fighting engine\". However, he criticized it for \"repetitive action and level design [and being] not particularly difficult\".

{"id": "1699472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1699472", "title": "Whip It (Devo song)", "text": "Whip It (Devo song)\n\n\"Whip It\" is a song by American rock band Devo from their third album \"Freedom of Choice\" (1980). It is a new wave and synth-pop song that features a synthesizer, electric guitar, bass guitar, and drums in its instrumentation. The apparently nonsensical lyrics have a common theme revolving around the ability to deal with one's problems by \"whipping it\". Co-written by bassist Gerald Casale and singer Mark Mothersbaugh, Devo recorded \"Whip It\" with producer Robert Margouleff at the Record Plant in Los Angeles.\n\nAlthough \"Whip It\" was released as the second single from \"Freedom of Choice\", Warner Bros. Records did not expect it to be a hit, due to its nonstandard tempo and strange lyrics. The disc jockey Kal Rudman took an interest in the song and it was soon being played on several radio stations in the Southeastern United States. Peaking at number fourteen on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, \"Whip It\" became a hit single and found chart success in several countries. Mothersbaugh believes the song sold well because some people assumed the lyrics are about masturbation or sadomasochism.\n\nAn accompanying music video depicts these sexual themes; it features Mothersbaugh whipping clothing from a woman on a dude ranch. Despite some claims of misogynistic undertones, the video became popular on the fledgling television channel MTV. In recent years, several journalists have described \"Whip It\" as a cornerstone of the development of new wave music in the early 1980s and a unique song that transcended mainstream music. In the band's forty-year history, \"Whip It\" remains the only song by Devo to peak within the top forty of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. As a result, Devo is often labeled by journalists as a one-hit wonder.\n\nDevo's 1979 album \"Duty Now for the Future\" was considered a disappointment by critics and band members; critics regarded it as a formulaic repeat of the band's 1978 debut \"Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!\" and the band members primarily blamed the formulaic sound on the album's producer Ken Scott. Warner Bros. Records was also unhappy with \"Duty Now for the Future\" and issued to Devo an ultimatum that they needed to produce a successful follow-up album or be dropped from the label. The band members believed a hit single would bolster the next album's popularity and finally give them radio exposure. In late 1979, audio engineer Robert Margouleff was brought on to produce \"Whip It\" and its parent album \"Freedom of Choice\".\n\n\"Whip It\" was written by bassist Gerald Casale and singer/keyboardist Mark Mothersbaugh between August and October 1979. Howard Siegal engineered the song while Margouleff served as the producer. It was recorded at the Record Plant in Los Angeles and mastered by Ken Perry at Capitol Studios. The song was recorded using API mixing consoles, 3M tape machines, and Minimoog and Prophet-5 synthesizers. Throughout the song, there are whipcracking noises that were recorded using an Electrocomp 500 synthesizer and Neumann KM 84 and U 87 microphones.\n\nThe music for \"Whip It\" was crafted by taking elements from four different demo tapes that Casale had collected. Mothersbaugh composed what became the song's break in his bedroom; the break was originally much slower and had a classical sound. On another tape, Mothersbaugh played what became the main riff with a drum machine. One of Captain Beefheart's drummers created a beat that Mothersbaugh recorded; the last demo was a live recording between Casale and Mothersbaugh. Casale took the four demos and layered them to create a smooth, consistent time signature. Mothersbaugh created the main riff in \"Whip It\" by taking the riff used in Roy Orbison's song \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" and changing the ending slightly.\n\n\"Whip It\" is a new wave and synth-pop song, that is built around a consistent 4/4 beat known as a motorik beat. It moves at a tempo of 120 beats per minute and is constructed in verse–chorus form. With a chord progression of D-A-E7sus4 in the verses and C-G-D in the choruses, the song is written in the key of E major. \"Whip It\" main riff alternates between a five-note ascension and a three-note descension, and is played with a synthesizer, electric guitar, and bass guitar. The chorus features two synthesizer notes that are a half step apart, which creates what AllMusic's Steve Huey describes as \"a disorienting aural effect\".\n\nAs the song progresses, a guitar lick in the main riff becomes more prominent. During the instrumental break, the riff temporarily recofigures to a nonstandard 6/4 beat before returning to the original 4/4 beat. Casale and Mothersbaugh sing the vocals of \"Whip It\" with a vocal range of A4-F#5. The singers take alternate turns on vocals; Casale uses a nasal drawl while Mothersbaugh sings in a more powerful \"cartoonish\" voice. The use of two vocalists is a call and response that Casale said is \"kind of like white boys rapping\".\n\nThe lyrics of \"Whip It\" are disjointed and nonsensical. For example, its central theme revolves around the ability to solve one's problems by \"whipping it\"; other lines include motivational statements like \"go forward, move ahead\" and \"it's not too late\". Casale wrote the lyrics, which were intended to satirize American optimism. He took inspiration from communist propaganda posters and \"Gravity's Rainbow\" by Thomas Pynchon, a 1973 novel that contains satirical limericks about capitalist can-do clichés. Casale incorporated lyrics that would sound like motivational clichés if taken out of context.\n\nMothersbaugh offered a different interpretation of the lyrics, saying they were written in the form of a subtle pep talk for United States President Jimmy Carter during the 1980 presidential election. The members of Devo supported Carter and feared the Republican candidate Ronald Reagan would win the election. Mothersbaugh jokingly once said in an interview: \"Come on Jimmy, get your shit together\". Huey notes that despite the song's novelty, there are violent undertones in the lyrics. He describes the process of whipping it to solve one's problems as \"a sardonic portrait of a general, problematic aspect of the American psyche: the predilection for using force and violence to solve problems, vent frustration, and prove oneself to others\".\n\n\"Whip It\" is one of four songs from \"Freedom of Choice\" to be released as a single. Warner Bros. heavily favored the commercial viability of the first single \"Girl U Want\" because its music and lyrics were more radio-friendly and akin to \"My Sharona\" by the Knack. \"Girl U Want\" failed to reach any record chart and was considered a failure. Despite this initial failure, Devo decided to tour in support of the album without a hit single. Shortly into the tour, disc jockey Kal Rudman began playing \"Whip It\", and the song was soon being played on several radio stations in the Southeastern U.S. Within a week, \"Whip It\" had become so popular that Devo was forced to temporarily stop its tour to book larger venues because the concerts were selling out too quickly.\n\n\"Whip It\" debuted at number eighty-five on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on August 30, 1980. It spent twenty-five weeks on the chart, peaked at number fourteen on November 15, 1980, and finished the year at number ninety-four on the \"Billboard\" Year-End singles chart for 1981. In the U.S., the song also reached number thirteen on the \"Cash Box\" Top 100, number fourteen on the Hot Dance Club Play chart, and number seventeen on the \"Record World\" Singles chart. \"Whip It\" found international success, peaking at number seventy-seven on the Australian Kent Music Report, number eleven on the Canadian \"RPM\" Top Singles chart, number eleven on the Official New Zealand Music Chart, and number fifty-one on the UK Singles Chart. The song was certified gold in the U.S. and Canada, denoting shipments of 1,000,000 and 75,000 copies respectively.\n\nIn a retrospective review, Huey said the song has \"an irresistibly odd novelty appeal\" and that it was \"one of the best arguments that punk ideology didn't necessarily lose its bite when placed in the more pop-oriented musical context of new wave\". \"PopMatters\" Chris Gerard noted the song's originality and described it as \"a bold and provocative recording that still sounds fantastic blasted out of a good set of speakers\". The website subsequently ranked \"Whip It\" as the fifty-first best alternative song of the 1980s.\n\nWhen \"Whip It\" was released, some listeners assumed the lyrics were double entendres for masturbation or sadomasochism. Devo's previous material often included sexual innuendos or blatant references to sex in the lyrics, which made \"Whip It\" appear consistent with this style of songwriting. Mothersbaugh said many disc jockeys would make masturbation jokes to him before interviews. At first, the band members attempted to dissuade them of this assumption but they eventually gave in and helped reinforce these misinterpretations. Mothersbaugh believed a song about taboo subjects would receive more radio airplay and sell more copies.\n\nAlthough \"Whip It\" was not about masturbation or sadomasochism as some listeners believed, Devo used these sexual themes for an accompanying music video. The video is set on a dude ranch where cowboys and cowgirls are watching Mothersbaugh whip the clothing from a cigarette-smoking woman. A cross-eyed woman and a middle-aged woman making whipped cream watch from a ranch house while the other members of Devo perform the song in a cattle pen. The band members are wearing sleeveless black turtlenecks and red flowerpot-shaped hats called energy domes.\n\nDevo was heavily committed to adding film aspects to its act; the band asked Warner Bros. to provide non-recoupable promotional money to make videos for \"Girl U Want\" and \"Freedom of Choice\". This was before the making of music videos had become standard industry practice, which confused label executives. When \"Whip It\" started to receive radio airplay, the record company embraced the concept and asked the band to produce a video for \"Whip It\" with a $15,000 budget. The idea for the video came from an article in a 1962 issue of \"The Dude\" magazine, which revolved around a former stuntman who marries a stripper and moves to a dude ranch in Arizona. For entertainment, the man would use a whip to remove the clothes from his wife, who would remain unhurt. Mothersbaugh stated; \"That's the kind of stuff that fed us creatively. It was just so stupid and so low, and yet so great.\"\n\nThe video was partially a reaction to Reagan's previous career as a Hollywood actor; Devo wanted to make a video that satirized both the cowboy mythos and \"right-wing racist values\". In the video, the whip does not strike the woman's clothes; they were tied to a fishing line and pulled away after each whip crack. The whip did, however, strike the cigarette holder to knock it out of her mouth. For the first few months after its release, the video was seen by a limited audience, primarily on late-night talk shows. The American television channel MTV, which was launched in 1981, gave the video so much exposure that it temporarily revived the song's popularity, shortly before the release of Devo's next album \"New Traditionalists\" (1981).\n\nThe video attracted some controversy, particularly for its perceived misogynistic undertones. Casale said the band members intended the video to appear tasteless and demeaning but also funny. The claims of misogyny increased when Devo was cut from a live performance on an episode of \"The Midnight Special\" hosted by Lily Tomlin. After watching the video, Tomlin refused to host the show unless Devo was cut. There were also claims that MTV banned the video but these claims were ultimately proven false.\n\nSeveral journalists view \"Whip It\" as a cornerstone of the development of new wave music in the early 1980s. In his book \"Pop Goes the Decade: The Eighties\", Thomas Harrison wrote that the song introduced heavily synthesized music to a mainstream audience while music critic Evie Nagy called it a \"defining anthem of new wave's rise\". The majority of new wave music in the early 1980s was produced by British bands. Following the success of \"Whip It\", Devo joined the B-52's as the face of the emergent American new wave music movement.\n\nThe song's popularity can be largely attributed to its distinct originality. Gerard noted, \"there's been nothing quite like 'Whip It' in the top 40, before or since\". Nagy said the song's drum beat, guitar chords, and keyboard lines are distinct and easily recognizable, even when isolated from the song. In his book \"99 Red Balloons: And 100 All-time One-hit Wonders\", Brent Mann wrote; \"It's hard to find anyone between the ages of 30 and 50 who does not have a vivid recollection of 'Whip It'... the kind of unusual track that made listeners want to bop their heads and break into a herky-jerky dance\".\n\nThe accompanying music video is also remembered for its bizarre and controversial content. According to Huey, \"the song has remained in the public consciousness thanks in part to MTV's extensive airplay for the video\". With the popularity of the video, MTV began pursuing Devo and promised them a new platform to showcase their visual works. Devo, however, eventually developed a troubled relationship with the channel. Most of the band's subsequent videos were censored for controversial content or were rejected because the song was not a hit single. According to Casale; \"As soon as MTV went national, they came up with this new Taliban set of rules... we were stunned and felt jilted\".\n\nIn the band's forty-year history, \"Whip It\" remains their only song to chart within the top forty on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. As a result, some journalists have labeled Devo as a one-hit wonder. Mann noted that the band's strange philosophy on devolution offset its accessibility, and wrote; \"Devo's songs were, quite simply, too far out and counter-culture for mainstream radio\". Devo's members have never tried to distance themselves from \"Whip It\" and still play it live. Casale said; \"I'm glad it was 'Whip It', because it was certainly twisted and original... it came from a pure, creative, open collaboration, and that's to me when all the best stuff comes\".\n\nSince 1980, \"Whip It\" has been covered by several bands, including Pearl Jam, Love and Death, and Does It Offend You, Yeah?. One of the most unusual covers was recorded by the American teen pop band Devo 2.0 and featured on its album \"DEV2.0\" (2006). Devo 2.0, which was created by Walt Disney Records in an attempt to emulate the popularity of the Swedish pop group the A-Teens, covered Devo songs for a teenage audience. Label executives asked Casale to serve as the band's manager; he agreed, reasoning that Devo 2.0 furthered Devo's belief that everything humanity creates— including Devo's own songs—will devolve Casale had to rewrite several lyrics to remove sexual innuendos and references to drugs and suicide, although \"Whip It\" was not subject to revisions.\n\nAccording to David Chiu of \"PopMatters\", \"Whip It\" had transcended popular culture because it has been featured in several television episodes of \"The Simpsons\", \"Family Guy\", and \"Stranger Things\". It has also been featured in television advertisements for brands including Bonds, Gateway, and Swiffer. In the Swiffer commercial, a middle-aged woman performs robotic dance moves while cleaning her house. The commercial uses a slightly altered version of the song, replacing the lyrics \"whip it good\" with \"swiffer's good\". Devo agreed to perform the song for the commercial because they found it to be absurd. Mothersbaugh stated that performing in the commercial \"is coming full circle, to be commenting on a conspicuous, consumptive culture... and to be fed into the hopper and spit back out the other side\". Several other companies have altered the phrase \"whip it\" for their commercials to lyrics such as \"flip it\", \"chip it\", and \"dip it\".\n\nCredits adapted from \"Freedom of Choice\" album liner notes.\n\n \n\n"}
{"id": "37609851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37609851", "title": "William Dennes Mahan", "text": "William Dennes Mahan\n\nWilliam Dennes Mahan (July 27, 1824 - October 19, 1906) was an American Cumberland Presbyterian minister in Boonville, Missouri and author of a book, commonly known as \"The Archko Volume\" (1884), purported to be a translation of a Jewish, Roman, and other contemporary documents about the trial and death of Jesus of Nazareth. The volume was initially received by some as true, but soon after its publication its authenticity was questioned. The book has been definitively discredited as a forgery and fraud.\n\nWilliam Dennes Mahan was born July 27, 1824 in Pittsylvania County, Virginia to William P. and Permelia Mahan. In 1837 his family moved to Missouri, and by 1845, he was living in Saline County, Missouri where he was serving as a minister in the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. Mahan married Martha R. Johnston in 1850, and together they had two daughters. Mahan was living and preaching in Boonville in 1872. Mahan died October 19, 1906 in Boonville and is buried there in Walnut Grove Cemetery.\n\nIn 1879 Mahan published a pamphlet of thirty-two pages entitled \"A Correct Transcript of Pilate's Court\". It purported to be an official report of the trial and death of Jesus made directly to the Roman Emperor Tiberius by Pilate as governor of Judaea. Mahan claimed the text was supplied to him in 1856 by a German scholar, Henry C. Whydaman, from Father Peter Freelinhusen, \"the chief guardian of the Vatican,\" who sent the Latin text to Whydaman’s brother-in-law, C. C. Vantberger of New York, for English translation. Whydaman, Freelinhusen, and Vantberger are otherwise unknown, and the documentation of the exchange contains inconsistencies and errors, including Freelinhusen’s request for a fee payable in \"darics\" (ancient Persian coins).\n\nThis work was copied almost verbatim from \"Ponce Pilate à Vienne\", a short story by Joseph Méry published in \"Revue de Paris\" in 1837. Méry said he had been inspired by an old Latin manuscript, and an 1842 English translation of the story made the claim that it was in fact taken from an old Latin manuscript. Mahan’s contribution was evidently to create correspondence showing him to be the discoverer of the manuscript.\n\nIn 1884 Mahan published the first version of the Archko Volume, entitled \"The Archaeological Writings of the Sanhedrin and Talmuds of the Jews, Taken from the Ancient Parchments and Scrolls at Constantinople and the Vatican at Rome, Being the Record Made by the Enemies of Jesus of Nazareth in His Day: The Most Interesting History Ever Read by Man\". This included an expanded version of \"Pilate's Court\" plus a series of other texts that he claimed to have obtained himself in a visit to Rome and Constantinople and translated with the aid of Dr. M. McIntosh of Scotland and Dr. Twyman of England, also otherwise unheard of. These texts include interviews with the shepherds, Gamaliel's interview with Joseph and Mary, Caiaphas's reports to the Sanhedrin, Eli's story of the Magi, Herod Antipater's defense before the Senate for the Massacre of the Innocents, and Herod Antipas's defense before the Senate—all with the claim that they were copied from ancient manuscripts and translated into English.\n\nThe texts are otherwise unknown to scholarship, and the volume contains various inconsistencies. It quotes an unknown Greek philosopher, \"Meeleesen\", and includes references to Josephus that do not exist. It mistakenly asserts that Philo spoke often of Jesus and that \"the scribes of those days were most all Rabbis.\" There are inaccurate descriptions of the library of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, the making of papyrus, and an inaccurate chronology for both Philo and Tacitus. Contemporaries raised the question of whether Mahan could have possibly made the trip to Rome and Constantinople in less than two months. Most tellingly, large portions of \"Eli and the Story of the Magi\" were copied verbatim from the 1880 novel \"\". At one point, a strange word reveals that a single line of the printed text of \"Ben-Hur\" was accidentally omitted during copying.\n\nAmong the first to call Mahan's work into question was Rev. Dr. James A. Quarles, of Lexington, Missouri. He was soon followed by William E. Curtis, a correspondent for the \"Chicago Record-Herald\". In Rome, Curtis investigated Mahan's claims and declared the manuscript spurious and the alleged translation a forgery.\n\nMahan denied all the charges against him and asserted the truth of what he had written. He was summoned before church authorities in September 1885 on charges of falsehood and plagiarism, and a church trial was held. The New Lebanon Presbytery, of which he was a member, tried the case at length.\n\nEvidence was introduced to show that Mahan had never been to Rome, but that he had spent the time he was absent from Boonville on a farm in Illinois. The editor of the \"Boonville Advertiser\" showed that the letters that paper had printed were postmarked from a small town in Illinois. Mahan rebutted the evidence by saying that they had been sent there to be re-mailed. Additional evidence that Mahan had not traveled to Rome included a letter from Father Ehrie, prefect of the Vatican Library. Ehrie stated that Mahan was entirely unknown there and that no person connected with the library had ever seen or head of the \"Acta Pilati\" or any such manuscript.\n\nLew Wallace, author of \"Ben-Hur\" and American Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Ottoman Empire, testified that no record of Mahan’s visit to Turkey or to the library of the Hagia Sophia existed, and that the primary sources he cited were unknown.\n\nThe verdict of the presbytery was nearly unanimous. He was convicted and suspended from the ministry for one year. Following his suspension, Mahan made no effort to return to the pastorate, living the remainder of his life at the home of his son-in-law, a hotel keeper in Boonville. He declined to make any further statements regarding the part he had taken in the preparation of the book except to say when he was told that the literary world pronounced it a forgery: \"Well, I have been a much deceived and a much persecuted man.\"\nAfter the trial, Mahan also promised to withdraw the book from publication. But the book was reprinted many times beginning in 1887 by various publishers, likely with Mahan's knowledge and profit from the sales. The title \"Archko Volume\" appeared during this time, as did the note \"Second edition\". This second edition omits \"Eli and the Story of the Magi\" and also creates a preface using material from the introductions to the texts. No new original material is included, which suggests that this version was produced by a publisher's clerk. The omission of the Eli text suggests that the court verdict was known to the reviser.\n\nA year after his suspension, the New Lebanon Presbytery submitted a resolution indefinitely dismissing Mahan from the ministry:\n\n\"Your committee to whom was referred the motion to grant W. D. Mahan a letter of dismission [sic] and recommendation after the term of his suspension expires, have had the subject under consideration, and in view of all the surrounding facts, and in view of the interests of the Church, we recommend the following:\n\nWhereas, This Pres., at its session in Slater, Sept. 29th, 1885, did suspend from the functions of the ministry, for one year, W. D. Mahan; said one year terminating on the 29th of the present month; and\n\nWhereas, The definite form of said suspension was more the result of sympathy for him and his family, than a desire for rigid administration of the law, and this sympathy being exercised under the hope that said W. D. Mahan would use all proper efforts to heal the wounds his course had inflicted; and,\n\nWhereas, It now comes to the knowledge of this Pres., that he still occupies the same position, by the sale of his publications, and by negotiations to bring out new editions, therefore;\n\nResolved, That the suspension of the said W. D. Mahan, be, and the same is hereby declared indefinite, or, until he shall have complied with the law of the Church, as it applies in the case.\"\n\nThe circumstances of composition, the letters to the \"Boonville Advertiser\", and the proceedings of the church court were all investigated by Edgar J. Goodspeed and published in his books \"Strange New Gospels\" (1931) and \"Modern Apocrypha\" (1956). More recently Per Beskow (1983) identified Mahan's original sources and reported on subsequent editions of the \"Archko Volume.\"\n\n\n"}
