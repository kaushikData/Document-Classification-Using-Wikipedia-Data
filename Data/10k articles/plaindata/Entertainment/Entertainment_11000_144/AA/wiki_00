The document's supposed authors, the \"Israelite International League\", gloat over their success at reducing the Russian people to \"helpless slaves\", and urge their fellow Jews to \"excite hatred\" and \"buy up Government loans and gold\", in order to grow in \"political and economic power and influence\". The text has been cited, as with other antisemitic canards, as evidence for the antisemitic belief that the Jews are conspiring to take over the world.\n\n\"A Protocol of 1919\" was first published in the Estonian newspaper \"Postimees\" (morning edition) on 31 December 1919. \"Postimees\" detailed how the originally Hebrew text was found from the pocket of Shunderev, a Jewish Bolshevik battalion commander in the 11th Rifle Regiment who had been killed in action on the night before December 9. At the time, \"Postimees\" was owned by Jaan Tõnisson, an Estonian nationalist politician.\n\nThe text appeared next on 5 February 1920 in \"Prizyv\", a Russian newspaper in Berlin. \"Prizvy\" described it as \"an interesting document\". Later it was reproduced in the appendix of a greatly expanded English-language edition of \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\", published in 1934 by the Patriotic Publishing Co., operating from a post office box in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nWalter Laqueur, an American historian, states that \"the German right-wing extremist press was supplied for years with information first published in \"Prizyv\" during its nine months of existence\", and points to \"A Protocol of 1919\" as a \"typical\" example.\n\nThe document consists of eleven short paragraphs of vague antisemitic generalizations, with eight admonitions to be \"careful\" or \"cautious\", and is signed by \"The Central Committee of the Petersburg Branch of the Israelite International League\".\n"}

This is the fifth and final installment in the \"Aces Go Places\" film series. It was released in the United States as Mad Mission 5: The Terracotta Hit.\n\nKing Kong and Baldy, the \"Aces,\" part ways in 1986 after a mission in Thailand to kidnap a woman on her way to marry her boyfriend (a rich man claiming to be her husband enlisted the Aces' services) goes sour. Three years later, figures from the famous Terracotta Army and a Qing Dynasty bronze sword called the \"Chinese Excalibur\" is stolen during their transport to an exhibition in Hong Kong. Based on pictures that appear in the media, the two men are accused of the heist. By this time, King Kong is running an investment company that has long since been in the red, and Baldy - who sent his wife and son to Canada - is hiding in a Sai Kung houseboat from creditors who lent him money to invest in the stock market.\n\nWhen a muscular MSS operative called the Chinese Rambo separately visits Baldy and King Kong (with indirect approval from the Hong Kong Police Force command, who have long since disowned them), both men decide to find those who framed them to clear their names. \n\nThey discover that a brother-sister tandem calling themselves the \"New Aces\" took the pictures during the heist and wore face masks of the two men's likenesses while getting away with stealing the Chinese Excalibur. They interrogate them inside Baldy's houseboat, and as the siblings try to escape, they plunge into the water and go back to the house during which a Chinese ship tows the houseboat. All four of them are sent to Beijing and imprisoned to answer for the crime. They are forced to undergo a staged execution until the Chinese Rambo offers them a chance to get out of prison in exchange for helping the Chinese government recover the figures. The four Aces agree to help recover the figures from the White Gloves syndicate. They begin training in martial arts because Beijing specifically orders that the figures must not be damaged by any means. However, the Chinese Rambo calls off the training, explaining that the Chinese government will try to get the figures back through diplomatic means.\n\nDespite the turn of events, the four Aces band together and proceed with the mission. A furious battle inside the White Gloves' hideout, which even involves the use of the Chinese Excalibur, results in the quartet recovering the figures. King Kong, Baldy, and the New Aces join the Hong Kong police in sending off the Chinese Rambo, who is safeguarding the shipment back to China.\n\n\nThis film grossed HK$20,032,206 during its theatrical run from 28 January to 22 February 1989 in Hong Kong.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1096840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1096840", "title": "Companion parrot", "text": "Companion parrot\n\nA companion parrot is a parrot kept as a pet that interacts abundantly with their human counterpart. Generally, most species of parrot can make excellent companions.\n\nSpecies of parrots that are kept as companions include large parrots, such as amazons, greys, cockatoos, eclectus, hawk-headed parrots, and macaws; mid-sized birds, such as caiques, conures, quakers, \"Pionus\", \"Poicephalus\", rose-ringed parakeets, and rosellas; and many of the smaller types, including \"Brotogeris\", budgies, cockatiels, parakeets, lovebirds, parrotlets and lineolated parakeets.\n\nSome species of lories and lorikeets are kept as pets but are quite messy, and often more popular as aviary birds. Hanging parrots and fig parrots are normally kept as aviary birds and not as pets. Some species as pygmy parrots and kakapos, night parrots, and about half of the species of parrotlet, are not considered companion parrots due to difficult dietary requirements or unavailability.\n\nThe \"Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora\" (also known as CITES) has made the trapping and trade of all wild parrots illegal, because taking parrots from the wild has endangered or reduced some of the rarer or more valuable species. However, many parrot species are still common; some abundant parrot species may still be legally killed as crop pests in their native countries.\nEndangered parrot species are better suited to conservation breeding programs than as companions.\n\nWith the right home parrots have the potential to make excellent, highly interactive, affectionate, and entertaining pets prized by their owners, but should not be considered easy care or low-maintenance pets. Tame companion parrots require daily attention and interaction with their owners, and need to be housed in a cage at least large enough to allow the bird to spread its wings and move about comfortably. Companion parrots also need to be fed a diet that includes fresh vegetables and fruits, and a smaller amount of seeds and grains; dietary requirements vary with species and activity level. Other elements essential to a companion parrot's well-being include appropriate toys to chew up and play with; veterinary care; and social time out of the cage whenever possible — preferably on playgyms or other out-of-cage perches. The larger parrots can be expensive to care for, messy, destructive, and loud, and some individuals may exhibit some aggressive behaviors during adolescence. Like dogs, parrots require some amount of basic training and proper early socialization to mature into good companions. Their intelligence means parrots learn new behaviors — both good and bad — easily. Many birds end up having to be re-homed because their owners did not realize the level of care required when they purchased the bird, did not understand how loud they can be, or did not understand how to properly socialize and train their bird. This is especially true for macaws and other species with dramatic, beautiful colouring, as well as cockatoos due to their intensely affectionate demeanor. These traits unfortunately make them tempting impulse purchases, leading to hundreds of macaws and cockatoos being put up for adoption.\n\nIn more recent years, pellets or formulated diets have become very popular, especially in the US. They offer an advantage over a seed-based diet in that a parrot cannot pick out and eat only its favorite (usually fatty) seeds. The majority of avian veterinarians will recommend a pelleted or formulated diet, and will extensively discuss with owners what their bird should and should not eat However, although these offer an easy alternative to other foods, they are not the best for many species. Many pellets contain artificial food dyes and preservatives that may be harmful; however there are \"no-color-added\" options available on the market. Most pellets contain soy, which is not a part of a parrot's natural diet; however, the diet of wild parrots cannot be replicated in captivity. Avian veterinarians and nutritionists agree the pelleted and formulated diets are the best base diet for pet birds. Although pellets may be advertised as a \"complete diet,\" there are dozens of species of parrots commonly kept as pets, all with varying nutritional needs. There are still many birds which develop problems such as vitamin toxicity, fatty liver disease or gout, despite being on a pelleted diet. A common mistake made by owners feeding pellets is over-supplementing them with fresh food. As a pellet is, essentially, a supplemented grain, supplementing them even more \"dilutes\" the diet, making the pellets less efficient and the diet unbalanced. The best diet for a bird should be determined by an avian veterinarian.\n\nParrots can be very rewarding pets to the right owners, due to their intelligence and desire to interact with people. Many parrots are very affectionate, even cuddly with trusted people, and require a lot of attention from their owners constantly. Some species have a tendency to bond to one or two people, and dislike strangers, unless they are regularly and consistently handled by different people. Properly socialized parrots can be friendly, outgoing and confident companions.\nMost pet parrots take readily to trick training. Trick training can also help to redirect a bird's energy and prevent or correct many behavior problems. Some owners successfully use well behaved parrots as therapy animals. Some owners have trained their parrots to wear parrot harnesses (most easily accomplished with young birds) so that they can be taken to enjoy themselves outdoors in a relatively safe manner without the risk of flying away. Parrots are prey animals and even the tamest pet may fly off if spooked.\n\nAlthough parrots can be messy pets—often throwing food and damaging furniture with their beaks if they can—most parrots may be potty trained to some extent and are generally odorless; however, certain species of \"Amazona\" and \"Pionus\" have a distinctive odor most owners find pleasant. Most parrot species, with some notable exceptions, are relatively good pets for most pet allergy sufferers. However, all the species of white cockatoos produce large quantities of dust from their powder down feathers, which may be problematic for people with allergies. Cockatiels, rose-breasted cockatoos, and greys also produce smaller amounts of feather dust.\n\nDifferent species (sometimes even different individuals within species) can vary greatly in temperament, noise, and talking ability. For example, \"Pionus\" parrots generally have a reserved stance, while at the other end, large cockatoos need at least several hours of attention daily. The upbringing and genetic inclination of an individual bird plays a major role in determining its disposition, regardless of species.\n\nMany of the larger parrots are unsuitable in an apartment setting due to noise level. Although all parrots will make some noise, species that are generally less noisy include parrotlets, budgies, cockatiels, \"Pyrrhura\" conures, \"Pionus\", caiques, greys, and usually \"Poicephalus\". Many of the other species of conures can be loud birds. Cockatoos, and many macaws and amazon parrots can be very loud, though normally only at certain times of the day and some birds will learn to scream for attention.\n\nMany people are initially attracted to parrots for their ability to talk, sing, and mimic noises they are exposed to. Some parrot species such as greys, eclectus, quaker parrots, male budgies, and some species of amazon parrots, macaws, and Psittacula are frequently good talkers and mimickers, although there is no guarantee that any individual parrot will talk. Many parrots learn to use words in context; for example, calling family members by name, or requesting certain food items by name. Other species are poor talkers, but popular for their affectionate or playful personalities.\n\nBudgies, cockatiels, lovebirds, and parrotlets have been bred in captivity the longest and are popular and readily available in many color mutations; by some definitions they are domesticated. These species make up the vast majority of individual parrots kept as pets. Although small parrots are generally much easier to care for than larger species, they are still intelligent birds that need attention and interaction. Budgies have been bred as pets for over 150 years, exist in two distinct breeds (American and English), and generally have excellent pet qualities. Many new owners are surprised at how affectionate and interactive even these small parrots can be once they are tamed.\n\nParrots need a cage large enough to exercise in, stretch their wings, and climb if it will not be out for a good part of the day. Without exercise, parrots tend to become obese and unhealthy.\n\nToys (enrichment) are necessary for pet parrots. Different birds may have very different toy preferences. Toys should be sized appropriately for the bird's size and destructiveness; for example, a small plastic budgie toy could be dangerous for a large parrot that could break off and ingest a piece. Some birds may prefer wooden toys to chew up; some may prefer bells or other toys that make noise; some may prefer toys with leather strips they can untie; some may prefer a bowl of small 'foot toys' they can throw around. Some birds may destroy their toys quickly. Although commercial bird toys can be expensive, it is possible for owners to save money by making their own toys and providing other items such as cardboard, blocks of wood, pine cones, or freshly cut branches from non-toxic trees for a parrot to chew on and play with.\nParrots use their hooked beaks to help them to climb around, as well as to shell seeds and nuts. It is normal for a parrot to use its beak to explore and to get around; it is common, for example, for a parrot to rest its beak on a person's hand to steady itself as it steps up. Many parrots also like to gently beak or attempt to preen their owner's hands. However, even tame parrots can bite humans, particularly if confused or frightened, so it is wise to keep larger birds caged around small children they are not familiar with. Large parrots such as macaws and cockatoos have powerful beaks designed for crushing large nuts. It is generally not recommended to have any large parrot on the shoulder, because it is difficult to observe the parrot there for warning signs prior to a bite, and it is also easier for a parrot to slip and bite to catch itself. A large parrot bite to the face can do severe damage and destroy the trust between owner and bird. Often bites are not intentional; for example, if the bird slips from the owner's shoulder, it is likely to try to grab the nearest thing to hold on to, which may well be part of the owner's face.\n\nWhile many parrot species do well with well-behaved children, and can be excellent family pets, they are generally not a good \"child's\" pet due to their potential lifespan and care required. Parrots require consistent daily care and attention and are also longer lived than most other companion animals. Lifespans range from around 15 years for a budgie or lovebird, to 20–30 years for a cockatiel or small conure, up to 80 to 100 years for amazons and macaws—although a more reasonable lifespan for larger parrots is estimated at 50–60 years. Additionally, a young child could unintentionally injure a small bird such as a budgie; some parrots unaccustomed to children may find the high energy level and noise of a young child threatening and may bite. The bite strength of larger birds such as Macaws can be very dangerous and is well in excess of even a pit bull dog (375 psi compare to 275 psi). Parrots that have been raised and socialized around children from a young age typically do much better with children than parrots who are introduced to children at a later age. Households that are suitable for pet parrots are said to be \"bird-safe\".\n\nThere is a small industry in breeding parrots for the pet trade. Breeders may range from small hobby breeders caring for just a pair or two to large breeding farms that may house hundreds of pairs. When chicks are small, breeders may put a specially made closed bird ring (bird band) on one of their legs with identifying characters stamped into the plastic. A closed ring would not fit over the foot of an adult parrot, so its presence proves that the bird was banded when it was a young chick. Some breeders leave the chicks in the nest longer and thus have to use an open band on the bird's leg. However, some breeders do not band the smaller commonly bred parrots, and some owners may have their bird's band removed after purchase because of the possibility that a band might become caught on a toy or other object and cause injury (removal of a band should be done by a veterinarian or experienced person). Bands are the main method for identifying an individual bird, which is helpful if the bird is lost. Sometimes the larger and more expensive parrots are micro-chipped with a tiny security device, as well as being tagged with a leg ring.\n\nPlaces for young parrots include breeders and specialty bird stores that ensure the chicks are healthy, well socialized with people and raised properly. Before being taken to a new home, hand-reared chicks will be fully fledged (have been allowed to learn to fly), can crack nuts and seeds for themselves, and will have been fully weaned from semisolid hand-rearing food (or fed by its parents) to an appropriate diet. Some breeders will additionally accustom their young parrots to different experiences, such as harness-training, traveling, and handling by a variety of people including children, taking advantage of this impressionable period of development.\n\nAdult parrots that are rehomed by their owners or offered for adoption from a parrot shelter often make excellent pets after they adjust to a new home. Some of these, however, may have been neglected or abused in the past, and may do best with an experienced parrot owner. The rehoming of a companion parrot, in most cases, can be avoided by doing enough research before acquiring one and determining whether the potential buyer has a lifestyle that suits the species he/she is considering, and choosing a bird that is most compatible with the human's lifestyle. Owners also consider potential lifespan when selecting a species, and make appropriate arrangements if the bird is likely to outlive the owner.\n\n"}
{"id": "10763443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10763443", "title": "Crash of the Titans", "text": "Crash of the Titans\n\nCrash of the Titans is a platform game developed by Radical Entertainment and published by Vivendi Games for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable (ported by SuperVillain Studios), Wii and Xbox 360. The Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions of the game were developed by Amaze Entertainment. The game was first released in North America on October 3, 2007, in Europe on October 12, 2007 and in Australia on October 25, 2007. It is the first game in the \"Crash Bandicoot\" series not to have a Japanese release.\n\n\"Crash of the Titans\" is the fourteenth installment in the \"Crash Bandicoot\" video game series, the sixth game in the main franchise, and the first in the \"Mutant\" subseries. The game's story centers on the discovery of a substance known as \"Mojo\", which the antagonist of the series, Doctor Neo Cortex, plans to use to turn the inhabitants of the Wumpa Islands into an army of loyal mutants known as \"Titans\". The protagonist of the series, Crash Bandicoot, must stop Cortex by using the technique of \"jacking\" to take control of and destroy Cortex's Titans while collecting the mojo.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews upon its release, while the DS version received favourable reception. Critics disparaged the game's short length, and although the game's variety was generally seen positively, reviewers noted little outstanding in the game. Despite this mediocre reception, the game was nominated for two awards.\n\n\"Crash of the Titans\" is a beat-em-up game with platforming aspects in which the player controls Crash Bandicoot, whose main objective is to rescue his sister, Coco, and save his home, the Wumpa Island, from being destroyed by the main antagonist's gigantic robot. The player's first goal is to rescue the sentient mask Aku Aku, who gives the player basic instructions, shields Crash from enemy attacks, and transforms into a skateboard to help Crash traverse slippery terrain. From there, each level (known as an \"episode\") asks players to complete fights against large groups of enemies or simply progress through the episode.\n\nCrash starts the game with four lives. The length of each of Crash's lives is tied to his health meter, which decreases whenever Crash is damaged from enemy attacks or falls down a bottomless pit. The player can replenish Crash's health meter by instructing Crash to eat Wumpa Fruit. Each time the health meter is fully depleted, Crash loses a life. However, the player can win an additional life for Crash by collecting 25,000 units of the magical substance Mojo or by collecting a rare type of Golden Wumpa Fruit. After the last life is lost, the player can continue playing by restarting the current episode.\n\nEach episode contains a portal leading to a simple mini-game arena, where the player must accomplish a task in a set time. Generally the task involves collecting a specified quantity of Mojo, using an enemy animal's attacks to snipe targets, or simply defeating a select number of enemies. At the end of each episode, the player earns a rank of a bronze, silver, or gold voodoo doll; the rank can be improved by defeating a set number of minions, destroying three robotic toilets or inflicting a minimum number of consecutive hits in combat. All three tasks must be accomplished in an episode if a gold voodoo doll is to be obtained for that episode. Hidden voodoo dolls unlock concept art packages for each episode.\n\nThe Nintendo DS version of \"Crash of the Titans\" contains similar gameplay to that of previous \"Crash\" installments. The game takes place on four islands, each with two levels and a boss. When a boss is defeated, a new island is unlocked. Each island has its own \"Pachinko board\" where players can win \"on-demand items\"; items that can be used to restore health, provide temporary invincibility, and set off Nitro explosions among other things. Additional content can also be won at these Pachinko boards, such as gallery art, cheats and a large quantity of Mojo.\n\nWhereas the previous games featured Crash spinning into or jumping on an enemy to attack, \"Crash of the Titans\" gives him more options for attack. Early in the game, Crash has a light-powered attack and a heavy-powered attack and can also block, dodge or break an enemy's block. When he defeats an enemy or destroys an object, a magical substance known as Mojo is released. When Crash collects enough Mojo, he will earn either an ability upgrade or a new move, such as the Norris Roundhouse or the Triple Dragon. His classic spin attack, named \"Old Skool\", is an unlockable move, along with an aerial variant that allows Crash to float over chasms.\n\nWhile small minions require only a single combo attack for Crash to defeat, larger enemies, known as \"Titans\", require more effort to subdue. Each of the fifteen unique Titans in the game possess a star meter that indicates how close they are to being stunned. The meter rises when Crash starts attacking a Titan, and depletes when he stops. When it is full, the Titan is stunned and susceptible to \"jacking\", meaning Crash can mount the creature and control it. While controlled by the player, the Titan possesses a similar moveset to Crash, although some jacked Titans can shoot projectiles. Besides a greater health, the Titans controlled by Crash have a purple Titan Meter. When this meter is full, players can make the Titan unleash a special attack, which fully drains the meter in the process.\n\nA Titan's durability depends on its size; larger Titans will take more effort to defeat than others and a few are immune to Crash's attacks. To defeat them, Crash has to jack a smaller Titan to fight them. On defeating the larger Titan, he can dismount the Titan he previously jacked and directly jack the larger Titan. The dismounted Titan will then be destroyed.\n\nA player using a second controller can join the game at any time in the form of a white-furred version of Crash known as \"Carbon Crash\". The second player appears in the first player's backpack, and can usually enter or exit the pack. However, the second player has to stay in the backpack if the first player is in mid-air or climbing a wall. This method of play is useful for overpowering enemies and collecting Mojo faster. There are two modes of co-op play; in \"Leapfrog Mode\", the players swap control each time the front player jumps, swings, or slides, while in \"Piggyback Mode\", each player is equipped with their own backpack and can hide in the other player's backpack if the action becomes too intense, such as when jumping over a chasm.\n\nThe setting of \"Crash of the Titans\" features twenty levels. Each level is referred to as an \"episode\", and each has a distinctive subtitle that is usually a reference to popular culture (such as \"The Blizzard of Claws\"). Like the first \"Crash Bandicoot\" game, episodes must be played in order, although the player can replay any episode that has been completed. The game moves through five major themes taking place on Crash's homeland, the Wumpa Islands. The story starts in the jungle near Crash's residence and leads to an ancient temple. Later in the game, Crash travels through a wood-cutting and mining area and a land flowing with lava that features giant steel mosquitoes sucking minerals out of the ground. The next few episodes take place on an artillery-bombarded beach, where Crash infiltrates Doctor N. Gin's missile factory, which resembles the Statue of Liberty. The penultimate area is a gigantic tree located in the middle of the island. This tree holds up an entire house owned by Uka Uka, one of the major antagonists of the series. The final moments of the game take place in the antagonist's Liberace-style lair, and finally inside the Doominator.\n\nNine characters from previous \"Crash Bandicoot\" titles star in the home console version of \"Crash of the Titans\", all of them given a new modern \"punk\" style that is distinct from other and Japanese video game characters. The protagonist of the game, Crash Bandicoot, is a bandicoot who must defeat the main antagonist Doctor Neo Cortex and use the Titans against each other while collecting Mojo to upgrade his fighting techniques. Aiding Crash is Aku Aku, an ancient wooden mask who acts as a shield, a skateboard, and a weapon. He can also help Crash jack Titans. Crash's other two allies are his genius sister Coco Bandicoot and his muscular older brother, Crunch Bandicoot, who is absent in the Nintendo DS version.\n\nDoctor Neo Cortex is a mad scientist who captures Coco and Aku Aku and wants to use stolen Mojo to create an army of mutants. Uka Uka, who is also absent in the Nintendo DS version, is behind Cortex's plot for world domination; after tiring of Cortex's incompetence, Uka replaces him with his cyborg niece, Nina Cortex. Aiding the Cortexes are Doctor N. Gin, who is Cortex's hysterical right-hand man, and Tiny Tiger. Dingodile, another minion of Cortex, exclusively appears in the DS and Game Boy Advance versions of \"Crash of the Titans\" as a boss character. Aiding the villains are a number of small fodder enemies that attempt to hinder Crash in his journey. Each fodder is affiliated with a certain villain in the game. The first fodders encountered are Neo Cortex's Ratnicians, which appear as bipedal, chihuahua-like animals dressed as laboratory researchers. These characters appear in the first four episodes of the game, and are replaced by other enemies as the game progresses. The later enemies include Tiny Tiger's Southern-accented Koo-alas, Doctor N. Gin's monkey wrench-wielding Doom Monkeys, Uka Uka's spear-chucking Voodoo Bunnies, and Nina Cortex's Brat Girls. Radical Entertainment sought to give these minor characters personalities by giving them a large number of distinctive quotations.\n\nIn the beginning of the game, Crash Bandicoot aids Coco with a butter-recycling device. Doctor Neo Cortex arrives, captures Aku Aku and Coco and encases Crunch in ice. Crash throws Coco's machine at Cortex's airship, severing the chain holding Aku Aku's cage, which causes the cage to fall into the nearby forest. After Crash rescues Aku Aku, they discover that Cortex and Uka Uka are stealing Mojo from a nearby temple and decide to stop them. On reaching the temple, Cortex reveals his plot to use the stolen Mojo to create an army of loyal mutants, which will be used to build a robot known as the Doominator, that will crush the Wumpa Islands and take over the world. After failing to defeat Crash with his Yuktopus cyborg, Cortex boasts that Crash will never find his base and flies off, leaving Crash and Aku Aku to follow him.\n\nAt Cortex's base, Uka Uka derides Cortex for failing to destroy Crash and replaces Cortex with his niece, Nina Cortex, despite protests from Neo, N. Gin and Tiny Tiger. Nina has Coco brainwashed and makes her participate in the construction of the Doominator. Throughout the course of the game, Crash and Aku Aku interrogate Tiny Tiger, Doctor N. Gin and Uka Uka on the whereabouts of Coco. When they confront Nina Cortex inside the Doominator robot, Nina summons her Arachnina cyborg and fights Crash. Crash eventually destroys the robot, liberating Coco and disabling the Doominator. The Doominator collapses and barely misses the Bandicoot home (and Crunch), sparing much of Wumpa Island. Escaping from the collapsed Doominator, Cortex praises Nina for betraying him, and promises to be more evil in the near future. The Bandicoots decide that it is time for celebration, leading Crash to shout his first word in the series and the object of their celebration: pancakes.\n\nThe DS version of the game largely follows the story of the home console versions, but with minor alterations such as Nina Cortex having a greater role and the inclusion of Dingodile. Near the end of the game, Nina teams up with Crash to stop Doctor Cortex and his dancing \"CortexBot\". The Game Boy Advance version also includes Dingodile, some plot differences, such as the Arachnina (referred to by its old name, \"Spiderbot\") not being the last boss, and Cortex being reinstated after Nina's defeat in the N. Trapment Island.\n\nDevelopment on \"Crash of the Titans\" began after the completion of \"Crash Tag Team Racing\". The graphics of the Wii version of the game was one of Radical Entertainment's main focuses in the game's development, with Radical stating that the Wii has \"a lot of horsepower under the hood\" and expressing their desire to make full use of it. They also considered implementing a feature to connect the Wii to DS during gameplay, but stopped due to technical issues and time. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 2 version got a few extra months of development time to improve its graphics before setting a final release date.\n\nWhile the game was being developed, the title's main character, Crash Bandicoot, became the new mascot of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's \"School and Youth\" programs in an effort to promote the battle against blood cancer. In a bid to further promote the game, a Hummer (with a Wii inside) was painted with imagery from the game and displayed at the Annual Balloon Fiesta in Bristol, United Kingdom. A \"Monster Edition\" of the game was released exclusively in Europe on October 12, 2007 for the PlayStation 2. This special edition of the game features \"Making-of\" videos, water-on tattoos, game hints, a cheat code list, and the game's E3 and theatrical trailers in multiple languages. Due to its \"mild cartoon violence and language\", the game received a PG rating from the BBFC.\n\nUnlike \"Crash Tag Team Racing\", Radical did not hire the composer of the music in the previous \"Crash\" games, the a cappella band Spiralmouth whose members Rebecca Kneubuhl and Gabriel Mann left to compose musical pieces to \"\" and \"\" from Crash's companion franchise \"Spyro the Dragon\", to write the music for \"Crash of the Titans\". Instead, they assigned the job to their in-house composer Marc Baril, who took Spiralmouth's work on the previous games as references for \"Crash of the Titans\". Radical Entertainment has expressed its pride with some of the music featured in the game, such as Doctor N. Gin's polka theme. A 32-track soundtrack was made available on the iTunes Music Store on December 18, 2007. The music in the Nintendo DS version of the game was created by Nathaniel Papadakis.\n\nTo avoid repetitive audio, \"Crash of the Titans\" features more than 7,000 lines of dialogue, many of which contain references to popular culture, such as the film \"Brokeback Mountain\". To achieve a natural feel for their dialogue, the voice actors performed all their lines three times. Many of the voice actors from \"Crash Tag Team Racing\" reprised their roles, including Jess Harnell as Crash Bandicoot and Lex Lang as Doctor Neo Cortex. Characters who were regulars in the series but did not appear in \"Crash Tag Team Racing\" were given new voice actors for \"Crash of the Titans\". These replacements include Greg Eagles as Aku Aku, Chris Williams as Tiny Tiger, and John DiMaggio as Uka Uka. The DS version features full voice acting for cutscenes and in-game elements by some of the same voice actors from the home console version of the game, though some of the voice actors were substituted, such as Debi Derryberry in the role of Coco Bandicoot, and Nolan North in the role of N. Gin. Dingodile, who appears only in the DS and GBA versions, is voiced by Nolan North.\n\nTo make enemies memorable on their own; Radical Entertainment scripted conversations between the enemy characters that can be overheard as the player approaches. Several voice actors provide the audio for the small enemies, including Tom Kenny from Nickelodeon's \"SpongeBob SquarePants\". Adding to the game's numerous pop-culture references, the voices and mannerisms of some of the characters are based upon those of real people, including Mike Tyson, Mr. T, Jerry Lewis, and Peter Lorre.\n\n\"Crash of the Titans\" received mixed to average reviews upon its release, except for the DS version, which received positive reviews. GameSpot credited it as a \"fairly sturdy, combat-heavy platformer with a good hook\", but concluded that it lacked the distinctive style of past \"Crash Bandicoot\" games. The DS version of the game was reviewed positively, with IGN naming it \"one of the better handheld Crash games to hit the market\". Nintendo World Report gave the DS version a higher score than the home console version by half a point, but dismissed it as \"a short game that has very little gameplay variety\". GameSpot proclaimed that \"there's plenty to do, and controlling the enemy is a neat twist\", but criticized the game's small length of only six to eight hours.\n\nThe more negative reviews include those from \"Nintendo Power\", who criticized the game for its \"fixed and unforgiving\" camera, which they felt made the platforming experience \"frustrating\". GameSpy also criticized the game for its camera along with its unsteady framerate, but praised the game's attractive graphics and offline co-op mode. IGN described the game as \"a good idea wrapped in a mediocre game\", dismissing the game's music as \"forgettable\", and hoping that the jacking concept would be refined for a possible sequel. Eurogamer was also critical of \"Crash of the Titans\", deriding its graphics as \"designed primarily with the PS2 and Wii in mind, with a fairly lazy high-def makeover late in development\". The PSP version received less praise than its console counterparts, with IGN remarking that it \"loses out to the consoles in a number of areas; especially when it comes to multiplayer\".\n\n\"Crash of the Titans\" was a nominee in the Writers Guild of America's inaugural video game writing awards, competing against \"Dead Head Fred\", \"The Simpsons Game\", \"The Witcher\" and \"World in Conflict\"; \"Dead Head Fred\" won the award. \"Crash of the Titans\" was also selected as a nominee in the \"Best Sound Design\" and \"Best Character\" categories of the Second Annual Elan Awards. It lost both awards to \"Skate\" and \"Mass Effect\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Commander Shepard respectively.\n\nIn Australia, \"Crash of the Titans\" was the second highest-selling game in its first week below \"Halo 3\". The game was not as successful in the United Kingdom, where the PS2 version of the game debuted at #32 in the sales charts. The game made £3.35 million in the UK, by the end of 2007. Despite the poor sales in the UK, the game was re-released on Platinum for the PlayStation and for the Xbox 360 Classics. \n\n"}

Electric Playground thought the game was identical to Vikings sans the historical setting, though noted that Crusader had a more complex story and gameplay. On the contrary, Quandaryland thought that Crusader seemed flatter, and less life-like than Vikings. While Nquest positively reviewed the title, it argued that it was more of an interactive encyclopedia than a game.

Officially opened in May 1980 by founder Len Cullen and his wife, Connie, the Gardens were a major tourist attraction in Whitby for 25 years.\n\nCullen Gardens combined the natural beauty of floral displays and gardens, along with a unique southern Ontario-themed miniature village. The miniature village included many houses and trains that would travel around and between the houses. Other features included radio-controlled miniature boats. It was an entertaining attraction for both children and adults. In 1983, the Miniature Village served as the filming location for an episode of the Canadian television series \"The Littlest Hobo\", entitled \"Small Pleasures\" (season 4, episode 16).\n\nDuring the Winter holiday season, Cullen Gardens was host to the Festival of Lights, which featured huge displays of Christmas lights throughout the grounds, often decorating large topiaries.\n\nOn 1 January 2006, Cullen Gardens and Miniature Village closed. The land, however, has since been purchased by the Town of Whitby, to remain in the public domain as a municipal park. There has been speculation that the property may link up with the Heber Downs conservation area. At the time of its closure, the park was co-owned by Sue Cullen-Green and Bryan Green.\n\nThe miniature Village no longer exists at the site and the model buildings were sold to the nearby City of Oshawa for $234,000. Oshawa later put them up for sale again rather than opening an attraction of its own, citing budgetary austerity. The golf course formerly attached to Cullen Gardens continues to operate.\n\nThe miniature buildings were purchased by the Niagara Parks Commission in 2012. Many of the miniature buildings are now on display at the NPC's Botanical Gardens in Niagara Falls, Canada.\n\nIn November 2011, the Town entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Auberge et Spa Le Nordik Inc. of Chelsea, Quebec. Le Nordik bought the main building and 3 hectares of land. They intend to use the main building and outdoor area to build a year-round heat therapy spa with two restaurants, a retail boutique and a small conference area. The remaining land was designated as open space and parkland, known as Cullen Central Park. The deal closed in 2013 and the spa was supposed to open in 2015.\n\n"}

It is considered a major fundraiser for the Western Pennsylvania School for the Deaf and has raised, on average, between $3,000 and $4,000 per show. Proceeds from the event benefit Pennsylvania school programs to educate Deaf students.\n\nThe event was first produced in 1994, originally as part of the Steel City Wrestling promotion, and produced six editions until the promotion closed in 2000, and two more independently. The school, according to Zoltan, then decided to discontinue the event due to the increasing violence and adult content associated with professional wrestling during the late-1990s. Two of his sons, both Deaf, attended the school during this period. Following a seven-year hiatus, it was revived for the school's 140th anniversary in 2009; the highlight of the show was J.J. Dillon who, in his first in-ring appearance since 1989, teamed with \"Beef Stew\" Lou Marconi and \"Handsome\" Frank Staletto in a six-man tag team match against \"Franchise\" Shane Douglas, Dominic Denucci and Cody Michaels.\n\nThe event is a staple on the East Coast and Mid-Atlantic independent circuit. Unlike standard wrestling events, however, an interpreter is provided to sign for the students during promos and for other parts of the show. Among the promotions represented at the event are the International Wrestling Cartel, Keystone State Wrestling Alliance, National Wrestling Alliance and UCW Wrestling; the arrival of the North Carolina-based G.O.U.G.E.

{"id": "7843108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7843108", "title": "Digital television adapter", "text": "Digital television adapter\n\nA digital television adapter (DTA), commonly known as a converter box, is a television tuner that receives a digital television (DTV) transmission, and converts the digital signal into an analog signal that can be received and displayed on an analog television set. The input digital signal may be over-the-air terrestrial television signals received by a television antenna, or signals from a digital cable system. It normally does not refer to satellite TV, which has always required a set-top box either to operate the big satellite dish, or to be the integrated receiver/decoder (IRD) in the case of direct-broadcast satellites (DBS).\n\nIn North America, these ATSC tuner boxes convert from ATSC to NTSC, while in most of Europe and other places such as Australia, they convert from Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) to PAL. Because the DTV transition did nothing to reduce the number of broadcast television system standards (and in fact further complicated them), and due to varying frequency allocations and bandplans, there are many other combinations specific to other countries.\n\nOn June 12, 2009, all full-power analog television transmissions ended in the United States. Viewers who watch broadcast television on older analog TV sets must use a DTA. Since many of the low-power TV stations will continue to broadcast in analog for years to come, consumers who watch low-power stations will need an adapter with an analog passthrough feature that allows the viewer to watch both digital and analog signals. Viewers who receive their television signals through cable or satellite were not affected by this change and did not need a digital television adapter (however, see the cable TV exception below). Additionally, viewers who have newer televisions with built-in digital ATSC tuners will not need an external digital television adapter.\n\nThe United States government had set up a program to offer consumers a $40 \"coupon\" which could be used toward the purchase of a coupon-eligible converter box; that program ended in July 2006.\n\nAt the Consumer Electronics Association's Entertainment Technology Policy Summit in January 2006, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein said many Americans did not know about the February 17, 2006, deadline for ending analog TV. Furthermore, he said, too many people were still buying analog TV sets, meaning more demand for converter boxes. And even if people found out what they would have to do, converter boxes might not do the job adequately. Tribune Broadcasting chief technology officer Ira Goldstone said just buying a converter box did not necessarily mean getting the latest technology. Bob Seidel of CBS said companies (especially in countries other than the US) might use cheaper tuners, and people would need new television antennas for proper reception. Circuit City Chairman Alan McCollough opposed converter boxes, saying people should just buy digital TVs, and television networks should offer only widescreen-format television programming as an incentive to do that.\n\nPrototypes of the first converter boxes appeared at the NAB show in 2006. LG Electronics, which took over Zenith Electronics in 1999, showed its model connected to a Zenith TV from 1980, while Thomson Consumer Electronics used an RCA TV from 1987 for its demonstration. Both boxes shown used electronic program guides using Program and System Information Protocol (PSIP). The devices showed program details, V-chip ratings and signal strength. Thomson's model stored three days of TV listings, allowed parental controls, and could set a VCR.\n\nCable TV systems are under no deadline to convert to digital TV. However, many Comcast (and some other cable TV) customers are finding all of their non-local and non-shopping networks eliminated on various dates, even though only a few are needed for additional digital cable channels. CECBs (Coupon-eligible converter boxes) will not work on these systems because cable ATSC uses 256QAM modulation instead of 8VSB, and so a separate but similar DTA with a QAM tuner is necessary. If the cable company takes away analog channels, at least two of these adapters must be provided for free by the cable company for at least three years so that customers can continue to watch the same channels with existing equipment. Cable companies were required to provide some analog service until October 2006. After that, taking away analog channels allowed faster Internet and more HD channels. An adapter from the cable provider was needed even for digital TVs if the company scrambled its digital signals to prevent piracy.\n\nA digital transport adapter will allow viewing of basic channels, often as many as 99, but not premium channels. It will also not allow video on demand or pay-per-view. Simple DTAs only allow analog sets to receive digital signals using RF output on channel 3 or 4, using coaxial cable. Other versions of the DTA are available.\n\nPace plc developed the XiD-P digital transport adapter for Comcast, allowing 4K service and offering the potential to expand the DTA from one-way to two-way. This would involve adding IP capability.\n\nMost countries that have switched to digital TV use DVB-T broadcasting with MPEG-2 MP@ML or H.264 encoding. Some, however, consider switching to DVB-T2 such as the UK, being the first to test DVB-T2. This results in a number of different combinations for external digital receivers with the MPEG-2 ones sold at about €15 to €35 and the MPEG-4 ones reaching €25 to €150. Currently, all set top boxes sold in EU cannot exceed 0.5W in stand by mode.\n\n\n"}

The lists were compiled by science fiction fans over a number of years, and copies of the list that can be found on the Internet vary in number and order of entries.\n\nThe most famous specific lists, both referred to as the Evil Overlord List, were developed concurrently. Both were published to the web in the early 1990s. The original, if lesser-known list was compiled in 1990 by members of the now-defunct FidoNet Science Fiction and Fandom (SFFAN) email echo. The FidoNet list originated with a 1988 \"Saturday Night Live\" skit featuring Bond Villains touting a book \"What Not To Do When You Capture James Bond\". The FidoNet list arose out of discussions regarding what sort of advice might be in that book, and was compiled and published by Jack Butler. It predated the following list, but was only widely published later, and is the more obscure of the two.\n\nThe later-produced and more famous version of the list was compiled in 1994 by Peter Anspach (hence it is occasionally titled \"Peter's Evil Overlord List\") based on informal discussions at conventions and on online bulletin boards in the early 1990s, and has subsequently become one of the best-known parodies of bad SF/F writing, frequently referenced online. It was originally The Top 100 Things I'd Do If I Ever Became An Evil Overlord, but grew to include over 100 entries.\n\nAnspach and Butler acknowledge the existence of each other's lists, and state that their two lists have been so cross-pollinated over the years as to become effectively identical.\n\nThe Evil Overlord List has led to spinoffs, including lists for stock characters including (but not limited to) heroes, henchmen, sidekicks, the Evil Overlord's Accountant, and Starfleet captains.\n\nIn Australia, a minor literary scandal erupted in 1997 when it emerged that award-winning author Helen Darville plagiarised this list for her regular column in Brisbane's \"Courier-Mail\" newspaper, which led to her being fired.\n\nTeresa Nielsen Hayden, noted author and lecturer, uses an expanded version of the list in her lectures on writing science fiction. She recommends selecting five random clichés from the list, and using them, or their reverse (\"Say you've drawn A-34, 'I will not turn into a snake. It never helps.' You can have a character turn into a snake and find it doesn't help, or do it and find it very useful indeed\") as the basis for a plot.\n\nFrom 2001–2002, the alt.eo Alt.* hierarchy newsgroup was dedicated to discussing and adding to the list.\n\nIn 2007, issue #6 of Marvel Comics' \"Heroes for Hire\" featured a Doombot which had been reprogrammed with the contents of the list.\n\n\"If I Were An Evil Overlord\", a 2007 short story anthology edited by Martin H. Greenberg and Russell Davis, explicitly references the various lists as source material.\n\nPS238, issue 33 (published in 2008), includes a mention of the EOL in the main story, plus an appendix with fifty major points from the list. \n\nIn the S.M. Stirling novel \"The Protector's War\", excerpts from the list are printed in the back of the book of plans distributed to the Protector's subordinate nobles.\n\nJim Butcher refers to the list a number of times in his contemporary fantasy series, The Dresden Files.\n\nIn May 2012, students from Lehigh University of Pennsylvania published a blog post that examined how much it would cost to follow all of the instructions on the list. The students concluded that while some money would be saved, overall it would require $14,268,632.\n\n"}
{"id": "1529582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1529582", "title": "Free-to-view", "text": "Free-to-view\n\nFree-to-view (FTV) is a term used for audio and/or video transmissions that are provided free-of-charge without any form of continual subscription but are nevertheless encrypted. It differs from free-to-air (FTA) where content is not encrypted.\n\nThe free-to-view system contrasts with free-to-air (FTA), in which signals are transmitted in the clear, without encryption, and can be received by anyone with a suitable receiving dish antenna and DVB-compliant receiver (although these services can include proprietary encrypted data services such as an EPG that is only available to reception equipment made for, or authorised by, the FTA broadcaster). Free-to-view services are broadcast encrypted and can only be viewed with reception equipment that includes a suitable conditional-access module and viewing card, in the same way as a pay-TV satellite service. However, the FTV service viewing card is not subject to a continuing subscription payment for viewing the service's channels and may be available for a regular fee, a one-off payment or even for free.\n\nServices which charge a regular fee for reception can still be considered free-to-view, and not pay-TV if the fee is not for the programming content but for the delivery. For example, the HD+ service in Germany, which broadcasts HD versions of channels which are also available free-to-air in standard definition, defended its service fee saying it \"is related to the reception of the offer and not to specific content, parts or packages of the offer\".\n\nThe free-to-view system allows for restricting access based on location of the viewer. For example, in the UK prior to the launch of Astra 2D, UK channels broadcasting from the Astra 28.2°E satellites used a wide beam and could be received across Europe on small dishes. Those channels which were non-subscription but aimed at the UK only, or restricted from broadcasting outside the UK by way of programme rights (such as Channel 5) or governance (such as the BBC channels), were broadcast encrypted using Videoguard (as used by Sky (UK) for its pay-TV services) with viewing cards made available to UK residents only.\n\nThe launch of Astra 2D with a broadcast beam narrowly aimed at the UK and Ireland only enabled UK channels to switch from broadcasting free-to-view to free-to-air, while maintaining their UK exclusivity. The decline of UK free-to-view in favour of narrow-beamed free-to-air has been gradual:\n\n\nThe remaining channel aimed exclusively at the UK that use the Astra satellites at 28.2°E with a Europe-wide beam and remain free-to-view and encrypted is Sony Entertainment Television and they can be viewed with a Sky Videoguard receiver and a Sky viewing card, either an inactive former Sky pay-TV card or one for the Freesat from Sky package, bought for a one-off fee.\n\nA UK satellite service from Sky (UK) offering 240 free-to-air and free-to-view TV channels and the Sky EPG, with a one-off payment for a Sky receiver, dish, installation and viewing card.\n\nA package of 21 high definition digital satellite TV channels for German-speaking viewers and a subsidiary company of satellite owner SES, with a monthly or annual fee for the viewing card.\n\nAustralian satellite television platform providing digital TV and radio services to remote and rural areas, and terrestrial black spots.

The hamster crossing the finish line in the shortest amount of time wins. According to a 2001 media report, the world-record time for this course setup is 38 seconds.\n\nEvents may feature as few as two hamsters or many teams of hamsters and human pit crews. Hamster balls may be simple spheres or feature many design modifications purported to increase the performance and style of the race vehicle.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, gamblers can place bets on the outcome of hamster races through online bookmakers.\n\nIn 2001, an epidemic of foot and mouth disease caused the cancellation of some British horse races and other sporting events. To boost their lagging bookmaking incomes, betting agencies introduced and promoted the concept of professional hamster racing. Online bookmaker Blue Square organized the first hamster racing series, with the rodents racing in hamster dragsters. A series of qualifying rounds were held over a week, with a final race. The event was webcast live on the internet and generated significant media interest, including full-page articles in the Daily Mail and Sun newspapers, as well as live reports on BBC London and Sky News. This high level of media interest was in part due to the cancellation of horse racing at the time.\n\nWhile largely confined to the United Kingdom, professional hamster racing has since made inroads in the United States and Asia.\n\nRace hamsters are almost always divided into at least two race classes, which follow their species classifications: dwarfs and Syrians. They are also often divided into other race classes, such as novice, patterned and long-hair or short-hair.\n\nNot all hamster racing is done professionally or for betting purposes. Amateur hamster races are popular at church outings and frequently occur at hamster and rodent shows. Amateur races generally do not conform to the professional 9 meter (30 ft) track distance but may use shorter \"sprint\" tracks designed to make sure all hamsters finish in a reasonable time. Fast hamsters are capable of winning sprint races in just a few seconds.\n\nPetco\n\nIn early 2007, Petco announced the return of biannual hamster races in all of its stores. The event is branded the \"Petco Hamster Ball Derby\" and takes place in late March and early September of each year. The 2006 races featured more than 14,000 amateur race hamsters and their owners in Petco stores across the country.\n\nPetco uses a nonstandard short track and hamsters run in common spherical balls rather than the elaborate \"drag racers\" that professional race hamsters often use (see MTV Sponsorship \"infra\"). Races usually only last a few seconds due to the length of the track. Winners receive various prizes such as gift cards, training equipment and hamster treats.\n\nMTV\nIn May 2006 MTV began promotion of \"HamTrak '06,\" a world tour of professional hamster racers featuring hamster teams sponsored by \"The Sun\", \"XFM\", \"Pimp My Ride\" and others.\n\nThe first HamTrak race, held on May 19, 2006 at the Hammywood Hills Rodent Raceway, was won by the New Media Age sponsored \"Team Hot Rodent,\" powered by the eight-month-old female Syrian hamster Michelle Schuhamster. It was her 24th career win.\n\nOne issue that has limited the growth of professional hamster racing is the difficulty in handicapping, or attempting to predict the winner, of a hamster racing contest. As with horse racing, the handicapping of hamsters relies on observations of the speed, pace, form, and class of the animal. However, while many bettors believe themselves to be good horse handicappers, few know what to look for in hamster handicapping as they are unfamiliar with the species. This means that the large population of horse racing bettors are often unwilling to migrate to hamster racing because to do so would require either placing uninformed, pure-chance bets or learning to judge and handicap an entirely new animal.\n\n"}
{"id": "87062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=87062", "title": "Henry Cowell", "text": "Henry Cowell\n\nHenry Dixon Cowell (; March 11, 1897 – December 10, 1965) was an American composer, music theorist, pianist, teacher, publisher, and impresario. His contribution to the world of music was summed up by Virgil Thomson, writing in the early 1950s:\nHenry Cowell's music covers a wider range in both expression and technique than that of any other living composer. His experiments begun three decades ago in rhythm, in harmony, and in instrumental sonorities were considered then by many to be wild. Today they are the Bible of the young and still, to the conservatives, \"advanced.\"... No other composer of our time has produced a body of works so radical and so normal, so penetrating and so comprehensive. Add to this massive production his long and influential career as a pedagogue, and Henry Cowell's achievement becomes impressive indeed. There is no other quite like it. To be both fecund and right is given to few.\nBorn in rural Menlo Park, California, to two bohemian writers—his father was an Irish immigrant and his mother, a former schoolteacher, had relocated from Iowa—Cowell demonstrated precocious musical talent and began playing the violin at the age of five. After his parents' divorce in 1903, he was raised by his mother, Clarissa Dixon, author of the early feminist novel \"Janet and Her Dear Phebe\". His father, with whom he maintained contact, introduced him to the Irish music that would be a touchstone for Cowell throughout his career. While receiving no formal musical education (and little schooling of any kind beyond his mother's home tutelage), he began to compose in his mid-teens.\n\nBy the summer of 1914, Cowell was writing truly individualistic works, including the insistently repetitive \"Anger Dance\" (originally \"Mad Dance\"). That fall, the largely self-taught Cowell was admitted to the University of California, Berkeley, as a protégé of Charles Seeger. There he studied harmony and other subjects under Seeger and Edward Griffith Stricklen and counterpoint under Wallace Arthur Sabin. After two years at Berkeley, Cowell pursued further studies in New York where he encountered Leo Ornstein, the radically \"futurist\" composer-pianist. Still a teenager, Cowell wrote the piano piece \"Dynamic Motion\" (1916), his first important work to explore the possibilities of the tone cluster (). It requires the performer to use both forearms to play massive secundal chords and calls for keys to be held down without sounding to extend and intensify its dissonant cluster overtones.\n\nCowell soon returned to California, where he had become involved with a theosophical community, Halcyon, led by the Irish poet John Varian, who fueled Cowell's interest in Irish folk culture and mythology. In 1917, Cowell wrote the music for Varian's stage production \"The Building of Banba\"; the prelude he composed, \"The Tides of Manaunaun\", with its rich, evocative clusters, would become Cowell's most famous and widely performed work. In later years, Cowell would claim that the piece had been composed around 1912 (and \"Dynamic Motion\" in 1914), in an evident attempt to make his musical innovations appear even more precocious than they already were.\n\nBeginning in the early 1920s, Cowell toured widely in North America and Europe as a pianist, playing his own experimental works, seminal explorations of atonality, polytonality, polyrhythms, and non-Western modes. It was on one of these tours that in 1923, his friend Richard Buhlig introduced Cowell to young pianist Grete Sultan in Berlin. They worked closely together—an aspect vital to Grete Sultan's personal and artistic development. Cowell later made such an impression with his tone cluster technique that Béla Bartók requested his permission to adopt it. Another novel method advanced by Cowell, in pieces such as \"Aeolian Harp\" (ca. 1923), was what he dubbed \"string piano\"—rather than using the keys to play, the pianist reaches inside the instrument and plucks, sweeps, and otherwise manipulates the strings directly. Cowell's endeavors with string piano techniques were the primary inspiration for John Cage's development of the prepared piano. In early chamber music pieces, such as \"Quartet Romantic\" (1915–17) and \"Quartet Euphometric\" (1916–19 ), Cowell pioneered a compositional approach he called \"rhythm-harmony\": \"Both quartets are polyphonic, and each melodic strand has its own rhythm,\" he explained. \"Even the canon in the first movement of the \"Romantic\" has different note-lengths for each voice.\"\n\nIn 1919, Cowell had begun writing \"New Musical Resources\", which would finally be published after extensive revision in 1930. Focusing on the variety of innovative rhythmic and harmonic concepts he used in his compositions (and others that were still entirely speculative), it would have a powerful effect on the American musical avant-garde for decades after. Conlon Nancarrow, for instance, would refer to it years later as having \"the most influence of anything I've ever read in music.\"\n\nCowell's interest in harmonic rhythm, as discussed in \"New Musical Resources\", led him in 1930 to commission Léon Theremin to invent the Rhythmicon, or Polyrhythmophone, a transposable keyboard instrument capable of playing notes in periodic rhythms proportional to the overtone series of a chosen fundamental pitch. The world's first electronic rhythm machine, with a photoreceptor-based sound production system proposed by Cowell (not a theremin-like system, as some sources incorrectly state), it could produce up to sixteen different rhythmic patterns simultaneously, complete with optional syncopation. Cowell wrote several original compositions for the instrument, including an orchestrated concerto, and Theremin built two more models. Soon, however, the Rhythmicon would be virtually forgotten, remaining so until the 1960s, when progressive pop music producer Joe Meek experimented with its rhythmic concept.\n\nCowell pursued a radical compositional approach through the mid-1930s, with solo piano pieces remaining at the heart of his output—important works from this era include \"The Banshee\" (1925), requiring numerous playing methods such as pizzicato and longitudinal sweeping and scraping of the strings (), and the manic, cluster-filled \"Tiger\" (1930), inspired by William Blake's famous poem. Much of Cowell's public reputation continued to be based on his trademark pianistic technique: a critic for the \"San Francisco News\", writing in 1932, referred to Cowell's \"famous 'tone clusters,' probably the most startling and original contribution any American has yet contributed to the field of music.\" A prolific composer of songs (he would write over 180 during his career), Cowell returned in 1930–31 to \"Aeolian Harp\", adapting it as the accompaniment to a vocal setting of a poem by his father, \"How Old Is Song?\" He built on his substantial oeuvre of chamber music, with pieces such as the Adagio for Cello and Thunder Stick (1924) that explored unusual instrumentation and others that were even more progressive: \"Six Casual Developments\" (1933), for clarinet and piano, sounds like something Jimmy Giuffre would compose thirty years later. His \"Ostinato Pianissimo\" (1934) placed him in the vanguard of those writing original scores for percussion ensemble. He created forceful large-ensemble pieces during this period as well, such as the Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (1928)—with its three movements, \"Polyharmony,\" \"Tone Cluster,\" and \"Counter Rhythm\" ()—and the Sinfonietta (1928), whose scherzo Anton Webern conducted in Vienna. In the early 1930s, Cowell began to delve seriously into aleatoric procedures, creating opportunities for performers to determine primary elements of a score's realization. One of his major chamber pieces, the \"Mosaic Quartet\" (String Quartet No. 3) (1935), is scored as a collection of five movements with no preordained sequence.\n\nCowell was the central figure in a circle of avant-garde composers that included his good friends Carl Ruggles and Dane Rudhyar, as well as Leo Ornstein, John Becker, Colin McPhee, French expatriate Edgard Varèse, and Ruth Crawford, whom he convinced Charles Seeger to take on as a student (Crawford and Seeger would eventually marry). Cowell and his circle were sometimes referred to as \"ultra-modernists,\" a label whose definition is flexible and origin unclear (it has also been applied to a few composers outside the immediate circle, such as George Antheil, and to some of its disciples, such as Nancarrow); Virgil Thomson styled them the \"rhythmic research fellows.\" In 1925, Cowell organized the New Music Society, one of whose primary activities was the staging of concerts of their works along with those of artistic allies such as Wallingford Riegger and Arnold Schoenberg, who would later ask Cowell to play for his composition class during one of his European tours. In 1927 Cowell founded the periodical \"New Music Quarterly\", which would publish many significant new scores under his editorship, both by the ultra-modernists and many others, including Ernst Bacon, Otto Luening, Paul Bowles, and Aaron Copland. Before the publication of the first issue, he solicited contributions from a then-obscure composer who would become one of his closest friends, Charles Ives. Major scores by Ives, including the \"Comedy\" from the Fourth Symphony, \"Fourth of July\", \"34 Songs\", and \"19 Songs\", would receive their first publication in \"New Music\"; in turn, Ives would provide financial support to a number of Cowell's projects (including, years later, \"New Music\" itself). Many of the scores published in Cowell's journal were made even more widely available as performances of them were issued by the record label he established in 1934, New Music Recordings.\n\nThe ultra-modernist movement had expanded its reach in 1928, when Cowell led a group that included Ruggles, Varèse, his fellow expatriate Carlos Salzedo, American composer Emerson Whithorne, and Mexican composer Carlos Chávez in founding the Pan-American Association of Composers, dedicated to promoting composers from around the Western Hemisphere and creating a community among them that would transcend national lines. Its inaugural concert, held in New York City in March 1929, featured exclusively Latin American music, including works by Chávez, Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos, Cuban composer Alejandro García Caturla, and the French-born Cuban Amadeo Roldán. Its next concert, in April 1930, focused on the U.S. ultra-modernists, with works by Cowell, Crawford, Ives, Rudhyar, and others such as Antheil, Henry Brant, and Vivian Fine. Over the next four years, Nicolas Slonimsky conducted concerts sponsored by the association in New York, across Europe, and, in 1933, Cuba. Cowell himself had performed there in 1930 and met with Caturla, whom he was publishing in \"New Music\". Cowell would continue to work on both his behalf and Roldán's, whose \"Rítmica No. 5\" (1930) was the first free-standing piece of Western classical music written specifically for percussion ensemble. During this era, Cowell also spread the ultra-modernists' experimental creed as a highly regarded teacher of composition and theory—among his many students were George Gershwin, Lou Harrison, who said he thought of Cowell as \"the mentor of mentors,\" and John Cage, who proclaimed Cowell \"the open sesame for new music in America.\"\n\nEncouragement of the music of Caturla and Roldán, with their proudly African-based rhythms, and of Chávez, whose work often involved instruments and themes of Mexico's indigenous peoples, was natural for Cowell. Growing up on the West Coast, he had been exposed to a great deal of what is now known as \"world music\"; along with Irish airs and dances, he encountered music from China, Japan, and Tahiti. These early experiences helped form his unusually eclectic musical outlook, exemplified by his famous statement \"I want to live in the whole world of music.\" He went on to investigate Indian classical music and, in the late 1920s, began teaching a course, \"Music of the World's Peoples,\" at the New School for Social Research in New York and elsewhere—Harrison's tutelage under Cowell would begin when he enrolled in a version of the course in San Francisco. In 1931 a Guggenheim fellowship enabled Cowell to go to Berlin to study comparative musicology (the predecessor to ethnomusicology) with Erich von Hornbostel. He studied Carnatic theory and gamelan, as well, with leading instructors from South India (P. Sambamoorthy), Java (Raden Mas Jodjhana), and Bali (Ramaleislan).\n\nIn May 1936, Cowell was arrested on a \"morals\" charge for allegedly having oral sex with a seventeen-year-old boy. After initially denying the allegation, under questioning he admitted not only to it but to additional sex acts with the teenager and his male friends. While jailed awaiting a court hearing, he wrote a full confession accompanied by a request for leniency on the basis that \"he was not exclusively homosexual but was in fact in love with a woman he hoped to marry\". The charge was not dropped and Cowell, overruling his attorneys, pled guilty; probation was denied, and he received the standard sentence of one to fifteen years. In August 1937, after a parole hearing, the board of pardons fixed his term of incarceration at the maximum decade-and-a-half.\n\nCowell would ultimately spend four years in San Quentin State Prison. There he taught fellow inmates, directed the prison band, and continued to write music at his customary prolific pace, producing around sixty compositions, including two major pieces for percussion ensemble: the Oriental-toned \"Pulse\" (1939) and the memorably sepulchral \"Return\" (1939). He also continued his experiments in aleatory music: for all three movements of the \"Amerind Suite\" (1939), he wrote five versions, each more difficult than the last. Interpreters of the piece are invited to simultaneously perform two or even three versions of the same movement on multiple pianos. In the Ritournelle (Larghetto and Trio) (1939) for the dance piece \"Marriage at the Eiffel Tower\", performing in Seattle, he explored what he called \"elastic\" form. The twenty-four measures of the Larghetto and the eight of the Trio are each modular; though Cowell offers some suggestions, any hypothetically may be included or not and played once or repeatedly, allowing the piece to stretch or contract at the performers' will—the practical goal being to give a choreographer freedom to adjust the length and character of a dance piece without the usual constraints imposed by a prewritten musical composition.\n\nCowell had contributed to the \"Eiffel Tower\" project at the behest of Cage, who was not alone in lending support to his friend and former teacher. Cowell's cause had been taken up by composers and musicians around the country, although a few, including Ives, broke contact with him. Cowell was eventually paroled in 1940; he relocated to the East Coast and the following year married Sidney Hawkins Robertson (1903–1995, married name Sidney Robertson Cowell), a prominent folk-music scholar who had been instrumental in winning his freedom. Cowell was granted a pardon in 1942.\n\nDespite the pardon—which allowed him to work at the Office of War Information, creating radio programs for broadcast overseas—arrest, incarceration, and attendant notoriety had a devastating effect on Cowell. Conlon Nancarrow, on meeting him for the first time in 1947, reported, \"The impression I got was that he was a terrified person, with a feeling that 'they're going to get him.'\" The experience took a lasting toll on his music: Cowell's compositional output became strikingly more conservative soon after his release from San Quentin, with simpler rhythms and a more traditional harmonic language. Many of his later works are based on American folk music, such as the series of eighteen \"Hymn and\" \"Fuguing Tune\"s (1943–64); folk music had certainly played a role in a number of Cowell's prewar compositions, but the provocative transformations that had been his signature were now largely abandoned. And, as Nancarrow observed, there were other consequences to Cowell's imprisonment: \"Of course, after that, politically, he kept his mouth completely shut. He had been radical politically, too, before.\"\n\nNo longer an artistic radical, Cowell nonetheless retained a progressive bent and continued to be a leader (along with Harrison and McPhee) in the incorporation of non-Western musical idioms, as in the Japanese-inflected \"Ongaku\" (1957), Symphony No. 13, \"Madras\" (1956–58) (which had its premiere in the eponymous city), and \"Homage to Iran\" (1959). His most compelling, poignant songs date from this era, including \"Music I Heard\" (to a poem by Conrad Aiken; 1961) and \"Firelight and Lamp\" (to a poem by Gene Baro; 1962). Despite the break in his friendship with Ives, Cowell, in collaboration with his wife, wrote the first major study of Ives's music and provided crucial support to Harrison as his former pupil championed the Ives rediscovery. Cowell resumed teaching—Burt Bacharach, J. H. Kwabena Nketia, and Irwin Swack were among his postwar students—and served as a consultant to Folkways Records for over a decade beginning in the early 1950s, writing liner notes and editing such collections as \"Music of the World's Peoples\" (1951–61) (he also hosted a radio program of the same name) and \"Primitive Music of the World\" (1962). In 1963 he recorded searching, vivid performances of twenty of his seminal piano pieces for a Folkways album. Perhaps liberated by the passage of time and his own seniority, in his final years Cowell again produced a number of individualistic works, such as \"Thesis\" (Symphony No. 15; 1960) and \"26 Simultaneous Mosaics\" (1963).\n\nCowell was elected to the American Institute of Arts and Letters in 1951. He died in 1965 in Shady, New York, after a series of illnesses.\n\n\n\nNote: Correct dating and orthography of titles throughout is based on the standard musicography, \"The Music of Henry Cowell: A Descriptive Catalogue\", by William Lichtenwanger (Brooklyn, N.Y.: Brooklyn College Institute for Studies in American Music, 1986).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was re-recorded for their 1993 major-label debut album, \"Bargainville\". Two live versions were also released on 1998's \"Live Noise\".\n\nThe song is essentially a modern re-telling of \"The Prince and the Pauper\"; it tells the story of a dethroned Spanish monarch, who, after switching places with an identical peasant friend, comes to Canada and gets a minimum wage job at Pizza Pizza. He also mentions working as a turf vacuumer at SkyDome and a Zamboni driver at Maple Leaf Gardens (or Montreal Forum in the indie tape version). The song is narrated by the King, who, throughout the song, tells of the things he did as king and what he would do if he ran Canada. He also suggests that world leaders such as Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin should call him if they need help running their countries.\n\nWhile the song is mostly a cappella, there are some percussion instruments (such as conga and shaker) providing accompaniment. The band dubbed this style \"quasi-a cappella\". The lead vocal is performed by Dave Matheson (who wears a \"King of Spain\" hat while performing the song live), with Jian Ghomeshi, Mike Ford and Murray Foster performing backup.\n\nAs with most of their other songs, the band is known to change it when performing it live. The song is faster and the first chorus is usually performed with no accompaniment, with the callbacks usually being changed to spoken improvisations. The spoken vocals in the second verse (\"There's a roof overhead / and food on our plates\") is usually improvised by Foster and Ghomeshi (examples: \"There's a roof overhead / And poutine on my face!\"; \"There's a cone on your head / Bonita!\"). The \"Leafs call me up to drive the Zamboni\" line is usually changed to represent a local sports team in the city they are performing in. The \"some of you are probably wondering...\" spoken section is usually extended. The end of the song is usually segued into the unreleased song \"Green Eggs and Ham.\" The band is also known to play a grunge version of the song (known as the \"Cranky Monarch Version\" or \"Grunge of Spain\"), which is featured on \"Live Noise\".\n\nA video of the song was made in 1992, and features the band busking outside the Bloor Cinema with Matheson as the King. It also features an \"audience\" made up of local celebrities such as Ed Mirvish and Daniel Richler.\n\nThe Johnstones, a Canadian ska band, often cover this song during their live shows.\n"}

The letterer crafts the comic's \"display lettering\": the story title lettering and other special captions and credits that usually appear on a story's first page. The letterer also writes the letters in the word balloons and draws in sound effects. Many letterers also design logos for the comic book company's various titles.\n\nBy the time comic books came of age in the 1940s, the huge volume of work demanded by publishers had encouraged an assembly-line process, dividing the creative process into distinct tasks: writer, penciller, letterer, inker, and colorist. By the late 1940s, it became possible to make a living just lettering comic strips and comic books for artists, studios, and companies that didn't have the time or desire to do it in-house. The career of freelance letterer was born, and by the 1950s, letterers such as Gaspar Saladino, Sam Rosen, and Ben Oda were crafting full-time careers as letterers for DC Comics, Marvel Comics, and King Features.\n\nLetterer and logo designer Ira Schnapp defined the DC Comics look for nearly thirty years. Starting in 1940, he designed or refined such iconic logos as \"Action Comics\", \"Superman\", \"The Flash\", and \"Justice League of America\", while also creating the distinctive appearance of DC's house ads and promotions. (Schnapp also designed the Comics Code Authority seal, which was a fixture on comic book covers from all major companies for over forty years.)\n\nStarting in around 1966, Schnapp's classic, art deco-inspired look was replaced by the pulsing, organic style of Gaspar Saladino, who redesigned DC's house style for the counterculture era. Gaspar became the cover letterer for all of DC's books throughout the 1970s, and even \"ghosted\" as Marvel Comic's \"page-one\" letterer for much of the same period. Gaspar's work became so iconic that various independent comics publishers which sprang up in the 1970s and 1980s – such as Atlas/Seaboard, Continuity Comics, and Eclipse Comics – hired him to design logos for their entire line of titles.\n\nFrom the 1930 through the 1990s (with a few exceptions), the letterer plied his craft on the same page drawn by the penciler. (The penciled art was then inked after the letterer has completed his work on the page.) At DC Comics during the \"Silver Age\" of the 1960s, pencilers were required to \"rough in balloons and sound effects\" for the letterers to later go over. An accomplished letterer was able to adapt his or her style to the style of the art for that particular book.\n\nThe evolution of desktop publishing powered by computers, especially those made by Apple, began in the 1980s, and started having a gradual impact on comics lettering soon after. One of the first users of computer-generated lettering was writer/artist John Byrne, who made fonts from existing lettering. (Incidentally, Byrne made use of existing lettering by other artists, such as Dave Gibbons, without their permission. Now Byrne uses a computer font based on the handwriting of letterer Jack Morelli – with Morelli's permission.) Other early users of computer lettering were David Cody Weiss and Roxanne Starr, who experimented in computer lettering with Bob Burden's \"Flaming Carrot Comics\".\n\nComputer lettering really started making an impact with the availability of the first commercial comic book font, \"Whizbang\" (created by Studio Daedalus) around 1990.\n\nIn the early 1990s letterer Richard Starkings and his partner John Roshell (formerly Gaushell) began creating comic book fonts and started Comicraft, which has since become the major source of comics fonts (though they have competition from others, such as Blambot).\n\nIn deference to tradition, at first computer lettering was printed out and pasted onto the original artwork, but after a few years, as comics coloring also moved to desktop publishing, digital lettering files began to be used in a more effective way by combining them directly with digital art files, eliminating the physical paste-up stage altogether. Wildstorm Comics was ahead of the curve, Marvel came around a few years later, and DC held to traditional production methods the longest, but now nearly all lettering is digitally applied.\n\nIn the early years of the 21st Century, the mainstream American comics companies moved almost exclusively to in-house computer lettering, effectively ending the era of the freelance letterer. Chris Eliopoulos designed the fonts for Marvel's in-house lettering unit, and Ken Lopez did the same at DC. Since then the trend has swung the other way, with most comics publishers once again using freelance letterers rather than in-house staff. Nearly all use computer and digital comic book fonts.\n\nThe traditional comic book letterer needs little more than a lettering guide, a pen or brush, India ink, and white paint for corrections. Some situations required the letterer to use vellum overlays on top of the original art.\n\nThe lettering in the comics of the sensationalist horror comics publisher EC Comics c. 1945–c. 1955 was different from other publishers — its mechanical appearance gave it a sterile aspect, and helped define the particular style of comics EC was known for. EC's letterers achieved their particular look by using a Leroy lettering set, a device popular amongst draftsmen and architects. The Leroy lettering set consisted of a stylus and a pantographic lettering form.\n\nMost Marvel and DC books are now lettered using a graphics program such as Adobe Illustrator or Adobe Photoshop, and a font that resembles hand lettering. Computer lettering provides a lot of technical shortcuts, especially by combining the lettering work directly with digital art files, eliminating the tedious physical paste-up stage altogether.\n\nThere are also still comics artists and inkers who prefer to have the lettering directly on their pages. First, it saves drawing time (not having to put art where a big caption will be); and second, comics tell a story, and a page of comics art without the lettering is only half the story.\n\nLong-time letterer John Workman toes a middle ground between traditional and digital lettering. In addition to his \"on-the-art boards work,\" Workman has been electronically hand-lettering by way of a Wacom tablet.\n\nBoth the Eisner Awards and the Harvey Awards feature a \"best letterer\" category. (The Shazam Awards also had a \"best letterer\" category until the Awards' demise in 1975.) Since the creation of the Eisner and Harvey lettering awards (in 1993 and 1992, respectively), Todd Klein has dominated the Eisner, winning fifteen times, and has come away with the Harvey eight times. Other repeat Harvey Award winners include Ken Bruzenak, Chris Ware, John Workman, and Dan Clowes.\n\nCartoonists known for the lettering on their own comics:\nCompanies that provide computer lettering:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7380120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7380120", "title": "Leverian collection", "text": "Leverian collection\n\nThe Leverian collection was a natural history and ethnographic collection assembled by Ashton Lever. It was noted in particular for the content it acquired from the voyages of Captain James Cook. For three decades it was on display in London, being broken up by auction in 1806.\n\nThe first public location of the collection was the Holophusikon (or Holophusicon), also known as the Leverian Museum, at Leicester House, on Leicester Square in London, England, from 1775 to 1786. After it passed from Lever's ownership, it was displayed for nearly 20 years more near the south end of Blackfriars Bridge. When there it was often known as the Museum Leverianum.\n\nLever collected fossils, shells, and animals (birds, insects, reptiles, fish, monkeys) for many years, accumulating a large collection at his home at Alkrington, near Manchester. He was swamped with visitors, whom he allowed to view his collection for free, so much so that he had to insist that visitors that arrived on foot would not be admitted. He decided to exhibit the collection in London as a commercial venture, charging an entrance fee.\n\nLever acquired a lease of Leicester House in 1774, converting the principal rooms on the first floor into a single large gallery running the length of the house, and opened his museum in February 1775, with around 25,000 exhibits (a small fraction of his collection) valued at over £40,000. The display included many natural and ethnographic items gathered by Captain James Cook on his voyages. The museum took its name from its supposedly universal coverage of natural history, and was essentially a huge cabinet of curiosities.\n\nLever charged an entry fee of 5s. 3d., or two guineas for an annual ticket, and the museum had a degree of commercial success; the receipts in 1782 were £2,253. In an effort to draw in the crowds, Lever later reduced the entrance fee to half a crown (2s. 6d.) and was constantly looking for new exhibits. He also set out his exhibits to impress the visitor, as well as (unusually) including educational information. However, he spent more on new exhibits than he raised in entrance fees.\n\nOne admirer of the museum was Philip Bury Duncan as a boy: he went on to become keeper of the Ashmolean Museum. Among the objects displayed was the large Viking silver thistle brooch from the Penrith Hoard, discovered by a boy in Cumbria in 1785. In 1787, a print of it was published, claiming that it was the insignia of the Knights Templar. It was bought by the British Museum in 1909 (M&ME 1909,6-24,2).\n\nThe British Museum and Catherine II of Russia both refused to buy the collection, so Lever obtained an Act of Parliament in 1784 to sell the whole by lottery. He only sold 8,000 tickets at a guinea each - he had hoped to sell 36,000.\n\nThe collection was acquired by James Parkinson, a land agent and accountant. It continued to be displayed at Leicester House until Lever's death in 1788, at a reduced entrance fee of one shilling.\n\nParkinson transferred the Leverian collection to a purpose-built Rotunda building, at what would later be No. 3 Blackfriars Road. Leicester House itself was demolished in 1791.\n\nA catalogue and guide was printed in 1790. Parkinson also had George Shaw write an illustrated scientific work; the artists involved included Philip Reinagle, Charles Reuben Ryley, William Skelton, Sarah Stone, and Sydenham Edwards. Some of John White's specimens were put on public display there for the first time. The museum also served as a resource and opportunity for women: Ellenor Fenn wrote \"A Short History of Insects\" (1796/7), for which the long title concludes as \"a pocket companion to those who visit the Leverian Museum\", and a similar volume on quadrupeds; the artist Sarah Stone continued to work for Parkinson, as she had done for Lever.\n\nParkinson had some success in getting naturalists to attend the museum, which was easier at the time to visit than the British Museum. A visitor in 1799, Heinrich Friedrich Link, was complimentary.\n\nParkinson also tried to sell the contents at various times. One attempt, a proposed purchase by the government, was wrecked by the adverse opinion of Sir Joseph Banks. In the end, for financial reasons, Parkinson sold the collection in lots by auction in 1806. Among the buyers were Edward Donovan, Edward Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby, and William Bullock; many items went to other museums, including the Imperial Museum of Vienna.\n\nThe contents of the museum are well recorded, from a catalogue of the museum created in 1784, and the sale catalogue in 1806, with a contemporary series of watercolours of its contents by Sarah Stone. There are also sale catalogue annotations allowing, for example, the counting of 37 lots bought by Alexander Macleay. The Royal College of Surgeons bought 79 lots, and notes by William Clift survive. Purchases from the sale founded the collection of Richard Cuming. In all 7,879 lots were sold over 65 days.\n"}

{"id": "81361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=81361", "title": "Mario", "text": "Mario\n\nWith more than 500 million units sold worldwide, the overall \"Mario\" franchise is the best-selling video game franchise of all time. Outside of the \"Super Mario\" platform series, other \"Mario\" genres include the \"Mario Kart\" racing series, sports games such as the \"Mario Tennis\" and \"Mario Golf\" series, role-playing games such as \"Mario & Luigi\", \"Super Mario RPG\" and \"Paper Mario\", and educational games such as \"Mario Is Missing!\", \"Mario's Time Machine\" and \"Mario Teaches Typing\". The franchise has branched into several media, including television shows, film, comics, and licensed merchandise. Since 1990, Mario has been voiced by Charles Martinet.\n\nShigeru Miyamoto created Mario while developing \"Donkey Kong\" in an attempt to produce a best-selling video game for Nintendo; previous titles like \"Sheriff\" had not achieved the same success as titles like \"Pac-Man\". Originally, Miyamoto wanted to create a video game that used the characters Popeye, Bluto, and Olive Oyl. At the time, however, Miyamoto was unable to acquire a license to use the characters (and would not until 1982 with \"Popeye\"), so he ended up making an unnamed player character, Donkey Kong, and Lady (later known as Pauline). In the early stages of \"Donkey Kong\", Mario was unable to jump, and the focus was to escape a maze. However, Miyamoto enabled Mario to jump, saying \"If you had a barrel rolling towards you, what would you do?\"\n\nWhile the protagonist was unnamed in the Japanese release, he would be named Jumpman in the game's English instructions and Mario in the sales brochure. Miyamoto originally named the character \"Mr. Video\", and he was to be used in every video game Miyamoto developed. According to a widely circulated story, during localization of \"Donkey Kong\" for American audiences, Nintendo of America's warehouse landlord Mario Segale confronted then-president Minoru Arakawa, demanding back rent. Following a heated argument in which the Nintendo employees eventually convinced Segale he would be paid, they opted to name the character in the game Mario after him.\n\nMiyamoto commented that if he had named Mario \"Mr. Video\", Mario likely would have \"disappeared off the face of the Earth\". By Miyamoto's own account, Mario's profession was chosen to fit with the game design. Since \"Donkey Kong\" was set on a construction site, Mario was made into a carpenter. When he appeared again in \"Mario Bros.\", it was decided he should be a plumber, since a lot of the game is played in underground settings. Mario's character design, particularly his large nose, draws on western influences; once he became a plumber, Miyamoto decided to \"put him in New York\" and make him Italian, lightheartedly attributing Mario's nationality to his mustache. Other sources have Mario's profession chosen to be carpenter in an effort to depict the character as an ordinary hard worker, and make it easier for players to identify with him. After a colleague suggested that Mario more closely resembled a plumber, Miyamoto changed Mario's profession accordingly and developed \"Mario Bros.\", featuring the character in the sewers of New York City.\n\nDue to the graphical limitations of arcade hardware at the time, Miyamoto clothed the character in red overalls and a blue shirt to contrast against each other and the background. A red cap was added to let Miyamoto avoid drawing the character's hairstyle, forehead, and eyebrows, as well as to circumvent the issue of animating his hair as he jumped. To give distinctly human facial features on an 8×8 pixel head, Miyamoto drew a large nose and a mustache, which avoided the need to draw a mouth and facial expressions.\n\nMiyamoto envisioned a \"go to\" character that could be put into any game as needed, albeit in cameo appearances, as at the time Miyamoto was not expecting the character to become singularly popular. To this end, he originally called the character \"Mr. Video\", comparing his intent for appearances in later games to the cameos that Alfred Hitchcock had done within his films. Over time, Mario's appearance has become more defined; blue eyes, white gloves, brown shoes, a red \"M\" in a white circle on the front of his hat and gold buttons on his overalls have been added. The colors of his shirt and overalls were also reversed from a blue shirt with red overalls to a red shirt with blue overalls. Miyamoto attributed this process to the different development teams and artists for each game as well as advances in technology.\n\nNintendo did not initially reveal Mario's full name. In a 1989 interview, his full name was stated not to be \"Mario Mario\" though it may be inferred from the title of the \"Mario Bros.\" series. The first notable use of \"Mario Mario\" is in the 1993 live-action film adaptation. This was again used in two of Prima's official strategy guides, in 2000 for \"Mario Party 2\" and in 2003 for \"\". In 2012 after Charles Martinet voiced Mario declaring himself \"Mario Mario\" at the San Diego Comic-Con the next month Satoru Iwata said he had no last name, which Shigeru Miyamoto agreed with the month after. Two months after Iwata's death in July 2015, Miyamoto changed his stance September 2015 at the Super Mario Bros. 30th Anniversary festival, asserting that his name was indeed Mario Mario.\n\nMario debuted as \"Jumpman\" in the arcade game \"Donkey Kong\" on July 9, 1981. He is shown to be a carpenter and has a pet ape called Donkey Kong. The carpenter mistreats the ape and Donkey Kong escapes to kidnap Jumpman's girlfriend, originally known as the Lady, but later named Pauline. The player must take the role of Jumpman and rescue the girl.\n\nJumpman was later renamed \"Mario\" in the 1982 arcade game \"Donkey Kong Junior\", the only game in which he has been portrayed as an antagonist. In the 1983 arcade game \"Mario Bros.\", Mario and his younger brother Luigi are portrayed as Italian-American plumbers who have to defeat creatures that have been coming from the sewers below New York City.\n\nIn \"Super Mario Bros.\" for the Nintendo Entertainment System, Mario saves Princess Toadstool (later known as Princess Peach) of the Mushroom Kingdom from King Koopa. To save Princess Toadstool, Mario conquers the eight worlds of the Mushroom Kingdom by going to the castle in each to defeat a minion of King Koopa. To reach each castle, Mario battles through three sub-worlds by defeating King Koopa's henchmen. If Mario successfully fights his way through the castle and defeats the minion, he frees a Mushroom Retainer. Inside the eighth castle, Mario has a final fight with King Koopa and frees Princess Toadstool. In \"Super Mario Bros. 2\", the player can choose between Mario, Luigi, Toad, or Princess Peach. Each character possesses unique abilities (Luigi has stronger jumping ability, Toad can dig the fastest, and Peach can float), with Mario being the most well-rounded. In \"Super Mario Bros. 3\", Mario quests to save the rulers of seven kingdoms from Bowser and his children, the Koopalings, and Mario travels across eight worlds to restore order to the Mushroom World and to rescue Princess Peach. Mario is introduced to new power-ups that augment his abilities.\n\nIn \"Super Mario Land\", an alien named Tatanga appears, hypnotizes the inhabitants of an area called Sarasaland, and kidnaps its ruler, Princess Daisy. Mario sets out to rescue her, traveling through the four geographical areas of Sarasaland and defeating Tatanga's minions along the way. He corners Tatanga in the skies of the Chai kingdom, bringing down the alien warship and rescuing Daisy. In \"Super Mario World\", Mario and Luigi take Princess Peach for a vacation in Dinosaur World sometime after the events of \"Super Mario Bros. 3\"; during the vacation, Peach is kidnapped by Bowser. Mario and Luigi meet the Yoshis, dinosaurs that live in Dinosaur World, and they help rescue Peach by allowing Mario and Luigi to ride them. In \"\", whose events take place immediately after the original \"Super Mario Land\", Mario's evil counterpart Wario has put an evil spell over Mario Land while Mario was away in Sarasaland, renaming the area Wario Land. The inhabitants are brainwashed into thinking that Wario is their master and Mario is their enemy. Wario's motive behind this sudden attack was to take control over Mario's castle in order to have one of his own. To stop Wario, Mario finds the 6 Golden Coins throughout Mario Land and regains access to his castle. In \"\", a stork carries Baby Mario and Baby Luigi across the sea, but the evil Magikoopa Kamek steals Baby Luigi, and Baby Mario falls onto an island called Yoshi's Island, home to Yoshis. After Mario meets the Yoshis, the group journeys through the game's six worlds to rescue Baby Luigi and the stork from Baby Bowser and Kamek.\n\nMario made his 3D debut in \"Super Mario 64\" for the Nintendo 64. Princess Peach sends Mario a letter inviting him to join her at her castle for cake; however, when he arrives, Mario discovers that Bowser has invaded the castle and imprisoned the princess and her servants within it using the castle's 120 Power Stars. Many of the castle's paintings are portals to other worlds, in which Bowser's minions guard the stars. Mario explores the castle and other worlds to recover the stars. He gains access to more painting portals as he recovers more stars, and he traverses three obstacle courses that lead him to battles with Bowser. Defeating Bowser the first two times earns Mario keys that open new levels of the castle, while the final battle releases Peach, who rewards Mario by baking the cake that she promised him.\n\nIn \"Super Mario Sunshine\", Mario, Toadsworth, and Princess Peach take a vacation to Isle Delfino, a tropical island. A person resembling Mario, known as \"Shadow Mario\", vandalizes and pollutes the entire island using a magic paintbrush. The vandalism has caused the Shine Sprites to flee from the island's main city, Delfino Plaza, and blanket the island in darkness. Blamed for the mess, Mario is arrested by the island authorities and ordered to clean up Isle Delfino. Mario is equipped with FLUDD, a robotic hosing device invented by Professor E. Gadd, which he uses to clean up the pollution and collect the Shine Sprites. Meanwhile, Peach is kidnapped by Shadow Mario, who reveals himself to be Bowser Jr., one of Bowser's children, having stolen the paintbrush from Professor E. Gadd. Mario eventually confronts Bowser and Bowser Jr. and rescues the princess. With the island cleaned up, Mario and Peach begin their vacation.\n\nMario went to 2.5D in \"New Super Mario Bros.\" While Mario and Peach take a walk together through the Mushroom Kingdom, Bowser Jr. kidnaps Peach and flees. Mario gives chase, venturing through eight worlds. Mario eventually catches up, defeating both Bowser and Bowser Jr. and rescuing Peach. In \"Super Mario Galaxy\", Mario is invited by Princess Peach to the centennial Star Festival in the Mushroom Kingdom. Upon arrival, Bowser invades the kingdom and rips Peach's castle from its foundations and lifts it into outer space. After failing to prevent the princess from being kidnapped, Mario meets star-like creatures called Lumas and their companion, Rosalina. Rosalina tells Mario that Bowser has stolen the Power Stars, the source of power for Rosalina's mobile observatory, and has taken Peach to the center of the universe. Mario then travels to various galaxies to reclaim the Power Stars to restore power to the observatory and reclaim Princess Peach. In \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\", another 2.5D game, Mario, Luigi, and two Toads are attending Princess Peach's birthday party when Bowser Jr. and the other seven Koopalings ambush the princess and kidnap her. Mario, Luigi, and the two Toads chase after them across eight worlds, defeating each Koopaling as they progress. The quartet eventually confronts Bowser, defeating him and saving the princess. In \"Super Mario Galaxy 2\", Bowser, who has transformed himself into a giant using the Power Stars, attacks the Mushroom Kingdom and abducts Peach, taking her to the center of the universe. With the help of the Lumas, Mario pilots Starship Mario, a mobile planet in the shape of his head, in order to travel to various galaxies and gather the Power Stars, used to fuel the ship. After multiple battles against both Bowser and Bowser Jr., Mario eventually arrives at Bowser's lair at the center of the universe, where he defeats him and rescues the princess. In 2012, Mario returned in \"New Super Mario Bros. 2\" where he collects several coins scattered across the Mushroom Kingdom in addition to saving Princess Peach from the evil clutches of Bowser and the Koopalings. Mario returns to defeat Bowser and his minions in \"New Super Mario Bros. U\". Mario is one of the playable characters in \"Super Mario 3D World\", where he has average running speed and jump height compared to other characters. Mario is the protagonist of the Nintendo Switch game \"Super Mario Odyssey\", where the character Cappy replaces Mario's traditional hat, allowing Mario to throw it like a long-range weapon, and \"capture\" enemies to gain their abilities.\n\n\"Mario\" games of other genres include various \"Game & Watch\" games; \"Mario Pinball Land\", a pinball game for the Game Boy Advance; various educational games; and the \"Dr. Mario\" puzzle video game, (with \"Dr. Mario\" itself first released in 1990). In these games, Dr. Mario throws vitamins that the player must align to destroy the viruses that populate the playing field. 1996's \"Super Mario RPG\" is the first \"Mario\" role-playing game; ten games have followed, including five in the \"Paper Mario\" series (\"Paper Mario\" for the Nintendo 64, \"\" for the GameCube, \"Super Paper Mario\" for the Wii, \"\" for the Nintendo 3DS, and \"\" for the Wii U) and six in the \"Mario & Luigi\" series (\"\" for the Game Boy Advance, \"\" and \"\" for the Nintendo DS, \"\", \"\", and for the Nintendo 3DS).\n\nSeveral other sub-series of \"Mario\" video games, especially those inspired from sports, have been released. The \"Mario Kart\" franchise, which began with \"Super Mario Kart\" for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992, is the most successful and longest-running kart racing franchise. Other \"Mario\" sports games include the Camelot-developed series \"Mario Golf\" and \"Mario Tennis\", and, respectively, the baseball and soccer games \"Mario Superstar Baseball\" and \"Super Mario Strikers\". In 1999, Hudson Soft developed the \"Mario Party\" series, which began on the Nintendo 64. The games revolve around a set of minigames and are playable with up to four players. \"Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games\", released for both Nintendo DS and Wii, is a collection of 24 events based on the 2008 Summer Olympic Games from Beijing, in which characters from Sega's \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" series compete with \"Mario\" characters. This was followed in 2009 by \"Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games\" on both systems, based on the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Two more sports games for the Wii were released in 2011, \"Mario Sports Mix\" and the third \"Mario & Sonic\" game, \"Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games\" while the latter was released for the Nintendo 3DS in February 2012, which is based on the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. The fourth edition of the \"Mario & Sonic\" series for the Wii U is called \"Mario & Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games\", which is based on the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. A fifth title, \"Mario & Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games\", which is based on the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, was released in 2016 for the Nintendo 3DS, Wii U and Arcade.\n\nApart from his platformer and spin-off game appearances, Mario has made guest appearances in non-\"Mario\" games, such as \"Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!\", where Mario is a referee. Mario appears as a playable character in \"NBA Street V3\" and \"SSX on Tour\". He makes countless cameo appearances in many forms in many games, such as portraits and statues in \"\", \"\", and \"\".\n\nThe first appearance of Mario in other media than games was \"Saturday Supercade\", an animated television series produced by Ruby-Spears Productions in 1983. Each episode was composed of several shorter segments featuring video game characters from the golden age of video arcade games. Mario (voiced by Peter Cullen) appeared in Donkey Kong segments where he and Pauline would try to recapture Donkey Kong.\n\nMario stars in \"The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!\", played by \"Captain\" Lou Albano.\n\nMario stars in \"The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3\" and \"Super Mario World\", voiced by Walker Boone.\n\nMario appears in the live-action film \"Super Mario Bros.\" as played by Bob Hoskins. Mario finds himself in an alternate universe in which dinosaurs rule where he must save the Earth from invasion. The film was a commercial failure at the box office.\n\nOutside the original games, television shows, and film, Mario has influenced the creation of a line of licensed merchandise and has appeared in popular culture. The Nintendo Comics System series, along with the Nintendo Adventure Books, were created due to Mario as well.\n\nMario will appear at Universal Studios Japan in Osaka in the upcoming section of Super Nintendo World, which is scheduled to open in 2020 in time of the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. One of the rides will be themed to \"Mario Kart\". Universal Parks & Resorts also has plans to import Super Nintendo World to Universal Studios Hollywood in Los Angeles, California and Universal Orlando Resort in Orlando, Florida.\n\nMario is depicted as a portly plumber who lives in the fictional land of the Mushroom Kingdom with Luigi, his younger, taller brother. In the television series and film, Mario and Luigi are originally from Brooklyn, New York. Little is known of Mario's childhood, though the infant version of Mario, Baby Mario, first appeared in 1995 in \"\", and has often appeared in Nintendo sports games since then. Baby Mario has a major role along with Baby Luigi in \"\" and appears in \"Yoshi's Island DS\". He, along with the adult Mario, is voiced by Charles Martinet. He wears a longsleeved red shirt, a pair of blue overalls with yellow buttons, brown shoes, white gloves and a red cap with a red \"M\" printed on a white circle. In \"Donkey Kong\", he wore a pair of red overalls, and a blue shirt. In \"Super Mario Bros.\", he wore a brown shirt with red overalls. He has blue eyes, and, like Luigi, has brown hair, and a dark brown or black mustache. This consistent difference in color is attributed to being a relic from designing the characters for their original platforms, wherein certain features were actively distinguished while others had to be curtailed due to technical limitations. In a 2005 interview, Miyamoto stated that Mario's physical age was about 24-25 years old.\n\nMario's occupation is plumbing, though in the original \"Donkey Kong\" games he is a carpenter. Mario has had several other occupations: in the \"Dr. Mario\" series of puzzle games, which debuted in 1990, Mario is portrayed as a medical physician named \"Dr. Mario\"; in the Game Boy game \"Mario's Picross\", Mario is an archaeologist; and in \"\", Mario is the president of a profitable toy-making company. Mario is an athlete in various \"Mario\" sports titles including \"Mario Sports Mix\", \"Mario Strikers Charged\", and \"Mario Tennis Aces\"; as well as a kart racer in the \"Mario Kart\" series. Mario usually saves Princess Peach and the Mushroom Kingdom and purges antagonists, such as Bowser, from various areas. Mario has gained fame in the Mushroom Kingdom due to his heroic deeds, as shown in \"\", where the brothers are referred to as \"superstars\". In September 2017, Nintendo confirmed on their official Japanese profile for the character that Mario was no longer considered a plumber, most likely due to his various occupations and hobbies. However as of March 2018, the Japanese profile has since been changed to state that Mario's occupation is still a plumber.\n\nSince his first game, Mario has usually had the role of saving the damsel in distress. Originally, he had to rescue his girlfriend Pauline in \"Donkey Kong\" from Donkey Kong. Pauline was soon replaced by a new damsel in distress, Princess Peach, in \"Super Mario Bros.\", but returned in the Game Boy remake of \"Donkey Kong\" in 1994, and in \"\" in 2006, although the character is now described as \"Mario's friend\". Mario has rescued Princess Peach multiple times since \"Super Mario Bros.\" In a role reversal, Peach rescues Mario in \"Super Princess Peach\". Mario rescued Princess Daisy of Sarasaraland in \"Super Mario Land\", but Luigi seems to be more linked to her. In \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", the text explaining Daisy's trophy states that \"after her appearance in \"Mario Golf\", gossips portrayed her as Luigi's answer to Mario's Peach\".\n\nLuigi is Mario's younger fraternal twin brother. He is a companion in the \"Mario\" games, and the character whom the second player controls in two-player sessions of many of the video games, though he occasionally rescues Mario, as seen in \"Mario Is Missing!\" and \"Luigi's Mansion\". \"\" for the Game Boy saw the arrival of Wario, Mario's greedy counterpart, who is often Mario's antagonist or an antihero. Yoshi is a dinosaur whose species is also named Yoshi. They vary in color, though the original Yoshi is green. Yoshi serves as Mario's steed in games such as \"Super Mario World\", and is depicted as an independent character in games like \"Super Mario Kart\" and \"\".\n\nDuring the development of \"Donkey Kong\", Mario was known as \"Jumpman\". Jumping—both to access places and as an offensive move—is a common gameplay element in \"Mario\" games, especially the \"Super Mario\" series. By the time \"Super Mario RPG\" was released, jumping became such a signature act of Mario that the player was often tasked with jumping to prove to non-player characters that he was Mario. Mario's most commonly portrayed form of attack is jumping to stomp on the heads of enemies, first used in \"Super Mario Bros.\" This jump-stomp move may entirely crush smaller enemies on the stage, and usually deals damage to larger ones, sometimes causing secondary effects. This attack often enables Mario to knock the turtle-like Koopa Troopas into or out of their shells, which can be used as weapons. Subsequent games have elaborated on Mario's jumping-related abilities. \"Super Mario World\" added the ability to spin-jump, which allows Mario to break blocks beneath him. The Game Boy version of \"Donkey Kong\" allows Mario to jump higher with consecutive jumps, and perform a back-flip. In \"Super Mario 64\", Mario gains new jumping abilities such as a sideways somersault; a ground pound, which is a high-impact downward thrusting motion; and the \"Wall Kick\", which propels him upwards by kicking off walls.\n\nMario uses items, which give him various powers, and differ between the games he is in. The first power-up Mario used was the Hammer in \"Donkey Kong\".\n\n\"Super Mario Bros.\" introduced the basic three power-ups that have become staples for the series, especially the 2D games — the Super Mushroom, which causes Mario to grow larger; the Fire Flower, which allows Mario to throw fireballs; and the Starman, which gives Mario temporary invincibility. These powers have appeared regularly throughout the series. Throughout the series' history, there have been several kinds of Mushroom power-ups, including the 1-up Mushroom, which gives Mario an extra life; the Poison Mushroom, which causes Mario to either shrink or die; the Mega Mushroom, which causes Mario to grow very large; and the Mini Mushroom, which causes Mario to shrink.\n\nA reoccurring power-up throughout the series is an item that gives Mario the ability of flight. The first of this type was introduced in \"Super Mario Bros. 3\": one power-up, which gives Mario a raccoon suit, is called the Super Leaf, while another is called the Tanooki Suit (a transliteration of tanuki) and grants Mario the ability to fly or turn into a statue. In \"Super Mario World\", an item called the Cape Feather was introduced that gave Mario a cape. In \"\", a carrot was available that gave Mario rabbit ears that allowed him to fly, and in \"Super Mario 64\", Mario could acquire an item called the Wing Cap, which temporarily gave him the ability of flight. \"Super Mario Sunshine\" introduces a pump-water spraying device named \"F.L.U.D.D.\", which abilities included spraying water and hovering.\n\n\"Super Mario Galaxy\" introduced new power-ups, including the Bee Mushroom, which turned Mario into a bee and allowed him to fly temporarily; the Boo Mushroom, which turned Mario into a ghost, allowing him to float and pass through walls; the Spring Mushroom, which encased Mario in a spring, allowing him to jump higher; and the Ice Flower, which allowed the player to temporarily walk on water and lava without sinking or taking damage. \"Super Mario Galaxy 2\" introduced more power ups, including the Cloud Flower which allows Mario to create platforms in midair and Rock Mario, which transforms Mario into a boulder that could be used to break through barriers.\n\n\"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" updated the Ice Flower, which allows Mario to shoot ice balls that temporally freeze enemies; and introduced the Propeller Mushroom, which allows him to fly; as well as the Penguin Suit, which allows Mario to easily traverse ice and swim through water in addition to shooting ice balls. \"Super Mario 3D Land\" introduced the Boomerang Flower, which allows Mario to throw boomerangs at nearby enemies; and the Statue Leaf, which allows Mario to turn to a statue. In \"New Super Mario Bros. U\", a Super Acorn makes its debut. This transforms Mario to his new Flying squirrel form where he can glide and stick on walls. \"Super Mario 3D World\" introduced the Super Bell, which transforms Mario into his cat form as well as a Double Cherry to make multiple copies of himself.\n\nAs Nintendo's primary mascot, Mario is widely considered to be the most famous video game character in history, and has been called an icon of the gaming industry. The \"Mario\" series of video games has sold more than 510 million copies, making it the best-selling video game franchise. Mario was one of the first video game character inductees at the Walk of Game in 2005, alongside Link and Sonic the Hedgehog. Mario was the first video game character to be honored with a wax figure in the Hollywood Wax Museum in 2003. In the 1990s, a national survey found that Mario was more recognizable to American children than Mickey Mouse. Mario has also been called the \"most recognisable\" figure in the gaming industry.\n\nCreator Shigeru Miyamoto has stated that Mario is his favorite out of all characters that he has created. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave Mario their \"Coolest Mascot\" award for 1996, calling him \"an age-old friend.\" \"Nintendo Power\" listed Mario as their favorite hero, citing his defining characteristics as his mustache, red cap, plumbing prowess, and his mushrooms. In a poll conducted in 2008 by Oricon, Mario was voted the most popular video game character in Japan. GameDaily listed the \"unlikely hero\" on its top 25 video game archetypes, and used Mario as an example of this. It stated that in spite of the fact that he should have run out of energy through the first level, he kept going. Mario ranked fourth on GameDaily's top ten \"Smash Bros.\" characters list. Mario was fourth on UGO's list of the \"Top 100 Heroes of All Time\". They also listed Mario's hat twenty-first on their list of \"The Coolest Helmets and Headgear in Video Games\", stating \"there's always somebody at your Halloween party wearing one.\" CNET listed him first on its list of the \"Top 5 video game characters\". He was voted 100th in IGN's Top 100 Villains for his appearance in \"Donkey Kong Junior\", adding \"This Mario is a total jerk, holding Donkey Kong Jr.'s dad hostage\", and he has also been elected by GamesRadar as the 90th \"most dastardly ne'er-do-wells\" villain in video games in their \"top 100\".\n\nMario has been established as a pop culture icon, and has starred in numerous television shows, comic books, and in a feature film. He has appeared on lunch boxes, T-shirts, magazines, commercials (notably, in a Got Milk? commercial), in candy form, on shampoo bottles, cereal, badges, board games, and as a plush toy. Nintendo produced a 60-minute anime film based on the original \"Super Mario Bros.\" titled \"\" in 1986, although this film has not been released outside Japan and has not been released on any home video format except VHS. The animated series \"The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!\" featured a live-action series of skits which starred former WWF manager \"Captain\" Lou Albano as Mario and Danny Wells as Luigi. Mario appeared in a book series, the Nintendo Adventure Books. Mario has inspired unlicensed paintings, performances on talent shows such as \"India's Got Talent\", and short films, which have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. The character has been present in a number of works created by third parties other than Nintendo, such as in the iOS and Android video game \"Platform Panic\", in which one of the purchasable skins is a reference to him.\n\nMany people and places have been named or nicknamed after Mario. Bergsala, the distributor of Nintendo's products in the Nordic and the Baltic countries, is located at Marios Gata 21 (Mario's Street 21) in Kungsbacka, Sweden, named after Mario. Many sports stars, including Bundesliga football players Mario Götze and Mario Gómez, National Hockey League player Mario Lemieux, Italian footballer Mario Balotelli, and Italian cyclist Mario Cipollini have been given the nickname \"Super Mario\". In a suburb of the Spanish city of Zaragoza, streets were named after video games, including \"Avenida de Super Mario Bros\".\n\nMario's legacy is recognized by Guinness World Records, who awarded the Nintendo mascot, and the series of platform games he has appeared in, seven world records in the \"Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008\". These records include \"Best Selling Video Game Series of All Time\", \"First Movie Based on an Existing Video Game\", and \"Most Prolific Video Game Character\", with Mario appearing in 116 distinct titles (not including remakes or re-releases).\n\nMario appeared in the 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony to promote the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. In a pre-recorded video, the prime minister Shinzō Abe became Mario to use a Warp pipe planted by Doraemon from Shibuya Crossing to Maracanã Stadium. Abe then appeared dressed as Mario in an oversized Warp Pipe in the middle of the stadium.\n\nMario Day (previously known as National Mario Day) is celebrated on March 10, as when that date is presented as Mar 10 it resembles the name MARIO. Since 2016, the day was officially observed by Nintendo, and celebrates this day annually by promoting \"Mario\" games and holding \"Mario\"-related events.\n\n"}
{"id": "15860851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15860851", "title": "Media of Bulgaria", "text": "Media of Bulgaria\n\nThe media of Bulgaria refers to mass media outlets based in Bulgaria. Television, magazines, and newspapers are all operated by both state-owned and for-profit corporations which depend on advertising, subscription, and other sales-related revenues. The Constitution of Bulgaria guarantees freedom of speech.\nAs a country in transition, Bulgaria's media system is under transformation.\n\nBulgaria's media are generally deemed unbiased, although the state still dominates the field through the Bulgarian National Television (BNT), the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR), and the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency. Bulgarian media have a record of unbiased reporting, although they are deemed potentially at risk of political influence due to the lack of legislation to protect them. The written media have no legal restrictions and newspaper publishing is entirely liberal. The extensive freedom of the press means that no exact number of publications can be established, although some research put an estimate of around 900 print media outlets for 2006. The largest-circulation daily newspapers include \"Dneven Trud\" and \"24 Chasa\".\n\nNon-printed media sources, such as television and radio, are overseen by the Council for Electronic Media (CEM), an independent body with the authority to issue broadcasting licenses. Apart from a state-operated national television channel, radio station and the Bulgarian News Agency, a large number of private television and radio stations exist. However, most Bulgarian media experience a number of negative trends, such as general degradation of media products, self-censorship and economic or political pressure. \"Slavi's Show\" and \"Gospodari Na Efira\" are among the most popular TV programs, both having more than 1,000,000 views per show.\n\nInternet media are growing in popularity due to the wide range of available opinions and viewpoints, lack of censorship and diverse content.\nThe main legislative base is the 1998 Radio and Television Act, amended several times since. Many issues still persist in the field\nThe EU 2007 Audiovisual Media Services Directive was transposed in Bulgarian law in 2010, including the requirements for cultural diversity.\n\nDefamation in Bulgaria is decriminalised but punishable with large fines. Government officials have filed suits against journalists in the past, though courts tend to favour the latter and preserve press freedom.\nLegislation on access to information is fairly robust, although institutions may still improperly deny access and courts may act inconsistently on the issue.\nMedia concentration is an issue and ownership transparency is lacking. A law was adopted in 2014 to restrict media ownership from offshore tax haven-based companies.\n\nJournalists in Bulgaria work on decreasing salaries and face job insecurity, making work conditions more and more conducive to self-censorship and unethical practices.\n\nViolation of ethical and professional standards is often reported, particularly in the print press.\nCodes of Conduct for journalists have been drafted by several media and professional organizations after 1989, including the Union of Bulgarian Journalists, the Free Speech Forum and the Centre for Independent Journalism. In 2004 an Ethical Code of Bulgarian Media was drafted with support from EU experts, though it was rejected by part of the Bulgarian journalist scene.\n\nThe Ethics Committee for the Print Media and the Ethics Committee for the Electronic Media were established in late 2005 after long debate, institutionalising mechanisms of self-regulation in the Bulgarian media sector.\n\nThe New Bulgarian Media Group (NBMG), owned by Irina Krasteva and controlled by her son and MP Delyan Peevski has a long history of cross-partisan pro-governmental bias. In June 2014, a spat between Peevski and a bank owner spurred negative report on NBMG media that caused a bank run and forced the financial institute to temporarily close down.\n\nThe 2014 European elections and parliamentary elections were closely followed by the media, but a large portion of the coverage consisted in unlabelled paid partisan content. Right-wing-affiliated print and broadcast media often carry hate speech against minorities and migrants.\n\nThe Bulgarian media panorama is pluralistic, although media outlets remain influenced by the political and economic interests of their owners and main advertisers. The shrinking advertising market has made the media more and more dependent on state advertising and other subsidies, in particular for small local media outlets.\n\nFreedom of expression and free competition in the media market were introduced in Bulgaria after 1989. Newspaper publishing is not regulated by law, and no audit office or official record of the number of publications exist. Over 900 print media titles were estimated in 2007, but their number is today greatly reduced after the effects of the economic crisis. The nationally distributed dailies were 14 in 2009; circulation per capita is very low.\n\nPeevski's New Bulgarian Media Group (NBMG) and the competitor Media Group Bulgaria Holding own most of the private newspapers.\n\nThe dominant form on the market is that of \"hybrid tabloids\", combining both quality press and tabloid features, including scandalous reporting, such as the dailies \"Trud\" and \"24 Chasa\", published by the German WAZ-Mediengruppe). The convergence is due to the failure in establishing quality broadsheets newspapers, leading instead popular dailies to extend their reach and occupy their niche. Other widely distributed newspapers include \"Standart\", Novinar, \"Express\", \"Monitor\", and \"Telegraph\" - the latter being the only one to increase its circulation during the crisis, due to a lower price. \"Dnevnik\" is deemed the most trustworthy on business and economy, but has a low circulation, together with \"Pari\", edited by the Swedish Bonnier Group. Political newspapers include \"Douma\", of the Bulgarian Socialist Party, and \"Ataka\" (lit. \"Attack\"), of the homonymous nationalist party.\n\nTo complement revenues from sales and advertisement, which most often do not arrive at coverning production costs, Bulgarian newspapers rely on contributions from business circles and political parties, hence opening up to avenues for political and commercial influences.\n\nThe regional print press include 10 dailies in the main towns of the country, as well as local publications coming out from once to three times per week.\n\nWeeklies include the business-oriented \"Kapital\" and \"Banker\", and the popular 168 Chassa and Politika, together with the specialised Kultura. Yellow weeklies (\"Show\", \"Weekend\", \"Galeria\") have recently entered the market. Magazines included around 100 titled in late 2009, including \"Tema\" and \"Praven Svyat\".\n\nThe Bulgarian print press market was totally dominated by the German WAZ group from 1996 onwards, both at national and local level. \nIn December 2010 WAZ Mediagroup sold all its assets in Bulgaria to a joint venture between Austrian investors and local tycoons. Until then the company had owned the two largest daily newspapers Trud and 24 hours, the weekly newspaper 168 hours, and a large portfolio of magazines.\n\nThe \"New Bulgarian Media Group\", deemed close to the Turkish-minority Movement for Rights and Freedoms party emerged in 2007 and got own \"Monitor\", \"Express\", \"Telegraph\" (dailies), \"Politika\", \"Weekend\", \"Meridian Match\" (weeklies), the \"Borba\" newspaper and a publishing house (in the city of Veliko Turnovo).\n\nFrom 1935 to 1989 there was a state monopoly on radio broadcasts in Bulgaria. After liberalization, the market now features a high number of private, national and local radio stations.\n\nThe sector is mainly controlled by four foreign groups: the Irish Communicorp Group, SBS Broadcasting Group (since 2007 part of ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG), US Emmis Communications, and News Corporation Group (owned by Rupert Murdoch). A Bulgarian owner, Focus, joined them in late 2009. They overall control over 20 radio stations.\n\nThe two national-coverage radio stations are the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR), with two channels (\"Horizont\" and \"Hristo Botev\"), and the private Darik radio. BNP's \"Radio Bulgaria\" broadcasts abroad, as well as in 7 regional centres in the country.\n\nTelevision in Bulgaria was introduced in 1959. Although the Bulgarian media market is small, it is one of the most vibrant and highly competitive in Central and Eastern Europe. At the turn of the century, global players such as News Corporation, Modern Times Group, Central European Media Enterprises and Fox Broadcasting Company briefly entered and consequently exited the Bulgarian TV market due to shrinking revenues, political pressure and the effect of the global recession of 2008. \n\nTwo of the leading TV stations, bTV and Nova TV, are foreign-owned. The third is the national public service broadcaster, Bulgarian National Television; BNT is deemed nonpartisan, but remains vulnerable to political interference from the government. The fourth free-to-air TV network is Bulgaria On Air, owned by Investor.BG (part of the controversial TIM Group of Varna). \n\nPrivately owned television channels started to appear immediately after the regime change. Most were associated with a cable television (CATV) network run by the same parent company. Around 1994-1995 private over-the-air broadcasters also appeared, but they usually only operated within a single area. Nova Television and 7 Dni TV (\"7 дни\", meaning \"7 days\") were two of the first such channels, available only in Sofia. After bTV took over Efir 2's frequencies, another competition selected Nova Television, already popular in cable networks around the country, as the second privately owned national channel in Bulgaria. The authorities currently refuse to license further analogue terrestrial channels (including local ones), until DVB-T broadcasting is started.\n\nSwitch off to Digital terrestrial television (DVB-T) was completed on 30 September 2013, after a 7-months simulcast period, with 96,2% of the population under DVB-T broadcasting coverage.\n\nPublic funds for the Bulgarian cinema have dried up after the socialist period. Bulgaria has produced three films and two documentaries per year with state subsidies, afforded under tender procedures. Sponsorships also support the Bulgarian film production.\n\nThe Bulgarian telecommunication market, now privatised, is shared mainly among three actors: A1 Bulgaria (owned by A1 Austria Austria Group), Telenor (owned by Czech PPF), and Vivacom (controlled by Russia's VTB). A1 Bulgaria and Telenor Bulgaria dominate the mobile market, while Vivacom retains dominance on the 2.3 million landlines. Mobile phones in 2007 amounted to 9.87 million lines, with 110% penetration rate.\n\nThe telephony system features an extensive but antiquated telecommunications network inherited from the Soviet era; quality has improved; the Bulgaria Telecommunications Company's fixed-line monopoly terminated in 2005 when alternative fixed-line operators were given access to its network; a drop in fixed-line connections in recent years has been more than offset by a sharp increase in mobile-cellular telephone use fostered by multiple service providers; the number of cellular telephone subscriptions now exceeds the population.\n\nInternet access reached 55% of the population in 2014. Online media are more and more used as means of information, and social media have often used as a mobilisation tool.\nThe public media agency in Bulgaria is the Bulgarian News Agency (BTA), established in 1898 and regulated by a 1994 Statute. it serves all media in the country.\nPrivate web-based news agencies include \"Focus\" (now also a player on the radio market).\nThe Union of Publishers in Bulgaria (UPB) represents many owners of newspapers, magazines and books, though not all of them.\nThe Association of the Bulgarian Broadcasters (ABBRO) represents the interests of the radio and television industry, and includes 60 companies representing 160 licensed radio and TV stations (2007 data).\n\nThe Union of Bulgarian Journalists, stemming from its socialist roots, did not manage to establish itself as a professional organisation to protect journalists' interests.\n\nNGOs in the media sector, dealing with media freedom and professionalisation of journalism, include Access to Information Program, Media Development Centre, Centre for Independent Journalism.\n\nIn lack of any specific law on the printed media, there is not any specific regulatory or supervisory body either.\n\nThe Council for Electronic Media (CEM), established by the 1998 Radio and Television Act, checks compliance with regulations about advertising, sponsorship, copyright, protection of youth and minors, and considers violation complaints brought by experts and citizens. \nFive of its members are elected by Parliament, four are named by the President. Its independence from political and corporate pressures remains a matter of debate, and several of its actions have been controversial. The CEM is deemed as subject to multiple political and economic pressures.\n\nBulgaria scores as \"partly free\" in Freedom House's 2015 report, with a total score of 38. In Reporters Without Borders' World Press Freedom Index, Bulgaria is ranked 106th, with a score of 32.91; in the region, Bulgaria comes after Greece (91st) and right before Montenegro (114th) and Macedonia (117th). Its score is on a steady downward path since the early 2000s (it was 34th on 158 in 2003).\n\nAccording to a 2016 report of the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN IFRA), prepared by the South East Europe Media Organisation (SEEMO), the independence and pluralism of Bulgaria's media has eroded steadily over the past decade. In Bulgaria, media freedom and freedom of expression are increasingly constrained despite constitutional guarantees and right to access public information protected by the Law on Access to Public Information.\n\nAccording to WAN IFRA, Bulgarian authorities are increasingly employing tools of \"soft censorship\" to dominate and influence the country's media and limiting access to information and informed policy debate. Soft censorship, or indirect censorship, is defined as any official actions aiming at influencing media output, short of legal or extralegal bans, direct censorship, or physical attacks on media outlets and media professionals. These forms of indirect censorship include selective and partisan allocation of funds and advertising, as well as biased application of regulations and allocation of licenses, which can influence editorial content but also affect media outlets' sustainability.\n\nOne of the main tool leading to official soft censorship in Bulgaria is, according to WAN IFRA, biased state funding for media. Allocation of advertising and subsidies are opaque and non transparent. The situation has deteriorated due to the financial crisis which resulted in an increased dependency on government funding and in media content which avoid any criticism against government and official actions.\n\nMany journalists cannot report in an impartial way and many are unwilling to openly speak about soft censorship as they fear of losing their jobs. \n\nMost media which are not controlled by the state, are in the hands of businesses with close ties to the governmental structures. Transparency of media ownership is poor, but media ownership can be connected to a handful of leading political and business interests. Media owners and journalists know that in such a context critical coverage of people in government and public institutions the control or influence the allocation of funds may lead to the denial or withdrawal of such support, thus putting in danger their financial viability. Self-censorship may be necessary for economic survival.\n\nAccording to the 2016 WAN IFRA’s report, there are fewer physical attacks on journalists, although different threats are still reported. Much more common is use of libel and defamation lawsuits to intimidate and influence journalists or media outlets that not self-censor. Even though imprisonment for liberal and defamation was abolished in 1999, still they remain criminal offenses under Bulgarian criminal code. Convictions grounded in such cases are few, but the concrete possibility of prosecution entails a chilling effect on active, open and critical reporting.\n\nPressures and intimidations on journalists are widespread, giving rise to self-censorship. Police also sometime questions media professionals about their activities. High-level politicians often display intolerance towards media criticism. Impunity for crimes against journalists remains the norm. A June 2013 survey of 150 Bulgarian journalists by the Bulgarian affiliate of the Association of European Journalists remarked that 80% of them reported the existence of undue pressures and 60% said that internal pressures had distorted editorial contents.\n\n\nConcentration of media, both in terms of ownership and audience, is very high in Bulgaria. Except for the Public Service Media, no media-specific legislation regulates media ownership concentration and the issue falls within the scope of the general competition law. The Law on Radio and Television establishes only a general principle that a media licensing application must comply with the competition protection legislation. However, according to experts, this general provision proves to be inadequate. The Constitutional Court recognised media pluralism as an intrinsic part of media freedom, however “the principle of media pluralism is not respected in practice”.\n\nAccording to the Media Pluralism Monitor one of the major problems is the lack of effective legal remedies against media concentrations. Concern over concentration of media ownership in Bulgaria have also been raised by the European Commission in the first EU Anti-Corruption report which found out that media ownership in Bulgaria is increasingly concentrated, thus compromising editorial independence.\n\nIn a nutshell, there are two main obstacles for the effective reduction of media concentrations in Bulgaria: non-transparent media ownership and the lack of media-specific legislation regulating media concentration. These obstacles cannot be removed without political will for this.\n\nUnlike a number of European states, in Bulgaria there are not special rules concerning the supervision of mergers and acquisitions in the media sector. This supervision aims at ruling out the possibility that a media business or person has an excessive interest in one or more media sectors. \n\nThere are no provisions on media concentration in the Radio and Television Act applying to this media sector. As for print media, the sector is not regulated by law so there are no rules related to competition either. Issues related to concentration of ownership in the sector of digital media have not been discussed yet (2016).\n\nMedia fall under the regulation of the Commission for the Protection of Competition (CPC) which is in charge of overseeing concentration among undertakings, prohibiting anti-competitive agreements, decisions and practices, as well as abuse of dominant position. The Commission defines market concentration and the exemptions from it. Businesses are obliged by law to report to the Commission in case their income exceeds a certain threshold. In such cases the Commission allows concentration if it does not lead to the establishment or increasing of a dominant position, which would significantly prevent competition in the relevant market. In case of failure to report, or of concentration prohibited by the Commission, it may impose sanctions. \n\nIn 2010, a new draft law on electronic media was discussed and the Commission for the Protection of Competition issued an opinion assessing the compliance of the proposal with the Protection of Competition Act. The Commission stated that in evaluating the risk of concentration it relies solely on an economic analysis, checking only the market share of the respective media, as well as audience share and advertising market share. The Commission does not take into consideration factors like the potential impact of the concentration on media content and the public significance of such impact. It thus observed that specific regulatory considerations regarding the media market, such as the need to guarantee pluralism and freedom of expression, are not taken into account by the Commission itself when overseeing concentrations. \n\nThe case law of the regulatory authority regarding media concentration in Bulgaria clearly shows that further regulation and supervision are needed in order to guarantee that non-market principles, such as media pluralism, are taken into consideration in assessing transactions falling under competitive law. According to experts, effective measures for ensuring media pluralism should not be limited to self-regulation measures, but include the introduction of a body in charge of conducting non-economic analysis to assess the influence of media outlets. However, such measures are not endorsed on political level.\n\nIn Bulgaria, the only legal explicit restrictions on media ownership is enshrined in the Law on Radio and Television, adopted in 1998 and amended several times since then. The Law was elaborated with the aim of regulating the market of broadcast media. Although the Law was not conceived specifically to address the issue of concentration, it includes restrictions on cross-ownership, pertaining only to national broadcasters. According to the law, licenses cannot be awarded to legal persons (or persons related to legal persons) which already possess licenses for local radio or television stations. This amendment was introduced after discovering cases of local operators acquiring licenses for national broadcasting. The Law also stipulates that national operators cannot become owners of local and regional stations. It also requires applicants to declare that they do not hold stakes, shares or other rights of participation in radio and television broadcasters above the threshold set by anti-trust legislation.\n\nThe law regulates the operation of Bulgarian broadcasters and contains some provisions restricting broadcast licenses and regulates the registration of cable programmes. Several provisions aim at protecting the media environment from the entry of dubious capital. For instance, the Law establishes that businesses connected with insurance services are ineligible for applying for a broadcast license. This provision is the result of a specific feature of the Bulgarian economy, where certain insurance companies born out of structures related to the previous regime's security services sector. However, in practice, due to the weakness of the Bulgarian media market which is unable to sustain the broadcast and print media, the opportunities for the entry of suspicious capitale into the media sphere have recently increased. Also, the law excludes from holding a license of a broadcast media telecommunications operators placed in a monopoly situation on the market (i.e. the state telecommunications company Bulgarian Telecommunications Company) and advertising agencies or companies including partners or shareholders having interests in the advertisement market.\n\nWhen applying for a license in the broadcasting sector, the applicant is required to submit a declaration showing who the owners are and what their shares are, including document showing the origin of the capital for the last three years. Also, the application should include a list of media enterprises in which the persons are shareholders or partners.\n\nTendencies towards concentration characterise the area of press distribution as well. Some of the factors contributing to this concern the possibility for a publisher to be a distributor at the same time; the aggregation of ownership in non-transparent way; and political connections and dependencies influencing the sector. A dominant position in this sector impedes the fair distribution of small publishers' works. In 2011, the Commission for the Protection of Competition carried out an analysis on the press distribution sector. It found out that in the period from 2009 to 2011 there was a pooling of the distributors on the market aiming at optimising costs exploit the advantages of economies of scale and scope. Such integration impeded the entry of new actors on the market and led to market concentration.\n\nMedia concentration has been widely debated in Bulgaria since the 1990s. After the change from Communism to the market economy, the country faced the issue of concentration: the monopoly positions of the state media were replaced by the domination of several private media groups. In the 1990s the problem affected in particular the print sector: two most influential newspapers at that time - \"Trud\" and \"24 hours\" - were purchased by the \"WAZ Group\". The group dominated the Bulgarian media market until the late 2000s. In the late 2000s, the creation and rapid grow of the \"New Media Group\" were seen again as a case of media ownership concentration in the sector of print and online media. At stakes there was the group’s links with politics and a bank. The group purchased local media, thus acquiring a dominant position in the local media market and in print media distribution. According to some estimates, the company gained a 70-80% share in the print media distribution market. The case of the \"New Media Group\" lead to public debate in 2001 that forced the Commission on the Protection of Competition to make a sectoral analysis of the concentration in the print media distribution market. The study found that the concentration in 2009-2011 constituted an obstacle to new competitors wishing to enter the market . The Commission also concluded that there was a lack of transparent rules in the field. However, it issued a permission for such concentration on the basis that it would not establish or increase a dominant position in the distribution market.\n\nAccording to the Media Pluralism Monitor, \"concentration of media ownership is very high\". The top 4 major owners in the broadcasting sector have an aggregated market share (based on advertising revenue only) of 93.35%. The top 4 major owners of daily newspapers reach an aggregated market share of 79.7%. As for Internet Service Providers (ISPs), they have an estimated market share which is above 50%. Concentration trends are also present in terms of audience and readership whose concentration is \"very high\" according to the Media Pluralism Monitor. In television, the top 4 major owners have an audience share that is above 70%; as for the radio sector, the aggregated share of the top 4 major owners is 83.16%. The top 4 major newspaper owners have an estimated readership share between 25 to 49%, and the subscription share of the top 4 ISPs is estimated to be above 50%.\n\nIn Bulgaria, there are significant links between media owners and other actors operating in the economic landscape. According to expert Nelly Ognyanova, there are unregulated links between media, money and power. This fact became publicly known following a joint access to information request submitted by 11 biggest newspapers in 2010, which revealed that a media group owning newspapers, internet outlets and a TV station borrowed large amounts of money from a big bank, the \"Corporate Trade Bank\". Also, the information disclosed showed that the same bank hosted a considerable amount of budget money of several ministers as well as bank accounts of relevant state-owned companies operating in the field of energy, public transport, defence and information service. The owner of such media group, Delyan Peevsky, also runs businesses in other sectors, such as construction, tobacco and newspapers distribution. Moreover, his businesses are allegedly involved in big public procurements. The group is also connected with the political party, the \"Movement for Rights and Freedoms\" (DPS) which has been influential for many years. Mr. Peevsky is the son of Irena Krasteva, the owner of many of the print media outlets within the \"New Media Group\". Bulgarian press revealed the existence of connections between the \"New Media Group\" and political parties and other businesses. This is not the only case of political influence over the media in Bulgaria. For instance, there are some media which are officially owned by political figures or parties, a case that is not prohibited by law in Bulgaria.\n\nThe communication campaigns on EU funds turned out to be one of the funding sources for the Bulgarian media. The budget on advertising for the period 2007-2014 was 84.3 mln. EUR (165 mln. BGN). A detailed distribution of the funds between outlets isn't available as the contracts between ministries and media were conducted by advertising agencies and other intermediaries.\n\n"}

Panther Games specialises in developing operational level wargames for the PC Wargame market.\n\nPanther Games was founded in 1985 by David O’Connor in Canberra, Australia.\n\nIn the early years Panther Games initially focused on developing and producing board games and released three titles in the mid 80’s, \"Trial of Strength\", \"Shanghai Trader\" and \"\".\n\nHowever, the company shifted their focus to developing computer games in the late 1980s with the release of their first computer wargame, \"\", in 1988 on Mac, DOS, Atari and Amiga. Fire Brigade currently forms part of the historical collection of software; hardwere; trade and promotional materials that document the history of Apple Inc. and its contributions to the computer industry and society. This collection is currently housed at Museum Victoria, Melbourne.\n\nFollowing the success of Fire Brigade, Panther Games took a step into the mainstream games market with the releases of sci-fi adventure \"Alien Drug Lords\" and puzzle challenge game \"Cubit\" in 1991.\n\nIn 1996 Panther Games decided to return to its wargame roots and instigated development of a new real-time computer game engine for a novel operational wargame series to be called Airborne Assault (AA).The use of a real-time engine without a hexagon grid for a wargame was novel as traditional computer wargames run on a turn-based system where there are dedicated phases for planning, movement and engagement. The AA engine (later rebranded Command Ops) allowed for planning, movement and engagement to be played in continues time and the hexagon grid was no longer needed to determine movement capabilities of units. Panther Games' AA game engine and the associated AI capabilities has notably been referenced in publications by Peter Perla at Center for Naval Analyses (CNA), Michael Peck at Defence News and the Digital Humanities at King's College London.\n\nThe first title to be produced in the series was \"\" (RDOA) and was released in 2002 through wargame publisher battlefront.com. However, in Europe, Panther Games used a different publisher, CDV Software Entertainment AG, and the title for the game was simply Airborne Assault.\n\nThe second and third instalments of the AA series were released through a new publisher, Matrix Games, with \"\" (HTTR) coming out in 2003 and \"\" (COTA) in 2006.\n\nIn 2010, Panther Games rebranded their long running games series to Command Ops and released their latest title, \"\" (BFTB).\n\nIn 2012, the first official expansion pack Panther Games has ever released came out titled, \"Command Ops: Highway to the Reich\". This is an expansion pack for BFTB and covers content from the original two AA games.\n\n18 October 2014, Panther Games in conjunction with Lock 'n Load publishing jointly announce Panther Games' move to Lock 'n Load publishing following the split between Panther games and Matrix Games. Following the announcement it was revealed Panther Games through Lock n' Load would be re-releasing Panther Games' successful 1985 board game Trial of Strength with a new edition. it would be the first time the board game has been re-released since its initial release in 1985. In addition, it was revealed Panther Games' new game engine, Command Ops 2, would be released through the publisher along with all subsequent data packs for the engine. This represented a new method of content delivery for the company.\n\nJune 2015, Command Ops 2 goes public beta and the \"Commander Pack\" consisting of all five modual data packs for Command Ops 2 goes on sale 16 June 2015.\n\nParallel to its commercial wargame development, Panther Games also provides professional services to the military. Simulation Australia (part of the Australian Department of innovation, Industry, Science and Research) describe Panther Games' professional services capabilities to include wargame design and development; artificial intelligence; user interface; programming; scenario development (including for JSAF); Puckstering (for JSAF) and a wide range of Analysis.\n\nIn 2007, Panther Games was a team partner along with Booz Allen Hamilton, Ball Solutions, CAE and Calytrix Technology in the successful Joint Decision Support and Simulations Centre (JDSSC) project for the Australian Department of Defence.\n\nIn 2009, Panther Games became an associate member of the joint Defence-Industry initiative, Rapid Prototyping, Development and Evaluation Program (RPDE).\n\nIn October 2010, Panther Games began a four-month scoping study for the Australian Defence Simulation Office (ADSO) to determine the Defence requirements for a course of action analyser simulation tool.\n\n\n\n"}

A polka-dot paint effect has been produced in stage magic, and in the 1950s a polychromatic paint was invented which produced a dotted effect when dry.\n\nIn the United States several magicians invented a trick in which they demonstrating painting with polka-dot paint. Prior to the performance, an object is pre-painted in the desired pattern with an oil-based paint and then covered with white watercolor or whitewash. During the trick, a wet brush passed over the object removes the layer of watercolor, revealing the polka dots.\n\nThe truck was the subject of litigation between two stage magicians, Harry Albacker and Paul Stadelman in 1950s. The defendant's defense was that the magic act was \"old as hills\", and hence in public domain. Stadelman, in his turn was challenged by other magicians who claimed that he took the idea from the \"barber's pole paint\" trick. However Stadelman claimed it was actually he who invented the barber's pole paint trick in the first place. Stadelman said that often after he performed this trick as paint dealers' conventions, he was getting letters from people who wanted to market this paint.\n\nAnother version of this trick involves colorless chemicals on the object which become colored after a reaction with another chemical on the brush.\n\nIn 1950 a product called \"Plextone\" by Maas & Walsdtein Co. was advertised, a finishing which is a single application produced \"a network of interlaced but separate colors - a 'Polka Dot' paint\". In 1952 a John C. Zola patented (US 3811904 ) polychromatic paint, technically described as \"a multicolor paint from lacquer-based colorants suspended in water\". The inventor was inspired by French painter Georges Seurat, who created his impressionist effects using small dots of paint. Sapolin Paints, Inc. of New York City sold \"polka-dot paint\" in a spray can, which sprayed droplets of paint; the farther the can was from the surface the larger were the dots. \n\n"}

The music video for \"Sexy Bitch\" features Guetta and Akon at a house party and performing in a concert.\n\n\"Sexy Bitch\" was written by Giorgio Tuinfort, Aliaune Thiam, David Guetta, Jean-Claude Sindres and Sandy Vee. The production was helmed by Guetta, Sindres and Vee. Guetta, in an interview for MTV News, said the collaboration with Akon came after they met during a performance of \"When Love Takes Over\" with Kelly Rowland. Akon approached him, asking if they could work together, and Guetta suggested that they should start immediately, so they rented a studio in London and made the song in one night. \"Sexy Bitch\" was released as the second single from \"One Love\" (2009), after the international success of \"When Love Takes Over\". It was released worldwide as a digital promotional single, which preceded the release \"One Love\", on 24 July 2009. Astralwerks, together with Capitol Records, solicited the song to mainstream and rhythmic radios on 1 September 2009 in the United States under the name \"Sexy Chick\".

It has amassed sales of 3,507,000 digital downloads in the United States by March 2014.\n\nIn Canada, the song debuted on the Canadian Hot 100 at number nine, becoming the week's \"highest debut\". It fell down the chart up until its fourth week, when it hit number 35. The song got its \"second wind\" in its fifth week, rising to number 21, and eventually reached the summit of the chart, where it stalled for two weeks.\n\n\"Sexy Bitch\" replicated the chart success of the previous single in international territories. In the Australasian countries, it reached the summit of the singles charts in Australia and New Zealand. However, the song was more successful in Australia, where it logged the top position for seven weeks and lasted on the chart for 38 weeks. The song earned a quintuple-platinum certification by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), denoting shipments of 350,000 copies. In New Zealand, \"Sexy Bitch\" lasted three weeks at number one and 23 weeks on the chart.

The song rose to number one in the following week and lasted 40 weeks on the chart, amassing sales of 740,000 copies in the United Kingdom. \"Sexy Bitch\" showed the most longevity in Switzerland, where it logged 77 weeks on the singles chart. The song reached a peak of number two, where it stalled for three consecutive weeks in October 2009. It eventually earned a quadruple-platinum certification by International Federation of the Phonographic Industry Switzerland (IFPI Switzerland), denoting shipments of 80,000 copies. \"Sexy Bitch\" experienced a successful chart run in Sweden, entering the singles chart at number eight and after more than two months, reached a peak at number two. The song lasted 55 weeks on the chart, 25 of which were spent inside the top 10. In Austria, the song reached the summit of the singles chart, where it stayed for three consecutive weeks.\n\nThe video was directed by Stephen Schuster. The video starts with a plane coming and girls in bikinis are seen tanning and swimming. The camera switches to Akon who wakes up and finds pictures of his date from David Guetta's pool party. He then finds lipstick note on his mirror that reads \"find me at pool party\" with yet another photo. As the party starts, people enter; a group of teenage boys are not allowed but they employ various methods to get in. The camera switches to Akon again, who is shown singing underwater. The camera flicks to Guetta arriving meeting up with Akon, who then grabs Guetta and they throw each other in the pool. The party continues as Akon pushes more people in, girls dance and Akon with Guetta are shown to be having a water fight. The scene then skips to a club that is called \"Fuck Me, I'm Famous\" where David Guetta is performing a concert with Tocadisco, and Akon is walking in from the back, where he meets some girls. Akon then arrives and performs \"Sexy Bitch\" at the concert. A light up man in blue and green appears. Girls are shown dancing and Akon does a crowd surf before the video ends. At the end, Akon is seen sleeping in the bed waking up finding pictures but goes back to sleep.\n\nThe video was filmed in Ibiza, Barcelona, Spain, and Swindon, England around 27 July 2009.\n\nAn alternate version for a censored version of the song (\"Sexy Chick\") depicts two girls in Akon's bedroom; one is taking Polaroid photos of the other. They even take photos of themselves in Akon's bed while he sleeps. Akon's bed is covered in photos, and as the girls leave, the one most heavily photographed writes in lipstick on the bathroom mirror, \"find me at pool party\". She attaches another photo and leaves a lipstick impression of her lips on the mirror before she goes to the pool party. Akon then wakes up. The rest of the video is much like the other version, with a few scenes cut or added at the pool party and the club. For example, the underwater singing scene is omitted.\n\nOn 24 March 2010, Buddhist groups in Sri Lanka have stated the music video was offensive to Buddhism, due to the fact that the Buddha statue is found in several shots in the background throughout. With protests held along with demanding a concert cancellation, the Sri Lankan Government prohibited Akon from entering Sri Lanka with a visa. In response, Akon said \"I was not aware that the statue was even on the set of the video until now. I would never set out to offend or desecrate anyone’s religion or religious beliefs... I myself am a spiritual man, so I can understand why they are offended, but violence is never the answer and I am disheartened.\"\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"One Love\", Virgin Records, EMI France.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1924 he developed a mechanical television system to transmit moving images by means of electrical signals, which he demonstrated on 25 March 1925 at a London department store, Selfridges. It consisted of a spinning disk set with a spiral pattern of 30 lenses. As each lens rotated past the illuminated subject, it focused the light from a spot on the subject on a selenium photoelectric cell. This converted the brightness of the image at each spot into a proportional electric signal, which could be sent to a receiver by radio waves. As each lens swept past the subject, it scanned a successive line of the image. At the receiver, a light shining through the holes in a similar rotating disk recreated an image of the subject.\n\nDue to the low sensitivity of the photoelectric cells, Baird's first system was not able to televise human faces, because they had inadequate contrast. So Baird used a ventriloquist's dummy, whose brightly painted face had greater contrast, and made it move and talk before the scanner. Stooky Bill and another Baird dummy, \"James\" have been jokingly called \"the first television actors\".\n\n\"Stooky\" or \"stookie\" is Scots for stucco or plaster of Paris, or for a plaster cast used to immobilise bone fractures. The term is also used someone who is slow-witted or awkward in his movements. The incandescent lights illuminating the subject to be televised generated so much heat that Baird couldn't use a human for the testing, so Stooky Bill was used. Eventually the hair became singed and the painted face became cracked by the heat.\n\n\n"}

At the 2006 International Thessaloniki Film Festival, the film was announced as among the 10 all-time best Greek films by the PHUCC (Pan-Hellenic Union of Cinema Critics).\n\nAn honest, reserved goldsmith and engraver, Anargyros Loumbardopoulos (Vassilis Logothetidis), has routinely invested his money in gold coins, specifically British gold sovereigns, bought from a friend of his, a banker. Upon having stored away 100 sovereigns, a man working for the banker suggests that Anargyros starts minting counterfeit sovereigns, but he adamantly refuses. The banker employee then introduces Anargyros to a divorced attractive lady, Fifi (Ilya Livykou) that he knows. Anargyros' resistance is soon curbed by Fifi's sexual means, and he spends all his invested 100 sovereigns to buy minting equipment.

{"id": "372478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=372478", "title": "Video game industry", "text": "Video game industry\n\nThe video game industry is the economic sector involved in the development, marketing, and monetization of video games. It encompasses dozens of job disciplines and its component parts employ thousands of people worldwide.\n\nThe computer and video game industry has grown from focused markets to mainstream. They took in about US$9.5 billion in the US in 2007, 11.7 billion in 2008, and 25.1 billion in 2010 (ESA annual report).\n\nModern personal computers owe many advancements and innovations to the game industry: sound cards, graphics cards and 3D graphic accelerators, faster CPUs, and dedicated co-processors like PhysX are a few of the more notable improvements.\n\nSound cards were developed for addition of digital-quality sound to games and only later improved for music and audiophiles. Early on, graphics cards were developed for more colors. Later, graphic cards were developed for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and games; GUIs drove the need for high resolution, and games began using 3D acceleration. They also are one of the only pieces of hardware to allow multiple hookups (such as with SLI or CrossFire graphics cards). CD- and DVD-ROMs were developed for mass distribution of media in general; however the ability to store more information on cheap easily distributable media was instrumental in driving their ever-higher speeds.\n\nBen Sawyer of Digitalmill observes that the game industry value chain is made up of six connected and distinctive layers:\n\nThe game industry employs those experienced in other traditional businesses, but some have experience tailored to the game industry. Some of the disciplines specific to the game industry include: game programmer, game designer, level designer, game producer, game artist and game tester. Most of these professionals are employed by video game developers or video game publishers. However, many hobbyists also produce computer games and sell them commercially. Game developers and publishers sometimes employ those with extensive or long-term experience within the modding communities.\n\nPrior to the 1970s, there was no significant commercial aspect of the video game industry, but many advances in computing would set the stage for the birth of the industry.\n\nMany early publicly-available interactive computer-based game machines used or other mechanisms to mimic a display; while technically not \"video games\", they had elements of interactivity between the player and the machine. Some examples of these included the 1940 \"Nimatron\", an electromagentic relay-based Nim-playing device designed by Edward Condon and built by Westinghouse Electric for the New York World's Fair, \"Bertie the Brain\", an arcade game of tic-tac-toe, built by Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition, and Nimrod created by engineering firm Ferranti for the 1951 Festival of Britain,\n\nThe development of cathode ray tube—the core technology behind televisions—created several of the first true video games. In 1947 Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann filed a patent for a \"cathode ray tube amusement device\". Their game, which uses a cathode ray tube hooked to an oscilloscope display, challenges players to fire a gun at target.\n\nBetween the 1950s and 1960s, with mainframe computers becoming available to campus colleges, students and others started to develop games that could be played at terminals that accessed the mainframe. One of the first known examples is \"Spacewar!\", developed by Harvard and MIT employees Martin Graetz, Steve Russell, and Wayne Wiitanen. The introduction of easy-to-program languages like BASIC for mainframes allowed for more simplistic games to be developed.\n\nIn 1971, the arcade game, \"Computer Space was released.\" The following year, Atari, Inc. released the first commercially successful video game, \"Pong\", the original arcade version of which sold over 19,000 arcade cabinets. That same year saw the introduction of video games to the home market with the release of the early video game console, the Magnavox Odyssey. However, both the arcade and home markets would be dominated by \"Pong\" clones, which flooded the market and led to the video game crash of 1977. The crash eventually came to an end with the success of Taito's \"Space Invaders\", released in 1978, sparking a renaissance for the video game industry and paving the way for the golden age of video arcade games. The game's success inspired arcade machines to become prevalent in mainstream locations such as shopping malls, traditional storefronts, restaurants and convenience stores during the golden age. \"Space Invaders\" would go on to sell over 360,000 arcade cabinets worldwide, and by 1982, generate a revenue of $2 billion in quarters, equivalent to $4.6 billion in 2011.\n\nSoon after, \"Space Invaders\" was licensed for the Atari VCS (later known as Atari 2600), becoming the first \"killer app\" and quadrupling the console's sales. The success of the Atari 2600 in turn revived the home video game market during the second generation of consoles, up until the North American video game crash of 1983. By the end of the 1970s, the personal computer game industry began forming from a hobby culture.\n\nThe early 1980s saw the golden age of video arcade games reach its zenith. The total sales of arcade video game machines in North America increased significantly during this period, from $50 million in 1978 to $900 million by 1981, with the arcade video game industry's revenue in North America tripling to $2.8 billion in 1980. By 1981, the arcade video game industry was generating an annual revenue of $5 billion in North America, equivalent to $12.3 billion in 2011. In 1982, the arcade video game industry reached its peak, generating $8 billion in quarters, equivalent to over $18.5 billion in 2011, surpassing the annual gross revenue of both pop music ($4 billion) and Hollywood films ($3 billion) combined at that time. This was also nearly twice as much revenue as the $3.8 billion generated by the home video game industry that same year; both the arcade and home markets combined add up to a total revenue of $11.8 billion for the video game industry in 1982, equivalent to over $27.3 billion in 2011. The arcade video game industry would continue to generate an annual revenue of $5 billion in quarters through to 1985. The most successful game of this era was Namco's \"Pac-Man\", released in 1980, which would go on to sell over 350,000 cabinets, and within a year, generate a revenue of more than $1 billion in quarters; in total, \"Pac-Man\" is estimated to have grossed over 10 billion quarters ($2.5 billion) during the 20th century, equivalent to over $3.4 billion in 2011.\n\nThe early part of the decade saw the rise of 8-bit home computing, and home-made games, especially in Europe (with the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64) and Asia (with the NEC PC-88 and MSX). This time also saw the rise of video game journalism, which was later expanded to include covermounted cassettes and CDs.\nIn 1983, the North American industry crashed due to the production of too many badly developed games (quantity over quality), resulting in the fall of the North American industry. The industry would eventually be revitalized by the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System, which resulted in the home console market being dominated by Japanese companies such as Nintendo, while a professional European computer game industry also began taking shape with companies such as Ocean Software and Gremlin Interactive. The latter part of the decade saw the rise of the Game Boy handheld system. In 1987, Nintendo lost a legal challenge against Blockbuster Entertainment, which enabled games rentals in the same way as movies.\n\nThe 1990s saw advancements in game related technology. Among the significant advancements were:\n\nAside from technology, in the early part of the decade, licensed games became more popular, as did video game sequels.\n\nThe video game industry generated worldwide sales of $19.8 billion in 1993 (equivalent to $31 billion in 2011), $20.8 billion in 1994 (equivalent to $32 billion in 2011), and an estimated $30 billion in 1998 (equivalent to $41.5 billion in 2011). In the United States alone, in 1994, arcades were generating $7 billion in quarters (equivalent to $11 billion in 2011) while home console game sales were generating revenues of $6 billion (equivalent to $9 billion in 2011). Combined, this was nearly two and a half times the $5 billion revenue generated by movies in the United States at the time.\n\nIn 2000s, the video game industry is a juggernaut of development; profit still drives technological advancement which is then used by other industry sectors. Technologies such as Smartphones, virtual reality and augmented reality are major drivers for game hardware and gameplay development. Though maturing, the video game industry was still very volatile, with third-party video game developers quickly cropping up, and just as quickly, going out of business. Nevertheless, many casual games and indie games were developed and become popular and successful, such as \"Braid\" and \"Limbo\". Game development for mobile phones (such as iOS and Android devices) and social networking sites emerged. For example, a Facebook game developer, Zynga, has raised in excess of $300 million.\n\nThough not the main driving force, indie games continue to have a significant impact on the industry, with sales of some of these titles such as \"Spelunky\", \"Fez\", \"Don't Starve\", \"Castle Crashers\", and \"Minecraft\", exceeding millions of dollars and over a million users. The 2010s have seen a larger shift to casual and mobile gaming; in 2016, the mobile gaming market is estimated to have taken $38 billion in revenues, compared to $6 billion for the console market and $33 billion for personal computing gaming. Games centered on virtual reality and augmented reality equipment also arose during this decade. As of 2014, newer game companies arose that vertically integrate live operations and publishing such as crowdfunding and other direct-to-consumer efforts, rather than relying on a traditional publishers, and some of these have grown to substantial size. Spurred by some initial events in the late 2000s, eSports centered around professional players in organized competitions and leagues for prize money, grew greatly over this decade, drawing hundreds of millions of viewers and reaching nearly $500 million in revenue by 2016 and expected to break $1 billion by 2019.\n\nEarly on, development costs were minimal, and video games could be quite profitable. Games developed by a single programmer, or by a small team of programmers and artists, could sell hundreds of thousands of copies each. Many of these games only took a few months to create, so developers could release multiple titles per year. Thus, publishers could often be generous with benefits, such as royalties on the games sold. Many early game publishers started from this economic climate, such as Origin Systems, Sierra Entertainment, Capcom, Activision and Electronic Arts.\n\nAs computing and graphics power increased, so too did the size of development teams, as larger staffs were needed to address the ever-increasing technical and design complexities. The larger teams consist of programmers, artists, game designers, and producers. Their salaries can range anywhere from $50,000 to $120,000 generating large labor costs for firms producing videogames which can often take between one and three years to develop. Now budgets typically reach millions of dollars despite the growing popularity of middleware and pre-built game engines. In addition to growing development costs, marketing budgets have grown dramatically, sometimes consisting of two to three times of the cost of development.\n\nThe game development team has to select a profitable and suitable method to sell or earn money from the finished game. Traditionally, the game monetization method is to sell hard copies in retail store. Now some developers are turning to alternative production and distribution methods, such as online distribution, to reduce costs and increase revenue.\n\nToday, the video game industry has a major impact on the economy through the sales of major systems and games such as \"\", which took in over $650 USD million of sales in the game's first five days and which set a five-day global record for a movie, book or videogame. The game's income was more than the opening weekend of \"Spider-Man 3\" and the previous title holder for a video game \"Halo 3\". Many individuals have also benefited from the economic success of video games including the former chairman of Nintendo and Japan's third richest man: Hiroshi Yamauchi. Today the global video game market is valued at over $93 billion.\n\nThe industry wide adoption of high-definition graphics during the seventh generation of consoles greatly increased development teams' sizes and reduced the number of high-budget, high-quality titles under development. In 2013 Richard Hilleman of Electronic Arts estimated that only 25 developers were working on such titles for the eighth console generation, compared to 125 at the same point in the seventh generation-console cycle seven or eight years earlier.\n\nThe games industry's shift from brick and mortar retail to digital downloads led to a severe sales decline at video game retailers such as GameStop, following other media retailers superseded by Internet delivery, such as Blockbuster, Tower Records, and Virgin Megastores. GameStop diversified its services by purchasing chains that repair wireless devices and expanding its trade-in program through which customers trade used games for credit towards new games. The company began to produce its own merchandise and games. In Britain, the games retailer Game revamped its stores so customers would spend time playing games there. It built a gaming arena for events and tournaments. The shift to digital marketplaces, especially for smartphones, led to an influx of inexpensive and disposable titles, as well as lower engagement among gamers who otherwise purchased new games from retail. Customers also shifted away from the tradition of buying games on their first day of release.\n\nPublishers often funded trade-in deals to encourage consumers to purchase new games. Trade-in customers at the Australia retailer Game would purchase twice the games per year as non-trade-in customers. The sale of pre-owned games kept retailers in business, and composed about a third of Game's revenue. Retailers also saved on the UK's value-added tax, which only taxed the retailer's profit on pre-owned games, rather than the full sale on regular games. The former trade-in retail executives behind the trade-in price comparison site Trade In Detectives estimated that the United Kingdom's trade-in industry was about a third of the size of its new games business. They figured that sites such as eBay, which convert used games into cash, compose about a quarter of the UK's trade-in market, but do not keep the credit within the industry. While consumers might appear to receive better offers on these sites, they also take about 15 percent of the selling price in fees. Alternatively, some retailers will match the trade-in values offered by their competitors. Microsoft's original plan for the Xbox One attempted to translate trade-in deals for the digital marketplace, with a database of product licenses that shops would be able to resell with publisher permission, though the plan was poorly received or poorly sold.\n\nVideo game industry practices are similar to those of other entertainment industries (e.g., the music recording industry), but the video game industry in particular has been accused of treating its development talent poorly. This promotes independent development, as developers leave to form new companies and projects. In some notable cases, these new companies grow large and impersonal, having adopted the business practices of their forebears, and ultimately perpetuate the cycle.\n\nHowever, unlike the music industry, where modern technology has allowed a fully professional product to be created extremely inexpensively by an independent musician, modern games require increasing amounts of manpower and equipment. This dynamic makes publishers, who fund the developers, much more important than in the music industry.\n\nIn the video game industry, it is common for developers to leave their current studio and start their own. A particularly famous case is the \"original\" independent developer Activision, founded by former Atari developers. Activision grew to become the world's second largest game publisher. In the mean time, many of the original developers left to work on other projects. For example, founder Alan Miller left Activision to start another video game development company, Accolade (now Atari née Infogrames).\n\nActivision was popular among developers for giving them credit in the packaging and title screens for their games, while Atari disallowed this practice. As the video game industry took off in the mid-1980s, many developers faced the more distressing problem of working with fly-by-night or unscrupulous publishers that would either fold unexpectedly or run off with the game profits.\n\nThe industry claims software piracy to be a big problem, and take measures to counter this. \nDigital rights management have proved to be the most unpopular with gamers, as a measure to counter piracy.\nThe most popular and effective strategy to counter piracy is to change the business model to Freemium, where gamers pay for their in-game needs or service. Strong server-side security is required for this, to properly distinguish authentic transactions from hacked (faked) transactions.\n\nOn various Internet forums, some gamers have expressed disapproval of publishers having creative control since publishers are more apt to follow short-term market trends rather than invest in risky but potentially lucrative ideas. On the other hand, publishers may know better than developers what consumers want. The relationship between video game developers and publishers parallels the relationship between recording artists and record labels in many ways. But unlike the music industry, which has seen flat or declining sales in the early 2000s, the video game industry continues to grow. Also, personal computers have made the independent development of music almost effortless, while the gap between an independent game developer and the product of a fully financed one grows larger.\n\nIn the computer games industry, it is easier to create a startup, resulting in many successful companies. The console games industry is a more closed one, and a game developer must have up to three licenses from the console manufacturer:\n\nIn addition, the developer must usually buy development systems from the console manufacturer in order to even develop a game for consideration, as well as obtain concept approval for the game from the console manufacturer. Therefore, the developer normally has to have a publishing deal in place before starting development on a game project, but in order to secure a publishing deal, the developer must have a track record of console development, something which few startups will have.\n\nAn alternative method for publishing video games is to self-publish using the shareware or open source model over the Internet.\n\nGaming conventions are an important showcase of the industry. The major annual gaming conventions include gamescom in Cologne (Germany), the E3 in Los Angeles (USA), the Penny Arcade Expo, and .\n\nAs with other forms of media, video games have often been released in different world regions at different times. The practice has been used where localization is not done in parallel with the rest of development or where the game must be encoded differently, as in PAL vs. NTSC. It has also been used to provide price discrimination in different markets or to focus limited marketing resources. Developers may also stagger digital releases so as not to overwhelm the servers hosting the game.\n\nInternational video game revenue is estimated to be $81.5B in 2014. This is more than double the revenue of the international film industry in 2013. In 2015, it was estimated at .\n\nThe largest nations by estimated video game revenues in 2016 are China ($24.4B), the United States ($23.5B) and Japan ($12.4B). The largest regions in 2015 were Asia-Pacific ($43.1B), North America ($23.8B), and Western Europe ($15.6B).\n\nGaming conventions are an important showcase of the industry. The annual gamescom in Cologne (Germany) is a major expo for video games. The E3 in Los Angeles (USA) is also of global importance, but is an event for industry insiders only.\n\nOther notable conventions and trade fairs include Tokyo Game Show (Japan), Brasil Game Show (Brazil), EB Games Expo (Australia), KRI (Russia), ChinaJoy (China) and the annual Game Developers Conference. Some publishers, developers and technology producers also have their own regular conventions, with BlizzCon, QuakeCon, Nvision and the X shows being prominent examples.\n\nVideo gaming is still in its infancy throughout the African continent, but due to the continent's young population and increasing technological literacy, the sector is growing rapidly. African countries such as South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya have been making rapid advances in mobile game development, both within their country and internationally, but due to limited funding and a market over-crowded with western games, success has thus far been minimal.\n\nCanada has the third largest video game industry in terms of employment numbers. The video game industry has also been booming in Montreal since 1997, coinciding with the opening of Ubisoft Montreal. Recently, the city has attracted world leading game developers and publishers studios such as Ubisoft, EA, Eidos Interactive, Artificial Mind and Movement, BioWare, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and Strategy First, mainly because video games jobs have been heavily subsidized by the provincial government. Every year, this industry generates billions of dollars and thousands of jobs in the Montreal area. Vancouver has also developed a particularly large cluster of video game developers, the largest of which, Electronic Arts, employs over two thousand people. The \"Assassin's Creed\" series, along with the \"Tom Clancy\" series have all been produced in Canada and have achieved worldwide success. For consumers, the largest video games convention in Canada is the Enthusiast Gaming Live Expo (EGLX).\n\nChina is the largest country by game revenue, and has a gaming public that exceeds the population of the entire United States. It is home to Asia Game Show, the largest game convention in the world by attendance. In 2014, the Xbox One became the first new game console sold since China's ban on consoles in 2000.\n\nGermany has the largest video games market in Europe, with revenues of $4.1 billion forecast for 2017. The annual gamescom in Cologne is Europe's largest gaming expo.\n\nOne of the earliest internationally successful video game companies was Gütersloh-based Rainbow Arts (founded in 1984) who were responsible for publishing the popular \"Turrican\" series of games. The Anno series and The Settlers series are globally popular strategy game franchises since the 1990s. The Gothic series, and Risen are established RPG franchises. The X series by Egosoft is the best-selling space simulation. The FIFA Manager series was also developed in Germany. The German action game (2012) was successful in the markets and received largely positive reviews. One of the most famed titles to come out of Germany is \"Far Cry\" (2004) by Frankfurt-based Crytek, who also produced the topseller \"Crysis\" and its sequels later.\n\nOther well-known current and former developers from Germany include Ascaron, Blue Byte, Deck13, Phenomic, Piranha Bytes, Radon, Related, Spellbound and Yager Development. Publishers include Deep Silver (Koch Media), dtp entertainment, Kalypso and Nintendo Europe. Bigpoint Games, Gameforge, Goodgame Studios and Wooga are among the world's leading browser game and social network game developers/distributors.\n\nThe Japanese video game industry is markedly different from the industry in North America, Europe and Australia.\nJapanese companies have created some of the largest and most lucrative titles ever made, such as the \"Mario\", \"Final Fantasy\", \"Metal Gear\", \"Pokémon\" and \"Resident Evil\" series of games.\nIn recent years, consoles and arcade games have both been overtaken by downloadable free-to-play games on the PC and mobile platforms.\n\nThe UK industry is the third largest in the World in terms of developer success and sales of hardware and software by country alone but fourth behind Canada in terms of people employed. The size of the UK game industry is comparable to its film or music industries. In recent years some of the studios have become defunct or been purchased by larger companies such as \"LittleBigPlanet\" developer, Media Molecule and Codemasters. The country is home to some of the world's most successful video game franchises, such as \"Tomb Raider\", \"Grand Theft Auto\", \"Fable\", \"\" and \"Total War\".\n\nThe country also went without tax relief until March 21, 2012 when the British government changed its mind on tax relief for UK developers, which without, meant most of the talented development within the UK may move overseas for more profit, along with parents of certain video game developers which would pay for having games developed in the UK. The industry trade body TIGA estimates that it will increase the games development sector's contribution to UK GDP by £283 million, generate £172 million in new and protected tax receipts to HM Treasury, and could cost just £96 million over five years. Before the tax relief was introduced there was a fear that the UK games industry could fall behind other leading game industries around the world such as France and Canada, of which Canada overtook the UK in terms of job numbers in the industry in 2010.\n\nThe United States has the largest video games presence in the world in terms of total industry employees. In 2004, the U.S. game industry as a whole was worth US$10.3 billion. U.S. gaming revenue is forecast to reach $23.5 billion in 2017, making it the second largest market behind China.\n\nMagnavox is credited for releasing the first video game console, the Odyssey. Activision was the first developer to create independent/third-party video games. Once the fastest-growing American company, Atari crashed in spectacular fashion, resulting in the North American video game crash of 1983. This resulted in the domination of the Japanese video game industry worldwide throughout the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThe U.S. is home to major game development companies such as Activision Blizzard (\"Call of Duty\", \"World of Warcraft\"), Electronic Arts (\"FIFA\", \"Battlefield\", \"Mass Effect\"), and Take-Two Interactive (Civilization, \"NBA 2K\" series, \"Grand Theft Auto\"). ZeniMax Media (\"Doom\", \"Fallout\", \"The Elder Scrolls\") is the world's largest privately held video game company. Niantic (\"Ingress\", \"Pokémon Go\") is a notable mobile game developer.\n\nValve Corporation operates Steam, the largest computer gaming platform, with an active user base (~125 million) that rivals the combined user bases of the current console generation (~150 million). While not specifically focused on games, the largest mobile gaming platforms are operated by Google (Google Play), and Apple Inc. (App Store), with the majority of mobile revenue coming from Asia. Microsoft operates Xbox, the only major game console hardware franchise not controlled by a Japanese company. Sony established Sony Interactive Entertainment in Silicon Valley to run PlayStation, the world's largest and longest-running video game console franchise.\n\nIntel and Nvidia are the largest makers of PC graphics chips. Advanced Micro Devices has become the most important console processor vendor, with all three of the eighth generation home consoles using AMD GPUs, and two of them use AMD CPUs. Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony were not aware that they were all using AMD processors until all their consoles were announced, underscoring the secrecy found within the game industry. Notable game engine developers include Epic Games (Unreal Engine) and Unity Technologies (Unity).\n\nThe West Coast is home to important video game conventions, such as Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), one of the largest video game industry-only events in the world, and Penny Arcade Expo (PAX West), the largest public video game convention in North America. The West Coast is also home to many of the major American video game industry companies, particularly the regions of Los Angeles, San Francisco Bay Area, and Seattle. Major game development regions outside of the West Coast include the Northeast and Texas.\n\nOver 150 million Americans play video games, with an average age of 35 and a gender breakdown of 59 percent male and 41 percent female. American gamers are more likely to vote than non-gamers, feel that the economy is the most important political issue, and lean conservative.\n\nSeveral important game development personalities were born in or moved to the United States. Notable developers include Ralph H. Baer (Magnavox Odyssey, the \"Father of Video Games\"), Jonathan Blow (\"Braid\"), John D. Carmack (\"Doom\", \"Quake\"), and Alexey Pajitnov (\"Tetris\"). Mario is named after Mario Segale, a former landlord of Nintendo of America. Some right-wing and left-wing activists, including Jack Thompson and Anita Sarkeesian, have met extreme resistance from the gaming public in response to the perceived politicizing of their art form.\n\nThe United States recognizes eSports players as professional athletes. Major League Gaming has eSports arenas and studios across the nation. Robert Morris University has a League of Legends varsity team, whose members are eligible for scholarships.\n\nPlayers become fourth-party developers, allowing for more open source models of game design, development and engineering. Players also create modifications (mods), which in some cases become just as popular as the original game for which they were created. An example of this is the game \"Counter-Strike\", which began as a mod of the video game \"Half-Life\" and eventually became a very successful, published game in its own right.\n\nWhile this \"community of modifiers\" may only add up to approximately 1% of a particular game's user base, the number of those involved will grow as more games offer modifying opportunities (such as, by releasing source code) and the video user base swells. According to Ben Sawyer, as many as 600,000 established online game community developers existed as of 2012. This effectively added a new component to the game industry value chain and if it continues to mature, it will integrate itself into the overall industry.\n\nThe industry has seen a shift towards games with multiplayer facilities. A larger percentage of games on all types of platforms include some type of competitive online multiplayer capability.\n\nIn addition, the industry is experiencing further significant change driven by convergence, with technology and player comfort being the two primary reasons for this wave of industry convergence. Video games and related content can now be accessed and played on a variety of media, including: cable television, dedicated consoles, handheld devices and smartphones, through social networking sites or through an ISP, through a game developer's website, and online through a game console and/or home or office personal computer. In fact, 12% of U.S. households already make regular use of game consoles for accessing video content provided by online services such as Hulu and Netflix. In 2012, for the first time, entertainment usage passed multiplayer game usage on Xbox, meaning that users spent more time with online video and music services and applications than playing multiplayer games. This rapid type of industry convergence has caused the distinction between video game console and personal computers to disappear. A game console with high-speed microprocessors attached to a television set is, for all intents and purposes, a computer and monitor.\n\nAs this distinction has been diminished, players' willingness to play and access content on different platforms has increased. The growing video gamer demographic accounts for this trend, as former president of the Entertainment Software Association Douglas Lowenstein explained at the 10th E3 expo, \"Looking ahead, a child born in 1995, E3's inaugural year, will be 19 years old in 2014. And according to Census Bureau data, by the year 2020, there will be 174 million Americans between the ages of 5 and 44. That's 174 million Americans who will have grown up with PlayStations, Xboxes, and GameCubes from their early childhood and teenage years...What this means is that the average gamer will be both older and, given their lifetime familiarity with playing interactive games, more sophisticated and discriminating about the games they play.\"\n\nEvidence of the increasing player willingness to play video games across a variety of media and different platforms can be seen in the rise of casual gaming on smartphones, tablets, and social networking sites as 92% of all smartphone and tablet owners play games at least once a week, 45% play daily, and industry estimates predict that, by 2016, one-third of all global mobile gaming revenue will come from tablets alone. Apple's App Store alone has more than 90,000 game apps, a growth of 1,400% since it went online. In addition, game revenues for iOS and Android mobile devices now exceed those of both Nintendo and Sony handheld gaming systems combined.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "335393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=335393", "title": "Wigger", "text": "Wigger\n\nWigger, or wigga, is a slang term for a white person, typically middle to upper-class, and of European ethnic origin, who emulates the perceived mannerisms, language, and fashions associated with African-American culture, particularly hip hop. The term is a portmanteau of white and nigger. The term \"nigger\" has often been used disparagingly, and since the mid-20th century, particularly in the United States, its usage became unambiguously pejorative and it is viewed as a racist insult and slur.\n\nOne dictionary defines the term as a slang, derogatory reference to \"...a white youth who adopts black youth culture by adopting its speech, wearing its clothes, and listening to its music.\" Another dictionary defines the term as \"offensive slang\" referring to a \"...white person, usually a teenager or young adult, who adopts the fashions, the tastes, and often the mannerisms considered typical of urban black youth.\"\n\nThe term may be considered derogatory, reflecting stereotypes of African-American, black British and white culture (when used as synonym of white trash). The \"wannabe\" connotation may be used pejoratively, implying a failed attempt at cultural appropriation by a white person. It is also sometimes used in a racist manner by the white culture, not only belittling the person perceived as \"acting black\", but also demeaning black people and culture, by proxy. It can also be seen as exploitative by African Americans and seen as robbing black culture of the credit for the purpose of the member of the white culture to appear as innovative or edgy at the expense of black culture.\n\nBefore this modern usage developed, \"wigger\" meant \"wig-maker\", but that old usage is now obsolete.\n\nThe phenomenon of white people adopting stereotypical black mannerisms, speech, and apparel – which in the general case is called allophilia – has appeared in several generations since slavery was abolished in the Western world. The concept has been documented in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and other white-majority countries. An early form of this was the \"white negro\" in the jazz and swing music scenes of the 1920s and 1930s; as examined in the 1957 Norman Mailer essay \"The White Negro\". It was later seen in the zoot suiter of the 1930s and 1940s, the hipster of the 1940s, the beatnik of the 1950s-1960s, the fascination with Jamaican ska and rude boy culture in Britain's 1960s mod subculture, the blue-eyed soul of the 1970s (soul music sung by white singers), and the hip hop done by white rappers in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nBakari Kitwana, \"...a culture critic who's been tracking American hip hop for years...\" has written \"Why White Kids Love Hip Hop: Wankstas, Wiggers, Wannabes, and the New Reality of Race in America.\" In 1993, an article in the UK newspaper \"The Independent\" described the phenomenon of white, middle-class kids who were \"wannabe Blacks\".\n\nThe African-American hip hop artist Azealia Banks has criticized white rapper Iggy Azalea \"..for failing to comment on \"black issues\" despite capitalising on the appropriation of African American culture in her music.\" Banks has called Azalea a \"wigger\" and there have been \"...accusations of racism against Azalea\" focused on her \"...insensitivity to the complexities of race relations and cultural appropriation.\"\n\nRobert A. Clift's documentary, \"Blacking Up: Hip-Hop's Remix of Race and Identity,\" questions white enthusiasts of black hip-hop culture. The term of art \"wigger\" \"...is used both proudly and derisively to describe white enthusiasts of black hip-hop culture.\" Clift's documentary examines \"...racial and cultural ownership and authenticity -- a path that begins with the stolen blackness seen in the success of Stephen Foster, Al Jolson, Benny Goodman, Elvis Presley, the Rolling Stones -- all the way up to Vanilla Ice (popular music's ur-wigger) and Eminem.\" A review of the documentary refers to the wiggers as \"white poseurs.\"\n\nOne of the earliest examples of a wigger is to be found in the fictional character of Felix in Harry Crews' book All We Need of Hell. Felix is the son of white parents who, as the narrative develops, begins to adopt the mannerisms, speech, and sensibilities of a Southern Black athlete he spends time with. Although the book was published in 1987, it was actually written in the 1970s.\n\nA 2011 class-action lawsuit in the United States District Court for Minnesota alleged that the administration at a predominantly white high school showed a \"deliberate indifference\" in allowing a group of students to hold a homecoming event called \"Wigger Day\", including \"Wigger Wednesday\" and \"Wangsta Day\", since at least 2008. A plaintiff named Quera Pruitt sought declaratory judgment and $75,000 in punitive damages from the defendants for creating a racially hostile environment. On July 24, 2012, the parties settled out of court, with Pruitt awarded $90,000.\n\n\n"}
