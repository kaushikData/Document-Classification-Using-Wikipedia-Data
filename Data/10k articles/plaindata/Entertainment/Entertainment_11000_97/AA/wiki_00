Fish foods normally contain macronutrients, trace elements and vitamins necessary to keep captive fish in good health. Approximately 80% of fishkeeping hobbyists feed their fish exclusively prepared foods that most commonly are produced in flake, pellet or tablet form. Pelleted forms, some of which sink rapidly, are often used for larger fish or bottom feeding species such as loaches or catfish. Some fish foods also contain additives such as sex hormones or beta carotene to artificially enhance the color of ornamental fish.\n\nPrepared foods are those foods that are non-living and are made by the aquarist or bought already prepared for consumption for fish.\n\nFlake food is a type of proprietary or artificially manufactured fish food consumed by a wide variety of tropical and saltwater fish and invertebrates. It is ideally suited to top dwellers and mid-water fish though numerous bottom dwelling species consume flake food once it has settled on the bottom. Flake food is baked to remove moisture, ensuring a longer shelf life. Generally the more moisture a particular example of fish food contains, the more readily it will deteriorate in quality.\n\nDry foods are also available as pellets, sticks, tablets, granules, and wafers, manufactured to float or sink, depending on the species they are designed to feed.\n\nVacation foods, also known as \"food blocks\" (or \"weekend blocks\" for smaller versions), are designed to be placed inside the aquarium to forgo feeding while the owner is absent. These blocks release small amounts of food as they dissolve. Food blocks can be a good choice for smaller tropical fish, but can pollute the water if the tank is neglected for too long.\n\nMedicated fishfood is a safe and effective method to deliver medication to fish. One advantage is that medicated food does not contaminate the aquatic environment and also, unlike bath treatments, does not negatively affect fish, filtration and algae growth in the aquarium. The parasites will get treated spot on by medicated food, because the fish is ingesting it.\n\nFreeze-dried and frozen fish foods were primarily developed for tropical and marine fish and are useful in providing variety to the diet or specialist feeding needs of some species. These include tubifex worms, mosquito larvae, bloodworms, water fleas (\"Daphnia\" and \"Cyclops\" spp.) along with brine shrimp (\"Artemia salina\").\n\nPerishable food can be preserved by frozen storage, and is often sold in blister packs or resealable packets. These can contain a variety of ingredients such as bloodworms, \"Daphnia\", or brine shrimp, and are commonly used to feed such fish as \"Discus\" which require a high protein diet. Often fed on beef heart fish food within the aquaculture industry, the discus fish are not the only fish which can benefit from a high quality prepared frozen mixture such as beef heart, although by far these are the fish most associated with this particular frozen food. \n\nLive fish food include earthworms, sludge worms, water fleas, bloodworms, and feeder fish. Food for larvae and young fish include infusoria (Protozoa and other microorganisms), newly hatched brine shrimp and microworms. These are the most preferred type of food for fishes,but are difficult to get. However, freeze dried forms of earthworms, tubifex etc. are available now.\n\nFish food should ideally provide the fish with fat (for energy) and amino acids (building blocks of proteins) and the fish food (whether flake or pellet) must be speedily digested in order to prevent buildup of intestinal gas, renal failure and infections (such as swim bladder problems and dropsy) and to avoid aquarium pollution due to excessive ammonia. Aquatic diets for carnivores must contain vegetable matter such as spirulina.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46229", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46229", "title": "Beyond the Fringe", "text": "Beyond the Fringe\n\nBeyond the Fringe was a British comedy stage revue written and performed by Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Alan Bennett, and Jonathan Miller. It played in London's West End and then in America, both on tour and on New York's Broadway in the early 1960s. Hugely successful, it is widely regarded as seminal to the \"satire boom\", the rise of satirical comedy in 1960s Britain.\n\nThe idea, of bringing together the best of revues by the Cambridge Footlights and The Oxford Revue, both of which had transferred to Fringe Festival for short runs in previous years, was conceived of, in 1960, by an Oxford graduate, Robert Ponsonby, artistic director for the Edinburgh International Festival. John Bassett, a graduate of Wadham College, Oxford, who was Ponsonby's assistant, recommended Dudley Moore, his jazz bandmate and a rising cabaret talent. Moore in turn recommended Alan Bennett, who had had a hit at Edinburgh a few years before. Bassett also chose Jonathan Miller, who had been a Footlights star in 1957. Miller recommended Cook.\n\nBennett and Miller were already pursuing careers in academia and medicine respectively, but Cook had an agent, having written a West End revue for Kenneth Williams. Cook's agent negotiated a higher weekly fee for him, but by the time the agent's fee was deducted Cook actually earned less than the others from the initial run.\n\nThe majority of the sketches were by Cook and were largely based on material written for other revues. Among the entirely new material were \"The End of the World\", \"TVPM\" and \"The Great Train Robbery\". Cook and Moore revived some of the sketches on their later television and stage shows, most famously the two-hander \"One Leg Too Few\".\n\nThe show's runs in Edinburgh and the provinces had a lukewarm response, but when the revue transferred to the Fortune Theatre in London, in a revised production by Donald Albery and William Donaldson, it became a sensation, thanks in some part to a favourable review by Kenneth Tynan.\n\nIn 1962 the show transferred to the John Golden Theatre in New York, with its original cast. President John F. Kennedy attended a performance on 10 February 1963. The show continued in New York, with most of the original cast, until 1964, when Paxton Whitehead replaced Miller, while the London version continued with a different cast until 1966.\n\nThe revue was widely considered to be ahead of its time, both in its unapologetic willingness to debunk figures of authority, and by virtue of its inherently surrealistic comedic vein. Humiliation of authority was something only previously delved into in \"The Goon Show\" and, arguably, \"Hancock's Half Hour\", with such parliamentarians as Sir Winston Churchill and Harold Macmillan coming under special scrutiny — although the BBC were predisposed to frown upon it. Macmillan — according to Cook — was not particularly fond of the slurred caricature and charade of senile forgetfulness (marked by a failure to pronounce 'Conservative Party' coherently) handed down on him in Cook's impersonation. Since \"Beyond the Fringe\" was not owned by the BBC, however, the quartet enjoyed relative carte blanche. The only protocol they were obliged to adhere to was that their scripts be sent to the Lord Chamberlain for approval prior to performance. This requirement was abolished in 1968.\n\nMost specifically, its lampooning of the British war effort in a sketch titled \"The Aftermyth of the War\" was scorned by some war veterans for its supposed insensitivity. One British visitor to the Broadway performance was said to have stood up and shouted 'rotters!' at a sketch he found distasteful, before apparently sitting down again and enjoying the remainder of the show, while another, at the first performance in Edinburgh allegedly stood up and declared that the 'young bounders don't know the first thing about it!' and promptly left the auditorium. In response to these negative audience reactions, the \"Beyond the Fringe\" team insisted that they were not ridiculing the efforts of those involved in the war, but were challenging the subsequent media portrayal of them.\n\n\"Beyond the Fringe\" was a forerunner to British television programmes \"That Was the Week That Was\", \"At Last the 1948 Show\" and \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\".\nAs with the established comedy revue, it was a series of satirical sketches and musical pieces using a minimal set, looking at events of the day. It effectively represented the views and disappointments of the first generation of British people to grow up after World War II, and gave voice to a sense of the loss of national purpose with the end of the British Empire. Although all of the cast contributed material, the most often quoted pieces were those by Cook, many of which had appeared before in his Cambridge Footlights revues. The show broke new ground with Peter Cook's impression of then Prime Minister Harold Macmillan; on one occasion, this was performed with Macmillan in the audience, and Cook added an \"ad lib\" ridiculing Macmillan for turning up to watch. In 2006, Jonathan Miller recounted that the breach of decorum this represented was a source of embarrassment to both audience and performers.\n\nThe show is credited with giving many other performers the courage to be satirical and more improvisational in their manner, and broke the conventions of not lampooning the Royal Family or the government of the day. Shakespearean drama was another target of their comedy. There were also a number of musical items in the show, using Dudley Moore's music, most famously an arrangement of the Colonel Bogey March which resists Moore's repeated attempts to bring it to an end.\n\nThe show prefigured the Satire Boom of the 1960s. Without it, there might not have been either \"That Was the Week That Was\" or \"Private Eye\", the satirical magazine which originated at the same time, that partially survived due to financial support from Peter Cook, and that served as the model for the later American \"Spy Magazine\". Cook and Moore formed a comedy team and appeared in the popular television show \"Not Only... But Also\", and the 1967 film \"Bedazzled\". Cook also launched his club, The Establishment, around this time. Many of the members of Monty Python recall being inspired by \"Beyond the Fringe\".\n\nThe retrospective show \"Before the Fringe\", broadcast during the early years of BBC 2, took its title from this production. It consisted of performances of material that was popular in theatrical revue before the advent of \"Beyond the Fringe\".\n\nThe show's success was not limited to the UK. In 1962, it also opened in South Africa. Next it arrived in the US. First the Broadway Company opened on 27 October 1962, then it was performed by the National Company in 1963. Subsequently, opening on 8 October 1964, the National Touring Company took it on a nationwide tour for six months as \"Beyond the Fringe '65\" under the auspices of Alexander H. Cohen, with the cast consisting of Robert Cessna, Donald Cullen, Joel Fabiani, and James Valentine. Slight changes were made to adapt the show for American audiences, for instance the opening number (discussing America) was retitled \"Home Thoughts from Abroad\".\n\nThe show was revived in slightly altered form in Los Angeles in 2000 and 2001 by Joseph Dunn's ReEstablishment Theater to critical acclaim.\n\nAll four original members of Beyond the Fringe feature prominently in the play \"\", by Chris Bartlett and Nick Awde, although performed by other actors. Appropriately, the comedy drama had a sellout run at the 2005 Edinburgh Festival Fringe before transferring to London's West End at The Venue, in 2006, in a version starring Kevin Bishop as Moore, Tom Goodman-Hill as Cook, Fergus Craig as Alan Bennett and Colin Hoult as Jonathan Miller. It subsequently embarked on a nationwide tour. Most recently, Beyond the Fringe was recreated for an episode of the Netflix TV series The Crown in which Prime Minister Macmillan is attendance, and singled out for abuse by Peter Cook (performed by Patrick Warner.) The creation, performance and aftermath of the show is covered in the 2004 film Not Only But Always.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26550165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26550165", "title": "Bloodline Champions", "text": "Bloodline Champions\n\nBloodline Champions (BLC) is a free-to-play action game developed by the Swedish company Stunlock Studios. \"Bloodline Champions\" won both \"Game of the Year\" and \"Winner XNA\" in the Swedish Game Awards 2009. The game officially launched in the United States on January 13, 2011. The spiritual successor to the game, \"Battlerite\", created by the same developer Stunlock Studios, was released as a free-to-play game on November 7, 2017.\n\nThe players in this game are split up into two teams (Warm and Cold) with up to five players per team. The objective is different depending on the game mode, ranging from team deathmatch and capture-the-flag to map point control.\n\nMain features:\n\nThere are four categories of bloodlines (character archetypes): melee attack, ranged attack, healer, and tank. There are currently 26 bloodlines, with six or seven in each category. Stunlock Studios have announced that they are working on new bloodlines. Each bloodline has seven abilities, two of which have an EX version, an enhanced version of the ability. Each has its own cooldown, as well as triggering short global cooldowns. The seventh ability is an \"ultimate\" ability that may only be used after gaining sufficient energy through executing other abilities successfully, such as healing allies, damaging enemies, and otherwise helping your team.\n\nBloodlines also have HP (Health Points) - when the champion runs out of HP, the champion dies, removing it from combat until the end of the round. Each champion also has two items that grant additional abilities. The Bloodline Medallion allows a champion to recover an increasing amount of HP over a period of time and Resurrect revives nearby fallen teammates. Both items require a significant amount of uninterrupted time to prepare, which makes them impractical in immediate combat. In Conquest and Capture The Artifact modes resurrection skill has been replaced with warp skill that allows you to warp a short distance every 20 seconds.\n\nThe controls in Bloodline Champions are similar to a first-person shooter, as the bloodline's movement is controlled using the W, A, S, and D keys. The primary two abilities are mapped to the left and right mouse buttons, and the rest of the abilities are used with the Q, E, R, F, and space keys. Almost all the abilities are aimed, where the direction of the ability is determined by the position of the cursor on the screen relative to the champion's position. There are two different camera modes; Free Look and Static. The static camera stays over the characters head at all times regardless of the location of the players cursor. The Free Look camera allows the player to control their camera with the cursor. A few defensive abilities are directed by hovering the cursor on the desired recipient, and some abilities target a specific location on the playing field.\n\nBloodline Champions also features fog of war which represents the areas of the map which cannot be seen due to visual obstruction or distance. There are obstacles on the map which create fog of war and inhibit movement. Champions have their own collision, which can be used to inhibit movement and protect allies (for example a tank bloodline will have a larger collision size, making it easier to defend teammates by blocking fire, but also being more susceptible to focus fire).\n\nBloodline Champions has 27 characters split into 4 archetypes: tank, ranged damage, melee damage, and healer. Tanks are generally close-quarters fighters and specialize in defense as well as peeling; removing pressure from allies by putting equal pressure on enemies. Ranged damage characters have lower health and deal high damage from a safe distance. They generally have many ways to escape melee combat but are taken down quickly if outmaneuvered. These bloodlines generally deal the most damage but must be in close range and have slightly higher health than ranged damage bloodlines. They tend to have very limited ways to control fights aside from their high damage output. Healers, as the title implies, keep their allies alive through a mix of powerful control and healing abilities. They have the lowest health of all bloodlines and generally lack mobility options other characters enjoy.\n\nBloodline Champions has several game modes that provide different types of gameplay. The central game mode is Arena, as it is the only one available through matchmaking.\n\nPlayers can face an engaging challenge in competing in 2v2, 3v3 and 5v5 arenas.\n\nThe objective is to capture both artifacts and bring them back to your own base. Each team begins with one artifact in their base, and the first team to hold both artifacts for a period of time wins the round. The artifacts can be carried and thrown, but lifting one from its starting position takes time and can be interrupted by attacks. The carrier may drop the artifact by using certain abilities as well as receiving attacks by specific enemy abilities. When dropped, the artifact can be instantly picked up after it has sat for a short delay.\n\nIn Conquest, the players have an infinite amount of respawns but the delay before respawning can increase with time. The teams battle for a number of capture points, and if one team holds all of them, the other team cannot respawn until they capture one of the capture points. To capture a point, the player must stay at that point for a period of time without taking damage or using abilities. The starting point provides a healing aura to the team that started there, and power rune pickups are distributed across the map, allowing champions to temporarily boost their capabilities. A team wins by either killing all the enemy champions while they cannot respawn, or holding the capture points for a set amount of time.\n\nBloodline Champions is Free-to-Play (F2P). Bloodlines rotate every day, so there are always four available Bloodlines, one of each archetype. Players earn Blood Coins and spend them on additional Bloodlines, titles, avatars and other visual perks. None of the purchasable items give an edge in gameplay since there are no weapons with higher damage, for example, but they create more variety and choices in gameplay and appearance. Players can also choose to buy Funcom Points by using real money. Funcom Points serve the same purpose as Blood Coins, but they are bought using real currency instead of earned through in-game accomplishments. All marketplace items cost significantly less Funcom Points than Blood Coins.\n\n\"Bloodline Champions\" received mainly favorable reviews from critics; on aggregate review website Metacritic the game attains an overall score of 79 out of 100.\n\nStrategy Informer gave BLC a score of 85% in their review, while PC Gamer gave 75%. Servers are located in Europe and USA; at this time there are no servers in Australia, South America, Africa, or Asia, but there is no area restriction whatsoever, so players in these regions are also able to play.\n\nAs of right now, Bloodline Champions has a small player base. As of August 18, 2015, the playerbase peaks at ~1000 simultaneous players online.\n\nAt release Bloodline Champions announced their participation in DreamHack Summer a LAN tournament with BLC having a $10,000 US prize pool. This helped contribute to the games initial success as a competitive arena game. Since release BLC has had multiple cash prize tournaments hosted by DreamHack and GLHF.gg for a total of $11,600 prize money as of July 11, 2011.\n\nPivotal Gamers awarded it a score of 8.1 out of 10 based on its overall performance across the WEB, categorizing it as a great game to play.\n\n"}
{"id": "46656018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46656018", "title": "Braschi's Empire of Dreams", "text": "Braschi's Empire of Dreams\n\nEmpire of Dreams (El imperio de los sueños, 1988) is a postmodern book of poetry by Giannina Braschi, who is widely considered \"one of the most revolutionary voices in Latin American literature today\". In 1988, \"Empire of Dreams\" debuted in Spain to acclaim as \"El imperio de los sueños\", with an English translation by Tess O'Dwyer later inaugurating the Yale Library of World Literature in Translation (1994). Composed from 1980 to 1986, this series represents the first major phase of Braschi's oeuvre: poetry written entirely in classical and modern Spanish.\n\nForming a hybrid of prose poetry, drama, musical theater, manifesto, gossip, autobiography, diary, literary theory, and antinovel, \"Empire of Dreams\" is a mixed genre trilogy on the culture of excess. The central axis of this epic poem is the Latin American immigrant's optimistic new life in the \"Big Apple\", which is dramatized by Braschi as the epicenter of the American Dream. However, social and linguistic references to other Latin cities and neighborhoods abound, such as \"the Latin American Quarter in Paris, the \"barrio chino barcelonés\", the \"zaguanes\" of Borges's Buenos Aires, and the colonial houses in Old San Juan\".\n\nThe author later wrote the first full-length Spanglish novel \"Yo-Yo Boing!\" and a controversial work of political fiction in English, \"United States of Banana\", which provides a scathing critique of the false promise of meritocracy within the American Dream.\n\n\"Empire of Dreams\" deals with issues of artistic creation, immigration, commercialism, capitalism, identity crisis, sexual and gender ambiguity, and revolution. The narrator journeys through a \"phantasmagoria of internal and external trials in order to experience the center—of political power, of meaning, of feeling, and of personal identity\".\n\nThe work has been compared structurally to the Chinese box and the Matryoshka doll, given that the book has six books inside.\n\nPart one, \"Assault on Time\", is a sequence of meditative prose poems on the subject of love lost and the ineptitude of language and grammar to communicate emotions. It is Braschi's first book of poetry and it begins with the breaking of silence: \"Behind the word is silence./Behind what sounds is the door\". Letters take on a life of their own, roaming the streets of New York, and punctuation marks, such as colons and semicolons denote pivotal points in a relationship.\n\nPart two, \"Profane Comedy\", turns loud as the poet pays homage to the evolution of poetry and performance, especially comedia dell'arte. \"Profane Comedy\" is composed of four books of poetry, each with humorous gusto and a flair for the grotesque: 1. \"Book of Clowns and Buffoons\", 2. \"Poems of the World; or The Book of Wisdom\", 3. \"Pastoral; or, The Inquisition of Memories\", and 4. \"Song of Nothingness\". Throughout, Braschi intermingles television jingles and pop songs by the likes of The Beatles and Madonna with poems of the Spanish Golden Age. References include Luis de León, Miguel de Cervantes, Lope de Vega, Luis de Góngora, Garcilaso de la Vega, and Francisco Quevedo, while cameo appearances are made by poets, painters, philosophers, and composers, such as: César Vallejo, Rimbaud, Goethe, Nietzsche, Shakespeare, Breughal, Beethoven, Van Gogh, and Picasso, among others. Quotations of classical poets abound, transformed by the appropriating hand of a joyful poet who uses the \"sampling technique of rap music\" and hip hop. Though Braschi writes with a strong literary tradition behind her and from an erudite standpoint, \"she imbues her text with jollity and a brilliant energy\". The text unfolds through a series of violent and surreal theatrical scenes performed by clowns, buffoons, shepherds, lead soldiers, magicians, madmen, witches, and fortune tellers. These gender-bending migrant characters attack and occupy the American mainstream, including business centers and tourist attractions. In a climatic episode of \"Pastoral ; or, the Inquisition of Memories\", shepherds cause traffic jams on 5th Avenue during the Puerto Rican Day Parade, ring the bells of St. Patrick's Cathedral and take over the observation deck of the Empire State Building where they dance and sing: \"Now we do whatever we please, whatever we please, whatever we damn well please\".\n\nPart three, \"Intimate Diary of Solitude,\" is a lighthearted antinovel that mocks the Latin American Boom and dictator novels. The composition is a mix-mash of flash fiction, pop songs, tabloid, commercials, diary excerpts, political and literary manifestos, performance art, ending with a philosophical treatise on the writer's role in the modern age. The heroine Mariquita Samper, a Macy's make-up artist who dreams of being a star, calls for a revolution of \"poetic eggs\" and shoots the narrator of Latin American Boom novels (such as \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\") who keeps rewriting her own diary in order to turn it into a bestseller. The debate between quality and originality versus fame and fortune is a constant theme in \"Empire of Dreams\". The work closes with a quotation from an anonymous poem of Medieval Spanish literature, a line from \"El Conde Arnaldos\": \"I only sing my song/to whomever follows me\".\n\nGiannina Braschi credits T.S. Eliot's \"The Waste Land\" as the single most impactful English language poem to inform the rhythmic shifts and the inspiration from which she creates a chorus of anonymous voices to capture the collective conscience of the masses. Feminist scholar and poet Alicia Ostriker notes in the introduction to \"Empire of Dreams\" that the poet's voice sounds decidedly \"macho\" and yet it can be theoretically \"paired with Luisa Valenzuela, Clarice Lispector, Luce Irigaray, Helene Cixous, and Marguerite Duras, and obviously she owes a great deal to Gertrude Stein\". Braschi has published scholarly works on Spanish language poetry by Cervantes, Garcilaso, Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer, Antonio Machado, Federico García Lorca, and César Vallejo, from whose work she quotes throughout \"Empire of Dreams\". In an interview with NBC Latino, Braschi identified her favorite poet as César Vallejo: \"Vallejo is a jack-in-the-box who performs the movement of my spirit. No matter how much you push him down into the box, the poet always bounces back to affirm his love for life\".\n\nGiannina Braschi, a National Endowment for the Arts fellow, is considered an influential and revolutionary voice in contemporary Latin American literature. She is the author of the postmodern poetry classic \"El imperio de los sueños/Empire of Dreams\" (1988), the Spanglish dramatic novel \"Yo-Yo Boing!\", and the postcolonial dramatic novel \"United States of Banana\" (2011). Her collective work explores the politics of empire and independence, while capturing the trials and tribulations of the Latin American immigrant in the United States. She has won awards and grants from National Endowment for the Arts, New York Foundation for the Arts, PEN American Center, Ford Foundation, InterAmericas, Danforth Scholarship, Reed Foundation, El Diario, Rutgers University, and Puerto Rican Institute for Culture. With the publication of \"United States of Banana\", \"CARAS\" Magazine named Braschi one of the most influential Puerto Ricans in 2012.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1183423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1183423", "title": "Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips", "text": "Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips\n\nBugs Bunny Nips the Nips is a 1944 \"Merrie Melodies\" cartoon directed by Friz Freleng.\n\nSomewhere in the Pacific, Bugs is floating in a box, singing to himself, when 'the island that inevitably turns up in this kind of picture' turns up. Bugs swims towards it, and admires the peace and quiet, when bombs start going off (\"The Storm\" from the \"William Tell Overture\" is also heard in the background). Bugs ducks into a haystack, and soon comes face to face with a Japanese soldier; a short, buck-toothed, bare-footed Japanese man who says his 'Ls' as 'Rs' and who might be rapidly stating the names of Japanese cities whenever he moves. The soldier chases Bugs to a rabbit hole, where the soldier dumps a bomb inside. However, Bugs manages to blow the soldier up with the bomb. When the soldier tries to swing a sword at Bugs, Bugs appears as a Japanese general (presumably Hideki Tojo), but is soon recognized by his trademark carrot eating, prompting the soldier (who says he saw Bugs in the \"Warner Bros. Leon Schlesinger \"Merrie Melodies\" cartoon pictures\", referring to the fact that Bugs was originally exclusive to that series) to ask him \"What's up, Honorable Doc?\"\n\nBugs then jumps into a plane and the soldier also jumps into a plane. However, Bugs ties the soldier's plane to a tree, causing the plane to be yanked out from under him. The soldier parachutes down, but is met by Bugs in mid-air, who hands \"Moto\" (cf. Mr. Moto) some 'scrap iron' (an anvil), causing the soldier to fall. Painting a Japanese flag on a tree to denote one soldier down, Bugs runs into a sumo wrestler, whom he confidently faces off against (cockily marking a second bigger flag on the tree). After getting temporarily beaten by the sumo wrestler (and, to be fair, wipes the second mark off the tree before collapsing), Bugs dresses as a geisha girl and knocks the wrestler out, who repaints a second flag on the tree before passing out.\n\nSeeing a bunch of Japanese landing craft making their way to the island (exclaiming \"Japs! Hundreds of 'em!\"), Bugs thinks of a plan to get rid of all of them. He comes out in a 'Good Rumor' (a parody of Good Humor) truck, which plays Mozart (\"Der Vogelfänger bin ich ja\" from \"The Magic Flute\"). Bugs hands each of the Japanese an ice cream bar with a grenade inside it, calling them racist slurs such as \"monkey-face\" and \"slant-eyes\" whilst doing so. All the Japanese are killed off from the explosions, save for one who was killed after redeeming a 'free' ice cream bar from Bugs. Having now painted dozens of Japanese flags on the trees denoting all the downed enemy, Bugs comments again about the 'peace and quiet – and if there's one thing I CAN'T stand, it's peace and quiet!'.\n\nBugs spots an American battleship in the distance and raises a white flag, yelling for them to come get him, but they keep going. Bugs is insulted. \"Do they think I want to spend the rest of my life on this island?\" With this remark, a female rabbit (dressed in a more Hawaiian outfit) appears saying, \"It's a possibility!\" Bugs then pulls down the distress flag, lets out a wolf cry and goes running after her.\n\nThe films depicting the Japanese enemy during World War II tended to both identify a formidable wartime adversary and to depict said adversary as inferior to its American counterparts. In cartoons, this translated to a tendency to depict the Japanese as either superman or buffoon. This film closer represents the latter tendency. The caricature portrayal of this film serves as a host to well-worn stereotypes.\n\nThe film opens with Bugs singing from within a crate. He is somewhere in the Pacific and is waiting for the inevitable island to turn up. He then sees an island and swims towards its beach. Already in the introduction, Bugs identifies his Pacific island setting as a \"garden of Eden and a \"Shangri-La\". This in reference to the exotic havens depicted in South Sea island films and to the epic film \"Lost Horizon\" (1937). Only then is Bugs alerted to the mortal danger that awaits him on the island. The seductive first impression serves to set up a hazardous trap.\n\nBugs escapes rapid gunfire by running for cover into a haystack. The initial encounter of Bugs with a Japanese soldier presents an optical illusion, that the two share a body. Bugs' head peeks above the haystack, while the legs of the soldier appear below it. Then the owner of the feet confronts Bugs. The soldier has buck teeth, a thin mustache, dark eyeglasses, slanted eyebrows and curly, wavy hair.\n\nThe soldier pulls out a sword and starts swiping at Bugs. He speaks in Oriental-sounding gibberish, consisting of short syllables spoken in a staccato voice. In response, Bugs assumes the form of a Japanese general and stands stiffly at attention. Bugs' face is briefly transformed into a Japanese caricature, only to be contrasted with the face of an actual, if impish, Japanese soldier. Bugs disguised as a general imitates photographs of Hideki Tojo. The soldier bows in supplication to the authority figure. Bugs accidentally gives away his identity by casually chewing on a carrot.\n\nThe soldier resumes use of his sword and talks gibberish again. Bugs takes off in a Japanese plane, followed by the soldier in his own plane. Both planes are presumably based on the Mitsubishi A6M Zero. Bugs ties the rival plane to a tree. The soldier parachutes out and Bugs hands him an anvil. Mocking: \"Here's some scrap iron for Japan, Moto.\" There is a spoken reference to Mr. Moto to provide a well-acquainted name to the wartime enemy.\n\nBugs then bumps into a sumo wrestler. The man is huge with a large stomach, a mustache, a goatee, buck teeth with a large gap between the front teeth, and a Mohawk hairstyle. In response, Bugs transforms into a geisha. He speaks in Japanese-sounding gibberish and coaxes the wrestler into a near kiss. The kiss turns into a fatal blow with a mallet. Bugs triumphantly shouts \"timber\" as the man falls. The masquerade scene involving the wrestler and the geisha makes use of two relatively harmless civilian-type characters to cast the enemy in a humorous light. In concept, it suggests that an Oriental guise can be put on and discarded at will.\n\nBugs then sees several Japanese ships floating towards the island. He is next seen disguised as Ice cream car vendor in the mold of the Good Humor man. He entices many Japanese soldiers to come get their ice cream. There are many Japanese soldiers besieging Bugs' ice cream truck. Suggesting that their threat relies on their numbers. They are an easily fooled mob, not a group of individuals. They resemble a swarm of bees and they are rendered less as human figures and more like a scourge in need of extermination.\n\nBugs insults his customers by calling them \"monkey face\" and \"slant eyes\". The scene with the ice cream track partially obscures the faces and bodies of the enemy soldiers, but Bugs verbalizes a physical description. The phrases \"bowlegs\", \"monkey face\", \"slant eyes\" both serve as racial epithets and audibly support the visualized stereotypes of the film. They are all elements of the Japanese wartime caricature.\n\nThey get served with chocolate-covered ice cream bars embedded with grenades. The soldiers run off as soon as they get served. Then numerous explosions are heard. One battered soldier returns to present his specially-marked stick, earning him a free ice cream bar. He is the last one. Bugs' mission is accomplished. He then signals an American ship to come get him.\n\nBugs hates being confined to a world of \"peace and quiet\". He celebrates the approach of an American ship and his potential rescue, until he meets a sarong-clad female bunny. The female bunny ignites his passion. He howls and thumps his foot, his eyes bulging from their sockets. He leaps into an amorous pursuit and the film ends.\n\nThe short placed an emphasis on physical peculiarities to imply racial inferiority. The preeminent danger is positioned to be treachery and not military might. The Japanese are distinctively othered as physically deformed. The Japanese are characterized as single-minded, subservient to their superiors and gullible. The gag with the ice cream-seeking soldiers makes use of the American perception of the Japanese as both gullible and greedy. Bugs' stereotypical portrayal of Japanese womanhood renders him a meek and seductive creature, speaking in a falsetto voice.\n\nThe short has similarities to both \"Wackiki Wabbit\" (1943) and \"Herr Meets Hare\" (1945). The soundtrack includes \"Trade Winds\" and \"Someone's Rocking My Dreamboat\". There are two musical quotations from \"Die Walküre\" (1870) by Richard Wagner. The Japanese soldiers are repeatedly presented on screen to the tune of the \"Kimigayo\" (1870) The ice cream truck scene uses the tune of the opening aria of Papageno, from \"The Magic Flute\" (1791) by Mozart. When Bugs professes his hatred of the peace and quiet, demanding someone to get him out of this place, the tune is the \"Ride of the Valkyries\".\n\nNeil Lerner attempts to decipher Carl Stalling's intentions in quoting Wagner at the end of the battle scenes. He suggests that it is connected to the role of the Valkyries, taking fallen warriors to Valhalla. In this case, the use is ironic as Stalling would not view the deceased Japanese soldiers as fallen heroes who deserve an afterlife paradise.\n\nAs Bugs signals the American ship, the tune is from the scene where Brünnhilde announces her pregnancy. Lerner suggests that Stalling was inspired by the name of Siegfried, \"peace through victory\". Stalling could intend the scene to represent the United States reaching such a peace. Alternatively, he might be inspired by the stark isolation of Brünnhilde on a rocky mountain – in which case, the reference would have been Bugs being trapped on the island.\n\n\n\"Bugs Bunny, castaway on a Pacific isle, thinks the setting is ideal until he finds his paradise infested with Japanese soldiers. How he single-handedly exterminates the enemy makes for a laugh-filled few minutes of typical Bugs antics, off-screen remarks and action in this Technicolor cartoon produced by Leon Schlesinger.\"\n\n\n"}

They were known for their BBC children's programme \"ChuckleVision\", which celebrated its twenty-first series with a 2010 stage tour entitled \"An Audience with the Chuckle Brothers\". The comedy of the Chuckle Brothers usually derived from slapstick, wordplay and other visual gags, and their catchphrases included \"To me, to you\" and \"Oh dear, oh dear\".\n\nThe brothers were born in Rotherham to Amy and James Patton Elliott, in 1944 and 1947. Their father was a Gang Show performer whose stage name was Gene Patton; he worked with the 18-year-old Peter Sellers in 1943 in The No. 10 Gang and gave performances in London, Orkney and the Hebrides, Iceland, the Far East, India, and Burma. Their two older brothers, Jimmy and Brian, are known professionally as the Patton Brothers and have appeared in \"ChuckleVision\", Jimmy as the nameless character known colloquially as \"No Slacking\", and Brian as another unnamed character known as \"Getoutofit\".\n\nThe Chuckle Brothers won the television talent show \"Opportunity Knocks\" in 1967, followed by success on \"New Faces\" in 1974. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the two brothers began their television careers as a double act, making their debut in April 1979 on the BBC comedy series \"Lennie and Jerry\", hosted by Lennie Bennett and Jerry Stevens. They made two appearances on the game show \"3-2-1\", hosted by Ted Rogers, in January 1980 and April 1982, and appeared on the long-running BBC programme, \"The Good Old Days\", in June 1980. In August 1983, the Brothers appeared on \"The Freddie Starr Showcase\" alongside the comedian Freddie Starr.\n\nTheir primary work was mainly focused on children's television, beginning initially on Christmas Day in 1980 with them taking part in a televised children's show, \"A Merry Morning\", in which the brothers entertained around 250 children from the Leeds area in Yeadon Town Hall.\n\nIn 1985, the brothers launched a pre-school programme on the BBC entitled \"Chuckle Hounds\", in which they performed routines with no dialogue, while dressed up in giant dog costumes. Their success in children's television came in 1987, with the launch of their iconic children's show, \"ChuckleVision\", in which their real-life siblings Jimmy and Brian Patton made occasional appearances. The show proved a ratings hit with children, running for twenty-one series over a period of twenty-two years, and giving them a Special Award for Lifetime Achievement at the British Academy Children's Awards in 2008. The final series of the programme was aired in December 2009.\n\nThe two contributed further to children's entertainment, performing at the \"Children's Royal Variety Performance\" in May 1992, and launching a children's game show titled \"To Me, To You!\", which ran between 1996 and 1998 and which took its name from their signature catchphrase.\n\nOutside of children's entertainment, the brothers have made appearances in many other television series, both together and separately. In May 2008, the they appeared in the BBC documentary series \"Comedy Map of Britain\", and won the 2010 series of \"Celebrity Coach Trip\". In November 2011, the brothers starred in a series of TV advertisements for the UK-based van insurance comparison website \"Van Compare.com\" In October 2012, they appeared on \"Comedy World Cup\" on \"Channel 4\", while on 15 March 2013, they were featured in David Walliams' sketch for \"Comic Relief.\" From 2013 to 2014, Barry made a number of appearances in the BBC comedy series \"Still Open All Hours\" as dog owner Mr Marshall, first appearing in the role for the 2013 Christmas special. On 13 March 2015, they appeared again on Comic Relief, this time in a sketch based around \"National Treasures\". The duo appeared at the 2016 \"Royal Variety Performance\", performing sketches with host David Walliams. In April 2018, it was announced the brothers were in the process of recording a new clip show for Channel 5, entitled \"Chuckle Time\"; It ran for one series during the summer of that year, although it was cut short following the death of Barry Elliot in August 2018.\n\nAs well as regular TV appearances, Paul and Barry appeared on stage in venues across the UK. Their annual nationwide tours often included them performing with The Patton Brothers, magic duo \"Safire\", \"The Magic Light Puppet Company\" as well a full cast. Their comedy and parody shows have included \"The Blackpool Tower Circus\" (1974, 1987), \"To You To Me\" (1995), \"The Chuckle Brothers in Trouble\" (1996), \"The Chuckle Brothers Summer Roadshow\" (1997), \"The Adventures of The Chuckle Brothers\" (1998), \"The Chuckle Brothers Trouble At Sea\" (1999), \"The New Adventures of The Chuckle Brothers\" (2000), \"Spooky Goings On\" (2001), \"Raiders of the Lost Bark\" (2002), \"Star Doors - The Chuckle Brothers Strike Back\" (2003), \"Barry Potty and his Smarter Brother Paul in The Chamber of Horrors\" (2004), \"Pirates of the River Rother\" (2005), \"Doctor What and the Return of the Garlics\" (2006), \"Spooky Goings on 2\" (2007), \"Aladdin\" (Christmas 2007), \"Indiana Chuckles and the Kingdom of the Mythical Sulk\" (2008), \"Chuckle Trek - The Lost Generation\" (2009), \"A Christmas Chuckle\" (Christmas 2009), \"An Audience With...The Chuckle Brothers\" (2010), \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" (Christmas 2010), \"Barry Potty and his Full Blood Brother Paul in the Ghostly Shadows\" (2011), \"The Return of the Pirates of the River Rother 2: In Strangers Tights\" (2012), \"The Chuckle Brothers meet the Phantom at the Theatre\" (2013), \"A 2014 Space Oddity\" (2014) and \"The Chuckles of Oz\" (2015).\n\nLive recordings of \"Pirates of the River Rother\" and \"Spooky Goings On 2\" were released on DVD 2007, the latter under the title \"The Chuckle Brothers – Spooky Goings On Live!\" A box set of the two was also made available. A dress rehearsal of the duo's 1996 tour \"The Chuckle Brothers in Trouble\" was released on DVD in 2008. In addition, the brothers' 2008 tour, \"Indiana Chuckles and The Kingdom of the Mythical Sulk\", set in Ancient Egypt, was released on DVD later that year.\n\nThe brothers toured theatres annually with their shows until 2015. Although, they performed regularly in pantomimes, festivals, events and holiday parks until Barry's death in 2018.\n\nDuring their career, Paul and Barry performed in fifty one pantomimes together. Their first was \"Babes in the Wood\", which they performed as \"The Harman Brothers\" in Malvern from 1967 until 1968 with Sandy Powell. Their final pantomime became \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" at The Mayflower Theatre in Southampton, which they appeared in from 2017 until 2018 with Craig Revel Horwood. They were awarded a \"Great British Pantomime Award\" for Best Double Act for this production. Since Barry's death, Paul has stated his intention to continue to appear in pantomime productions.\n\nFrom 2014 until 2018, the brothers made appearances at various nightclubs and student events, performing sets and posing for photographs. After Barry's death, Paul stated that he would continue with these appearances.\n\nIn March 2016, the brothers appeared in a promotional video for the game Hitman.\n\nIn October 1995, the Chuckle Brothers released an album entitled \"To You to Me\" featuring eleven tracks. Many of the tracks were based on their catchphrases, such as \"To me, to you\" and \"Silly You, Silly Me\".\n\nIn October 2014, the Chuckle Brothers collaborated with Tinchy Stryder to release a charity single \"To Me, To You (Bruv)\" to raise funds for the African-Caribbean Leukaemia Trust.\n\nIn September 2015, the Brothers performed for twenty minutes at the music festival Bestival, citing it as the biggest crowd they had ever performed in front of.\n\nIn July 2016 the Chuckle Brothers released their first mobile app for Android and iOS titled \"Chuckle World\". It is a quiz game with Tinder style sliding mechanics and endless style mobile gameplay.\n\nIn November 2005, Jacques Peretti, a reporter for \"The Guardian\", remarked on how \"the appeal of the Chuckle Brothers remains a mystery to anyone over eight, but to anyone under eight, they're the ultimate entertainment experience\". \"The little people think they're hilarious, and if you add up all the little people across the country who think they're hilarious, you'd think it's \"ChuckleVision\" that should have the 28 comedy gongs, not \"Little Britain\" or \"The Office\".\"\n\nOn 31 January 2007, Rotherham United chairman Denis Coleman announced that the brothers had both been made honorary presidents of the football club.\n\nIn 2008, they were honoured with the Special Award at the British Academy Children's Awards.\n\nThe brothers regularly appeared at events and openings, an example being the unveiling of the Tropical Butterfly House, Wildlife and Falconry Centre in North Anston in July 2013, which Barry attended. Supporters of Rotherham United Football Club, they were made Honorary Life Presidents of the club in 2007.\n\nBoth brothers were married – Barry was married to Ann and Paul is married to Sue. Both brothers seem to have been smokers, although Paul had apparently stopped the habit by 2000. Paul lives in , Doncaster, whilst his brother Barry lived in Ravenfield, Rotherham, before his death.\n\nIn April 2007, whilst on holiday on the Greek island of Cephalonia, Paul broke his nose and suffered cuts and bruises when he lost control of his motorcycle after suddenly braking to avoid a goatherd and herd. Instead of helping him, tourists who stopped at the accident shouted the Chuckle Brothers' catchphrase, \"To me, to you.\"\n\nAn urban legend surrounding Barry Chuckle's supposed death from a heart attack has circulated since at least 2008. In 2010, the brothers issued a statement on their website stating that the story was \"complete and utter rubbish\". The BBC reported that the death hoaxes had upset young viewers, and had shocked Barry when they re-surfaced. The hoax was said to have initially spread via Facebook in 2008, but re-surfaced in 2010 via Twitter.\n\nIn December 2015, Paul was caught speeding in a 40 mph zone. As a result of his actions he chose to undertake a speed awareness course, as opposed to accepting three penalty points and a fine. He reportedly stated at the time that he was \"a careful driver\" who had previously never \"been done\" in the fifty years that he had been driving.\n\nIn December 2010, Barry announced his support for a proposal that one of the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government's planned free schools, a taxpayer-funded school independent of the local authority, should be established in Rotherham. In January 2011, it was announced that Barry had planned to incorporate a 100-pupil free school named \"Rotherham Central Free School\" in his hometown of Rotherham. His son's partner was to serve as the head teacher of the school. By February 2012, no premises, staff or pupils for the school had been confirmed, despite announcing an intention on opening in September of that year.\n\nIn February 2014, the Chuckle Brothers attended the trial of Dave Lee Travis. Paul stated that it was a \"complete shock\" that such an attack had occurred in their presence. After giving evidence, the Brothers posed for a selfie outside Southwark Crown Court with Paul tweeting it to thousands of followers on his Twitter account. The Brothers had smiled whilst taking the photograph, and later some deemed their actions as inappropriate.\n\nIn March 2016, Barry received condemnation for sharing a Facebook post from the far right-wing political party Britain First. The post, originally shared in June 2015, called on politicians to strip migrants of their citizenship if they left the country to join a terror group. Following the unearthing of the post, Tommy Robinson, former leader of the English Defence League (EDL) came to Barry's defence, calling on people to \"leave the man alone\". Britain First subsequently described the incident as a \"non-story\".\n\nOn 5 August 2018, Barry died after a period of ill health. Paul grieved Barry's death stating \"I've not just lost my brother, I've lost my theatrical partner of many, many years and my very best friend.\"\n\nPaul later revealed that his brother had been diagnosed with bone cancer, but had kept it secret from his manager, fans and Paul himself as he had wanted to perform for as long as possible. His funeral was held on 17 August at the Rotherham United stadium and was attended by a number of show business friends; a large number of fans waited outside to pay their respects.\n\n"}
{"id": "6034175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6034175", "title": "Each-way", "text": "Each-way\n\nAn each-way bet is a wager offered by bookmakers consisting of two separate bets: a win bet and a place bet. For the win part of the bet to give a return, the selection must win, or finish first, in the event. For the place part of the bet to give a return, the selection must either win or finish in one of the predetermined places for the event, such as first place or second place. The odds paid on the place part of the bet are usually a fraction (commonly , , or ) of the win odds. The trade-off being that one has a greater chance of making one's bet in trade for getting less payoff for doing so. Examples are domestic football knockout competitions (e.g. FA Cup) where the quoted place terms may be .\n\nIn horse racing in the United Kingdom, the \"place\" is set strictly by the Jockey Club and will depend on the size of the field (that is, how many horses are running) so that the \"place\" may be just 1st and 2nd, 1st 2nd and 3rd, or even 1st 2nd 3rd or 4th on a big race like the Grand National, and may pay or the odds.\n\nBecause an each-way wager comprises two bets, the total staked is twice the unit stake. For example, a £5 each-way single would cost £10, as would a £5 each-way treble comprising as it does a £5 win treble and a £5 place treble.\n\nCalculation of returns uses either decimal odds or (fractional odds + 1).\n\n£50 each-way on a football team 'to win the cup' at 15-2 and the odds a place 1 or 2 would cost £100.\n\nA £10 each-way single on a 10-1 selection in a horse race and paying the odds a place 1, 2, or 3 would cost £20.\n\nThe number horses and the type of race generally determines the number of places paid out and the fraction of the win odds used for settling the place part of an each way bet.\n\nOften for big races or as a special promotion the big bookie's will offer enhanced place terms where they pay an extra place or pay the place part at 1/4 instead of 1/5.\n\n\n"}

Clug studied classical ballet in Cluj-Napoca.\n\nIn 1991 Clug joined Maribor's Slovene National Theater (SNT) as a Principal Dancer while also performing with Zagreb Ballet as a guest artist.\n\nIn 1996, the Slovene National Theater commissioned Clug to choreograph his first ballet called \"Babylon\" by Tomas Pandur. Clug's first full evening ballet, called \"Tango\", premiered at SNT in 1998.\n\nContinuing his relationship with the Slovene National Theater, in 2003 he was appointed director of Maribor ballet, leading the company towards new and distinctive directions. Throughout the past decade, Clug drew attention of the international audience to himself, due to his specific choreographic style. He equally succeeded in putting the Maribor Ballet ensemble on the international dancing map.

The expression \"evil laugh\" dates back to at least 1860. \"Wicked laugh\" can be found even earlier, dating back to at least 1784. Another variant, the \"sardonic laugh,\" shows up in 1714 and might date back even further.\n\nIn comic books, where supervillains utter such laughs, it is variously rendered as \"mwahahaha\", \"mwhahaha\", \"muahahaha\", \"hehehehe, \"bwuhuhuhaha\", etc. \"(Compare with Ho ho ho.) These words are also commonly used on internet blogs, bulletin board systems, and games. There, they are generally used when some form of victory is attained, or to indicate superiority over someone else. The words are often used as interjections, and less frequently as nouns.\n\nDuring the 1930s, the popular radio program \"The Shadow\" used a signature evil laugh as part of its presentation. This was voiced by actor Frank Readick, and his laugh was used even after Orson Welles took over the lead role. The evil laugh voiced by Vincent Price has been used or copied many times in radio, film, music, and television, notably at the end of the music video \"Michael Jackson's Thriller\".\n\nIn films, evil laughter often fills the soundtrack when the villain is off-camera. In such cases, the laughter follows the hero or victim as they try to escape. An example is in \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", where Belloq's laugh fills the South American jungle while Indiana Jones attempts to escape from the Hovitos.\n\nOn the television series \"Dallas\", JR Ewing (Larry Hagman) would often break into his trademark evil laugh whenever he knew he had put one over on somebody, especially Cliff Barnes (Ken Kercheval). \n\n"}

It is one of the few green areas in the city, and includes Giza's largest park. The zoo covers about , and is home to many endangered species, as well as a selection of endemic fauna.\n\nRare species have been successfully bred in the zoo - including the first California sea lion to be born in the Middle East in 2002.\n\nThe zoo was built by Khedive Ismail and opened on 1 March 1891. It was built on about 50 feddan () that was once part of the harem gardens. Ismail imported many plants from India, Africa, and South America, of which a banyan tree planted about 1871 can still be seen. The original 180 birds and 78 other animals in the zoo's collection were taken from Ismail's private menagerie.\n\nIn the late 1870s the state took over the zoo as partial payment of the Ismail's debts. In January 1890, the harem building was opened as a natural history museum, and was used in this manner until a new museum was opened in Tahrir Square in 1902. The portion of the gardens facing the Nile were sold to the public for large homes, but the harem gardens were kept intact.\n\nWhen the zoo was built, the exhibits with semi-natural habitats were considered spacious by European standards. The animal collection emphasized Egyptian species, and at one time claimed 20,000 individuals representing 400 species, though many of these may have been migratory birds. By the mid-twentieth century, the zoo was considered one of the best zoos in the world, but it has had trouble adapting to the pressures of growth in the latter half of the century as human populations in Cairo have increased.\n\nBy the end of World War II the zoo claimed 4,700 exhibits, with a total of 700 mammals and 500 reptiles. Attendance levels of 43,567 in 1889 rose to 223,525 by 1906. In 2007, the zoo hosted almost 3.4 million visitors.\n\nIn 2004, the zoo lost its membership with the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA). The zoo did not pay membership fees, and then ignored the recommendations of WAZA inspectors. As of 2010, it is a member of the African Association of Zoos and Aquaria (PAAZAB), and is working towards getting re-accredited by WAZA.\n\nMammals at the zoo include giraffes, Rhinoceros, Black bears, Raccoons, Elephant, Sea lions, Tigers, Lions, Cheetahs, zebras, agouti, Red Fox, Dorcas gazelle, Scimitar horned oryx, and many more.\nThe Giza Zoo has lot of different species of birds like flamingos, falcons, vultures, ibis, love birds, and macaws.\nThe zoo has many species of reptiles that belong to Egypt like the Egyptian cobra and tortoise.It also has Nile Crocodiles and American Alligators.\n\nThe gardens include roads paved with black stone flags from Trieste, footpaths decorated with plebbles laid out like mosaics, and a pond with a marble island that is now the zoo's Tea Island.\n\nThe zoo also includes a suspension bridge designed by Gustave Eiffel that lets visitors view the animals from above. This bridge may have been the first elevated viewing area at any zoo in the world.\n\nThere is a reptile house and taxidermist's building on site.\n\nAs part of the upgrades to help the zoo recover its membership in WAZA, in 2008 the bear exhibit was outfitted with fans and misters to help cool the bears. There are plans to run chilled water through the floors to make the bears more comfortable.\n\n\n"}

He received the Norwegian state three-year scholarship for artists from 1982 until 1984.\n\nIn his early compositions Mostad is moving from a linear-expressionist style to a more timbre-oriented line of thinking where both modernist and romantic music are inspiring his work. From around 1975 the timbre/harmonic aspect of his music becomes more related to the harmonic series. During the 80s and 90s he combines this with other types of modal and free compositional techniques, sometimes utilising modal techniques as well as more overtone-oriented harmonic spectra within the same composition.\n\nAt the same time he has also been experimenting with untraditional structuring of his material, both in works of one movement and in cyclical works. Many of Mostad's instrumental works as well as vocal music, are inspired by Judæo-Christian texts which often influence the structuring of the music. For instance in \"And the light shines in darkness\" a massive dark sounding layer with lots of rhythmical unrest gradually gets introduced to a lighter sounding chord with notes from the harmonic series.\n\nMostad has written chamber music, solo pieces for piano, guitar, organ and utilised electronics, both pre-recorded and live with interaction with live musicians, but his main focus has been orchestral and vocal music. His longest composition is the work \"Were you there, when they crucified my Lord?\" for choir, recitation, solo voices and orchestra.\n\nThe music of Jon Mostad has been played by leading orchestras in Norway (Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim...) as well as performed at Bergen International Festival, the Elverum Festival, Music Factory in Bergen and Dartington International Summer School in Totnes, England among other festivals. In 2010 he was featured composer of the Vinteriss festival in Østfold (a region in Norway). He has been represented at Nordic Music Days and has been played on radio in the Nordic countries, former Jugoslavia and England. His \"2 psalms\" for choir has been sung numerous times in Japan, England and Norway.\n\nMostad's music has also been performed by local amateur ensembles. Music ranging from small chamber pieces to the multimedia show Terje Vigen based on texts by Henrik Ibsen and theatrical music for Ibsen's Peer Gynt were written for local ensembles in Fredrikstad.\n\nMostad has also got commissions from Ny Musikk, NRK radio and TV, Ungdomssymfonikerne, Det Norske Blåseensemble, Amsterdams Gitaartrio and Oslo Sinfonietta as well as from local ensembles in Fredrikstad.\n\nMostad plays the piano, but has seldom been involved in performing his own music. Occasionally he has improvised pre- and postludes when susbtituting as organist in local churches and from time to time he has also played some of his smaller works for piano (with or without electronics) live at concerts. During the 2010 Vinterriss festival he was playing the live electronics part at the premiere of his piece \"Ikke helt solo\" (\"not quite solo\") for cello and quadrophonic live electronics.\n\nThe music of Jon Mostad has been recorded by The norwegian Soloist's choir, The Oslo Philharmonic, Øystein Birkeland and Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra. His orchestral works \"House\", \"The light shines in darkness\" and \"Concerto for cello and orchestra\" were chosen by a jury of the Norwegian Society of Composers to be recorded on the Aurora label, resulting in the CD \"The light shines in darkness\" with Oslo Philharmonic, cellist Øystein Birkeland and conductor Michel Swierczewski.\n\nTheological candidate 1965. Music and pedagogy 1969. Diploma in composition at the Norwegian Academy of Music (ending in 1974). Main teacher: Finn Mortensen. An important inspiration during his studies were the private seminars in sonology and on Mahler by Olav Anton Thommessen. Shorter courses in studio work at NSEM, Høvikodden (1975/76), EMS Stockholm (1983).\n\nIn addition to composing, Jon Mostad was teaching arrangement and composition, music and religion at high schools in Fredrikstad and Moss (years 10-12 or 11-13 in the Norwegian school system) until he retired in 2006. Among his many students were film director Harald Zwart and composer Frank Tveor Nordensten.\n\nHe has also been active in organisations such as Ny Musikk Østfold, the regional branch of an organisation promoting contemporary music, Norwegian Society of Composers and TONO.\n\nMostad is a devout Lutheran and has done volunteer work in Christian organisations such as being a Sunday school teacher, visiting prisoners, helping find funding and equipment for a hospital in Nigeria and delivering humanitarian aid to a village in Russia shortly after the fall of the Soviet bloc.\n\n"}

All Korean dramas go through the process of localization: re-dubbing, pre-editing, post-editing and finalization before going on-air.\n\nKorean dramas began airing in the Philippines in 2003, with shows such as \"Bright Girl\", \"Autumn in My Heart\", \"Lovers in Paris\" and \"My Girl\".\n\nKorean dramas have become hits since the 2000s, excluding Japanese dramas. The huge demand from viewers for Korean dramas has prompted Philippine TV stations to import Korean, Taiwanese and Chinese dramas only. Top Korean drama series \"Lovers in Paris\", \"Full House\", \"My Name Is Kim Sam Soon\", \"Stairway to Heaven\" and \"Coffee Prince\" were imported and dubbed in Filipino language, instantly becoming hits. The success of \"Jewel in the Palace\" in Korea was also replicated in the Philippines and many other Asian countries.\n\nThe Taiwanese drama \"Meteor Garden\" was also a ratings success when it first aired on ABS-CBN in 2003. Its remake, the Korean \"Boys Over Flowers\", starring Lee Min Ho, Kim Hyun Joong, Kim Bum, Kim Joon, Kim So Eun and Koo Hye Sun, also succeeded in capturing audiences. It was aired in the Philippines from May to August 2009 and became a phenomenal success.\n\nThe 5 Network, the third largest network in the country, aired Korean dramas such as \"Hero\" and \"My Wife is a Superwoman\", together with the Taiwanese drama \"Easy Fortune Happy Life\", Israeli drama \"Split\", and primetime variety show \"Willing Willie\" hosted by Willie Revillame. However, a The 5 Network representative said that instead of putting all their own Korean dramas in primetime, they've decided to move it on noontime: \"It's actually the strategy of TV5 to do counter-programming.

{"id": "20783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20783", "title": "Magic lantern", "text": "Magic lantern\n\nThe magic lantern, also known by its Latin name lanterna magica, is an early type of image projector employing pictures painted, printed or produced photographically on transparent plates (usually made of glass), one or more lenses, and a light source. It was mostly developed in the 17th century and commonly used for entertainment purposes. It was increasingly applied to educational purposes during the 19th century. Since the late 19th century smaller versions were also mass-produced as a toy for children. The magic lantern was in wide use from the 18th century until the mid-20th century, when it was superseded by a compact version that could hold many 35 mm photographic slides: the slide projector.\n\nThe magic lantern used a concave mirror in back of a light source to direct as much of the light as possible through a small rectangular sheet of glass—a \"lantern slide\"—on which was the image to be projected, and onward into a lens at the front of the apparatus. The lens was adjusted to optimally focus the plane of the slide at the distance of the projection screen, which could be simply a white wall, and it therefore formed an enlarged image of the slide on the screen. Some lanterns, including those of Christiaan Huygens and Jan van Musschenbroek, used 3 lenses.\n\nOriginally the pictures were hand painted on glass slides. Initially figures were rendered with black paint but soon transparent colors were also used. Sometimes the painting was done on oiled paper. Usually black paint was used as a background to block superfluous light, so the figures could be projected without distracting borders or frames. Many slides were finished with a layer of transparent lacquer, but in a later period cover glasses were also used to protect the painted layer. Most hand-made slides were mounted in wood frames with a round or square opening for the picture.\nAfter 1820 the manufacturing of hand colored printed slides started, often making use of decalcomania transfers. Many manufactured slides were produced on strips of glass with several pictures on them and rimmed with a strip of glued paper.\n\nThe first photographic lantern slides, called \"Hyalotypes\", were invented by the German-born brothers Ernst Wilhelm (William) and Friedrich (Frederick) Langenheim in 1848 in Philadelphia and patented in 1850.\n\nApart from sunlight, the only light sources available at the time of invention in the 17th century were candles and oil lamps, which were very inefficient and produced very dim projected images. The invention of the Argand lamp in the 1790s helped to make the images brighter. The invention of limelight in the 1820s made them very much brighter. The invention of the intensely bright electric arc lamp in the 1860s eliminated the need for combustible gases or hazardous chemicals, and eventually the incandescent electric lamp further improved safety and convenience, although not brightness.\n\nSeveral types of projection systems existed before the invention of the magic lantern. Giovanni Fontana, Leonardo Da Vinci and Cornelis Drebbel did even describe and/or draw image projectors that may have been quite similar to the magic lantern.\n\nIn the 17th century there was an immense interest in optics. The telescope and microscope were invented (in 1608 and the 1620s respectively) and apart from being useful to some scientists, such instruments were especially popular as entertaining curiosities with people who could afford them. The magic lantern would prove to be a perfect successor.\n\nThe magic lantern can be seen as a further development of camera obscura. This is a natural phenomenon that occurs when an image of a scene at the other side of a screen (or for instance a wall) is projected through a small hole in that screen as an inverted image (left to right and upside down) on a surface opposite to the opening. It was known at least since the 5th century BCE and experimented with in darkened rooms at least since circa 1000 CE. The use of a lens in the hole has been traced back to circa 1550. The portable camera obscura box with a lens was developed in the 17th century. Dutch inventor Cornelis Drebbel is thought to have sold one to Dutch poet, composer and diplomat Constantijn Huygens in 1622, while the oldest known clear description of a box-type camera is in German Jesuit scientist Gaspar Schott's 1657 book \"Magia universalis naturæ et artis\".\n\nThe 1645 first edition of German Jesuit scholar Athanasius Kircher's book \"Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae\" included a description of his invention, the \"Steganographic Mirror\": a primitive projection system with a focusing lens and text or pictures painted on a concave mirror reflecting sunlight, mostly intended for long distance communication. He saw limitations in the increase of size and diminished clarity over a long distance and expressed his hope that someone would find a method to improve on this.\n\nIn 1654 Belgian Jesuit mathematician André Tacquet used Kircher's technique to show the journey from China to Belgium of Italian Jesuit missionary Martino Martini. It is sometimes reported that Martini lectured throughout Europe with a magic lantern which he might have imported from China, but there's no evidence that anything other than Kircher's technique was used. However, Tacquet was a correspondent and friend of Christiaan Huygens and may thus have been a very early adapter of the magic lantern technique that Huygens developed around this period.\n\nProminent Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens, is nowadays widely accepted as the true inventor of the magic lantern. He knew Athanasius Kircher's 1645 edition of \"Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae\" which described a primitive projection system with a focusing lens and text or pictures painted on a concave mirror reflecting sunlight. Christiaan's father Constantijn had been acquainted with Cornelis Drebbel who used some unidentified optical techniques to transform himself and summon wonderful appearances in magical performances. Constantijn Huygens wrote very enthusiastically about a camera obscura device that he got from Drebbel in 1622.\n\nThe oldest known document concerning the magic lantern is a page on which Christiaan Huygens made ten small sketches of a skeleton taking off its skull, above which he wrote \"for representations by means of convex glasses with the lamp\" (translated from French). As this page was found between documents dated in 1659, it is believed to also have been made in 1659. Huygens soon seemed to regret this invention, as he thought it was too frivolous. In a 1662 letter to his brother Lodewijk he claimed he thought of it as some old \"bagatelle\" and seemed convinced that it would harm the family's reputation if people found out the lantern came from him. Christiaan had reluctantly sent a lantern to their father, but when he realized that Constantijn intended to show the lantern to the court of King Louis XIV of France at the Louvre, Christiaan asked Lodewijk to sabotage the lantern.\nChristiaan initially referred to the magic lantern as \"la lampe\" and \"la lanterne\", but in the last years of his life he used the then common term \"laterna magica\" in some notes. In 1694 he drew the principle of a \"laterna magica\" with two lenses.\n\nThomas Rasmussen Walgensten (c. 1627 – 1681), a mathematician from Gotland, studied at the university of Leyden in 1657–58. He possibly met Christiaan Huygens during this time (and/or on several other occasions) and may have learned about the magic lantern from him. Correspondence between them is known from 1667. At least from 1664 until 1670 Walgensten was demonstrating the magic lantern in Paris (1664), Lyon (1665), Rome (1665-66) and Copenhagen (1670). He \"sold such lanterns to different Italian princes in such an amount that they now are almost everyday items in Rome\" according to Athanasius Kircher in 1671. In 1670 Walgensten projected an image of Death at the court of King Frederick III of Denmark. This scared some courtiers, but the king dismissed their cowardice and requested to repeat the figure three times. The king died a few days later. After Walgensten died, his widow sold his lanterns to the Danish Royal collection, but they have not been preserved. Walgensten is credited with coining the term \"Laterna Magica\", assuming he communicated this name to Claude Dechales who in 1674 published about the machine of the \"erudite Dane\" that he had seen in 1665 in Lyon.\n\nThere are many gaps and uncertainties in the magic lantern's recorded history. A separate early magic lantern tradition seems to have been developed in southern Germany and includes lanterns with horizontal cylindrical bodies, while Walgensten's lantern and probably Huygens' both had vertical bodies. This tradition can be traced back to 1671 with the arrival of instrument maker Johann Franz Griendel in the city of Nürnberg, which Johann Zahn identified as one of the centers of magic lantern production in 1686. Griendel was indicated as the inventor of the magic lantern by Johann Christoph Kohlhans in a 1677 publication. It has been suggested that this tradition is older and that instrument maker Johann Wiesel (1583–1662) from Augsburg may have been making magic lanterns earlier on and possibly inspired Griendel and even Huygens. Huygens is known to have studied samples of Wiesel's lens-making and instruments since 1653. Wiesel did make a ship's lantern around 1640 that has much in common with the magic lantern design that Griendel would later apply: a horizontal cylindrical body with a rosette chimney on top, a concave mirror behind a fixture for a candle or lamp inside and a biconvex lens at the front. There is no evidence that Wiesel actually ever made a magic lantern, but in 1674 his successor offered a variety of magic lanterns from the same workshop. This successor is thought to have only continued producing Wiesel's designs after his death in 1662, without adding anything new.\n\nBefore 1671 only a small circle of people seemed to have knowledge of the magic lantern, and almost every known report of the device from this period had to do with people that were more or less directly connected to Christiaan Huygens. Despite the rejection expressed in his letters to his brother, Huygens must have familiarized several people with the lantern. \n\nIn 1664 Parisian engineer Pierre Petit wrote to Huygens to ask for some specifications of the lantern, because he was trying to construct one after seeing the lantern of \"the dane\" (probably Walgensten). The lantern that Petit was constructing had a concave mirror behind the lamp. This directed more light through the lens, resulting in a brighter projection, and it would become a standard part of most of the lanterns that were made later. Petit may have copied it from Walgensten, but he expressed that he made a lamp stronger than any he had ever seen.\n\nSince 1661 Huygens corresponded with London optical instrument-maker Richard Reeve. Reeve was soon selling magic lanterns, demonstrated one in his shop on 17 May 1663 to Balthasar de Monconys and sold one to Samuel Pepys in August 1666.\n\nOne of Christiaan Huygens' contacts imagined how Athanasius Kircher would use the magic lantern: \"If he would know about the invention of the Lantern he would surely frighten the cardinals with specters.\" Kircher would eventually learn about the existence of the magic lantern via Thomas Walgensten and introduced it as \"Lucerna Magica\" in the widespread 1671 second edition of his book \"Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae\". Kircher claimed that Thomas Walgensten reworked his ideas from the previous edition of this book into a better lantern. Kircher described this improved lantern, but it was illustrated in a confusing manner: the pictures seem technically incorrect with both the projected image and the transparencies (H) shown upright (while the text states that they should be drawn in an inverted position), the hollow mirror is too high in one picture and absent in the other, and the lens (I) seems to be placed at the wrong side of the slide. However, experiments with a construction as illustrated in Kircher's book proved that it could work as a point light-source projection system.\nThe projected image in one of the illustrations shows a person in purgatory or hellfire and the other depicts Death with a scythe and an hourglass. According to legend Kircher secretly used the lantern at night to project the image of Death on windows of apostates to scare them back into church. Kircher did suggest in his book that an audience would be more astonished by the sudden appearance of images if the lantern would be hidden in a separate room, so the audience would be ignorant of the cause of their appearance.\nThe earliest reports and illustrations of lantern projections suggest that they were all intended to scare the audience. Pierre Petit called the apparatus \"lanterne de peur\" (lantern of fear) in his 1664 letter to Huygens. Surviving lantern plates and descriptions from the next decades prove that the new medium was not just used for horror shows, but that all kinds of subjects were projected. In 1675 Wilhelm Leibniz saw an important role for the magic lantern in a plan for a kind of world exhibition with projections of \"attempts at flight, artistic meteors, optical effects, representations of the sky with the star and comets, and a model of the earth (...), fireworks, water fountains, and ships in rare forms; then mandrakes and other rare plants and exotic animals.\" In 1685/6 Johannes Zahn was an early advocate for use of the device for educational purposes: detailed anatomical illustrations were difficult to draw on a chalkboard, but could easily be copied onto glass or mica.\nBy the 1730s the use of magic lanterns started to become more widespread when travelling showmen, conjurers and storytellers added them to their repertoire. The travelling lanternists were often called Savoyards (they supposedly came from the Savoy region in France) and became a common sight in many European cities.\n\nIn France in the 1770s François Dominique Séraphin used magic lanterns to perform his \"Ombres Chinoises\" (Chinese shadows), a form of shadow play.\n\nMagic lanterns had also become a staple of science lecturing and museum events since Scottish lecturer Henry Moyes’s tour of America in 1785–86, when he recommended that all college laboratories procure one. French writer and educator Stéphanie Félicité, comtesse de Genlis popularized the use of magic lanterns as an educational tool in the late 1700s when using projected images of plants to teach botany. Her educational methods were published in America in English translation during the early 1820s.\nA type of lantern was constructed by Moses Holden between 1814 and 1815 for illustrating his astronomical lectures.\n\nIn 1821 Philip Carpenter's London company, that would become Carpenter and Westley after his death, started manufacturing a sturdy but lightweight and transportable \"Phantasmagoria lantern\" with an Argand style lamp, which produced high quality projections and was suitable for use in classrooms. Carpenter also developed a \"secret\" copper plate printing/burning process to mass-produce glass lantern slides with printed outlines, which were then easily and quickly hand painted ready for sale. These \"copper-plate sliders\" contained three or four very detailed 4\" circular images mounted in thin hardwood frames. The first known set \"The Elements of Zoology\" became available in 1823, showing over 200 images in 56 frames of zoological figures, classified according to the system of the Swedish scientist Carl Linnaeus. The same year many other slides appeared in the company's catalogue: \"The Kings and Queens of England\" (9 sliders taken from David Hume’s History of England), \"Astronomical Diagrams and Constellations\" (9 sliders taken from Friedrich Wilhelm Herschel’s textbooks), \"Views and Buildings\", Ancient and Modern Costume (62 sliders from various sources). Fifteen sliders of the category \"Humorous\" provided some entertainment, but the focus on education was obvious and very successful.\n\nThe mass production of slides also meant that the magic lantern now became affordable to the common men, opening a market for smaller lanterns with smaller glass sliders which instead of wooden frames usually had colorful strips of paper glued around their edges.\n\nAlthough the popularity of magic lanterns waned after the introduction of movies in the 1890s, they remained a common medium until slide projectors came into widespread use during the 1950s.\n\nThe magic lantern was not only a direct ancestor of the motion picture projector as a means for visual storytelling, but it could itself be used to project moving images.\n\nSome suggestion of movement could be achieved by alternating between pictures of different phases of a motion, but most magic lantern \"animations\" used two glass slides projected together - one with the stationary part of the picture and the other with the part that could be set in motion by hand or by a simple mechanism.\n\nMotion in animated slides was mostly limited to either two phases of a movement or transformation, or a more gradual singular movement (e.g. a train passing through a landscape). These limitations made subjects with repetitive movements popular, like the sails on a windmill turning around or children on a seesaw. Movements could be repeated over and over and could be performed at different speeds.\n\nA common technique that is comparable to the effect of a panning camera makes use of a long slide that is simply pulled slowly through the lantern and usually shows a landscape, sometimes with several phases of a story within the continuous backdrop.\n\nMovement of projected images was also possible by moving the magic lantern itself. This became a staple technique in phantasmagoria shows in the late 18th century, often with the lantern sliding on rails or riding on small wheels and hidden from the view of the audience behind the projection screen.\n\nIn 1645 Kircher had already suggested projecting live insects and shadow puppets from the surface of the mirror in his Steganographic system to perform dramatic scenes.\n\nChristiaan Huygens' 1659 sketches (see above) suggest he intended to animate the skeleton to have it take off its head and place it back on its neck. This can be seen as an indication that the very first magic lantern demonstrations may already have included projections of simple animations.\n\nIn 1668 Robert Hooke wrote about the effects of a type of magic lantern installation: \"Spectators not well versed in optics, that should see the various apparitions and disappearances, the motions, changes and actions that may this way be represented, would readily believe them to be supernatural and miraculous.\"\n\nIn 1675 German polymath and philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz proposed a kind of world exhibition that would show all kinds of new inventions and spectacles. In a handwritten document he supposed it should open and close with magic lantern shows, including subjects \"which can be dismembered, to represent quite extraordinary and grotesque movements, which men would not be capable of making\" (translated from French).\n\nSeveral reports of early magic lantern screenings possibly described moving pictures, but are not clear enough to conclude whether the viewers saw animated slides or motion depicted in still images.\n\nIn 1698 German engraver and publisher Johann Christoph Weigel described several lantern slides with mechanisms that made glass parts move over one fixed glass slide, for instance by the means of a silk thread, or grooves in which the mobile part slides.\n\nBy 1709 a German optician and glass grinder named Themme (or Temme) made moving lantern slides, including a carriage with rotating wheels, a cupid with a spinning wheel, a shooting gun and falling bombs. Wheels were cut from the glass plate with a diamond and rotated by a thread that was spun around small brass wheels attached to the glass wheels. A paper slip mask would be quickly pulled away to reveal the red fiery discharge and the bullet from a shooting gun. Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach visited Themme's shop and liked the effects, but was disappointed about the very simple mechanisms. Nonetheless he bought seven moving slides, as well as twelve slides with four pictures each, which he thought were delicately painted.\n\nSeveral types of mechanical slides were described and illustrated in Dutch professor of mathematics, physics, philosophy, medicine, and astronomy Pieter van Musschenbroek's second edition (1739) of \"Beginsels Der Natuurkunde\". Pieter was the brother of Jan van Musschenbroek, the maker of an outstanding magic lantern with excellent lenses and a diaphragm (see illustration above).\n\nIn 1770 Edmé-Gilles Guyot described a method of using two slides for the depiction of a storm at sea, with waves on one slide and ships and a few clouds on another. Lanternists could project the illusion of mild waves turning into a wild sea tossing the ships around by increasing the movement of the separate slides. Guyot also detailed how projection on smoke could be used to create the illusion of ghosts hovering in the air, which would become a technique commonly used in phantasmagoria.\n\nAn especially intricate multiple rackwork mechanism was developed to show the movements of the planets (sometimes accompanied by revolving satellites) revolving around the sun. In 1795 one M. Dicas seems to have offered an early magic lantern system, the Lucernal or Portable Eidouranian, that showed the orbiting planets. From around the 1820s mechanical astronomical slides became quite common.\n\nVarious types of mechanisms were commonly used to add movement to the projected image:\n\nMechanical slides with abstract special effects include:\n\n\nThe effect of a gradual transition from one image to another, known as a dissolve in modern filmmaking, became the basis of a popular type of magic lantern show in England in the 19th century. Typical dissolving views showed landscapes dissolving from day to night or from summer to winter. This was achieved by aligning the projection of two matching images and slowly diminishing the first image while introducing the second image. The subject and the effect of magic lantern dissolving views is similar to the popular Diorama theatre paintings which originated in Paris in 1822. The terms \"dissolving views\", \"dioramic views\", or simply \"diorama\" were\noften used interchangeably in 19th century magic lantern broadsides.\n\nThe effect was reportedly invented by phantasmagoria pioneer Paul de Philipsthal while in Ireland in 1803 or 1804. He thought of using two lanterns to make the spirit of Samuel appear out of a mist in his representation of the Witch of Endor. While working out the desired effect, he got the idea of using the technique with landscapes. An 1812 newspaper about a London performance indicates that De Philipsthal presented what was possibly a relatively early incarnation of a dissolving views show, describing it as a \"a series of landscapes (in imitation of moonlight), which insensibly change to various scenes producing a very magical effect.”\n\nAnother possible inventor is Henry Langdon Childe, who purportedly once worked for De Philipsthal. He is said to have invented the dissolving views in 1807 and to have improved and completed the technique in 1818. The oldest known use of the term \"dissolving views\" occurs on playbills for Childe's shows at the Adelphi Theatre in London in 1837. Childe further popularized the dissolving views at the Royal Polytechnic Institution in the early 1840s.\n\nDespite the later reports about the early invention and apart from De Philipsthal's 1812 performance, no reports of dissolving view shows before the 1820s are known and in some cases confusion with the Diorama or similar media is possible. In 1826 Scottish magician and ventriloquist M. Henry's introduced what he referred to as \"Beautiful Dissolvent Scenes\", \"imperceptibly changing views\", \"dissolvent views\" and \"Magic Views\" which were created \"by Machinery invented by M. Henry\". In 1827 Henry Langdon Childe presented \"Scenic Views, showing the various effects of light and shade\" with a series of subjects that would become classics for the dissolving views. In December 1827 De Philipsthal returned with a show that included \"various splendid views (...) transforming themselves imperceptibly (as if it were by Magic) from one form into another\".\n\nBiunial lanterns, with two projecting optical sets in one apparatus, were produced to more easily project dissolving views. Possibly the first horizontal biunial lantern, dubbed the \"Biscenascope\" was made by the optician Mr. Clarke and presented at the Royal Adelaide Gallery in London on December 5, 1840. The earliest known illustration of a vertical biunial lantern, probably provided by E.G. Wood, appeared in Horne & Thornthwaite catalogue in 1857. Later on triple lanterns enabled additional effects, for instance the effect of snow falling while a green landscape dissolves into a snowy winter version.\n\nA mechanical device could be fitted on the magic lantern, which locked up a diaphragm on the first slide slowly whilst a diaphragm on a second slide was opened simultaneously.\n\nPhilip Carpenter's copper-plate printing process, introduced in 1823, may have made it much easier to create duplicate slides with printed outlines that could then be colored differently to create dissolving view slides. However, all early dissolving view slides seem to have been hand-painted.\n\nThere have been many different experiments involving sorts of movement with the magic lantern. These include:\nSeveral of these experiments were publicly demonstrated at the Institution.\n\nVersions of the magic lantern were used to project transparent variations of the phénakisticope. These were adapted with a mechanism that spins the disc and a shutter system. Duboscq produced some in the 1850s and Thomas Ross patented a version called \"Wheel of life\" in 1869 and 1870.\n\nThe Choreutoscope was invented around 1866 by the Greenwich engineer J. Beale and demonstrated at the Royal Polytechnic. It projected six pictures from a long slide and used a hand-cranked mechanism for intermittent movement of the slide and synchronized shutter action. The mechanism became a key to the development of the movie camera and projector. The Choreutoscope was used at the first professional public demonstration of the Kinetoscope to explain its principles.\n\nAn \"Optical Instrument\" was patented in the U.S. in 1869 by O.B. Brown, using a phenakistiscope-like disc with a technique very close to the later cinematograph; with Maltese Cross motion; a star-wheel and pin being used for intermittent motion, and a two-sector shutter.\n\nJohn Arthur Roebuck Rudge built a lantern for William Friese-Greene with a mechanism to project a sequence of seven photographic slides. It was reportedly made in 1872, but also 1875 and a more likely date of 1882 have been given. The surviving slides show a man removing his head with his hands and raising the loose head. The photographed body belonged to Rudge and Friese-Greene posed for the head. The slides probably provided the very first trick photography sequence projection. Friese-Greene's demonstrated the machine in his shop, until the police ordered him to remove it when it attracted too large a crowd.\n\nPhantasmagoria was a form of horror theater that used one or more magic lanterns to project frightening images, especially of ghosts. Showmen used rear projection, mobile or portable projectors and all kinds of effects to produce convincing necromantic experiences. It was very popular in Europe from the late 18th century to well into the 19th century.\n\nIt is thought that optical devices like concave mirrors and the camera obscura have been used since antiquity to fool spectators into believing they saw real gods and spirits, but it was the magician \"physicist\" Phylidor who created what must have been the first true phantasmagoria show. He probably used mobile magic lanterns with the recently invented Argand lamp to create his successful \"Schröpferischen, und Cagliostoischen Geister-Erscheinungen\" (Schröpfer-esque and Cagiostro-esque Ghost Apparitions) in Vienna from 1790 to 1792. Phylidor stated that his show of perfected apparitions revealed how charlatans like Johann Georg Schröpfer and Cagliostro had fooled their audiences. As \"Paul Filidort\" he presented his \"Phantasmagorie\" in Paris From December 1792 to July 1793, probably using the term for the first time. As \"Paul de Philipsthal\" he performed \"Phantasmagoria\" shows in Britain since 1801 with great success.\n\nOne of many showmen who were inspired by Phylidor, Etienne-Gaspard Robert became very famous with his own \"Fantasmagorie\" show in Paris from 1798 to 1803 (later performing throughout Europe and returning to Paris for a triumphant comeback in Paris in 1814). He patented a mobile \"Fantascope\" lantern in 1798.\n\nSince its opening in 1838 The Royal Polytechnic Institution in London became a very popular and influential venue with all kinds of magic lantern shows as an important part of its program. At the main theatre, with 500 seats, lanternists would make good use of a battery of six large lanterns running on tracked tables to project the finely detailed images of extra large slides on the 648 square feet screen. The magic lantern was used to illustrate lectures, concerts, pantomimes and other forms of theatre. Popular magic lantern presentations included Henry Langon Childe's dissolving views, his chromatrope, phantasmagoria and mechanical slides.\n\nUtushi-e is a type of magic lantern show that became popular in Japan in the 19th century. The Dutch probably introduced the magic lantern in Japan before the 1760s. A new style for magic lantern shows was introduced by Kameya Toraku I, who first performed in 1803 in Edo. Possibly the phantasmagoria shows (popular in the west at that moment) inspired the rear projection technique, moving images and ghost stories. Japanese showmen developed lightweight wooden projectors (furo) that were handheld so that several performers could move the projections of different colourful figures move around the screen at the same time. The Western techniques of mechanical slides were combined with traditional Japanese skills - especially from Karakuri puppets - to further animate the figures and for special effects.\n\nSome enthusiasts claim that the brilliant quality of color in lantern slides is unsurpassed by successive projection media. The magic lantern and lantern slides are still popular with collectors and can be found in many museums. However, of the original lanterns from the first 150 years after its invention only 28 are known to still exist (as of 2009).\nMuseums usually prefer not to use their slides for projections, but often provide video representations of the slides.\n\nA collaborative research project of several European universities called \"A Million Pictures\" started in June 2015 and will last until May 2018. It addresses the sustainable preservation of the massive, untapped heritage resource of the tens of thousands of lantern slides in the collections of libraries and museums across Europe.\n\nGenuine public lantern shows are relatively rare; several regular performers state to be the only one of their kind in their part of the world. These include Pierre Albanese and glass harmonica player Thomas Bloch live Magic Lantern/Phantasmagoria shows since 2008 in Europe and The American Magic-Lantern Theater. The Magic Lantern Society maintains a list of active lanternists, which contains more than 20 performers in the U.K. and circa eight performers in other parts of the world (Europe, U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand).\n\nDutch theatre group Lichtbende produces contemporary magical light spectacles and workshops with magic lanterns.\n\n\n\n→←"}

It is based in Garden Grove, California. The company was founded in 1997 by Ken Wong. MarineDepot.com is a subsidiary of Fins, Furs & Feathers, Inc.\n\nIn 1997, pre-med student and self-professed \"reef geek\" Ken Wong was frustrated: there wasn't a single fish store in Orange County, California that could satisfy all his saltwater aquarium needs under one roof. Sometimes a store wouldn't have the right product. Other times store employees were unable to answer technical questions about the products they carried. Wong often found himself commuting from store-to-store in order to find the best products, the best prices and the best advice. This gave him an idea.\n\nWong envisioned a one-stop shop where customers could find everything they needed, from product specifications and information on marine aquarium fish species to expert advice on the hobby and friendly, one-on-one technical support. He began contacting product manufacturers and distributors to secure inventory and, armed with some off-the-shelf software and a copy of \"HTML 4 For Dummies\", Wong launched the first MarineDepot.com website on January 7, 1998.\n\nIt began as a one-man operation in a one-bedroom apartment. He fielded customer service calls, packed orders, handled the books and was the company IT guy. Wong invested everything he had into his startup company. His dedication paid off: with the advent of always-on Internet technologies like DSL, along with advancements in the aquarium hobby, Wong's small business grew exponentially.\n\nWong relocated MarineDepot.com in 1999 from his apartment to a 1,000 square foot location in a Santa Ana, California strip mall. Continued growth necessitated another move midway through 2000 to a larger 3,600 square foot location in Costa Mesa, California. Later that same year, the company moved into an even larger 5,500 square foot warehouse. In early 2001, MarineDepot.com moved into a 15,000 square foot building on Gene Autry Way in Anaheim, California, down the street from Angel Stadium. The company acquired a second 9,500 square foot building to accommodate additional staff and inventory. In 2007, the company moved into its current 30,000 square foot location in Garden Grove, California.\n\nMarineDepot.com began printing a biannual product catalog in 2002, which has since become a staple of the brand. Catalogs are mailed twice yearly to customers, usually in the fall and spring. A typical catalog contains 136 or more pages and consists of non-paid product placements accompanied by paid advertisements.\n\nMarineDepot.com specializes in the sale of marine aquarium and reef aquarium supplies. They also carry an assortment of freshwater aquarium products and equipment for ponds, water features and water gardens. In total, the company carries more than 7,500 products, which include the following:\n\n"}

It is also the name of the type of cards used to play this game. Each player uses Menko cards made from thick paper or cardboard, printed on one or both sides with images from anime, manga, and other works. A player's card is placed on the hardwood or concrete floor and the other player throws down his card, trying to flip the other player's card with a gust of wind or by striking his card against the other card. If he succeeds, he takes both cards. The player who takes all the cards, or the one with the most cards at the game's end, wins the game.\n\nMenko has been popular since the Edo period. They were originally known as men'uchi (面打) and were made with putting clay in molds which were then baked. Its quick and simple rules have made it popular among children of all age groups. Because technique is just as important as power in this game, smaller children can compete fairly with older players.\n\nThe pictures on these cards reflect the popular culture of their time, and Menko cards from the past reflect important information about their era. In the Edo and early Meiji period, images like ninja and samurai were popular. Before World War II, the most popular images were of the military, like fighter planes and battleships. After the war, characters from anime and manga were popular, as well as baseball players. Collectors of Japanese baseball cards collect baseball menko. In the late 1980s to early 1990s, Menko cards were decorated with holographs and sparkles.\n\n\n"}

The film stars Park Sung-woong, Yoon Seung-ah and Oh Seung-hoon.\n\nVeteran actor Jae-ha and idol star Young-woo are cast in a stage play called \"Unchain\" as Walter and Singer, respectively. Young-woo is initially uncooperative during rehearsals, arriving late and failing to display any interest in or enthusiasm for the play. Frustrated by Young-woo's flippant attitude toward acting, Jae-ha pushes him to change his behavior. Young-Woo becomes intrigued by Jae-ha's passion for his work, and devotes himself to his role, reading books Jae-ha gives him and accompanying him on outings to find props for the play. Jae-ha's girlfriend Hee-won begins to sense the connection between the two actors as they grow closer. Jae-ha himself is increasingly tense and agitated, confused about his feelings for Young-woo, until one day he accidentally hurts Young-woo during a rehearsal. Later, he encounters Young-woo in the empty theater and the two share a kiss which is witnessed by Hee-won. The next day, Jae-ha finds Young-woo at his house and drags him into one of Hee-won's storage sheds, where Young-woo acknowledges his feelings for Jae-ha and they kiss again. The two drive to the beach together, where Young-woo posts pictures of them on Instagram which prompt rumors about the nature of their relationship. They are soon found embracing in the car by Young-woo's manager and Hee-won. Young-woo is driven away by his manager as Hee-won confronts Jae-ha about his sexuality.\n\nThe day of the press conference for \"Unchain\", Young-woo tells Jae-ha that he posted those pictures on purpose, because he wanted to share their love with the world. He asks Jae-ha if he loves Young-woo, and begs him to tell everyone about their relationship. Jae-ha does not reply, but in the press conference dismisses rumors about them by saying that they were only acting, and requesting that people stop prying into their personal lives and instead focus on the play itself. Young-woo is devastated by this and visits Jae-ha's house while he and Hee-won are sleeping. The next day, after Jae-ha leaves, Hee-won becomes aware of another person in the house, and one of her sculptures is knocked to the ground and broken.\n\nYoung-woo arrives late to the first performance of the play, and as he and Jae-ha act, Young-woo's lines suggest that he hurt Hee-won, enraging Jae-ha. He asks Jae-ha to kiss him, and when he does, Young-woo whispers to him that the kiss was not in the script. In the final scene of the play, Young-woo acts out his character's suicide, but chooses not to use the safety mechanism, which causes him to hang himself temporarily. Jae-ha holds him up until the scene ends. Jae-ha finds Young-woo unconscious, but Young-woo wakes up and tells him backstage that now he is the perfect Singer, while Jae-ha is only a mediocre Walter. Young-woo leaves after the play, and Jae-ha and Hee-won reunite.\n\nPierce Conran of \"Screen Anarchy\" said the film is director Bang's \"least impressive work as it trudges through thinly drawn and tired themes\". Conran also went on to write that the fact \"Method\" is a queer film is \"almost irrelevant as it feels like a cheap trick to add something to a rote, forbidden-love narrative\".\n\n"}

In those years the cinemas were often mobile. Their operators used to travel in the whole region with a selection of movie cassettes, a TV set, a VCR and a generator, going from one village to the next to show their films. To draw attention to their performances, they announced them with colourful hand painted movie posters. These were provided by the local film distributors who collaborated with artists and sign painters like Daniel Anum Jasper, Heavy Jeaurs, Leonardo, Kwesi Blue, Salvation or Dallas who created for each movie a matching billboard.\n\nThe artists and sign writers looked first at the films that were mostly made in Ghana or Nigeria, and then developed their film poster. For the mobile cinemas, these works had to be sturdy, cheap to produce, and light in weight because the cinema operators had to move around with the material. Therefore, the artists used a cheap, but very durable and light linen underlay which they gained from Ghanaian flour sacks. This material adhered very well with their oil and acrylic paints and the posters could even be hung outdoors when it rained. With their bright colors and an iconography adapted to the Ghanaian audiences, these paintings immediately caught the attention of the people and made them much more likely to go to the cinema than the normal posters that were printed in Nigeria.\n\nSince Ghanaians now buy or rent their films on DVD and prefer to watch them at home, they no more go to the small cinemas. Most of the movie houses had to close in the recent years, and the few that are left can barely afford hand-painted movie posters, they rather use printed ones. Therefore, in the Region of Greater Accra, there are hardly any cinemas left who still use hand painted movie posters. Many artists who used to work for the film distributors have turned to other tasks. They are painting street signs that are still very popular in Ghana, and in the Greater Accra Region some are also assisting other artists like Paa Joe or Kudjoe Affutu in painting their figurative coffins, palanquins and small sculptures. Some sign painters, such as Heavy J., Moses, Jasper, Farkira or Leonardo, also work for the international art market, where Ghanaian movie posters as well as the figurative coffins are shown in exhibitions of contemporary African art where they are getting more and more attention.\n\n\n\n"}

The imagery is usually generated and rendered in real time and in a way synchronized with the music as it is played.\n\nVisualization techniques range from simple ones (e.g., a simulation of an oscilloscope display) to elaborate ones, which often include a plurality of composited effects. The changes in the music's loudness and frequency spectrum are among the properties used as input to the visualization.\n\nEffective music visualization aims to attain a high degree of visual correlation between a musical track's spectral characteristics such as frequency and amplitude and the objects or components of the visual image being rendered and displayed.\n\n\"Music visualization\" can be defined, in contrast to previous existing pre-generated music plus visualization combinations (as for example music videos), by its characteristic as being real-time generated. Another possible distinction is seen by some in the ability of some music visualization systems (such as Geiss' MilkDrop) to create different visualizations for each song or audio every time the program is run, in contrast to other forms of music visualization (such as music videos or a laser lighting display) which always show the same visualization. Music visualization may be achieved in a 2D or a 3D coordinate system where up to 6 dimensions can be modified, the 4th, 5th and 6th dimensions being color, intensity and transparency./\n\nThe first electronic music visualizer was the Atari Video Music introduced by Atari Inc. in 1976, and designed by the initiator of the home version of \"Pong\", Robert Brown. The idea was to create a visual exploration that could be implemented into a Hi-Fi stereo system. It is described in . In Great Britain music visualization was first pioneered by Fred Judd.\n\nMusic and audio players were available on early home computers, \"Sound to Light Generator\" (1985, Infinite Software) used the ZX Spectrum's cassette player for example. The 1984 movie Electric Dreams prominently made use of one, although as a pre-generated effect, rather than calculated in real-time.\n\nFor PC/DOS one of the first modern music visualization programs was the open-source, multi-platform \"Cthugha\" in 1993. In the 1990s the emerging demo and tracker music scene pioneered the real-time technics for music visualization on the PC platform; resulting examples are \"Cubic player\" (1994), \"Inertia Player\" (1995) or in general their real-time generated Demos.\n\nSubsequently, PC computer music visualization became widespread in the mid to late 1990s as applications such as \"Winamp\" (1997), \"Audion\" (1999), and \"SoundJam\" (2000). By 1999, there were several dozen freeware non-trivial music visualizers in distribution. In particular, \"MilkDrop\" (2001) and its predecessor \"geiss-plugin\" (1998) by Ryan Geiss, \"G-Force\" by Andy O'Meara, and AVS (2000) by Nullsoft became popular music visualizations. AVS is part of Winamp and has been recently open-sourced, and G-Force was licensed for use in iTunes and Windows Media Center and is presently the flagship product for Andy O'Meara's software startup company, SoundSpectrum. \n\nSome of the more recent applications such as Luminant Music (2017), produce visualization in real time and render to a full-3D environment. \n\nWith the increasing popularity of virtual reality, several start ups have begun working on music visualization although reception has been mixed with one informal poll finding that only 33% of respondents were interested in music visualization for VR.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the early 1960s, filmmaker Jack Smith used discarded color-reversal film stock to film \"Flaming Creatures\". John Waters' 1964 black-and-white film \"Hag in a Black Leather Jacket\" reportedly cost $30 to make, though Waters has said that he stole the film stock. Craig Baldwin's \"Flick Skin\" is entirely made from discarded film, or \"found footage\", retrieved from a projectionist's booth. The No Wave Cinema movement of the late 1970s, represented by filmmakers such as Vivienne Dick, produced many notable no-budget films shot on Super 8, such as \"Beauty Becomes The Beast\". In 1993, Sarah Jacobson's first film, \"I Was a Teenage Serial Killer\", was made with \"one camera, one tape recorder, one mic and, like, four lights\". G.B. Jones took 13 years to film, direct and edit on Super 8mm the feature film \"The Lollipop Generation\", which was filmed whenever she could afford to buy a roll of film, and finally released in 2008. In 2012, first-time director Shawn Holmes shot his debut film Memory Lane with non-professional actors and a budget of less than $300. In the same year Goodbye Promise, the first movie ever to be distributed online directly to its audience via a crowdfunding platform. was released. The 2013 sci-fi \"Hyperfutura\" by James O'Brien employed found footage married to a live action narrative to create a dystopian future on an inventive no-budget scale.\n\nFootage for no-budget films is often shot on location, either with permission, or without permission which is referred to as \"guerrilla filmmaking\", using sites such as the home of the filmmaker or their friends, in the backyard or local neighborhood. No-budget films have often been made in the past using Super 8 mm film or video, but recent films have taken advantage of low-cost digital cameras and editing programs. A notable example of this could be found in the work of ASS Studios, a no-budget film studio founded in 2011 by Courtney Fathom Sell and Reverend Jen Miller on the Lower East Side of New York City.\n\nNo-budget films can receive distribution at film festivals that focus on independent and experimental films, such as the Flicker Film Festival and No Budget Film Festival in Los Angeles, The 8 Fest in Toronto, and the Trasharama A-Go-Go festival in Australia. The Polish brothers distributed their no-budget film \"For Lovers Only\" on iTunes and relied on social media to publicize it.\n\nExamples of well-received no-budget films are Kevin Smith's \"Clerks\", Christopher Nolan's \"Following\", Jafar Panahi's \"Taxi\" , Shane Carruth's \"Primer,\" and Robert Rodriguez's \"El Mariachi.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "449544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=449544", "title": "Noh", "text": "Noh\n\n, derived from the Sino-Japanese word for \"skill\" or \"talent\", is a major form of classical Japanese musical drama that has been performed since the 14th century. Developed by Kan'ami and his son Zeami, it is the oldest major theatre art that is still regularly performed today. Traditionally, a \"Noh\" program includes five \"Noh\" plays with comedic \"kyōgen\" plays in between; an abbreviated program of two \"Noh\" plays and one \"kyōgen\" piece has become common in \"Noh\" presentations today. An \"okina\" (翁) play may be presented in the very beginning especially at New Year, holidays, and other special occasions.\n\n\"Nō\" together with \"Kyōgen\" is part of \"Nōgaku\" theatre.\n\n\"Noh\" is often based on tales from traditional literature with a supernatural being transformed into human form as a hero narrating a story. \"Noh\" integrates masks, costumes and various props in a dance-based performance, requiring highly trained actors and musicians. Emotions are primarily conveyed by stylized conventional gestures while the iconic masks represent the roles such as ghosts, women, children, and the elderly. Written in ancient Japanese language, the text \"vividly describes the ordinary people of the twelfth to sixteenth centuries\". Having a strong emphasis on tradition rather than innovation, \"Noh\" is extremely codified and regulated by the \"iemoto\" system.\n\nThe word \"Noh\" is a borrowing from Middle Chinese \"nong\" (cf. Mandarin \"néng\"), and means \"skill\", \"craft\", or \"talent\", particularly in the field of performing arts in this context. The word \"Noh\" may be used alone or with \"gaku\" (fun, music) to form the word \"nōgaku\". \"Noh\" is a classical tradition that is highly valued by many today. When used alone, \"Noh\" refers to the historical genre of theatre originated from \"sarugaku\" in the mid 14th century and continues to be performed today.\n\n\"Noh\" and \"kyōgen\" \"originated in the 8th century when the \"sangaku\" () was transmitted from China to Japan. At the time, the term \"sangaku\" referred to various types of performance featuring acrobats, song and dance as well as comic sketches. Its subsequent adaption to Japanese society led to its assimilation of other traditional art forms.\"\n\nVarious performing art elements in \"sangaku\" as well as elements of \"dengaku\" (rural celebrations performed in connection with rice planting), \"sarugaku\" (popular entertainment including acrobatics, juggling, and pantomime), \"shirabyōshi \"(traditional dances performed by female dancers in the Imperial Court in 12th century), and \"gagaku\" (ancient music and dance performed in the Imperial Court beginning in 7th century) evolved into \"Noh\" and \"kyōgen\".\n\nStudies on genealogy of the \"Noh\" actors in 14th century indicate they were members of families specialized in performing arts; they had performed various traditional performance arts for many generations. Sociological research by Yukio Hattori reveals that the Konparu School (), arguably the oldest school of \"Noh\", is a descendant of Mimashi (味摩之), the performer who introduced \"gigaku\", now-extinct masked drama-dance performance, into Japan from Kudara Kingdom in 612.\n\nAnother theory by Shinhachirō Matsumoto suggests \"Noh\" originated from outcastes struggling to claim higher social status by catering to those in power, namely the new ruling \"samurai\" class of the time. The transferral of the shogunate from Kamakura to Kyoto at the beginning of Muromachi period marked the increasing power of the samurai class and strengthened the relationship between the shogunate and the court. As \"Noh\" became the \"shōgun\"s favorite art form, \"Noh\" was able to become a courtly art form through this newly formed relationship. In 14th century, with strong support and patronage from \"shōgun\" Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, Zeami was able to establish \"Noh\" as the most prominent theatre art form of the time.\n\nKan'ami Kiyotsugu and his son Zeami Motokiyo brought Noh to what is essentially its present-day form during the Muromachi period (1336 to 1573). Kan'ami was a renowned actor with great versatility fulfilling roles from graceful women and 12-year-old boys to strong adult males. When Kan'ami first presented his work to 17-year-old Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, Zeami was a child actor in his play, around age 12. Yoshimitsu fell in love with Zeami and his position of favor at court caused Noh to be performed frequently for Yoshimitsu thereafter.\n\nDuring the Edo period Noh continued to be aristocratic art form supported by the \"shōgun\", the feudal lords (\"daimyōs\"), as well as wealthy and sophisticated commoners. While \"kabuki\" and \"joruri\" popular to the middle class focused on new and experimental entertainment, Noh strived to preserve its established high standards and historic authenticity and remained mostly unchanged throughout the era. To capture the essence of performances given by great masters, every detail in movements and positions was reproduced by others, generally resulting in an increasingly slow, ceremonial tempo over time.\n\nThe fall of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1868 and the formation of a new modernized government resulted in the end of financial support by the government, and the entire field of Noh experienced major financial crisis. Shortly after the Meiji Restoration both the number of Noh performers and Noh stages greatly diminished. The support from the imperial government was eventually regained partly due to Noh's appeal to foreign diplomats. The companies that remained active throughout the Meiji era also significantly broadened Noh's reach by catering to the general public, performing at theatres in major cities such as Tokyo and Osaka.\n\nIn 1957 the Japanese Government designated \"nōgaku\" as an Important Intangible Cultural Property, which affords a degree of legal protection to the tradition as well as its most accomplished practitioners. The National Noh Theatre founded by the government in 1983 stages regular performances and organizes courses to train actors in the leading roles of \"nōgaku\". Noh was inscribed in 2008 on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO as Nôgaku theatre.\n\nAlthough the terms \"nōgaku \"and Noh are sometimes used interchangeably, \"nōgaku \"encompasses both Noh and \"kyōgen\". \"Kyōgen\" is performed in between Noh plays in the same space. Compared to Noh, \"\"kyōgen\" relies less on the use of masks and is derived from the humorous plays of the \"sangaku\", as reflected in its comic dialogue.\"\n\nThe concept of \"jo-ha-kyū\" dictates virtually every element of Noh including compiling of a program of plays, structuring of each play, songs and dances within plays, and the basic rhythms within each Noh performance. \"Jo\" means beginning, \"ha\" means breaking, and \"kyū\" means rapid or urgent. The term originated in \"gagaku\", ancient courtly music, to indicate gradually increasing tempo and was adopted in various Japanese traditions including Noh, tea ceremony, poetry, and flower arrangement.\n\n\"Jo-ha-kyū\" is incorporated in traditional five-play program of Noh. The first play is \"jo\", the second, third, and fourth plays are \"ha\", and the fifth play is \"kyū\". In fact, the five categories discussed below were created so that the program would represent \"jo-ha-kyū\" when one play from each category is selected and performed in order. Each play can be broken into three parts, the introduction, the development, and the conclusion. A play starts out in a slow tempo at \"jo\", gets slightly faster at \"ha\", then culminates in \"kyū\".\n\nActors begin their training as young children, traditionally at the age of three. Historically, Noh performers had been exclusively male, but daughters of established Noh actors have begun to perform professionally since the 1940s. In 2009, there were about 1200 male and 200 female professional Noh performers.\n\nZeami isolated nine levels or types of Noh acting from lower degrees which put emphasis on movement and violence to higher degrees which represent the opening of a flower and spiritual prowess.\n\nIn 2012, there are five extant schools of Noh acting called Kanze (観世), Hōshō (宝生), Komparu (金春), Kongō (金剛), and Kita (喜多) schools that train \"shite\" actors. Each school has its own \"iemoto\" family that carries the name of the school and is considered the most important. The \"iemoto\" holds the power to create new plays or modify lyrics and performance modes. \"Waki\" actors are trained in the schools Takayasu (高安), Fukuou (福王), and Hōshō (宝生). There are two schools that train \"kyōgen\", Ōkura (大蔵) and Izumi (和泉). 11 schools train instrumentalists, each school specializing in one to three instruments.\n\nThe Nohgaku Performers' Association (\"Nōgaku Kyōkai\"), to which all professionals are registered, strictly protects the traditions passed down from their ancestors (see \"iemoto\"). However, several secret documents of the Kanze school written by Zeami, as well as materials by Konparu Zenchiku, have been diffused throughout the community of scholars of Japanese theatre.\n\nThere are four major categories of Noh performers: \"shite\", \"waki\", \"kyōgen\", and \"hayashi\".\n\n\nA typical Noh play always involves the chorus, the orchestra, and at least one \"shite\" and one \"waki\" actor.\n\nNoh performance combines a variety of elements into a stylistic whole, with each particular element the product of generations of refinement according to the central Buddhist, Shinto, and minimalist aspects of Noh's aesthetic principles.\n\n\"Noh\" masks (能面 \"nō-men\" or 面 \"omote\") are carved from blocks of Japanese cypress (檜 \"hinoki\"), and painted with natural pigments on a neutral base of glue and crunched seashell. There are approximately 450 different masks mostly based on sixty types, all of which have distinctive names. Some masks are representative and frequently used in many different plays, while some are very specific and may only be used in one or two plays. Noh masks signify the characters' gender, age, and social ranking, and by wearing masks the actors may portray youngsters, old men, female, or nonhuman (divine, demonic, or animal) characters. Only the \"shite\", the main actor, wears a mask in most plays, even though the \"tsure\" may also wear a mask in some plays to represent female characters.\n\nEven though the mask covers an actor's facial expressions, the use of the mask in Noh is not an abandonment of facial expressions altogether. Rather, its intent is to stylize and codify the facial expressions through the use of the mask and to stimulate the imagination of the audience. By using masks, actors are able to convey emotions in a more controlled manner through movements and body language. Some masks utilize lighting effect to convey different emotions through slight tilting of the head. Facing slightly upward, or \"brightening\" the mask, will let the mask to capture more light, revealing more features that appear laughing or smiling. Facing downward, or \"clouding\" it, will cause the mask to appear sad or mad.\n\nNoh masks are treasured by Noh families and institution, and the powerful Noh schools hold the oldest and most valuable Noh masks in their private collections, rarely seen by the public. The most ancient mask is supposedly kept as a hidden treasure by the oldest school, the Konparu. According to the current head of the Konparu school, the mask was carved by the legendary regent Prince Shōtoku (572-622) over a thousand years ago. While the historical accuracy of the legend of Prince Shōtoku's mask may be contested, the legend itself is ancient as it is first recorded in Zeami's \"Style and the Flower\" written in the 14th century. Some of the masks of the Konparu school belong to the Tokyo National Museum, and are exhibited there frequently.\n\nThe traditional Noh stage has complete openness that provides a shared experience between the performers and the audience throughout the performance. Without any proscenium or curtains to obstruct the view, the audience sees each actor even during the moments before they enter (and after they exit) the central \"stage\". The theatre itself is considered symbolic and treated with reverence both by the performers and the audience.\n\nOne of the most recognizable characteristic of Noh stage is its independent roof that hangs over the stage even in indoor theatres. Supported by four columns, the roof symbolizes the sanctity of the stage, with its architectural design derived from the worship pavilion (\"haiden\") or sacred dance pavilion (\"kagura-den\") of Shinto shrines. The roof also unifies the theatre space and defines the stage as an architectural entity.\n\nThe pillars supporting the roof are named \"shitebashira\" (principal character's pillar), \"metsukebashira\" (gazing pillar), \"wakibashira\" (secondary character's pillar), and \"fuebashira\" (flute pillar), clockwise from upstage right respectively. Each pillar is associated with the performers and their actions.\n\nThe stage is made entirely of unfinished \"hinoki\", Japanese cypress, with almost no decorative elements. The poet and novelist Tōson Shimazaki writes that \"on the stage of the Noh theatre there are no sets that change with each piece. Neither is there a curtain. There is only a simple panel (\"kagami-ita\") with a painting of a green pine tree. This creates the impression that anything that could provide any shading has been banished. To break such monotony and make something happen is no easy thing.\"\n\nAnother unique feature of the stage is the \"hashigakari\", a narrow bridge at upstage right used by actors to enter the stage. \"Hashigakari\" means \"suspension bridge\", signifying something aerial that connects two separate worlds on a same level. The bridge symbolizes the mythic nature of Noh plays in which otherworldly ghosts and spirits frequently appear. In contrast, \"hanamichi\" in Kabuki theatres is literally a path (\"michi\") that connects two spaces in a single world, thus has a completely different significance.\n\nNoh actors wear silk costumes called \"shozoku\" (robes) along with wigs, hats, and props such as the fan. With striking colors, elaborate texture, and intricate weave and embroidery, Noh robes are truly works of art in their own right. Costumes for the \"shite\" in particular are extravagant, shimmering silk brocades, but are progressively less sumptuous for the \"tsure,\" the \"wakizure,\" and the \"aikyōgen\".\n\nFor centuries, in accordance with the vision of Zeami, Noh costumes emulated the clothing that the characters would genuinely wear, such as the formal robes for a courtier and the street clothing for a peasant or commoner. But in the late sixteenth century, the costumes became stylized with certain symbolic and stylistic conventions. During the Edo (Tokugawa) period, the elaborate robes given to actors by noblemen and \"samurai\" in the Muromachi period were developed as costumes.\n\nThe musicians and chorus typically wear formal \"montsuki\" \"kimono\" (black and adorned with five family crests) accompanied by either \"hakama\" (a skirt-like garment) or \"kami-shimo\", a combination of \"hakama\" and a waist-coat with exaggerated shoulders. Finally, the stage attendants are garbed in virtually unadorned black garments, much in the same way as stagehands in contemporary Western theatre.\n\nThe use of props in Noh is minimalistic and stylized. The most commonly used prop in Noh is the fan, as it is carried by all performers regardless of role. Chorus singers and musicians may carry their fan in hand when entering the stage, or carry it tucked into the \"obi \"(the sash). The fan is usually placed at the performer's side when he or she takes position, and is often not taken up again until leaving the stage. During dance sequences, the fan is typically used to represent any and all hand-held props, such as a sword, wine jug, flute, or writing brush. The fan may represent various objects over the course of a single play.\n\nWhen hand props other than fans are used, they are usually introduced or retrieved by \"kuroko\" who fulfill a similar role to stage crew in contemporary theatre. Like their Western counterparts, stage attendants for Noh traditionally dress in black, but unlike in Western theatre they may appear on stage during a scene, or may remain on stage during an entire performance, in both cases in plain view of the audience. The all-black costume of \"kuroko\" implies they are not part of the action on stage and are effectively invisible.\n\nSet pieces in Noh such as the boats, wells, altars, and bells, are typically carried onto the stage before the beginning of the act in which they are needed. These props normally are only outlines to suggest actual objects, although the great bell, a perennial exception to most Noh rules for props, is designed to conceal the actor and to allow a costume change during the \"kyōgen\" interlude.\n\nNoh theatre is accompanied by a chorus and a \"hayashi\" ensemble (\"Noh-bayashi\" 能囃子). Noh is a chanted drama, and a few commentators have dubbed it \"Japanese opera\". However, the singing in Noh involves a limited tonal range, with lengthy, repetitive passages in a narrow dynamic range. Texts are poetic, relying heavily on the Japanese seven-five rhythm common to nearly all forms of Japanese poetry, with an economy of expression, and an abundance of allusion. The singing parts of Noh are called \"\"Utai\" and the speaking parts \"Kataru\"\". The music has many blank spaces (\"ma\") in between the actual sounds, and these negative blank spaces are in fact considered the heart of the music. In addition to \"utai\", Noh \"hayashi\" ensemble consists of four musicians, also known as the \"hayashi-kata\", including three drummers, which play the \"shime-daiko\", \"ōtsuzumi\" (hip drum), and \"kotsuzumi\" (shoulder drum) respectively, and a \"nohkan\" flutist.\n\nThe chant is not always performed \"in character\"; that is, sometimes the actor will speak lines or describe events from the perspective of another character or even a disinterested narrator. Far from breaking the rhythm of the performance, this is actually in keeping with the other-worldly feel of many Noh plays, especially in those characterized as \"mugen\".\n\nOf the roughly 2000 plays created for Noh that are known today, about 240 make up the current repertoire performed by the five existing Noh schools. The current repertoire is heavily influenced by the taste of aristocratic class in Tokugawa period and does not necessarily reflect popularity among the commoners. There are several ways to classify Noh plays.\n\nAll Noh plays can be classified into three broad categories.\nWhile \"Genzai\" Noh utilizes internal and external conflicts to drive storylines and bring out emotions, \"Mugen\" Noh focuses on utilizing flashbacks of the past and the deceased to invoke emotions.\n\nAdditionally, all Noh plays may be categorized by their style.\n\nAll Noh plays are divided by their themes into the following five categories. This classification is considered the most practical, and is still used today in formal programming choices today. Traditionally, a formal 5-play program is composed of a selection from each of the groups.\n\nIn addition to the above five, \"Okina\" (or \"Kamiuta\") is frequently performed at the very beginning of the program. Combining dance with Shinto ritual, it is considered the oldest type of Noh play.\n\nThe following categorization is that of the Kanze school.\nMany Western artists have been influenced by Noh.\n\n\n\n\nZeami and Zenchiku describe a number of distinct qualities that are thought to be essential to the proper understanding of Noh as an art form.\n\nNoh is still regularly performed today in public theatres as well as private theatres mostly located in major cities. There are more than 70 Noh theatres throughout Japan, presenting both professional and amateur productions.\n\nPublic theatres include National Noh Theatre (Tokyo), Nagoya Noh Theater, and Osaka Noh Theater. Each Noh school has its own permanent theatre, such as Kanze Noh Theater (Tokyo), Hosho Noh Theater (Tokyo), Kongo Noh Theater (Kyoto), and Nara Komparu Noh Theater (Nara). Additionally, there are various prefectural and municipal theatres located throughout Japan that present touring professional companies and local amateur companies. In some regions, unique regional Noh such as Ogisai Kurokawa Noh have developed to form schools independent from five traditional schools.\n\nAudience etiquette is generally similar to formal western theatre—the audience quietly watches. Surtitles are not used, but some audience members follow along in the libretto. Because there are no curtains on the stage, the performance begins with the actors entering the stage and ends with their leaving the stage. The house lights are usually kept on during the performances, creating an intimate feel that provides a shared experience between the performers and the audience.\n\nAt the end of the play, the actors file out slowly (most important first, with gaps between actors), and while they are on the bridge (\"hashigakari\"), the audience claps restrainedly. Between actors, clapping ceases, then begins again as the next actor leaves. Unlike in western theatre, there is no bowing, nor do the actors return to the stage after having left. A play may end with the \"shite\" character leaving the stage as part of the story (as in \"Kokaji,\" for instance)—rather than ending with all characters on stage—in which case one claps as the character exits.\n\nDuring the interval, tea, coffee, and \"wagashi\" (Japanese sweets) may be served in the lobby. In the Edo period, when Noh was a day-long affair, more substantial \"makunouchi' bentō\" (幕の内弁当, \"between-acts lunchbox\") were served. On special occasions, when the performance is over, お神酒 (\"o-miki,\" ceremonial \"sake\") may be served in the lobby on the way out, as it happens in Shinto rituals.\n\nThe audience is seated in front of the stage, to the left side of the stage, and in the corner front-left of stage; these are in order of decreasing desirability. While the \"metsuke-bashira\" pillar obstructs the view of the stage, the actors are primarily at the corners, not the center, and thus the two aisles are located where the views of the two main actors would be obscured, ensuring a generally clear view regardless of seating.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5178882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5178882", "title": "RIA Novosti", "text": "RIA Novosti\n\nRIA Novosti (), sometimes RIA () for short, was Russia's international news agency until 2013 and continues to be the name of a state-operated domestic Russian-language news agency. Operating under the purview of the Russian Ministry of Communications and Mass Media, RIA Novosti is headquartered in Moscow and operated about 80 bureaus internationally. On 9 December 2013 President of Russia Vladimir Putin ordered RIA Novosti's liquidation and the creation of a Russian international news agency Rossiya Segodnya. Dmitry Kiselev, an anchorman of the Russia-1 channel was appointed to be the first president of the new information agency. RIA Novosti was scheduled to be closed down in 2014; starting in March 2014, staff were informed that they had the option of transferring their contracts to Rossiya Segodnya or accepting voluntary redundancy. On 10 November 2014, Rossiya Segodnya launched the Sputnik multimedia platform as the international replacement of RIA Novosti and Voice of Russia. Within Russia itself, however, Rossiya Segodnya continues to operate its Russian language news service under the name RIA Novosti with its ria.ru website.\n\nThe agency published news and analysis of social-political, economic, scientific and financial subjects on the Internet and via e-mail in the main European languages, as well as in Persian, Japanese and Arabic. It had a correspondent network in the Russian Federation, CIS and over 40 non-CIS countries. Its clients include the presidential administration, Russian government, Federation Council, State Duma, leading ministries and government departments, administrations of Russian regions, representatives of Russian and foreign business communities, diplomatic missions, and public organizations.\n\nRIA Novosti was an award-winning news agency. The last editor-in-chief of RIA Novosti was Svetlana Mironyuk, the first woman appointed to the role in the agency's history. According to the organisation's Charter, enterprise's property was federally owned (because federal unitary enterprise) and was indivisible. According to the agency, it was partially government-subsidized (2.7–2.9 billion roubles in 2013), but maintained full editorial independence.\n\nIts Russian name was Federal State Unitary Enterprise Russian Agency of International Information «RIA Novosti» (), \"FGUP RAMI «RIA Novosti»\" () for short. Its formal English name was Russian News & Information Agency \"RIA Novosti\". Early in 1990s it had the name state enterprise RIA «Novosti» (named after Soviet \"Press Agency «Novosti»\" and \"Information Agency «Novosti»\"). \"RIA\" means \"Russian Information Agency\" and \"Novosti\" means \"News\" in Russian. The common abbreviation in Russian is RIA.\n\nRIA Novosti's history dates back to June 24, 1941, when by a resolution of the USSR Council of People’s Commissars and the Communist Party Central Committee, \"On the Establishment and Tasks of the Soviet Information Bureau\", the Soviet Information Bureau (Sovinformburo) was set up under the USSR Council of People's Commissars and the Central Committee. Its main task was to oversee work to cover international, military events and the events of the country's domestic life in periodicals and on the radio (from October 14, 1941, to March 3, 1942, was based in Kuibyshev – modern-day Samara).\n\nThe bureau's main task was to compile reports on the situation on the frontline of the war, work on the home front, and the partisan movement for the radio, newspapers and magazines. Sovinformburo directed the activity of the All-Slavonic Committee, Anti-Nazi Committee of Soviet Women, Anti-Nazi Committee of the Soviet Youth, Anti-Nazi Committee of Soviet Scientists, and the Jewish Anti-Nazi Committee. In 1944, a special bureau on propaganda for foreign countries was set up as part of Sovinformburo.\n\nThrough 1,171 newspapers, 523 magazines and 18 radio stations in 23 countries, Soviet embassies abroad, friendship societies, trade unions, women's, youth and scientific organizations, Sovinformburo informed readers and listeners about the struggle of the Soviet people against Nazism and in the post-war years about the main areas of Soviet domestic and foreign policies.\n\nSovinformburo heads included A.S. Shcherbakov (1941–45), S. A. Lozovsky (1945–48) and Y.S. Khavinson, D.A. Polikarpov.\nIn 1961, the Novosti Press Agency (APN) succeeded Sovinformburo. It became the leading information and press body of Soviet public organizations. The constituent conference was held on February 21, 1961. The conference of representatives of Soviet public organizations adopted a decision to create a press agency of public organizations named Novosti. The agency's guiding body was the Council of the Agency’s Founders.\n\nThe APN founders were the USSR Journalists Union, USSR Writers Union, Union of Soviet Societies of Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and the Znaniye Society. On April 3, 1961, the Agency charter was adopted. Under its charter, APN's aim was \"to contribute to mutual understanding, trust and friendship among peoples in every possible way by broadly publishing accurate information about the USSR abroad and familiarizing the Soviet public with the life of the peoples of foreign countries.\" APN's motto was \"Information for Peace, for the Friendship of Nations\". APN had bureaus in over 120 countries. The Agency published 60 illustrated newspapers and magazines in 45 languages with a one-time circulation of 4.3 million copies. With the Union of Soviet Friendship Societies, APN published the newspaper, \"Moscow News\", which in September 1990 became an independent publication. APN Publishing House put out over 200 books and booklets with a total annual circulation of 20 million copies. In 1989, a TV center opened in APN. Later, it was transformed into the TV-Novosti TV company.\n\nThe APN heads included Boris Burkov (1961–70), Ivan Udaltsov (1970–75), Lev Tolkunov (1975–83), Pavel Naumov (1983–86), Valentin Falin (1986–88), Albert Vlasov (1988–90).\n\nBy a decree of USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev, \"On the Establishment of the Information Agency Novosti,\" the Information Agency Novosti (IAN) succeeded APN on July 27, 1990. \"To provide information support for the USSR's state domestic and foreign policies and proceeding from the interests of the democratization of the mass media,\" the Novosti Press Agency was renamed the Information Agency Novosti (IAN). IAN's tasks remained the same – preparing and publishing printed, TV and radio materials in the USSR and abroad; studying public opinion on Soviet foreign and domestic policies in the USSR and abroad.\" A computer databank was created in the Agency. Initially, it contained over 250,000 documents. In 1991, the Infonews hotline started operating in the Agency. IAN had bureaus in 120 countries. It published 13 illustrated magazines and newspapers. The chairman of the IAN Board was Albert Ivanovich Vlasov.\n\nThe Russian Information Agency Novosti was created in September 1991 on the basis of IAN and the Russian Information Agency. By a Presidential decree of the Russian president dated August 22, 1991, RIA Novosti was placed within the competence of the Press and Information Ministry. RIA Novosti had about 80 bureaus and news offices abroad, over 1,500 subscribers in CIS countries and about a hundred in non-CIS countries. A Presidential decree of the Russian president of September 15, 1993 \"On the Russian Information Agency Novosti\", transformed RIA Novosti to a state news-analytical agency. RIA Novosti's radio channel – RIA-Radio worked in 1996. In August 1997, the TV channel Kultura was set up on the basis of the RIA TV channel under the sponsorship of the VGTRK TV and radio broadcasting company. By a decree of the Russian president, \"On Improving the Work of the State Electronic Media,\" the VGTRK information holding was created in May 1998, which RIA Novosti joined.\n\nIn May 1998, the agency was renamed the Russian Information Agency Vesti. As a mass media body, it retained the name of RIA Novosti. In 2005, RIA Novosti launched RT (originally Russia Today) a global multilingual television news network, which is a government-funded but autonomous, non-profit organization. RIA Novosti asserts that it \"merely participated in establishing the channel\" which retained \"complete legal, editorial and operational independence.\"\n\nOn 9 December 2013 Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the liquidation of RIA Novosti and merging it with the international radio service Voice of Russia to create Rossiya Segodnya. Dmitry Kiselyov, a former anchorman of the Channel One Russia is appointed as the president of the new information agency. According to her interview, the editor-in-chief of the TV network RT, Margarita Simonyan was completely unaware about the reorganization of the information agency and got the information from listening to competitor radio station Kommersant-FM. However, Rossiya Segodnya will not in any way be related to the television channel RT, which was known as Russia Today before its rebranding in 2009.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "286342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=286342", "title": "Radio y Televisión Martí", "text": "Radio y Televisión Martí\n\nRadio y Televisión Martí is a US propaganda broadcaster based in Miami, Florida, financed and sanctioned by the Federal government of the United States through the U.S. Agency for Global Media (formerly Broadcasting Board of Governors, BBG), which transmits anti-communist propaganda in Spanish to Cuba. Its broadcasts can also be heard and viewed worldwide through their website and on shortwave radio frequencies.\n\nNamed after the Cuban national hero and intellectual José Martí, it was established in 1983 with the addition of TV Martí in 1990. The 2014 budget for the Cuba broadcasting program is approximately US$27 million.\n\nRadio y Televisión Martí is an element of the International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB). The sister elements in the IBB are Voice of America (VOA), Alhurra/Radio Sawa, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), Radio Farda, and Radio Free Asia (RFA). The IBB and the Broadcasting Board of Governors are independent federal entities spun off from the now defunct United States Information Agency.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the U.S. Government planned to create a radio station to be known as Radio Free Cuba, modeled on Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the mission of fighting communism in an attempt to incite a coup d'état against Cuban President Fidel Castro. The station – renamed \"Radio Martí\" after Cuban writer José Martí, who had fought for Cuba's independence from Spain and against U.S. influence in the Americas – was established in 1983 by President Ronald Reagan at the urging of Jorge Mas Canosa. Existing North American broadcasters objected strenuously to the establishment of Radio Martí, fearing that its broadcasts would lead Cuba to retaliate by jamming existing commercial medium-wave broadcasts from Florida.\n\nOn May 20, 1985, Radio Martí began broadcasts to Cuba from the United States. The first day of broadcasting was chosen to commemorate the 83rd anniversary of Cuba's independence from United States rule on May 20, 1902. The fears of broadcasters proved well-founded, when Cuba-based transmitters briefly broadcast powerful signals on the medium-wave band in 1985, disrupting U.S. AM radio station broadcasts in several states. Cuba continues to broadcast interference against U.S. broadcasts specifically directed to Cuba in attempts to prevent them from being received within Cuba.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991, the budget for all U.S.-government-run foreign broadcasters, with the exception of Radio Martí, was sharply reduced. In 1996, Radio Martís studios were moved from Washington, D.C. to Miami, Florida. The move, in addition to placing the station's studios closer to its target audience, also underscored its growing independence from the Voice of America, another U.S.-government-run foreign broadcaster with which Radio Martí had previously shared studios.\n\nToday, Radio Marti broadcasts over short-wave transmitters in Delano, California, and Greenville, North Carolina, and a medium-wave transmitter in Marathon, Florida (GC: ). Its studios are located in Miami, Florida. Cuba jams both the medium-wave and shortwave signals, but the shortwave program is heard in Canada and throughout Central America and South America. On occasion, the medium-wave transmitter at 1180 kHz can be heard as far north as Washington, D.C.\n\nTwo hours of Radio Martí's news programs are carried each night, 10:00 PM to midnight local time, by Miami's WSUA (Caracol 1260 AM). Three hours of news, sports and entertainment programming are available to subscribers of SiriusXM Satellite Radio on channel 153 Monday to Friday from 9:00 PM to midnight. Additionally, Radio Marti is streamed live on martinoticias.com and for users of the martinoticas App available on iTunes and Android.\n\nRadio Martí operates with about 100 employees and a budget of $15 million. Its mission, in its own words, is to provide \"a contrast to Cuban media and provide its listeners with an uncensored view of current events.\" Former prisoners in Cuba and Cuban exiles often speak on Radio Martí, and on Saturdays a Spanish-language version of the U.S. president's weekly radio address, as well as the opposition's response, are transmitted.\n\nThere is much debate about the effectiveness of these broadcasts. As with Radio Free Europe during the Cold War, there is no way to judge the station's true audience through the usual listener surveys. Thus, the actual number of listeners is open to speculation. \n\nThe watchdog group Cuban Americans for Engagement (CAFE) has been critical of the radio station and television for broadcasts critical of warming relations and cooperative efforts with U.S. organizations. A report from the Committee on Foreign Relations in 2010 reported that less than 2 percent of Cubans listen in and U.S. Senator Mark Pryor (D-AR) and U.S. House of Representatives member Betty McCollum introduced the Stop Wasting Taxpayer Money on Cuba Broadcasting Act to shut the stations down. Alliance for Responsible Cuba Policy has also been critical of the stations.\n\nIn 1990, the U.S. Government created TV Martí to broadcast television programming to Cuba. It began broadcasting on March 27, 1990, beaming daily programs in Spanish via a transmitter affixed to an aerostat balloon – nicknamed \"Fat Albert\" by people in the area – tethered 10,000 feet (3,048 m) above Cudjoe Key, Florida. Weather affected the broadcasts; \"Fat Albert\" sometimes was hauled down because of high winds, once broke loose and drifted into the Everglades in 1991, and was destroyed by Hurricane Dennis in 2005. After the aerostats destruction, TV Martí in October 2006 began to use fixed-wing aircraft to transmit its signals, first a military C-130 Hercules which proved too expensive to operate, and then a Gulfstream twin engine airplane flying a figure-eight pattern off Key West, Florida. One of these aircraft has since been retired.\n\nThe first TV Martí broadcasts took place in the very early morning hours to avoid interference with Cuban domestic television programming. This combined with Cuban jamming of the signal has led to low viewership of TV Martí in Cuba, where, according to a U.S. official who was stationed in Havana in the stations early days, it is known as \"La TV que no se ve\" (\"The TV that can't be seen\"). U.S. Government telephone surveys in 1990, 2003, 2006, and 2008 reported Cuban viewership of TV Martí of less than one percent; the U.S. Government ceased the surveys after 2008, claiming that obtaining accurate Cuban domestic television viewership statistics was too difficult.\n\nDespite the frequent reports of its low viewership in Cuba, TV Martís defenders cited continuing Cuban government jamming of its signal as evidence of its importance, and U.S. Government funding of it continued, with TV Martí broadcasting daily programs in Spanish. In 2012, the administration of President Barack Obama finally asked the United States Congress to cease funding of the program, but Congress nonetheless continued to provide money for it.\n\nLike Radio Martí, TV Martí is an element of the International Broadcasting Bureau. TV Marti airs half-hour early and late evening newscasts which a low-power Miami television channel, WGEN-LD, Virtual digital Channel 8.1 (RF digital Channel 45.1), carries along with other propaganda. The pay-TV platform DirecTV, which is pirated by many people in Cuba, also carries TV Martí. \n\nIn May 2013, the U.S. Congress finally eliminated funding for the operation of \"Aero Martí\", the lone aircraft still committed to TV Martí broadcasts. However, funding for the preservation and maintenance of the plane continues, and it remains in storage in a hangar in Cartersville, Georgia, ready to return to service if funding of its operations resumes.\n\nFabio Leite, Deputy Director of the Radiocommunications Office of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), has condemned radio and television transmissions to Cuba from the United States as illegal and inadmissible and more so when they are designed to foment internal subversion on the island. The director emphasized that this constant U.S. attack is in violation of ITU regulations, which stipulate that radio transmissions within commercial broadcasting on medium wave, modulated frequency or television must be conceived of as a good quality national service within the limits of the country concerned. The Cuban government also has insisted the penetration of their airwaves violates international law. This claim has not been elucidated; however, Cuba responds to these broadcasts by jamming the signals.\n\nThe Radio Martí broadcasts are directed at Cuba, but can be picked up throughout North, Central, and South America when Cuba is not jamming them. However, Radio Martí programs cannot be specifically directed at U.S. citizens under the same law that restricts Voice of America broadcasts.\n\nOn November 15, 2007, delegates to the World Radiocommunication Conference 2007 declared illegal the U.S. government's use of airplanes to beam the signals of Washington-funded Radio y Televisión Martí into Cuba, stating \"A radio broadcasting station that functions on board an aircraft and transmits only to the territory of another administration without its agreement cannot be considered in conformity with the radio communications regulations.\"\n\nA report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office accuses the station of engaging in political propaganda in the forms of editorializing, use of offensive and incendiary language in broadcasts, use of unsubstantiated reports coming from Cuba, and presentation of individual views as news. The claims of unprofessionalism are strongly rejected by the station's management. National Public Radio's On the Media programme has pointed out that while \"the U.S. has spent close to a half billion dollars on TV and Radio Martí, the Cuban government has managed to effectively block the transmission signal, at least on the TV side. Viewership on the island is estimated to be a third of one percent. One study several years ago found that nine out of ten Cubans had never even heard of the channel.\"\n\nAccording to a January 10, 2007 episode of the news and commentary program \"Democracy Now!\", the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics (CRE) called for a congressional investigation into the legality of broadcasting Radio and TV Martí over commercial airwaves from southern Florida. The group states that the Bush administration has reached an agreement with two south Florida commercial Spanish-language TV and radio stations to broadcast the TV Martí program, which the CRE accuses the US government of illegally paying the station $200,000 to air the Radio Martí program daily for six months, citing that U.S law prohibits broadcasting of propaganda inside the country.\n\n\"Democracy Now!\" went on to state that a senior TV Martí executive was indicted by federal prosecutors for providing kickbacks in trade for certain contracts and the inspector generals office has launched a review into the operations of the Office of Cuba Broadcasting which oversees Martí. In addition, the program indicates that Massachusetts Congressman William Delahunt has also promised to hold hearings on TV Martí.\n\nOther critics consider the actual ineffectiveness to reach a Cuban audience, the risk of the broadcaster's purposes for heavy budget-cuts and the fear of limited editorial independence in order to be manipulated by right-wing Cuban exiles and their political agenda for personal political gain.\n\nOn September 28, 2015, at his first speech ever to the United Nations General Assembly, President Raúl Castro demanded an end to \"anti-government radio and television broadcasts\".\n\nIn May 2018 Martí broadcast video segments attacking George Soros as a \"multimillionaire Jew of Hungarian origin\" threatening Latin American democracy. The videos were based on assertions by Judicial Watch. In October 2018 the employees responsible for producing the videos were placed on administrative leave pending an investigation into their conduct.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26324", "title": "Ranma ½", "text": "Ranma ½\n\n\"Ranma ½\" has a comedic formula and a sex-changing main character, who often willfully transforms into a girl to advance his goals. The series also contains many other characters, whose intricate relationships with each other, unusual characteristics, and eccentric personalities drive most of the stories. Although the characters and their relationships are complicated, they rarely change once they are firmly introduced and settled into the series.\n\nThe manga has been adapted into two anime series created by Studio Deen: \"Ranma ½\" and , which together were broadcast on Fuji Television from 1989 to 1992. In addition, they developed 12 original video animations and three films. In 2011, a live-action television special was produced and aired on Nippon Television. The manga and anime series were licensed by Viz Media for English-language releases in North America. Madman Entertainment released the manga, part of the anime series and the first two movies in Australasia, while MVM Films released the first two movies in the United Kingdom. The \"Ranma ½\" manga has over 53 million copies in print in Japan. Both the manga and anime are cited as some of the first of their mediums to have become popular in the United States.\n\nOn a training journey in the Bayankala Mountain Range in the Qinghai Province of China, Ranma Saotome and his father Genma fall into the cursed springs at . When someone falls into a cursed spring, they take the physical form of whatever drowned there hundreds or thousands of years ago whenever they come into contact with cold water. The curse will revert when exposed to hot water until their next cold water exposure. Genma fell into the spring of a drowned panda while Ranma fell into the spring of a drowned girl.\n\nSoun Tendo is a fellow practitioner of or \"Anything-Goes School\" of martial arts and owner of a dojo. Genma and Soun agreed years ago that their children would marry and carry on the Tendo Dojo. Soun has three teenaged daughters: the polite and easygoing Kasumi, the greedy and indifferent Nabiki and the short-tempered, martial arts practicing Akane. Akane, who is Ranma's age, is appointed for bridal duty by her sisters with the reasoning that they are the older sisters and can dump the duty on her, and that they all dislike the arranged engagement and think Akane's dislike of men is the right way to express it to the fathers. At the appointed time they are surprised when a panda comes in and puts a girl in front of their father. The Tendo girls all laugh. It takes several more pages for the situation to be explained to Soun Tendo and his daughters. Both Ranma and Akane refuse the engagement initially, having not been consulted on the decision, but the fathers are insistent and they are generally treated as betrothed and end up helping or saving each other on some occasions. They are frequently found in each other's company and are constantly arguing in their trademark awkward love-hate manner that is a franchise focus.\n\nRanma goes to school with Akane at , where he meets his recurring opponent Tatewaki Kuno, the conceited kendo team captain who aggressively pursues Akane, but also falls in love with Ranma's female form without ever discovering his curse (despite most other characters eventually knowing it). Nerima serves as a backdrop for more martial arts mayhem with the introduction of Ranma's regular rivals, such as the eternally lost Ryoga Hibiki who traveled halfway across Japan getting from the front of his house to the back, where Ranma spent three days waiting for him. Ryoga, seeking revenge on Ranma, followed him to Jusenkyo where he ultimately fell into the Spring of the Drowned Piglet. Now when splashed with cold water he takes the form of a little black pig. Not knowing this, Akane takes the piglet as a pet and names it P-chan, but Ranma knows and hates him for keeping this secret and taking advantage of the situation. Another rival is the nearsighted Mousse, who also fell into a cursed spring and becomes a duck when he gets wet, and finally, there is Genma and Soun's impish grandmaster, Happosai, who spends his time stealing the underwear of schoolgirls.\n\nRanma's prospective paramours include the martial arts rhythmic gymnastics champion Kodachi Kuno, and his second fiancée and childhood friend Ukyo Kuonji the okonomiyaki vendor, along with the Chinese Amazon Shampoo, supported by her great-grandmother Cologne. As the series progresses, the school becomes more eccentric with the return of the demented, Hawaii-obsessed Principal Kuno and the placement of the power-leeching alternating child/adult Hinako Ninomiya as Ranma's English teacher. Ranma's indecision to choose his true love causes chaos in his romantic and school life.\n\nRumiko Takahashi stated that \"Ranma ½\" was conceived to be a martial arts manga that connects all aspects of everyday life to martial arts. Because her previous series had female protagonists, the author decided that she wanted a male this time. However, she was worried about writing a male main character, and therefore decided to make him half-female. Before deciding on water for initiating his changes, she considered Ranma changing every time he was punched. It was after deciding this that she felt Jusenkyo had to be set in China, as it is the only place that could have such mysterious springs. She drew inspiration for \"Ranma ½\" from a variety of real-world objects. Some of the places frequently seen in the series are modeled after actual locations in Nerima, Tokyo (both the home of Takahashi and the setting of \"Ranma ½\").\n\nIn a 1990 interview with \"Amazing Heroes\", Takahashi stated that she had four assistants that draw the backgrounds, panel lines and tone, while she creates the story and layout, and pencils and inks the characters. All her assistants are female; Takahashi stated that \"I don't use male assistants so that the girls will work more seriously if they aren't worried about boys.\" In 1992, she explained her process as beginning with laying out the chapter in the evening so as to finish it by dawn, and resting for a day before calling her assistants. They finish it in two or three nights, usually utilizing five days for a chapter.\n\nTakahashi purposefully aimed the series to be popular with women and children. In 1993, an \"Animerica\" interviewer talking with Takahashi asked her if she intended the sex-changing theme \"as an effort to enlighten a male-dominated society.\" Takahashi said that she does not think in terms of societal agendas and that she created the \"Ranma ½\" concept from simply wanting \"a simple, fun idea\". She added that she, as a woman and while recalling what manga she liked to read as a child, felt that \"humans turning into animals might also be fun and ... you know, like a fairy tale.\" In 2013, she revealed that at the start of \"Ranma\" her editor told her to make it more dramatic, but she felt that was something she could not do. However, she admitted that drama did start to appear at the end. She also sat in on the voice actor auditions for the anime, where she insisted that male and female Ranma be voiced by different actors whose gender corresponded to that of the part.\n\nWritten and illustrated by Rumiko Takahashi, \"Ranma ½\" began publication in \"Weekly Shōnen Sunday\" issue #36 of 1987, following the ending of her series \"Urusei Yatsura\". From September 1987 until March 1996, the manga was published on a near weekly basis with the occasional colored page to spruce up the usually black and white stories. After nearly a decade of storylines, the final chapter was published in \"Weekly Shōnen Sunday\" issue #12 of 1996. The 407 chapters were periodically collected and published by Shogakukan into a total of 38 black and white \"tankōbon\" volumes from 1988 to 1996. They were reassembled into 38 \"shinsōban\" from April 2002 to October 2003.\n\nNorth American publisher Viz Media originally released \"Ranma ½\" in a monthly comic book format that contained two chapters each from 1992 to 2003, and had the images \"flipped\" to read left-to-right, causing the art to be mirrored. These were periodically collected into graphic novels. On March 18, 2004, after releasing 21 volumes, Viz announced that it would reprint a number of its graphic novels. The content remained the same, but the novels moved to a smaller format with different covers and a price drop. Each volume covers roughly the same amount of material as the Japanese volumes, but retained its left-to-right format and had minor differences in grouping so that it spans 36 volumes rather than the original 38. The final volume was released in stores on November 14, 2006, thus making it Viz's longest running manga, spanning over 13 years. At Anime Expo on July 7, 2013, Viz Media announced they would begin re-releasing the manga in a format that combines two individual volumes into a single large one. With the first volume published on March 11, 2014, it marks the first time the series has been released in North America in its original right-to-left format. Madman Entertainment publishes the two-in-one version in Australasia.\n\nTogether with \"Spriggan\", it was the first manga published in Portugal, by Texto Editora in 1995.\n\nAn anime television series was created by Studio Deen and aired weekly between April 15, 1989 and September 16, 1989 on Fuji TV for 18 episodes, before being canceled due to low ratings. The series was then reworked by most of the same staff, retitled and launched in a different time slot, running for 143 episodes from October 20, 1989 to September 25, 1992. The anime stays true to the original manga but does differ by keeping Ranma's sex transformation a secret from the high school students, at least throughout most of its length. It also does not introduce Hikaru Gosunkugi until very late in the series, instead, Sasuke Sarugakure, the diminutive ninja retainer of the Kuno family fills a number of Gosunkugi's roles in early storylines but is a major character in his own right. The anime also alters the placement of many story arcs and contains numerous original episodes and characters not adapted from the manga.\n\nViz Media licensed both anime series in 1993, making \"Ranma ½\" one of the very first anime titles licensed by Viz. The English dub produced for the series was recorded by The Ocean Group in Vancouver, British Columbia. They released the series on VHS from their own \"Viz Video\" label, and on DVD a few years later in association with Pioneer Home Entertainment. Their releases collected both anime series as one, separated episodes into what they call \"seasons\", and changed the ordering of many of the episodes. Viz themselves re-released it on DVD in 2007 using their own DVD production company. At Otakon 2013, Viz announced that they re-acquired the TV series for Blu-ray and DVD release in 2014. The show is streamed on their anime channel service Neon Alley since Autumn 2013. Madman Entertainment licensed some of the series for release in Australasia, although their rights expired after releasing only the first four \"seasons\" as one series.\n\nStudio Deen also created three theatrical films; \"The Battle of Nekonron, China! A Battle to Defy the Rules!\" on November 2, 1991; \"Battle at Togenkyo! Get Back the Brides\" on August 1, 1992; and \"Super Indiscriminate Decisive Battle! Team Ranma vs. the Legendary Phoenix\" on August 20, 1994. The first two movies are feature length, but the third was originally shown in theaters with two other movies: \"Ghost Sweeper Mikami\" and \"Heisei Dog Stories: Bow\".\n\nFollowing the ending of the TV series, 11 original video animations were released directly to home video, the earliest on December 7, 1993 and the eleventh on June 4, 1996. All but one are based on stories originally in the manga. Twelve years later, a \"Ranma\" animation was created for the \"It's a Rumic World\" exhibition of Rumiko Takahashi's artwork. Based on the \"Nightmare! Incense of Deep Sleep\" manga story from volume 34, it was shown on odd numbered days at the exhibition in Tokyo from July 30 to August 11, 2008. But it was not released until January 29, 2010, when it was put in a DVD box set with the \"Urusei Yatsura\" and \"Inuyasha\" specials that premiered at the same exhibit. It was then released on DVD and Blu-ray by itself on October 20, 2010. Viz Media also licensed all three movies, and the original 11 OVAs for distribution in North America (however they released the third movie as an OVA). MVM Films has released the first two movies in the United Kingdom, while Madman Entertainment released them in Australasia.\n\nThere have been fifteen video games based on the \"Ranma ½\" franchise. While most are fighting games, there have been several RPGs and puzzle games. Only two have been released in Western countries. \"Ranma ½: Chōnai Gekitōhen\" was released in the US as \"Street Combat\"; the characters were Americanized, having their appearances completely changed, and the music was changed as well. However, \"\" was released in both North America and Europe unaltered.\n\nA live action television adaption of \"Ranma ½\" aired on Nippon TV, in a two-hour time-slot, on December 9, 2011. Although it was initially reported that the special would contain an original story, the movie does take its main plot from one of the manga's early stories with several other early scenes mixed in. The special stars Yui Aragaki as Akane, with Kento Kaku and Natsuna Watanabe playing male and female Ranma respectively. Ryōsei Tayama is cast as the antagonist, the new original character Okamada. The all-girl pop group 9nine contribute \"Chikutaku☆2Nite\" as the theme song. It was released on both DVD and Blu-ray on March 21, 2012.\n\n\"The Ranma ½ Memorial Book\" was published just as the manga ended in 1996. Acting as an end-cap to the series, it collects various illustrations from the series, features an interview with Takahashi, and includes tidbits about Ranma: summaries of his battles, his daily schedule, trivia, and a few exclusive illustrations. \nA \"Movie + OVA Visual Comic\" was released to illustrate the theatrical movie \"Super Indiscriminate Decisive Battle! Team Ranma vs. the Legendary Phoenix\" and the OVA episodes \"The One to Carry On\" (both parts). It also included information on the voice actors, character designs, and a layout of the Tendo dojo.\n\nAdditionally, guidebooks were released for three of the \"Ranma ½\" video games; these included not only strategies, but also interviews. Two books including interviews with the cast of the live-action TV drama, and some select stories, were released in 2011.\n\nThe music from the \"Ranma ½\" TV series, films and OVAs have been released on various CDs. Four from the TV series, two from the first movie, one from the second, one from the third movie and OVAs, and three compiling the music by DoCo used in the OVAs. DoCo is a pop group composed of the anime's main female characters' voice actresses. Several compilation albums were also released, some composed of the opening and closing theme songs and others of image songs. Many of the image songs were first released as singles.\n\nRumiko Takahashi said that after \"Urusei Yatsura\", which was popular with high school and college students, she purposefully aimed \"Ranma ½\" to be popular among women and children. Both series' peak readership figures were with 15-year-olds, but the distribution of \"Ranma ½\" readers was skewed towards younger females. By November 2006, it was reported that the series had sold over 49 million manga volumes in Japan. Shogakukan has printed 53 million copies as of November 2011. Although Lum from Takahashi's first series \"Urusei Yatsura\" is often cited as the first \"tsundere\" character in anime and manga, Theron Martin of Anime News Network stated that \"Ranma ½\"s Akane Tendo is closer to how they would later typically be portrayed in the 2000s. He also suggested that one could argue \"Ranma\" is an early example of a harem or reverse harem series, due to the main character attracting suitors in both genders. The series's publication in North America proved highly successful as well, being many Americans' first introduction to manga and its anime adaptation one of the first Japanese animation shows to achieve popularity in the US. Western comic book artists that have cited \"Ranma ½\" as an influence include Canadian Bryan Lee O'Malley on his series \"Scott Pilgrim\" and American Colleen Coover on her erotic series \"Small Favors\".\n\nIn an overview of the series, Jason Thompson called \"Ranma ½\" \"the direct ancestor of all comedy-action manga, like \"Sumomomo Momomo\" and \"History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi\"\", although noted that it was not the first, but only spanned the period when manga and anime sales were at their height. Relating it to Takahashi's other works, he summed the series up as \"At the start, the fighting is minimal and it's almost a semi-serious relationship comedy, like \"Maison Ikkoku\"; then it turns completely ridiculous; and by the climax, when Ranma fights the evil bird-people of Phoenix Mountain in an excessively long and un-funny shonen fight scene, it's like a warmup for \"Inuyasha\".\" He states that \"Eventually Takahashi adds too many characters, and the manga starts repeating itself. Because of the lack of a strong story arc, a lot of people stop reading \"Ranma ½\" at some point in the middle\". Reviewing Viz Media's final English volume of the manga, Anime News Network remarked that \"Every dimension of Rumiko Takahashi's storytelling skills come into play here: comedy, romance and introspection, and of course, high-flying fantasy martial-arts action.\" However, they felt some of the action scenes were hard to follow and noted that the mirroring to left-to-right format caused errors with the art.\n\nThe \"Ranma ½\" anime was ranked number 17 on \"Anime Insider\"'s 2001 list of the Top 50 Anime, although the list was limited to series that were released in North America. It ranked 36th on TV Asahi's 2006 list of Japan's 100 favorite animated TV series, which is based on an online poll of the Japanese people, up from the previous year's list where it ranked 45th. In November 2006, the New York Comic Con announced that it would host the first-ever American Anime Awards. Fans had the chance to vote for their favorite anime online during the month of January 2007. Only the five nominees receiving the most votes for each category were announced on February 5. Among the 12 different categories, \"Ranma ½\" was voted into the \"Best Comedy Anime\" category, and the \"Ranma ½\" OVAs were voted into the \"Best Short Series\" category. In their review of Viz Media's season five DVD box set, Anime News Network praised the Japanese cast's performance and the animation, but criticized the English version's slight script changes and minor voice actors while praising its main cast. They also remarked that while \"Ranma ½\" is a classic, after a hundred episodes, the same jokes are just not funny anymore. THEM Anime Reviews' Raphael See called the television series and the OVAs \"one of the funniest things [he's] ever seen, anime or otherwise\" and also praised the English dub as some of the best. However, he was much more critical of the first two movies particularly for both using the same damsel in distress plot. Mike Toole of ANN included \"Big Trouble in Nekronon, China\" at number 83 on The Other 100 Best Anime Movies of All Time, a list of \"lesser-known, lesser-loved classics,\" calling it \"a solid action-comedy and a good, well-rounded example of the appeal of \"Ranma ½\"\"\n\n"}

Meanwhile, a 19-year-old Sadako joins an acting troupe as an understudy as a therapy to her nightmares suggested by her doctor. Sadako has natural beauty and charisma for the play, infuriating her senior, Aiko Hazuki, whose relationship with the troupe director, Yusaku Shigemori, sours due to the latter's newfound favor for the young trainee. Aiko is later found murdered by a figure in white, thus Sadako takes her place for the upcoming play as the lead character. Sadako attracts and reciprocates the attention of the troupe sound director, Hiroshi Toyama, much to the disappointment of costume designer and Toyama's girlfriend, Etsuko Tachihara. While praised by Shigemori and Toyama, other troupe members grow to distrust and fear Sadako, as they suspect that she is the one who caused Aiko's death and other supernatural occurrences, including strange dreams pertaining to a well and an apparition of a girl in white with long hair very similar to Sadako.\n\nMeanwhile, Akiko is told by Sudo that though initially pleasant, Shizuko descended to madness before her suicide ever since her moving to live with Dr. Heihachiro Ikuma, and that Sudo heard strange childlike noises in the attic. Etsuko, wanting to discover Sadako's origins, contacts Sadako's psychiatrist, but he refuses to answer and throws away Sadako's résumé; the résumé is taken by Akiko's assistant, allowing him and Akiko to locate Sadako in the troupe. When they start to photograph her, she telekinetically breaks the camera; the two later discover that all photographs contain ghostly faces and a girl with long hair, confirming Akiko's suspicion of the existence of \"two\" Sadakos. Shigemori, having been obsessed with Sadako, says that he knows of her dark past and tells that he will kill her if she tries to kill him so they could be together. However, Toyama interrupts the process and Shigemori is killed through a cut that also wounds Toyama. However, Sadako manages to heal him just by touching him and later is able to make a disabled man regain his ability to walk. The two confess their love for each other and promise to leave the troupe and live together after finishing their last play.\n\nThe play is a disaster as Sadako, influenced by recordings of her mother's demonstration played by Etsuko, sees visions of her mother and other reporters during the demonstration and kills her psychiatrist. The troupe members, except Toyama, beat her to death, though is informed by Akiko that their job is not yet done. They visit Ikuma who tells them that Sadako, once a single individual, split into two beings resembling each of her parents; the malevolent one who resembled her unknown father is kept from growing by Ikuma in the attic. Before they can kill it, both Sadakos merge with each other and escape with Toyama. In her merged form, Sadako kills all the troupe members, including Toyama. Akiko and Etsuko manage to flee and hide in Ikuma's house but Sadako corners them and forces Akiko to shoot Etsuko before forcing her to shoot herself. \n\nSadako eventually recovers and tearfully mourns her own actions. However, Ikuma, albeit reluctantly, drugs and chases her to a nearby well, where he apologizes to her before throwing her down the well. Sadako briefly has a dream of meeting with Toyama again before cutting down to the present. She looks up and screams as the well stone is slid to its place, trapping her inside.\n\n\nIn 1999, Koji Suzuki was finishing his written sources for the Ring series by including a fourth titled \"Birthday\" which collects three short stories that filled in details of the story. Asmik Ace decided to hire \"Ring 2\" screenwriter Hiroshi Takahashi to adapt the story \"Lemonheart\" from \"Birthday\". \"Birthday\" captured the life of the character of Sadako just before she songigned to her fate seen in the later Ring series. Producer Takasige Ichise offered Hideo Nakata the chance to direct who passed on the offer.\n\nThe director for the film was Norio Tsuruta. Tsuruta had previously worked on direct-to-video horror scripts such as \"Honto ni atta kowai hanashi\" (\"Scary True Stories\") in 1991, and wrote and directed the sequel. After working on various television and direct-to-video works, Tsuruta got to work with screenwriter Hiroshi Takahashi on the segment \"The Curse\" on the television special \"Haunted School F\". Takahashi lobbied for Tsuruta to take on the film. Tsuruta referred to the film as \"a tragedy\" with a theme about \"a young woman who is oppressed because she is different from everyone else. In Japan, there is great pressure not to stray too far from the norm.\"\n\nYukie Nakama was cast in the role of Sadako. After Nakama's friends had seen \"Ring\", they teased her about her resemblance to Sadako. Nakama was later contacted by her agent who mentioned they were looking for actresses for the role of Sadako and tried out for the role. She received confirmation of her role in the next two weeks.\n\n\"Ring 0: Birthday\" was released in Japan on January 22, 2000 where it was distributed by Toho. It was released on a double bill with the film \"Isola\". The film was released direct-to-video in the United States under the title \"Ringu 0\" on August 23, 2005 by DreamWorks/Universal Home Video.\n\nOnline film database AllMovie gave the film two stars out of five, referring to it as a \"mediocre \"Carrie\" rip\" and that it \"can only be truly reviled as a desecration of the original Ringu's uniquely persuasive and subtle horror.\" The review noted that the \"film's effort to explain exactly who Sadako (Yukie Nakama) is and how she became a powerful evil force, the film heaps contrivance upon contrivance, mixing clichés from backstage melodramas with those from Carrie and all its imitators, and leaving the viewer with little beyond the strength of Nakama's appealing performance and a few mild scares to hang on to.\"\n\n\n"}

He is the protagonist of eleven adventure novels and is known throughout the South China Sea as \"The Tiger of Malaysia\".\n\nEmilio Salgari wrote several novels chronicling the adventures of Sandokan and Yanez, two of his most legendary creations. The pirates are introduced in \"The Tigers of Mompracem\", which portrays their relentless struggle against the Dutch and British powers that seek to wipe them out. In subsequent novels they battle against James Brooke, the Raja of Sarawak and also travel to India to measure themselves against the Thugs, a notorious band of stranglers devoted to the goddess Kali.\n\nThe titles in the series are:\n\n\nThe last two titles were published posthumously.\n\nThere were also several other Sandokan titles published by Italian authors Luigi Motta, Emilio Fancelli and Salgari's son Omar.\n\nPaco Ignacio Taibo II has written a modern Sandokan novel called The Return of the Tigers of Malaysia.\n\nSandokan is the son of Kaigadan, the last of a dynasty of rulers of Borneo, whose parents were massacred by the British to take the throne. Sandokan has sworn revenge on them and assembles a group of rebel pirates, the Tigers of Mompracem, to attack them, which earns him the name of \"The Tiger of Malaysia\". Stranded in Labuan, Sandokan is recovering of his wounds in the house of Lord James Guillonk when he meets Marianna, \"The Pearl of Labuan,\" the niece of Guillonk with whom he falls in love. Although having to escape, Sandokan manages to meet Marianna again and they marry eventually. Defeated by the British, he manages to free his men and apparently gives up piracy and escapes to Java with his wife.\n\nSandokan and his friend Yanez De Gomera, later help Kammamuri to fight James Brooke, \"The Exterminator\", the White Rajah of Sarawak, so as to free Tremal-Naik. Sandokan eventually has to help Tremal-Naik again, when his daughter is kidnapped by the Thugs of the Kali, a sect of killers commanded by Suyodhana, \"The Tiger of India.\"\n\nAfter many battles throughout the years, Sandokan manages to defeat all of his enemies and retires as rajah of Kili Balù, while his friend Yanez is appointed rajah of Assam.\n\nSandokan is depicted by Salgari as a gallant pirate. He is described as tall, charming, very muscular, slender and attractive, with cold, black eyes, a fierce and severe look, a big turban on his head. Unlike his troops, who are described as mostly half-naked, Sandokan always wears fine oriental clothes, generally red silk with embroidered gold, and long red leather boots.\n\nSandokan is a formidable fighter, brave, ruthless with his enemies, but kind, generous and faithful to his friends. He has absolute leadership over his men, and is often shown as having no fear, with Yanez playing as a sort of counterweight to his impulsive nature.\n\n\nThe first Sandokan films were made in 1941 Italy with Luigi Pavese as Sandokan\n\n\nA series of Italian-made films with American leads were filmed in 1964 and released internationally.\n\n\nA pair of Italian films featuring a character named \"Sandok\" were filmed based on the character by Salgari\n\n\nIn 1976, Indian actor Kabir Bedi played the lead in \"Sandokan\", a six-part miniseries for European television directed by Sergio Sollima. Carole André was cast as Lady Marianna Guillonk, Philippe Leroy played Sandokan's trusted friend and lieutenant Yanez De Gomera. The role of the main antagonist James Brooke was performed by Adolfo Celi.\n\nThe series included the episodes:\n\n\nIn 1977 Kabir Bedi reprised his role in the film \"\" (a.k.a. \"The Tiger Lives Again: Sandokan To The Rescue!\"). The TV series theme song, Sandokan, was composed by Oliver Onions (a pseudonym of the De Angelis brothers), and made the Top 10 in many European countries, albeit mostly in the translated English version.\n\nA 2004 documentary \"Sandokan's Adventure\" detailed the making of the series.\n\n\"Sandokan\" the animated series was released in 1992 by Spanish animation studio BRB International, and broadcast in the United Kingdom on Channel 4 and Republic of Ireland on RTE Two. This children's animated show, written by Doug Stone and Dave Mallow, is loosely based on Salgari's novels. In the show Sandakan (here an anthropomorphized tiger) is an usurped prince who travels the seas as a pirate seeking to reclaim his rightful throne from the Rajah of Sarawak. The first nine episodes of the series are available in three DVD volumes in the United Kingdom. A condensed version of the series was released as an animated movie, \"The Princess and the Pirate\", in 1995.\n\nAnother animated series was released in 1998 from a coproduction among RAI on 1993-94, Studio Sek and Mondo TV and broadcast in Italy on Rai 1. This series was composed into three parts: \"Sandokan, la tigre della Malesia\" (\"Sandokan, the Tiger of Malaysia\", produced in 1998); \"Sandokan, la tigre ruggisce ancora\" (\"Sandokan, the Tiger roars again\", 2000); \"Sandokan, le due tigrie\" (\"Sandokan, The Two Tiger\", 2004).\nThe adventures of this 26 episode cartoon series are based on the stories of the famous Italian novelist Emilio Salgari (1862–1911). The story takes place in the second half of the 19th century, and is situated in the Malaysian archipelago, Borneo, and India. Co-produced with RAI Italy, and TF1 France, the series achieved a big success such that it a second series was decided to be produced on this character.

These treatises were once attributed to Hucbald, but this is no longer accepted.\n\nThe \"Scolica enchiriadis\" is written as a tripartite dialogue, and despite being a commentary on the \"Musica enchiriadis\", it is nearly three times as long. Much of the theory discussed by the treatise is indebted to Augustinian conceptions of music, especially its affirmations of the importance of mathematics to music as kindred disciplines of the \"quadrivium\". Later sections draw heavily on the music theory of Boethius and Cassiodorus, two early medieval authors whose works on music were widely read and circulated hundreds of years after their death. The treatise makes use of the monochord to explain interval relations. The treatise also discusses singing technique, ornamentation of plainchant, and polyphony in the style of organum. \n\nThe scale used in the work, which is based on a system of tetrachords, appears to have been created solely for use in the work itself rather than taken from actual musical practice. The treatise also uses a very rare system of notation, known as Daseian notation. This notation has a number of figures which are rotated ninety degrees to represent different pitches.\n\nA critical edition of the treatises was published in 1981, and an English translation by Raymond Erickson in 1995.\n\n\n"}

India has produced a number of tennis players, who have achieved international recognition and have made their presence in some of the top tennis tournaments and grand slams. All India Tennis Association (AITA) established in 1920, is the governing body of tennis in India and is a member of the Asian Tennis Federation. India Davis Cup team is the most successful team of Asia in Davis Cup, who has finished as runners-up 3 times.\n\nTennis has been a popular sport in India since around the 1880s when the British Army and Civilian Officers brought the game to India. Soon after regular tournaments like the 'Punjab Lawn tennis Championship' at Lahore (Now in Pakistan) (1885); 'Bengal Lawn Tennis Championship' at Calcutta (now Kolkata) (1887) and the 'All India Tennis Championships' at Allahabad (1910) were organised. In the history of major tournaments, India has already beaten among others France, Romania, Holland, Belgium, Spain and Greece in Davis Cup ties (1921 to 1929).\n\nThe history of tennis in India goes back a long way. In the 1880s, the Britishers introduced the game of tennis in India during the colonial rule and soon it started gaining momentum. BK Nehru in 1905 and Sardar Nihal Singh in 1908 were later joined by M Saleem, Fayzee brothers and Jagat Mohan Lal who made it to last 16 stages at the Wimbledon. Ghaus Mohammad was the first Indian to reach the quarterfinals at Wimbledon in 1939 where he lost to American champion Bobby Riggs.\n\nAccording to the All India Tennis Association, in Davis Cup ties between 1921 and 1929, India beat, among others, France, Romania, Holland, Belgium, Spain and Greece. Top Indian players like Saleem, Fayzee brothers, Cotah Ramaswamy and Krishna Prasad beat a large number of ranked European players and teams to bring glory to the nation.\n\nIn the 1960s, the sport witnessed a golden era. Ramanathan Krishnan earned his highest seeding – No. 4 in Wimbledon in 1962. In the Davis Cup, India repeatedly became the Zonal Champions. Ramanathan Krishnan, along with Premjit Lal, SP Misra, Jaidip and RK Khanna as the non-playing captain, steered India to the Cup finals in 1966. They lost the Cup but not before Krishnan and J Mukerjea beat New Combe and Tony Roche, the Wimbledon champions, (1965) in doubles.\n\nIn the 1970s, Vijay Amritraj burst onto the scene. With teammates Sashi Menon, Jasjit Singh and brother Anand Amritraj, Vijay took India to World Cup Finals for the second time in 1974. Vijay also made it to the quarterfinals of US Open in 1973 and 1981; and Wimbledon in 1973 and 1974. Ramesh Krishnan, the son of Ramanathan Krishnan, won the junior Wimbledon championship and junior French Open title in 1979 and was ranked number 1 junior in the world. He made it to the quarterfinals at Wimbledon (1986) as US Open (twice).\n\nMore recently, Somdev Devvarman and Yuki Bhambri have been carrying the Indian flag in Men's singles category. There are also a few other players who have been representing the country in the Men's single category such as Prajnesh Gunneswaran, Saketh Myneni, and Sumit Nagal. \n\nIn 1997, India won their first Grand Slam title at the French open, in the Mixed Doubles.

O'Connor, with Arnold Vosloo in the titular role as the reanimated mummy. It is a loose remake of the 1932 film \"The Mummy\". In this film, adventurer Rick O'Connell travels to Hamunaptra, the city of the dead, with an archaeologist and her brother. There they accidentally awaken Imhotep, a high priest from the reign of the pharaoh Seti I who has been cursed for eternity.\n\nFilming began in Marrakech, Morocco, on May 4, 1998, and lasted seventeen weeks; the crew had to endure dehydration, sandstorms, and snakes while filming in the Sahara. The visual effects were provided by Industrial Light & Magic, who blended film and computer-generated imagery to create the titular mummy. Jerry Goldsmith provided the orchestral score.\n\n\"The Mummy\" opened on May 7, 1999, and grossed $43 million in 3,210 theaters during its opening weekend in the United States; a surprise hit, the film went on to gross $416 million worldwide. The box-office success led to a 2001 sequel, \"The Mummy Returns\", as well as an animated series, and the prequel/spin-off film \"The Scorpion King\". Seven years later, the third installment, \"\", opened on August 1, 2008. Universal Pictures also opened a roller coaster, \"Revenge of the Mummy\", in 2004. Novelizations of the film and its sequels were written by Max Allan Collins.\n\nIn Thebes, Egypt, 1290 BC, high priest Imhotep has a love affair with Anck-su-Namun, the mistress of Pharaoh Seti I. When the Pharaoh discovers the affair, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun assassinate him. Imhotep flees, while Anck-su-Namun kills herself, intending for Imhotep to resurrect her. Imhotep and his priests steal her corpse and travel to Hamunaptra, the city of the dead, but the resurrection ritual is stopped by Seti's bodyguards, the Medjai. Imhotep's priests are all mummified alive, while Imhotep himself is sentenced to suffer the Hom Dai, the worst of Egyptian curses, buried alive with flesh-eating scarab beetles. Imhotep is sealed away in a sarcophagus at the feet of a statue of the Egyptian god Anubis and kept under strict surveillance by the Medjai to prevent Imhotep's return.\n\nIn 1926, Jonathan Carnahan presents his sister, Evelyn, a Cairo librarian and aspiring Egyptologist, with an intricate box and map, which leads to Hamunaptra. Jonathan reveals he stole the box from an American adventurer, Rick O'Connell, who discovered the city three years earlier while in the French Foreign Legion. Rick makes a deal with Evelyn to lead them there if they release him from prison.\n\nRick leads Evelyn and her party to the city, where the group encounters a band of American treasure hunters guided by Rick's cowardly colleague Beni Gabor. The expeditions are attacked by the Medjai, led by the warrior Ardeth Bay. Against Ardeth's advice to leave the city, the two expeditions continue to excavate. Evelyn searches for the famous Book of the Living, a book made of pure gold. Instead of finding the book, she, Rick, and Jonathan stumble upon the statue of Anubis and the remains of Imhotep buried underneath. The team of Americans, meanwhile, discover the black Book of the Dead, accompanied by canopic jars carrying Anck-su-Namun's preserved organs.\n\nAt night, Evelyn takes the Book of the Dead and reads a page aloud, accidentally awakening Imhotep. The expeditions return to Cairo, but Imhotep follows them with the help of Beni. Imhotep returns to full strength by killing the members of the American expedition one by one, and brings the ten plagues back to Egypt. Seeking a way to stop Imhotep, Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan meet Ardeth at a museum. Ardeth hypothesizes that Imhotep wants to resurrect Anck-su-Namun again and plans to do so by sacrificing Evelyn. Evelyn believes that if the Book of the Dead brought Imhotep back to life, the Book of the Living can kill him again, and deduces the book's whereabouts. Imhotep corners the group with an army of slaves. Evelyn agrees to accompany Imhotep if he spares the rest of the group.\n\nImhotep, Evelyn, and Beni return to Hamunaptra, pursued by Rick, Jonathan, and Ardeth. Imhotep prepares to sacrifice Evelyn, but she is rescued after an intense battle with Imhotep's mummified priests. When Evelyn reads from the Book of Amun-Ra, Imhotep becomes mortal again, and Rick forces him into the River of Death. Imhotep leaves the world of the living, but not before vowing revenge by saying \"Death is only the beginning.\". While looting treasure from the pyramid, Beni accidentally sets off an ancient booby trap and is trapped by a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs as Hamunaptra collapses into the sand. Ardeth rides away as Rick and Evelyn kiss and, with Jonathan, ride off into the sunset on a pair of camels laden with Beni's treasure.\n\n\nIn 1992, producers James Jacks and Sean Daniel decided to update the original \"Mummy\" film for the 1990s. Universal Studios gave them the go-ahead, but only if they kept the budget around $10 million. Jacks remembers that the studio \"essentially wanted a low-budget horror franchise\"; in response, Jacks and Daniel recruited horror filmmaker/writer Clive Barker on board to direct. Barker's vision for the film was violent, with the story revolving around the head of a contemporary art museum who turns out to be a cultist trying to reanimate mummies. Jacks recalls that Barker's take was \"dark, sexual and filled with mysticism\", and that, \"it would have been a great low-budget movie\". After several meetings, Barker and Universal lost interest and parted company.\n\nDirector Joe Dante was the next choice, increasing the budget for his idea of Daniel Day-Lewis as a brooding Mummy. This version's draft was written by Alan Ormsby, and was later re-written by John Sayles. It was set in contemporary times and focused on reincarnation with elements of a love story. It came close to being made with some elements, like the flesh-eating scarabs, making it to the final product. However, at that point, the studio wanted a film with a budget of $15 million and rejected Dante's version.\n\nFilmmaker George A. Romero was brought in with a vision of a zombie-style horror film similar to \"Night of the Living Dead\", but which also relied heavily upon elements of tragic romance and ambivalence of identity. Romero completed a draft in October 1994, co-written with Ormsby and Sayles, that revolved around female archaeologist Helen Grover and her discovery in Abydos of the tomb of Imhotep, an Egyptian general who lived in the time of Ramesses II. Unfolding in a nameless American city in modern times, events are set into motion when Imhotep inadvertently awakens as a result of his preserved cadaver having been exposed to rays from an MRI scan in a high-tech forensic archaeology lab. The script progresses to a fish-out-of-water story when Imhotep, having regained his youthful appearance, recognizes the need to adapt to a contemporary society that is three thousand years removed from the one he came from. Assuming at first that he is a representative from the Bureau of Antiquities, Helen finds herself drawn into a tentative relationship with Imhotep while also experiencing clairvoyant flashbacks to a previous life in Nineteenth Dynasty Egypt as a priestess of Isis. Summoning mystical powers through incantation, Imhotep later resurrects the mummy of Karis, a loyal slave whose body had been resting alongside his master's in the same tomb but is now held in the local museum. After escaping into the city sewer system, Karis embarks on a vengeful rampage against the various criminal fences and high society antiquarians who had acquired stolen relics from his tomb. Romero's script was considered too dark and violent by Jacks and the studio, who wanted a more accessible picture. Compounding the issue was the fact that Romero was unable to extricate from a contract for a different film project he had in negotiation at the time with MGM, and so his involvement with the film was severed and the development of an entirely new script was commissioned to other writers.\n\nMick Garris was attached to direct but eventually left the project, and Wes Craven was offered the film but turned it down. Stephen Sommers called Jacks and Daniel in 1997 with his vision of \"The Mummy\" \"as a kind of Indiana Jones or \"Jason and the Argonauts\" with the mummy as the creature giving the hero a hard time\". Sommers had seen the original film when he was eight, and wanted to recreate the things he liked about it on a bigger scale. He had wanted to make a \"Mummy\" film since 1993, but other writers or directors were always attached. Finally, Sommers received his window of opportunity and pitched his idea to Universal with an 18-page treatment. At the time, Universal's management had changed in response to the box office failure of \"\", and the loss led the studio to want to revisit its successful franchises from the 1930s. Universal liked this idea so much that they approved the concept and increased the budget from $15 million to $80 million.\n\nFilming began in Marrakech, Morocco on May 4, 1998 and lasted 17 weeks. Photography moved to the Sahara desert outside the small town of Erfoud, and to the United Kingdom before completion of shooting on August 29, 1998. The crew could not shoot in Egypt because of the unstable political conditions. To avoid dehydration in the scorching heat of the Sahara, the production's medical team created a drink that the cast and crew had to consume every two hours. Sandstorms were daily inconveniences. Snakes, spiders and scorpions were a major problem, with many crew members having to be airlifted out after being bitten.\n\nBrendan Fraser nearly died during a scene where his character is hanged. Weisz remembered, \"He [Fraser] stopped breathing and had to be resuscitated.\" The production had the official support of the Moroccan army, and the cast members had kidnapping insurance taken out on them, a fact Sommers disclosed to the cast only after shooting had finished.\n\nProduction designer Allan Cameron found a dormant volcano near Erfoud where the entire set for Hamunaptra could be constructed. Sommers liked the location because, \"A city hidden in the crater of an extinct volcano made perfect sense. Out in the middle of the desert you would never see it. You would never think of entering the crater unless you knew what was inside that volcano.\" A survey of the volcano was conducted so that an accurate model and scale models of the columns and statues could be replicated back at Shepperton Studios, where all of the scenes involving the underground passageways of the City of the Dead were shot. These sets took 16 weeks to build, and included fiberglass columns rigged with special effects for the movie's final scenes. Another large set was constructed in the United Kingdom on the dockyard at Chatham which doubled for the Giza Port on the River Nile. This set was in length and featured \"a steam train, an Ajax traction engine, three cranes, an open two-horse carriage, four horse-drawn carts, five dressing horses and grooms, nine pack donkeys and mules, as well as market stalls, Arab-clad vendors and room for 300 costumed extras\".\n\nThe filmmakers reportedly spent $15 million of the $80 million budget on special effects, provided by Industrial Light & Magic; the producers wanted a new look for the Mummy so that they would avoid comparisons to past movies. John Andrew Berton, Jr., Industrial Light & Magic's Visual Effects Supervisor on \"The Mummy\", started developing the look three months before filming started. He said that he wanted the Mummy \"to be mean, tough, nasty, something that had never been seen by audiences before\". Berton used motion capture in order to achieve \"a menacing and very realistic Mummy\". Specific photography was conducted on actor Arnold Vosloo so that the special effects crew could see exactly how he moved and replicate it.\n\nTo create the Mummy, Berton used a combination of live action and computer graphics. He matched the digital prosthetic make-up pieces on Vosloo's face during filming. Berton said, \"When you see his film image, that's him. When he turns his head and half of his face is missing and you can see right through on to his teeth, that's really his face. And that's why it was so hard to do.\" Vosloo described the filming as a \"whole new thing\" for him; \"They had to put these little red tracking lights all over my face so they could map in the special effects. A lot of the time I was walking around the set looking like a Christmas tree.\" Make-Up Effects Supervisor Nick Dudman produced the physical creature effects in the film, including three-dimensional make-up and prosthetics. He also designed all of the animatronic effects. While the film made extensive use of computer generated imagery, many scenes, including ones where Rachel Weisz's character is covered with rats and locusts, were real, using live animals.\n\nThe Mummy: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was composed and conducted by Jerry Goldsmith, with orchestrations provided by Alexander Courage. The soundtrack was released by Decca Records on May 4, 1999. Like many Goldsmith scores, the main theme uses extensive brass and percussion elements; Goldsmith also used sparing amounts of vocals, highly unusual for most of his work.\n\nOverall, Goldsmith's score was well received. AllMusic described it as a \"grand, melodramatic score\" which delivered the expected highlights. Other reviews positively noted the dark, percussive sound meshed well with the plot, as well as the raw power of the music. The limited but masterful use of the chorus was also lauded, and most critics found the final track on the CD to be the best overall. On the other hand, some critics found the score lacked cohesion, and that the constant heavy action lent itself to annoying repetition. Roderick Scott off CineMusic.net summed up the score as \"representative of both Goldsmith's absolute best and his most mediocre. Thankfully [...] his favourable work on this release wins out.\"\n\n\"The Mummy\" opened on May 7, 1999, and grossed $43 million in 3,210 theaters in the United States on its opening weekend. The film went on to gross $415 million worldwide (Domestic: $155 million; Foreign: $260 million).\n\n\"The Mummy\" received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds a 57% rating, based on 87 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"It's difficult to make a persuasive argument for \"The Mummy\" as any kind of meaningful cinematic achievement, but it's undeniably fun to watch.\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 48 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nRoger Ebert, of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, writing \"There is hardly a thing I can say in its favor, except that I was cheered by nearly every minute of it. I cannot argue for the script, the direction, the acting or even the mummy, but I can say that I was not bored and sometimes I was unreasonably pleased.\" Likewise, Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a \"B−\" grade and said, \"\"The Mummy\" would like to make you shudder, but it tries to do so without ever letting go of its jocular inconsequentiality.\" Bob Graham of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" gave the film high marks for the acting as well as the special effects.\n\nStephen Holden from \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"This version of \"The Mummy\" has no pretenses to be anything other than a gaudy comic video game splashed onto the screen. Think \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" with cartoon characters, no coherent story line and lavish but cheesy special effects. Think \"Night of the Living Dead\" stripped of genuine horror and restaged as an Egyptian-theme Halloween pageant. Think \"Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy\" grafted onto a Bing Crosby-Bob Hope road picture (\"The Road to Hamunaptra\"?) and pumped up into an epic-size genre spoof.\" Publications like \"The Austin Chronicle\" and \"Dallas Observer\" came to the conclusion that despite good acting and special effects, the movie lacked cohesion; talking about the special effects, the \"Observer\" lamented \"If only generating a soul for the film itself were so easy.\" Other publications such as \"Jump Cut\" felt that Industrial Light and Magic's lock on special effects proved detrimental to \"The Mummy\"; \"The mummy\", Ernest Larson wrote for the \"Jump Cut\", \"is standard-issue I.L.&M.\". Kim Newman of the British Film Institute judged the picture inferior to the original, as all the time was spent on special effects, instead of creating the atmosphere which made the original film such a classic. \"USA Today\" gave the film two out of four stars and felt that it was \"not free of stereotypes\", a sentiment with which the BFI concurred. \"If someone complains of a foul odor, you can be sure an Arab stooge is about to enter a scene. Fraser, equally quick with weapon, fist or quip, may save the day, but even he can't save the picture\", \"USA Today\" wrote.\n\n\"The Mummy\"s box office performance led to numerous sequels and spinoffs. In 2001, the sequel \"The Mummy Returns\" was released; the film features most of the surviving principal characters, as a married Rick and Evelyn confront Imhotep and the Scorpion King. The film also introduced the heroes' son, Alex. The two films inspired both an animated series which lasted two seasons, and a spin-off prequel, \"The Scorpion King\" (2002), telling the story of the Akkadian warrior as he was crowned king. It is also includes three sequels and one prequel.\n\nA second sequel, called \"\", was released on August 1, 2008. The story takes place in China with the \"Terracotta Emperor\" inspiring the villain, while Rachel Weisz was replaced with Maria Bello.\n\nTwo video game adaptations of \"The Mummy\" were published by Konami and Universal Interactive in 2000: an Action Adventure for the PlayStation and PC developed by Rebellion Developments, as well as a Game Boy Color puzzle game developed by Konami Nagoya. The film also inspired a roller coaster, \"Revenge of the Mummy\" in three Universal Studios Theme Parks: Hollywood, California; Orlando, Florida; and Sentosa, Singapore.\n\nOn April 4, 2012, Universal announced their plans to reboot the franchise. The film is intended to be the first installment in the Dark Universe, titled \"The Mummy\", and was released in June 2017.\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "302938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=302938", "title": "The Nanny", "text": "The Nanny\n\nThe Nanny is an American television sitcom which originally aired on CBS from 1993 to 1999, starring Fran Drescher as Fran Fine, a Jewish fashion queen from Flushing, New York who becomes the nanny of three children from the New York/British high society.\n\nThe show was created and produced by Drescher and her husband Peter Marc Jacobson, taking much of its inspiration from Drescher's personal life growing up in Queens, involving names and characteristics based on her relatives and friends. The show earned a Rose d'Or and one Emmy Award, out of a total of twelve nominations, and Drescher was twice nominated for a Golden Globe and an Emmy. The sitcom has also spawned several foreign adaptations, loosely inspired by the original scripts.\n\nJewish-American Fran Fine turns up on the doorstep of British Broadway producer Maxwell Sheffield (Charles Shaughnessy) to sell cosmetics after having been both dumped and fired by her boyfriend and employer Danny Imperialli. Instead, she finds herself the nanny of Maxwell's three children: Maggie, Brighton, and Grace. Maxwell Sheffield is unhappy about it at first, but Fran turns out to be just what he and his family needed.\n\nWhile Fran Fine manages the children, butler Niles (Daniel Davis) manages the household and watches all the events that unfold with Fran as the new nanny. Niles, recognizing Fran's gift for bringing warmth back to the family, does his best to undermine Maxwell's business partner C.C. Babcock (Lauren Lane) who has her eyes on the very available Maxwell Sheffield. Niles is often seen making witty comments directed towards C.C with C.C often replying with a comment of her own in their ongoing game of one-upmanship.\n\nAs the series progresses, it becomes increasingly obvious that Maxwell is smitten with Fran even though he won't admit it, and Fran is smitten with him. The show teases the viewers with their closeness and \"near misses\" as well as with an engagement. Towards the later seasons, they finally marry and expand their family by having fraternal twins. By the end of the series, it's also clear that Niles and C.C.'s constant sharp barbs are their bizarre form of flirtation, after a few false starts (including multiple impulsive and failed proposals from Niles) the pair marry in the series finale.\n\nFran Fine is the nasal voiced, outgoing protagonist of the series who stumbles upon the Sheffields' doorstep and winds up as the nanny to Mr. Sheffield's three children: Maggie, Brighton, and Grace. She starts off working for her boyfriend Danny Imperialli in a bridal shop but is dumped and fired not long after. She ends up meeting Maxwell Sheffield and his family while going door to door to sell cosmetics. Her character has an outgoing and humorous personality. Fran, as a result of her mother's overbearing personality, often feels the need to date and is compelled to get married as well. She is usually seen getting into trouble and having to solve those problems through using her street smarts. \n\nMaxwell Sheffield is the male protagonist who ends up hiring Fran Fine to watch over his three children, Maggie, Brighton, and Grace. He is a widowed Broadway producer, having lost his wife Sara four years before the start of the series. While he does have some success as a Broadway producer, he remains constantly in the shadow of his rival Andrew Lloyd Webber, who always seems to have the upper hand. He does not spend a lot of time with his children due to his busy schedule, hence he ends up hiring Fran Fine as the children's nanny. Despite his mutual attraction to Fran, he tries to keep their relationship professional for fear of commitment.\n\nMargaret Sheffield is the eldest child of Maxwell Sheffield. She is constantly seen bickering with her brother, Brighton, who views her as a nerd. While she is constantly fighting with Brighton, her relationship with her sister, Grace, is more one of mentorship. Towards the beginning of the series, Maggie is shy and awkward but, with Fran's influence, she becomes a somewhat popular young woman. Upon meeting Fran Fine, the two bond almost instantly.\n\nBrighton Sheffield is the middle child of the family and the only son of Maxwell Sheffield. Due to being the only son, he often feels left out. This causes him to purposely bring about trouble for his two sisters. He doesn't bond with Fran Fine at first, having disliked all his previous nannies, but eventually becomes close with her as well. He plans to become a Broadway producer, like his father.\n\nGrace Sheffield is the youngest child in the Sheffield family. She has a habit of naming medical conditions and complicated words. When Fran first became her nanny, Grace was in therapy. But, under Fran Fine's influence and guidance, she eventually doesn't need therapy any more. As the two became close to one another Grace started picking up some of Fran's Jewish slang and dressing habits, eventually thinking of Fran as a mother to her.\n\nC.C. Babcock is the egocentric business partner of Maxwell Sheffield, with whom she has been working for almost 20 years. She clearly wants him as more than a business partner. Maxwell, however, appears oblivious and Babcock has yet to make a serious move on him. She never seems to be able to remember the names of Maxwell's three children. From her first meeting with Fran Fine, she accurately views the newly hired nanny as a threat and tries to undermine her. Fran is not C.C.'s only enemy in the Sheffield house, as she has an even more contentious relationship with his longtime butler Niles (who hates her just as much as she hates him).\n\nNiles is the loyal butler and chauffeur for the Sheffield family. He and Maxwell have known each other their whole lives. He bonds with Fran Fine immediately, viewing her as the breath of fresh air that the Sheffield family needs. Niles is known as the household snoop as he is constantly seen listening in on conversations via intercoms, keyholes, and even in the very rooms where the conversations are taking place. He tends to manipulate events in Fran's favor to undermine C.C., his nemesis. In spite of this, over time it becomes clear that Niles has himself fallen for C.C. and their contentious relationship is a cover for mutual lust.\n\n\"The Nanny\" maintained an ensemble cast, keeping the same set of characters for its entire six-season run. Renée Taylor, Ann Morgan Guilbert, and Rachel Chagall were only given starring credit for their roles in the final season, even though they appeared in most episodes of the series, particularly in seasons where the role of the Sheffield children was somewhat reduced.\n\nAlthough largely operating around the main ensemble cast, \"The Nanny\" featured an enormous number of guest stars over the years. Notable repeat guests included Lainie Kazan as Fran's paternal aunt Freida Fine, Steve Lawrence as Fran's never before seen father Morty Fine, Pamela Anderson as Fran's nemesis Heather Biblow, Ray Charles as Yetta's fiancé Sammy, Spalding Gray as Dr. Jack Miller, Fred Stoller for the frequently featured pharmacist Fred, and Andrew Levitas as Maggie's boyfriend Michael.\n\nSome celebrities guested as characters in single episodes, such as John Astin, Roseanne as Fran's cousin Sheila, Joan Collins as Maxwell's stepmother, Robert Vaughn as Maxwell's father, and Dina Merrill as his mother. Others appeared as themselves, primarily in connection with Maxwell's business relations, such as Bob Barker, Chevy Chase, Robert Culp, Billy Ray Cyrus, Lesley-Anne Down, Erik Estrada, Dan Aykroyd, Joe Lando, Richard Kline, Bette Midler, Eydie Gormé, Jane Seymour, Cloris Leachman, Elizabeth Taylor, Elton John, Jason Alexander, Lamb Chop and Shari Lewis, Andrew Dice Clay, Lynn Redgrave, Hugh Grant, Margaret Cho, Jeanne Cooper, Melody Thomas Scott, Eric Braeden, Shemar Moore, Joshua Morrow, Hunter Tylo; media personalities Roger Clinton, Alicia Machado, Rita Moreno (who would later play Fran's mother, Dori, on her later series, \"Happily Divorced\"), Jay Leno, David Letterman, Sally Jessy Raphael and Donald Trump; and musicians Ray Charles, Michael Bolton, Patti LaBelle, Lisa Loeb, Eartha Kitt, Brian Setzer, Celine Dion, Rapper Coolio, Whoopi Goldberg, Steve Lawrence, and Rosie O'Donnell. Jonathan Penner appeared as Fran's former fiancé, Danny Imperialli. James Marsden appeared as Maggie's boyfriend, Eddie, and Telma Hopkins appeared as Fran's \"mother\" in the episode \"Fran's Roots\". Scott Baio made an appearance as a rookie doctor who was Fran's former schoolmate. Jon Stewart portrayed a Jewish love interest of Fran's until it was discovered at a family wedding that the two were cousins; on the June 29, 2011 airing of \"The Daily Show\", Stewart stated he agreed to make an appearance after receiving a personal call from Fran Drescher.\n\nMarvin Hamlisch appeared as Fran's former high school music teacher, a Marvin Hamlisch look-alike. Fran Drescher also reprised her role of Bobbi Fleckman from the 1984 film \"This Is Spinal Tap\" and made a cameo appearance as herself in the third to last episode. Charles Shaughnessy had a double role as a foreign sultan in one episode. Drescher's real-life parents, Morty and Sylvia, initially appeared as a couple in the waiting room of Grace's therapist and made subsequent appearances as Fran's Uncle Stanley and Aunt Rose; her Pomeranian Chester appeared as C.C.'s pet in more than a dozen episodes. Renée Taylor's husband, actor Joseph Bologna, and their son Gabriel Bologna, had minor roles as doctors on the show. Ray Romano appeared as Fran's former high school classmate Ray Barone, linking \"The Nanny\" with his comedy \"Everybody Loves Raymond\". Romano and Drescher actually did know each other in high school. Tom Bergeron appeared as himself, the host of \"Hollywood Squares\", in an episode in which Maxwell appeared as a star on the show's board as a replacement for Andrew Lloyd Webber. Tyne Daly appeared as a fellow nanny facing forced retirement. David Letterman made an uncredited appearance during a fantasy sequence, where Fran describes how she exaggerated her fame to impress a pen pal.\n\nThe theme song featured in the pilot was a version of \"If My Friends Could See Me Now\", performed by Gwen Verdon from the 1966 Broadway musical \"Sweet Charity\". Following the pilot, the theme changed to \"The Nanny Named Fran\", written by Ann Hampton Callaway and performed by her and her sister Liz Callaway. Two instrumental versions of the theme song were used in the closing credits: one that is a direct instrumental version of the theme (used only in a few season one episodes), and another with a slightly different arrangement.\n\nThe opening sequence for the pilot featured Fran in front of a white background, getting herself made up going to work as the nanny; at the end of the sequence, it shows Fran heading toward a stroller and a lipstick print appears to the above right.\n\nAlong with the change of the theme song from \"If My Friends Could See Me Now\" to \"The Nanny Named Fran\" came the change of the opening sequence, which like the theme, describes (with the main characters in animated form) the story of how Fran Fine went from being fired from the bridal shop by Danny Imperiali to becoming the nanny of the Sheffield children. The opening sequence remained the same even though Renée Taylor, Ann Guilbert and Rachel Chagall began to be credited as \"starring\" in the in-show credits beginning in season five. The only change to the sequence was in season six when producer Kathy Landsberg was promoted to co-executive producer of the series as her producer credit was moved to the in-show credits, while the creator credits of Drescher and Jacobson, and the developer credits of Sternin and Fraser were added in its place.\n\nThe animated opening sequence begins with Fran Fine walking into the bridal shop, only to be kicked out by Danny Imperalli. Then, she hitches a ride in a cab, crosses the bridge from Queens, New York to Manhattan and arrives at the Sheffield mansion. Maxwell Sheffield opens the door and observes Fran. Then, he pulls her inside and she falls into the flower pot. Niles dusts her off and puts a cap on her head that reads \"Nanny\". Fran whistles for Maggie, Brighton and Gracie and the four of them form a conga line. C. C. arrives at the door and Fran bumps the door with her hip to close it in her face. Finally, the Sheffields, Niles and Fran gather on the couch for a group picture similar to that of the \"One Day at a Time\" series opening. However, when Fran presses the camera's button, smoke emits from the camera, covering the entire group in dust and messing up their best clothes.\n\nRosie O'Donnell employed the same team that created the Nanny's opening credits to do the opening credits for her popular daytime talk show.\nO'Donnell mentioned this in an interview with Drescher on that show.\n\nIn the background is the picture of the family as if the camera incident never happened.\n\n\"The Nanny\" began in 1991 with a chance meeting on a transatlantic flight between Drescher and Jeff Sagansky, at the time president of CBS Corporation, for whom she had starred in the short-lived TV series \"Princesses\". Drescher persuaded Sagansky to let her and her then-husband Jacobson pitch an idea for a sitcom to CBS. Sagansky agreed to a future meeting once all of the parties were back in Los Angeles; however, neither Drescher nor Jacobson had any idea what to pitch.\n\nLater, while in London, Drescher was visiting friend Twiggy Lawson and her family in London, England, where she went on a culture-clash shopping tour with Lawson's then teenage daughter. Drescher was inspired by her behavior towards the teenage daughter on the shopping trip as functioning in a less parental but \"humorous [...] kind of Queens logic, self-serving advice\" mode.\n\nDrescher immediately called her husband in Los Angeles with her sitcom idea, which she pitched as a spin on \"The Sound of Music\", except, in Drescher's words: \"Instead of Julie Andrews, I come to the door.\" Jacobson replied: \"That could be it\" and the idea for \"The Nanny\" was spawned.\n\nBack in Los Angeles, the pair pitched their idea to Tim Flack and Joe Voci, both in comedy development at CBS. Sagansky brought in experienced producers Robert Sternin and Prudence Fraser, another husband-and-wife team with whom Drescher had worked before while guesting on \"Who's the Boss?\" in 1985 and 1986. Interested, both couples teamed up to write the script for the pilot together, creating a character with the intention to build off Drescher's image. \"Our business strategy was to create a show that was going to complement our writing, complement me as a talent,\" Drescher said in a 1997 interview with \"The Hollywood Reporter\". As a result, the characters draw deeply on the Drescher family, including Fran Fine's parents, Sylvia and Morty, and grandmother Yetta, who all were named after their real-life counterparts. Drescher also drew from her own life in creating her character. Like the character in \"The Nanny\", Drescher was born and raised in Flushing, Queens, and attended beauty school. However, unlike her on-screen counterpart, Drescher never worked in a bridal shop; Drescher wrote that into the character as a tribute to her mother, who did work in a bridal shop. While visiting with his relatives in Fort Lauderdale around the holidays, Sagansky watched a few episodes with his relatives, realized that he had a hit, and ordered a full 22 episodes for the first season.\n\nMost of the early episodes of \"The Nanny\" were shot in front of a live studio audience on Stage 6 at the Culver Studios. During later seasons the taping was no longer performed before an audience due to the complexities of the fantasy sequences, costume changes, etc. On Mondays, the cast went through the script as a table read. On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they rehearsed before the series' producers and executives. And, on Thursdays and Fridays, the series was shot using a multi-camera set up in front of a live studio audience.\n\nNearly 100 crew members were involved in the shooting of a single episode. Although Drescher, Fraser, Jacobson and Sternin, the show's only executive producers for the first four seasons, coordinated \"pretty much everything\" at the beginning, according to Sternin, they eventually found their niche and in the following years, Drescher and Sternin decided to focus on writing story outlines along with Timothy Kavanagh of Montreal. Kavanagh, known mainly for his writing with Fraser, added a recognizable dry humor to the show. Jacobson presided over the writing team, and Fraser observed the run-throughs. The four of them were later joined by Frank Lombardi, Caryn Lucas and Diane Wilk, who served as the series' executive producer throughout the fifth and sixth season respectively.\n\nStemming from a home invasion and attack she experienced in 1985, Fran Drescher requested the show to provide prescreened audiences, based fear of having random strangers invited to the productions. The show hired Central Casting to gather a cast of \"laughers\" who would be recorded during taping. The audio track of the laughers would then be added to the episodes in post-production. Casting director Lisette St. Claire became the world’s first \"laugher wrangler\" for new type of service, which would continue to be used on other shows.\n\nThe comedy in \"The Nanny\" was formulated with many running gags, which contributed heavily to the success of the series. Much of this formula was character-based, with all major characters possessing a specific trait or quirks that provided a source of parody for other characters. The conflicting elements of each character's own comedy were often played off against one another (Fran and Maxwell, Niles and C.C., Maggie and Brighton). Occasionally the characters would break the fourth wall and comment on the situations themselves, or Fran would comment to the audience or look into the camera. Other running gags are the many references to Beatles songs and the musicals \"Fiddler on the Roof\" and \"My Fair Lady\". Most of the humor Fran uses is aimed toward a Jewish audience. She makes references to Yiddish words and teaches the Sheffield children to be stereotypical Jews (to never pay retail price, to go after men like doctors, etc.) Much of this humor is featured in scenes including her mother Sylvia.\n\nAt times, they would also make humorous references to the stars' previous careers or real life off-screen time. This was noticeable when Yetta saw her reflection in the mirror and thought she was seeing Millie Helper from \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" (the role that Guilbert played on that long-running show), Maxwell remembering how he wanted to hire a former cast member from \"Days of Our Lives\" but thought he wasn't \"British\" enough (a reference to Charles Shaughnessy's former series), C.C. using props to hide Lauren Lane's real-life pregnancy at the time, and Fran meeting her idol—Fran Drescher—who gave her a hint on what she (the TV Fran) was going to do in the next scene in the second-to-last episode in the last season. Drescher also appeared in the series as tough-talking music publicist Bobbi Fleckman, reprising her role from the 1984 film \"This Is Spinal Tap\", setting up an obvious visual gag where Drescher (as the Nanny) would disguise herself as Fleckman in order to get Mr. Sheffield's attention.\n\nMore running gags include Fran's frequent references to classic TV sitcoms (such as \"Gilligan's Island\" and \"Bewitched\") and her many eccentric family members (some never shown, most of them dying); Fran lying about her age—especially to men; Maxwell fighting through his rivalry with actual Broadway producer Andrew Lloyd Webber; Maxwell's physical resemblance to Pierce Brosnan; Maxwell's fondness of Kaye Ballard; Sylvia loving food in excess; Niles delivering sharp one-liners, often aimed at C.C.; C.C. cold-heartedly reacting to situations that are usually sentimental to others (e.g. the death of Bambi's mother); Gracie psychologically analyzing various situations; Niles getting fired because he embarrasses Maxwell or gives Fran ideas that Maxwell extremely dislikes (such as suggesting that Max, C.C. and Fran go to Barbra Streisand's house); Fran and Val lacking intelligence and obsessing over material possessions (e.g. clothes); frequent references to Fran's flamboyant wardrobe and her \"big hair\"; Fran frequently mentioning shopping at Loehmann's; Yetta making disconnected comments revealing her senility; Fran criticizing Maxwell's and Niles' reserved and inhibited British nature; Brighton morphing into a hopeless dork; Fran's attraction to Jewish males; Maxwell passing up the incredibly popular musical, \"Cats\", then becoming upset when such an idiotic idea became a success; Niles' last name never being revealed; C.C. covering her long-unrevealed name (finally given as Chastity Claire in the series finale); C.C. failing to remember the names of the Sheffield children (even convinced by Niles in one episode that there was a fourth child named Sydney; note: she didn't have trouble remembering in the early seasons); Sylvia constantly nagging Fran to get married; Fran finding solace in food when she's depressed; Fran's father, Morty, often featured in the series but never actually seen (until portrayed by Steve Lawrence in a few later episodes); Morty's only physical trait being the fact that he is bald, in which he is always comically losing his wig, and has several head mannequins to hold different wigs; Niles offering obvious hints to Maxwell and Fran about them realizing they should be together and hints from each other; C.C. pining over her unrequited romantic interest in Maxwell; C.C. developing a nervous tic and eventually ending up in a sanitarium; Fran obsessing with Barbra Streisand. There was also the occasional tryst between Niles and C.C., contrasting with their typical open disdain for each other, which was actually love. Season 4 featured a running gag where both Fran and Maxwell kept secret from the other household members \"The Thing\" (the fact that in the season 3 finale Maxwell tells Fran he loves her, but then in the Season 4 premiere he takes it back). It's also following \"The Thing\" that whenever Maxwell makes comments denying he has feelings for Fran, she is temporary \"paralyzed\" (she can't feel her arm, her entire left side shuts down, etc.).\n\nIn addition, there is also a great deal of physical comedy in \"The Nanny\" including exaggerated falls and chases. Drescher's facial expressions, when shocked or surprised, can also be seen as reminiscent of Lucille Ball's portrayals of Lucy Ricardo and Lucy Carmichael. The parallels were suggested in a few episodes, where an exasperated Mr. Sheffield refers to Fran as \"Mrs. Carmichael\", and asks in another: \"Mr. Mooney fire you from the bank again?\" Another Lucy reference (in which the family travels to Hollywood) is when he alludes to Fran and \"Ethel\" stealing John Wayne's footprints, and again when Maxwell says \"Miss Fine, you got' some 'splaining to do!\" like Ricky Ricardo often said to Lucy Ricardo. The episode that featured a visit from Elizabeth Taylor (who also appeared on \"Here's Lucy\" as a guest star) began with Maxwell and Niles trying to hide the visit from Fran (\"Boys, boys, boys. Now do you think my mother gave birth to a dummy 25 years ago?\") followed by her gripe \"You never introduce me to any of the stars that you know; I've got a good mind to take Little Ricky and... oh. Never mind.\" Also, there was a reference from the episode of \"I Love Lucy\" called \"Ricky has Labor Pains\" where Lucy and Ethel dress up like men and go to Ricky's daddy shower. In an episode of \"The Nanny\", Fran sees a man watching \"I Love Lucy\" on TV and as the theme song plays she gets a sneaky look on her face and gets the idea to gain entry into Mr. Sheffield's men's only club dressed as a man. Viewers for Quality Television called \"The Nanny\" \"the '90s version of \"I Love Lucy\". It was well written and entertaining.\"\n\nThe show performed poorly in its first year. When it was nearly canceled, Sagansky stepped in as its champion. According to Jacobson: \"At all those affiliate meetings, he used to say, 'Stick by \"The Nanny\"!' He knew it was something special.\" The sitcom was the first new show delivered to CBS for the 1993 season and the highest-tested pilot at the network in years. The series was also hugely successful internationally, especially in Australia, where it was one of the highest-rated programs during the mid-to-late 1990s.\n\nAlthough soon emerging as a favorite among the company, sponsors questioned whether the writers had ventured too far in terms of ethnicity and Drescher acted too obviously Jewish. The actress, however, declined to change Fran Fine into an Italian American: \"On TV, you have to work fast, and the most real, the most rooted in reality to me is Jewish. I wanted to do it closest to what I knew.\" By contrast, the producers came to the conclusion that to oppose her should be a family of British origin, so \"she wouldn't come across as Jewish so much as the American you were rooting for,\" Sternin explained. \"The idea was to make her the American girl who happens to be Jewish rather than the Jewish girl working for the WASPs.\"\n\nThe show began off-network syndication in September 1998, distributed by Columbia TriStar Television Distribution (now Sony Pictures Television Distribution) on various broadcast television networks in the U.S. The show had aired on Lifetime Television from 2000 until 2008. The show could also be seen on Nick at Nite from April 2009 to October 5, 2013, in the United States, but was pulled and its timeslot of 6AM-7AM was replaced with Hangin' With Mr. Cooper. It also appears on The Hallmark Channel in the Philippines, Super RTL and VOX in Germany, and Go! and TV1 in Australia. On February 8, 2010, Fran Drescher hosted a week-long marathon of \"The Nanny\", titled \"Valentine Schmalentine\", on Nick at Nite. The success of the stunt led to Fran hosting \"Falling for Fran\", a similar week-long Valentine's Day marathon in February 2011.\nOn August 2, 2010, \"The Nanny\" began airing on TV Land, commencing with a week-long marathon and remained on the channel until 2016.

Similarly, on April 30, 2018, Freeform (TV channel) began airing the series, showing 5-episode blocks in the early morning hours. Additionally, the show can be seen on local US television channels.\n\nOutside of North America, \"The Nanny\" is broadcast in various other countries and television networks, each with their own schedule for the series. In the United Kingdom, the entire series aired on the digital network Living. It is currently re-airing on newly launched channel TLC.\nIn France, the show was broadcast and rebroadcast the same multi-and was a huge success on the channel M6 then W9. The French title is \"Une nounou d'enfer\" (\"A Hell of a Nanny\"). The character of Fran Fine is very famous in France.\n\nOther countries where \"The Nanny\" airs include the following:\n\nIn June 2018 Dresher said, \"We’re talking about it. Peter and I are talking about it,\" Drescher told \"Entertainment Tonight\", referencing her ex-husband, Peter Marc Jacobson, who co-created the series with her. \"She would’ve maybe gotten involved in more things [that] Fran Drescher is involved with,\" the actress told \"Entertainment Tonight\". \"All kinds of things from environmental issues, to health, to civil liberties, that’s what I think Fran [Fine] would be doing now — opening her big Queens mouth for the greater good.\"\n\nSony Pictures Home Entertainment has released seasons 1, 2 and 3 of \"The Nanny\" on DVD in regions 1, 2 and 4. Season 3 was released on March 17, 2009, in Region 1, almost 3 years after the release of season 2.\n\nOn August 27, 2013, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the rights to various television series from the Sony Pictures library including \"The Nanny\". They subsequently re-released the first two seasons on DVD on August 5, 2014.\n\nOn January 12, 2015, it was announced that Shout! Factory had acquired the rights to the series; they subsequently released a complete series set on May 26, 2015.\n\nIn late 2015, Shout! began releasing individual season sets; the fourth season was released on September 22, 2015, followed by the fifth season on December 22, 2015. The sixth and final season was released on March 15, 2016.\n\n\"The Nanny\" was shown in more than eighty countries worldwide. In addition, several local versions of the show have been produced in other countries. These shows follow the original scripts very closely, but with minor alterations in order to adapt to their respective country's culture. The remake in Russia was so popular that some original American writers of the show were commissioned to write new scripts after all original episodes were remade.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.news.com.au/entertainment/television/nine-things-you-never-knew-about-the-nanny/news-story/31062cd6d3cff86af698b50a6a81178e"}
{"id": "52593329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52593329", "title": "WWE United Kingdom Championship", "text": "WWE United Kingdom Championship\n\nThe WWE United Kingdom Championship is a professional wrestling championship created and promoted by the American professional wrestling promotion WWE for their NXT UK brand. It is the brand's top championship. The current champion is Pete Dunne, who is in his first reign and is the longest reigning champion.\n\nUnveiled on December 15, 2016, the title was first awarded to Tyler Bate, who won the inaugural WWE United Kingdom Championship Tournament on January 15, 2017. The brand's show, also titled \"NXT UK\", had its first tapings in August 2018, which began airing on October 17, 2018 on the WWE Network. From its inception up until the debut of \"NXT UK\", the title was defended on the NXT brand, as well as at shows produced by independent wrestling promotions in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn a press conference at The O2 Arena on December 15, 2016, Triple H revealed that there would be a 16-man tournament to crown the inaugural WWE United Kingdom Champion. The tournament was held over a two-day period, January 14 and 15, 2017, and aired exclusively on the WWE Network. Tyler Bate won the inaugural tournament to become the first WWE United Kingdom Champion.\n\nFollowing the inaugural tournament in 2017, the title began being featured on WWE's NXT brand when Bate debuted during the January 28, 2017, tapings of \"NXT\" in San Antonio, Texas, which aired February 1. During the February 1 tapings at the brand's home base of Full Sail University in Winter Park, Florida, the title's very first defense took place, where Bate defeated Trent Seven (aired February 15).<ref name=\"2/1 NXT TV Review\"></ref> The title was defended for the first time outside of WWE when Bate retained the title against Mark Andrews on a show for the London-based promotion, Progress Wrestling; the show took place in Orlando, Florida on March 31 as part of WrestleMania Axxess. The first title change, as well as the first defense to air live, took place on May 20, 2017, at , where Pete Dunne defeated Bate to become champion. Although unsuccessful, Johnny Gargano was the first wrestler from outside of the United Kingdom division to challenge for the UK title on the November 18 taping of \"NXT\" (aired on November 22).\n\nWhen the championship was unveiled in December 2016, it was announced to be the top championship of a new WWE Network show, produced in the United Kingdom. However, it was not until mid-2018 when WWE formally established NXT UK as the brand for their United Kingdom division. The brand's show, also titled \"NXT UK\", had its first tapings in August, which began airing on October 17. On the premiere episode, Dunne retained the UK Championship against Noam Dar.\n\nAs with some other championship belts unveiled in 2016, the base design is similar to the WWE Championship, with notable differences. Instead of a large cut out of the WWE logo, the center plate is modeled after the United Kingdom's royal coat of arms, featuring a lion and a horse (instead of the traditional unicorn) on either side of the arms, while the center of the shield has been replaced with the WWE logo; atop the shield are the crown jewels. The banner atop the arms reads \"United Kingdom\" while the banner below reads \"Champion\". Like the WWE Championship belt and other belts introduced in 2016, the United Kingdom Championship belt features two side plates, both separated by gold divider bars, with removable round sections that can be replaced with the current champion's logo; the default plates feature the WWE logo on the globe. The plates are on a black leather strap.\n\nAs of 03, 2018, there have been two reigns. The inaugural champion was Tyler Bate, who won the inaugural tournament. Bate is also the youngest champion, winning the title at 19 years old, while the oldest champion is Pete Dunne, winning the title at 23. Dunne has the longest reign at + days, while Bate has the shortest at 125 days (126 days as recognized by WWE).\n\nThe current champion is Pete Dunne.
