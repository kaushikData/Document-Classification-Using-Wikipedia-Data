The title is a pun on Dylan Thomas's \"Adventures in the Skin Trade\".\n\nThe book is divided into three parts. \"Part One: Hollywood Realities\" is a collection of essays on various subjects ranging from movie stars and studio executives to his thoughts on how to begin and end a screenplay and how to write for a movie star.\n\n\"Part Two: Adventures\" has stories from 11 projects that Goldman has been involved with, from \"Charly\" and \"Masquerade\", to the Academy Award-winning \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" and \"All the President's Men\", to some projects that remained unrealised, such as a musical remake of \"Grand Hotel\".\n\nIn \"Part Three: Da Vinci\", Goldman shows the reader how he would go about adapting his own short story \"Da Vinci\" into a screenplay. The full text of \"Da Vinci\" and the subsequent screenplay that he wrote are included, followed by interviews with key movie industry figures, including director George Roy Hill, cinematographer Gordon Willis, and composer Dave Grusin.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Goldman did hours of interviews with John Brady for a book that became \"The Craft of the Screenwriter\" (1981). Some of Goldman's answers were edited into a magazine piece for \"Esquire\"; this was read by an editor at a publishing house who contacted him about writing a book on screenwriting. Goldman agreed and hired Brady to work on the book with him, getting Brady to interview him over several sessions. These conversations were taped and transcribed, which Goldman used as the basis for the book.\n\nThe book became a best seller and has since become recognized as an industry classic.

It was developed and published by Ubi Soft in conjunction with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and DC Comics.\n\nThe game is based on the television series \"The New Batman Adventures\", itself a successor to the widely acclaimed \"\". In the game, Batman finds himself entangled in a web of his villains' schemes while attempting to stop the Joker's plan to destroy Gotham City.\n\nBased on most of the game's character designs and appearances, \"Batman Vengeance\" would seem to take place after the conclusion of \"\", but before the start of \"The New Batman Adventures\". Plot points that support this include Mr. Freeze still posing as a threat (as his appearance in \"The New Batman Adventures\" episode \"Cold Comfort\" was the last time he was seen prior to \"Batman Beyond\"), as well as the fact that Batgirl is the Dark Knight's only active sidekick in the game.\n\nBatman by this point is well established as the guardian of Gotham City, with the game sharing the voice cast, production design, and continuity of the DC animated universe. During the course of the game, Batman is monitored and assisted by Batgirl in the Batcave.\n\nAfter saving the life of a woman named Mary Flynn from an apparent attempted murder at the hands of the Joker at Gotham Chemical, which resulted in the complex blowing up due to a ticking time bomb left next to a tied up Mary by the Joker, Batman investigates what possible interest his nemesis would have in the woman. He learns that Joker had abducted her son, Toby, and is holding him for a $5 million ransom and will kill both Mary and her son if she does not pay up soon, implying that Mary has high financial access. After Mary is abducted by Joker's gang for the second time, Batman traces her location, using a tracker he previously gave to her, to a partially demolished Gotham bridge, where he comes face-to-face with the Joker once more. As the Joker seems to throw Mary's son off the remains of the bridge, the Dark Knight saves the boy before it's revealed to be a dummy, and Mary reveals herself to be the Joker's companion Harley Quinn; Toby was never real and the abduction was merely a farce to lure Batman into a trap. Batman then engages the Joker and defeats him, but in the fray, the villain falls off the bridge and to his apparent death. After saving Harley from attempting suicide by jumping off the bridge, Batman lets a distraught Quinn go and monitors her activities, knowing that the Joker is most likely not dead and Harley could be his only opportunity to learn more of the Clown Prince of Crime's true plans, making her a more valuable asset on the outside than she would be incarcerated.\n\nAs Batman continues to keep tabs over Harley, he is alerted to a crisis at a pharmaceutical company, Gotham Industrial, which is under attack by Mr. Freeze, who is angrily searching the complex for a scientist named Isaac Evers, whom he believes sent him a promotional video for a drug developed by Evers, known as Promethium, for treating conditions on the cryogenically frozen. Freeze had apparently used the drug on himself and his wife, Nora, but to no avail, infuriating Freeze with the implication that Evers had sent him the tape to taunt him. After finding Evers, Freeze abducts him and escapes the complex in a helicopter. Batman gives chase in the Batwing and eventually rescues Evers, who explains his work and what Freeze was after, lying to Batman by telling him the source of his funding originates from a grant supplied by the Wayne foundation. Knowing this to be a lie, Batman tells Evers to go into hiding, and later returns to Gotham Industrial to learn more about the source of Issac's financial backing, eventually learning that the scientist had his funding pulled, due to Promethium being far too unstable, as it contains several flammable particles. Evers was able to successfully continue in his research after receiving funding from the Joker, with every rise in Evers' budget coinciding with a successful bank heist of Joker's doing, implying the villain had plans of his own for the drug. Freeze and his gang then attack the facility again to find Isaac, destroying most of Ever's lab in the process, but are eventually stopped by the Dark Knight, with Freeze encased in ice from his own freeze gun.\n\nMeanwhile, Batgirl traces the transmitter, previously given to Harley Quinn by Batman when he believed her to be Mary Flynn, and finds it on Gotham's mayor, Hamilton Hill, who is seen making a deal with a mysterious and large man in a trench coat. Batgirl tracks the man to a metro train, but is discovered and attacked as Batman races to assist. As Batman reaches Batgirl and her attacker, the man jumps off the train and tears away in a stolen car. Batman and Batgirl pursue their suspect in the Batmobile, and cause it to crash off a highway outside the city. Batman investigates the wreckage, but discovers the man got away and finds only an apple outside the wreckage.\n\nBack at the Batcave, Batgirl examines the apple found at the crash and discovers a live plant inside, coming to the conclusion that Poison Ivy had implanted such a creature inside the mayor and is blackmailing him for money and power. Batman's surveillance of Mayor Hill leads him back to Gotham Chemical, where he confronts the trench-coated thug, who is revealed to be a plant creature created by Poison Ivy, and knocks the creature into a vat of acid. It is revealed that, earlier during the night, an unseen individual had left Poison Ivy a mysterious substance that was previously manufactured at Gotham Chemical, prior to its destruction at Joker's hands. Upon further examination of the chemical, Ivy discovered unique particles that, when exposed to any type of plant life, transforms plants into truly sentient and vicious creatures. Using this to her advantage, Ivy manipulatively plants several of her upgraded plants inside powerful politicians and businessmen through apples and other foods, blackmailing them for money, power, and even environmental donations. Knowing the origin of the chemical, Ivy had her plants rebuild Gotham Chemical in an effort to produce more of the chemical and created an antidote to the condition the mayor and the others have to use as collateral to ensure that they follow through on their deals. Harley had placed the transmitter on Mayor Hill, when he was receiving some of the plant food that would temporarily keep the creature at bay, in an effort to alert Batman towards Ivy's activities and ultimately stop her from going too far in her schemes after she came to her for assistance with Gotham Chemical.\n\nAfter Batman defeats Poison Ivy by electrocuting all of her plants, obtaining the cure, and saving Mayor Hill and the victims of Ivy's schemes, he heads to Funnibones Warehouse, after witnessing Joker's men hijack a blimp from the Gotham Air Strip, to collect from Harley for letting her walk the night the Joker was apparently killed. She informs him that, with Joker gone, some of his men were still operating on their own and left with some of the villain's toys and the blueprints to the historic Gotham Gasworks. Upon arriving at the Gasworks, Batman discovers Joker's men sending the villain's flammable toys into the pipe network, which lead throughout the entire city, and opens the gates to the sprinkler system to flood the complex's pipes in order to stop the toys. After disarming the last of Joker's men, Batman finds a tied up Isaac Evers, the apparent mastermind behind the Gasworks plot, who claims he only wanted to burn down Gotham Industrial in order to collect on the insurance money, as he couldn't collect on the damage left by Freeze without revealing his financial backers, particularly the Joker. With the Harlequin of Hate having funded the research with filthy lucre, Evers would be arrested for criminal facilitation and conspiracy if he revealed his affiliation with the notorious criminal and resorted to hiring the Joker's men and using his equipment in order to throw the cops off his trail after burning down his business, but the gang eventually turned on him, tied him up, and embarked on their own agenda of sending the toys throughout the city. The Dark Knight takes Evers outside for the arriving Gotham Police to take him into custody, but is forced to go undercover after being framed for injuring Commissioner Gordon with a Batarang, which led to a SWAT chase around Gotham City.\n\nInjured and hunted by the police, Batman's investigations shift towards discovering who framed him and how everything that has occurred since the Joker's disappearance factor together. He ultimately heads back to Funnibones Warehouse, disguised, for more information, only to discover the knife that the Joker was holding the night he fell from the bridge, confirming the Joker is not dead. Batman realizes, that with the Joker's plans occurring over such a long period of time, his end goal was massive and threatens to destroy the entire city. The Harlequin of Hate finally resurfaces on the roof of the Gotham Gasworks with the stolen blimp and his gang, where he reveals that he was behind the entire crime wave that occurred after faking his death by subtly manipulating the other villains and using Isaac Evers' research, having worked with the scientist and funded all his experiments and operations through his ill-conceived fortune, to produce large quantities of the highly flammable Promethium. Weeks earlier, the Joker had arranged the fake kidnapping scheme to fake his own death in order to reside in the shadows and out of the police and Batman's scope, while he manipulated the other villains; he sent Mr. Freeze the promotional tape on Promethium to provoke him into attacking Isaac's lair so his men could convince Evers to hire their services in an insurance scam with the use of Gotham Gasworks, provided Poison Ivy with the plant enhancement chemical and used her schemes to rebuild Gotham Chemical to mass-produce his own signature Joker toxin in a quiet fashion without Batman noticing, and finally used Harley to relay false information to Batman to send him deeper into his plot at the Gasworks and ultimately frame him for attacking Commissioner Gordon.\n\nUsing Evers as a scapegoat for the Gasworks scheme, the Joker reveals that he manipulated Batman into opening up the pipes to the sprinkler system, which the Joker then plans to pump with his Joker toxin, mixed with Evers' altered drug to make it highly flammable, all over the city through a feed tube connected to the previously stolen blimp, now filled with the deadly compound, and burn the city to the ground, while its citizen choke to death on their own laughter. The villain's ultimate 'joke' is that Gotham would be completely destroyed, with the punchline being Batman had been unknowingly aiding due to the Joker's manipulation. The Clown Prince of Crime then prepares to escape in the blimp and watch Gotham from above become engulfed in flames and toxin, leaving groups of his men, armed with explosives and flamethrowers, to slow the hero down. Despite this, Batman manages to shut down the gas flow, defeat all of the Joker's thugs, and subdue Harley Quinn just in time to get on the Joker's blimp before it takes to the sky. Despite having stopped the flow of Promethium and Joker toxin into the sprinkler system, Joker plans to use the remaining compound stored in the blimp to destroy the city by setting the blimp on a collision course with the heart of Gotham, City Hall, to explosively release the compound into the air. After a brief fight with the Joker, Batman knocks the villain out, deteriorates the gas, and disables the auto-pilot after solving a mechanism created by the Ace of Knaves to protect the auto-pilot controls. Once he realizes all his plans have failed, the Clown Prince of Crime decides to play one last, twisted joke on Batman and jumps from the blimp to entice the Dark Knight to save him and have a final showdown, while plummeting down to Gotham. The Dark Knight manages to both defeat and save the Joker and destroys the blimp, finally taking his archenemy back to Arkham Asylum.\n\nCommissioner Gordon calls Batman to apologize for the earlier SWAT chase, as they found Harley's fingerprints on the Batarang that hit him. As Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, Harley and the Joker sit in Arkham Asylum, Batman looks out over the city as the Bat-Signal ignites on him.\n\n\"Vengeance\" took environmental and character designs from \"The New Batman Adventures\", and starred most of the main voice cast from both it and its predecessor, \"Batman: The Animated Series\". The cast includes Kevin Conroy as Batman, Mark Hamill as the Joker, Tara Strong as Batgirl, Diane Pershing as Poison Ivy, Michael Ansara as Mr. Freeze, Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. as Alfred Pennyworth, Arleen Sorkin as Harley Quinn, Bob Hastings as Commissioner Gordon, and the late Lloyd Bochner as Mayor Hill.\n\nBy the end of 2001, sales of \"Batman: Vengeance\" had surpassed 540,000 units. Its sales surpassed 670,000 copies by the end of March 2002.\n\n\"Batman Vengeance\" received average reviews from critics and fans alike. The game's praise mainly went towards the voice acting, story, and cinematic cutscenes. There was criticism for the first person mode, which limited player's abilities in-game. The PC version drew a lot of mixed or negative reviews due to complex and sometimes confusing controls.\n\nThe Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences nominated \"Batman: Vengeance\" for its 2001 \"Outstanding Achievement in Original Musical Composition\" award, which ultimately went to \"Tropico\".\n\n\n"}

Originally a slave, he assumed the name of Caecilius from his patron, probably one of the Metelli. He supported himself by adapting Greek plays for the Roman stage from the New Comedy writers, especially Menander, a genre called Comoedia Palliata. If the statement in the life of Terence by Suetonius is correct and the reading sound, Caecilius's judgment was so esteemed that he was ordered to hear Terence's \"Andria\" (exhibited 166 BC) read and to pronounce an opinion upon it.\n\nAfter several failures, Caecilius gained a high reputation. Volcatius Sedigitus, the dramatic critic, places him first amongst the comic poets; Varro credits him with pathos and skill in the construction of his plots; Horace (\"Epistles\", ii. I. 59) contrasts his dignity with the art of Terence. Quintilian (\"Inst. Orat.\", x. I. 99) speaks somewhat disparagingly of him, and Cicero, although he admits with some hesitation that Caecilius may have been the chief of the comic poets (\"De Optimo Genere Oratorum\", I), considers him inferior to Terence in style and Latinity (\"Ad Atticum\" vii. 3), as was only natural, considering his foreign extraction.\n\nThe fact that his plays could be referred to by name alone without any indication of the author (Cicero, \"De Finibus\", ii. 7) is sufficient proof of their widespread popularity. Caecilius holds a place between Plautus and Terence in his treatment of the Greek originals; he did not, like Plautus, confound things Greek and Roman, nor, like Terence, eliminate everything that could not be romanized.\n\nThe fragments of his plays are chiefly preserved in Aulus Gellius, who cites several passages from \"Plocium\" (\"The Necklace\") together with the original Greek of Menander, affording the only opportunity, apart from Plautus' \"Bacchides\", to make a substantial comparison between a Roman comedy and its Greek model. Caecilius' version, diffuse and by no means close as a translation, does not reproduce the spirit of the original.\n\nForty-two titles are known, about half based on Menander, and half on other Greek authors. Approximately 280 fragmentary verses survive. \"Plocium\" is the best preserved (45 verses). In addition to that, a large fragment of \"Obolostates\" was discovered not long ago among the \"papyri\" of Herculaneum; it is as yet unedited, but is estimated to contain fragments of 400-500 lines.

{"id": "6570962", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6570962", "title": "Chest voice", "text": "Chest voice\n\nChest voice is a term used within vocal music. The use of this term varies widely within vocal pedagogical circles and there is currently no one consistent opinion among vocal music professionals in regard to this term. Chest voice can be used in relation to the following:\n\nThe first recorded mention of the term chest voice was around the 13th century, when it was distinguished from the throat and the head voice (pectoris, guttoris, capitis—at this time it is likely head voice referred to the falsetto register) by the writers Johannes de Garlandia and Jerome of Moravia. The term was later redefined during the bel canto period when it was identified as the lowest of three vocal registers: the chest, passaggio and head registers. This approach is still taught by some vocal pedagogists today.\n\nHowever as knowledge of human physiology has increased over the past two hundred years, so has the understanding of the physical process of singing and vocal production. As a result, many vocal pedagogists have redefined or even abandoned the use of the term chest voice. In particular, the use of the term chest register has become controversial since vocal registration is more commonly seen today as a product of laryngeal function that is unrelated to the physiology of the chest and lungs. For this reason, many vocal pedagogists argue that it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the chest. The vibratory sensations which are felt in these areas are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to vocal resonance, not to registers. These vocal pedagogists prefer the term \"chest voice\" over the term \"chest register\". These vocal pedagogists also hold that many of the problems which people identify as register problems are really problems of resonance adjustment. This helps to explain the controversy over this terminology. Also, the term chest register is not used within speech pathology and is not one of the four main vocal registers identified by speech pathologists. For the purposes of this article, the term \"chest voice\" is adopted as it is less controversial.\n\nThe contemporary use of the term chest voice often refers to a specific kind of vocal coloration or vocal timbre. In classical singing, its use is limited entirely to the lower part of the modal register or normal voice. Chest timbre can add a wonderful array of sounds to a singer’s vocal interpretive palette. The introduction of chest timbre is common to singers trained in the historic Italian school, but largely shunned among singers who have emerged from the Nordic/Germanic tradition. Such approval or disapproval is largely an aesthetic decision.\nHowever, the use of overly strong chest voice in the higher registers in an attempt to hit higher notes in the chest can lead to forcing. Forcing can lead consequently to vocal deterioration.\n\nAs the opinions on what exactly chest voice is vary greatly, there is no one consensus on the physiological production of chest voice. However there is a developing body of scientific knowledge regarding the production of various definitions of chest voice:\n\nThis view understands chest voice as the vocal register used within normal speech. It was discovered via stroboscope that during ordinary phonation, or speaking in a man the vocal folds contact with each other completely during each vibration closing the gap between them fully, if just for a small length of time. This closure cuts off the escaping air. When the air pressure in the trachea rises as a result of this closure, the folds are blown apart, while the vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilages remain in apposition. This creates an oval shaped gap between the folds and some air escapes, lowering the pressure inside the trachea. Rhythmic repetition of this movement a certain number of times a second creates a pitched note. This is how the chest voice is created.\n\nThis view believes that the chest voice is a product not of vocal registration but vocal resonation. Opinions within this understanding vary. Although some pedagogists believe the chest is an effective resonator, most agree that chest voice actually resonates in the head while creating vibratory sensations in the chest. Tarneaud says, \n\"during singing, the vibration of the vocal folds impresses periodic shakes on the laryngeal cartilage which transmits them to the bones in the thorax via the laryngeal depressors, and to the bony structures in the head via the laryngeal elevators. Singers feel these shakes in the form of thoracic and facial vibrations\". \n\nThese internal phonatory sensations produced by laryngeal vibrations are called \"resonance\" by singers and teachers of singing.\n\nDuring singing in the lower register, the larynx is lowered since the muscles which connect it to the rib cage are tensed whereas the muscles above the larynx are not tensed. Consequently, a large proportion of the vibratory energy is transmitted to the thoracic area, giving singers the impression that their voice is resonating in the chest. This impression however is false. The chest by virtue of its design and location can make no significant contribution to the resonance system of the voice. The chest is on the wrong side of the vocal folds and there is nothing in the design of the lungs that could serve to reflect sound waves back toward the larynx.\n\n"}

He was also the father of actress Candice Bergen.\n\nBergen was born in Chicago, Illinois, one of five children and the youngest of two sons of Swedish immigrants Nilla Svensdotter (née Osberg) and Johan Henriksson Berggren. He lived on a farm near Decatur, Michigan until he was 4 when his family returned to Sweden where he learned the language. He taught himself ventriloquism from a pamphlet called \"The Wizard's Manual\" when he was 11 after his family returned to Chicago. He attended Lake View High School. After his father died when he was just 16, he went out to work as an apprentice accountant, a furnace stoke, a player piano operator, and a projectionist in a silent-movie house. The famous ventriloquist Harry Lester was so impressed by Edgar that he gave the teenager almost daily lessons for three months in the fundamentals of ventriloquism. In the fall of 1919, Edgar paid Chicago woodcarver Theodore Mack $36 to sculpt a likeness of a rascally red-headed Irish newspaperboy he knew. The head went on a dummy named Charlie McCarthy, which became Bergen's lifelong sidekick. He had created the body himself, using a nine-inch length of broomstick for the backbone, and rubber bands and cords to control the lower jaw mechanism of the mouth.\n\nFor college he attended Northwestern University where he was enrolled in the pre-med program to please his mother. He switched to Speech & Drama but never completed his degree. He gave his first public performance at Waveland Avenue Congregational Church located on the northeast corner of Waveland and Janssen. He lived across the street from the church. In 1965, he gave the church a generous contribution, a thoughtful letter, and a photograph of himself which had been requested by the minister and was displayed in the church's assembly room which was dedicated to Bergen. He cut out an \"R\" and a \"G\" from his family name and went from Berggren to Bergen on the showbills. Between June 1922 and August 1925, he performed every summer on the professional Chautauqua circuit and at the Lyceum theater in Chicago. Bergen had an interest in aviation, becoming a private pilot.\n\nHis first performances were in vaudeville, at which point he legally changed his last name to the easier-to-pronounce \"Bergen\". He worked in one-reel movie shorts, but his real success was on the radio. He and Charlie were seen at a New York party by Elsa Maxwell for Noël Coward, who recommended them for an engagement at the famous Rainbow Room. It was there that two producers saw Bergen and Charlie perform. They then recommended them for a guest appearance on Rudy Vallée's program.\n\nTheir initial appearance (December 17, 1936) was so successful that the following year they were given regular cast rolls as part of \"The Chase and Sanborn Hour\". Under various sponsors (and two different networks), they were on the air from May 9, 1937 to July 1, 1956. The popularity of a ventriloquist on radio, when one could see neither the dummies nor his skill, surprised and puzzled many critics, then and now. Even knowing that Bergen provided the voice, listeners perceived Charlie as a genuine person, but only through artwork rather than photos could the character be seen as truly lifelike. Thus, in 1947, Sam Berman caricatured Bergen and McCarthy for the network's glossy promotional book, \"NBC Parade of Stars: As Heard Over Your Favorite NBC Station\".\n\nBergen's skill as an entertainer, especially his characterization of Charlie, carried the show (many of which have survived). Bergen's success on radio was paralleled in the United Kingdom by Peter Brough and his dummy Archie Andrews (\"Educating Archie\").\n\nFor the radio program, Bergen developed other characters, notably the slow-witted Mortimer Snerd and the man-hungry Effie Klinker. The star remained Charlie, who was always presented as a highly precocious child (albeit in top hat, cape, and monocle)—a debonair, girl-crazy, child-about-town. As a child, and a wooden one at that, Charlie could get away with double entendres which were otherwise impossible under broadcast standards of the time.\n\nCharlie and Mae West had this conversation on December 12, 1937.\n\nCharlie's feud with W. C. Fields was a regular feature of the show.\n\nBergen was not the most technically skilled ventriloquist—Charlie McCarthy frequently twitted him for moving his lips—but Bergen's sense of comedic timing was superb, and he handled Charlie's snappy dialog with aplomb. Bergen's wit in creating McCarthy's striking personality and that of his other characters was the making of the show. Bergen's popularity as a ventriloquist on radio, where the trick of \"throwing his voice\" was not visible, suggests his appeal was primarily the personality he applied to his characters.\n\nBergen and McCarthy are sometimes credited with \"saving the world\" because, on the night of October 30, 1938, when Orson Welles performed his \"War of the Worlds\" radio play that panicked many listeners, most of the American public had instead tuned to Bergen and McCarthy on another station and never heard Welles' play. Conversely, it has also been theorized that Bergen inadvertently contributed to the hysteria. When the musical portion of Bergen's show, \"The Chase and Sanborn Hour\", aired approximately 12 minutes into the show, many listeners adjusted their dial and found the \"War of the Worlds\" presentation already underway with a realistic-sounding reporter detailing terrible events.\n\nRay Noble was the musical director and composer, and teenage singer Anita Gordon provided the songs on his show. Gordon was said to have been discovered by Charlie, who had a crush on her.\n\nIn the fall (autumn) of 1948, Edgar and Charlie faced serious competition from ABC's \"jackpot\" quiz show, \"Stop the Music\", which suddenly drew more listeners (Fred Allen faced a similar problem because he directly appeared before them). In December 1948, Edgar announced he was temporarily \"retiring\" from radio, admitting that \"Stop the Music\" was too popular to compete with. His final NBC broadcast was on December 26, 1948.\n\nIn October 1949, Bergen went to CBS, with a new weekly program, \"The Charlie McCarthy Show\", sponsored by Coca-Cola. After their sponsorship ended in June 1952, Richard Hudnut, on behalf of \"Lanolin Plus\" cosmetics, primarily sustained the series until the end of the 1953–54 season. In October 1954, Kraft Foods sponsored a new \"Edgar Bergen Hour\". After Kraft's departure, the series continued with participating sponsors as a 55-minute series in the fall of 1955. However, because more people were watching television on Sunday nights than listened to radio (and advertisers preferred to sponsor TV shows by then), the series finally ended on July 1, 1956.\n\nIn addition to his work as a ventriloquist, Bergen was also an actor and comic strip creator. He established the syndicated comic strip \"Mortimer & Charlie\", which ran in newspapers from July 1939 to May 1940, illustrated first by Ben Batsford and then by Carl Buettner. The comic strip's writer was uncredited, but some of the gags certainly were lifted from the hit radio show. Between 1947 and 1954 Harvey Eisenberg also drew a comic strip based on Charlie McCarthy, scripted by Bergen. \n\nBergen and his alter ego Charlie McCarthy were given top billing in several films, including the Technicolor extravaganza \"The Goldwyn Follies\" (1938), opposite the Ritz Brothers. That year they also appeared in \"You Can't Cheat an Honest Man\" with W. C. Fields. At the height of their popularity in 1937, Bergen was presented an Honorary Oscar (in the form of a wooden Oscar statuette,the only wooden Oscar given so far) for his creation of Charlie McCarthy. Bergen, along with Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd were also featured in the 1938 film \"Letter of Introduction\".\n\nAs an actor alone, Bergen portrayed the timid suitor of the sister Trina in \"I Remember Mama\" (1948), and appeared in \"Captain China\" (1949), \"The Hanged Man\" (1964) and \"Don't Make Waves\" (1967). Other film roles for the team include \"Look Who's Laughing\" (1941) and \"Here We Go Again\" (1942), both with Fibber McGee and Molly. Charlie McCarthy wore a US Army uniform in \"Stage Door Canteen\" (1943) with Mortimer Snerd. Bergen and McCarthy were also featured in Disney's \"Fun and Fancy Free\" (1947). He later cameoed in all-star films such as \"The Phynx\" (1970), \"Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood\" (1976), and \"The Muppet Movie\" (1979). In 1977, Bergen had made a guest appearance on a second-season episode of \"The Muppet Show\", the highly acclaimed television comedy/variety program produced by Jim Henson who considered Bergen a major inspiration. His daughter Candice had also guest-starred on the show during its first season. Bergen died shortly after filming his \"Muppet Movie\" scene, which was also his final public appearance, and was subsequently dedicated to him. In 2009 Bergen was featured in the comedy documentary \"I'm No Dummy\", directed by Bryan W. Simon.\n\nAlthough his regular series never made the transition to television, Bergen made numerous appearances on the medium during his career. His first appearance was with Charlie McCarthy on NBC's pioneering television variety show Hour Glass in November 1946. In a filmed Thanksgiving special, billed as his official TV debut, sponsored by Coca-Cola on CBS in 1950, the new character Podine Puffington was introduced; this saucy Southern belle was as tall as a real woman, in contrast to Bergen's other sit-on-the-knee sized characters. On Christmas Day that same year, Bergen and McCarthy appeared as guests on Walt Disney's first television show, \"One Hour in Wonderland\".\n\nIn 1954, Bergen was a co-host on a memorable TV musical special, \"\".\n\nOn December 26, 1954, Bergen appeared on What's My Line as a mystery guest. Bergen also hosted the television game show \"Do You Trust Your Wife?\" in 1956–1957, later succeeded, in a daytime edition, by Johnny Carson.\n\nHe appeared in the Christmas 1957 episode of NBC's \"The Gisele MacKenzie Show\". In 1958 Bergen appeared with his 12-year-old daughter Candice on an episode of \"You Bet Your Life\" starring Groucho Marx. In 1959, he appeared in the second episode titled \"Dossier\" of the NBC espionage series \"Five Fingers\" starring David Hedison. On May 21, 1959, he guest-starred with Charlie McCarthy on NBC's \"The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford\". Bergen continued to appear regularly on television during the 1960s and into the 1970s, appearing on The Tonight Show as late as 1977. He guest-starred as Charlie in the 1960 episode \"Moment of Fear\" of CBS's \"The DuPont Show with June Allyson\". He did a stint as one of the \"What's My Line?\" mystery guests on the popular Sunday night CBS series. His colleague Paul Winchell happened to be a panel member during that episode. Bergen appeared on the NBC interview program \"Here's Hollywood\".\n\nBergen appeared as Grandpa Zeb Walton in the original Waltons television movie, \"The Homecoming: A Christmas Story\" (1971). The role was played by Will Geer in the subsequent TV series. During the run of \"The Waltons\" — which took place throughout the 1930s and 1940s—the voices of Bergen and Charlie McCarthy were sporadically heard from the Waltons' radio, as family members regularly tuned in for that program.\n\nIn 1941, Bergen met 19-year-old Frances Westerman, who had graduated from Los Angeles High School the year before, in the audience of Bergen's radio program as the guest of a member of his staff. Sitting in the front row, the young fashion model's legs caught 38-year-old Bergen's attention and he asked to meet her. The two were married in Mexico after years of long-distance courtship, on June 28, 1945. On May 9, 1946 Frances gave birth to future actress Candice Bergen, whose first performances were on Bergen's radio show. Their second child was film and television editor Kris Bergen. Frances also acted, appearing in several movies, co-starring in the 1958 television series \"Yancy Derringer\", and guest-starring in numerous other shows.\n\nIn mid-September 1978 he announced that he was retiring after over 50 years in show business and sending his monocled, top-hatted partner, Charlie McCarthy, to the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.. He opened at Caesar's Palace Hotel Las Vegas on September 27, for a two-week \"Farewell to show business\" engagement. He died three days later on September 30, 1978.\n\nBergen was interred with his parents (who are buried under their true surname of \"Berggren\"), in Inglewood Park Cemetery, Inglewood, California. Edgar Bergen's wife of 33 years, Frances Westerman Bergen, died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, on October 2, 2006, aged 84, from undisclosed causes. She is also buried in Inglewood Cemetery. In 1990, Bergen was elected to the Radio Hall of Fame, the same year that \"The Charlie McCarthy Show\" was selected as an honored program. A message in the closing credits dedicates \"The Muppet Movie\" (which featured Edgar and Charlie in their last screen appearance) to the memory and magic of Edgar. In 1991, the United States Postal Service honored him with a 29-cent commemorative stamp.\n\nBergen was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with three stars in 1960, for his contributions to television, motion pictures, and radio. The stars are located at 6425, 6766, and 6801 Hollywood Boulevard, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is similar to the \"Metroid\" and \"Castlevania\" series.\n\nA boy named Huma awakens inside a vast castle, and must find the missing elemental spirits inside its depths to restore the world's corrupted denizens back to their normal selves.\n\nThe player controls Huna as he explores the side-scrolling castle labyrinth, using the virtual controls on the touchpad. At the beginning of the game, Huna can run, jump, and bash enemies with his staff, but as he discovers the elemental spirits hidden throughout the castle, he will gain more abilities, e.g., double-jumping. After acquiring such techniques, the player will have to backtrack to previous areas to access new routes leading deeper into the castle. Enemies will sometimes drop weapon upgrades, but these are temporary, and the weapon will downgrade back to normal when the player takes damage.\n\n\"Elemental Rage\" received mixed reviews, currently sitting at 69/100 on Metacritic. TouchArcade gave it 4 stars out of 5, calling it \"one of the best experiences you can have if you enjoy a good action-platforming game\", though criticizing its short length and excessive hand-holding of the player. \"Slide to Play\" scored the game 7.5/10 and said it was a \"well polished adventure game that has taken inspiration from the metroidvania genre\", specifically praising the \"impressive soundtrack, something we don’t often see in iDevice games\" written by Argentinian Composer Christian Fernando Perucchi, but expressed reservations about the game's technical performance and its frustrating combat system, writing, \"[i]t takes too long to upgrade the weapon [after being downgraded], and it is far too easy to lose it again.\" \"Pocket Gamer\" awarded the game 7/10, remarking that \"Combat, platforming, and exploration meld to form a diverse style of gameplay not unique to \"Elemental Rage\", but undeniably enjoyable\"; however, it criticized numerous aspects of the game, saying \"the characters are annoying cliches\", \"[t]here are too many blind falls that lead to death\", \"what few [boss battles] there are unpolished\", and \"[f]ighting enemies is frequently awkward due to the prevalence of flying creatures and rigid controls.\" \"GamePro\" gave \"Elemental Rage\" a score of 2.5/5, and wrote, \"aside from a boring narrative and some excessive backtracking, the cute art aesthetic and challenging platforming make this a satisfactory experience.\"\n\n"}

It stars Jenna Dewan, Ashley Benson, and Tatum O'Neal, and was directed by Tom McLoughlin. The film premiered on August 2, 2008. It is based on real-life events that occurred at McKinney North High School in McKinney, Texas, in 2006, five teenage cheerleaders became notorious for truancies, violations of the school dress code, and general disrespect to the school community.\n\nIn 2005, Michaela Ward was hired to teach geography and coach the cheerleading squad at McKinney North High School. She discovered that five cheerleaders, nicknamed the \"Fab Five\", had been disruptive in school and off-campus. They are the five high school mean girls who rules this school with an iron fist. They broke rules, were truant, and causing disturbances during classes. They also caused trouble during off-campus activities, posting photographs of themselves partying, drinking alcohol, and visiting an adult store on Myspace. Ward was unable to deal with the Fab Five and the school administrators who did not punish them; she resigned in October 2006, despite her close relationships with her students. Ward contacted media to tell them about the Fab Five's unruly behavior and the school's handling of them. Ward told Lifetime Television about the story; the company produced a film based on Ward's story.\n\nFive high school cheerleaders dubbed the \"Fab Five\"—Brooke Tippit (Ashley Benson) who is co-captain of the squad, Jeri Blackburn (Jessica Heap), Lisa Toledo (Aimee Spring Fortier), Ashley (Stephanie Honoré), and Tabitha Doering (Ashlynn Ross) run amok and who are the mean girls of the school. Teachers, parents, and administrators fail to punish them for their unruly behavior, which includes repeatedly getting their coaches fired after disagreements or driving them to quit. These girls disregard school rules, drink alcohol, bully other students, and post suggestive pictures on the internet. After a new cheerleading coach Emma Carr (Jenna Dewan) arrives, the girls initially rebel against her but later become cooperative. Brooke becomes furious with Coach Carr when she assigns Meagan Harper, the most respected member of the squad, as co-captain because up until then, she had been the only captain. The Fab Five perform well at a pep rally, but after Ashley is kissed by Jeri’s boyfriend, the other girls eject her from the group and later become the \"Fab Four,\" although Ashley remains part of the squad. Carr tries to discipline the girls, which results in a change in attitude. The girls start bullying other pupils, including Cindy, Meagan's younger sister, and are suspended from the team. The Fab Four get drunk and are caught trying to leave the campus by a guard and the principal. \n\nThe girls tell the school's superintendent they were tired after a test and wanted to sleep. The security guard then tells Carr about the incident, and she confronts the principal and superintendent, who give excuses for not punishing the girls. Carr insists the principal punishes them, so the principal threatens to dissolve the team. Defiant, Carr punishes the whole squad by continually canceling practices and kicking Jeri off the squad. At next practice session, Carr hands each of the girls an eraser for a \"fresh\" start, but only Tabitha accepts. As revenge for Jeri's ejection, the girls show the superintendent a picture of Carr hugging another teacher at the school and say the two have been having an affair. At the discipline meeting for Jeri, Carr is repeatedly accused of flirting and not formally punishing the girls.\n\nAt the next practice session, the \"Fab Four\" struggle to perform the liberty stunt, but Carr inspires them to learn it. Carr finds Lisa has cheated on a test. After penalizing her, Lisa yells at Carr and storms out. Lisa then tells her father that Carr was bullying her. Carr then accidentally resigns and sends an email to the cheerleaders apologizing for it. She visits the school and is fired by the principal. The girls confront Carr as she prepares to leave the school. She hears about a reporter who is researching \"cheerleaders gone wild\" and gives an interview about the ongoing events at Jackson High School. The school investigates, and the \"Fab Four\" enjoy the attention and lie to the reporter about their treatment. Carr discovers the reporter's true agenda, tells him what happened, leaves angrily, and bumps into Brooke. Carr simply asks her if she thinks the University of Southern California will accept her as a student after all the negative publicity of what has happened.\n\nThe investigator reports that the allegations against the \"Fab Four\" and administrators are true and that Carr is innocent. He blames the principal for the problem and Carr losing her job. Lorraine and the assistant principal are suspended from their jobs. Brooke is pulled from the school by her mother, and the rest of the \"Fab Four\" are no longer allowed to cheer. Brooke and her mother leave followed by cameras, Brooke waves, and Carr is despondent. However, Carr doesn't get her job back from the school. Four months later, Carr watches the girls at a cheer competition and is welcomed with praise and hugs, including Ashley, who she exchanges smiles with. The new cheerleaders compete, and Carr discovers Cindy had written an essay about her, discussing how she stood up to the administration and stopped Brooke and the Fab Three from terrorizing their school, revealing that Carr did change things after all. The girls compete and perform the stunt they struggled with earlier, leaving Carr feeling proud and worthy.\n\nThe television movie aired on Saturday, August 2, 2008, and scored a 2.63 household rating (3,041,547 viewers). It scored a 2.63 rating (280,405 viewers) among females aged 12–17 and a 2.17 rating (1,219,726 viewers) among females aged 18–49. Linda Stasi of the \"New York Post\" gave the movie three stars out of four.\n\n\"Newsweek\" said the real-life events that inspired the film were \"grimmer\" than the television movie; the real-life principal and the vice-principal of the school lost their jobs. Girls from the Myspace photographs (the \"Fab Five\") became victims of stalkers and \"haunted by their reputations [from high school]\". Discipline at McKinney North High School became stricter than before. \"Newsweek\" said the film was close to the real-life events, the portrayal of Jenna Dewan's character was \"brave but naïve\", and the story was \"an entertaining morality tale\" yet \"preachy\".\n\nSteve Thompson of \"Yahoo! Voices\" praised this movie for addressing important messages to viewers about consequential actions, especially by schools and cheerleaders. Thompson called the portrayal of cheerleaders \"purely evil\" and vindictive, and that some scenes were inspired by other real \"mean girls\" events, such as the beating of a 16-year-old girl in Lakeland, Florida, rather than the McKinney incidents.\n\nAfter the story broke, Michaela Ward faced unemployment and \"became ostracized\", especially after her lawsuits. In 2008 she filed an unsuccessful lawsuit to get her job back. According to KGNS-TV, Ward coaches cheerleading in McKinney, Texas, and had privately coached a former pupil. In December 2009, former principal Linda Theret was hired by the Laredo Independent School District as Executive Director of Curriculum.\n\n"}
{"id": "57550167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57550167", "title": "Fallout 76", "text": "Fallout 76\n\nFallout 76 is an online action role-playing game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks, part of the \"Fallout\" series. Released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on November 14, 2018, it is a prequel to previous series games. \"Fallout 76\" is Bethesda Game Studios's first multiplayer game; players explore the open world, which has been torn apart by nuclear war, with others.\n\nBethesda developed the game using a modified version of its Creation Engine, which allowed the accommodation of multiplayer gameplay and a more detailed game world. \"Fallout 76\" was released to generally mixed reviews, with many criticizing the game's numerous technical issues, overall design, lack of gameplay purpose, and absence of human non-playable characters.\n\n\"Fallout 76\" is Bethesda Game Studios' first online multiplayer game. Players may play individually or with a party of up to three others. The servers for the game are dedicated, with the player automatically allocated to one of them. While the game was expected to launch with public servers only, game director Todd Howard revealed plans for private servers to be introduced some time after the game's launch. These private servers allow players to invite friends to play in order to prevent undesirable aspects of player versus player gameplay such as griefing from affecting an individual player's experience of the game. Howard described the delay as being necessary to allow Bethesda time to assure the stability of public servers. Elements of previous \"Fallout\" games are present and are modified to work with the real-time game. The V.A.T.S. system—a mechanic first introduced in \"Fallout 3\" that allows players to pause the game to target specific locations on an enemy's body to attack—is used in \"Fallout 76\" as a real-time system, though it still allow players to specify targets on an enemy's body.\n\nThe game features an open world four times the size of that of \"Fallout 4\". The game world is called \"Appalachia\" and is a representation of West Virginia. It features recreations of real locations in the region, including the West Virginia State Capitol, The Greenbrier, Woodburn Circle, New River Gorge Bridge, and Camden Park. The game features numerous new mutated monsters, several of which—such as the Mothman and the Flatwoods monster—were inspired by West Virginian folklore.\n\nThe game includes revisions to the SPECIAL progression system. Character attributes fall into one of seven categories: strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck. As the player levels up, they are able to spend skill points to boost their attributes on a scale of one to fifteen. Players are able to choose perks, or passive abilities that offer gameplay bonuses. These perks fall into each of the SPECIAL categories and take the form of trading cards. Each card has a value and the player can adopt perks equal to their respective value; for example, if the player has a strength rating of five, then they may equip strength perks worth five points. The player can merge similar cards together to create more powerful—albeit more expensive—perks. The system is designed to encourage the player to recognise the situation they are in and choose perks that aid them rather than passively selecting them and having them for the duration of the game.\n\n\"Fallout 76\" does not feature any human non-player characters (NPCs) as all surviving humans are other players. This required Bethesda to change their approach to storytelling as previous games in the series relied on NPCs to assign quests, engage the player in dialog and advance the overall narrative. \"Fallout 76\" instead uses a combination of NPCs in the form of robots, recordings such as collectible holotapes, terminals throughout the game world, and environmental storytelling where the player uncovers fragments of a narrative by exploring locations that they piece together themselves. Each of these elements had previously been used in the series, often to provide backstory for characters and the world of the game whilst remaining separate from the main narrative. According to Howard, this system allows Bethesda to tell a story whilst giving players a greater ability to create their own narratives.\n\nThe game expands on \"Fallout 4\"s settlements by allowing the player the ability to build bases at many locations of the map. These creations are assigned to the player's profile and are removed from the game world when the player is offline to prevent progress from being lost. While other players are able to attack player settlements while they are online, the game preserves player creations in some form to prevent players from having to start over if their creations and progress are destroyed.\n\nPlayers are able to use nuclear weapons to temporarily change the areas of game world. After acquiring launch codes, the player can access missile silos and fire a missile at almost any point on the map. This irradiates the area, which the player can explore to find rare weapons, gear and items. However, it also attracts powerful enemies and the player needs to be sufficiently strong to survive. The game also includes a photo mode. The player has the ability to pose their character and choose from a variety of facial expressions and filters.\n\n\"Fallout 76\" is a narrative prequel to previous \"Fallout\" games. It is set in an alternate history, and takes place in 2102, twenty-five years after a nuclear war that devastated the Earth. The player character is a resident of Vault 76, a fallout shelter that was built in West Virginia to house America's best and brightest minds. The player character exits the Vault on \"Reclamation Day\" as part of a plan to re-colonize the Wasteland.\n\n\"Fallout 76\" uses a modified version of Bethesda's Creation Engine designed to accommodate multiplayer gameplay. Work on modifying the engine was carried out by Bethesda Game Studios Austin. The modified engine also allowed the development team to incorporate new lighting models, rendering processes and more accurate terrain mapping. These allowed the development team to create a world with sixteen times more detail than was possible with previous iterations of the Creation Engine. The game also includes a dynamic weather system that allows for localized climatic conditions and greater draw distances mean that these weather events can be observed by the player from far away. As with many previous games in the series, its musical score was composed by Inon Zur.\n\nThe game was announced on May 30, 2018; the announcement was preceded by a twenty-four hour live stream on Twitch showing a Vault Boy bobblehead toy in front of a monitor with a \"Please Stand By\" test pattern screen, a signature image of the series. This stream was watched by a total of over two million people, with more than one hundred thousand people watching at any time.\n\nDetails of the game were announced by Howard during Bethesda's press conference at the Electronic Entertainment Expo on June 10, 2018, including its anticipated release date of November 14, 2018. As it is Bethesda Game Studio's first experience with a fully online game, Howard confirmed that there would be an open beta phase, beginning on October 23, 2018 for Xbox One, and October 30, 2018 for PlayStation 4 and PC.\n\nIn response to the announcement that \"Fallout 76\" would feature only multiplayer, a petition was created by fans of the series which called for the game to include a single-player mode. The petition received thousands of signatures within a day. Following the game's announcement, there was a burst of interest in tourism in West Virginia. The website \"West Virginia Explorer\" reported an increase of fifteen times the visitors to the site in the days after the announcement, while management of the Camden Park amusement park said there was an increase in people looking to purchase park merchandise.\n\nThe teaser trailer shown at E3 2018 featured a cover version of John Denver's song \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\". Fans of the series expressed interest in the song, prompting Bethesda to announce plans to release the song on digital musical services, with all proceeds from it being donated to Habitat for Humanity, assuring a minimum donation.\n\nAccording to review aggregator Metacritic, the PC and PlayStation 4 versions received \"mixed or average\" reviews, while the Xbox One version received \"generally unfavorable\" reviews. The numerous negative reviews from critics led \"Forbes\" to describe the release of \"Fallout 76\" as a \"historically bad launch\" and to question if Bethesda would consider the property \"worth saving\" moving forward.\n\n\"The Guardian\" called the game \"a pointless walk in the post-apocalypse\" featuring \"half-baked conflict and witless quests to unearth the dead\". According to \"Forbes\", \"Fallout 76\" was a \"huge, rare, total miss\" by Bethesda. \"Eurogamer\" described the game as a \"bizarre, boring, broken mess\", adding that, shortly after its launch, it should be considered as a \"failed experiment\".\n\n\"Business Insider\" described \"Fallout 76\" as \"a jumble of disparate video game elements set loose in an online world, held together by a string of pointless fetch quests and experience points\". \"Newsweek\" said that moments of the enjoyment during their review were \"outweighed by the near-constant performance issues and poorly executed game systems\", adding that they were disappointed at the game despite being a fan of the series.\n\n\"PCWorld\" ended their review early due to their frustration with the game's technical performance, and said that it still would not be a great game to them even if it \"functioned properly\". \"Metro\" wrote that \"Fallout 76\" may be the \"most badly made video game\" they had ever seen from a major publisher. They further described the game as \"a disastrous failure\" whose technical shortcomings may one day be fixed, but whose \"design failings and obliviousness to its own potential\" suggested that it was \"irrevocably broken\". \"GameSpot\" said that the game \"can look and feel like its illustrious predecessors at times, but it's a soulless husk of an experience.\" According to IGN, \"The rich wasteland map of \"Fallout 76\" is wasted on a mess of bugs, conflicting ideas, and monotony.\" \"Giant Bomb\" has said they will not publish a full review due to disinterest of the staff to play it enough to reach a final verdict. Editor and co-founder Jeff Gerstmann stated on their podcast \"No one on staff wants to play anymore of this video game.\"\n\nThe game was also criticized for the complete absence of interactive human NPCs. \"GameSpot\" said that \"without having any of those people present to tell their stories personally, [\"Fallout 76\"]'s world is limited to being little more than just an environmental exhibit with things to kill\", and that \"there are no strong emotional anchors to help you become truly invested...\". They also wrote that quests simply exist of \"long monologues and one-way directives from a person who no longer exists and you can't interact with ... your actions ultimately won't affect anyone, or the rest of the world for that matter\". PC World similarly took issue, writing \"robots aren't really NPCs as much as quest dispensers ... they don't talk with you, they talk at you\". Additionally, they disliked the readable terminals and holotapes: \"none of it feels important or even particularly interesting\" as they were \"no substitute for an actual conversation\".\n\nFurther controversy surrounding \"Fallout 76\" arose upon the release of the game's Power Armor special edition. Bethesda advertised that the edition would include a canvas duffel bag, but a nylon one was included instead. Responding to customer complaints, Bethesda revealed that the bag had to be changed due to unavailability of materials. The publisher received criticism for not making the change known beforehand, with \"Eurogamer\" pointing out that the bag's description on Bethesda's website had only changed to read \"nylon\" after complaints had been submitted. Bethesda later offered affected customers free in-game currency as compensation, equating to $5.00. Additionally, it has been discovered that Bethesda had given a different canvas bag to online influencers, further adding fan outrage.\n\nUpon launch, \"Fallout 76\" debuted at third place in the UK's all-format sales charts, behind \"Spyro Reignited Trilogy\" and \"Red Dead Redemption 2\". The game saw a price drop in North America less than one week after its initial release, with some pundits listing poor sales as a reason for the cut in price.\n"}

The product was a radio drama version of Jackson's popular \"Fighting Fantasy\" novels, and the outcome of the story could be affected by choices the user made, using a touch-tone telephone. A free starter pack could be ordered by sending a self-addressed stamped envelope to the game creators.\n\nTwo scenarios were produced for the \"F.I.S.T.\" game. The first of these was released under the title \"F.I.S.T. 1 – Castle Mammon: Lair of the Demon Prince\" in September 1988, and the second was a direct sequel titled \"F.I.S.T. 2 – The Rings of Allion\" in March 1989.\n\nPlayers could register over the phone and create a character, which would be saved and restored the next time the player called. Both games were dungeon crawls, depicting the player's unnamed character progressing through the titular Castle Mammon in an attempt to slay the Demon Prince Kaddis Ra. The games featured sound effects and voice-overs illustrating the adventures of the character. Combat consisted of the player being read a description of what their opponent was doing, and pushing a key combination to take action or cast a spell in response. The game could be saved and quit at any time by pushing 9, and the last message could be repeated by pushing 0. Although a solo-game, players could hear the high scores of other players, and physical gold coins were awarded monthly to the highest scoring players.\n\nThe sketch comedy \"Limmy's Show!\" features a \"F.I.S.T.\"-esque parody called \"Adventure Call\", using the same formula with fantasy scenarios hosted by a costumed narrator, \"Falconhoof\" (played by Brian Limond).\n"}

It's about creating a social cinema experience where the audience can connect with each other online and at the event.\"\n\nIt has been suggested that the popularity of alternative cinema experiences in general is due to the banality of the multiplex cinema experience.\n\nFuture Cinema as an umbrella brand comprises several subsidiary brands that deliver live, immersive cinema experiences worldwide.

Co-founded by UCLA film graduates and film industry veterans John J. B. Wilson and Mo Murphy, the annual Razzie Awards ceremony in Los Angeles precedes the corresponding Academy Awards ceremony by one day. The term \"raspberry\" in the name is used in its irreverent sense, as in \"blowing a raspberry\". The awards themselves are in the form of a \"golf ball-sized raspberry\" atop a Super 8 mm film reel, all spray painted gold.\n\nThe first Golden Raspberry Awards ceremony was held on March 31, 1981, at John J. B. Wilson's living-room alcove in Los Angeles, to honor the worst in film of the 1980 film season. The 38th ceremony was held on March 3, 2018.\n\nAmerican publicist John J. B. Wilson traditionally held potluck parties at his house in Los Angeles on the night of the Academy Awards. In 1981, after the 53rd Academy Awards had completed for the evening, Wilson invited friends to give random award presentations in his living room. Wilson decided to formalize the event, after watching a double feature of \"Can't Stop the Music\" and \"Xanadu\". He gave them ballots to vote on worst in film. Wilson stood at a podium made of cardboard in a tacky tuxedo, with a foam ball attached to a broomstick as a fake microphone, and announced \"Can't Stop the Music\" as the first Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture. The impromptu ceremony was a success and the following week a press release about his event released by Wilson was picked up by a few local newspapers, including a mention in the \"Los Angeles Daily News\" with the headline: \"Take These Envelopes, Please\".\n\nApproximately three dozen people came to the 1st Golden Raspberry Awards. The 2nd Golden Raspberry Awards had double the attendance as the first, and the 3rd awards ceremony \nin turn, had double this number. By the 4th Golden Raspberry Awards ceremony, CNN and two major wire services covered the event. Wilson realized that by scheduling the Golden Raspberry Awards before the Academy Awards, the ceremony would get more press coverage: \"We finally figured out you couldn't compete with the Oscars on Oscar night, but if you went the night before, when the press from all over the world are here and they are looking for something to do, it could well catch on,\" he said to BBC News.\n\nThe term \"raspberry\" is used in its irreverent sense, as in \"blowing a raspberry\". Wilson commented to the author of \"Blame It on the Dog\": \"When I registered the term with the Library of Congress in 1980, they asked me, 'Why \"raspberry\"? What's the significance of that?' But since then, \"razz\" has pretty much permeated the culture. We couldn't have done it without Hollywood's help.\" Wilson is referred to as \"Ye Olde Head Razzberry\".\n\nPaying members of the Golden Raspberry Award Foundation vote to determine the recipients. For the 29th Golden Raspberry Awards in 2009, award results were based on votes from approximately 650 journalists, cinema fans and professionals from the film industry. Voters hailed from 45 states in the United States and 19 other countries.\n\nThe ceremony, typically held one day before the Academy Awards, is modeled after the latter but \"deliberately low-end and tacky\".\n\nMost winners do not attend the ceremony to collect their awards. Notable exceptions include Tom Green (Worst Actor/Worst Director), Halle Berry and Sandra Bullock (Worst Actress), Michael Ferris, J. D. Shapiro (Worst Screenplay), and Paul Verhoeven (Worst Director).\n\nThree people won both the Razzies and Oscars the same weekend: Alan Menken in 1993, Brian Helgeland in 1998, and Sandra Bullock in 2010, although all three for different films. Two actors had performances in the same movie scoring Oscar and Razzie nominations, James Coco (\"Only When I Laugh\") and Amy Irving (\"Yentl\"). Neil Diamond, winner of the inaugural Worst Actor Razzie for 1980s \"The Jazz Singer\", was nominated for the Golden Globe in the same role. The Aerosmith song \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\", as part of the original soundtrack to the 1998 film \"Armageddon\", was nominated for both an Academy Award for Best Original Song and a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song, as was the Trisha Yearwood song \"How Do I Live\" from the 1997 film \"Con Air\" and the Tony Bennett song \"Life in a Looking Glass\" from the 1986 film \"That's Life!\". In 1981, Stanley Kubrick was nominated both for a Razzie Award as Worst Director at the 1st Golden Raspberry Awards as well as for a Saturn Award for Best Director at the 8th Saturn Awards for the same film: \"\"The Shining\". In 2017, Darren Aronofsky was nominated for both the Golden Lion and the Worst Director Razzie for \"Mother!\".\n\n\"Wall Street\" (1987) is the only film to date to win both an Oscar and a Razzie. Michael Douglas won the Academy Award for Best Actor, however Daryl Hannah's performance was not as well received and earned her a Razzie for Worst Supporting Actress.\n\nCurrent Awards\n\nRetired\n\nSpecial categories have also been introduced for specific years. Such special awards include:\n\nEvery decade-closing ceremony includes an award for the worst actors and movies of the decade—though the 2000 ceremony put the actors as worst of the 20th century instead. Special prizes for the 25th anniversary of the Razzies awards were also given out in 2005.\n\nThis award has been given five times, to Ronald Reagan in 1981, to Linda Blair in 1983, to Irwin Allen in 1985, to \"Bruce the Rubber Shark\" from \"Jaws\" in 1987, and to director Uwe Boll in 2009 who received this for his achievement as \"Germany's answer to Ed Wood\".\n\nThis is a special award given by Razzie Award Governor John J. B. Wilson to an individual whose achievements are not covered by the Razzies' other categories. It was awarded in 2003 to Travis Payne for \"Distinguished Under-Achievement in Choreography\" in the film \"From Justin to Kelly\".\n\nThis award is given to a critical and financial failure that would've been nominated if it had received an eligible release. It was awarded in 2016 to \"United Passions,\" to \"Misconduct\" in 2017, and in 2018 to \"CHiPs\".\n\nThe Razzies have received criticism, including from news sources such as \"Indiewire\" and \"The Daily Telegraph\", for several issues, including that members of the Golden Raspberry Foundation are not required to watch the nominated movies, and that seemingly anyone can join the Golden Raspberry Foundation, so long as they pay at least $40, which is different from the invitation-only Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Critics take issue with the Razzies picking \"easy targets\" and mainstream films instead of those perceived as less popular but more deserving productions, continuing to appeal to celebrities, seemingly for publicity and attention, over other, worthier films and performances.\n\nSam Adams of \"Indiewire\" has said the Razzies are \"like hecklers hurling insults at comedians or a concertgoer yelling out 'Whoo!' during a quiet song, they're not-so-secretly crying out to be noticed. The Razzies, properly enough, avoid pouncing on the little guy; they don't trash no-budget indies no one has seen for having bad lighting or terrible sound\". Robbie Collin of \"The Daily Telegraph\" has said \"the Razzies' ongoing failure to train its sights on anything but the most obvious targets means it grows more tired and redundant by the year\". CraveOnline's William Bibbiani stated that the Razzies follow \"a cheap shot of pranksterism\", and \"with only a handful of exceptions, only seen fit to nominate the most infamous movies of the year, and not necessarily the worst.\" Carolyn Burke of Cracked.com describes the awards as \"a ramshackle operation run by a bunch of lazy trolls who are guilty of all the same smug self-importance they claim to be lampooning\" and further states that \"the Razzies are an antiquated 'joke' that has long outlived any goodwill or relevance they once had, and have become nothing more than a mean-spirited cesspool of joyless criticism worse than any of the movies they tear down with artless comedy.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "56571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56571", "title": "Guignol", "text": "Guignol\n\nGuignol () is the main character in a French puppet show which has come to bear his name. It represents the workers in the silk industry of France.\n\nAlthough often thought of as children's entertainment, Guignol's sharp wit and linguistic verve have always been appreciated by adults as well, as shown by the motto of a prominent Lyon troupe: \"Guignol amuses children… and witty adults\".\n\nLaurent Mourguet, Guignol's creator, was born into a family of modest silk weavers on March 3, 1769. The certificate of his marriage to Jeanne Esterle in 1788 shows he was unable to read. When hard times fell on the silk trade during the French Revolution, he became a peddler, and in 1797 started to practice dentistry, which in those days was simply the pulling of teeth. The service was free; the money was made from the medicines sold afterward to ease the pain. To attract patients, he started setting up a puppet show in front of his dentist's chair. In the end, his strategy worked very well to his advantage. \n\nHis first shows featured Polichinelle, a character borrowed from the Italian commedia dell'arte who in England would become Punch. By 1804 the success was such that he gave up dentistry altogether and became a professional puppeteer, creating his own scenarios drawing on the concerns of his working-class audience and improvising references to the news of the day. He developed characters closer to the daily lives of his Lyon audience, first Gnafron, a wine-loving cobbler, and in 1808 Guignol. Other characters, including Guignol's wife Madelon and the gendarme Flageolet soon followed, but these are never much more than foils for the two heroes.\n\nAlthough nominally a silkweaver like much of his original audience, Guignol's profession changes, as does his marital status; he can be in turn valet, peddler, carpenter, shoemaker, or unemployed; at times he is Madelon's husband, at times her smitten suitor according to requirements of the scenario. What remain constant are his poverty, but more importantly his good humor and his sense of justice. The use in French of \"guignol\" as an insult meaning \"buffoon\" is a curious misnomer, as Guignol is clever, courageous and generous; his inevitable victory is always the triumph of good over evil. \n\nSixteen of Mourguet's children and grandchildren continued his tradition, and many of the companies performing today can trace their artistic heritage back to him although Laurent Morguet´s last descendant - Jean-Guy Morguet - died October 8, 2012, at the age of 82, after working all his life in the Theatre de Guignol at Lyon, France. Jean-Guy, learnt his job helping his grandmother Augustine and then his parents. He became, later, the director of the whole theatre until his death. Laurent Mourguet maintained according to the era, the region, or the performers. Guignol's original caustic satire has often been watered down to simple children's fare, and has even been used to parody grand opera, but his original spirit still survives in his hometown of Lyon, where both traditional and original contemporary performances are an integral part of local culture. In addition to his social satire, Guignol has become an important protector of the local dialect, the \"parler lyonnais\".\n\n\n"}

She first appeared in the 1957 book \"This Girl for Hire\" and would appear in nine novels before being retired in the mid-1960s, with two comeback novels in 1971.\n\nThe Honey West character was created by Gloria and Forrest E. \"Skip\" Fickling under the pseudonym \"G.G. Fickling\" in the late 1950s.\n\nForrest Fickling had been a United States Army Air Forces Air Gunner during World War II; he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve after the war, and as a member of that service was called back to active duty during the Korean War. The G.G. represented the initials of his wife, Gloria Gautraud, whom he had married in 1949. The initials were used so the sex of the author would remain vague.\nThough Gloria said that most of the writing was done by Forrest, he said her ideas helped make the female character more plausible and gave her a good dress sense. Gloria had been an assistant fashion editor at \"Look\" magazine and a fashion writer for \"Women's Wear Daily\".\nForrest told the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"I first thought of Marilyn Monroe, and then I thought of [fictional detective] Mike Hammer and decided to put the two together... We thought the most used name for someone you really like is Honey. And she lives in the West, so there was her name.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe character was also the basis for a short-lived ABC TV series in the 1965-66 television season starring Anne Francis and John Ericson. There were 30 episodes. The series was executive produced by Aaron Spelling.\n\nGold Key Comics released a one-shot Honey West comic book in June 1966. In August 2010, Moonstone Books began a \"Honey West\" comic book series, written by Trina Robbins with art by Cynthia Martin. Other writers include Elaine Lee and Ronn Sutton. It lasted 19 issues.

Elise reluctantly agrees to try and contact the spirit of Quinn's mother, Lillith, who died one year prior. However, Elise urges Quinn not to try and contact her mother again after sensing a malevolent force. After auditioning for a school for the performing arts, Quinn sees a mysterious figure waving to her from the distance on the street. Distracted, she is hit by a car, having both of her legs broken in the process. \n\nNow stuck in her home with her father Sean and brother Alex, Quinn begins to experience increasingly disturbing paranormal phenomena, including seeing visions of a dark spirit wearing an oxygen mask known as the \"Man Who Can't Breathe\"—the same figure that caused her accident.

A new poster featuring Stefanie Scott was also released the same day. On July 3, 2014, Focus Features moved the already announced US theatrical release date from April 3 to May 29, 2015. On December 10, 2014, the distribution company announced that the theatrical release date had been moved back again from May 29 to June 5, 2015.\n\nOn May 20, 2015, Focus Features relaunched their Gramercy Pictures label for action, horror, and science fiction movies. \"Insidious: Chapter 3\" was the first release from the revived Gramercy.\n\n\"Insidious: Chapter 3\" grossed $52.2 million in North America and $60.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $112.8 million, against a budget of $10 million.\n\nIn North America, the film made $1.6 million from its early Thursday night showings, from 2,150 theaters, and $10.4 million on its opening day, from 3,003 theaters. It finished at third place in its opening weekend, earning $23 million behind fellow opener \"Spy\" and holdover \"San Andreas\".\n\nOutside North America, \"Insidious: Chapter 3\" grossed $14.3 million in its opening weekend, from 42 countries on 2,989 screens, also finishing in third place behind \"San Andreas\" and \"Spy\". It had the biggest opening for a horror film in the Philippines ($1.5 million) and in Vietnam ($620,000), the second-biggest in Malaysia ($1.6 million), and had similarly successful openings in Russia and the CIS ($2.7 million). Mexico opened with $1.8 million and India with $620,000.\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes lists a 59% approval rating based on 121 reviews and a rating average of 5.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"Insidious: Chapter 3\" isn't as terrifying as the original, although it boasts surprising thematic depth and is enlivened by another fine performance from Lin Shaye.\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 52 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". In CinemaScore polls, cinema audiences gave the film an average score of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nDaniel Krupa of IGN awarded it a score of 7.1 out of 10, saying \"\"Insidious: Chapter 3\" is the most focussed, dark, and creepy installment of the series to date.\" Scott Foundas of \"Variety\" gave the film a negative review, saying \"Chief among things that go bump in the night in \"Insidious: Chapter 3\" is the movie itself—a thuddingly dull prequel to James Wan's very enjoyable (and highly profitable) demonic-possession horror franchise.\" Justin Lowe of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" gave the film a positive review, saying \"\"Insidious: Chapter 3\" offers a relatable young protagonist and several key supporting players from the prior films in a nimble setup to the series.\" Kyle Anderson of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a C+, saying \"\"Insidious Chapter 3\" is the worst kind of sequel: Not terrible, but also cartoonishly unnecessary.\" Michael Ordoña of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" rated it zero out of four stars, saying \"\"Insidious: Chapter 3\" is simply not scary. Not a bit, not a whit. Except that the audience will be terrified of the next stabbing of their eardrums, at generally predictable intervals.\" Michael O'Sullivan of \"The Washington Post\" gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four, saying \"The \"Insidious\" franchise, after three attempts to exorcise its real demons, still can't seem to shake what really haunts it: the ghost of B-movies past.\" Peter Howell of the \"Toronto Star\" gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, saying \"This prequel to the shriek hell, directed and scripted by series writer/actor Leigh Whannell, manages to avoid the Curse of the Triple Cash Grab.\"\n\nKerry Lengel of \"The Arizona Republic\" gave the film three out of five stars, saying \"\"Insidious: Chapter 3\" is almost more a spoof of a classic like \"The Exorcist\" than it is an homage. It's not scary horror, it's silly horror, and the audience is in on the joke.\" Stephen Whitty of the \"Newark Star-Ledger\" gave the film two-and-a-half stars, saying \"You need more than a few sudden noises and scary shocks to make a good horror movie. But \"Insidious: Chapter Three\" is at least an OK horror movie.\" James Berardinelli of \"ReelViews\" gave the film two-and-a-half out of four stars, saying \"They say the third time's the charm. Not with the \"Insidious\" series, it isn't. Admittedly, installment #3 is an improvement over #2, but it fails to reach the highs of the chilling-but-uneven original.\" Tim Robey of \"The Telegraph\" gave the film four out of five stars, saying \"It manages the all-important jump scares with the finesse of a skilled stage illusionist, but it’s the surprisingly sincere emotional core that makes it the pick of the series.\" Katie Rife of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the film a B-, saying \"The motif of grief runs throughout \"Insidious: Chapter 3\", which is surprisingly thematically rich for the third installment of a horror franchise. This emotional undercurrent informs the fright scenes, which otherwise lean rather heavily on jump scares.\" Bilge Ebiri of \"New York\" magazine gave the film a negative review, saying \"This is so often the problem with this genre—scary setups, followed by dopey resolutions—that you sort of want to give the movie a pass. But given its distinguished forebears, \"Insidious: Chapter 3\" doesn’t quite live up to expectations.\"\n\nIn an interview Leigh Whannell was asked \"If there is a fourth \"Insidious\" film, would that be a sequel to \"Chapter 3\", another prequel to the original or will it continue in this timeline or go to a whole new timeline?\" Whannell stated: \"I don't know. I haven't really thought about it yet. But for the purposes of this interview, I'll say that I'd like to explore the time between this film and the first film. That whole area there where Elise has rediscovered her gift, I think you could have a lot of adventures before she arrives. So I think there is a lot of room there. We've kind of established Lin [Shaye] in this particular film as kind of this superhero, so that would be kind of interesting to explore in the other films.\"\n\n\"\" was announced in May 2016 for a release date of October 20, 2017. Whannell will return to write, Blum, Peli and Wan producing as well as Shaye reprising her role as Elise Rainer and Adam Robitel directing. The film was released on January 5, 2018.\n\n\n"}

He moved to Chicago in 1853.\n\nCarbutt founded the Keystone Dry Plate Works in 1879 and was the first to develop sheets of celluloid coated with photographic emulsion for making celluloid film in 1888. Carbutt sliced thin plates from a rigid celluloid block, and then coated them with a silver gelatin emulsion to make a Celluloid Dry plate. Around 1890 he made them in a 35 mm width for William Kennedy Dickson's Kinetoscope, which set the 35 mm film standard for motion picture cameras and still cameras. That format is still the dominant format to this day, as the majority of high end digital cameras use a 35mm sensor and 35mm film is still being used by a significant number of photographers and film makers.\n\n"}
{"id": "867880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=867880", "title": "Latin rock", "text": "Latin rock\n\nLatin rock is a term to describe a music subgenre consisting in melting traditional sounds and elements of Latin American and Caribbean folk with rock music. However, it is widely used in the English-language media to refer any kind of rock music featuring Spanish or Portuguese vocals. This fact lead into a controversy about the scope of the terminology.\n\nLatin rock should not be confused with \"Rock music from Latin America\" or Rock en español. It's also closely related to the Latin alternative scene (which combines Latin elements with alternative rock, pop, electronic music, indie or hip hop among others) a term often used to refer the same phenomenon.\n\n Rock and Roll music of the 1950s originated from a variety of sources including African-American rhythm and blues, blues, gospel, country and western, bluegrass, western swing, and Tin Pan Alley pop music. Also, there was some influence of the traditional Latin music on it. Caribbean rhythms like calypso were remarkable on surf music; and there were some rock and roll songs based on cha-cha-chá or mambo.\n\nLatin Rock (term not yet created) was born in the United States at late 1950s. In 1958 and adaptation of a Mexican folk song called “La bamba” by the chicano rock artist Ritchie Valens. That same year, instrumental rock band The Champs released \"Tequila\", that incorporates clear Latin sounds (composed by chicano Danny Flores).\n\nDuring the 1960s, there were more examples of rock artists like Thee Midniters, Question Mark & the Mysterians, Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs or Sir Douglas Quintet that included Latin rhythms on their compositions. Also the rise of the chicano rock in California joined; although not all of them could be considered as early Latin rock artists since many of them lacked the Latin folk influences.\n\nOn the other hand, at some Latin American countries, Latin rock started to develop on Peru, Colombia or Argentina, but specially Brazil where Tropicália appeared at mid-1960s with the first releases of Os Mutantes, Gal Costa and Caetano Veloso from 1967 to 1970, a music movement that melt rock music with bossa nova, psychedelia and other Latin elements which has been regarded as the main root of the genre.\n\n In 1969, after the release of the debut album by Santana, Latin rock appeared in the US and other parts of the world. They treated to describe the band's music style as a fusion of Latin American and Caribbean rhythms, soul, jazz, funk, blues, psychedelia and rhythm and blues based on rock music.\n\nFollowing Santana, other American bands appeared like Malo, Ocho, Mandrill, El Chicano, Eddie Palmieri's Harlem River Drive, War, Sapo and Azteca at early 1970s popularizing the genre in the USA and the rest of the world since 1970-71.\n\nLatin American counterpart Latin rock bands appeared as it could be seen in Peru with bands like Telegraph Avenue, Traffic Sound, The Mad's, El Polen and specially Black Sugar melting rock with jazz music, Peruvian folk, progressive rock and Latin elements; in Colombia highlighted Siglo Cero, Génesis and La Columna de Fuego; in Argentina Arco Iris; and in Chile, Los Jaivas.\n\nThe genre arrived also in Europe, with the Spaniards Barrabás, Dutch Massada and African-British Osibisa.\n\nMeanwhile, Reggae music achieved a great success around the world. This rhythm originated in Jamaica arose during the 1960s, evolving from ska, rocksteady and bluebeat. Since its origins along with rock music and rhythm and blues with Jamaican folk rhythms, the Caribbean and Continental Latin America elements influenced the scene. Nevertheless, Reggae or Ska have never considered as part of the Latin Rock. On the other hand, Disco Music also influenced Latin rock during the 1970s.\n\n After punk eclosion at late 1970s, the genre also was influenced by many other music styles. Some British punk and new wave acts like The Clash included elements that could be considered as \"latin\" in \"Sandinista!\" (1980). Other bands such as Bow Wow Wow, Gang Of Four, The Slits or Special AKA did so.\n\nIn France, bands like Les Negresses Vertes played a fusion of rock with World music including Latin elements. But Manu Chao was the major success of the Latin rock in France with the band Mano Negra (also as a solo artist) with a style that would be known later as Latin alternative. A mix of rock, with Latin elements, Arabic music, punk, rap, flamenco, ska and reggae.\n\nIn the US during this period bands like David Byrne (ex-leader of Talking Heads), Peter Gabriel, Paul Simon, Willy Deville, Los Lobos, El Vez, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Rage Against The Machine appeared, developing some of these \"mixing\" sounds (specially in Latin folk sounds)\n\nThe genre consolidated during the 1990s in Latin America. Many bands appeared such as Rio Roma (Mexico), Maná (Mexico), Caifanes (Mexico), Café Tacuba (Mexico), Aterciopelados (Colombia), Paralamas do Sucesso (Brazil), Bersuit Vergarabat (Argentina), Karamelo Santo (Argentina), Maldita Vecindad (Mexico), Carmina Burana (Argentina), Los Fabulosos Cadillacs (Argentina), Soda Stereo (Argentina), Los Tres (Chile), Octavia (Bolivia), Karnak (Brazil), Chancho en Piedra (Chile), Julieta Venegas (Mexico) and Los Rabanes (Panama), that incorporated Latin folk rhythms on their compositions (especially Caifanes and Los Fabulosos Cadillacs).\n\n At late 1990s, the rising population of \"Latinos\" in the US(term popularized since the 1960s due to the wrong and confusing use of \"Spanish\" term and the unpopular term \"Hispanic\") lead music industry to create the Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences as a sub-department of National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. Also in 2000 the Latin Grammy Awards were created. Thus, a great part of the English media started to refer any kind of music featuring Spanish vocals as \"Latin music\".\n\nThis term achieved a great success in some Latin American countries, where some of their regional press started to use the new terminology. This phenomenon spread the use of the \"latin rock\" term with a completely different meaning of the original one. This lead into a controversy and confusion in the population.\n\n"}

{"id": "44174725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44174725", "title": "Music community", "text": "Music community\n\nA music community is a group of people involved in a given type of music. Typically such a community has an informal, supportive structure.\nIn the past such groups have typically developed within a town or school, where the members can meet physically. The internet has made it possible for a more dispersed music community to use the web for communication, either via specialized websites or through broader social media. Ethnographic studies indicate that online music communities do not center around one website, but use a network of sites, including personal blogs, artist or publisher sites and social media.\n\nThe musician and musicologist Mícheál Ó Súilleabháin has broadly defined a music community as \"a group of interested participants who agree on the form and content of the music and its social contexts\".\nA music community may be taken to mean a group of people with strong ties who often come together to play and talk about music, but a sense of community may also come from a national educational system that connects young people to their cultural heritage and traditions.\nA more restrictive view limits the term \"music community\" to teachers, composers, performers and the music distribution industry.\n\nThe concept of music communities is well-developed in ethnomusicology. A large part of this discipline consists of studies of groups of people who frequently exchange and communicate musical material.\n\nBarry Shank, writing in 1994 of Rock and roll in Austin, Texas, used the word \"subculture\" to define the shifting meanings and membership of musical communities, or cultural spaces. \nWill Straw built on this work, replacing the term \"subculture\" by \"scene\".\nStraw saw a \"scene\" as relatively transient, while a music community is more stable. He wrote in 1991 that a music community engages in \"an ongoing exploration of one or more musical idioms said to be rooted within a geographically specific historical heritage.\"\nDisputing Straw's characterization, later writers have pointed out that music communities may be mobile and transient.\n\nMusical communities typically have very flexible structures, voluntary membership and people of a wide range of ages.\nThey offer participants the opportunity to play different roles including creator, participant or observer. Conscious efforts may be made to involve disadvantaged members. \nTypically the group encourages diversity, and all members are committed to lifetime learning.\nWhen a music community is widespread, aspects of music-making such as repertoire and style may evolve and diverge.\n\nThere are many types of music community.\nWomen's music communities among the Ewe people of Ghana help create bonds and nurture cooperation between women who would otherwise be pulled apart by competition in their polygamist society.\nIrish immigrants to the United States were generally keen to assimilate and adopt a new ethnic identity as Americans, but a minority held onto their traditional culture and formed Irish traditional music communities in Boston, New York, Chicago and other cities.\nAfter over one hundred years these communities persisted. The primary reason seems to have simply been the entertainment value.\nTeachers may deliberately foster development of a music community within their school, which can assist students in reaching their full potential.\nSuch teachers may build on the Suzuki method in the belief that cooperation in group classes plays an important role, and that competition is inappropriate.\nAccording to Mary Ann Froehlich, \"Competition isolates, while cooperation creates community. ... Our goal is to build an inclusive music community.\"\n\nOne of the early online music communities was established in 1996 by Oh Boy Records, a small independent record company. It took the form of a chat page on its website that let fans of John Prine exchange views and information. The website became the base of a specialized Prine music community.\nHowever, as Prine ceased performing while fighting cancer, and no new recordings were released, the community ran out of information to exchange and went into decline.\nOh Boy eventually closed the chat page.\nAnother early online music community that was the subject of an ethnographic study was the Banjo Hangout, established in 2000.\nAs of 2011 it had about 51,000 members and featured a large online learning center.\nimeem, a social networking site with 28 million monthly visitors, was the first music community to provide ad-supported free online music streaming and downloading. \nOther sites such as Myspace followed with similar services.\nSpecialized software has been developed to support online music communities.\n\nOnline communities have emerged for genres of folk music such as Blue Grass and Old Time. Cyber-ethnography using the framework of Étienne Wenger's social learning theory shows that sites like this may be considered a community of practice (CoP).\nThe members of an online music community can publish, listen to and evaluate the music they have created, giving them a strong sense of membership. It provides a platform within which members can create a musical identity as well as one in which they can build social bonds.\nJ. P. Williams, writing in 2006 in the \"Journal of Contemporary Ethnography\", argued that the driving force behind online music communities is the interest of the participants in building their identities, despite the ostensible focus on making and sharing music.\n\nA 2013 book notes that in Finland the \"Mikseri\" music portal, with about 140,000 registered users, helps people create, share and discuss their music in this sparsely-populated country.\nThis web-based community was the object of ethnographic studies in 2008 and 2009 based on theories of sociocultural learning.\nMembers of Mikseri do not exclusively belong to that community, but may belong to other real-world or online communities.\nAn analysis of event-related data from an online music community shows that events on that site often cause increased interest in a given artist, but propagation over links within digital social communities is also an important factor.\nAn investigation of the music community of fans of Swedish indie music showed that they do not gather around one site, but interact with a network of sites including their own fan sites, Myspace, Last.fm, YouTube and so on.\n\nOnline discussion forums may provide some of the functions of virtual music communities.\nHowever, according to Mary McCarthy a music community should teach uninitiated listeners or musicians, and an online group cannot fill this role.\nOnly a community of real people in a real place can provide the depth of contact, discussion, sharing and support that the novice musician requires for their development.\n\nMusic Therapy is the use of musical instruments, the audio of already made music or the task of improvisational music to either relieve a symptom that involves speech or memory, but one of the newest uses of music therapy using Community music has been in prisons this has helped rehabilitate prisoners mentally of their criminal struggles as well as their mental struggles with anxiety and depression as studied by Dr Christian Gold.\n"}
{"id": "70924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70924", "title": "Music technology (electronic and digital)", "text": "Music technology (electronic and digital)\n\nElectronic and digital music technology is the use of electronic or digital instruments, computers, electronic effects units, software or digital audio equipment by a musician, composer, sound engineer, DJ or record producer to make, perform or record music. The term usually refers to the use of electronic devices, electronic and digital instruments, computer hardware and computer software that is used in the performance, playback, recording, composition, sound recording and reproduction, mixing, analysis and editing of music.\n\nMusic technology is connected to both artistic and technological creativity. Musicians and music technology experts are constantly striving to devise new forms of expression through music, and they are physically creating new devices and software to enable them to do so. Although in the 2010s, the term is most commonly used in reference to modern electronic devices and computer software such as digital audio workstations and Protools digital sound recording software, electronic and digital musical technologies have precursors in the electric music technologies of the early 20th century, such as the electromechanical Hammond organ, which was invented in 1929. In the 2010s, the ontological range of music technology has greatly increased, and it may now be electronic, digital, software-based or indeed even purely conceptual.\n\nMusic technology is taught at many different educational levels, including college diplomas and university degrees at the undergraduate and graduate level. The study of music technology is usually concerned with the creative use of technology for creating new sounds, performing, recording, programming sequencers or other music-related electronic devices, and manipulating, mixing and reproducing music. Music technology programs train students for careers in \"...sound engineering, computer music, audio-visual production and post-production, mastering, scoring for film and multimedia, audio for games, software development, and multimedia production.\" Those wishing to develop new music technologies often train to become an audio engineer working in R&D. Due to the increasing role of interdisciplinary work in music technology, individuals developing new music technologies may also have backgrounds or training in computer programming, computer hardware design, acoustics, record producing or other fields.\n\nIn the 2010s, electronic and digital music technologies are widely used to assist in music education for training students in high school, college and university music programs. Electronic keyboard labs are used for cost-effective beginner group piano instruction in colleges and universities.\n\nEarly pioneers included Luigi Russolo, Halim El-Dabh, Pierre Schaeffer, Pierre Henry, Edgard Varèse, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Ikutaro Kakehashi, and King Tubby. Music technology has been and is being used in many modernist and contemporary experimental music situations to create new sound possibilities.\n\nA synthesizer is an electronic musical instrument that generates electric signals that are converted to sound through instrument amplifiers and loudspeakers or headphones. Synthesizers may either imitate existing sounds (instruments, vocal, natural sounds, etc.), or generate new electronic timbres or sounds that did not exist before. They are often played with an electronic musical keyboard, but they can be controlled via a variety of other input devices, including music sequencers, instrument controllers, fingerboards, guitar synthesizers, wind controllers, and electronic drums. Synthesizers without built-in controllers are often called sound modules, and are controlled using a controller device.\n\nSynthesizers use various methods to generate a signal. Among the most popular waveform synthesis techniques are subtractive synthesis, additive synthesis, wavetable synthesis, frequency modulation synthesis, phase distortion synthesis, physical modeling synthesis and sample-based synthesis. Other less common synthesis types include subharmonic synthesis, a form of additive synthesis via subharmonics (used by mixture trautonium), and granular synthesis, sample-based synthesis based on grains of sound, generally resulting in soundscapes or clouds. In the 2010s, synthesizers are used in many genres of pop, rock and dance music. Contemporary classical music composers from the 20th and 21st century write compositions for synthesizer.\n\nThe development of the modern synthesizer was spurred on by the invention of the miniaturized transistor in 1947. The lightweight transistors made it was possible to make synthesizers much more portable and complex. A new breed of synthesizers appeared, mainly in America. American inventor Robert Moog's synthesizer designs in the 1960s were a significant advancement in the field over its predecessors. This was partially owed to new technologies that became available, such as the newly developed semiconductors. These new instruments were less expensive and became available worldwide. These were capable of producing a vast range of complex sounds. Later versions often incorporated automatic rhythm units, called drum machines. They had more popularity than any synthesizer from the past. The release of Wendy Carlos' album \"Switched-On Bach\" in 1968 brought Moog's synthesizer to the general public's attention. The album demonstrated that besides creating strange sounds, the synthesizer could be used to make beautiful music.\n\nIn the 1970s, the American domination of the synthesizer market was relinquished to the Japanese, with synthesizers made by Yamaha Corporation, Roland Corporation, Korg, Kawai and other companies. Yamaha's DX7 was one of the first mass-market, relatively inexpensive synthesizer keyboards. The DX7 is an FM synthesis based digital synthesizer manufactured from 1983 to 1989. It was the first commercially successful digital synthesizer. Its distinctive sound can be heard on many recordings, especially pop music from the 1980s. The monotimbral, 16-note polyphonic DX7 was the moderately priced model of the DX series keyboard synthesizers. Over 200,000 of the original DX7 were made,\nand it remains one of the best-selling synthesizers of all time. The most iconic bass synthesizer is the Roland TB-303, widely used in acid house music. Other classic synthesizers include the Moog Minimoog, ARP Odyssey, Yamaha CS-80, Korg MS-20, Sequential Circuits Prophet-5, Fairlight CMI, PPG Wave, Roland TB-303, Roland Alpha Juno, Nord Modular and Korg M1.\n\nA drum machine is an electronic musical instrument designed to imitate the sound of drums, cymbals, other percussion instruments, and often basslines. Drum machines either play back prerecorded samples of drums and cymbals or synthesized re-creations of drum/cymbal sounds in a rhythm and tempo that is programmed by a musician. Drum machines are most commonly associated with electronic dance music genres such as house music, but are also used in many other genres. They are also used when session drummers are not available or if the production cannot afford the cost of a professional drummer. In the 2010s, most modern drum machines are sequencers with a sample playback (rompler) or synthesizer component that specializes in the reproduction of drum timbres. Though features vary from model to model, many modern drum machines can also produce unique sounds, and allow the user to compose unique drum beats and patterns.\n\nElectro-mechanical drum machines were first developed in 1949, with the invention of the Chamberlin Rhythmate. Transistorized electronic drum machines later appeared in the 1960s. The Ace Tone Rhythm Ace, created by Ikutaro Kakehashi, began appearing in popular music from the late 1960s, followed by drum machines from Korg and Ikutaro's later Roland Corporation also appearing in popular music from the early 1970s. Sly and the Family Stone's 1971 album \"There's a Riot Goin' On\" helped to popularize the sound of early drum machines, along with Timmy Thomas' 1972 R&B hit \"Why Can't We Live Together\" and George McCrae's 1974 disco hit \"Rock Your Baby\" which used early Roland rhythm machines.\n\nEarly drum machines sounded drastically different than the drum machines that gained their peak popularity in the 1980s and defined an entire decade of pop music. The most iconic drum machine was the Roland TR-808, widely used in hip hop and dance music. Other classic drum machines include the Alesis HR-16, Korg Mini Pops 120, E-MU SP-12, Elektron SPS1 Machinedrum, Roland CR-78, PAiA Programmable Drum Set, LinnDrum, Roland TR-909 and Oberheim DMX.\n\nDigital sampling technology, introduced in the 1980s, has become a staple of music production in the 2000s. Devices that use sampling, record a sound digitally (often a musical instrument, such as a piano or flute being played), and replay it when a key or pad on a controller device (e.g., an electronic keyboard, electronic drum pad, etc.) is pressed or triggered. Samplers can alter the sound using various audio effects and audio processing. Sampling has its roots in France with the sound experiments carried out by Musique Concrete practitioners.\n\nIn the 1980s, when the technology was still in its infancy, digital samplers cost tens of thousands of dollars and they were only used by the top recording studios and musicians. These were out of the price range of most musicians. Early samplers include the 12-bit Toshiba LMD-649 and the 8-bit Emulator I in 1981. The latter's successor, the Emulator II (released in 1984), listed for $8,000. Samplers were released during this period with high price tags, such as the K2000 and K2500.\n\nThe first affordable sampler, the AKAI S612, became available in the mid-1980s and retailed for US$895. Other companies soon released affordable samplers, including the Mirage Sampler, Oberheim DPX-1, and more by Korg, Casio, Yamaha, and Roland. Some important hardware samplers include the Akai Z4/Z8, Ensoniq ASR-10, Roland V-Synth, Casio FZ-1, Kurzweil K250, Akai MPC60, Ensoniq Mirage, Akai S1000, E-mu Emulator, and Fairlight CMI.\n\nOne of the biggest uses of sampling technology was by hip-hop music DJs and performers in the 1980s. Before affordable sampling technology was readily available, DJs\nwould use a technique pioneered by Grandmaster Flash to manually repeat certain parts in a song by juggling between two separate turntables. This can be considered as an early precursor of sampling. In turn, this turntablism technique originates from Jamaican dub music in the 1960s, and was introduced to American hip hop in the 1970s.\n\nIn the 2000s, most professional recording studios use digital technologies. In the 2010s, many samplers exist in the digital-only realm. This new generation of digital samplers are capable of reproducing and manipulating sounds. New genres of music have formed which would be impossible without sampling. Advanced sample libraries have made complete performances of orchestral compositions possible that sound similar to a live performance. Modern sound libraries allow musicians to have the ability to use the sounds of almost any instrument in their productions.\n\nMIDI has been the musical instrument industry standard interface since the 1980s through to the present day. It dates back to June 1981, when Roland Corporation founder Ikutaro Kakehashi proposed the concept of standardization between different manufacturers' instruments as well as computers, to Oberheim Electronics founder Tom Oberheim and Sequential Circuits president Dave Smith. In October 1981, Kakehashi, Oberheim and Smith discussed the concept with representatives from Yamaha, Korg and Kawai. In 1983, the MIDI standard was unveiled by Kakehashi and Smith.\n\nAt the NAMM show in Los Angeles of 1983, MIDI was released. A demonstration at the convention showed two previously incompatible analog synthesizers, the Prophet 600 and Roland Jupiter-6, communicating with each other, enabling a player to play one keyboard while getting the output from both of them. This was a massive breakthrough in the 1980s, as it allowed synths to be accurately layered in live shows and studio recordings. MIDI enables different electronic instruments and electronic music devices to communicate with each other and with computers. The advent of MIDI spurred a rapid expansion of the sales and production of electronic instruments and music software.\n\nIn 1985, several of the top keyboard manufacturers created the MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA). This newly founded association standardized the MIDI protocol by generating and disseminating all the documents about it. With the development of the MIDI File Format Specification by Opcode, every music software company's MIDI sequencer software could read and write each other's files.\n\nSince the 1980s, personal computers developed and became the ideal system for utilizing the vast potential of MIDI. This has created a large consumer market for software such as MIDI-equipped electronic keyboards, MIDI sequencers and Digital Audio Workstations. With universal MIDI protocols, electronic keyboards, sequencers, and drum machines can all be connected together.\n\nSome universally accepted varieties of MIDI software applications include music instruction software, MIDI sequencing software, music notation software, hard disk recording/editing software, patch editor/sound library software, computer-assisted composition software, and virtual instruments. Current developments in computer hardware and specialized software continue to expand MIDI applications.\n\nComputer and synthesizer technology joining together changed the way music is made, and is one of the fastest changing aspects of music technology today. Dr. Max Matthews, a telecommunications engineer at Bell Telephone Laboratories' Acoustic and Behavioural Research Department, is responsible for some of the first digital music technology in the 50s. Dr. Matthews also pioneered a cornerstone of music technology; analog to digital conversion.\n\nThe first generation of professional commercially available computer music instruments, or workstations as some companies later called them, were very sophisticated elaborate systems that cost a great deal of money when they first appeared. They ranged from $25,000 to $200,000. The two most popular were the Fairlight, and the Synclavier.\n\nIt was not until the advent of MIDI that general-purpose computers started to play a role in music production. Following the widespread adoption of MIDI, computer-based MIDI editors and sequencers were developed. MIDI-to-CV/Gate converters were then used to enable analogue synthesizers to be controlled by a MIDI sequencer.\n\nReduced prices in personal computers caused the masses to turn away from the more expensive workstations. Advancements in technology have increased the speed of hardware processing and the capacity of memory units. Software developers write new, more powerful programs for sequencing, recording, notating, and mastering music.\n\nMusic sequencer software, such as Pro Tools, Logic Audio and many others, are the most widely used form of contemporary music technology in the 2000s. Such programs allow the user to record acoustic sounds with a microphone, mix tracks record or MIDI musical sequences, which may then be organized along a timeline and edited on a flat-panel display of a computer or Digital Audio Workstation. Musical segments recorded on can be copied and duplicated ad infinitum, without any loss of fidelity or added noise (a major contrast from analog recording, in which every copy leads to a loss of fidelity and added noise). Digital music can be edited and processed using a multitude of audio effects. Contemporary classical music sometimes uses computer-generated sounds, either pre-recorded or generated/manipulated live, in conjunction or wikt:juxtaposition with classical acoustic instruments like the cello or violin. Classical and other notated types of music are frequently written on scorewriter software.\n\nMany musicians and artists use 'patcher' type programmes, such as Pd, Bidule, Max/MSP, Kyma (sound design language) and Audiomulch as well as (or instead of) digital audio workstations or sequencers and there are still a significant number of people using more \"traditional\" software only approaches such as CSound or the Composers Desktop Project. Music technology includes many forms of music reproduction. Music and sound technology refer to the use of sound engineering in a commercial, experimental or amateur hobbyist manner. Music technology and sound technology may sometimes be classed as the same thing, but they actually refer to different fields of work. Sound engineering refers primarily to the use of sound technology for sound recording or in sound reinforcement systems used in concerts and live shows.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47623761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47623761", "title": "New Nigerian Cinema", "text": "New Nigerian Cinema\n\nNew Nigerian Cinema (also known as New Wave or controversially as New Nollywood) is an emerging phase in Nigerian cinema, in which there became a major shift in the method of film production, from the video format, which came about during the video boom, back to the cinema method, which constituted the films produced in the Golden era of Nigerian cinema history. The films in the New Wave are specifically characterized by improved narrative complexity, aesthetic nuance, much higher budgets and advanced overall production values, when compared to video films from the second generation of filmmakers. They are mostly released theatrically, although some are still released directly on DVD.\n\nSince the early 2000s, several discussions and conferences have been held, based on how to revamp the Nigerian film industry and bring about more professionalism like it used to be in the golden era. During this time, some other filmmakers, such as Tunde Kelani and Tade Ogidan tried to make \"break away\" films, which were supposedly different from the norm. The now defunct \"Amstel Malta Box Office\" production company also made several films with the aim of making a difference. However, all of these films were also produced in the same video format that the other filmmakers used, albeit with quality stories and better directions. New Nigerian Cinema finally emerged in the mid-2000s with the release of films such as \"Irapada\" (2006) and \"The Amazing Grace\" (2006). \"The Figurine\" (2009) by Kunle Afolayan is generally regarded as the break out film, which heightened the media attention towards \"New Nigerian Cinema\" revolution, due to its critical and commercial success in Nigeria, as well as screenings in notable international film festivals.\n\nFew years into the 2000s, Nigeria began to experience the growth of cinemas, which was initially structured for the middle and upper class. The Silverbird Group is the first company to launch a series of modern Cinema houses across major cities in Nigeria, mostly situated in affluent areas and districts. It launched its cinema chains in 2004, starting with the Silverbird Galleria in Victoria Island, Lagos. Not long after the establishment of Silverbird cinemas, Genesis Deluxe Cinemas and Ozone Cinemas were also launched, creating a competition in the cinema business. Much later, in the 2010s, Film House cinemas and Viva cinemas also came into the picture, leading into wider availability of cinemas in the country, and most importantly, availability outside the affluent neighbourhoods.\n\nSince 2006, there have been several \"Project Nollywood\" funds by the Nigerian Government, provided to filmmakers, in order to aid the production of high quality films, as well as to aid proper distribution infrastructure across the country. The grants have also been used to help more Nigerian filmmakers to go for formal training in film schools. As at 2015, the highest grossing film in Nigerian contemporary film history is \"30 Days in Atlanta\" (2014), which grossed approximately ₦140 million. As of 2013, Nigerian cinema is rated as the third most valuable film industry in the world based on its worth and overall revenues generated.\n\nSince the early 2000s, several discussions and conferences have been held, based on how to revamp the Nigerian film industry and bring about more professionalism like it used to be in the 1970s. During this time, some other filmmakers tried to make \"break away\" films, which were quite different from the norm; such films include: \"Thunderbolt\" (2001) by Tunde Kelani, \"Dangerous Twins\" (2004) by Tade Ogidan, \"Madam dearest\" (2005) also by Tade Ogidan and \"30 Days\" by Mildred Okwo amongst other. The now defunct \"Amstel Malta Box Office\" production company also made several films with the aim of making a difference. However, all of these films were also produced in the same video format that the other filmmakers used, albeit with quality stories and better directions.\n\nIn the Golden Age, the cinema culture was very vibrant amongst Nigerians. However, the culture started declining towards the late 1980s and the cinema business came crumbling into the 1990s. Few years into the 21st century, Nigeria began to experience the growth of cinemas, which was initially structured for the middle and upper class. The Silverbird Group is the first company to launch a series of modern Cinema houses across major cities in Nigeria, mostly situated in affluent areas and districts. It launched its cinema chains in 2004, starting with the Silverbird Galleria in Victoria Island, Lagos. The Silverbird Galleria is a large shopping mall, with an upscale cinema facility and various outlets where mercantile activities take place. This provides more reasons to visit the place beyond just watching films, but more of a social activity and a modified sort of entertainment beyond film watching. This trend has given another probable explanation as to the demise of the Nigerian cinema culture in the 1980s, which might have been as a result of the unfashionable appearance of most cinemas of the Golden era.\n\nSilverbird cinemas upon establishment started screening Nigerian films with high production quality, as a result discouraging poor film production; the cinema culture in the Nigerian cities with film theatres started experiencing a significant improvement, and with huge potentials. However, well produced Nigerian films were generally very few at the time; even at that, most films screened were produced in Yoruba-language, because they attracted more crowd, compared to a typical English-language film which often had no viewers when screened. The first New wave film to be shown at a cinema was the Yoruba-language film \"Irapada\" (2006) by Kunle Afolayan, which was screened at the Silverbird Galleria in Lagos.\n\nThe Silverbird experiment became very successful, and as a result, the group launched few more cinema branches in Lagos and other cities in the country. Not long after the establishment of Silverbird cinemas, Genesis Deluxe Cinemas and Ozone Cinemas were also launched creating a competition in the cinema business. However, the cinemas at start were still very under-patronized, owing to the fact that most of them were established in the upscale areas; \"It hardly makes sense for people to travel far to indulge in the pleasure of watching films, especially with the attendant problems of traffic and logistics\", stated Jide Kosoko, pushing for establishment of theatres in inner neighbourhoods and Local Government Areas. Much later, in the 2010s, FilmHouse cinemas also came into the picture, leading to more cinemas in the country and availability outside the affluent neighbourhoods.\n\nIn 2006, \"Project Nollywood\" was launched by the Nigerian Government, in conjunction with Ecobank. The project provided ₦100 million (US$781,000) to Nigerian filmmakers to produce high quality films. Films produced with this grant include: Charles Novia's \"Caught In The Middle\" (2007), Chico Ejiro's \"100 Days In The Jungle\" (2007) and Fred Amata's \"Letters to a Stranger\" (2007), which were all produced using digital cinematography. Ecobank also funded a multimillion Naira distribution network across the country during this period.\n\nIn 2010, the administration of President Goodluck Jonathan launched a ₦30 billion (US$200 million) \"Creative and Entertainment Industry\" Intervention Fund, financed by Bank of Industry (BOI), in conjunction with Nigerian Export and Import (NEXIM) Bank. This grant, although dubbed as a spin-off of \"Project Nollywood\", was for the entire Nigerian Creative Arts and Entertainment sector. The vision of the grant for the film industry however is to help more Nigerian filmmakers in training, funding, and also help in creating necessary infrastructure for the industry. One of the major distribution companies established through this loan is FilmHouse Cinemas. Started by Kene Mparu and Kene Okwuosa in 2012, the cinema chain as at 2014 has modern theatres in four cities in Nigeria, including Lagos, Ibadan, Asaba and Calabar, with plans to have at least 25 cinemas across the country. Other distribution companies who benefitted from the grant include: Silverbird Cinemas, Ozone Cinemas, Viva Cinemas and G-Media. The 2012 film \"Doctor Bello\" (2012) by Tony Abulu is the first film to be funded with this grant.\n\nIn 2013, a smaller new grant of ₦3 billion (US$20 million) was awarded once again solely for Nollywood, and specifically for the production of high quality films. Other films that benefitted from one \"Project Nollywood\" grant or another include: \"Flower Girl\" (2013), \"Half of a Yellow Sun\" (2013) and \"The Department\" (2015). Several filmmakers were also sponsored for formal training in film schools with this grant.\n\nIn 2015, the Bank of Industry (BOI) launched another \"NollyFund\" program for the purpose of giving financial support in form of loans to film producers. A NollyFund Implementation Advisory Group was set up for the program, in order to ensure that only commercially viable scripts with good storylines benefit from the scheme. The group consist of cinema management experts, national film distributors, production and post-production experts, film critics, and film producers; their sole purpose is to critically review all the film scripts and associated budgets submitted to the Bank of Industry by film producers and make \"technical recommendations to the management for final credit appraisal and subsequent approval in line with the Bank's Credit Policy\".\n\nThe popular 2009 thriller film \"The Figurine\" is generally considered the game changer, which heightened the media attention towards \"New Nigerian Cinema\" revolution. The film was a critical and commercial success in Nigeria, and it was also screened in international film festivals. The 2010 film \"Ijé\" by Chineze Anyaene, overtook \"The Figurine\" to become the highest grossing Nigerian film; a record it held for four years, until it was overtaken in 2014 by \"Half of a Yellow Sun\" (2013). Other popular films released in the early years of this revolution include: \"The Amazing Grace\" (2006) by Jeta Amata, \"Through the Glass\" (2008) by Stephanie Okereke, \"Anchor Baby\" (2010) by Lonzo Nzekwe, \"Inale\" (2010) by Jeta Amata, \"Tango with Me\" (2010) by Mahmood Ali-Balogun and \"The Mirror Boy\" (2011) by Obi Emelonye, amongst others.\n\nBy the end of 2013, the film industry reportedly hit a record breaking revenue of ₦1.72 trillion (US$11 billion). As of 2014, the industry was worth ₦853.9 billion (US$5.1 billion) making it the third most valuable film industry in the world, behind the United States and India. It contributed about 1.4% to Nigeria's economy; this was attributed to the increase in the number of quality films produced and more formal distribution methods.\n\nActor Wale Ojo, one of the pioneers and a strong supporter of the \"New Nigerian Cinema\" movement describes the movement as \"an elevation of Nigerian film -- high production values, good strong narratives, stories that capture the essence of who we are as Nigerians, as Africans [...] It is a new movement, it's a renaissance, it's a rebirth if you like -- perhaps even a throwback to the 70s but obviously with a very, very modern tint, a very modern glaze to it -- and it's exciting,\". Filmmaker Victor Okhai says: \"It is expected that the quality of films will improve. We are at a stage where we can no longer play the mediocre\".\n\nUnlike the Video film era, films in the new wave are generally of much improved quality, with considerably bigger budgets; averaging between ₦40 million (US$250,000) and ₦120 million ($750,000). These films' production periods take months and even span into years, a far cry from the films in video format which are usually shot in a matter of days or weeks. Other notable improvements in the New Nollywood include: more subtle performances from actor, different from the overt melodrama which constituted the video era; more practical; more logical and generally better stories.\n\nThemes explored in these films are often characterized by consciously cosmopolitan themes, as most of the filmmakers are relatively young. \"The Figurine\", for example has a narrative which contains supernatural themes similar to the average video film; it is however concluded with an inconclusive logical twist which has been subjected to analytical debates.\n\nA proper copyright and distribution system still remained one of the major challenges in the New Nigerian Cinema; this owes to the initial unavailability of enough cinemas, thereby making it impossible for filmmakers to recoup their investments. As at 2014, Nigeria had just 23 movie theatres, with approximately hundred screens. This was pretty small for a population of 170 million, with a rapidly emerging middle class. More so, too small to sustain a large film industry.\n\nAs a result of the inability to make profits through only cinema earnings, many of the new filmmakers have resorted to sponsorships and product placements as a means of recouping production costs. An example of such filmmakers is Kunle Afolayan, who stated that sponsorship could fund about 30 to 50 percent of a film's budget. Afolayan in particular has also cultivated the habit of screening his films in public halls and theatres, especially in areas lacking cinemas. Tunde Kelani is another notable filmmaker who usually employs this method of distribution. Another method filmmakers use in recouping investments is by organizing premium private screenings for corporate organizations, as well as entering into deals with pay-TV networks and free-to-air broadcasters across the continent. Online film rights are also acquired by Video on demand platforms across the continent and beyond.\n\nSome other filmmakers have also turned the way of targeting foreign developed markets, by featuring foreign cast members – examples: \"Black November\" (2012) by Jeta Amata, \"Doctor Bello\" (2013) by Tony Abulu and \"Half of a Yellow Sun\" (2013) by Biyi Bandele; this strategy, which initially seemed like the \"easy way out\" has however been deemed unsustainable, and most of the films in fact were not able to break even in the targeted markets. In recent times, there have also been talks on establishing low cost and open air cinemas in neighbourhoods, like there was in the 1970s; none has however materialized as of 2015.\n\nFrom early years of the New Wave till present day, DVD is considered a \"no go\" area, due to the prevalent copyright infringement in the country. In no time, \"New Nollywood\" became synonymous with delayed DVD release, generally taking up to three or four years before release. This is generally because filmmakers intend to maximize profit before releasing on DVD, which is no longer profitable at the moment. Some filmmakers also believed the good films are better restricted to the cinemas, as it's ridiculous to make such outstanding efforts only to make the films disappear into a \"mob of useless films\" which were still prevalent as of 2012, despite the New Cinema movement. This notion made screening at the cinemas to also become like a criterion for viewers to discern which film to hit or miss. However, unlike in the video film era where many filmmakers were left to the mercy of \"industry sharks and pirates\" that profited from their creativity, details of sales and box office returns were now better kept, thereby creating a sort of investor-confidence in the now relatively formal film sector.\n\nNot too long after the New Nigerian Cinema movement was embraced, the malaise of copyright violation quickly caught up with movies made in this era as well. Initially, the films were copied immediately following their DVD releases; examples of films given huge media attention due to infringement include: \"Maami\" (2011) by Tunde Kelani and \"Half of a Yellow Sun\". The phenomenon became a major national concern in 2015, after \"October 1\" (2014) by Kunle Afolayan was leaked even before it was released on DVD. This turn of events raised several questions on how this was possible, and concerns over the safety of film copies being sent to cinema houses for screening.\n\nThe cause of copyright violation has been attributed to various factors, which include: poor content management by distributors, who fail to implement the available \"anti-piracy strategies and tools\", and also laxity from the government. National Film and Video Censors Board (NFVCB) had put in place several policies to curb infringement, many of which had little or no impact. Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC) also became active in pursuing infringers, instituting projects such as \"Strategic Action Against Piracy (STRAP)\". However, it was reported that the bootleggers, who are mostly located in Alaba market, a very congested and disorganized area, have often resisted arrest by law enforcement officials, whom they usually engage in fierce battles by employing all manners of dangerous weapons.\n\nThe NCC also began the implementation of a new \"Copyright Optical Discs Plants Regulations\", which gives the NCC administrative and enforcement powers over the production processes of optical discs' manufacturers and plants as well as over the importation and exportation of the finished film products. All these measures have however been of little impact, as unauthorized copying remained prevalent, and NCC itself have been accused of aiding the practice. Still in the bid to fight infringement, Audio-Visual Rights Society (AVRS) was established, headed by Mahmood Ali-Balogun. AVRS is a Collective Management Organization set up to help prevent creative works from being duplicated and overused by unauthorised bodies. It is affiliated to World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC) and the Nigeria Film Corporation (NFC) with the sole purpose of overseeing the collection and distribution of the royalties on behalf of the copyright owners in the film industry.\n\nIn January 2015, the Nigerian Government launched another project tagged \"Innovation Distribution Fund (IDF)\" under the existing \"Project Nollywood\" to help protect copyright, by helping to expand and standardize the film distribution system. The fund was targeted at businesses operating or seeking to operate in the film distribution sector; it aimed to co-finance new channels and support the expansion of current distribution system and to help boost the number and quality of distribution options, including technology-based solutions such as digital streaming.\n\nIn June 2015, \"Business Day\" estimated that about ₦7.5 billion (US$46 million) is lost to copyright violation yearly in Nigeria. It is particularly difficult to curb infringement in the Nigerian film industry, majorly because the video film era was built and sustained on its framework, which ironically eventually became its downfall and has become a major problem in the industry. The problem has become almost incorporated into the Nigerian distribution system, as the people involved at this time are mostly unprofessional film people of the video boom period, who are now out of business but still want to retain their wealthy status.\n\n"}

Based in Toronto, it was founded in 1993 as a partnership between Peter Oliver and Michael Bonacini when they opened their first collaboration — a restaurant named Jump.\n\nIn the years since, the company has expanded and it currently owns multiple venues and properties in and around Toronto. According to a 2013 \"The Globe and Mail\" piece, the company employs a staff of 1,200 people.\n\nIn operation for more than two decades, Jump is O&B's flagship restaurant. During that time it became a well known business lunch and dinner spot in Toronto's Financial District.\n\nWhen it opened at the corner of Bay & Wellington West in late 1993 during the early 1990s recession in Canada, Jump was a major investment by the 44-year-old South African-born former stockbroker and real estate entrepreneur Peter Oliver who had been an active restaurateur in Toronto since 1978 and 33-year-old Michael Bonacini who had made his name as chef at Centro, a popular Franco Prevedello-owned Italian cuisine fine dining spot at Yonge and Eglinton. Furthermore, at the time, Oliver owned successful midtown and uptown Toronto restaurants Oliver's Old Fashioned Bakery and Oliver's Bistro (also in the Yonge and Eglinton area), Bofinger Brasserie (near Yonge & St. Clair), and Auberge du Pommier (in North York near Yonge and York Mills); though he opened Jump as a partnership with Bonacini in 1993, Oliver kept the sole ownership of those four restaurants. Their collaboration occurred almost by chance - Oliver had been setting up the Jump project for years before his chef-to-be fell through and he turned to Bonacini who was the executive chef at Centro, across the street from Oliver's Old Fashioned Bakery.\n\nLocated adjacent to the old glass-covered walkway in Commerce Court East, Jump aimed to bring a New York-style restaurant/bar with an offbeat menu and vibe. Launched with a blowout party with 600 guests and a rock band, the restaurant quickly established itself as the favourite of the business lunch crowd.\n\nIn February 2013, ahead of its twentieth anniversary, the restaurant closed down for a month in order to undergo a C$1 million upgrade including the installation of state-of-the-art audio visual equipment to better meet the needs of clients who book space for private business meetings as well as renovation to the dining room, bar, and kitchen.\n\nIn 1995, following the quick failure of Chapeau (O&B's first project since Jump took off), the company accepted an offer from the TD Bank Tower landlord about opening a restaurant on the building's 54th floor where a struggling vine bar had been operating up to that point. A new restaurant called Canoe opened on 21 September 1995 and quickly turned into another big winner for O&B, by the late 2000s generating between C$6 and 7 million in revenue annually.\nIn May 2015, nearly 20 years after the restaurant opened its doors, \"The Globe & Mail\"'s Chris Nuttall-Smith awarded Canoe four stars, calling the restaurant \"fresher, more ambitious, better-polished and more committed today to its cool Canadian mission than ever.\"\n\nOpened in 1987 in North York's affluent York Mills neighbourhood, under Peter Oliver's sole ownership, the fine dining French cuisine spot Auberge du Pommier operated under his command until 1997 when Oliver's partner in the rising O&B company Michael Bonacini entered into its ownership structure as a co-owner. The restaurant thus after ten years got placed under the O&B banner.\n\nLocated in a mid 19th century cottage that was originally built in nearby Hoggs Hollow before getting relocated to its present location, the restaurant offers refined and modern interpretations of classic French dishes. Its executive chef is Marc St. Jacques who took over the post in 2011 having previously worked under celebrity chef Michael Mina at his restaurant Michael Mina at Bellagio in Las Vegas.\n\n"}

{"id": "50833294", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50833294", "title": "Pace (narrative)", "text": "Pace (narrative)\n\nIn literature, pace, or pacing is the speed at which a story is told—not necessarily the speed at which the story takes place. The number of words needed to write about a certain event does not depend upon how much time the event takes to happen; it depends upon how important that moment is to the story. The pace is determined by the length of the scenes, how fast the action moves, and how quickly the reader is provided with information. It is also sometimes dictated by the genre of the story: comedies move faster than dramas; action adventures move faster than suspense. A dragging pace is characteristic of many novels turned down by publishers, and of some that find their way into print but not into the hearts and recommendations of readers. Most rejected manuscripts move too slowly, encouraging readers to put them down. \n\nStorytellers have a number of writing tools at their disposal—for example, narration, action, description, and dialogue. When considering how to pace a story, description and narration will move it along slowly, steadily, and easily, while action and dialogue will speed it up. Of all the tools at a writer's disposal, dialogue is the one that most quickly puts the characters and the reader into the present moment, even more so than action.\n\nPace can be increased through:\nPace can be decreased through:\n\nWhile \"dialogue\" is the element that brings a story and the characters to life on the page, \"action\" creates the movement, and \"narrative\" gives the story its depth and substance. Writing a story means weaving all the elements of fiction together. When this is done right, weaving dialogue, action, and narrative can create a beautiful tapestry. Pacing is probably the most common fiction element to pay attention to when considering when to and when not to weave dialogue, narrative, and action. When creating a fast-paced conflict scene between two or more people, a writer might do well to consider only dialogue, at least for parts of it. Perhaps the characters have just entered into an argument and the writer wants to speed up the scene. Then there are times when a scene should move slowly, so it is not always best to use dialogue. However, reading slow-moving dialogue is preferable to reading lengthy passages of philosophical narrative. There are scenes in all stories that work best using only narrative or only dialogue or only action. There are no definite rules about when to and when not to weave. To weave well is to find the story's rhythm.\n\nA good plot is an exercise in proper balance. By staying aware of the scenes' levels of intensity and writing accordingly, a writer can make novels fresh and memorable to their readers. Beginning writers often give every moment in their stories the same weight. However, in writing fiction, they are in charge of the way time moves. They can pass quickly over what is unimportant, or even skip it entirely. Then they can stretch out the events their readers care about. There is a time for telling and a time for showing. Most stories are paced not too fast, but too slowly. On the other hand, there is nothing less exciting than non-stop excitement, so writers must avoid the monotony of constant action and texture the pace. Writing should be done with a consciousness of pacing and tension. In the rising action of the story, reader interest can be maintained by upping the action ante with each succeeding scene. The initial obstacle the hero overcomes should be smaller than the one that follows.\n\nDifferent kinds of stories call for different kinds of characters, tension, pacing, themes, and dialogue. A fast-paced action adventure needs fast-paced dialogue in every scene to keep the story moving forward quickly. Likewise, a literary story needs the dialogue to match the pace of the other elements in the story—it needs to move more slowly. Genre stories generally move quickly, employing more dialogue and action and less slow-paced narrative, because they are generally plot-driven rather than character-driven, like literary and mainstream stories. The emphasis is on the action that keeps the plot moving rather than the narrative that keeps the character growing.

The 187th overall episode of the series, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 15, 2009 and in the United Kingdom on April 17, 2009. In the episode, Randy helps Stan cheat in a pinewood derby race, which inadvertently leads to the discovery of alien life. When an alien gangster visits South Park and the residents come into possession of his stolen \"space cash\", they decide to keep it for themselves and hide it from alien police officers who are looking for it.\n\nThe episode was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States for strong to extreme language. \"Pinewood Derby\" was seen by 2.78 million households in its original broadcast, according to Nielsen ratings, making it the second most-watched episode on Comedy Central the week it aired. The episode received mixed reviews upon its initial broadcast.\n\n\"Pinewood Derby\" has been noted for spoofing a number of world leaders, such as Gordon Brown, Silvio Berlusconi, Vladimir Putin, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Raila Odinga, Taro Aso, Han Seung-soo, Nicolas Sarkozy, Matti Vanhanen, Angela Merkel, Wen Jiabao and John Howard. The episode was originally scheduled to air on MTV Latin America in February 2010 but was pulled at the last minute, allegedly due to its perceived negative portrayal of Mexican President Felipe Calderón.\n\nRandy Marsh, determined to make sure his son Stan wins the annual statewide pinewood derby, slips an object into the back of the car to give it an advantage. Stan learns from a news report that the object is a superconducting magnet, stolen from the Large Hadron Collider by Randy disguised as Princess Leia. During the finals, Randy coaxes Stan to lie to the judges and say he used only the parts in the approved pinewood derby kit. Stan wins first place when his car reaches warp speed, shooting off the track and into space, where it is later found by an alien species. Soon after, a spaceship lands in South Park, but its pilot is a bank robber named \"Baby Fark McGee-zax\" who demands that Stan and Randy build him a new warp drive while holding the entire planet at gunpoint. Everyone believes Stan and his father can create the drive using only the approved pinewood derby kit.\n\nStan tries to persuade Randy to tell the truth about the stolen magnet, but Randy refuses in order to avoid embarrassment. As the pair works on the warp drive, an Intergalactic Police ship approaches Earth; McGeezax cloaks his ship and drags Stan out of sight as a hostage, leaving the townspeople to divert the officers' questions. The officers say that McGeezax stole a large sum of space cash, but no one admits to seeing him, and the officers leave. Randy then provides a diversion for McGeezax while Stan, at Randy's insistence, stabs him to death with a shank. McGeezax's ship is found to contain the stolen space cash, but instead of returning it, Randy persuades everyone to divide it among themselves. Randy, in contact with all world leaders, buys other countries' silence by giving them a share. Four days later, the officers return to South Park. They now know that McGeezax landed here and Randy tells them of his death, but everyone denies finding any space cash.\n\nRandy tries to keep other countries from spending the space cash since that might alert the Intergalactic Police; however, this fails when Mexico spends its money on 32 hospitals and 7 water parks, and China spends it on 48 soccer stadiums. Learning that Finland is about to divulge to the cops, Randy persuades the rest of the world to wipe Finland out in a nuclear missile attack. The Intergalactic Police pay a third visit to ask about the strike, but the South Park residents fake disbelief. By this time, Stan has had enough of the deception, so he tells the truth about cheating in the pinewood derby and returns his trophy; however, no one else on the planet comes clean about the space cash. McGeezax emerges from the officers' ship, having only faked his death. He reveals that he is really Kevern Zaksor, ambassador to new world testing, and that the entire chain of events was a test to see if Earth was worthy of joining the intergalactic community but humans proven to be too selfish, greedy, chaotic and deceitful. As punishment for failing, the Earth and the Moon are isolated from the rest of the Universe (although it appears to have disappeared later on). The episode ends with Randy saying, \"Well that sucks.\"\n\n\"Pinewood Derby\" was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. The episode first aired on April 15, 2009, in the United States, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. The theme of the episode was a warning about the dangers of greed, lying, and cheating.\n\nAmong the world leaders who communicate with Randy in the episode are French president Nicolas Sarkozy, Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel, Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi, Chinese president Hu Jintao, Japanese prime minister Taro Aso, Mexican president Felipe Calderón, and Finnish prime minister Matti Vanhanen. The episode received some degree of criticism overseas for depicting the wrong leaders for its countries. The episode featured John Howard as Prime Minister of Australia, even though he had been replaced by Kevin Rudd almost eighteen months earlier; according to the \"Macquarie National News\", the episode \"has copped some flack on video sharing websites\" over the error. The episode also features Vladimir Putin as President of Russia, even though he stepped down in May 2008. The episode also featured Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Gordon Brown.\n\nIn its original American broadcast, \"Pinewood Derby\" was watched by 2.78 million overall households, according to the Nielsen ratings, making it the second most-watched Comedy Central production of the week, behind the Ron White stand-up special \"Behavioral Problems\", which was seen by 3.36 million households.\n\nThe episode received mixed reviews. Josh Modell of \"The A.V. Club\" said the episode was \"boring\" and \"unfunny\", and was particularly disappointing following the episode \"Fishsticks\" the previous week. Modell said, \"\"South Park\" episodes don't get much lazier or uninspired than this one. It was like half an idea stretched out forever and ever, and with very little payoff.\" Carlos Delgado of \"If Magazine\" said the episode plot was too silly and lacked laughs: \"All in all, I was left feeling a little cheated. \"Pinewood Derby\" wasn’t funny, it was just weird.\" Ken Tucker of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said the episode was told with \"the warp-speed storytelling style that is making this season one of \"South Park\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s best\". Travis Fickett of IGN said he was happy to see an episode centered on Randy Marsh, who he said is an excellent character; Fickett said of \"Pinewood Derby\", \"This isn't a great episode but its fast-paced lunacy in the \"South Park\" tradition and most of the genre tropes it riffs on are dead on.\"\n\n\"Pinewood Derby\" drew considerable media attention in Mexico when it originally aired due to its depiction of Mexican president Felipe Calderón. The episode was scheduled to air in Spanish on MTV Latin America on February 8, 2010, and was advertised extensively for one week prior to the broadcast date. However, a few hours before the scheduled time, the network decided not to air the episode and replaced it with the episode \"The Ring\", allegedly due to its depiction of Calderón irritating the international community and frivolously spending the space cash on water parks. This depiction was said to differ from the image Mexico's Ministry of the Interior sought to present of Calderón, whom they dubbed the \"Employment president\". MTV said the \"South Park\" creators did not get a special permit needed to broadcast an image of Mexico's flag, and MTV executives said they did not want to risk angering fans by altering the image. The explanation was met with skepticism by Mexican \"South Park\" fans, some of whom accused MTV of unfair censorship. MTV later announced it would broadcast the episode on April 4 after the network was granted permission from the Minister of the Interior to air it. When asked to comment on the episode getting pulled, Stone said, \"That's so far away from us. We read that on the news, too, along with everyone else.\"\n\n\"Pinewood Derby\", along with the thirteen other episodes from \"South Park\" thirteenth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set and two-disc Blu-ray set in the United States on March 16, 2010. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode, a collection of deleted scenes, and a special mini-feature \"Inside Xbox: A Behind-the-Scenes Tour of South Park Studios\", which discussed the process behind animating the show with \"Inside Xbox\" host Major Nelson.\n\n"}

{"id": "871837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=871837", "title": "Tales of Symphonia", "text": "Tales of Symphonia\n\nThe game takes place in a fictional world called Sylvarant and follows Lloyd Irving. Lloyd accompanies his childhood friend, Colette Brunel, who is destined to go on a journey to save their world. As their journey progresses, they learn that saving Sylvarant endangers Tethe'alla, a world parallel to their own. The game's central theme is .\n\nThe game's reception was generally positive with critics praising the gameplay but criticizing the plot. It received a Japan Game Awards in 2003 and had received re-releases under the Player's Choice and PlayStation 2 the Best labels. In the United States, over 100 thousand copies were sold during the first two weeks and has sold over a million copies worldwide.\n\nSince its release, \"Tales of Symphonia\" spawned a substantial media franchise in Japan. The game has been adapted into seven manga collections, two novel series, seven drama CDs, and an OVA anime series. A sequel entitled \"\" was released for the Wii in 2008. \"Tales of Symphonia\" and its sequel was collected as a PlayStation 3 high definition release in \"Tales of Symphonia Chronicles\" in 2013. A Steam version was released on February 2, 2016.\n\nLike previous installments in the \"Tales\" series, \"Tales of Symphonia\" consists primarily of three major areas: an overworld field map, town and dungeon maps, and a battle screen. The overworld map is a 3D model, featuring a scaled-down version of the game's fictional world which the player travels through to reach the game's locations. As with preceding games in the series, the world map can be traversed by foot, on the party's quadrupedal pet Noishe, and on flying vehicles known as Rheairds. On field maps, characters are directed across realistically scaled environments. The battle screen is a 3D representation of an area, in which the player commands the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies.\n\nOn the overworld and field maps, various skits between the characters can be viewed. They involve animated character portraits, subtitles, and, in the Japanese version, full voice acting. Skits concern anything from character development to side details. Overworld map skits affect Lloyd's relationships with other party members. The player will be able to make certain decisions that imperceptibly affect how the other characters think of Lloyd. Some of these choices have minor ramifications for the game's storyline.\n\n\nDuring battle sequences, the game uses the Multi-Line Linear Motion Battle System. Four characters from the party are chosen to battle; those not controlled by a player are guided by artificial intelligence with instructions set by the player beforehand. Damage dealt to the opponent fills a \"Unison Gauge\". When this is full, a \"Unison Attack\" can be triggered, allowing the party to use techniques simultaneously on a single enemy. When certain techniques are combined, a special attack results in additional damage.\n\nAfter battle, a currency called Grade is awarded or subtracted based on specific criteria that are fulfilled in battle. It is used to purchase bonuses during New Game Plus. Players are also prompted to cook food after battles if they have the materials. Cooking recipes determine the benefits received such as health recovery. The degree of the benefit is determined by which character is chosen to cook.\n\n\"Tales of Symphonia\"s skill system is built around the use of \"EX Gems\", which come in four ranks. Each character can equip up to four EX Gems and set abilities to those gems. The abilities determine if the characters will learn Strike or Technical techniques and spells. Combinations of EX Gem abilities can also grant additional abilities called \"EX-Skills\". The development of a character's attributes is determined by their equipped \"Title\". Titles are earned through story progression, side quests, or completion of miscellaneous criteria.\n\nLloyd Irving and his friend, Genis Sage accompany the chosen, Colette Brunel and her guardians, Raine Sage and Kratos Aurion on her journey of world regeneration. The purpose of the journey is to replenish Sylvarant with mana, a necessary energy to their survival. The path of the journey consists of five temples which must be unsealed by Colette. On their journey, they meet Sheena Fujibayashi who comes from Tethe'alla, a world parallel to Sylvarant. She tells them about how the two worlds vie for each other's mana through the journey of regeneration. Hoping to find answers from the angel Remiel, the party meets him at the final seal and are betrayed by Remiel and Kratos; both are revealed to be part of Cruxis, an evil organization led by Mithos Yggdrasill.\n\nThe party leaves for Tethe'alla to search for a way to save both worlds and are joined by Zelos Wilder, Presea Combatir, and Regal Bryant. The party learns that awakening the Summon Spirits in both worlds will sever the mana tie between them. Believing that to be the answer, they successfully sever all mana ties between the two worlds. Their actions instead destabilize the Great Seed, the supplier of mana to both worlds, causing it to grow and engulf Sylvarant at an exponential rate. After the party re-stabilizes the seed, they learn from Yuan Ka-Fai about the origins of Sylvarant and Tethe'alla and how they used to be one world but was split by Mithos with the Eternal Sword; the party realizes they can save the world if they wield the Eternal Sword, merge the worlds, and germinate the Great Seed. They decide to confront and defeat Mithos before seeking the Eternal Sword.\n\nKratos is revealed to have been gathering materials to have Lloyd use the Eternal Sword. He succeeds but Mithos survives his apparent death and possesses a member from the party before fleeing to the comet Derris-Kharlan. Mithos attempts to take the Great Seed with him but is foiled and killed by Lloyd. Using the Eternal Sword, Lloyd merges Sylvarant and Tethe'alla together and germinates the Great Seed into a Giant Kharlan Tree to supply the world with mana.\n\nThe game was first announced on May 8, 2002 by Namco to be one of the many titles it would be releasing on the Nintendo GameCube. Namco stated it would be a part of the \"Tales of Phantasia\" series and expected comics, animation, drama CDs and novels to be spun off from the game. Its name was revealed to be \"Tales of Symphonia\" in February 2003. An April 2003 edition of \"Famitsu\" revealed the game has been in development for two years, its developers are the same from \"Tales of Eternia\", the game will have the most main characters in the \"Tales\" series, and will be the first 3D game in the series. During Electronic Entertainment Expo 2003, a North American localization was confirmed. A conference by Namco on June 9, 2003 revealed the game will be on two disks and its theme song will be \"Starry Heavens\" by Day After Tomorrow. To celebrate its release in Japan, the game was bundled with a symphonic green Nintendo GameCube. For the North American version, the localization producer replaced Starry Heavens with an orchestral anthem and focused on hiring professional voice actors to dub the game in order to appeal to the Western audience. The game was released in Japan on August 29, 2003 and was localized in North America and Europe on July 13, 2004 and November 19, 2004 respectively. The game was re-released in North America under the Player's Choice label on July 19, 2004.\n\nDuring the second week of April 2004, \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\" announced a PlayStation 2 port of \"Tales of Symphonia\". It received new in-game additions and its theme song is by Day After Tomorrow. It was released exclusively in Japan on September 22, 2004 and re-released under the PlayStation 2 the Best label on July 7, 2005.\n\nTakumi Miyajima, the game's writer, explained \"Tales of Symphonia\" was planned to create a \"unique symphonia\", dependent on the player's choices and the affection system. Miyajima wrote many scenarios, with the most significant events centered on Zelos Wilder. Originally, Zelos' death was supposed to be canon. His survival would have been dependent on the affection system: He would die early on if he was ranked the lowest in the affection system, would die at the end if he ranked in the middle, and would only survive if he ranked the top. However, the development staff suggested to have Kratos Aurion return to the party and the team discussed how it would work. The change in scenario had Miyajima rework Zelos' death into a non-canon path of the story. While generally a self-contained story, \"Symphonia\" apparently takes place within either the same or a similar timeline to the first \"Tales\" game, \"Tales of Phantasia\".\n\nThe sequel , localized in English as \"\", was announced on July 20, 2007 for the Wii. It was released in Japan and North America in 2008 and in Europe a year after.\n\n\"Tales of Symphonia Chronicles\" was announced on June 1, 2013 for the PlayStation 3.

It was released in Japan on October 10, 2013, and it was released in North America and Europe on February 2014 as both a retail version and download release, with the option to purchase \"Tales of Symphonia\" as a standalone release.\n\n\"Tales of Symphonia\" spawned seven manga adaptations after its release: six anthology collections and a traditional manga series.\n\nThe first anthology collection, , consists of five volumes which were released between November 25, 2003 and February 25, 2006 by Ichijinsha.

Six volumes were released: the first was released on August 10, 2005 and the last two were released on July 10, 2007.\n\n\"Tales of Symphonia\" has spun off two novel series adaptions, four strategy guides, a character book, an official scenario book, and an art book.

Although \"Pelopidas\" won the prize, it was not produced or published until 1919, possibly because Pelopidas does not dominate the action of his play in the way Metamora managed and therefore failed to show off Forrest's abilities adequately. However, Forrest found it well written and encouraged a second submission by Bird. The following year, Bird won Forrest's prize a second time with that play that would become his most impactful, \"The Gladiator\". Bird's brother Henry, in a letter advised Robert to continue with \"The Gladiator\" as Spartacus was \"altogether more suited to Forrest's Roman figure & actions.\" In fact, it turned out to be the perfect vehicle to showcase Forrest’s “muscular acting style” . Thanks to \"The Gladiator\", Forrest became “the most famous American actor of his day”.\n\n\n\"The Gladiator\" tells the story of a man yearning to live freely and removed from the oppression of totalitarian masters. Spartacus is a gladiator who initially refuses to fight because he will not “slay a man for the diversion of Romans”.\n\nThe play opens with Phasarius, a Thracian slave and other gladiators decrying the position of Rome and considering a revolt against the state left vulnerable by its colonizing and war-mongering generals. However, upon heading from his lanista, Bracchius, that a newly captured Thracian gladiator is an even better fighter than himself, Phasarius resolves to postpone his plans for coup. This newly captured slave is Spartacus, who agrees to battle so that he may free his also captured wife and child. He barters his services, “I will serve you Better than slave e'er served”, in exchange for his family, “Keep us together”. Upon meeting each other in the arena of the amphitheater, however, Phasarius and Spartacus recognize each other as brothers, refuse to fight and incite their fellow gladiators to revolt. They proclaim, “Death to the Roman fiends, that make their mirth Out of the groans of bleeding misery! Ho, slaves, arise! it is your hour to kill! Kill and spare not -For wrath and liberty!-” \n\n\"The Gladiator\" premiered at New York's Park Theatre on September 26, 1831. Although the weather on opening night was poor, the actors in secondary roles of questionable distinction and the sets and costumes \"wretchedly bad,\" the play was a massive success and was received with increasing enthusiasm each of the four nights it played. This original production was noted for the play's climatic Act Two in which Spartacus and Pharsarius refuse to slaughter each other. This scene was staged in a spectacular way, the likes of which had not yet been seen that century.\n\nAfter such success in New York, the production moved to Philadelphia, where it was first produced on October 24 and Boston, where the play was seen in November.\n\n\"The Gladiator\" was such a success for Forrest that he opened with it when he traveled to London in 1836. Although Forrest was a success at the Drury Lane Theatre on October 17 with \"The Gladiator\", the audience demonstrated their desire to see Shakespeare as \"The Gladiator\" was seen by many in the audience as anti-British.\n\nAlthough \"The Gladiator\" remained a central part of Forrest's repertoire, as with many pre-Civil War plays, it eventually fell out of favor as naturalism and \"realistic representation\" became more popular.\n\nEven though Bird’s work helped secure Forrest prominence, their partnership ended when Forrest failed to compensate Bird as they had originally agreed. In fact, Forrest’s “poor treatment led Bird to become a novelist”. Notwithstanding the dissolution of their partnership, Forrest produced and starred in \"The Gladiator\" over 1000 times.\n\nThe social relevance of \"The Gladiator\" is unquestionable. Spartacus is the “underdog who through thirst for individual freedom and love of family risks all in taking on a tyrannical government”. Certainly, 19th century American theater patrons could identify to this as the young country was still figuring out how to live up to the “promises of the Revolution”. But the impact reached far beyond the confines of mainstream American theater goers. Dealing with slave insurgency in Ancient Rome, \"The Gladiator\" implicitly attacks the institution of Slavery in the United States by “transforming the Antebellum into neoclassical rebels”. Spartacus was born free just like the first generation of slaves in America and he valued that freedom above anything but family. Unquestionably, the play deals with many of the issues faced by the African slaves of the time including the inevitable shattering of family units resulting from individual slave sales. Spartacus’ yearning for his wife and son mirrored the plight of many slaves with family members scattered across multiple households or plantations. Although Spartacus finds himself “removed from anything like liberty and dignity”, he manages to rise from the “lowest of the low to become an inspiring role model who comes close to achieving freedom for himself and others”.\n\nBird's opinion on Slavery in the United States is often questioned in regards to \"The Gladiator\". The play was written in a time of great abolitionist activity: William Lloyd Garrison founded The Liberator, an influential anti-slavery newspaper, the same year as Bird wrote his play. Thus the timing of the first performance of \"The Gladiator\" was impeccable with it coinciding with the inception of The Liberator. It almost seemed to predict the slave uprising led by Nat Turner in Virginia which resulted in the deaths of many whites until Turner and his men were captured and executed.\n\nIn his appraisal of the work, Whitman insists that, \"this play is as full of 'Abolitionism' as an egg is of meat.\"\nHe called \"The Gladiator\" a calculated play to “make the heart of the masses well responsive to all those noble aspirations on behalf of mortal freedom”. Clearly, Whitman had no doubt of the play’s abolitionist undertones. Jenna Gibbs states that Bird “used the story to denounce black slavery” and adds that, “Bird noted that his intention was an impassionate and strong dialogue about slavery”. Richards was also convinced of Bird’s anti-slavery agenda stating, “\"The Gladiator\" seems intent in reminding audiences that it enacts a slave revolt”.\n\nYet later scholars have dissented from Whitman's surety. Though some still debate that it is not clear that he intentionally conceived \"The Gladiator\" as an abolitionist play, everyone agrees that he was fully aware of its incendiary potential in the South. \nCertainly, Bird did not want his play to be \"damned\" in the south. And while Bird himself was worried that, \"The Gladiator\" produced in a Slave state would lead to, \"the managers, players, and perhaps myself ... rewarded with the Penitentiary,\" he also differentiated between \"nobel\" Thracian rebels and \"violent\" African American slaves. Writing in his journal of the Nat Turner slave rebellion, Bird remarks, \"if they had had a Spartacus among them to organize the half million of Virginia, the hundreds of thousands of the [other] states, and lead them on in the Crusade of Massacre, what a blessed example might they not give the world of the excellence of slavery.\"\n\nRegardless of Bird’s intention, the truth is that the play’s setting could be easily changed from Rome to a Southern plantation without need to modify much else.\n\nFrom the very first performance in New York City the play was a major success, both commercially and critically. Mr. Forrest’s Spartacus was deemed “the perfection of the art histrionic” and “one of the gems that shone upon the stage”. Amongst other praise accorded \"The Gladiator\", it was called \"the best native tragedy extant,\" \"decidedly the best drama ever written in this century\" with \"the stamp of genius in every lineament.\" The prominent Philadelphia critic, Wemyss called the play, upon its opening in that city, \"the perfection of melodramatic tragedy.\" The play was indeed a huge success in Philadelphia as well as Boston and other cities in the Northeastern United States. Writing in \"The Brooklyn Eagle\" in late 1846, Walt Whitman also discusses Forrest's talent, citing the actor as \"a deserved favorite with the public.\"\n\nWhile the relationship between \"The Gladiator\" and its playwright to slavery is much debated (see above), the play is often seen as the pinnacle of romanticism in American drama. Written only a few years following the inauguration of Andrew Jackson, the play is Anti-imperial and anti-British where distant colonies are persecuted while ancient lineages reign dominant over \"the new blood of the poor,\" a common theme in Jacksonian political rhetoric.\n\n\"The Gladiator\" played successfully across the country for 70 years. A marker of its enormous success may be seen in how many performances were produced: by 1854, \"The Gladiator\" had been performed over 1000 times, a remarkable feat. It was considered to be the first time a play had reached such a threshold in the playwright's lifetime. Forrest retained the play in his repertoire until his death, and it was eventually taken up by John Edward McCullough and Robert Downing.\n\n\"The Gladiator\"’s legacy was a success from its very first performance. Its theatrical acclaim can be attributed to the appeal of its star, Edwin Forrest, in conjunction with the story of the oppressed seeking freedom from despotism. The story not only capitalized on the success of the American Revolution but it fed from the cultural and societal mood of the time. By subtly tying the story of Roman slavery to that of African American slaves, Bird created a framework through which he could express his human equality views. As a result, \"The Gladiator\" became a cornerstone of American dramaturgy awarding Bird his righteous place as one of the most acclaimed playwrights of the early 19th century. Having been performed over 1000 times, \"The Gladiator\"’s longevity attests to the universality of its central story touching on themes ranging from freedom and family to the sacrifice sometimes required to achieve societal rather than individual goals.\n\nNot only is the story of \"The Gladiator\" a universally appealing tale, but Forrest’s foresight in having such a play custom fitted to his ability is also an important aspect of the legacy of this work. In fact, \"The Gladiator’\"s \"Spartacus was perfectly conceived to meet the actor’s strengths\" and completely suited to \"Forrest’s Roman figure and actions\". Spartacus is \"loud, dynamic, and anti-aristocratic\" which perfectly suited Forrest’s image. With Forrest talents and physical abilities determining the course of the play, it is one of the first instances where a particular actor’s skills and physique dictate the tone and content of a theatrical offering. Today, theatrical vehicles are often created to fit the needs and desires of many superstars and even up- and comers who are believed to be worth the time and financial investment.\n\nPublished during the \"Golden Era of the American Stage\", \"The Gladiator\" stands as one of the first epics written by an American author. As a theatrical piece, its impact in the American entertainment industry is irrefutable. Bird’s play, with its critical and financial success, demonstrated the potential of ancient history as fodder for entertainment. It can be considered a precursor to the many works inspired or set during the Roman Empire that are found in contemporary literature and portrayed in the theatre, television shows, and feature films. For example, Broadway's Her First Roman and Pippin are based on Roman Empire characters though gladiators are not central to the stories. Gladiators do abound in television and film. Spartacus’ story has been told by at least one long running television series and a 2004 made for TV movie starring Goran Visnjic. On the big screen, Howard Fast’s novel Spartacus was adapted into film in 1960 starring Kirk Douglas and it is considered a classic. Just like Bird’s play, Fast’s novel has social relevance in that it reflects the fight for the “political empowerment of the working class” (Joshel et. al. 91). Perhaps the most successful Roman Empire movie is the 2000 film Gladiator starring Russell Crowe. Though not directly based on Bird’s work, the influence of \"The Gladiator\" is evident throughout Crowe’s film. Although the story is different, the heroic central figure, Maximus, is uncannily similar to Spartacus including the yearning for family, his failed attempt at escaping Roman rule, and his untimely sacrificial death. It is important to note that, just like Forrest, the actors in both of the films mentioned had input regarding the content of the films and used them as career building vehicles.\n\n"}

Early users of the phrase include Sir Walter Scott in his 1828 \"The Fair Maid of Perth\".\n\nThe physical act of putting one's tongue into one's cheek once signified contempt. For example, in Tobias Smollett's \"The Adventures of Roderick Random,\" which was published in 1748, the eponymous hero takes a coach to Bath, and on the way, apprehends a highwayman. This provokes an altercation with a less brave passenger:\nThe phrase appears in 1828 in \"The Fair Maid of Perth\" by Sir Walter Scott: \nIt's not clear how Scott intended readers to understand the phrase. The more modern ironic sense appears in the 1842 poem \"The Ingoldsby Legends\" by the English clergyman Richard Barham, in which a Frenchman inspects a watch and cries:\nThe ironic usage originates with the idea of suppressed mirth—biting one's tongue to prevent an outburst of laughter.\n\n"}
{"id": "146996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=146996", "title": "Tournament", "text": "Tournament\n\nA tournament is a competition involving a relatively large number of competitors, all participating in a sport or game. More specifically, the term may be used in either of two overlapping senses:\n\nThese two senses are distinct. All golf tournaments meet the first definition, but while match play tournaments meet the second, stroke play tournaments do not, since there are no distinct matches within the tournament. In contrast, association football leagues like the Premier League are tournaments in the second sense, but not the first, having matches spread across many stadia over a period of up to a season. Many tournaments meet both definitions; for example, the Wimbledon tennis championship. Tournaments \"are temporally demarcated events, participation in which confers levels of status and prestige amongst all participating members\".\n\nA tournament-match (or tie or fixture or heat) may involve multiple game-matches (or rubbers or legs) between the competitors. For example, in the Davis Cup tennis tournament, a tie between two nations involves five rubbers between the nations' players. The team that wins the most rubbers wins the tie. In the later rounds of UEFA Champions League , each fixture is played over two legs. The scores of each leg are added, and the team with the higher aggregate score wins the fixture, with away goals used as a tiebreaker and a penalty shoot out if away goals cannot determine a winner of the game.\n\nA knockout tournament or elimination tournament is divided into successive rounds; each competitor plays in at least one fixture per round. The top-ranked competitors in each fixture progress to the next round. As rounds progress, the number of competitors and fixtures decreases. The final round, usually known as the final or cup final, consists of just one fixture; the winner of which is the overall champion.\n\nIn a single-elimination tournament, only the top-ranked competitors in a fixture progress; in 2-competitor games, only the winner progresses. All other competitors are eliminated. This ensures a winner is decided with the minimum number of fixtures. However, most competitors will be eliminated after relatively few matches; a single bad or unlucky performance can nullify many preceding excellent ones.\n\nA double-elimination tournament may be used in 2-competitor games to allow each competitor a single loss without being eliminated from the tournament. All losers from the main bracket enter a losers' bracket, the winner of which plays off against the main bracket's winner.\n\nA triple elimination tournament allows a competitor to lose two games, and creates a third bracket or fourth bracket, and are usually followed by a playoff. It is usually used in curling tournaments. \n\nSome elimination tournaments are in a best-of-\"x\" series, allowing a competitor to lose at most four times (to the same competitor) before being eliminated.\n\nSome formats use a repechage, allowing losers to play extra rounds before re-entering the main competition in a later round. Rowing regattas often have repechage rounds for the \"fastest losers\" from the heats. The winners of these progress, but are at a disadvantage in later rounds owing to the extra effort expended during the repechage.\n\nA family of tournament systems that grew from a system devised for the Victorian Football League, the historic predecessor to the Australian Football League (AFL), allow the teams with the best record before the playoffs to lose a game without being eliminated, whereas lesser qualifiers are not. Several of the most prominent leagues in Australia use such a system, such as the AFL and the National Rugby League in rugby league. The A-League of association football also used such a system through its 2011–12 season, but now uses a pure knockout playoff. Similar systems are used in cricket's Indian Premier League and most curling tournaments, and were also used by the Super League of European rugby league before being scrapped after the 2014 season.\n\nIn athletics meetings, fastest losers may progress in a running event held over several rounds; e.g. the qualifiers for a later round might be the first 4 from each of 6 heats, plus the 8 fastest losers from among the remaining runners.\n\nAn extreme form of the knockout tournament is the stepladder format where the strongest team (or individual, depending on the sport) is assured of a berth at the final round while the next strongest teams are given byes according to their strength/seeds; for example, in a four team tournament, the fourth and third seed figure in the first round, then the winner goes to the semifinals against the second seed, while the survivor faces the first seed at the final. Four American sports organizations either currently use this format, or have in the past:\n\nA group tournament, league, division or conference involves all competitors playing a number of \"fixtures\" (again, a fixture is one name for a tournament-match that determines who, out of two or three or more, will advance; a fixture may consist of one or more game-matches between competitors). Points are awarded for each fixture, with competitors ranked based either on total number of points or average points per fixture. Usually each competitor plays an equal number of fixtures, in which case rankings by total points and by average points are equivalent. The English County Championship in cricket did not require an equal number of matches prior to 1963.\n\nIn a round-robin tournament, each competitor plays all the others an equal number of times, once in a single round-robin tournament and twice in a double round-robin tournament. This is often seen as producing the most reliable rankings. However, for large numbers of competitors it may require an unfeasibly large number of rounds. A Swiss system tournament attempts to determine a winner reliably, based on a smaller number of fixtures. Fixtures are scheduled one round at a time; a competitor will play another who has a similar record in previous rounds of the tournament. This allows the top (and bottom) competitors to be determined with fewer rounds than a round-robin, though the middle rankings are unreliable.\n\nThere may be other considerations besides reliability of rankings. In some professional team sports, weaker teams are given an easier slate of fixtures as a form of handicapping. Sometimes schedules are weighted in favour of local derbies or other traditional rivalries. For example, NFL teams play two games against each of the other three teams in their division, one game against half of the other twelve teams in their conference, and one game against a quarter of the sixteen teams in the other conference.\n\nAmerican sports are also unusual in providing fixtures between competitors who are, for ranking purposes, in different groups. Another, systematic, example of this was the 2006 Women's Rugby World Cup: each of the teams in Group A played each of the teams in Group B, with the groups ranked separately based on the results. (Groups C and D intertwined similarly.) An elaboration of this system is the Mitchell movement in duplicate bridge, discussed below, where North-South pairs play East-West pairs.\nIn 2-competitor games where ties are rare or impossible, competitors are typically ranked by number of wins, with ties counting half; each competitors' listings are usually ordered Wins–Losses(–Ties). Where ties are more common, this may be 2 points for a win and 1 for a tie, which is mathematically equivalent but avoids having too many half-points in the listings. These are usually ordered Wins–Ties–Losses. If there are more than two competitors per fixture, points may be ordinal (for example, 3 for first, 2 for second, 1 for third).\n\nMany tournaments are held in multiple stages, with the top teams in one stage progressing to the next. American professional team sports have a \"regular season\" (group tournament) acting as qualification for the \"post season\" or \"playoffs\" (single-elimination tournament). A group stage (also known as pool play or the pool stage) is a round-robin stage in a multi-stage tournament. The competitors are divided into multiple groups, which play separate round-robins in parallel. Measured by a points-based ranking system, the top competitors in each group qualify for the next stage. In most editions of the FIFA World Cup finals tournament, the first round has been a group stage with groups of four teams, the top two qualifying for the \"knockout stage\" played as a single-elimination tournament. This format is common in many international team events, such as World Cups or Olympic tournaments. Some tournaments have two group stages, for example the 1982 FIFA World Cup or the 1999–2000 UEFA Champions League. As well as a fixed number of qualifiers from each group, some may be determined by comparing between different groups: at the 1986 FIFA World Cup the best four of six third-place sides qualified; at the 1999 Rugby World Cup the best one of five third-place sides did so.\n\nSometimes, results from an earlier phase are carried over into a later phase. In the Cricket World Cup, the second stage, known as the Super Eight since 2007 and before that the Super Six, features two teams from each of four preliminary groups (previously three teams from two preliminary groups), who do not replay the teams they have already played, but instead reuse the original results in the new league table. Formerly in the Swiss Football League, teams played a double round-robin, at which point they were split into a top \"championship\" group and a bottom \"relegation\" group; each played a separate double round-robin, with results of all 32 matches counting for ranking each group. A similar system is also used by the Scottish Premiership and its historic predecessor, the Scottish Premier League, since 2000. After 33 games, when every club has played every other club three times, the division is split into two halves. Clubs play a further 5 matches, against the teams in their half of the division. This can (and often does) result in the team placed 7th having a higher points total than the team placed 6th (because their final 5 games are considerably easier), nevertheless, a team in the bottom half never receives a higher final ranking than a team which qualified for the top half.\n\nA multi-stage pool system was implemented by Curling Canada for the Canadian championship curling tournaments (the Scotties Tournament of Hearts for women and the Tim Hortons Brier for men) starting in 2018. The change was intended to allow the expansion of the main stage of the tournament from twelve to sixteen teams while keeping the round robin at eleven games. The teams are seeded using a ranking system in which points are calculated based on the teams' results in all competitive bonspiels using a complicated formula. Seeds 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13 and 16 and placed in Pool A while seeds 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14 and 15 are placed in Pool B. After each team has played seven games, the top four teams from each pool advance to the \"Championship Pool.\" Carrying over their entire round robin records with them, Championship Pool teams play one game against each of the four teams in the opposite pool, with the top four teams qualifying for the page playoffs. In contrast, teams that fail to qualify for the Championship Pool play only one additional \"Placement Round\" game against the team that finished in the same position in the opposite pool for the purposes of determining final tournament ranking. For these teams, there is little else to play for since there is no form of relegation (and, with the expansion of the field to sixteen teams, no \"Pre-Qualifying Tournament\") and seeding is based solely on the performances of the participating teams and not the past results of the provinces and territories they represent.\n\nThe top Slovenian basketball league has a unique system. In its first phase, 12 of the league's 13 clubs compete in a full home-and-away season, with the country's representative in the Euroleague (an elite pan-European club competition) exempt. The league then splits. The top seven teams are joined by the Euroleague representative for a second home-and-away season, with no results carrying over from the first phase. These eight teams compete for four spots in a final playoff. The bottom five teams play their own home-and-away league, but their previous results \"do\" carry over. These teams are competing to avoid relegation, with the bottom team automatically relegated and the second-from-bottom team forced to play a mini-league with the second- and third-place teams from the second level for a place in the top league.\n\nWhere the number of competitors is larger than a tournament format permits, there may be multiple tournaments held in parallel, with competitors assigned to a particular tournament based on their ranking. In chess, Scrabble, and many other individual games, many tournaments over one or more years contribute to a player's ranking. However, many team sports involve teams in only one major tournament per year. In European sport, including football, this constitutes the sole ranking for the following season; the top teams from each division of the league are promoted to a higher division, while the bottom teams from a higher division are relegated to a lower one.\n\nThis promotion and relegation occurs mainly in league tournaments, but also features in Davis Cup and Fed Cup tennis:\n\nThe hierarchy of divisions may be linear, or tree-like, as with the English football league pyramid.\n\nIn contract bridge a \"tournament\" is a tournament in the first sense above, composed of multiple \"events\", which are tournaments in the second sense. Some events may be single-elimination, double-elimination, or Swiss style. However, \"Pair events\" are the most widespread. In these events, a number of deals (or \"boards\") are each played several times by different players. For each such board the score achieved by each North-South (NS) pair is then measured against all the other NS pairs playing the same board. Thus pairs are rewarded for playing the same cards better than others have played them. There is a predetermined schedule of fixtures depending on the number of pairs and boards to be played, to ensure a good mix of opponents, and that no pair plays the same board or the same opponents twice (see duplicate bridge movements).\n\nIn poker tournaments, as players are eliminated, the number of tables is gradually reduced, with the remaining players redistributed among the remaining tables. Play continues until one player has won all of the chips in play. Finishing order is determined by the order in which players are eliminated: last player remaining gets 1st place, last player eliminated gets 2nd, previous player eliminated gets 3rd, etc.\n\nIn a \"shootout\" tournament, players do not change tables until every table has been reduced to one player.\n\nWhile tournament structures attempt to provide an objective format for determining the best competitor in a game or sport, other methods exist.\n\n\n\n\nTournaments of value have come to legitimise what are often seen as marginalised practices that sit outside of popular culture. For example, the Grammy Award ceremony helped to shape country music as a viable commercial field, and Booker Prize ceremony helped to create new fields of literary fiction. Tournaments of value go beyond game show and simple contests as the journey itself emerges as being more significant, bestowing status and prestige on the winner and, in the process, shaping industry practices and acting as institutional mechanisms for shaping social fields. \n\n"}
{"id": "304076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=304076", "title": "Trans Canada Trail", "text": "Trans Canada Trail\n\nThe Great Trail, formerly known as Trans Canada Trail, is a cross-Canada system of greenways, waterways and roadways that stretches from the Atlantic to the Pacific to the Arctic oceans. The Trail extends over 24,000 kilometres (15,000 miles); it is now the longest recreational, multi-use trail network in the world. The idea for the Trail began in 1992, shortly after the Canada 125 celebrations. Since then it has been supported by donations from individuals, corporations, foundations and all levels of government. \n\nTrans Canada Trail (TCT) is the name of the non-profit group that raises funds for the continued development of the Trail. However, the Trail is owned and operated at the local level. \n\nOn August 26, 2017, TCT celebrated the connection of the Trail with numerous events held throughout Canada. TCT has said it now plans to make the Trail more accessible, replace interim roadways with off-road greenways, add new spurs and loops to the Trail and fund emergency repairs when needed. \n\nThe creation of the Trail was born of Canada's 125th anniversary celebrations in 1992. It has its counterparts in such other greenway routes as the 12 EuroVelo routes, the UK's National Cycle Network, and the United States Numbered Bicycle Routes network.\n\nIt has been funded largely by Canadian federal and provincial governments, with significant contributions from corporate and individual donors. The first province to have completed its designated section of the trail was Prince Edward Island (see Confederation Trail).\n\nThe network of the Trans Canada Trail is made up of more than 400 community trails. Each trail section is developed, owned and managed locally by Trail groups, conservation authorities and by municipal, provincial and federal governments, for instance in parks such as Gatineau Park or along existing trails such as the Cataraqui Trail and Voyageur Hiking Trail. The Trans Canada Trail supports the construction and use of greenways to replace roadways.\n\nMoreover, considerable parts of the Trail are repurposed defunct rail lines donated to provincial governments by Canadian Pacific and Canadian National Railway railbeds rebuilt as walking trails. As such, much of the Trans Canada Trail development emulated the successful Rails-to-Trails initiative in the United States, whereby these transportation corridors are \"rail banked\" as recreational trails, allowing conversion back to rail should future need arise.\n\nThousands of Canadians, community partner organizations, corporations, local businesses and all levels of government are involved in developing and maintaining these trails. TCT does not own or operate any section of The Great Trail. As an ensemble, The Great Trail might be one of the largest volunteer projects ever undertaken in Canada.\n\nThe main section runs along the southern areas of Canada connecting most of Canada's major cities and most populous areas. There is also a long northern arm which runs through Alberta to Edmonton and then up through northern British Columbia to Yukon.\n\nThe Trail is multi-use and depending on the section may allow hikers, bicyclists, horseback riders, cross country skiers and snowmobilers. In theory, the Trail is equipped with regularly spaced pavilions that provide shelter as well as fresh water to travellers, but this varies widely from section to section, and particularly from province to province.\n\n\"Mile zero\" of the Trail is located outside the Railway Coastal Museum in St. John's, Newfoundland.\n\nWhile the Trail is connected, TCT have said they will continue to fundraise for the future development and enhancement of the Trail. Among its objectives, TCT says it plans to replace interim roadways with off-road greenways, where possible, to make it safer and more accessible for all users, to add new Trail sections, and to provide emergency funding for Trail sections damaged by natural disasters, etc. \n\nThe Trail is not owned or operated by TCT, but the organization provides support to local partners and volunteer groups who maintain individual sections.\n\nAs of May, 2017, \"Kilometre 0\" begins at Cape Spear, the most easterly point in North America. Here it is known as the East Coast Trail, a series of rugged coastal wilderness paths. The route follows the coastline north around St. John's Bay and Freshwater Bay, connecting with the Grand Concourse walkway network at Fort Amherst. The route then follows a sidewalkway along Southside Road adjacent to St. John's Harbour until the former Trail Eastern Terminus located at the Railway Coastal Museum. From here It follows the former Newfoundland Railway route travelling south crossing Route 2 into Kilbride then through Bowring Park. Continuing north-west through Mount Pearl then Donovans crossing Route 1 into Paradise passing Neils Pond and Octagon Pond. The route then turns south-west in Conception Bay South and crosses Route 60 before it meets and follows the Conception Bay coastline. At Indian Pond, the Grand Concourse trail ends and the route is known as Newfoundland Trailway Park, an 883 km linear park which consists of the former railbed and which allows motorized access. \n\nThe route continues as the Newfoundland T'Railway south-west passing through the east side of Holyrood Bay. The trail passes through Briens as it enters Hollyrood. The route again crosses Route 60 then the North Arm River then travels north through Burnt Stump. The route travels south west passing Woodsford then passes through Brien's Gullies before then crossing Route 1 again. The route then passes through Brigus Junction, Mahers, then Ocean Pond then a mostly treed area before entering Whitbourne and crossing Route 80. Continuing the route crosses Route 100 then enters Placentia Junction before turning north passing over Coles Pond.

The game was a standard wartime flight simulator with the underused setting of World War I. Players assume the role of a Royal Air Force pilot fighting the Luftstreitkräfte in several missions. Despite its setting, the game still features an arcade style to it: the planes never stalled and the planes could be equipped with air-to-air rockets.\n\nAfter players created a profile, the game offered numerous options and game play modes including Campaign and Instant Action. During the Campaign mode, players could not only pilot single fighter planes but could also jump into bombers and recon planes as well as inside the seat of tail-mounted machine guns during missions. Players could also fight with rival pilots, partake in bonus missions and collect bonus icons to increase their score although some missions were timed.\n\nThe game received \"mixed or average reviews\" on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n"}
