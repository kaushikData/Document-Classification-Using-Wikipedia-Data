The charity creates resources, assists individuals in getting the peripherals they need, runs scholarships, and works with video game publishers and video game companies to improve accessibility.\n\nAbleGamers was founded by Mark Barlet and Stephanie Walker in 2004 after Walker discovered that her Multiple sclerosis was stopping her being able to properly control a computer mouse to play video games. The charity works with individuals to assess their needs and challenges, determining what equipment they need to help them play video games - including both existing and new, custom-made, hardware. This includes both online consultations and visits to the charity's facilities. The charity helps up to 300 people every year through direct support, and more through online resources. While the program was initially opened for applications only at certain times of the year, it began being offered year-round from 2013.\n\nThe charity has opened \"Accessibility Arcade\"s in locations such as Washington, D.C.'s Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library and the University of Toronto's Semaphore Research Cluster, showcasing accessible hardware and games. In 2013 the charity topped $100,000 USD in donations.\n\nJanuary 2016 the charity announced that it was extending its mission to include a new program entitled \"Expansion Packs\". Partnering with sponsors, AbleGamers is building accessible game rooms for activity centers that support people with disabilities, the first being at the Pediatric Specialty Care in Hopewell PA.\n\nIn 2017 AbleGamers started the \"Player Panels\" initiative, whereby gamers with disabilities work with game developers to improve the accessibility of upcoming games, and participate in research studies.\n\nThe AbleGamers Foundation worked with Evil Controllers to design accessible peripherals for disabled gamers, and in 2018 it was announced that the Xbox Adaptive Controller had been created in partnership with organisations including AbleGamers.\n\nIn 2012, The AbleGamers Foundation opened \"The AbleGamers Center on Game Accessibility and Inclusive Play\" in Harpers Ferry, WV. The center offered a place for people with disabilities to experience new accessible technology as well as a maker space for custom controller design and prototyping.\n\nAbleGamers' facility includes a lifesize Songbird from BioShock Infinite donated to the charity by Irrational Games in 2014, in addition to rare items such as original Fallout concept art and signed games.\n\nAbleGamers expanded to a new facility, The AbleGamers Center for Inclusive Play, in Charles Town, West Virginia in 2017. The building was previously a US Coast guard facility, and includes space to hold consultations, demonstrations, and has a 3D printing studio for manufacturing of specialized equipment. It was funded by a grant from Level Access. The new facility is a much larger space with more room for AbleGamers to create and display hardware, now has a dedicated streaming room, and had many features - such as wide doors - which made it beneficial for supporting disabled guests. AbleGamers would like to have facilities in more locations around the United States in the future.\n\nMark Barlet, president AbleGamers received the 2012 American Association of People with Disabilities Hearne Leadership Award for his work at AbleGamers.\n\nIn 2013, AbleGamers won an MS Society Da Vinci Award for their document \"Includification: A Practical Guide to Game Accessibility\", the first time the award had been given to a document and concept, not a product.\n\nThe foundation distributes its own awards each year to the most accessible games released that year, with winners including FIFA 13 and Bayonetta 2. The awards are given to games with customisable control schemes and colors, optional or minimal quick time events, and unique features such as Bayonetta 2's one-button combat mode.\n\n"}

{"id": "12962214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12962214", "title": "Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (video game)", "text": "Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (video game)\n\nAliens vs. Predator: Requiem is an action game exclusive to the PlayStation Portable, developed by Rebellion Developments and published by Vivendi Games. It was released in November 2007 in North America and Europe, and December 2007 in Australia. It is part of the \"Alien vs. Predator\" franchise, an amalgamation of the \"Alien\" and \"Predator\" franchises. \"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem\" is a tie-in to the , which was released shortly after the game.\n\nThe game's plot is loosely based on the film, as players take the role of the film's primary Predator. After the events of the first film of the \"Alien vs. Predator\" franchise, the Predator has been charged by his society to hunt down and destroy any trace of Alien activity taking place in a small American town, in order to avoid its detection by humanity.\n\nThe game received negative reviews from critics and was described as another entry in a long line of poorly developed movie tie-ins. Reviewers enjoyed the opportunity to play as a Predator, but complained that the game was too easy and not rewarding, particularly the simple artificial intelligence of enemies. The visuals and audio of the game were also considered of poor quality.\n\n\"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem\" is a third-person action-adventure game. The single-player campaign is composed of 15 missions and features the Predator from the film. The player has access to Predator weapons as seen in movies and other sources in the franchise, including claws and a shoulder-mounted energy cannon. New weapons from the corresponding film include an energy pistol.\n\nThe player character also has stealth camouflage and several vision modes that allow him to see in the dark, such as infrared vision. Health is represented by a segmented life bar that regenerates after a successful kill, and an energy bar is also available to provide power for the Predator's weapons. In addition to destroying Aliens, the Predator must eradicate other traces of their presence, including facehugger husks. Aliens, husks, humans, and other potential targets are all represented by icons on a heads-up display. The game's camera is manipulated by pressing the PlayStation Portable (PSP)'s triggers, and the Predator can \"lock on\" to opponents using a first-person view to target them with his ranged weapons.\n\n\"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem\" uses a system of \"honor points\" to award points to players for actions considered honorable for Predators. For instance, \"tagging\" an enemy in first-person mode before killing it adds points, while killing humans reduces points. Honor points are used at the end of each mission to upgrade the Predator's weapons and equipment. In addition to the campaign, a single-player mode called \"Skirmish\" is available, in which players have five minutes to dispose of as many Aliens as possible in one of the game's maps. Skirmish can also be played in a cooperative setting with one other player using the PSP's \"ad-hoc\" local wireless mode.\n\nThe protagonist predator has come to Earth in response to a distress signal from a comrade's ship. Upon his arrival in the small Colorado town of Gunnison, he learns that Aliens have begun terrorizing the local populace. His mission is to destroy the Aliens and remove any trace of their activity. After reaching his comrades' ship and erasing its traces from Earth, the Predator's only mission is to exterminate all Aliens in the vicinity.\n\nThe Predator travels through rural and urban areas of Gunnison, fighting more Aliens along the way, and occasionally being harassed by human soldiers and civilians. Finally, the main Alien lair is found in a hospital, where several mines are set by the Predator to bring the Hive down. The game concludes with the final fight against an attacking helicopter and the hospital's destruction. Suddenly, the Alien Queen is seen appearing out of the hospital's rubble, only to be destroyed, along with the entire town, by a nuclear warhead, while the Predator successfully leaves Earth.\n\n\"Alien vs. Predator\" began as a franchise in February 1990, when Dark Horse Comics published a comic book featuring Aliens from the \"Alien\" series of films in battle against the title characters of \"Predator\". Both franchises are owned by Twentieth Century Fox. In November 1990, Fox released \"Predator 2\", and one of the final scenes in the film showed an Alien skull inside a trophy case aboard a Predator ship. Fox began licensing merchandise for the new franchise, including comic books and video games. In 1993, the first \"Aliens vs. Predator\" video game was released; \"Alien vs Predator\" for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.\n\nBritish independent game studio Rebellion Developments became involved with the franchise in 1994 with the release of \"Alien vs Predator\" for the Atari Jaguar, described by 1UP.com as \"probably the only good Jaguar game ever made\". Rebellion later developed an enhanced remake of the game for the PC, which was the first PC game to require a video card and went on to win a BAFTA award. The first feature film in the franchise, \"Alien vs. Predator\", was released in 2004 and did not include a tie-in video game. In August 2007, Sierra Entertainment announced that the company had partnered with Fox to produce a video game corresponding with the sequel film \"\". Rebellion was identified as the game's developer. The company, while not strictly handheld-focused, has a reputation in the industry for developing PSP games.\n\n\"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem\" was developed exclusively for the PSP. Regarding PSP exclusivity, Rebellion lead designer Tim Jones explained \"It was basically a matter of logistics. We have a strong heritage with the PSP and have done a number of successful titles such as \"\"\". Rebellion decided to forego the first-person shooter format of their earlier \"Alien vs. Predator\" games and instead focused on a third-person perspective, with the player taking the role of a lone Predator. Unlike previous Rebellion \"Alien vs. Predator\" titles, \"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem\" does not permit players to take the role of Aliens or human Marines. The company used a game engine of its own creation, and Hal Zabie, associate producer at Sierra Entertainment, said \"...the challenge was to deliver high quality graphics while not sacrificing game performance and this is something that Rebellion achieved and will be noticed by players right away.\"\n\nRebellion was given materials from the film's production, including footage and the full script, in order to recreate the feel of the film and lend authenticity to the game. The game's plot is loosely based on the film's, with the player character working to remove traces of Alien and Predator presence in a small American town. Despite similarities to the movie, the ending is different and the game does not feature the \"predalien\", a Predator-Alien hybrid introduced in \"Alien vs. Predator\". The directors of the film, the Brothers Strause, are fans of Rebellion's PC \"Aliens vs. Predator\" game and worked with the studio to develop \"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s premise. In an interview with IGN, Rebellion's Tim Jones said \"Fox is very protective of their franchise and take [sic] great care to make sure it is treated properly. We had to work within strict confines to remain consistent with the movie and everything we did had to be approved by the studio.\" The game's system of honor points was considered crucial by Rebellion, who felt that the Predators, despite being the \"bad guys\", were characterized by a strict code of honor.\nSierra described the game's development as challenging because portable consoles lack the processing power of larger machines. Rebellion complained about the PSP's lack of a second analog thumbstick, stating that it made creating a usable control scheme challenging. They also stated that because the game's protagonist preferred to work alone, \"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem\" would not contain a multiplayer cooperative mode for the single-player campaign, but a \"Survival Mode\" minigame would be available where two players could work together to fight Aliens. The game had a relatively short development cycle, and was made in less time than the movie.\n\n\"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem\" was released on November 13, 2007 in North America, over a month ahead of the film's December 25 opening. It was released on November 30 in Europe and December 6 in Australia.\n\n\"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem\" received \"generally mixed reviews\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. It was considered a poor movie tie-in, an analysis typical of such games. Reviewers specifically said the game wasn't \"bad\", just not \"good\"—IGN, for instance, said, \"\"AVP\" doesn't suck, but that isn't to say it's good.\" GameSpot's reviewer said, \"\"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem\" isn't a terrible game; it's just really mediocre.\" Eurogamer's Ellie Gibson described the game by referencing a colleague's review of \"\", a previous Rebellion PSP title, which stated \"<nowiki>[</nowiki>\"Miami Vice: The Game\" is<nowiki>]</nowiki> one of those games that's not bad, but nor is it ever that good.\" The week before the movie's release, \"Requiem\" was listed at #5 on GameFly's most-rented PSP titles list.\n\nOne critique was the game's difficulty level, which was described as too easy. Gameplanet called it \"shockingly easy\" and claimed that upgrades gained through the honor system made the protagonist invincible rather than stronger. Eurogamer noted that \"furiously button mashing\" was generally sufficient to kill most of the game's enemies.\n\nThe artificial intelligence of the game's enemies, the Aliens, was regarded as lacking, and one reviewer noted that their blood was not acidic, a defining characteristic of the creatures from the films. Several reviewers did praise the game's representation of the Predator, however, especially in the early levels.\n\nThe game's graphics and audio were not well-received, with IGN commenting, \"There's never a moment that makes you step back and say wow. The textures are muted, the Predator looks alright, but everything is pretty forgettable.\"\n\nReviewers also took the opportunity to mock the franchise itself, with Eurogamer suggesting that the series be made into a sitcom. Regarding the multiplayer, IGN's Greg Miller said, \"This mode was so boring I made up my own story. I was the Mommy Predator and Ryan from the IGN News Team was the Daddy Predator. We were protecting our children -- the cars in the large empty lot we were running around -- from the aliens.\" 1UP.com's Patrick Klepek said, \"\"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem\" fails to capitalize on its gaming heritage, instead falling prey to the same substandard licensed schlock we're used to from the films.\"\n"}
{"id": "12940451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12940451", "title": "Analytic narrative", "text": "Analytic narrative\n\nAn analytic narrative is a social science research method seeking to combine historical narratives with the rigor of rational choice theory, particularly through the use of game theory.\n\nThe goal of analytic narratives is to provide several forms of discipline on the structure of case studies, such as a game, out of sample tests, and additional predictions that can be tested even if the main assertion about the case cannot.\n\nAnalytic narratives (Bates et al. 1998, 2000; Levi 2002, 2004) involve choosing a problem or puzzle, then building a model to explicate the logic of an explanation for the puzzle or problem, often in the context of a unique case. The method involves: the use of narrative to elucidate the principal players, their preferences, the key decision points and possibilities, and the rules of game in a textured and sequenced account; and the evaluation of the model through comparative statics and the testable implications the model generates. The analytic narrative approach is most attractive to scholars who seek to evaluate the strength of parsimonious causal mechanisms in the context of a specific and often unique case. The requirement of explicit formal theorizing (or at least theory that could be formalized) compels scholars to make causal statements and to identify a small number of variables as central to understanding the case.\n\nThis approach provides two methods for establishing the generalizability of the theory. First, the model in an analytic narrative often affords a range of explanations and predictions. Although the main account of a unique case may not be testable, the model may yield other predictions that can be tested, either in this case or in other cases. Second, as with other methods, out-of-sample tests constitute an important route to generalization. The presumption today in social science research is that the authors will provide those tests themselves. However, seldom does the level of knowledge for the out of sample case rival the detailed understanding of the original case that puzzled the author. The demonstration of generalizability must rest on a larger community of scholars who take the findings applicable to one place and time to illuminate a very different place and time.\n\nBates, Robert H., Avner Greif, Margaret Levi, Jean-Laurent Rosenthal, and Barry R.

{"id": "2715761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2715761", "title": "Arx Fatalis", "text": "Arx Fatalis\n\nArx Fatalis is a role-playing video game for the Xbox and Microsoft Windows, released on 12 November 2002 by Arkane Studios, a video game developer based in Lyon, France.\n\n\"Arx Fatalis\" is played from a first-person perspective and is set on a world whose sun has failed, forcing the above-ground creatures to take refuge in subterranean caverns. One game mechanic is the use of mouse gestures to cast spells.\n\nOn 14 January 2011, Arkane Studios released a 1.21 patch and the game's source code under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL), though the game assets remain proprietary.\n\n\"Arx Fatalis\" (Latin for \"fatal fortress\") is set on a world whose sun has failed, forcing the above-ground creatures to take refuge in subterranean caverns. The action in \"Arx Fatalis\" takes place in one of these large caves, where inhabitants from all races such as Trolls, Goblins, Dwarves, Humans, etc. have made their homes on various levels of the cave. The player awakens inside a prison cell and, after making his escape, eventually discovers his mission is to subvert and imprison the God of Destruction, Akbaa, who is trying to manifest itself in Arx.\n\n\"Arx Fatalis\" has a somewhat open-ended gameplay style, allowing the player to allocate skill points for the character type such as spellcasting, weapons and armor, stealth, and so on. There are several side quests that can be undertaken. Simple crafting involves enchanting ammunition and weapons, or creating items, such as a fishing rod (fishing pole and rope), keyrings (key and ring), or pies (dough and rolling pin, optional apple and optional bottle of wine). Raw food can be cooked, like rounds of bread, chicken drumsticks, or pies. The main plotline is non-linear with the player collecting the various items to forge a sword required to defeat Akbaa in a final showdown. Additional goals come up such as dealing with the rebels of Arx, the snake women and The King of Arx. The player can resolve the conflict between them all and experience several different endings to the conflict with different consequences somewhat affecting the story.\n\nThere is no dialogue system in Arx Fatalis. Rather, the player is able to make choices through actions which lead to different consequences. There are also multiple ways to finish quests and the player can progress through the game in several different ways. For example, the player can use force to kill enemies and break down doors, or they can use stealth and avoid enemies.\n\nOne of the intuitive interfaces in Arx Fatalis is the spellcasting system. Using the mouse and the Ctrl key, runes are drawn in mid-air with mouse gestures, which must be correctly drawn, in order to successfully cast a spell. The player can find or buy different runes as gameplay progresses, combinations of which unlock new spells.\n\nThis gestural interface was simplified in the Xbox version to account for the limitations of the joypad. Each direction of the directional pad corresponds to a different mouse direction and different combinations of directions are entered with the directional pad to draw runes and correspondingly cast spells. A queue of up to 3 spells can be cast in advance, ready to be activated at the press of a button. There is also an instant magic mode that allows the player to simply select the desired spell they want to cast from a list of learned spells during gameplay.\n\nIn addition, Arx supports a stealth mode that is active when a stealth icon is visible on the interface. In stealth mode, usually when a player is in dark or shadowy areas, non-player characters cannot see them.\n\nThe design of \"Arx Fatalis\" was influenced by games from the now-defunct Looking Glass Studios, especially \"Ultima Underworld\". Arkane Studios have stated that \"Arx Fatalis\" was intended to be \"Ultima Underworld III\", however while Raphaël Colantonio had support from Paul Neurath, one of the original developers of \"Ultima Underworld\", Electronic Arts, who owned the rights, would not allow Arkane to make a sequel with their intellectual property unless he accepted some of their provisions. Colantonio refused to accept this and instead had Arkane set out on the game in the spirit of \"Ultima Underworld\". Colantonio had difficulty in getting a publisher; with finances nearly exhausted, they had signed one small publisher who had gone bankrupt within the month, but later secured JoWooD Productions for publication, eventually releasing in 2002. While the game was well received, it was considered a commercial failure.\n\n\"Arx Fatalis\" was released for Microsoft Windows on 28 June 2002 and for the Xbox in 23 December 2003. In April 2007 \"Arx Fatalis\" was released on the digital distribution platform Steam, followed by GOG.com in December 2008.\n\nOn 14 January 2011, Arkane Studios released a 1.21 patch and the game's source code under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). Based upon this source code the formed \"Arx Libertatis\"-project tries to fix bugs and incompatibilities and port the game to operating systems like Linux, FreeBSD and the OpenPandora handheld. Latest iteration of \"Arx Libertatis\" is 1.1 released in July 2013. Also, several fan-made translations of the game were created, e.g. to Polish, Turkish and Korean.\n\nWhile the game was well received, it was considered a commercial failure. \"Arx Fatalis\" received generally favorable reviews from critics having an average rating of 80% on GameRankings for the Microsoft Windows Version, and 72.61% for Xbox version, respectively a score of 77 out of 100 on Metacritic for the Microsoft Windows Version, and 71 out of 100 on Xbox version.\n\n\"Arx Fatalis\" was released after \"\" and \"Neverwinter Nights\", with reviewers stating that although it is not so open like \"Morrowind\" it will appeal to the fans that like Dungeon Crawler RPGs, paying homage to games like \"Ultima:Underworld\".\nGameSpot's Greg Kasavin was pleased with the experience that the game offers, stating that \"\"Arx Fatalis\" is entertaining and great looking, and it should especially appeal to fans of other atmospheric first-person games, including \"\", \"System Shock 2\", and \"Deus Ex\", let alone this year's \"Morrowind\". Though marred by some technical issues (many of which have already been addressed by patches) and at times confusing to navigate in, \"Arx Fatalis\" nevertheless delivers a memorable, original role-playing experience\", and IGN's Dan Adams overall enjoying the game stating that \"The atmosphere, spell system, puzzles, voices, and story were good and interesting enough to give me a pretty enjoyable experience.\"\nAlthough critics pointed out the visuals not being very appealing and the sound being like a \"mixed bag\" with \"Some of the voice work is very good with particularly the main character's detached and distant voice, which makes more sense when you learn his identity. While some of the races had fairly cheesy voices.\"\n\n\"Arx Fatalis\" was nominated as 2002's best computer role-playing game by \"Computer Gaming World\", GameSpot and the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences. It was also a runner-up for RPG Vault's \"Surprise of the Year\" and \"Debut Game of the Year\" awards, and for GameSpot's \"Best Sound\" and the Game Developers Choice Awards' \"Rookie Studio of the Year\" prizes. However, it did win RPG Vault's award for sound design that year. The editors of \"Computer Gaming World\" wrote that \"Arx Fatalis\" \"has hands-down the most annoying interface of the year, but fortunately, it also sports sharp graphics [...] and a great story\".\n\n\"Arx Fatalis\" critical praise gave Arkane the opportunity for them to work with Valve Corporation to develop a new title on their Source engine, and Colantonio opted to make a sequel, \"Arx Fatalis 2\". However, the poor sales of the first game made it difficult to find a publisher; They were approached by Ubisoft and asked to apply the \"Arx Fatalis\" game engine to their \"Might and Magic\". This became \"Dark Messiah of Might and Magic\", released in October 2006. It refined the first-person melee combat of \"Arx Fatalis\" with a lesser emphasis on role-playing elements. During this time, Colantonio moved from France to Austin, Texas leaving the main studio in the hands of his colleagues while he set up Arkane Austin in June 2006.\n\n"}

Paul (April 22, 1907 – September 18, 2005) was a puppeteer best known for his traveling show and television broadcasts of \"Paul's Puppets\". His marionette show ran for 10 years on WBAL-TV in Baltimore. In 1931 he performed the first known children's television show.\n\nPaul also did the first professional puppet show for a United States president when he performed at the White House for Franklin D. Roosevelt and his wife in 1934.\n\nBernard Paul was born on April 22, 1907, in Baltimore, Maryland, the only child of Henry James Paul and Mary Paul. He was born in a private hospital called Bidler and Sellman. He went by the nickname \"Bernie\". The family lived in Baltimore on Lanvale Street for a while and later moved to a house on Gilmore Street.\n\nThey moved to a neighborhood called Linthicum Heights in 1919 when Paul was 12 years old. Paul's father designed and built the house that was located on Hawthorne Road. That homesite had many flower and vegetable gardens.\n\nPaul attended Linthicum Elementary School, where he first met his future wife, Edith \"Edee\" Rogers.\n\nAfter Paul's graduation from the eighth grade his family had moved out of the area where Edith lived and he lost contact with her at this time. Paul had then attended Baltimore City College for a year. For the next three years he then went to Severn Preparatory School in Severna Park, Maryland, from which he graduated in 1925. Paul then enrolled at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) where he was reunited with Edee. He studied stagecraft and she was a student of costume design and became a professional seamstress. They graduated from MICA in 1929.\n\nPaul and Edee were married on April 17, 1930, in his parents' home on Hawthorne Road in Linthicum. They lived there for their entire lives. They had two sons who were raised there as the third generation in the same house. Peter Darr was their first son, born on January 21, 1933. Larry Ramon was their second child, born on July 10, 1935.\n\nPaul had changed his mind of becoming a college-trained professional in stagecraft sometime in the late 1920s. This happened after seeing a puppet performance of Tony Sarg at Goucher College. He then decided on a career in puppetry. Paul associated himself with Sarg and obtained marionette puppet ideas and skills. In a short time they became friends. From Sarg's unique training he and his wife learned to stage puppet shows at the Maryland Institute College of Art. The faculty was so impressed with their performances that they began teaching puppetry, and a teaching stint spanning almost two decades followed.\n\nPaul, along with his wife Edee, started a traveling puppet show in 1930 called Paul's Puppets. With their combined puppetry talents they managed every step of the process for each performance. Paul, with his skills, designed and built the puppet sets and marionettes. Edee created the puppets' scripts and their costumes. Paul had a separate 45' by 16' workshop studio that was part of their personal residence he added in 1952. In the studio he created the marionettes that were made from pine, which included the flexible wooden joints for the puppets. The marionette heads were from plaster wood. The rough block heads were individually crafted, specifically shaped, finished, painted up, and decorated with hair. His wife would add her custom-designed costumes just before being attached to an overhead controller by strings.\n\nPaul's Puppets consisted of a company of some 500 marionettes, including animals, fairies, giants, princes, princesses and soldiers. The performances were adaptations of the Arabian Nights, Aesop's fables, Daniel Defoe, Beatrix Potter, John Ruskin, Mark Twain and Hans Christian Andersen fairy tales. Other plays were of Snow White, Red Riding Hood, Butterfly that Stamped, Undersen and Taps, and The Wizard Prince. The performances represented countries from around the world.\n\nThe marionette puppets were carefully stored when not performing. A son had noted that the family could never play with the hand-crafted marionettes because they were stage props and not children's toys. The performances in the first years had musical accompaniment from 78-rpm records. The sound effect techniques improved later and included music tapes. Paul and his wife were the voices for their marionette characters.\n\nPaul worked as an assistant Post Master at a U.S. Post Office in 1940 giving puppet shows with his marionettes on his off times. The Pauls did performances at Army posts and aboard Navy ships during World War II. They also did puppet acts on college campuses, in retail store windows, at country clubs, local schools and churches. Notable performances they did later consisted of one in an opera at the Peabody Conservatory and another in a Shakespeare play. In their performances they mocked things like candy, politicians, and Social Security.\n\nThe Pauls started television for WMAR in late 1947 when they did a commercial with their marionettes. Paul's Puppets then made a 15-minute debut on WBAL-TV on January 8, 1948, in preparation for a twice-weekly show that ran for ten years. It was sponsored by Hutzler's department store. Other sponsors were Nestle's Ever Ready Sweet Milk Cocoa and Planters Peanuts. The first shows came with theme music of \"March of the Little Fawns\". The later ones came with music from The Nutcracker. Paul once told a friend that though the television show was considered a success, he missed having a live audience. One noted marionette character that many remember was JoJo. It was a red, white, and blue clown puppet that had interviews with audience children as the master of ceremonies before going \"live\" with the show.\n\nWBAL began showing the performances in color in 1955. In 1957 the station changed its programming to a news-weather program in Paul's Puppets evening time period. The puppet performances were moved to a morning time slot and the show floundered because the targeted audience of children were in school. Their television career ended in 1958, but they still did live performances at the Hutzler's stores.\n\nThe Pauls made display windows in later years for department stores like Hochschild's and Hutzler's. The display windows consisted of still doll-like figures that did not move as their marionette puppets did. One display was of the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. Another store display showed shoppers on Howard Street in Baltimore at the turn of the twentieth century.\n\nPaul had several hobbies. Among them were carving, collecting, photography, making jewelry and woodworking. He was a collector with wide-ranging interests, including bells and gongs, butterflies, buttons, masks, old music boxes, swords, Oriental objects, toy soldiers and ancient puppets. He had a photography darkroom in his house and developed his own pictures.\n\nThe Pauls performed puppet shows in schools, hospitals and department stores until retiring in 1981. Paul's wife died on November 2, 1993. Paul remained at the Hawthorne Road home in Linthicum until he was 96. He then moved to an assisted living facility. Paul died on September 18, 2005, at the age of 98.\n\nPaul and his wife had a television career in the Baltimore area for ten years on TV stations WBAL and WMAR. Their puppet show was the first Baltimore color television show. It was also chosen to be in the first edition of TV Guide for Baltimore as the featured program. Paul was a guest on the American television panel game show \"To Tell the Truth\" on March 19, 1965. Since he misspelled the name of a well-known puppet, none of the panelists guessed he was Bernard H. Paul of Paul's Puppets.\n\nPaul performed the first known children's television show. It aired November 6, 1931, over television station W3XK in Wheaton, Maryland. Paul and his wife did the first professional puppet show at the White House. It was done with their marionettes for President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his wife in 1934. The Roosevelt's grandchildren were present. It was during traditional Easter egg roll children's festival on the White House lawn.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36339709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36339709", "title": "Catalogues of classical compositions", "text": "Catalogues of classical compositions\n\nThis article gives some details of the various catalogues of classical compositions that have come into general use.\n\nWhile the opus numbering system has long been the standard manner in which individual compositions are identified and referenced, it is far from universal, and there have been many different applications of the system. Very few composers gave opus numbers to all of their published works without exception:\n\nThere are cases where works that a composer chose not to publish were published after their death and assigned very late opus numbers that often give a misleading idea of their order of composition (cases include Mendelssohn, Chopin and Tchaikovsky).\n\nOther composers simply never used opus numbers at all (examples include Copland, Vaughan Williams and many other 20th-century composers).\n\nIn some cases, the opus numbers that were established during the composer's lifetime are still used, but symbols from alternative comprehensive catalogues are used for unpublished works or works that have come to light since the composer's death.\n\nFor the above and other reasons, musicologists have often found it necessary to produce comprehensive catalogues that incorporate the most up-to-date information available about the composers' works. These catalogues sometimes also include unpublished sketches, incomplete drafts, even doubtful works and those known to have been spuriously attributed, as well as writings and other non-musical output.\n\nWhen such a catalogue finds general acceptance, the sequence numbers allocated by the author then become the standard way of referencing the composer's works, and these numbers usually supersede the opus numbers (if any) that were previously used.\n\nSome such catalogues are organised in a single chronological sequence; others are divided into different genres and listed chronologically within each genre; others are alphabetically arranged. Thematic catalogue indicates a catalogue with a music example (incipit/theme) for each entry, usually represented on one or two staves. A symbol is chosen to represent the catalogue as a whole, and this is usually the initial of the author's or the composer's surname, or an abbreviation of the title of the catalogue itself. In a small number of cases, different symbols apply to different parts of the catalogue.\n\nAmong the most famous examples of this are:\n\nIn some cases, both the opus number \"and\" the newer catalogue designation are sometimes appended to a work. For example, Schubert's first set of Impromptus was published as Op. 90 and is now catalogued as , but concert programmes, CDs and reference works commonly refer to Schubert's \"Impromptus, Op. 90, D. 899\".\n\nSome catalogues have appendixes (, abbreviated as Anh.) for doubtful and/or spurious works, arrangements, etc.\n\nA thematic catalogue is an index used to identify musical compositions through the citation of the opening notes (incipit) and/or main theme(s) of the work and/or of its movements or main sections. Such catalogues can be used for many purposes, including as guides to a specific composer's works, as an inventory of a library's holding or as an advertisement of a publisher's output. In addition to the musical identification, a thematic catalogue may continue information such as dates of composition and first performance. Works within a thematic catalogue can be grouped chronologically or by genre.\n\nThematic catalogues produced as scholarly guides to the works of a particular composer provide a shorthand means of identification for their music. The Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (BWV) numbering system used for the works of Johann Sebastian Bach is one example.\n\nIn a number of cases, more than one catalogue exists, or has existed, for the same composer's works. In most such cases, only one will be considered the current standard catalogue for the purposes of musicological indexing. For example, Liszt's works are now known only by S numbers, from the catalogue by Humphrey Searle, which superseded that created by Peter Raabe, which used R numbers. Older catalogues are included for historiographic purposes.\n\nBut there are exceptions to this, such as:\n\nThe following incomplete list gives details of many of the catalogues and symbols that have been used, and in many cases are still in use. It is in author or composer order, but can be sorted in symbol order.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28408694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28408694", "title": "Catherine (video game)", "text": "Catherine (video game)\n\nCatherine is a puzzle platformer video game developed by Atlus. The game was released by Atlus for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in Japan and North America in 2011, and in PAL regions by Deep Silver the following year. The story follows Vincent Brooks, a man who is beset by supernatural nightmares while torn between his feelings for longtime girlfriend Katherine and the similarly-named beauty Catherine. The gameplay is divided between daytime hours, where Vincent interacts with the characters, and his dreams where he must navigate three-dimensional tower puzzles. The game's ending is affected by moral choices made by Vincent over the course of the story.\n\n\"Catherine\" was developed by the same studio behind the \"Persona\" series, including producer and director Katsura Hashino, character designer Shigenori Soejima, and music composer Shoji Meguro. The game began production near the end of \"Persona 4\" development in 2008, with the aim being to create something different from the \"Persona\" series, being aimed more at an adult audience. The English localization was handled by Atlus USA, with the English actors being allowed to adlib some lines.\n\nReception was generally positive, with critics praising its mature subject matter and gameplay, despite criticism towards its high difficulty. Several journalists also commented on its representation of gender stereotypes. It exceeded Atlus' sales expectations by having sold over half a million units worldwide by the end of 2011. \"Catherine: Full Body\", a remaster featuring an additional love interest named Rin, will be released for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in 2019.\n\n\"Catherine\" is a puzzle platformer adventure game in which players control Vincent Brooks, who begins having strange nightmares after his girlfriend, Katherine, begins to talk about marriage and commitment. This matter becomes more complicated for him when he meets a girl named Catherine, and begins an affair with her, and the nightmares get more and more intense. The main story mode, Golden Playhouse, follows the story between Daytime and Nightmare scenarios. During the daytime, Vincent will converse with his friends as well as try to handle his relationships with Catherine and Katherine. Most of this time takes place in the Stray Sheep bar where Vincent can save and send text messages from his mobile phone, talk to customers, order drinks, play a minigame titled \"Rapunzel\" or listen to a jukebox containing tracks from other Atlus games such as the \"Persona\" series.\n\nThe main gameplay takes place in the Nightmare stages. In a nightmarish dreamworld inhabited by other men, who are represented as anthropomorphic sheep, Vincent must climb up giant staircases that are slowly collapsing underneath him and safely reach the top. To accomplish this, Vincent must push, pull and climb blocks as quickly as possible while avoiding various traps such as spikes and ice. Climbing up steps in quick succession increases a score multiplier, and at the end of the level, players are given an award based on their score. Each stage is split up into numerous areas, culminating in a boss stage in which a nightmarish creature also attempts to kill Vincent. Vincent can move faster depending on how much alcohol he drinks during the day and can earn pillows that allow him to retry levels. There are also several items which can be found or purchased in between stages, such as spare blocks, lightning which removes enemies and energy drinks that allow Vincent to climb more steps at a time. Vincent will die if he falls off the bottom of the level, gets caught by a trap or is killed by a boss, with the game ending if Vincent runs out of retry pillows. In between action stages, Vincent can interact with the other sheep, save his game, learn techniques or spend coins on special items. When playing on easy and normal difficulty, players can push the Select/Back button to correct a single block move.\n\nThroughout the game, the choices the player makes during certain sections of the game will affect the development of Vincent's character and the route the story takes place. This is represented by a morality meter, which can change in several ways, such as how Vincent types out a text message to one of the girls, how he answers certain questions and how he converses with non-playable characters. The game features multiple endings based on the route Vincent takes, and has over twenty hours of gameplay. In addition to the Golden Playhouse mode, Babel Mode features four large stages playable with up to two players, while Vs Colosseum features two players simultaneously playing a stage in order to reach the top first.\n\n\"Catherine\" takes place in an undefined North American city. The plot is presented as a story within a story told through \"Golden Playhouse\", a television program described as \"like a Saturday morning theatre, with a bit of a \"Twilight Zone\" vibe\". A key location in the game is the Stray Sheep Bar, where the main cast meet up on a regular basis and acting as the stage for the game's major events. The story remains the same up to the ending, which varies based upon the choices Vincent has made in both the real world and the Nightmare realm. The plot of \"Catherine\" focuses on three main characters:\nOther characters featured are and or \"Master\", staff at the Stray Sheep Bar that Vincent frequents. Vincent's regular drinking partners at the Stray Sheep Bar are , an old friend and divorcee who holds cynical views on marriage; , a man whose view is that marriage to a destined partner is ideal; and a young co-worker of Johnny who is eager to marry and has a crush on Erica. The whole experience is introduced by Trisha, known in Japanese as , the host of \"Golden Playhouse\" who is dubbed the \"Midnight Venus\".\n\nVincent Brooks is unwilling to commit to marrying longtime girlfriend Katherine. One night at the Stray Sheep Bar, a drunken Vincent meets an enigmatic young woman named Catherine; they have a one-night stand which turns into an affair. Simultaneously, Vincent begins experiencing surreal nightmares where he and other men must ascend a tower while outrunning terrifying demons; if they fail in the dream, they die in real life. The stress of his double life and the growing intensity of his nightmares eventually leads Vincent to end the affair with Catherine. In a violent confrontation between Vincent, Catherine, and Katherine, Catherine is seemingly killed; however, the incident is revealed to have occurred in the nightmare, from which Vincent and Katherine escape. The next day, Katherine — who has retained no memory of the nightmare — breaks off their relationship.\n\nVincent realizes he is seemingly the only person aware of Catherine's existence, and that all of her messages have vanished from his phone. Vincent confronts Mutton, the proprietor of the Stray Sheep who is the only other person he has witnessed Catherine speaking to. He learns that Mutton is Dumuzid the Shepherd, and that Catherine is a succubus who aided Mutton in his game to kill men who would not commit to marriage and family. Vincent enters the nightmare game one last time, on the condition that he and other men will be freed if he succeeds. Vincent is victorious and defeats Dumuzid, who is revealed to be an associate of Astaroth. From here, there are several possible endings, depending on the player’s actions throughout the game:\n\n\nIn all of the game’s endings, Trisha states in a closing narration that the purpose of Vincent's story, and the player's actions in directing his story, was to determine whether the player desired a life of comfort or a life of excitement. She explains that tower was a metaphor for the journey to adulthood, and that \"there is no right way to climb the tower.\" In a secret ending unlocked when the player clears the game’s challenge stages, Trisha speaks directly to the player and reveals that she is Ishtar, with Astaroth having been one of her avatars. Having grown tired of Dumuzid’s infidelity, the events of \"Catherine\" were a test to find someone worthy of her love. She offers to make the player into a deity so that they can become her consort.\n\n\"Catherine\" was developed by the \"2nd Creative Production Department\", a team within Atlus who had previously handled development for the \"Persona\" series, a subseries within the \"Megami Tensei\" franchise. Planning for \"Catherine\" began while the development team were performing final polishing work for \"Persona 4\" prior to the latter's 2008 release. \"Catherine\" was the very first title developed by Atlus for high-definition (HD) video game consoles, specifically the PlayStation 3 (PS3) and Xbox 360 (360). It used the third-party Gamebryo game engine. While they had the option of developing the title for handheld consoles or mobile devices, Hashino felt that the game would lose its charm on less powerful hardware. Using HD consoles they were able to fully portray the world of \"Catherine\". Despite the shift onto HD consoles making their vision easier to realize, debugging for multiple consoles caused problems that pushed back the planned development schedule. In a 2012 statement, an Atlus staff member said that \"Catherine\" was a \"difficult\" game for the company to make. The game would later be called a \"test\" for the development of the next \"Persona\" title.\n\nThe aim with \"Catherine\" was to create a game that was not within the role-playing genre as with the majority of Atlus' titles, in addition to making something that was aimed at adults. The main aim was to create something new as a change prior to developing a new role-playing game. The three key staff members were all veterans of the \"Persona\" series: director and producer Katsura Hashino had helmed both \"Persona 3\" and \"Persona 4\"; art director and character designer Shigenori Soejima had designed characters for both \"Persona 3\" and \"Persona 4\"; and composer Shoji Meguro had created music for multiple \"Megami Tensei\" titles, including the \"Persona\" series. The chief designer was Kazuhisa Wada, while the chief programmer was Yujiro Kosaka. The initial story was written by Hashino, who originally worked alone on the scenario before other writers were brought on to help. Hashino felt that \"Catherine\" was an ambitious title due to its themes and subject matter, saying that no-one but Atlus would have supported the project. The main theme is love between men and women, although in its infancy the project was themed around conflict. In order to make the love triangle between Vincent, Catherine and Katherine sound realistic, he asked other members of Atlus staff for their experiences. One story, where a woman detailed killing people in her dreams, was almost directly referenced within the game.\n\nSoejima, who had mainly worked on the \"Persona\" series up to this point, was most focused on making the characters' expressions seem realistic within the context of the story. All the characters were designed around being realistic, with their proportions being more akin to real people rather than stylized figures. According to him, he was influenced by the game's themes of instinctual desire intruding into everyday life, the desire for sleep, and the concept of greed. Vincent exemplified these themes. Vincent's character was based on and named after Vincent Gallo, specifically his appearance in the 1998 film \"Buffalo '66\". The younger \"Catherine\" was designed to be beautiful and youthful when compared to \"Katherine\", who had an adult charm. The pink coloring of the game's user interface was intended to evoke its sensual and \"kitschy\" atmosphere. The cutscenes were created by anime production studio Studio 4°C. While the \"Persona\" games up to that point boasted around half an hour of cutscenes, the number in \"Catherine\" came to considerably more. Studio 4 °C spent around a year working on the anime cutscenes.\n\nMeguro began working on the first demo tracks for the game in August 2009. Meguro worked as the main composer, leading a team composed of himself, Kenichi Tsuchiya, Atsushi Kitajoh, and Toshiki Konishi. Kitajoh was the general coordinator and managed sound effects for the action scenes. Meguro did not have much freedom with the project, as Hashino was specific about that he wanted the music to be like. The key words he was given were \"classic\", \"adult oriented\" and \"erotic\". Meguro and his team used multiple genres for the music in \"Catherine\", switching genre depending on the flow of gameplay; action segments used remixes of Classical music, quiet moments used jazz, and the anime cutscenes used strings. Meguro found creating music for the anime cutscenes difficult when compared to earlier projects within the company, as he had to match his music's beat to work by an external company. To help cope Meguro received aid from Tsuchiya, a long-time collaborator on previous cutscene-based pieces. Meguro was highly impressed by both the sound quality compared to his previous work with the company, and the amount of control were was adjusting the relative volume of music and sound effects.\n\n\"Catherine\" was first announced in August 2010, along with its prospective platforms. Upon its announcement, \"Catherine\" proved unexpectedly popular, garnering as much public attention and fan expectation as recent releases in the \"Persona\" series. Due to the game's content, Atlus found it difficult to gain their wished-for rating from Japan's CERO ratings board. Beginning from October 2010, Atlus and its then-parent Index Media began a \"aggressive\" advertising campaign to promote the title in Japan. \"Catherine\" released on February 17, 2011. A PS3 demo for the game was released in January, but in early February Atlus pulled the demo, stating that it had achieved the maximum number of planned downloads. Following player complaints about the game's difficulty, Atlus created a patch which added a lower difficulty. The patches for both the PS3 and 360 versions released in March. The PS3 version was released in mainland Asia on July 26, 2011, distributed by Softsource. The 360 version was not released in the region due to unspecified coding issues.\n\nDifferent cover artwork was created by Soejima for the 360 and PS3 versions—the PS3 cover showed Catherine showing off her cleavage, while the 360 cover had Katherine lying on her front showing her behind. Soejima was originally told by Hashino to create covers that would catch people's eyes in stores; the different cover arts for different versions was chosen as they felt it would be interesting. The two characters were originally going to be in identical, near-naked poses. This was changed due to the character's different charms, which it was felt would be lost if they were posed in such a way. Soejima went through multiple cover designs, with one being the two characters holding different cutlery utensils. Hashino had little involvement beyond his initial instruction, but did ask that more of Katherine's back be shown in the image. The covers exemplified each character's contrasting appeal: Catherine's cleavage showed off her youthful beauty, while displaying Katherine's behind was meant to evoke her more motherly charms. This artwork was used for retail posters, but Atlus also created alternate artwork for stores that wanted something less risque.\n\n\"Catherine\" was initially not planned for a Western release. After an initial leak through listings on EB Games and Gamestop, Atlus USA confirmed that \"Catherine\" would be released in North America. Atlus USA initially had difficulty persuading mainstream stores like Target and Walmart to take \"Catherine\" due to its suggestive cover art and marketing calling it an \"adult\" title, which was mostly associated with erotic games not sold in such stores. To convince them that the game was suitable for mainstream stores, Atlus USA put together a film reel of clips from unspecified triple-A games those stores did sell that featured more explicit content than \"Catherine\". When they met the retailer representatives, they showcased the film and pointed out that \"Catherine\" had none of that content, before showing off the most explicit scenes in the game to prove their point. The retailers were convinced and allowed \"Catherine\" to be sold in mainstream stores, and were also convinced into looking through their stocks as concerns were raised due to the film showcasing other games' erotic content. As with the Japanese version, Atlus used alternate covers for the 360 and PS3 versions. In addition, they created alternate versions of those covers that toned down the suggestive elements for stores catering to more sensitive consumers. \"Catherine\" released in North America on July 26, 2011. In addition to the standard edition, a special limited \"Love is Dead\" edition was created for both PS3 and 360.\n\nThough initial statements from Atlus said that \"Catherine\" would not be released in Europe, its release in the region was leaked through a rating for the 360 version in Germany. Its official release was confirmed in a press release from Atlus shortly after the leak. The title was published by Deep Silver across all PAL territories, and featured written language support for English, Spanish, German, French, and Italian. Deep Silver was chosen as the publisher as they shared Atlus' enthusiasm about the game. \"Catherine\" released in Europe on February 10, 2012. As with North America, the PS3 and 360 versions had a limited special edition. Called the \"Stray Sheep Edition\" after a central location in the game, it had differing content to the North American edition. In Australia, the title was distributed by QV Software. The PS3 version released on February 16, while the 360 version released on February 23.\n\nThe game was localized for the West by Atlus USA, who had previously handled many of the company's earlier titles. Main localization staff included editors Mike Meeker and Clayton S. Chan; and quality assurance staff Scott Williams, Jonathon Reinhold, Kourtnie McKenzie, Allie Doyon and Charles Chaikaew. Compared to previous Atlus titles, which had focused on Japanese culture, Atlus USA had comparatively little work adjusting things for a Western audience as the game was set within a North American city environment. Their main issue was with the dialogue, which was meant to be naturalistic despite some tongue in cheek dialogue, alongside jokes and references that needed adjusting so they would make sense to a Western audience. According to the localizers, the problem \"[wasn't] translating the definition, it's translating the intent\". A major issue the team faced was with the quotes used in loading screens. While they were apparently all famous quotes, they had been taken from a Japanese book of quotes without any authors being mentioned, in addition to their translation into Japanese sometimes being poor. In the event, Atlus USA went with new quotes to put in their place rather than trying to identify and translate the existing quotes. The quotes used were from multiple sources, including Douglas Adams, George Carlin and Rodney Dangerfield. According to Chan, the main advantage of \"Catherine\" compared to other projects was that the situations and characters were ones he and other team members could understand rather than typical fantasy scenarios.\n\nValerie Arem of PCB Productions was the voice director for dubbing. Rather than recording as a team, each actor recorded their lines separately. Baker, Bailey and Willingham, the respective voices of Vincent, Catherine and Johnny, described the voice recording period as a positive experience, reinforced by the fact that they were all old friends. Baker noted that it was a relative rarity for this to be the case in general voice acting. Ruff, the voice of Katherine, was helped in her performance by both Arem and Atlus staff. In contrast to the majority of Japanese game localizations, the lip movements for some cutscenes were adjusted so they would sync with the English voices. This was done to give the acting and performances a more natural feel. This meant that the voice actors had more freedom to adlib parts of their performance: a cited example was the fight between Katherine and Catherine, where the two actresses adlibed the majority of the characters' argument. The aim for realism also meant that the performances were more restrained than those given for Japanese anime, which leaned towards stylized performances. For real-time cutscenes, lines had to be matched with gestures and line lengths to within 0.2 seconds; the Atlus staff needed to go through the Japanese script and create a dedicated column for speaking times, then they acted out the lines themselves so they had a reference for the voice actors, and finally they would allow an actor to alter things a little to suit their performance and document those changes so the subtitles matched.\n\nBaker, Bailey and Ruff had all previously worked with Atlus on the \"Persona\" series: Ruff voiced Yukari Takeba in \"Persona 3\" while Baker and Bailey respectively voiced Kanji Tatsumi and Rise Kujikawa from \"Persona 4\". In an interview, Baker described the Atlus USA staff as giving him and the other English actors a great deal of freedom when it came to delivering lines and portraying their characters. He noted that the themes in \"Catherine\" were far more controversial compared to earlier titles he and Atlus had worked on, and that it was a unique voice acting opportunity. Bailey was working on another Atlus project when she was offered the opportunity to voice Catherine. Having already heard of the project in the press, Bailey accepted the offer; during her time recording lines, she found the experience strange as she considered Baker to be a brotherly figure, starkly contrasting the relationship between Vincent and Catherine. Ruff was offered the role of Katherine based on her acting abilities and her previous work with Atlus. She saw some footage of Katherine to get a feeling for her relationship with Vincent, but did not try to sync her performance with the Japanese. This was partly because of the planned English sync adjustments, and partly because she heard Japanese voice recording and cutscene finalization was still in progress. This was confirmed by Arem in a separate interview. Arem described each main actor's strengths during recording: Baker had good timing when it came to delivering his lines, Bailey required few retakes, while Ruff was able to realistically convey a variety of emotions. She also noted the work done by Fitzgerald, the voice actress for both Trisha and Erica; Fitzgerald had difficulty with the timing for Trisha's lines, but managed to \"pull it off\". The amount of voice acting involved was so large that the actors felt they could not finish it. Looking back on the production, Arem said she would not recast any of the characters.\n\n\"Catherine\" is occasionally played competitively in eSport tournaments. The game's professional scene began when FGC member David \"Dacidbro\" Broweleit desired to learn the insides of the game's engine. The first notable tournament was an event called Super NorCal Install, which took place in 2012. The tournament would become the basis for the game's competitive scene. Publisher Atlus would later officially sponsor the game as a side event at Evo 2015, while streaming it on their Twitch.tv account. The attention surrounding the event would later carry on into Evo 2016, CEOtaku 2016, Genesis 4, as well as an event in San Jose called \"The King of Catherine\", which had awarded a $5,000 prize pool to winners.\n\n\"Catherine\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. It holds average aggregate scores of 82 and 79 out of 100 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, respectively, on Metacritic. In an import review, GamesRadar gave the game a 5/10, praising the story but criticizing the game's difficulty due to random enemy AI, though they later gave the English release 8/10, citing crucial changes had removed most of the game's annoyances. Some Japanese gamers have complained that the game is too difficult, even on the easy setting. Atlus has since released a patch that includes a Super Easy mode, which is included in the English version. IGN gave the North American version of \"Catherine\" an overall score of 9.0. Computer and Video Games gave the game an 8.0. Tom Bissell of Grantland.com, the sports and pop culture website owned by ESPN and run by Bill Simmons, was pleasantly surprised by the game and gave it a very positive review, which included a listing of its eerie qualities.\n\nThe PlayStation 3 version topped the Japanese charts in its opening week with over 140,000 copies sold while the Xbox 360 version came in 7th with over 21,000, and was able to outsell \"\", which was released on the same day, by a margin of two-to-one. The game has also been commercially successful in America, selling 78,000 copies across both systems to consumers in its first six days, making it Atlus' biggest launch yet for a game. The game has sold around 500,000 copies by the end of 2011, being a huge success for the company. The game sold 260,000 copies in Japan and 230,000 in North America by the end of 2011.\n\nIn December 2011, \"Catherine\" received the award for \"Biggest Surprise of 2011\" from TeamXbox, with \"Dead Island\" as the runner-up. In GameSpot's 2011 Game of the Year awards, \"Catherine\" was nominated in the categories of \"Best Puzzle Game\", \"Best Story\", \"Best New Character\", \"Best Voice Acting\", \"Best Original IP\", \"Best Ending\", and \"Best Puzzles\". The game has also received an Annie Award nomination for the \"Best Animated Video Game\" category, alongside another adventure game \"\". In IGN's \"Best of 2011\" awards, \"Catherine\" received the award for \"Best PS3 Story\" and had been nominated in the \"PS3 Game of the Year\" category. IGN has also given \"Catherine\" the overall \"Best Story\" award and nominated it for the \"Best Video Game Trailer\" award. GameZone gave the game the \"Best Original IP\" award and chose Vincent as the runner-up for the \"Best New Character\" award. GameZone also chose the game as the runner-up for the \"Best Puzzle\" award. 411mania gave it the \"Most Original Game\" award. 1UP.com gave it the \"Most Daring Game\" award and chose it as the runner-up for the \"Most Surprising Game\" award. \"The A.V. Club\" chose it as the third best game of the year. \"Famitsu\" awarded it the Rookie Prize in its 2012 awards ceremony. \n\nSince its release, \"Catherine\" has appeared on several lists of the top games of the seventh generation era of video game consoles. In August 2012, IGN placed the game at number eighteen on its list of \"The Top 25 PlayStation 3 Games\", with editor Colin Moriarty praising it as \"authentically unique\" after calling it an example of something \"that's so radically unlike anything else that came before it that it's hard to ignore.\" The next year in September 2013, \"Catherine\" ranked twenty-fourth on IGN's updated \"Top 25 PlayStation 3 Games\" list, with Moriarty stating that \"the puzzles are both challenging and fun, but what makes \"Catherine\" truly stand apart is its daring subject matter and its unapologetic nudging to make us confront some incredibly uncomfortable – but tempting – situations.\" In November 2013, \"Hardcore Gamer\" ranked the game seventy-ninth on its \"Top 100 Games of the Generation\" list, while \"Complex\" placed it at number eight on its list of \"The 25 Most Underrated Games Of the Last Console Generation\". That same month, PlayStation Universe ranked \"Catherine\" number seventy-three on its list of \"The Best 100 Games Of the PS3 Generation\", stating that its \"core puzzle-platforming offers nerve-wracking excitement\" and praised its \"engaging, authentic story.\" In January 2014, \"Catherine\" was included on Game Revolution's list of the \"Top 7 Most Underrated Games Of Last Generation\", with editor Alex Osborn describing it as \"One part block puzzle game, the other social simulation, \"Catherine\" is like nothing you've ever played before.\" In May 2014, IGN ranked \"Catherine\" sixty-fifth on its \"Top 100 Games of a Generation\" list, praising its themes, story, and puzzle gameplay before calling it \"one of the most refreshingly adult games of this past generation.\" The next month in June 2014, the game placed at number sixty-one on IGN's list of the \"Games of a Generation: Your Top 100\" as voted by readers of the website.\n\n\"Catherine\" protagonist Vincent made a cameo appearance in \"Persona 3 Portable\", the PlayStation Portable remake of \"Persona 3\". The port's female protagonist runs into Vincent, who makes reference to the events of \"Catherine\". Vincent was included in \"Persona 3 Portable\" as it was created by the same development team as \"Catherine\", but the version of Vincent in \"Persona 3 Portable\" is not the same as that used in \"Catherine\". Despite the possibility, staff have discounted the possibility of either an anime adaptation or further games in the series, the latter due to the game's challenging production. In 2013, Liz Lanier of \"Game Informer\" included \"Catherine / Katherine\" among the top ten female villains in video games, stating that \"...Vincent can't catch a break between Catherine seducing him one minute and manipulating him the next; Katherine isn't much better with her passive-aggressive push toward marriage. Considering both appear as horrifying boss battles, they can easily be any man's worst nightmare.\" In 2014, David Auerbach of \"Slate\" found \"Catherine\" sexist, writing that its treatment of relationships and sex exemplified a misogynous tendency in video game culture that became a topic of media discussion over the next several years. According to Auerbach, the game is \"a bellwether for what tech culture and gaming have come to mean for a lot of men: a safe playspace from the realities that they believe women force on them.\"\n\nIn December 2017, Atlus announced that its Studio Zero division was developing a remaster of the game for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, \"Catherine: Full Body\", which will feature new gameplay features, an online mode, a third character as a love interest named Rin, and additional endings and chapters. It will be released in Japan on February 14, 2019, with a Western release planned for sometime after.\n"}

{"id": "2940297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2940297", "title": "Fan edit", "text": "Fan edit\n\nA fan edit is a version of a film modified by a viewer, that removes, reorders, or adds material in order to create a new interpretation of the source material. This includes the removal of scenes or dialogue, replacement of audio and/or visual elements, and adding material from sources such as deleted scenes or even other films.\n\nFan edits first came into prominence in 2000, when professional editor Mike J. Nichols released \"The Phantom Edit\", an edited version of \"\" that removed elements he found distracting. \"The Phantom Edit\" circulated online and received attention by the media for its attempt to improve upon the original film, which inspired others to attempt similar edits on other films.\n\nIn their most common form, fan edits resemble the work done by professional editors when creating a director's or extended cut of a film, although fan edits are usually limited by the footage already made available to the public with the official home video release of a film, while professional editors working for a film studio have access to more and higher quality footage and elements. In addition to re-editing films, some fan edits feature basic corrections, such as colors or framing, that maintain or restore consistency within the film, such as the \"Star Wars\" fan-restoration \"Harmy's Despecialized Edition\", which aims at restoring the \"Star Wars\" Original Trilogy to its original, pre-Special Edition form. Other types of fan edits, such as \"Cosmogony\", \"Bateman Begins: An American Psycho\" and \"Memories Alone\", merge footage from various films into an entirely different production. While many fan edits are viewed as reactionary to perceived weaknesses in the original films, one film scholar at the University of Kansas has argued that such edits allow fans to creatively reimagine films instead of merely attempting to fix such works. \n\nFan edits are made for non-commercial purposes and as such could be considered a case of fair use, but their legality is unclear.\n\nBefore the term \"fan edit\" was coined, many alternate versions of films edited by other fans or professional editors were simply known as a \"cut.\" In the late 1970s, many alternate \"cuts\" of films were released in the United States, and foreign films (such as those from Europe or Japan) deemed unsuitable for American audiences underwent further alterations, score changes and re-titlings.\n\nThe first fan edit to popularize the field was \"The Phantom Edit\", created in 2000 by professional editor Mike J. Nichols under the pseudonym of the \"Phantom Editor\". Nichols removed elements from George Lucas' \"\" that he felt detracted from the film, and made minor changes in dialogue, languages and subtitles to give the film's villains a more menacing tone. The end result was distributed on VHS and later online. \"The Phantom Edit\" was the first of many \"Star Wars\" fan edits to come, and has since inspired dozens of edits to surface on the internet.\n\nThe second major edit was done with \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\", originally a film that Stanley Kubrick was involved with, that Steven Spielberg ended up directing after Kubrick's death. In 2002, an independent filmmaker named DJ Hupp introduced his take on the film named \"The Kubrick Edit\", omitting certain scenes to alter the tone, to be closer to Kubrick's style.\n\nThe following year, the \"Purist Edit\" changed \"\" to more closely follow J. R. R. Tolkien's books.\n\nAfter that the trend started to gain popularity and spread to other films in the same fashion, such as \"The Matrix\" series, \"Pearl Harbor\", \"Dune\", \"Superman II\", and others. Editor Adywan (Adrian Sayce) made a complete overhaul of \"Star Wars\" and \"The Empire Strikes Back\" in 2009 and 2017 respectively, under the title \"Star Wars - Revisited\", featuring continuity fixes, image and cropping corrections, score restoration, new matter, rotoscoping work and new CGI elements to remove several additions from the various Special Editions of the films from 1997 onward. In 2008, a similar overhaul was made by editor Uncanny Antman (Sean O'Sullivan) to \"\", which changed the film's tone to be more in line with the first two films and fixed various continuity contradictions to the previous films and image & cropping errors; the film was rereleased under the title of \"Terminator: The Coming Storm\".\n\nProfessional filmmaker Steven Soderbergh has created fan edits of \"Psycho\" and its remake, \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", \"Heaven's Gate\" and \"\" that he has posted on his website.\n\nIndependent filmmaker Peet Gelderblom made a fan edit of Brian De Palma's \"Raising Cain\", which attempted to reorder the film the way it was originally scripted. De Palma came across the fan edit and was so impressed with it, he had Gelderblom supervise a high definition version of it for Blu-ray, which was released under the Director's Cut label, as De Palma felt that the edit has \"restored the true story of \"Raising Cain\"\".\n\nCleanFlicks was a Utah-based video store that offered more than 700 movies that had been remixed to appeal to Utah's religious family audience. The chain of stores spread across 18 states in 70 different locations before a federal court judge ruled their remixes illegal in 2006.\n\nWhile fan edits skirt the lines of fair use, the fan editing community largely emphasizes the use of the final product should only be for those who own the source material (commercial home video releases such as DVD), and are not to be distributed for profit or other personal gain. Lucasfilm is aware of the existence of \"Star Wars\" fan edits, and has stated they will take action when they believe copyright infringement has taken place.\n\nIn July 2007, Lucasfilm took action against fan editor \"daveytod\" after taking issue with his fan edit documentary of \"\", named \"The Clones Revealed\". Their email to him cited the possibility of \"consumer confusion,\" that \"The Clones Revealed\" might be mistaken for an official Lucasfilm product. The email was sent to several active members of the fan editing community and resulted in the short down time of Fanedit.org. The reasoning given by Lucasfilm's anti-piracy team during communications with Fanedit.org moderators seemed to display the mistaken impression that \"The Clones Revealed\" was a bootleg of the film.\n\nIn November 2008, Fanedit.org was briefly closed after receiving a complaint from the Motion Picture Association of America regarding the use of links to its copyrights appearing on the site. After a three-day downtime, the website reopened without any links to potentially infringing files.\n\nFanedit.org has a policy to not allow fan edits made from pirated versions of films to be listed in its database. One notable victim of this policy is \"The Purist Edit\" of \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\", made from a DVD screener leak of the film's theatrical version. Despite being one of the earliest major fan edits available and having historical importance, it is not listed on Fanedit.org.\n\n"}

Virgin Movies has been available on Virgin since January 2005 and saw over 11 million films watched on demand in 2009. FilmFlex replaced \"Front Row\" which was a near video on demand pay-per-view service which was initially available on analogue cable from 1997, switching to digital when digital cable services launched from late 1999 onwards. On 13 September 2012, the FilmFlex service was rebranded as Virgin Movies on the cable platform.\n\nVirgin Movies provides over 500 movies some of which are available in HD (high definition), which are available at any time for the viewer to watch when they want to. Viewers can search for a movie by title, genre, cast or director. Once a movie has been ordered it can be viewed any time within the next 24 hours before it has to be paid for again. The movie can also be viewed as many times as the viewer likes within the 24 hours for no additional cost. Once viewers are watching a movie they have full control over it by the use of pause, rewind and fast forward functions, much like a DVD.\n\nAll genres of movies are available ranging from Hollywood blockbusters to action, adventure, horror, comedy, romance and classic movies.\n\nOn 8 February 2013, the two companies signed a multi-year deal, with investment in the development of next-gen functionality on Virgin Movies, including \"multi-device playback\" through Virgin TV Anywhere.\n\nOn 26 April 2010, Virgin Media announced the launch of its first online movies service: Virgin Media Online Movies.

The promotion was run over five weeks and each week focused on a different genre. Week one: blockbusters, week two: family favourites, week three: cult classics, week four: comedy, week five: action adventure.\n\nEach week viewers could vote on the Virgin Media website for their favourite movie out of a selection of 15 movies and the winning movie would be available to view on the On Demand service, during the next week for the price of 1p.\n\nThe festival returned in 2008.\n\nChannel 4 partnered with FilmFlex to launch an online video on-demand service for Film4.

Turkey banned casinos in 1998, and it banned non-state online gambling in 2006. A state lottery (Milli Piyango) and betting services exists, however, and has some online gambling, and illegal gambling continues to persist.\n\nGambling horses were originally legalised in 1984, and casinos in 1990. New restrictions were introduced in September 1996, including limiting opening hours to 8 hours per day and requiring winnings to be paid by cheque. These followed the July 1996 assassination of \"casino king\" Ömer Lütfü Topal. A law banning casinos (partly because of accusations of money-laundering) was unexpectedly announced and approved in December 1996 and (following legal action against it) took effect on 11 February 1998. However, illegal casinos continue to exist. At the time of the ban casinos were a $1bn industry employing around 20,000 people. Sudi Özkan, another \"casino king\" with 20 casinos, left the country for a time, and was accused of siphoning nearly $700m to Switzerland \"off the books,\" eventually returning after making a deal with the Turkish tax authorities.\n\nOnline gambling was banned in 2006, but the measures to ban it have had limited success. In 2009 it was estimated that a quarter of Swedish firm Betsson's revenues came from Turkey. In 2013 the Turkish Parliament planned to increase penalties for those using online gambling as well as those enabling financial transactions in relation to online gambling.\n\nOnline gambling in Turkey is currently prohibited, with the exception of the state-owned sports betting company, IDDAA, which is the only Turkish entity that is allowed to offer internet gambling services. The law that prohibits online gambling in Turkey was passed in 2007 and recently, Turkey has also been taking measures to prevent players from using foreign internet gambling websites as well. Despite the ban on gambling, many Turkish players continue to bet on online gambling sites and are recognized as leading gamblers. In 2013 Turkish government issued the law by which Turkey has become the first country in the world to target individual players instead of gambling operators. Sanctions for anyone caught in Turkey to access online gambling services is a penalty of between £ 100 and £ 500 (about $ 55-278). Casino operators dealing with the Turkish market and bankers serving them can also face the prison conditions at the same time.\n"}
{"id": "1139574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1139574", "title": "Hannibal Rising", "text": "Hannibal Rising\n\nHannibal Rising is a novel by American author Thomas Harris, published in 2006. It is a prequel to his three previous books featuring his most famous character, the cannibalistic serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter. It is Harris' fifth and most recent novel. The novel was released with an initial printing of at least 1.5 million copies and met with a mixed critical response. Audiobook versions have also been released, with Harris reading the text. The novel was adapted (by Harris himself) into a film of the same name in 2007, directed by Peter Webber.\n\nOpening in Lithuania during 1941, Hannibal Lecter is eight years old and living in a castle with his parents and sister, Mischa. With the castle located near the eastern front of World War II, the Lecter family escapes to their lodge to elude the advancing German troops. With the castle abandoned, it is soon raided by Germans and civilians aiding them, their hidden art collection among the stolen loot. Three years later, an advancing Soviet tank stops at the Lecter family's lodge looking for water, only to be bombed by a German Stuka, the explosion killing all but the children. Surviving in the lodge, Hannibal and Mischa are captured when five deserters appear: Grutas, Milko, Grentz, Dortlich, and Kolnas. Storming and looting the lodge, they lock the Lecters in the barn. Running low on supplies, the soldiers soon take Mischa; realizing they intend to cannibalize her, Hannibal tries to stop them, only to have his arm broken before he blacks out.\n\nHannibal is later spotted by a Soviet tank crew, wearing shackles and rendered mute. Returned to Lecter Castle, now a Soviet orphanage, Hannibal is found to be irreparably traumatized by the ordeal. Removed from the orphanage by his uncle Robert Lecter, Hannibal goes to live with him in France with his aunt, Lady Murasaki. Visiting a marketplace with his aunt, Lecter assaults butcher Paul Momund when he insults Murasaki. Count Lecter, learning of the slight against his wife, violently confronts the butcher and collapses and subsequently dies from a heart attack. Losing most of the Count's estate to death duties, Lecter and Murasaki move across France, and Lecter flourishes as a medical student, assisting by preparing cadavers for lessons.\n\nLocating Momund the butcher, Lecter murders him for his actions, eviscerating and beheading him before eating his cheeks. Suspected by Inspector Popil, Lecter escapes suspicion when Murasaki falsifies evidence, suggesting Momund's death was political. Using sodium thiopental to recall the lodge, Lecter remembers Mischa's murder and her killer's faces, and that the lodge was shelled; the building burning and soldiers fleeing, Lecter was freed by Kolnas, who was then crushed by falling debris. Working with Popil to recover his family's stolen art, Lecter attends a recovered art exhibition with Murasaki, and speaks with one of Grutas' men selling the art. Afraid he will uncover their identities, Grutas sends Dortlich to murder him.\n\nReturning to the dilapidated lodge, Lecter searches the ruins and finds a bag of buried loot, which also contains the hidden dogtags of his captors. Attacked by Dortlich, Lecter strikes him with his shovel, and ties him to a tree stump. Noosed to a horse, Dortlich confirms Grentz relocated to Canada, and that Kolnas owns a restaurant in Fontainebleau; despite his pleas, Lecter uses the horse to tear off Dortlich's head. Returning to France, Lecter is kissed by Murasaki, who insists that he promise to stop killing and to co-operate with Popil; Lecter responds that he already promised revenge for Mischa, and leaves. Lecter continues his studies only to be stalked during his night-shift by Milko. Outwitting Milko and drugging him, Lecter interrogates him for information on Grutas, before drowning him in an embalming tank and incinerating his remains.\n\nEating at Kolnas' restaurant, Lecter notices his daughter is wearing Mischa's stolen bracelet. Entering Grutas' property, Hannibal sets an improvised bomb and confronts him as he bathes, only to be interrupted by Grutas' guards. As Lecter is about to be killed, his bomb detonates and cuts the power, allowing him to wound the guards and escape in the chaos. Returning to Murasaki's home, Lecter receives a call from Grutas, who threatens to kill her unless he surrenders; overhearing ortolans singing in the background of the phone call, Lecter breaks into Kolnas' home, and then heads to his restaurant. Lecter shows he took Mischa's bracelet from his daughter and, in exchange for information, offers to spare Kolnas and free his family. Giving up the location of Grutas' houseboat, Kolnas then realizes Lecter was lying about holding his family. Attacked by Kolnas, Lecter fatally stabs him through the head with a tantō.\n\nFinding and reaching the boat, Lecter sneaks aboard but is wounded by the captain. Killing the guards and captain, Lecter rushes to save Murasaki, only to be shot in the back by Grutas, who boasts while molesting a bound Murasaki. Lecter removes his tantō, dimpled by Grutas' bullet, and uses it to cut Grutas' hamstring. With Grutas disarmed, Murasaki begs Lecter spare him for Popil, only for Grutas to mock him. Taunting that Lecter drank broth made from Mischa, he suggests Lecter kills only to continue lying to himself; enraged, Lecter carves several \"M\"s into Grutas, fatally wounding him. Horrified by Lecter, Murasaki declares there's nothing human left inside him to love, and dives overboard. Detonating the houseboat with an improvised explosive, Lecter flees the scene.\n\nArrested by Popil, Lecter is soon freed when popular support for his dispatch of war criminals combines with a lack of hard evidence. Lecter meets with Murasaki, and they say their goodbyes and part. Offered a residency at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, Lecter heads overseas to North America, stopping briefly to visit bar-owner Grentz in Quebec, Canada.\n\nThe February 22, 2007 issue of \"Entertainment Weekly\" features a quote that suggests that the only reason Thomas Harris wrote the story was out of the fear that a Lecter prequel/origin story would inevitably be written without his involvement. \"Hannibal Rising\" film producer Dino De Laurentiis said \"I say to Thomas, 'If you don't do [the prequel], I will do it with someone else... I don't want to lose this franchise. And the audience wants it...' He said, 'No. I'm sorry.' And I said, 'I \"will\" do it with somebody else.' And then he said, 'Let me think about it.

{"id": "20641178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20641178", "title": "I Am... World Tour", "text": "I Am... World Tour\n\nI Am... (sometimes referred to as the I Am... Tour or the I Am... World Tour) was the fourth concert tour by American recording artist Beyoncé launched in support of her third studio album, \"I Am... Sasha Fierce\" (2008). The tour was announced in October 2008 embarked in March 2009 with five rehearsal shows in North America. The tour consisted of 108 shows in total, visiting the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. Preparations for the shows began eight months prior to the beginning of the tour with twelve-hour rehearsals for two months. Knowles described the shows as her best and most theatrical from all of her tours. \n\nThe set list for the concerts included songs from Knowles' three studio albums as well as several covers of other artists and a Destiny's Child medley. The central theme of the tour was to showcase the difference between Knowles' dual personality; her emotional side and her onstage persona, Sasha Fierce which was also demonstrated in the dual album \"I Am... Sasha Fierce\". The show featured two stages – the main one and a smaller B-stage where Knowles was transferred during the middle of the show. She was backed by an all-female band, female background dancers and a big LED screen. Thierry Mugler collaborated with Knowles on the costumes and had a creative advisor role further working on the choreography, lighting and production. Chris March made the costumes usable for stage and helped in their making. For the ballads, Knowles wore longer dresses while for the performances of the up-tempo songs, more make-up and more revealing outfits were worn. The fashion and Knowles' look and figure received praise from critics.\n\nI Am... received critical acclaim from music critics who praised Knowles' performance abilities calling her the best female performer. A concert in Malaysia was cancelled by Knowles after several Muslim groups tried to ban it although she agreed to tone down her look according to the country's standards. The tour was commercially successful grossing $86.0 million from 93 shows in total. Separate performances of several songs were broadcast on different channels and two concerts were released as live albums; the live performance at the I Am... Yours revue was in a CD/DVD format in 2009 and footage of the tour was released on the similarly titled live album in 2010.\n\nIn 2006, during an interview with MTV News, Beyoncé introduced an aggressive alter ego, Sasha Fierce, which also served as her stage persona. She added that the persona is a complete opposite of her when not performing by characterizing her as \"aggressive... strong... fearless.\" Beyoncé's third album \"I Am... Sasha Fierce\" introduced Sasha Fierce as her alter ego. she revealed that Sasha was born during the making of her single \"Crazy in Love\" (2003). The plans for a 2009 tour in support of the album were announced in October 2008 by \"Billboard\" magazine. The tour dates for the European leg were announced in December 2008. During an interview with \"Entertainment Weekly\", Beyoncé confirmed that she would be backed by the all-female band which had also accompanied her for her previous The Beyoncé Experience tour (2007). Rehearsals for the tour lasted eight months during which the set list for the shows was also constructed. Beyoncé further revealed that the twelve-hour rehearsals for the tour included dancing the choreography in heels for two months before it commenced. During an interview, Beyoncé emphasized how she needed to prepare to channel her alter ego for the performances. According to Beyoncé, the shows were supposed to be a mixture of several of her musical preferences, including jazz, hip-hop, ballet and fashion.\n\nThe tour kicked off in late-March 2009 with five rehearsal shows in North America. It officially commenced in late April 2009, at Arena Zagreb in Croatia later visiting six continents, namely the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. The six-week North American leg of the I Am... tour kicked off on June 21 with a show at Madison Square Garden in New York and finished with a four-night residency at Encore in the Wynn Las Vegas from July 30, 2009 to August 2, 2009. The tour finished with a concert at Queen's Park Savannah in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, with 108 shows in total. Beyoncé and her organization, The Survivor Foundation, became the spokesperson for General Mills' Hamburger Helper campaign entitled, \"Show Your Helping Hand\". The campaign's mission was to provide more than 3.5 million meals to local food banks in North America. Knowles encouraged spectators to bring non-perishable foods to her North American concerts to be donated to the campaign. According to the campaign's official website, nearly three millions meals and over $50,000 have been donated.\n\nBeyoncé revealed that the hardest aspect of coming up with the tour's set list was managing to fit her decade-long song catalogue in a two-hour show. According to her, the tour was supposed to be more emotional than The Beyoncé Experience in order to reflect the \"real[,] raw and more sensitive\" nature of the \"I Am...\" portion of the double album. Beyoncé expressed frustration that snippets of the show appeared online after the first shows on the opening leg, thus \"ruining\" the surprise factor of the concert experience; however she also appreciated the fact that it can act as a \"little sneak peek\" for fans to decide if they indeed want to attend. French designer Thierry Mugler served as the creative advisor while also being responsible for Beyoncé's wardrobe. He contributed in the design of lighting, choreography, production and directed three sequences for the concert. According to his creative vision, the shows were intended to represent \"mise-en-scène\" by incorporating technical aspects with fashion in order to capture the emotions behind the songs. He added, \"There will be a lot of dramatization and metamorphosis on stage. Some very strong effects have been inspired directly by Beyoncé, and only she could make [them] happen on stage.\" \n\nOnstage, Beyoncé was backed by her ten-piece all-female band, Suga Mama, which included two drummers, two keyboardists, a percussionist, a horn section, three backup vocalists called the Mamas, and a lead guitarist. The show featured two stages, namely a simple main stage with a pop0up set of stairs, an LED background screen, and glass risers for Suga Mama and The Mamas as well as a smaller B-stage in the midst of the audience for the later portions of the show. During the concerts, Beyoncé went through six costume changes; during the breaks, The Mamas harmonized. The set list included songs from all of Beyoncé's three studio albums that had been published, a Destiny's Child medley and several covers of other artists. Several critics noted that the songs on the set list were divided into ballads and more up-tempo songs to coincide with the central theme of \"I Am... Sasha Fierce\" – the dual personality of Beyoncé. Beyoncé's costumes were changed in order to coincide with the songs' nature; during performances of ballads, she wore longer white dresses while for the uptempo songs, she had more revealing outfits and make-up.\n\nThierry Mugler served as the main costume designer for the tour. Beyoncé was acquainted to and enraptured by his work at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Gala, titled \"Superheroes, Fashion and Fantasy\" (2008) where she saw several of his haute couture pieces that were on display. Beyoncé discussed the possibility of using the costumes with Tina Knowles. She met with Mugler in Paris in September of the same year and started exchanging ideas for costume designs and the following month he was contracted as the designer for the tour. While designing, the main concept Mugler wanted to illustrate was the duality between \"being a woman and a warrior\" through his own creative perception; the words \"Feminine. Free. Warrior. Fierce\" were the overarching inspiration. He felt, \"Sasha Fierce is another aspect of Beyoncé's personality, she is Fierce on stage and Beyoncé in real life... Beyoncé is a very sophisticated 'stage animal', which means that she is truly instinctive. Beyoncé expresses herself through the two aspects of her personality.\" Furthermore, the elaborate costumes were related to the meanings of the songs performed. \n\nA seventy one piece wardrobe was designed for Beyoncé and her dancers and band. For the shows, Beyoncé adopted ten different looks. American fashion designer Chris March also worked with Mugler ensuring the costumes were suitable for stage purposes. On July 23, 2009, March filed a lawsuit against Mugler for allegedly not paying him for the work he did on the wardrobe. Metal pieces, fishnets, gloves, power shoulders and golden leotards were all incorporated in the costumes, the majority of which were form-fitting and exposed the singer's legs. Michael Quintanilla of \"San Antonio Express-News\" thought the fashion was akin to a \"high-tech \"Blade Runner\" world\". For the performance of several songs, Beyoncé also wore leopard-print pants and glow-in-the-dark bra with a blinking beacon affixed to her body.\n\nThe fashion and Beyoncé's look during the shows received praise from critics. Randall King of the \"Winnipeg Free Press\" noted that the fashion was inspired by \"1970s space movie\" fashion by Bob Mackie. Alice Jones of \"The Independent\" noted: \"[the list of] 30 songs introduces us to any number of different Beyoncés – showgirl, balladeer, feminist, rock chick, gangster queen, cyborg – via off-stage costume changes and a leotard for every mood\". Kathy McCabe of \"The Daily Telegraph\" noted that the shows featured \"some of the most elaborate and revealing costumes of her career\" thus far. A writer of the \"Evening Chronicle\" wrote that the sparkling outfits managed to capture the singer's personality with looks ranging from \"NYPD cop to bride to Wonderwoman and beyond\" all the while emphasizing her physique. Holly Burnes of \"The Daily Telegraph\" also praised the fashion writing that the singer's look included \"one incredible costume after another: from a Mad Max look... to an angelic wedding dress Jay Hanna of \"The Sunday Times\" compared Beyoncé's look to a goddess, particularly with the costume she wore for \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\".\n\nThe show started with Beyoncé's silhouette appearing on a smoky stage, walking towards the front while singing several lines of \"Déjà Vu\". Dressed in a gold leotard and stilettos, she was quickly joined by two dancers in catsuits proceeding to perform \"Crazy in Love\"; during the performance of the song glitter and confetti were dropped on stage. \"Naughty Girl\" was performed next as bright orange lights were displayed on stage. For the performance of \"Freakum Dress\", Beyoncé was accompanied by a guitarist onstage, bending backwards during the song's bridge. \"Get Me Bodied\" followed, for which the singer was engaging in elaborate dance routines with her background dancers. Following a short break, Beyoncé proceeded singing songs from the \"I Am...\" portion of the album, dressed in a white leotard. \"Smash Into You\" was performed on top of a flight of stairs. For \"Ave Maria\", her background dancers turned her white dress into a wedding gown by attaching a veil to her head. Excerpts of Sarah McLachlan's \"Angel\" and Franz Schubert's Ave Maria\" were performed at the end. She continued on to sing \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" wearing a white bustier with a sheer, flowing wrap. Outtakes from the music video of \"If I Were a Boy\" were Beyoncé appeared to perform the aforementioned song dressed as a cop wearing Ray-Bans and a leather breastplate. Excerpts from Alanis Morissette's \"You Oughta Know\" and Tupac Shakur's \"California Love\" were incorporated in the middle of the song. A video interlude directed by Melina Matsoukas was shown set to \"Sweet Dreams\". The video showed a robotic Beyoncé interacting with a cheetah as a mechanical voice intoned Sasha Fierce. Beyoncé then appeared on stage dressed in a leopard-print leotard to perform \"Diva\". She appeared at the top of the staircase with her backup female dancers; a video interlude showing a five-year old Beyoncé singing and dancing was shown in the middle of the song. She then sang \"Radio\" while the clip of her dancing as ac child was still projected on the screen. \"Me, Myself and I\" was introduced with a brief speech about female empowerment. \"Ego\" and \"Hello\" were performed afterwards. \n\nThe show continued with a short medley performed by her backup singers, The Mamas, followed by another video interlude, featuring Sasha Fierce. Beyoncé appeared on stage after a gong bang; she was lifted out of a 20-foot train by a harness and performed \"Baby Boy\" while high-stepping and front-flipping above the audience. She was then lowered to the B-stage where she finished the song and continued with a cover Dawn Penn's \"You Don't Love Me (No, No, No)\". A stripped-down version of \"Irreplaceable\" was sung afterwards with frequent crowd interactions. Beyoncé then continued with \"Check On It\" and a medley of Destiny's Child hits including \"Bootylicious\", \"Jumpin' Jumpin'\", \"Independent Women\", \"Bills, Bills, Bills\" and \"Survivor\". Performances of \"Upgrade U\" and \"Video Phone\" followed. For the performance of the two songs, Beyoncé was accompanied by two female dancers and three male dancers, one of whom recorded a live stream of her with a camera throughout the routine during the performance of the latter song. This was followed by a rendition of \"Say My Name\" where she interacted with members of the audience, asking them to say her name. The concert followed back at the main stage where for the penultimate section, Beyoncé appeared wearing a gown and singing \"At Last\". A footage of her performance of the song at Barack Obama's inauguration as President of the United States, video images of civil rights era footage and snippets from her performance of the song in the movie, \"Cadillac Records\" (2008) were shown on the screen behind here. \"Listen\" was performed afterwards. This was followed by a YouTube video interlude featuring imitations of the choreography of \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" performed by fans as well as Barack Obama and Justin Timberlake. Beyoncé then performed the song's trademark choreography accompanied by two female back-up dancers. For the finale, an extended version of \"Halo\" was performed while the singer descended from the stage to shake hands with fans in the front rows. She then went to the top of the staircase and repeatedly said \"I am\", awaiting the crowd to say it back. The letters \"I am... yours\" were displayed on the screen as she exited the stage.\n\nThe tour received rave reviews from critics. Mike Ross of the website Jam! rated Beyoncé's performance with 4.5 out of 5 stars, praising the \"high-production\", the singer's wide vocal range and her \"riveting presence\". Stephanie Classen of \"The Star Phoenix\" remarked, \"Beyoncé doesn't really need the bells and whistles of a big stadium show, but it sure makes for an unforgettable concert.\" Randall King of the \"Winnipeg Free Press\" graded the tour 4 stars out of 5 and praised the \"back and forth\" switch between the double persona throughout the show with the singer exhibiting both \"raw energy\" and \"feeling\"-induced ballads. Alice Jones of \"The Independent\" emphasized how the singer managed to \"sing her heart out\" in various musical styles that characterze the show's songs while further praising the energetic choreography and the vocals that range from \"caramel smooth to honeyed foghorn\". She concluded her review by saying, \"Watching Beyoncé sing and strut her stuff can feel at best overawing, at worst, alienating\". \n\nBen Ratliff of \"The New York Times\" observed that the show would make spectators question themselves how the singer managed to put on a \"dazzling show\" both physically and organizationally; he further praised the singer's \"hollering voice, her imperious movement, her costume changes and the show's crush of concepts with their long tails of reference\". Deborah Mcaleese and Lauren Mulvenny of \"The Belfast Telegraph\" described the show as \"incredible... mind blowing... [and] electrifying\". A writer of \"Evening Chronicle\" wrote that the show's set abounded with \"bling, glamour and, most importantly, enthusiasm\", further praising her for the well-coordinated balance between \"hit[ting] every note\" and following elaborate choreographies. Jay Hanna of \"The Sunday Times\" felt that the show's encore (\"Halo\") was the most memorable moment of the set. She also praised the singer's \"enviable\" dancing skills, \"spectacular production and audio visuals\" but noted that some songs \"let down\" the performance by being less melodic. Jay Lustig of \"The Star-Ledger\" described the show as a \"bona fide pop spectacle\" with futuristic themes throughout. Jim Farber from the \"Daily News\" viewed the tour as \"a huge upgrade in charm, humor and chops\" as compared to The Beyoncé Experience and added that \"Beyoncé's presence punctuated her singing like an exclamation point\".\n\nDescribing the show as simultaneously \"spellbinding, exhausting to watch and hugely slick\", Michael Cragg of musicOMH noted that the highlights included songs from the \"Sasha Fierce\" half of the album. Caryn Ganz of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine praised the show, lauding the singer for her work ethic and the ability to execute singing, dancing and posing at the same time. Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News, commented \"Through six outfit changes, bombastic ballads, high-energy singles and a daring high-wire journey from the stage to the center of the arena, Beyoncé delivered over and over again.\" A writer of \"Billboard\" magazine noted that Knowles \"brought all the fierceness\" on stage for the tour. \"The Australian\"s Patrick Emery noted that Knowles showcased her self-assurance and professionalism in \"full view\". Comparing her performance with Michael Jackson's live shows, Renee Michelle Harris of the \"South Florida Times\" writes, \"[Knowles] owns the stage with her trademark swagger and intensity... showcasing her powerful vocals without missing a note, often while engaged in vigorous, perfectly executed dance moves\". Holly Burnes of \"The Daily Telegraph\" noted that the performance was almost inimitable and added \"Whether crumping, sweeping across the stage in towering heels, or simply standing still, Beyonce was dynamite, blasting the benchmark for concert performers forever\". \n\nSimon Colling from \"The West Australian\" described the performance as \"powerhouse\" and added, \"Beyonce's high-energy, high-voltage mix of song (loud, commercial R&B) and dance recalled names like Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin and rapper Missy Elliott... [and] Mariah Carey\". Joanna Horowitz of \"The Seattle Times\" noted that despite the inclusion of almost 10 different musical styles in the show's set list, the singer's \"own [musical] signature\" and focus were lacking. Nevertheless, Horowitz praised the singer's performing skills and summarized the concert as \"a hip-hop Cirque du Soleil — sequins galore, dramatic dance numbers, and Beyoncé at one point soaring\". \"The Observer\"s Barbara Ellen wrote, \"she is a force of nature – delivering one of the most enjoyable well-paced shows I've seen in years\". However, she noted that Knowles is \"so steeped in professionalism that what should be magical can become mechanical.\" Noting influences by Tina Turner and Barbra Streisand during the tour, Ann Powers of \"Los Angeles Times\" writes: \"And she danced like only Beyonce can dance, with a combination of power, grace and smarts that fully unites Broadway choreography with urban street innovations ... Indeed, her production can be seen as a retelling of pop's history from a feminine viewpoint -- and as an argument for Beyonce as the ultimate realization of the female pop dream.\"\n\nBen Ratliff of \"The New York Times\" summarized the tour's concept as \"the duality of well-meaning good girl and rapacious animal-robot-dance-titan.\" Jay Lustig of \"The Star-Ledger\" concluded that the album's split personality was reflected in the show naturally enough. However, Barbara Ellen of \"The Observer\" wrote, \"Another irritant is the much-trumpeted 'duality' nonsense with Sasha Fierce, Beyoncé's alter-ego for her latest album. All 'Sasha' does here is flail about in a video, no different from regular Beyoncé, except for a gold dress and a hairdo that veers dangerously towards Liberace.\" Similarly, Ann Powers from the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that the only thing which was not fully realized was the show's \"overarching\" theme, \"Beyonce meant to represent herself as a split personality, tender and open on the one hand, indomitable and rather scary on the other. But Beyonce has chosen the wrong dichotomy to represent herself.\"\n\nTickets for the American leg of the tour were available for pre-sale for members of Knowles' fan club on April 20, 2008 and the official tickets went on sale to the general public through Ticketmaster on April 25. In late May 2009, Knowles' label announced through a press release that the singer decided to set aside 2,000 seats for each date on her then-forthcoming North American tour at a discounted price of $20. After already selling 1,000 tickets per show for the special low price, the last 1,000 discounted seats for each show were made available to the public on May 29, 2009 through Ticketmaster (with the exception of the artist's four-night residency at the Encore at Wynn Las Vegas). Due to the big demand, Sony Music announced additional dates in England, Asia and South America. In May 2009, Knowles' official website was peppered with requests by disappointed fans — from Boston; Anchorage, Alaska; Tampa, Florida; St. Louis and Montreal — who asked from her to come to their towns. The \"Daily Mail\" reported that the first European leg of the tour sold over 350,000 tickets for 32 shows; the UK part of the leg sold out completely with Knowles playing to over 100,000 fans. Knowles broke her record of concert attendees by selling out the Morumbi Stadium in São Paulo, Brazil, with over 60,000 tickets sold. It was reported to \"Billboard\" that as of September 16, 2009, from the 53 shows, Knowles grossed $53.5 million and drawn 667,509 fans from the mostly 15,000-seat arenas. In 2009, the tour was nominated for Eventful Fans' Choice Award at the 6th Annual Billboard Touring Awards. The tour grossed $86 million from 93 concert shows and 108 show total grossed $119,5 million.\n\nIn September 2009, it was announced by the Associated Press that Knowles would be bringing her show to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on October 25, 2009, but it would be without some of her usual tricks. After encountering what became familiar opposition from religious groups in a predominantly Muslim country, Knowles agreed to tone down some parts of her act. A spokesperson for the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party stated: \"We are against Western sexy performances; we don't think our people need that.\" However, a rep soon came from the concert's Malaysian organizer, stating that \"all parties have reached an amicable understanding\" about the performance. He went on saying that Knowles should be regarded as a \"role model\" and an \"embodiment of success\" because of her philanthropic work, including campaigns against poverty and domestic violence. The Marctensia promoter further told the Associated Press: \"We are confident that Beyoncé's concert will once and for all silence international critics and put Malaysia back on track and move up the ranks in presenting A-list international pop concerts in this region and further boost tourism.\"\n\nHowever, it was ultimately announced in October 2009 that the concert has been postponed in the wake of accusations by Islamic conservatives that the show would be \"immoral and unclean\". Malaysian promoter Marctensia said in a statement that the show has been postponed to a future date to be announced shortly, and added \"The postponement is solely [the] decision of the artist and has nothing to with other external reasons.\" Another representative declined to comment on whether the show was postponed due to the heavy criticism it was receiving from religious leaders in the country. The show also faced oppositions by Islamic conservatives in Egypt who branded it as an \"insolent sex party\" that threatens the Muslim nation's \"social peace and stability\" and tried to encourage people against going to the concert. Two years prior to the performance, Knowles scheduled a show in Malaysia but backed out due to similar protests regarding her performance.\n\nWhile Knowles was on tour, she was asked to perform a Las Vegas residency-type of show. Knowles and her team produced the shows in seven days and entitled it I Am... Yours. She performed an unplugged, acoustic styled show different from the rest of her tour, at the Encore Theater in Las Vegas. The show on August 2, 2009 was recorded and later released as a DVD, audio CD and television special in late November 2009 titled \"\". The DVD was commercially successful peaking at number one on the Nielsen SoundScan Music DVD chart. It was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Another live CD/DVD of the tour was released as \"I Am... World Tour\" in late November 2010. The album contained performances from different stops of the tour blended with personal footage of Knowles' backstage work and thoughts about the tour and her life. It served as the directorial debut for Knowles. The DVD was commercially successful becoming the best selling DVD in the world in 2010.\n\nParts of the show in Vancouver on March 31, 2009 were recorded and have been used for commercial use, as well as photos from the show used in the official tour book and other promotional items. \"If I Were A Boy\" and \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" from the show in New Orleans were recorded and shown on TV One as a part of the Essence Music Festival in 2009. A CD and DVD, released on June 15, 2010, featured her performance of \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\". \"Crazy In Love\", \"Freakum Dress\", \"Get Me Bodied\", \"Smash Into You\" and \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" from the show in Donetsk, Ukraine, were recorded professionally and shown on TRK Ukraina as part of their footage of the Donbass Arena opening. \"Crazy In Love\" and \"Single Ladies\" were professionally recorded at the Summer Sonic Festival in Osaka, Japan and used to promote Knowles' Japanese tour. \"Crazy In Love\" and \"Naughty Girl\" were also professionally recorded at the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix F1 Rocks event in Singapore for Channel HD 5 Live coverage. \"Crazy In Love\" was recorded professionally and shown on Frecuencia Latina from the show in Lima, Peru at the Explanada del Estadio Monumental.\n\nThe following set list is representative of the show on June 21, 2009.

{"id": "19717225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19717225", "title": "Manic Pixie Dream Girl", "text": "Manic Pixie Dream Girl\n\nManic Pixie Dream Girl (MPDG) is a stock character type in films. Film critic Nathan Rabin, who coined the term after observing Kirsten Dunst's character in \"Elizabethtown\" (2005), said that the MPDG \"exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer-directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures.\" MPDGs are said to help their men without pursuing their own happiness, and such characters never grow up; thus, their men never grow up.\n\nThe Manic Pixie Dream Girl has been compared to another stock character, the Magical Negro, a black character who seems to exist only to provide spiritual or mystical help to the white savior protagonist. In both cases, the stock character has no discernible inner life, and usually only exists to provide the protagonist some important life lessons.\n\nMPDGs are usually static characters who have eccentric personality quirks and are unabashedly girlish. They invariably serve as the romantic interest for a (most often brooding or depressed) male protagonist. Examples of an MPDG are described below:\n\n\nIn an interview with Vulture, the entertainment section of \"New York\", about her film \"Ruby Sparks\", actress and screenwriter Zoe Kazan criticized the term as reductive, diminutive, and misogynistic. She disagreed that Hepburn's character in \"Bringing Up Baby\" is a MPDG: \"I think that to lump together all individual, original quirky women under that rubric is to erase all difference.\"\n\nIn a December 2012 video, AllMovie critic Cammila Collar embraced the term as an effective description of one-dimensional female characters who only seek the happiness of the male protagonist, and who do not deal with any complex issues of their own. The pejorative use of the term, then, is mainly directed at writers who do not give these female characters more to do than bolster the spirits of their male partners.\n\nIn December 2012, \"Slate\"s Aisha Harris posited that \"critiques of the MPDG may have become more common than the archetype itself\", suggesting that filmmakers had been forced to become \"self-aware about such characters\" in the years since Rabin's coining of the phrase and that the trope had largely disappeared from film.\n\nIn July 2013, Kat Stoeffel, for \"The Cut\", argued that the term itself had become sexist, citing her opinion that \"it was levied, criminally at Diane Keaton in \"Annie Hall\" and Zooey Deschanel, the actual person. \"How could a real person's defining trait be a lack of interior life?\"\"\"\n\nSimilar sentiments were elucidated by Monika Bartyzel for \"The Week\" in April 2013, who wrote \"this once-useful piece of critical shorthand has devolved into laziness and sexism\". Bartyzel argues that \"[The term] 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' was useful when it commented on the superficiality of female characterizations in male dominated journeys, but it has since devolved into a pejorative way to deride unique women in fiction and reality.\"\n\nIn July 2014, for \"Salon\", Rabin prompted a retraction of the term \"Manic Pixie Dream Girl\". He argued that in \"giving an idea a fuzzy definition\", he inadvertently gave the phrase power it was not intended to have. The trope's popularity, Rabin suggested, led to discussions of a more precise definition, a reduction of the critic's all-encompassing classification of MPDG. While he coined the term to expose the sexist implications in modern culture, the \"phrase was increasingly accused of being sexist itself\". Backlash occurred when many well-loved female characters were placed under this trope. In response, Rabin suggested that nuanced characters cannot be classified in such a restricted nature, and thus he apologized to pop culture for \"creating this unstoppable monster\".\n\nRecently there has been discussion of a male version of this trope, the Manic Pixie Dream Boy or Manic Pixie Dream Guy. Augustus Waters from the film version of \"The Fault in Our Stars\" (2014) was given this title in a 2014 \"Vulture\" article, in which Matt Patches stated, \"he's a bad boy, he's a sweetheart, he's a dumb jock, he's a nerd, he's a philosopher, he's a poet, he's a victim, he's a survivor, he's everything everyone wants in their lives, and he's a fallacious notion of what we can \"actually\" have in our lives.\"\n\nThe Manic Pixie Dream Boy trope has also been pointed out in sitcoms such as \"Parks and Recreation\" and \"30 Rock\". The female protagonists of these shows are married to men (Adam Scott's Ben Wyatt and James Marsden's Criss Chros, respectively), who, according to a 2012 \"Grantland\" article, \"patiently [tamp] down her stubbornness and temper while appreciating her quirks, helping her to become her best possible self\".\n\nThe character Jesse, played by Skylar Astin, in the film \"Pitch Perfect\" (2012) embodies the Manic Pixie Dream Boy trope. His role in the film appears to be to coax the very serious character Beca, played by Anna Kendrick, out of her gloom and embrace life to the fullest. He has no backstory of his own, and no major goals of his own in the context of the film. According to an article on Ohio State's Entertainment News site.\n\nAnother version of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl is the algorithm-defined fantasy girl. The difference is that the latter is not human, but a robot or artificial intelligence of some sort. The function is the same one: to fulfill the desires of the male character and to help him in his journey without having any desires or journey of her own. Some examples are: Joi in \"Blade Runner 2049\" and Samantha in Spike Jonze's \"Her\".\n\n"}

The festival gather storytellers or cuentacuentos from around the world who narrate uninterruptedly stories over the weekend. Started in 1992, the Maratón de los Cuentos of Guadalajara is celebrated every year since then. It reached its twentieth edition in 2011 achieving 46 hours of storytelling without interruption. It brings together 200 volunteers who help develop more than 70 activities.\n\nThe Marathon was born as one of the projects created by Blanca Calvo, director of the Library of Guadalajara, when in 1982 she promoted the Seminary of Children and Youth Literature of Guadalajara, which in addition to the Marathon organized the National Encounters of Animation of Reading between 1984-1996\n\nThe first edition was held on April 23, 1992 as part of the activities program of the Guadalajara Book Fair, which included oral narration. That first edition lasted 24 hours, from 12 noon on Friday to 12 on Saturday, with the goal in turn to enter the Guinness Book of Records. In this marathon participated personalities such as Antonio Buero Vallejo and José Luis Sampedro.\nIn 1993 the Marathon was held for the first time in the palace of the Infantado and reached 36 and a half hours.\n\nSince then, and thanks to the collaboration of the Seminary of Children and Youth Literature of Guadalajara, it ended up defining what is now known as the \"Marathon of the Tales of Guadalajara\", which takes place in the courtyard of the Lions of the Palace of Infantado uninterrupted during the weekend.\n\nIn 2016 the festival reached a quarter of a century by telling stories and it is considered as the largest festival of oral narration, aimed at children and adults, adolescents, storytellers and curious in general and known as the world capital of the story.\nAfter 25 years, the festival declared to be working to be part of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity granted by UNESCO.\n\nThe palace of the Infantado de Guadalajara has hosted the event since 1993 and is specially decorated for the occasion. Inside, in the Patio de los Leones, the main courtyard, the marathon of oral narration is developed as well as the marathon of illustration, and in the hall, a smaller courtyard at the entrance of the Palacio del Infantado is told stories by more accountants novices or more timid. The entrance hall also houses the main story marathon in case of bad weather, since this courtyard is interior which allows the marathon not to be suspended until its program ends on Sunday, when the concert of the end of the Marathon, also developed in the hall of the palace of the Infantado.\n\nThe gardens of the Palace of the Infantado host some activities, although mainly there are several stalls where you can buy books or stalls where you can buy traditional products or have tea. Also in front of the Palacio del Infantado are some stalls with the same objective, as well as activities and shows at different times.\n\nThe Plaza del Jardinillo de Guadalajara and the Plaza Mayor de Guadalajara as well as the main street also tend to host some activities and shows.\n\nAmong the locations of the event have also included the Chinese Hall of the Cotilla Palace, the Palace of Antonio de Mendoza (Liceo Caracense) or the crypt of the Church of San Francisco.\n\nAll locations participating in the event are decorated for the occasion.\n\nThere are different activities that are performed in parallel to the Maratón de los Cuentos, like the oral narration marathon, the illustration, radio and photography marathons.\n\nMultitude of professional and non-professional storytellers participate during the event telling stories, either alone or accompanied, with or without musical accompaniment, singing or narrating, interpreting history without more, dressed especially for it or even camouflaged behind puppets or puppets, any option is possible.\n\nDifferent illustrators from around the world are responsible for putting on paper the stories that storytellers are narrating during the weekend. The illustrations are hung in one of the corners of the patio of the lions of the palace of the Infantado so that all can approach to see them.\n\nThe illustrators also participate creating the poster of the event each year, which will serve to promote the same serving as an image for posters, shirts and badges in each edition.\n\nThe Photographic Group of Guadalajara makes this photographic follow-up creating an annual archive of the celebration and providing a souvenir to each participant of the Marathon.\n\nRadio retransmission of the stories through Radio Arrebato, both by radio frequency and online at www.radioarrebato.net.\n\nSince 2002, and depending on the year, the music marathon is performed simultaneously in the gardens of the Infantado Palace.\n\n\nThe Friday of the stories is not included in the festival program, but it completes the story marathon by developing oral storytelling sessions for adults from October to May, including filandón on two of the Fridays during this period, reaching its 21st edition in 2017.\n\nEach year, the Maratón de los Cuentos assigns a theme that gives rise to a theme of the edition:\n\n\n"}

They hunt deer and bear, and their culture has much in common with the bear worship of the Ainu. They live in small hamlets of the mountain beech forests of Tōhoku and engage in agriculture during the planting and harvest season. In the winter and early spring, they form hunting bands that spend weeks at a time in the forest. With the introduction of guns in the 20th century, the need for group hunting for bear has diminished, leading to a decline in Matagi culture. \n\nMatagi hamlets are found in the districts of Nishitsugaru and Nakatsugaru (Aomori Prefecture), Kitaakita and Senboku (Akita Prefecture), Waga (Iwate Prefecture), Nishiokitama and Tsuruoka (Yamagata Prefecture), Murakami and Nakauonuma (Niigata Prefecture and Nagano Prefecture). \n\nThe Matagi are attested from the medieval period but continue to hunt today. They have come into conflict with environmentalists now that the forest has been partly cleared. They no longer hunt the Japanese serow, which is protected, but continue to hunt bear. Matagi hunt by special license.\n\nSpecialised Matagi hunting vocabulary contains Ainu words. Indeed, the word \"matagi\" itself may be Ainu, from \"matangi\" or \"matangitono\", \"man of winter, hunter\".\n\nMatagi are referenced and described in the biographical novel \"\" by Martha Sherrill, alongside descriptions of a real modern day Matagi named Uesugi, who was a friend of the main characters who helped preserve the Akita breed of dog, which they used extensively for hunting.\n"}
{"id": "1545316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1545316", "title": "Memoria", "text": "Memoria\n\nMemoria was the term for aspects involving memory in Western classical rhetoric. The word is Latin, and can be translated as \"memory\".\n\nIt was one of five canons in classical rhetoric (the others being inventio, dispositio, elocutio, and pronuntiatio) concerned with the crafting and delivery of speeches and prose.\n\nThe art of rhetoric grew out of oratory, which was the central medium for intellectual and political life in ancient Greece. Legal proceedings, political debates, philosophical inquiry were all conducted through spoken discourse. Many of the great texts from that age were not written texts penned by the authors we associate them with, but were instead orations written down by followers and students. In Roman times, while there was a much greater body of written work, oration was still the medium\nfor critical debate. Unlike public speakers of today, who use notes or who read their speeches, good orators were expected to deliver their speeches without such aids.\n\n\"Memoria\" was the discipline of recalling the arguments of a discourse. It generally received less attention from writers than \nother parts of rhetoric, as there is less to be said about the subject. However, the need to memorize speeches did influence the structure of discourse to some extent. For example, as part of \"dispositio\", some attention was paid to creating structures (such as the \"divisio\", an outline of the major arguments of a discourse) that would also aid memory. Some writers also discussed the use of various mnemonic devices to assist speakers.\n\nBut rhetoricians also viewed \"memoria\" as requiring more than just rote memorization. Rather, the orator also had to have at his command a wide body of knowledge to permit improvisation, to respond to questions, and to refute opposing arguments. Where today's speech-making tends to be a staged, one-way affair, in former times, much oration occurred as part of debates, dialogues, and other settings, in which orators had to react to others. Moreover, rhetoricians also recognized that the credibility of a speaker depended not just on the strength of his prepared arguments, but on the audience's perceptions of the speaker. In Greece, Rome, and the Renaissance, a speaker's familiarity of many areas of learning was seen as a virtue.\n\nWhen the Humanists took up the ideas on memory found the writings of Classical authors, memoria played an important role in the pedagogical system. Texts were learned first by rote memorization, then re-read for meaning. Children's ability to memorize was aided by \"memory tables\", which were first available in manuscript form, and were, from the 1470s onwards, some of the first products of the printing press. (Source: Paul Gehl, \"A Moral Art: Grammar, Society, and Culture in Trecento Florence\" (1993)\n\nMemory, the fourth canon of rhetoric, and invention, the first canon, are connected. The ad Herennium states that memory is the “treasury of things invented”, indirectly referring to the custom of accumulating commonplaces. Hence, for a rhetor, memory is as much related to the need to extemporize as to the necessity to memorize a discourse for delivery; in this way it is linked to kairos and to the ideas of and amplification (Burton).\n\nCrowley and Hawhee state about memory and kairos, \"... kairos and memory were partnered in several ways. First, both require a kind of 'attunement' in that the rhetor who is gathering items for reserve in the memory must be thinking simultaneously about what's available now that might be useful later. Secondly, memory requires an attunement during the moment of speaking or composing, a recognition of the right time for recalling an illustrative example, an argument, and so on\" (317).\n\nAncient peoples used elaborate systems, such as the Method of Loci, to store large amounts of information in their memories. Today, we use literate and electronic memory systems. Literate memory systems include books, periodicals, and libraries. Electronic systems include computers, databases, computer software, the World Wide Web, and other artificial memory devices (Crowley and Hawhee 325-28).\n\nMemorizing One's Speech\nCenturies ago, ancient orators had to memorize and present speeches without the help of note cards or crib sheets. Note taking, as a way to remember certain things, was looked down upon in ancient cultures. In his Phaedrus, Plato has Socrates explaining that relying on writing or taking notes weakened the mind and memory:\n\n\"If men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls: they will cease to exercise memory because they rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves\"\n\nAny Greek in Ancient times who was caught using the note-taking method would be laughed at and deemed \"weak-minded\". Nowadays, it is much more common for speakers to use note cards, though speeches are much more impressive without the use of notes.\nUsing memory during a speech can also affect how the orator influences the audience. When the speaker addresses the audiences relying solely on their memory, they build a certain amount of ethos within the relationship. Memoria in relation to ethos during a speech situation can be described as a certain amount trustworthiness felt between the audience, as well as a level of similarity, authority, or expertise that the orator has over the audience. Unlike Ancient Greece, in today's society, it is much more acceptable for politicians and for people of authority to use aids when delivering addresses. Although it could be viewed as an aid to use notes or teleprompters, greater importance is placed on actually conveying the information to the audience in a clear and concise manner.\n\nMaking One's Speech Memorable\nFor ancient orators, the excellence of how a speech was presented was more important than the simple delivery of the speech. An important feature of delivering a speech was finding ways to make one's audience remember one's speech topic. One had to be sure to one's audience learned the information or ideas presented to it.\n\nKeeping a Treasury of Rhetorical Fodder\nThe third element of memory has to do with using quotes, facts, or anecdotes that could be used in future speeches. A professional orator is known to always have a treasury of rhetorical fodder close at all times.\n\n\n"}

The biggest wedding of the three (Price and Andre) was covered over two bumper issues.\n\nThe same happened for the wedding of Ashley and Cheryl Cole, as well as Christina Aguilera's. \"OK!\" devoted an issue to photos of Tony Parker and Eva Longoria's wedding.\n\nOther weddings covered by \"OK!\" are:\n\nPrior to Jade Goody's cancer-related death in March 2009, \"OK!\" sparked controversy by publishing an \"Official Tribute Issue\" with the front-page captions \"In Loving Memory\" and \"1981-2009,\" even though Goody was still alive when the issue went to press.\n\nIn June 2009, \"OK!\" ran another tribute issue, this time for Michael Jackson. The publication had paid a reported $500,000 for images of Jackson's body being retrieved after his death. The cover photo showed a deceased Jackson on a stretcher, in a neck brace and with an oxygen mask. \"It’s a photo that captures the surprise and the upset and the moment of this breaking news story,\" Sarah Ivens, the magazine's editorial director, said. \"I hope the cover will provoke readers.\" \n\nIn 2010, the magazine faced more criticism after running a cover story on Kourtney Kardashian's pregnancy. It published a cover photo of Kardashian holding her son, Mason, and claimed to feature an exclusive interview revealing the secrets to her weight loss. Kardashian tweeted in response, \"One of those weeklies got it wrong again…they didn’t have an exclusive with me. And I gained 40 pounds [18 kg] while pregs, not 26 [12 kg]…But thanks!\" She also alleged that the body on the cover was not hers, and that \"OK!\" had Photoshopped her face onto someone else's body.\n\n\"OK!\" came under fire again in July 2013 when it published an issue featuring Kate Middleton on the same day she left the hospital after giving birth to Prince George. The front cover of the 30 July issue advertised \"Kate's Post-Baby Weight Loss Regime\" and an \"exclusive interview\" with Middleton's trainer, who claimed that \"[Kate's] stomach will shrink straight back\" to its previous size. The story sparked backlash on Twitter when English TV presenter Katy Hill tweeted a photo of her own postpartum body and urged fellow mothers to boycott the magazine. Hill gained support from other women who believed that the story had been posted too soon after Middleton gave birth and felt that \"OK!\" was \"pressuring new moms to instantly lose the baby weight.\" The magazine's parent company, Northern & Shell, later issued an apology in a statement published in \"The Guardian\": \"Kate is one of the great beauties of our age and \"OK!\" readers love her. Like the rest of the world, we were very moved by her radiance as she and William introduced the Prince of Cambridge to the world. We would not dream of being critical of her appearance.

Similar games are German Schlagball, Russian lapta and Romanian oină.\nIn his book \"God's Playground\" Norman Davies suggests that the popular US game, baseball, may have developed from Palant played by the first Polish immigrants such as Jamestown Polish craftsmen.\n\nThe players are divided into two teams of 7 to 15 players. The playing field is 25 by 60 meters in size, and the wooden stick has 60–88 centimeters in length. You have to draw the \"heaven\" and \"hell\" fields.

{"id": "42797521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42797521", "title": "Pi (film)", "text": "Pi (film)\n\nPi (stylized as ) is a 1998 American psychological thriller film written and directed by Darren Aronofsky in his directorial debut. \"Pi\" was filmed on high-contrast black-and-white reversal film and earned Aronofsky the Directing Award at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay and the Gotham Open Palm Award. \n\nThe title refers to the mathematical constant pi. The film is notable for its covering of an array of themes including religion, mysticism and the relationship of the universe to mathematics.\n\nThe story is about a mathematician and the obsession with mathematical regularity contrasts two seemingly irreconcilable entities: the imperfect, irrational humanity and the rigor and regularity of mathematics, specifically number theory.\n\nUnemployed and living in a drab Chinatown apartment in New York City, Max Cohen is a number theorist who believes that everything in nature can be understood through numbers. Max suffers from cluster headaches, as well as extreme paranoia, hallucinations, and social anxiety disorder. His only social interactions are with Jenna, a young girl fascinated with his ability to mentally do complex calculations; Devi, a young woman living next door; and Sol Robeson, his old mathematics mentor who is now an invalid.\n\nMax tries to program his computer, Euclid, to make stock predictions. Euclid malfunctions, prints out a seemingly random 216-digit number, as well as a single pick at one-tenth its current value, then crashes. Disgusted, Max throws away the printout. The next morning, he finds out that the pick Euclid made was accurate. He searches desperately but cannot find the printout. When he mentions the number, Sol becomes unnerved and asks if it contained 216 digits. When Max questions him about the number, Sol indicates that he came across it many years ago. He urges Max to slow down and take a break.\n\nAt a coffee shop he frequents, Max meets Lenny Meyer, a Hasidic Jew who does mathematical research on the Torah. Lenny demonstrates some simple Gematria, the correspondence of the Hebrew alphabet to numbers, and explains how some people believe that the Torah is a string of numbers that form a code sent by God. Max is intrigued, noting some of the concepts are similar to other mathematical concepts such as the Fibonacci sequence. Max is also approached by agents of a Wall Street firm. One of the agents, Marcy Dawson, offers Max a classified computer chip called \"Ming Mecca\" in exchange for the results of his work.\n\nUsing the Ming Mecca chip, Max has Euclid analyze mathematical patterns in the Torah. Once again, Euclid shows the 216-digit number on the screen before crashing. As Max begins to write down the number, he realizes that he knows the pattern, undergoes a sudden epiphany, and passes out. After waking up, Max appears to become clairvoyant and is able to visualize the stock market patterns he had been searching for. However, his headaches also increase in intensity, and he discovers a strange vein-like bulge protruding from his right temple. Max has a falling out with Sol after the latter urges him to quit his work.\n\nOne evening, Dawson and her agents grab Max on the street and try to force him to explain the number. They had found the original printout Max threw away. In an attempt to use it to manipulate the stock market, the firm caused the market to crash instead. Lenny drives by and helps Max get away. However, Lenny takes Max to his companions at a nearby synagogue. They ask Max to give them the 216-digit number, believing it was meant for them to bring about the messianic age, as the number represents the unspeakable name of God. Max refuses, insisting that whatever the source of the number is, it has been revealed to him alone.\n\nMax flees and visits Sol, only to find out he recently died from another stroke, and finds a piece of paper with the number in his study. Back in his own apartment, Max experiences another headache, but does not take his painkillers. Driven to the brink of madness, he destroys part of Euclid. Believing that the number and the headaches are linked, Max tries to concentrate on the number through the pain. After passing out, Max has a vision of himself standing in a white void and repeating the digits of the number. The vision ends with Max hugging Devi, who turns out to be a hallucination. Standing alone in his trashed apartment, Max burns the paper with the number and blithely performs an impromptu trepanning on himself with an inadequate cranial drill.\n\nSome time later, Jenna approaches Max in a park and asks him to do several calculations, including 748 ÷ 238 (an approximation for pi) Max smiles and says that he doesn't know the answer to them. He sits on the bench and watches the trees blowing in the breeze, seemingly at peace.\n\n\nProduced on a $68,000 budget, the film was financially successful at the box office, grossing $3,221,152 in the United States despite only a limited theatrical release. It has sold steadily on DVD. \"Pi\" was the first ever film to be made available for download on the Internet.\n\nThe film was well received. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 88% approval rating based on 56 reviews with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Dramatically gripping and frighteningly smart, this Lynchian thriller does wonders with its unlikely subject and shoestring budget.\" On Metacritic, the film has a rating of 72 out of 100 based on 23 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars out of four, writing: \"\"Pi\" is a thriller. I am not very thrilled these days by whether the bad guys will get shot or the chase scene will end one way instead of another. You have to make a movie like that pretty skillfully before I care. But I am thrilled when a man risks his mind in the pursuit of a dangerous obsession.\" James Berardinelli gave the film three out of four stars, writing: \"[\"Pi\"] transports us to a world that is like yet unlike our own, and, in its mysterious familiarity, is eerie, intense, and compelling. Reality is a fragile commodity, but, because the script is well-written and the central character is strongly developed, it's not hard to suspend disbelief...It probably deserves 3.1416 stars, but since my scale doesn't support that, I'll round it off to three.\"\n\n\"Pi\" features multiple references to mathematics and mathematical theories. For instance, Max finds the golden spiral occurring everywhere, including the stock market. Max's belief that diverse systems embodying highly nonlinear dynamics share a unifying pattern bears much similarity to results in chaos theory, which provides machinery for describing certain phenomena of nonlinear systems, which might be thought of as patterns. During the climactic drill scene, a pattern resembling a bifurcation diagram is apparent on Max's shattered mirror.\n\nIn the film, Max periodically plays Go with his mentor, Sol. This game has historically stimulated the study of mathematics and features a simple set of rules that results in a complex game strategy. The two characters each use the game as a model for their view of the universe; Sol says that the game is a microcosm of an extremely complex and chaotic world, while Max asserts its complexity gradually converges toward patterns that can be found.\n\nBoth Gullette and Margolis spent many hours learning the game at the Brooklyn Go Club, and had the help of a Go consultant, Dan Weiner, for the film. The film credits list Barbara Calhoun, Michael Solomon and Dan Wiener as Go consultants.\n\nEarly in the film, when Lenny begins talking with Max about his work, he asks if Max is familiar with kabbalah. The numerological interpretation of the Torah and the 216-letter name of God, known as the Shem HaMeforash, are important concepts in traditional Jewish mysticism.\n\nAnother religious reference is when Max is in the market looking for today's newspaper, there is a recitation from Quran, in the background, citing Quran 2:140: \"Or do you say that Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Descendants were Jews or Christians? Say, \"Are you more knowing or is Allah?\" And who is more unjust than one who conceals a testimony he has from Allah? And Allah is not unaware of what you do.\"\n\n\"Pi\" launched the film scoring career of Clint Mansell. The soundtrack was released on July 21, 1998, via Thrive Records. \"Allmusic\" rated it 4.5 stars out of five. A music video for \"πr²\", using an alternative mix of the title track, is available as a special feature on the \"π\" DVD, consisting of footage from the film intercut with stock color reels of ants, harking back to one of the film's visual motifs.\n\n\n\n"}

As with all \"Power Rangers\" series, the show is adapted from a series in the long-running Japanese tokusatsu franchise.\n\nThe series officially premiered on February 20, 2006 on Toon Disney / Jetix, February 25, 2006 on ABC Family, March 11, 2006 on ABC as part of the ABC Kids programming block and on June 4, 2006 on Family in Canada, on October 2, 2006 on Jetix in India, October 21, 2006 on Jetix in the United Kingdom. The show was also broadcast on Sunday morning on ITV1 and the CITV Channel under the GMTV Toonattik slot in April 1, 2007. In the Philippines it premiered on October 6, 2007 in Cartoon Network's \"Toonami\" slot. It was also the last season to air on ABC Family, when the channel dropped Jetix on August 31, 2006.\n\n\"Power Rangers Mystic Force\" is the first and only Disney-produced \"Power Rangers\" series to feature the main villain from its \"Super Sentai\" counterpart, and is the first of the Disney-produced \"Power Rangers\" series in which all the actors playing the five core Rangers are of Australian or New Zealander descent (the casts of the three Disney-produced \"Power Rangers\" series prior to \"Mystic Force\" had at least one Ranger actor of North American descent). This is also the second Power Rangers season to not have an African American Ranger similar to \"Ninja Storm\" and the change of actors from North American to Australian or New Zealander descent. \n\nIt is also the only \"Power Rangers\" series in which the Rangers wear capes. This is the second Disney series that does not have a teamup with the previous season's rangers. The first was \"Power Rangers Ninja Storm\". In Mystic Force's case, the missing crossover would have been with \"Power Rangers S.P.D.\" However, a character from that series, Piggy cameoed in the episode \"Ranger Down\". Xander Bly later returned for the \"Operation Overdrive\" 15th anniversary special \"Once a Ranger\", teaming up with former Rangers including Bridge Carson from \"S.P.D.\".\n\n200 years ago, in a magic-filled dimension parallel world, the forces of darkness came into power and a war called the \"Great Battle\" between good and evil began, unbeknownst to the citizens of the human world. An army of the monsters, led by a powerful warrior named Morticon, swarmed into the land with their sights set on taking over the magical realm, the human realm and beyond. In the midst, they combat five wizards, who pushed back against the dark forces. The strongest wizard of all, Leanbow, cast a spell and sent the evil warriors into the Underworld, having the Gatekeeper seal the gates for all eternity. The forces of truth successfully thwarted the dark forces' attempt to take the surface world, but they lost the five wizards, including Leanbow, who sealed himself on their side of the Gate to make sure the evil forces did not escape.\n\nIn the present day, the city of Briarwood was struck by an earthquake, which was just enough to crack the seal, allowing evil to renew its attempt to invade the earth. The sorceress Udonna, realizing that the forces of evil had returned, sought out the warriors of legend, five teens living in Briarwood, to become the Power Rangers alongside her. While one of the teens was reluctant at first, he realized his destiny and joined the others in the fight against the Master of the Underworld and his numerous minions. \n\nWhen Udonna loses her Ranger powers to the mysterious Koragg, it is up to Nick, Chip, Xander and sisters Madison and Vida, to save the Earth on their own. They are assisted by Udonna's bumbling apprentice, Clare, and eventually Jenji the Genie and his master Daggeron, the Solaris Knight.\n\nUsing their powerful magic and incredible martial arts skills, the Mystic Force Power Rangers must rely on teamwork to save the day. Later, in a shocking surprise, it is revealed that Koragg is none other than Leanbow, the greatest and strongest of the five original wizards. The good power that was taken from Udonna helps Koragg turn back to his normal self, and he uses his powers to transform into the most powerful defender of truth, the Wolf Warrior. In the end, Leanbow and Daggeron are supposedly killed in a battle with the evil master and the rangers lose their magical powers for initially destroying the Evil Master's body. After this, Necrolai turns good and with the help of a good monster from Evil Master's team destroys the more powerful minion of the Master. She then revives Leanbow and Daggeron, sacrificing her powers in the process and turning into a normal woman. After that the people of Briarwood, and the creatures who live in the forest, join with the rangers and transfer their good faith to the rangers, thus returning them their power. The rangers then destroy the Master, after which Nick, Udonna and Leanbow leave Briarwood to meet Nick's adoptive parents. Nick gives Madison his red baby blanket to hold onto as a promise that he would return for her, implying that there \"could\" be a romantic relationship between them in the future.\n\nMystic Force Rangers\n\n\nAdditional Rangers\n\nAllies\n\nVillains\n\n"}

It may be an informal theatrical production, with costumed participants, often including children.\n\nIn modern use, a Purim Spiel is also the use of satire or humor in publishing a \"fake\" newspaper article, blog post, television news segment, etc. during the Hebrew month of Adar.\n\nBy the 18th century in eastern Romania and some other parts of Eastern Europe, Purim plays (called \"Purimshpiln\", ) had evolved into broad-ranging satires with music and dance, precursors to Yiddish theater, for which the story of Esther was little more than a pretext: indeed, by the mid-19th century, some were even based on other stories, such as Joseph sold by his brothers, Daniel, or the Binding of Isaac. Since satire was deemed inappropriate for the synagogue itself, they were usually performed outdoors in its court. Purimspiels are still performed in many communities. In France, Purim plays continue to be widely performed, particularly in active Ashkenazi communities. \n\nA favorite form of a Purim Spiel for children is enacted in puppet shows with the Purim characters and their antics making the children laugh.\n\nThe festival of Purim, which recalls the events of the Book of Esther, features characters whose identity, natures, or intent are \"hidden.\" In fact, although the miraculous survival of the Persian Jews in the Book of Esther is due to God's intervention, God's name never appears in the Book of Esther. In the Book of Esther, the decree of the wicked Haman was annulled and the Jewish people living in the ancient Persian Empire were saved from the edict of death and genocide instigated against them by Haman.\n"}

{"id": "2916196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2916196", "title": "Shigin", "text": "Shigin\n\nShigin () is a performance of reciting a Japanese poem or a Chinese poem read in Japanese, each poem ( = \"shi\") usually chanted ( = \"gin\") by an individual or in a group. Reciting can be done loudly before a large audience, softly to a few friends, or quietly to the reciter himself or herself.\n\nEach reciting is also termed \"gin\". Any forms of Japanese and Chinese poetry are used for reciting.\n\nKanshi and classical Chinese poems are usually composed of four or more lines of Chinese characters, or kanji (漢字), each line having the same number of characters. \"Gin\" with four phrases, each seven characters long (the most common), are classified as . There is strictly only one standard melody, although many poems will be distinguished by minor variations from this theme.\n\nMembers of a shigin group will usually gather to train in a washitsu, or Japanese-style room with tatami matting. Participants kneel in the lotus or seiza position, thought to be the optimum posture to allow strong and steady projection during chanting. They are encouraged to focus their energy in their gut (thought in Zen to be the locus of power) and sing by slowly expelling this energy. Conversely, singing from the chest, as would be encouraged in classical Western operatic style, is deemed unauthentic.\n\nDuring practice, members may refer to the written \"gin\" to aid memory. This is usually annotated, with marks to the right of each character denoting how the tone should vary through the length of its vocalisation.\n\nBreathing intervals are indicated by right-angular strokes to the left of the character (a typical \"gin\" will last approximately one and a half minutes, in four breaths). Finally, because Japanese and Chinese word orders differ, further (sino) numerical marks to the left of some characters indicate their correct sequence.\n\n\"Gin\" are formally performed standing, and from memory. Because of this, recital of longer \"gin\" is sometimes seen as more accomplished (being harder to remember, and more likely to vary from the standard melodic form). The vocal may be accompanied by traditional Japanese instruments such as the Koto or Shakuhachi. Dress may be Western (suit) or traditional (kimono or yukata).\n\n\"Gin\" are also used in the performance of certain Japanese dances, such as kenshibu. In such cases, \"gin\" may either be performed live or played from recordings.\n\nShigin are thought to have originated in China early in the first millennium AD, and may have entered Japan amongst other texts brought back from China in the 5th century. They were most likely sung originally in Chinese, but were later given Japanese readings, which are used in their contemporary recital. New gin were written, often detailing particular Japanese concepts or events, but the standard written layout has remained.\n\nShigin are thus significantly older than other, more popular Japanese poetry forms, such as Haiku. Their practice is now a minority art, mostly confined to the elderly and little known amongst younger generations. Nevertheless, several Shigin festivals are held throughout the year, including the Autumn Shigin Festival (秋吟会) in Shiogama and Shinjo, in the North-East (Tōhoku) region of Japan. \"Gin\" are also sung at Buddhist ceremonies and quasi-religious gatherings in Japan.\n\nMoreover, although largely in anonymity, Shigin continue to have a significant influence on Japanese culture. Individual poems are often studied in Japanese textbooks, and are regularly displayed at exhibitions of Japanese calligraphy. \n\nFrom 2013 onwards, a Japanese fusion band called Wagakki Band began to be active and quickly became popular nationwide and online. The band incorporates shigin, vocaloid, wagakki (traditional Japanese instruments) and rock elements and the vocalist, , is a shigin master and utilises shigin technique in performances with the ambition to raise interest among the youth and around the world. Some of their songs contain a section of shigin.\n\nThe example below is a tanka about Mount Iwate by Japanese poet Takuboku Ishikawa (1886 – 1912, ), with Japanese pronunciation shown in parentheses\n\nThe second example is a Kanshi poem by Japanese educator Tanso Hirose (1782 – 1856, ), who encouraged his students to live together as well as study together at his institution in Kyushu:\n\nThe third example below illustrates a typical \"gin\" from Chinese poet Zhang Ji (8th century), written in the original Chinese, and in Japanese (as written and pronounced in parentheses):\n\n\"(NB: Subject terms have been added to give a sense to the poem, but no such terms exist in the original Chinese.)\"\n\n\n\n"}

The archetype also became common as a film genre.\n\nA 'swashbuckler' is a protagonist who is heroic and idealistic: he rescues damsels in distress, defends the downtrodden, and in general saves the day. Swashbucklers are not unrepentant brigands or pirates, although some may rise from such disreputable stations in redemption. His opponent is typically characterized as the dastardly villain. There is a long list of swashbucklers who combine outstanding courage, swordfighting skill, resourcefulness, and a distinctive sense of honor and justice, as for example \"Cyrano de Bergerac\", \"The Three Musketeers\", \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\", Robin Hood, and Zorro.\n\n\"Swashbuckler\" is a compound of \"swash\" (archaic: to swagger with a drawn sword) and \"buckler\" (a small shield gripped in the fist) dating from the 16th century.\n\nWhile man-at-arms and sellswords of the era usually wore armor of necessity, their counterparts in later romantic literature and film (see below) often did not, and the term evolved to denote a daring, devil-may-care demeanor rather than brandishment of accoutrements of war, and modern \"swashbuckling\" heroes might not carry swords at all.\n\nSwashbuckling adventures and romances are generally set in Europe from the late Renaissance up through the Age of Reason and the Napoleonic Wars, extending into the colonial era with pirate tales in the Caribbean.\n\nJeffrey Richards traces the swashbuckling novel to the rise of Romanticism, and an outgrowth of the historical novel, particularly those of Sir Walter Scott, \"... medieval tales of chivalry, love and adventure rediscovered in the eighteenth century\". This type of historical novel was further developed by Alexandre Dumas.\n\nJohn Galsworthy said of Robert Louis Stevenson's 1888 swashbuckling romance, \"The Black Arrow\", that it was \"a livelier picture of medieval times than I remember elsewhere in fiction.\" Anthony Hope's 1894, \"The Prisoner of Zenda\" initiated an additional subset of the swashbuckling novel, the Ruritanian romance.\n\nThe perceived significant and widespread role of swordsmanship in civilian society as well as warfare in the Renaissance and Enlightenment periods led to fencing being performed on theatre stages as part of plays. Soon actors were taught to fence in an entertaining, dramatic manner. Eventually fencing became an established part of a classical formation for actors.\n\nConsequently, when movie theaters mushroomed, ambitious actors took the chance to present their accordant skills on the screen. Since silent movies were no proper medium for long dialogues, the classic stories about heroes who would defend their honour with sword in hand were simplified and sheer action would gain priority. This was the birth of a new kind of film hero: the swashbuckler.\n\nFour of the most famous instructors for swashbuckling swordplay are William Hobbs, Anthony De Longis, Bob Anderson and Peter Diamond.\n\nThe larger-than-life heroics portrayed in some film franchise adventures (most notably the \"Indiana Jones\" movies) set in the modern era have been described as swashbuckling.\n\nThe genre has, apart from swordplay, always been characterized by influences that can be traced back to the chivalry tales of Medieval Europe, such as the legends of Robin Hood and King Arthur. It soon created its own drafts based on classic examples like \"The Mark of Zorro\" (1920), \"The Three Musketeers (1921)\", \"Scaramouche (1923)\" and \"The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934)\". Some films did also use motifs of pirate stories. Often these films were adaptations of classic historic novels published by well-known authors such as Alexandre Dumas, Rafael Sabatini, Baroness Emma Orczy, Sir Walter Scott, Johnston McCulley, and Edmond Rostand.\nSwashbucklers are one of the most flamboyant Hollywood film genres, unlike cinema verite or modern realistic filmmaking. The genre attracted large audiences who relished the blend of escapist adventure, historic romance, and daring stunts in cinemas before it became a fixture on TV screens.\n\nAs a first variation of the classic swashbuckler there have also been female swashbucklers. Maureen O'Hara in \"Against All Flags\" and Jean Peters in \"Anne of the Indies\" were very early action film heroines.\n\nEventually the typical swashbuckler motifs were used up because they had so often been shown on TV screens. Later films such as \"The Princess Bride\", the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" series and \"The Mask of Zorro\" include modern takes on the swashbuckler archetype.\n\nTelevision followed the films, especially in the UK, with \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\", \"Sword of Freedom\", \"The Buccaneers\", and \"Willam Tell\" between 1955 and 1960. US TV produced two series of \"Zorro\" in 1957 and 1990. Following the 1998 film \"The Mask of Zorro\", a TV series about a female swashbuckler, the \"Queen of Swords\", aired in 2000.\n\nNotable swashbuckler characters from literature and other media include the following:\n\n\nActors notable for their portrayals of swashbucklers include:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25771130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25771130", "title": "VVVVVV", "text": "VVVVVV\n\nVVVVVV is a 2D puzzle platform video game created by Terry Cavanagh. The game was built in Adobe Flash and released on January 11, 2010, for Microsoft Windows and OS X. The game was ported to C++ by Simon Roth in 2011, and released as part of the Humble Indie Bundle #3. The port to C++ allowed the porting of the game to other platforms as Linux, Pandora, Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Switch.\n\nUnlike most platforming games, in \"VVVVVV\" the player is not able to jump, but instead can reverse the direction of gravity when standing on a surface, causing Captain Viridian to fall either upwards or downwards. This feature was first seen in the 1986 8-bit game Terminus. The player uses this mechanic to traverse the game's environment and avoid various hazards, including stationary spikes and moving enemies.\n\nLater areas introduce new mechanics such as moving floors or rooms which, upon touching one edge of the screen, cause the player character to appear on the other side. \"VVVVVV\" contains eight main levels, including two intermissions, and one final level, only seen outside Dimension VVVVVV (in a \"polar dimension\"), situated inside a larger open world for the player to explore. Due to its high level of difficulty, the game world contains many checkpoints, to which the player's character is reset upon death.\n\nThe sad elephant, sometimes also called the elephant in the room, is a large elephant with a tear dropping from its eye. It spans four rooms near the Space Station area of Dimension VVVVVV, flickering constantly from color to color. If the player stands near the elephant for a short period of time, it will cause Captain Viridian to become sad. The elephant serves no function to the game, but has served to provoke much discussion about its meaning or symbolism amongst fans of the game. Similarly to many of the enemies in the game, the sad elephant originated in dream journals kept by creator Terry Cavanagh and not from Jet Set Willy as once believed.\n\nThe player controls Captain Viridian, who at the outset of \"VVVVVV\" must evacuate the spaceship along with the captain's crew, when the ship becomes affected by \"dimensional interference\". The crew escapes through a teleporter on the ship; however, Captain Viridian becomes separated from the rest of the crew on the other end of the teleporter. Upon returning to the ship, the Captain learns that the ship is trapped in an alternative dimension (referred to as \"Dimension VVVVVV\"), and that the ship's crew has been scattered throughout this dimension. The player's goal, as Captain Viridian, is to rescue the missing crew members and find the cause of the dimensional interference.\n\nThe gravity-flipping mechanic of \"VVVVVV\" is based on an earlier game designed by Cavanagh, entitled \"Sine Wave Ninja\". In an interview with IndieGames.com, Cavanagh said that he was interested in using this idea as a core concept of a game, something he felt other games which include a gravity-flipping mechanism had never done before.\n\nCavanagh first unveiled \"VVVVVV\" on his blog in June 2009. The game had been in development for two weeks, and Cavanagh estimated that the game would be finished in another two, \"but hopefully not much longer.\" A follow-up post published in July 2009 included screenshots of the game and an explanation of the game's gravity-flipping mechanic. Cavanagh wrote that \"VVVVVV\", unlike some of his previous work such as \"Judith\" and \"Pathways\", would not be a \"storytelling experiment\", but rather \"focused on the level design\". The game was first shown publicly at the 2009 Eurogamer Expo, which gave Cavanagh the opportunity to collect feedback from players. In December 2009, a beta version of \"VVVVVV\" which had been given to donors was leaked on 4chan.\n\nThe visual style of \"VVVVVV\" is heavily inspired by games released for the Commodore 64 8-bit computer from the 1980s, especially \"Jet Set Willy\" which is referenced by the element of collecting difficult-to-reach shiny objects and most notably the naming of each room; Cavanagh aimed to create a game \"that looked and felt like the C64 games I grew up with.\" He eventually entrusted naming the rooms to \"QWOP\" developer Bennett Foddy, who created every room name in the final version. The graphical style of \"VVVVVV\" is heavily influenced by the Commodore 64; similarly, the game's music is heavily dependent on chiptune elements. Swedish composer Magnus Pålsson scored the game, and released the original soundtrack in 2010, titled \"PPPPPP\".\n\nCavanagh also considered this game an opportunity to indulge in his \"retro fetish\". He has said because he lacks the technical prowess to make more modern-looking games, he instead focuses on making them visually interesting; additionally, he finds this to be made easier by \"work[ing] within narrow limits\". \"VVVVVV\" was the first game which Cavanagh sold commercially. While his previous games were all released as freeware, due to the size of \"VVVVVV\" compared to his previous work, Cavanagh felt that he \"couldn't see [himself] going down that route.\"\n\n\"VVVVVV\" was released on January 11, 2010 for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. A trial version of the game is playable on the website Kongregate. A Linux version was in development, but a number of technical difficulties arose in the porting process, which led Cavanagh to cancel it for the time being.\n\nThe game was rewritten in C++ by games developer Simon Roth in 2011, allowing Linux support to be successfully implemented. This formed version 2.0 of \"VVVVVV\", launched on July 24, 2011 as part of the third Humble Indie Bundle. Version 2.0 also features support for custom levels, and a level editor. The C++ port also allowed for the implementation of new graphics modes and various speed improvements. Version 2.0, however, does not support saved games from the original Flash version of \"VVVVVV\"; many players received this update via Steam without warning, and hence were unable to continue their existing saved games. A save-file exporter is in development.\n\nBased on this source code it was also ported in 2011 for the Open Pandora, which requires the data files from the Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X or Linux version of the game to work.\n\nOn October 7, 2011, it was announced that a version of the game was being made for Nintendo 3DS by Nicalis. It was released on December 29, 2011 in North America and May 10, 2012 in Europe. The Nintendo 3DS version was eventually released in Japan on October 12, 2016, courtesy of Japanese publisher Pikii.\n\nIn 2010, a demo of the game's early levels was ported to the Commodore 64 by programmer Paul Koller, with Cavanagh's assistance. In April 2017 a complete port to the Commodore 64 was released by developer Laxity.\n\nThe soundtrack of \"VVVVVV\" was composed by chiptune musician Magnus Pålsson (also known as SoulEye). Cavanagh approached Pålsson to compose \"VVVVVV\" after playing \"Space Phallus\", an indie game by Charlie's Games, which featured a song by him. Pålsson wrote on the Distractionware blog that, upon playing Cavanagh's previous games, he was \"amazed at the depth that came with the games, even though they were small and short.\" In writing the music for \"VVVVVV\", Pålsson aimed to make \"uptempo happy songs that would ingrain themselves into your minds whether you want to or not, hopefully so much so that you’d go humming on them when not playing, and making you want to come back to the game even more.\" The complete soundtrack, titled \"PPPPPP\", was released alongside \"VVVVVV\" and is sold as a music download or CD on Pålsson's personal website. On June 12, 2014 Pålsson released a power metal version of the soundtrack titled \"MMMMMM\" which was arranged and performed by guitarist Jules Conroy. The album contains a mod file to replace the in-game music with the metal tracks.\n\n\"VVVVVV\" has been generally well received by critics, earning a score of 81/100 for the Windows version and 83/100 for the 3DS version on review aggregator website Metacritic. The game was noted for being the first important independent release of 2010; Kieron Gillen of \"Rock, Paper, Shotgun\" called it \"the first great Indie game of the year\", while Michael Rose, writing for IndieGames.com, noted that the release of \"VVVVVV\" followed a year which \"some may argue...didn't really deliver an outstanding indie title which showed the mainstream that independent developers mean business.\" The level design of \"VVVVVV\" was lauded by critics: Rose considered the game to have no filler content, which he found to be \"one of the game's strongest points\". Michael McWhertor of gaming news blog Kotaku wrote that the game's areas contained \"a surprising amount of variation throughout...ensuring that \"VVVVVV\" never feels like its designer failed to explore the gameplay possibilities.\"\n\nMost reviewers wrote of \"VVVVVV\" high level of difficulty. McWhertor found that \"the game's trial and error moments can seriously test one's patience.\" However, several critics noted that the game's challenge is made less frustrating due to its numerous checkpoints, as well as the player's ability to retry after dying as many times as needed. These additions made \"VVVVVV\" \"not unforgiving\", according to IGN staff writer Samuel Claiborn, while still being \"old-school in its demands of player dedication\". Independent reviewer Declan Tyson said that he feels \"victimised by the game's criminally unforgiving collision detection and over-enthusiastically sensitive controls\" but that \"it's all worth it for when you reach the next checkpoint and feel that split second of relief\".\n\nThe price of \"VVVVVV\" when it was originally released was $15. This was seen by McWhertor as being the game's \"one unfortunate barrier\" to entry: \"While there's plenty to see and do after blazing through the game's core campaign, the steeper than expected asking price will probably turn some off.\" Likewise, Gillen wrote in his review that the cost \"does strike you as a lot for an Indie lo-fi platformer\", while insisting that \"it is worth the money\". Since its original release, the price of \"VVVVVV\" has been reduced to $5. On his blog, Cavanagh said that the decision was difficult to make, but added, \"I know that the original price of $15 was off putting for a lot of people\".\n\n\"VVVVVV\" was awarded the IndieCade 2010 award for \"Most Fun and Compelling\" game in October 2010. Game development blog Gamasutra honored \"VVVVVV\" in its year-end independent games awards, which earned second place in 2009 and an honorable mention in 2010. The game's protagonist, Captain Viridian, is a playable character in the Windows version of the platform game \"Super Meat Boy\".\n\nOn May 1, 2016, ShinyQuagsire discovered that the Nintendo 3DS port of \"VVVVVV\" can be exploited to load homebrew software. In a similar manner to \"Cubic Ninja\", Nintendo removed the game from the eShop after the exploit was discovered. The game was brought back to the eShop nearly four months afterwards. The 1.1 version of the game fixes the exploit.\n\n"}

Her nickname \"Yoarashi\" means night-storm in Japanese.\n\nHer early life is generally undocumented and has produced many ideas and opinion. Some sources assert that she was a daughter of a samurai of Awa Province, or she was born in Edo. There is another opinion that she was a daughter of Sajiro, a fisherman who lived on the island of Jōgashima at the tip of the Miura Peninsula. According to a non-fiction writer Atsushi Hachisu, she sold herself into geisha because her family was poor, and she worked as a geisha. There is another opinion that she was an employee at the decorative collar shop in the Nakamise neighborhood in front of Sensō-ji.\n\nAs she was beautiful, people in the Edo longed for her. She became a mistress of Ōkubo Tadayori () in the capital Edo. He was the \"daimyō\" of the Karasuyama Domain in Shimotsuke Province, which was rated at thirty thousand \"koku\". Ōkubo had a son, the successor to the Ōkubo family, by her. However, he hated her, and abandoned her in the Meiji Restoration.\n\nShe became a mistress of Kobayashi Kinpei, but she paid for sex with kabuki actor Arashi Rikaku, and then fell in love with him, so she killed Kobayashi with poison on March 2, 1871. Rikaku harbored her but they were arrested. She was sentenced to death, and she was executed by decapitation after she had a child by Rikaku.\n\nRikaku was sentenced to 3 years in prison, and he was released in September 1874. He became kabuki actor Ichikawa Gonjūrō after his release.\n\nHer case was reported sensationally several years after that, but many researchers such as a Japanese art historian Naoyuki Kinoshita agree that mass media adapted her and there were untruths in her tradition. In 1878, she was called a serial killer Yoarashi Okinu. A book characterized her as a she-devil, and her tradition is based on this virtual fiction.\n\n\n"}
