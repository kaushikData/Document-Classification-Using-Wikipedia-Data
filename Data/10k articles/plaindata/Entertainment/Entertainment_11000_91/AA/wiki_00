Although antiheroes may sometimes perform actions that are morally correct, it is not always for the right reasons, often acting primarily out of self-interest or in ways that defy conventional ethical codes.\n\nAn early antihero is Homer's Thersites. The concept has also been identified in classical Greek drama, Roman satire, and Renaissance literature such as \"Don Quixote\" and the picaresque rogue.\n\nThe term antihero was first used as early as 1714, emerging in works such as \"Rameau's Nephew\" in the 18th century, and is also used more broadly to cover Byronic heroes as well.\n\nLiterary Romanticism in the 19th century helped popularize new forms of the antihero, such as the Gothic double. The antihero eventually became an established form of social criticism, a phenomenon often associated with the unnamed protagonist in Fyodor Dostoyevsky's \"Notes from Underground.\" The antihero emerged as a foil to the traditional hero archetype, a process that Northrop Frye called the fictional \"center of gravity\". This movement indicated a literary change in heroic ethos from feudal aristocrat to urban democrat, as was the shift from epic to ironic narratives.\n\nHuckleberry Finn (1884) has been called \"the first antihero in the American nursery\".\n\nThe antihero became prominent in early 20th century existentialist works such as Franz Kafka's \"The Metamorphosis\" (1915), Jean-Paul Sartre's \"La Nausée\" (1938) (), and Albert Camus' \"L'Étranger\" (1942) (). The protagonist in these works is an indecisive central character who drifts through his life and is marked by ennui, angst, and alienation.\n\nThe antihero entered American literature in the 1950s and up to the mid-1960s was portrayed as an alienated figure, unable to communicate. The American antihero of the 1950s and 1960s (as seen in the works of Jack Kerouac, Norman Mailer, et al.) was typically more proactive than his French counterpart, with characters such as Kerouac's Dean Moriarty famously taking to the road to vanquish his ennui. The British version of the antihero emerged in the works of the \"angry young men\" of the 1950s. The collective protests of Sixties counterculture saw the solitary antihero gradually eclipsed from fictional prominence, though not without subsequent revivals in literary and cinematic form.\n\nThe antihero also plays a prominent role in films noir such as \"Double Indemnity\" (1944) and \"Night and the City\" (1950), in gangster films such as \"The Godfather\" (1972), and in Western films, especially the Revisionist Western and Spaghetti Western. Lead figures in these westerns are often morally ambiguous, such as the \"Man with No Name\", portrayed by Clint Eastwood in \"A Fistful of Dollars\" (1964), \"For a Few Dollars More\" (1965) and \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" (1966).\n\n\n"}

Under Pareto efficiency, an allocation of a resource is Pareto efficient if there is no other allocation of that resource that makes no one worse off while making some agents strictly better off. A limitation with the concept of Pareto efficiency is that it assumes that knowledge about other market participants is available to all participants, in that every player knows the payoffs and strategies available to other players so as to have complete information. Often, the players have types that are hidden from the other player.\n\nThe lack of complete information raises a question of when the efficiency calculation should be made. Should the efficiency check be made at the ex ante stage before the agent sees their types, at the interim stage after the agent sees their types, or at the ex post stage where the agent will have complete information about their types? Another issue is incentive. If a resource allocation rule is efficient but there is no incentive to abide by that rule or accept that rule, then the revelation principle asserts that there is no mechanism by which this allocation rule can be realized.\n\nBayesian efficiency overcomes problems of the Pareto efficiency by accounting for incomplete information, by addressing the timing of the evaluation (ex ante efficient, interim efficient, or ex post efficient), and by adding an incentive qualifier so that the allocation rule is incentive compatible.\n\nBayesian efficiency separately defines three types of efficiency: ex ante, interim, and ex post. For an allocation rule formula_1:\n\n\"Ex ante efficiency\": formula_2 is incentive compatible, and there exists no incentive compatible allocation rule formula_3 that\n\nfor all formula_5, with strict inequality for some formula_5.\n\n\"Interim efficiency\": formula_2 is incentive compatible, and there exists no incentive compatible allocation rule formula_3 that\n\nfor all formula_5 and formula_11, with strict inequality for some formula_5 and formula_11.\n\n\"Ex post efficiency\": formula_2 is incentive compatible, and there exists no incentive compatible allocation rule formula_3 that\n\nfor all formula_5, with strict inequality for some formula_5.\n\nHere, formula_19 are beliefs, formula_20 are utility functions, and formula_5 are agents. An ex ante allocation is always interim and ex post efficient, and an interim efficient allocation is always ex post efficient.\n"}

This 34-acre park attracts about 450.000 each season.\nThe history of theme park BonBon-land can be dated back to when the Danish sweets boiler Michael Spangsberg got an idea to produce wacky candy with such funny names as 'mågeklatter', 'hundeprutter' and 'tissebleer'.\n\nFrom early on the candy became very popular, and children wanted to visit the factory in Holme Olstrup (a small Danish town in the countryside) to see how the cheeky and delicious pieces of candy were made. However, the production of the candy had to fulfil some very strict regulations concerning hygiene, so the factory couldn´t continue to offer visiting tours. As a result, Michael Spangsberg came up with yet another good idea - to open a small Bonbon-land.\n\nIn 1992, the theme park opened with a mini candy factory, a cinema, a shop and four small boats, shaped like a duck in a small pond. The park was an immediate success with children and over the years many rides and attractions have been added making, despite with adult-oriented contents and toilet humor throughout, Bonbon-Land one of Denmark´s most popular children´s parks (in 2008 it was the eight most popular tourist attraction in Denmark). In 2007, the Spanish-based entertainment company Parques Reunidos purchased the park.\n\nIn total, Parques Reunidos owns 67 theme parks around the world. \n\nFrom the beginning BonBon-land has focused on experiences that the whole family could enjoy. Today, Bonbon-land has over 60 different attractions and numerous activities on offer. Among the most popular rides in the park are the 4 roller coasters and the 2 water rides. There are also a number of playgrounds and a pirate track that visitors can try out. \n\nUp until 1998, BonBon-land had expanded its park to cover an area of 85.000 m² (21 acres). When the Beaver-Rafting course was finished in 1998, it was suddenly more than 110.000 m² (27 acres). Then in 2003, in connection with the opening of ’Vildsvinet’, the park expanded yet again to cover roughly 130.000 m² (32 acres), which is now its current size.\n\nThe most expensive amusements are the rafting course with a price of 32 million DKK, 'Vildsvinet' from 2003, with an estimated price of 25 million DKK as well as 'Hankatten' that had a price of 20 million DKK. New amusements in 2010 are 'Svend Svingarm' and a brand new 4D cinema.\n\nIn 2012 it was ranked as one of the weirdest parks by \"Time\".\n\n\n\nThe park has Arcade Games, various Test-Your-Skill Games and a Kiddie Show.\n\n"}

It was located south of U.S. Route 50 along the road to the Royal Gorge Bridge. Features of the park included gun fights, 30 authentic buildings from the Colorado 19th century frontier, themed entertainment, full service saloon and restaurant. There was also the Mystery House and a horse-drawn trolley ride. The town featured a donkey as the mayor. The mayor of Buckskin Joe resided in a small building and was allowed free range of the park. \n\nBuckskin Joe was built as a movie set in 1957 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer director Malcolm F. Brown, by bringing together old buildings from around central Colorado, and assembling them into an old western-style town. The name was taken from the former mining town, now ghost town, of Buckskin Joe, west of Fairplay, Colorado. The only building in the theme park from the original Buckskin Joe is the general store originally owned by Colorado pioneer Horace Tabor. In 1958 the owners began admitting tourists between filmings, and developed the location into a western theme park.\n\nThe Town of Terror, a later addition, was voted the best Halloween haunted attraction in Colorado two years in a row. Every October the staff of Buckskin Joe would transform the mild mannered attraction into a haunted attraction, capitalizing on the town's real haunted history. The town was also featured on the History Channel's \"Haunted Rockies Series\" for its unexplained happenings.\n\nOn September 2, 2010, owner Greg Tabuteau announced the sale of Buckskin Joe and its associated attraction the \"Royal Gorge Scenic Railway\", to an anonymous purchaser. The owner was later identified as Florida billionaire William Koch who plans to move the historic ghost town to his ranch near Gunnison. The final day of operation for the town was September 12, 2010.\n\nThe town was a western movie filming location with more than 21 films to its credit, including \"Cat Ballou\", \"The Cowboys\" and \"The Sacketts\". The 1991 television feature \"Conagher\" starring Sam Elliott, Katharine Ross, Ken Curtis and Barry Corbin was filmed at Buckskin Joe. \"Conagher\" was the last film in which Curtis appeared. The final movie to be filmed at Buckskin Joe was \"Cactus Creek\"; filming concluded just before the sale of the town was announced.\n\n"}

In Santo Domingo, celebrations include a large military display with the Dominican air force, navy, and army. Festivities often include the wearing of colorful costumes that symbolize Dominican religious and traditional characters such as \"Calife\", \"Guloya\", and \"Diablo Cojuelo\". Festivities take place all over the island, with each town adding its own twist to the celebration.\n\nThe \"Christian\" slave-owners who lived on the island would let their slaves have a celebration once a year so that they could get the \"wild\" out of their systems. The slave-owners considered this to be a \"pagan\" celebration, and therefore mixed \"Christian\" traditions into it and began to celebrate the event as well.\n\nEvidence has been found in the ruins of La Vega Vieja (near the present day La Vega) showing that Carnival has been celebrated in the Dominican Republic since 1510. The celebration originally consisted of the residents of the island dressing themselves as Moors and Christians.\n\nThough it is not known for certain, it is thought that the colony of Santo Domingo was the first place in the Americas to have a pre-Lenten costume. The celebration became a way to escape from the rigid religious traditions brought from the old world. By the late 1700s, the carnival had become a major celebration in the colony. Then on February 27, 1844, when the Dominican Republic won its independence from Haiti, the celebration grew even greater in popularity, as the country's Independence Day celebrations were combined into the pre-existing carnival celebrations.\n\nThe celebration is symbolized by an \"upside-down Chicken\", and its main character is the \"Diablo Cojuelo\" (Limping Devil).\n\nWhile there are many characters in the various versions of the carnival across the island, there are several prominent ones featured in most celebrations:\n\n\nThere are many ways in which the carnival is celebrated, although most celebrations have several similarities:\n"}

{"id": "30740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30740", "title": "Classical unities", "text": "Classical unities\n\nThe classical unities, Aristotelian unities, or three unities are rules for drama derived from a passage in Aristotle's \"Poetics\". In their neoclassical form they are as follows:\n\n\nAristotle dealt with the unity of action in some detail, under the general subject of \"definition of tragedy\", where he wrote: \"serious, complete in itself and of a certain magnitude\". \n\nNow, according to our definition, Tragedy is an imitation of an action that is complete, and whole, and of a certain magnitude … As therefore, in the other imitative arts, the imitation is one when the object imitated is one, so the plot, being an imitation of an action, must imitate one action and that a whole, the structural union of the parts being such that, if any one of them is displaced or removed, the whole will be disjointed and disturbed. For a thing whose presence or absence makes no visible difference, is not an organic part of the whole.\n\nHis only reference to the time in the fictive world is in a distinction between the epic and tragic forms:\n\nEpic poetry agrees with Tragedy in so far as it is an imitation in verse of characters of a higher type. They differ, in that Epic poetry admits but one kind of metre, and is narrative in form. They differ, again, in their length: for Tragedy endeavours, as far as possible, to confine itself to a single revolution of the sun, or but slightly to exceed this limit; whereas the Epic action has no limits of time.\n\nUnlike his prescriptive attitude regarding the plot (unity of action), Aristotle here merely remarks on the typical duration of a tragedy's action, and does not suggest any kind of imperative that it always ought to be so. He was writing after the golden age of Greek drama, and many Greek playwrights wrote plays that do not fit within these conventions.\n\nAristotle does not actually mention the neoclassical unity of place at all. However, the prevalent interpretation of his \"Poetics\" during the Middle Ages inclined toward interpreting his comment on time as another \"unity\".\n\nItalian critics of the 16th century, from Lodovico Castelvetro onwards, and then 17th-century French critics, proponents of the neoclassical movement, both expanded Aristotle's descriptions. The result was to make them into prescriptions for structuring plays. French drama of the 17th century, particularly that of Molière and Racine, was highly regular, and Corneille incurred harsh criticism for departing from the unities in \"Le Cid\". The English dramatists writing for the Elizabethan and Jacobean stage were largely unaware of these structures.\n\nBy the later 17th century, however, English dramatists (under the influence of French criticism picked up by those in exile during the English Interregnum) did begin to assess their own plays according to these rules. Thus, John Dryden, among many others, compares the \"irregular\" Shakespeare (only two of Shakespeare's plays conform to the unities – \"The Comedy of Errors\" and \"The Tempest\") with the \"regular\" Dryden in his \"Essay of Dramatick Poesie\" (1668), and makes use of the unity of time in this passage criticizing Shakespeare's history plays.\n\n... if you consider the Historical Playes of Shakespeare, they are rather so many Chronicles of Kings, or the business many times of thirty or forty years, crampt into a representation of two hours and a half, which is not to imitate or paint Nature, but rather to draw her in miniature, to take her in little; to look upon her through the wrong end of a Perspective, and receive her Images not onely much less, but infinitely more imperfect then the life: this instead of making a Play delightful, renders it ridiculous.\n\nHowever, Dryden declared Shakespeare \"incomparable\" because of his disregard for convention:\n\n... in most of the irregular Playes of Shakespeare or Fletcher (for Ben Johnson's are for the most part regular) there is a more masculine fancy and greater spirit in all the writing, then[sic] there is in any of the French.\n\nAlexander Pope criticizes the violation of the unities in his \"Dunciad\". In the 1728 version of the poem, the goddess Dulness notes that \"Time himself stands still at her command,/ Realms shift their place, and Ocean turns to land\" (\"Dunciad\" 1728, i, 69–70). Additionally, he notes a violation of unity of action, as tragedy and comedy were mixed.\n\nSamuel Johnson, too, applied the unities to drama in his \"Prefaces to Shakespeare\". He was well aware that Aristotle had only recommended the unity of action, and knew that rules must serve drama, not vice versa:\n\nWhether Shakespeare knew the unities, and rejected them by design, or deviated from them by happy ignorance, it is, I think, impossible to decide, and useless to inquire. We may reasonably suppose, that, when he rose to notice, he did not want the counsels and admonitions of scholars and critics, and that he at last deliberately persisted in a practice, which he might have begun by chance. As nothing is essential to the fable, but unity of action, and as the unities of time and place arise evidently from false assumptions, and, by circumscribing the extent of the drama, lessen its variety, I cannot think it much to be lamented, that they were not known by him, or not observed: Nor, if such another poet could arise, should I very vehemently reproach him, that his first act passed at Venice, and his next in Cyprus. Such violations of rules merely positive, become the comprehensive genius of Shakespeare…\n\nJohn Pitcher, in his Arden Shakespeare Third Series edition of \"The Winter's Tale\" (2010), argues that Shakespeare was familiar with the unities due to an English translation of \"Poetics\" that became popular around 1608, and that The Winter's Tale is intentionally breaking all the rules.\n\nThe classical unities were influential in dramatic criticism until Victor Hugo's \"Hernani\" (1830); one of the things that made that play controversial at its debut was its violation of these rules of classicism. In the Spanish theatrical tradition, there is Lope de Vega's \"Arte nuevo de hacer comedias\" of 1609, which is a defense of the new form for writing and representation of Golden Age Spanish theatre. Lope's \"Arte nuevo\" is a 389 verse poem which explicitly defends his and other dramaturges, distancing from Aristotelian unities of theatre.\n\n\n\n"}

She has spent 25 years as a social worker and lives in Waterville.\n\nLachowicz, a long-time Democratic activist and advocate on women's issues, won a June 12, 2012 primary election against Dana Hernandez, with 827 votes (52.3%) to Hernandez' 755 (47.7%). She faced Martin, who ran unopposed in his own primary, on November 6, 2012. The 25th district covers Albion, Benton, Clinton, Unity Township, Waterville and Winslow in Kennebec County, and Detroit and Pittsfield in Somerset County.\n\nThe website \"Colleen's World\" was set up by the Republican Party of Maine to \"out\" her as a player of the Massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) \"World of Warcraft\" (her \"main\" character is a level 100 orc rogue named Santiaga). The site displayed several messages posted by Lachowicz to sites such as \"The Daily Kos\", stating her desire to \"go and hunt down Grover Norquist and drown HIM in [her] bathtub\" (referencing a comment Norquist made on shrinking the government \"to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub\") and comments about stabbing and poisons (in \"World of Warcraft\", rogues rely heavily on daggers and poisons). The website said \"In Colleen’s online fantasy world, she gets away with crude, vicious and violent comments\" and \"Maine needs a State Senator that lives in the real world, not in Colleen’s fantasy world.\" They also sent out a press release titled \"Disturbing Alter-Ego Revealed\" which accused her of living a \"time-consuming double life.\"\n\nIn response, Lachowicz said, \"I think it’s weird that I’m being targeted for playing online games. Apparently I’m in good company since there are 183 million other Americans who also enjoy online games. What’s next? Will I be ostracized for playing \"Angry Birds\" or \"Words with Friends\"?\" She added, \"What’s really weird is that the Republicans are going after my hobbies instead of talking about their record while they’ve been running Augusta for the last two years. Instead of talking about what they’re doing for Maine people, they’re making fun of me for playing video games. Did you know that more people over the age of 50 play video games than under the age of 18? As a gamer, I’m in good company with folks like Jodie Foster, Vin Diesel, Mike Myers, and Robin Williams. Maybe it’s the Republican Party that is out of touch.\"\n\nMartin said he was unaware of the party's attacks on Lachowicz until contacted by reporters, and he didn’t condone them. Both candidates were declared \"clean election candidates,\" meaning they were both pledged to abstain from negative campaigning, and could only spend the amount they receive from public financing and a limited amount of donations. A number of gamers raised money for organizations which support Lachowicz' candidacy, since her campaign could not solicit or receive any donations; but she said she would rather not become the poster girl for a game she had almost completely stopped playing due to time pressure. The Maine Republican Party filed an ethics complaint, alleging that she cheated by posting on the ActBlue website, and claiming that this constituted improperly coordinating with political action committees to solicit campaign contributions. The bipartisan Maine Ethics Commission rejected this accusation by a 5-0 vote in Lachowicz’s favor.\n\nThe attacks attracted international attention, including articles from \"Time\", the BBC, \"Forbes\", Slate.com, Politico.com and a piece on the satirical news program \"The Colbert Report\".\n\nOn October 11, 2012, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee declared Lachowicz one of their \"2012 Essential Races: Grassroots Nominees\", stating that she had received the second-largest number of nominations from grassroots activists. Referencing the \"World of Warcraft\" attack, the DLCC claimed that the controversy had made hers \"perhaps the most nationally-watched legislative race in the country right now\".\n\nLachowicz was the winner in the general election, unseating Martin with 8,666 votes to his 7,753. Her overwhelming majority in Waterville (4,224 to 2,318) overcame her opponent's narrow leads in all the other municipalities: he won Winslow by 2,007-1,921, Pittsfield 990-702, Detroit 179-163, Clinton 837-705, Benton 824-579; and Albion 598-372.\n\n"}
{"id": "45655749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45655749", "title": "Con Man (web series)", "text": "Con Man (web series)\n\nCon Man is an American comedy web series created, written, directed by, and starring Alan Tudyk. The series follows cult science fiction actor Wray Nerely (Tudyk), as he tours the convention circuit. Tudyk, one of the stars of the 2002 science fiction TV show \"Firefly\", based \"Con Man\" loosely upon his own experiences. The series is co-produced by PJ Haarsma and by Nathan Fillion, who also co-stars in it. Crowdfunded through Indiegogo, \"Con Man\" set records for crowdfunding a web series by raising more than $1 million in 24 hours and more than $3.1 million overall.\n\nThe series premiered on September 30, 2015, on Vimeo, with the first season consisting of 13 episodes. The second season premiered on December 8, 2016 on Comic-Con HQ, Comic-Con's subscription streaming video service and consisted of 12 episodes. In 2017, the series was acquired by Syfy and had its television debut on September 9, 2017, where the episodes were combined to produce half-hour installments for airing.\n\nWray Nerely (Tudyk) is a struggling actor who starred as a spaceship pilot on \"Spectrum\", a canceled science fiction series that went on to become a cult classic. Wray's good friend Jack Moore (Nathan Fillion), who starred as the ship's captain, has become an A-list movie star. Frustrated by Jack's success and his lack thereof, Wray travels the science fiction convention circuit, makes appearances at comic book stores, and visits pop culture events. He navigates the odd people and incidents he encounters along the way while learning to love the fans he has.\n\n\nOf the \"kooky\" people who populate the series, Tudyk emphasized, \"the kooky people in \"Con Man\" are not the fans. [The fans] are the heroes of this. The kooky people are the people who work in the conventions. [...] It's the people that we've met along the way that are pulling the strings behind the curtain, in addition to kooky celebrities.\"\n\nTudyk developed the series based on his experiences as an actor touring the science fiction convention circuit. Though it is not autobiographical, the fictional \"Spectrum\" echoes \"Firefly\", a canceled science fiction series-turned-cult hit that starred Tudyk as a pilot and Fillion as a captain, and Wray's experiences draw heavily on incidents and people Tudyk and Fillion encountered at conventions. \"Spectrum\" is based on a prequel novel to \"The Softwire\" series currently being written by PJ Haarsma, who is also a producer of \"Con Man\".\n\nTudyk said in March 2015 that the concept had been in development for two years. He pitched the idea to a production company, which became interested in producing the series and began to draw up contracts. However, the company's funder left the company, and the series was dropped. Tudyk spent a year meeting with producers but was disappointed. When asked to find an audience beyond \"weird convention nerds,\" he refused, believing it to be compromising the concept of \"Con Man\" and disrespecting fans.\n\nThe series premiered on September 30, 2015, on Vimeo, with the first season consisting of 13 episodes. The second season premiered on December 8, 2016 on Comic-Con HQ, Comic-Con's subscription streaming video service, consisted of 12 episodes, and concluded on January 26, 2017.\n\nIn July 2017, the series was acquired by Syfy and had its television debut on September 9, 2017. The web series was shown as is but the episodes were combined to produce half-hour installments for airing, with all thirteen episodes of the first season aired back-to-back on the night. If the reception of the television network broadcast goes well and viewer ratings are sufficient, the network may decide to fund future seasons.\n\nOn March 10, 2015, Tudyk, Fillion, and Haarsma launched a campaign to raise funds for the series on crowdfunding website Indiegogo with a target goal of $425,000 to produce three ten-minute episodes. In 24 hours, the campaign raised over $1 million, setting a one-day record for a crowdfunded web series. In 35 hours, it raised over $1.4 million, breaking the overall web series crowdfunding record set by the campaign for \"TableTop\"s Season Three. The campaign set a stretch goal of $1.75 million to produce a full season of 12 episodes, as Tudyk planned, plus a \"lost\" episode of the fictional \"Spectrum\". The goal was met on March 14, 2015. The campaign closed on April 10, 2015 with $3,124,214.\n\nThe decision to use crowdfunding came out of Tudyk and Fillion's desire to work with people who knew the world of conventions, would enjoy being involved, and did not disrespect fans and their world. Tudyk said, \"It's something that just made sense. This world of Cons, of the sci-fi conventions, is built by the fans.\" Fillion said, \"This project in the hands of the fans is the only place it will be safe.\"\n\nThe launch of crowdfunding campaign announced that it would be drawing from talent in science fiction and named several guest stars: Seth Green, Felicia Day, James Gunn, Gina Torres, Sean Maher, and Amy Acker. Later, Tricia Helfer, Michael Trucco, Nolan North, Emily Kinney, Robert Patrick, Mindy Sterling, and Samantha Smith were announced as cast members. However, Kinney later left the project because filming dates conflicted with her musical tour. Though the crew thought they would be \"begging for favors\" to cast the series, the successful Indiegogo campaign attracted interest from actors, including William Shatner, and the crew was surprised by the willingness to take small parts. Fillion noted, \"We ran out of parts before we ran out of people for the parts.\" Tudyk stated that some actors appear as fictionalized versions of themselves because \"they are a part of that world.\" In June 2016, it was announced that Eliza Dushku had been cast for the second season.\n\nPrincipal photography for the first season ran over a 23-day period from June 1 to 30, 2015, in Los Angeles. The set was located at Laurel Canyon Stages in Arleta, Los Angeles. Some crowd scenes were shot at MegaCon 2015 in Orlando, Florida on April 10.\n\nThe series received two 2017 Emmy Award nominations: Alan Tudyk for Outstanding Actor in a Short Form Comedy or Drama Series and Mindy Sterling for Outstanding Actress in a Short Form Comedy or Drama Series.\n\n"}

She is credited with re-popularizing burlesque performance, earning the moniker \"Queen of Burlesque\".\n\nVon Teese was born in Rochester, Michigan, the second of three daughters. Her father was a machinist and her mother a manicurist. She is of English, Scottish, Armenian, and German heritage. Dita has stated that one of her grandmothers was half-Armenian and adopted into an Anglo-Saxon American family. Von Teese is known for her fascination with 1940s cinema and classic vintage style. This began at a young age and was fostered by her mother, who would buy clothes for her daughter to dress up. Her mother was a fan of old, Golden Age-era Hollywood films, and from her Von Teese developed a fascination with the actresses of that day, especially Betty Grable.\n\nShe was classically trained as a ballet dancer from an early age, and danced solo at age 13 for a local ballet company. Though she originally wanted to be a ballerina, Von Teese states that \"by 15, I was as good as I'd ever be.\" She was later to incorporate this element into her burlesque shows, where she frequently goes \"en pointe\". The family relocated from Michigan to Orange County, California, when her father's job moved. Von Teese attended University High School in Irvine, California.\n\nWhen Von Teese was a teenager, her mother took her to buy her first bra, made from plain white cotton, and gave her a plastic egg containing a pair of wrinkly, flesh-colored pantyhose. Von Teese says she was disappointed, as she had been hoping to receive beautiful lacy garments and stockings, of the type she had glimpsed in her father's \"Playboy\" magazines. This fueled her passion for lingerie. She worked in a lingerie store as a salesgirl when she was 15, eventually as a buyer. Von Teese has been fond of wearing elaborate lingerie such as corsets and basques with fully fashioned stockings ever since. In college, Von Teese studied historic costuming and aspired to work as a stylist for films. She is a trained costume designer, often designing (and copyrighting) her photo shoots herself.\n\nVon Teese chose her stage name by adopting the name Dita as a tribute to silent film actress Dita Parlo. For her breakthrough December 2002 \"Playboy\" cover, she was required to have a surname, so she chose \"Von Treese\" from the phonebook. \"Playboy\" misspelled it \"Von Teese\", a name which she then kept.\n\nVon Teese achieved some level of recognition in the fetish world as a tightlacer. Through the wearing of a corset for many years, she had reduced her waistline to , and can be laced down as far as .\n\nVon Teese appeared on a number of fetish magazine covers, including \"Bizarre\" and \"Marquis\". It was around this time when she appeared on the cover of Midori's book, \"The Seductive Art of Japanese Bondage\". Von Teese was featured in \"Playboy\" in 1999, 2001, and 2002, with a cover-featured pictorial in 2002. The German metal band Atrocity chose her as the cover model for their 2008 album, \"Werk 80 II\".\n\nShe has stated in print, \"I love fetish for its powers of transformation and also for its beauty.\" Among her heroes of vintage fetish history are John Willie, Bettie Page, and Irving Klaw.\n\nVon Teese is best known for her burlesque routines and is frequently dubbed the \"Queen of Burlesque\" in the press. Von Teese began performing burlesque in 1992, and, as a proponent of Neo-Burlesque, has helped to popularize its revival. In her own words, she \"puts the tease back into striptease\" with long, elaborate dance shows with props and characters, often inspired by 1930s and 1940s musicals and films. Some of her more famous dances have involved a carousel horse, a giant powder compact, a filigree heart and a clawfoot bathtub with a working shower head. Her signature show features a giant martini glass. Her feather fan dance, inspired by burlesque dancer Sally Rand, featured the world's largest feather fans, now on display in Hollywood's Museum of Sex.\n\nHer burlesque career has included some memorable performances. She once appeared at a benefit for the New York Academy of Art wearing nothing but $5 million worth of diamonds. Additionally, Von Teese became the first guest star at Paris's Crazy Horse cabaret club with her appearance in October 2006. Also in 2006, Von Teese appeared on an episode of \"America's Next Top Model\" (cycle 7) doing a workshop to teach the contestants about sexiness by means of burlesque dancing and posing. In 2007, Von Teese performed at the adult entertainment event Erotica 07 in London alongside Italian rock band Belladonna.\n\nVon Teese's first book (in collaboration with Bronwyn Garrity), which consisted of her opinions on the history of burlesque and fetish, \"Burlesque and the Art of the Teese / Fetish and the Art of the Teese\", was published in 2006 by HarperCollins (and in New York by Regan Books). \"Vanity Fair\" called her a \"Burlesque Superheroine\".\n\nVon Teese participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 in Moscow, Russia, as part of the stage performance for the German entry \"Miss Kiss Kiss Bang\". The act placed 20th out of 25 participants in the final round of the contest. Later, she said her cleavage was censored during the show because it was too voluptuous.\n\nVon Teese has performed in adult and mainstream films. In her early years, she appeared in fetish-related, soft-core pornographic movies, such as \"Romancing Sara,\" \"Matter of Trust\" (in which she is billed under her real name of Heather Sweet), and also in two Andrew Blake hard-core fetish films, \"Pin Ups 2\" and \"Decadence.\"\n\nIn recent years, she has appeared in more mainstream features, such as the 2005 short film, \"The Death of Salvador Dali\", written by Delaney Bishop, which won best screenplay and best cinematography at SXSW, Raindance Film Festival, and Mill Valley Film Festival, and won Best Actress at Beverly Hills Film Festival. She starred in the feature film \"Saint Francis\" in 2007.\n\nIn addition, she has appeared in a number of music videos, including the video for the Green Day song \"Redundant,\" the video for \"Zip Gun Bop\" by swing band Royal Crown Revue, Agent Provocateur's video for their cover of Joy Division's \"She's Lost Control,\" and (performing her martini-glass burlesque routine) the video for \"Mobscene\" by Marilyn Manson. She was featured in a striptease/burlesque act in George Michael's live tour 2008, for the song \"Feelin' Good\". In addition to this, she appeared at the final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 as the central feature of Germany's entry, Miss Kiss Kiss Bang by Alex Swings, Oscar Sings. She also appeared in the music video \"Up in the Air\" by Thirty Seconds to Mars in 2013.\n\nShe stated in 2007, \"I don't understand why women feel the need to go into acting as soon as they become famous ... But I suppose if the part were aesthetically correct, then maybe I could consider it.\"\n\nIn January 2011, Von Teese guest-starred in the CBS police procedural drama series \"\", in which her friend Eric Szmanda starred, in the episode \"A Kiss Before Frying.\" She played Rita von Squeeze, a femme fatale version of herself, who seduces Szmanda's character, Greg Sanders, in a plot inspired by film noir.\n\nVon Teese has appeared on a number of best-dressed lists and frequents the front row of fashion shows, particularly Christian Dior, Vivienne Westwood, Jean Paul Gaultier, and Marc Jacobs, labels she is often seen wearing. Speaking of her love of Gaultier, Von Teese has said, \"Jean Paul Gaultier, John Galliano, and Vivienne Westwood were the first designers that really made an impact on me. Jean Paul has a lot of the same obsessions that I do, like corsetry, ballet-peach satin and silks, black silk velvet, bullet bras and girdles. When I was a teenager, I would look for 1930s peach satin lingerie pieces to try to get his look for less, because there was no way I could afford his things back then. It was a dream come true to meet him and become friends with him. I met him the first time when I was doing my first fashion pictorial, which was for Flaunt magazine, and it was a huge story of me wearing the most important pieces from his haute couture archives, and that was a dream!\" \n\nShe has also done catwalk work. During Los Angeles Fashion Week for spring 2004, she modeled for former club kid Richie Rich's fashion label, Heatherette. In 2005, she appeared in the Autumn/Winter Ready-to-Wear show for Giambattista Valli, a former designer for Ungaro, in Paris. In the 2006 Milan Fashion Week, Von Teese was on the runway, opening for the Moschino diffusion label, Moschino Cheap & Chic, autumn/winter 2006/7 show. In 2007, she appeared twice in the Jean Paul Gaultier haute couture show during the Paris Fashion Week, and again in 2014. She has starred in several ad campaigns. She appeared in Vivienne Westwood's spring/summer 2005 collection adverts and became the face of Australian clothing range \"Wheels and Dollbaby\" for their 2006/7 Spring/Summer advertising campaign. She was an ambassador/spokesmodel for HIV/AIDS awareness when she was selected (along with Eve, Deborah Harry, and Lisa Marie Presley) for MAC Cosmetics' Viva Glam VI campaign (a collection of lipsticks and lipgloss where 100% of the proceeds are for worldwide AIDS charities and to raise awareness for HIV/AIDS). Von Teese has appeared in \"Vanity Fair\", \"Vogue\", \"Elle\", and international issues of nearly every fashion magazine. She has campaigned on behalf of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and has appeared in their ads. She participated at the PETA's campaign \"Animal Birth Control (ABC).\"\n\nVon Teese states that she never uses a stylist. \"The one time I hired a stylist, they picked up a pair of my 1940s shoes and said, 'These would look really cute with jeans.' I immediately said, 'You’re out of here.'\" She does her own make-up, and dyes her naturally blonde hair black at home. Von Teese's unique style is \"inspired by eccentric women like Luisa Casati, Anna Piaggi, and Isabella Blow.\"\n\nShe has designed a new lingerie range with Wonderbra.\nOne of Dita Von Teese's trademark items is the garter belt with six garters instead of the usual four, with two each at the front, side seams and back.\nIn May 2012, Dita Von Teese launched her makeup collection \"Classics\" in partnership with the German cosmetic brand Art Deco. Compact powder, blushers, eye styler, eye shadows, mascara and lipstick were produced to recreate the burlesque performer's retro look.\n\nIn 2012, Dita Von Teese launched her own clothing line and underwear line called Von Follies. In 2013, Dita was both model and muse for the 'Dita' 3D printed gown designed by Michael Schmidt and Francis Bitonti and 3D printed by Shapeways exactly to fit her body. Constructed of over 3,000 interlocked 3D printed components and over 12,000 Swarovski crystals it is one of the first fully articulated 3D printed garments to take the technology from haute couture to a sensual fabric-like form.\n\nIn 2014, Von Teese began working with Myer, an Australian department store, on a lingerie line fronted by Australian model Stefania Ferrario.\n\nVon Teese frequently takes Pilates and dressage lessons. Her house is dedicated to early 20th-century décor, including a complete pink kitchen with vintage appliances. She also has a room dedicated to hats.\n\nVon Teese currently resides in Hollywood, California. She is a collector of vintage china, particularly egg cups and tea sets, and drives a 1939 Packard One Twenty Eight, a 1946 Ford Super De Luxe, a BMW Z4 and a 1965 Jaguar S-Type. She also owned a 1939 Chrysler New Yorker from 1997 to December 2010.\n\nMarilyn Manson had been a longtime fan of hers and was a member of her website. They first met when he asked her to dance in one of his music videos, and though she was unable to, the two remained in contact. On Manson's 32nd birthday, in 2001, she arrived with a bottle of absinthe and they became a couple. Manson proposed on March 22, 2004, and gave her a 1930s, , European round-cut diamond engagement ring. On November 28, 2005, they were married in a private, non-denominational ceremony at home. A larger ceremony was held on December 3 at Castle Gurteen de la Poer in Kilsheelan (County Tipperary), Ireland, the home of their friend, Gottfried Helnwein. The wedding was officiated by surrealist film director and comic book writer Alejandro Jodorowsky. It was attended by actor Eric Szmanda, Lisa Marie Presley, burlesque star Catherine D'Lish, artist Jessicka, designer Betony Vernon, producer Christian Hejnal, and Manson's bandmate Madonna Wayne Gacy. The event was featured in \"Vogue\".\n\nOn December 29, 2006, Von Teese filed for divorce from Manson citing \"irreconcilable differences\". Von Teese left their house empty-handed on Christmas Eve, and was not able to get in touch with Manson to inform him of her intention to divorce him. In an interview with \"The Daily Telegraph\", Von Teese stated, \"I wasn't supportive of his partying or his relationship with another girl. As much as I loved him, I wasn't going to be part of that.\" Von Teese also stated that she gave Manson an ultimatum, and said that \"it didn't work. Instead, it made me the enemy.\" Von Teese did not seek spousal support and expressed no interest in his assets. The news broke for the public and for Manson on his birthday on January 5, 2007, when he was served the divorce papers.\n\n\n\n"}

The term then became used figuratively to describe moving image material of any kind.\n\nSometimes film projects will also sell or trade footage, usually second unit material not used in the final cut. For example, the end of the non-director's cut version of \"Blade Runner\" used landscape views that were originally shot for \"The Shining\" before the script was modified after shooting had finished.\n\nTelevision footage, especially news footage, is often traded between television networks, but good footage usually commands a high price. The actual sum depends on duration, age, size of intended audience, duration of licensing and other factors. \n\nAmateur video footage of current events can also often fetch a high price on the market – scenes shot inside the World Trade Center during the September 11, 2001 attacks were reportedly sold for US$45,000.\n\nA footage broker is an agent who deals in footage by promoting it to footage purchasers or producers, while taking a profit in the sales transaction.\n\n\n"}

I Do! is a musical with a book and lyrics by Tom Jones and music by Harvey Schmidt which is based on the Jan de Hartog play \"The Fourposter\". The two-character story spans fifty years, from 1895 to 1945, as it focuses on the ups and downs experienced by Agnes and Michael throughout their marriage. The set consists solely of their bedroom, dominated by the large fourposter bed in the center of the room.\n\nFor producer David Merrick, who initially presented the play on Broadway, \"I Do! I Do!\" was an ideal investment in that it had neither expensive sets and costumes nor a large cast. After four previews, the Broadway production, directed and choreographed by Gower Champion, opened on December 5, 1966, at the 46th Street Theatre, and closed on June 15, 1968, after 560 performances. Mary Martin and Robert Preston comprised the original cast. Carol Lawrence and Gordon MacRae played matinees starting in October 1967 and then replaced Martin and Preston in December 1967.\n\nMartin and Preston starred in a national tour, originally scheduled to play 27 cities for one year, starting in March 1968 in Rochester, New York. However, in February 1969 Martin became ill and the remainder of the tour was cancelled. Carol Burnett and Rock Hudson also starred in a national tour, appearing during Burnett's hiatus from her television show in 1973 and again in 1974 at The Muny, St. Louis, Missouri and in Dallas.\n\nA film adaptation, written by Champion and starring Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke, was announced by United Artists in 1969 but, following the commercial failure of several movie musicals around this time, UA scrapped the film in the spring of 1970. A television version with Lee Remick and Hal Linden was broadcast in 1982.\n\nA 1996 Off-Broadway revival at the Lamb's Theatre was directed by Will Mackenzie and starred Karen Ziemba and David Garrison. It ran for 52 performances.\n\nThe show is a favorite production of regional theatres across the United States and Canada, because of the minimal cost of mounting it. A production at the Chanhassen Dinner Theatre in Chanhassen, Minnesota ran for more than 20 years with leads David Anders and Susan Goeppinger, who eventually married during their run. This set the American record for a play running with the original cast.\n\nAct One\n\nA bedroom, complete with four-poster bed, chaise longue and easy chair. There are two dressing tables downstage on either side. Michael and Agnes sit at the tables, getting dressed for their wedding. They finish their makeup and don their wedding apparel. They move through the ceremony, complete with Agnes throwing the flowers and the two going out into the audience to shake hands and welcome guests. Finally, Michael carries Agnes back across the threshold and they fall into the bed (\"Prologue\").\n\nAgnes' feet hurt. Michael removes her shoe and kisses her foot. Agnes protests; a little drunk, a little weepy and very nervous. Michael professes his belief that they were married in a former life, and his sweetness makes her cry. We get a glimpse of the Michael that we will soon get to know when he ruins her happy moment by pointing out to her that she should go ahead and cry, as her youth is over. They nervously and elaborately prepare for the wedding night. They climb clumsily into bed and pull the covers back to find, to their horror, a pillow embroidered with the words, \"God Is Love.\" Michael awkwardly turns out the light. They say goodnight to each other, and Agnes admits that she's never seen a naked man (\"Goodnight\"). There is an uncomfortable silence. Finally, they kiss and embrace passionately.\n\nA spotlight comes up on Michael, sitting on the lip of the stage. He stretches and smiles and tells the audience a surprising secret: contrary to conventional wisdom, he actually loves his wife (\"I Love My Wife\"). He wakes her and they dance together. He falls asleep, and she puts the \"God Is Love\" pillow under his head, tucks him in and kisses him. The music becomes soft and tender as Agnes straightens the room. She folds his clothes and puts them away, gets the robe that is hanging at her dressing area and slips into a new outfit. We see that she is very, very pregnant. She ruminates on impending motherhood (\"Something Has Happened\").\n\nIn the following blackout, we hear an old-fashioned, hand-rung bell as Michael calls for Agnes. He is in bed with a washcloth on his head as she enters – still hugely pregnant – pushing a bassinet. Michael is having sympathetic labor pains and is very needy and upset. He already feels displaced by the baby to come. Sitting on his lap, Agnes goes into labor. As Michael goes for the doctor, they promise to each other that they will never let anything happen to their relationship.\n\nLights come up on Michael pacing, worrying and praying that his wife and baby survive (\"The Waiting Room\"). All is well; Michael has a son. He tosses cigars into the audience. Agnes enters, pulling a clothesline strung with diapers and baby clothes. Michael now realizes that he has a family for whom he needs to provide (\"Love Isn't Everything\"). Agnes then has a girl. Now Michael knows that he really needs to make money. Despite the stress, love isn't everything... but makes it all worth it. The tension between Agnes and Michael starts to become palpable. Michael has become very self-involved and self-important about his work and success as a novelist. He treats her as a lowly domestic as he lectures the audience on writers and writing, themes and works. She interrupts him in the middle of his diatribe and calls his work dull. He corrects her grammar, criticizes her cooking and habitual lateness, insisting that she accompany him to literary parties at which she feels uncomfortable. She counters that she also has a list of irritating habits (\"Nobody's Perfect\").\n\nThey return from the party and argue bitterly. He admits to having an ongoing affair with a younger woman. He blames Agnes for driving him away. He also points out that everyone knows that men get better with age and women get worse (\"A Well Known Fact\"). Agnes exits in disgust, and Michael finishes the song, making a fast, showy exit, a matinee idol in all his glory. In response to Michael having criticized her shopping habits, Agnes starts parading the extravagant items on her dressing table. She fantasizes about what her life would be like if she were a saucy, single divorcee, partying the night away (\"Flaming Agnes\").\n\nMichael reappears to finish their discussion. She tells him to get out; he refuses, since, he claims, it is his house and his mortgage. She resolves to leave, taking the checkbook with her. He begins throwing her things into a suitcase: her alarm clock, her nightgown, her cold cream and the \"God Is Love\" pillow. Their eyes are now wide open about each other... and it isn't pleasant (\"The Honeymoon Is Over\").\n\nShe stalks out, with her ermine thrown over her nightgown, and the Flaming Agnes hat set determinedly on her head. He waits for a moment, certain of her return. When she doesn't come back, he rushes after her. We hear a struggle and he reappears, dragging her into the room. They fight and he throws her on the bed. His anger dissipates. Looking at her pleadingly, he tells her of his loneliness and regret. Her eyes fill with tears and she acknowledges that no one is perfect (\"Finale – Act I\"). They lie together and embrace.\n\nAct Two\n\nAgnes and Michael are in bed, celebrating New Year's Eve. The \"God Is Love\" pillow is gone, as is the gaudy chandelier. Time has passed; their children are teenagers now, celebrating at New Year's Eve parties of their own. Agnes and Michael are getting older (\"Where Are the Snows?\"). Michael is angry that their son hasn't returned and goes downstairs to wait for him. He storms back into the room, having found bourbon in his son's room. They argue about parenting, and Michael takes a swig from the bottle, only to discover that their son has filled the bottle with the cod liver oil that his mother thought she was administering for three years. We hear that, offstage, Michael has confronted his son at the door with the razor strap, only to discover that his boy is a man, dressed in his father's tuxedo.\n\nMichael and Agnes reflect on the dreams and regrets of their early married years. Agnes asks Michael if he is disappointed. He is not (\"My Cup Runneth Over\"). They fantasize about their children growing up and moving out. They make plans for their middle age and retirement: he'll finally finish his Collected Tolstoy; she'll cruise to Tahiti and learn to do the hootchi-koo; he'll play the saxophone, she the violin (\"When the Kids Get Married\").\n\nLater, Michael is dressing with little success for his daughter's wedding. He is not pleased with his little girl's choice of husband (\"The Father of the Bride\"). Agnes enters, crying. The stained glass window appears again, and Michael and Agnes watch the ceremony. They wave to the departing couple and go home to face an empty nest.\n\nAgnes faces her transition to middle age. She doesn't know what to be now that her children no longer need her as much (\"What Is a Woman?\"). Michael enters the scene with two packages, but Agnes announces that she's going away; she doesn't love Michael anymore. She feels that he neither understands nor appreciates her, and reveals her infatuation with a young poet. Michael confesses his love and concern for his wife. He shows her that he loves her, and she breaks down, laughing and crying at once. He gives her a charm bracelet with a charm for each of them, one for each of their children and room for lots of grandchildren. She feels much better. They dance together and multi-colored ribbons cascade from above (\"Someone Needs Me\").\n\nThe music changes, becomes softer and more carousel-like as, together, they pick up the boxes and papers. They begin to pack up the house (\"Roll up the Ribbons\"). The music continues as they go to their dressing tables and apply old-age makeup, wigs and whiten their hair. It's eight a.m., and the much older Michael and Agnes are moving to a smaller apartment. They are gathering the last bits and pieces to take along with the movers. He pulls out a steamer trunk and finds the \"God Is Love\" pillow. Agnes wants to leave the pillow for the newlyweds who have bought the house, but Michael refuses. He was mortified to find it on their wedding night and won't have another young groom traumatized. Agnes sends Michael to look for a bottle of champagne and sneaks the pillow back under the covers. Michael returns with the champagne, but they determine that they won't drink it, since it's too early. They look at each other across the bed and remember what a good life they've had (\"This House – Finale\").\n\nThey take a last look around and leave the room together. Michael comes back in for the champagne and finds the \"God Is Love\" pillow under the covers. He puts it on Agnes' side of the bed and the champagne on his side before exiting. The curtain falls on the home.\n\n\nThe original cast album was released over RCA Victor. Ed Ames had a major hit with his recording of the song \"My Cup Runneth Over.\"\n\nIn his review for \"The New York Times\", Walter Kerr wrote that the stars were \"great.\" Martin has \"several funny little vocal tricks...and always...with that mellow sound that comes from her throat like red wine at room temperature.\" Preston is \"at his untouchable best when the show asks him to be pompous, and blissfully obtuse.\" The work of the director is noted: \"Then, courtesy of Gower Champion, there are all those engaging things the two do together...one of them is literally the soft-shoe to end all soft-shoes, because it is done with no shoes at all.\" Kerr further wrote that the material was \"on the whole barely passable, a sort of carefully condensed time capsule of all the cliches that have ever been spawned by people married and/or single...the lyrics are for the most part remarkably plain-spoken.\" In reviewing the new cast of Carol Lawrence and Gordon MacRae, Clive Barnes wrote in \"The New York Times\" that they \"exerted a certain charm.\" The musical is \"very slight indeed ... Carol Lawrence was more than [Martin's] equal. She did the younger scenes with less cuteness and her acting had a depth unusual in a musical. Mr. MacRae...has a better if more conventional voice.\"\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

Shortly after his death, Bowman was inducted posthumously into the Texas Heroes Hall of Honor at the Frontier Times Museum in Bandera.\n\nBowman was born to parents Mark McKinley Bowman, Sr. and Margaret Clark Bowman, in Johnson City in East Tennessee. He was reared in Asheville, in western North Carolina, where he and his brother, Mark, Jr., watched Tom Mix and Gene Autry films as boys. When he was twelve in 1937, Bowman moved with his parents to Houston, where his father procured work as an auto mechanic and as a place of potential relief for young Mark’s asthma. Young Bowman learned to shoot flies off the garbage can with BB guns. At the age of fifteen, he began apprenticeships with Roy Smith Boots and Palace Boots in downtown Houston. He was an active member of the Boy Scouts of America during his formative years in Houston and attained their highest rank of Eagle Scout.\n\nIn 1943, he graduated from Sam Houston High School in Houston and was drafted into service during World War II, during which he was severely injured by a land mine and blown against a tree while stringing telephone lines for the Allies down a steep hill during the German occupation of France. He received three Bronze stars and a Purple Heart for his service as a combat infantryman in a US Army communications squadron in France during World War II. After the war, Bowman returned to Houston, where he attended the University of Houston for two years before he opened Bowman and DeGeorge Boot Shop in Rice Village. He toured alone as \"The Straight Shooter.\"\n\n\"The Straight Shooter\" performed with pistol and rifle at gun shows and rodeos throughout the United States. One celebrated act involved lighting two candles, one on each side of an ax blade, then firing a .22 caliber rifle at the leading edge of the ax blade. This would split the bullet and the two pieces of the bullet would extinguished the candle flames. He also routinely split playing cards in half with the same technique and had the accuracy to blast tiny saccharine tablets into powder, which were actually smaller than the .22 caliber bullet itself. He also performed for King Hussein in Jordan, the ruling family of Kuwait and Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands. Bowman was sought out by law enforcement agencies around the world to give specialized firearm instruction and taught police Special Weapons and Tactics (S.W.A.T.) teams and Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I.) teams the techniques of \"instinct shooting\". Based in Houston, site of the Johnson Space Center, Bowman entertained American astronauts and Russian cosmonauts and he performed in the world famous Houston Astrodome many times. He also gave sharpshooting exhibitions at such events as the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.\n\nBowman’s marksmanship drew the attention of Roy Rogers, John Wayne, Jock Mahoney, James Garner, James Drury, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Dan Pastorini, former quarterback of the Houston Oilers. Drury, a Houston resident and co-star of NBC’s \"The Virginian\" western television series from 1962–1971, told \"The New York Times\", \"I’ve seen fast, I’ve seen faster, I’ve seen fastest, and then I’ve seen Joe Bowman.\" Bowman’s son, Mark Bowman, of Austin, Texas said in an interview with the \"Houston Chronicle\" that his father \"loved an era of bygone days and lived by that code. We lost a part of Houston’s heritage and a great guardian of Texas culture and history.\" Until the last days of his life, Bowman took part in shooting exhibitions. Pastorini called Bowman \"probably one of the most unselfish men I’ve ever met. He had a heart of gold and whenever you needed him, he was always there. He always had time for kids and charities … to talk about his gunslinging and his adeptness at handling a weapon,\" Pastorini told \"The Chronicle\".\n\nIn 1989, on the occasion of the death of his close friend, actor/stuntman Jock Mahoney, Bowman issued a stirring tribute written by Mahoney entitled \"Coming Home\", preserved on Bowman's Internet site. Mahoney starred in the former CBS western \"Yancy Derringer\". The poem was read in 1990 in Studio City, California, by Jock Mahoney's widow, Autumn, at a memorial tribute to Mahoney, who died at seventy of a stroke prompted by a road accident in Washington State.\n\nBowman made two pairs of boots for Roy Rogers, which are displayed in the Roy Rogers-Dale Evans Museum in Branson, Missouri. In the early 1960s, Bowman ended his bootmaking business and concentrated on his western show in which he wore a ten-gallon hat, an embroidered shirt and leather boots. He was a consultant to actor Robert Duvall for his role as Augustus \"Gus\" McCrae, patterned on the legendary Texas cattleman Oliver Loving, in the screen adaptation of Larry McMurtry's classic Western \"Lonesome Dove\". He taught Duvall how to use a Walker revolver, once a favorite of the Texas Rangers.\nHe also took Duvall to Bowman's favorite boot shop (Wheeler Boot Company) in Houston and introduced him to bootmaker Dave Wheeler, where the iconic boots Duvall wore as Gus were crafted.\n\nSammy Davis, Jr. purchased several of Bowman's custom fast draw holsters and two sets of Bowman's custom retooled Ruger Blackhawk single-action revolvers, with extremely intricate engraving and the legendary \"smooth\" action on the trigger hammer, early in the 1960s. There is film circulating of Bowman and Sammy Davis, Jr. practicing fast draw against each other on a film set in Nevada during the Rat Pack era of the late 1950s. Bowman also designed and created several pivoting, reinforced competition Western fast draw holsters that created a paradigm shift in competition fast draw, resulting in faster competitive draw times in the late 1950s and early 1960s competitions. Into his 80s, Bowman still designed boots, belts and holsters for his friends, leaving seven decades of artisan expertise and master craftsmanship as his legacy.\n\nBowman died of a heart attack in his sleep at a hotel in Junction, the seat of Kimble County in central Texas, where he and his wife of seventeen years, Betty Reid-Bowman, had stopped for the evening while en route to their home in Houston following an exhibition trip to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Mrs. Bowman said that her husband had been in good health though he wore a pacemaker. He was \"soft-spoken and he was a man’s man,\" his widow told \"The Chronicle\".\n\nIn addition to his wife and son, Bowman was survived by a daughter, Jan Bowman of Dallas, Texas; a daughter-in-law, Charlene Bowman of Austin, Texas and his brother, Mark M. Bowman, Jr., of Denver, Colorado. Bowman's father, brother, and son have the same names. In 1954, Bowman married the former Betty Fruge', (a Houston model and local TV star of the 50's Houston television show \"Fashions in Motion\"), who despite the lack of background with weaponry but with Bowman's tutelage, became the U.S. & North American female fast-draw champion. She appeared as the episode subject in 1962 on CBS's former quiz show, \"To Tell the Truth\". The marriage ended in 1968 in divorce. Bowman is interred at Forest Park Lawndale in Houston.\n\nIn an interview in 1992 with the \"Houston Chronicle\", Bowman lamented the passing of television westerns and culture: \"So much of what I do is for the adults, reminding them of their childhood. What I remember is the morality of the westerns and of the cowboys. That’s all that westerns were: morality plays, where there was good and evil. Now look at the movies and on TV: good can be bad, there’s no distinct line. I don’t think kids learn from that.\"\n\nIn 2006, the official State of Texas sculptor, Edd Hayes, did an extremely lifelike bronze of \"Joe Bowman – The Straight Shooter\" to commemorate his lifetime of achievement. Bowman was appointed \"Texas Ambassador of Goodwill\" by 4 Texas governors. He was also named international spokesman for Sturm, Ruger, & Co., Inc. and was asked by Bill Ruger, Sr. to star in a nationally televised safety message campaign for \"old model\" single action revolvers. Sturm, Ruger & Company, Incorporated recently introduced a limited edition \"Joe Bowman – Straight Shooter\" New Vaquero .45 Caliber revolver into their line of traditional single action revolvers.\n\nUnited States Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) wrote a stirring tribute to Bowman's life and legacy that was published on Sen. Cornyn's website on July 20, 2009. Additionally, in July 2009, \"The New York Times\", \"The Washington Post\", \"The Boston Globe\", \"The Los Angeles Times\", and the \"Houston Chronicle\", among other respected newspapers around the country all wrote feature tributes on the extraordinary life of this decorated war hero, patriot, historian, celebrated marksman and Western artisan.\n"}

{"id": "309118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=309118", "title": "Le Marais", "text": "Le Marais\n\nLe Marais (\"The Marsh\", ) is a historic district in Paris, France. Long the aristocratic district of Paris, it hosts many outstanding buildings of historic and architectural importance. It spreads across parts of the 3rd and 4th arrondissements in Paris (on the Rive Droite, or Right Bank, of the Seine). Le Marais is today the trendiest shopping district in Paris with the top stores in Rue des Francs-Bourgeois and Rue des Rosiers. The most famous stores are BHV Marais, Merci: and Uniqlo Le Marais. \n\nIn 1240, the Order of the Temple built its fortified church just outside the walls of Paris, in the northern part of the Marais. The Temple turned this district into an attractive area, which became known as the Temple Quarter, and many religious institutions were built nearby: the des Blancs-Manteaux, de Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie and des Carmes-Billettes convents, as well as the church of Sainte-Catherine-du-Val-des-Écoliers.\n\nDuring the mid-13th century, Charles I of Anjou, King of Naples and Sicily, and brother of King Louis IX of France built his residence near the current n°7 rue de Sévigné. In 1361 the King Charles V built a mansion known as the Hôtel Saint-Pol in which the Royal Court settled during his reign as well as his son's.\n\nFrom that time to the 17th century and especially after the Royal Square (\"Place Royale\", current \"place des Vosges\") was designed under King Henri IV of France in 1605, the Marais was the French nobility's favorite place of residence. French nobles built their urban mansions there—hôtels particuliers, in French—such as the Hôtel de Sens, the Hôtel de Sully, the Hôtel de Beauvais, the Hôtel Carnavalet, the Hôtel de Guénégaud and the Hôtel de Soubise, as well as many other hôtels particuliers, found all over the district.\n\nDuring the late 18th century, the district was no longer the \"most\" fashionable district for the nobility, yet it still kept its reputation of being an aristocratic area. By that time, only minor nobles and a few more powerful nobles, such as the Prince de Soubise, lived there. The Place des Vosges remained a place for nobles to meet. The district fell into despair after the French Revolution, and was therefore abandoned by the nobility completely, and would remain so until the present day.\n\nAfter the French Revolution, the district was no more the aristocratic district it once was during the 17th and 18th centuries. Because of this, the district became a popular and active commercial area, hosting one of Paris' main Jewish communities. At the end of the 19th century and during the first half of the 20th, the district around the rue des Rosiers, referred to as the \"Pletzl\", welcomed many Eastern European Jews (Ashkenazi) who reinforced the district's clothing specialization. During World War II the Jewish community was targeted by the Nazis who were occupying France. As of today the rue des Rosiers remains a major centre of the Paris Jewish community, which has made a comeback since the 1990s. Public notices announce Jewish events, bookshops specialize in Jewish books, and numerous restaurants and other outlets sell kosher food.\n\nThe synagogue on 10 rue Pavée is adjacent to the rue des Rosiers. It was designed in 1913 by Art Nouveau architect Hector Guimard, who designed several Paris Metro stations. Le Marais houses the Museum of Jewish Art and History, the largest French museum of Jewish art and history. The museum conveys the rich history and culture of Jews in Europe and North Africa from the Middle Ages to the 20th century.\n\nIn 1982, Palestinan terrorists murdered 6 people and injured 22 at a Jewish restaurant in Le Marais, Chez Jo Goldenberg, an attack which evidence ties to the Abu Nidal Organization.\n\nBy the 1950s, the district had become a working-class area and most of its architectural masterpieces were in a bad state of repair. In 1964, General de Gaulle's Culture Minister Andre Malraux made the Marais the first \"secteur sauvegardé\" (literally \"safeguarded sector\"). These were meant to protect and conserve places of special cultural significance. In the following decades the government and the Parisian municipality led an active restoration and Rehabilitation Policy.\n\nThe main Hôtels particuliers have been restored and turned into museums: the Hôtel Salé hosts the Picasso Museum, the Hôtel Carnavalet hosts the Paris Historical Museum, the Hôtel Donon hosts the Cognacq-Jay Museum, the Hôtel de Saint-Aignan hosts the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme. The site of Beaubourg, the western part of Marais, was chosen for the Centre Georges Pompidou, France's national Museum of Modern Art and one of the world's most important cultural institutions. The building was completed in 1977 with revolutionary architecture by Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers.\n\nThe Marais is now one of Paris' main localities for art galleries. Following its rehabilitation, the Marais has become a fashionable district, home to many trendy restaurants, fashion houses, and hip galleries.\n\nThe Marais is also known for the Chinese community it hosts. The community began to appear during World War I. At that time, France needed workers to replace its at-war soldiers and China decided to send a few thousand of its citizens on the condition that they would not take part in the war. After the 1918 victory, some of them decided to stay in Paris, specifically living around the current rue au Maire. Today, most work in jewellery and leather-related products. The Marais' Chinese community has settled in the north of the district, particularly in the surrounding of Place de la République. Next to it, on the Rue du Temple, is the Chinese Church of Paris.\n\nOther features of the neighbourhood include the Musée Picasso, the house of Nicolas Flamel, the Musée Cognacq-Jay, and the Musée Carnavalet.\n\nLe Marais became a centre of LGBT culture, beginning in the 1980s. As of today, 40% of the LGBT businesses in Paris are in Le Marais. Florence Tamagne, author of \"Paris: 'Resting on its Laurels'?\", wrote that Le Marais \"is less a 'village' where one lives and works than an entrance to a pleasure area\" and that this differentiates it from Anglo-American gay villages. Tamagne added that like U.S. gay villages, Le Marais has \"an emphasis on 'commercialism, gay pride and coming-out of the closet'\".\"Le Dépôt\", one of the largest cruising bars in Europe as of 2014 (per Tamagne), is in the Le Marais area.\n\nAccording to sources, the following are people of note:\n\nAccording to sources, the following are places and monuments of note:\n\n\n\n"}

In a subplot, new inmate Piper Chapman, played by Taylor Schilling, deals with the romantic overtures of a mentally unstable inmate, Suzanne \"Crazy Eyes\" Warren, portrayed by Uzo Aduba.\n\n\"Lesbian Request Denied\" received widespread critical acclaim from critics, who praised the episode for the performances of Cox and Aduba, and for its respectful and nuanced treatment of a transgender character, especially in comparison to television's treatment of the transgender community in the past. For the episode, Aduba and Cox both received nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series, the former winning the award, while Foster was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series. Cox was the first (and to date, only) transgender actor to be nominated for an acting award at the Emmys.\n\nIn flashbacks, Sophia Burset (Laverne Cox), formerly Marcus (M Lamar), a firefighter, pays for her sexual reassignment surgery by stealing credit card information from fire-wrecked houses. Sophia's wife, Crystal (Tanya Wright), while unaware of Sophia's crimes, fully supports her transition, although she requests that Sophia keep her penis so that they can continue to have sex. Sophia's son, Michael (Michael Rainey Jr.), however, is upset by her transition, and, upon discovering her credit card fraud, reports her crime to the police, causing her to be arrested.\n\nIn the present day, the prison switches Sophia to generic drugs and halves her dosages of estrogen in order to make up for budget cuts. After attempting to negotiate with prison counselor Healy (Michael J. Harney), she swallows the head of a bobblehead dog in order to see a doctor about her hormone therapy. However, the doctor decides to take Sophia off of hormones altogether, fearing that they are affecting her negatively. After fending off the proposition of prison guard Mendez (Pablo Schreiber) of hormones in exchange for oral sex, Sophia asks Crystal to smuggle in hormones for her; Crystal is disgusted with Sophia, telling her to \"man up\" for the sake of her wife and her son.\n\nMeanwhile, mentally unstable inmate Suzanne (Uzo Aduba), called \"Crazy Eyes\", begins stalking Piper (Taylor Schilling). Piper is perturbed by the attention, despite using Suzanne to ward off her ex-girlfriend Alex (Laura Prepon). Piper decides to let Suzanne down easy by informing her about her fiancé. When Piper confronts Alex for \"stealing her good life\" by naming her in trial, Alex insists that she had no part in her being in prison. Piper decides to ensure this by asking her fiancé, Larry (Jason Biggs), who is dealing with his sexual abstention in Piper's absence, to find out whether Alex named her.\n\nMiss Claudette (Michelle Hurst) receives a new roommate, Janae (Vicky Jeudy), who disrespects her expectations for cleanliness and privacy. Miss Claudette uses her power at the prison to remove Janae from her bunk, resulting in Piper moving into the bunk. Miss Claudette's code of conduct is violated when Suzanne vengefully pees next to Piper's bed.\n\nExplaining how she got involved in the production, Jodie Foster said, \"I read the book [\"\"] and I said to my agent, 'Oh man, I really want to do this.' He was like, 'Well, [the showrunner is] Jenji Kohan!' And I was like, 'Would you please pass along that I'd like to be a part of this?' Then eventually I found out a friend of mine was doing prep work for the show, and I told her, 'Please tell the writer [Piper Kerman] I love that book and I'm dying to do something.' Then that's what happened. They don't tell you what episode you're shooting so it's a wonderful exercise and meditation in letting go because you have no idea what you're doing. One episode takes eight days to prep and eight to shoot. It's a fast deal. And I'd never done TV before.\"\n\nSeries creator and showrunner Jenji Kohan stated that Foster directed the episode as \"sort of her dry-run for when she does her television thing\", referencing an as-of-yet unrealized project for Showtime Foster was to spearhead. When asked about Foster's merits as a TV director, Kohan said, \"Movie directing is different from TV directing and I think some things were like a culture shock for her because, in way, you know the director's not the king in TV. It's more collaborative with the writers than she's used to...That said? She was incredibly collaborative and really game and came in saying, 'I haven't done this before. It's a learning curve.'\"\n\nCox initially wanted to play Sophia pre-transition as well, but was dissuaded by Foster, explaining, “I was like, ‘I have to butch it up,’ because I don’t think Jodie believed that I could pull this off. I go to Jodie and she looks at me and she’s like, ‘We’re gonna have to hire someone.’ Jodie Foster didn’t think I looked masculine enough to play a guy.” Cox said that several \"really butch black men\" auditioned for the part before “our casting director found out that I have a twin brother [M Lamar]...He auditioned, and he got the part.”\n\nSpeaking about the scene in which Sophia's wife, Crystal, gives her advice on clothing, Foster said, \"That was the toughest day of the shoot. It was like, 'How am I going to accomplish this?' I love to shoot fast because I prep like an insane person. But that scene was so incredibly long. It's two people talking. And in order to work with [looking in the] mirror and the kissing -- all those different beats were extremely challenging. It was the hardest day for acting by far. I loved their performances and the subtlety of the things that aren't said. Laverne really brought it home. I'm so proud!\"\n\n\"Lesbian Request Denied\" received critical acclaim. Myles McNutt, reviewing the episode for \"The A.V. Club\", awarded the episode an \"A\", the highest grade on the site, calling it \"a brilliant example of how the series’ flashbacks can transform our understanding of these characters\". McNutt noted that \"On a lesser show, Sophia’s role as “The transsexual to whom Piper sold her hair for a weave” would have remained “The transsexual to whom Piper sold her hair for a weave,” but here the character is elevated above Piper for a week as we learn Sophia’s own story of becoming.\"\n\nAmy Amatangelo of \"Paste\" rated the episode 8.9 out of 10, repeating McNutt's point that \"on the surface, we've all seen a TV character like Sophia before (probably on a crime drama sassing a detective), but \"Orange\" delved deep to show us a complicated and fascinating woman\". Amatangelo also praised the scenes between Piper and Suzanne, as \"they effortlessly flowed between comic relief and terror.\"\n\nDanielle Henderson of \"Vulture\" gave the episode four out of five stars, stating that she was \"ready to base [her] whole view of the show on how [Sophia] was treated, knowing that few people writing for television know what to do with (a) women, (b) black women and certainly not (c) black transgender women\"; she called Sophia's backstory \"heartbreaking\". Henderson also praised the characters of Ms. Claudette and Nicky, calling them \"fun\" and \"scene-stealing\", respectively, while criticizing Piper and Larry for \"living in the no longer useful framework of... Waspy obliviousness\".\n"}

It is a horror film that follows two young teenagers as they hitchhike with some boys, but get captured by a crazy family of Swedes. The film is rated R for violence, nudity, gore and profanity. \n\nIn the wilderness near Minneapolis, a bound and battered pregnant woman is stabbed and stomped to death by a hillbilly named Drake, who drags her body away.\n\nIt is revealed to be 1994, and cheerleaders Tara and Jenna are on their way to a competition being held in Minneapolis. Low on gas, the two pull into a service station, where they meet Chad and Oliver, who are experiencing car trouble. Taking pity on the two men, the girls offer them a ride, and the quartet leave, not realizing they were being watched by a one-eyed, Swedish-speaking man, who uses a walkie-talkie to report what he has seen to his comrades. One-eye follows the group, and causes them to crash by a throwing a piece of roadkill onto their windshield.\n\nDrake pulls up to the walking quartet, and offers them a ride. Once everyone is in the car, Drake drives into the forest, prompting a panicked Chad to jump out of the moving vehicle. Drake meets up with One-eye, and the two tie Tara, Jenna, and Oliver up at gunpoint, and take them to their hideout. Drake places Tara and Jenna in the main house, while One-eye rapes Oliver in a shed. Elsewhere, Chad encounters Bob, one of the hillbillies, and the two fight. Chad kills Bob with a switchblade, and follows a pillar of smoke to the rednecks' house.\n\nWhen One-eye leaves, Oliver uses a saw to mutilate his own hand in order to escape his handcuffs and runs into the woods, where he is killed by Drake. Back in the house, Tara and Jenna free themselves, and sneak outside, only to be confronted by Drake. The two are saved by Chad, who stabs Drake in the neck. The trio reach a rowboat and try to escape with it, but are recaptured by One-eye. One-eye takes Chad and Tara back to the house, and forces them listen over a walkie talkie as Drake drowns Jenna.\n\nAfterward, Chad breaks the chair he is tied to, suffocates the elderly member of the hillbilly clan left to watch them, and frees Tara. As they stumble down the road, Chad and Tara are found by One-eye and Drake, and chased into the forest, where they become separated. Chad leads Drake and One-eye into an abandoned house, and while he manages to wound both of them, he is eventually overpowered. With Drake poised to kill Chad, Tara appears and shoots him with a gun she took off the dazed One-eye. The victory is short lived, as One-eye then attacks Tara. Chad saves Tara by luring One-eye into a room with loose floorboards, which One-eye falls through. Finding One-eye impaled by debris, Chad finishes him off with an axe.\n\nIn a post-credits scene set six months later, another Swedish survivalist snipes a young girl and her mother at the gas station.\n\n\n\"Madness\" was released on DVD in the United States by Well Go in 2010. Despite the packaging proclaiming it to the \"Unrated Version\" this cut of the film is missing the scene in which Oliver is sodomized by One-eye.\n\nHorrorNews.net found \"Madness\" awkward, unoriginal and inconsistent, but admitted there were enough good elements (such as the effects and finale) to warrant a viewing, and concluded its review by saying \"there are certainly worse options out there to stomach\". The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre wrote that it was \"a movie-long chase-and-fight scene between equally stupid victims and freaks, each of them inexplicably ignoring some obvious dangers, pausing at critical moments, and even stopping for a dramatic moment in the middle of a road while they are running for their lives. That said, the endless visceral energy and brutal escalating fights do make for some almost-good action and horror\".\n"}

{"id": "11139456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11139456", "title": "Mebetoys", "text": "Mebetoys\n\nMebetoys was an Italian toy manufacturer that produced die-cast model cars during the 1960s and 1970s. The company was purchased by Mattel in 1969. Mebetoy's main competition in Italy was the earlier trailblazer Mercury, Polistil and the rarer Ediltoys. \n\nThe Gran Toros website says that Mebetoys was started by the Besana family in 1959 as a toy die casting company, in Oleggio Castello, Novara, Italy (80 km north of Milan). The name comes from MEccanica BEsana TOYS. A diecast car line was started in 1967 (Rixon 2005, p. 36), rather late compared to the entry of many other companies in the early-to-mid-1950s. In detail and proportion, Mebetoys joined superior model producers of French Solido and fellow Italian Polistil, in many ways these became the triumvirate of diecast models on the European continent, though Danish Tekno and Italian Rio Models also were important. Models were exact to scale with many moving parts, and generally more sophisticated than venerable British producers Corgi and Dinky Toys.\n\nMebetoys models were known for well-done castings (Rixon 2005, p. 80). Some were very clever model selections such as the Autobianchi A66 Elaf petroleum with a roof luggage rack carrying two large plastic oil barrels, or the Porsche 912 Rally (a 911 in rally form) with rock guards in thin yellow plastic strips covering the front windshield and hood and also featuring red and chrome body and bumper supports which extended from front to rear bumper. This car, in 1:43 scale, was topped off, literally, with three spare tires on the roof. Mebetoys Innocenti Mini (Italian-made mini) appeared in several different guises - including with skis and sled on its roof rack. Other models were unique because they were not offered elsewhere, like the ISO Fidia S4 grand touring sedan. Politoys had the Rivolta and Corgi and Matchbox made the Grifo ubiquitous, but nobody else made the Fidia S4. Models such as the Lamborghini Urraco, Maserati Bora, Toyota 2000 GT, and Ferrari 365 GTC-4 were also special and not often seen in 1:43 scale. Corgi Toys made the Bora, but the Mebetoys version was much better proportioned, detailed and painted (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, p. 74). \n\nSinclair's Auto Miniatures, largely responsible for bringing the diecast collector hobby to the United States, discussed that many people were not aware that Mebetoys also made a few promotional issue diecast cars (Sinclair's 1977; Levine 2009). In the 1960s the company issued a couple of 1:24 scale Alfa Romeos, referred to as the \"le veterane\" set. These two cars were a 1925 P2 World Champion Grand Prix car and a 1951 Alfetta racer. They had exquisite detail with rubber tires and were mounted on a wood base with a decorative identification plate and covered with a clear plastic display box. These were reissued in the late 1970s (Sinclair's 1977).\n\nThe original Mebetoys logo was an 'opening eye' that looks very similar to the American CBS TV logo. Packaging was often a wood grain beige style with a plastic window - always including the 'eye' logo. Some boxes were other colors like a bright yellow. Then Mattel took over and the Mattel red pointed circle was added alongside the Mebetoys logo.\n\nIn 1969, Mebetoys was bought by Mattel, which carried on Mebetoys models and began to market new 1/43 scale cars (Force 1992, pp. 146–147). At first, these were the same realistic Mebetoys European models and had many opening features, rubber tires, and excellent detail. \n\nIncrementally, however, Mattel changed many aspects of Mebetoys. Hard plastic 'speed' tires replaced rubber and new California custom body designs were introduced in 1:43 scale and marketed as Hot Wheels Gran Toros, though they still said Mebetoys on the base. Thus the marque became less 'European' with more Mattel influence. \n\nIn order to attract buyers in the U.S. market, models like the realistic Toyota 2000 GT were augmented with ones such as Tom Daniel's fantasy custom Twin Mill (a model still used in the standard Hot Wheels line). The Hot Wheels flames-off-the-wheel emblem was applied to some Mebetoys packaging. \"Hot Wheels\" was translated into Italian as \"Sputafuoco\", or literally, the cars that \"spit fire\". Thus Mebetoys were marketed as a sort of larger Hot Wheels range. In an interesting twist Mattel's 'Flying Colors' normal sized smaller Hot Wheels were offered in Italy in Italian Mebetoys boxes in the late 1970s. The 1:43 scale line was discontinued entirely around 1983.\n\nMebetoys under Mattel also made a 1:24 scale line which included a BMW 323 coupe, Porsche 924, Porsche 928, Ford Fiesta, Citroen Dyane (one with Zodiac style rubber boat!), Citroen Visa sedan, Alfa Romeo Alfetta (one in Cariabinieri livery), Alfa Alfasud Sprint, Alfa Giulietta sedan, FIAT Uno sedan, Volkswagen Beetle, Volkswagen Golf sedan, Talbot Horizon sedan / Simca 1308 sedan, Mercedes-Benz 450 SEL sedan, Opel Kadett, a Land Rover (one outfitted for desert photography), and a Lancia Beta coupe - one variation of which came handsomely equipped with bicycle rack and two bikes. These were well detailed, but for comparison of 'family' brands, the paint was done better on the later 1:24 scale Besana brothers Martoys. A few 1:30 scale trucks and vans were also made, like the FIAT 242 Attrez-Raid Rally Van. \n\nWhy so many of the 1:24 scale vehicles were rather mundane sedans is an interesting question since manufacturers often make sportier cars for play. Whether any of these were used for promotional purposes is unknown. Some of the later cars (and some of the last made by Mebetoys) had rather fat plastic tires and unwieldy wheel designs. \n\nSome of the cars seemed spot on in detail and proportions like the Porsche 924 and the Volkswagens. Others were less confident in their realism. The Porsche 924 had nearly perfect proportion and the details were exquisite. The wheel design was generic but detailed and attractive with five larger and five smaller slots. Everything opened, including the rear plastic hatch. Even the hidden headlights popped up by moving a lever at the front of the chassis. When fully opened, however, the headlight lever stuck out from under the front bumper like some kind of strange antenna. The seats tilted forward, but chrome plating the steering wheel and gear shift was not so realistic. Another negative was that though the doors opened they did not include the door frame window surround.\n\nFrom the Gran Toros website again, it states that the Mebetoys company was founded by Ugo and Martino Besana in 1959. Mario Besana joined the company in 1967, one year after the company started producing cars. After selling the brand to Mattel, the Besana brothers set up Martoys. This firm made car models in 1/24th scale for only two years, from 1974 to 1976. Then possibly because of confusion with Louis Marx and Company, the name was changed to Bburago, with two 'Bs' (the first B stood for the creator's name, Besana, while the remainder was for the town of Burago di Molgora where the models were made). Bburago became probably the most well-known and popular producer of 1:18 scale models through the 1980s and 1990s. Bburago's assets were sold in 2006 to Maisto.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6098295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6098295", "title": "Panegyrici Latini", "text": "Panegyrici Latini\n\nThe authors of most of the speeches in the collection are anonymous, but appear to have been Gallic in origin. Aside from the first panegyric, composed by Pliny the Younger in  100, the other speeches in the collection date to between  289 and 389 and were probably composed in Gaul. \nThe original manuscript, discovered in 1433, has perished; only copies remain.\n\nGaul had a long history as a center of rhetoric. It maintained its dominance of the field well into the 4th century. An early lead in the field was taken by the Aedui, early allies of Rome and eager to assimilate to the ways of their new rulers: Maenian schools were celebrated as early as the reign of Tiberius (  14–37). They continued to flourish into the days of Eumenius' grandfather, but were closed by the mid-3rd century. \n\nThere was some revival in the city in the late 3rd century, but after the establishment of Trier as an imperial capital in the 280s, the orators began feeling jealousy for the imperial patronage enjoyed by the citizens of Trier. Despite the political and economic hegemony of the city, however, Trier failed to make any significant mark on the rhetoric of the period. \nNixon and Rodgers suggest that it was simply too close to the imperial court. \nThe surviving evidence (which might be prejudiced by Ausonius' \"Professors of Bordeaux\") points to a shift from Autun and Trier as centers of the art in the Tetrarchic and Constantinian period, moving to Bordeaux later in the 4th century.\n\nThe panegyrics evince a familiarity with prior handbooks of rhetoric. Some have argued that Menander of Laodicea's treatises were particularly influential on the collection, and believed his precepts were used in the tenth panegyric. However, because so much of Menander's advice consisted of standard rhetorical procedure, the parallels adduced in favor of Menander as a model are insufficient to prove his direct use by the panegyrists. Other handbooks of rhetoric might also have had influence on the collection. Quintilian's \"Institutio Oratoria\", for example, treats the subject of an oration's ancestry, parentage, and country in a manner similar to the panegyrics of 289, 291, 297, 310, 311, 321, and 389. \nIn any case, the other panegyrics in the collection vary widely from Menander's schema. \nParallels with other Latin orators, like Cicero and Pliny the Younger, are less frequent than they would have been if those authors had served as stylistic models.\n\nThe Latin of the panegyrics is that of a Golden Age Latin base, derived from an education heavy on Cicero, mixed with a large number of Silver Age usages and a small number of Late and Vulgar terms. To students of Latin in Late Antiquity, Cicero and Virgil represented the paragons of the language; as such, the panegyrists made frequent use of them. Virgil's \"Aeneid\" is the favorite source, the \"Georgics\" the second favorite, and the \"Eclogues\" a distant third. (Other poets are much less popular: there are infrequent allusions to Horace, and one complete borrowing from Ovid.) When drawing from Cicero's body of work, the panegyrists looked first to those works where he expressed admiration and contempt. As a source of praise, Cicero's panegyric of Pompey in support of the Manilian law (\"De Imperio Cn. Pompei\") was quite popular. It is echoed thirty-six times in the collection, across nine or ten of the eleven late panegyrics. Cicero's three orations in honor of Julius Caesar were also useful. Of these, the panegyrists were especially fond of the \"Pro Marcello\"; across eight panegyrics there are more than twelve allusions to the work. For vilification, the Catiline and Verine orations were the prominent sources (there are eleven citations to the former and eight to the latter work).\n\nOther classic prose models had less influence on the panegyrics. Pliny's \"Panegyricus\" model is familiar to the authors of panegyrics 5, 6, 7, 11, and especially 10, in which there are several verbal likenesses. Sallust's \"Bellum Catilinae\" is echoed in the panegyrics 10 and 12, and his \"Jugurthine War\" in 6, 5, and 12. Livy seems to have been of some use in panegyric 12 and 8. The panegyrist of 8 must have been familiar with Fronto, whose praise of Marcus Aurelius he mentions, and the panegyrist of 6 seems to have known Tacitus' \"Agricola\". \nThe Aeduan orators, who refer to Julius Caesar in the context of Gaul and Britain, are either directly familiar with his prose or know of his figure through intermediaries like Florus, the historian. Panegyric 12, meanwhile, contains a direct allusion to Caesar's \"Bellum civile\".\n\nAccentual and metrical clausulae were used by all the Gallic panegyrists. All of the panegyrists, save Eumenius, used both forms at a rate of about 75 percent or better (Eumenius used the former 67.8 percent of the time, and the latter 72.4 percent). This was a common metrical rhythm at the time, but had gone out of style by the 5th century, when metrical considerations no longer mattered.\n\nThe collection comprises the following speeches:\n\nThe panegyrics exemplify the culture of imperial \"praesentia\", or \"presence\", also encapsulated in the imperial ceremony of \"adventus\", or \"arrival\". The panegyrics held it as a matter of fact that the appearance of an emperor was directly responsible for bringing security and beneficence. The orators held this visible presence in tension with another, more abstract notion of the timeless, omnipresent, ideal emperor. The panegyrist of 291 remarked that the meeting between Diocletian and Maximian over the winter of 290/91 was like the meeting of two deities; had the emperors ascended the Alps together, their bright glow would have illuminated all of Italy. Panegyrics came to form part of the vocabulary through which citizens could discuss notions of \"authority\". Indeed, because panegyrics and public ceremony were such a prominent part of imperial display, they, and not the emperor's more substantiative legislative or military achievements, became the emperor's \"vital essence\" in the public eye.\n\nThe formation of the \"Panegyrici Latini\" is usually divided into two or three phases. At first, there was a collection of five speeches by various anonymous authors from Autun, containing numbers 5 through 9 above. Later, the speeches 10 and 11, which are connected to Trier, were appended; when 12 joined the collection, is uncertain. At some later date, the speeches 2, 3 and 4 were added. They differ from the earlier orations because they were delivered outside of Gaul (in Rome and Constantinople), and because the names of their authors are preserved. Pliny's panegyric was set at the beginning of the collection as classical model of the genre. Sometimes the author of the last speech, Pacatus, is credited as the editor of the final \"corpus\". This belief is founded on the position of Pacatus' speech in the \"corpus\"—second after Pliny's—and because of the heavy debt Pacatus owes to the earlier speeches in the collection. Although most of the speeches in the borrow from their predecessors in the collection, Pacatus borrows the most, taking ideas and phraseology from almost all the other speeches. He is especially indebted to the panegyric of 313.\n\nBecause the collection is thematically unconnected and chronologically disordered, Nixon and Rodgers conclude that \"it served no political or historical purpose\", and was simply a tool for students and practitioners of panegyrical rhetoric. Roger Rees, however, argues that the circumstances of its composition (if Pacatus is taken as its compiler) suggest that it was intended to illustrate Gaul's continuing loyalty to Rome. Along the same line, Pacatus' speech of 389 might have been meant to reassure Theodosius (who had defeated the usurper Magnus Maximus in Gaul the previous year) that Gaul was completely loyal to him.\n\nThe \"Panegyrici Latini\" make up most of the sixteen pre-400 Latin prose speeches in praise of Roman emperors that survive today. (The remaining four consist of three fragmentary speeches from Symmachus and one speech by Ausonius.) Only one manuscript of the \"Panegyrici Latini\" has survived into the 15th century, when it was discovered in 1433 in a monastery in Mainz, Germany by Johannes Aurispa. That manuscript, known as M (Moguntinus), was copied several times before it was lost. Two branches of Italian manuscripts derive from a copy Aurispa made of M, X and X. These are also lost, but twenty-seven manuscripts descend from the pair. The evidence of the surviving manuscripts suggests that Aurispa's copy of M was made in haste, and that the Italian manuscripts are generally inferior to the other tradition, H.\n\nAnother independent tradition branches off of M: H (at the British Library: Harleianus 2480), N (at Cluj, Romania: Napocensis), and A (at the Uppsala University Library). H and N are both 15th-century manuscripts, transcribed in a German hand. H shows corrections from a near-contemporary, \"h\". N was copied at some time between 1455 and 1460 by the German theologian Johannes Hergot. Detailed investigation of the manuscripts by D. Lassandro has revealed that A derives from N and N derives from H. H is usually considered the best surviving manuscript.\n\nModern editions of the \"Panegyrici\" incorporate variant readings from outside H. For example, when X and X are in agreement, they sometimes preserve the true reading of M against H. They also contain useful emendations from the intelligent humanist corrector of Vaticanus 1775. Early print editions also prove helpful, as Livineius' 1599 Antwerp edition contains variant readings from the work of scholar Franciscus Modius, who made use of another manuscript at the abbey of Saint Bertin at Saint-Omer (Bertinensis). Bertinensis is now generally believed to be cognate with, rather than derived from, M. Cuspinianus' 1513 Vienna edition has proved more problematic. The relationship of M to the manuscripts Cuspinianus used is a mystery, and additional material, varying in length from single words to whole clauses, is found in Cuspinianus' text and nowhere else. Some scholars, like Galletier, reject Cuspinianus' additions in their entirety; Nixon and Rodgers chose to judge each addition separately. Puteolanus' 1476 Milan edition and \"h\"s corrections have also proved valuable.\n\n"}

However, for various reasons, some have been taken out of rotation of reruns in certain countries, while others were altered or completely banned.\n\n aired on TV Tokyo in Japan on December 16, 1997 at 6:30 PM Japan Standard Time. This episode was claimed to be dangerous for health. 20 minutes into the episode, there is a scene in which Pikachu stops some vaccine missiles with its Thunderbolt attack, resulting in a huge explosion that rapidly flashes red and blue lights. Although there were similar parts in the episode with red and blue flashes, an anime technique called \"paka paka\" made this scene extremely intense, for these flashes were extremely bright strobe lights, with blinks at a rate of about 12 Hz for about 5 seconds in almost , and then for 2 seconds outright fullscreen.\n\nAt this point, viewers started to complain of blurred vision, headaches, dizziness and nausea. A few people even had seizures, blindness, convulsions, and lost consciousness. Japan's Fire Defense Agency reported a total of 685 viewers, 310 boys and 375 girls, were taken to hospitals by ambulances. Although many victims recovered during the ambulance trip, more than 150 of them were admitted to hospitals. Two people remained hospitalized for over 2 weeks. Some other people had seizures when parts of the scene were rebroadcast during news reports on the seizures. Only a small fraction of the 685 children treated were diagnosed with photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nThe news of the incident spread quickly through Japan. The following day the television station that had aired the episode, TV Tokyo, issued an apology to the Japanese people, suspended the program, and said it would investigate the cause of the seizures. Officers acting on orders from the National Police Agency questioned the program's producers about the cartoon's contents and production process. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare held an emergency meeting, discussing the case with experts and gathering information from hospitals. The series exited the airwaves.\n\nLater studies showed that 5–10% of the viewers had mild symptoms that did not need hospital treatment. 12,000 children reported mild symptoms of illness, but their symptoms more closely resembled mass hysteria than a grand mal seizure. A study following 103 patients over three years after the event found most of them had no further seizures. Scientists believe the flashing lights triggered photosensitive seizures in which visual stimuli like flashing lights can cause altered consciousness. Although about 1 in 4,000 people are susceptible to these types of seizures, the number of people affected by this \"Pokémon\" episode was unprecedented.\n\nAfter the airing of \"Dennō Senshi Porygon\", the \"Pokémon\" anime took a four-month break until it returned on April 16, 1998. After the hiatus, the time slot changed from Tuesday to Thursday. The opening theme was also redone, and black screens showing various Pokémon in spotlights were broken up into four images per screen. Before the seizure incident, the opening was originally one Pokémon image per screen. Before the resumption of broadcast, was shown. Broadcast in Japan on April 11, 1998, host Miyuki Yadama went over the circumstances of the program format and the on-screen advisories at the beginning of animated programs, as well as showing letters and fan drawings sent in by viewers, most of whom were concerned that the incident would lead to the anime being cancelled. The seizures were actually caused by animation errors. After that episode aired, prior episodes with seizure-like effects were edited for rebroadcasting (especially the non-Japanese releases).\n\nIn \"Battle of the Quaking Island! Dojoach (Barboach) vs. Namazun (Whiscash)!!\", Ash Ketchum has just finished the Mossdeep City Gym, and his next goal is the final Gym at Sootopolis City. Ash and friends journey toward Jojo Island on the way and are caught in an earthquake caused by Whiscash. They then meet a Pokémon trainer named Chōta.\n\nThe episode was originally set to air in Japan on November 4, 2004, between episode 376, \"Solid as a Solrock\", and episode 378, \"Vanity Affair\", but was skipped due to the episode's similarities to the Chūetsu earthquake on October 23, 2004. The episode was later postponed, but was skipped in rotation order and eventually discontinued. While most of the other episodes were either not dubbed for English-language release or taken out of English-language syndication rotations, this episode of \"Pocket Monsters Advanced Generation\" was the second episode not to air outside of Japan, and the first episode not to air in Japan. Since then the move Earthquake alongside similar moves such as Fissure and Magnitude have not been used in the anime. The episode did not end up as a DVD exclusive.\n\nIn the episode \"Clemont's Got a Secret!\" during the X&Y series, the similar move Bulldoze would appear during a battle.\n\nThe two-part episode \"Team Rocket vs. Team Plasma!\" was originally scheduled to be broadcast on March 17 and March 24, 2011. The Pokémon Smash episode on the week that would've followed by the first part was preempted from broadcast due to the news coverage of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, before being postponed due to the content of the episodes wherein Castelia City is destroyed. There were plans for the episodes to be broadcast at a later date, but there has been no such broadcast. Footage from this episode was later used in the episode \"Meloetta and the Undersea Temple\" originally broadcast on September 27, 2012, as well as in \"Strong Strategy Steals the Show\" originally broadcast on December 13, 2012. Another episode, \"Hiun City Fishing Competition! Fishing Sommelier Dent Appears!!\", was scheduled to be broadcast on April 7, 2011, but was postponed due to the tsunami as well. It was later retitled \"Fishing Sommelier Dent Appears!!\" and broadcast on June 23, 2011, with all references to Hiun (Castelia) City removed from the episode in order to fit into the new continuity.\n\nThe episode \"An Undersea Place to Call Home!\", featuring Ash, Clemont, Serena, and Bonnie helping a Skrelp (Kuzumo) return to its family in a sunken cruise ship, was originally set to broadcast on April 24, 2014. However, the then recent sinking of MV \"Sewol\" led to the episode being pulled from its timeslot with plans for a later broadcast which Japan did eventually see officially on November 20, 2014.\nIt has been said that it had its world debut in South Korea on August 8, 2014. It also finally made its English debut on February 7, 2015, with the season 18 theme song \"Be a Hero\".\n\nThe Pikachu short Pikachu & Pichu (Japanese: ピチューとピカチュウ) has not re-aired or been released on home video or VOD in Japan since 2009 when the Japanese narrator, Noriko Sakai, was arrested and later convicted of abuse and possession of drugs.\n\nThese episodes were never aired in the United States (with one notable exception of Episode 18). As a result, these episodes were never made available in any country airing the English dub, or a redub of this dub.\n\n\"Beauty and the Beach\" is the 18th episode of the original Japanese series. It was originally skipped by 4Kids Entertainment upon the original American broadcast of the series until 2000. On June 24, 2000, a newly produced English-language version of the episode aired on Kids' WB as \"Beauty and the Beach\". Promoted as a \"lost episode\" special presentation, it has only received one rerun and has not yet been shown elsewhere, nor was it included in the English Indigo League DVD boxset or the English Indigo League Champions Edition BluRay boxset released in November 2017. However, as of October 2018, the episode was showing (dubbed and in its correct place in the series) on a 24/7 \"Pokemon\" anime channel provided by streaming service KS Hosting.\n\nIn this episode, the female characters all enter a beauty contest. Team Rocket also enters, with James donning a suit with inflatable breasts. One scene of the episode involved James showing off his artificial breasts for humorous effect, taunting Misty by saying: \"Maybe, one day when you're older, you'll have a chest like this!\". In one scene, he puffs up his breasts to over twice their original size. When it was dubbed and aired in 2000, all scenes of James in a bikini (about 40 seconds) were edited. There were a number of other sexualized scenes, such as one in which Ash and Brock are stunned at the sight of Misty in a bikini and another in which an older man appears to be attracted to her. In addition, all Japanese text on signs, etc. remains intact in this episode, as opposed to other first-season episodes in which it was digitally replaced with English text. \n\nA continuity problem created with this episode's removal is due to a flashback in \"Hypno's Naptime\". Also, this episode marks the first time chronologically that Misty and Brock meet Gary and Delia.\n\n was the second episode to be banned by 4Kids Entertainment. This was the 35th episode of the original Japanese series.\n\nIt was banned due to the appearance of firearms throughout the episode, as well as a scene where Team Rocket's Meowth wears a mustache that looks too much like that of Adolf Hitler. The removal of this episode leads to continuity problems, as Ash captured 29 Tauros in this episode, and he got #30 from Brock with one of his Safari Balls. The Tauros appear in later episodes and are used in Pokémon Tournaments by Ash, and only one episode briefly alludes to where they came from.\n\n4Kids used footage of this episode in the Pokérap which means that they got the episode from Japan. There is no indication that the episode has been dubbed.\n\nA clip from the episode where Ash, Misty and Brock are frightened after pulling up a Gyarados was used in the Pokérap during one of the daily segments and the clips of Rhyhorn, Dratini and Dragonair in the Pokérap are also from the episode.\n\n would have been part of \"\" (season 5), but was skipped over by 4Kids Entertainment and therefore never shown outside of Asia. It was the first widespread ban of a Pokémon episode in four years. This episode, much like episode 39 \"\" (though that episode was only removed from rotation in one country), was also banned because of the appearance of the controversial Pokémon Jynx. Some people believed Jynx was a racial stereotype of Africans similar to those from \"The Story of Little Black Sambo\" because of its big pink lips and pure black skin, or that it looked like a blackface actress. Jynx was later re-edited and given purple skin instead in later episodes.\n\n\"Satoshi (Ash Ketchum) and Nagetukesaru (Passimian)! A Touchdown of Friendship!!\" is the 1,005th episode of the series in general, and the 64th episode of the series \"Pocket Monsters Sun & Moon\". It has no English title, and originally aired in Japan on March 1, 2018. The episode revolves around the Pokémon called Passimian, and during the course of the plot, Ash wears face paint to disguise himself as one of the creatures in a manner that somewhat resembles blackface. It was the first widespread ban of a Pokémon episode in 15 years, the first ban outside of the original \"Pocket Monsters\" series, and the first one during the Pokémon Company International era (2006–present).\n\nThese episodes were temporarily removed after the September 11 attacks for destruction of buildings, the name, and/or weapons in the episode. \n\nThe first episode to be removed from rotation after the September 11 attacks of 2001, mainly because the censors noted similarities between the attacks and Tentacruel attacking the city. The character Nastina also used military-style weapons during the fight scenes in the episode. However, Tentacruel striking a building was not removed from the dub's opening theme, and the episode is still readily available on the home video and DVD markets. The episode was aired a month after the September 11 attacks, and was not aired in the US again until the series began airing on Cartoon Network and Boomerang. It was also not shown for a short time in 2005 following Hurricane Katrina as it portrays a city flooded underwater.\n\nThis episode was temporarily withdrawn after the September 11 attacks due to its title. It has since been aired in the regular episode rotation. The episode features Ash and his friends travelling to Lavender Town to catch a Ghost Pokémon in the Pokémon Tower.\n\n\n"}

He was described as \"the most popular pre-1900 recording artist\".\n\nHe was born in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, and began his career as a dramatic actor in the Boston Theatre Company. He began his recording career around 1891 recording for the New England Phonograph Company. He became famous for his series of comedy sketches about an Irish character named Michael Casey. The recordings consisted of rapid-fire cross-talk between two characters, with Hunting taking all the parts. From 1892 he recorded the Michael Casey skits for Columbia Records, as well as for other companies, and several of his recordings such as \"Michael Casey at the Telephone\" and \"Michael Casey Taking the Census\" (both 1892) became famous. In 1893, Hunting recorded the earliest version of the baseball poem \"Casey at the Bat\" (Columbia Graphophone Grand, #9649). After that, his popular \"Casey\" format was often imitated.\n\nIn 1896 Hunting founded the first independent magazine for the recording industry, \"Phonoscope\", and set up a phonograph shop in New York with his partner Charles M. Carlson. He also, about this time, recorded a series of indecent recordings, for saloons and amusement arcades on Coney Island, using pseudonyms such as Manly Tempest and Willy Fathand. Hunting was identified by his distinctive voice, and a detective working for Anthony Comstock, the founder of the newly formed New York Society for the Suppression of Vice arrested him for violating obscenity laws. Hunting was found guilty and spent three months in prison. Some of Hunting's lewd recordings were included on the 2007 compilation \"\".\n\nIn 1898, a cylinder record company called Leeds Talk-O-Phone had Hunting record a skit, \"Cohen at the Telephone\". He was paid $5 per \"round\", as pantographic duplication yielded about 100 acceptable duplicates of a cylinder. At the end of the fourth round (recording into 4 machines yielded 16 masters) he saw a man carting 24 recordings of his \"Cohen at the Telephone\" away at the end of the studio. Hunting accused Leeds Talk-O-Phone of attempting to defraud him. The company, according to Hunting, made good upon being threatened with exposure.\n\nHunting traveled to England in 1898, and became recording director of Edison Bell Records. After the United Kingdom became involved in the Boer War in 1899, he recorded \"The Departure of the Troop Ship\", with the sounds of \"crowds at the quayside, bands playing the troops up the gang-plank, bugles sounding 'All ashore', farewell cries of 'Don’t forget to write', troops singing \"Home Sweet Home\", which gradually receded in the distance, and the far-away mournful hoot of the steamer whistle.\" According to Fred Gaisberg, Nellie Melba said that the record influenced her above anything else to make records. While Hunting was in England, James H. White recorded \"Casey\" material for Edison Records, around 1901. Then, in 1905, John Kaiser became the voice of \"Casey\" for Edison.\n\nHunting also recorded skits for Zonophone in Britain. In 1904, Hunting and Louis Sterling formed the Sterling Record Company, which became the Russell Hunting Record Company Ltd., in London. The company produced Sterling cylinder records and Linguaphone language instruction records, but went out of business in 1908. Hunting then joined the Pathé company in Paris as director of recording, traveling the world on the company's behalf, and setting up its US arm before returning to Pathé to take charge of its European recording activities. He also maintained an occasional recording career, recording \"The Departure of the First U.S. Troops for France\", again with sound effects of bands and crowds, in New York in 1917.\n\nHe finally returned to the US in 1940. Hunting died in Westchester County, New York, in 1943 at the age of 78.\n\n"}

In this episode, which continued a plot line from the second season episode \"Elementary, Dear Data\", the fictional holodeck character Professor James Moriarty seizes control of the \"Enterprise\" in his quest to be freed to live in reality, outside the confines of a holographic environment.\n\nData and La Forge are enjoying a Sherlock Holmes holodeck program when the two notice that a character programmed to be left-handed was actually right-handed. They call Lt. Barclay to repair the holodeck, but as he checks the status of the Sherlock Holmes programs, he encounters an area of protected memory. He activates it to find the artificial sentient Professor James Moriarty (Daniel Davis) character projected into the Holodeck, who appears to have memory since his creation (\"Elementary, Dear Data\"), including during the period while he was inactive (a feat Picard claims to be impossible). Moriarty wishes to escape the artificial world of the holodeck and was assured by the crew of the \"Enterprise\" that they would endeavor to find a way to free him, and is irritated at the lack of results on the part of the crew and their seeming lack of even the tiniest bit of effort. Picard, along with Data and Barclay, attempts to assure Moriarty they are still working on that goal, but Moriarty is dismissive of that.\n\nMoriarty confuses the crew by seemingly willing himself to existence by walking off the holodeck. He explains this to the stunned Picard and Data by saying, \"I think, therefore I am.\" Moriarty creates a companion for himself, the Countess Regina Bartholomew (Stephanie Beacham), commanding the computer of the \"Enterprise\" to place another sentient mind within a female character of the Sherlock Holmes novels. Moriarty then demands that a solution to get Regina off the holodeck be devised. He takes control of the \"Enterprise\" through the computer, insisting that a way be found for her to experience life beyond the confines of the holodeck.\n\nWhile assisting LaForge, Data observes that LaForge's handedness is incorrect, just as they had experienced earlier. Data determines that he, Picard, and Barclay never left the holodeck, and everyone and everything that appears to be the \"Enterprise\" is part of a holodeck program Moriarty created. At that moment, Picard realizes that he has unwittingly provided Moriarty with the command codes for the Enterprise. With this information, Moriarty takes control of the real Enterprise from within his simulation.\n\nCaptain Picard finds a way to program the holodeck's simulation of a holodeck to convince Moriarty that he and Regina can be beamed into the real world, though in fact they are only \"beamed\" in the holodeck's simulation. Moriarty, satisfied with the ruse, releases control of the ship back to Picard. He and the Countess use a shuttlecraft given to them by Commander Riker to leave the \"Enterprise\" and explore the galaxy. Picard ends the simulation and returns to the real \"Enterprise\". Barclay extracts the memory cube from the holodeck and sets it in an extended memory device in order to provide Moriarty and the Countess a lifetime of exploration and adventure.\n\nPicard mentions the possibility that the crew's reality may actually be a fabrication generated by \"a little device sitting on someone's table.\" This unnerves Barclay enough for him to test the nature of his own reality one more time: he gives an audible command to \"end program\" to test whether he is still in a simulation. There is no response.\n\n\n\n"}

One area of notable success has been the growth of the mobile Internet broadband connectivity. Tele2 has achieved the most success in Russian market, with a customer base increasing by the hundreds of thousands yearly.\n\nIn 2007 the company sold its holdings in Belgium to Dutch operator KPN, in France to SFR and activities in Spain and Italy to Vodafone Italy, in Portugal to Clix and in Switzerland to TDC Sunrise. In March 2008 Tele2 divested its Austrian MVNO operations to Telekom Austria, although retaining its fixed line and internet services. In June 2008 Tele2 sold its Liechtenstein and Luxembourg holdings to Belgian operator Belgacom. The same month Tele2 sold its Polish operations to Netia.\n\nTele2 also tried to sell its German unit in 2007, although no sale actually took place.\n\nIn 2005 they sold their UK & Ireland fixed operations to the Carphone Warehouse for £8.7m. They also pulled out of the Finnish market stating problems with the competitive and regulatory environment after the Finnish government had previously cancelled their 3G licence, due to not completing a network in time.\n\nTele2 operates in Austria since 1999, starting as an alternative fixed-line telephone operator. ADSL internet services were introduced in 2003. One Year later, Tele2 Austria bought UTA Telekom AG, a former competitor, and became the largest provider for alternative telecommunication service in Austria. In addition to fixed-line services, Tele2 Austria is using their infrastructur for carrier services.\nIn the first quarter of 2013, Tele2 Austria had an EBITDA of 38,2 Millionen Euro, a rise of 6 percent.\n\nIn a brief press statement on 11 November 2014, the Sweden-based telecoms group has confirmed that it plans to re-enter the Austrian mobile sector in the second half of 2015.\n\nIn summer 2017 (28.7.2017) Tele2 Austria was bought by Hutchinson Drei Austria, the third largest mobile operator in Austria.\n\nIn Croatia, Tele2 operates a 3G network at 42.2 Mbit/s, same as competitors but at a much wider area, nearly every area covered in standard 3G has access to this 3.75G technology. It also operates a 4G network at up to 150 Mbit/s. , it has 885,542 customers. Revenue for 2015 is 83.72 million euros. On 1 February 2016 Tele2 Croatia started its 4G LTE network. It covers every major city and its surroundings, as well as many rural areas. According to Tele2 Croatia, their 4G network covers 90% of Croatia's population, while their 3G network covers 99% of Croatia's population. In April 2017 Tele2 became the first and as of July 2017 the only mobile operator to offer unlimited flat-rate broadband access without throttling (for voice customers) and partial throttling (for mobile broadband users)\n\nTele2 is operating an HSPA-enabled 3G network in the 900 MHz and 2100 MHz bands as well as a 2G GSM network in the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz bands.\n\nTele2 commercially launched its 4G LTE network in the 1800 MHz and 2.6 GHz bands in November 2012. The 800 MHz LTE band was added in May 2014 and 2100 MHz in July 2015. Tele2 claimed an LTE population coverage of 90% in September 2015.\n\nIn early 2012, Tele2 acquired Televõrgu AS which operated a CDMA2000 1xEV-DO Rev. A network in the 450 MHz band under the 'Kou' brand name. This network was shut down in January 2016.\n\nTele2 used to operate as 2G MVNO in France use Orange network for coverage and joined to Virgin Mobile in 2009.\n\nThey also used to operate alternative fixed line & internet services which they sold to Vivendi unit SFR for €350 million in 2006.\n\nIn Germany, Tele2 provides fixed broadband via ADSL as well as fixed telephony. In July 2013, Tele2 launched mobile voice plans on the E-Plus network.\n\n51% of Mobile Telecom-Service LLP was purchased by Tele2 in early 2010 to serve as a base for the company's mobile services in Kazakhstan. Tele2 has an option to buy the remaining 49% of Mobile Telecom-Service LLP within 5 years after the contract was closed. Tele2 is the smallest of three mobile operators in Kazakhstan with about 4.3 million customers.\n\nTele2 operates as one of the largest nationwide 2G/3G/4G MNO(Mobile Network Operator) in Latvia. Tele2 Shared Service Centre is also located in Latvia.\n\nTele2 operates a nationwide GSM 2G/3G/4G network in Lithuania.\n\nTele2 operates as a 2G/3G MVNO on the mobile network of T-Mobile and in the fourth quarter of 2015 will launch the world's first 4G-only MNO in the Netherlands with nearly 850,000 customers in addition to fixed network triple play services, serving over one million customers in total.\n\nTele2 purchased Versatel in the Netherlands in mid-2005 which allowed it to move away from carrier select services via KPN and onto own infrastructure. The new \"Tele2 Netherlands\" offer a full suite of triple play services.\n\nOn 15 July 2010, Tele2 demonstrated the first LTE network in the Netherlands on the frequencies (2600 MHz) it was awarded licenses for earlier the same year.\n\nIn late 2010, Tele2 Netherlands acquired BBned from Telecom Italia.\n\nThe telecom regulator in the Netherlands, Agentschap Telecom, held a multiband auction which concluded on 14 December 2012. Tele2 was awarded 2x10MHz in the 800 MHz band which together with its previous 2.6 GHz license will enable Tele2 to cost efficiently build a high capacity LTE network with national coverage. Tele2 paid €161M for its licenses which can be considered low, compared to the €1.3bn that KPN and Vodafone paid each for their frequencies and the €900M that T-Mobile will have to pay for theirs. The considerably lower price was a result of spectrum reservation set by the government for a new mobile entrant, with favourable acquisition, Tele2 will enable lower prices for customers and increase competition on the Dutch market. €3.8bn was raised in the auction, which is unprecedented for a country with a population of a mere 16 million.\n\nIn 2015, the organisation launched a new mobile network. The scheme cost approximately $187 million and had been in development since 2014.\n\nTele2 Norway consists of the brands Tele2, OneCall, MyCall and Network Norway. On 7 July 2014, it was announced that Tele2 would be acquired by Telia Company. On 5 February 2015, the deal was approved by Norwegian competition authorities.\n\nTele2 started the operations in the Russian Federation by acquiring 12 regional mobile operators from its sister company Millicom in 2001. This has been expanded to a current 43 regions and with a customer base of over 21 million subscribers, Russia is Tele2's largest market by customer base.\n\nOn 28 March 2013 Tele2 announced that they would sell their Russian operations to the bank VTB for US$2.4 billion plus $1.15 billion in net debt.\n\nSweden is where Tele2 originated and it remains one of its strongest markets serving over 4 million customers.\n\nWhen the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority awarded four licenses for the 3rd generation mobile networks in December 2001, Tele2 was among the winners. Notably Telia, the former telephony incumbent in Sweden, did not receive a license and so an agreement was established to build a 3G network jointly by Tele2 and Telia using Tele2s license. SUNAB builds, owns and operates that 3G network.\n\nA similar company, Net4Mobility, was formed in 2009 between Tele2 and Telenor for the purpose of building a joint 4G LTE network. Unlike 3G, both the parent companies were awarded frequency licenses and so it is likely that this network will outperform other Swedish operators networks simply because there are more available frequencies for the customers. The 4G product was officially launched on 15 November 2010 and currently (as of May 2012) covers over 90 municipalities. \"National\" coverage, able to serve 99% of the population in Sweden, has an expected completion date at the end of 2012. As the equipment used by Net4Mobility can serve both LTE and 2G, the new network built primarily for LTE will also replace the aging 2G networks of Tele2 and Telenor, providing lower cost through shared infrastructure. In addition, it enables EDGE, a service previously not available via Tele2.\n\nDuring its operation in the United Kingdom and Italy, Tele2 was criticised for using the practice of telephone slamming (changing consumer's residential phone line over to a new provider without their consent). In Italy the company was also criticised for blocking P2P traffic without warning its consumers.\n\nThe company was also criticised for faking a meteorite landing in Latvia in October 2009, as a result of which the Latvian government cancelled its contract with Tele2.\n\nIt is currently under investigation for competition and acquisition irregularities in Lithuania, as well as losing its case brought by its Lithuanian competitor through the competition watchdog over LTE ad speed claims. BITE, its fastest growing Lithuanian competitor won its case through the competition authority. It has also been fined and criticised by The Competition Council over misleading advertising.\n\nIt has grown a reputation for aggressive market practice and has been involved in court cases and legal criticisms in several other countries, including Poland.\n\nTele2 pulled out of the Finnish market stating problems with the competitive and regulatory environment after the Finnish government had previously cancelled their 3G licence.\n\n"}

Based on the Archie comic books, created by Bob Montana in 1941, \"The Archie Show\" aired Saturday mornings on CBS from September 1968 to August 1969, when it was replaced by an hour-long version, \"The Archie Comedy Hour\". Filmation continued to produce further \"Archie\" television series until 1978.\n\nThe show revolves around 17-year-old Archie Andrews and his teen-age pals from Riverdale High School including: his best friend and food fiend Jughead Jones, wise-cracking Reggie Mantle, beautiful, spoiled-rich girl Veronica Lodge, and attractive, blonde, girl-next-door tomboy Betty Cooper. On the show, the friends appeared as a bubblegum pop band featuring Archie on lead guitar. \"The Archies\" had a real-life #1 hit single in 1969 with their song, \"Sugar, Sugar\", written by Jeff Barry and Andy Kim.\n\n\"The Archie Show\" utilized a laugh track, the first such example of the colloquially-titled Saturday morning cartoons. Owing to the success of \"The Archie Show\", most animated series would begin using laugh tracks until the early 1980s. Previous animated series that used laugh tracks, such as \"The Flintstones\" and \"The Jetsons\", were broadcast during prime time with the target audience being adults.\n\nA typical episode started with the first Archie story, introduced by Archie and occasionally a different character. Next was a \"dance of the week\" segment starting with a teaser, then after the commercial break Archie introduced the dance, followed by the song of the week performed by The Archies. After that was a short joke followed by the second Archie story. All 17 episodes were presented in this format.\n\n\n\"The Archie Show\" was designed to emulate the live-action series \"The Monkees\" by including rock music into each episode.\n\nThe franchise's most notable effort was the music element in the form of the animated band, The Archies. With vocals provided by Ron Dante and Toni Wine, the fictional group released a series of real-life albums and singles. Their most successful song is \"Sugar, Sugar\", which stood at the top of the pop charts for four weeks in 1969. \"Sugar, Sugar\" became the number 1 song of 1969 on the Billboard charts. (There are also many songs, however, that only appeared on the show and its various spin-offs.)\n\nA cover of \"Sugar, Sugar\", performed by Mary Lou Lord with Semisonic, is included on the 1995 tribute album \"\", produced by Ralph Sall for MCA Records.\n\nThe show's main composer Ray Ellis would later work on other Filmation projects (using the name of his wife, Yvette Blais).\n\n\n\"The New Archie and Sabrina Hour\" was subsequently divided into \"The Bang-Shang Lalapalooza Show\" and \"Super Witch\" during its original network run. While the earlier Archie programs were broadcast by CBS, these last two series were on NBC. It was later repeated in syndication, and on \"The Family Channel\" in a half-hour format as \"The Archie and Sabrina Surprise Package\"; this is the version offered by Universal Television, the current rightsholder for most Filmation programs, including The Archies franchise; a previous rightsholder, Entertainment Rights, was acquired by Classic Media in 2009, followed by DreamWorks Animation's purchase of Classic Media in 2012.\n\nMost episodes from all of these series were syndicated in 1976 as \"The Archies\" (excluding material produced for \"The New Archie and Sabrina Hour\", which did not debut until a year later). The music segments from \"Comedy Hour\" were missing in this syndication package, for unknown reasons.\n\nIn 2010, the show began airing on Retro Television Network.\n\nSingle-disc DVD compilations featuring four episodes each were released in 2004. There were four volumes in all:\n\nOn July 31, 2007, Genius Products released \"The Archie Show\" on DVD in Region 1 for the first time. According to the packaged booklet, the negatives for the dance (the \"Drag\")/song (\"Hide and Seek\") segment on the \"Kids' Day/Jughead 'Sampson' Jones\" episode were lost and had to be sourced from a mediocre video transfer; not even the PAL video transfers were available (many of Entertainment Rights' Region 1 Filmation releases are sourced from PAL-based video transfers, including this series). The video transfer is NTSC-based. In addition, the introduction to the dance segment which occurs before going to the commercial is also lost, along with the \"joke\" segment featured between the weekly song and second \"Archie\" story.\n\nOn March 4, 2008, Genius Products released \"Archie's Funhouse\" on DVD in Region 1 for the first time. Unlike the previous release however, there is no packaged booklet, and thus there is no additional information other than the bonus features contained on the discs. Additionally, while the original negatives for the \"Sugar, Sugar\" video were found, the \"Jingle Jangle\" video was sourced from an NTSC-based video transfer (however, the negatives were recovered for two episodes of the show: episodes 15 and 16; all other episodes [including the \"Funhouse\" segments from \"The Archie Comedy Hour\"] were sourced from the PAL video masters). The 16 episodes themselves are presented in re-edited half-hour formats. Missing are brief bumpers and repeated segments from \"The Archie Show\", already released in their own collection. The set also includes the TV special \"Archie And His New Pals\" and seven compilation episodes culled from \"The Archie Comedy Hour\" (but featuring the \"Archie's Funhouse\" opening and closing titles). The seven compilation episodes account for the \"Funhouse\" and \"Side Show\" segments from 14 episodes of \"The Archie Comedy Hour\". No other music segments from that season (apart from \"Sugar, Sugar,\" \"Jingle Jangle,\" and a performance of \"Get On The Line\" from \"Archie And His New Pals\") are included. This leaves two original episodes of \"The Archie Comedy Hour\" unrepresented altogether; that season's original opening, closing and bumpers are also absent. Genius Entertainment released the \"Sabrina The Teenage Witch\" segments from that season on DVD as part of their own set on April 29, 2008.\n\nHal Erickson, author of \"Television Cartoon Shows, An Illustrated Encyclopedia\" described \"The Archie Show\" as \"not what one could call inspired.\" Erickson criticized the humor that was described as \"executed in a fragmented fashion\" and \"made doubly obvious by the overuse of a canned laughtrack.\"\n\n\nThe \"individual\" versions of \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\" and \"Groovie Goolies\" (both first seen in 1971) are currently offered by present owner DreamWorks Classics.\n\n"}

He was soon performing with Ada Jones and John Bieling as well as the American Quartet. He worked in vaudeville and on Broadway, including in the musical \"Eileen\". Van Brunt had 40 hits on pop charts, including his 1914 duet with Elizabeth Spencer.\n\nIn 1917, Van Brunt began using the name Walter J. Scanlan (newspapers sometimes erroneously rendered the name as \"Scanlon\"), which was the name of a late 19th-century Irish tenor who had had an established career before dying but never made any recordings. It has been suggested, but not proved, that the Irish-American composer of \"Eileen\", Victor Herbert, had encouraged the use of this stage name when he cast Van Brunt as the leading man. It was not a secret that this was a stage name: \"The New York Times\" review of \"Eileen\" stated that Scanlan’s real name was Van Brunt. Van Brunt later had a bigamous affair with a woman known as Ruth Scanlan, siring a child with her and prompting his wife Lillian to sue for divorce, which was granted in 1925 by an Irish-American judge who, in announcing his decision that Van Brunt should pay alimony, criticized Van Brunt's character.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1933, Murray used Van Brunt on various radio programs. In 1929, Scanlon and Billy Murray provided the voices for the Fleischer short animation film \"Finding His Voice\", produced by Western Electric.\n\n"}
