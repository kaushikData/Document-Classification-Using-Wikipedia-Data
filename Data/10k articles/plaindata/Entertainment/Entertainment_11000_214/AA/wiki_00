Damon Herriman and Angus Sampson star as opportunistic, rural fertiliser manufacturers who resort to using human remains for their business. It premiered at the Melbourne International Film Festival on 4 August 2012, and it was released in the United States on 28 June 2013.\n\nReg and Lindsay Morgan own and operate a small blood and bone fertiliser business in country South Australia. While making local deliveries and the occasional roadkill pick up, Reg encounters the crash site of a van, the driver dead inside. Reg recovers the body from the crash and puts it in the back of his own truck. Making his way back to the brothers' plant, Reg is delayed again, this time by three tourists stuck on the side of the road: Sophie, a young woman; James, Sophie's boyfriend; and Wes, James' friend, with whom Sophie is having an affair. Reg takes an instant attraction to Sophie, and, against his better judgement, allows the three to ride with him.\n\nWes and James ride in the back of the truck with the hidden corpse, and Sophie rides up front with Reg. Sophie gets to know Reg, while James tells Wes that he plans to marry Sophie. The pair soon discover the corpse and fear for their lives. Sophie starts to find things in common with Reg, but Reg's anxiety gets the better of him. This unnerves Sophie, and, as soon as the truck arrives at the plant, Reg detains her. Lindsay arrives and demands to know what is going on. Reg suggests that they can grind the people into fertiliser, and Lindsay berates him for his lack of planning for such a bold crime. Ultimately, Lindsay agrees to Reg's idea, and it is revealed that the pair have ground humans in the past: in order to create a new formula for their fertiliser, the pair ground a group of charity volunteers who crashed and died in a nearby road accident.\n\nWes and James are soon detained with Sophie, and the trio watch as Reg and Lindsay grind the driver. At the last minute, Reg becomes convinced that the man is still alive and tries to save him, to no avail. When Wes cuts himself loose and escapes, Lindsay pursues him. Sophie takes advantage of the situation and attempts to seduce Reg, much to James' chagrin. Reg catches on to the ruse and exposes Sophie's infidelity with Wes, further angering James. Lindsay soon returns with Wes, accumulating the body of a local police officer along the way. Reg now begins to have serious second thoughts about the pair's actions. When Nancy, their elderly neighbour, surprises the brothers with a visit, Lindsay stuffs Reg in a car boot with Wes, cutting off Wes' hand in the process. Reg and Wes work together to escape, and Reg enters the house alone to confront his brother.\n\nReg overhears Lindsay tell Nancy that Reg has moved away, perhaps permanently. As Reg gathers his courage, Lindsay and Nancy begin to have sex. Severely disturbed, Reg decides instead to stealthily steal Lindsay's keys. As he is about to take them, Wes stumbles into the house, looking for his missing hand. In a fit of rage, Lindsay kills Wes and Nancy, and Reg flees with the keys. James and Sophie panic when they hear the gunshots, but Sophie decides to return to the farm when she hears Reg call out to her; James angrily breaks up with Sophie as she leaves. After a brief struggle, Lindsay overpowers and ties up Reg. As Lindsay prepares Reg for grinding, Sophie returns and distracts Lindsay. Reg is able to pull him in to the grinder, killing him; afterward, Sophie and Reg share a momentary attraction. In a post credits scene, James hysterically runs onto the road and is killed by a reckless driver.\n\n\nProducer Julie Ryan met the Cairnes brothers at the Australian Film Commission's IndiVision Lab in 2008, and her company Cyan Films, became attached to the project just prior to the Cairnes brothers winning the Horror-Thriller category for scriptwriting at the 2010 Slamdance Writing Competition. The film was funded by Screen Australia, South Australian Film Corporation, Film Victoria and the Melbourne International Film Festival Premiere Fund. In January 2012, production for the film started in Adelaide, South Australia.\n\nThe film premiered at the Melbourne International Film Festival in August 2012. It was then an Official Selection at the 2013 Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival, and released in the US 28 June 2013.\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 83% of 35 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 6.5/10. Metacritic rated it 63/100. Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com called it \"the best low-budget horror comedy since \"Shaun of the Dead\", and one of the most assured first features in ages.\" Jeannette Catsoulis of \"The New York Times\" wrote that film lacks originality but \"has its own hick charm, mostly because of performers who never overplay their hands.\" Mark Olsen of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called it a \"giddy, delightful gross-out horror-comedy mash-up\". Drew Hunt of the \"Chicago Reader\" wrote, \"Though entertaining enough as a genre exercise, the film is too simplistic to transcend its base concept.\" Megan Lehmann of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" called it an \"off-the-wall Australian splatter-comedy\" with \"lively performances\" and \"a shrewdly structured screenplay\". Richard Kuipers of \"Variety\" called it \"a gory and funny riff on the trusty standby of city kids being menaced by rural types\". Kwenton Bellette of Twitch Film wrote that it \"stand out from most horrors; it plays with convention and molds it into a sick and twisted form.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "24287760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24287760", "title": "A Steady Rain", "text": "A Steady Rain\n\nA Steady Rain is a play by Keith Huff. With a plot similar to a real-life event involving Jeffrey Dahmer, it focuses on two Chicago policemen who inadvertently return a Vietnamese boy to a cannibalistic serial killer who claims to be the child's uncle. When he later becomes the man's latest victim, the lifelong friendship of the two men is threatened when it becomes clear someone must bear responsibility for their egregious failure to assess the situation accurately. The play alternates between two separate monologues and present-moment dialogue scenes.\n\nFollowing readings in New York City and Los Angeles, \"A Steady Rain\" was staged by Chicago Dramatists in 2007. It opened on Broadway in September 2009.\n\nChicago police officers Joey and Denny are longtime partners and best friends. Joey is single and lonely, and Denny is married with children; but both men have flaws and serious problems. Introverted Joey struggles with a drinking problem and secretly loves Denny's wife, Connie; angry tough-guy Denny can barely disguise his racism and cheats on Connie with a prostitute on his beat.\n\nThe two men offer contrasting descriptions to Internal Affairs interrogators of their harrowing experiences. They relate how Walter Lorenz, a pimp that Denny has harassed over the years, shoots a bullet through Denny's front window, causing flying glass to sever an artery in Denny's son's neck. Denny pursues Lorenz relentlessly, drawing Joey into a series of dangerous and incriminating activities. During a domestic disturbance call, the two return a frightened Vietnamese boy to a man who says he is the boy's uncle. The uncle turns out to be a cannibalistic serial killer, who eats the boy.\n\n\"A Steady Rain\" initially was produced by Chicago Dramatists in 2007 and then at the Royal George Theatre in Chicago in February 2008. It won the Joseph Jefferson Awards for Best New Work, Best Actor for Randy Steinmeyer, and Best Production.\n\nFollowing a number of staged and table readings and an off-Broadway workshop production, the play began previews at the Schoenfeld Theatre on September 10, 2009 and opened officially on September 29. The 12-week engagement closed on December 6. Directed by John Crowley, it starred Hugh Jackman and Daniel Craig, making his Broadway debut. Set and costume design was by Scott Pask, with lighting design by Hugh Vanstone. The producers announced that the show had broken the record for the highest weekly gross of a non-musical production on Broadway, with a weekly gross of $1,167,954 for the week ending September 20, 2009.\n\nIn reviewing the original Chicago Dramatists production, Chris Jones of the \"Chicago Tribune\" called the play \"a gritty, rich, thick, poetic and entirely gripping noir tale.\" Hedy Weiss of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" wrote, \"Huff provides [the actors] with enough fiery, superbly rendered, often deeply poetic speeches, enough mood shifts, enough emotional cataclysms and action-packed storytelling to keep this hallucinatory roller-coaster ride in motion. I would be happy to see this production again with an audience of real men in blue, just to take the temperature in the room.\"\n\nSteve Oxman of \"Variety\" observed, \"Keith Huff's crackerjack two-hander ... turns out to be less like the perpetual drizzle of its title and more like a snowball that builds to an avalanche. While Huff starts with a couple of familiar characters — good cop/bad cop Chicago patrolmen with alcohol and racism issues — he deepens them into complex figures, compellingly human even when at their most despicable. The adroit character development combines with a billowing narrative to deliver some rattling emotional crescendos... While he could maybe pull back on a contrivance or two, the playwright smartly sticks to his conceit of piling one worse complication on top of another, effectively investing \"A Steady Rain\" with genuine dramatic power and a sense of true tragedy.\"\n\nIn his review of the Broadway production, Ben Brantley of \"The New York Times\", who was generally satisfied with the performances of Jackman and, especially, Craig, wrote, \"If Mr. Huff has not managed to reweave this premise [childhood friends find themselves on opposite sides of the law and in love with the same woman] with any surprising threads, he has packed it with enough lurid incident to fill a season of \"Law & Order\".\"\n\nTime magazine's Richard Zoglin, naming it one of the Top 10 Plays of 2009 and ranking it at #2, commented that \"Casting a couple of big movie stars in a Broadway play can cut both ways. Audiences may stand in line for tickets, but critics can put on their scowling \"show-me\" faces — as many did for Keith Huff's one-act play, which cast Daniel Craig and Hugh Jackman as a pair of Chicago cops in crisis. Both stars were excellent, but they were wonderfully served by Huff's taut, tough-minded script, which takes potentially clichéd material — the moral challenges faced by cops on the urban mean streets — and makes it fresh and compelling.\"\n\n\"Jackman allows you to feel both the warmth and the tyranny of Denny's love. A taller presence than Craig, he takes up more stage space physically and theatrically, which is just how it should be, given the way his character swaggers like the king of his own limited universe.\"\n— LOS ANGELES TIMES\n\n\"Jackman does an excellent job playing a man who heedlessly jumps the median between superego and id, in the best tradition of the self-mythologizing American sociopath. The erstwhile X-man has never spelled danger, with or without muttonchops.\"\n— NY MAGAZINE\n\n\"Under John Crowley's direction, the two stars present the increasingly far-fetched tale with an amiable diffidence that lets them show you their acting ability, as each gets into his character's moments of personal pain, while carefully keeping the sordid events at a distance […] Jackman, with his wonderful easy fluidity, shows once again that he's a natural-born stage star.\"\n— VILLAGE VOICE\n\n"}
{"id": "46991438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46991438", "title": "Agar.io", "text": "Agar.io\n\nAgar.io is a massively multiplayer online action game created by Matheus Valadares. Players control one or more cells in a map representing a Petri dish. The goal is to gain as much mass as possible by eating agar and cells smaller than the player's cell while avoiding larger ones which can eat the player's cells. Each player starts with one cell, but players can split a cell into two once it reaches a sufficient mass, allowing them to control multiple cells. The name comes from the substance agar, used to culture bacteria.\n\nThe game was released to positive critical reception; critics particularly praised its simplicity, competition, and mechanics, while criticism targeted its repetitive gameplay. Largely due to word of mouth on social networks, it was a quick success, becoming one of the most popular web and mobile games in its first year. A Steam version was announced on 3 May 2015 (though never released as of 2018), and the mobile version of \"Agar.io\" for iOS and Android was released on 24 July 2015 by Miniclip. \"Agar.io\" has inspired similar web games called \".io games\", including games with a similar objective but different characters, and games that incorporate elements of other genres like shooter games.\n\nThe objective of \"Agar.io\" is to grow a cell on a Petri dish by swallowing both randomly generated pellets (agar), which slightly increases a cell's mass, and smaller cells, without being swallowed by larger cells. The browser version currently holds five game modes: FFA (Free-For-All), Battle Royale, Teams, Experimental and Party. The mobile version of the game includes FFA (Free-For-All) and Rush Mode. The goal of the game is to obtain the largest cell; players must restart when all their cells are eaten. Players can change their cell's appearance with predefined words, phrases, symbols or skins. The more mass a cell has, the slower it will move. Cells gradually lose a small amount of mass over time.\n\nViruses are green, spiky circles that split large cells. Viruses are normally randomly generated, but can also be generated when receiving enough mass, to the point of splitting into two, hence creating a new virus.\n\nPlayers can split their cell into two, and one of the two evenly divided cells will be flung in the direction of the cursor. This can be used as a ranged attack to shoot a cell in order to swallow other smaller cells or to escape an attack and move quickly around the map. Split cells eventually merge back into one cell. Aside from feeding viruses, players can release a small fraction of their mass to feed other cells, an action commonly recognized as an intention to team with another player. However, a small portion of the ejected mass is lost. Players can also spawn from ejected mass.\n\n\"Agar.io\" was announced on 4chan on 28 April 2015 by Matheus Valadares, a 19-year-old Brazilian developer. Written in JavaScript and C++, the game was developed in a few days. The game originally did not have a name, and users had to connect to Valadares' IP address in order to play. The name \"Agar.io\" was suggested by an anonymous user on 4chan, as other domain names such as cell.io were already taken. Valadares continued updating and adding new features to the game, such as an experience system and an \"experimental\" gamemode for testing experimental features. One week later, \"Agar.io\" entered Steam Greenlight with Valadares announcing a future free-to-play version of the game for download. He planned to include features in the Steam version not available in the browser version, including additional gamemodes, custom styling, and an account system. It was approved for listing on Steam due to community interest. However, the game was eventually removed from the Greenlight program (the Greenlight program its self shut down in 2016), and was never released.\n\nOn 24 July 2015, Miniclip published a mobile version of \"Agar.io\" for iOS and Android. Sergio Varanda, head of mobile at Miniclip, explained that the main goal of the mobile version was to \"recreate the gaming experience\" on mobile, citing the challenges with recreating the game on touchscreen controls.\n\n\"Agar.io\" was released to a positive critical reception. Particular praise was given to the simplicity, competition, and mechanics of the game. \"Engadget\" described the game as \"a good abstraction of the fierce survival-of-the-fittest competition that you sometimes see on the microscopic level.\" \"Toucharcade\" praised its simplicity, strategic element, and \"personality.\"\n\nCriticism was mainly targeted towards its repetitiveness and the controls of the mobile version. Tom Christiansen of \"Gamezebo\" was mixed on the game, saying that there was \"nothing to hold my attention\" and that it was \"highly repetitive, overall.\" \"Pocket Gamer\", reviewing the mobile version, described its controls as \"floaty.\"\n\nBecause it was frequently propagated through social media and broadcast on Twitch.tv and YouTube, \"Agar.io\" was a quick success. The agar.io website (for the browser version) was ranked by Alexa as one of the 1,000 most visited websites and the mobile versions were downloaded more than ten million times during their first week. During 2015, \"Agar.io\" was Google's most searched video game. It was Google's second-most searched game in the United States in 2016. A 2015 press release by \"Miniclip\" stated that \"Agar.io\" was listed as the fifth top game on YouTube’s list of top games.\n\nDuring the campaigns of the June 2015 Turkish elections, \"Agar.io\" was used in Turkey as a medium of political advocacy; many players were naming their cells after Turkish political parties and references, with alliances formed between players with similar political views, battling against other players with opposing views. Some political parties have used \"Agar.io\" in campaign posters as a symbol of support.\n\n\"Agar.io\" was featured (including some details of its gameplay as well as a shot of an actual game) in \"Chapter 48\" of Netflix TV-series \"House of Cards\". Its gameplay was compared to the presidential campaigning.\n\nThe success of \"Agar.io\" has inspired others to create \"Agar.io\" spin-offs, including \"Slither.io\" and \"Deeeep.io\".\n\n\"Slither.io\" is a massively multiplayer browser game developed by Steve Howse. Howse produced the game after discovering the popularity of \"Agar.io\". Unlike \"Agar.io\" where players control a cell on a Petri dish, they would instead control an worm-resembling avatar which consumes multicolored pellets, both from other players and ones that naturally spawn on the map in the game, to grow in size. The objective of the game is to grow the longest worm in the server. It is reminiscent of the classic arcade game \"Snake\".\n\nThe game grew in popularity following its promotion among several prominent YouTube users such as PewDiePie, and topped the App Store shortly after its release. The browser version of the game was ranked by Alexa as one of the 1,000 most visited sites by July 2016, while the iOS version ranked first in the most downloaded apps on the App Store. A mobile version of the game for Android was released on 27 March 2016. Reception to the game was positive, with reviewers praising its appearance and customization but criticizing it for its low replay value and the high price users must pay to remove advertisements.\n\n\"Diep.io\" is a massively multiplayer browser game developed by Matheus Valadares, based on \"Agar.io\" and released around the time of April 2016. The game first appeared on 4chan on 23 April 2016 (By then, the game was already released). In the game, players start as a tank in a variety of game modes, leveling up by destroying other tanks, shapes and other entities in-game to upgrade the player's statistics and into other tanks and dominate the server. It currently has 57 different tanks and 8 different game modes to choose from. Ever since 18 May 2016, the game has a \"changelog\" on the top-left corner of the screen which states the latest updates added to the game.\n\nThe mobile version of \"Diep.io\" for both iOS and Android was released on 20 June 2016 and published by Miniclip. The game has had a generally positive reception, with critics praising its captivating game play but was criticized for \"lacking key features that would have made it better\" unlike other casual games.\n"}

It is a sequel to the 1980 film \"Alligator\".\n\nDeep in the sewers beneath the city of Regent Park, another baby alligator feeds on the experimental animals discarded by Future Chemicals Corporation. Nourished by toxic growth hormones and other mutating chemicals, the gator grows immense in size, develops a voracious appetite and goes out on a killing spree. Nobody believes the sightings until a large number of people are killed, and the police eventually embark on a search-and-destroy mission to put a stop to the alligator's murderous rampage. They track it down to a lake and a police helicopter attempts to blow the alligator up, but to no avail. Afterwards, two officers enter a marsh area where the alligator had escaped to. One of the officers uses a rocket launcher and ends the alligator's reign of terror.\n\n\nThe film has received negative reception, with some critics considering it a retread of the first film. In a review of the original film, Kim Newman of \"Empire\" noted that \"\"Alligator II: The Mutation\" is less a sequel than a lackluster remake\". Almar Haflidason of BBC Online wrote that the film lacked \"the wit and indeed the scares of the original\".\n\n"}
{"id": "27928226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27928226", "title": "Antonio Denzio", "text": "Antonio Denzio\n\nAntonio Denzio (23 September 1689 – after 1763) was an Italian impresario, tenor, and librettist. Born in Venice to a family of musicians and operatic personnel, he pursued a career mainly as a singer until 1724, when he traveled to Bohemia as a member of the opera company of Antonio Maria Peruzzi, probably his uncle. Peruzzi had the idea of bringing an Italian opera company to central Europe to perform first in Prague, then Dresden and Leipzig. The company was first brought to Bohemia under the patronage of Count Franz Anton von Sporck, who had it play at his palace at Kuks in northwest Bohemia in the summer of 1724. The performances were so successful that he permitted the company to perform free of charge in his palace in Prague. After disagreements with Peruzzi, Denzio was able to supplant him as impresario before the end of the year 1724 and continued productions in the Sporck palace until 1735. Peruzzi left with some of the Peruzzi-Denzio players to found the Breslau Opera. Denzio's opera theater at Sporck's palace was the first standing opera theater in the city. His productions were popular with the Bohemian nobility until about 1729, after which Denzio's finances deteriorated. Count Sporck provided no financial assistance to the company except the free use of his theater, and he allowed it to fail. The company went bankrupt and Denzio was forced to spend time in debtors' prison. During its heyday, Denzio was able to attract at least one of the principal singing stars in Italy to Prague each season. The most prominent of all was Margherita Gualandi, who was forced to come to Prague after being blackballed in Italy for bad behavior. Denzio sought the assistance of Antonio Vivaldi in engaging singers for his company, and the composer sent music. In the early 1730s, Vivaldi came himself to Prague. Some of the music for one of his operas composed for Prague, \"Argippo\", has only recently been re-discovered.\n\nIsolated as he was from his operatic base of Venice, Denzio was forced to become a theatrical jack-of-all-trades. He sang himself in the company's productions and also served as its poet. He wrote several full-length librettos, the most significant of which was \"La pravità castigata\" (1730), the earliest opera based on the Don Juan tale to use the original setting and characters.\n\nAfter returning briefly to Venice in 1735, Denzio tried again to mount opera companies in northern Europe, including in Brussels and Augsburg. Unfortunately, all of these ventures failed. The last record of him comes from a newspaper announcement published in Moscow in 1763.\n\n"}

In 1992, the theatre got the status of ‘a state theatre’. \nAccording to its creators, the name of the theatre carries a meaning: YUĞ means ‘an old rite’. Everything, however, is more complicated as it seems, because this burial ritual during which were played the scenes from the life of the deceased, symbolizes a return to the memory. The actors try reminding the spectators of what they knew, maybe even in their past lives, but just forgot.\n\nThe main principle of this avant-garde theatre is the relevance of chosen topics, non-standard interpretation of familiar stories and experimenting with new forms. During its history, the Azerbaijan State Theatre YUĞ has staged more than 90 plays. The theatre’s troupe participated in many international festivals. Today the theatre YUĞ occupies a place in the theatre art of the country. It regularly stages plays by William Shakespeare, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Giovanni Boccaccio, Nikolai Gogol, Kōbō Abe, as well as Azerbaijani classical and contemporary authors.\n\nGoing beyond its space, the theatre YUĞ often collaborates with theatres of different countries, while enriching its skills and influencing the culture of others. The repertoire of the theatre includes the following performances: “Unforgettable Efendi” based on the play by the national writer Ilyas Efendiyev, “Hello from Kafka” based on the novel “The Verdict” by F.Kafka, “The first act” based on the Chekhov’s play “The Cherry Orchard”, “The Shadow” based on the works Y.Nil “Love Under the Elm-tress”, “Come all who….” and others.\n\nIn 2014, the theatre hosted the premiere of the play “Unknown Akhundzade” staged on the basis of comedies of the Azerbaijani playwright and enlightener Mirza Fatali Akhundov and his philosophical treatise “The three letters of the Indian Prince Kemakud-Dowle to the Persian Prince Jalal-ud-Dowle”.\nEach season, the theatre offers new plays, tells us about new theatre personalities, some of whom determine the image of contemporary Azerbaijani theatre.\n"}
{"id": "2226891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226891", "title": "Ballad opera", "text": "Ballad opera\n\nThe ballad opera is a genre of English stage entertainment that originated in the early 18th century, and continued to develop over the following century and later. Like the earlier \"comédie en vaudeville\" and the later \"Singspiel\", its distinguishing characteristic is the use of tunes in a popular style (either pre-existing or newly composed) with spoken dialogue. These English plays were 'operas' mainly insofar as they satirized the conventions of the imported \"opera seria\". Music critic Peter Gammond describes the ballad opera as \"an important step in the emancipation of both the musical stage and the popular song.\"\n\nBallad opera has been called an \"eighteenth-century protest against the Italian conquest of the London operatic scene.\" It consists of racy and often satirical spoken (English) dialogue, interspersed with songs that are deliberately kept very short (mostly a single short stanza and refrain) to minimize disruptions to the flow of the story, which involves lower class, often criminal, characters, and typically shows a suspension (or inversion) of the high moral values of the Italian opera of the period.\n\nIt is generally accepted that the first ballad opera, and the one that was to prove the most successful, was \"The Beggar's Opera\" of 1728. It had a libretto by John Gay and music arranged by Johann Christoph Pepusch, both of whom probably experienced vaudeville theatre in Paris, and may have been motivated to reproduce it in an English form. They were also probably influenced by the burlesques and musical plays of Thomas D'Urfey (1653–1723) who had a reputation for fitting new words to existing songs; a popular anthology of these settings was published in 1700 and frequently re-issued. A number of the tunes from this anthology were recycled in \"The Beggar's Opera\".\n\nAfter the success of \"The Beggar's Opera\", many similar pieces were staged. The actor Thomas Walker, who played Macheath in the original production, wrote several ballad operas, and Gay produced further works in this style, including a much less successful sequel, \"Polly\". Henry Fielding, Colley Cibber, Charles Coffey, Thomas Arne, Charles Dibdin, Arnold, Shield, Jackson of Exeter, Hook and many others produced ballad operas that enjoyed great popularity. By the middle of the century, however, the genre was already in decline.\n\nAlthough they featured the lower reaches of society, the audiences for these works were typically the London bourgeois. As a reaction to serious opera (at this time almost invariably sung in Italian), the music, for these audiences, was as satirical in its way as the words of the play. The plays themselves contained references to contemporary politics—in \"The Beggar's Opera\" the character Peachum was a lampoon of Sir Robert Walpole. This satirical element meant that many of them risked censorship and banning—as was the case with Gay's successor to \"The Beggar's Opera\", \"Polly\".\n\nThe tunes of the original ballad operas were almost all pre-existing (somewhat in the manner of a modern \"jukebox musical\"): however they were taken from a wide variety of contemporary sources, including folk melodies, popular airs by classical composers (such as Purcell) and even children's nursery rhymes. A significant source from which the music was drawn was the fund of popular airs to which 18th century London broadside ballads are set. It is from this connection that the term \"ballad opera\" is drawn. This ragbag of \"pre-loved\" music is a good test for distinguishing between the original type of ballad opera and its later forms. Many ballad operas used the same tunes, such as \"Lillibullero\", and by about 1750 it had become clear that there was a need for new tunes to be written. In 1762, Thomas Arne's \"Love in a Village\" presented a new form of ballad opera, with mainly new music and much less reliance on traditional tunes. It was followed in similar style by Charles Dibdin's \"Lionel and Clarissa\" in 1768.\n\n\"The Disappointment\" (1762) represents an early American attempt at such a ballad opera.\n\nIn 1736 the Prussian ambassador in England commissioned an arrangement in German of a popular ballad opera, \"The Devil to Pay\", by Charles Coffey. This was successfully performed in Hamburg, Leipzig and elsewhere in Germany in the 1740s. A new version was produced by C. F. Weisse and Johann Adam Hiller in 1766. The success of this version was the first of many by these collaborators, who have been called (according to Grove) \"the fathers of the German Singspiel\". (The storyline of \"The Devil to Pay\" was also adapted for Gluck for his 1759 French opera \"Le diable à quatre\").\n\nA later development, also often referred to as ballad opera, was a more \"pastoral\" form. In subject matter, especially, these \"ballad operas\" were antithetical to the more satirical variety. In place of the rag-bag of pre-existing music found in (for example) \"The Beggar's Opera\", the scores of these works consisted in the main of original music, although they not infrequently quoted folk melodies, or imitated them. Thomas Arne and Isaac Bickerstaffe's \"Love in a Village\", and William Shield's \"Rosina\" (1781) are typical examples. Many of these works were introduced as after-pieces to performances of Italian operas.\n\nLater in the century broader comedies such as Richard Brinsley Sheridan's \"The Duenna\" and the innumerable works of Charles Dibdin moved the balance back towards the original style, but there was little remaining of the impetus of the satirical ballad opera.\n\nEnglish 19th century opera is very heavily drawn from the \"pastoral\" form of the ballad opera, and traces even of the satiric kind can be found in the work of \"serious\" practitioners such as John Barnett. Much of the satiric spirit (albeit in a greatly refined form) of the original ballad opera can be found in Gilbert's contribution to the Savoy operas of Gilbert and Sullivan, and the more pastoral form of ballad opera is satirised in one of Gilbert and Sullivan's early works, \"The Sorcerer\" (1877). Balfe's opera \"The Bohemian Girl\" (1843) is one of the few British Ballad operas of the 20th century to gain international recognition.\n\n\"The Threepenny Opera\" of Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht (1928) is a reworking of \"The Beggar's Opera\", setting a similar story with the same characters, and containing much of the same satirical bite. On the other hand, it uses just one tune from the original—all the other music being specially composed, and thus omits one of the most distinctive features of the original ballad opera.\n\nIn a completely different vein, \"Hugh the Drover\", an opera in two acts by Ralph Vaughan Williams first staged in 1924, is also sometimes referred to as a \"ballad opera\". It is plainly much closer to Shield's \"Rosina\" than to \"The Beggar's Opera\".\n\nIn the twentieth century folk singers have produced musical plays with folk or folk-like songs called \"ballad operas\". Alan Lomax, Pete Seeger, Burl Ives, and others recorded \"The Martins and the Coys\" in 1944, and Peter Bellamy and others recorded \"The Transports\" in 1977. The first of these is in some ways connected to the \"pastoral\" form of the ballad opera, and the latter to the satiric \"Beggar's Opera\" type, but in all they represent yet further reinterpretations of the term.\n\nIronically, it is in the musicals of Kander and Ebb—especially \"Chicago\" and \"Cabaret\"—that the kind of satire embodied in \"The Beggar's Opera\" and its immediate successors is probably best preserved, although here, as in Weill's version, the music is specially composed, unlike the first ballad operas of the 18th century.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12946273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12946273", "title": "Canadian clowning", "text": "Canadian clowning\n\nThe Canadian Clowning technique is a mask-based style of performance created by Richard Pochinko. Also known as the \"Pochinko Method\" or \"Clown Through Mask\", seven masks are used, each representing one of the six physical directions (North, South, East, West, Above-above and Below-below). The final, seventh, mask is the clown nose. Variations include a three-mask technique (based on the three polarities) and a six-in-one mask technique.\n\nPochinko taught clowning as a sort of \"reverse therapy\", in which instead of ridding oneself of anxieties, the clown performer leans into their own insecurities and foibles in order to package them as comedy. \"Get applauded for your idiosyncrasies\" was one of his key mottos as a trainer. According to Michael \"Mump\" Kennard, one of the most prominent practitioners and trainers of Canadian clowning since Pochinko's death in 1989, \"Clowns should be fun no matter what the topic is, but the comedy has to come from the tragedy. You just can't go out and be funny all the time. It has no meaning. It still has to be real, because if it's not real, the audience has nothing to relate to.\"\n\nMost clowning techniques (Eastern, European, etc.) focus on basic structure and formalism as the basis from which to start story creation. The Pochinko Clown begins by focusing on one's personal naturally-occurring emotions and impulses, and then structuring that creative licence into a story and performance. One of the most significant distinctions between Pochinko's \"Canadian clown\" technique and other clowning traditions is that Pochinko drew on First Nations performance traditions.\n\nNoted students of the Pochinko technique have included Karen Hines, Cheryl Cashman, Mump and Smoot, Nion, Tantoo Cardinal, Sue Morrison and Sara Tilley.\n"}

{"id": "2269992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2269992", "title": "Cinema of Portugal", "text": "Cinema of Portugal\n\nThe Cinema of Portugal started with the birth of the medium in the late 19th century. Cinema was introduced in Portugal in 1896 with the screening of foreign films and the first Portuguese film was \"Saída do Pessoal Operário da Fábrica Confiança\", made in the same year. The first movie theater opened in 1904 and the first scripted Portuguese film was \"O Rapto de Uma Actriz\" (1907). The first all-talking sound film, \"A Severa\", was made in 1931. Starting in 1933, with \"A Canção de Lisboa\", the Golden Age would last the next two decades, with films such as \"O Pátio das Cantigas\" (1942) and \"A Menina da Rádio\" (1944). \"Aniki-Bóbó\" (1942), Manoel de Oliveira's first feature film, marked a milestone, with a realist style predating Italian neorealism by a few years. In the 1950s the industry stagnated. The early 1960s saw the birth of the \"Cinema Novo\" (literally \"New Cinema\") movement, showing realism in film, in the vein of Italian neorealism and the French New Wave, with films like \"Dom Roberto\" (1962) and \"Os Verdes Anos\" (1963). The movement became particularly relevant after the Carnation Revolution of 1974. In 1989, João César Monteiro's \"Recordações da Casa Amarela\" won the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival and in 2009, João Salaviza's \"Arena\" won the Short Film Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Several other Portuguese films have been in competition for major film awards like the Palme d'Or and the Golden Bear. \"João Sete Sete\" (2006) was the first Portuguese animated feature film. Portuguese cinema is significantly supported by the State, with the government's Instituto do Cinema e do Audiovisual giving films financial support.\n\nPortuguese film history began on 18 June 1896, at the Real Colyseu da Rua da Palma nº 288, in Lisbon, when Edwin Rousby presented Robert William Paul's Animatograph, using a Teatrograph projector. This places the debut of film in Portugal around six months after the Lumière brothers' inaugural presentation in Paris.\n\nThe Portuguese audience was familiar with photographic projection, first from cycloramas, dioramas and stereoscopic views and, later, from the magic lantern, with the projection of transparent photographs through a glass plate then coloured. On 28 December 1894, the German photographer Carlos Eisenlohr opened his \"Imperial Exhibition\" at the galleries of the Avenida Palace Hotel. He presented a novelty to this already knowledgeable Lisbon audience: the live photograph – shown not through an Edison Kinetograph, as announced at the time, but by the Elektrotachyscop or Schnellseher, also called the Electro-Tachiscópio Eisenlohr, an invention by Ottomar Anschutz. The device projected images of actions, of a dog passing by or the galloping of a horse, contained in small disks that produced moving images of extremely short periods.\n\nIn the beginning of 1895, the tobacco shop Tabacaria Neves presented Edison's Kinetoscope (in fact, a copy of said invention, built in London by Robert William Paul, ordered by the Greek George Georgiades, who presented the machine in Lisbon). Unlike preceding inventions, the Kinestoscope allowed individual viewing and a film made up of 1,380 photographs enabling a 20-second projection of 20 seconds.\n\nThe machine that was used for movies at the Real Colyseu was not the Lumiére brothers' Cinematograph, but a competitor, the Theatrograph, by Robert W. Paul. The machine projected behind the screen, allowing life-size images to appear for about a minute. The first presentation of it was well-received and in the following months, many of the same machines swirled in the cinemas of Lisbon, vying for the favour of movie audiences.\n\nAt the Real Colyseu of the Rua da Palma of António Santos Júnior, on 18 June 1896, Edwin Rousby showed films by Robert William Paul's production house, for whom Rousby worked. About a minute in length each, these \"animated views\" were shot by operators who worked for the British producer: \"Parisian balls\", \"The Pont Neuf in Paris\", \"The Train\", \"The Serpentine Dance\", \"A Barber and Shoeshine Store in Washington\".\n\nRousby then met Manuel Maria da Costa Veiga, a photographer with electrical and mechanical skills, who assisted him in preparing his sessions. Costa Veiga himself began acting as an exhibitor, acquiring a projectoscope from Edison that same year and showing films in Lisbon venues.\n\nRobert W. Paul also sent his operator Henry Short to southern Europe, to record the animated views of landscapes for use by the English producing house. Short passed through Portugal, registering several views that, although destined to be shown in London, would be integrated into Rousby's program at his Portuguese sessions in 1897.\n\nHis success is overwhelming, and he prolonged his stays in Portugal and increased the sessions. However, when Rousby proceeded with his tour to the Teatro-Circo Príncipe Real, in Oporto, the animated photograph also gained a professional who would go on to found Portuguese cinema: Aurélio da Paz dos Reis. \nFrom July to August, Rousby presented his films at the Teatro do Príncipe Real (now the Teatro Sá da Bandeira), without achieving, however, the level of success in Lisbon.\n\nThree years after beginning his exhibition business, Costa Veiga purchased a movie camera and made first film, \"Aspectos da Praia de Cascais\" (\"Views of the Cascais beach\"), with images of King D. Carlos bathing in Cascais. He began recording official visits and other relevant national political events. He founded the first Portuguese production house, Portugal Film, headquartered close to his home in Algés.\n\nIn 1909, Portugália Film, made up of João Freire Correia and Manuel Cardoso, was established in Lisbon, financed by D. Nuno de Almada, and the \"Empresa Cinematográfica Ideal,\" Júlio Costa. Freire Correia, a photographer, bought a projector for the opening of the Salão Ideal ao Loreto in 1904, the first Portuguese cinema. He founded his production company five years later, for which he'd make several films, including \"Batalha de Flores\" (\"Battle of Flowers\") that garnered vast success. He was also the cinematographer of \"O Rapto de Uma Actriz \"(\"The kidnapping of an Actress\")\",\" the first scripted Portuguese film, directed by Lino Ferreira in 1907.\n\nFreire Correia directed two documentaries of significant success in 1909: \"A Cavalaria Portuguesa\" (\"The Portuguese Cavalry\") and the \"O Terramoto de Benavente\" (\"The Earthquake of Benavente\"). The first already showed some technique of image capturing, displaying the prowess of Portuguese cavalry in such a way to create a sense of danger, however fictitious, to the audience. The earthquake was filmed in April, and shown two days later – a remarkable speed – and 22 copies were exported abroad. He would also be responsible for the production of two versions of \"Os Crimes de Diogo Alves\" (\"The Crimes of Diogo Alves\"), whose direction he entrusted first to Lino Ferreira in 1909 but that remained incomplete, and a second with João Tavares directing one in 1911.\n\nEarly notable attempts at sound films include the incomplete \"Grisette\" (1908) directed by Freire Correia used adaptations of the Gaumont method by which he attempted to synchronise image and sound. Portugália also produced the first film adaptation of a literary work: \"Carlota Ângela\" was based in the work of the same name by Camilo Castelo Branco and was directed by João Tavares, in 1912.\n\nJúlio Costa, partnering with João Almeida, acquired the Salão Ideal from Freire Correia and Nuno Almada in 1908 and started the Empresa Cinematográfica Ideal production and distribution house. Remodelled and appropriately refitted, the Salão Ideal presented a predecessor of the talkies, the \"Animatógrafo Falado\" (Spoken Animatograph), where a group of people read the script and produced sound in synch with the film's projection. The group was made up of volunteer firefighters of Ajuda, of which not only Júlio Costa but also António Silva, the actor of the Portuguese Golden Age comedies, were members.\n\nWhile waiting for the construction of his studio at Rua Marquês Ponte de Lima, Júlio Costa began filming \"views\". He begins filming features with \"Chantecler Atraiçoado\" (\"Chantecler Betrayed\") and then with \"Rainha depois de Morta\" (\"Queen After Dead\"), by Carlos Santos, the first Portuguese film with a historic motif. Júlio Costa's company pioneered grouping, production, distribution and exhibition, together for the first time. The company would halt activity after a suspicious fire.\n\nIn 1918, Lusitânia Film was founded, a production company with an ambitious outlook, led by Celestino Soares and Luís Reis Santos. They remodelled the old Portugália Film studio, in São Bento, and began filming documentaries. The same year, two short films are made outdoors by Costa Veigam, directed by the young Leitão de Barros: \"Malmequer\" (\"Daisy\") and \"Mal de Espanha\" (\"Evil From Spain\"). The shooting of \"O Homem dos Olhos Tortos\" (\"The Man with the Twisted Eyes\") began, the story based on a Reinaldo Ferreira police serial and directed by Leitão de Barros. However, due to financial pressures, the film was never completed. A well-organized conspiracy would close down the company that intended to film \"A Severa\" as its next production.\n\nAfter the closing of the \"cycle of Lisbon\", the first Oporto production house was founded, which ensured for some years the continuous production of cinema in the country.\n\nAfter founding a production company bearing his name in 1910, the Oporto exhibitor Nunes de Mattos, added Invicta Film to its corporate name two years later. The company filmed current events and documentaries, among them \"O Naufrágio do Silurian\" (\"The Sinking of the Silurian\"), of which 108 copies were shipped to Europe. In November 1917, de Mattos founded the second \"Invicta Film, Lda\", increasing the number of partners and equity. Henrique Alegria took over art direction and they acquired the Quinta da Prelada, in Oporto, where the studios and laboratories of the producer were built.\n\nIn 1918 they left for Paris, and brought back a technical team from the Pathé studios led by Georges Pallu, a director who would author virtually all the feature films of the Oporto producing house. Also in the team were André Lecointe, architect-decorator; Albert Durot, camera operator and Georges and Valentine Coutable – the couple who would be, respectively, the chief lab and chief editor. Durot would later be replaced by Maurice Laumann, also from Pathé.\n\nFor six years, Invicta Film produced several films and documentaries, enriching the Portuguese film landscape. In 1924, however, the company experienced severe financial distress, leading to the laying off all its personnel and continuing only lab work. They shut down in 1928.\n\nRino Lupo, another milestone of cinematography, showed up on the scene through Pallu, who approved his direction of \"Mulheres da Beira\" (\"Women from Beira\"), after a tale by Abel Botelho, with photography by Artur Costa de Macedo. Though the financial disagreements and the unfulfilment of deadlines forced his removal from the company, Lupo still directed \"Os Lobos\" (\"The Wolves\"), another pearl of the Portuguese silent cinema. He directed others, but without the quality of his earlier works.\n\nThree other companies are set up in the '20s to fill in the studios gap: Caldevilla Film, Fortuna Film and Pátria Film. These also follow the Portuguese pattern, hiring foreign technicians for their experience in Portuguese productions. Although the directors brought from French production houses were presented as recognised stars in their countries, in fact, they often built their careers without having the claimed background.\n\nRaul de Caldevilla founded in 1920 his Caldevilla Film, placing production in Lisbon, at Quinta das Conchas, in Lumiar. Frenchman Maurice Mariaud was the director chosen for the works \"Os Faroleiros\" (\"The Lighthouse Men\") and \"As Pupilas do Senhor Reitor\" (\"The Wards of the Dean\"), for the studio's only two productions. The company would shut down due to an acute financial disagreement among its partners.\n\nVirgínia de Castro e Almeida, a children's book writer, founded in Lisbon the studio Fortuna Film, and hires a French lawyer, Roger Lion, to direct productions based upon her books. Lion brought along his wife, actress Gil-Clary, Maxudian, and the cameramen Daniel Quintin and Marcel Bizot, and they shoot \"A Sereia de Pedra\" (\"The Stone Mermaid\") and \"Olhos da Alma\" (\"Eyes of the Soul\"), the latter shot in Nazaré, in what was its first screen register.\n\nHenrique Alegria left Invicta Film in 1922, to found Pátria Film with Raul Lopes Freire. They bought Quinta das Conchas, where Maurice Mariaud directs \"O Fado\". This company too would cease to operate after shooting \"Aventuras de Agapito – Fotografia Comprometedora\" (\"Adventures of Agapito – Compromising Photograph\"), the fourth film directed by Roger Lion in Portugal.\n\nAt the end of the twenties, the \"young Turks\" begin the era of the cinema estates, with the return of Leitão de Barros and the emergence of young António Lopes Ribeiro (who would soon launch Manoel de Oliveira), Jorge Brum do Canto, Chianca de Garcia and Arthur Duarte. Their agenda was to move away from the previous productions, taking inspiration in the aesthetic designs of the French, German and Russian cinemas. Casts also follow this move, bringing to the screen the stars of the Revista, in contrast to the theatre world. Stars such as Eduardo Brazão, Brunilde Júdice, António Pinheiro or Pato Moniz fade, and a new school emerges with the presence of Vasco Santana, António Silva, Maria Matos, Ribeirinho or Maria Olguim.\n\nAt the same time, the state's relationship with cinema was also to change from the end of the '20s. The installed powers understood these young people dominated the cinema press and influenced the masses with their perspectives and wisely viewed the industry as a privileged means of propaganda for their new regime.\n\nAntónio Lopes Ribeiro launched his career benefiting from the 100 meters law. He films \"Uma Batida em Malpique\" (\"A huntin Malpique\") and \"Bailando ao Sol\" (\"Dancing in the Sun\") (1928), the latter with photography by Aníbal Contreiras. He later departed with Leitão de Barros in a visit to the main European studios, where he'll meet Dziga Vertov and Eiseinstein.\n\nDe Barros, who screened at Lopes Ribeiro's home the 9,5 mm film he had made with his brother-in-law in Nazaré, was spurred by the trip and returned to filming with \"Nazaré, Praia de Pescadores\" (\"Nazaré, Beach of Fishermen\"). Again in Nazaré, de Barros films \"Maria do Mar\" (\"Mary of the Sea\"), the second ethnofiction in cinema history, and a milestone for up until then bleak Portuguese cinematography aesthetics. He also directed \"Lisboa, Crónica Anedótica\" (\"Lisbon, an Anecdotal Chronicle\") (1929), where in a series of multiple city scenes, he displays Chaby Pinheiro, repeat stars Adelina Abranches and Alves da Cunha, Nascimento Fernandes, and the unforgettable Vasco Santana and Beatriz Costa.\n\nInspired by Marcel l'Herbier, Jorge Brum do Canto opened with \"A Dança dos Paroxismos\" (\"The Dance of the Paroxisms\") in 1928, playing the main role with his own script. It opened only to a private audience in 1930, however, to only be seen again in 1984.\n\nManoel de Oliveira shot \"Douro, Faina Fluvial\" (\"Douro, River Works\"), with Lopes Ribeiro persuading him to take it to the V International Critics Congress, where it received the praise of Pirandello. But again it will be Leitão de Barros who leaves an imprint in movie history, with \"A Severa\", based upon the work by Júlio Dantas, with the direction of the first Portuguese talkie. A new era of Portuguese cinema was about to begin.\n\nWith the beginning of the Estado Novo right-wing dictatorship in 1933, a new genre of film started, based on the comedy and musical genres, famously the \"A Comédia À Portuguesa\", with the focus on contemporary life and light matters, and the intention of taking the minds of the people from the difficult times faced.\n\n1942 saw the release of \"Aniki-Bóbó\", the first full-length fictional film from Manoel de Oliveira, who would only return to fiction film-making twenty-one years later. It marked a milestone in Portuguese film not only because it differed from the tone most in vogue at the time, as it dealt with social issues, but also because it predated the first Italian neo-realism movies by a few years.\n\nThe Golden Age, as it is known, began that same year with the release of \"A Canção de Lisboa\", and dominated the country for the next two decades. Other famous titles from this popular era are \"Aldeia da Roupa Branca\" (1938), \"O Pátio das Cantigas\" and \"O Pai Tirano\" (1941), \"O Costa do Castelo\" (1943), \"A Menina da Rádio\" (1944) and \"O Leão da Estrela\" (1947).\n\nDuring this period historic films also emerged as an important genre in the Portuguese industry, as a medium for the state party to develop its nationalist propaganda and conservative values, namely \"As Pupilas do Senhor Reitor\" (1935), \"Bocage\" (1936), \"Amor de Perdição\" (1943), \"Inês de Castro\" (1945), \"Camões\" (1946) and \"Frei Luís de Sousa\" (1950). A subgenre of these nationalist films were those related to the culture of Fado and the rise to popularity of Amália Rodrigues, the great name of \"Portuguese song\". Some of those films were \"Capas Negras\" and \"Fado, História de Uma Cantadeira\", both from 1947.\n\n\"Camões\", directed by José Leitão de Barros, was an official selection at the first Cannes Film Festival in 1946.\n\nThe Fifties were mainly years of stagnation with the continuity of the same movies made in the earlier decades, government censorship and glorification of the colonial empire – see \"Chaimite\" (1953); although the first signs of the winds to come were being given by films like \"Saltimbancos\" (1951) and \"Nazaré\" (1952), both directed by Manuel Guimarães and inspired by the Italian neo-realism.\n\nIn 1958 opens the Portuguese Cinematheque with a retrospective of American movies that inspired the French filmmakers of the Nouvelle Vague, an event lauded by then new critics Alberto Seixas Santos e António Pedro Vasconcelos.\n\nIn 1959 \"Portuguese Rhapsody\", directed by João Mendes, was in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe new decade brought a new generation of films, led by \"Dom Roberto\" (1962), \"Os Verdes Anos\" and \"Pássaros de Asas Cortadas\" (1963). The new phase was named Cinema Novo or Novo Cinema (New Cinema), and it refers to Portuguese cinema made between 1963 and the revolution in 1974 by directors such as Fernando Lopes, Paulo Rocha or António da Cunha Telles, amongst others. Like other new waves of the period, the influence of Italian Neo-Realism and the burgeoning ideas of the Nouvelle Vague could be felt keenly.\n\nThe term \"Novo Cinema\" is now used to avoid confusion with the Brazilian movement of the same name. This movement gains particular relevance after the Carnation Revolution, pursuing certain experiences of the French New Wave, both in the field of visual anthropology and of political cinema. The generation of the seventies, taking advantage of the new liberties, explores realism and legend, politics and ethnography, until the late eighties, in conjunction with some directors of the liberated colonies, such as Flora Gomes. Portugal has a notable tradition in the field of docufiction and ethnofiction since Leitão de Barros, who was a contemporary of Robert Flaherty.\n\nFilms during this period also include \"Belarmino\" (1964), \"Domingo à Tarde\" (1965), \"Sete balas para Selma\" (1967) and \"O Cerco\" (1969). In 1973 \"The Vows\", directed by António de Macedo, was in competition for the Grand Prix at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\"A Ilha dos Amores\", directed by Paulo Rocha, was in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival. Other accolades from this period include, in 1985 Manoel de Oliveira winning an Honorary Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival; \"O Bobo\", directed by José Álvaro Morais, winning the Golden Leopard at the 1987 Locarno International Film Festival; \"The Cannibals\", directed by de Oliveira, in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival; and in 1989 \"Recordações da Casa Amarela\", directed by João César Monteiro, winning the Silver Lion at the 46th Venice International Film Festival.\n\nIn 1994 Maria de Medeiros won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the 51st Venice International Film Festival for her work in \"Três Irmãos\", directed by Teresa Villaverde. \"The Convent\", directed by Manoel de Oliveira, was in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival. \"Po di Sangui\", directed by Flora Gomes, was in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. In 1997 \"Genealogies of a Crime\", directed by Raúl Ruiz, was in competition for the Golden Bear at the 47th Berlin International Film Festival. \"The Letter\", directed by Manoel de Oliveira, was in competition for the Palme d'Or and it won the Jury Prize at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. \"Time Regained\", directed by Raúl Ruiz, was also in competition for the Palme d'Or.\n\nNotable accolades of this decade were \"I'm Going Home\", directed by Manoel de Oliveira, in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival; \"The Uncertainty Principle\", also directed by de Oliveira, was in competition for the same award the following year. In 2004 de Oliveira won an Honorary Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.\n\nIn 2005, thirteen Portuguese feature films released, one an animation co-produced with Spain, \"Midsummer Dream\". The most successful film of the year was \"O Crime do Padre Amaro\", with more than 300,000 viewers and grossing more than 1.3 million euros. The following year, 22 feature films were released, five of them documentaries. The most successful film that year was \"Filme da Treta\", with more than 270,000 viewers, grossing more than 1 million euros. In 2006 there were 19 feature films produced. In 2007, 15, in 2008, 21 and in 2009, 23. \"Colossal Youth\", directed by Pedro Costa, was in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. Three years later, \"Arena\", directed by João Salaviza, won the Short Film Palme d'Or at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe first Portuguese animated feature film, \"João Sete Sete\", premiered in 2006 on Cinanima.\n\nIn 2010 Portugal produced 22 feature films.

The film is the first porn parody produced by British studio Harmony Films and directed by Gazzman. The film includes an all-British cast, including Ben Dover and Lexi Lowe as the title character \"Abby\", and was filmed in a castle near Birmingham. Gazzman states that the local town council tried to get the shoot closed down when villagers realized what was going on at their castle, but the production wrapped successfully.\n\n\"Down on Abby\" is set at the beautiful Bottomley Manor, home to the eccentric and debauched Lord and Lady Grabhem and their stepdaughters Abby and Fanny. The film follows the upper-class family upstairs and members of the working-class staff downstairs, including characters with names such as Master Bates, as they prepare for a dinner party quite unlike any other.\n\n\nThe film was released on region-free DVD on 1 April 2014. A softcore version is also available to buy from Amazon.com\n\nTelevision X announced that they had acquired the film's exclusive television rights and would be airing one episode a week from 5 April 2014.\n\n\"Down on Abby\" garnered attention from international mainstream press as well as adult industry-related media since the announcement of its production with mentions from Jimmy Fallon on the \"Jimmy Fallon Show\", \"Cosmopolitan\", \"Time\", \"The Sun-Herald\" and the London \"Metro\" among others.\n\nStars of the main \"Downton Abbey\" show have also expressed dismissive opinions on the porn parody. Michelle Dockery spoke of her \"porn doppleganger\" Lexi Lowe, pointing to Lowe on the cover and saying \"That's me, is it? The one with the extremely large breasts?\" during an interview with Conan O'Brien on \"Conan\".\n\nHugh Bonneville was also asked about his opinion of \"Down on Abby\" by Brad Blanks on the red carpet of \"The Monuments Men\" première in New York City. When told the title, Bonnevile stated \"that's hilarious\" before jokingly asking Bob Balaban if he had directed it. Balaban replied that he had been the assistant director. Bonnevile stated that he \"can't wait to watch it\" and that he would get the \"Downton Abbey\" crew around to watch it for a Saturday night event.\n\nThe parody has had a mixed reception. Mainstream press appear to give generally negative reviews of the parody. A \"New York\" magazine writer commented that although the parody of the \"Downton Abbey\" was humorous, it was \"rife with historical inaccuracies\" and \"not recommended for those who get distracted by historically inaccurate details like squared-off French tips and thongs.\". A writer for \"Cosmopolitan\" magazine wrote: \"What I witnessed were things that were both horrifying and factually incorrect: This nonsense would never have happened at Downton Abbey or any respectable 1920's British country estate\"\n\nIn contrast, adult industry reviewers give a generally more positive review. A reviewer for the porn review website Die Screaming wrote: \"After watching \"Down on Abby\", I can say with absolute certainty that the movie more than lived up to all the hype surrounding it.\" and \"\"Down on Abby\" delivers a solid hardcore porn film wrapped in the luxurious look and feel of British aristocratic wealth, which is exactly what you’d want from a \"Downton Abbey\" porn parody.\" He added \"I also need to take a moment to stand up and applaud Lexi Lowe. Her scene with Tony DeSergio and Clarke Kent was arguably the highlight of the movie, with Ms. Lowe delivering a performance that will make your jaw drop.\" and ended the review with 5/5 stars.\n\nAnother review from adult DVD review site XCritic noted: \"I was surprised at how good I thought the movie was. A porn parody of \"Downton Abby\" was inevitable, but it found a way to get beautiful and sexy stars to parody the costume drama and mix in hot, depraved sex. I loved the puns with the names (Smallcock, Lord Stiffie, Lady Stiffie, etc.) and thought it was very funny overall. This parody is highly recommended.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "53693222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53693222", "title": "Eloquentia Perfecta", "text": "Eloquentia Perfecta\n\nEloquentia Perfecta, a tradition of the Society of Jesus, is a value of Jesuit rhetoric that revolves around cultivating a person as a whole, as one learns to speak and write for the common good.\n\nSteven Mallioux, a Professor of Rhetoric at LMU, concluded that \"an optimal orator would combine written and oral language concepts such as morality or ethics and intelligence.\" This concept has expanded from education in Jesuit colleges and preaching this tradition and guiding Spiritual Exercises to courses in American Colleges such as Loyola Marymount University, University of San Francisco, and Fordham University.\n\nLMU's core curriculum provides a few aspects that construct Eloquentia Perfecta, the first being that \"It incorporates the traditional mode of rhetoric through writing, reading, speaking, and listening.\" The second aspect is, \"The remediation of this form of rhetoric in terms of adapting to the information age and its digital elements.\" \n\nIn ancient Athens, they had a goal of \"perfect eloquence\" in their education system, which was long before the Jesuits existed. They believed that speech had great power and could achieve many things with \"perfect eloquence\" way of speaking. Isocrates taught the \"art of word\" in his school that he opened and continued with words are needed to express one's thoughts.\n\nJesuit education is believed by many Jesuits that the late sixteenth century's Ratio Studiorum was the founding document of Jesuit education. Under Ratio Studiorum, \"perfect eloquence\" was renamed Eloquentia Perfecta. Ratio was developed from an idea from Ignatius of Loyola vision of education which had a baseline of classical humanities with a Renaissance focus. In addition, there was some math and history. As students go up to higher education, there is an integration of the study of science, logic, philosophy, and theology. With each progressive year of education, the Jesuit values of Eloquentia Perfecta is integrated into the curriculum. The goals were not explicit but Eloquentia Perfecta are the ides of \"developing an eloquent and mature. For example, when students gave speeches, they had to adapt to different audiences and be able to speak in a variety of styles to persuade the audience.\n\nAs education of the eighteenth century arose, Jesuit education in France was revised with the addition of sciences, plays, speeches, and the discussion of philosophical ideas. Along with the revision, however, Jesuit education maintained the practices of lectures, critical thinking, public speaking, as well as challenging students with quizzes and exams. The differences between traditional thinking and modern thinking provided a divide during changing times in the Enlightenment. The goal of education remained as the education aimed to strengthen the students communication skills with leadership skills, emotions, and eloquence. Students who attended Universities in the eighteenth century had the option of only getting a master's degree, however towards the end of the century, universities had incorporate BAs (Bachelor of Arts) and BSs (Bachelor of Science) degrees that students could get. If the student wanted to continue their education then they could get their master's as well.\n\nAmerican Jesuit liberal-arts-colleges in the mid-twentieth-century had a new major discipline incorporated into their educational system. In college, students would have to take two thirds of their college requirement credits on liberal education and the other third on their major. Before the twentieth century, students had to learn about classical core education, however, it has changed to a professional field which includes nursing, business, and education. Furthermore, there are still studies in rhetoric and logic that students are required to take involving speech and debate. In the education system, some teachers still use earlier Jesuit colleges methods where they provide lectures and exams while others use more recent methods like discussion and question-answer from students. Graduates from college during this time period say that the most crucial benefit they got out of their educational experience was that they \"learned to think\", which means integrating concepts from the old and new ideas in society in involving a person's mind and character.\n\nIn 1599, the Society of Jesus was presented with \"Ratio Studiorum,\" which included Jesuit educational framework and rules for the professors of rhetoric. Within this framework was the values of Eloquentia Perfecta which was, and continues to be, taught in Jesuit schools worldwide. These schools aim to promote Eloquentia Perfecta by educating their students into ideal orators by incorporating critical thinking, civic responsibility, and ethics into a Jesuit rhetoric curriculum.\n\nGert Beista, the author of \"The Beautiful Risk of Education\", explains that there are three objectives to Jesuit rhetoric that focuses on, \"reconnecting with the question of purpose in education.\" The first is that Jesuit rhetoric provides students with the knowledge, skills, and judgment that enables them to ‘‘do something’’ within their current society such as training for real-world issues with eloquence. The second of the three objectives is \"socialization\" where Beista states that, \"Through education, we become members of and part of particular social, cultural and political orders.\" The last objective is what Beista likes to call, \"subjectification.\" This term is characterized to be the opposite of socialization, in which its emphasis is on individualization and independence in one's thinking and actions.\n\nAlthough Jesuit rhetoric promotes the study of Eloquentia Perfecta, by midcentury in the United States, Jesuit rhetorical studies differed little in comparison to rhetorical studies in non-Jesuit Schools. This is due to the similarity of the fundamental study of Aristotle, Cicero, and Quintilian. After the American Civil War, however, non-Jesuit colleges began to differ in the curriculum. This divergence was due to the molding of non-Jesuit schools by the elective system, while Jesuit colleges conserved classical courses involving Greek and Latin literature.\n\nWith the advancements of Jesuit rhetoric, Jesuit colleges introduced three important rhetorics written by Jesuits. These three rhetorics included \"Ars Dicendi\" by German Jesuit Joseph Kleutgen, \"A Practical Introduction to English Rhetoric\", and \"The Art of Oratorical Composition\" both written by a Belgian-born Jesuit, Charles Coppens. Coppens taught at multiple American Jesuit colleges including the Jesuit seminary St. Stanislaus in Missouri. He defines the three terms rhetoric, oratory, and eloquence. Coppens states that rhetoric is, “the art of inventing, arranging, and expressing thought in a manner adapted to influence or control the minds and wills of others.” He defines oratory as, “the branch of rhetoric which expresses through orally.” Lastly, he defines eloquence as, “the expression or utterance of strong emotion in a manner adapted to excite correspondent emotions in others.” \n\nThe Ignatius of Loyola created a document of the \"Spiritual Exercises,\" a sequence of meditations that have been utilized in universities. These spiritual practices have been around since the sixteenth century and have been more accessible to people around the world as it was published over 4,500 times. Jesuit Spiritual Exercises have been the groundwork of Ignation pedagogy, also known as the Ignation pedagogical paradigm. Ignition pedagogy, which started in 1980's, is the discipline that cultivates a person's understanding, behavior, and contemplation.\n\nMany scholars might have the assumption that the original traditions of Eloquentia Perfecta have been erased in the later century, both through religious and academic teachings. However, though the term has been altered to fit modern society communication, the traditional teachings of the topic are very much alive. Through both digital technology and verbal communication, Eloquentia Perfecta continues to carry on the original goal of rhetorical eloquence to spread justice to all. Many of the Jesuit scholars have had to really adapt to new medians of expression and constantly have to recreate lesson plans for students to adapt to current societal standards. As stated by Morgan T. Reitmeyer and Susan A. Sci in their article, How To Talk Ethically: Cultivating the Digital Citizen through Eloquentia Perfecta, \"News is no longer something to simply consume; rather it is something to which we are compelled to respond within a wide array of media.\" As social justice has become a social phenomenon for current day societies, mainly because news is so easily accessible through digital devices, people are feeling more compelled to speak with Eloquentia Perfecta to portray their message.\n\nAs many Jesuit-affiliated universities have created a required course for all incoming first year students to take on Eloquentia Perfecta, the goal of Eloquentia Perfecta teachings remain, which is to spread the oral and written justice to people all over. Our society's culture today is a place for people to share their voices publicly using all different types of technology. Many of the digital platforms (i.e. Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram) allow people to integrate their personal insight and moral judgments to their followers. There are many famous people whom use their public voice on these platforms in society to relay eloquent, and justice messages to the public. Many of these messages relate to real-life issues within different cultures around the world.\n\nOne prime example of Eloquentia Perfecta, being Jeannie Gaffigan, a writer, actress, and Catholic comedian, was awarded the Inaugural Eloquentia Perfecta Award from Fordham’s Graduate School of Religion and Religious Education (GRE) and the Paulist Press in October 2016. The award was given to Gaffigan because of her constant dedication to capturing the core significance of humanity. As a public figure, and social activist, she shines light on the idea that humanity is full of flaws that must be addressed. She bases her career on bringing people from all over the world together through skepticism, errors and uncertainty. As she receives much of her inspiration through Catholic religion, one of her most inspirational quotes to live by is by St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of Society of Jesus, which reads, “Love ought to manifest itself in deeds rather than in words,” and spreads this faith through her many social platforms.\n\n\"Eloquentia Perfecta.\"\n\nEloquentia Perfecta is the most fundamental goal of all of these four practices listed below. The perfect eloquence is achieved through literature of many different cultures, where one must first understand other cultural and rhetorical languages to master this practice. These practices were all created in the early ages of Jesuit teachings, yet all still are related to modern day times. Eloquentia Perfecta is ultimately the only quality in which one must have to fulfill any sort of leadership role. Many believe that it is more important to have perfect eloquence in language and communication than it is to have any sore of technology-based skills in higher up positions in society.\n\n“The fly in the bottle.”\n\nThis metaphor first came alive by Ludwig Wittgenstein in 1914. It originally was used to help students get out of their comfort ones and expand their critical thinking skills by becoming exposed to different languages and cultures. It have been adopted into modern day education where educators can push students to think about the questions of life that don't necessarily apply to their particular areas of skill.\n\n“Heritage and Perspective.”\n\n\"Heritage and Perspective\" became a popular value in school, as it teaches past-recognition. It is based on the idea that modern day citizens are formed by the past and must grasp the concept that the past is still relevant to today's world. Without the knowledge of the past it is hard to understand some of the current situations in which an individual in society might get caught up in.\n\n“We are not born for ourselves alone.”\n\nFather Pedro Arrupe made the assertion that all students must become people of the world who help people to truly reach the fundamental goal of academic Jesuit teachings. He meant this in a rhetorical and philosophical way and not only referred to pure Jesuit practice. Women and men should be serving others to truly reach the Jesuit-practice goals.\n\n“The spirit of finesse.”\n\nThis phrase became well known by Henri Marrou, as he dubbed it as the opposite of “geometric spirit.” This phrase is made to push its followers into a humane mentality. It is meant to “weave webs with words that reflect the webs we weave with our lives, which are not neat geometric patterns but broken in places and filled with knots and tangles.” \n\n"}

In this way, the colorist may select each object during the rendering process-to the exclusion of the other objects on the page-so that the object's base color may be changed, or to render the colors.\n\nBecause each colorist has preferences as to how the flats are to be done flatters usually work as freelancers commissioned directly by the colorist.

During the more than thirty-year existence of the Network, there have been many successful prime time animated series and Fox cartoons. The first and most famous of these, \"The Simpsons\", was the first such series since the end of \"The Flintstones\" in the 1960s.\n\nWhen the upstart young Fox Broadcasting Company (FOX) network was formed in 1986 by Rupert Murdoch, early shows tended to attract low viewership, with the exception of some early ratings successes such as \"Married... with Children\" and \"21 Jump Street\". The animation industry had experienced a decline in the 1980s.\n\nIn 1987, \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" premiered with mild success. During this time, a series of short cartoons originally intended to be bumpers gained a following with young and old audiences, and Fox ordered thirteen episodes of a new animated television series based on these, titled \"The Simpsons\".\n\nWhen \"The Simpsons\" premiered in December 1989, the series was instantly popular. Merchandise featuring the show’s breakout character Bart Simpson has accumulated over US$1 billion in sales. \"The Simpsons\" was the first successful primetime animated series since \"The Flintstones\", paving the way for other animated series on major broadcast networks. Since its debut, a total of episodes of \"The Simpsons\" have aired, and the series is airing its 27th season in 2015.\n\nIn September 1992, \"\" made its debut, and from December 1992 to March 1993, it aired in primetime while also airing on Fox Kids for several more years.\n\nAlso in September 1992, \"Eek! The Cat\" premiered on Fox Kids. In 1994, it was renamed to \"Eek! Stavaganza\". \"Eek!\" ended in 1997. The only episode of the series to air in primetime was a Christmas special in 1993.\n\nA few \"Tiny Toon Adventures\" specials were also aired in primetime during that show's run on Fox Kids.\n\nIn 1994, \"\" had a brief primetime run as the first two episodes of season 3 aired in primetime on Friday nights in July and August 1994 for two consecutive weeks. The last episode of season 3 (along with an episode of \"Spider-Man\") would premiere in primetime in June 1995.\n\nAlso, in 1994, \"The Tick\", an animated superhero/satirical Children's show based on the comic of the same name aired on Fox Kids. A repeat of the show's Christmas episode aired in primetime in 1996.\n\nA boom in new adult-oriented animated programming began thereafter, with MTV’s \"Beavis and Butt-head\" beginning in 1992, and \"Simpsons\" producers Al Jean's and Mike Reiss’ own series, \"The Critic\", in 1994. \"The Critic\" ran for one season (13 episodes) on its original network, ABC (in 1994); from there, it moved to FOX, where it ran for another season of 10 episodes (1995). \"The Critic\" can be described as a minor success, with DVD sales and late-night showings on cable networks (such as Comedy Central) making it a cult hit. It received critical acclaim, being the only television series to ever be reviewed on \"Siskel and Ebert\", in which it received \"Two Thumbs Up\".\n\nTwo episodes of \"Life with Louie\" aired in primetime before it debuted on Fox Kids. It was created by Louie Anderson. It ended in 1998.\n\nMike Judge left \"Beavis and Butt-head\" in the mid-1990s to begin a new project with \"Simpsons\" writer Greg Daniels. \"King of the Hill\" premiered in January 1997, and was a huge success for the network. In August 1997, \"South Park\" debuted on the cable network Comedy Central, and with its subversive humor and numerous obscenities, it became controversial in a way similar to \"The Simpsons\" seven years earlier.\n\nCreated by comedian Eddie Murphy, the series \"The PJs\" debuted in January 1999. The show was a minor success similar to \"The Critic\", but the show’s high budget caused it to be moved to The WB in 2001, where it lasted one season.\n\nSeth MacFarlane's animated series \"Family Guy\" premiered after Super Bowl XXXIII in 1999. The show was cancelled in 2000, but fan petitions convinced Fox to renew it for a third season. After its third season ended in 2002, the network cancelled the series again and reruns soon began airing on Cartoon Network’s Adult Swim.\n\nRatings for the series increased soon after, and DVD sales skyrocketed. \"Family Guy\" was revived and began airing again on Fox on May 1, 2005. \"Family Guy\" has remained a large success for the network. MacFarlane's follow-up series, \"American Dad!\", began airing on February 6, 2005, and despite low ratings, the series was renewed for multiple seasons on the network before being transferred to TBS in 2014.\n\n\"Futurama\", the follow-up series from \"The Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening, began in March 1999, and was later cancelled (with its last episode aired on August 10, 2003) thanks to scheduling changes (the same fate met previously by \"Family Guy\" during its original run). In a similar move to \"Family Guy\", high DVD sales and ratings led to four separate DVD movies released from 2007 to 2009, all later broadcast on Comedy Central. \"Futurama\" was brought back in 2009 to Comedy Central, with new episodes airing from 2010 to 2013.\n\nFox canceled \"King of the Hill\" in late 2009. Meanwhile, \"The Cleveland Show\", another endeavor from Seth MacFarlane, premiered on the network in fall 2009. It stars \"Family Guy\" character Cleveland Brown.\n\n\"Arrested Development\" creator Mitch Hurwitz and former \"Simpsons\" executive producer Josh Weinstein developed an American version of \"Sit Down, Shut Up\", which premiered in April 2009.\n\nOn January 9, 2011, \"Bob's Burgers\" premiered.\n\nLater, \"Allen Gregory\", \"Napoleon Dynamite\", \"Axe Cop\", \"High School USA!\", \"Lucas Bros. Moving Co.\", \"Golan the Insatiable\", \"Bordertown\" and \"Son of Zorn\" were all cancelled after one season during the 2010s.\n\nOn October 8, 2013, Fox removed the unaired series \"Murder Police\" without airing a single episode.\n\nFOX cartoon series have been the subject of controversy; most notably, \"The Simpsons\", \"American Dad!\" and \"Family Guy\", for their approach to comedy and for the coarse language and jokes that some have said are too raunchy for network TV. These shows have been some of the most risqué material aired on FOX. Fox has also been accused by some groups of corrupting children with cartoons ostensibly for teens and adults. In Venezuela, \"The Simpsons\" and \"Family Guy\" have been taken off the air due to their content. In Russia, \"Family Guy\" and \"The Simpsons\" were subject to lawsuits regarding their content, although in Russia other animated series like \"South Park\" were more controversial.\n\n\n\nMany of the Fox cartoons have had movies made of the TV series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1169762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1169762", "title": "Freedom Fighters (video game)", "text": "Freedom Fighters (video game)\n\nFreedom Fighters is a 2003 third-person shooter video game for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox and Microsoft Windows. It was developed by IO Interactive and published by Electronic Arts.\n\nThe game is set in an alternate history where the Soviet Union has invaded and occupied New York City. The player takes the role of Christopher Stone, a plumber turned resistance movement leader, fighting against the invaders.\n\n\"Freedom Fighters\" is a third-person shooter, in which the player navigates through the streets of New York with a controllable squad of team mates while fighting the occupying Soviet forces. The player gains charisma points by performing various deeds, such as capturing a base or destroying enemy supplies. The more charisma gained, the more squad mates the character can recruit, up to a maximum of twelve. The player can direct recruits by giving them simple orders such as \"follow,\" \"attack,\" and \"defend.\"\n\nThe console versions' multiplayer revolves around securing flags and bunkers. The flag is usually in the center of the map. Bunkers are positioned around the map, and spawn either Soviet soldiers or American freedom fighters. A game can host up to four players via split-screen who may choose between the Soviet and American sides. Each side has a different set of weapons which the players can switch during battle. The players' charisma meters are set to eight, so each player can have a maximum of eight soldiers under their command; however, if it is a four-player battle, each player can control a maximum of four soldiers. The PC version does not support multiplayer.\n\nThe Soviet Union became a world superpower by dropping the first atomic bomb on Berlin, ending World War II, and propping up communist states throughout the globe which begin to surround the US in the present day. New York plumbing brothers Chris and Troy Stone travel to meet with their next client, an activist named Isabella Angelina, only to find her apartment abandoned. The Soviet Union launches a surprise invasion of New York City and suddenly Soviet soldiers, led by General Tatarin, seize Troy. Amidst the attack, Chris escapes to the streets, encountering a man named Mr. Jones and resistance member Phil Bagzton. After rescuing Isabella from a police station and Troy from a post office, the group retreats to the sewers and sets up a base of operations as New York is lost, with the media now being controlled by the Soviet Union.\n\nMonths later, Chris, Phil, and Isabella sabotage key Soviet facilities and reclaim areas within the city, building up a resistance group of New York citizens and disillusioned Soviet soldiers. Chris becomes known as the \"Freedom Phantom\" within the Soviet-controlled media network, SAFN. Troy is captured by Soviet troops and tortured for information. Forced into issuing a public statement aimed at the resistance to cease their actions, he breaks from the prepared text and urges Chris to continue fighting. In response, General Tatarin has Troy taken to Fort Jay and executes him personally. Mr. Jones suggests assassinating Tatarin in retaliation. Chris succeeds, but returns to find Isabella missing and the resistance base occupied by the Soviet Army. The operation was orchestrated by Mr. Jones who reveals himself to be KGB agent Colonel Bulba. Chris escapes with Phil and others to a new underground area while SAFN reports on the death of Tatarin, Colonel Bulba's promotion to General, and the end of the resistance in New York.\n\nDuring the winter, Chris leads the resistance deeper into occupied New York, culminating with a major raid on SAFN Studios. Chris uses the station to send a broadcast encouraging the city and beyond to rise up and bring an end to the Soviet occupation. A final assault on Governors Island, consisting of massed resistance forces, is planned. After capturing Fort Jay and rescuing Isabella, New York is liberated for the time being as Chris and the group solemnly celebrate their victory. Chris knows the Soviets will not give up the occupied United States easily, but resolves to fight on as long as is necessary.\n\nIn 2002, EA Games officially announced \"Freedom: The Battle for Liberty Island\", which would later be renamed \"Freedom Fighters\", at the Electronic Entertainment Expo. The concept for the game originally involved a turn-based strategic mode as a major element of gameplay. The game was developed by IO Interactive, using the 3D engine Glacier. This engine makes use of the OpenGL and Direct X graphic APIs.\n\n\"Freedom Fighters\" was released by EA Games in the U.S. on October 1, 2003, a full week after the UK release. An EA spokesperson stated that retailers in the U.S. had requested the delay. The game is one of the few developed by IO Interactive that was not published by Eidos Interactive.\n\nThe \"Freedom Fighters\" original soundtrack was composed by Jesper Kyd and released on September 29, 2003 by Sumthing Else Music Works and Nano Studios. It was GameSpot's \"Best Game Soundtrack of the Year 2003\" and \"Game Reactor\"'s \"Best Game Music of the Year\".\n\nTracks 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 14 and 16 are performed by the Hungarian Radio Choir. The music has grand, Soviet-style choral arrangements, and the synth parts have been described as \"Vangelis on steroids\".\n\nKyd researched Russian music and musical scales prior to composing the soundtrack, citing Soviet history and the Cold War as major influences. Kyd composed the score in Manhattan shortly after the September 11 attacks.\n\n\"Freedom Fighters\" received generally positive reviews, with an average scoring of 81.5/100 overall by Metacritic and 82.69% overall by GameRankings. It was praised for having an excellent AI for squad tactics, which served to enhance the sense of immersion in the \"extremely detailed\" environments and maintain the illusion of working with a team. The game's sound quality was also of note, both for the realistic combat noises and the game's Russian-influenced music, which \"adds a perfect level of drama to the proceedings.\"\n\nCritics noted that while the game \"does a marvelous job\" of creating a realistic environment, the story was lacking in substance and fairly predictable, and while the squad AI is good, the enemy AI was lacking. Another source of criticism was the game's length. The game can be cleared relatively quickly, but offers little replay value. According to Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot, \"The only real problem with Freedom Fighters is that there simply isn't enough of it. \"\n\nOn April 6, 2004 Eidos UK revealed plans for the sequel. Eidos announced it would distribute the sequel in the latter part of 2005. However, IO Interactive announced development of a new game, \"\", casting the future of a \"Freedom Fighters\" sequel in doubt.\n\nIn 2010, when asked about a potential sequel, \"\" director Karsten Lund refused to comment. In 2011, IO Interactive's official Twitter account tweeted that \"Freedom Fighters 2\" is \"definitely something a lot of us are interested in doing\". In 2017, IO Interactive split from Square Enix and took with them the rights to Freedom Fighters since it was published before the Eidos buyout.\n"}

{"id": "15713038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15713038", "title": "Jennifer's Body", "text": "Jennifer's Body\n\nJennifer's Body is a 2009 American supernatural horror dark comedy film written by Diablo Cody and directed by Karyn Kusama. The film stars Megan Fox, Amanda Seyfried, Johnny Simmons, and Adam Brody. Fox portrays a demonically possessed high school girl who kills her male classmates, with her best friend striving to stop her. The film premiered at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival and was released in the United States and Canada on September 18, 2009. The title is a reference to the song of the same name by alternative rock band Hole on their album \"Live Through This\". As a tie-in to the film, Boom! Studios produced a \"Jennifer's Body\" graphic novel, released in August 2009.\n\nWorking with Cody again following their collaborative efforts on the film \"Juno\", Jason Reitman stated he and his producers \"want to make unusual films\". Cody said she wanted the film to speak to female empowerment and explore the complex relationships between best friends.\n\nThe film had a lackluster performance at the North American box office, making $2.8 million its opening day and $6.8 million its opening weekend, and received mixed reviews from critics; whereas negative reviews criticized the narrative and, specifically, the horror/comic premise for \"fail[ing] to be either funny or scary enough to satisfy\", positive reviews praised the film for its dialogue, Megan Fox's and supporting performances, and emotional resonance. Since 2018, in the wake of the #MeToo movement, the film is increasingly appreciated as a feminist (rather than \"sexy\") horror film.\n\nAnita \"Needy\" Lesnicki, once an insecure and bookish teenager living near Devil's Kettle, Minnesota, is now a violent mental inmate who narrates the story as a flashback while in solitary confinement. Since childhood, she had been friends with a selfish and popular cheerleader, Jennifer Check, despite having little in common. One night, Jennifer takes Needy to a local dive bar to attend a concert by indie rock band Low Shoulder. A suspicious fire engulfs the bar, killing several people. In shock, Jennifer agrees to leave with the band, despite Needy's protests. Later that evening, Jennifer, covered in blood, appears in Needy's kitchen and attempts to eat food from the refrigerator. She immediately vomits a trail of black, spiny fluid and leaves in a hurry.\n\nThe next morning at school, Jennifer appears fine and dismisses Needy's concerns. While the town is devastated by the deaths caused by the fire, Jennifer seduces the school's football captain in the woods and disembowels him. Meanwhile, the members of Low Shoulder gain popularity due to their rumored heroism during the fire and offer to make a charity appearance at the school's spring formal.\n\nA month later, Jennifer has become pale. She accepts a date with school goth/emo Colin, whom she brutally kills. While Needy and her boyfriend Chip have sex, Needy senses something dreadful has happened. She leaves in a panic and almost runs over Jennifer, who is drenched in blood. At home, she again encounters Jennifer, who explains that Low Shoulder had taken her into the woods after the bar fire and offered her as a virgin sacrifice to Satan in exchange for fame and fortune. Although the sacrifice and demonic exchange were a success, Jennifer was not actually a virgin, so she became permanently possessed. Leaving the woods, Jennifer had encountered an exchange student leaving the scene of the fire and made him her first victim. Jennifer states that when she has eaten, she can withstand virtually any injury without pain, healing instantly.\n\nThe following day, Needy goes to the school library's occult section and determines that Jennifer is a succubus who must feed on flesh and can only be killed while she is hungry and weak. Needy tells Chip about her discoveries and warns him not to attend the school dance. He does not believe her, so she breaks up with him in order to protect him. Chip attempts to attend the dance anyway but is intercepted by Jennifer, who takes him to an abandoned pool house and begins feeding on him. Needy arrives there and fights Jennifer. Chip impales Jennifer through the stomach with a pool skimmer, but Jennifer removes it and escapes, while Chip dies.\n\nNeedy goes to Jennifer's home and breaks into her bedroom. She fights Jennifer and stabs her in the heart with a utility knife, killing her and destroying the demon. Jennifer's mother enters and finds Needy on top of her daughter's body. Soon after, Needy is brought to an asylum. In her asylum room, she manifests some of Jennifer's supernatural powers, such as super strength and the ability to levitate due to a non-fatal bite from Jennifer during the fight between them. She escapes the mental facility, hitchhikes a ride to the hotel where Low Shoulder are staying, and murders them.\n\n\n\"Jennifer's Body\" is the follow-up to writer and producer Diablo Cody's and Jason Reitman's collaboration efforts on \"Juno.\" In October 2007, Fox Atomic pre-emptively purchased the rights to Cody's script with Megan Fox to star. Peter Rice, who at the time oversaw Fox Searchlight and Fox Atomic, brought in the project as Fox Searchlight had previously distributed Cody's film \"Juno\". Mason Novick and Reitman's producing partner Dan Dubiecki signed as producers in November 2007 with plans to produce the film under Hard C, which is housed at Fox Searchlight. Reitman commented, \"We want to make unusual films, and anything that turns a genre on its ear interests Dan and I.\" Karyn Kusama was announced as director in January 2008. Kusama said she signed on to the project because of the script. \"I was blessed to read this script at a moment where the producers were meeting with directors and it just knocked me out. It was just so original, so imaginative\", she stated. \"That's what it is about this script and the world is that it feels like a fairy tale gone psycho and I think that's what most fairy tales actually started as.\" Additionally, Cody, Reitman and Kusama knew the film would be R rated because of the language.\n\nIn February 2008, a cease and desist was given to a writer at CC2K.us after they posted an advance script review for the film. The Latino Review also posted an advance review. At the time CC2K.us received their cease and desist order, questions were raised why Latino Review's largely positive script review was allowed to stay posted while CC2K was being forced by Fox Searchlight to remove their mainly negative coverage. Although Latino Review was later asked to remove their review, numerous other websites and blogs published their own critiques of the script.\n\nCody stated that when writing the script, she was \"simultaneously trying to pay tribute to some of the conventions that we've already seen in horror, yet, at the same time, kind of turn them on their ear\". One of her influences from the 1980s horror genre was the film \"The Lost Boys\". She wanted to \"honor that, and at the same time, [she] had never really seen this particular subgenre done with girls and [she] tried to do a little of both\". Despite this, she said she had noticed that \"the last survivor standing in the typical horror film is a woman\" and that because of this she feels \"horror has always had kind of a feminist angle to it in a weird way and, at the same time, it's kind of delightfully exploitative\". \"Jennifer's Body\" could play on both of these aspects.\n\nCody said she wanted the film to speak to female empowerment and explore the complex relationships between best friends. \"(Director) Karyn Kusama and I are both outspoken feminists\", she said. \"We wanted to subvert the classic horror model of women being terrorized. I want to write roles that service women. I want to tell stories from a female perspective. I want to create good parts for actresses where they're not just accessories to men.\" Addressing \"the male-dominated\" horror genre, Cody said \"a key reason for writing the film was to bring to the screen a new way of expressing the intensity of female bonds\" and that the adolescent female friendships she experienced were unparalleled in their intensity. She wanted to show the \"almost horrific\" aspect of such devotion and its relation to parasitism.\n\nThe producers decided to have the film open with the statement \"Hell is a teenage girl\" to reflect the \"horrors\" of puberty and that \"the hellish emotions felt during high school often reappear as teenage girls mature into young women\". Cody stated: \n\nThere's the scene where Jennifer's sitting alone smearing makeup on her face. I always thought that was such a sad image. She's so vulnerable. I don't know any woman who hasn't had a moment sitting in front of the mirror and thinking, 'Help me, I want to be somebody else.' What makes it extra affecting is that [Megan Fox] is stunning.\n\nCody crafted the story to follow a night that ends in a tragic fire, after which Jennifer is kidnapped and set up as a sacrifice which goes awry. Jennifer, now possessed by a demon and subsequently altered into a succubus, sets out on a bloody rampage in which she devours boys, and it is up to Needy to stop her. In sort of a reversal aspect of how puberty changes a girl's life, Jennifer must consume the blood of others once a month or she becomes weak and plain-looking. \"It's a meek shall inherit the Earth sort of thing. I think it's always really satisfying and cathartic to see a character that was previously bullied become super human\", said Cody. Cody said the script is not a reflection of any part of her own life, but that she is more like character Needy. \"I would say I was more of a Needy than a Jennifer. I was never an Alpha female, and I've never gotten off with bullying other people\", she said. \"If I had to choose, I was definitely the one being shoved, not the one shoving.\"\n\nThe nickname \"Needy\" was given to Seyfried's character to underline the essentially condescending dynamic in Jennifer and Needy's high school relationship, as Needy often admires Jennifer and feels she needs her. Cody said \"Jennifer is a product of a culture that pressures girls to be skinny, beautiful and just like movie stars\" and that she \"hopes the film inspires girls to take life into their own hands and do with it, what they want\". \"If I had gone to this movie as a teenage girl, I would've come out of it feeling totally inspired\", she stated. \"I would've wanted to write, I would've wanted to create and I would've felt like I watched something that was speaking to me.\"\n\nAssigned to direct the film, Kusama said, \"I think also a lot of horror is about femaleness – whether it's \"Carrie\" or \"Rosemary's Baby\".\" She said she feels \"like there's a lot of fear of the female or kind of celebration of it in some weird way and something about this movie managed to take the fear and the sense that it's the female that ultimately survives and sort of marry that in a really interesting way\".\n\nAddressing her decision to have Jennifer and Needy be romantically intimate at one point during the film, which takes place in the form of a long and passionate kissing scene, Cody said she did not write the scene to score publicity. Speaking of the scene's media hype, she said that \"if the two protagonists of the film were a guy and a girl and in a particularly tense moment, they shared a kiss, no one would say it was gratuitous\" but \"the fact that they're women means it's some kind of stunt\". The scene was \"intended to be something profound and meaningful\" to her and Kusama. She further stated:\n\nObviously we knew people were going to totally sensationalize it. They're beautiful girls, the scene is hot—I'm not afraid to say that. There is a sexual energy between the girls which is kind of authentic, because I know when I was a teen-aged girl, the friendships that I had with other girls were almost romantic, they were so intense. I wanted to sleep at my friend's house every night, I wanted to wear her clothes, we would talk on the phone until our ears ached. I wanted to capture that heightened feeling you get as an adolescent that you don't really feel as a grownup. (laughs) You like [your] friends when you're a grownup, but you don't need to sleep in the same bed with them and talk to them on the phone until 5 a.m. every night.\n\nThough the film is part comedy, Cody initially intended for it to be a \"very dark, very brooding\" traditional slasher film. Close to \"a third of the way into the process\" she felt that she was incapable of doing so because \"the humor just kept sneaking in\". She stated, \"I have a macabre sense of humor. A lot of the things in the movie that are horrifying are funny to me.\" Feeling that \"comedy films and horror films are kind of similar\" due to being films where you can significantly gauge intense reactions from the audience, Cody stated, \"They're laughing, they're screaming, it's not a passive experience. So, I actually think comedy and horror are kind of similar in that way.\"\n\nHandling the film's special effects were KNB EFX GROUP and the Moving Picture Company (MPC). For Jennifer's demonic form, the creators used different techniques. \"I actually wasn't in [the makeup chair] that much because they created an entire head. They did a live cast of me from the shoulders up. They created me and then put the teeth in\", stated Fox. \"To save my face, they had a photo double that would come in and do most of the crazy monster makeup - they would do that on her. So it would go from me, then in post-production it would somehow go to her and the fake head. They would mix them all together.\"\n\nFor the \"vomit scene\" where Jennifer has just arrived at Needy's house after being murdered and inhabited by a demon, Fox said the liquid she was given to spit out \"was actually ... chocolate syrup initially\". \"We did a few takes where I would just do this scream and sort of puke Hershey's chocolate syrup. Scratch the Hershey's because I don't want to endorse that or anything\", she stated. \"And then, special effects did a rig that clamps onto my ear and you revisit it in the pool scene ...\" Fox said it \"clips on. It goes around the back of my ear and then I bite down on it on the side of my face, like this, and it projectiles. It's a tube ...\"\n\nDirecting the scene, Kusama said it had a classic feel. Fox agreed, \"Yeah, and it projects whatever that material was. I'm not sure. It was pretty intense. I think it was worse for [Seyfried] because she's the one that got puked on. I was the one doing the puking.\"\n\nFor more practical special effects on the set as opposed to CG, Kusama said it \"was a choice that we all sort of made organically\". She said they appreciate \"those kind of effects in older movies and [questions] sometimes how much more effective it is to use a ton of CG\" and that they \"always started with a practical effect and then moved forward from there to lay a groundwork of something that's actually physically, materially there\". They found this to be more enjoyable.\n\nErik Nordby of KNB (known for his work on \"The Haunting in Connecticut\", which also features co-star Kyle Gallner) stated, \"We immediately went into pitch mode in January and spent a solid two weeks trying to not only bid the script but also collect as much reference material and stuff for the first client get together.\" He said the director and producers wanted an \"old-school, hands-off, lo-fi approach to the visual effects\" so that the horror elements would not overpower the storyline. Based on the script, MPC similarly came to the same conclusion and \"provided a clear direction\" for Nordby and his team. \"At that point when we met with them, they had already met with KNB, who had already done up a stylized still of what, at the time, they were calling 'Evil Jennifer,'\" he said. \"There was a lot of info yet to come, but based on the script, Jennifer goes from very beautiful Megan Fox to a very ghoulish, succubus creature whose jaw distends half-way down her face.\" Nordby said the look was eventually toned down at the wishes of MPC. From there, KNB \"produced some tests, grabbing a bunch of stills from [Fox] and [did their] work to indicate how that balance could exist between special effects and visual effects and still maintain a level of subtlety\" and that \"[MPC] responded really well\".\n\nThe teams wanted to \"maintain some sort of the Megan Fox allure\" but said that it was \"incredibly difficult because as soon as [they] warped her face in any direction, the shine kind of came off it\". To combat this, they ended up focusing on anything below her nose, where they had the freedom to make things \"as horrific as [they] needed to\" and then above her nose, \"[they] could manipulate it somewhat with warps and color correction in her eye sockets. So even at her worst, she had some of that sexiness throughout\".\n\nNordby said most of the attention was devoted to Jennifer's face and that \"very quickly in combination\" with special effects and makeup, MPC thought up a five-station system for what Jennifer goes through. Nordby stated:\n\nStage one is beautiful Jennifer and then two and three were strictly makeup where her eyes become more recessed and she would start to look plain like the rest of us. And stage four was some custom dentures that KNB made for her, and then visual effects in stage four was mainly facial warping and recessing her eyes some more and having a pinning effect to her irises and a variety of other musculature deforms, just bringing her cheek bones down more. And stage five was the full on, as crazy as it gets, which you don't really see until near the end.\n\nDuring testing, Nordby and the special effects teams realized that getting Fox in and out of the appliance used to create Jennifer's murderous jaw would be too time-consuming. To remedy this, they hired a photo double. \"[E]very day (for about 10 days) she would sit in a chair with this full appliance on her and we would shoot this jaw, and then all [Fox] would have to do is the dentures\", stated Nordby. He said that \"when it came time to shoot any of these jaw moments, [Fox] would act out in rehearsal how she was going to attack her victim and [they would] fine tune that blocking so it was relatively locked\". The camera accompanied them in the same way, as \"it would roll and she would put her dentures in, and they would really distort her face\" in a way that would produce a satisfying and nice side effect. Additionally, the team would have Fox wear contact lenses and go through exactly the same motions as normal Jennifer. \"But then I would shoot all the key poses that existed in whatever moves the digital double was doing, so that we had as much of that appliance in that lighting condition that we could get\", said Nordby. \"KNB also created a hairless but high detailed head of the stage five Jennifer that had an articulating jaw.\"\nNordby spent a significant amount of time shooting \"the articulating jaw\" scene because they had \"ultimate control over how the light was hitting the head\". He said, \"This so-called jaw shot became a pivotal point, because for four months of the post, the filmmakers thought the film was getting too scary so MPC pulled back on the jaw and then they thought it wasn't scary enough.\" Because of this, \"they pushed back and this jaw went back and forth quite a bit to help navigate where they wanted the tone on any given day\". These different poses helped the two teams perfect the jaw scenes. \"From a marketing point of view, from all the test screenings they did\", said Norby, \"there was a lot of work figuring out how to make this a scary film as well as a funny film.\" Since the team was on a small budget, they \"relied more on skilled artists to think through shots rather than a brute force approach\".\n\nMPC additionally worked on the disappearing waterfall that serves as Jennifer's grave when she is killed at the beginning of the film. They transformed the mysterious waterfall into a whirlpool. \"We came up with an approach that we thought would work because we had a lot of confidence in our water sims\", stated Nordby. \"The waterfall appears both as a day and night shot, so we had to integrate with the water. And the night shots play a pivotal role in the film, and we do a huge crane over.\" They could not lock it to a pan or to a tilt and filming the shots was difficult due to the actual base of the waterfall being out of reach. Nordby said, \"I eventually lowered down a shot—a ton of reference of the area because I knew we'd have to do some digi-matte work to recreate the basin that the whirlpool ends up in.\" They soon realized that there was an insufficient amount of churning and foam to read as real as the location. The CG Supervisor, Pete Dionne, presented a different idea. \"He grabbed chunks of that river and tialing it so that it had a nice stretch of birds' eye point of view of the water that existed on the location in the lighting situation we were trying to match\", stated Nordby. \"And then he projected that onto a whirlpool of animated sprites and had similar enough texture to the actual water that existed there, but pulled control into lighting it and could add depth mainly to the center of it.\" Dealing with \"very shallow\" water, the team had to take extra care when filming the scenes.\n\nDuring the film's fire scene, Cody appears as a character in the barroom. \"To me, I am afraid of fire and fire technics and all that stuff which is why I don't know why I asked to be in the bar scene because I've never exploded before\", she said. She had asked to be set on fire. \"That was me trying to conquer a fear. By the way, they would not allow me to do a full burn for insurance purposes, even though I argued that Burt Reynolds had done it once\", stated Cody. \"But apparently he got really hurt, so they would not let me. To me, there's nothing more horrifying than being stuck in a claustrophobic space as it is burning down so, to me, it was more like tapping into a personal fear. That's not tough.\"\n\nIn late 2007, Fox Atomic had plans to film \"Jennifer's Body\" before a possible writer's strike. When the Writers Guild of America strike began, shooting was then moved to March 7, 2008, in Burnaby, British Columbia, specifically at Robert Burnaby Park near Cariboo Hill Secondary School. Some of the scenes, particularly those situated in a school setting, were filmed in local Vancouver-area schools such as Vancouver Technical Secondary School, Langley Secondary School and University Hill Secondary School.\n\nFox said that while filming her highly anticipated kissing scene with Seyfried that Seyfried was \"extremely uncomfortable\" but that she herself was not. \"I feel much safer with girls, so I felt more comfortable kissing [Seyfried] than kissing any of the other people that I had to kiss\", she said. Seyfried's uneasiness in the scene caused \"giggling fits\" between takes. Seyfried said that neither of them wanted to do the kiss because they felt it was just for promotional purposes. She agreed with Fox that she was uneasy about acting out the scene. \"It was my first time doing a real kissing scene with a woman\", she stated. \"It is just weird. It is a woman. With a woman's smell—soft and floraly—and maybe the pheromones are different. Something about it felt uncomfortable for me.\"\n\nMusic was incorporated as an essential part of the film; there are \"very specific bands\" placed in band posters in some parts, such as in the selection of the band poster on the walls of the bar. Kusama said \"[t]he music was a huge component of the movie\" and this is first evident with \"the songs that we see and hear performed, but then, just the vibe of the movie actually\". She said, \"As the movie progresses, it becomes a pretty clearly music-oriented movie. It's sort of a youth movie. Some of those bands were totally made up and some of them are not.\"\n\nThe review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 43% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 177 reviews and a rating average of 5.1/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"\"Jennifer's Body\" features occasionally clever dialogue but the horror/comic premise fails to be either funny or scary enough to satisfy\". At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews from mainstream critics, the film holds a score of 47 based on 29 reviews out of 100, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a C- grade on a scale of A to F.\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert enjoyed the film, dubbing it a \"\"Twilight\" for boys\" and saying \"as a movie about a flesh-eating cheerleader, it's better than it has to be\". Ebert said that within Cody there is \"the soul of an artist, and her screenplay brings to this material a certain edge, a kind of gleeful relish, that's uncompromising. This isn't your assembly-line teen horror thriller\". Additionally, he complimented Fox as \"[coming] through\" in her portrayal and \"play[ing] the role straight\". He gave the film three out of four stars. Rick Groen of \"The Globe and Mail\" gave the film three out of four stars. Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" stated it is \"Hot! Hot! Hot!\" and that \"Director Karyn Kusama is torn between duty to female empowerment and slasher convention\". He credited Fox's portrayal as showing \"a comic flair\" that \"Transformers\" \"never investigated\". Tom Charity of CNN said \"[the] last time a horror flick tried for a distinctly female point of view the result was \"Twilight\", which was more of a wan gothic romance than a chiller\" and \"Fox makes a convincing vixen, callously picking up victims whenever her luster begins to fade. It's not hard to imagine she can have anyone who takes her fancy\". Charity credited the dialogue as \"bitingly smart, funny teen-speak ... along with sharp pop culture references\".\n\nMary Pols of \"Time\" magazine called the film entertaining and reasoned \"[t]here is a lot of intelligent camp here, and some sharply observed characterizations\" and Cody and Kusama's \"depiction of the ways in which women like Needy are willing to compromise themselves to indulge an ultimately less secure friend is spot-on\". Dana Stevens of \"Slate\" praised the film for being \"luscious and powerful, sexy and scary, maddening at times, but impossible to stop watching\" and a \"wicked black comedy with unexpected emotional resonance, one of the most purely pleasurable movies of the year so far\". \"Elle's\" Karen Durbin said the film not only puts \"a fresh spin on female-centric pop genres but also own[s] them outright\" and is \"rich with first-rate performances\".\n\n\"The Miami Herald\" Rene Rodriguez likened the film's \"[effective exploitation] of the genre as a metaphor for adolescent angst, female sexuality and the strange, sometimes corrosive bonds between girls who claim to be best friends\" to Brian De Palma's 1976 film \"Carrie\". She applauded the film for being fearless when delving into the subject of teen sex and for reversing the tradition/idea that only \"bad girls have sex when they're 16 [and the] good ones—those who, like Needy, do their homework and are responsible—never slide past first base\". Nick Pinkerton of \"Sci Fi Weekly\" called Fox and Seyfried's lesbian kissing scene \"the best close-up girl-girl liplock\" since \"Cruel Intentions\", and A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" concluded \"the movie deserves—and is likely to win—a devoted cult following, despite its flaws\" and \"[these flaws] are mitigated by a sensibility that mixes playful pop-culture ingenuity with a healthy shot of feminist anger\".\n\nGiving a partially negative review of the film was Joshua Rothkopf of \"Time Out New York\", who said the \"movie has a centerfold sheen to it—and some lesbianic soft-core flirtation to match—as its plot dives deeply into \"Twilight\"-esque heavy-melo meltdown in the last act\" and that \"Cody throws one too many losses at Needy; the screenwriter loses her satiric way about halfway through. But for a while, this has real fangs\". Ann Hornaday of \"The Washington Post\" said, \"There's a certain kooky, kinky fun to be had with \"Jennifer's Body\"\" but that \"[a]dmittedly, this is the stuff of lurid adolescent distraction, not great cinema\" and \"is strictly a niche item but provides a goofy, campy bookend to \"Drag Me to Hell\" on the B-movie shelf. Watch it, forget it, move on\". \"San Francisco Chronicle\" Peter Hartlaub stated, \"Enjoy the film for its witty dialogue and fun performances, but know that there isn't a single good scare. An episode of \"Murder, She Wrote\" has more thrills.\" Hartlaub felt the film is not bad, is \"almost always pleasing\" and that Fox \"proves that she has some [acting] range\" but \"the chances that it will be somebody else's pop culture reference 27 years from now are slim to none\". Joe Neumaier of \"New York Daily News\" said, \"Fox merely needs to look either vacant or evil, which the \"Transformers\" boy-toy does spookily well\" but \"[w]ords and story are still the lifeblood of a movie, and \"Jennifer's Body\" is filled like a Twinkie with half-fleshed-out ideas\". Disagreeing with Fox's performance, \"Chicago Tribune's\" Michael Phillips called Fox \"a pretty bad actress\" who \"doesn't seem to get Cody's sense of humor. At all\". He reasoned the \"movie's partially redeemed by Seyfried, who makes her character more than a repository for audience sympathy\" and \"her make-out scene with Fox is handled with more suspense and care than anything else in the movie\".\n\nMichael Sragow of \"Baltimore Sun\" described the only \"perfect aspect\" of \"Jennifer's Body\" as being its title. \"No one is going to like this movie for its brain\", he said. Claudia Puig of \"USA Today\" stated of the film, \"\"Jennifer's Body\" is not as hot as you hope it would be\". Where others praised the film's dialogue, MSNBC's Alonso Duralde called the writing lazy and \"[w]orse still, all of Cody's trademark pop-culture–infused dialogue stands out as artificial and precious\". \"Jennifer's Body\", he said, wants \"so badly\" to be a \"Heathers\"-esque dark comedy, \"but its shortcomings makes you appreciate why that earlier film was so great\". Ty Burr of \"The Boston Globe\" also said the film wants to be like \"Heathers\", and reminded him \"a lot\" of \"Heathers\" but the only scene in the film that \"actually feels dangerous\" is when the possessed Jennifer initiates a long and passionate kiss with Needy, which the film \"very, very nervously backs away from\" and that \"\"Jennifer's Body\" falls into the dispiriting category of dumb movies made by smart people, in this case a glibly clever writer and a talented director who think a few wisecracks are enough to subvert the teen horror genre\".\n\nIn 2018, Constance Grady reported in \"Vox\" that a new critical consensus was forming that appreciated the film as a \"forgotten feminist classic\". She noted that after the #MeToo movement highlighted routine sexual harassment and misconduct in the media industry, the film's story of \"a group of powerful men sacrificing a girl's body on the altar of their own professional advancement\" became uncomfortably familiar, and that the scene of the band laughingly torturing Jennifer recalled Christine Blasey Ford's testimony of Brett Kavanaugh's alleged sexual assault on her. This, according to Grady, allowed viewers to see the film, rather than as a sex fantasy, as a revenge fantasy as Jennifer uses her abused body against her attackers. \"Vox\" also attributed the film's initially poor reception to the reviewers' assumption that \"a teen horror flick\" was intended for a straight, male audience, and that if a film failed to meet that audience's expectations, it failed as a film – exemplified by \"ReelViews\"s assessment that \"if you're in search for a way to ogle Megan Fox's body, there are a lot better ways to do it than subjecting yourself to this\". Now, Grady wrote, this straight male gaze is no longer the default for film critics and a broader audience.\n\nThough the film was expected to pull in a significant number of the late teenage/young adult audience, particularly males aged 17 and older, while Cody hoped for a large female turnout, it earned a \"disappointing\" $2.8 million on its opening Friday and $6.8 million its opening weekend at the North American box office; the film placed #5, while 3D animated film \"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs \"placed #1 with $30.1 million. Produced for $16 million, \"Jennifer's Body\" did manage to attract the sizable female audience Cody wanted; 51% were female, with 70% of patrons under age 25. The film had been expected to benefit somewhat from its heavily marketed lesbian kissing scene between Fox and Seyfried, which, in addition to Fox being in the film, was thought to entice and successfully attract male viewers. Critic Jim Vejvoda at IGN stated that such a scene is not as shocking as it was in past decades and cannot be expected to significantly pull in an audience. The film grossed $16,204,793 domestically and $15,351,268 in international sales, for a worldwide total of $31,556,061.\n\nBox-office analysts and critics debated the film's underperformance. Analyst Jeff Bock, of Exhibitor Relations, reasoned the film underperformed at the box office due to two reasons; the first, he said, is the genre. Bock stated that Americans get horror and comedy, but with the idea \"of those two things together in one place, people suddenly get very dumb\". \"The horror-comedy genre is the toughest sell in Hollywood\", he said. He noted films \"Tremors\", \"Slither\", \"Shaun of the Dead\", \"Eight Legged Freaks\" and \"The Evil Dead\" series, and said that while many of those are considered critical and business successes, \"none of them have brought in the megabucks that a simple horror or comedy can.\" In addition, he labeled the \"Scream\" franchise as more \"straight-up horror\" than comedy and stated \"Zombieland\"s box office performance would determine the horror-comedy genre's current viability.\n\nDespite other R-rated horror films having centered around teenagers, some such as \"Scream\" having been successful, Bock said the second reason \"Jennifer's Body\" under-performed at the box office is the R-rating, which he described as a \"killer\" for the film. He said the film is set in high school and \"sounds like the perfect package for teens\" but that \"the R rating banned many teens from the theaters\" and the studio was left with \"an R-rated film marketed to whom, exactly?\" Nicole Sperling of \"Entertainment Weekly\" felt that it was a slow and disappointing weekend for the box office in general; 3D animated film \"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs\" was steep competition, and with low box office performances by the Matt Damon film \"The Informant!\" and Jennifer Aniston film \"Love Happens\", she concluded that this may support \"the current hypothesis floating around Hollywood, that movie stars no longer matter\" and that it takes more than a name to open a film. S.T. VanAirsdale of \"Movieline\" echoed Sperling's sentiment about the weekend, as \"some of the stinkiest high-profile openings in recent memory\". He concluded five reasons for \"Jennifer's Body\"s underperformance at the box office. The first, he said, is the distributor. \"20th Century Fox's genre wing, Fox Atomic, had \"Jennifer's Body\" in the can by the time the mother ship shut it down last spring\", he said. \"Instead of offloading the film to Fox Searchlight, which nimbly maneuvered Diablo Cody's previous brainchild \"Juno\" to awards-season lucre in 2007, a decision was somehow reached to fill a gap in Big Fox's early fall slate with a gory\" and \"post-feminist horror romp starring Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried\". VanAirsdale classified this as a \"[b]ig mistake\" and that \"[y]ou'd have to go back to \"The Devil Wears Prada\" to find an example of a Fox release that worked without a genuine male lead; you'd probably have to go back to \"Aliens\" to find a genre example of such that they pulled off successfully.\" He named the second reason as the marketing, stating that the film was not well-marketed (whether by billboards, transit posters, lobby standees, or other promotional venues), even in New York.\nVanAirsdale cited the release date and screening as the third and fourth reasons; he said there was confusion about what day the film was going to debut in theaters, and that Toronto is \"a nation removed from the audience where the film's actual momentum had been accruing for at least a month\" and that \"this rarely works for early fall releases; not because news doesn't travel, obviously, but because it peels away a layer of accessibility that accompanies New York and L.A. bows.\" The final reason, he attributed to the critics, believing that the fusion of horror and teen comedy confused some of them. He mentioned Ty Burr's review in particular, and stated that the film could perhaps have used more horror and been funnier, but that the film is \"ultimately a movie about two teenage girls' misadventures in victimization\" and that \"[t]he jokes are virtually incidental to the friction imposed on women who happen to be two sides of the same coin. Who's the monster, and who made the monster? Sorry if you wanted \"Heathers\" with demons, fellas. Equipment's cheap these days; perhaps make your own?\"\n\nHollywood.com box-office analyst and President Paul Dergarabedian said \"the poor numbers don't mean Fox can't open a movie.\" \"It may be a matter of just choosing the right projects for her\", he told the \"Associated Press.\" \"She's trying to find a world beyond \"Transformers\", and she will. She's young and has a lot of promise.\"\n\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on December 29, 2009 in the United States and Canada. In Australia, the DVD and Blu-ray was released on May 18, 2010. The film opened at #11 at the DVD sales chart, making $1.6 million in the first week off 104,000 DVD units. There is a rated and an unrated version, with the unrated version running about five minutes longer than the theatrical version. The UK Blu-ray lacks most of the extras found on the locked US release.\n\nThe film's soundtrack was released by Fueled by Ramen on August 25, 2009, and featured previously released music by various indie rock and alternative rock bands such as White Lies, Florence + The Machine, Silversun Pickups and Black Kids. It also features pop punk band All Time Low and electropop singer Little Boots. In addition, the album features new songs from pop rock artists such as Cobra Starship and Panic! at the Disco and Paramore's lead singer Hayley Williams. The first single from the soundtrack is \"New Perspective\" by Panic! at the Disco.\n\nThe album received a 3 out of 5 review from Allmusic, who described the album as having \"a slightly different spin, mixing indie with the more expected punk, emo, and metal\". Mike Diver at the BBC wrote an unfavorable review of the album, stating that \"This assortment of acts says nothing of its parent film, beyond the occasional reference to school days and nods to something nasty coming this way\".\n\nThe ending sequence of the film itself features a song, \"Violet\", from the album \"Live Through This\" by Hole. This same album also features a song entitled \"Jennifer's Body.\" In total, the film features 22 songs, most of which are included on the soundtrack.\n\nAs a tie-in to the film, Boom! Studios produced a \"Jennifer's Body\" graphic novel. The graphic novel expands on the film's universe and Jennifer's murders of the boys. It was written by Black Metal's Rick Spears, with the first nine pages illustrated by Jim Mahfood (\"Clerks\"). Two covers, in Fox's likeness, were designed; one for the direct market by Eric Jones (available only in comic specialty stores), and the other by Frank Cho for the mass market focusing more on \"hellish Jennifer stories\" with art by Mahfood, Hack/Slash's Tim Seely, DMZ's Nikki Cook, and Popgun's Ming Doyle. The novel was released in August 2009.\n\nThe novel features less of Jennifer than the film, but does capture her \"going in for the kill\" several times. It focuses heavily on following her soon-to-be victims and provides information on their personalities not elaborated on in the film so that readers can better conclude whether the boys deserved to be murdered. The novel consists of four chapters, with a prologue and an epilogue, with art provided for each by different artists. Each one follows a different boy and what is happening in his life just before Jennifer kills him.\n\nOn creating the story, Spears stated, \"The best part for me as a writer was to show some events from the movie from a different point of view, sort of like \"Rashomon\" for you Kurosawa fans. And with comics we can get into the character's heads in a way that works well in comics and novels more so than in film.\" He stated, \"... I was using the medium to change what we really know about these characters and twist around what we see in the movies. All the academics aside, it's also very funny and gore splattered.\"\n\nSpears stated that while writing the stories, the film was still being made and he had not seen any of it at the time. He mainly learned about the characters through the script. \"I got to read the screenplay. It was kinda crazy writing characters that were being changed on set and in the editing process. I had to bob and weave to keep up but that was all part of the fun\", he said.\n\n\n"}

Along with that, slow-dancing was the primary method of dancing at the time. However; the rise of Rock and Roll music initially made it hard for people to dance when it was popularized in the early 1950s, however people quickly adapted to it and started dancing at higher speeds almost coinciding the rise of DJ-based dancefloors. Live bands have quickly been displaced by DJ-based dancefloors as the DJ stands took up less space than bandstands and that it played recorded music.\n\nLive band dances are still used on occasion at ballrooms. Along with that, moshpits have live punk rock bands, so people are able to hear the hardcore sound associated with moshing. Some formal dances such as proms use live bands as a means of serving the dancefloor. Also, some people choose live bands because they believe there are virtually no space constraints for the band's instruments. Dance parties with high-end formality have also preferred live bands as means of serving the dancefloor.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "52111188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52111188", "title": "Mae Barnes", "text": "Mae Barnes\n\nMae Barnes (born Edith Mae Stith, possibly January 23, 1907 – December 13, 1996) was an African-American jazz singer, dancer and comic entertainer. She was responsible for introducing the Charleston dance to Broadway in the 1924 revue \"Runnin' Wild\". After her career as a dancer ended, she became a successful nightclub singer and recording artist.\n\nShe was born in New York City. There is some uncertainty over her year of birth. Most sources give 1907, but blues researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc give 1892, based on 1900 and 1910 US census records, though the 1892 date would suggest that she died at the age of 104.\n\nAround 1919, she left school, purportedly to move to Cleveland, Ohio, but instead started working as a chorus girl. Developing expertise as a singer and tap dancer, she worked in vaudeville and toured the south in such shows as \"Bon Bon Buddy Jr.\" and \"Dinah\". In 1924, she made her Broadway debut in \"Runnin' Wild\", in which she introduced the Charleston dance, and became known as \"the bronze Ann Pennington\".\n\nOn her second tour, in \"Shuffle Along\" (1927), the entertainer Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson called her \"the greatest living female tap dancer\". She also performed with Charlie Ruggles in the Broadway show \"Rainbow\", and danced an \"insanely comic\" version of the Black Bottom. She continued to perform as a dancer and entertainer in Broadway shows, including the \"Ziegfeld Follies\" and \"Hot Rhythm\", and toured on the Keith vaudeville circuit through most of the 1930s.\n\nIn 1938, she broke her pelvis in an automobile accident. This effectively ended her career as a dancer, and she diverted her energies into singing. She sang in nightclubs in Hollywood, Honolulu, and New York City, including a seven-year residency at the Boite in Greenwich Village, and at clubs in Park Avenue. In the late 1940s she featured at parties including those hosted by socialite Elsa Maxwell, and gave fundraising benefit shows for hospitals. She toured Europe in 1950, and stayed in London to take the lead in Jack Hylton's revue, \"Knight of Madness\".\n\nAfter returning to New York in 1951, she became the main attraction at the Bon Soir club on Eighth Street, accompanied by a vocal group, the Three Flames (Tiger Haynes, Roy Testamark and Averill Pollard). They attracted the attention of Ahmet and Nesuhi Ertegun of Atlantic Records, who issued Barnes' first EP in 1953 and an LP, \"Fun with Mae Barnes\", the following year. She was accompanied by Garland Wilson and the Three Flames, and the songs included \"(I Ain't Gonna Be No) Topsy\", a celebration of black pride, and \"On the Sunny Side of the Street\", which became her signature song. She became well known for her \"sassy\" song interpretations, and for \"her irreverent interpolations into familiar lyrics\".\n\nIn the mid-1950s she appeared regularly on TV variety shows, and headlined at the Apollo Theatre. She recorded another album, \"Mae Barnes\", on which she was backed by a jazz group led by trumpeter Buck Clayton, in 1958 for Vanguard Records. Although it was not successful, she continued as a popular live act, and in 1960 the Erteguns recorded her performance at the Playboy Club for a further album, although it remained unreleased. She continued to perform in clubs through the 1970s and 1980s, and featured in a documentary, \"Wild Women Don't Have the Blues\", in 1987.\n\nMae Barnes died from cancer in hospital in New York in 1996 (not Boston in 1997, as reported in some sources). She left no close relatives.\n\n"}

{"id": "32112949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32112949", "title": "Pacific Rim (film)", "text": "Pacific Rim (film)\n\nPacific Rim is a 2013 American science fiction monster film directed by Guillermo del Toro and starring Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi, Charlie Day, Burn Gorman, Robert Kazinsky, Max Martini, and Ron Perlman. The screenplay was written by Travis Beacham and del Toro from a story by Beacham. The film is set in the future, when Earth is at war with the Kaiju, colossal sea monsters which have emerged from an interdimensional portal on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. To combat the monsters, humanity unites to create the Jaegers, gigantic humanoid mechas, each controlled by at least two pilots, whose minds are joined by a mental link. Focusing on the war's later days, the story follows Raleigh Becket, a washed-up Jaeger pilot called out of retirement and teamed with rookie pilot Mako Mori as part of a last-ditch effort to defeat the Kaiju.\n\nPrincipal photography began on November 14, 2011, in Toronto and lasted through April 2012. The film was produced by Legendary Pictures and distributed by Warner Bros. It was released on July 12, 2013, in 3D and IMAX 3D, receiving generally positive reviews; the visual effects, action sequences, and nostalgic style were highly praised. While it underperformed at the box office in the United States, it was highly successful in other markets. It earned a worldwide total of more than $411 million—$114 million in China alone, its largest market—becoming Del Toro's most commercially successful film to date. The film is considered as a homage to the Kaiju, Mecha, and Anime genres, and has gained a cult following.\n\nA controversial sequel titled \"Pacific Rim Uprising\", directed by Steven S. DeKnight and produced by Del Toro, with Kikuchi, Day, and Gorman reprising their roles, and Universal Pictures taking the film distribution, was released on March 23, 2018.\n\nOn November 8, 2018, Netflix announced an original anime series that will expand upon the story of the first two live action movies.\n\nIn 2013, an interdimensional portal called the \"Breach\" opens at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, from which giant monsters, the Kaiju, emerge. To combat the Kaiju threat, humanity builds massive robotic machines called Jaegers. Each Jaeger is piloted by two or more people, who are mentally linked in a process called \"Drifting\", to share the mental stress of piloting the machine.\n\nIn 2020, the Becket brothers, Raleigh and Yancy, pilots of \"Gipsy Danger\", are launched to defend Anchorage from Knifehead, a Category III Kaiju. Defying direct orders from command, they engage the monster rather than protect the coastline. Knifehead kills Yancy, and Raleigh barely manages to pilot the Jaeger on his own, killing the Kaiju before crashing it at a shoreline. Traumatized by Yancy's death, Raleigh quits the Jaeger program. Five years later, the increasing power and number of Kaiju attacks cause the world governments to cease funding the continuous construction of Jaegers in favor of building coastal walls, and Marshal Stacker Pentecost moves all four remaining Jaegers to the last Jaeger Shatterdome in Hong Kong and plans to end the Kaiju War by destroying the Breach with a nuclear weapon. As \"Striker Eureka\", piloted by Herc Hansen and his son Chuck, kills Mutavore, a Category IV Kaiju, in Sydney, demonstrating the ineffectiveness of the walls, Pentecost persuades Raleigh to rejoin the program and they arrive at Hong Kong and meet Mako Mori, director of the Jaeger restoration program. After finding her compatible, Raleigh and Mako try their first drift, but Mako ends up nearly destroying the Shatterdome while lost in the memory of a Category II Kaiju attacking Tokyo and killing her family, and is relieved of piloting duty. It is revealed that after this incident, Mako was saved and raised by Pentecost.\n\nPentecost consults Kaiju experts Newton Geiszler and Hermann Gottlieb to plan the assault on the Breach. Newton is able to drift with a piece of a Kaiju brain, discovering the Kaiju are scouts sent by invading beings from another dimension, and establishing a two-way mental link that enables the Kaiju hive mind to gain access to his knowledge just as he did theirs. Pentecost tasks Newton with finding a black market dealer and seller of body parts of dead Kaiju, Hannibal Chau, to find a fresh Kaiju brain. Suddenly, two Category IV Kaijus, Leatherback and Otachi, emerge and rampage through Hong Kong to kill Newton. After Otachi destroys \"Crimson Typhoon\" and Leatherback destroys \"Cherno Alpha\", \"Striker Eureka\" loses all power by Leatherback's EMP blast. \"Gipsy Danger\" is finally sent and slays both Kaiju. Newton and Chau find out that Otachi is pregnant, and the infant Kaiju dies shortly after swallowing Chau whole. Newton and Hermann drift with the infant's brain, discovering the Breach will only open in the presence of a Kaiju's DNA.\n\nAs Herc was injured during the previous fight, Pentecost, who is dying from radiation sickness from piloting a Jaeger with a nuclear core before the implementation of radiation shielding, gives a rallying speech and pilots \"Striker Eureka\" with Chuck. Along with \"Gipsy Danger\", they approach the Breach and are warned by Newton and Hermann of what they discovered from drifting with the infant's brain. Three Kaiju, two Category IV called Scunner and Raiju and a first Category V named Slattern, emerge from the Breach to defend it. After Raiju is killed, Pentecost and Chuck sacrifice themselves by detonating the bomb, which kills Scunner and mortally wounds Slattern. Raleigh and Mako kill Slattern and drag it to the Breach, where Mako is ejected and Raleigh successfully overloads the Jaeger's reactor, destroying and closing the Breach. As Raleigh and Mako's escape pods surface in the Pacific Ocean, Herc orders the war clock to be stopped, indicating mankind's victory and Raleigh and Mako embrace.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Chau is shown cutting his way out of the Kaiju infant, looking for his lost shoe.\n\n\nAdditional Jaeger pilots include Charles Luu, Lance Luu and Mark Luu as the Wei Tang triplets (China), and Robert Maillet and Heather Doerksen as Sasha and Aleksis Kaidanovsky (Russia). Joe Pingue portrays Captain Merrit, the captain of a fishing boat caught in a battle between Jaeger and Kaiju. Santiago Segura plays an aide to Hannibal Chau. Brad William Henke and Larry Joe Campbell portray members of an Alaskan construction team that Raleigh joins after retiring from the Pan Pacific Defense Corps. Robin Thomas, Julian Barnes, and David Richmond-Peck portray U.N. representatives from the United States, Great Britain, and Canada, respectively. Sebastian Pigott appears as a Jaeger engineer and Joshua Peace appears as an officer, Jonathan Foxon appears as a frantic civilian. David Fox plays an old man on a beach, while Jane Watson portrays Raleigh and Yancy's mother in a flashback sequence. Producer Thomas Tull makes a cameo appearance.\n\nIn the film, a Jaeger's neural load is too much for a single pilot to handle alone, meaning they must first be psychically linked to another pilot—a concept called \"drifting\". When pilots drift, they quickly gain intimate knowledge of each other's memories and feelings, and have no choice but to accept them; del Toro found this concept's dramatic potential compelling. The director expressed his intention that the empathy metaphors extend to real life:\n\nThe pilots' smaller stories actually make a bigger point, which is that we're all together in the same robot [in life]… Either we get along or we die. I didn't want this to be a recruitment ad or anything jingoistic. The idea of the movie is just for us to trust each other, to cross over barriers of color, sex, beliefs, whatever, and just stick together.\n\nDel Toro acknowledged this message's simplicity, but said he would have liked to have seen adventure films with similar morals when he was a child. The film's ten primary characters all have \"little arcs\" conducive to this idea; del Toro stated: \"I think that's a great message to give kids… 'That guy you were beating the shit out of ten minutes ago? That's the guy you have to work with five minutes later.' That's life… We can only be complete when we work together.\" The director noted that \"Hellboy\" and \"The Devil's Backbone\" told the same message, though the latter conveyed it in a very different way.\n\nThe film centers on the relationship between Becket and Mori, but is not a love story in a conventional sense. Both are deeply damaged human beings who have decided to suppress their respective traumas. While learning to pilot their Jaeger, they undergo a process of \"opening up\", gaining access to each other's thoughts, memories and secrets. Their relationship is necessarily one of respect and \"perfect trust\". Hunnam commented that the film is \"a love story without a love story. It's about all of the necessary elements of love without arriving at love itself\". Both Becket and Mori have suffered profound personal tragedies; one of the script's central ideas is that two damaged people can metaphorically \"become one\", with their figurative missing pieces connecting almost like a puzzle. Del Toro emphasized the characters' emotional intimacy by filming their training fight scene the way he would a sex scene.\n\nDel Toro, a self-described pacifist, avoided what he termed \"car commercial aesthetics\" or \"army recruitment video aesthetics\", and gave the characters Western ranks including \"marshal\" and \"ranger\" rather than military ranks such as \"captain\", \"major\" or \"general\". The director stated: \"I avoided making any kind of message that says war is good. We have enough firepower in the world.\" Del Toro wanted to break from the mass death and destruction featured in contemporary blockbuster films, and made a point of showing the streets and buildings being evacuated before Kaiju attacks, ensuring that the destruction depicted is \"completely remorseless\". The director stated:\n\nI don't want people being crushed. I want the joy that I used to get seeing Godzilla toss a tank without having to think there are guys in the tank… What I think is you could do nothing but echo the moment you're in. There is a global anxiety about how fragile the status quo is and the safety of citizens, but in my mind—honestly—this film is in another realm. There is no correlation to the real world. There is no fear of a copycat Kaiju attack because a Kaiju saw it on the news and said, \"I'm going to destroy Seattle.\" In my case, I'm picking up a tradition. One that started right after World War II and was a coping mechanism, in a way, for Japan to heal the wounds of that war. And it's integral for a Kaiju to rampage in the city.\n\nWriting for the \"Los Angeles Review of Books\", Wai Chee Dimock connected the film's central theme of \"togetherness\" to its recurring image of missing shoes, stating the \"utopian dream\" driving the characters is\n\nthat puny humans like us could be \"together\"—not only in the specific neural melding that must take place between the two Jaeger co-pilots but also, more generally speaking, in a fractal web of resemblance, filling the world with copies of ourselves at varying orders of magnitude and with varying degrees of re-expression, beginning with the shoes on our feet.\n\nIn February 2006, it was reported that Guillermo del Toro would direct Travis Beacham's fantasy screenplay, \"Killing on Carnival Row\", but the project never materialized. Beacham conceived \"Pacific Rim\" the following year. While walking on the beach near Santa Monica Pier, the screenwriter imagined a giant robot and a giant monster fighting to the death. \"They just sort of materialized out of the fog, these vast, godlike things.\" He later conceived the idea that each robot had two pilots, asking \"what happens when one of those people dies?\" Deciding this would be \"a story about loss, moving on after loss, and dealing with survivor's guilt\", Beacham commenced writing the film. On May 28, 2010, it was reported that Legendary Pictures had purchased Beacham's detailed 25-page film treatment, now titled \"Pacific Rim\".\n\nOn July 28, 2010, it was reported that del Toro would next direct an adaptation of H. P. Lovecraft's \"At the Mountains of Madness\" for Universal Studios, with James Cameron producing. When del Toro met with Legendary Pictures to discuss the possibility of collaborating with them on a film, he was intrigued by Beacham's treatment—still a \"very small pitch\" at this point. Del Toro struck a deal with Legendary: while directing \"At the Mountains of Madness\", he would produce and co-write \"Pacific Rim\"; because of the films' conflicting production schedules, he would direct \"Pacific Rim\" only if \"At the Mountains of Madness\" were cancelled. Tom Cruise was attached to star in the Lovecraft adaptation.\n\nOn March 7, 2011, it was reported that Universal would not proceed with \"At the Mountains of Madness\" because del Toro was unwilling to compromise on the $150 million budget and R rating. The director later reflected, \"When it happened, this has never happened to me, but I actually cried that weekend a lot. I don't want to sound like a puny soul, but I really was devastated. I was weeping for the movie.\" The project collapsed on a Friday, and del Toro signed to direct \"Pacific Rim\" the following Monday.\n\nDel Toro spent a year working with Beacham on the screenplay, and is credited as co-writer. He introduced ideas he had always wished to see in the genre, such as a Kaiju birth and a Kaiju attack seen from a child's perspective. The script also received an uncredited rewrite from Neil Cross, who previously created the Idris Elba-starring drama series \"Luther\" and wrote the del Toro-produced horror film \"Mama\". Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan were enlisted to perform uncredited rewrites when their spec script \"Monstropolis\" caught the filmmaker's attention. Drew Pearce also carried out uncredited work on the script.\n\nFilming began on November 14, 2011, and continued in Toronto into April 2012. Del Toro gave an update after the second week on filming finished. The film was referred to as \"Silent Seas\" and \"Still Seas\" during production.\n\nDel Toro had never shot a film in less than 115 days, but had only 103 to shoot \"Pacific Rim\". In order to achieve this, del Toro scheduled a splinter unit that he could direct early in the day, before main unit, and on his off-days. The director worked 17 to 18 hours a day, seven days a week, for much of the schedule. Del Toro took a new approach to directing actors, allowing \"looser\" movements and improvisation; the director maintained tight control over the production: \"Everything, 100% goes through me sooner or later. I do not delegate anything. Some people like it, some people don't, but it has to be done that way.\"\n\nThe film was shot using Red Epic cameras. At first Guillermo del Toro decided not to shoot or convert the film to 3D, as the effect would not work due to the sheer size of the film's robots and monsters, explaining\n\nI didn't want to make the movie 3D because when you have things that big… the thing that happens naturally, you're looking at two buildings lets say at 300 feet [away], if you move there is no parallax. They're so big that, in 3D, you barely notice anything no matter how fast you move… To force the 3D effects for robots and monsters that are supposed to be big you are making their [perspective] miniaturized, making them human scale.\n\nIt was later announced that the film would be converted to 3D, with the conversion taking 40 weeks longer than most. Del Toro said: \"What can I tell you? I changed my mind. I'm not running for office. I can do a Romney.\"\n\nDel Toro cut approximately an hour of material from the film. The unused footage explored the characters and their arcs in greater detail, but the director felt it was necessary to strike a balance, stating: \"We cannot pretend this is Ibsen with monsters and giant robots. I cannot pretend I'm doing a profound reflection on mankind.\" Each character's arc was edited down to its minimal requirements. The director wanted to keep the film around two hours, particularly for younger viewers. Alejandro González Iñárritu and Alfonso Cuarón helped with the editing; Iñárritu removed ten minutes of footage, while Cuarón removed \"a few minutes\" and rearranged several scenes. Iñárritu and Cuarón receive a \"special thanks\" in the film's end credits, as do James Cameron and David Cronenberg.\n\nDel Toro envisioned \"Pacific Rim\" as an earnest, colorful adventure story, with an \"incredibly airy and light feel\", in contrast to the \"super-brooding, super-dark, cynical summer movie\". The director focused on \"big, beautiful, sophisticated visuals\" and action that would satisfy an adult audience, but has stated his \"real hope\" is to introduce the Kaiju and mecha genres to a generation of children. While the film draws heavily on these genres, it avoids direct references to previous works. Del Toro intended to create something original but \"madly in love\" with its influences, instilled with \"epic beauty\" and \"operatic grandeur\". The end credits dedicate the film to Ray Harryhausen and Ishirō Honda, who helped to establish the giant monster genre with films such as \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\" and \"Godzilla\", respectively.\n\nThe film was to honor the Kaiju and mecha genres while creating an original stand-alone film, something \"conscious of the heritage, but not a pastiche or an homage or a greatest hits of everything\". The director made a point of starting from scratch, without emulating or referencing any previous examples of those genres. He cautioned his designers not to turn to films like \"Gamera\", \"Godzilla\", or \"The War of the Gargantuas\" for inspiration, stating: \"I didn't want to be postmodern, or referential, or just belong to a genre. I really wanted to create something new, something madly in love with those things. I tried to bring epic beauty to it, and drama and operatic grandeur.\" Rather than popular culture, he drew inspiration from works of art such as \"The Colossus\" and George Bellows's boxing paintings. The film's designers include Wayne Barlowe, Oscar Chichoni, monster sculptors David Meng and Simon Lee, and \"\" and \"The Hobbit\" designer Francisco Ruiz Velasco. Del Toro has acknowledged that some designs created for his cancelled \"At the Mountains of Madness\" adaptation may have been used in \"Pacific Rim\".\n\nApproximately one hundred Kaiju and one hundred Jaegers were designed, but only a fraction of these appear in the film; every week the filmmakers would \"do an \"American Idol\"\" and vote for the best. In designing Kaiju, the film's artists frequently drew inspiration from nature rather than other works. The director commented: \"Kaijus are essentially outlandish in a way, but on the other hand they come sort of in families: you've got the reptilian Kaiju, the insect Kaiju, the sort of crustacean Kaiju… So to take an outlandish design and then render it with an attention to real animal anatomy and detail is interesting.\" Del Toro avoided making the Kaiju too similar to any Earth creatures, instead opting to make them otherworldly and alien. Del Toro called the film's Kaiju \"weapons\", stating that they are \"the cleaning crew, the cats sent into the warehouse to clean out the mice.\" Certain design elements are shared by all the Kaiju; this is intended to suggest that they are connected and were designed for a similar purpose. Each Kaiju was given a vaguely humanoid silhouette to echo the man-in-suit aesthetic of early Japanese Kaiju films. While del Toro's other films feature ancient or damaged monsters, the Kaiju lack scars or any evidence of prior culture, indicating that they are engineered creations rather than the result of an evolutionary system.\n\nKnifehead, the first Kaiju to appear in the film, is a tribute to the plodding kaiju of 1960s Japanese films, and is intended to look almost like a man in a rubber suit; its head was inspired by that of a goblin shark. Leatherback, the bouncer-like Kaiju which spews electro-magnetic charges, is a favorite of del Toro, who conceived it as a \"brawler with this sort of beer belly\"; the lumbering movements of gorillas were used as a reference. The Kaiju Otachi homages the dragons of Chinese mythology. The director called it a \"Swiss army knife of a Kaiju\"; with almost 20 minutes of screen time, it was given numerous features so the audience would not tire of it. The creature moves like a Komodo dragon in water, sports multiple jaws and an acid-filled neck sack, and unfurls wings when necessary. It is also more intelligent than the other Kaiju, employing eagle-inspired strategies against the Jaegers. Onibaba, the Kaiju that orphans Mako Mori, resembles a fusion of a Japanese temple and a crustacean. Slattern, the largest Kaiju, is distinguished by its extremely long neck and \"half-horn, half-crown\" head, which del Toro considered both demonic and majestic.\n\n\"Gipsy Danger\", the American Jaeger, was based on the shape of New York City's Art Deco buildings, such as the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building, but infused with John Wayne's gunslinger gait and hip movements. \"Cherno Alpha\", the Russian Jaeger, was based on the shape and paint patterns of a T-series Russian tank, combined with a giant containment silo to give the appearance of a walking nuclear power plant with a cooling tower on its head. \"Crimson Typhoon\", the three-armed Chinese Jaeger, is piloted by triplets and resembles a \"medieval little warrior\"; its texture evokes Chinese lacquered wood with golden edges. \"Striker Eureka\", the Australian Jaeger, is likened by del Toro to a Land Rover; the most elegant and masculine Jaeger, it has a jutting chest, a camouflage paint scheme recalling the Australian outback, and the bravado of its pilots.\n\nThe film's costumes were designed by Shane Mahan and Kate Hawley, who spent several months on the costumes of the Jaeger pilots. The Russian pilot suits are old-fashioned and echo cosmonaut space suits.\n\nIndustrial Light & Magic was chosen to create the visual effects for \"Pacific Rim\". Del Toro hired Oscar winners John Knoll and Hal T. Hickel, both known for their work on the \"Star Wars\" prequel trilogy and the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" films. Legacy Effects co-owner Shane Mahan, known for creating the armored suits for \"Iron Man\", was tasked with building the suits, helmets and conn-pods. Oscar winner Clay Pinney, known for his work on \"Independence Day\" and \"Star Trek\", was also brought on board. Hybride Technologies, a division of Ubisoft, and Rodeo FX also contributed to the visual effects.\nDel Toro conceived the film as an \"operatic\" work:\n\nThat was one of the first words I said to the entire team at ILM. I said, \"This movie needs to be theatrical, operatic, romantic.\" We used a lot of words not usually associated with high-tech blockbusters … We went for a very, very, very, very saturated color palette for the battle for Hong Kong. I kept asking John to tap into his inner Mexican and be able to saturate the greens and the purples and the pinks and the oranges. The classic Japanese woodblock print \"The Great Wave off Kanagawa\" by Hokusai was a common motif in the ocean battles; Del Toro recalled, \"I would say 'Give me a Hokusai wave'… we use the waves and weather in the movie very operatically.\" The director asked that Knoll not necessarily match the lighting from shot to shot: \"It's pretty unorthodox to do that, but I think the results are really beautiful and very artistically free and powerful, not something you would associate with a big sci-fi action movie.\" Del Toro considers the film's digital water its most exciting visual effect: \"The water dynamics in this movie are technically beautiful, but also artistically incredibly expressive. We agreed on making the water become almost another character. We would time the water very precisely. I'd say 'Get out of the wave [on this frame].'\"\n\nThe film also features extensive miniature effect shots provided by 32TEN Studios, under the supervision of ILM VFX Producer Susan Greenhow and ILM VFX Supervisors John Knoll and Lindy DeQuattro. Shot using RED Epic cameras on 3D rigs, the scenes produced by 32TEN involved the creation of a quarter-scale office building interior which was destroyed by the fist of a Jaeger robot which was on a separate pneumatically controlled rig, as well as a sequence which depicted several rows of seats in a soccer stadium being blown apart as a Jaeger lands in the stadium, which was created by using quarter-scale seats blown apart by air cannons. Additionally 32TEN provided several practical elements for ILM’s compositing team including dust clouds, breaking glass and water effects.\n\nA single-player fighting video game based on the film was announced by the Australian Classification Board for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Published and developed by Yuke's, \"Pacific Rim: The Video Game\" was released along with the film on July 12, 2013. The game received generally negative reviews. Reliance Games developed a \"Pacific Rim\" tie-in game for smartphone platforms, such as iOS and Android devices; this version also received negative reviews.\n\nThe film's score was composed by Ramin Djawadi. Del Toro selected Djawadi based on his works on \"Prison Break\", \"Iron Man\", and \"Game of Thrones\", stating: \"His scores have a grandeur, but they have also an incredible sort of human soul.\" The director also stated that some Russian rap would be featured in the film. The soundtrack was released on digital download from Amazon on June 18, 2013, and CD on June 25, 2013. The physical version of the soundtrack was released on July 9, 2013, by WaterTower Music, three days before the theatrical release of the film itself. Guest musicians Tom Morello and Priscilla Ahn also feature as soloists on the score. Two songs appear in the film which are not included on the soundtrack are \"Just Like Your Tenderness\" by Luo Xiaoxuan, and the ending theme \"Drift\", performed by Blake Perlman featuring Rza. The OST received mostly positive reviews. \"The Action Elite\" rated the album with a perfect five stars, the \"Empire\" gave four, while MSN and \"Filmtracks\" also gave the soundtrack four out of five stars. On July 27, 2013, the soundtrack was appeared at peak position number 7 on \"US \"Billboard\" Top Soundtracks.\"\n\nOn November 28, 2012, the official film website premiered alongside two viral videos—one depicting the initial Kaiju attack as captured by a handheld camera. Blueprints depicting the designs for the Jaeger machines were also released online. On June 5, 2013, the graphic novel \"Pacific Rim: Tales from Year Zero\" was released. Written by Travis Beacham and featuring cover art by Alex Ross, \"Tales from Year Zero\" serves as an introductory prologue to the film, and is set twelve years before its events. On June 18, Insight Editions published \"Pacific Rim: Man, Machines, and Monsters\", an art book written by David S. Cohen. The book chronicles the film's production with concept art, photography, the cast and crew's accounts of the shoot, and a foreword by del Toro. On July 2, a viral video was released in which Ron Perlman's character, Hannibal Chau, advertises his fictional Kaiju organ dealership, Kaiju Remedies.\n\nOn the day of the film's release, July 12, 2013, another viral video was released to promote the film. It involved the collaboration of the film studio (including del Toro himself) and the YouTube network Polaris (also known as The Game Station). It featured members of the YouTube network (such as the \"Game Grumps\") as Jaeger pilots fighting Kaiju. On July 16, a novelization by Alex Irvine was released. NECA began selling action figures of the film's Kaiju and Jaegers.\n\n\"Pacific Rim\" was initially expected to reach theaters in July 2012. However, Warner Bros. decided to postpone the film's release date to May 10, 2013. In March 2012, it was announced that the film would be released on July 12, 2013. The film premiered in Mexico City on July 1, 2013.\n\n\"Pacific Rim\" grossed $101.8 million in North America, and has had a favorable international release, grossing $309.2 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $411,002,906.\n\nThe film grossed $3.6 million from Thursday night showings, 23 percent of which came from IMAX showings. It then faced competition from \"Grown Ups 2\" and ultimately fell behind it on opening day, earning $14.6 million. The film reached the #3 spot during the opening weekend with $37.2 million, behind \"Despicable Me 2\" and \"Grown Ups 2\". This is the highest-ever opening for a film by del Toro, surpassing \"\". Around 50 percent of tickets were in 3D, which makes it the second-highest 3D share of 2013, behind \"Gravity\". During its second weekend, the film dropped a steep 57% with a gross of $16 million, and during its third weekend, had dropped a further 52% with a gross of $7.7 million.\n\nOn July 22, 2013, it was reported that the film had reached #1 at the international box office over the weekend. The film had a successful opening in China, grossing $45.2 million, until overtaken by \"\" the largest opening in China for a Warner Bros. title, and the sixth-largest Chinese debut of all time for any Hollywood film. On August 19, 2013, its gross crossed $100 million in China alone, becoming the sixth-highest-grossing American film ever in China. It grossed a total of $114.3 million in the country, making China the largest market for the film. In Japan, the film landed in the fifth position on opening weekend, with an initial earning of $3 million (behind \"World War Z\"s gross of $3.4 million).\n\nIn September 2013, \"Forbes\" highlighted \"Pacific Rim\" as \"the rare English-language film in history to cross $400 million while barely crossing $100 million domestic\".\n\n\"Pacific Rim\" received generally positive reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Metacritic gives a rating of 65 out of 100 based on reviews from 48 critics, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\". The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 71% approval rating with an average rating of 6.6/10 based on 272 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"It may sport more style than substance, but \"Pacific Rim\" is a solid modern creature feature bolstered by fantastical imagery and an irresistible sense of fun.\"\n\n\"The Daily Telegraph\"s Robbie Collin awarded the film five stars out of five, likening the experience of watching it to rediscovering a favorite childhood cartoon. He praised del Toro for investing his own affection for the genre and sense of artistry into the project in such a way that the viewer found themselves immersed in the film rather than watching from afar, noting the director had catered to younger and older audiences alike and expressed surprise that the film could rise above the sum of its parts. Todd McCarthy of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" gave a positive review, describing the film as the sum of the potential every monster film had ever tried to fulfill. Lou Lumenick of \"The New York Post\" gave the film four stars out of four, and said it had \"no shortage of brains, brawn, eye candy, wit and even some poetry\", praising the \"clean and coherent\" action sequences and the \"terrific chemistry\" between Hunnam and Kikuchi. Drew McWeeny of HitFix highlighted other aspects of the film, paying particular attention to the production and art design. He also praised the cinematography for \"perfectly capturing\" the film, and described the score as \"ridiculously cool\". \"Rolling Stone\"s Peter Travers called the film \"the work of a humanist ready to banish cynicism for compassion\", saying that del Toro \"drives the action with a heartbeat\". Keith Uhlich of \"Time Out\" called the film \"pure, pleasurable comic-book absurdity\", and noted that del Toro had lent the proceedings a \"plausible humanity\" lacking in most of summer 2013's destruction-heavy blockbusters. He said the Kaijus' civilian victims make a \"palpably personal impression\", deeming one scene with Mako Mori \"as mythically moving as anything in the mecha anime, like \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\", that the director emulates with expert aplomb.\" \"The Village Voice\"s Stephanie Zacharek called it \"summer entertainment with a pulse\", praising its \"dumbly brilliant\" action and freedom from elitism, but noted the story is predictable and suggested del Toro's time would be better spent on more visionary films. Angela Watercutter of \"Wired\" called it the \"most awesome movie of the summer\", a \"fist-pumping, awe-inspiring ride\", and opined that its focus on spectacle rather than characterization \"simply does not matter\" in the summer blockbuster context. Richard Roeper gave the film a B, commenting that either the Jaegers or Kaiju \"can take down any of the Transformers.\" Leonard Maltin gave the film two-and-a-half out of four stars, calling it \"three-quarters of a really good movie that doesn't know when to quit.\"\n\n\"The Guardian\"s Andrew Pulver was less enthusiastic, calling the film a mix of \"wafer-thin psychodrama\" and \"plot-generator dialogue\". \"Time\"s Richard Corliss said the action was let down by \"inert\" drama, describing the film as \"45 minutes of awesome encased in 90 minutes of yawnsome.\" Justin Chang of \"Variety\" criticized it as loud and lacking the nuance and subtlety of del Toro's previous films. \"The New Yorker\"s Anthony Lane's verdict read as \"It is possible to applaud \"Pacific Rim\" for the efficacy of its business model while deploring the tale that has been engendered—long, loud, dark, and very wet. You might as well watch the birth of an elephant.\" The \"San Francisco Chronicle\"s Mike LaSalle reacted extremely negatively by stating \"If this is the best we can do in terms of movies—if something like this can speak to the soul of audiences—maybe we should just turn over the cameras and the equipment to the alien dinosaurs and see what they come up with… Director Guillermo del Toro, who gave us \"Pan's Labyrinth\" not too many years ago, used to be known as an artistic and discerning filmmaker, despite his affection for blockbuster action and grotesqueness. But too often he gets lost in his computer…Why go to the movies to look at somebody else's computer after looking at your own all week?… The actors can't make \"Pacific Rim\" any better. They can only relieve some of the pain.\" \"Slant Magazine\"s Ed Gonzalez, who said the film lacked poignancy, compared it to a video game: \"a stylish but programmatic ride toward an inevitable final boss battle\". \"The Wrap\"s Alonso Duralde criticized the choice to set most battles at night or during the rain, feeling it detracted from the action, and said the comic relief actors—Day, Gorman, and Perlman—stole the film from the less interesting leads. Jordan Hoffman of Film.com identified Hunnam as the weak link in the cast, calling him a \"charisma black hole\". Giles Hardie of \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" was particularly critical of the film, awarding the action sequences \"five IQ points out of five\" as he described the film as an hour and twenty minutes of fight sequences vaguely connected by ten minutes of story.\n\nDirector Rian Johnson praised the film, as did Japanese game director Hideo Kojima, who called it the \"ultimate otaku film\" and stated he \"never imagined [he] would be fortunate enough to see a film like this in [his] life\". Go Nagai, who pioneered the idea of mecha piloted from an interior cockpit, praised the film's fun and intense action, while game developer Fumito Ueda said its battle scenes surpassed memories of the tokusatsu films he saw as an impressionable child. Science fiction author William Gibson called the film \"A ravishing display of intelligent, often wonderfully witty visual design, every frame alive with coherent language, in the service of what is at heart a children's story… A baroque that doesn't curdle, that never fetishizes itself.\"\n\nThe inclusion of only one female character of note resulted in \"Pacific Rim\" not passing the Bechdel test. This became a topic of discussion in the media and on the Internet. Opinions were divided between those pointing to the film as an example of Hollywood's practice of ostracizing women, and those noting that the film did not sexually objectify Mako Mori and gave her a narrative arc not revolving around a man.\n\n\"Pacific Rim\" became available for download on the iTunes Store and Vudu on October 1, 2013. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in the US on October 15, 2013, and in the UK and other countries on November 25, 2013. A collector's edition was also available on the same date. To help promote the home media release, Bryan Harley and Roque Rodriguez of Fresno, California, produced a \"sweded\" version of the film's \"Gipsy Danger\" vs. Otachi battle scene, after del Toro was impressed by the duo's \"sweded\" trailer released on YouTube in March 2013. As of March 2014, Pacific Rim has sold 961,845 DVDs along with 1,427,692 Blu-ray Discs in the United States for $10,045,530 and $24,634,992 in revenue, respectively, for a total of $37,079,122. Pacific Rim was released on 4K UHD Blu-Ray on October 4 2016.\n\nA sequel titled \"Pacific Rim Uprising\" was released on March 23, 2018.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "55447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55447", "title": "Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith", "text": "Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith\n\nStar Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith is a 2005 American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas. It is the sixth entry of the \"Star Wars\" film series and stars Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, and Frank Oz. A sequel to \"\" (1999) and \"\" (2002), it is the third and final installment in the \"Star Wars\" prequel trilogy.\n\nThe film begins three years after the onset of the Clone Wars. The Jedi Knights are spread across the galaxy, leading a massive war against the Separatists. The Jedi Council dispatches Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to eliminate the notorious General Grievous, leader of the Separatist Army. Meanwhile, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker grows close to Palpatine, the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic and, unknown to the public, a Sith Lord known as Darth Sidious. Their deepening friendship threatens the Jedi Order, the Republic, and Anakin himself.\n\nLucas began writing the script before production of \"Attack of the Clones\" ended. Production of \"Revenge of the Sith\" started in September 2003, and filming took place in Australia with additional locations in Thailand, Switzerland, China, Italy and the United Kingdom. \"Revenge of the Sith\" premiered on May 15, 2005, at the Cannes Film Festival, then released worldwide on May 19, 2005. The film received generally favorable reviews from critics, especially in contrast to the mixed reviews of the previous two prequels: praise was directed towards its action sequences, mature themes, musical score, visual effects, and the performances of McGregor, McDiarmid, Oz, and Jimmy Smits; criticism was aimed at the film's screenplay, inconsistent tone, and Christensen's performance.\n\n\"Revenge of the Sith\" broke several box office records during its opening week and went on to earn over $848 million worldwide, making it, at the time, the third-highest-grossing film in the \"Star Wars\" franchise, unadjusted for inflation. It was the highest-grossing film in the U.S. in 2005 and the second-highest grossing film worldwide, behind \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\". The film also holds the record for the highest opening day gross on a Thursday, making $50 million.\n\nThree years after the Battle of Geonosis, the galaxy is in a state of civil war. During a space battle over Coruscant, Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker lead a mission to rescue the kidnapped Supreme Chancellor Palpatine from the cyborg Separatist commander, General Grievous. After infiltrating Grievous's flagship, the Jedi battle Count Dooku, whom Anakin eventually executes at Palpatine's urging. Grievous escapes the battle-torn cruiser, in which the Jedi crash-land on Coruscant. There, Anakin reunites with his wife, Padmé Amidala, who reveals that she is pregnant. While initially excited, Anakin begins to have prophetic visions of Padmé dying in childbirth, and his worry steadily grows.\n\nPalpatine appoints Anakin to the Jedi Council as his representative and informant, but the Council declines to grant Anakin the rank of Jedi Master and orders him to spy on Palpatine, causing Anakin's faith in the Jedi to diminish significantly. Palpatine tempts Anakin with secret knowledge of the dark side of the Force, including the \"power to save his loved ones from dying\". Meanwhile, Obi-Wan travels to Utapau, where he finds and kills Grievous, and Yoda travels to Kashyyyk to defend the planet from invasion. Palpatine eventually reveals to Anakin that he is the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious, saying that only he has the knowledge to save Padmé from dying. Torn between staying loyal to the Jedi and saving Padmé, Anakin reports Palpatine's treachery to Mace Windu, who confronts and subdues Palpatine, severely disfiguring him in the process. Fearing that he will lose Padmé, Anakin intervenes on Palpatine's behalf and severs Windu's hand, allowing Palpatine to throw him out of a window to his death using force lightning. Anakin pledges himself to Palpatine, who dubs him Darth Vader. Palpatine issues Order 66 for the clone troopers to kill the remaining Jedi, and dispatches Vader along with a band of clones to kill everyone in the Jedi Temple. Vader then massacres the remaining Separatist leaders hiding on the volcanic planet Mustafar, while Palpatine addresses the Galactic Senate, transforming the Republic into the Galactic Empire and declaring himself Emperor. Having survived the chaos, Obi-Wan and Yoda return to Coruscant and learn of Anakin's betrayal.\n\nUnable to convince Padmé about Anakin's turn to the dark side, Obi-Wan secretly stows aboard Padmé's ship when she travels to Mustafar, where she implores Anakin to abandon the dark side and run away with her. Upon witnessing Obi-Wan present, Vader chokes Padmé into unconsciousness in a fit of rage, thinking that she brought Obi-Wan to kill him. Obi-Wan engages Vader in a deadly lightsaber duel over a river of lava and ultimately defeats Vader, severing both of his legs and his remaining organic arm, and leaves him at the bank of a lava river where he is horribly burned. On Coruscant, Yoda battles Palpatine until their duel reaches a stalemate. Yoda then flees with Bail Organa while Palpatine, sensing that his apprentice is in danger, travels to Mustafar.\n\nOn the asteroid Polis Massa, Obi-Wan regroups with Yoda, and Padmé gives birth to a twin son and daughter, whom she names Luke and Leia before dying shortly after. On Mustafar, Palpatine finds a horribly burnt Vader still alive. After returning to Coruscant, Vader's mutilated body is treated and covered in a black armored suit. When Vader asks about his wife, Palpatine explains to Vader that he himself killed Padmé in his rage, devastating him and leaving him in pain. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan and Yoda conceal the twins from the Sith, as they are the galaxy's only hope for freedom. Yoda exiles himself to the planet Dagobah, while Vader and the Emperor oversee the construction of a huge space station. Bail Organa adopts Leia and takes her to Alderaan, while Obi-Wan delivers Luke to his step-family, Owen and Beru Lars on Tatooine, where Obi-Wan intends to watch over Luke until the time is right to challenge the Empire.\n\n\nJimmy Smits, Peter Mayhew, Oliver Ford Davies, Ahmed Best, Brian Blessed and Silas Carson reprise their roles as Senator Bail Organa, Chewbacca, Sio Bibble, Jar Jar Binks, Boss Nass, Nute Gunray and Ki-Adi-Mundi, respectively from the previous films. Joel Edgerton and Bonnie Piesse also reprise their roles as Owen Lars and Beru Lars, respectively from \"Attack of the Clones\". Sound engineer Matthew Wood provides the voice of General Grievous, the fearsome cyborg commander of the Separatists' droid army; Temuera Morrison portrays the Clone Troopers and Commander Cody, who are clones of the bounty hunter, Jango Fett; Bruce Spence portrays Tion Medon, local administrator of Utapau; Jeremy Bulloch, who played Boba Fett in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi\", appears as Captain Colton, the pilot of the Rebel Blockade Runner \"Tantive IV\", Genevieve O'Reilly portrayed Mon Mothma, though her scene was ultimately cut, but she would reprise her role in \"Rogue One\", the next feature film set after \"Revenge of the Sith\". Rohan Nichol portrays Captain Raymus Antilles.\n\nWayne Pygram appears as a younger Grand Moff Tarkin; and stunt coordinator Nick Gillard appears as a Jedi named Cin Drallig (his name spelled backward, without the k). Editor Roger Barton's son Aidan Barton portrays Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa as infants. James Earl Jones possibly provides the uncredited voice of Darth Vader; when specifically asked if he had supplied the voice—either newly or from a previous recording—Jones answered, \"You'd have to ask Lucas about that. I don't know\".\n\nDirector and \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas has a cameo as Baron Papanoida, a blue-faced alien in attendance at the Coruscant Opera House. Lucas' son Jett portrays a young Jedi-in-training named Zett Jukassa. Lucas' daughter Amanda appears as a character called Terr Taneel, seen in the security hologram; while his other daughter Katie plays a blue-skinned Pantoran named Chi Eekway, visible when Palpatine arrives at the Senate after being saved by the Jedi, and talking to Baron Papanoida at the Opera House (she also has a brief speaking role in one of the deleted scenes where Padmé is meeting in secret with other senators). Christian Simpson appeared as a stunt double for Hayden Christensen. When Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Palpatine arrive via shuttle to the Senate docks after crash landing on Coruscant.\n\nLucas stated that he conceived the \"Star Wars\" saga's story in the form of a plot outline in 1973. However, he later clarified that, at the time of the saga's conception, he had not fully realized the details—only major plot points. He began working on the screenplay for \"Episode III\" even before the previous film, \"\", was released, proposing to concept artists that the film would open with a montage of seven battles on seven planets. Michael Kaminski, in \"The Secret History of Star Wars\", surmises that Lucas found flaws with Anakin's fall to the dark side and radically re-organized the plot. For instance, instead of opening the film with various Clone Wars battles, Lucas decided instead to focus on Anakin, ending the film's first act with his killing of Count Dooku, an action that signals his descent to the dark side.\n\nA significant number of fans speculated online about the film's subtitle; rumored titles included \"Rise of the Empire\", \"The Creeping Fear\" (which was also named as the film's title on the official website on April Fool's 2004), and \"Birth of the Empire\". Eventually, \"Revenge of the Sith\" also became a title guessed by fans that George Lucas would indirectly confirm. The title is a reference to \"Revenge of the Jedi\", the original title of \"Return of the Jedi\"; Lucas changed the title scant weeks before the premiere of \"Return of the Jedi\", declaring that Jedi do not seek revenge.\n\nSince Lucas refocused the film on Anakin, he had to sacrifice certain extraneous plot points relating to \"Attack of the Clones\". Lucas had previously promised fans that he would explain the mystery behind the erasure of the planet Kamino from the Jedi Archives. However, Lucas abandoned this plot thread in order to devote more time to Anakin's story, leaving the matter unresolved on film. As a compromise, Lucas permitted author James Luceno to explain the mystery of Kamino's erasure and the origins of the Clone army in his expanded universe novel \"Labyrinth of Evil\".\n\nLucas had originally planned to include even more ties to the original trilogy, and wrote early drafts of the script in which a 10-year-old Han Solo appeared on Kashyyyk, but the role was not cast or shot. He also wrote a scene in which Palpatine reveals to Anakin that he created him from midichlorians, and is thus his \"father\", a clear parallel to Vader's revelation to Luke in \"The Empire Strikes Back\", but Lucas ejected this scene as well. Another planned scene by Lucas that was written during the early development of the film was a conversation between Master Yoda and the ghostly Qui Gon-Jinn, with Liam Neeson reprising his role as Jinn (he also hinted his possible appearance in the film). However, the scene was never filmed and Neeson was never recorded, although the scene was present in the film's novelization. Also, Neeson finally reprised the role in an episode of \"\" in 2011.\n\nAfter principal photography was complete in 2003, Lucas made even more changes in Anakin's character, sharpening Anakin's motivations for turning to the dark side. Lucas accomplished this \"rewrite\" through editing the principal footage and filming new scenes during pick-ups in London in 2004. In the previous versions, Anakin had myriad reasons for turning to the dark side, one of which was his sincere belief that the Jedi were plotting to take over the Republic. Although this is still intact in the finished film, by revising and refilming many scenes, Lucas emphasized Anakin's desire to save Padmé from death. Thus, in the version that made it to theatres, Anakin falls to the dark side primarily to save Padmé.\n\nAfter the screenplay's earliest draft was submitted, the art department began designing the various ways that each element could appear on screen.\n\nFor the Kashyyyk environment, the art department turned to \"The Star Wars Holiday Special\" for inspiration. Over a period of months, Lucas would approve hundreds of designs that would eventually appear in the film. He would later rewrite entire scenes and action sequences to correspond to certain designs he had chosen. The designs were then shipped to the pre-visualization department to create moving CGI versions known as animatics. Ben Burtt would edit these scenes with Lucas in order to previsualize what the film would look like before the scenes were filmed. The pre-visualization footage featured a basic raw CGI environment with equally unprocessed character models performing a scene, typically for action sequences. Steven Spielberg was brought in as a \"guest director\" to make suggestions to the art designers for the Mustafar duel, and oversee the pre-visualization of an unused version of the Utapau chase scene. Later, the pre-visualization and art department designs were sent to the production department to begin \"bringing the film out of the concept phase\" by building sets, props and costumes. To determine the required sets, Lucas analyzed each scene with the staff to see which moments the actors would come in most contact with the set, warranting it to be constructed.\n\nAlthough the first scene filmed was the final scene to appear in the film (shot during the filming of \"Attack of the Clones\" in 2000), principal photography on the film occurred from June 30, 2003 to September 17, 2003, with additional photography occurring at Shepperton Studios and Elstree Studios in London from August 2004 to January 31, 2005. The initial filming took place on soundstages at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, although practical environments were shot as background footage later to be composited into the film. These included the limestone mountains depicting Kashyyyk, which were filmed in Phuket, Thailand (they were later damaged by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami). The production company was also fortunate enough to be shooting at the same time that Mount Etna erupted in Italy. Camera crews were sent to the location to shoot several angles of the volcano that were later spliced into the background of the animatics and the final film version of the planet Mustafar.\n\nWhile shooting key dramatic scenes, Lucas would often use an \"A camera\" and \"B camera\", or the \"V technique\", a process that involves shooting with two or more cameras at the same time in order to gain several angles of the same performance. Using the HD technology developed for the film, the filmmakers were able to send footage to the editors the same day it was shot, a process that would require a full 24 hours had it been shot on film. Footage featuring the planet Mustafar was given to editor Roger Barton, who was on location in Sydney, Australia cutting the climactic duel. All other footage was forwarded to lead editor Ben Burtt at Skywalker Ranch in California.\n\nHayden Christensen says Lucas asked him \"to bulk up and physically show the maturity that had taken place between the two films.\" The actor says he worked out with a trainer in Sydney for three months and ate \"six meals a day and on every protein, weight gain supplement that man has created\" to go from 160lbs. to 185lbs.\n\nChristensen and Ewan McGregor began rehearsing their climactic lightsaber duel long before Lucas would shoot it. They trained extensively with stunt coordinator Nick Gillard to memorize and perform their duel together. As in the previous prequel film, McGregor and Christensen performed their own lightsaber fighting scenes without the use of stunt doubles. The speed at which Vader and Obi-Wan engage in their duel is mostly the speed at which it was filmed, although there are instances where single frames were removed to increase the velocity of particular strikes. An example of this occurs as Obi-Wan strikes down on Vader after applying an armlock in the duel's first half.\n\n\"Revenge of the Sith\" eventually became the first \"Star Wars\" film in which Anakin Skywalker and the suited Darth Vader were played by the same actor in the same film. As Christensen recounted, it was originally intended to simply have a \"tall guy\" in the Darth Vader costume, but after \"begging and pleading\" Christensen persuaded Lucas to have the Vader costume used in the film created specifically to fit him. The new costume featured shoe lifts and a muscle suit. It also required Christensen (who is tall) to look through the helmet's mouthpiece.\n\nIn 2004, Gary Oldman was originally approached to provide the voice of General Grievous; however, complications arose during contract negotiations after Oldman learned the film was to be made outside of the Screen Actors Guild, of which he is a member. He backed out of the role rather than violate the union's rules. Matthew Wood, who voiced Grievous, disputed this story at Celebration III, held in Indianapolis. According to him, Oldman is a friend of producer Rick McCallum, and thus recorded an audition as a favor to him, but was not chosen. Wood, who was also the supervising sound editor, was in charge of the auditions and submitted his audition anonymously in the midst of 30 others, under the initials \"A.S.\" for Alan Smithee. Days later, he received a phone call asking for the full name to the initials \"A.S.\"\n\nThe post-production department began work during filming and continued until weeks before the film was released in 2005. Special effects were created using almost all formats, including model work, CGI and practical effects. The same department later composited all such work into the filmed scenes—both processes taking nearly two years to complete. \"Revenge of the Sith\" has 2,151 shots that use special effects, a world record.\n\nAs the DVD featurette \"Within a Minute\" illustrates, the film required 910 artists and 70,441 man-hours to create 49 seconds of footage for the Mustafar duel alone. Members of Hyperspace, the Official Star Wars Fan Club, received a special look into the production. Benefits included not only special articles, but they also received access to a webcam that transmitted a new image every 20 seconds during the time it was operating in Fox Studios Australia. Many times the stars, and Lucas himself, were spotted on the webcam.\n\nDuring the process of shaping the film for its theatrical release, Lucas and his editors dropped many scenes, and even an entire subplot, from the completed film.\n\nLucas excised all the scenes of a group of Senators, including Padmé, Bail Organa, and Mon Mothma (Genevieve O'Reilly), organising an alliance to prevent the Chancellor from receiving any more emergency powers. Though this is essentially the Rebel Alliance's birth, the scenes were discarded to achieve more focus on Anakin's story. The scene where Yoda arrives on Dagobah to begin his self-imposed exile was also cut, but is featured in a deleted scene in the DVD release, although McCallum stated he hopes Lucas may add it to the release if Lucas releases a six-episode DVD box set.\n\nMany scenes concerning Jedi deaths during the execution of Order 66 were cut. The deaths of Barriss Offee and Luminara Unduli were either cut from the film or not filmed in the first place.\n\nBai Ling filmed minor scenes for the film playing a senator, but her role was cut during editing. She claimed this was because she posed for the June 2005 issue of \"Playboy\", whose appearance on newsstands coincided with the film's May release. Lucas denied this, stating that the cut had been made more than a year earlier, and that he had cut his own daughter's scenes as well.\n\nThe music was composed and conducted by John Williams (who has composed and conducted the score for every episode in the \"Star Wars\" saga), and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and London Voices. The film's soundtrack was released by Sony Classical on May 3, 2005, more than two weeks before the film's release. A music video titled \"A Hero Falls\" was created for the film's theme, \"Battle of the Heroes\", featuring footage from the film and was also available on the DVD.\n\nThe soundtrack also came with a collectors' DVD, \"\", at no additional cost. The DVD, hosted by McDiarmid, features 16 music videos set to remastered selections of music from all six film scores, set chronologically through the saga. This album was chosen as one of Amazon.com's Top 100 Editors' Picks of 2005 (#83).\n\n\"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith\" charity premieres took place in Seattle, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington D.C., Boston, Denver, Atlanta, San Francisco, and Miami on Thursday, May 12, 2005; and on May 13, 2005, there were two additional charity premiere screenings in George Lucas's hometown of Modesto.The official premiere was at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival (out of competition) on May 16. Its theatrical release in most other countries took place on May 19 to coincide with the 1999 release of \"\" (the 1977 release of \"A New Hope\" and the 1983 release of \"Return of the Jedi\" were also released on the same day and month, six years apart). The global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas claimed one week before the premiere that it may have cost the U.S. economy approximately US$627 million in lost productivity because of employees who took a day off or reported in sick. Grauman's Chinese Theatre, a traditional venue for the \"Star Wars\" films, did not show it. However, a line of people stood there for more than a month hoping to convince someone to change this. Most of them took advantage of an offer to see the film at a nearby cinema, ArcLight Cinemas (formerly the \"Cinerama Dome\"). On May 16, the Empire Cinema in London's Leicester Square hosted a day-long Star Wars marathon showing of all six films; an army of Imperial stormtroopers \"guarded\" the area, and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra gave a free concert of \"Star Wars\" music.\n\nA copy of the film leaked onto peer-to-peer file sharing networks just hours after opening in theaters. The film was a time-stamped workprint, suggesting it may have come from within the industry rather than from someone who videotaped an advance screening. Eight people were later charged with copyright infringement and distributing material illegally. Documents filed by the Los Angeles District Attorney allege that a copy of the film was taken from an unnamed Californian post-production office by an employee, who later pleaded guilty to his charges. The illegal copy was passed among seven people until reaching an eighth party, who also pleaded guilty to uploading to an unnamed P2P network.\n\nShortly after the above-mentioned print was leaked, it was released in Shanghai as a bootleg DVD with Chinese subtitles. The unknown producer of this DVD also chose to include English subtitles, which were in fact translated back into English from the Chinese translation, rather than using the original English script. This resulted in the subtitles being heavily mis-translated, often causing unintentional humor. For example, in the opening crawl the title is mis-translated as \"Star War: The Third Gathers - The Backstroke of the West\". One error that recurs several times in the subtitles is that the phrase \"it seems\" (好象) was rendered as \"good elephant\". \"Jedi Council\" is rendered as \"Presbyterian Church\", and the mis-translation also caused the word \"fuck\" to replace \"work\" four times in the subtitles. Darth Vader's cry of \"Noooooooo!\" (不要) is rendered as \"Do not want\". This last translation error would later be popularized as an internet meme. In 2016, YouTube user GratefulDeadpool uploaded a fan edit of \"Revenge of the Sith\" in which the cast's voices were dubbed to match the bootleg subtitles.\n\n\"Revenge of the Sith\" is the first \"Star Wars\" film to receive a PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), officially for \"sci-fi violence and some intense images\", namely for the scene in which Darth Vader is set aflame by lava and molten rock. Lucas had stated months before the MPAA's decision that he felt the film should receive a PG-13 rating, because of Anakin's final moments and the film's content being the darkest and most intense of all six films. Some critics, including Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper, later responded that children would be able to handle the film as long as they had parental guidance, hence a \"PG rating\". All previously released films in the series were rated PG. The PG-13 rating had not existed when the films in the original trilogy were released; however, the original trilogy's films were later re-submitted to the MPAA due to changes in the re-released versions and once again received PG ratings. When \"Revenge of the Sith\" was released in Canada, it was given a PG rating in most provinces, excluding Quebec, where it was rated G. In the United Kingdom it received a 12A rating by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC). In Australia, the film was rated M for mature audiences by the Australian Classification Board (ACB).\n\nThe film was released on DVD and VHS on October 31, 2005 in the UK and Ireland, on November 1, 2005 in the United States and Canada on DVD and on November 3, 2005 in Australia. It was also released in most major territories on or near the same day. The DVD was a two-disc set, with picture and sound mastered from the original digital source material.\n\nThe DVD included a number of documentaries including a new full-length documentary as well as two featurettes, one which explores the prophecy of Anakin Skywalker as the Chosen One, the other looking at the film's stunts and a of web-documentaries from the official web site. Like the other DVD releases, included is an audio commentary track featuring Lucas, producer Rick McCallum, animation director Rob Coleman, and ILM visual effects supervisors John Knoll and Roger Guyett. were included with introductions from Lucas and McCallum. An Xbox game demo for \"\" along with a trailer for the \"\" PC game was featured on the second disc.\n\nAlso, a special two-pack exclusive, sold only at Wal-Mart stores, included another bonus DVD, \"The Story of Star Wars\".\n\nThis release is notable because, due to marketing issues, it was the first \"Star Wars\" film never to be released on VHS in the United States. However, the film was released on VHS in Australia, the U.K. and other countries in the world.\n\nThe DVD was re-released in a prequel trilogy box set on November 4, 2008.\n\nThe \"Star Wars\" films were released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on Blu-ray Disc on September 16, 2011 in three different editions.\n\nOn April 7, 2015, Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century Fox, and Lucasfilm jointly announced the digital releases of the six released \"Star Wars\" films. Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released \"Revenge of the Sith\" through the iTunes Store, Amazon Video, Vudu, Google Play, and Disney Movies Anywhere on April 10, 2015.\n\nOn September 28, 2010, it was announced that all six films in the series were to be stereo-converted to 3D. The films would be re-released in chronological order beginning with \"The Phantom Menace\" on February 10, 2012. \"Revenge of the Sith\" was originally scheduled to be re-released in 3D on October 11, 2013 (later pushed up to October 4, 2013). However, on January 28, 2013, Lucasfilm announced that it was postponing the 3D release of episodes \"II\" and \"III\" in order to \"focus 100 percent of our efforts on \"\"\" and that further information about 3D release plans would be issued at a later date. The premiere of the 3D version was shown on April 17, 2015, at Star Wars Celebration Anaheim.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 79% based on 288 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"With \"Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\", George Lucas brings his second \"Star Wars\" trilogy to a suitably thrilling and often poignant – if still a bit uneven – conclusion.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 68 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average \"A–\" grade on an A+ to F scale.\n\nMost critics have considered the film to be the best of the prequel trilogy, with a few even calling it the best of the entire \"Star Wars\" saga. A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" concluded that it was \"the best of the four episodes Mr. Lucas has directed\", and equal to \"The Empire Strikes Back\" as \"the richest and most challenging movie in the cycle\". In a 2007 summary of the on Rotten Tomatoes, \"Revenge of the Sith\" was placed 51 out of 100, making it the only \"Star Wars\" prequel film to earn a rank on that list. Jonathan Rosenbaum, a critic who disliked \"A New Hope\" and \"The Empire Strikes Back\", gave the film a positive review, saying that it had a \"relatively thoughtful story\". Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, writing \"If [Lucas] got bogged down in solemnity and theory in \"Episode II: Attack of the Clones\", the Force is in a jollier mood this time, and \"Revenge of the Sith\" is a great entertainment.\"\n\nIn 2012, \"Glittering Images\" art critic Camille Paglia praised the film, comparing some of its scenes to works by modern painters and calling it \"the greatest work of art in recent memory\". Paglia explained that the film's finale \n\nThough many critics and fans viewed \"Revenge of the Sith\" as the strongest of the three prequels, some viewers thought it was more or less on par with \"The Phantom Menace\" and \"Attack of the Clones\". Much of the criticism for the film was directed towards the dialogue, particularly the film's romantic scenes, and for Christensen's performance (which won him his second Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor). Critics and fans criticised lines such as \"Hold me, Ani. Hold me, like you did by the lake on Naboo...where there was nothing but our love...\". Critics have claimed this demonstrated Lucas's weakness as a writer of dialogue, a subject with which Lucas openly agreed when receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute.\n\nSome American conservatives criticized the film, claiming it has a liberal bias and is a commentary on the George W. Bush administration and the Iraq War. Some websites went so far as to propose a boycott of the film. Lucas defended the film, stating that the film's storyline was written during the Vietnam War and was influenced by that conflict rather than the war in Iraq. Lucas did say, however, that \"The parallels between Vietnam and what we're doing in Iraq now are unbelievable\".\n\nThe film was released in 115 countries. Its worldwide gross eventually reached $849 million—making it the second most financially successful film of 2005, behind \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\". The film earned an estimated $16.91 million from 2,900 midnight screenings in North America upon its release. In total, it earned a record $50 million on its opening day. It was surpassed the following year by \"\", which earned $55.5 million on its opening day.\n\nWith only the May 19 earnings, the film broke four box office records: midnight screenings gross (previously held by \"\", $8 million), opening day gross (\"Spider-Man 2\", with $40.4 million), single day gross (\"Shrek 2\" with $44.8 million) and Thursday gross (\"The Matrix Reloaded\" with $37.5 million). Its single day and opening day gross records were later surpassed by \"\" on July 7, 2006, when that movie grossed $55.5 million on its opening day, and its midnight screening gross was broken by \"The Dark Knight\" on July 18, 2008 with $18.5 million. It still retains its record for Thursday gross, however.\n\nAccording to box office analysis sites, the film set American records for highest gross in a given number of days for each of its first 12 days of release except for the seventh and eighth, where the record is narrowly held by \"Spider-Man 2\". On its fifth day, it became the highest-grossing film of 2005, surpassing \"Hitch\" ($177.6 million). The film earned $158.5 million in its first four-day period, surpassing the previous four-day record held by \"The Matrix Reloaded\" ($134.3 million), and joining \"Spider-Man\", \"The Matrix Reloaded\" and \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" as one the only films to make $100 million in three days. In eight days, it reached the $200 million mark (a record tied with \"Spider-Man 2\") and by its 17th day, the film had passed $300 million (surpassing the record of 18 days of \"Shrek 2\"). It was eventually the third-fastest film (after \"Shrek 2\" and \"Spider-Man\") to reach $350 million.\n\nThe film ended its run in American theaters on October 20, 2005, finishing with a total gross of $380,270,577. It ranks 29th in all-time domestic grosses and is the highest-grossing U.S. of 2005, outgrossing second-place \"\" by nearly $90 million. The film sold an estimated 59,324,600 tickets in the US.\n\nInternational grosses that exceeded $460 million include those Australia ($27.2 million), France and Algeria ($56.9 million), Germany ($47.3 million), Italy ($11.3 million), Japan ($82.7 million), Mexico ($15.3 million), South Korea ($10.3 million), Spain ($23.8 million), and the United Kingdom and Ireland ($72.8 million).\n\nFollowing the release of \"Revenge of the Sith\"—the completion of the original and prequel \"Star Wars\" series—on June 9, 2005, George Lucas was presented with the 33rd American Film Institute Lifetime Achievement Award. The institute honored his \"astonishing contributions to the art and technology of filmmaking, as well as the impact of the epic Star Wars series\".\n\nDespite being the prequel trilogy's best reviewed and received film, it received fewer award nominations than the previous films. It became the only \"Star Wars\" film not to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects; however, it was nominated for Best Makeup (Dave Elsey and Nikki Gooley), losing to \"\". It also won \"Favorite Motion Picture\" and \"Favorite Dramatic Motion Picture\" awards at the People's Choice Awards, \"Hollywood Movie of the Year\" award at the Hollywood Film Festival, Empire Awards (Sci-Fi/Fantasy Film), and the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie - Action. It also was nominated for Best Score Soundtrack Album at the 48th Grammy Awards in 2006.\n\nAs did every film of the original trilogy, the film won the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film. Williams also won Best Music. The film was nominated for ten Saturn Awards overall, including Best Director and Best Writing for Lucas, Best Actor for Christensen, Best Actress for Natalie Portman and Best Supporting Actor for Ian McDiarmid.\n\nThe film did, however, receive the fewest Golden Raspberry Awards nominations: only one, for Christensen as Worst Supporting Actor, which he won. (\"The Phantom Menace\" and \"Attack of the Clones\" received seven nominations each, with one and two wins, respectively.) It is the only \"Star Wars\" prequel not to receive a Razzie nomination for \"Worst Picture\". Christensen further won the \"Best Villain\" award at the MTV Movie Awards.\n\nThroughout \"Revenge of the Sith\", Lucas refers to a wide range of films and other sources, drawing on political, military, and mythological motifs to enhance his story's impact. Perhaps the most media coverage was given to a particular exchange between Anakin and Obi-Wan, which led to the aforementioned controversy: \"If you're not with me, then you're my enemy\", Anakin declares. Despite Lucas' insistence to the contrary, \"The Seattle Times\" concluded, \"Without naming Bush or the Patriot Act, it's all unmistakable no matter what your own politics may be.\"\n\nMcDiarmid, Lucas, and others have also called Anakin's journey to the dark side Faustian in the sense of making a \"pact with the devil\" for short-term gain, with the fiery volcano planet Mustafar representing hell. Midway through the film, Lucas intercuts between Anakin and Padmé by themselves, thinking about one another in the Jedi Temple and their apartment, respectively, during sunset. The sequence is without dialogue and complemented by a moody, synthesized soundtrack. Lucas' coverage of the exterior cityscapes, skylines and interior isolation in the so-called \"Ruminations\" sequence is similar to the cinematography and \"mise-en-scène\" of \"Rosemary's Baby\", a film in which a husband makes a literal pact with the devil.\n\nAs with the previous film and its allusions to \"The Empire Strikes Back\", some deliberately placed references have been made to draw allusions with \"Return of the Jedi\" (Episode VI). The title is similar in style to Episode VI's planned \"Revenge of the Jedi\". Some dialogue is mirrored in both films especially the line \"I can feel your anger!\" spoken by Palpatine, who also orders his personal entourage/bodyguards to \"Leave us\" at important moments in both films. Both films feature lightsaber duels before Palpatine with similar imagery and dialog; Palpatine's tacit encouragement of Anakin's hate and anger is analogous to Darth Vader attempts to play on Luke's fear of loss by taunting him with threats against Leia. In Vader's earlier identity as Anakin, his own fear of the loss of Padmé is what draws him to the dark side. Prior to settling on the Ewoks as the main helpers, the Wookiee race was originally planned to be in \"Return of the Jedi\". Anakin's decision to save Palpatine over Master Windu parallels the decision he would eventually make as Darth Vader to save Luke from Palpatine in \"Return of the Jedi.\"\n\nThe film's novelization was written by Matthew Stover. It includes much more dialogue than the film, including: a conversation between Count Dooku and Darth Sidious, where the reader learns Palpatine lied to Dooku about what the Empire would truly be; a conversation between Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi where Obi-Wan expresses self-doubt about whether he is the right Jedi to battle General Grievous; and a conversation between Anakin and Palpatine in which Palpatine promises to give Anakin anything he wants—whether it be a new speeder or the star system Corellia. The novel includes many minor details. For example, during the Battle of Coruscant, Anakin's callsign is Red 5, a reference to Luke's callsign in the climactic battle of \"A New Hope\", and one of the Republic capital ships is commanded by Lieutenant Commander Lorth Needa, who becomes Captain Needa in \"The Empire Strikes Back\". There are also references to the \"\" comic book series, such as the Battle of Jabiim (Volume 3). In addition to this, the siege of the Jedi Temple is much more violent and far more graphically explained than the cinematic version.\n\nSome unseen or unheard-of elements of the story were fleshed out in the course of the novel. Such examples include more discussions between Anakin and Palpatine, in which Palpatine explicitly says that Darth Plagueis was his master; in the film, it is merely hinted at. Additionally, it is revealed that the primary reason for Anakin's outrage over not becoming a Jedi Master is that only Masters have access to the holocrons in the Temple Archives, which is where Anakin had hoped to find information about how to prevent Padmé's death. Not only is Saesee Tiin revealed to be a telepath, but his horn, lost in the Clone Wars, is revealed to have grown back. The book explains that Palpatine purposely manipulated the Council into sending Obi-Wan to fight General Grievous, because he knew he needed to get Obi-Wan off Coruscant before he could turn Anakin to the dark side. The novel also reveals Mace Windu's rationale for not bringing Anakin along to the fight with Palpatine: he can sense Anakin's fear and distress, and does not believe the young Jedi is in any mental state to fight a Sith Lord. These are a few examples of many descriptions of characters' feelings and inner narrative. There are even some humorous lines added in, including extra dialogue in the battle between Grievous and Obi Wan - Grievous says, \"I was trained by Count Dooku,\" and Obi-Wan replies, \"What a coincidence; I trained the man who killed him.\"\n\nAn official prequel novel, \"Labyrinth of Evil\" () by James Luceno, was published in 2005. It is set near the end of the Clone Wars and directly before the events of \"Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith\".\n\nA video game based on the film was released on May 5, 2005, two weeks before the film. The game followed the film's storyline for the most part, integrating scenes from the film. However, many sections of the game featured scenes cut from the film, or entirely new scenes for the game. The style of the game was mostly lightsaber combat and fighting as Obi-Wan or Anakin. It also has a form of multiplayer mode, which includes both \"VS\" and \"Cooperative\" mode. In the first mode, two players fight with characters of their choice against each other in a lightsaber duel to the death. In the latter mode, two players team up to combat increasingly difficult waves of enemies.\n\n\nFootnotes\nCitations\n\n"}

It aired in its entirety on October 1, 2012, on AMC's official website, two weeks before the premiere of the third season of the show. The web series follows the story of a young man named Chase as he seeks shelter in a storage facility commanded by a malicious employee named B.J. This web series marks a second installment, following \"\", which aired a year earlier.\n\nChase (Josh Stewart) is portrayed as a survivor seeking refuge on a rooftop near Atlanta, Georgia. Despite his intention to reunite with his sister (who is referenced to be in a separate caravan), Chase and companion Harris (Chris Nelson) decide to investigate a nearby storage facility. The two are quickly swarmed by walkers and Harris is killed in the attack, but Chase manages to escape, unharmed, to one of the storage units. It is revealed that the storage units are under the sole command of a former employee named B.J., who is initially hostile to Chase. B.J. changes his mind after Chase offers to restore a damaged basement generator in exchange for one of B.J's box trucks. Chase takes some clothes from a storage unit which also contains family photo albums indicating it belonged to Rick Grimes. \n\nAfter a nonchalant B.J. fails to mention the presence of walkers in the basement, Chase's suspicions are raised. Chase's suspicions are confirmed when B.J. shows Chase a pile of dead bodies and mercilessly fires a shot at Chase, who collapses into the pile of bodies, apparently dead. \n\nChase survives the shooting with only a graze to his temple and returns to the compound to take revenge. He inadvertently finds Kelly (a female employee B.J. claimed had called in sick the day \"shit hit the fan\"), who explains that B.J. murdered the other employees and forced her into sexual slavery. B.J., realizing the situation, confronts Kelly and her liberator, refusing to let Chase leave with her. The events of this standoff culminate in B.J.'s decapitation (presumably by Kelly) while the two survivors escape the compound in a box truck (implied to be low on gas).

Ponce was a member of the male dance troupe \"Sólo Para Mujeres\" (\"For Women Only\") and appeared in a number of soap operas (\"telenovelas\") which were popular in both Mexico and the United States.\n\nOn 5 May 2005, while filming a commercial with his troupe in Mexico City, an overtaking car slammed into his motorcycle caravan, sending Ponce flying into the air and injuring three other actors. Ponce was rushed to the hospital but died early the next morning. Police charged the driver with involuntary homicide and detected alcohol on his breath, but believed he did not intend to kill Ponce. Ponce's co-star Poncho de Nigris accused the man of trying to hit them, stating, \"the car didn't hit the brakes or anything\".\n\nOther controversies ensued due to the troupe riding on the central section of Mexico City ring road \"(Periférico)\" in violation of a local traffic bylaw requiring motorcycles to use the side lanes, as well as the actions of the producer, Sergio Mayer. Mayer was filming without permission and failed to ask for police assistance; authorities warned he could be charged with a crime.\n\n\n"}
