It was distributed by Mar Vista Entertainment. The film received a wide release on June 20, 2017.\n\nBree (Nora-Jane Noone), decides to go for a swim at the Ketea Aquatic Center. The pool manager, McGradey (played by Tobin Bell), later hangs signs around the pool mentioning that the pool is closing up for the holiday. Bree is later joined by her sister, Johanna (Alexandra Park) in the pool and connect over a competition in college.\n\nMeanwhile, the janitor of the aquatic center, Clara (Diane Farr) is caught by McGradey attempting to steal from the lost and found. She is later laid off and is told to clean up before leaving.\n\nMcGradey then eagerly tells all swimmers to leave as they prepare to close. Bree and Johanna reluctantly do so. While packing up, Bree realizes that her engagement ring is missing, after attempting to show Johanna. Johanna sees the ring stuck in the metal grate at the bottom of the pool and both dive in to retrieve it.\n\nThe manager thinks everyone has left the pool and decides to close up, failing to notice the girls in the deep end of the pool. He engages the pool cover and leaves for the day with the two girls trapped inside the pool.\n\nThe girls are terrified and unsuccessfully attempt to escape. Shortly afterward, Johanna reveals that she is secretly jealous of Bree's successful lifestyle and recent engagement and that she pulled the ring from Bree's bag and threw it in the pool. Bree is initially angry with her sister but her anger is short-lived. Bree also talks about her past with her abusive alcoholic and drug addicted father. She also opens up about the fire which led to his death. Bree reveals that she is diabetic and requires a shot, or there is a possibility that she might slip into a diabetic coma.\n\nThe janitor, preparing to leave, is surprised to see the two girls trapped underneath the pool cover. Leading the girls to believe she is going to help them, she picks up Bree's bag, taking her cash, smartphone and credit card. The janitor then proceeds to blackmail her for the password to her phone and her credit card pin number. She later turns the water heater off. The girls have no choice but to wait out the night. Johanna talks about the deep mental damage from her abusive father with Bree saying, \"Just keep reminding yourself that he's dead.\"\n\nThe janitor comes back in the morning teasing the girls again. Johanna, angry at her, leads the janitor to place her ear onto the small hole in the pool cover, subsequently stabbing her in the ear with a sharp shard of tile. The janitor then turns on the automatic pool cleaning system, causing the girls to begin suffocating in chlorine. After a few minutes, she turns this off, realising the danger in her action. \n\nWhen the janitor leaves again, Johanna apologises to Bree for her jealousy and keeps blaming herself for the situation they're in. Bree comforts her and forgives her for her wrongdoings. Bree reveals that during the accident which killed their father, she actually prevented her dad from escaping and in fact, helped kill her father.\n\nThe janitor comes back, realising the error of her ways. She decides to open up the pool cover to let the girls out but the pass code she was given by the manager no longer works, leaving the girls to remain trapped. She tells the girls they're on their own and leaves.\n\nBree soon grows very weak and cold, passing in and out of consciousness. After initially refusing Bree's offer to try, Johanna spends her last bits of energy trying to rip off the metal grill on the bottom of the pool, something her sister failed to do. After succeeding, Johanna smashes the fiberglass of the pool cover, allowing them to escape. She then pulled Bree, unconscious, out of the pool and gives her the insulin shot, unsure whether she will survive. The janitor appears in front of them with a gun. She threatens to kill the girls after thinking about what might happen if they didn't die in the pool, not wanting to go to prison again. The janitor instead feels sympathetic for the girls and puts the gun down and gives them their belongings back. Johanna, after calling the police, tells her to leave.\n\nParamedics arrive at the aquatic center and tend to Bree. Johanna gives her her engagement ring back, which the janitor blackmailed Bree for with the intention of pawning it. Bree asked how she got it back to which Johanna replies, \"I killed the monster\", referring back to what Bree said about killing their father.\n\n\n\"12 Feet Deep\" received generally positive reviews from critics, JoBlo.com called it a \"well crafted-entertaining thriller,\" and gave it 8/10 stars. That Moment In gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars and said it was \"well-directed and engrossing... less a shocker than an intense human drama.\"\n\n\n"}

Since Sega is the original copyright holder and wasn't interested in assuming the production of a sequel, Treasure had to license the intellectual property from Sega in order to carry out the game themselves.\n\n\"Advance Guardian Heroes\" is a side-scrolling beat 'em up in which the playable characters can perform physical and magic attacks. Physical moves include countering and mid-air dashes. Magic attacks, which drain the MP meter, include element spells and protective barriers. It's also possible to go into \"Hyper Mode\", a faster, more powerful version of the playable character.\n\nThe game is separated in various stages and sub-stages with their own boss-fights, enemies, and puzzles. Gameplay modes include \"Story\" for up to two players, \"Versus\" and \"Training\".\n\nUnlike its predecessor, Advance Guardian Heroes allows players to move smoothly towards and away from the screen, as opposed to switching between 3 planes. Some platforming elements have been added to break up the combat, and two new jumping manoeuvres, the air-dash and the homing jump, have been implemented. Some sequences in which these moves are used seem to be references to various 8-bit and arcade games, and some wire-fu films.\n\nA large part of the game relies on a revised \"barrier spell.\" All playable characters (and enemies on higher difficulty settings) have the barrier spell available, and at the cost of magic-over-time, it renders a character invincible. Properly timed use of the barrier spell allows a player to reflect projectiles and magic (in a visual effect reminiscent of Mischief Makers' Marina Liteyears throwing a laser or lightning bolt back at its source), or stun enemies who attack in melee.\n\nA green gauge is used to represent the character's (and speculatively, the player's) anger. At any point that the player's character is rendered immobile or out of the player's control, the player can rapidly press buttons to increase the anger gauge. Points allocated to the character's MOB[ility] grant bonuses to how quickly this gauge increases. When it flashes, the character can press A+B simultaneously to activate \"Hyper Mode\" or \"Anger Mode,\" starting a timer in which the anger gauge decreases, the magic gauge increases, the character is given a burst of speed, and the player is returned control of his character.\n\nIf the player's character dies during the course of the game, a sinister figure appears and offers to give the character invincibility in exchange for his soul. If the player refuses, the princess appears and reassures the player that there will be another chance, before the game transitions to a game over screen. If the player agrees to the sinister figure's conditions, then the character is brought back to life in a state referred to as, \"Devil Mode\" that is unable to take damage (although still able to be knocked down and flung around) for the next 6 minutes, before the sinister figure reappears and destroys him, resulting in a game over screen. Regardless of the player's choice, he is able to continue the game from the last checkpoint reached before going into \"Devil Mode.\"\n\nAlso, unlike the first game, the player is allowed to use most every character that he unlocks, in the main story as well as in the other modes.\n\nThroughout the game, defeated enemies will drop crystals of varying sizes and colour, that act as the experience points. Between stages, players can allocate these crystals towards one or more of their character's attributes: Vitality, Mind, Attack, Defence, Magical Attack, Magical Defence, and Mobility. At certain points, you will have to fight the heroes of the previous game, and upon defeating them, they will give you their souls, which will increase one of your attributes by 10. Increasing an attribute with soul crystals will raise the character's level, no matter how high that attribute was to begin with. The higher the character's level, the more soul crystals will be needed to reach the next level, so players have to allocate their points carefully. Anything left over after allocation, can be donated towards unlocking further playable characters.\n\nThe story follows the events of \"Guardian Heroes\". After the Undead Hero was returned to his rest, the heroes were given the option of becoming the Sky Spirit's perfect warriors. The group was divided, with Nicole, Serena, and Valgar joining the Sky Spirit, and Han and Genjiro refusing. Randy escaped back to earth on his own, leaving Han and Genjiro to fight a losing battle against their former comrades.\n\nYears later, Zur returns. He resurrects Kanon and uses the power of the Guardian Heroes to take over the world. The few remaining resistance forces call upon the power of the Undead Hero once again, with one young soldier giving up his body to serve as its vessel.\n\nThroughout the game, the character fights the previous heroes and earns their power. Ultimately, it is revealed this is another attempt by the heavens to create the ultimate warrior. In the final battle against the ruler of the heavens, all heroes gather to defeat it and subsequently leave for the Other World.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews in English-speaking countries according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. While most critics praised the visuals and the gameplay, they criticized the story and the game suffering from frame rate problems.\n"}

The exterior is generally strong enough that one could pound a nail into a block of wood using the bottle as a hammer; however, even a small scratch on the interior would cause it to crumble.\n\nIt is created by heating a glass bottle and then rapidly cooling the outside whilst slowly cooling the inside. This causes external compression and internal tension such that even a scratch on the inside is sufficient to shatter the bottle.\n\nThe effect is utilized in several magic effects, including the \"Devil's Flask\".\n\nTo create the desired effect, the bottles are rapidly cooled on the outside and slow cooled on the inside during the glass-making process. This causes the outside to be extremely hard, and the inside to be soft and susceptible to damage which can release the powerful internal stresses. The glass is not annealed. Reheating the glass and then allowing it to cool slowly will remove the unique properties from the glass.\n\nBecause of the seemingly paradoxical nature of the glass (being both extremely durable and extremely fragile), Bologna bottles are often used as props in magic tricks, where the bottle can be shattered by rattling a small object inside it.\n\nMentioned in the publication of the Royal Society around 1740s, the Bologna bottle is named for where it was first discovered in Bologna, Italy. During this period, a glassblower would create a Bologna bottle by leaving the bottle in the open air instead of immediately placing the bottle back into the furnace to cool (annealing). This produced a special phenomenon, where the bottle would remain intact even when dropped from a distance onto the brick floor, but would immediately rupture if a small piece of flint were placed inside.\n\nAlthough the bottle can resist a strong external force, the extremely fragile flaws inside the bottle prevent it from being used in practical applications.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "274927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=274927", "title": "Clave (rhythm)", "text": "Clave (rhythm)\n\nThe clave (; ) is a rhythmic pattern used as a tool for temporal organization in Afro-Cuban music. It is present in a variety of genres such as Abakuá music, rumba, conga, son, mambo, salsa, songo, timba and Afro-Cuban jazz. The five-stroke clave pattern represents the structural core of many Afro-Cuban rhythms.\n\nThe clave pattern originated in sub-Saharan African music traditions, where it serves essentially the same function as it does in Cuba. In ethnomusicology, clave is also known as a \"key pattern\", \"guide pattern\", \"phrasing referent\", \"timeline\", or \"asymmetrical timeline\". The clave pattern is also found in the African diaspora musics of Haitian Vodou drumming, Afro-Brazilian music, African American music which is known as Hambone and also found in Louisiana Voodoo drumming as well as Afro-Uruguayan music (candombe). The clave pattern (or hambone, as it is known in the United States) is used in North American popular music as a rhythmic motif or simply a form of rhythmic decoration.\n\"Clave\" is a Spanish word meaning 'code,' 'key,' as in key to a mystery or puzzle, or 'keystone,' the wedge-shaped stone in the center of an arch that ties the other stones together. Clave is also the name of the patterns played on claves; two hardwood sticks used in Afro-Cuban music ensembles—Peñalosa (2009).\n\nJust as a keystone holds an arch in place, the clave pattern holds the rhythm together in Afro-Cuban music. The two main clave patterns used in Afro-Cuban music are known in North America as \"son clave\" and the \"rumba clave\". Both are used as bell patterns across much of Africa. Son and rumba clave can be played in either a triple-pulse ( or ) or duple-pulse (, or ) structure. The contemporary Cuban practice is to write the duple-pulse clave in a single measure of . It is also written in a single measure in ethnomusicological writings about African music.\n\nAlthough they subdivide the beats differently, the and versions of each clave share the same pulse names. The correlation between the triple-pulse and duple-pulse forms of clave, as well as other patterns, is an important dynamic of sub-Saharan-based rhythm. Every triple-pulse pattern has its duple-pulse correlative.\n\nSon clave has strokes on: 1, 1a, 2&, 3&, 4.\n\nRumba clave has strokes on: 1, 1a, 2a, 3&, 4.\n\nBoth clave patterns are used in rumba. What we now call \"son clave\" (also known as \"Havana clave\") used to be the key pattern played in Havana-style yambú and guaguancó. Some Havana-based rumba groups still use \"son clave\" for yambú. The musical genre known as \"son\" probably adopted the clave pattern from rumba when it migrated from eastern Cuba to Havana at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, African music and European music sensibilities were blended together in original Cuban hybrids. Cuban popular music became the conduit through which sub-Saharan rhythmic elements were first codified within the context of European ('Western') music theory. The first written music rhythmically based on clave was the Cuban danzón, which premiered in 1879. The contemporary concept of clave with its accompanying terminology reached its full development in Cuban popular music during the 1940s. Its application has since spread to folkloric music as well. In a sense, the Cubans standardized their myriad rhythms, both folkloric and popular, by relating nearly all of them to the clave pattern. The veiled code of African rhythm was brought to light due to clave’s omnipresence. Consequently, the term \"clave\" has come to mean both the five-stroke pattern and the total matrix it exemplifies. In other words, the rhythmic matrix is the \"clave matrix\". Clave is the key that unlocks the enigma; it de-codes the rhythmic puzzle. It’s commonly understood that the actual clave pattern does not need to be played in order for the music to be 'in clave'—Peñalosa (2009).\n\nOne of the most difficult applications of the clave is in the realm of composition and arrangement of Cuban and Cuban-based dance music. Regardless of the instrumentation, the music for all of the instruments of the ensemble must be written with a very keen and conscious rhythmic relationship to the clave . . . Any ‘breaks’ and/or ‘stops’ in the arrangements must also be ‘in clave’. If these procedures are not properly taken into consideration, then the music is 'out of clave' which, if not done intentionally, is considered an error. When the rhythm and music are ‘in clave,’ a great natural ‘swing’ is produced, regardless of the tempo. All musicians who write and/or interpret Cuban-based music must be ‘clave conscious,’ not just the percussionists—Santos (1986).\n\nThere are three main branches of what could be called \"clave theory\".\n\nFirst is the set of concepts and related terminology, which were created and developed in Cuban popular music from the mid-19th to the mid-20th centuries. In \"Popular Cuban Music\", Emilio Grenet defines in general terms how the duple-pulse clave pattern guides all members of the music ensemble. An important Cuban contribution to this branch of music theory is the concept of the clave as a musical period, which has two rhythmically opposing halves. The first half is antecedent and moving, and the second half is consequent and grounded.\n\nThe second branch comes from the ethnomusicological studies of sub-Saharan African rhythm. In 1959, Arthur Morris Jones published his landmark work \"Studies in African Music\", in which he identified the triple-pulse clave as the guide pattern for many musics from ethnic groups across Africa. An important contribution of ethnomusicology to clave theory is the understanding that the clave matrix is generated by cross-rhythm.\n\nThe third branch comes from the United States. An important North American contribution to clave theory is the worldwide propagation of the 3–2/2–3 concept and terminology, which arose from the fusion of Cuban rhythms with jazz in New York City.\n\nOnly in the last couple of decades have the three branches of clave theory begun to reconcile their shared and conflicting concepts. Thanks to the popularity of Cuban-based music and the vast amount of educational material available on the subject, many musicians today have a basic understanding of clave. Contemporary books that deal with clave, share a certain fundamental understanding on what \"clave\" means.\n\nChris Washburne considers the term to refer to the rules that govern the rhythms played with the claves. Bertram Lehman regards the clave as a concept with wide-ranging theoretical syntactic implications for African music in general, and for David Peñalosa, the \"clave matrix\" is a comprehensive system for organizing music—Toussaint (2013).\n\nIn addition to these three branches of theory, clave has in recent years been thoroughly analyzed mathematically. The structure of clave can be understood in terms of cross-rhythmic ratios, above all, three-against-two (3:2). Godfried Toussaint, a Research Professor of Computer Science, has published a book and several papers on the mathematical analysis of clave and related African bell patterns. Toussaint uses geometry and the Euclidean algorithm as a means of exploring the significance of clave.\n\nThe most common clave pattern used in Cuban popular music is called the \"son clave\", named after the Cuban musical genre of the same name. Clave is the basic period, composed of two rhythmically opposed cells, one antecedent and the other consequent. Clave was initially written in two measures of in Cuban music. When written this way, each cell or clave half is represented within a single measure.\n\nThe antecedent half has three strokes and is called the \"three-side\" of clave. The consequent half (second measure above) of clave has two strokes and is called the \"two-side\".\nGoing only slightly into the rhythmic structure of our music we find that all its melodic design is constructed on a rhythmic pattern of two measures, as though both were only one, the first is antecedent, strong, and the second is consequent, weak—Grenet (1939).\n\n[With] clave... the two measures are not at odds, but rather, they are balanced opposites like positive and negative, expansive and contractive or the poles of a magnet. As the pattern is repeated, an alternation from one polarity to the other takes place creating pulse and rhythmic drive. Were the pattern to be suddenly reversed, the rhythm would be destroyed as in a reversing of one magnet within a series... the patterns are held in place according to both the internal relationships between the drums and their relationship with clave... Should the drums fall out of clave (and in contemporary practice they sometimes do) the internal momentum of the rhythm will be dissipated and perhaps even broken—Amira and Cornelius (1992).\n\nIn Cuban popular music, the first three strokes of son clave are also known collectively as \"tresillo\", a Spanish word meaning triplet i.e. three equal beats in the same time as two main beats. However, in the vernacular of Cuban popular music, the term refers to the figure shown here.\n\nThe other main clave pattern is the \"rumba clave\". Rumba clave is the key pattern used in Cuban rumba. Use of the triple-pulse form of rumba clave in Cuba can be traced back to the iron bell (\"ekón\") part in abakuá music. The form of rumba known as \"columbia\" is culturally and musically connected with abakuá which is an Afro Cuban cabildo that descends from the Kalabari of Cameroon. Columbia also uses this pattern. Sometimes rumba clave is clapped in the accompaniment of Cuban batá drums. The form of rumba clave is used in yambú, guaguancó and popular music.\n\nThere is some debate as to how the rumba clave should be notated for guaguancó and yambú. In actual practice, the third stroke on the three-side and the first stroke on the two-side often fall in rhythmic positions that do not fit neatly into music notation. Triple-pulse strokes can be substituted for duple-pulse strokes. Also, the clave strokes are sometimes displaced in such a way that they don't fall within either a triple-pulse or duple-pulse \"grid\". Therefore, many variations are possible.\n\nThe first regular use of rumba clave in Cuban popular music began with the\" mozambique\", created by Pello el Afrokan in the early 1960s. When used in popular music (such as songo, timba or Latin jazz) rumba clave can be perceived in either a 3–2 or 2–3 sequence.\n\nThe seven-stroke \"standard bell pattern\" contains the strokes of both clave patterns. Some North American musicians call this pattern \"clave\". Other North American musicians refer to the triple-pulse form as the \" bell\" because they write the pattern in two measures of .\n\nLike clave, the standard pattern is expressed in both triple and duple-pulse. The standard pattern has strokes on:\n1, 1a, 2& 2a, 3&, 4, 4a.\n\nThe ethnomusicologist A.M. Jones observes that what we call \"son clave, rumba clave\", and the \"standard pattern\" are the most commonly used key patterns (also called \"bell patterns, timeline patterns\" and \"guide patterns\") in Sub-Saharan African music traditions and he considers all three to be basically \"one and the same pattern\". Clearly, they are all expressions of the same rhythmic principles. The three key patterns are found within a large geographic belt extending from Mali in northwest Africa to Mozambique in southeast Africa.\n\nIn Afro-Cuban folkloric genres the triple-pulse ( or ) rumba clave is the archetypal form of the guide pattern. Even when the drums are playing in duple-pulse (), as in guaguancó, the clave is often played with displaced strokes that are closer to triple-pulse than duple-pulse. John Santos states: \"The proper feel of this [rumba clave] rhythm, is actually closer to triple [pulse].”\n\nConversely, in salsa and Latin jazz, especially as played in North America, is the basic framework and is considered something of a novelty and in some cases, an enigma. The cross-rhythmic structure (multiple beat schemes) is frequently misunderstood to be metrically ambiguous. North American musicians often refer to Afro-Cuban rhythm as a \"feel\", a term usually reserved for those aspects of musical nuance not practically suited for analysis. As used by North American musicians, \" clave\" can refer to one of three types of triple-pulse key patterns.\n\nWhen one hears triple-pulse rhythms in Latin jazz the percussion is most often replicating the Afro-Cuban rhythm bembé. The standard bell is the key pattern used in bembé and so with compositions based on triple-pulse rhythms, it is the seven-stroke bell, rather than the five-stroke clave that is the most familiar to jazz musicians. Consequently, some North American musicians refer to the triple-pulse standard pattern as \" clave\".\n\nSome refer to the triple-pulse form of rumba clave as \" clave\". When rumba clave is written in the four underlying main beats are counted: 1, 2, 1, 2.\n\nClaves... are not usually played in Afro-Cuban feels... [and] the clave [pattern] is not traditionally played in though it may be helpful to do so to relate the clave to the bell pattern—Thress (1994).The main exceptions are: the form of rumba known as Columbia, and some performances of abakuá by rumba groups, where the rumba clave pattern is played on claves.\n\nTriple-pulse son clave is the least common form of clave used in Cuban music. It is however, found across an enormously vast area of sub-Saharan Africa. The first published example (1920) of this pattern identified it as a hand-clap part accompanying a song from Mozambique.\n\nBecause clave-based music is generated from cross-rhythm, it is possible to count or feel the clave in several different ways. The ethnomusicologist Arthur Morris Jones correctly identified the importance of this key pattern, but he mistook its accents as indicators of meter rather than the counter-metric phenomena they actually are. Similarly, while Anthony King identified the triple-pulse \"son clave\" as \"the ‘standard pattern’ in its simplest and most basic form\", he did not correctly identify its metric structure. King represented the pattern in a polymetric time signature.\n\nIt wasn't until African musicologists like C.K. Ladzekpo entered into the discussion in the 1970s and 80s that the metric structure of sub-Saharan rhythm was unambiguously defined. The writings of Victor Kofi Agawu and David Locke must also be mentioned in this regard.\n\nIn the diagram below (son) clave is shown on top and a beat cycle is shown below it. Any or all of these structures may be the emphasis at a given point in a piece of music using the \" clave\".\n\nThe example on the left () represents the correct count and ground of the \" clave\". The four dotted quarter-notes across the two bottom measures are the main beats. All clave patterns are built upon four main beats. The bottom measures on the other two examples ( and ) show cross-beats. Observing the dancer’s steps almost always reveals the main beats of the music. Because the main beats are usually emphasized in the steps and not the music, it is often difficult for an \"outsider\" to feel the proper metric structure without seeing the dance component. Kubik states: \"In order to understand the motional structure of any music in Africa, one has to look at the dancers as well and see how they relate to the instrumental background\" (2010: 78).\n\nIn Cuban popular music, a chord progression can begin on either side of clave. When the progression begins on the three-side, the song or song section is said to be in 3–2 clave. When the chord progression begins on the two-side, it is in 2–3 clave. In North America, salsa and Latin jazz charts commonly represent clave in two measures of cut-time (); this is most likely the influence of jazz conventions. When clave is written in two measures (right), changing from one clave sequence to the other is a matter of reversing the order of the measures.\n\nA guajeo is a typical Cuban ostinato melody, most often consisting of arpeggiated chords in syncopated patterns. Guajeos are a seamless blend of European harmonic and African rhythmic structures. Most guajeos have a binary structure that expresses clave.\n\nKevin Moore states: \"There are two common ways that the three-side is expressed in Cuban popular music. The first to come into regular use, which David Peñalosa calls 'clave motif,' is based on the decorated version of the three-side of the clave rhythm.\" The following guajeo example is based on a clave motif. The three-side (first measure) consists of the tresillo variant known as cinquillo.\n\nSince this chord progression begins on the three-side, the song or song section is said to be in 3–2 clave.\n\nMoore: \"By the 1940s [there was] a trend toward the use of what Peñalosa calls the 'offbeat/onbeat motif.' Today, the offbeat/onbeat motif method is much more common.\" With this type of guajeo motif, the three-side of clave is expressed with all offbeats. The following I–IV–V–IV progression is in a 3–2 clave sequence. It begins with an offbeat pick-up on the pulse immediately before beat 1. With some guajeos, offbeats at the end of the two-side, or onbeats at the end of the three-side serve as pick-ups leading into the next measure (when clave is written in two measures).\n\nA chord progression can begin on either side of clave. One can therefore be on either the three-side or the two-side because the harmonic progression, rather than the rhythmic progression, is the primary referent. The following guajeo is based on the clave motif in a 2–3 sequence. The cinquillo rhythm is now in the second measure.\n\nThis guajeo is in 2–3 clave because it begins on the downbeat, emphasizing the onbeat quality of the two-side. The figure has the same harmonic sequence as the earlier offbeat/onbeat example, but rhythmically, the attack-point sequence of the two measures is reversed. Most salsa is in 2–3 clave, and most salsa piano guajeos are based on the 2–3 onbeat/offbeat motif.\n\nThe 3–2/2–3 concept and terminology was developed in New York City during the 1940s by Cuban-born Mario Bauza while he was the music director of Machito and his Afro-Cubans. Bauzá was a master at moving the song from one side of clave to the other.\n\nThe following melodic excerpt is taken from the opening verses of \"Que vengan los rumberos\" by Machito and his Afro-Cubans. Notice that the melody goes from one side of clave to the other and then back again. A measure of moves the chord progression from the two-side (2–3), to the three-side (3–2). Later, another measure of moves the start of the chord progression back to two-side (2–3).\n\nAccording to David Peñalosa:\n\nTito Puente learned the concept from Bauzá. Tito Puente's \"Philadelphia Mambo\" is an example of a song that moves from one side of clave to the other. The technique eventually became a staple of composing and arranging in salsa and Latin jazz. According to Kevin Moore:\n\nCuban folkloric musicians do not use the 3–2/2–3 system. Many Cuban performers of popular music do not use it either. The great Cuban conga player and band leader Mongo Santamaría said, \"Don’t tell me about 3–2 or 2–3! In Cuba we just play. We feel it, we don’t talk about such things.\" In another book, Santamaría said, \"In Cuba we don’t think about [clave]. We know that we’re in clave. Because we know that we have to be in clave to be a musician.\" According to Cuban pianist Sonny Bravo, the late Charlie Palmieri would insist that, \"There’s no such thing as 3–2 or 2–3, there’s only one clave!\" The contemporary Cuban bassist, composer and arranger Alain Pérez flatly states: \"In Cuba we do not use that 2–3, 3–2 formula... 2–3, 3–2 [is] not used in Cuba. That is how people learn Cuban music outside Cuba.\"\n\nPerhaps the greatest testament to the musical vitality of the clave is the spirited debate it engenders, both in terms of musical usage and historical origins. This section presents examples from non-Cuban music, which some musicians (not all) hold to be representative of clave. The most common claims, those of Brazilian and subsets of American popular music, are described below.\n\n\"Clave\" is a Spanish word and its musical usage as a pattern played on claves was developed in the western part of Cuba, particularly the cities of Matanzas and Havana. Some writings have claimed that the clave patterns originated in Cuba. One frequently repeated theory is that the triple-pulse African bell patterns morphed into duple-pulse forms as a result of the influence of European musical sensibilities. \"The duple meter feel [of rumba clave] may have been the result of the influence of marching bands and other Spanish styles...\"— Washburne (1995).\n\nHowever, the duple-pulse forms have existed in sub-Saharan Africa for centuries. The patterns the Cubans call \"clave\" are two of the most common bell parts used in Sub-Saharan African music traditions. Natalie Curtis, A.M. Jones, Anthony King and John Collins document the triple-pulse forms of what we call “son clave” and “rumba clave” in West, Central and East Africa. Francis Kofi and C.K. Ladzekpo document several Ghanaian rhythms that use the triple or duple-pulse forms of \"son clave\". Royal Harington identifies the duple-pulse form of \"rumba clave\" as a bell pattern used by the Yoruba and Ibo of Nigeria, West Africa. There are many recordings of traditional African music where one can hear the five-stroke \"clave\" used as a bell pattern.\n\nCuban music has been popular in sub-Saharan Africa since the mid twentieth century. To the Africans, clave-based Cuban popular music sounded both familiar and exotic. Congolese bands started doing Cuban covers and singing the lyrics phonetically. Soon, they were creating their own original Cuban-like compositions, with lyrics sung in French or Lingala, a lingua franca of the western Congo region. The Congolese called this new music \"rumba\", although it was really based on the son. The Africans adapted guajeos to electric guitars, and gave them their own regional flavor. The guitar-based music gradually spread out from the Congo, increasingly taking on local sensibilities. This process eventually resulted in the establishment of several different distinct regional genres, such as soukous.\n\nThe following soukous bass line is an embellishment of clave.\n\nBanning Eyre distills down the Congolese guitar style to this skeletal figure, where clave is sounded by the bass notes (notated with downward stems).\n\nHighlife was the most popular genre in Ghana and Nigeria during the 1960s. This arpeggiated highlife guitar part is essentially a guajeo. The rhythmic pattern is known in Cuba as \"baqueteo\". The pattern of attack-points is nearly identical to the 3–2 \"clave motif\" guajeo shown earlier in this article. The bell pattern known in Cuba as \"clave\", is indigenous to Ghana and Nigeria, and is used in highlife.\n\nThe following afrobeat guitar part is a variant of the 2–3 \"onbeat/offbeat motif\". Even the melodic contour is guajeo-based. 2–3 clave is shown above the guitar for reference only. The clave pattern is not ordinarily played in afrobeat.\n\nThere is some debate as to whether or not clave, as it appears in Cuban music, functions in the same way as its sister rhythms in other forms of music (Brazilian, North American and African). Certain forms of Cuban music demand a strict relationship between the clave and other musical parts, even across genres. This same structural relationship between the guide-pattern and the rest of the ensemble is easily observed in many sub-Saharan rhythms, as well as rhythms from Haiti and Brazil. However, the 3–2/2–3 concept and terminology is limited to certain types of Cuban-based popular musics and is not used in the music of Africa, Haiti, Brazil or in Afro-Cuban folkloric music. In American pop music the clave pattern tends to be used as an element of rhythmic color, rather than a guide-pattern and as such is superimposed over many types of rhythms.\n\nBoth Cuba and Brazil imported Yoruba, Fon and Congolese slaves. Therefore, it is not surprising that we find the bell pattern the Cubans call \"clave\" in the Afro-Brazilian musics of Macumba and Maculelê (dance). \"Son clave\" and \"rumba clave\" are also used as a tamborim part in some batucada arrangements. The structure of Afro-Brazilian bell patterns can be understood in terms of the \"clave concept\" (see below). Although a few contemporary Brazilian musicians have adopted the 3–2/2–3 terminology, it is traditionally not a part of the Brazilian rhythmic concept.\n\nBell pattern 1 is used in maculelê (dance) and some Candomblé and Macumba rhythms. Pattern 1 is known in Cuba as \"son clave\". Bell 2 is used in afoxê and can be thought of as pattern 1 embellished with four additional strokes. Bell 3 is used in batucada. Pattern 4 is the maracatu bell and can be thought of as pattern 1 embellished with four additional strokes.\n\nThe so-called \"bossa nova clave\" (or \"Brazilian clave\") has a similar rhythm to that of the son clave, but the second note on the two-side is delayed by one pulse (subdivision). The rhythm is typically played as a snare rim pattern in bossa nova music. The pattern is shown below in , as it is written in Brazil. In North American charts it is more likely to be written in cut-time.\n\nAccording to drummer Bobby Sanabria the Brazilian composer Antonio Carlos Jobim, who developed the pattern, considers it to be merely a rhythmic motif and not a clave (guide pattern). Jobim later regretted that Latino musicians misunderstood the role of this bossa nova pattern.\n\nThe examples below are transcriptions of several patterns resembling the Cuban clave that are found in various styles of Brazilian music, on the ago-gô and surdo instruments.\n\nLegend: Time signature: ; L=low bell, H=high bell, O = open surdo hit, X = muffled surdo hit, and | divides the measure:\n\n\nFor 3rd example above, the clave pattern is based on a common accompaniment pattern played by the guitarist. B=bass note played by guitarist's thumb, C=chord played by fingers.\n\nThe singer enters on the wrong side of the clave and the ago-gô player adjusts accordingly. This recording cuts off the first bar so that it sounds like the bell comes in on the third beat of the second bar. This is suggestive of a pre-determined rhythmic relationship between the vocal part and the percussion, and supports the idea of a clave-like structure in Brazilian music.\n\nThe son clave rhythm is present in Jamaican mento music, and can be heard on 1950s-era recordings such as \"Don’t Fence Her In\", \"Green Guava\" or \"Limbo\" by Lord Tickler, \"Mango Time\" by Count Lasher, \"Linstead Market/Day O\" by The Wigglers, \"Bargie\" by The Tower Islanders, \"Nebuchanezer\" by Laurel Aitken and others. The Jamaican population is partly of the same origin (Congo) as many Cubans, which perhaps explains the shared rhythm. It is also heard frequently in Martinique's biguine and Dominica's Jing ping. Just as likely however is the possibility that claves and the clave rhythm spread to Jamaica, Trinidad and the other small islands of the Caribbean through the popularity of Cuban son recordings from the 1920s onward.\n\nThe clave rhythm and clave concept have been used in some modern art music (\"classical\") compositions. \"Rumba Clave\" by Cuban percussion virtuoso Roberto Vizcaiño has been performed in recital halls around the world. Another clave-based composition that has \"gone global\" is the snare drum suite \"Cross\" by Eugene D. Novotney.\n\nTechnically speaking, the term \"odd meter clave\" is an oxymoron. Clave consists of two even halves, in a divisive structure of four main beats. However, in recent years jazz musicians from Cuba and outside of Cuba have been experimenting with creating new \"claves\" and related patterns in various odd meters. Clave which is traditionally used in a divisive rhythm structure, has inspired many new creative inventions in an additive rhythm context.\n\n. . . I developed the concept of adjusting claves to other time signatures, with varying degrees of success. What became obvious to me quite quickly was that the closer I stuck to the general rules of clave the more natural the pattern sounded. Clave has a natural flow with certain tension and resolve points. I found if I kept these points in the new meters they could still flow seamlessly, allowing me to play longer phrases. It also gave me many reference points and reduced my reliance on \"one\"—Guilfoyle (2006: 10).\n\nHere are some examples of recordings that use odd meter clave concepts.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It has been called a landmark, \"infamous\", and one of the most famous bars along the Jersey Shore.\n\nD'Jais Bar & Grill is located at 1801-1805 Ocean Avenue, a street which runs north and south along the Belmar coastline. It is on the west side of the street, and the front entrance faces the beach and boardwalk. According to Frank Sementa, who has been the owner since 1979, the name \"D'Jais\" comes from the childhood nickname of the first owner of the club, Dominick Joseph DiSalvo, who was called \"DJ\".\n\n D'Jais was established in 1959. Locally, it has been called the most popular bar in town, and was busy from the start. D'Jais is still a popular spot and has been called a \"Jersey shore institution for young people\". During the 1970s, D'Jais was also regular spot for Bruce Springsteen, who also took part in softball games and picnics hosted by the establishment, as well as singer and guitarist Bobby Bandiera. During that era, it was considered \"the most celebrated of the bars across from the boardwalk\", and was popularized for offering five six-ounce pilsner glasses of beer for a dollar. Local bands also played at the venue during the 70s, including Holme, whose members included Bobby Bandiera, Frank Sementa, and Kip Conner. It was purchased by Sementa, Luddecke, and Conner in 1979. They converted it from a bar famous for its live bands and cheap beer to a trendy dance club with a DJ, theme nights, and a party atmosphere.\n\nIn 1984, Monmouth County officials adopted a uniform 2 am closing time to discourage patrons from driving to other towns to find bars open later; however in 1986, D'Jais began closing at 12 am. Around 1990, Sementa added the restaurant to the site. In 2005, a study was conducted at the request of neighboring residents by the ABC board to analyze the bars operations and occupancy levels. The residents believed patrons of D'Jais had violated Quality of Life conditions. Residents were cited as spotting multiple fights, as well as other disruptive behavior.\n\nThe appearance of D'Jais has changed since the 1970s. The outdoor portion of the restaurant is covered by rooftop, and provides patrons with oceanview seating. The interior features four full-sized bars, as well as one that sits upon the outside deck. During the summer, most nights D'Jais features a DJ and dance music. There are frequently theme nights and contests. On Monday nights in the summer, Holme, a New Jersey band whose popularity dates back to the 1970s, entertains the crowd.\n\nD'Jais is considered a landmark dance club and restaurant, and has been called many things, including \"infamous\" and \"guido-central\". D'Jais was named the best overall party spot and ranked 4th out of 100 in the 100 Best Bars at the Shore by \"Fun New Jersey\". The club has attracted sports celebrities such as Kim Clijsters and Brian Lynch. Locally, it has been called the most popular bar in town, and a local hot spot.\n\nD'Jais is the lead sponsor of the annual New Jersey Sand Castle contest at the 18th Avenue beach. This contest typically attracts over 350 entries and about 10,000 participants each year.\nD'Jais also participates in other local and regional charity events.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3385026", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3385026", "title": "Denis Gifford", "text": "Denis Gifford\n\nDenis Gifford (26 December 1927 – 18 May 2000) was a British writer, broadcaster, journalist, comic artist and historian of film, comics, television and radio. In his lengthy career, he wrote and drew for British comics; wrote more than fifty books on the creators, performers, characters and history of popular media; devised, compiled and contributed to popular programmes for radio and television; and directed several short films. Gifford was also a major comics collector, owning what was perhaps the largest collection of British comics in the world.\n\nGifford's work in the history of film and comics, particularly in Britain, provided an account of the work in those media of previously unattempted scope, discovering countless lost films and titles and identifying numerous uncredited creators. He was particularly interested in the early stages in film and comics history, for which records were scarce and unreliable, and his own vast collection was an invaluable source. Gifford produced detailed filmographies of every traceable fiction, non-fiction and animated film ever released in the UK, and of early animated films in the US.\n\nHe compiled the first comics catalogue attempting to list every comic ever published in the UK, as well as the first price guide for British comics. His research into the early development of comics and cinema laid the groundwork for their academic study, and his reference works remain key texts in the fields.\n\nGifford was also a cartoonist and comic artist who worked for numerous titles, mostly for British comics in the 1940s, 50s and 60s. Although these were largely humour strips, he worked in a range of genres including superhero, Western, science fiction and adventure.\n\nGifford was born in Forest Hill, London, the only son of William Gifford, a printer, and Amelia \"née\" Hutchings. He grew up in the prosperous South London suburb of Sydenham, but was evacuated during the war to Tonbridge, Kent.\n\nGifford attended the South London private school Dulwich College (1939–44), and while a pupil there was an avid comic collector and cartoonist. He produced a comic, \"The Junior\", using heated gelatine and hectograph ink, which he sold for 1d around the school, but had published comics art by the time he was 14 (1942).\n\nGifford became friends with Bob Monkhouse, a Dulwich schoolmate, fellow schoolboy cartoonist and later TV comedian and presenter, who studied in the year below and also had cartoons published while at the school. Gifford and Monkhouse collaborated on comics writing and drawing, a partnership that was to continue for many years in various forms, including as radio scriptwriters. The two toured together as a comedy act in the south east of England in the late 1940s with Ernie Lower's West Bees Concert Party, giving charity performances with Monkhouse as the 'straight man'. Gifford continued drawing during National Service in the Royal Air Force (1946-8), in which he served in the clerical position of 'AC1 Clerk/Pay Accounts', and went on to draw the \"Telestrip\" cartoon for the \"London Evening News\".\n\nGifford's prolific career as a cartoonist included both newspaper strips and comics, almost entirely for British publishers. His first published work was \"Magical Monty\" for \"All-Fun Comics\" (1942) at the age of 14, with a contribution to \"The Dandy\" the same year, and briefly worked as junior cartoonist for the newspaper \"Reynold's News\" (1944–45). He collaborated on comics writing and drawing with school friend Bob Monkhouse while they were still pupils at Dulwich College together.\n\nAfter his National Service, Gifford drew the \"Telestrip\" cartoon for the \"London Evening News\", continuing in \"Rex magazine\" (1971–72), and on bubblegum and cigarette sweet packets. Other newspaper strips were produced by Gifford for \"Empire State News\" and \"Sunday Dispatch\".\n\nGifford's early work was with D.C. Thomson and the majority of his work was for humour strips, but he went on to cover various genres and styles, including adventure, detective, science fiction, Western and superheroes.\n\nGifford was most productive as a comics artist in the 1940s, 50s and 60s. By the early 1970s Gifford's writing career, mainly on the subjects of comics and film history, began to take over from his work as a cartoonist in his own right.\n\nGifford had a distinctive, simple drawing style with a light-heartedness evident even in more action-orientated strips. Panels were often bustling and dynamic, with individual characters vying for attention. His humours strips were dense with conspicuously labelled puns and 'sight gags', the \"visual conventions\" of comic art, informed by an intense awareness of the cultural heritage of the medium.\n\nIn the period Gifford drew for them, D.C. Thomson and most British comic publishers had a strict policy that artists could not sign their work but exceptionally, he was allowed to clearly sign his art.\n\nGifford created at least three of the earliest British Golden Age superheroes, Mr Muscle for \"Dynamic Comics\" (1945), Streamline, whose #1 tagline proclaimed him \"The speediest fighter in the world\", co-created with Monkhouse for \"Streamline Comics\" (1947) and Tiger-Man, debuting in \"Ray Regan\" #1 (1949). Gifford himself credits \"the first British superhero in the American comic book style\" to Derickson Dene by Nat Brand in British anthology comic \"The Triumph\" in 1939, but both Mr Muscle and Streamline were early attempts to introduce British characters in a characteristically American genre, prompted by severely limited imports or reprints of US superhero titles due to wartime paper rationing and import restrictions. Gifford and Monkhouse set up their own publishing company, Streamline, in the early 1950s which published reprints of other Golden Age superheroes such as Captain Might and Masterman.\n\nOnly \"Streamline Comics\" #1 had story and art by Gifford, although he contributed the one-page humour strip \"Inky the Imp of the Inkpot\" and the adventure strip \"Search for the Secret City\" in #4.\n\nMr Muscle should not to be confused with the later DC character Mister Muscle of \"Hero Hotline\", created by Bob Rozakis, or the Charlton Comics character Mr. Muscles, created by Jerry Siegel. Tiger-Man should not be confused with Tiger Man, the Street & Smith Golden Age hero, Tigerman, the Fiction House Golden Age hero, or Tiger-Man, the Atlas/ Seaboard character.\n\nGifford created, wrote and edited several comics in the 1940s and 1950s. These included detective title \"Ray Regan\" (1949), with art by Ron Embleton, the pantomime-themed \"Panto Pranks\" (1949), which Gifford wrote and drew, \"Fizz Comics\" (1949) and \"Star Comics\" (1954), which he drew and edited with Monkhouse, featuring strips of contemporary entertainers Morecambe and Wise, Bob Monkhouse himself, Jill Day and movie character Tobor The Great. These titles created by Gifford often ran for just a single issue, to take advantage of a loophole in postwar paper rationing, but the succession of short projects suited Gifford's diverse interests as it enabled him to flit from genre to genre.\n\nGifford drew and often wrote a number of Western comics strips in the 1940s, 50s and 60s, including \"'Ace High' Rogers versus Redmask\" (1946), \"Bill Elliott in Republic's Old Los Angeles\" in \"The Sheriff\" #3 (1948) and strips for \"Annie Oakley\" (1957–58) and \"Gunhawks Western\" (1960–61).\n\nGifford provided art for movie adaptation strip \"Roy Rogers\" in Western comic \"The Sheriff Comics\" (no date, 1950s), signing himself 'Gus Denis Gifford' and offering a drawing style [in which] \"[h]is likenesses could approach very close to the American ones produced by Harry Parks\", consistent with Gifford's busy, comical style in other genres.\n\nGifford and Monkhouse contributed cartoon strips to various magazines in the 1940s and 1950s, including \"Galaxy\" magazine (1946) (not to be confused with \"Galaxy Science Fiction\").\n\nGifford drew the cover for \"Classics Illustrated\" #146 (British series), \"Adventures of Baron Munchausen\" (1962), a more comedic and cartoon-like rendering than was conventional for the title's covers, which tended to be classically heroic and often painted.\n\nGifford went on to produce several strips for the highly popular humour comic \"Knockout\", including \"Our Ernie\" (1950), \"Stoneage Kit the Ancient Brit\" and his own creation, the gags and puzzles strip \"Steadfact McStaunch\". He later revived \"Steadfast McStaunch\" for a run in IPC's new title \"Whizzer and Chips\" (1969), which itself merged with \"Knockout\" in 1973.\n\nAfter working with Mick Anglo on the ABC science-fiction title \"Space Comics\" (1953–54), Gifford began work for Anglo Studios when it was set up in 1954, including a long stint writing and illustrating early \"Marvelman\", the superhero reinvented in the 1980s with a darker vision by Alan Moore. Gifford worked on a number of strips in several titles in the \"Marvelman\" stable, and created the light-hearted backup features \"Flip and Flop\" and \"The Friendly Soul\". He also wrote an editorial piece, \"Founding a Family\", on the history of \"Marvelman Family\" for a 1988 reprint of the strip in \"Miracleman Family\" #2. \nWhen Anglo took on US reprint series \"Annie Oakley\", Gifford was one of the staff of British and Spanish artists used to create new strips (1957–58). Gifford went on to provide Western strips for Anglo Features title \"Gunhawks Western\" (1960–61) and humour strip \"Our Lad\" for Anglo's \"Captain Miracle\" (1961) contributed several humour strips for Anglo's anthology of Silver Age DC reprints, \"Super DC\" (1969–70), as well as reprints of his humour strip \"The Friendly Soul\" from \"Marvelman\" in \"Superman Bumper Book\" (1970) and \"Super DC Bumper Book\" #1 (1971). Later in the 1960s, Gifford also produced the one-off \"News of the Universe Television Service\" and regular humour strips \"Dan Dan the TV Man\" and the collection of one or two-panel gags, \"Jester Moment\" for \"TV Tornado\" (1967–68) where Mick Anglo was editor.\n\nAlthough Gifford did not have an academic background, he was an acknowledged authority on film history who is respected by academics in film studies, media studies and social and cultural history. Much of his reference work is recommended reading in these disciplines. Along with several other pioneering film archivists, Gifford's 'encyclopaedic work' was recognised by the Institute of Historical Research as having \"provided thoroughgoing maps of British film personnel and production histories\".\n\nGifford compiled a comprehensive reference work of British-made films, \"The British Film Catalogue, 1895-1970: A Reference Guide\", listing every traceable film made in the UK, including short films generally omitted by film catalogues, with detailed entries including running time, certificate, reissue date, distributor, production company, producer, director, main cast, genre and plot summary. It was a labour of many years, as Gifford tracked down retired industry professionals and researched back issues of trade publications, fanzines and directories. The Catalogue's third (1994) edition revised all entries and was published in two volumes, \"The Fiction Film, 1895–1994\" and \"The Non-Fiction Film, 1888–1994\". It became a seminal work for British film historians, acclaimed by The British Film Institute (BFI)'s curator of Moving Image in a \"Sight & Sound\" magazine shortlist of the best ever film books: \"The nearest we have to a British national filmography was created not by any institute or university but by one man.\" Gifford's popular work \"A Pictorial History of Horror\" also made the shortlist.\n\nAll editions of the Catalogue omitted animated films, but Gifford's \"British Animated Films, 1895–1985: A Filmography\" provided a similarly completist approach. Over 1200 films were detailed, attempting to include every British animated film of the period with a cinema release, whether full-length feature, short, public information film or advertisement. Gifford also provides an historical overview, giving particular attention to the pre-World War II era. As he was to attempt with the history of comics, Gifford sought to correct inaccuracies in cinema history that gave undue credit to the US industry, citing Dudley Buxton \"who [in 1915] first animated the sinking of the Lusitania in all its terrifying drama, three years before Winsor McCay tackled the same subject in the United states. Yet according to film history, McCay's version was the world's first dramatic cartoon film!\"\n\nGifford's writing also included biographies of cinematic figures, including \"Karloff: The Man, The Monster, The Movies\" and \"The Movie Makers: Chaplin\", with his meticulous research and detailed knowledge well suited to the form.\n\nGifford was a judge at the Sitges 1977 International Festival of Fantasy and Horror.\n\nThe BFI holds an extensive archive of interviews recorded by Gifford of various figures in the film, television and comics industries. \"The Denis Gifford Collection\" is held as part of the BFI National Library. The BFI ran a Denis Gifford Tribute Evening at the National Film Theatre in January 2001 to mark his work on film history.\n\nAs well as vintage comedy, Gifford had a particular interest in genre films, favouring the origins of those genres and the lower-budget B-movie output. He had written for science fiction fanzines since the 1950s, which he regarded as the period in which the genre gained maturity in the cinema: \"it was the 1950s before sci-fi really got started, first with George Pal's astounding semi-documentary \"Destination Moon\" pipped at cinematic post by Robert L. Lipert's B-movie \"Rocketship X-M\". Where the cinema led, comics followed.\" He had attempted to spur early science fiction 'fandom' with his 1952 \"Space Patrol Official Handbook\", an introduction to science fiction that included an index of 'films of future fantasy' from the 1902 French 'trick' film \"A Trip to the Moon\" by Georges Méliès and the 1918 Danish \"A Trip to Mars\" up to contemporary films such as the 1951 \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\", screen shots from recent science fiction films \"The Man From Planet X\", \"Rocketship X-M\", \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" and \"When Worlds Collide\". Astronomical facts and diagrams of imagined spacecraft and spacesuit, drawn by Gifford, were also included.\n\nHorror held a special fascination for Gifford: he was an active figure in horror fandom of the 1950s, 60s and 70s, including the Gothique Film Society, and in the 1970s he had regular columns in Dez Skinn's \"House of Hammer\" magazine, first a serialised \"Golden History of Horror\" and later \"History of Hammer\". However, Gifford had been deeply critical of Hammer Studios, especially the productions of its later years, preferring the more understated examples of early British and Hollywood horror. He found Hammer's relatively explicit use of blood-letting and sexuality to be cynically exploitative, noting in his 1973 \"A Pictorial History of Horror\" that \"The new age of horror was geared to a new taste. Where the old films had quickly cut away from the sight of blood, Hammer cut in for a closeup.\" \"A Pictorial History of Horror\" was an influential work for a generation of film and horror enthusiasts, described in \"The Paris Review\" by author and journalist Dave Tompkins as \"the most important book of my childhood\".\n\nGifford was a lifelong fan of Laurel and Hardy, and founded 'Film Funsters', the first British branch of the Laurel & Hardy Appreciation Society, as well as writing several articles on the duo. He was also a keen Sherlock Holmes enthusiast, and was a member of the Sherlock Holmes Society and wrote various reviews and articles on films featuring the detective.\n\nGifford wrote numerous articles on film and popular entertainment, both professionally and for fanzines.\n\nAlthough a highly respected film historian, Gifford's professional involvement in cinema was relatively limited. However, in the 1950s and 1960s he directed and photographed a number of short films, most of which were publicity and public information films commissioned by the British Government. He also produced and directed the Pathe newsreel \"Highlight: The Singing Cinema\" (1964), a compilation of extracts from British musical films from 1929–64.\n\nWhile at Pathe, Gifford married Angela Kalagias, a fellow Pathé employee. The couple, who later divorced, had one daughter, Pandora Jane, born in 1965.\n\nGifford scripted the Space Race spoof \"Carry on\" \"Spaceman\" in 1962, but although scheduled the film was not shot.\n\nGifford was regarded by many as the UK's pre-eminent comics historian, particularly of early British comics. The British Library provides catalogues and reference works written by Gifford as assistance to researchers of its \"British Comics Collection\", and indeed most of the reference works on the subject provided by the British Library were written by Gifford.\n\nComics scholarship, still relatively undeveloped in comparison to other media, was almost non-existent in 1971, when Gifford published his first book on comics history, \"Discovering Comics\". At that time, no comprehensive archive of British comics existed, no fully researched cataloguing had been attempted, the mass pulping of comics in Britain in the 1940s meant that many issues and even titles were lost without effective records, no university courses were dedicated to the study of the medium, and serious research and debate had not taken place into the origin and development of the comic as a form. Gifford was determined that the comic should gain a credibility in mainstream culture and academia which it already possessed in continental Europe, and to a lesser extent the US: \"Curiously, only Great Britain, where the comic paper was born, takes its comics for what they superficially seem – ephemera to be discarded as soon as read.\" Although enthusiastic about comics of every era, Gifford had a particular passion for vintage comics, \"earlier in the medium's evolution, when it was a chaos of one-offs, irregular schedules, and a comic historian's nightmare of inept publishers operating from the back rooms of run-down bookshops on a shoe string budget.\"\n\nGifford provided the first reliable, detailed account of early comics in works such as \"Victorian Comics\" (1976) and \"The British Comics Catalogue, 1874–1974\" (1974), with a detailed overview in his \"International Book of Comics\" (1984). He also advanced debate on the origins of comics, including what the first comic and comic characters were, arguing that \"there is no point [in the history of comics] where we can pick up a paper and declare it Comic Number One.\" He identified the first comedic narrative periodical, as an antecedent to the comic as \"The Comick Magazine\" (1796) which although all text included a single William Hogarth print per issue, which Gifford suggested when combined formed a \"narrative sequence ... [so that] they could be described as an early form of comic strip.\" Gifford identified the significant stage of \"the first continuing cartoon hero\" as Rowlandson's \"Dr Syntax\" in the serial \"The Schoolmaster's Tour\" in \"The Poetical Magazine\" (1 May 1809). He argued that \"in Europe, perhaps the world\" the first caricature magazine, an important prototypical form of the comic, was Hopkirk's \"The Glasgow Looking Glass\" (11 June 1825).\n\nGifford located the origin of the modern graphic narrative in the late nineteenth century, tracing development through various stages that included \"Judy - The London Serio-Comic Journal\" (1 May 1867) featuring \"Ally Sloper\", the first recurring character in a text and picture serial. He observed in \"Victorian Comics\" that Sloper \"was the first to appear in comic book format ... a paperback reprint collection ... the first to have his own comic paper ... and was the longest lived [character] in comic history.\" He suggested a key contender as the first comic as being the paper \"Funny Folks\" (12 December 1874), which had an unprecedented half-picture, half-text per page layout. Sloper's debut was certainly a series of panels, but it lacks \"interdependence as a sequential narrative strategy\" with images each relaying a single joke without forming a narrative with other panels, and it lacked some key features of the form, such as the speech bubble, while it had accompanying text for each image. Debate continues, but Gifford's research and conclusions into the origins of comics as a medium have gained considerable academic acceptance.\n\nAlly Sloper was championed by Gifford as the world's first ever comic character, and became a totemic figure for him, being revived and sometimes drawn by him in a number of comics and other publications that sought to ensure a modern readership had an awareness of early comic history. The \"Ally Sloper\" magazine was not a commercial success and lasted only four issues, but the innovation of Gifford's tone in the title was acknowledged by one cultural historian as \"[w]ith his accurate spoof of the style of traditional British humour comics ... anticipat[ing] Viz by nearly three years.\" He produced artwork for advertisements for an Ally Sloper T-shirt, which was published in several Alan Class Comics titles in 1976, to promote the \"Ally Sloper\" magazine. Gifford also initiated the Ally Sloper Awards in 1976, an annual prize for veteran comic artists.\n\nAt a summit on comics history convened by the 1989 Lucca Comics Festival in Italy, Gifford was invited to be one of the eleven 'international specialists' to sign a declaration that The Yellow Kid was the first comic character having been first published in 1895. Gifford signed, but pointedly did so in the name of Ally Sloper, first published in 1867.\n\nGifford sought to draw a distinct definition for British comics history, as the Golden Age and other historical eras of comics were first defined to describe US comics history. These eras relate to UK comics only as a result of American influence on the UK market and creators, and do not acknowledge key differences in British comics of the period, notably the preponderance in Britain of humorous anthologies rather than the genre titles, most especially superheroes, that predominated in the US. Gifford observed that the \"Thirties were the Golden Age of British comics\" due to the profusion of successful, high quality and specifically British humour comics beginning in the 1930s, including D.C. Thomson's \"The Dandy\" (4 December 1937), \"The Beano\" (30 July 1938) and \"Magic\" (22 July 1939) and Amalgamated Press's \"Jingles\" (1934), \"Jolly\" (1935), \"Golden\" (23 October 1937), \"Radio Fun\" (15 October 1938), \"Happy Days\" (8 October 1938) and \"Knockout\" (4 March 1939). The start of the Second World War in 1939, and the resulting paper shortages, marked the end of many of the titles, a definable end to the era and the beginning of what Gifford termed the \"Dark Age\".\n\nGifford's \"The British Comics Catalogue, 1874–1974\" (1974) was the first comprehensive index of British comics, and his later \"British Comics, Story Papers, Picture Libraries, Girls Papers, American Reprints, Facsmilies, Giveaways Price Guide\" (1982) the first attempt to offer a price guide for British comics (US comic books had been covered by \"The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide\" since 1970). It was the antecedent of works such as the \"Official Comic Book Price Guide for Great Britain\" (1989).\n\nGifford had a particular interest in children's comics. Although his collection included 1960s underground comics, the alternative comics of the 1970s as well as the more experimental mainstream of comics' Modern Age, he was not initially convinced by changing conceptions of comics as a medium suited to addressing adult themes such as sexuality, violence and storytelling techniques influenced by literary fiction, cinema and art. He recognised that the growth in adult readership of comics since the 1970s was due to nostalgia, but did not foresee the potential for a development of the medium. \"And nostalgia is escape. The comics - the best of them - represent wholesome innocence, a marvelous sense of fun and a pointer to current times perhaps, the triumphant overcoming of all sorts of difficulties.\" When children's comics began to reflect changes in cinema and mass culture, he was unafraid to speak out, even where this might involve constraints on the comics industry and creators.\n\nAfter media outrage at the 1976 \"Look Out for Lefty\" strip about football hooliganism in the IPC comic \"Action\", Gifford controversially drew parallels with the Wertham censorship of the US comics industry in the 1950s, remarking that \"Perhaps its time we had another outcry against products like \"Action\". \"Action\" is a new kind of comic geared to the lowest form of behaviour in children. Just as pornography caters for a mass market for adults, stuff like this provides violence for a mass market of children. As far as the people who produce \"Action\" are concerned, the children are simply a market and moral considerations do not apply.\" Despite \"2000 AD\" (#1 published in 1977) producing iconic characters and innovative and critically acclaimed stortelling and art, Gifford had similar reservations about its violent content: \"Whether children would actually enjoy living in [the future] ... is another matter, for as depicted ... the future is a world of unrelieved violence.\" Gifford was clear that his preferences in comics writing and art were informed by his nostalgia for UK comics of the 1930s, reflecting that \"I look back to the days of my youth ... when comics were things of joy and pleasure, rather than blood and guts.\"\n\nHowever, Gifford's concerns were limited to comics intended for children and adolescents, and he was well aware of a development of the medium for an adult audience. He collected and was able to appreciate the content of underground and Modern Age comics, offering sophisticated and sometimes sympathetic analysis. Gifford's own \"Ally Sloper\" comic (1976) offered a combination of vintage and alternative strips for an adult audience, although the nostalgic strips were his primary interest.\n\nWorking for the \"Guinness Book of Records\" as a comics expert, Gifford had to qualify his recommendation that \"The Dandy\" be regarded as the world's oldest comic (first issue December 1937) after the entry was challenged in 1999. The first issue of Italian comics magazine \"Il Giornalino\" was cover dated 1 October 1924, US comic book \"Detective Comics\" (March 1937) began nine months earlier, and the Belgian comic magazine \"Spirou\" had more issues. Gifford admitted that \"[i]t may be that we will have to insert the word British into the Guinness Book of Records to clarify the position.\" \n\nGifford's work \"The Golden Age of Radio\" was the first reference guide to programmes, broadcasters and catchphrases of radio of the 1930s and 1940s, and remains an important source for researchers in radio history.\n\nGifford was working on a filmography and history of 1930s British television, but died before its completion.\n\nGifford wrote extensively for comedy and light entertainment in both television and radio, his work often reflecting his fascinations of radio and film nostalgia and cartoon art.\n\nGifford wrote the first television series of comedy stars Morecambe and Wise, \"Running Wild\" (1954), having been brought in with fellow cartoonist, comic enthusiast and film buff Tony Hawes to save a series which was initially panned by critics. He also provided material for the opening night of ITV (1955) and co-wrote the first comedy show to be screened by BBC2, the TV movie \"Alberts' Channel Too\" (1964) for the launch of the channel, although the whole evening's broadcasting was lost due to a power blackout. He wrote for \"Junior Showtime\" (1973), devised the nostalgia panel show \"Looks Familiar\" (1970–87) for Thames TV, presented by Denis Norden, its radio counterpart \"Sounds Familiar\" and the Thames quiz show \"Quick on the Draw\" (1974–1979) featuring drawings by cartoonists and celebrities, with presenters including Bob Monkhouse, Rolf Harris and Bill Tidy. He also wrote scripts for the ITV children's puppet shows \"Witches' Brew\" (1973) and \"The Laughing Policeman\" (1974). Gifford also designed stunts for the popular BBC1 game show \"The Generation Game\".\n\nThe scriptwriting partnership with Hawes began in radio, for weekly BBC concert party \"The Light Optimists\" (1953) and continued with stunt devising for the US-bought game show \"People Are Funny\" for Radio Luxembourg.\n\nA broadcaster in his own right, Gifford featured in numerous television and radio programmes as an expert in the history of film, radio and comics, as well as appearances in a variety of documentary and news magazine programmes over several decades. \nAppearances included editions of BBC's \"On The Braden Beat\" (1964) commenting on comics, Granada's \"Clapperboard\" (1974) and a review of forthcoming horror films for BBC1's \"Film 1973\" (1973), \"Goon but not Forgotten\", a radio history of the Goon Show as part of the \"Laughter in the Air: The Story of Radio Comedy\" (1979) and twice as guest panellist for Radio 4 panel show \"Quote... Unquote\" (1985).\n\nGifford and Monkhouse reprised their partnership with BBC radio programmes on the history of the comics, \"Sixpence for a Superman\" (1999) on British comics and the two-part \"A Hundred Laughs for a Ha'penny\" (1999), a history of comic papers.\n\nGifford also regularly wrote obituaries of notable figures in comics, film and entertainment history for British national newspapers \"The Independent\" and \"The Guardian\" and posthumously for the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\", drawing on his specialist knowledge and often personal familiarity with the subject. His output was prolific and constant, with his own obituary in \"The Guardian\" noting that \"[h]is last commission was phoned in from his home in Sydenham, south London, to his editor on Thursday, May 18; it is thought he died the same day.\" \n\nGifford's most valuable research resource was his own collection, as in over sixty years he had accumulated what is generally recognised as the largest comic collection in the UK and the largest collection of British comics in the world, including the only known complete runs of all comics published in the UK in the 1940s. He collected the first and last issues of all comics published in the UK, as well as Christmas issues and other special editions, and also collected first issues of US comics. To a lesser extent, first issues of comics from other countries were also collected. Gifford was also a collector of other ephemera, including pulp books, popular magazines, theatrical programmes, film and comic fanzines, original film scripts and sheet music, as well as pop culture memorabilia, describing himself as \"the keeper of the nation's nostalgia\". and with a collection that included periodicals not to be found in the British Library.\n\nIt was an obsession which dominated both his life and his South London home, once described in a colour supplement interview as the den of \"a boy who had run away from home\" and never returned. A reliable figure was never established for the size of his collection, but its scale constrained movement throughout the house and extended into every room, even the kitchen: \"There are comics on the stove, on the fridge, on the floor. Denis Gifford can still use his grill, but roasts are a memory for he can no longer open his oven. The fridge filled up years ago, for Denis is fascinated by the free gifts that come with some comics ... There are lollipops in the fridge now, and Desperate Dan nougat.\"\n\nUnusually for a collector, Gifford's interests were defined by their eclecticism, including comics, radio recordings and film from throughout the world and spanning from the origins of the media up to new releases. His own 'biog' for a 1975 book calculates his collection \"extends to some 20,000 issues\" but is careful to limit the estimate to the particularly British form of 'comic papers' which excluded his vast collection of American comic books, and in any case accumulated many more in the next 25 years of his life. He had certain specific interests, notably British horror films of the 1930s to the 1960s, early cinema and radio, Laurel and Hardy movies and memorabilia, British comic papers of the late nineteenth century and British and US comics of the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, especially those which featured personalities from contemporary radio. However, the parameters of his interests and collection broadened substantially throughout his life.\n\nGifford's collection had suffered an early setback, an anecdote related by Bob Monkhouse: \"You cannot begin to imagine his grief when he completed his National Service to return home to find that his mother had thrown away his huge collection of \"Film Fun\", \"The Joker\", \"Merry\" and \"Bright\" and a dozen other titles ... Denis was to spend the rest of his life trying to replace those lost copies.\" Gifford's mother was later to express deep regret at their destruction.\n\nDespite his hopes that his vast collection might form the basis of a national museum of comics, through an archive such as the Victoria and Albert Museum National Art Library Comics and Comic Art Collection, it was broken up and auctioned off after his death, \"leaving 12 tons of paper at his home to be cleared and sorted.\" Monkhouse reflected in the foreword to auction catalogue of \"The Denis Gifford Collection\" on how one \"whose researches were so meticulous have allowed this vast gathering of treasures to have swollen into such unruly and uncatalogued confusion\". The sale was described in the auction pamphlet as \"surely the largest private collection of annuals, books, cartoons, cinema history, comics, ephemera & original artwork ever to come on the market. The collection, housed in some 600 boxes and weighing ten tons, arrived on a groaning lorry and took five men nearly three hours to unload. We expect sales to run to some 4000 lots.\"\n\nGifford's collection was the product of his lifelong passion for comics and popular culture, and his highly prolific research work was an attempt to provide a comprehensive history of the ephemeral. Particularly in the early decades of his writing on the subject, pop culture drew little attention from academic research and Gifford was particularly passionate about the most obscure examples of vintage comics, film, television and radio, and determined that they should be recognised, chronicled and remembered before extant copies were lost.\n\nGifford was a pivotal figure in the development of comics \"fandom\" in the UK, first through his writing and publishing of early fanzines in the 1950s. In the 1970s he helped introduce comics conventions to the UK, events where creators and industry figures could meet and respond to comics fans. It was a significant progression of the already established comics marts where comics were simply sold, and in which Gifford was a key figure, providing the introductory presentation at the Comic Mart Summer Special 1974 and other UK events.\n\nIn 1974 he was the only comics industry guest at an early meeting of Britain's major comics convention, Comicon 74. Gifford organised Comics 101 in 1976, the first convention dedicated to British comic creators, with guests including celebrated figures in British comics including Frank Hampson, Leo Baxendale, Frank Bellamy and Ron Embleton, \"Marvelman\" creator Mick Anglo and \"Garth\" creator Steve Dowling, Gifford conducting an on-stage interview with Dowling. The name of the convention was a reference to the 101 years since the first issue of \"Funny Folks\" (1874) which Gifford regarded as the first comic.\n\nIn 1977 Gifford co-founded the Society of Strip Illustration, a network for all those involved in any stage of the creative process of comics production which later became the Comic Creators Guild. In 1978 he established the Association of Comics Enthusiasts, whose newsletter \"Comic Cuts\" ran for 14 years proper and, as a section of UK comics fanzine \"The Illustrated Comics Journal\", until his death. Gifford also wrote extensively for comics magazines and fanzines, particularly \"Comic Cuts\", and it was here that he wrote some of his most specialist work on comics history and criticism.\n\nPrizegiving of the first Ally Sloper Awards for comic creators also took place at Comics 101, with Bob Monkhouse presenting.\n\nGifford continued to organise, guest and attend comics conventions throughout the 1970s, 80s and 90s in the UK, USA and throughout Europe, including regular guest appearances the Lucca International Comics Festival, was an official guest at the first UK Comic Art Convention (UKCAC) in 1985 and was a guest speaker at the 1st UK Paperback and Pulp Bookfair in 1991.\n\nGifford created the Ally Sloper Awards, a series of awards to recognise veteran British comics artists. The award was first presented in 1976, but no longer runs.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a variant of the \"la partage\" rule, in which a player loses only half their even-odds stake if the original spin is a zero, recouping the other half (\"partage\" being French for \"sharing\"). In European casinos, where \"la partage\" is customary, the player may be given the option instead to place their original stake \"en prison\" (\"in prison\" in French). The stake is left on the previous bet, and the croupier places a marker on it to show it is \"en prison\". If the bet wins on the next spin, the player's stake is returned; if it loses, it is forfeited.

In 1999, the company was renamed \"Entertainment Rights\". \n\nIn 1989, \"Sleepy Kids\" was founded by Martin and Vivien Schrager-Powell. It was created in order to produce \"\" (Potsworth and Co. in the UK) a children's animated series. Schrager-Powell's business partner was Hanna-Barbera. Within months of the founding, Sleepy Kids became a public company. It produced \"Dr. Zitbag's Transylvania Pet Shop\" and \"Budgie the Little Helicopter\".\n\nBetween 1998 and 1999, Sleepy Kids expanded. In December 1998, the company merged with The Richard Digance Card Company, Clipper Films and Ridgeway Films. In 1999, the company acquired Siriol Productions. Also in 1999, Sleepy Kids purchased Boom Boom (owner of \"Basil Brush\"), Carrington Productions International (owner of the Ventureworld Films and \"Dr. Zitbag's Transylvania Pet Shop\".\n\nFollowing these acquisitions, Sleepy Kids was renamed \"SKD Media\". In 2000, SKD Media was renamed \"Entertainment Rights\". Entertainment Rights purchased the rights to programs from companies such as Link Entertainment (distributors for Woodland Animations) Varga London, Hibbert Ralph Entertainment, and Maddocks Animation and Little Entertainment Company.\n\nIn 2004, Entertainment rights acquired Tell-Tale Productions and rights to most of the Filmation library from Sonar Entertainment (Hallmark). \n\nAt the end of 2004, Entertainment Rights employed 95 people. In the 2005 financial year, Entertainment Rights' revenue was £12.4 million. The company bid for Chorion but the offer was rejected.\n\nIn 2005, Siriol Productions came under new management. The company was renamed \"Calon\". Most of the rights to completed productions were kept by Entertainment Rights. \n\nOn 11 January 2007, Entertainment Rights acquired Classic Media for (£106.9 million).

{"id": "56668567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56668567", "title": "Five Easy Pieces (Milo Rau)", "text": "Five Easy Pieces (Milo Rau)\n\n\"Five Easy Pieces\" (2016) is a theatre production that the Swiss theatre and film director Milo Rau made with children for the Ghent arts centre CAMPO and that is based on the Dutroux affair.\n\nAs with other theatre productions by Milo Rau, testimonies and reconstructions of true facts form the basis of \"Five Easy Pieces\". In this case they relate to the life and the crimes of Marc Dutroux, who kidnapped, raped and murdered with the help of some accomplices a series of children in the 90s in Belgium. Milo Rau says that he is always looking for the traumatic, tragic moments in the lives of both individuals and a country, because we are most affected and changed in those moments.\n\nHowever, Milo Rau's intention was not to create an accurate representation of the Dutroux affair with \"Five Easy Pieces\", but a modern tragedy with Dutroux as the starting point. His intention was to make \"a children's theatre performance that was risky, unprecedented and virtually impossible.\" With the life and the crimes of Marc Dutroux as a starting point he searches in \"Five Easy Pieces\" for the limits of \"what children know, feel and do\", and explores what is acceptable and unacceptable for the spectators.\n\nThe essence of \"Five Easy Pieces\" is not the horror of the Dutroux affair, but the big themes that lie behind this specific case. According to Milo Rau, these are \"the decline of a country, the national paranoia, the mourning, and the anger that followed the crimes.\" It is not the killer and his psyche that interest him, but the history of Belgium and the collapse of Western colonial and industrial powers. In the Dutroux affair a number of important historical events concerning Belgium converge: from the loss of the Congo colony to the closure of the coal mines. In the theatre production Marc Dutroux functions as a kind of collective symbol for Belgium, as a black hole.\n\nWith \"Five Easy Pieces\" Milo Rau fictionalizes the Dutroux affair with the aim of telling something that exceeds the case. According to his own word, Marc Dutroux is a pretext for him to talk \"about a government that does not function and about to what extent people have been disconnected from the political system.\" The Dutroux affair serves as an allegory about how we experience the world and think about it, and about how we deal with the emotional shock and pain caused by an extremely upsetting experience.\n\nMilo Rau's \"Five Easy Pieces\" is also a reflection on theatre. The title \"Five Easy Pieces\" refers to a series of exercises that Igor Stravinsky composed in 1917 in order to teach children how to play the piano, and that were also called \"Five Easy Pieces\". The theatre production of Milo Rau is made up of five monologues, each offering a different perspective on how children learn to act and how they learn to grow up. Milo Rau sees his performances as \"Lehrstücke\", in the Brechtian tradition: his actors learn to play.\n\nEvery scene of Milo Rau's \"Five Easy Pieces\" starts with the projection of a short film in which adults start the scene. The children then take up live, act the scene simultaneously on the theatre stage, and continue playing while the only adult actor - in the role of director - films and encourages them. In this way the children play the role of the old and sick father of Dutroux, a police agent who discovers the murdered children, one of his victims and the parents of one of his other victims. What Milo Rau was interested in was to show the audience that a director, just like Marc Dutroux, is always a manipulator to a certain extent and that there exists a power game between him and his actors (especially if they are children).\n\nMilo Rau is responsible for the concept, text and direction of \"Five Easy Pieces\". The actors on stage are Rachel Dedain, Aimone De Zordo, Fons Dumont, Arno John Keys, Maurice Leerman, Pepijn Loobuyck, Willem Loobuyck, Blanche Ghyssaert, Polly Persyn, Lucia Redondo, Peter Seynaeve, Pepijn Siddiki, Elle Liza Tayou, Winne Vanacker, Hendrik Van Doorn and Eva Luna Van Hijfte. However, they form two different casts of seven children and one adult. Peter Seynaeve also takes on the role of directing assistant and performance coach. The actors in the film material are Sara De Bosschere, Pieter-Jan De Wyngaert, Johan Leysen, Peter Seynaeve, Jan Steen, Ans Van den Eede, Hendrik Van Doorn and Annabelle Van Nieuwenhuyse. Stefan Bläske is the dramatic advisor.\n\"Five Easy Pieces\" (Milo Rau, 2016) is a production of the Ghent arts centre CAMPO and the International Institute of Political Murder (IIPM), the theatre and film production company of Milo Rau. Co-producers are the Kunstenfestivaldesarts (Brussels), Münchner Kammerspiele, La Bâtie - Festival de Genève, Kaserne Basel, Gessnerallee Zürich, Singapore International Festival of Arts (SIFA), SICK! Festival (Manchester), Sophiensaele Berlin and Le phénix scene national Valenciennes pôle européen de création.\n\n\"Five Easy Pieces\" premiered on 14 May 2016 at the Kunstenfestivaldesarts in Brussels. An extensive tour in Belgium and abroad followed afterwards, from 2016 until 2018. In Belgium, the production was performed in Aalst, Brussels, Charleroi, Genk, Ghent, Mons, Namur, Ostend, Roeselare, Turnhout, Waregem and Zaventem. In the Netherlands performances took place in Amsterdam, 's-Hertogenbosch, Rotterdam and Utrecht. In addition, the production travelled around the world with an extensive series of performances in Argentina, Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Germany, France, Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland.\n\n\"Five Easy Pieces\" received wide critical acclaim in the press. Based on a poll among about fifty critics, the German specialist journal Theater Heute proclaimed \"Five easy pieces\" as best production of the year.\nTheatre critic Tuur Devens wrote in the Dutch theatre magazine Theaterkrant: \"But let Dutroux play by children?! Children who play casual and innocent, you can not let them bring such horror? Milo Rau does it, and in his way in a splendid way: the subject matter of \"Five Easy Pieces\" is the Dutroux affair, but at the same time it is about playing, about manipulation and abuse of power in the world, outside and in theatre.\" In the Dutch newspaper NRC culture editor Herien Wensink wrote: \"You could blame director Milo Rau - public impact is guaranteed - but the execution is subdued and integer, the result powerful and disruptive.\" Journalist Magali Degrande wrote in the Belgian newspaper Het Nieuwsblad: \"\"Five Easy Pieces\" makes you shiver and smile, a nacre pickaxe that reveals hidden basements and rolls flat over them. Irresponsibly good theater.\"\n\nYet there were also some critical reactions, especially from Jean Lambrecks, the father of one of the victims of Dutroux. He was disappointed because Milo Rau's production is insufficiently a factual representation of the Dutroux affair.\n\nIn 2017 \"Five Easy Pieces\" was selected for the Theater Festival in both the Netherlands and Flanders. Together with \"Risjaar Drei\" (Olympique Dramatique and Toneelhuis, 2017), it was the only production that was selected for both festivals, which present the most interesting performances of the past season. In its report the jury of the Flanders Theatre Festival wrote: \"Its wry humour and its political-social commitment make 'Five Easy Pieces' one of the most captivating theatre experiences of the past season, which the jury voted for as one block\". In 2017 the production was also selected for the German Theatertreffen festival, which shows the ten most notable productions of the past season.\n\nIn October 2016 Milo Rau received the Special Prize of the Jury 2016 for \"Five Easy Pieces\" from the Belgian \"Prix de la Critique Théâtre et Danse\". The jury report stated: \"This is not a performance, but a flagellation. [...] This is all the brave, reckless genius of Milo Rau, who never curbs the candour of the young actors but slips in powerful metaphors.\"\n\nAfterwards, a series of prizes followed outside of Belgium. At the Theatertreffen festival in Berlin in May 2017, Milo Rau was awarded the 3sat prize for the production. The jury praised the director for his trendsetting and artistic-innovative work. The jury report stated: \"Rau does not make the monstrous bearable, but he makes it narrative, and asks fundamental questions about violence between minors and adults. In this way, 'Five Easy Pieces' celebrates what the Dutrouxs of this world want to destroy: childlike wisdom, childlike will and childlike pride.\" The German-speaking theatre magazine Theater Heute awarded the production with both the best production prize in 2017 and the prize for the best dramaturgy in 2017. At the MESS festival in Sarajevo in October 2017, \"Five Easy Pieces\" received four prizes: the Grand Prix – Golden Laurel Wreath for Best Performance, the Golden Laurel Wreath for Best Director, the Audience Award for Best Performance and the MESS Critics Award. A couple of months later, in December 2017, the production received the Premio Ubu 2017 for the best foreign show in Italy.\n\n"}

{"id": "65886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65886", "title": "Microphone", "text": "Microphone\n\nA microphone, colloquially nicknamed mic or mike (), is a transducer that converts sound into an electrical signal.\n\nMicrophones are used in many applications such as telephones, hearing aids, public address systems for concert halls and public events, motion picture production, live and recorded audio engineering, sound recording, two-way radios, megaphones, radio and television broadcasting, and in computers for recording voice, speech recognition, VoIP, and for non-acoustic purposes such as ultrasonic sensors or knock sensors.\n\nSeveral different types of microphone are in use, which employ different methods to convert the air pressure variations of a sound wave to an electrical signal. The most common are the dynamic microphone, which uses a coil of wire suspended in a magnetic field; the condenser microphone, which uses the vibrating diaphragm as a capacitor plate, and the piezoelectric microphone, which uses a crystal of piezoelectric material. Microphones typically need to be connected to a preamplifier before the signal can be recorded or reproduced.\n\nIn order to speak to larger groups of people, a need arose to increase the volume of the human voice. The earliest devices used to achieve this were acoustic megaphones. Some of the first examples, from fifth century BC Greece, were theater masks with horn-shaped mouth openings that acoustically amplified the voice of actors in amphitheatres. In 1665, the English physicist Robert Hooke was the first to experiment with a medium other than air with the invention of the \"lovers' telephone\" made of stretched wire with a cup attached at each end.\n\nGerman inventor Johann Philipp Reis designed an early sound transmitter that used a metallic strip attached to a vibrating membrane that would produce intermittent current. Better results were achieved with the \"liquid transmitter\" design in Scottish-American Alexander Graham Bell's telephone of 1876 – the diaphragm was attached to a conductive rod in an acid solution. These systems, however, gave a very poor sound quality.\nThe first microphone that enabled proper voice telephony was the (loose-contact) carbon microphone. This was independently developed by David Edward Hughes in England and Emile Berliner and Thomas Edison in the US. Although Edison was awarded the first patent (after a long legal dispute) in mid-1877, Hughes had demonstrated his working device in front of many witnesses some years earlier, and most historians credit him with its invention. The carbon microphone is the direct prototype of today's microphones and was critical in the development of telephony, broadcasting and the recording industries. Thomas Edison refined the carbon microphone into his carbon-button transmitter of 1886. This microphone was employed at the first ever radio broadcast, a performance at the New York Metropolitan Opera House in 1910.\nIn 1916, E.C. Wente of Western Electric developed the next breakthrough with the first condenser microphone. In 1923, the first practical moving coil microphone was built. The Marconi-Sykes magnetophone, developed by Captain H. J. Round, became the standard for BBC studios in London. This was improved in 1930 by Alan Blumlein and Herbert Holman who released the HB1A and was the best standard of the day.\n\nAlso in 1923, the ribbon microphone was introduced, another electromagnetic type, believed to have been developed by Harry F. Olson, who essentially reverse-engineered a ribbon speaker. Over the years these microphones were developed by several companies, most notably RCA that made large advancements in pattern control, to give the microphone directionality. With television and film technology booming there was demand for high fidelity microphones and greater directionality. Electro-Voice responded with their Academy Award-winning shotgun microphone in 1963.\nDuring the second half of 20th century development advanced quickly with the Shure Brothers bringing out the SM58 and SM57. The latest research developments include the use of fibre optics, lasers and interferometers.\n\nThe sensitive transducer element of a microphone is called its \"element\" or \"capsule.\" Sound is first converted to mechanical motion by means of a diaphragm, the motion of which is then converted to an electrical signal. A complete microphone also includes a housing, some means of bringing the signal from the element to other equipment, and often an electronic circuit to adapt the output of the capsule to the equipment being driven. A wireless microphone contains a radio transmitter.\n\nMicrophones are categorized by their transducer principle, such as condenser, dynamic, etc., and by their directional characteristics. Sometimes other characteristics such as diaphragm size, intended use or orientation of the principal sound input to the principal axis (end- or side-address) of the microphone are used to describe the microphone.\n\nThe condenser microphone, invented at Western Electric in 1916 by E. C. Wente, is also called a capacitor microphone or electrostatic microphone—capacitors were historically called condensers. Here, the diaphragm acts as one plate of a capacitor, and the vibrations produce changes in the distance between the plates. There are two types, depending on the method of extracting the audio signal from the transducer: DC-biased microphones, and radio frequency (RF) or high frequency (HF) condenser microphones. With a DC-biased microphone, the plates are biased with a fixed charge (\"Q\"). The voltage maintained across the capacitor plates changes with the vibrations in the air, according to the capacitance equation (C = ), where Q = charge in coulombs, C = capacitance in farads and V = potential difference in volts. The capacitance of the plates is inversely proportional to the distance between them for a parallel-plate capacitor. The assembly of fixed and movable plates is called an \"element\" or \"capsule\".\n\nA nearly constant charge is maintained on the capacitor. As the capacitance changes, the charge across the capacitor does change very slightly, but at audible frequencies it is sensibly constant. The capacitance of the capsule (around 5 to 100 pF) and the value of the bias resistor (100 MΩ to tens of GΩ) form a filter that is high-pass for the audio signal, and low-pass for the bias voltage. Note that the time constant of an RC circuit equals the product of the resistance and capacitance.\n\nWithin the time-frame of the capacitance change (as much as 50 ms at 20 Hz audio signal), the charge is practically constant and the voltage across the capacitor changes instantaneously to reflect the change in capacitance. The voltage across the capacitor varies above and below the bias voltage. The voltage difference between the bias and the capacitor is seen across the series resistor. The voltage across the resistor is amplified for performance or recording. In most cases, the electronics in the microphone itself contribute no voltage gain as the voltage differential is quite significant, up to several volts for high sound levels. Since this is a very high impedance circuit, only current gain is usually needed, with the voltage remaining constant.\nRF condenser microphones use a comparatively low RF voltage, generated by a low-noise oscillator. The signal from the oscillator may either be amplitude modulated by the capacitance changes produced by the sound waves moving the capsule diaphragm, or the capsule may be part of a resonant circuit that modulates the frequency of the oscillator signal. Demodulation yields a low-noise audio frequency signal with a very low source impedance. The absence of a high bias voltage permits the use of a diaphragm with looser tension, which may be used to achieve wider frequency response due to higher compliance. The RF biasing process results in a lower electrical impedance capsule, a useful by-product of which is that RF condenser microphones can be operated in damp weather conditions that could create problems in DC-biased microphones with contaminated insulating surfaces. The Sennheiser \"MKH\" series of microphones use the RF biasing technique. A covert, remotely energised application of the same physical principle was devised by Soviet Russian inventor Léon Theremin and used to bug the US Ambassador's Residence in Moscow between 1945 and 1952.\n\nCondenser microphones span the range from telephone transmitters through inexpensive karaoke microphones to high-fidelity recording microphones. They generally produce a high-quality audio signal and are now the popular choice in laboratory and recording studio applications. The inherent suitability of this technology is due to the very small mass that must be moved by the incident sound wave, unlike other microphone types that require the sound wave to do more work. They require a power source, provided either via microphone inputs on equipment as phantom power or from a small battery. Power is necessary for establishing the capacitor plate voltage and is also needed to power the microphone electronics (impedance conversion in the case of electret and DC-polarized microphones, demodulation or detection in the case of RF/HF microphones). Condenser microphones are also available with two diaphragms that can be electrically connected to provide a range of polar patterns (see below), such as cardioid, omnidirectional, and figure-eight. It is also possible to vary the pattern continuously with some microphones, for example, the Røde NT2000 or CAD M179.\n\nA valve microphone is a condenser microphone that uses a vacuum tube (valve) amplifier. They remain popular with enthusiasts of tube sound.\n\nAn electret microphone is a type of capacitor microphone invented by Gerhard Sessler and Jim West at Bell laboratories in 1962.\nThe externally applied charge described above under condenser microphones is replaced by a permanent charge in an electret material. An electret is a ferroelectric material that has been permanently electrically charged or \"polarized\". The name comes from \"electr\"ostatic and magn\"et\"; a static charge is embedded in an electret by alignment of the static charges in the material, much the way a magnet is made by aligning the magnetic domains in a piece of iron.\n\nDue to their good performance and ease of manufacture, hence low cost, the vast majority of microphones made today are electret microphones; a semiconductor manufacturer estimates annual production at over one billion units. Nearly all cell-phone, computer, PDA and headset microphones are electret types. They are used in many applications, from high-quality recording and lavalier use to built-in microphones in small sound recording devices and telephones. Though electret microphones were once considered low quality, the best ones can now rival traditional condenser microphones in every respect and can even offer the long-term stability and ultra-flat response needed for a measurement microphone. Unlike other capacitor microphones, they require no polarizing voltage, but often contain an integrated preamplifier that does require power (often incorrectly called polarizing power or bias). This preamplifier is frequently phantom powered in sound reinforcement and studio applications. Monophonic microphones designed for personal computer (PC) use, sometimes called multimedia microphones, use a 3.5 mm plug as usually used, without power, for stereo; the ring, instead of carrying the signal for a second channel, carries power via a resistor from (normally) a 5 V supply in the computer. Stereophonic microphones use the same connector; there is no obvious way to determine which standard is used by equipment and microphones.\n\nOnly the best electret microphones rival good DC-polarized units in terms of noise level and quality; electret microphones lend themselves to inexpensive mass-production, while inherently expensive non-electret condenser microphones are made to higher quality.\n\nThe dynamic microphone (also known as the moving-coil microphone) works via electromagnetic induction. They are robust, relatively inexpensive and resistant to moisture. This, coupled with their potentially high gain before feedback, makes them ideal for on-stage use.\n\nDynamic microphones use the same dynamic principle as in a loudspeaker, only reversed. A small movable induction coil, positioned in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet, is attached to the diaphragm. When sound enters through the windscreen of the microphone, the sound wave moves the diaphragm. When the diaphragm vibrates, the coil moves in the magnetic field, producing a varying current in the coil through electromagnetic induction. A single dynamic membrane does not respond linearly to all audio frequencies. For this reason, some microphones utilize multiple membranes for the different parts of the audio spectrum and then combine the resulting signals. Combining the multiple signals correctly is difficult; designs that do this are rare and tend to be expensive. On the other hand, there are several designs that are more specifically aimed towards isolated parts of the audio spectrum. The AKG D 112, for example, is designed for bass response rather than treble. In audio engineering several kinds of microphones are often used at the same time to get the best results.\n\nRibbon microphones use a thin, usually corrugated metal ribbon suspended in a magnetic field. The ribbon is electrically connected to the microphone's output, and its vibration within the magnetic field generates the electrical signal. Ribbon microphones are similar to moving coil microphones in the sense that both produce sound by means of magnetic induction. Basic ribbon microphones detect sound in a bi-directional (also called figure-eight, as in the diagram below) pattern because the ribbon is open on both sides. Also, because the ribbon has much less mass it responds to the air velocity rather than the sound pressure. Though the symmetrical front and rear pickup can be a nuisance in normal stereo recording, the high side rejection can be used to advantage by positioning a ribbon microphone horizontally, for example above cymbals, so that the rear lobe picks up sound only from the cymbals. Crossed figure 8, or Blumlein pair, stereo recording is gaining in popularity, and the figure-eight response of a ribbon microphone is ideal for that application.\n\nOther directional patterns are produced by enclosing one side of the ribbon in an acoustic trap or baffle, allowing sound to reach only one side. The classic RCA Type 77-DX microphone has several externally adjustable positions of the internal baffle, allowing the selection of several response patterns ranging from \"figure-eight\" to \"unidirectional\". Such older ribbon microphones, some of which still provide high-quality sound reproduction, were once valued for this reason, but a good low-frequency response could be obtained only when the ribbon was suspended very loosely, which made them relatively fragile. Modern ribbon materials, including new nanomaterials, have now been introduced that eliminate those concerns and even improve the effective dynamic range of ribbon microphones at low frequencies. Protective wind screens can reduce the danger of damaging a vintage ribbon, and also reduce plosive artifacts in the recording. Properly designed wind screens produce negligible treble attenuation. In common with other classes of dynamic microphone, ribbon microphones don't require phantom power; in fact, this voltage can damage some older ribbon microphones. Some new modern ribbon microphone designs incorporate a preamplifier and, therefore, do require phantom power, and circuits of modern passive ribbon microphones, \"i.e.\", those without the aforementioned preamplifier, are specifically designed to resist damage to the ribbon and transformer by phantom power. Also there are new ribbon materials available that are immune to wind blasts and phantom power.\n\nThe carbon microphone was the earliest type of microphone. The carbon button microphone (or sometimes just a button microphone), uses a capsule or button containing carbon granules pressed between two metal plates like the Berliner and Edison microphones. A voltage is applied across the metal plates, causing a small current to flow through the carbon. One of the plates, the diaphragm, vibrates in sympathy with incident sound waves, applying a varying pressure to the carbon. The changing pressure deforms the granules, causing the contact area between each pair of adjacent granules to change, and this causes the electrical resistance of the mass of granules to change. The changes in resistance cause a corresponding change in the current flowing through the microphone, producing the electrical signal. Carbon microphones were once commonly used in telephones; they have extremely low-quality sound reproduction and a very limited frequency response range, but are very robust devices. The Boudet microphone, which used relatively large carbon balls, was similar to the granule carbon button microphones.\n\nUnlike other microphone types, the carbon microphone can also be used as a type of amplifier, using a small amount of sound energy to control a larger amount of electrical energy. Carbon microphones found use as early telephone repeaters, making long distance phone calls possible in the era before vacuum tubes. These repeaters worked by mechanically coupling a magnetic telephone receiver to a carbon microphone: the faint signal from the receiver was transferred to the microphone, where it modulated a stronger electric current, producing a stronger electrical signal to send down the line. One illustration of this amplifier effect was the oscillation caused by feedback, resulting in an audible squeal from the old \"candlestick\" telephone if its earphone was placed near the carbon microphone.\n\nA crystal microphone or piezo microphone uses the phenomenon of piezoelectricity—the ability of some materials to produce a voltage when subjected to pressure—to convert vibrations into an electrical signal. An example of this is potassium sodium tartrate, which is a piezoelectric crystal that works as a transducer, both as a microphone and as a slimline loudspeaker component. Crystal microphones were once commonly supplied with vacuum tube (valve) equipment, such as domestic tape recorders. Their high output impedance matched the high input impedance (typically about 10 megohms) of the vacuum tube input stage well. They were difficult to match to early transistor equipment and were quickly supplanted by dynamic microphones for a time, and later small electret condenser devices. The high impedance of the crystal microphone made it very susceptible to handling noise, both from the microphone itself and from the connecting cable.\n\nPiezoelectric transducers are often used as contact microphones to amplify sound from acoustic musical instruments, to sense drum hits, for triggering electronic samples, and to record sound in challenging environments, such as underwater under high pressure. Saddle-mounted pickups on acoustic guitars are generally piezoelectric devices that contact the strings passing over the saddle. This type of microphone is different from magnetic coil pickups commonly visible on typical electric guitars, which use magnetic induction, rather than mechanical coupling, to pick up vibration.\n\nA fiber optic microphone converts acoustic waves into electrical signals by sensing changes in light intensity, instead of sensing changes in capacitance or magnetic fields as with conventional microphones.\nDuring operation, light from a laser source travels through an optical fiber to illuminate the surface of a reflective diaphragm. Sound vibrations of the diaphragm modulate the intensity of light reflecting off the diaphragm in a specific direction. The modulated light is then transmitted over a second optical fiber to a photo detector, which transforms the intensity-modulated light into analog or digital audio for transmission or recording. Fiber optic microphones possess high dynamic and frequency range, similar to the best high fidelity conventional microphones.\n\nFiber optic microphones do not react to or influence any electrical, magnetic, electrostatic or radioactive fields (this is called EMI/RFI immunity). The fiber optic microphone design is therefore ideal for use in areas where conventional microphones are ineffective or dangerous, such as inside industrial turbines or in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipment environments.\n\nFiber optic microphones are robust, resistant to environmental changes in heat and moisture, and can be produced for any directionality or impedance matching. The distance between the microphone's light source and its photodetector may be up to several kilometers without need for any preamplifier or another electrical device, making fiber optic microphones suitable for industrial and surveillance acoustic monitoring.\n\nFiber optic microphones are used in very specific application areas such as for infrasound monitoring and noise-canceling. They have proven especially useful in medical applications, such as allowing radiologists, staff and patients within the powerful and noisy magnetic field to converse normally, inside the MRI suites as well as in remote control rooms. Other uses include industrial equipment monitoring and audio calibration and measurement, high-fidelity recording and law enforcement.\n\nLaser microphones are often portrayed in movies as spy gadgets, because they can be used to pick up sound at a distance from the microphone equipment. A laser beam is aimed at the surface of a window or other plane surface that is affected by sound. The vibrations of this surface change the angle at which the beam is reflected, and the motion of the laser spot from the returning beam is detected and converted to an audio signal.\n\nIn a more robust and expensive implementation, the returned light is split and fed to an interferometer, which detects movement of the surface by changes in the optical path length of the reflected beam. The former implementation is a tabletop experiment; the latter requires an extremely stable laser and precise optics.\n\nA new type of laser microphone is a device that uses a laser beam and smoke or vapor to detect sound vibrations in free air. On 25 August 2009, U.S. patent 7,580,533 issued for a Particulate Flow Detection Microphone based on a laser-photocell pair with a moving stream of smoke or vapor in the laser beam's path. Sound pressure waves cause disturbances in the smoke that in turn cause variations in the amount of laser light reaching the photodetector. A prototype of the device was demonstrated at the 127th Audio Engineering Society convention in New York City from 9 through 12 October 2009.\n\nEarly microphones did not produce intelligible speech, until Alexander Graham Bell made improvements including a variable-resistance microphone/transmitter. Bell's liquid transmitter consisted of a metal cup filled with water with a small amount of sulfuric acid added. A sound wave caused the diaphragm to move, forcing a needle to move up and down in the water. The electrical resistance between the wire and the cup was then inversely proportional to the size of the water meniscus around the submerged needle. Elisha Gray filed a caveat for a version using a brass rod instead of the needle. Other minor variations and improvements were made to the liquid microphone by Majoranna, Chambers, Vanni, Sykes, and Elisha Gray, and one version was patented by Reginald Fessenden in 1903. These were the first working microphones, but they were not practical for commercial application. The famous first phone conversation between Bell and Watson took place using a liquid microphone.\n\nThe MEMS (MicroElectrical-Mechanical System) microphone is also called a microphone chip or silicon microphone. A pressure-sensitive diaphragm is etched directly into a silicon wafer by MEMS processing techniques, and is usually accompanied with integrated preamplifier. Most MEMS microphones are variants of the condenser microphone design. Digital MEMS microphones have built in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) circuits on the same CMOS chip making the chip a digital microphone and so more readily integrated with modern digital products. Major manufacturers producing MEMS silicon microphones are Wolfson Microelectronics (WM7xxx) now Cirrus Logic, InvenSense (product line sold by Analog Devices ), Akustica (AKU200x), Infineon (SMM310 product), Knowles Electronics, Memstech (MSMx), NXP Semiconductors (division bought by Knowles ), Sonion MEMS, Vesper, AAC Acoustic Technologies, and Omron.\n\nMore recently, since the 2010s, there has been increased interest and research into making piezoelectric MEMS microphones which are a significant architectural and material change from existing condenser style MEMS designs.\n\nA loudspeaker, a transducer that turns an electrical signal into sound waves, is the functional opposite of a microphone. Since a conventional speaker is constructed much like a dynamic microphone (with a diaphragm, coil and magnet), speakers can actually work \"in reverse\" as microphones. The resulting signal typically offers reduced quality including limited high-end frequency response and poor sensitivity. In practical use, speakers are sometimes used as microphones in applications where high quality and sensitivity are not needed such as intercoms, walkie-talkies or video game voice chat peripherals, or when conventional microphones are in short supply.\n\nHowever, there is at least one practical application that exploits those weaknesses: the use of a medium-size woofer placed closely in front of a \"kick drum\" (bass drum) in a drum set to act as a microphone. A commercial product example is the Yamaha Subkick, a woofer shock-mounted into a 10\" drum shell used in front of kick drums. Since a relatively massive membrane is unable to transduce high frequencies while being capable of tolerating strong low-frequency transients, the speaker is often ideal for picking up the kick drum while reducing bleed from the nearby cymbals and snare drums. \n\nLess commonly, microphones themselves can be used as speakers, but due to their low power handling and small transducer sizes, a tweeter is the most practical application. One instance of such an application was the STC microphone-derived 4001 super-tweeter, which was successfully used in a number of high quality loudspeaker systems from the late 1960s to the mid-70s.\n\nThe inner elements of a microphone are the primary source of differences in directivity. A pressure microphone uses a diaphragm between a fixed internal volume of air and the environment, and responds uniformly to pressure from all directions, so it is said to be omnidirectional. A pressure-gradient microphone uses a diaphragm that is at least partially open on both sides. The pressure difference between the two sides produces its directional characteristics. Other elements such as the external shape of the microphone and external devices such as interference tubes can also alter a microphone's directional response. A pure pressure-gradient microphone is equally sensitive to sounds arriving from front or back, but insensitive to sounds arriving from the side because sound arriving at the front and back at the same time creates no gradient between the two. The characteristic directional pattern of a pure pressure-gradient microphone is like a figure-8. Other polar patterns are derived by creating a capsule that combines these two effects in different ways. The cardioid, for instance, features a partially closed backside, so its response is a combination of pressure and pressure-gradient characteristics.\n\n(Microphone facing top of page in diagram, parallel to page):\nA microphone's directionality or polar pattern indicates how sensitive it is to sounds arriving at different angles about its central axis. The polar patterns illustrated above represent the locus of points that produce the same signal level output in the microphone if a given sound pressure level (SPL) is generated from that point. How the physical body of the microphone is oriented relative to the diagrams depends on the microphone design. For large-membrane microphones such as in the Oktava (pictured above), the upward direction in the polar diagram is usually perpendicular to the microphone body, commonly known as \"side fire\" or \"side address\". For small diaphragm microphones such as the Shure (also pictured above), it usually extends from the axis of the microphone commonly known as \"end fire\" or \"top/end address\".\n\nSome microphone designs combine several principles in creating the desired polar pattern. This ranges from shielding (meaning diffraction/dissipation/absorption) by the housing itself to electronically combining dual membranes.\n\nAn omnidirectional (or nondirectional) microphone's response is generally considered to be a perfect sphere in three dimensions. In the real world, this is not the case. As with directional microphones, the polar pattern for an \"omnidirectional\" microphone is a function of frequency. The body of the microphone is not infinitely small and, as a consequence, it tends to get in its own way with respect to sounds arriving from the rear, causing a slight flattening of the polar response. This flattening increases as the diameter of the microphone (assuming it's cylindrical) reaches the wavelength of the frequency in question. Therefore, the smallest diameter microphone gives the best omnidirectional characteristics at high frequencies.\n\nThe wavelength of sound at 10 kHz is 1.4\" (3.5 cm). The smallest measuring microphones are often 1/4\" (6 mm) in diameter, which practically eliminates directionality even up to the highest frequencies. Omnidirectional microphones, unlike cardioids, do not employ resonant cavities as delays, and so can be considered the \"purest\" microphones in terms of low coloration; they add very little to the original sound. Being pressure-sensitive they can also have a very flat low-frequency response down to 20 Hz or below. Pressure-sensitive microphones also respond much less to wind noise and plosives than directional (velocity sensitive) microphones.\n\nAn example of a nondirectional microphone is the round black \"eight ball\".\n\nA unidirectional microphone is primarily sensitive to sounds from only one direction. The diagram above illustrates a number of these patterns. The microphone faces upwards in each diagram. The sound intensity for a particular frequency is plotted for angles radially from 0 to 360°. (Professional diagrams show these scales and include multiple plots at different frequencies. The diagrams given here provide only an overview of typical pattern shapes, and their names.)\n\nThe most common unidirectional microphone is a cardioid microphone, so named because the sensitivity pattern is \"heart-shaped\", i.e. a cardioid. The cardioid family of microphones are commonly used as vocal or speech microphones, since they are good at rejecting sounds from other directions. In three dimensions, the cardioid is shaped like an apple centred around the microphone, which is the \"stem\" of the apple. The cardioid response reduces pickup from the side and rear, helping to avoid feedback from the monitors. Since these directional transducer microphones achieve their patterns by sensing pressure gradient, putting them very close to the sound source (at distances of a few centimeters) results in a bass boost due to the increased gradient. This is known as the proximity effect. The SM58 has been the most commonly used microphone for live vocals for more than 50 years demonstrating the importance and popularity of cardioid mics.\n\nThe cardioid is effectively a superposition of an omnidirectional (pressure) and a figure-8 (pressure gradient) microphone; for sound waves coming from the back, the negative signal from the figure-8 cancels the positive signal from the omnidirectional element, whereas for sound waves coming from the front, the two add to each other.\n\nBy combining the two components in different ratios, any pattern between omni and figure-8 can be achieved, which comprise the first-order cardioid family. Common shapes include:\n\n\n\"Figure 8\" or bi-directional microphones receive sound equally from both the front and back of the element. Most ribbon microphones are of this pattern. In principle they do not respond to sound pressure at all, only to the \"change\" in pressure between front and back; since sound arriving from the side reaches front and back equally there is no difference in pressure and therefore no sensitivity to sound from that direction. In more mathematical terms, while omnidirectional microphones are scalar transducers responding to pressure from any direction, bi-directional microphones are vector transducers responding to the gradient along an axis normal to the plane of the diaphragm. This also has the effect of inverting the output polarity for sounds arriving from the back side.\n\nShotgun microphones are the most highly directional of simple first-order unidirectional types. At low frequencies they have the classic polar response of a hypercardioid but at medium and higher frequencies an interference tube gives them an increased forward response. This is achieved by a process of cancellation of off-axis waves entering the longitudinal array of slots. A consequence of this technique is the presence of some rear lobes that vary in level and angle with frequency, and can cause some coloration effects. Due to the narrowness of their forward sensitivity, shotgun microphones are commonly used on television and film sets, in stadiums, and for field recording of wildlife.\n\nSeveral approaches have been developed for effectively using a microphone in less-than-ideal acoustic spaces, which often suffer from excessive reflections from one or more of the surfaces (boundaries) that make up the space. If the microphone is placed in, or very close to, one of these boundaries, the reflections from that surface have the same timing as the direct sound, thus giving the microphone a hemispherical polar pattern and improved intelligibility. Initially this was done by placing an ordinary microphone adjacent to the surface, sometimes in a block of acoustically transparent foam. Sound engineers Ed Long and Ron Wickersham developed the concept of placing the diaphragm parallel to and facing the boundary. While the patent has expired, \"Pressure Zone Microphone\" and \"PZM\" are still active trademarks of Crown International, and the generic term boundary microphone is preferred. While a boundary microphone was initially implemented using an omnidirectional element, it is also possible to mount a directional microphone close enough to the surface to gain some of the benefits of this technique while retaining the directional properties of the element. Crown's trademark on this approach is \"Phase Coherent Cardioid\" or \"PCC,\" but there are other makers who employ this technique as well.\n\nA lavalier microphone is made for hands-free operation. These small microphones are worn on the body. Originally, they were held in place with a lanyard worn around the neck, but more often they are fastened to clothing with a clip, pin, tape or magnet. The lavalier cord may be hidden by clothes and either run to an RF transmitter in a pocket or clipped to a belt (for mobile use), or run directly to the mixer (for stationary applications).\n\nA wireless microphone transmits the audio as a radio or optical signal rather than via a cable. It usually sends its signal using a small FM radio transmitter to a nearby receiver connected to the sound system, but it can also use infrared waves if the transmitter and receiver are within sight of each other.\n\nA contact microphone picks up vibrations directly from a solid surface or object, as opposed to sound vibrations carried through air. One use for this is to detect sounds of a very low level, such as those from small objects or insects. The microphone commonly consists of a magnetic (moving coil) transducer, contact plate and contact pin. The contact plate is placed directly on the vibrating part of a musical instrument or other surface, and the contact pin transfers vibrations to the coil. Contact microphones have been used to pick up the sound of a snail's heartbeat and the footsteps of ants. A portable version of this microphone has recently been developed. A throat microphone is a variant of the contact microphone that picks up speech directly from a person's throat, which it is strapped to. This lets the device be used in areas with ambient sounds that would otherwise make the speaker inaudible.\n\nA parabolic microphone uses a parabolic reflector to collect and focus sound waves onto a microphone receiver, in much the same way that a parabolic antenna (e.g. satellite dish) does with radio waves. Typical uses of this microphone, which has unusually focused front sensitivity and can pick up sounds from many meters away, include nature recording, outdoor sporting events, eavesdropping, law enforcement, and even espionage. Parabolic microphones are not typically used for standard recording applications, because they tend to have poor low-frequency response as a side effect of their design.\n\nA stereo microphone integrates two microphones in one unit to produce a stereophonic signal. A stereo microphone is often used for broadcast applications or field recording where it would be impractical to configure two separate condenser microphones in a classic X-Y configuration (see microphone practice) for stereophonic recording. Some such microphones have an adjustable angle of coverage between the two channels.\n\nA noise-canceling microphone is a highly directional design intended for noisy environments. One such use is in aircraft cockpits where they are normally installed as boom microphones on headsets. Another use is in live event support on loud concert stages for vocalists involved with live performances. Many noise-canceling microphones combine signals received from two diaphragms that are in opposite electrical polarity or are processed electronically. In dual diaphragm designs, the main diaphragm is mounted closest to the intended source and the second is positioned farther away from the source so that it can pick up environmental sounds to be subtracted from the main diaphragm's signal. After the two signals have been combined, sounds other than the intended source are greatly reduced, substantially increasing intelligibility. Other noise-canceling designs use one diaphragm that is affected by ports open to the sides and rear of the microphone, with the sum being a 16 dB rejection of sounds that are farther away. One noise-canceling headset design using a single diaphragm has been used prominently by vocal artists such as Garth Brooks and Janet Jackson. A few noise-canceling microphones are throat microphones.\n\nVarious standard techniques are used with microphones used in sound reinforcement at live performances, or for recording in a studio or on a motion picture set. By suitable arrangement of one or more microphones, desirable features of the sound to be collected can be kept, while rejecting unwanted sounds.\n\nMicrophones containing active circuitry, such as most condenser microphones, require power to operate the active components. The first of these used vacuum-tube circuits with a separate power supply unit, using a multi-pin cable and connector. With the advent of solid-state amplification, the power requirements were greatly reduced and it became practical to use the same cable conductors and connector for audio and power. During the 1960s several powering methods were developed, mainly in Europe. The two dominant methods were initially defined in German DIN 45595 as or T-power and DIN 45596 for phantom power. Since the 1980s, phantom power has become much more common, because the same input may be used for both powered and unpowered microphones. In consumer electronics such as DSLRs and camcorders, \"plug-in power\" is more common, for microphones using a 3.5 mm phone plug connector. Phantom, T-power and plug-in power are described in international standard IEC 61938.\n\nThe most common connectors used by microphones are:\n\nSome microphones use other connectors, such as a 5-pin XLR, or mini XLR for connection to portable equipment. Some lavalier (or \"lapel\", from the days of attaching the microphone to the news reporters suit lapel) microphones use a proprietary connector for connection to a wireless transmitter, such as a radio pack. Since 2005, professional-quality microphones with USB connections have begun to appear, designed for direct recording into computer-based software.\n\nMicrophones have an electrical characteristic called impedance, measured in ohms (Ω), that depends on the design. In passive microphones, this value describes the electrical resistance of the magnet coil (or similar mechanism). In active microphones, this value describes the output resistance of the amplifier circuitry. Typically, the \"rated impedance\" is stated. Low impedance is considered under 600 Ω. Medium impedance is considered between 600 Ω and 10 kΩ. High impedance is above 10 kΩ. Owing to their built-in amplifier, condenser microphones typically have an output impedance between 50 and 200 Ω.\n\nThe output of a given microphone delivers the same power whether it is low or high impedance. If a microphone is made in high and low impedance versions, the high impedance version has a higher output voltage for a given sound pressure input, and is suitable for use with vacuum-tube guitar amplifiers, for instance, which have a high input impedance and require a relatively high signal input voltage to overcome the tubes' inherent noise. Most professional microphones are low impedance, about 200 Ω or lower. Professional vacuum-tube sound equipment incorporates a transformer that steps up the impedance of the microphone circuit to the high impedance and voltage needed to drive the input tube. External matching transformers are also available that can be used in-line between a low impedance microphone and a high impedance input.\n\nLow-impedance microphones are preferred over high impedance for two reasons: one is that using a high-impedance microphone with a long cable results in high frequency signal loss due to cable capacitance, which forms a low-pass filter with the microphone output impedance. The other is that long high-impedance cables tend to pick up more hum (and possibly radio-frequency interference (RFI) as well). Nothing is damaged if the impedance between microphone and other equipment is mismatched; the worst that happens is a reduction in signal or change in frequency response.\n\nSome microphones are designed \"not\" to have their impedance matched by the load they are connected to. Doing so can alter their frequency response and cause distortion, especially at high sound pressure levels. Certain ribbon and dynamic microphones are exceptions, due to the designers' assumption of a certain load impedance being part of the internal electro-acoustical damping circuit of the microphone.\n\nThe AES42 standard, published by the Audio Engineering Society, defines a digital interface for microphones. Microphones conforming to this standard directly output a digital audio stream through an XLR or XLD male connector, rather than producing an analog output. Digital microphones may be used either with new equipment with appropriate input connections that conform to the AES42 standard, or else via a suitable interface box. Studio-quality microphones that operate in accordance with the AES42 standard are now available from a number of microphone manufacturers.\n\nBecause of differences in their construction, microphones have their own characteristic responses to sound. This difference in response produces non-uniform phase and frequency responses. In addition, microphones are not uniformly sensitive to sound pressure, and can accept differing levels without distorting. Although for scientific applications microphones with a more uniform response are desirable, this is often not the case for music recording, as the non-uniform response of a microphone can produce a desirable coloration of the sound. There is an international standard for microphone specifications, but few manufacturers adhere to it. As a result, comparison of published data from different manufacturers is difficult because different measurement techniques are used. The Microphone Data Website has collated the technical specifications complete with pictures, response curves and technical data from the microphone manufacturers for every currently listed microphone, and even a few obsolete models, and shows the data for them all in one common format for ease of comparison.. Caution should be used in drawing any solid conclusions from this or any other published data, however, unless it is known that the manufacturer has supplied specifications in accordance with IEC 60268-4.\n\nA frequency response diagram plots the microphone sensitivity in decibels over a range of frequencies (typically 20 Hz to 20 kHz), generally for perfectly on-axis sound (sound arriving at 0° to the capsule). Frequency response may be less informatively stated textually like so: \"30 Hz–16 kHz ±3 dB\". This is interpreted as meaning a nearly flat, linear, plot between the stated frequencies, with variations in amplitude of no more than plus or minus 3 dB. However, one cannot determine from this information how \"smooth\" the variations are, nor in what parts of the spectrum they occur. Note that commonly made statements such as \"20 Hz–20 kHz\" are meaningless without a decibel measure of tolerance. Directional microphones' frequency response varies greatly with distance from the sound source, and with the geometry of the sound source. IEC 60268-4 specifies that frequency response should be measured in \"plane progressive wave\" conditions (very far away from the source) but this is seldom practical. \"Close talking\" microphones may be measured with different sound sources and distances, but there is no standard and therefore no way to compare data from different models unless the measurement technique is described.\n\nThe self-noise or equivalent input noise level is the sound level that creates the same output voltage as the microphone does in the absence of sound. This represents the lowest point of the microphone's dynamic range, and is particularly important should you wish to record sounds that are quiet. The measure is often stated in dB(A), which is the equivalent loudness of the noise on a decibel scale frequency-weighted for how the ear hears, for example: \"15 dBA SPL\" (SPL means sound pressure level relative to 20 micropascals). The lower the number the better. Some microphone manufacturers state the noise level using ITU-R 468 noise weighting, which more accurately represents the way we hear noise, but gives a figure some 11–14 dB higher. A quiet microphone typically measures 20 dBA SPL or 32 dB SPL 468-weighted. Very quiet microphones have existed for years for special applications, such the Brüel & Kjaer 4179, with a noise level around 0 dB SPL. Recently some microphones with low noise specifications have been introduced in the studio/entertainment market, such as models from Neumann and Røde that advertise noise levels between 5–7 dBA. Typically this is achieved by altering the frequency response of the capsule and electronics to result in lower noise within the A-weighting curve while broadband noise may be increased.\n\nThe maximum SPL the microphone can accept is measured for particular values of total harmonic distortion (THD), typically 0.5%. This amount of distortion is generally inaudible, so one can safely use the microphone at this SPL without harming the recording. Example: \"142 dB SPL peak (at 0.5% THD)\". The higher the value, the better, although microphones with a very high maximum SPL also have a higher self-noise.\n\nThe clipping level is an important indicator of maximum usable level, as the 1% THD figure usually quoted under max SPL is really a very mild level of distortion, quite inaudible especially on brief high peaks. Clipping is much more audible. For some microphones the clipping level may be much higher than the max SPL.\n\nThe dynamic range of a microphone is the difference in SPL between the noise floor and the maximum SPL. If stated on its own, for example \"120 dB\", it conveys significantly less information than having the self-noise and maximum SPL figures individually.\n\nSensitivity indicates how well the microphone converts acoustic pressure to output voltage. A high sensitivity microphone creates more voltage and so needs less amplification at the mixer or recording device. This is a practical concern but is not directly an indication of the microphone's quality, and in fact the term sensitivity is something of a misnomer, \"transduction gain\" being perhaps more meaningful, (or just \"output level\") because true sensitivity is generally set by the noise floor, and too much \"sensitivity\" in terms of output level compromises the clipping level. There are two common measures. The (preferred) international standard is made in millivolts per pascal at 1 kHz. A higher value indicates greater sensitivity. The older American method is referred to a 1 V/Pa standard and measured in plain decibels, resulting in a negative value. Again, a higher value indicates greater sensitivity, so −60  dB is more sensitive than −70 dB.\n\nSome microphones are intended for testing speakers, measuring noise levels and otherwise quantifying an acoustic experience. These are calibrated transducers and are usually supplied with a calibration certificate that states absolute sensitivity against frequency. The quality of measurement microphones is often referred to using the designations \"Class 1,\" \"Type 2\" etc., which are references not to microphone specifications but to sound level meters. A more comprehensive standard for the description of measurement microphone performance was recently adopted.\n\nMeasurement microphones are generally scalar sensors of pressure; they exhibit an omnidirectional response, limited only by the scattering profile of their physical dimensions. Sound intensity or sound power measurements require pressure-gradient measurements, which are typically made using arrays of at least two microphones, or with hot-wire anemometers.\n\nTo take a scientific measurement with a microphone, its precise sensitivity must be known (in volts per pascal). Since this may change over the lifetime of the device, it is necessary to regularly calibrate measurement microphones. This service is offered by some microphone manufacturers and by independent certified testing labs. All microphone calibration is ultimately traceable to primary standards at a national measurement institute such as NPL in the UK, PTB in Germany and NIST in the United States, which most commonly calibrate using the reciprocity primary standard. Measurement microphones calibrated using this method can then be used to calibrate other microphones using comparison calibration techniques.\n\nDepending on the application, measurement microphones must be tested periodically (every year or several months, typically) and after any potentially damaging event, such as being dropped (most such microphones come in foam-padded cases to reduce this risk) or exposed to sounds beyond the acceptable level.\n\nA microphone array is any number of microphones operating in tandem. There are many applications:\n\n\nTypically, an array is made up of omnidirectional microphones distributed about the perimeter of a space, linked to a computer that records and interprets the results into a coherent form.\n\nWindscreens (or windshields – the terms are interchangeable) provide a method of reducing the effect of wind on microphones. While pop-screens give protection from unidirectional blasts, foam “hats” shield wind into the grille from all directions, and blimps / zeppelins / baskets entirely enclose the microphone and protect its body as well. The latter is important because, given the extreme low frequency content of wind noise, vibration induced in the housing of the microphone can contribute substantially to the noise output.\n\nThe shielding material used – wire gauze, fabric or foam – is designed to have a significant acoustic impedance. The relatively low particle-velocity air pressure changes that constitute sound waves can pass through with minimal attenuation, but higher particle-velocity wind is impeded to a far greater extent. Increasing the thickness of the material improves wind attenuation but also begins to compromise high frequency audio content. This limits the practical size of simple foam screens. While foams and wire meshes can be partly or wholly self-supporting, soft fabrics and gauzes require stretching on frames, or laminating with coarser structural elements.\n\nSince all wind noise is generated at the first surface the air hits, the greater the spacing between shield periphery and microphone capsule, the greater the noise attenuation. For an approximately spherical shield, attenuation increases by (approximately) the cube of that distance. Thus larger shields are always much more efficient than smaller ones. With full basket windshields there is an additional pressure chamber effect, first explained by Joerg Wuttke, which, for two-port (pressure gradient) microphones, allows the shield/microphone combination to act as a high-pass acoustic filter.\n\nSince turbulence at a surface is the source of wind noise, reducing gross turbulence can add to noise reduction. Both aerodynamically smooth surfaces, and ones that prevent powerful vortices being generated, have been used successfully. Historically, artificial fur has proved very useful for this purpose since the fibres produce micro-turbulence and absorb energy silently. If not matted by wind and rain, the fur fibres are very transparent acoustically, but the woven or knitted backing can give significant attenuation. As a material it suffers from being difficult to manufacture with consistency, and to keep in pristine condition on location. Thus there is an interest (DPA 5100, Rycote Cyclone) to move away from its use.\n\nIn the studio and on stage, pop-screens and foam shields can be useful for reasons of hygiene, and protecting microphones from spittle and sweat. They can also be useful coloured idents. On location the basket shield can contain a suspension system to isolate the microphone from shock and handling noise.\n\nStating the efficiency of wind noise reduction is an inexact science, since the effect varies enormously with frequency, and hence with the bandwidth of the microphone and audio channel. At very low frequencies (10–100 Hz) where massive wind energy exists, reductions are important to avoid overloading of the audio chain – particularly the early stages. This can produce the typical “wumping” sound associated with wind, which is often syllabic muting of the audio due to LF peak limiting. At higher frequencies – 200 Hz to ~3 kHz – the aural sensitivity curve allows us to hear the effect of wind as an addition to the normal noise floor, even though it has a far lower energy content. Simple shields may allow the wind noise to be 10 dB less apparent; better ones can achieve nearer to a 50 dB reduction. However the acoustic transparency, particularly at HF, should also be indicated, since a very high level of wind attenuation could be associated with very muffled audio.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4008756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4008756", "title": "Tectoy", "text": "Tectoy\n\nTectoy (known as Tec Toy before late 2007) is a Brazilian toy and electronics company headquartered in São Paulo. It is best known for producing, publishing, and distributing Sega consoles and video games in Brazil. The company was founded by Daniel Dazcal, Leo Kryss, and Abe Kryss in 1987 because Dazcal saw an opportunity to develop a market for electronic toys and video games, product categories that competitors did not sell in Brazil at the time. The company stock is traded on the Bovespa. \n\nSoon after its founding, Tectoy completed a licensing agreement with Sega allowing it to market a laser gun game based on the Japanese anime \"Zillion\", which sold more units in Brazil than in Japan. Tectoy would later bring the Master System and Mega Drive to the region, as well as Sega's later video game consoles and the Sega Meganet service. Other products developed by Tectoy include educational toys such as the Pense Bem, karaoke machines, and original Master System and Mega Drive games released exclusively in Brazil, such as \"Férias Frustradas do Pica-Pau\" and Portuguese translations and alternate versions of video games. Over its history, Tectoy has diversified to include more electronic products, such as DVD and Blu-ray players and the Zeebo console. While successful at times, the company has also undergone debt restructuring in 2000 and actions to consolidate its two public stock offerings into one.\n\nTectoy is credited with the continued success of Sega consoles in Brazil far past their lifetimes worldwide. At one point, Tectoy held an 80% market share of video games in Brazil. The Master System and Mega Drive are still produced in Brazil decades after their cancellation in the rest of the world, and Tectoy's consoles continue to rival more modern systems by Microsoft and Sony in popularity.\n\nTectoy was founded in September 1987 by Daniel Dazcal, Leo Kryss, and Abe Kryss. Dazcal was previously associated with Sharp Corporation in Brazil, while the Kryss brothers were the owners of Evadin, a Brazilian TV manufacturer associated with Mitsubishi. The new startup company sought to create \"intelligent toys\" designed specifically for the Brazilian market. At the time, Brazil's most dominant toy manufacturer was Estrela, which held 55% of the market share but did not have any interest in electronics. This gave Dazcal an area to focus the new company. In order to give the company an advantage in marketing costs, Tectoy set its factory in the Free Economic Zone of Manaus to leverage tax incentives.\n\nOne of the primary goals of the founders of the company was to enter the video game market. Relying on individual previous experiences in working with Japanese companies, Tectoy executives reached out to Sega, which initially showed reluctance to partner with Tectoy given the failure of Tonka in merchandising Sega products in the United States. The company slowly built trust with Sega and was ultimately granted total liberty to manage Sega products in the Brazilian market. The first Sega product released by Tectoy was the \"Zillion\" infrared laser tag gun, based on the phaser featured in the anime of the same name. The success of \"Zillion\" led Sega to have Tectoy distribute its 8-bit video game console, the Master System, in Brazil as well. Launched officially in Brazil in September 1989, the Master System achieved success. Tectoy's revenue in 1989 was Cz$66 million, of which Cz$40 million was attributed to the console. Some of this success is attributed to the company's strong advertising investments: the launch campaign, which lasted until Christmas 1989, was at an expense of Cz$2 million. By the end of 1990, the Master System install base in Brazil was about 280,000 units. The company also introduced a telephone service with tips for games, created a Master System club, and presented the program \"Master Tips\" during commercial breaks of the television show \"Sessão Aventura\" of Rede Globo.\n\nOver a year after the launch of the Master System, Tectoy officially brought Sega's 16-bit console, the Mega Drive, to Brazil in December 1990. Sega's handheld console, Game Gear, was later released in August 1991. Like the Master System, the two products were assembled by Tectoy in Manaus, and Game Gear was the first portable console manufactured in Brazil. Sega's primary competition, Nintendo, did not officially arrive in Brazil until 1993; they entered the region through Playtronic, a partnership between Gradiente and Estrela. By the time Nintendo arrived in the region, they were unable to compete with pirated NES systems already available in the region and Tectoy's established following. Mega Drive surpassed the SNES in market share in Brazil, and Tectoy claimed 80% of the local video game market. By 1996, Tectoy had sold 2 million video game consoles and was receiving 50,000 calls a month to their video game tip line.\n\nOn May 26, 1994, Dazcal died at the age of 42. He was replaced as CEO by Stefano Arnhold, who had worked for Dazcal at Sharp and became one of Tectoy's earliest employees in December 1987. Arnhold continued Tectoy's partnership with Sega and released the Sega Saturn on August 30, 1995, at a price of R$899.99. With the increase in the number of commercial Internet users in Brazil, Tectoy also invested in content and Internet access by introducing a Brazilian version of Internet service provider CompuServe, at the time the second largest US subscriber number. São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte were the first cities to receive the service. The service officially began in April 1997 and was part of a strategy to diversify the company's interests away from being a seasonal industry.\n\nIn 1997, Tectoy saw financial losses of R$35.9 million and saw a 32% drop in revenue compared to 1996, a year in which the company also failed to meet its revenue goal. The company managed to reduce its losses in 1998, but still saw a net loss of R$10.8 million. During this period, the company launched the Dreamcast console in Brazil in September 1999 at a price of R$900. To cut costs, the Brazilian version was released without a pack-in game and a modem for Internet connection. The modem would be released months later at a price of R$49.99. As of July 2000, Dreamcast sold about 20,000 units in Brazil.\n\nBy 2000, Tectoy had debts of R$55 million. The difficulties presented by the market caused Tectoy to announce its application for debt restructuring on December 9, 1997. At the time, the reasons disclosed to the press were the drop in sales and interest in Tectoy's products. The arrangement caused a number of Tectoy businesses to be restructured. CompuServe, which had opened the previous year in Brazil, was closed on April 25, 1998. Subscribers had the option of migrating to the competitor Universo Online (UOL). At the time of the closure, Arnhold stated that although the internet market was \"promising\", the company had not reached the number of subscribers that the company was expecting. As part of the debt restructuring, Tectoy renegotiated the debt up to six years for repayment, moved its factory in Manaus to smaller facilities, simplified its production chain, and cut its number of employees from 1000 to 110. In Tectoy's offices in São Paulo, all employees were centralized to one location. Tectoy also narrowed its focus to video games and its new work on karaoke machines. The company became the first in Brazil to use compact discs as media for its karaoke devices, in contrast to the cartridge-based machines of its only domestic competitor, Raf Electronics. With these restructuring changes, Tectoy was able to reduce its annual costs to R$4 million in 2001, half of what it spent in 1997, and bankruptcy procedures closed on October 4, 2000.\nAfter the end of bankruptcy proceedings, Tectoy announced another change to its focus. The company announced its diversification from focusing solely on toys and video games into an \"entertainment company\". Tectoy intended to introduce more product lines, including DVD players, with a focus on higher profitability and less seasonality to the business. The company's video game business remained strong during this time; the year 2000 saw Tectoy make a 25% increase in sales of its Mega Drive console as compared to 1999. While a 2% sales decrease occurred in 2001 due to power rationing in Brazil, the company aimed for another 25% increase of its video game business the next year. By the year 2002, Tectoy had sold 1.2 million Mega Drives in Brazil, and aimed to produce another 100,000 units. Part of the continued success of the Mega Drive came from Tectoy's partnership with Brazilian television station SBT to release a game based on \"Show do Milhão\", a popular game show.\n\nIn May 2007, Fernando Fischer became the company's president. He promised to reverse the R$3 million loss from the previous year, and increase revenue by R$45 million. At the same time, the company began using the name \"Tectoy\" as one word instead of two, and introduced a new logo. Tectoy set forth four business areas of focus in the digital entertainment field: video games, DVDs, digital TV receivers, and toys. One of the first new products was a mobile TV digital receiver, MobTV, in December 2007. During the previous year, Tectoy entered the gaming market for mobile devices. Branded as a subsidiary called Tec Toy Mobile, the company partnered with Level Up! Games, responsible for games like the MMORPG \"Ragnarok Online\". The partnership between the two companies ended in the second half of 2010, when Tectoy sold its stake in Level Up!. Tectoy also began importing the Nabaztag, a portable rabbit-shaped electronic device that played music and accessed information over Wi-Fi. A fire occurred in the Tectoy factory in Manaus in November 2008, which temporarily paralyzed the production lines of the company. In February 2009, Tectoy launched the first Blu-ray player manufactured in Brazil. Subsequently, neither the digital TV receiver nor the Blu-ray player have been financially successful.\nTectoy announced a partnership with Qualcomm in 2008 for a new project, the Zeebo. Known by the codename \"Jeanie\", the project was originally announced as a \"digital toy\" that would talk to \"several existing technologies.\" The new digital platform was publicly released at the end of the year as a new video game console dedicated to emerging markets, with no physical media and low price to minimize piracy. Zeebo was released in Brazil on May 25, 2009, but faced competition from Sony and its PlayStation 2 console, which originally sold at R$799. In turn, the Zeebo was not well received by consumers, selling only 30,000 units rather than the company's projection of 600,000. Fischer stated that Tectoy would be operating at a profit if it had not invested in and launched Zeebo. Faced with this scenario of losses, the Zeebo was discontinued in Brazil in 2011. The game purchase network, ZeeboNet, was shut down on September 30, 2011.\n\nFor a short time starting in November 2010, Tectoy produced and marketed 14-inch tube TVs with 12 games included in memory. This production came at a time when LCD and plasma screen manufacturers accounted for 70% of production in the Free Economic Zone of Manaus. Faced with the success of outsourced set-top boxes for the South Korean company Humax, which produced them for Sky, Tectoy executives saw the possibility of using the company's factory in Manaus for third-party products. This, the company reasoned, would be especially helpful to those who wanted to enter the Brazilian market without investing in their own structure. Tectoy's workforce rose from 200 to 400 employees as a result of the partnership with Humax, which began on December 16, 2010. The company's partnership with Humax ended in the second quarter of 2013.\n\nIn the wake of higher revenues obtained in early 2011, Tectoy attempted to auction preferred and common shares. While the company expected to gain R$9.6 million from the sale, a lack of market interest prevented the sale from happening. Tectoy continued to invest in new categories and licensing in digital electronics. Tablets were a major part of the company's revenue in 2013, accounting for 37% of revenue between January and September, with the expectation of surpassing DVD players and becoming their main product category. In 2012, Tectoy licensed Disney characters to launch a new product, the Magic Tablet. The company's shares were grouped in 2015. Tectoy was forced to carry out the procedure after actions of BM&F Bovespa against penny stocks.\n\nA strategy of the company has been betting on nostalgia to bring back consoles that were sold in the 1980s and 1990s. In March 2017, Tectoy released the Atari Flashback 7, a version of the Atari 2600, with 101 games in memory but without support to insert game cartridges. Additionally, by June of the same year, it was planned to relaunch the Mega Drive, with some additional features such as a microSD card slot. As of the end of 2015, Tectoy was still selling the Master System continuously since 1989. By 2016, the Master System had sold 8 million units in Brazil.\n\nTectoy is known for their handling and distribution of Sega consoles in Brazil. The company has sold all of Sega's consoles since 1987, including the Master System, Mega Drive, 32X, Sega CD, Game Gear, Saturn, Sega Pico, and Dreamcast, in addition to the \"Zillion\" laser tag gun. Because Tectoy continued to produce the Master System and Mega Drive years after its cancellation, the Master System is considered the longest-lived console in the history of video game consoles. The company also introduced the Sega Meganet service to Brazil in 1995, starting with a focus on e-mail but later expanding to online multiplayer and chat by 1996, as well as partnering with Brazilian bank Bradesco to develop a banking system, similar to Japan's connection with Nagoya Bank. As of 2015, the Master System and Mega Drive combined sell around 150,000 a year. This is a level comparable to modern consoles available in Brazil such as the PlayStation 4, despite the Mega Drive being temporarily discontinued and reintroduced. Tectoy's hardware for the Master System and Mega Drive evolved over time into derivatives targeting the low-income market. These consoles generally do not have the cartridge slots, as games are installed directly on its internal memory. One of these consoles is the Mega Drive Portable, a portable Mega Drive with 20 games installed onto its memory. Other variations exclusive to Tectoy's releases include the Master System Super Compact, which is a wireless system that transmits to a television, and the Master System Girl, a version of the Super Compact in a neon pink case. In 2006, Tectoy released the Master System 3 Collection and the Mega Drive 3, including 120 and 71 built-in games, respectively. Tectoy has received and considered requests to remake the original Master System.\nIn the 1990s, Tectoy translated several games published by Sega into Portuguese. Translated games include the first three \"Phantasy Star\" games, \"Shining in the Darkness\", and \"Riven\", the last of which also incorporated dubbed voices. Additionally, Tectoy built relationships with other developers, including Capcom, Acclaim Entertainment, Electronic Arts, and Midway Games. Tectoy would then translate titles from these developers into Portuguese for release in Brazil, and to tie in to popular Brazilian entertainment franchises. Some examples of this include: \"Teddy Boy\" became \"Geraldinho\", certain \"Wonder Boy\" titles became \"Monica's Gang\" games, and \"Ghost House\" became \"Chapolim vs. Dracula: Um Duelo Assutador\", based on Mexican TV series \"El Chapulín Colorado\". Additionally, Tectoy ported games for their Sega systems, such as \"Street Fighter II\" for the Master System and \"Duke Nukem 3D\" for the Mega Drive, as well as various games ported from the Game Gear to the more popular Master System. Aside from porting, the company developed \"Férias Frustradas do Pica-Pau\" after finding out that \"Woody Woodpecker\" was the most popular cartoon on Brazilian television. These titles were developed in-house by Tectoy in Brazil. Tectoy also suggested the development of \"Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II\", a project that Sega accepted but would be the only suggestion from Tectoy that Sega approved. More recently, Tectoy created two Mega Drive games based on \"Show do Milhão\", a Brazilian game show based on the \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" format, and \"Mega Drive 4 Guitar Idol\", a 16-bit rhythm video game based on \"Guitar Hero\" with its own guitar peripheral. Tectoy had been granted a master license by Sega for all of their games, including those developed in Europe or America, and had permission to sell any game by Sega in Brazil.\n\nAside from its work with Sega, Tectoy has developed and sold karaoke machines, set-top boxes, televisions pre-installed with games, mobile games, DVD players, Blu-ray players, a mobile TV receiver, the Nabaztag music player, and the Zeebo video game console. Tectoy also distributed PC games in Brazil such as \"Blade Runner\", \"StarCraft\", and \"Daytona USA\". A successful electronic toy of the company was the Pense Bem, a toy computer introduced in 1988 that asked questions to kids on geography and history. Another product, the Teddy Ruxpin, is a teddy bear that moves and tells stories, licensed by Tectoy for release in Brazil. The Magic Star, a plastic singing toy based on a character from \"Monica's Gang\", was popular in the 1980s and later was rereleased in 2013. Other toys include the Mr. Show electronic question and answer game, as well as Sapo Xulé, a frog doll wearing sneakers, and toys developed for \"Senninha\", a comic based on Ayrton Senna. More recently, Tectoy has also entered the infant care market, partnering with Fisher-Price on electric baby monitors and with Disney on air purifiers and toothbrush sterilizers.\n\n"}
{"id": "417004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=417004", "title": "The Falls", "text": "The Falls\n\nThe Falls is a 1980 film directed by Peter Greenaway. It was Greenaway's first feature-length film after many years making shorts. It does not have a traditional dramatic narrative; it takes the form of a mock documentary in 92 short parts.\n\nThe world has been struck by a mysterious incident called the \"Violent Unknown Event\" or VUE, which has killed many people and left a great many survivors suffering from a common set of symptoms: mysterious ailments (some appearing to be mutations of evolving into a bird-like form), dreaming of water (categorised by form, such as Category 1, Flight, or Category 3, Waves) and becoming obsessed with birds and flight. Many of the survivors have been gifted with new languages. They have also stopped aging, making them immortal (barring disease or injury).\n\nA directory of these survivors has been compiled, and \"The Falls\" is presented as a film version of an excerpt from that directory, corresponding to the 92 entries for persons whose surnames begin with the letters FALL-. Not all of the 92 entries correspond to a person – some correspond to deleted entries, cross references and other oddities of the administrative process that has produced the directory. One biography concerns two people – the twin brothers Ipson and Pulat Fallari, who are played (in still photographs) by the Brothers Quay.\n\nIn addition to the common VUE symptoms mentioned above, a number of themes run through the film. Among these are references to a number of bureaucratic organisations including the VUE Commission and the Bird Facilities Industries (a parody of the British Film Institute which produced the film), the history of manned flight from Daedalus with the suggestion that birds may be responsible for the VUE (and that the film may thus be seen as a sequel to Hitchcock's \"The Birds\"), complex debates over the location of the epicentre of the VUE, and repeated references to Tulse Luper. Luper is a recurring off-stage character in Greenaway's early films, and would eventually appear on film in the epic series \"The Tulse Luper Suitcases\" (2003 onwards), which is itself named in \"The Falls\".\n\n\"The Falls\" includes clips of a number of Greenaway's early shorts. It also anticipates some of his later films: the subject of biography 27, Propine Fallax, is a pseudonym for Cissie Colpitts, the central figure of \"Drowning by Numbers\" (1988), while the car accident in biography 28 prefigures that in \"A Zed and Two Noughts\" (1985).\n\nThe largely formal and deadpan manner of the narration contrasts with the absurdity of the content.\n\nTwo example biographies follow.\n\nBwythan Fallbutus is the 42nd victim of the Violent Unknown Event listed in the VUE directory. Bwythan Fallbutus was Betheda Fallbutus' eldest son. He was the officially-appointed VUE Commission's linguistic expert. He lived just off the Goldhawk Road within a three-minute walking distance of his mother, whom he visited every day. The VUE had given Bwythan a bone-marrow deficiency, wattles and cobs along his backbone, and a foot disease that shredded his toe-nails. He could drink salt water without harm but felt listless and debilitated away from the influence of chlorophyll, which is why there were always several plantpots in his office, and even on his desk. Bwythan could speak fourteen VUE languages and interpret successfully in nine of them at a diplomatic level. It was Bwythan who had organised the examination of Agropio Fallaver, the sole speaker of the language named after him. Although Bwythan had come to the private opinion that Fallaver was somehow a fake manoeuvred by FOX, the Society for Ornithological Extermination. Bwythan has privately researched the ten-thousand most popularly used words in forty-three of the main VUE languages and has produced a comparative dictionary. From this research he wrote a book, \"View from Babel, to explain, or attempt to explain the gift of tongues and the fragmentation of language\". In trying to do this, and in his associated search for a common linguistic denominator, he successfully demonstrated that the names of birds were important key words. It was rumoured that it was because of the conclusions of his research that Bwythan was run down by a white van, registration number NID 92, on a zebra crossing in the Goldhawk Road. A van with the same registration had been seen outside Bwythan's house an hour before the accident. The police later found the vehicle responsible on a deserted airfield. It was supposed that the assailant, or assailants, had escaped by air.\n\nCatch-Hanger Fallcaster is one of the victims of the Violent Unknown Event listed in the VUE directory. Her biography, number 49 in the movie, is one amidst several interrelated biographies concerning different members of the Fallcaster family. Catch-Hanger Fallcaster had been a teacher. She had taught Russian to Germans. And certainly before the VUE, she would never have admitted to a great knowledge of ornithology. The VUE had made Catch-Hanger three inches taller, paralysed her index fingers and improved her eyesight. She now taught Abcadefghan to anyone who wanted to learn. Catch-Hanger has translated Tulse Luper's \"Some Birds of the Northern Hemisphere\", establishing a definitive pronunciation of the Abcadefghan equivalents for the Falconidae. She has also started work on an Abcadefghan-English language primer that is based substantially on the three nursery rhymes, \"Goosey, Goosey, Gander,\" \"Who Killed Cock-Robin?,\" and \"I Shot a Little Duck.\"\n\nThe soundtrack is mainly by Michael Nyman and is partly based, like his later music for \"Drowning by Numbers\", on the slow movement of Mozart's \"Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola and Orchestra K. 364\". It also includes numerous clips from various songs popular among the avant-garde of the time, including pieces by Brian Eno (in particular \"Golden Hours\" from Another Green World) and snippets of \"Jugband Blues\", the last song Syd Barrett recorded with Pink Floyd.\n\nLanguages the survivors have been gifted with include:\n\n\n\"The Falls\" has an 80% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with Nathan Lee of \"The Village Voice\" calling it \"the most playful and engaging of Greenaway's compositions\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5906140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5906140", "title": "The Last Warning", "text": "The Last Warning\n\nThe Last Warning is a 1928 American mystery film directed by Paul Leni, and starring Laura La Plante, Montagu Love, and Margaret Livingston. Its plot follows a New York producer's attempt to re-stage a play five years after one of the original cast members was murdered in the theater. The film is based on the 1922 Broadway melodrama of the same name by Thomas F. Fallon, which in turn was based on the story \"House of Fear\" by Wadsworth Camp, the father of the writer Madeleine L'Engle.\n\nConceived as a followup to Leni's wildly successful 1927 production \"The Cat and the Canary\" (also starring La Plante), the film was produced by Universal Pictures under Carl Laemmle. Principal photography took place in Los Angeles in the summer of 1928 on sets recycled from Univeral's \"The Phantom of the Opera\" (1925). It premiered on Christmas Day 1928 before expanding in January 1929, and was released as both a part-sound as well as a silent film; the silent version is the only known extant version. It was the final film directed by Leni before his death from blood poisoning on September 2, 1929.\n\nResponse by critics to \"The Last Warning\" varied, with many praising its performances and cinematography, though several commented on its incoherent plot, and others criticized its integration of sound, feeling it presented optimally as a silent film. In 2016, Universal Pictures selected the film for restoration, using elements from two different prints owned by the Packard Humanities Institute and the Cinémathèque Française.\n\nIn a Broadway production of a play entitled \"The Snare\", one of the actors, John Woodford, inexplicably dies during a stage performance, and his body disappears. Few clues exist as to what caused his death, aside from several drops of liquid found that resembled chloroform. Rumors of a love triangle between Woodford and two cast members circulate as a possible motive for his death.\n\nFive years after the theater's closure, producer Mike Brody decides to solve the mystery by again staging the play with the remaining cast and re-enacting Woodford's murder. During rehearsals in the abandoned theater, strange occurrences plague the cast, including ominous noises, falling scenery, and an unexplained fire. Doris, the lead actress, has her purse stolen from her dressing room by an unseen assailant; Josiah Bunce, the stage manager, reportedly receives a telegram warning him to drop out of the play, signed by John Woodford, and the theater's new owner, Arthur McHugh, also receives a visit from Woodford's ghost. \n\nThe production continues, and during the final rehearsal, Harvey Carleton inexplicably disappears from the stage during a blackout. Doris spots a mysterious masked figure in a theater box in addition to a man resembling John Woodford, but both disappear. Behind a picture hanging on the stage, a lever is discovered which opens a trap door, where the cast find Harvey incoherent. Arthur and Richard Quayle, another cast member, venture inside, where they discover a tunnel that leads to Doris's dressing room. \n\nArthur has police officers appointed at the theater for the show's opening the following night. During the performance, an electrical wire charged to 400 volts is discovered connected to a candlestick onstage, and Arthur lunges at Richard to prevent him from touching it during the final scene. The unseen masked assailant is discovered hiding inside a grandfather clock onstage, but he drops through a trap door in the floor just after shooting one of the police officers. The assailant scales the theater and throws a dummy resembling John Woodford onto the stage. He then begins swinging from a rope, but is brought back down by a stagehand who cuts it.\n\nThe masked assailant is discovered to be Josiah, who caused Woodford's death via electrocution and had been behind the \"hauntings\" to prevent the theater from being used.\n\nThe film was envisioned as a companion piece to director Leni's earlier \"The Cat and the Canary\", due to that film's great popularity. Universal assigned Leni to the project under the assumption that his previous success would yield significant box-office results. It is based on the 1922 play of the same name by Thomas F. Fallon, which ran for 238 performances from October 24, 1922, until May 1923 at the Klaw Theatre. Fallon's play was in turn based on the story \"House of Fear\" by Wadsworth Camp, the father of writer Madeleine L'Engle.\n\nPrincipal photography began in August 1928. The theater set used in the film had originally been used in the 1925 \"The Phantom of the Opera\" starring Lon Chaney, and was located in Universal City, California. \n\nActress Laura La Plante, a former-teenage actress who had previously starred in Leni's \"The Cat and the Canary\", was given top-billing in her role as Doris Terry, though her part in the film is considerably less involved than in the former. Film historian John Soister characterizes La Plante's role as that of an ingénue, consisting primarily of reactions to \"assorted assaults, visions, and set-ups.\" The film marked La Plante's first talking picture. British actor Montagu Love was cast opposite La Plante, receiving second-billing. Soister notes that Love was \"cast against type\" for his role, that of \"no-nonsense\" theater owner Arthur McHugh. \n\nMargaret Livingston, an actress who had also begun her career as a teenager, was cast in the role of actress Evalynda Hendon; her performance in the film helped earn her a role in Universal's \"The Charlatan\", released later that year. In the role of Richard Quayle, Leni cast actor John Boles, who subsequently had a minor part in \"Frankenstein\" (1931). Bert Roach was cast as Mike Brody, the producer who re-stages the play in the film. Barbara, an elderly character actress who starred in the original play in which Woodford was murdered, is portrayed by Dutch actress Carrie Daumery. This was Daumery's only film credit from the silent era, and her role is likened by Soister and others to that of Flora Finch in \"The Cat and the Canary\", but stripped of any comedic tone.\n\nAccording to the American Film Institute, \"The Last Warning\" had its theatrical debut in New York City on January 6, 1929. However, special advance screenings occurred on Christmas Day 1928 in several U.S. cities, including Chillicothe, Missouri, and Manhattan, Kansas. \n\nThe film was marketed as a successor to producer Leni's previous film \"The Cat and the Canary\", attributed to producer Laemmle's \"discriminating supervision.\" It is often considered one of the last silent films produced by Universal Studios, but it was also released in a \"part-talkie\" Movietone version with a brief minute or two of synch-sound footage added, as well as screams, cries, and other sound effects. These scenes have since been lost. Few prints of the film exist in the United States: One is owned by the George Eastman House Motion Picture Collection in Rochester, New York, which was originally owned by the Cinémathèque Française, and is slightly edited and entirely silent with French intertitles. \n\nIn 2016, the film underwent digital restoration by Universal Pictures, sourced from both the Cinémathèque Française print, as well as a print featuring the original English title cards owned by the Packard Humanities Institute Collection of the UCLA Film & Television Archive. The restored print was screened at the Castro Theatre as part of the San Francisco Silent Film Festival on June 4, 2016. It was again screened in September 2016 at Cinecon Classic Film Festival in Los Angeles.\n\nThough it re-teamed Leni with \"The Cat and the Canary\" star Laura La Plante and features a similar style, \"The Last Warning\" lacks the supernatural elements of \"The Cat and the Canary\" and is therefore usually considered in the mystery genre rather than the horror genre; some historians, however, have classed it as a horror film. Elements of comedy present in Leni's \"The Cat and the Canary\" are also absent from the film. Extant published reviews of the film were varied.\n\nMordaunt Hall of \"The New York Times\" noted the film contained \"some finely directed passages,\" but that it was \"not especially disturbing.\" Martin Dickstein of the \"Brooklyn Daily Eagle\" described the film as being \"related with such vagueness that the picture fail[s] to hold together,\" but praised Leni's \"propitious use of \"the camera angle,\" and it is through this inventive maneuvering of the lens that the picture achieves at least a visual significance.\" A critic of the \"Los Angeles Times\" similarly found the cinematography \"highly interesting\" and the plot \"lost in a maze of double and triple exposures,\" adding that there \"is a decided lack of spontaneity in the sound sequences.\"\n\nThe majority of the criticism surrounding the film had to do with its integration of sound. Irene Thirer of the \"New York Daily News\", who felt the film \"should never have been a talkie,\" elaborating that the dialogue episodes \"retard the action\" and \"are not well done.\" \"The Montana Standard\" noted that the film \"presents many thrills\" and was widely enjoyed by the audiences at the film's premiere in Butte. A critic of the \"Hartford Courant\" alternately felt that, \"as a talking picture, the film retains all the chill values of the play, with its eerie noises, screams, fright-fraught dialogue and general noise and excitement,\" but conceded that \"it decidedly is not the scary kind of mystery play that the average person would find too startling.\" Sid Silverman, writing for \"Variety\", noted the use of sound effects as \"multiple, continuous, and in detail,\" and that the film included \"enough screams to stimulate the average film mob into sticking through it.\" Hall also criticized the film's utilization of sound, writing: \"There are too many outbursts of shrieking, merely to prove the effect of the audible screen, to cause any spine-chilling among those watching this production.\" \n\nThe \"Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune\" noted that \"The Last Warning\" \"the most thrilling mystery film released this season,\" while the \"Billings Gazette\" deemed it \"the greatest mystery picture ever filmed.\" \"Photoplay\" was less laudatory, noting: \"This could have been a gorgeous mystery story, but it's an obvious cross between \"The Phantom of the Opera\" and \"The Terror\", with none of their consistency or power.\"\n\nIn a retrospective assessment, author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film two and a half out of four stars, commending its camerawork and direction, but criticizing the film's story as \"silly.\" Commenting on the finale, film historian Graham Petrie notes that Leni and cinematographer Hal Mohr \"handle the camera with the utmost possible freedom, culminating in a scene in which the camera swings on a rope with the villian from one part of the theater to another. Along the way, Leni revels in the shadows, cobwebs, tilted angles, subtly distorted perspectives, ominously confined spaces, and clutching hands that had by now become his trademark.\" Petrie, who classifies the film as a thriller rather than a mystery, emphasizes that its stylistic and visual elements supersede narrative plausibility and characterization.\n\n\"The Last Warning\" was re-made in 1939 by Joe May under the title \"The House of Fear\".\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1961, by a group of dedicated entertainers working on an idea proposed by Al Gillyon. The society is modelled on the Grand Order of Water Rats. Its membership is exclusively of men, although the members wives, partners and friends often help out in varying capacities. MICE is an acronym for \"Men in Charitable Endeavour\".\n\nIn 1960, Al Gillyon proposed the setting up of an organisation in Kingston upon Hull similar to the Grand Order of Water Rats. The idea was talked about in clubs, at shows, even in people's front rooms after a show. But, in the words of Al Gillyon, \"We cannot hold a first meeting until permission has been obtained from the Variety Artist Association\" of which all were loyal members. Permission of the association was granted and the first ever meeting To which hirteen entertainers were invited, was held at the Windmill Hotel, Witham, Kingston upon Hull on 13 February 1961. Ten were able to attend. Officers were elected, it was agreed that the aims of the group, Fellowship, Benevolence and Charity should be paramount and the group should be known as \"The Society of MICE\".\n\nThe Society has the usual committee structure, with a President and Vice-president elected annually, chosen singly by the outgoing President and announced at the annual dinner, which is held in Mid February. There are also positions for chairman, Secretary, Treasurer and the Steward to the Elders. The only difference is the title of these positions, all of which are extremely fitting:-\n\n\nThere are other positions within the society, including the CONCERT MOUSE, who organises the concerts.\n\nThe following:\n\n\nare considered to be the founder members of the society as they were either present at the very first meeting of the society, or offered their apologies for absence. From these members, the first KING MOUSE was Al Gillyon, the first PRINCE MOUSE was Jack Wilkinson, the first SCRIBE MOUSE was Terry Matsell, and the first TRAP GUARD was Jimmy Welsh, who at the time was also the Vice-Chairman of the Variety Artists Association.\n\nThe Society is currently made up of Singers & Entertainers, mainly from the Kingston upon Hull area, along with many other members who perform equally as important roles behind the scenes. Members of the 'Old Flames' (Retired members of Humberside fire brigade) have also joined the society\" and Stars in Their Eyes\" champion Ian Moor is a member and former holder of the office of Prince Mouse.\n\nThe Society's aim is to raise funds for local good causes and charities, by means of live concert shows and other fund raising events. The society holds tombola & raffle stalls at various outdoor events throughout the summer and concerts are usually twice monthly in and around the Kingston upon Hull area. Venues vary from clubs to residential homes. It holds meetings every fortnight, to discuss future concerts and other matters regarding fund raising for the community. The meeting venue has changed several times over the years, and is referred to by members as the MOUSE HOLE.\nIn 1996, the society added an extra act to the concerts, in the form of a choir, made up of several of the society's members. Initially called \"The Bolder Boys\", named after Harry Bolder, who conducted the choir in its early years and whose idea it was to form the choir, today it is known as \"The MICE Singers\". As well as regular appearances at the society's concerts, they perform at many other venues, and are now in great demand throughout the year, with appearances at weddings, residential homes, harvest festivals, schools, and other events.\n\nThe Society has an anthem, with lyrics written by one of the founder members, Clive Hunter, who adapted the words to the tune of Three Blind Mice. The anthem is sung at all concerts, and at the annual dinner by all the members present.\n\nEach year the elected King Mouse nominates a charity or organisation to be the prime beneficiary of the years fundraising efforts and specific concerts and events are chosen to raise funds solely for this purpose. A cheque for the grand total raised is then presented to a representative from the charity or organisation at the annual \"Special Presentation Evening\", which is held at the end of January, shortly before the annual dinner.\n\n"}

{"id": "140661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140661", "title": "Tivoli Gardens", "text": "Tivoli Gardens\n\nTivoli Gardens (or simply Tivoli) is an amusement park and pleasure garden in Copenhagen, Denmark. The park opened on 15 August 1843 and is the second-oldest operating amusement park in the world, after Dyrehavsbakken in nearby Klampenborg, also in Denmark.\n\nWith 4.6 million visitors in 2017, Tivoli is the second-most popular seasonal amusement park in the world after Europa-Park. Tivoli is the most-visited theme park in Scandinavia, and the fifth most-visited theme park in Europe, only behind Disneyland Park, Europa-Park, Walt Disney Studios Park and Efteling.\n\nThe amusement park was first called \"Tivoli & Vauxhall\"; \"Tivoli\" alluding to the Jardin de Tivoli in Paris (which in its turn had been named from Tivoli near Rome, Italy),\"Vauxhall\" alluding to the Vauxhall Gardens in London. It is also mentioned in various books, like \"Number the Stars\" by Lois Lowry.\n\nTivoli's founder, Georg Carstensen (b. 1812 – d. 1857), obtained a five-year charter to create Tivoli by telling King Christian VIII that \"when the people are amusing themselves, they do not think about politics\". The monarch granted Carstensen use of roughly 15 acres (61,000 m²) of the fortified glacis outside Vesterport (the West Gate) for an annual rent. Therefore, until the 1850s, Tivoli was outside the city, accessible through Vesterport.\n\nFrom the very start, Tivoli included a variety of attractions: buildings in the exotic style of an imaginary Orient: a theatre, band stands, restaurants and cafés, flower gardens, and mechanical amusement rides such as a merry-go-round and a primitive scenic railway. After dark, colored lamps illuminated the gardens. On certain evenings, specially designed fireworks could be seen reflected in Tivoli's lake.\n\nComposer Hans Christian Lumbye (b. 1810 – d. 1874) was Tivoli's musical director from 1843 to 1872. Lumbye was inspired by Viennese waltz composers like the Strauss family (Johann Strauss I and his sons), and became known as the \"Strauss of the North.\" Many of his compositions are specifically inspired by the gardens, including \"Salute to the Ticket Holders of Tivoli\", \"Carnival Joys\" and \"A Festive Night at Tivoli\". The Tivoli Symphony Orchestra still performs many of his works.\n\nTivoli was also used predominantly in the 1961 science fiction film, Reptilicus. \n\nIn 1874, Chinese style Pantomimeteatret (The Pantomime Theatre) took the place of an older smaller theatre. The audience stands in the open, the stage being inside the building. The theatre's \"curtain\" is a mechanical peacock's tail. From the very beginning, the theatre was the home of Italian pantomimes, introduced in Denmark by the Italian Giuseppe Casorti. This tradition, which is dependent on the Italian Commedia dell'Arte has been kept alive, including the characters Cassander (the old father), Columbine (his beautiful daughter), Harlequin (her lover), and, especially popular with the youngest spectators, the stupid servant Pierrot. The absence of spoken dialogue is an advantage, as Tivoli is now an international tourist attraction.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, Tivoli also hosted human exhibitions.\n\nIn 1943, Nazi sympathisers burnt many of Tivoli's buildings, including the concert hall, to the ground. Temporary buildings were constructed in their place and the park was back in operation after a few weeks.\n\nTivoli is always evolving without abandoning its original charm or traditions. As Georg Carstensen said in 1844, \"Tivoli will never, so to speak, be finished,\" a sentiment echoed just over a century later when Walt Disney said of his own Tivoli-inspired theme park, \"Disneyland will never be completed. It will continue to grow as long as there is imagination left in the world.\" \nIn Icelandic, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish, the word tivoli has become synonymous with any amusement park.\n\nThe park is best known for its wooden roller coaster, Rutschebanen, or as some people call it, Bjergbanen (\"The Mountain Coaster\"), built in 1914. It is one of the world's oldest wooden roller coasters that is still operating today. An operator controls the ride by braking down the hills so it won't gain too much speed. It is an ACE Coaster Classic.\n\nAnother roller coaster, The Demon (\"Dæmonen\"), features an Immelmann loop, a vertical loop, and a zero-G roll all during the ride time of just one minute and forty six seconds. An old roller coaster, The Snake (\"Slangen\"), was removed to have enough space for The Demon. In 2017, Tivoli Gardens added an optional virtual reality experience to the ride, simulating a flight through ancient China, along with encounters with dragons and demons. The Demon is situated next to the concert hall.\n\nA well-known swing ride, The Star Flyer, opened in Tivoli in 2006. high and built by the Australian company Funtime, it offers panoramic views of the city.\n\nOn 1 May 2009, Tivoli Gardens opened the new ride Vertigo, a looping plane ride where the rider pilots the ride, able to control the plane.\n\nA Zamperla Air Race ride, Aquila, opened on 11 April 2013. It is a giant swing and spinner with centrifugal powers up to 4 g, named after the constellation of the Eagle.\n\nThe newest attraction is Fatamorgana, which opened in 2016. This is the world's first Condor 2GH, which offers two separate seating arrangements, one milder version with two-seater gondolas, and a thrilling version in which riders are slung around at high speed while seated in a ring and facing away from the center.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, there is a Halloween Fest in October and Christmas Holidays in December. During the summer the park has fireworks shows.\n\nThere is one on-site hotel at the park: Hotel Nimb. The Tivoli Hotel & Congress Centre is affiliated with Tivoli Gardens only by name, but close cooperation does take place.\n\nBesides the rides, Tivoli Gardens also serve as a venue for various performing arts & as an active part of the cultural scene in Copenhagen.\n\nTivolis Koncertsal is a classical concert hall featuring concerts with some of the largest names in international classical music.\n\nThe Pantomime Theatre is an open-air theatre designed by Vilhelm Dahlerup, also known for the design of the Royal Danish Theatre. It is a toy-like historicist built in Chinese style and noted for its mechanical front curtain that takes five men to operate and unfolds like a peacock's tail. As indicated by the name, it is primarily a scene for pantomime theatre in the classical Italian commedia dell'arte tradition, which is performed daily with a live pit orchestra. Besides this original function, the theatre leads a second life as a venue for ballet and modern dance, performing works by choreographers such as August Bournonville, Dinna Bjørn, Louise Midjord and Paul James Rooney.\n\nThe Tivoli Youth Guard is a formation of boys and girls aged 8–16 dressed in uniforms reminiscent of those of the Royal Danish Guard complete with bearskins. It was founded in 1844 and gives concerts, makes parades, stands guard at the garden's buildings and monuments at special occasions and represents the gardens at various events. It is composed of a Corps of drums, a military styled marching band and a honor guard platoon.\n\nDuring the warmer summer months, Tivoli also features a live music series dubbed \"Fredagsrock\" (\"Friday Rock\"), which in the past has featured Roxette, the Smashing Pumpkins, Sting, the Beach Boys, Pet Shop Boys, Kanye West, 5 Seconds of Summer and popular Danish groups such as TV-2, Nephew, Hanne Boel, Raveonettes and Thomas Helmig.\n\nDuring Copenhagen Jazz Festival Tivoli Gardens is one of the many Copenhagen localities that serves as a venue for concerts.\n\n\n"}

New Zealand even developed its own Pong-style game console, the Sportronic, in the late 1970s, as a result of import licensing laws.\n\n\"Laser Hawk\" was developed for the Atari 8-bit in 1986 by Andrew Bradfield and Harvey Kong Tin.\n\n\"Super Skidmarks\", released for the Commodore Amiga in 1995, was developed by Auckland-based Acid Software.\n\nAlthough a minor player in the global video gaming industry, New Zealand has had success with homegrown game developers such as Dinosaur Polo Club (developers of \"Mini Metro\") and Sidhe Interactive. \n\nThe action RPG \"Path of Exile\", developed by Grinding Gear Games and released in 2013, enjoyed international success.\n\nThe Game Masters exhibition was held at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, from 15 December 2012 through to 28 April 2013.\n\nIn 2003, \"Manhunt\" became the first video game officially banned in New Zealand.\n\n"}

Inside the star, the signature of the honoree is etched. The full name of the honoree in capital letters can be seen on the bronze square, as well as the sponsor in normal letters.\n\nThe committee of experts initially selected 80 deceased stars to be honored on the walk of fame. Additionally to these, each year a living author or interpreter receives a star.\n\nDetails on the honorees may be found at the nearby Stiftung Deutsches Kabarett (German Cabaret Foundation). Here, the core of the German Cabaret Archive is formed by more than eighty literary estates with biographies, documents and cultural heritage, regarding eighty thousand people from the history of cabaret and the forms of comedy that preceded it. This archive is based on the private initiative of Reinhard Hippen (1961). The counterpart of the \"Walk of Fame\" can be found in the \"Hall of Fame\" in the Bernburg castle, in Saxony-Anhalt. Numerous exhibits remind viewers of the \"immortals\" of cabaret.\n\nOf all the nominated people, the following stars have been created:\n\n"}
