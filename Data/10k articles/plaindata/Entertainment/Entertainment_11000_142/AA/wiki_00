The film's script was written by Sachin Bhowmick and Rumi Jaffery. The film premiered in India and the United States on 22 January 1999. It starred Akshaye Khanna, Rajesh Khanna and Aishwarya Rai and was the last production of R. K. Films.\n\nRohan Khanna (Akshaye Khanna) is a jobless graduate living with his grandfather (Alok Nath) and his mother (Moushumi Chatterjee). Rohan has been tirelessly looking for a decent job without success. One day, Rohan's neighbour, Ranjit arrives from America, where he co-owns and runs a motel and is married to a white woman of European descent. Ranjit suggests that Rohan should also move to America and find a white European woman to marry and settle with. \n\nRohan is immediately persuaded and prepares his visa/paperwork with Ranjit as his sponsor. At this point, his mother reminds him of his late father, Balraj (Rajesh Khanna), who had similar dreams of settling in USA and left her and Rohan alone in India with nobody to look after them.\n\nRohan settles in his new life in USA and enjoys it immensely for many months, but he notices Ranjit is increasingly abusive towards his own parents and places them in a nursing home and the old aging parents always face verbal abuse from him and his European white wife. Also, Rohan notices that Ranjit becomes increasingly indifferent towards him and his needs, asking him to move out of his house and apartment with little notice. \n\nLater, Rohan luckily meets Sardar Khan (Kader Khan), a Pakistani man who earns his living as a taxi-cab driver, who is immensely impressed by Rohan's good manners and friendly personality. Sardar offers Rohan a place to stay,sharing the room with Iqbal Singh (Jaspal Bhatti), a Punjabi man from India and also offers him a temporary job as a taxi-cab driver. Rohan moves in and makes new friends easily. \n\nOne fine day, Rohan in his job as a taxi driver, meets a young Indian woman named Pooja (Aishwarya Rai) at the airport and they become friends. Later on, Pooja confides in Rohan her sad story of how her brother disappointed her by calling her to visit him in USA and hooks her up to marry his European boss who is a womaniser, without her consent.\n\nTaking pity on her sad plight, Rohan offers to share his room with her, with the permission of Sardar Khan and the Punjabi tenant who also shared the apartment. All of them welcome the couple, Pooja and Rohan, who are now deeply in love.\n\nSardar Khan helps the couple to find odd jobs in fast food joints, laundromats, restaurants and gas stations, etc. where they can earn some money, and Rohan is always protective of Pooja and seldom allows her to travel alone or too far. \n\nAfter a few years of doing these odd jobs, Rohan is tired of it all and wants to do something bigger to earn more money and he is advised by his friend Sardar Khan to approach Mr. Chaurasia (an influential Indian in the jurisdiction). Chaurasia advises Rohan to get a Green Card by marrying (on agreement) an NRI girl and once he gets the Green Card he can file for divorce. Chaurasia agrees to be their referee and sponsor.\n\nRohan and Pooja start looking for women who are ready to do this legal paperwork - and after a long search they meet seductive Loveleen (Suman Ranganathan) and after Rohan marries (files legal paperwork for civil marriage) her, he forgets Pooja completely, much to her dismay. Rohan becomes so hopelessly tempted by the beautiful Loveleem that he gets aggravated with his old friends and moves into a luxurious mansion provided by the wealthy Loveleen - and warns his friends to stay away from him. Sardar tries to warn him not to be consumed by his greed for luxury and women. Rohan tells them that they are envious of his progress. \n\nIn order to move on and to forget Rohan, Pooja finds a job as a caretaker/maid for a rich Indian man Balraj, who is ill and aging, and also bed-ridden most of the time. Pooja does not know that this is the Balraj - who had selfishly left India years ago, leaving his wife and his son Rohan alone to fend for themselves.\n\nPooja meets Balraj's son Karan, whose mother had deserted Balraj when Karan was a baby boy. Therefore, Karan has grown to be a spoiled and arrogant young man, who is also friends with Loveleen (now Rohan's arranged legal wife). Karan consistently asks his father for money to spend for his enjoyment. He even took a huge loan from Marko, a dangerous drug dealer and to re-pay his debts, he is assigned to transport drugs around the country.\n\nBalraj takes a liking to Pooja and considers her as a daughter. He wants to keep her in his home so he asks her to consider marrying Karan. \n\nMeanwhile, Rohan begins to realise that Loveleen's American culture deeply goes against his. He gets fed up with her ways and realises he is really in love with Pooja. He leaves Loveleen and goes back to Sardar and his friends and they tell him that Pooja now works as a caretaker for an old man called Balraj in Springfield meadow mansion.\n\nRohan sets out to ask Pooja for forgiveness where he finds her with the old sick man Balraj. Rohan tries to convince her to return to India and this is where the title song comes in.\n\nPooja agrees to do this, and as they part Rohan gives her a locket with a picture of his mother inside, saying that it is a token of promise that he will marry her. Pooja tells all this to Balraj (as she considers him to be a father figure by now) that she has fallen in love with a man named Rohan, and he encourages her as Rohan seemed like a nice guy. \n\nMeanwhile, Karan, being arrogant and spoilt, wishes to marry Pooja. He is always violently man-handling her in the house and threatening her that he will continue to treat her like a servant until and unless she succumbs to his desires. After violently urging her to marry him, her locket falls on the ground and Balraj picks it up. \n\nBalraj opens the locket and he is surprised to see his wife's picture inside it! After Pooja explains about the locket to him, he realises that Rohan is his son but does not tell Pooja immediately as he fears that Rohan might not accept him as a father in his hostility (and Karan might get more envious). \n\nAfter hearing from Pooja that Rohan is struggling to make ends meet, Balraj asks Pooja to call Rohan for an interview to his company for a Manager position, for which Rohan passes and is offered a well-paying job and career at last! Rohan expresses his gratitude for the opportunity and then Balraj continues his generosity from afar by giving Rohan a $5000 bonus, and anything he wishes for. \n\nAfter a few years, Rohan goes to visit Ranjit's poor abused parents and offers some help because he knows Ranjit is ignoring them all the time. Rohan pays for the parents Nursing home rent charges as well as their ticket to return to India as the parents wished to return to their homeland. After this, Pooja and Rohan continue to live a happy life in USA and plan to return to India after some time.\n\nJust before their departure, Balraj confesses to Rohan that he is indeed his long-lost son and that he had kept this secret from him fearing a hostile unacceptance of help from his part!\n\nRohan is stunned to realise that Balraj is his father and reacts in anger. Balraj continues to explain that after he arrived in America, he went back to India to find his family, but he could not, so he remarried. Balraj insists to speak to his wife to ask for forgiveness. She immediately forgives him and asks them all to come back to India. \n\nFinally, they are all united as one big happy family, including Karan, who is acquitted of his charges because he helps the Police find out and arrest Marko the drug dealer.\n\n\nThe music of this movie was composed by Nadeem–Shravan and the lyrics were written by Sameer. The soundtrack was very popular upon its release. All songs were very popular among the masses.\nMohammad Ali Ikram of PlanetBollywood gave the film 7.0/10 and wrote \"Aa Ab Laut Chalen may be filmi in conveying the theme, but the point is presented with laudable conviction in the second half. Rediff noted \"Maybe Rishi Kapoor was bowing to RK tradition, maybe he was trying to follow his heart, but he just has to get back to the drawing board and seriously plan that next venture\".\n\nThe box office performance of the film was classified as a \"Below Average\" by Box Office India. It is R.K. Films' last movie to date.\n\n"}

According to McNamara it is the first free-to-play online murder mystery game.\n\nThe game was developed by DM Financial Services, a company focusing on producing original and engaging online gaming content. Led by online gaming entrepreneur Darren McNamara, \"Anatomy of Murder\" was the result of over 13 years of extensive R&D. McNamara faced considerable resistance from the entertainment industry regarding the format, the production values, and for spending too much money. In addition, he received feedback from a network that they wanted to be involved in comissioning a series from the ground up rather than being shown a finished pilot they didn't order. He chose to go ahead and create the game because he felt it showed how much he believed in the concept more than a \"4 page glossy\". He originally received few knockbacks from TV executives In 2013, so he instead went outside the box and approached audiences directly. In October 2013, \"TV Tonight\" readers were asked to participate in an online focus group for the game, in order to provide McNamara with some feedback on his pitch. He was keen to see the concept being picked up in the Australian market before trying to sell it to the United States in addition he hoped to take the format to MIPTV in April 2014. \"Anatomy of Murder\" was released two years later in 2015.\n\nThe game's narrative was conveyed through 2 produced episodes at 45 minutes each. A third episode was also produced which revealed the killer and the clues in detail. McNamara designed the format, produced the 3 episodes and built the website himself. Due to the lack of budget, McNamara was not able to improve the script, the production and the trailer to his standards. All of the information required to solve the murder was contained within those two episodes, as well as information at the game's website (www.anatomyofmurder.com). A cash prize of AU$250,000 was made available to the first player able to solve the crime. The game could be played from phones, tablets or desktop computers. Players had to choose from nine possible killers and ten potential motives. According to McNamara, it is notable for being the first free-to-play online murder mystery game; he believes in the game's uniqueness as the format has been registered with FRAPA since 2007, and he has not come across any TV shows or DVD/Website/SMS games similar to \"Anatomy of Murder.\" The prize amount was changed to $100,000 some time during its development. The winner was to be announced on Christmas Day 2016. A series of 20 clues were released onto the website leading up to that date.\n\nAs of April 2015, \"Anatomy of Murder 2\" is in the works. As of October 2016, the sequel was set to start production in April 2017, with website members offered an audition. McNamara hoped to up the budget for this series in order to improve the quality. His goal was to produce between 2 and 3 series a year, with the story arcing across the whole season or between seasons. While only one person would win the major prize, there would be smaller additional prizes along the way.\n\n"}

{"id": "27055846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27055846", "title": "Antidosis", "text": "Antidosis\n\nAntidosis (Ancient Greek ), is the title of a speech treatise by the ancient Greek rhetorician, Isocrates. The \"Antidosis\" can be viewed as a defense, an autobiography, or rhetorical treatise. However, since Isocrates wrote it when he was 82 years old, it is generally seen by some people as an autobiography. The title literally translates as “an exchange,” and was applied in ancient Greek courts as a peculiar law pertaining to an exchange of estates between two parties. If one of the 1200 wealthiest Athenians eligible was tasked with the performance of a public liturgy and financing one of the many public concerns of Athens, then he could avoid the duty by nominating a richer man who was more qualified than himself to perform it. If the supposedly richer man disagreed with the terms, then the entirety of their estates would be exchanged and the now more wealthy man would have to perform the liturgy, as originally planned. The law inspired Isocrates' \"Antidosis\", which was written in the form of a court case where Isocrates had to defend himself from a charge of corrupting the youth by teaching them how to speak well in order for them to gain an unfair advantage over their peers. Although this work is put forward by Isocrates as his imagined defense in a legal case, it is more a treatise on morality and teaching.\n\nAlthough it is assumed that he is defending himself from a charge of corrupting the youth, nowhere in his Antidosis does Isocrates mention what crime he is charged with and from which he must defend, nor does it say what the penalty would be for being found guilty. Isocrates also does not make any attempt to offer evidence in his favor, yet presents the defense that he is a good teacher to his students as the full defense for the crime that he has committed. There is no specific mention of anything that would prove him innocent in this particular case.\n\nAnother idea by scholars is that early on in the \"Antidosis\", Isocrates reads aloud that he is being indicted for corrupting his students. He is accused of educating his students to speak against the courts, question the laws, and think for themselves. Isocrates says, “Here is the indictment my accuser endeavors to vilify me, charging that I corrupt young men by teaching them to speak and gain their won advantage in the courts contrary to justice…” Isocrates is being charged by Lysimachus who has accused Isocrates of receiving money from his students. In return, Isocrates has been teaching them how to become better public speakers and leaders. Isocrates proves his innocence by showing, that through teaching his students rhetoric, he is teaching them how to become better citizens and leaders of Athens. Isocrates proved his rationale by citing the accomplishments and devotion to the state his students displayed after being educated by him. Isocrates says in his defense, “But, I beg of you, consider well whether I appear to you to corrupt the young by my words, or, on the contrary, to inspire them to a life of valor and of dangers endured for their country…” B. Keith Murphy says of Isocrates’s defense, “For Isocrates, it is through rhetoric that we can approximate truth, or at least a consensual truth. A man who is trained in rhetoric is trained in truth, and the creation of that truth through oratory.” \n\nIn the sense that he is defending himself from an onerous charge to perform a liturgy, Isocrates makes a claim that his value to the city was provided through his teaching. He states that as a lifelong teacher, the value of the education that he has provided for students is worth far more than any monetary donation he can give to Athens. His teaching has provided for civic-minded and properly educated citizens that contribute to the orderly running of the city-state. For Isocrates to be sentenced to death would be to ignore the public service that he has performed for the city, by which he has devoted his life to giving its citizens a proper rhetorical education.\n\nIsocrates was 82 years old at the time he wrote \"Antidosis\", the longest work of his life. Antidosis is used by the author to depict himself as a model citizen and a contributor to the city-state of Athens. Since he was nearing the end of his life, he presumably would have wanted to leave behind a legacy of a devoted and moderate citizen to his home town and to justify his life as a service to Athens and the citizens to whom he taught rhetoric. Isocrates presents himself as a quiet citizen who avoids the public light, where oratory is used in a way to bring many different cases of litigation against each other - which the elite believed to negatively affect the way in which the republic was run. He tries to withdraw himself from the public interfering and intrusive efforts made into democratic politics.\n\nThe \"Antidosis\" is not seen by some as an autobiography of Isocrates; it was written later in his life as a fictionalized story similar to his own court trial. While there are similarities between Isocrates’s real court case and the one in the \"Antidosis\", many aspects of the case were fictionalized. Examples are Lysimachus being the person who has brought Isocrates to trial for this crime, and the crime being different from the one with which he was actually accused. According to George Norlin, “At any rate, in the \"Antidosis\"-a title which he borrows from the actual suit to which he had just been subjected-he adopts the fiction of a capital charge brought against him by an informer named Lysimachus, and of a trial before a court with its accessories.” \n\nIt is known that in his own life Isocrates did in fact go to court in his own defense over an amount of money he was made to pay. Isocrates argued this fine was based on the fact people thought he was wealthier than he actually was. He claimed this distorted perception of his wealth was due to his popularity as a public figure. This is similar to Isocrates’s defense in the \"Antidosis\" in which he claims he has been indicted due to the fact he is a very successful person, people are jealous of him, and people want to publicly embarrass him. In the \"Antidosis\", Isocrates is charged with corrupting the youth by teaching them to become good public speakers. With this ability, the students may trick people by convincing them of false truths which could ultimately allow the students to corrupt the government. This is an obvious defense of his life’s work of teaching.\n\nIsocrates states that the teacher should be judged by his students, in that if they do good and moral works then the teacher has done a good job and should be praised. This directly opposes Gorgias’ view that it is not up to him how his students use what he teaches them. \n\nAt the end of his Antidosis, Isocrates explains how he attempts to keep his students in high moral standing by discouraging some of the more debaucherous behaviors available in the city, such as “participating in drinking-bouts and tossing dice in gambling dens.” He posits the idea that as a teacher, he can be judged as successful by the moral ways in which his students live their lives when compared to other young men who are wasting their youth in revelry. Hence he agrees to submit to the punishment if any of his students can be shown to be bad influences on society and challenges his accuser to present even one student who could be said to belong to the group of degenerate youth.\n\nAnother important topic is natural talent. Isocrates argues that native ability is necessary for becoming a good orator, along with a proper education on the subject and practical experience.\n\nD. S. Hutchinson and Monte Johnson (2010) pointed out\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11125478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11125478", "title": "April Fools' Day", "text": "April Fools' Day\n\nApril Fools' Day (sometimes called All Fools' Day) is an annual celebration in some European and Western countries commemorated on April 1 by playing practical jokes and spreading hoaxes. The jokes and their victims are called April fools. People playing April Fool jokes often expose their prank by shouting \"April fool(s)\" at the unfortunate victim(s). Some newspapers, magazines and other published media report fake stories, which are usually explained the next day or below the news section in smaller letters. Although popular since the 19th century, the day is not a public holiday in any country.\n\nAside from April Fools' Day, the custom of setting aside a day for the playing of harmless pranks upon one's neighbour has historically been relatively common in the world.\n\nA disputed association between April 1 and foolishness is in Geoffrey Chaucer's \"The Canterbury Tales\" (1392). In the \"Nun's Priest's Tale\", a vain cock Chauntecleer is tricked by a fox on \"Syn March bigan thritty dayes and two\". Readers apparently understood this line to mean \"32 March\", i.e. April 1. However, it is not clear that Chaucer was referencing April 1. Modern scholars believe that there is a copying error in the extant manuscripts and that Chaucer actually wrote, \"Syn March was gon\". If so, the passage would have originally meant 32 days after March, i.e. 2 May, the anniversary of the engagement of King Richard II of England to Anne of Bohemia, which took place in 1381. \n\nIn 1508, French poet Eloy d'Amerval referred to a \"poisson d’avril\" (April fool, literally \"Fish of April\"), possibly the first reference to the celebration in France. Some writers suggest that April Fools' originated because in the Middle Ages, New Year's Day was celebrated on March 25 in most European towns, through a holiday that in some areas of France, specifically, ended on April 1, and those who celebrated New Year's Eve on January 1 made fun of those who celebrated on other dates by the invention of April Fools' Day. The use of January 1 as New Year's Day became common in France only by the mid-16th century, and the date was not adopted officially until 1564, thanks to the Edict of Roussillon.\n\nIn 1539, Flemish poet Eduard de Dene wrote of a nobleman who sent his servants on foolish errands on April 1.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the origin of April Fools' Day is often attributed to the Dutch victory at Brielle in 1572, where the Spanish Duke Álvarez de Toledo was defeated. \"Op 1 april verloor Alva zijn bril\" is a Dutch proverb, which can be translated to: \"On the first of April, Alva lost his glasses.\" In this case, the glasses (\"bril\" in Dutch) serve as a metaphor for Brielle. This theory, however, provides no explanation for the international celebration of April Fools' Day.\n\nIn 1686, John Aubrey referred to the celebration as \"Fooles holy day\", the first British reference. On April 1, 1698, several people were tricked into going to the Tower of London to \"see the Lions washed\".\n\nAlthough no Biblical scholar or historian are known to have mentioned a relationship, some have expressed the belief that the origins of April Fool's Day may go back to the Genesis flood narrative. In a 1908 edition of the \"Harper's Weekly\" cartoonist Bertha R. McDonald wrote:\n\nIn the UK, an April Fool joke is revealed by shouting \"April fool!\" at the recipient, who becomes the \"April fool\". A study in the 1950s, by folklorists Iona and Peter Opie, found that in the UK, and in countries whose traditions derived from the UK, the joking ceased at midday. A person playing a joke after midday is the \"April fool\" themselves.\n\nIn Scotland, April Fools' Day was traditionally called 'Huntigowk Day', although this name has fallen into disuse. The name is a corruption of 'Hunt the Gowk', \"gowk\" being Scots for a cuckoo or a foolish person; alternative terms in Gaelic would be \"Là na Gocaireachd\", 'gowking day', or \"Là Ruith na Cuthaige\", 'the day of running the cuckoo'. The traditional prank is to ask someone to deliver a sealed message that supposedly requests help of some sort. In fact, the message reads \"Dinna laugh, dinna smile. Hunt the gowk another mile.\" The recipient, upon reading it, will explain he can only help if he first contacts another person, and sends the victim to this next person with an identical message, with the same result.\n\nIn England a \"fool\" is known by different names around the country, including a \"noodle\", \"gob\", \"gobby\" or \"noddy\".\n\nIn Ireland, it was traditional to entrust the victim with an \"important letter\" to be given to a named person. That person would then ask the victim to take it to someone else, and so on. The letter when finally opened contained the words \"send the fool further\".\n\nIn Poland, \"prima aprilis\" (\"1 April\" in Latin) as a day of jokes is a centuries-long tradition. It is a day in which many jokes are told; various hoaxes – sometimes very sophisticated – are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the \"information\" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1st can be a lie, or a joke. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with Leopold I signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31. However, for some in Poland \"prima aprilis\" ends at noon of April 1st, and \"prima aprilis\" jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.\n\nDanes, Finns, Icelanders, Norwegians and Swedes celebrate April Fools' Day (\"aprilsnar\" in Danish; \"aprillipäivä\" in Finnish). Most news media outlets will publish exactly one false story on April 1; for newspapers this will typically be a first-page article but not the top headline.\n\nIn Italy, France, Belgium, The Netherlands, and French-speaking areas of Switzerland and Canada, April 1 tradition is often known as \"April fish\" (\"poissons d'avril\" in French, \"aprilvis\" in Dutch or \"pesce d'aprile\" in Italian). This includes attempting to attach a paper fish to the victim's back without being noticed. Such fish feature is prominently present on many late 19th- to early 20th-century French April Fools' Day postcards. Many newspapers also spread a false story on April Fish Day, and a subtle reference to a fish is sometimes given as a clue to the fact that it is an April fool's joke.\n\nIn India, there have been numerous references to April Fools' Day in both cinema and popular literature and people can enjoy references to the festivity on that day. However, April Fools' Day is not an intrinsic part of India's culture.\n\nIn Lebanon, an April Fool joke is revealed by shouting \"كذبة ابريل !\" (which means \"Aprils fool!\") at the recipient, who becomes the \"April fool\".\n\nIn many Spanish-speaking countries (and the Philippines), \"Dia de los Santos Inocentes\" (Holy Innocents Day) is a festivity which is very similar to the April Fools' Day, but it is celebrated in late December (27, 28 or 29 depending on the location, or January 10th for East Syrians).\n\nAs well as people playing pranks on one another on April Fools' Day, elaborate practical jokes have appeared on radio and TV stations, newspapers, websites, and have been performed by large corporations. In one famous prank from 1957, the BBC broadcast a film in their \"Panorama\" current affairs series purporting to show Swiss farmers picking freshly-grown spaghetti, in what they called the Swiss Spaghetti Harvest. The BBC were later flooded with requests to purchase a spaghetti plant, forcing them to declare the film a hoax on the news the next day. \n\nWith the advent of the Internet and readily available global news services, April Fools' pranks can catch and embarrass a wider audience than ever before.\nDecember 28, the equivalent day in Spain, Hispanic America and the Philippines, is also the Christian day of celebration of the \"Day of the Holy Innocents\". The Christian celebration is a holiday in its own right, a religious one, but the tradition of pranks is not, though the latter is observed yearly. After somebody plays a joke or a prank on somebody else, the joker usually cries out, in some regions of Hispanic America: \"Inocente palomita que te dejaste engañar\" (\"You innocent little dove that let yourself be fooled\"), not to be confused with the second translation of palomita, which is popcorn.\n\nIn Mexico, the phrase is \"¡Inocente para siempre!\" which means \"Innocent forever!\". In Argentina, the prankster says \"¡Que la inocencia te valga!\", which roughly translates as a piece of advice on not to be as gullible as the victim of the prank. In Spain, it is common to say just \"¡Inocente!\" (which in Spanish can mean \"Innocent!\", but also \"Gullible!\").\n\nIn Colombia, the term used is \"Pásala por Inocentes\", which roughly means: \"Let it go; today it's Innocent's Day.\"\n\nIn Belgium, this day is also known as the \"Day of the innocent children\" or \"Day of the stupid children\". It used to be a day where parents, grandparents, and teachers would fool the children in some way. But the celebration of this day has died out in favor of April Fools' Day.\n\nNevertheless, on the Spanish island of Menorca, \"Dia d'enganyar\" (\"Fooling day\") is celebrated on April 1 because Menorca was a British possession during part of the 18th century. In Brazil, the \"Dia da mentira\" (\"Day of the lie\") is also celebrated on April 1.\n\nIn Iran, on 13th of the first month (Farvardin) of the Iranian calendar (known as Nature's day or Sizdah Be-dar, 1st or 2nd of April), it is common that people spread false news and then shout \"Doroughe sizdah\" (lie of 13) to the victim. Some of the newspapers and journals also do the same and then somewhere in the bottom of page write \"Doroughe sizdah\" with inverse letters.\n\nThe practice of April Fool pranks and hoaxes is controversial. The mixed opinions of critics are epitomized in the reception to the 1957 BBC \"Spaghetti-tree hoax\", in reference to which, newspapers were split over whether it was \"a great joke or a terrible hoax on the public\".\n\nThe positive view is that April Fools' can be good for one's health because it encourages \"jokes, hoaxes...pranks, [and] belly laughs\", and brings all the benefits of laughter including stress relief and reducing strain on the heart. There are many \"best of\" April Fools' Day lists that are compiled in order to showcase the best examples of how the day is celebrated. Various April Fools' campaigns have been praised for their innovation, creativity, writing, and general effort.\n\nThe negative view describes April Fools' hoaxes as \"creepy and manipulative\", \"rude\" and \"a little bit nasty\", as well as based on \"schadenfreude\" and deceit. When genuine news or a genuine important order or warning is issued on April Fools' Day, there is risk that it will be misinterpreted as a joke and ignored – for example, when Google, known to play elaborate April Fools' Day hoaxes, announced the launch of Gmail with 1-gigabyte inboxes in 2004, an era when competing webmail services offered 4-megabytes or less, many dismissed it as a joke outright. On the other hand, sometimes stories intended as jokes are taken seriously. Either way, there can be adverse effects, such as confusion, misinformation, waste of resources (especially when the hoax concerns people in danger) and even legal or commercial consequences.\n\nPeople obeying hoax messages to telephone \"Mr.C.Lion\" and \"Mr.L.E.Fant\" and suchlike at a telephone number that turns out to be a zoo, sometimes cause a serious overload to zoos' telephone switchboards.\n\nOther examples of genuine news on April 1 mistaken as a hoax include:\n\nBooks, films, telemovies and television episodes have used April Fool's Day as their title or inspiration. Examples include Bryce Courtenay's novel \"April Fool's Day\" (1993), whose title refers to the day Courtenay's son died. The 1990s sitcom \"Roseanne\" featured an episode titled \"April Fools' Day\". This turned out to be intentionally misleading, as the episode was about Tax Day in the United States on April 15 – the last day to submit the previous year's tax information.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6273880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6273880", "title": "Backgammon opening theory", "text": "Backgammon opening theory\n\nThe first moves of a backgammon game are the opening moves, collectively referred to as the opening, and studied in the backgammon opening theory. Backgammon opening theory is not developed in as much detail as opening theory in chess, which has been widely studied. The reason for this is that following the first move in backgammon, there are 21 dice roll outcomes on each subsequent move, and many alternative plays for each outcome, making the tree of possible positions in backgammon expand much more rapidly than in chess.\n\nDespite the complications posed by this rapid branching of possibilities, over the course of many years, a consensus did develop among backgammon experts on what is the preferred opening move for each given roll. Following the emergence of self-trained backgammon-playing neural networks, the insights on what are the best opening moves have changed in some unexpected ways.\n\nThe table below summarizes the most commonly preferred moves, for each of the 15 possible opening rolls, as selected by detailed computer simulations, referred to as \"rollouts\".\nThere are no opening moves consisting of doubles, because at the start of the game, each player rolls one die. Whoever rolls higher moves first, using the numbers on the already-rolled dice. In the case of a tie, the players roll again.\nIn cases where no preferred play but only two or more alternative plays are given, these appear to be of equivalent strength within the statistical uncertainties of the simulations and no play could be singled out that is clearly superior.\n\nThe moves are captured in standard backgammon notation. For instance, 8/5 denotes the move of a piece from the 8-point to the 5-point.\n\nThe general message that emerges from the above table can be summarised as follows: unless one can make a point, and with the exception of the running move 24/13 (in which, having thrown a 6-5, the player moves a piece from the 24-point to the 13-point; the \"lover's leap\"), a successful play is often the combination of splitting the 24-point and moving a checker from the 13-point. The latter move should be as small as possible (resulting in a builder close to the 13-point), unless the stack at the 8-point can be reached (resulting in an equal distribution between the 13-point and the 8-point). However, there are plenty of exceptions to this rule; for example, a 4-3 or 3-2 is often best played by moving two checkers from the 13 point.\n\nThe above opening moves which emerged from computer analysis demonstrate that a number of opening moves that were unquestioned for many decades are now considered suboptimal. One example is the move 13/11-13/8 on the roll 5-2. Although not a bad move, the alternative choice preferred by the analyses, 24/22-13/8, is now generally agreed upon to be optimal. In other cases, computer analysis has resulted in alternative strategies that were not seriously considered in the past. For instance, the opening move 8/2-6/2 for a roll of 6-4 was in the past greeted with disdain from experts (making the 2-point instead of trying for a higher home point), but turns out to be on average as effective as the usual plays (24/14 and 24/18-13/9).\nThe opening moves above apply to money play, meaning that these plays optimise the expected payout with gammons counting double, etc. In match play the match score affects the checker play and one of the alternative plays may come out on top in computer simulations depending on the score. In a \"Gammon-go\" situation the player does not care about whether they lose a single game or a gammon, but they have much to gain from winning a gammon; thus they can benefit from aggressive openings. The opposite may be true in \"gammon-save\" situations, where the player has little to lose from losing a single game, but much to lose from losing a gammon. At double-match-point (DMP) where the score is tied with each player needing one point to win, gammons do not matter for either player.\n\nIn practice, an even more important influencing factor is the preferred style of the player. A player might have a strong preference for one out of a number of alternative opening plays that are on average as effective, because the character of the move (passive or aggressive) better suits his or her playing style.\n"}

The fire disaster claimed 92 lives and 300 others were injured. 56 of those killed, and many of those hurt, were school children.\n\nThe cause of the fire was speculated to be a discarded cigarette or an electric short circuit. The blaze erupted at the back gate as a three-hour matinee \nhad ended and the spectators were moving towards the exits. Apart from the spectators inside, another huge crowd was waiting outside the tent for the next show.\nThe flames quickly spread through the canvas top and wooden bleachers, whipped by strong winds. It took only 15 minutes for the fire to consume the tent, long before the first fire engines arrived. The 4000-seater spectator gallery was also destroyed during the fire. Help could not be sought immediately as the telephone lines were dead. Many of the female performers ran into the fire to save the children.\nNo animals were hurt as they were not inside the ring at the time, and employees pulled caged tigers and lions away from the blaze.

{"id": "34391290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34391290", "title": "Black Knight Sword", "text": "Black Knight Sword\n\n\"Black Knight Sword\" plays is a side-scrolling action game. Players control a character who takes on the identity of the Black Knight and his sword on their quest to defeat the White Princess. The game features a theater styled backdrop whereupon the character remains static as the backdrops change place to give the player a feeling of movement. \n\nThe player is armed with a magical sword used to dispatch foes, and the game also features elements of platforming. Hearts can be collected from fallen enemies, which in turn can be used in various in-game shops to purchase equipment and upgrades.\n\nThe game begins with a narrator stating \"The wormwood sways back and forth, embracing the wind\", as stage curtains open to reveal the set of a play, and the player character, Grahame Wormwood, having committed suicide by hanging himself in an empty bedroom. He sways back and forth to free himself from the noose around his neck, and what lies in front of him on the floor is a black suit of armor impaled with a sword, and a small, doll-like female character, known as Black Hellebore hovering above it. Black Hellebore then seems to inhabit the sword by phasing inside of it, and Grahame pulls the sword from the suit of armor. The black suit of armor then binds itself to Wormwood, as the play continues with Wormwood (now as the Black Knight), with the help of Black Hellebore, progressing through stage sets filled with hostile creatures, whom are often disembodied heads, other grotesque monstrosities, and wild animals.\n\nThe stage play is separated into and presented in 5 acts, with each act prefacing itself with fairy tale-like scenarios involving animals and their deaths. The animals in these stories serve as each act's finale. For example, one tale tells of a spider that saved a princess from entrapment, only to have been killed by her unassuming father upon her return. This spider then serves as the act's finale, with the Black Knight engaging it in battle. The narrator often tells the audience to \"beware\" before these encounters occur, and applauds the Black Knight when he defeats these creatures. This theme of Wormwood having to make his way past animals with seemingly unfortunate pasts continues until the play reaches its final act, which is prefaced with a story about two constantly bickering sisters. The story states that God disapproved of their arguing so much that He trapped the two inside of their own fairy tale, where they could bicker for the rest of eternity.\n\nAs the Black Knight makes his way to act 5's finale, the narrator (seemingly addressing the Black Knight himself) starts to question if he even remembers all the ones he's killed and loved. As color progressively fades from the set, the narrator continues to state that if they are forgotten, then there is \"nothing left.\"\n\nThe Black Knight then finds himself standing in front of the hanged Grahame Wormwood, whom he cuts from his noose with his sword. The room then fills with white flowers as a White Princess appears. The Black Knight taunts the Princess and engages her in battle. The White Princess appears ethereal as she floats around, telepathically chucking disembodied heads at the Black Knight and growing to an inhuman size. She then begins throwing eggs at the Black Knight which hatch into the disembodied heads and grotesque creatures he's already been facing throughout the play, where it's revealed that the White Princess was in control of these creatures all along. After The Black Knight defeats the White Princess (with invaluable help from Black Hellebore), her body dissipates and leaves a white suit of armor and white sword behind, as a small, white, doll-like character emerges; White Hellebore. Black Hellebore and White Hellebore are the two sisters mentioned in the prefacing tale, and true to the story, they start fighting each other as the Black Knight watches on. White Hellebore then animates the white suit of armor, and the White Knight appears and begins to attack the Black Knight.\n\nThe game concludes with a battle between the Black Knight and the White Knight on a stage set that's looking down at the Earth. After the White Knight and White Hellebore are defeated, the Black Knight and Black Hellebore then return to the initial bedroom set of the play, passing all of the previous sets along the way. Before entering the room, Black Hellebore removes herself from the sword the Black Knight is holding and flies away, as the sword and the armor dissipate completely, with Wormwood freed from the armor's binding. Wormwood then enters the bedroom and once again hangs himself. The narrator then reiterates the line \"The Wormwood sways back and forth, embracing the wind,\" and adds \"one day, the fields themselves will wither and fade. The wormwood forgotten by all,\" as the stage curtains close and the play comes to an end.\n\n\"Black Knight Sword\" was announced on August 17, 2011 at Gamescom. It was developed jointly by Grasshopper Manufacture and Digital Reality. The game is one of two collaborations between the two teams, the other being \"Sine Mora\", with Digital Reality publishing the game. In response to an interviewer's question regarding the collaboration, Director of Publishing Balázs Horváth simply stated that the two teams \"both know what makes a good game.\" A preview version was playable at Penny Arcade Expo (PAX) Prime 2011. It was also shown with a playable demo at PAX East 2012 in Boston, Massachusetts. Digital Reality has described the game as \"Monty Python meets Czech animation meets Japanese paper theater.\" Composer Akira Yamaoka called the game \"a throwback to the old-school classic side-scrolling action games.\" During early previews the game drew comparisons from critics to the \"Mega Man\", \"Strider\" and \"Castlevania\" series.\n\n\"Black Knight Sword\" received \"mixed or average reviews\" on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\nCritics praised the game's art style, with \"Eurogamer\" stating, \"Its richest ideas are to be found in the presentation, the aesthetic, the art direction and stage direction.\" Reviewers often criticized its gameplay, however. While Meristation praised the gameplay, stating, \"\"Black Knight Sword\" is a good return to the roots of the 16-bit action games, well crafted, with an amazing design\", other reviewers cited the game's difficulty as a point of contention. \"Joystiq\" wrote, \"Yes, [the PSN version's] Normal mode itself is tremendously hard, but not in such a way as to make the struggle seem worth it, or even remotely do-able.\"\n"}

Musically, the album has been described as \"sharply conceived dance-pop\" and it is noted to follow the \"hypnotizing electro-pop vein\" of the preceding album.\n\nA short film by the same name was released on 19 October 2018 to accompany the album.\n\nTove Lo's previous album, \"Lady Wood\", was released on 28 October 2016 to positive critical reviews and fair commercial success, with it eventually becoming her highest-charting album in the United States to date. In press interviews in support of the album's release, Tove Lo alluded to another album of thematically similar material slated for release the following year that was tentatively titled \"Lady Wood: Phase II\". In early 2017, Tove Lo began the Lady Wood Tour in further support of the album, and during press interviews she said she was working on new material to be included with the portion that was already recorded during the \"Lady Wood\" sessions.\n\nThe \"Blue Lips\" track \"Bitches\", originally titled \"What I Want for the Night (Bitches)\", was previewed through Tove Lo's short film \"Fairy Dust\" in October 2016 and a live version was released through Spotify in November 2016.

He is known for hosting CBS's \"The Price Is Right\" from 1972 to 2007, making it the longest-running daytime game show in North American television history. He is also known for hosting \"Truth or Consequences\" from 1956 to 1974.\n\nBorn in Darrington, Washington, to modest circumstances, Barker enlisted in the United States Navy during World War II. Barker worked part-time in radio while he attended college. In 1950, Barker moved to California in order to pursue a career in broadcasting. He was given his own radio show, \"The Bob Barker Show\", which ran for the next six years. Barker began his game show career in 1956, hosting \"Truth or Consequences\". From there, he hosted various game shows, as well as the Miss Universe and Miss USA pageants from 1967 to 1987, giving him the distinction of being the longest-serving host of these pageants. Eventually, he began hosting \"The Price Is Right\" in 1972. When his wife Dorothy Jo died, Barker became an advocate for animal rights and of animal-rights activism, supporting groups such as the United Activists for Animal Rights and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. In 2007, Barker retired from hosting \"The Price Is Right\" after celebrating his 50-year career on television.\n\nBarker was born on December 12, 1923, in Darrington, Washington, and spent most of his youth on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in Mission, South Dakota. The U.S. Indian Census Rolls, 1885–1940, list Barker as an official member of the Sioux tribe. His mother, Matilda (\"Tillie\") Valandra ( Matilda Kent Tarleton), was a school teacher; his father, Byron John Barker, was the foreman on the electrical high line through the state of Washington. Barker is 1/8 Sioux. While in Washington, his father fell from a tower and sustained an injury which resulted in his death in 1929. Barker has a half-brother, Kent Valandra, from Matilda's subsequent remarriage. In 1931, the family moved to Springfield, Missouri, where Barker graduated from Central High School in 1941.\n\nBarker attended Drury College (now Drury University) in Springfield, on a basketball scholarship. He was a member of the Epsilon Beta Chapter of Sigma Nu fraternity at Drury. On the outbreak of World War II, Barker served in the United States Navy as a fighter pilot. However, the war ended before he was assigned to a seagoing squadron. After the war, he returned to Drury to finish his education, graduating \"summa cum laude\" with a degree in economics.\n\nWhile attending college in Drury, Barker worked his first \"media job\", at KTTS-FM Radio, in Springfield. He and his wife left Springfield and moved to Lake Worth, Florida, and he was news editor and announcer at nearby WWPG 1340 AM in Palm Beach (now WPBR in Lantana). In 1950, Barker moved to California in order to pursue a career in broadcasting. He was given his own radio show, \"The Bob Barker Show\", which ran for the next six years from Burbank. He was hosting an audience-participation radio show on KNX (AM) in Los Angeles when game show producer Ralph Edwards happened to be listening and liked Barker's voice and style.\n\nBarker started hosting \"Truth or Consequences\" on December 31, 1956, and continued with the program until 1974. The idea was to mix the original quiz element of game shows with wacky stunts. On the show, people had to answer a trivia question correctly (usually an off-the-wall question that no one would be able to answer correctly) before \"Beulah the Buzzer\" was sounded. If the contestant did not complete the \"Truth\" portion, there was a \"Consequences\", usually a zany and embarrassing stunt. If the contestant answered the question, invariably, the question had a second part. In addition, during Barker's run as host, \"Barker's Box\" was played. Barker's Box was a box with four drawers in it. If a contestant was able to pick all three drawers with money inside before picking the empty drawer, they won a bonus prize.\n\nIt was on \"Truth or Consequences\" that the salute became his trademark sign-off; he ended each episode with \"Bob Barker saying goodbye, and hoping all your consequences are happy ones!\"\n\nOn December 4, 1957, Barker began hosting a new Ralph Edwards creation, the short-lived \"End of the Rainbow\" for NBC. On this show (similar to Barker's \"Truth or Consequences\" and Edwards' \"This Is Your Life\"), he and co-host Art Baker went out to various places in America and surprised the less-fortunate who helped others when they could barely help themselves.\n\nFor example, the first episode featured a Minneapolis grocer who, in return for his community service, was given a complete makeover to his store plus new furniture and appliances for his home. In addition, his landlord (who was in on the surprise) announced that the current month's rent was free and that the grocer's rent would never increase.\n\nIn 1967, Barker hosted the short-lived game show \"The Family Game\" for Chuck Barris, where he asked children contestants questions about their families' lives, and the parents had to guess how they answered, similar to \"The Newlywed Game\".\n\nIn 1971, Barker was tapped to host a pilot for NBC entitled \"Simon Says\", which required him to interact with a giant computer called \"Simon\" in \"Let's Make A Deal\"-style \"trades\". The pilot was produced by Wesley J. Cox of DUNDAS Productions, and its theme was \"The Savers\" (the theme used on \"The Joker's Wild\", which has led some to believe that Cox or DUNDAS was an alias for Jack Barry or Dan Enright, since \"Joker\" used the theme in its original 1968 pilot). There is at least one (somewhat low-quality) clip of the pilot on the video sharing website YouTube.\n\nIn 1980, Barker hosted a series called \"That's My Line\" for Goodson-Todman. The series was not a game show, but rather a program along the lines of \"Real People\" and \"That's Incredible!\" The show's second season in 1981 focused more on unusual stunts, and was cancelled in September.\n\nIn early 1972, Mark Goodson and Bill Todman began shopping a modernized revival of \"The Price Is Right\" to stations, with Dennis James as host. CBS expressed interest in the series, on one condition: instead of James, Barker would be installed as host. After some initial resistance, Barker instead offered to host another upcoming CBS game show, Jack Barry's \"The Joker's Wild\" (which had difficulty finding a host and was scheduled to debut the same day as \"Price\") to allow James to host \"Price\", but CBS rejected this proposal. The eventual compromise that was struck led to Barker hosting the daytime \"Price\" on CBS, James hosting the weekly nighttime \"Price\" in syndication, and Jack Barry himself (first on a trial basis, then eventually permanently) hosting \"Joker\".\n\nOn September 4, 1972, Barker began hosting the CBS revival of \"The Price Is Right\". In the 35 years of the CBS version, Barker became far more associated with the series than first host Bill Cullen was with the 1956–65 original. When James' contract for the nighttime \"Price\" expired without being renewed in 1977, Barker assumed hosting duties for three nighttime seasons as well, with the nighttime series eventually ending in 1980.\n\nOn October 15, 1987, Barker did what other MCs almost never did: renounced hair dye and began wearing his hair gray, which was its natural color by that time. Fellow hosts Monty Hall, Alex Trebek, and Richard Dawson did the same in the late 1980s.\n\nBarker took over the role of executive producer for the show in 1988, following the death of the original executive producer, Frank Wayne. In this capacity, Barker created several pricing games, instituted a prohibition on foreign cars and animal-based products (see \"Animal rights\" below), and launched a prime-time series of specials known as \"The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular\".\n\nIn September 2006, \"The Price Is Right\" marked its 35th consecutive year on the air. It is the longest-running game show of all time in North America, and at the time was the last surviving show in the daytime game show genre, having survived (at the time) twelve years after its last competitor had been canceled. (CBS later revived daytime game shows in 2009.) Overall, in daytime programming (excluding Saturday and Sunday), \"The Price Is Right\" is ranked sixth among the longest-continuing daytime television programs (NBC's \"Today\" ranks the longest, followed by four daytime soap operas: \"Guiding Light\", \"As the World Turns\", \"General Hospital\", and \"Days of Our Lives\"). It has won its time slot (11:00 a.m. Eastern) for the past 25 years with its closest competitor (currently ABC's \"The View\") normally getting about half of \"TPIR's\" ratings.\nOn October 31, 2006, Barker made his announcement that he would retire from \"The Price Is Right\" in June 2007. He taped his final episode on June 6, 2007, with the show airing twice on June 15. The first airing was in the show's normal daytime slot and the second airing was in primetime as the lead-in to the \"Daytime Emmy Awards\". Repeat episodes from Barker's final season continued to air until October 12, 2007. On July 23 it was announced that comedian Drew Carey would take Barker's place as the new host for the show beginning on October 15, 2007.\n\nDuring Barker's tenure as host, three pricing games were introduced that used his name: Barker's Bargain Bar, Barker's Marker$ and Trader Bob. Of the three, the latter two are not actively played on the show – Trader Bob was retired from the show in 1985, Barker's Marker$ was renamed Make Your Mark following Barker's retirement, and subsequently retired, and Barker's Bargain Bar has been retooled as the Bargain Game after a four-year hiatus between 2008 and 2012.\n\nAfter his retirement, Barker made three return appearances to \"The Price is Right\". He first appeared on the episode that aired on April 16, 2009 to promote his new autobiography, \"Priceless Memories\". He appeared in the Showcase round at the end of the show.\n\nBarker made another guest appearance on the show to celebrate his 90th birthday celebration, which aired on December 12, 2013. He announced a contestant for the first time ever on the show, along with one showcase.\n\nBarker also made a surprise appearance on April 1, 2015 for an April Fools' Day switch where he took Drew's place at the show's intro. He hosted the first one bid and pricing game of that day before handing the hosting duties back to Drew. He also appeared during the showcase of that episode.\n\nBarker married his high school sweetheart, Dorothy Jo Gideon, on January 12, 1945. They remained married for 36 years until her death, on October 19, 1981, from lung cancer. They had no children, and Barker has not remarried. However, he was involved in a relationship with \"Price\" model Dian Parkinson from 1989 to 1991, which ended in legal action.\n\nBarker has had some minor health problems. Around 1982, he had a herniated disc and sciatica. Greater health problems began in 1991 after he complained of vision problems while exercising. After a visit to his doctor, he was sent to see a neurologist, who told Barker he had had a mild stroke. He recovered and went back to work.\n\nOn September 16, 1999, Barker was in Washington, D.C., to testify before Congress regarding HR 2929: the Captive Elephant Accident Prevention Act, the proposed legislation that would ban elephants from traveling shows (i.e., circuses). While preparing for the presentation, Barker experienced what he called \"clumsiness\" in his right hand. He was admitted to George Washington University Hospital and diagnosed with a partially blocked left carotid artery. Barker underwent carotid endarterectomy to remove the blockage. The procedure went well enough that he was able to return to work within the month.\n\nThree years later, Barker had two additional health crises after taping the 30th-season finale of \"The Price is Right\". While lying in the sun on May 30, 2002, he experienced a stroke and was hospitalized; six weeks later, on July 11, Barker underwent prostate surgery. Both hospitalizations occurred at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C. Both surgeries were successful.\n\nBarker has had several mild bouts with skin cancer, a result of his frequent tanning. He consults a dermatologist regularly to make sure any cancers are caught and removed before they spread; they do not currently pose a threat to his life. During a televised interview, Barker told viewers, \"I urge anyone who has spent some time in the sun, whether you're doing it now or not, go to a dermatologist once a year.\"\n\nOn October 20, 2015, two police officers passing Barker's Los Angeles-area home saw him trip and fall on a sidewalk. They called an ambulance that brought him to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he received stitches for an injured forehead and was released; he also hurt his left knee.\n\nBarker slipped and hit his head at home on June 19, 2017. His maid drove him to the emergency room, where he was checked and released. His representative said it was not as serious as his earlier fall.\n\nIn 1994, former model Dian Parkinson filed a lawsuit against Barker alleging sexual harassment following a three-year affair while working on \"The Price Is Right\". Parkinson, who alleged that she was extorted by threats of firing, later dropped her lawsuit, claiming the stress from the ordeal was damaging her health.\n\nIn 1995, model Holly Hallstrom left \"The Price Is Right\" and later filed suit against Barker for wrongful termination and malicious persecution claiming Barker had launched a media attack against her, allegedly stating that she was disruptive to the working atmosphere of the show. Barker dropped his case, but Hallstrom did not, finally ending in settlement in 2005.\n\nFollowing their testimonies in Barker's failed lawsuit against Hallstrom, models Janice Pennington and Kathleen Bradley were fired, and later received out-of-court financial settlements. Director Paul Alter was removed from the show in 2000. Production assistants Sherrill Paris and Sharon Friem, who were also dismissed at the same time, each sued Barker for wrongful termination, as well as sexual harassment and sex discrimination. Both women ultimately received financial settlements.\n\nIn October 2007, Deborah Curling, a CBS employee assigned to \"The Price Is Right\", filed a lawsuit against CBS, Bob Barker and \"The Price Is Right\" producers, claiming that she was forced to quit her job after testifying against Barker in a wrongful-termination lawsuit brought by a previous show producer. Curling claimed that she was demoted to an \"intolerable work environment\" backstage which caused her to leave the job. Curling, who is black, also alleged that the show's producers, including Barker, created a hostile work environment in which black employees and contestants were discriminated against. A few months later, Barker was removed from the lawsuit, and in September 2009, the lawsuit was dismissed. Curling's attorney stated that he planned to appeal the dismissal of the lawsuit. In January 2012, the California Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal.\n\nBarker became a vegetarian in 1979. That same year, he began promoting animal rights. He was named national spokesman for \"Be Kind to Animals Week\" in May 1985. On A&E's \"Biography\" program, he credited his wife, Dorothy Jo, with causing him to become more aware of animal rights and to become a vegetarian, because she had done so. Bob remarked that Dorothy Jo was way ahead of her time in recognizing the rights of animals and that shortly after her death in October 1981 he took up animal rights in order to keep doing something that she had done.\n\nBarker began ending some episodes (later every episode) of \"The Price Is Right\" with the phrase: \"This is Bob Barker reminding you to help control the pet population — have your pets spayed or neutered.\" After Barker retired, Drew Carey continued his signature sign-off advocating neutering. Fellow game-show hosts Jack Barry and Bert Convy eventually followed Barker's lead in promoting animal rights on the air.\n\nBarker hosted the Miss USA/Universe Pageants from 1967 to 1987. In 1987, he requested the removal of fur prizes and stepped down as host when those in charge of the pageant refused.\n\nBarker's DJ&T Foundation, founded in 1994 and named after his late wife and mother, has contributed millions of dollars for animal neutering programs and to fund animal rescue and park facilities all over the United States. He worked closely with Betty White as an advocate for animal rights. However, in 2009, reports indicated that Barker threatened to not attend the 2009 Game Show Awards, where he was to receive a lifetime achievement award, because White would be attending. The reason for the conflict, according to the report, was over the proper treatment of an elephant at the Los Angeles Zoo. White instead did not attend and pre-recorded her comments that she was scheduled to make about Mark Goodson.\n\nIn 2004, Barker donated $1 million to Columbia University School of Law to support the study of animal rights. The gift has funded an adjunct professorship in animal rights law at Columbia and helped fund a student clinic in environmental law.\n\nBarker also supported United Activists for Animal Rights, and together with the group, publicly accused several media projects and the American Humane Association of animal mistreatment or the condoning of animal mistreatment, a tactic which resulted in a major lawsuit against him and the group, accusing him of spurious allegations.\n\nIn June 2009, Barker wrote Chief Michell Hicks of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians asking that their reservation's bear exhibit be closed. On July 28, 2009, he visited the reservation and saw one of the three zoos, calling the bears' living situation \"inhumane\". PETA set up the visit after Barker heard from U.S. Representative Bill Young, (R) Florida, whose wife had been \"appalled\" by what she saw. Annette Tarnowski, the tribe's attorney general, said a federal inspector had found nothing wrong in May 2009 at two of the zoos, and that the tribe had dealt with the few violations at the third. Hicks made no promises and threatened to ban PETA if they made more trouble.\n\nIn January 2010, Sea Shepherd Conservation Society announced that it had secretly purchased and outfitted a ship to interdict Japanese whaling operations in the Southern Ocean using $5,000,000 provided by Barker. The ship was then named the MY \"Bob Barker\", and its existence was first revealed when it helped discover the location of the Japanese whaling fleet. In 2010, Barker began funding the cost of a helicopter, named the Nancy Burnet (after the president of United Activists for Animal Rights); the helicopter accompanies the society's fleet.\n\nIn March 2010, PETA announced that it received a $2.5 million donation from Barker to help establish a new office called the Bob Barker Building in Los Angeles. PETA officially opened the Bob Barker Building on Sunset Boulevard in 2012. The Grand Opening was attended by Christian Serratos, Stephanie Pratt, Moby, Kate del Castillo, Sasha Grey, Renee Olstead, Fivel Stewart, Diane Warren, and Allisyn Ashley Arm.\n\n\n\nBob Barker has written his autobiography, assisted by former \"L.A. Times\" book review editor Digby Diehl, titled \"Priceless Memories\". It was published on April 6, 2009, and features stories from his early life as well as stories and experiences in the 50 years of his television career.\n\nIt was also then reported that Barker would appear on \"The Price Is Right\" to promote his book. His initial appearance was scheduled for the March 2, 2009, taping. However, the taping was postponed until March 25, due to host Drew Carey's bout with pneumonia. The episode aired on April 16, during which Barker appeared during the Showcases to promote the book. Carey stated in an interview that the show stopped taping for over an hour as the crowd continued to give Barker a standing ovation, and to allow the audience to ask questions about what Barker was doing during his retirement.\n\n"}

Although the Court has never allowed cameras in its courtroom, it does make audiotapes of oral arguments and opinions available to the public.\n\nIn 2009, Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter and seven co-sponsors introduced a resolution to express the sense of Congress that sessions of the Court should be televised. In 2009, Specter also introduced a bill that would require open sessions of the Court to be televised. Upon introducing his bill to require televising the Supreme Court of the United States proceedings, Arlen Specter announced, \"[t]he Supreme Court makes pronouncements on constitutional and federal law that have direct impacts on the rights of Americans. Those rights would be substantially enhanced by televising the oral arguments of the Court so that the public can see and hear the issues presented.\" Eight U.S. Senators co-sponsored Spector's resolution.\n\nTed Poe, R-TX2, introduced a related bill in the House of Representatives in January 2009. The only exception to televising the Court under this legislation would be if a majority of justices decided that \"allowing such coverage in a particular case would violate the due process rights of any of the parties involved.\"\n\nSupporters of Specter's proposal reason that other government proceedings are already televised, including sessions of both the House of Representative and the Senate, covered most frequently by C-SPAN. By televising the Court, they argue that Americans would have more access to the most important institution in the U.S. judiciary, which would result in a more open and transparent government. Bruce Peabody of Fairleigh Dickinson University contends that televising the Supreme Court of the United States proceedings can change the way Americans view public policy by bringing greater attention to the Court. A 2010 New York Times editorial states that public access to the court would give Americans the opportunity to get a closer look at how a powerful branch of government operates. It adds that the televising the Court would hold presidents accountable for the justices they nominate. The editorial reasons, \"[r]ight now, we see the justices during their confirmation hearings and rarely after that.\"\n\nDuring her confirmation hearing in 2009, Justice Sonia Sotomayor indicated that she is open to the idea of televising court proceedings, stating, \"I have had positive experiences with cameras. When I have been asked to join experiments of using cameras in the courtroom, I have participated. I have volunteered.\" \n\nOpponents of Specter's proposal believe that requiring the proceedings of the Supreme Court of the United States to be televised is a threat to judicial independence and, thus, the separation of powers. In addition, several justices of the Court have objected to the proposed legislation, including Justice Anthony Kennedy who argues that the measure would not align with the \"etiquette\" and \"deference\" that should \"apply between branches.\" Furthermore, some justices believe televising the proceedings would change the way they act in the courtroom. Justice Clarence Thomas also contends that televising Court proceedings would reduce the level of anonymity that justices now have and could raise security concerns. Opponents also believe that television coverage would also take away from the mystery of the court and cause the public to misinterpret the Court and its processes.\n\nScholars have also considered the constitutionality of televising the Supreme Court.\n\nIn March 2010, Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind Poll found in a national poll that more than 60% of voters think that televising the Supreme Court of the United States proceedings would be \"good for democracy.\" 26% think that televising the proceedings would \"undermine the authority of the court.\" \n\nVoters have mixed opinions on the effect of television coverage on court decisions. While 45% say that televising Court's proceedings would be good \"because the judges would consider public opinion more\" in making decisions, 31% say TV would be bad because justices would consider public opinion \"too much.\" 25% say are not sure or say that televising the Court would have no effect on its legal decisions. While a majority of voters presently watch government proceedings infrequently if at all, half of voters (50%) say they would watch the Supreme Court of the United States' proceedings sometimes or regularly if they were televised. Only 10% say they’d never watch the court.\n\nDr. Peter Woolley, director of the FDU poll, said, “Voters are certainly curious about the court, which is both powerful and largely out of the public eye. After the novelty wears off, the primary audience might be lawyers and lobbyists, rather than any broad swath of voters. Most voters will only see it when commercial media select the most controversial bits and pieces.” But Peabody disagreed, “The rationale for televising the court is not to guarantee the public will watch it, but to give democracy’s citizens more opportunities to educate themselves. It is unlikely people will know more about the court by seeing it less.” \n\nNoting the FDU poll, the editors of \"The New York Times\" subsequently opined that televising the Court \"would allow Americans to see for themselves how an extremely powerful part of their government works\" and \"allow voters to hold presidents accountable for the quality of justices they nominate. In turn, Diana Schaub of Loyola University criticized the \"Times\" for insisting that the justices of the Supreme Court ought to be “YouTubed” like everyone else. She contends that the Court is already an open book, the most transparent branch of government. Rather than issuing only a verdict, Schaub states, the Court justifies its rulings with detailed opinions that are immediately available to the public. She further notes that only a small slice of the Court’s work would be revealed on camera if televising oral arguments were required, adding that the “un-telegenic activities” of the Court, which include choosing cases, poring over briefs, writing memos and drafts, and actually deciding cases would not be seen. Furthermore, Schaub declares that the only way for the public to truly have access to the Court is to “join the justices in the difficult work of legal interpretation.” She states that most Americans would not be willing or even capable of doing this.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23450634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23450634", "title": "Dear Esther", "text": "Dear Esther\n\nDear Esther is a first-person exploration and adventure video game developed by The Chinese Room for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. First released in 2008 as a free-to-play modification for the Source game engine, the game was entirely redeveloped for a commercial release in 2012. Spurning traditional game design, \"Dear Esther\" features no puzzles or tasks. The player's only objective is to explore an unnamed island in the Hebrides, listening to a troubled man read a series of letters to his deceased wife. Details of her mysterious death are revealed as the player moves throughout the island.\n\n\"Dear Esther\" was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 20 September 2016 and re-released for PC/Mac 14 February 2017 under the name \"Dear Esther: Landmark Edition\". A spiritual successor, titled \"Everybody's Gone to the Rapture\", was released for PlayStation 4 in August 2015 and for Microsoft Windows in April 2016.\n\nThe \"gameplay\" in \"Dear Esther\" is minimal, the only object being to explore an uninhabited Hebridean island, listening to an anonymous man read a series of letter fragments to a woman named Esther. The letters suggest that Esther was his wife and that she is dead, killed in a car crash. As the player reaches a new location on the island, the game plays a new letter fragment relating to that area. Different fragments are played in each playthrough of the game, revealing different aspects of the story each time. Several other unseen characters are referred to by the narrator: a man named Donnelly, who charted the island in the past; Paul, who is suggested to be the drunk driver in the accident in which Esther died; and a shepherd named Jakobson who lived on the island in the 18th century. As the player explores the island, they find the derelict remains of buildings, a shipwreck, and a cave system whose walls are adorned with images resembling chemical diagrams, circuit diagrams, neurons and bacteria. At various points a figure is seen walking away from the player in the distance, but disappears before they can be reached. The identities of the characters become more blurred as the game progresses, as the narration moves between topics and relates the characters in different ways. The ambiguity of the randomly played letter fragments forces the player to draw their own conclusions of the story.\n\nAt the game's end, the player reaches the radio mast atop the island's peak and climbs a ladder to the top of the tower during a final monologue by the narrator. As the player jumps off and falls to the shore below, their shadow becomes that of a bird. The player soars through the island's bay before flying low over an array of paper boats in the water—the many letters the narrator had written to Esther.\n\nThe original rendition of \"Dear Esther\" was one of several modifications (mods) developed by The Chinese Room while the studio was still a research project at the University of Portsmouth. The project was funded by a grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Council and led by Dan Pinchbeck, a professor and lecturer at the university. The story and script were composed by Pinchbeck, who cited the works of William S. Burroughs as influential in the writing: \"... looking at the way William Burroughs worked structurally was a big influence, but also I was really interested in moving towards a quite image-heavy, symbolic, poetic use of language rather than the normal descriptive tone we find in games.\"\n\nIndependent games artist Robert Briscoe began work on completely redeveloping \"Dear Esther\" in 2009, with the full support of Pinchbeck. Briscoe and The Chinese Room worked in parallel on the game's remake, with much of the level design completed solely by Briscoe based on concept art done by Ben Andrews. In redesigning the island's landscape, Briscoe aimed to eliminate the confusion caused by the original game's lay-out, and to fill out the environment with \"richer, visually interesting\" features to improve on the barren landscape of the original mod. In March 2011, while the game was still in development, The Chinese Room lost the financial backing of the University it had hitherto relied on. The studio had banked on the University to pay for the Source Engine license needed for a commercial release of the game, but the University's legal department was dissatisfied with the license agreement and refused to sign it. The Chinese Room turned to the Indie Fund for finances, who were hesitant at first but after playing a demo, agreed to fund the project. The Fund's Ron Carmel stated \"As soon as people started playing it, the tone of the conversation just completely shifted, and people were very much in favor of supporting this project\". Within six hours of the remastered release on Steam, over 16,000 units had been sold, allowing the developers to pay back the full Indie Fund investment.\n\nRobert Briscoe announced in a blog post, on 14 February 2014, that he had begun porting \"Dear Esther\" to the Unity Engine two months prior to this announcement. He has cited an abandoned native Linux port, escalating bugs in the Mac OS X port, spiraling additional licensing costs of the Source Engine to be some of the reasons behind the move to the Unity Engine. Development plans include \"a solid, high quality, Linux and Mac build, and then eventually PC\" and beta releases for existing Humble Store and Humble Bundle customers to evaluate and test. He also mentions that the development is still experimental and that there will not be any Steam or other build replacements until the team are satisfied with the quality of this port. In another blog post, on 11 March 2014, announcing his employment with Valve Corporation, Robert also mentions that the bulk of the port has been completed, with just a little of the back-end and scripting development remaining and that he should be able to finish the port in his spare time with ease.\n\nThe voice of \"Dear Esther\"s narrator was performed by Nigel Carrington, whose script was extended for the remake. The game's music was composed by Jessica Curry, a freelance music composer and co-director of The Chinese Room. In the remake's development, Curry overhauled and re-orchestrated the score to be fuller and longer, featuring more instruments and reaching nearly double the length of the original soundtrack. The music of the original game was released for free on 8 July 2008, shortly after the mod itself was released, and the remastered soundtrack was released on 14 February 2012, via Amazon.com, iTunes, and Bandcamp.\n\nThe original mod release of \"Dear Esther\" was selected for the Animation Exhibition at the 2008 Prix Ars Electronica and made the Top 100 of Mod DB's Mod of the Year 2008. In 2009, the game won the award for Best World/Story at the IndieCade Independent Game awards.\n\nReviewing the mod for Honest Gamers in 2009, Lewis Denby praised the game's original tone, saying that the game \"taps into an emotion that few games dare to approach: \"un\"happiness\" and stated that Curry's soundtrack created \"an impressively ethereal atmosphere\". Despite commendations for its premise and story, the original mod release received complaints of poor level design and numerous glitches in moving about the terrain.\n\nThe 2012 remastered \"Dear Esther\" has garnered mainly positive reviews from critics, receiving an average score of 71.29% based on 28 reviews and 75/100 based on 37 reviews on review aggregators GameRankings and Metacritic. Despite questioning whether it truly constitutes a video game, reviewers praised the game's originality and commented favourably on the emphasis on the story; IGN stated that the game \"will leave you feeling edified, contemplative, and possibly even emotionally moved.\" Strategy Informer awarded the game 9/10, calling it \"one of the most haunting and well-executed titles of this or any other generation.\" However, critics were divided by the suitability of the video game medium for conveying the story of \"Dear Esther\". Maxwell McGee of GameSpot claimed that \"[the] story in \"Dear Esther\" works well in video game form—possibly more than as a book or movie.\" McGee went further to claim that \"video games allow for pacing and discovery that would be impossible to reproduce elsewhere.\" Reviewing for Destructoid, Allistair Pinsof claimed the opposite, stating that the game \"would be better as a short film\", although doubted whether \"if \"Dear Esther\" were a short film, if its vague plot and predictable conclusion would be effective.\" Eurogamer also offered criticism of the plot, calling the writing \"purple in places and wantonly obscure in ways which will draw accusations of pretentiousness\", and joked that \"the [game's] tendency to deploy extended car metaphors occasionally steers the writing into oncoming traffic.\" However, the review commended the lasting impact of the story, stating that \"its two-hour long chill will remain in your bones for a long while after.\"\n\nThe limited interactivity between the player and the narrative in \"Dear Esther\" also divided reviewers. Pinsof stated that \"[the] ironic thing is that the most pedestrian of stories can be convincing when coupled with intelligently applied interaction—something \"Dear Esther\" stubbornly stands against.\" PC Gamer did not find the basic gameplay to be a problem, stating that “the lack of puzzles is necessary: it’s crucial to the experience that you’re allowed to keep moving at your own pace. […] Without puzzles, the visuals and narrative are allowed to take precedence.”\n\nThe level of detail in \"Dear Esther\"s environment was given broad praise by critics. Reviewing for bit-tech, Joe Martin called the game \"a graphical masterpiece\", commenting that \"what gives \"Dear Esther\"s visuals such a poignant edge is how masterfully it extends the sense of loneliness and isolation that's conveyed in the script\". Writing for \"The Daily Telegraph\", Tom Hoggins noted the effect of the game's more minor details, stating that \"[the] broad strokes of \"Dear Esther's\" visuals are majestic, but the finer details on the landscape are the most revealing.\"\n\nAt the 2012 Independent Games Festival, \"Dear Esther\" received the prize for \"Excellence in Visual Arts\". In its 2012 Awards, \"Develop\" awarded \"Dear Esther\" the prize for \"Best use of narrative\". At the TIGA Games Industry Awards 2012, the game won the \"Originality Award\" along with the prizes for \"Best Action/Adventure game\", \"Best Visual Design\", \"Best Audio Design\" and \"Best Debut Game\". The game was nominated for five awards in the 9th British Academy Video Games Awards.\n\nAs of September 2013, the game had sold over 850,000 copies.\n\n\n"}

In jazz, such a group of twelve players is sometimes called a \"twelvetet\". The corresponding German word is duodezett. The French equivalent form, douzetuor, is virtually unknown (in sharp contrast to \"dixtuor\", the French word for decet). Unlike some other musical ensembles such as the string quartet, there is no established or standard set of instruments in a duodecet.\n\nOf the ensemble types named according to the number of musicians in the group, the decet, undecet, duodecet, tredecet, etc., are names less common in music than smaller groupings (quartet, quintet, etc., up to nonet). In the eighteenth century, twelve-part ensembles were most often encountered in the genre of the wind serenade, divertimento, nocturne, or partita—for example, Josef Reicha's \"Parthia ex D\", for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 3 horns, 2 bassoons, and double bass, and the partitas for the same instrumentation by Reicha's colleague Johann Georg Feldmayr . In fact, the titles \"serenade\" and \"suite\" continue through the 19th century to be the preferred term for ensembles of twelve or thirteen instruments, especially winds (e.g., Wilhelm Berger's op. 102 for 12 winds, Felix Mendelssohn's op. 24 for 11 or 12 winds, Max Reger's Serenade for 12 winds, or Richard Strauss's opp. 4 and 7, for 13 winds). The word \"duodecet\" remains rare as a genre title in the 20th century (exceptions are found amongst the works of Polish composers Barbara Buczek and Bogusław Schaeffer), where works for twelve instruments or singers most often are given either a true title, or a genre title describing the form (e.g., \"concertino\", \"suite\", \"variations\"), often followed by a designator such as \"for twelve instruments\".\n\nThe three \"twelve-part inventions\", variations 3 (12 solo violins), 5 (10 violas and 2 double basses), and 11 (12 wind instruments), in Stravinsky's \"Variations: Aldous Huxley in memoriam\" (1963–64) have been designated \"duodecets\" by his biographer Eric Walter White (; ).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24259845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24259845", "title": "Euro War", "text": "Euro War\n\nEuro War, also known as Macaroni Combat, Macaroni War, Spaghetti Combat, or Spaghetti War, is a broad subgenre of war film that emerged in the mid-1960s, so named because most were produced and directed by European co-productions, and most notably by Italians.\n\nThe typical team was made up of an Italian director, Italo-Spanish technical staff, and a cast of Italian and Spanish actors and sometimes German and French, sometimes a minor or fading Hollywood star. The films were primarily shot in Europe and later, the Philippines.\n\nFrom the mid-1960s much like the Italian spaghetti western, the Macaroni Combat film mimicked the success of American films such as \"The Dirty Dozen\" and \"Where Eagles Dare\". Like spaghetti westerns, Euro War films were characterized by their production in the Italian language, low budgets, added violence, and a recognizable highly fluid and minimalist cinematography. This was partly intentional and partly the context and cultural background of the filmmakers. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s the films were almost all set during World War II with a few about mercenaries in Africa following the success of \"Dark of the Sun\" and later, \"The Wild Geese\".

These issues are often highly valued by collectors due to their rarity and iconic status.\n\nCollectors value first appearances for their rarity and historical value, while many regular readers are interested in viewing how their favorite characters were originally portrayed. Reprints of first appearances are often published, both as single comic books and in trade paperbacks, usually with other early appearances of the character. Marvel Comics' \"Essential\" line has become popular by giving readers an affordable glimpse into characters' early history.\n\nHistorically, first appearances tell the origin story for the character, although some, such as Batman and Green Goblin, remained dubious figures for several issues. Modern writers prefer to tell a character’s origin across an entire story arc or keep a newly introduced character mysterious until a \"secret origin\" issue. Some fans consider this a gimmick and prefer the older method.\n\nThe artistic merit of many first appearances is debatable. The events portrayed in most famous first appearances are continuously retconed, rebooted and/or expanded upon by subsequent writers. Like many golden and silver age comics, first appearances often become dated and do not fit the modern portrayal of the character.\n\nHowever, some first appearances are considered classics. 1990s-era Spider-Man writer Howard Mackie said that his favorite story featuring the character was his first appearance and origin story in \"Amazing Fantasy\" #15 (August 1962), stating that writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko \"gave us everything we needed, I wanted or could ask for in the least possible space. Every single person who retells the origin never improves on the original, they simply expand it.\"\n\nFirst appearances of popular characters are among the most valuable comic books in existence. Of the \"ten most valuable comic books\" listed in the spring 2002 issue of \"The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide\", seven are first appearances of popular superheroes. Another, \"Marvel Comics\" #1 (October 1939), is the first appearance of the Golden Age Human Torch but is more noteworthy as the first comic book published by industry giant Marvel Comics.\n\nIt can take many years for a character to attain sufficient popularity after their first appearance to be considered \"iconic.\" By the point a character reaches that level of popularity, it is common for few copies of their first appearance issues to remain. Furthermore, even fewer of those remaining copies will be in the pristine condition prized by collectors. What few remain can be worth thousands of dollars to interested collectors. For example, in 2004, a copy of \"Flash Comics\" #1 (January 1940), the first appearance of The Flash, was auctioned for $42,000 and a copy of \"Captain America Comics\" #1 (March 1941), the first appearance of Captain America sold for $64,400. In 2010, another copy of \"Flash Comics\" #1 sold privately for $450,000.\n\nThe first appearance of Superman, \"Action Comics\" #1 (June 1938), has been regarded as the \"holy grail\" of comic books, due to its cultural significance and rarity (fewer than one hundred copies are thought to exist). Superman is widely considered to have solidified, if not created, the superhero archetype; therefore, his first appearance is not only important to fans of the character but to fans of superheroes and comic books as a whole. Well-preserved copies of \"Action\" \"Comics\" #1 have been sold at auction for record-breaking prices. A copy graded at 8.0 (\"very fine\") on the 10-point scale typically used by collectors was sold at auction for $1,000,000 in 2010. Even a copy graded at a much lower 5.5 (\"fine minus\") sold for $956,000 in 2016.\n\nShortly after the record-breaking million-dollar sale of \"Action Comics\" #1 in 2010, a copy of \"Detective Comics\" #27 featuring the first appearance of Batman was sold for $1,075,000 in a Heritage auction.\n\nSeveral factors determine the value of a first appearance. Note: All values are according to ComicsPriceGuide.com and are for editions certified by the Certified Collectibles Group (see below):\n\nWhile seemingly a simple concept, determining the first appearance may be complex. The following are instances in which a character’s first appearance may be difficult to determine:\n\nNote: All values are according to \"Comics Price Guide.\" Prices given are for the best available editions. Thus prices of Golden Age comics are for editions in \"fine\" condition because editions in better condition for such old comics are either extremely rare or have never been confirmed to exist. Prices for Silver Age and subsequent comics are for \"very fine\" editions. Priced are also for editions graded by the Certified Collectibles Group. Data is correct .\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36425475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36425475", "title": "Genesis flood narrative", "text": "Genesis flood narrative\n\nThe Genesis flood narrative is a flood myth found in the Tanakh (chapters 6–9 in the Book of Genesis). The story tells of God's decision to return the Earth to its pre-creation state of watery chaos and then remake it in a reversal of creation. The narrative has very strong similarities to parts of the Epic of Gilgamesh which predates the Book of Genesis.\n\nScientists have unsuccessfully attempted to reconcile the flood narrative with physical findings in geology and palaeontology. Flood geology is considered to be pseudoscientific.\n\nThe flood is part of what scholars call the Primeval history, the first 11 chapters of Genesis. These chapters, fable-like and legendary, form a preface to the patriarchal narratives which follow, but show little relationship to them. For example, the names of its characters and its geography - Adam (\"Man\") and Eve (\"Life\"), the Land of Nod (\"Wandering\"), and so on - are symbolic rather than real, and much of the narratives consist of lists of \"firsts\" - the first murder, the first wine, the first empire-builder. Most notably, almost none of the persons, places and stories in it are ever mentioned anywhere else in the Bible. This has led scholars to suppose that the History forms a late composition attached to Genesis to serve as an introduction. Just how late is a subject for debate: at one extreme are those who see it as a product of the Hellenistic period, in which case it cannot be earlier than the first decades of the 4th century BCE; on the other hand the Yahwist source has been dated by others, notably John Van Seters, to the exilic pre-Persian period (the 6th century BCE), precisely because the Primeval History contains so much Babylonian influence in the form of myth.\n\nThe flood narrative is made up of two stories woven together. As a result many details are contradictory, such as how long the flood lasted (40 days according to Genesis 7:17, 150 according to 7:24), how many animals were to be taken aboard the ark (one pair of each in 6:19, one pair of the unclean animals and seven pairs of the clean in 7:2), and whether Noah released a raven which \"went to and fro until the waters were dried up\" or a dove which on the third occasion \"did not return to him again,\" or possibly both. Despite this disagreement on details the story forms a unified whole (some scholars see in it a \"chiasm\", a literary structure in which the first item matches the last, the second the second-last, and so on), and many efforts have been made to explain this unity, including attempts to identify which of the two sources was earlier and therefore influenced the other.\n\nThe flood myth originated in Mesopotamia. The Mesopotamian story has three distinct versions, the Sumerian Epic of Ziusudra, and as episodes in two works in Akkadian (the language of Babylon), the Atrahasis Epic and the Epic of Gilgamesh. The oldest written text is the Ziusudra epic, dating from about 1600 BCE.\n\nNoah was a righteous man and walked with God. Seeing that the earth was corrupt and filled with violence, God instructed Noah to build an ark in which he, his sons, and their wives, together with male and female of all living creatures, would be saved from the waters. Noah entered the ark in his six hundredth year, and on the 17th day of the 2nd month of that year \"the fountains of the Great Deep burst apart and the floodgates of heaven broke open\" and rain fell for forty days and forty nights until the highest mountains were covered 15 cubits, and all life perished except Noah and those with him in the ark. \n\nIn Jewish legend, the kind of water that was pouring to the earth for forty days is not the common, but God bade each drop pass through Hell of Gehenna before it fell to earth, and the 'hot rain' scalded the skin of the sinners. The punishment that overtook them was befitting their crime. As their sensual desires had made them hot, and inflamed them to immoral excesses, so they were chastised by means of heated water.\n\nAfter 150 days \"God remembered Noah ... and the waters subsided\" until the ark rested on the mountains of Ararat. On the 27th day of the 2nd month of Noah's six hundred and first year the earth was dry. Then Noah built an altar and made a sacrifice, and God made a covenant with Noah that man would be allowed to eat every living thing but not its blood, and that God would never again destroy all life by a flood.\n\nThe flood is a reversal and renewal of God's creation of the world. In Genesis 1 God separates the \"waters above the earth\" from those below so that dry land can appear as a home for living things, but in the flood story the \"windows of heaven\" and \"fountains of the deep\" are opened so that the world is returned to the watery chaos of the time before creation. Even the sequence of flood events mimics that of creation, the flood first covering the earth to the highest mountains, then destroying, in order, birds, cattle, beasts, \"swarming creatures\", and finally mankind. (This, incidentally, mirrors the Babylonian flood story in the Epic of Gilgamesh, where at the end of rain \"all of mankind had returned to clay,\" the substance of which they had been made).\nThe ark itself is likewise a microcosm of Solomon's Temple.\n\n\"Intertextuality\" means the way episodes in the biblical books refer to and echo each other. Such echoes are seldom coincidental - for example, the word used for Noah's ark is the same used for the basket in which Moses is saved, implying a link between the stories of Moses and Noah, both of them divinely chosen saviours in a world threatened by water and chaos. The most significant such echo is with the Genesis creation narrative: the division between the \"waters above\" and the \"waters below\" the earth is removed, the flood covers the dry land, all life is destroyed, and only Noah and those with him survive to obey the divine command to \"be fruitful and multiply.\"\n\nThe Genesis flood narrative is included in the Old Testament of the Christian Bible (see Books of the Bible). Jesus and the apostles additionally taught on the Genesis flood narrative in New Testament writing (Matt 24:37-39, Luke 17:26-27, 1 Peter 3:20, 2 Peter 2:5, 2 Peter 3:6, Hebrews 11:7). Some Christian biblical scholars suggest that the flood is a picture of salvation in Christ - the ark was planned by God and there is only one way of salvation through the door of the ark, akin to one way of salvation through Christ. Additionally, some scholars commenting on the teaching of the apostle Peter (1 Peter 3:18-22), connect the ark with the resurrection of Christ; the waters burying the old world but raising Noah to a new life. Christian scholars also highlight that 1 Peter 3:18-22 demonstrates the Genesis flood as a type to Christian baptism. \n\nIn the Catholic Church, literalist belief in Noah's ark and the flood narrative is neither required, nor forbidden. However, Catholic schools almost always teach evolution in science classes.\n\nIn Protestant churches more variability is found, and many, but by no means all, denominations teach a literalist stance. \n\nThe Quran states that Noah (Nūḥ) was inspired by God, believed in the oneness of God, and preached Islam. God commanded Noah to build an ark. As he was building it, the chieftains passed him and mocked him. Upon its completion, the ark was loaded with the animals in Noah's care as well as his immediate household. The people who denied the message of Noah, including one of his own sons, drowned. The final resting place of the ark was referred to as Mount Judi.\n\nAccording to the Yazidi \"Mishefa Reş\", two flood events occurred. The first flood involved Noah and his family, whose ark landed at a place called Ain Sifni in the region of Nineveh Plains, north-east of Mosul. In the second flood, the Yazidi race was preserved in the person of Na'mi (or Na'umi), surnamed Malik Miran, who became the second founder of their race. His ark was pierced by a rock as it floated above Mount Sinjar, but settled in the same location as in Islamic tradition, Mount Judi.\n\nWhile some scholars have tried to offer possible explanations for the origins of the flood myth including a legendary retelling of a possible Black Sea deluge, the general mythological exaggeration and implausibility of the story are widely recognized by relevant academic fields. The acknowledgement of this follows closely the development of understanding of the natural history and especially the geology and paleontology of the planet.\n\nThe Masoretic Text of the Torah places the Great Deluge 1,656 years after Creation, or 1656 AM (\"Anno Mundi\", \"Year of the World\"). Many attempts have been made to place this time-span to a specific date in history. At the turn of the , Joseph Scaliger placed Creation at , Petavius calculated , and according to James Ussher's chronology, Creation took place in , dating the Great Deluge to .\n\nThe development of scientific geology had a profound impact on attitudes towards the biblical flood narrative. By bringing into question the biblical chronology, which placed the Creation and the Flood in a history which stretched back no more than a few thousand years, the concept of deep geological time undermined the idea of the historicity of the ark itself. In 1823 the English theologian and natural scientist William Buckland interpreted geological phenomena as \"Reliquiae Diluvianae\": \"relics of the flood\" which \"attested the action of a universal deluge\". His views were supported by others at the time, including the influential geologist Adam Sedgwick, but by 1830 Sedgwick considered that the evidence suggested only local floods. Louis Agassiz subsequently explained such deposits as the results of glaciation.\n\nIn 1862 William Thompson (later to become Lord Kelvin) calculated the age of the Earth at between 24 million and 400 million years, and for the remainder of the 19th century, discussion focused not on the viability of this theory of deep time, but on the derivation of a more precise figure for the age of the Earth. \"Lux Mundi\", an 1889 volume of theological essays which is usually held to mark a stage in the acceptance of a more critical approach to scripture, took the stance that readers should rely on the gospels as completely historical, but should not take the earlier chapters of Genesis literally.\nBy a variety of independent means, scientist have determined that the Earth is approximately 4.54 billion years old.\n\nThe scientific community regards flood geology as pseudoscience because it contradicts a variety of facts in geology, stratigraphy, geophysics, physics, paleontology, biology, anthropology, and archeology. Modern geology, its sub-disciplines and other scientific disciplines utilize the scientific method to analyze the geology of the earth. Scientific analysis refutes the key tenets of flood geology, which, as an idea, is in contradiction to scientific consensus. Modern geology relies on a number of established principles, one of the most important of which is Charles Lyell's principle of uniformitarianism. In relation to geological forces, uniformitarianism holds that the shaping of the Earth has occurred by means of mostly slow-acting forces that can be seen in operation today. In general, there is a lack of any evidence for any of the above effects proposed by flood geologists, and scientists do not take their claims of fossil-layering seriously.\n\nBy the 17th century believers in the Genesis account faced the issue of reconciling the exploration of the New World and increased awareness of the global distribution of species with the older scenario whereby all life had sprung from a single point of origin on the slopes of Mount Ararat. The obvious answer involved mankind spreading over the continents following the destruction of the Tower of Babel and taking animals along, yet some of the results seemed peculiar. In 1646 Sir Thomas Browne wondered why the natives of North America had taken rattlesnakes with them, but not horses: \"How America abounded with Beasts of prey and noxious Animals, yet contained not in that necessary Creature, a Horse, is very strange\".\n\nBrowne, among the first to question the notion of spontaneous generation, was a medical doctor and amateur scientist making this observation in passing. However, biblical scholars of the time, such as Justus Lipsius (1547–1606) and Athanasius Kircher (c.1601–80), had also begun to subject the Ark story to rigorous scrutiny as they attempted to harmonize the biblical account with the growing body of natural historical knowledge. The resulting hypotheses provided an important impetus to the study of the geographical distribution of plants and animals, and indirectly spurred the emergence of biogeography in the 18th century. Natural historians began to draw connections between climates and the animals and plants adapted to them. One influential theory held that the biblical Ararat was striped with varying climatic zones, and as climate changed, the associated animals moved as well, eventually spreading to repopulate the globe.\n\nThere was also the problem of an ever-expanding number of known species: for Kircher and earlier natural historians, there was little problem finding room for all known animal species in the ark. Less than a century later, discoveries of new species made it increasingly difficult to justify a literal interpretation for the Ark story. By the middle of the 18th century only a few natural historians accepted a literal interpretation of the narrative.\n\n\n"}

Though its earliest inhabitants, the Rapa Nui People, are ethnically Polynesian, the island is part of the South American state of Chile. The music of the island combines influences from both cultures.\n\nTraditional music from the island consists of choral singing and chanting, similar to Tahitian music. Families often performed as choirs, competing in an annual concert. They were accompanied by a trumpet made from a conch shell and a percussive dancer jumping onto a stone which is set over a calabash resonator. Other instruments include the kauaha, the jaw bone of a horse, upaupa, an accordion, and stones, which are clapped together for percussive effect.\n\nDue to ongoing contacts with Chile and elsewhere in South America, Latin American music has had influences on the music of Easter Island. Tango, for example, has spawned an Easter Island style called tango Rapanui, characterized by a simple guitar accompaniment instead of the frenetic bandoneon.\n\nThe first music school on the island was opened in 2012 by Mahani Teave, and teachers piano, cello, ukulele, and violin.\n\n\n"}

After dialling 1-800-273-TALK (8255), the caller is routed to their nearest crisis center to receive immediate counseling and local mental health referrals. The Lifeline supports people who call for themselves or someone they care about.\n\nThe National Suicide Prevention Lifeline grant is one component of the National Suicide Prevention Initiative (NSPI), a multi-project effort to reduce suicide, led by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) Center for Mental Health Services.\n\nIn July 2004, SAMHSA released a notice of funding availability (NOFA) as part of its National Suicide Prevention Initiative (NSPI). In keeping with SAMHSA's duty to advance the goals of the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention, the NOFA called for proposals from nonprofit organizations to expand, enhance, and sustain a network of certified crisis centers providing suicide prevention and intervention services to those in need using a toll-free number and website.\n\nIn September 2004, the Mental Health Association of New York City (MHA-NYC) was selected to administer the federally funded network of crisis centers named the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.\n\nIn December 2004, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline was founded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nGoogle, Bing, Yahoo and Ask.com all place the phone number and website details of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline as the reserved first result for when one enters keywords related to suicide, such as \"How to tie a noose\" and \"I want to die.\"\n\nIn April 2017, the musician and Hip Hop artist Logic released a song featuring Alessia Cara and Khalid for his third album \"Everybody\" titled “1-800-273-8255”, the number used for The National Suicide Prevention Hotline. On the day of the song release, the lifeline received one of its highest daily call volumes. It was made to bring awareness to the hotline and to the problems associated with suicide. After being featured on the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards, it increased the calls to the hotline by 50% that night. On the day of the song release, \"Lifeline's Facebook page saw 3 times its usual traffic\" and Lifeline's \"website saw a 17% increase in users in May 2017 over the previous month.\" Many of the callers to several crisis centers have mentioned Logic's song, and a third of those callers were struggling with suicidal thoughts.\n\nIn June 2007, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) partnered with SAMHSA and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to provide a veterans hotline to help vets in emotional crisis. Veterans who indicate that they are a U.S. military veteran by pressing one after dialing 1-800-273-TALK, are routed to the Veterans Hotline. This service caters to veteran-specific mental health care needs and helps connect vets to the VA Healthcare system.\n\n"}

{"id": "765936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=765936", "title": "Outlive", "text": "Outlive\n\nOutlive is a real-time strategy video game developed and produced by Continuum Entertainment. It is a mission-based real-time strategy game where the player controls either the human military or robot forces and attempts to eliminate all opposing forces. It was initially released in in Brazil (2001 for the rest of the world), and was the second and most successful product of Continuum. The game was one of the few Brazilian games to be published by a mainstream AAA publisher. It was published in the United States and Europe by Take-Two Interactive.\n\nThe increase of terrorist activity around the globe (the terrorist organizations had merged, creating large conglomerates whom the strongest and most feared was the Liberty Army) and the rapidly dwindling natural resources of the planet had forced the world's most powerful nations to take decisive measures. April 17, 2035 saw the creation of the World Council. The Council saw humanity's survival in interplanetary supply of resources mined on other celestial bodies. They sent out a large group of probes to nearly every planet and moon of the Solar System. After a lengthy search, they had found that the richest object is Titan. The Council started the Outlive Project: constructing three starships which would carry the initial colonists there. However, there was a problem: Titan's atmosphere was toxic to humans, and the climate was not so friendly either.\n\nTwo groups had arisen to solve the problem. One of them, led by Dr. Joseph Taylor, had tried to create genetically modified creatures to do the initial work. The other group, led by Dr. Mary-Anne Harley and sponsored by Mechatronics Inc., would combine robotics with sophisticated AI, making them suitable to do anything without the need for human supervision. Due to the shortage of time, the World Council gave both teams one Earth year to create working prototypes of the respective projects.\n\nAs the Outlive project neared completion, Dr. Taylor was ordered to relocate to a new research base after an unsuccessful attempt on his life. Prior to the transfer, all staff and equipment was stored in a military outpost. As LA forces held the sector, the newly created Special Counter-Terrorist Group and its leader, Brad Maxwell, had to clear a safe way for the convoy to the lab. Maxwell was a little angry at Taylor, as the impatient scientist had gone to the lab already when he reached the outpost. However, shortly after their arrival, a breakout of the unstable beings known as Abominables occurred. They had destroyed the base, scattering the staff. Taylor had been found and evacuated. Because of the accident, the World Council had terminated Taylor's contract, much to his protest, declaring that the three Outlive ships will have a robotic crew. However, the Liberty Army had occupied Mechatronics.\n\nMaxwell had cleared them out, using some of the Mechatronics' head, Carl Eberhardt's prototype battle robots. Even though the LA has been pushed out, Maxwell became suspicious of Mechatronics' motives, as materials used for weapons had been found in the facility. One of his subordinates, Lieutenant Peter Mackenzie, accompanied him to the Experimental City, where they believed Mechatronics trained their robots as soldiers. Although General Kaminski told them to don't care with this subject, they found hard proof in the Technology Center. Kaminski promised them a complete investigation after the Outlive mission was away.\n\nThe three ships were finally completed, but the launch was halted by news of two AA-artilleries recently installed by Pablo Morales, leader of the Liberty Army, very close to the launching sites. As both of them had been destroyed by Maxwell, the mission was finally launched. However, there were a third artillery, hidden in an underground base. SCTG forces quickly destroyed it, but the damage has been done: the rocket hit \"Outlive-1\". Upon reentry, the ship broke into 3 larger pieces. \"Outlive-2\" had reported of a contact with something then connection was lost. \"Outlive-3\" reported they had safely landed on Titan and started mining operations as per orders.\n\nThe World Council received reports that Liberty Army forces were on their way to the crash site. As Maxwell and Mackenzie arrived in the sector, Kaminski told them that he was allied with Mechatronics, and ordered all of their units to execute them. But he had been interrupted by Mackenzie who told Maxwell that he is an operative to the Liberty Army; Morales had known of the World Council's corruption and their affiliation with Mechatronics; that was the reason why he attacked the corporation's facility and tried to prevent the launch. Infuriated, Maxwell willingly joined the Army to make Kaminski pay for his betrayal. Both were rescued by Morales, who told them that the robots from the downed ship had started to establish a base and mine, as if they were really on Titan. To prevent the Council from utilizing them, the three destroyed the camp and their commander, Procyon.\n\nUtilizing information acquired by an agent, they have discovered that the Council had built ICBMs, missiles packed with nuclear warheads of a large yield. They plan to use it against the Liberty Army's encampments around the world. Mackenzie successfully disarmed all silos, however the last were booby-trapped: when Mackenzie went inside to work on that, the multi-megaton warhead exploded.\nAfter a long-lasting and bloody battle, the Liberty Army bested both the most elite forces of the World Council and the well-armed support troops of the Mechatronics. The Council had collapsed, and the Army had formed the Confederation.\n\nWhen the \"Outlive-2\" got out of contact, they had been secretly recalled to Earth to help the World Council against the Liberty Army. However, the war was already over when they had landed. Commander of the ship, Argus, had set \"his\" first objective of contacting Eberhardt. When \"he\" reached the base, it was in bad condition because of a surprise attack. Eberhardt fled, but was found. After destroying the nearby Confederate outpost, Eberhardt revealed his plans to Argus: \"he\" would have to construct and protect a portal to Titan, from which additional help in the form of Draco, leader of \"Outlive-3\" and his minions will emerge. With this newfound help, they had recaptured Mechatronics.\n\nSome time after this, Eberhardt has been contacted by Kaminski. The Russian offered info for a meeting. As Eberhardt didn't trust him, Argus was sent. His instincts were right, as it was a trap. Kaminski said that Maxwell had granted him protection if he manages to capture a commander. Draco was enraged, and leveled the base, but Argus was already shipped to another. \"He\" was rescued this time, with Kaminski personally killed by Draco.\n\nDraco received intelligence of a secret base in a valley, where Dr. Harley is experimenting with robots. When the base was destroyed, the two commanders went through the valley in search for more enemies. They had been surprised by a large amount of troops and Dr. Harley, who congratulated Argus for a good job. It turns out that she altered Argus' programming so that he would obey and sell Draco out. The latter obviously did not want to go through this and had gone berserk. However, the troops gained the upper hand and left him for dead. \"He\" was rescued by Eberhardt.\n\nThe two had learned about Harley's experiments and that she needed a cache of microprocessors to power up her own robots. They had prevented the cargo from reaching the destination, and even destroyed the Confederate forces in a large-scale attack.\n\nMechatronics had taken control of the planet and the last remnants of the Confederacy is being hunted by robotic execution squads. Maxwell has been captured, Morales and Argus are on the run. The remaining forces of the Liberty Army and the Robots loyal to the Confederacy had formed the Resistance. Argus and Pablo had formed a base of both humans and Robots which had been attacked by two different Robotic bases, from both the North (Blue base) & from the South (Cyan base). Then the Campaign has a twist, if you destroy the Blue base, Argus and Pablo go to rescue Maxwell which is protected by a Robotic Stronghold and a strong Robotic army which was led by a Robotic Commander named Sentinel. But if you destroy the Cyan base, Argus & Pablo alone go to save Dr. Marry Anne Harley which was attacked by Robots.\nWhen Argus & Pablo go to save Maxwell, they first have to destroy Sentinel for \"he\" was the only Al in the army & if \"he\" was destroyed, the Robotic Army would shut down. When Sentinel was destroyed, Argus & Pablo had destroyed the Robotic Stronghold & rescued Maxwell. The Resistance had also taken the remaining Robots and reprogrammed them to serve the Resistance.\nWhen Argus & Pablo alone went to rescue Dr. Mary Anne Harley, they had to destroy the AA-Artillery, which wasn't easy for they had to sneak pass the Robots which were well armed and had set up a large base. When Argus & Pablo destroyed the AA-Artillery, the Resistance Air-Force could come and destroy the Robots, thus rescuing Dr. Mary Anne.\nAfter these 2 missions, Argus and Pablo gather the Men and Robots of the Resistance and destroy the Mechatronics base in a large scale battle. The Resistance won, thus bringing the end to the harsh rule of Mechatronics. Carl had escaped, but the New Confederation had been formed, with Brad Maxwell as its leader, and an era of peace had begun.\nLittle did they know, that Carl had escaped from Earth and hidden himself in a space station, somewhere not far from Earth. It was at that moment that it was discovered that Carl Eberheart was working for an alien race that wishes to bring Earth to ruin. Carl was executed by the Alien Leader for his failure. Then a massive fleet of Alien UFOs appear, heading towards Earth.\n\n"}

The film features Vijay in a dual role alongside Shruthi Haasan, Hansika Motwani and Sridevi. Sudeep features as the main antagonist of the film including Prabhu and Nandita Swetha in supporting roles. The film is dubbed into Telugu and Hindi languages simultaneously. Both the Telugu and Hindi versions were released a day later on 2 October 2015. Produced by Vijay's public relations officer Selvakumar, the film has music composed by Devi Sri Prasad, Natarajan Subramaniam as the cinematographer and has T. Muthuraj as the production designer. After beginning pre-production works in early 2013, the film began its shoot in November 2014. The film was released on 1 October 2015. It performed well overseas but underperformed domestically. The film was praised for its visual effects, but criticized for its screenplay. The story revolves around the clash between humans and demons(Vedhalams) ruled by demon kingdom in a fantasy world were the human who is fighting for justice for killing of humans by demons forging as a demon turns out to be a child of a demon prince whose powers were suppressed by the human clan.\n\nPuli (Vijay) is the adopted son of a tribal village chief Vembunathan (Prabhu). From a young age, he notices the atrocities regularly committed on the villagers by a group of people from the neighbouring kingdom of Vedhalapuram called the Vedhalams, who have supernatural powers. When he becomes an adult, he starts to protect the villagers from the Vedhalams, because of which he is well respected by the villagers.\n\nMarudheeran falls in love with his childhood sweetheart Pavazhamalli (Shruti Haasan) and both soon secretly get married and reveal it to Vembunathan who blesses them. One day, Pavazhamalli is kidnapped by a group of Vedhalams, who then ransack the village and also kill Vembunathan. Marudheeran, along with his close friends Kodangi (Thambi Ramaiah) and Sama (Sathyan), begin a journey to Vedhalapuram to rescue Pavazhamalli. During the journey, Marudheeran rescues Manthagini (Hansika Motwani), the princess of Vedhalapuram, from a panther. This is noticed by Jalatharangan (Sudeep), the Commander-in-Chief of Vedhalapuram. On the pretext of being medicine makers, Marudheeran, Kodangi and Sama enter the Vedhalapuram palace, where they meet Yavanarani (Sridevi), the cruel Queen of Vedhalapuram who is also a sorceress. She allows them to stay at the palace and soon Marudheeran wins the support of the Queen and the love of Manthagini with his fighting prowess and resilience. Yavanarani announces the engagement of Marudheeran with Manthagini.\n\nLater, Marudheeran finds out that he himself is a Vedhalam. Marudheeran was the son of Pulivendhan (Vijay), the late prince of Vedhalapuram and Yavanarani's younger brother. When he stood up to Jalatharangan, who used to terrorise the citizens of Vedhalapuram with the help of his henchmen, Jalatharangan killed him and his wife Pushpa (Nanditha). Marudheeran also finds out that Yavanarani is actually a puppet Queen under the influence of evil magical power emanating from Jalatharangan's ring. Due to the evil magical influence, Yavanarani developed magical powers as well as her tyrannical behaviour. She performs yearly Kanya Puja to boost her magical powers. After Yavanarani performs the Kanya Puja for the eighteenth consecutive year (this time on Pavazhamalli), Jalatharangan has planned to eliminate her and take over the throne.\n\nMarudheeran fights Jalatharangan and kills him, avenging his father's death. But before he dies, Jalatharangan opens his ring, releasing all the evil magical power so that Yavanarani could continue to rule Vedhalapuram as a tyrantess without his control after his death. Marudheeran realises that the Queen can be returned to normal only if her staff, which is the source of her magical power, is destroyed. He and Manthagini find her performing the Kanya Puja on Pavazhamalli. After a bitter sword fight with the Queen, he manages to destroy the staff, thus restoring the Queen to her normal self. In gratitude for releasing her from the evil magical influence, Yavanarani makes Marudheeran heir to the throne of Vedhalapuram.\n\nChimbu Deven was reported to be working on a \"fantasy film set in contemporary times\" in January 2011 for UTV Motion Pictures and Dhanush was subsequently signed on to play the leading role. The film was titled as \"Maareesan\", with G. V. Prakash Kumar and Kathir signed on as composer and cinematographer respectively, while the team revealed filming would start in late 2011. Genelia D'Souza and Hansika Motwani were confirmed to play the leading female roles in the film, while Vadivelu was also reported to be a part of the cast. However, in October 2011, UTV Motion Pictures left the project citing the escalating budget and Aascar Films replaced them as producers. The project later failed to take off, and the actor and director moved on to work on other ventures. During the production of his \"Oru Kanniyum Moonu Kalavaanikalum\" (2014) in late 2013, Chimbu Deven restarted preliminary work on the fantasy film and narrated the script to Vijay, who expressed interest in being a part of the project. Subsequently, the project found producers in P. T. Selvakumar, Vijay's press relations officer, and Shibu of Thameen Films, who have previously distributed several of Vijay's films across Kerala. The two producers came together to form a new production house SKT Films and announced that production would begin after the completion of Vijay's work in AR Murugadoss's \"Kaththi\" (2014).\n\nAlthough early reports suggested that A. R. Rahman would be the film's music composer, the team later confirmed Devi Sri Prasad had been signed. Natarajan Subramaniam chose to continue his work as a cinematographer with the film, despite his acting success in \"Sathuranga Vettai\" (2014), revealing he was excited to work alongside such an ensemble cast. T. Muthuraj was announced as the film's art director and began work alongside his commitments in Shankar's \"I\" (2014), while lyricist Vairamuthu also joined the crew. The team also picked five costume designers to take care of clothing for the actors, with Manish Malhotra, Deepali Noor, Chaitanya Rao, Siva and Sai all brought on board. Furthermore, four stunt choreographers were selected to take care of action scenes with international technicians Sang Lin and Pradit Seeluem, brought in to work alongside Sunil Rodrigues and Dilip Subbarayan. National Award winner, R.C Kamalakannan was signed on to be in charge of the film's animations and special effects, PhantomFx a Chennai-based vfx company known for movie Indru Netru Naalai, handled most of the vfx shots and the rest were split among several studios. Chimbu Deven subsequently worked on finalising the script of the film between January and August 2014. Chimbu Deven and cinematographer Natarajan Subramaniam scouted locations in Kerala in August 2014, finalising schedules in Chalakudi and Nelliyampathy.\n\nIn April 2014, reports suggested Kannada actor Sudeep was approached to play a parallel leading role in the film, while contrasting reports noted he would play the lead antagonist. Sudeep later confirmed his participation in the film, adding it would see him in a \"first of its kind\" role. The team then successfully signed on actress Sridevi to portray a supporting role of a princess in the film, with the actress appearing in a Tamil film for the first time in 29 years. This was her final Tamil film before her death in 2018. Another senior actor, Prabhu, also signed on after being approached by the director to portray a character role.\n\nChimbu Deven revealed that the film would feature two leading female roles to appear alongside Vijay. Initial reports had linked Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone to the roles, but high remuneration subsequently meant neither were signed. Shruti Haasan confirmed that she had signed the film in July 2014, making a comeback to Tamil films after a two-year hiatus following \"3\" (2012). Hansika Motwani was also added to the cast thereafter to portray a princess, the daughter of Sridevi's character Thambi Ramaiah and Vidyullekha Raman were also selected to portray roles in the film, while comedians Sathyan, Robo Shankar and Imman Annachi joined the team in the first schedule. A press release in early January 2015 added actors Naren, Vijaykumar, Ali, Karunas and Joe Malloori to the film's cast. In April 2015, Nandita joined the cast to play a small and pivotal role, after Bhavana had turned down the offer. Gayathri Raman stated that she had portrayed Shruti's mother in the film.\n\nThe team began filming on 10 November 2014 at the Adityaram Studios on the East Coast Road, Chennai, where a song featuring Vijay and Hansika Motwani was shot in a set replicating a castle put up by art director, T. Muthuraj. The team then set up base in Pannaiyapuram for a forty-five-day stint, with hundreds of extras and technicians gathered from neighbouring states. A second schedule continued throughout December after which it was reported that the film was twenty percent complete. After a Christmas break, production restarted in early January 2015, and carried on in the outskirts of the city until mid-January.

It had two '100 kW shortwave transmitters, which could reach much of Africa and Asia. It also had a medium wave transmitter serving Addis Ababa. It broadcast in English, French, and a number of African and Asian languages.\n\nMany of Radio Voice of the Gospel programs were compiled in nine regional studios in the countries to which they were broadcast in 19 different languages. It aimed to be more general than many church-owned stations, as it broadcast news largely based on Reuters, as well as drama and other features. The staff were international and ecumenical. The news staff was highly respected for the accuracy of their news reporting.\n\nEthiopia was still under the Emperor Haile Selassie, and political activism and free speech were very limited in the country. It was therefore subject to some censorship and limitations, particularly on the local Amharic service. Censorship increased after the overthrow of Haile Selassie in 1974, when the Marxist government suppressed broadcasts that they considered counterrevolutionary.\n\nAdditionally, some of the donors came from the fundamentalist wing of the church and were clearly anxious their approach should dominate, particularly in such matters as creationism.\n\nThe Dergue took control of the country in 1974. The Provisional Military Governing Council of Ethiopia took over the radio station on March 12, 1977, apparently without compensation, and renamed it Radio Voice of Revolutionary Ethiopia to propagate Marxist ideas. It broadcast in Amharic, English, Arabic, and French.\n\n"}

Subplots may also intertwine with the main plot at some point in a story.\n\nSubplots are distinguished from the main plot by taking up less of the action, having fewer significant events occur, with less impact on the \"world\" of the work, and occurring to less important characters. \n\nIn screenwriting, a subplot is referred to as a \"B story\" or a \"C story,\" etc.\n"}

United and Club Universidad de Chile, as well as by the fans of the national teams from Chile, Ecuador, and Peru. \n\nThe chant's melody is similar to the Portuguese-language cheer \"Eu Sou Brasileiro\" (I Am Brazilian), invented in 1949 by the Brazilian teacher Nelson Biasoli.\n\nPeruvian club Universitario's organized football supporters, \"Trinchera Norte\", created the \"Vamos\" chant in the early 1990s, originally naming the cheer as \"Esta Tarde\". The chant has also been adapted by supporters of Peru's national team as \"¡Vamos peruanos!\" (Let's go Peruvians!). During the qualification process for the Russia 2018 World Cup, Peruvians notably sung the chant alongside Argentines disgruntled by the performance of Argentina's national team at the \"La Bombonera\" stadium.\n\nAfter listening to Universitario's fans singing the chant, the Chilean group \"Los de Abajo\" (The Ones From Below), the \"barra brava\" of Club Universidad de Chile, adapted the chant to cheer their football club. \"John Connor,\" the pseudonym of a leader of \"Los de Abajo\", stated to a reporter of the Santiago newspaper \"La Tercera\" that: \"At the 'U' we began singing [the chant] in 1993, as it seemed to us to be a good tune. And thanks to us, not the Peruvians, it was popularized, because even then \"Los de Abajo\" were the biggest \"barra\" in the Pacific.\"\n\n\"Vamos\"' popularity increased in Chile after \"Los de Abajo\" adapted the chant's lyrics to cheer Chile's national team in the qualification process for the France 1998 World Cup, renaming the chant as \"¡Vamos chilenos!\" (Let's go Chileans!). During the 1996 Chilean telethon for children with developmental disabilities, held at that country's National Stadium, the \"Vamos\" chant reached even higher levels of popularity after host Don Francisco, aided by sports journalist Jorge Hevia, slightly changed the lyrics to encourage the fundraiser's completion—ever since then, \"Vamos\" is considered the unofficial anthem of Chile's Teletón.\n\nIn 2010, Keyvan Heydari, journalist for the American nonprofit National Public Radio, listed \"¡Vamos chilenos!\" as representative of Chile's supporters and one of the \"battle hymns\" of the South Africa 2010 World Cup. Also in 2010, Chilean musician Rodrigo Medel registered a version of the chant with the \"Sociedad Chilena del Derecho de Autor\" (Chilean Copyright Society), but its inscription as a folk song prevents him from receiving royalties.\n\nFans from football clubs from the North American Major League Soccer (MLS) have included the \"Vamos\" chant among others that they adapted from foreign leagues. Sports journalist Phil West, wrote for the MLS's official website that the Vancouver Southsiders, supporters of the Canadian football club Vancouver Whitecaps, adapted the \"Vamos\" chant from Chile's \"¡Vamos chilenos!\".\n\nThe Screaming Eagles and La Barra Brava, supporters of the American football club D.C. United, also modified the chant for their club, renaming it as \"Vamos DC United\". The altered chant, sung in Spanish, is considered traditional by the club, which even inscribed the phrase \"Vamos United Esta Noche Tenemos Que Ganar\" (Let's Go United Tonight We've Got To Win) on their 2015 jersey's neck tape. In 2012, Elliott Turner, football correspondent for British newspaper \"The Guardian\", listed \"Vamos DC United\" among the five best \"fanthems\" from MLS, describing it as \"simple yet powerful.\"\n\n\"Vamos\" has increased in popularity at international football matches beyond Peru and Chile. Since 2014, the supporters of Ecuador's national team chant a version of \"Vamos\" renamed as \"¡Vamos ecuatorianos!\". Also in 2014, the \"Ultras Malaya\" supporters of Malaysia's national team chant a version of \"Vamos\" under the name of \"Ayuh MalaysiaKu\" (Come on my Malaysia!).\n\nOriginal lyrics (in Spanish):\n\nModified lyrics (in Spanish):\nEnglish translation:\n\n"}

Eric Meretzky, which took place in the fictional universe of \"Zork\". The books were published by Tor Books. Like the \"Zork\" video games, the books were a form of interactive fiction which offered the reader a choice of actions symbolized by pages to turn to, as in the contemporary book series \"Choose Your Own Adventure\", or the later \"Give Yourself Goosebumps\" series. The protagonists of each book were a boy and girl, called Bill and June on Earth, and re-dubbed Bivotar and Juranda in Zork. The settings and plots were reminiscent of locations and events from the \"Zork\" universe.\n\nAt each ending the player received a score from zero to ten based on how far they had made it through the book and if the ending was a failure, a chance to try again at the choice where they decided incorrectly. The books also usually contained a \"cheater trap\", reached by opting to use an item which does not exist (at least not in the current book). The story abruptly ends; the reader is chastised and not given a chance to try again in the endings resulting from these.\n\nThe books were written in English and translated into Spanish. All four books were published as \"What-Do-I-Do-Now Books\". Copies did contain publication errors—page numbers that the reader was directed to turn to or turn back to were at times incorrect. The first three books were published as a trilogy in August and September 1983—each has the titles of the other two listed opposite the cover page. The fourth book in the series was published in October 1984.\n\nThe first book in the \"Zork\" series, \"The Forces of Krill\" utilized familiar \"Zork\" locations and scoring systems. \nBivotar and Juranda are on a quest to find the three Palantirs of Zork and to defeat the evil sorcerer Krill. There were 20 possible endings.\n\nThe second book in the \"Zork\" series, \"The Malifestro Quest\" contained several inside jokes for those familiar with the \"Zork\" games.\nBivotar and Juranda must rescue the hero Syovar from the evil wizard Malifestro along with Fred and Max, two quirky elves. There were 18 possible endings.\n\nThe third book in the \"Zork\" series, \"The Cavern of Doom\" tried to capture the \"exploring the dungeon\" motif of the earlier games.\nBivotar and Juranda search the Cavern of Doom, an uncharted portion of the Great Underground Empire and the site of several mysterious disappearances, including the elves Fred and Max. There were 17 possible endings.\n\nThe fourth book in the \"Zork\" series, the \"Conquest of Quendor\", featured silly riddles reminiscent of \"Zork II\".\nBivotar and Juranda search for the Helm of Zork in an attempt to bring peace to the Land of Frobozz, in defiance of Jeearr, a riddle-telling demon. There are 17 possible endings.\n\nOf six novels published as \"Infocom Books\" by Avon Books between 1989–1991, two were directly based on \"Zork\": \"The Zork Chronicles\" by George Alec Effinger (1990) and \"The Lost City of Zork\" by Robin W. Bailey (1991).\n\n\n"}
