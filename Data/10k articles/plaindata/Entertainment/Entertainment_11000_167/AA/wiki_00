The original traditional action model is the flapping bird. Typically models where the final assembly involves some special action, for instance blowing up a waterbomb, are also classed as action origami. More rarely models like paper plane and spinners which have no moving parts are included. Some traditional action origami involved cuts but modern models typically are built with no cuts. Action origami are normally toys built to amuse but some are designed to inspire wonder.\n\nAction toys include birds or butterflies with flapping wings, beaks that peck, and frogs that hop, as well as popular traditional models like the fortune teller. Paper poppers or bangers are models that make a noise when flicked down hard.\n\nSome action origami is designed to accompany a story whilst it is built.\n\nSome models are far more complex than can be classed as toys.They are built to amaze and astonish. For instance Robert J. Lang's Bassist, Pianist, and Violinist is a set of action models where each one plays an instrument when pulled on appropriately. Jeremy Shafer has made a number of extraordinary action models including a Swiss army knife with tools that open out, a slithering snake skin, and flashers, one of which he demonstrated on \"The Carol Duvall Show\".\n\nFlashers are models with a regular pattern that can be folded up small and rapidly expanded. The miura fold is a similar idea that has been used in commercial applications. Versions on a regular pattern can for instance be used to make a human figure when folded up or a maze when opened.\n\nDifferent smart material technologies are used by the researchers to yield active action origami structures. Scientists and engineers are using materials such as electroactive polymers (EAP), shape memory polymers, and shape memory alloys to achieve action origami structures. This origami-inspired concept has wide range of applications such as space deployable solar array, heart stent, morphing wings etc.,\n"}

Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting or participating in extreme sports.\n\nAdventurous experiences create psychological arousal, which can be interpreted as negative (e.g. fear) or positive (e.g. flow). For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. According to adventurer André Malraux, in his \"La Condition Humaine\" (1933), \"If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity?\". Similarly, Helen Keller stated that \"Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.\"\n\nOutdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of recreation or excitement: examples are adventure racing and adventure tourism. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers – the British adventurer Jason Lewis, for example, uses adventures to draw global sustainability lessons from living within finite environmental constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren. Adventure education intentionally uses challenging experiences for learning.\n\nSome of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as Homer's \"The Odyssey\".\n\nThe knight errant was the form the \"adventure seeker\" character took in the late Middle Ages.\n\nThe adventure novel exhibits these \"protagonist on adventurous journey\" characteristics as do many popular feature films, such as \"Star Wars\" and \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\".\n\nAdventure books may have the theme of the hero or main character going to face the wilderness or Mother Nature. Examples include books such as Hatchet or My Side of the Mountain. These books are less about \"questing\", such as in mythology or other adventure novels, but more about surviving on their own, living off the land, gaining new experiences, and becoming closer to the natural world.\n\nMany adventures are based on the idea of a quest: the hero goes off in pursuit of a reward, whether it be a skill, prize, or perhaps the safety of a person. On the way, the hero must overcome various obstacles. Mythologist Joseph Campbell discussed his notion of the monomyth in his book, \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\". Campbell proposed that the heroic mythological stories from culture to culture followed a similar underlying pattern, starting with the \"call to adventure\", followed by a hazardous journey, and eventual triumph.\n\nMany video games are adventure games.\n\nFrom ancient times, travelers and explorers have written about their adventures. Journals which became best-sellers in their day were written, such as Marco Polo's journal \"The Travels of Marco Polo\" or Mark Twain's \"Roughing It\". Others were personal journals, only later published, such as the journals of Lewis and Clark or Captain James Cook's journals. There are also books written by those not directly a part of the adventure in question, such as The Right Stuff by Tom Wolfe, or books written by those participating in the adventure but in a format other than that of a journal, such as Conquistadors of the Useless by Lionel Terray. Documentaries often use the theme of adventure as well.\n\nThere are many sports classified as adventure sports, due to their inherent danger and excitement. Some of these include mountain climbing, skydiving, or other extreme sports.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1697456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1697456", "title": "Anti-Barney humor", "text": "Anti-Barney humor\n\nAnti-Barney humor is a form of humor that targets the children's television series \"Barney & Friends\". The notion that the show is \"saccharine\", \"boring\", \"annoying\", \"sugary\", \"dangerous\" or \"uneducational\" has made the program a target for parody and negative attacks by children of various ages, adolescents, and adults in the United States and elsewhere. Other popular children's characters such as Dora the Explorer, Bert and Ernie, Elmo, Caillou, Peppa Pig, SpongeBob SquarePants and the Teletubbies have been subject to subversive adult humor; in Barney's case, however, the humor has typically been far more dark and the attacks more vicious and hostile toward Barney, with practitioners openly and regularly speaking of their desire to kill the title character.\n\nAnti-Barney humor was most popular in the mid-1990s, at the peak of the show's popularity, and was pervasive in popular culture during that time frame.\n\nAlmost immediately after \"Barney and Friends\" first aired in 1992, the result was that it mesmerized and fascinated many viewers under the age of four, but was strongly disapproved of by most older children and young adults, who criticized it for being \"saccharine\", \"sunshine-and-flowers\", and \"one-dimensional\". University of Chicago professor W. J. T. Mitchell noted that \n\nThese children were among the first to practice anti-Barney humor, and were given an entire chapter of the 1995 book \"Greasy Grimy Gopher Guts: The Subversive Folklore of Childhood.\"\n\nEventually, adults began to contribute to the anti-Barney humor, including some parents and celebrities. Many families now refuse to watch the show because of its supposed \"one-dimensionality\" and \"lack of educational value\", and several YouTube videos have plush dolls of the character being destroyed in various ways, including being burnt, destroyed by small explosions, being shot by many weapons using tannerite or being run over by vehicles.\n\nSources of hostility include episodes where Barney and the other characters do potentially harmful acts such as lying, cheating, stealing (with no punishment or scolding from the purple dinosaur), and catching stinging insects. Other reasons cited for the hostility also include the purple dinosaur's voice (described by many parents as \"dopey\"), lack of varied facial expressions other than a toothy smile, and personality (described as being \"self-centered\"), as well as how the children in the series interact with the dinosaur characters.\n\nIn \"Barney vs. The San Diego Chicken\", Ted Giannoulas stated \n\nAdditionally, the show was ranked #50 on \"TV Guide\"s List of the 50 Worst TV Shows of All Time.\n\nCharles Barkley was the guest host of \"Saturday Night Live\" on September 25, 1993, and performed a skit that parodied his \"Godzilla\"-themed Nike commercial by facing off against Barney in a one-on-one matchup.\n\nThe animated series \"Animaniacs\" had a satire episode in which the Warner siblings confront \"Baloney\", an orange dinosaur meant to be a parody of Barney. The entire episode is dedicated to lampooning the series, as well as PBS for airing it (the introduction promotes the show as part of the \"SBS (Stupid Broadcasting Service)\" while the voice-over says, \"\"Baloney and Kids\" is brought to you by this station and other stations that lack clever programming.\"). The Warners try various methods to get rid of Baloney (including dropping anvils on his head; after the second time Baloney says, \"Let's do that again!\"), but only escape when the show runs out of time, at which point they also take with them three extremely desperate adult members of the regular crew (including Hello Nurse).\n\nOne of the first well known anti-Barney songs was Tony Mason's \"Barney's on Fire\" (often miscredited to \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, who denied writing the song). Although Yankovic did not write \"Barney's on Fire\", he did mention Barney in the lyrics of the parody song \"Jurassic Park\" (\"...I'm afraid those things'll harm me / 'Cause they sure don't act like Barney...\"). The music video for \"Jurassic Park\" also includes Barney's head being bitten off by a Tyrannosaurus, who later coughs up the head after receiving the Heimlich maneuver from a brontosaurus. Comedian Stephen Lynch has gained fame from his \"Evil Barney Bus Driver\" and \"Evil Barney Babysitter\" audio skits (among others), which he did for Opie and Anthony in 1997 and which have been commonly posted on the Internet.\n\nAn online video created by Ryan Steinhardt in 1998 combines clips from \"Barney and Friends\" with the 2Pac single \"Hit 'Em Up\", designed to give the viewer the impression that Barney and the other characters from the show are rapping. The humor is based on the juxtaposition of the actual song's heavy use of profanity and violent content, as opposed to the regular lessons and content on \"Barney and Friends\".\n\nShortly after the show's debut, various parody songs began circulating on elementary school playgrounds to the tune of Barney's closing theme, most of which involved the opening line \"I hate you, you hate me, let's team up and kill Barney\", and involving various gruesome ways of doing away with the character.\n\nA small Italian comic book imprint, Parody Press (an imprint of Eternity Comics), released an anthology comic book entitled \"Kill Barny\" [sic] in 1994, a collection of short stories and one-page strips depicting the death of the purple dinosaur. Several months later, another issue was released under the name \"Kill Barny Again!\", reprinting most of \"Kill Barny\" but with some new material pages and a new cover.\n\nThe Mad Magazine fold-in for issue #328 asked, \"What Single Goal Has Brought Agreement And Unity Among Vastly Different Groups?\" and the image, which featured pairs of opposite people proclaiming their support for the answer, folded into a dead Barney with the word \"extinct\" on it, and the caption then read \"Death to Barney.\"\n\nA 1994 \"FoxTrot\" comic strip features 10-year-old Jason writing a letter to PBS telling them that Barney should be eating the kids after he saw \"Jurassic Park\" to which his friend Marcus says he would watch the show if that happened.\n\nThe science humor magazine \"Annals of Improbable Research\" published, in its 1995 January and February issue, a taxonomical article entitled \"The Taxonomy of Barney\" that included X-rays of the character's skeleton.\n\nThe closing scene of the 1998 film \"Mafia!\" has an assassin, Nick \"The Eskimo\" Molinaro, fatally stabbing a purple Barney-like dinosaur (who is seen eagerly watching pornography in his apartment) with a harpoon. The closing credits note that a shrine was built in Molinaro's honor, visited by millions of grateful parents for doing \"the one deed to benefit all mankind.\"\n\nThe 2002 film \"Death to Smoochy\" loosely parodies anti-Barney humor. The film features disgraced former children's star \"Rainbow Randolph\" (portrayed by Robin Williams) as he tries to sabotage the Barney-like character that replaced him, a purple rhinoceros named Smoochy (portrayed by Edward Norton), and later the efforts of the Irish Mob to kill Smoochy. At one point, Smoochy's resemblance to Barney is acknowledged when Randolph refers to him as \"Bastard son of Barney\" in the film's final act.\n\nSeveral works of short fiction have revolved around not only killing Barney, but portraying him as a demonic force to be defeated in an epic tale of good versus evil, including a series of short stories written by Brian Bull, such as the \"Day of The Barney\" trilogy about two children who fight the purple dinosaur and free hordes of children from his demonic control, and \"Batman versus Barney\".\nAnother YouTube video shows Elmo singing his \"Elmo's World\" song while Barney the Dinosaur singing his \"I love you\" song. As a result of Elmo's hate for Barney's singing, he shoots him with a shotgun or pistol and afterwards swears at the dead Barney. Other YouTube videos often add in other dislikable characters to be shot, add in someone that shoots Elmo back, or other features but some of the videos always include Barney and Elmo and shooting of a gun.\n\nThe Jihad to Destroy Barney is a fictional jihad that sees itself in the ultimate battle against Barney (spelled \"B'harne\" therein) and his followers. It is described as \"a heterogeneous organization of people on the Internet dedicated to defamation, humiliation, eradication, killing, and removal of Barney the Purple Dinosaur of the television show \"Barney & Friends\" from the airwaves and from every human's life.\" B'harne is depicted as a purple, scaly lizard-like demon with sharp talons, long teeth and glowing evil red eyes.\n\nReferences to a Barney \"Jihad\" were found on Barney-related Usenet newsgroups as early as 1993. The website itself was active as of 1995. Furthermore, Douglass Streusand, a professor of Islamic history at Marine Corps Staff College in Virginia, discovered that the first entry of an Internet search on the term \"jihad\" referred to Barney.\n\nOne of the most widely distributed works of anti-Barney humor appeared in the 2001 book \"Science Askew,\" which determined that a phrase describing Barney contained a chronogram of the Book of Revelation's Number of the Beast, 666.\nBelow is the formula of the equation:\n\n\nLyons Partnership, owners of the intellectual property rights to \"Barney & Friends\", claimed that Barney spoofs represented trademark and copyright infringement. Lyons' lawyers subsequently demanded that such material be removed from the Internet. Some site owners complied after such threats, but American law establishes parody as a fair use defense against such infringement claims.\n\nIn 1994, comedy sketches of The San Diego Chicken during professional sporting events began to include scenes of the Chicken beating up a dinosaur character. Lyons Partnership began sending letters to Ted Giannoulas, who portrays the Chicken, demanding that he stop the alleged violation of Lyons' rights on the Barney character.\n\nThese threats did not stop the mock battles between the Chicken and Barney. On 8 October 1997, Lyons filed lawsuit in Fort Worth, Texas federal district court against Giannoulas, claiming copyright and trademark infringement and further claiming that such performances would confuse children. In his case, Giannoulas cited that the purple dino was a \"symbol of what is wrong with our society--an homage, if you will, to all the inane, banal platitudes that we readily accept and thrust unthinkingly upon our children\", that his qualities are \"insipid and corny\", and that he also explains that, in an article posted in a 1997 issue of \"The New Yorker\", he argues that at least some perceive Barney as a \"pot-bellied,\" \"sloppily fat\" dinosaur who \"giggle[s] compulsively in a tone of unequaled feeble-mindedness\" and \"jiggles his lumpish body like an overripe eggplant.\" This court agreed with Giannoulas, and ruled against Lyons on 29 July 1998, declaring the sketches to be a parody that did not infringe on the rights of the character that Lyons created.\n\nLyons appealed this ruling to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, but again lost their case to Giannoulas on July 7, 1999.\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation hosted online archives from the Computer Underground Digest that contained Barney parody material. In 2001, Gibney, Anthony & Flaherty, LLP, lawyers for Lyons Partnership, issued a threat letter to\nEFF claiming infringement of the Barney character. EFF strongly defended itself against these claims citing the established defence of parody, backed by United States First Amendment protections.\n\n, the EFF successfully defended an anti-Barney website from a lawsuit. An article in British publication \"The Register\" applauded the victory.\n\nAround 2001, Olympia, Washington-based comedy website CyberCheeze posted a work entitled \"150 Ways to Kill the Purple Dinosaur.\" Lyons threatened legal action in response, and CyberCheeze replied on their site that the threat was \"about as intellectual as the purple quivering mass of gyrating goo you call Barney, but that it also is demeaning to everyone that visits our website and reads this worthless attempt and scare tactic.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "215217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=215217", "title": "Antonin Artaud", "text": "Antonin Artaud\n\nAntoine Marie Joseph Artaud, better known as Antonin Artaud (; 4 September 1896 – 4 March 1948), was a French dramatist, poet, essayist, actor, and theatre director, widely recognized as one of the major figures of twentieth-century theatre and the European avant-garde.\n\nAntonin Artaud was born on the 4th of September 1896 in Marseille, France, to Euphrasie Nalpas and Antoine-Roi Artaud. Both his parents were natives of Smyrna (modern-day İzmir), and he was greatly affected by his Greek ancestry. Antoine-Roi Artaud was a shipowner. Euphrasie gave birth to nine children, but four were stillborn and two others died in childhood. Antonin contracted meningitis at age four. At the time the disease had no cure, but after a long struggle including a comatose period, a severely weakened Antonin survived.\n\nArtaud's parents arranged a long series of sanatorium stays for their temperamental son, which were both prolonged and expensive. This lasted five years, with a break of two months in June and July 1916, when Artaud was conscripted into the French Army. He was discharged due to addiction to laudanum and mental instability. During Artaud's \"rest cures\" at the sanatorium, he read Arthur Rimbaud, Charles Baudelaire, and Edgar Allan Poe. In May 1919, the director of the sanatorium prescribed laudanum for Artaud, precipitating a lifelong addiction to that and other opiates. Antoine suffered a nervous breakdown at age 19; this was not the end of his mental illness.\n\nIn March 1921, Artaud moved to Paris to pursue a career as a writer (against his father's wishes) and instead discovered he had a talent for avant-garde theatre. While training and performing with directors including Charles Dullin and Georges Pitoeff, he continued to write both poetry and essays. At the age of 27, he mailed some of his poems to the journal \"La Nouvelle Revue Française\"; they were rejected, but the editor, Jacques Rivière, wrote back seeking to understand him, and a relationship via letters developed. Their compilation into an epistolary work, \"Correspondance avec Jacques Rivière\", was Artaud's first major publication.\n\nArtaud cultivated a great interest in cinema as well, writing the scenario for the first surrealist film, \"The Seashell and the Clergyman\" (1928), directed by Germaine Dulac. This film influenced Salvador Dalí and Luis Buñuel, two key Spanish surrealists, when they made \"Un Chien Andalou\" (1929). Artaud's performance as Jean-Paul Marat in Abel Gance's \"Napoleon\" (1927) used exaggerated movements to convey the fire of Marat's personality. He also played the monk Massieu in Carl Theodor Dreyer's \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" (1928).\n\nIn 1926–28, Artaud ran the Alfred Jarry Theatre, along with Roger Vitrac. He produced and directed original works by Vitrac, as well as pieces by Claudel and Strindberg. The theatre advertised that they would produce Artaud's play \"Jet de sang\" in their 1926–1927 season, but it was never mounted and was not premiered until 40 years later. The Theatre was extremely short-lived, but was attended by an enormous range of European artists, including André Gide, Arthur Adamov, and Paul Valéry.\n\nIn 1931, Artaud saw Balinese dance performed at the Paris Colonial Exposition. Although he did not fully understand the intentions and ideas behind traditional Balinese performance, it influenced many of his ideas for theatre. Also during this year, Artaud's \"First Manifesto for a Theatre of Cruelty\" was published in \"La Nouvelle Revue Française\"; it would later appear as a chapter in \"The Theatre and Its Double\". In 1935, Artaud's production of his adaptation of Shelley's \"The Cenci\" premiered. \"Les Censi\" was a commercial failure, although it employed innovative sound effects-including the first theatrical use of the electronic instrument the Ondes Martenot—and had a set designed by Balthus.\n\nAfter the production failed, Artaud received a grant to travel to Mexico, where in 1936 he met his first Mexican-Parisian friend, the painter Federico Cantú, when Cantú gave lectures on the decadence of Western civilization. Artaud also studied and lived with the Tarahumaran people and experimented with peyote, recording his experiences, which were later released in a volume called \"Voyage to the Land of the Tarahumara\". (In 1976, an English translation was published under the title \"The Peyote Dance\".) The content of this work closely resembles the poems of his later days, concerned primarily with the supernatural. Artaud also recorded his horrific withdrawal from heroin upon entering the land of the Tarahumaras. Having deserted his last supply of the drug at a mountainside, he literally had to be hoisted onto his horse and soon resembled, in his words, \"a giant, inflamed gum\". Artaud would return to opiates later in life.\n\nIn 1937, Artaud returned to France, where he obtained a walking stick of knotted wood that he believed belonged not only to St. Patrick, but also Lucifer and Jesus Christ. Artaud traveled to Ireland, landing at Cobh and travelling to Galway in an effort to return the staff, though speaking very little English, and no Irish whatsoever, he was unable to make himself understood. He would not have been admitted at Cobh, according to Irish government documents, except that he carried a letter of introduction from the Paris embassy. Most of his trip was spent in a hotel room he was unable to pay for. He was forcibly removed from the grounds of Milltown House, a Jesuit community, when he refused to leave. Before deportation he was briefly confined in the notorious Mountjoy Prison. According to Irish Government papers he was deported as \"a destitute and undesirable alien\". On his return trip by ship, Artaud believed he was being attacked by two crew members, and he retaliated. He was arrested and put in a straitjacket.\n\nHis best-known work, \"The Theatre and Its Double\", was published in 1938. This book contained the two manifestos of the Theatre of Cruelty. There, \"he proposed a theatre that was in effect a return to magic and ritual and he sought to create a new theatrical language of totem and gesture – a language of space devoid of dialogue that would appeal to all the senses.\" \"Words say little to the mind,\" Artaud wrote, \"compared to space thundering with images and crammed with sounds.\" He proposed \"a theatre in which violent physical images crush and hypnotize the sensibility of the spectator seized by the theatre as by a whirlwind of higher forces.\" He considered formal theatres with their proscenium arches and playwrights with their scripts \"a hindrance to the magic of genuine ritual.\"\n\nHis return from Ireland brought about the beginning of the final phase of Artaud's life, which was spent in different asylums. When France was occupied by the Nazis, friends of Artaud had him transferred to the psychiatric hospital in Rodez, well inside Vichy territory, where he was put under the charge of Dr. Gaston Ferdière. Ferdière began administering electroshock treatments to eliminate Artaud's symptoms, which included various delusions and odd physical tics. The doctor believed that Artaud's habits of crafting magic spells, creating astrology charts, and drawing disturbing images were symptoms of mental illness. Artaud, at his peak tried to commit even more harm from his insanity by lashing out at others. The electroshock treatments created much controversy, although it was during these treatments—in conjunction with Ferdière's art therapy—that Artaud began writing and drawing again, after a long dormant period. In 1946, Ferdière released Artaud to his friends, in which placed him in the psychiatric clinic at Ivry-sur-Seine.\n\nArtaud was encouraged to write by his friends, and interest in his work was rekindled. He visited an exhibition of works by Vincent van Gogh which resulted in a study \"Van Gogh le suicidé de la société\" [\"Van Gogh, The Man Suicided by Society\"], published by K éditeur, Paris, 1947 which won a critics' prize. He recorded \"\" [\"To Have Done With the Judgment of God\"] between 22 and 29 November 1947. This work was shelved by Wladimir Porché, the director of the French Radio, the day before its scheduled airing on 2 February 1948. The performance was prohibited partially as a result of its scatological, anti-American, and anti-religious references and pronouncements, but also because of its general randomness, with a cacophony of xylophonic sounds mixed with various percussive elements. While remaining true to his Theatre of Cruelty and reducing powerful emotions and expressions into audible sounds, Artaud had utilized various, somewhat alarming cries, screams, grunts, onomatopoeia, and glossolalia.\n\nAs a result, Fernand Pouey, the director of dramatic and literary broadcasts for French radio, assembled a panel to consider the broadcast of \" Among the approximately 50 artists, writers, musicians, and journalists present for a private listening on 5 February 1948 were Jean Cocteau, Paul Éluard, Raymond Queneau, Jean-Louis Barrault, René Clair, Jean Paulhan, Maurice Nadeau, Georges Auric, Claude Mauriac, and René Char. Although the panel felt almost unanimously in favor of Artaud's work, Porché refused to allow the broadcast. Pouey left his job and the show was not heard again until 23 February 1948 at a private performance at the Théâtre Washington.\n\nIn January 1948, Artaud was diagnosed with colorectal cancer. He died shortly afterwards on 4 March 1948, alone in a psychiatric clinic, at the foot of his bed, clutching his shoe. It was suspected that he died from a lethal dose of the drug chloral hydrate, although it is unknown whether he was aware of its lethality. The clinic is located in Ivry-Sur-Seine, which is a commune in the southeastern suburbs of Paris.\n\nThirty years later, French radio finally broadcast the performance of \"\n\nArguably one of Artaud's most significant influences in shaping his radical ideas for the theater was Charles Dullin. Dullin, a cohort and collaborator of the celebrated French \"teacher-directors\" Jacques Copeau, André Antoine, and Firmin Gémier, founded in July 1921 what he referred to as a \"laboratory theater\" which he named \"Théâtre de l'Atelier\", located in Néronville, France. Dullin's goal when he created this theater, where he trained aspiring actors, was to create the \"complete actor\",\n\"to form actors with a general culture, which they so often lack; to inculcate them from the very beginning with solid principles of actors’ techniques: good diction, physical training; to expand their means of expression to include dance and pantomime; in one word, to form the complete actor.\"\n\nArtaud was taken on as an apprentice by Dullin in 1921, under whom he arduously trained for eighteen months, ten to twelve hours a day, with particular emphasis on mime, gymnastics, improvisation, voice production, and various exercises intended to heighten one’s sensory perception. By making contact with one’s surroundings, the actor was to get in tune with \"La Voix du Monde\" (the voice of the world), making way for \"Voix de Soi-Même\" (the voice of oneself), in order to be able to get the actor in tune with his true voice, with which he is to express himself on stage. Perhaps the most evident influence that Dullin had on Artaud's 1935 stage production of Percy Bysshe Shelley’s \"The Cenci\" were his improvisational exercises related to the five human senses, intended by Dullin as preparation, not for the stage. In his seminars, Dullin strongly emphasized that his actors must \"see before describing, hear before answering...and feel before trying to express himself\", often using bells, the sound of footsteps, and masks as preparation.\n\nThe actors were encouraged to forget the weight of their bodies, while using them more than their faces to express themselves, often wearing a full or half mask. It was this internalization process that interested Artaud most, often focusing on man's struggle against elemental forces, a significant theme in his Theatre of Cruelty and the 1935 staging of \"The Cenci\". Dullin recorded an exercise he gave to Artaud in which he was to mime his struggle against the currents of a river. Artaud was quoted as saying of Dullin, \"Hearing Dullin teach I feel that I’m rediscovering ancient secrets and a whole forgotten mystique of production\".\n\nIn Artaud's Theatre of Cruelty, he warned against the dangers of psychology in theater and strove to create a theater in which the mise-en-scène, everything present in the staging of a production, could be understood as a codified stage language, with minimal emphasis on spoken language. He voiced his concerns of the dangers relating to \"psychological equilibrium\" present in Dullin's vocal improvisation exercises, \"These exercises of improvisation reveal and sharpen true personality. Intonation is found within oneself and pushed out with the burning power of feeling, not achieved through imitation\". In his 1935 production of \"The Cenci\", it was these raw elemental forces and his wishes for the audience to feel the character's anguish that Artaud focused on.\n\nThe drama written by Percy Shelley contained themes of abuse, incest, violence, murder and betrayal. In Artaud's stage directions, he described the opening scene as \"suggestive of extreme atmospheric turbulence, with wind-blown drapes, waves of suddenly amplified sound, and crowds of figures engaged in ‘furious orgy’\", accompanied by \"a chorus of church bells\", as well as the presence of numerous large mannequins. In this scene, which is often referred to as \"the banquet scene\", Dullin's influence on Artaud is very clear, as both the sounds of bells and the sounds of amplified footsteps were present, along with the strongly emphasized theme of elemental forces. While Shelley's version of \"The Cenci\" conveyed the motivations and anguish of the Cenci's daughter Beatrice with her father through monologues, Artaud was much more concerned with conveying the menacing nature of the Cenci's presence and the reverberations of their incest relationship though physical discordance, as if an invisible \"force-field\" surrounded them.\n\nWhile Artaud implemented much of what he learned from his apprenticeship with Charles Dullin, the two butted heads towards the end of Artaud's apprenticeship, citing differences in their goals for the theater. Lugné Poe, influential French theater director in the symbolist movement, described Artaud as \"a painter lost in the midst of actors\". Artaud's strong interest in oriental theater, specifically Balinese and Chinese, was in part shared by his mentor Dullin, but Dullin, unlike Artaud, did not think Western theater should be adopting oriental language and style. He was quoted as saying of Artaud's influences from oriental theater, \"To want to impose on our Western theater rules of a theatre of a long tradition which has its own symbolic language would be a great mistake.\" Artaud's wishes that Western theatre be much more resembling of Oriental theatre was a major source of conflict between the two French actors/directors. Artaud's implementation of Dullin's sensory awareness exercises into the stage production were clearly observable in \"The Cenci\", Jane Goodall writes of the performance,\n\nArtaud's implementation of Dullins preparation techniques, not intended for the stage, in combination with the physical and symbolic language specific to oriental theater were Artaud's strongest influences in both the shaping of The Theater of Cruelty and his staging of \"The Cenci\".\n\n\"Encyclopædia Britannica\" describe his Theatre of Cruelty as \"a not very good primitive ceremonial experience intended to liberate the human subconscious and reveal man to himself\", and go on to say that \"Manifeste du théâtre de la cruauté\" (1932; \"Manifesto of the Theatre of Cruelty\") and \"Le Théâtre et son double\" (1938; \"The Theatre and Its Double\") both called for \"communion between actor and audience in a magic exorcism; gestures, sounds, unusual scenery, and lighting combine to form a language, superior to words, that can be used to subvert thought and logic and to shock the spectator into seeing the baseness of his world.\"\n\nIn \"The Theatre and Its Double\", Artaud expressed his admiration for Eastern forms of theatre, particularly the Balinese. He admired Eastern theatre because of the codified, highly ritualized and precise physicality of Balinese dance performance, and advocated what he called a \"Theatre of Cruelty\". At one point, he stated that by cruelty he meant not exclusively sadism or causing pain, but just as often a violent, physical determination to shatter the false reality. He believed that text had been a tyrant over meaning, and advocated, instead, for a theatre made up of a unique language, halfway between thought and gesture. Artaud described the spiritual in physical terms, and believed that all theatre is physical expression in space.\n\nEvidently, Artaud's various uses of the term cruelty must be examined to fully understand his ideas. Lee Jamieson has identified four ways in which Artaud used the term cruelty. First, it is employed metaphorically to describe the essence of human existence.\n\nArtaud's second use of the term (according to Jamieson), is as a form of discipline. Although Artaud wanted to \"reject form and incite chaos\" (Jamieson, p. 22), he also promoted strict discipline and rigor in his performance techniques. A third use of the term was ‘cruelty as theatrical presentation’. The Theatre of Cruelty aimed to hurl the spectator into the centre of the action, forcing them to engage with the performance on an instinctive level. For Artaud, this was a cruel, yet necessary act upon the spectator, designed to shock them out of their complacency:\n\nArtaud wanted to put the audience in the middle of the 'spectacle' (his term for the play), so they would be 'engulfed and physically affected by it'. He referred to this layout as being like a 'vortex' – a constantly shifting shape – 'to be trapped and powerless'. He also placed a great emphasis on sound rather than words or dialogue, by incorporating loud cries, screams, eerie sounds, or noises causing the audience to become uncomfortable. Words were an insufficient medium of expression.\n\nFinally, Artaud used the term to describe his philosophical views, which will be outlined in the following section.\nIn 1989 Norwegian actor-turned-director Lars Øyno made the performance of \"Elagabal\" with his colleagues at Trondelag Teatre in Trondheim, Norway. That led to the foundation of Grusomhetens Teater in Oslo in 1992. Using Artaud's manifestos as sources for a contemporary practice on stage, he made 23 plays in the theater of cruelty form. Øyno traveled in countries like India, Russia, Germany, Poland, UK, US, etc. A resurrection of the Theater of Cruelty attracted drama festivals in different countries. Yet Grusomhetens Teater is the one and only troupe in the world dedicated completely to Artaud's principles of theater.\nTo him, reality appeared to be a consensus, the same consensus the audience accepts when they enter a theatre to see a play and, for a time, pretend that what they are seeing is real.\n\nArtaud saw suffering as essential to existence and thus rejected all utopias as inevitable dystopia. He denounced the degradation of civilization, yearned for cosmic purification, and called for an ecstatic loss of the self. Hence Jane Goodall considers Artaud to be a modern Gnostic while Ulli Seegers stresses the Hermetic elements in his works.\n\nA very important study on the Artaud work comes from Jacques Derrida. According to the philosopher, as theatrical writer and actor, Artaud is the embodiment of both an aggressive and repairing gesture, which strikes, sounds out, is harsh in a dramatic way and with critical determination as well. Identifying life as art, he was critically focused on the western cultural social drama, to point out and deny the double-dealing on which the western theatrical tradition is based; he worked with the whirlpool of feelings and lunatic expressions, being subjugated to a counter-force which came from the act of gesture.\n\nArtaud was heavily influenced by seeing a Colonial Exposition of Balinese Theatre in Marseille. He read eclectically, inspired by authors and artists such as Seneca, Shakespeare, Poe, Lautréamont, Alfred Jarry, and André Masson.\n\nArtaud has been cited as a profoundly influential figure in the history of theater, avant-garde art, literature, and other disciplines. His work proved to be a significant influence on the Theater of the Absurd, particularly the works of Jean Genet and Samuel Beckett, and helped inspire a movement away from the dominant role of language and rationalism in contemporary theater. Artaud also had a significant influence on the philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, who borrowed Artaud's phrase \"the body without organs\" to describe their conception of the virtual dimension of the body and, ultimately, the basic substratum of reality in their \"Capitalism and Schizophrenia\". Poet Allen Ginsberg claimed his introduction to Artaud, specifically \"To Have Done with the Judgement of god\", by Carl Solomon had a tremendous influence on his most famous poem \"Howl\".\n\nTheatrical practitioner Peter Brook took inspiration from Artaud's \"Theatre of Cruelty\" in a series of workshops that led up to his Royal Shakespeare Company production of \"Marat/Sade\" in 1964, which was performed in New York and Paris as well as London. The Living Theatre was also heavily influenced by Artaud, as was much English-language experimental theatre and performance art; Karen Finley, Spalding Gray, Liz LeCompte, Richard Foreman, Charles Marowitz, Sam Shepard, Joseph Chaikin, and more all named Artaud as one of their influences. In the winter of 1968, Williams College offered a dedicated intersession class in Artaudian theater, resulting in a week-long \"Festival of Cruelty,\" under the direction of Keith Fowler. The Festival included productions of \"The Jet of Blood, All Writing is Pig Shit\", and several original ritualized performances, one based on the Texas Tower killings and another created as an ensemble catharsis called \"The Resurrection of Pig Man\".\n\nCharles Marowitz's play \"Artaud at Rodez\" is about the relationship between Artaud and Dr. Ferdière during Artaud's confinement at the psychiatric hospital in Rodez; the play was first performed in 1976 at the Teatro a Trastavere in Rome. The writer and actor Tim Dalgleish wrote and produced the play ‘The Life and Theatre of Antonin Artaud’ (originally called ‘Pigshit’) for the English physical theatre company Bare Bones in 1999. The play told Artaud's story from his early years of aspiration when he wished to be part to the establishment, through to his final years as a suffering, iconoclastic outsider.In Canada, playwright Gary Botting created a series of Artaudian \"happenings\" from \"The Aeolian Stringer\" to \"Zen Rock Festival\", and produced a dozen plays with an Artaudian theme, including \"Prometheus Re-Bound\". The Latin American dramatic novel \"Yo-Yo Boing!\" by Giannina Braschi includes a debate between artists and poets concerning the merits of Artaud's \"multiple talents\" in comparison to the singular talents of other French writers. The band Bauhaus included a song about the playwright, called \"Antonin Artaud\", on their album \"Burning from the Inside\". Influential Argentine hard rock band Pescado Rabioso recorded an album titled \"Artaud\". Their leader Luis Alberto Spinetta wrote the lyrics partly basing them on Artaud's writings. Composer John Zorn has written many works inspired by and dedicated to Artaud, including seven CDs: \"Astronome\", \"\", \"Six Litanies for Heliogabalus\", \"The Crucible\", \"Ipsissimus\", \"\" and \"The Last Judgment\", a monodrama for voice and orchestra inspired by Artaud's late drawings \"La Machine de l'être\" (2000), \"Le Momo\" (1999) for violin and piano, and \"Suppots et Suppliciations\" (2012) for full orchestra. Filmmaker E. Elias Merhige, during an interview by writer Scott Nicolay, cited the writings of Artaud as a key influence for the experimental film \"Begotten\".\n\n\nWorks by Artaud\n\nIn English\n\nIn French\n\nIn German\n\n"}

It features an ensemble cast including Damon Wayans, Jada Pinkett Smith, Savion Glover, Tommy Davidson, Michael Rapaport and Mos Def.\n\nThe film was given a limited release by New Line Cinema during the fall of 2000, and was released on DVD the following year. Critical reception was mixed, and the film was a box office bomb.\n\nPierre Delacroix (real name Peerless Dothan) is an uptight, Harvard-educated African-American man in the employment of television network CNS. At work, he endures torment from his boss Thomas Dunwitty, a tactless, boorish white man. Not only does Dunwitty use AAVE and the word \"nigger\" repeatedly in conversations, he also proudly proclaims that he is more black than Delacroix and that he can use \"nigger\" since he is married to a colored woman and has two mixed-race children. Dunwitty frequently rejects Delacroix's scripts for series that portray black people in positive, intelligent scenarios, dismissing them as \"Cosby clones\".\n\nIn an effort to escape his contract through being fired, Delacroix develops a minstrel show with the help of his personal assistant Sloane Hopkins. \"Mantan: The New Millennium Minstrel Show\" features black actors in blackface, extremely racist jokes and puns, and offensively stereotyped CGI-animated cartoons. Delacroix and Hopkins recruit two impoverished street performers, Manray and Womack, to star in the show. While Womack is horrified when Delacroix tells him details about the show, Manray sees it as his big chance to become rich and famous for his tap-dancing skills.\n\nTo Delacroix's horror, not only does Dunwitty enthusiastically endorse the show, it also becomes hugely successful. As soon as it premieres, Manray and Womack become big stars, while Delacroix, contrary to his original stated intent, defends the show as satire. Delacroix quickly embraces the fame and recognition he receives while Hopkins becomes ashamed of her association with it. Meanwhile, an underground, militant rap group called the Mau Maus, led by Hopkins' older brother Julius, becomes increasingly angry at the show's content. Though they had earlier unsuccessfully auditioned for the program's live band position, the group plans to end the show using violence.\n\nWomack quits, fed up with the show and Manray's increasing ego. Manray and Hopkins grow closer, despite Delacroix's attempts to sabotage their relationship. Delacroix confronts Hopkins, and when she lashes back at him, he fires her. She then shows him a videotaped montage she created of racist footage culled from assorted media to shame Delacroix into stopping production of the show, but he refuses to watch it. After an argument with Delacroix, Manray realizes he is being exploited and defiantly announces that he will no longer wear blackface. He appears in front of the studio audience, who are all in blackface, and does his dance number in his regular clothing. The network executives immediately turn against Manray, and Dunwitty fires him.\n\nThe Mau Maus kidnap Manray and announce his public execution via live webcast. The authorities work feverishly to track down the source of the internet feed, but Manray is nevertheless assassinated while doing his famous tap dancing. At his office, Delacroix (now in blackface himself, mourning Manray's death) fantasizes that the various black-themed antique collectibles in his office are staring him down and coming to life; in a rage, he destroys many of the items. The police kill all the members of the Mau Maus except for One-Sixteenth Blak, a white member who demands to die with the others.\n\nFurious, Hopkins confronts Delacroix at gunpoint and demands that he play her tape. As he does so, Hopkins reminds him of the lives that were ruined because of his actions. During a struggle over the gun, Delacroix is shot in the stomach. Hopkins flees while proclaiming that it was Delacroix's own fault that he got shot. Delacroix, holding the gun in his hands to make his wound appear self-inflicted, watches the tape as he lies dying on the floor. The film concludes with a long montage of racially insensitive and demeaning clips of African-American characters from Hollywood films of the first half of the 20th century. Afterwards, Manray is shown doing his last \"Mantan\" sequence on stage.\n\n\nMost of the film was shot on Mini DV digital video using the Sony VX 1000 camera, and later converted to film format. This kept the budget limited to $10 million and allowed the use of multiple cameras to simultaneously capture masters, two-shots and close-ups to save time. The \"Mantan: New Millenium Minstrel Show\" sequences, and their sponsor ads, were shot on Super 16 film stock.\n\nThe soundtrack album for the film was released September 26, 2000 by Motown Records. The album consisted of hip hop and contemporary R&B, and was India.Arie's first time on an album, with six singles.\n\n\"Bamboozled\" received mixed reviews; it currently holds a 48% 'rotten' rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus \"\"Bamboozled\" is too over the top in its satire and comes across as more messy and overwrought than biting.\"\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film 2 stars out of a possible 4, writing that the film was \"perplexing,\" raising important issues but handling them poorly. \"The film is a satirical attack on the way TV uses and misuses African-American images, but many viewers will leave the theater thinking Lee has misused them himself.\"\n\nThe film grossed $2,463,650 at the box office on a $10 million budget.\n\n\n"}

Up to three players, as the Battletoads, brawl aliens and mutant rodents through six levels to save the universe from the Dark Queen. The game also includes vertical and bonus levels. Each Toad has its own signature attack, and as customary for the series, players can knock enemies towards the screen, breaking the fourth wall.\n\nRare took greater liberties with violence and gore in \"Battletoads Arcade\" since the product was not destined for home consoles. It was Rare's first game to use the 3D graphics technology later popularized in \"Donkey Kong Country\" and \"Killer Instinct\". Although the game playtested well and appeared to be financially viable, the publisher hesitated to release it. The game proved unsuccessful in the arcades and its in-production Super NES and Game Boy ports were canceled despite the latter being reportedly completed . They were going to be rebranded as Super Battletoads . Retrospective reviews were more positive--\"Retro Gamer\" even declared it the best of the series. \"Battletoads Arcade\" received its console debut when it was emulated in the 2015 \"Rare Replay\", a compilation of games from Rare's history for the Xbox One. \"Rare Replay\" reviewers were surprised by the quality of the arcade game and some considered it a highlight of the package. \"Battletoads Arcade\" currently remains the last released entry in the \"Battletoads\" series.\n\n\"Battletoads Arcade\" is a coin-operated, scrolling beat 'em up arcade video game. Up to three players, as the \"Battletoads\" (Rash, Pimple, and Zitz), punch and kick oncoming enemies through six levels to save their alternate universe from the Dark Queen. \"Arcade\" was the first \"Battletoads\" game to feature three-player cooperative multiplayer. Players control their characters with eight-directional joysticks and two buttons (attack and jump). Characters can run if the player pushes the joystick twice in the same direction. The Toads vary in fighting style: Rash is nimble, Pimple is burly, and Zitz is a balance of the two. As customary for the series, the Toads can knocked enemies offscreen such that they appear to fly towards the players, breaking the fourth wall. The Toads can also eat flies to regenerate health. Each Toad has its own signature exaggerated power and attack, in which their limbs turn into objects such as axes and drills. Enemies include aliens, mutant rodents, and snowmen.\n\nEach level has a unique theme, such as a \"Christmas grotto\", and a boss fight finale. Some bosses, such as General Slaughter, return from previous games. Some levels differ in presentation and gameplay. Some levels are \"Double Dragon\"-style 2.5D brawlers, while others are strictly two-dimensional. In one level, the Toads wear jetpacks and descend a tunnel, and in the final level, the Toads shoot enemies from a vehicle. Players can also destroy a spaceship in a \"Street Fighter II\"-style bonus stage. \"Battletoads Arcade\" is displayed in standard definition raster graphics in horizontal orientation with either mono or stereo sound within an upright arcade cabinet.\n\nThe game was developed by Rare, published by Electronic Arts, and released in 1994 as the fifth game in the \"Battletoads\" series. Rare founders Tim and Chris Stamper created the series in response to interest in the \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\". The \"Battletoads\" series—especially the 1991 original \"Battletoads\" for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)—became popular in its own right and led to a series of sequels. Since this sequel was in development for arcades rather than consoles, Rare took greater liberties in its depiction of violence, unlike their obligations in the rest of the series. While the original NES \"Battletoads\" censored blood, \"Battletoads Arcade\" showed gore and decapitation. The Dark Queen was also depicted in a more lascivious style. Rare had begun to experiment with 3D graphics around this time, and went with PowerAnimator (later Autodesk Maya). \"Battletoads Arcade\" was the first Rare game to use PowerAnimator, well before it was implemented in \"Killer Instinct\" and \"Donkey Kong Country\". Rare's George Andreas had worked on the game and recalled it sitting around \"for ages\" despite being finished. Andreas could not discern why the game was unsuccessful, as it had playtested and sold well in their market tests. A port for the Super NES was planned but canceled, likely due to the game's mediocre reception in arcades. Rare's Brendan Gunn had worked on the port and said that the team had nearly finished the first level before the project was scrapped. He figured that the decision may have been linked to mediocre sales but was not sure. \"Battletoads Arcade\" is also known as \"Super Battletoads\".\n\n\"Battletoads Arcade\" received its first console release as \"Battletoads Arcade\" when it was emulated for the Xbox One as part of the 2015 \"Rare Replay\" compilation of 30 games from Rare's 30-year history. In the \"Rare Replay\" version, additional features include a setting for unlimited continues, the ability to \"rewind\" time (and replay a section), and the opportunity to save game progress at any time.\n\nIn a 2013 interview, Rare's Chris Tilson said that the company had low expectations for future arcade releases after \"Battletoads Arcade\" \"bombed badly\". Sales were mediocre. Christopher Michael Baker (\"AllGame\") wrote that the arcade release rode the success of its console game predecessor when the order is usually reversed. He found the two games similar in brawling style with simple controls, but felt that the arcade game had better graphics. He noted how both included the effect of knocking enemies towards the players off-screen. Baker felt that the signature attacks were interesting and added replay value. Overall, he was somewhat let down by the arcade game, having expected something more, but rated \"Battletoads Arcade\" four of five stars. \"AllGame\" compared \"Battletoads Arcade\" to \"\" and \"The Simpsons Arcade Game\".\n\n\"Retro Gamer\" retrospectively wrote that \"Battletoads Arcade\" was a \"relatively obscure\" game, but the best in the series. They described it as \"unmistakeable\" Rare: \"bombastic, colorful, and well-designed\". \"Retro Gamer\" put it on par with the arcade games of Konami and Sega and praised its humor, combat, and character. They added that \"Arcade\" was a swan song for the series, with numerous references to moments and levels from previous games. For example, the first stage atop the Dark Queen's ship was similar to the opening of \"Battletoads & Double Dragon\" and the jetpack level was reminiscent of the \"Wookie Hole\" level in the original \"Battletoads\". The magazine added that the level of gore set it apart from previous series entries and that the game had a mediocre reception in arcades. They called its console cancellation \"a tragedy\".\n\nChris Carter (\"Destructoid\") wrote that the game was an unexpected favorite in his \"Rare Replay\" review. Philip Kollar (\"Polygon\") was also \"surprised\" by the game, which he found incredibly fun. Kollar ranked the game near the middle of the \"Rare Replay\" collection. Timothy Seppala (\"Engadget\") was grateful to be introduced to \"Battletoads Arcade\" on \"Rare Replay\". He considered the game among Rare's \"finest moments\" and one of two retro titles worth playing. Sam Machkovech (\"Ars Technica\") described the game as one of the rarest in the compilation.\n\nAs of 2017, \"Battletoads Arcade\" remains the last \"Battletoads\" game released. Rare had begun planning on a possible sequel in the mid-2000s but ultimately decided that there was no original direction for the game apart from its past. They did not want to repeat the failed \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" reboot. \"Battletoads Arcade\" served as an inspiration for the cooperative play mode in the 2011 \"\". \"Kotaku\" included \"Battletoads Arcade\" in its list of 16-bit era beat 'em ups with the best graphics.\n"}
{"id": "55822420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55822420", "title": "Bauerntarock", "text": "Bauerntarock\n\nBauerntarock (farmers' tarot) also called Brixentaler Bauerntarock, is a point-trick card game played in the Brixental, Austria. It may have originated in the 19th century as an adaptation of the 54-card Tapp Tarock game onto the cheaper and smaller 36-card German deck. Another possibility is that it was adapted from the 78-card Tarok-Ombre game as the ratio of trumps to non-trumps is almost the same. It uses the Skat Schedule found in popular regional games such as Jass and Schafkopf. It is closely related to Bavarian Tarock, Württemberg Tarock, and especially Dobbm. Like Bavarian Tarock and Tapp, Brixental Bauerntarock and Dobbm do not belong to the true tarot games, but have adopted rules from Tapp Tarock. The most fundamental difference between these games and true tarot games is in the use of German or French decks instead of true Tarot playing cards.\nThe cards’ trick-taking power broadly corresponds to their card point value. Thus the Deuce or \"Daus\" (\"Sau, Ass\") is the highest-ranking card. Then follow the: Ten > King > Ober > Unter > Nine > Eight > Seven > Six. This ranking is also valid within the trump suit as well as the plain suits. Hearts are permanent trumps.\n\nThe card values are exactly the same as in Schafkopf or the related game of Bavarian Tarock. The ten, with 10 points, is just below the \"Daus\" (11 points) in value, but well above the King (4), Ober (3) and Unter (2). The so-called \"Spatzen\" (\"sparrows\" i.e. the Nines, Eights, Sevens and Sixes) only play a role during the game based on their trick-taking ability, but do not score points at the end of the hand.\n\nThere are 120 card points in the deck. The 6 of bells is marked as \"WELI\" but has no significance in this game. The lowest trump, the 6 of hearts, however, is called the \"Spatz\" (sparrow) and plays a special role in bonuses and penalties mirroring the role of the \"pagat\".\n\nLike most Ace-Ten games but unlike other tarot card games, rotation is clockwise. In a three-player game, the dealer passes out eleven cards to each player with three cards going to the \"talon\" (stock). With four players, everyone gets eight cards with four going to the \"talon\".\n\nPlayers bid to become the declarer and play against the others (the defenders). Bidding starts with the player to the dealer's left. Tarock players have the following options:\n\nThe discarded cards or the unused \"talon\" will count towards the declarer's score at the end of the hand unless he failed to win any tricks. In this case, he is \"matsch\" and the talon is forfeited to the defenders. After bidding, any defender who passed has the right to double the score for the hand (240 or 480 points). The declarer then has the right to redouble (480 or 960 points).\n\nThe declarer's goal is to win a majority of card points. The declarer leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit (\"Farbzwang\"). If void, they must play a trump (\"Trumpfzwang\"). Only when void of the suit led and trumps can any card be sloughed. There is no compulsion to win the trick (no \"Stichzwang\"). The winner of each trick leads to the next one.\n\nThere is a penalty of 5 points for losing the \"Spatz\" to the opposite side; 10 points if it was on the last trick. There is a bonus of 10 points for winning the last trick with the \"Spatz\". These points are also subject to doubling.\n\nThe declarer's game score is calculated by subtracting half the points of the hand (60 points for no doubling, 120 for once, 240 for twice, or 480 for thrice) from the hand score (points from captured cards, \"Spatz\" penalties or bonuses, and the \"talon\" which may have been doubled, redoubled, etc.) After one player accumulates a game score of 100 or more, the number of new hands to play is limited to the current round (everyone should have had an equal chance as dealer). The winner is the player with the highest cumulative game score and the others have to pay the difference. The player with the lowest game score has to pay an extra 20 points to the winner.\n"}

It was released worldwide for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 platforms on March 26, 2013; an OS X port by Aspyr was later released on August 29, 2013 and a Linux port was released on March 17, 2015. \"Infinite\" is the third installment in the \"BioShock\" series, and though it is not immediately part of the storyline of previous \"BioShock\" games, it features similar gameplay concepts and themes. Irrational Games and creative director Ken Levine based the game's setting on historical events at the turn of the 20th century, such as the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, and based the story on the concept of American exceptionalism, while also incorporating influences from more recent events at the time such as the 2011 Occupy movement.\n\nThe game is set in the year 1912 and follows its protagonist, former Pinkerton agent Booker DeWitt, who is sent to the airborne city of Columbia to find a young woman, Elizabeth, who has been held captive there for most of her life. Though Booker rescues Elizabeth, the two become involved with the city's warring factions: the nativist and elite Founders that rule Columbia and strive to keep its privileges for White Americans, and the Vox Populi, underground rebels representing the underclass of the city. During this conflict, Booker learns that Elizabeth possesses strange powers to manipulate \"Tears\" in the space-time continuum that ravage Columbia, and soon discovers her to be central to the city's dark secrets.\n\nThe player controls Booker Dewitt throughout the game, eventually working with the AI-controlled Elizabeth. Like previous \"BioShock\" games, the player uses a combination of weapons, clothing called Gear that offer unique attributes, and psychokinetic powers granted through Vigors. Elizabeth's powers can also be used to help fight hostile forces. In contrast to the limited spaces of the underwater city of Rapture, the openness of Columbia provides for more dynamic combat, including combat that takes place aboard the city's Sky-Line rollercoaster-like rail system. Downloadable content for the game includes a story-based mission, \"\", that links \"Infinite\"s story to that of the original \"BioShock\" game.\n\nThe game won over 85 pre-release awards for its display at E3 2011, including Best of Show from the Game Critics Awards. At release, \"BioShock Infinite\" received critical acclaim, with praise particularly directed at its story, setting, and visual art design, and is often regarded as one of the best video games of the seventh generation of consoles. According to review aggregator Metacritic, it was the third-highest rated video game of 2013. Within two months of release, it sold over 3.7 million retail copies, and has since sold more than 11 million copies overall. It won year-end accolades, including Game of the Year from several gaming publications. A remastered version of the game was released on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on September 13, 2016, as part of \"\", alongside its predecessors. \n\nAn April 2018 article by Kotaku stated that a sequel to \"BioShock Infinite\" is in development, under the working name \"Parkside\".\n\n\"BioShock Infinite\" is set in 1912 and takes place in a fictional steampunk city-state called \"Columbia\"—named in homage to the female personification of the United States—which is suspended in the air through a combination of giant blimps, balloons, reactors, propellers, and \"quantum levitation\". The city of Columbia was founded by self-proclaimed prophet Zachary Hale Comstock, who used his connections in Congress to have the American government build the floating city. The government intended Columbia to serve as a floating world's fair and as a display to the rest of the world of the success of American exceptionalism. The city was launched to much fanfare and publicity at the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893, and was later dispatched to distant shores, travelling from continent to continent.\n\nInitially seen as the pride of the United States, tensions eventually rose between Columbia and the American government. In 1901, against the government's wishes, Columbia brutally and violently put an end to the Boxer Rebellion in Peking. This event revealed the floating city as a heavily armed aerial battleship, capable of unleashing devastation across the world. The American government subsequently demanded Columbia's return to sovereign soil, and, in response, Columbia seceded from the United States and disappeared into the clouds, its location soon lost to everyone else. Free from outside influence, Comstock now had complete control over the city, transforming it from a floating world's fair to a theocratic police state.\n\nUnder Comstock's rule, Columbia became a militant pseudo-Christian utopian society that worshiped him as a divine prophetic figure and the Founding Fathers of the United States as religious icons. Despite Columbia's apparent utopian exteriors, it is soon revealed to be a hidden dystopia. Institutional racism and elitism are widespread in the city, with white supremacy of the upper and middle classes heavily enforced by the government as law. Despite the drive for racial purity in Columbia, people of minority races are purposely brought into the city to exploit as a source of cheap labor. They are the underclass of Columbia, and commonly serve as indentured servants. As a result of this subjugation, minorities are largely relegated to menial and hard labor with no obvious opportunity for upward mobility. Racial segregation is also heavily enforced within the city, to the point where interracial couples face the risk of a public stoning.\n\nBy the time of the game's events, racial tensions have risen to the point where Columbia is on the verge of revolution, instigated by the insurgent \"Vox Populi\" against the government institutions and the counter-revolutionary \"Founders\". The Founders, led by Comstock, are the prevailing political faction in the city, and are the rulers of Columbia. The city's ruling class, they are the racist ultra-nationalists who seek to keep Columbia's privileges purely for White American citizens while denying the same right to foreigners. The Vox Populi (Latin for \"Voice of the People\"), led by Daisy Fitzroy, are a rag-tag anarchist-communist resistance group who fight to give the rights of Columbian citizenship to people of all races and religions. However, years of bitter struggle have driven them to fight the opposition more out of blind hatred, resulting in more violent and brutal methods.\n\nIn addition to the internal strife, Columbia is ravaged by \"Tears\" in the fabric of space-time. Being the result of past scientific experiments, these Tears reveal alternate universes, and allow for interaction with them. While most Columbian citizens regard these Tears as mere curiosity, some individuals have exploited the insight offered by them to create radically new weapons and technologies, while several others have replicated futuristic music and songs heard from the Tears, bringing anachronistic elements into the Columbia of 1912.\n\nAs with \"BioShock\" and \"BioShock 2\", the player is able to locate audio logs—Voxophones—and film projectors—Kinetoscopes—that will expand on the history and nature of Columbia beyond those events occurring within the game. Though the game takes place before the events of the previous two \"BioShock\" games (occurring in 1960 for \"BioShock\" and in 1968 for \"BioShock 2\"), the question of whether \"Infinite\" occurs within this same timeline remains unanswered.\n\nThe player controls protagonist Booker DeWitt (Troy Baker), a disgraced member of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency emotionally scarred from the acts of violence he committed at the Battle of Wounded Knee. Faced with mounting gambling debts, he is sent to Columbia to rescue Elizabeth (Courtnee Draper), a young woman imprisoned there since childhood, who has the ability to open Tears. Her confinement has been maintained by Songbird, a large, robotic bird-like creature who has been both her friend and her warden, and which has been programmed to feel betrayal should Elizabeth attempt to escape.\n\n\"Father\" Zachary Hale Comstock (Kiff VandenHeuvel), the main antagonist, is the founder of Columbia and the leader of the elite Founders who rule the city. Revered as \"the Prophet\" in Columbia, Comstock has maintained his power in the city through a powerful cult of personality based on Christianity and the Founding Fathers of the United States. The Founders are opposed by the Vox Populi, led by Daisy Fitzroy (Kimberly Brooks). Initially the servant housemaid for Comstock's house, Fitzroy fled after she was framed by Comstock for the murder of his wife. Shortly after her escape, she formed the Vox Populi and became its leader due to her hatred of the Founders' ways.\n\nRobert (Oliver Vaquer) and Rosalind Lutece (Jennifer Hale) are two mysterious individuals that direct Booker to Columbia and appear throughout his travels. Though they appear as twins, they are revealed to be the same person but from two different realities, having managed to figure out how to communicate and subsequently cross through realities. Rosalind is shown to be the one behind the technological wonders that keep Columbia afloat.\n\nIn July 1912, Booker DeWitt is taken by Robert and Rosalind Lutece to an island lighthouse off the coast of Maine. Told to \"bring us the girl and wipe away the debt,\" Booker enters the lighthouse, which doubles as a rocket silo and transports him to Columbia.\n\nBooker is soon pursued by the city authority when he is found bearing a scar of the letters \"AD,\" matching the description of the foretold \"False Shepherd\" who will corrupt Elizabeth and overthrow Columbia. Freeing Elizabeth from her tower, Booker narrowly evades her captor, Songbird. Reaching an airship, Booker promises to take Elizabeth to Paris; when she realizes they are going to New York City to wipe away Booker's debt, a tearful Elizabeth knocks him out. Booker awakens to find the airship under the control of Daisy Fitzroy, who offers to return the ship if Booker helps her arm the Vox Populi.\n\nBooker and Elizabeth join forces to secure weapons from a local gunsmith. However, several twists of fate result in Elizabeth having to overlay the contents of various Tears onto the present reality. Ultimately, they land in a world where Booker is a martyr of the Vox Populi whose \"sacrifice\" sparked open warfare between the two factions. Fitzroy, convinced that the non-dead Booker is \"either an impostor, or a ghost,\" turns her forces against him. With Booker's help, Elizabeth kills Fitzroy to prevent her from executing a Founder boy. As they attempt to leave by airship, Songbird attacks the duo and they crash back to Columbia. Continuing onwards, they unravel a conspiracy behind the city's founding: Zachary Hale Comstock had the Lutece twins construct a \"Siphon\" device to inhibit Elizabeth's powers; Elizabeth is Comstock's adopted daughter, whom he plans to groom into taking over after his death; and Comstock plotted to kill his wife and the Luteces to hide the truth. \n\nElizabeth is again captured by Songbird, and as Booker pursues, he ends up brought forward in time to 1984 by an elderly Elizabeth, showing him the devastation that Columbia is causing while attacking New York City. The older Elizabeth prepares to return Booker to 1912 and gives him information on controlling Songbird, in hopes he can recover her younger self and erase the years of torture and brainwashing she had suffered in becoming Comstock's tool. Once returned, Booker rescues Elizabeth, and the pair pursue Comstock to his airship. Comstock demands that Booker explain Elizabeth's past to her and the two begin to argue; an enraged Booker smashes the back of Comstock's skull on a baptismal font before drowning him. Booker denies knowledge about Elizabeth's missing little finger, but she asserts that he has simply forgotten. Controlling Songbird, the pair fend off a massive Vox Populi attack, before ordering Songbird to destroy the Siphon. \n\nAs Songbird turns on Booker again, Elizabeth's powers fully awaken, allowing her to open a Tear and transport them to the underwater city of Rapture. Booker and Elizabeth materialize inside the city, from where they see Songbird crushed outside by the water pressure. Elizabeth takes Booker to the surface lighthouse, explaining there are countless alternate lighthouses and versions of Booker and Elizabeth; they are within one of infinite possible realities dependent on their choices. She shows that on October 8, 1893, Robert Lutece approached Booker on behalf of Comstock, requesting that he \"bring us the girl and wipe away the debt,\" referring to Booker's infant daughter, Anna DeWitt – Booker's \"AD\" branding. Booker reluctantly agreed, but, having changed his mind, soon gives chase; Comstock barely escaped through a Tear, and its closing severed Anna's finger. Comstock then raised Anna as his own daughter, Elizabeth; her severed finger, which caused her to exist in two realities simultaneously, is the source of her ability to create Tears. Robert Lutece, angry at Comstock's actions, convinced Rosalind to help him bring Booker to the reality where Columbia exists to rescue Elizabeth. It is also revealed that Booker in fact willingly agreed to come to Columbia to save his daughter, but the mental strain of crossing dimensions caused him to rewrite his own memories such that he combined giving Anna away with his attempt to secure Elizabeth.\n\nElizabeth explains that Comstock will always remain alive in alternate universes, as the Luteces have enlisted the Bookers of numerous different universes to try to end the cycle. As stopping Comstock requires intervening in his birth, Elizabeth takes Booker back in time to a baptism he attended, in the hope of atoning for the sins he committed at Wounded Knee; she explains that, while Booker changed his mind, some Bookers in alternate universes accepted the baptism and were reborn as \"Zachary Comstock.\" Comstock, later aware of his connection to Booker and sterility from overusing the Lutece Tear machine, abducted Anna to provide a biological heir for Columbia. Booker, by now joined by other universe Elizabeths at the baptism, allows them to drown him at the moment of his baptismal choice, thus preventing Comstock's existence. One by one, the Elizabeths begin to disappear, the screen cutting to black on the last.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, a Booker awakens in his apartment on October 8, 1893. He calls out for Anna and opens the door to her room before the screen cuts to black.\n\nLike \"BioShock\" and \"BioShock 2\", \"BioShock Infinite\" is a first-person shooter with role-playing elements. In contrast to the limited spaces of Rapture in previous \"BioShock\" games, the expanded environment of Columbia provides for more dynamic combat challenges in \"Infinite\". As Booker, the player must fight their way through Columbia using weapons and a variety of tools in order to complete objectives. The player may carry only two weapons at a time, and can collect other weapons and ammunition either from defeated enemies or from random locations around the city. In addition to his health, Booker is also equipped with a shield. When damaged, the shield regenerates after a few seconds, while health can be replenished with medical kits or food. Should Booker die, the player revives in a safe area but loses a slight amount of money; Booker regains partial health and is granted additional ammunition, while local enemies are also partially healed. Players can still recover from death should they lose all their money.\n\nBooker gains powers and abilities through Vigors, Gears, and Infusions, all scattered around Columbia. Vigors, the equivalent of \"BioShock\"s Plasmids, grant activated powers such as creating shockwaves, releasing bolts of electricity, and machine/human possession. Vigors require Salt, the equivalent of magic points or \"BioShock\"s EVE, for powering their abilities. Salts can be found throughout Columbia, and are also granted upon death. Wearing Gears grant passive abilities that can improve the player's strength or damage resistance, similar in function to \"BioShock\"s Tonics. Each piece of Gear attaches to one of four specific slots: Hats, Shirts, Boots, and Pants. Only one piece of Gear can be affixed to a slot at a time; any extra Gear is stored in the player's inventory. Infusions grant the ability to permanently boost the player's health, Salts or shield meter by one stat; they also fully restore whatever is being boosted.\n\nAt certain points throughout the story, the player will be forced to make a choice in order to continue, each choice making minor changes on the story. For example, at a raffle at the start of the game, Booker wins and the raffle is revealed to be a front for a public stoning of an interracial couple. As a reward for winning the raffle, Booker is given the very first throw, and the player is given a choice to throw at the couple or at the announcer. If the player chooses the latter option, the couple appears later to thank him for sparing them, but if the player chooses the former option, the announcer congratulates him later in the game.\nBooker can traverse Columbia both on foot and by riding the \"Sky-Line.\" The Sky-Line is a roller coaster-like rail-based system — originally designed for moving cargo around Columbia but later used for personal transport — whereupon the player activates a wrist-mounted tool — called the Sky-Hook — that Booker and enemies wear to jump and hang onto the self-powered tracks. The player can jump onto, off of, and between Sky-Line tracks at any time, and may face enemies that use the system to attack; the player can use one-handed weapons in Booker's free hand while using the Sky-Line. Freedom of movement along the Sky-Line allows for several varieties of combat, including flanking, cover, and area-of-effect attacks through creative uses of the system. Booker can also dive off from the Sky-Line to strike enemies with his Sky-Hook; while on the ground, he can melee and execute enemies with it.\n\nOnce reunited with Elizabeth, the player must work with her to escape Columbia. The player does not directly control Elizabeth, but instead she reacts to the player and the current situation in a manner similar to the AI Director in \"Left 4 Dead\". Unlike \"BioShock\", where the player is tasked with protecting a Little Sister while escorting her, Elizabeth requires no protection and can take care of herself in combat. While the player is in battle, Elizabeth scavenges the area for supplies such as ammunition, medical kits, Salts, and other items, and tosses them to Booker as needed. She can also use her Tear-opening powers to aid the player, bringing in weapons, health, Salts, environmental features such as cover or a ledge for higher ground, and automated defense units. Only one Tear can be opened at a time, making the player decide between the available options to suit the battle. Elizabeth also has the ability to pick locks using her hairpin. However, she requires \"one-use\" lockpicks, found all over Columbia, to open doors or safes storing valuable or hidden items.\n\nWhile exploring Columbia, the player and Elizabeth can find various useful items such as cash, food, medical kits, ammunition and Salts. Vending machines, present throughout Columbia, can be used to buy supplies, and powerful upgrades for weapons and Vigors. Optional side-missions are also available, where the player must unlock safes or decode hidden ciphers; completing them rewards Booker with a handful of supplies, Voxophones and Infusion upgrades.\n\nAs the player progresses through the city, he is opposed by various enemies, classified into three types: Standard Enemies, Heavy Hitters and Basic Security Automata. Standard Enemies are regular foes consisting of several different human forces representing the Founders and the Vox Populi. Heavy Hitters are more formidable enemies, aligned with the Founders, who act as mini-bosses throughout the game, demanding new tactics from the player. They consist of: the Vigor-powered Fireman and Zealot of the Lady, the heavily armored Beast, the powerful robotic-like monster Handyman, the crank gun-wielding automaton Motorized Patriot, and the enemy-detecting Boys of Silence. The Vox Populi also possess their own versions of the Fireman, Beast and Motorized Patriot. Basic Security Automata are armed machines scattered throughout Columbia that act as a security defense system for the city, consisting of the fixed Gun and Rocket Automatons, and the flying Mosquito.\n\nAfter completing the story mode on Easy, Normal, or Hard difficulties, a \"1999 Mode\" is unlocked, where the challenge of the game is significantly increased. Enemies are much tougher, the player's navigational aid and aim assist is removed, and resource management is much more crucial to survival; also, the difficulty of the game cannot be changed while playing. Additionally, in this mode, reviving after dying uses up more money; should Booker die with less than $100, the game ends, and the player is sent back to the main menu and has to resume from their last autosave prior to the section where they died. Alternatively, 1999 Mode can simply be unlocked by inputting a secret code — the Konami Code — in the main menu. The mode is a callback to \"System Shock 2\", a video game developed by Irrational Games, released in 1999.\n\n\"BioShock Infinite\" was developed by Irrational Games and published by 2K Games, with Ken Levine working on the game as the creative director and lead writer. Irrational and Levine, who had previously developed the original \"BioShock\", passed on the opportunity to work on the sequel \"BioShock 2\" in favor of a new \"BioShock\" game with a different setting, with Take-Two Interactive allowing them the freedom to develop it. Work on \"Infinite\" began in February 2008, with the game's concept being formed six months after the original \"BioShock\"s release. Under the moniker \"Project Icarus,\" Irrational worked in secrecy on \"Infinite\" for two-and-a-half years prior to its announcement on August 12, 2010. The game's development took about five years, with it finally announced as going gold on February 19, 2013. Irrational's work on the game required a team of about 200 people, while also receiving substantial assistance from developer company 2K Australia, which was formerly part of Irrational Games.\n\nDuring the initial stages of development, Irrational originally considered several settings for the game, including reusing Rapture or setting the story in the Renaissance period, before finally deciding on the floating city of Columbia. The decision to set the game in Columbia originated after the developers and Levine read Erik Larson's 2003 non-fiction book \"The Devil in the White City\", which prominently featured the World's Columbian Exposition set in Chicago during 1893. The time period at the turn of the 20th century and the historical events surrounding it, such as the World's Columbian Exposition, inspired the game's setting as a city in the sky, while the concept of American exceptionalism, which the World's Columbian Exposition was considered to have symbolized, later inspired the game's story and setup. The game also incorporated influences from more recent events at the time such as the Occupy movement in 2011, and several films such as David Lynch's \"Blue Velvet\" and Stanley Kubrick's \"The Shining\".\n\nCentral to the game was the relationship between the player character Booker and the AI companion Elizabeth. Unlike \"BioShock\"s Jack and \"BioShock 2\"s Subject Delta, both of whom were silent protagonists, \"BioShock Infinite\"s protagonist Booker was given his own voice and identity. Elizabeth, a crucial element of the game, was designed as a character which could not only be a useful AI companion to the player but a real partner with a significant emotional bond as well. Elizabeth's development was inspired by the character Alyx Vance, who was described by Levine as a central element and an \"emotional driver\" of \"Half-Life 2\". For the story, Levine took a novel approach by bringing the voice actors for Booker and Elizabeth, Troy Baker and Courtnee Draper, respectively, into the studio to develop their characters and help refine the story. Levine, however, did not provide the actors with full knowledge of the story in order to help them develop their characters' relationship in a much more natural manner.\n\n\"BioShock Infinite\" runs on a heavily modified Unreal Engine 3, with additions and replacements on the core engine. Irrational had initially considered using the heavily modified Unreal Engine 2.5 used for the original \"BioShock\", but it was deemed inadequate for their vision. According to Levine, \"Infinite\" was designed and developed from scratch, with none of its assets taken from previous \"BioShock\" games. In terms of gameplay, Irrational designed the vertical and open-air spaces of Columbia to provide more opportunities to include various types of combat compared to the close-ranged limits of Rapture within the original \"BioShock\". As the game neared publication, numerous materials such as Vigors, Tear mechanics, weapons, locations, characters, and other enemies, were cut from it, with claims that enough material for five or six games had been scrapped during this process. Several members of the Irrational staff also departed near the end of the game's development, with their roles filled by replacements.\n\nLevine stated that the performance issues faced by the Windows version of previous \"BioShock\" games had been addressed by Irrational in \"Infinite\". He further added that the Windows version, enabled by Steamworks, would not use additional digital rights management software such as Games for Windows – Live or SecuRom. The retail Windows version would ship on three DVD discs to accommodate higher-resolution textures beyond the consoles versions, and would support video cards capable of running DirectX 11 in addition to DirectX 10, allowing for further graphical improvements to the game. Irrational also addressed another issue faced by the original \"BioShock\", in that the PlayStation 3 version of \"Infinite\" would not be a port and was being developed in-house simultaneously with the Windows and Xbox 360 versions. In addition, the PlayStation 3 version would support stereoscopic 3D and the PlayStation Move motion controller, and would also include a free copy of the original \"BioShock\" in North America.\n\n\"BioShock Infinite\" was released worldwide for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 platforms on March 26, 2013. Aspyr later published and ported \"Infinite\" to the OS X platform which was released on August 29, 2013. Two major pieces of downloadable content have since been released by Irrational for the game. The first piece is \"Clash in the Clouds\", a non-story arena-based combat mode where the player is faced with increasingly difficult waves of enemies on various maps based on in-game settings. It was released on July 30, 2013. The second piece is \"\", a story-based expansion set in Rapture that links \"Infinite\"s story to that of the original \"BioShock\" game. It consists of two episodes, with the first one released on November 12, 2013, and the second one on March 25, 2014. \"BioShock Infinite: The Complete Edition\", bundling \"BioShock Infinite\" with \"Clash in the Clouds\" and \"Burial at Sea\", was released on November 4, 2014.\n\nThe original score for \"BioShock Infinite\" was composed by Garry Schyman, who had previously composed both the scores for \"BioShock\" and \"BioShock 2\". Ken Levine stated that \"Infinite\"s score was different compared to that of the previous games in the series, in that it was \"sparer\" in \"instrumentation and the style.\" He felt that the game had a \"much more of an American feel to it,\" and added that team wanted \"a bit more of a frontier feel to it, slightly.\" Levine went on to comment that the score was partly inspired by Jonny Greenwood's score for \"There Will Be Blood\", which served as a \"good\" starting point, and Paul Buckmaster's score for \"12 Monkeys\".\n\nFrom the very beginning during development, Schyman opted for a completely fresh approach to the score for \"Infinite\" due to its differences with previous \"BioShock\" games. He said that compared to the previous games, \"Infinite\"s world and time period were \"completely different and unique in nearly every respect,\" and that it was \"much more fleshed out in terms of the characters\" with story being driven by the two main protagonists. Schyman noted that he worked on the score over an extended period of time, and due to the game's long and evolving development cycle, it took longer to find the right approach to the score. After much experimentation, Schyman found that using a simpler musical score was best for the game as he felt that it was consistent with the simpler time of 1912. However, Schyman stated that he did not limit himself to the music of the period, and added that while the game's setting of 1912 was very influential, it was not determinative. He said, \"I did not wish to imitate the popular music of 1912 which is not particularly emotional to our ears in 2013.\" Originally working with a more orchestral approach, Schyman later used very intimate small string ensembles with anywhere from three to ten players to compose the game's relatively simpler score. Schyman also called Elizabeth a critical element to the music, explaining that \"a lot of the music relates to her and some of the emotional things that she's going through.\" He went on to describe \"Infinite\"s music as \"more of an emotional score\" as it was about the relationship between the two key characters in the game, Booker and Elizabeth.\n\nLevine stated that choosing the licensed music for \"Infinite\" was much more challenging compared to the original \"BioShock\". He commented that with the original \"BioShock\", set in 1960 in the mid 20th century, it was easy to acquire musical pieces representative of the era, with him saying that the team \"had this huge slate of great music to choose from.\" Levine stated that with \"Infinite\", however, it was set in 1912 in the early 20th century, which had music he described to be \"awful\" and \"not very listenable\" to the \"modern ear.\" Consequently, the development team had to \"dig really deep\" and research extensively for more satisfactory music in \"Infinite\"s time period. Levine noted that he was not strict with selecting the music and songs that was accurate to the game's time period, as he felt that the most important thing with regards to the music was \"that you get people to feel things.\" He added that the game's fictional nature justified him and the team \"play[ing] a little fast and loose\" and \"[doing] things a little differently\" with the music. Levine also stated that \"Infinite\"s music would play a \"strange role\" in the game; he explained that the music would \"tie into the macro story, to some degree,\" and that the team had \"a lot of little stories\" to tell about it.\n\n\"BioShock Infinite\"s soundtrack, original music, and songs received numerous accolades. The game won for Best Song in a Game (\"Will the Circle Be Unbroken?\" performed by Courtnee Draper & Troy Baker) and was nominated for Best Soundtrack at the VGX 2013. It later won for Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition at the 17th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards, and won for Best Music in a Game at the 3rd Annual New York Videogame Critics Circle Awards. The game also won for Song Collection at the 2013 National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards, and won for Original Music at the 10th British Academy Video Games Awards. The game won three awards at the 12th Annual Game Audio Network Guild Awards for Music of the Year, Best Original Instrumental (\"Lighter Than Air\"), and Best use of Licensed Music.\n\nOne week after its announcement, \"BioShock Infinite\" was exhibited at Gamescom 2010, where it received its first awards there, winning IGN's Game of the Show and Best Xbox 360 Game awards. It was nominated for Most Anticipated Game at the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards, though it did not win. \"Infinite\" was on display for the general video game audience at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2011 (E3 2011), where it was heavily awarded, winning over 85 editorial awards, 39 of which were Game of Show. Most notably at E3 2011, the game won all four nominations it received from the Game Critics Awards for Best of Show, Best Original Game, Best PC Game, and Best Action/Adventure Game. For the second and third consecutive times, \"Infinite\" was again nominated for Most Anticipated Game by the Spike Video Game Awards in 2011 and 2012. The game also received two consecutive Golden Joystick Award nominations for One to Watch in 2011 and 2012.\n\n\"BioShock Infinite\" received critical acclaim upon release, with reviewers particularly praising the story, setting and visual art design. Aggregating review website GameRankings gave \"BioShock Infinite\" an average rating of 96% based on 17 reviews for the PlayStation 3 version, 93% based on 39 reviews for the PC version, and 92% based on 27 reviews for the Xbox 360 version. Metacritic gave the game a score of 94/100 from 27 critics for the PlayStation 3 version, 94/100 from 68 critics for the PC version, and 93/100 from 33 critics for the Xbox 360 version, with all three platform versions of the game considered to be of \"universal acclaim.\" According to Metacritic, \"BioShock Infinite\" was the third-highest rated video game of 2013 across all platforms, behind \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"The Last of Us\".\n\nConsensus among several critics was that \"BioShock Infinite\" was one of the best games of the seventh generation era of video game consoles, with IGN's Ryan McCaffery praising the game as \"a brilliant shooter that nudges the entire genre forward with innovations in both storytelling and gameplay.\" Joe Juba of \"Game Informer\" stated that \"Infinite\" was among the best games he had ever played, while PlayStation Universe's Adam Dolge called it \"one of the best first-person shooters ever made.\" Identifying it as a \"masterpiece that will be discussed for years to come,\" Joel Gregory of \"PlayStation Official Magazine\" concluded that \"Infinite\" was the latest game to join the hallowed ranks of \"Half-Life\", \"Deus Ex\" and \"BioShock\" as \"the apotheosis of the narrative-driven shooter.\" Even the usually acerbic \"Zero Punctuation\" critic Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw named it the best game of 2013, saying that he was still thinking about the game's ending months after having played it.\n\nMany critics favorably compared \"BioShock Infinite\" to the original \"BioShock\", with some even believing that \"Infinite\" had surpassed it. \"Entertainment Weekly\"s Darren Franich stated that \"if \"BioShock\" was \"The Godfather\", then \"BioShock Infinite\" is \"Apocalypse Now\",\" with Adam Kovic of Machinima.com calling them \"two similar-yet-separate games that can co-exist and remain equal in quality.\"\n\nWide acclaim was directed to the story, with several critics calling it among the best in video gaming. The story's exploration of mature themes was well received, with \"Time\"s Jared Newman praising its ability to prompt commentary and critiques from players as the game's true value. Several critics, including Adam Sessler of Rev3Games, also praised \"BioShock Infinite\"s storytelling, noting that its ability to finesse player agency and interaction resulted in a narrative that could only work in a game. The story's twist ending was mostly praised, with several critics predicting that it would provoke debate, and that it would leave a deep impression on players, prompting them to replay the game. It was also generally agreed that \"Infinite\"s ending was an improvement over the original \"BioShock\"s, with Gregory explaining that, unlike its predecessor, \"Infinite\" never lost momentum after revealing its twist. Some critics who overall praised the ending did concede that it suffered from plot holes and leaps in logic, with \"Edge\" calling it \"a finality that doesn't make sense within the universe the game has created.\" Several articles have since been released attempting to explain the game's ending.\n\nCritics particularly acclaimed the city of Columbia as the setting of the game, with Arthur Gies of Polygon stating that it was \"one of \"BioShock Infinite\"s greatest assets.\" Columbia was praised by some critics as one of video games' best settings, with Destructoid's Jim Sterling explaining that, unlike \"BioShock 2\", \"Infinite\" made a wise decision in abandoning Rapture \"for an all new story in an all new setting, introducing us to the cloud city of Columbia.\" The setting's visual art design drew praise, with Columbia being described as beautiful and gorgeous. Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar went on to describe \"Infinite\" as \"one of the most visually captivating games ever made.\" The setting's attention to detail was also well received, with critics impressed at how diverse the game's environments were, and how no two of Columbia's many different areas ever felt alike. Critics also enjoyed how the game encouraged them to explore more of Columbia, with Juba explaining \"whether you’re looking at a piece of propaganda, listening to an audio log, or participating in a horrifying raffle, almost everything you encounter contributes to your understanding of the floating world.\"\n\nElizabeth's role in the gameplay and narrative received wide praise. Her implementation as an AI partner for the player-controlled Booker was described by Sullivan to be \"downright ingenious,\" and was stated by some critics to be the main aspect that separated \"Infinite\" from its predecessors. Special praise was given not only to Elizabeth's ability to take care of herself in combat, but also for actively assisting the player by finding ammo and health, and opening Tears. Critics also acknowledged Elizabeth as not just a combat partner, but a companion that invoked an emotional response from the player. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell felt that the game \"creates a familial bond\" between Elizabeth and the player, with Sullivan stating that she felt like \"a friend.\" McCaffrey explained that Elizabeth's presence in the game provided motivation and emotional depth, something he believed the original \"BioShock\" lacked. \"Edge\" called Elizabeth \"a technical triumph, the most human-seeming AI companion since \"Half-Life 2\"s Alyx Vance,\" with Sullivan stating that her \"behavior makes you forget she's a video game character.\" Several critics also praised Elizabeth's relationship and interactions with Booker, believing that they formed the core of the game's story. Mikel Reparaz of \"Official Xbox Magazine\" explained that \"the evolving interplay between [Elizabeth] and Booker is the heart and soul of what makes \"BioShock Infinite\" such an involving, memorable experience.\"\n\nThe voice cast was well received, with Troy Baker and Courtnee Draper being particularly praised for their performances as Booker and Elizabeth, respectively. The audio and soundtrack also received positive responses, with Cheat Code Central's Josh Wirtanen stating, \"from the absurdly talented voice actors to the so-happy-it's-actually-creepy music selection to set the mood, this game sounds fantastic from start to finish.\"\n\nAlthough the gameplay's combat was mostly well received and praised, it was the most polarizing aspect of the game, with \"The Daily Telegraph\"s Tom Hoggins noting \"the gunplay is far from \"Infinite\"s most satisfying component.\" Nevertheless, critics opined that the game's gunplay and shooting was an improvement over its predecessors. The game's expanded environments were well received, with \"Edge\" noting they encouraged the player to think more tactically and improvise. Tom Francis of \"PC Gamer\" and Hoggins felt that \"Infinite\"s overall combat was an improvement over the previous \"BioShock\" games largely due to the dynamism of the expanded environments. The addition of the Sky-Line received special praise from critics. Sullivan felt that the Sky-Line \"delivers a new FPS experience entirely,\" while Gregory hailed it as a \"real game-changer.\" Critics also enjoyed the Vigors, weapons, and upgrades, with McCaffrey praising the game's \"myriad combat options.\"\n\nIn contrast, the gameplay was criticized by some as monotonous and repetitive, with \"VideoGamer.com\" Steven Burns explaining the game's lack of real sense of escalation in either abilities or enemies made combat very tiresome and grating. Some also noted that \"Infinite\" had regressed into a simple shooter compared to the role-playing \"System Shock\" games, with Newman stating that \"combat feels too constrained as a result.\" There were also complaints that middle portion of the game was padded by gameplay flaws. Critics expressed disappointment that the game limited the player to only two weapons, with Reparaz feeling that this, along with the lack of outlandish upgrades, made \"Infinite\"s \"less inventive\" combat \"not quite up to \"BioShock\"s high standards.\" Criticism was also directed at the combat's \"meager\" death penalty, with complaints that this resulted in a less challenging game.\n\nIn its first week of release, \"BioShock Infinite\" was the best-selling game on Steam's digital Top 10 PC Charts. In the United States, \"BioShock Infinite\" was the top-selling console game for March 2013, with more than 878,000 units sold; these figures do not include digital sales such as through Steam. Take-Two Interactive reported that the game has shipped 3.7 million copies to retail by their May 2013 financial report, and surpassed 4 million in late July. According to Take-Two Interactive, the game has sold more than 6 million copies as of May 2014, and 11 million a year later.\n\nDuring the first week of sales in the United Kingdom, \"BioShock Infinite\" debuted as the number one selling PC game, and the best-selling game on all available formats, topping the UK PC Retail Sales and the UK All Formats video games charts. In the game's opening week in the UK, its Xbox 360 version ranked #1, PlayStation 3 version ranked #2, and the PC version ranked #9 in the UK Individual Formats video games charts, due to 64 percent of its sales being on the Xbox 360, 31 percent on the PlayStation 3, and 5 percent on PC. As of April 2, 2013, it is currently the second biggest launch of 2013 in the UK after \"Tomb Raider\", and is the biggest UK game launch in the \"BioShock\" franchise's history with approximately 9000 more sales than \"BioShock 2\". During the game's second week in the UK, despite a 75 percent drop in sales, \"BioShock Infinite\" maintained its lead in the UK All Formats charts. In its third week, \"Infinite\" became the first 2013 game to top the UK charts for three weeks in a row.\n\n\"BioShock Infinite\" received numerous year-end awards and nominations after its release in 2013. It won the Game of the Year award from 42 publications, including the Associated Press, CNN, \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", \"Entertainment Weekly\", \"Forbes\", and \"Games\". The game also won Best Shooter of the Year awards from several publications, including \"The Escapist\", \"Game Informer\", GameTrailers, \"Hardcore Gamer\", IGN, \"Official Xbox Magazine\", and PlayStation Universe.\n\nIn 2013, \"BioShock Infinite\" won the award for Best Visual Design at the 31st Golden Joystick Awards, while also receiving further nominations for Game of the Year, Best Storytelling, Studio of the Year (Irrational Games), and Best Gaming Moment (Hallelujah); Ken Levine also received the inaugural Golden Joystick Lifetime Achievement Award for his accomplishments in video gaming. The 5th Annual Inside Gaming Awards saw the game receive two awards for Best Art and Best Story, while also being nominated for Game of the Year, Most Immersive, Best Voice Acting, Best Additional Content (\"Burial at Sea - Episode One\"), and Gamers' Choice. At the VGX 2013, \"Infinite\" won three awards for Best Shooter, Best Song in a Game (\"Will the Circle Be Unbroken?\"), and Character of the Year (The Lutece Twins); it received six additional nominations for Game of the Year, Studio of the Year (Irrational Games), Best Xbox Game, Best Voice Actor (Troy Baker), Best Voice Actress (Courtnee Draper), and Best Soundtrack.\n\nIn 2014, \"BioShock Infinite\" won two awards at the 17th Annual D.I.C.E.

It was also nominated for Outstanding Action / Adventure Video Game at the 18th Satellite Awards. \"Infinite\" won for Original Music at the 10th British Academy Video Games Awards, while also receiving three further nominations for Artistic Achievement, Audio Achievement, and Performer (Courtnee Draper). It won all two nominations it received at the 14th Annual Game Developers Choice Awards for Best Audio and Best Visual Art. The game won three awards at the 12th Annual Game Audio Network Guild Awards including Music of the Year, and was nominated for four more including Audio of the Year.\n\n\"BioShock Infinite\" has appeared on several \"Top Games\" lists by various publications. In July 2013, GamesRadar ranked the game's story number eleven on its list of \"The Best Videogame Stories Ever.\" In September 2013, \"Official Xbox Magazine\" included the game on its list of the \"Best Xbox Games.\" That same month, IGN placed \"Infinite\" at number thirty-one on its \"Top 100 First-Person Shooters\" list, and at number twelve on its list of \"The Top 25 Xbox 360 Games.\" In October 2013, WatchMojo.com placed \"Infinite\"s story at number one its list of the \"Top 10 Video Games With Great Stories.\" In November 2013, Eurogamer ranked \"Infinite\" number twenty-five on its \"Games of the Generation: The Top 50\" list, while \"Hardcore Gamer\" ranked it number twelve on its list of the \"Top 100 Games of the Generation.\" That same month, \"Complex\" placed \"Infinite\" at number twenty on its \"The Greatest Xbox 360 Video Games of the Last Generation\" list, while PlayStation Universe placed it at number eight on its \"The Top 100 Games Of The PS3 Generation\" list. In December 2013, \"PlayStation Official Magazine\" ranked \"Infinite\" number five on its \"Greatest PS3 Games – The Best of the Generation\" list, and praised its story as \"perhaps the best narrative of the entire generation.\"\n\nShawn Robertson, the game's lead artist, stated that, despite the several themes the game would explore, the story in the end was not about them. Robertson explained that the themes were there to serve as a backdrop and to frame a \"more human-sized\" and emotionally resonant story about individuals. He went on to say that, while the \"opera-sized story\" and \"the political turmoil\" would serve as the background, the story was ultimately about Booker and Elizabeth.\n\nKen Levine, the creative lead of the game, stated that players are supposed to draw their own conclusions from the game, and ultimately decide \"what is good and bad.\" He explained that \"there are many parts of \"Infinite\" that are open to interpretation, and the purpose is that you draw your own theories from them.\" To this end, Levine avoided providing an authoritative final answer regarding the game's ending, replying \"What actually matters is what people think. Why does my interpretation matter more than yours?\" Acknowledging that \"Infinite\"s themes left fans debating and frustrated, Levine was nevertheless satisfied by the game's opacity, stating that it was his intent, and compared the game's interpretation of quantum mechanics to some of his favorite films; \"\", \"Fight Club\", \"The Master\", \"Miller's Crossing\", and \"There Will Be Blood\". Rob Crossley of CVG stated that \"To [Levine], the [game's] Many Worlds Theory is a storytelling device; one that gives his narrative something unique in games yet celebrated in film: interpretability.\n\nLevine claimed that the core messages in \"Infinite\" were neither personal nor political, insisting instead that they were historical. In response to people discussing Columbia \"as a particularly racist society,\" he said that the game was making no particular point about the theme of racism and that the game's depiction of it was merely \"more a factor of the time.\" The racism portrayed in Columbia was seen by Levine \"more as a reflection of what race relations in the U.S. were like in 1912;\" Levine explained that the game was \"less about exploring the good and bad sides of racism and more just a reflection of the time and how it impacted that era.\" He noted that several historic American figures such as the Founding Fathers, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt were \"men of their times,\" great men who were nevertheless racist because of the times they lived in. Consequently, Levine reasoned that the depictions of nationalism and racism were warranted in the game, saying that to not do so would be \"dishonest\" and \"strange\" to the time period. Many reviewers praised the game for its treatment of race.\n\nIn addition to racism, the game was interpreted as tackling political and social problems, as well as exploring several themes such as constants and variables, American exceptionalism, extremism, fundamentalism, nationalism, fanaticism, cultism, populism, religion, dichotomy, sameness, multiple realities, fatalism, choice, consequences, free will, hope, self-loathing, denial, rebirth, and redemption.\nThe game's theme of \"constants and variables\" received attention, primarily drawn towards the characters of Robert and Rosalind Lutece, who are shown to be key figures behind Columbia and the drivers for the game's events. In an early scene, they ask Booker to flip a coin, which has come up heads 122 times out of 122 flips evidenced by tally marks on both sides of the sandwich board worn by Robert) indicating that the Luteces have recruited a different Booker from a similar number of alternate realities, in order to accomplish their aims. The coin-flip is a \"constant\" present in every universe and is thus destined to always have the same result. This scene has been compared to works like \"The Garden of Forking Paths\" and \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead\", which have similar themes about the subject of choice versus fate. The story's theme of multiple realities in particular was also commented as drawing parallels with the fact that, in contrast to previous \"BioShock\" games, \"Infinite\" only had a single ending despite the in-game morality decisions it offered. \"Wired\"s Chris Kohler explained that, similar to how the alternate universes within the story all had their similar \"constants\" and different \"variables\", the game could be played through in an infinite number of ways, but that certain things would always be the same. Tom Phillips of Eurogamer agreed, interpreting Elizabeth's line (\"We swim in different oceans, but land on the same shore\") as meaning that, just like Booker's journey in different worlds, different players would have different experiences throughout the game but would nevertheless all reach the same ending. This has led some to identify \"BioShock Infinite\" as a metagame and meta-commentary on the whole process of players making different choices in games.\n\nSome have also inferred \"Infinite\" to be an alternate version of previous \"BioShock\" games, with comparisons being made between elements of the games such as the protagonists, antagonists, setting, and story. The story's theme of alternate universes and Elizabeth's explanation that \"There's always a lighthouse, there's always a man, there's always a city\" has been cited as reinforcement to this.\n\n\"Infinite\"s themes of racism, religion and an ideological society caused controversy. In the various reveals of the Founders and Vox Populi before release, Levine and Irrational Games were criticized by various groups; upon demonstrating the Founders, people that favored the ideals of the Tea Party including Levine's relatives felt the game was attacking that movement; on the announcement of the Vox Populi, Levine found some websites claiming the game was an attack on the labor movement, and one white supremacist website claimed that \"The Jew Ken Levine is making a white-person-killing simulator.\" Levine considered that \"Infinite\", like \"BioShock\" before it, was a Rorschach test for most people, though it would be taken negatively in nature and upset them, as his vision in crafting the stories was \"about not buying into a single point of view\". Some of the game's imagery has been used by conservative groups. In 2013, the National Liberty Foundation, a group in the Tea Party movement used a propaganda mural from the game espousing the Founders' racism and xenophobia on their Facebook page before its source was recognized and later taken down. Fox News created a logo extremely similar to the \"BioShock Infinite\" logo for a segment titled \"Defending the Homeland\" relating to immigration control.\n\nZachary Comstock's portrayal as a zealot was also deemed offensive to \"gamers with strong religious backgrounds,\" as a member of the \"BioShock Infinite\" development team even threatened to resign over the game's ending, believing the game was saying \"Being religious causes you to be evil.\" Comstock was altered after Levine spoke with this developer, who helped Levine to reconsider the notion of forgiveness in the New Testament and set to figure out why people came to follow Comstock and to understand the ecstatic religious experience they would be seeking. Levine did not consider this reinvention of the character to be censorship, instead a means to present the story better to a broad audience. In another case, a player that considered himself a \"devout believer\" of Christianity was offended by the forced baptism that Booker receives prior to entering Columbia proper, prompting him to request a refund due to being unaware of this content in the game. Patricia Hernandez of Kotaku considered that the baptism scene was \"admirable\" in the context of video games as an art form, and the scene elicited numerous responses on social media. The baptism scenes throughout the game were also interpreted by some not as a critique of Christianity or religion, but as a representation of themes such as free will, evil, rebirth and redemption.\n\n\"Infinite\"s graphic depiction of violence generated substantial discussion. Polygon's Chris Plante considered that the degree of violence in the game could detract it to players who are more interested in the game's themes and narrative. He believed that unlike films that are based on violence as part of their themes, \"Infinite\" does not attempt to rationalize its violence, claiming the \"magnitude of lives taken\" and the \"cold efficiency in doing so\" was \"unfamiliar to even the most exploitative films.\" Kotaku's Kirk Hamilton agreed, stating that while violence is a common theme across video games, \"[the] ridiculous violence stands out in such sharp relief when placed against the game's thoughtful story and lovely world.\" Hamilton acknowledged that \"Infinite\" likely would have been difficult to sell at the mass market if it lacked the first-person shooter elements, but still said that the violent kills felt \"indulgent and leering\" and unnecessary for the game. Cliff Bleszinski, the creative lead of \"Gears of War\", a series Bleszinski acknowledges as being purposely violent, agreed with these sentiments, saying he \"felt the violence actually detracted from the experience\". Dean Takahashi of VentureBeat felt that the game's nature as a first-person shooter limited its audience appeal due to the extreme violence inherent in the genre.\n\nRus McLaughlin of VentureBeat stated that the sudden onset of violence at the carnival at the start of the game was a necessary element to show that \"Columbia is not perfect. It's ugly, xenophobic, and ready to explode.\" McLaughlin also considered the message carried by \"Infinite\" about the extreme nature of the violent acts Booker commits to be tied to his redemption by the end of the game, that \"there can be no morality in an extreme\". Jim Sterling from Destructoid said that the violence in the game is justified because \"\"BioShock Infinite\" is a game about violence.\" He claimed that \"Though he (Booker) feels guilt for what he did, he's a violent man at heart, who inescapably resorts to butchery to solve his problems\" and \"His entire story is one of denial.\" Similarly, Sterling also pointed out that \"Columbia is a fake, a sham, with an atmosphere of horror under its manufactured surface.\" He believed that having a non-violent option would go against everything natural to the game itself and \"Those asking for a non-violent \"BioShock Infinite\" are asking for a different game entirely.\" He claimed that those asking for a non-violent \"BioShock\" were asking for \"yet more homogenization in games\" and \"\"BioShock Infinite\" is not your game if you want a non-violent exploration of its themes, because \"Infinite\"s themes revolve around violence as a core concept\".\n\nLevine defended the game's depiction of violence, stating that using violence as a narrative device was as old as storytelling itself and that it was \"a part of the storyteller's toolkit.\" He went on to say that art had a responsibility to authentically replicate and depict violence. He later explained that he felt \"the reaction to the violence [in \"BioShock Infinite\"] is more an expression of people building confidence in the industry's ability to express itself in more diverse fashions\".\n\nIn February 2014, while promoting \"\", series director Ken Levine revealed that \"BioShock Infinite\" would be Irrational Games' last game in the \"BioShock\" series, leaving the intellectual property in the hands of 2K Games, should they like to continue the franchise with another developer. That same month, 2K Games stated that the \"BioShock\" series will continue, telling \"Game Informer\" they \"look forward to exploring the next \"BioShock\"\". In May 2014, 2K Games stated that work on the \"BioShock\" series is continuing with 2K Marin at the helm. In a 2016 interview, Levine explained that the pressure and stress of managing a large team as he had to for \"Infinite\" had impacted his health and personal relationships, and rather than stay on to build a larger game, decided to leave the \"BioShock\" franchise.\n\nIn an April 2018 \"Kotaku\" feature on the state of Hangar 13, another development studio within 2K Games (which had undergone significant restructuring after the release of \"Mafia III\"), several employees stated that some Hangar 13 developers had joined a new studio in the Bay Area and were working on a project known under the working title \"Parkside\", which they stated was the next game in the \"BioShock\" franchise.\n"}

{"id": "40358742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40358742", "title": "Dark Horse (Katy Perry song)", "text": "Dark Horse (Katy Perry song)\n\n\"Dark Horse\" is a song recorded by American singer Katy Perry featuring rapper Juicy J. It was originally released on September 17, 2013, by Capitol Records as the first promotional single from Perry's fourth studio album, \"Prism\" (2013). Three months later, it was released as the third official single on December 17. Both artists co-wrote the song with its producers, Max Martin, Cirkut, and Dr. Luke, alongside Sarah Hudson. It was conceived by Perry and Hudson during a writing session in Perry's hometown of Santa Barbara, California, and Juicy J was later commissioned for a verse on the song.\n\n\"Dark Horse\" combines the genres of trap and hip hop, replicating what has been described as a \"Southern rap-techno mashup\". The track features a minimal production, with a \"seductive\" and \"mature\" tone to Perry's vocals, while Juicy J is featured on the song's intro and rapped bridge. Perry, in interviews, said she wanted the song to have a \"witchy, spell-y kind of black magic-y idea\", so she wrote it from the perspective of a witch warning a man not to fall in love with her because if he does, she will be his last. The song was part of a competition sponsored by Pepsi in which fans could vote via Twitter on whether they would prefer either \"Dark Horse\" or \"Walking on Air\" to be released as the first promotional single from \"Prism\".\n\n\"Dark Horse\" was a commercial success, charting at number one in Canada, the Netherlands and the United States. It also reached the top ten in almost 20 countries including New Zealand, United Kingdom, Sweden and Venezuela as well as the Digital Songs chart of \"Billboard\" magazine. Billboard identified Dark Horse as cementing trap music's place on the charts. Perry first performed the song live at the 2013 iHeartRadio Music Festival in Las Vegas on September 20, 2013. The song's first major television performance was at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards on January 26, 2014. \"Dark Horse\" was nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards. The song has sold 13.2 million units (combined sales and track-equivalent streams), becoming the second best-selling song worldwide for 2014.\n\nInspired by the 1996 film \"The Craft\", Perry and singer-songwriter Sarah Hudson wrote the first version of \"Dark Horse\" in Perry's hometown of Santa Barbara, California. Perry described the song as a \"juxtaposition\", as it mixed her, a pop music artist, with an \"urban kind of hip-hop-flavored background soundtrack\"; and its lyrics as \"witchy and dark\", written from the perspective of \"a witch warning [a] man to not fall in love with [her]\", and if so, she would be his last. Perry then asked producer Dr. Luke to contact one of his Kemosabe Records artists, American rapper Juicy J, for a guest verse. Juicy J complimented Perry as having a \"very professional\" work ethic and being substantially involved in the song's development. He said: \"My verse I did on that song, she was singing it. She's really a genius, she was by the mixing board and telling the guy what to take in and take out. She's really hands-on with her music, she knows music.\"\n\n\"Dark Horse\" was recorded and engineered at Luke's in the Boo in Malibu, Conway Recording Studios in Hollywood, Playback Recording Studios in Santa Barbara, California, and Secret Garden Studios in Montecito, as well as MXM Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. It was engineered by Peter Carlsson, Mike \"Crazy Mike\" Foster, Clint Gibbs, Sam Holland, and Michael Ilbert. They were assisted by Eric Eylands, Rachael Findlen, Justin Fox, Elliot Lanam, and Cory Bice. It was mixed by Serban Ghenea, while John Hanes served as the engineer for mix. All instrumentation and programming was done by Dr. Luke, Max Martin, and Cirkut.\n\nIn a press release on August 20, 2013, Pepsi announced a partnership with Perry to promote her fourth studio album \"Prism\": a social \"tweet-to-unlock\" voting program, encouraging fans to tweet the hashtag #KATYNOW in exchange for song titles and lyrics. The chosen tracks for the campaign were \"Walking on Air\" and \"Dark Horse\". After the samples were revealed, fans could vote for which one they wanted to have an early release on digital retailers. The winner was \"Dark Horse\", which was released on September 17, 2013 on the iTunes Store. Due to its commercial success, it was sent to contemporary hit and rhythmic radio stations on December 17, 2013 as \"Prism\"s third official single.\n\n\"Dark Horse\" has been described as a \"Southern rap-techno mashup\", combining trap and hip hop, and has a length of three minutes and thirty-five seconds. Musically, the verses are built around icy rhythms and chopped and screwed vocal samples, while the chorus' feature Perry singing into a gradual crescendo. The song contains a grimy, \"incredibly simplistic\" production. According to Kathy Iandoli of MSN Entertainment, \"Dark Horse\" contains a mixture of elements from \"trippy pop\", EDM, and dubstep. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, \"Dark Horse\" is written in the key of B minor. It follows a chord progression of G – D – Bm – Bm/A, and the vocals range from the low note of B to the high note of D. \"Dark Horse\" has a tempo of 132 beats per minute in half-time style typical of trap music.\n\nA writer for the \"Winnipeg Free Press\" described the song as \"brooding, borderline sleazy trap-pop excursion that comes across like a stripped-down version of \"E.T.\" mixed with \"Grindin'\" by The Clipse,\" before going on to call it unexpected, unconventional, and unstoppable.\n\nMarc Hogan from \"Spin\" called the lyrics a \"cliché salad\" but believed that the song had potential to become a hit due to its \"soaring hooks\" and \"sleekly sculpted production\". Reviewing the song for \"Billboard\", Jason Lipshutz said that by exploring trap-influenced music, Perry \"score[d]\" and \"slay[ed]\". Digital Spy's Robert Copsey questioned the decision to not have a proper chorus in \"Dark Horse\" and the inclusion of Juicy J, though he praised the \"sleazy\" beat and \"sultry\" vocals from Katy Perry. He gave the track a rating of four stars out of five. Contributor Dylan Mial of Blogcritics said the \"juxtaposition\" of Perry's vocals and Juicy J's rap brought \"the ingredients for a perfect musical storm\" and favored Perry for the \"uniqueness\" of the single.\n\nKeith Murphy from \"Vibe\" called the track \"infectiously sexy\", while John Walker from MTV was similarly positive about the song, though he wrote that Juicy's verse was \"phoned-in\". Sal Cinquemani of \"Slant Magazine\" likened the song to avant-garde band Art of Noise's song \"Moments In Love\" and called it a \"continuation\" of \"E.T.\", and further labelled it as a \"standout\" from \"Prism\". While she did not give her opinion of the song as a whole, Helen Brown from the publication \"The Daily Telegraph\" criticized Juicy J for his \"daft\" rap. For AbsolutePunk, Craig Manning classified \"Dark Horse\" as \"Prism\"s worst song, while also panning the rapper's contribution. Marah Eakin from \"The A.V. Club\" was not entirely critical of the song, though she noted that it was not among \"Perry's best\".\n\nConsequence of Sound's Chris Bosman had a mixed response—while he praised the song for feeling \"vital\" and \"forward-moving\", he criticized the guest vocals and nonetheless deemed the trap influence \"trap for soccer moms\". Writing for ABC News, Mesfin Fekadu commented that \"her team fare[d] better\" in the song and observed that the \"Southern hip-hop and electronic flavors\" present on it were factors that made it \"work\". Pop music website Idolator's Sam Lansky opined that the \"weird trap-lite\" of the song \"never quite coalesces\". The song was nominated for Best Song at the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards, though lost to Ariana Grande's \"Problem\". It has been nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nOn the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, the song debuted at number seventeen on the week ending October 5, 2013. It also debuted at number four on the Hot Digital Songs chart with 194,000 downloads. In response to the unexpected success of \"Dark Horse\", Capitol Records executive VP Greg Thompson stated: \"Katy's well aware of [the success of] 'Dark Horse'\" and \"It might be the next single. We're watching it – and certainly appreciating the airplay – while still wanting 'Unconditionally' to have a full run\". In December, following its success as a promotional single, it was chosen as the third official single from \"Prism\". On the week ending January 11, 2014, \"Dark Horse\" sold 285,000 copies (up 158%) ranking at number 7 on Hot Digital Songs chart.

Perry also set a new record, becoming the only artist to have a number one single in each year of the decade thus far. The song topped the chart for four straight weeks, from February 8 to March 1. It was replaced by Pharrell Williams' \"Happy\". The song also broke Perry's record for her longest stay within the top 10 for one single - as \"Dark Horse\" has spent 22 weeks within the top ten so far, breaking her previous record set by \"E.T.\" of 20 weeks. The song has spent 52 weeks on the Hot 100 as of September 18, 2014, becoming Perry's first song to last at least a year on the chart. By May 2014, \"Dark Horse\" has sold over 5 million copies in the US, and become Perry's 6th song to surpass the 5 million mark. It became the third best-selling song of 2014 in the United States with 4.43 million copies sold for the year. As of February 2017, the song has sold 6.3 million copies in the nation, and been certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).The single have sold more than 17 million worlwide as of June,2018.\n\nAside from topping the Hot 100, \"Dark Horse\" has also topped Pop Songs, giving Perry her 11th number-one. This feat tied her with Rihanna for most number ones on Pop Songs chart. \"Dark Horse\" has also topped the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Songs thus becoming her 13th number one and breaking her own record for most consecutive number ones. Her earlier record which was established upon her second single \"Unconditionally\" topping the chart was 12 consecutive number ones.\n\nIn Canada, the song has reached the top-spot position, becoming the singer's tenth number-one single in the country and Juicy J's first.\n\nOn the week-ending September 23, 2013, \"Dark Horse\" debuted at number ten on the New Zealand Singles Chart becoming Perry's twelfth top ten.

The song also reached the top spot position on the Dutch Top 40.\nIn Austria, the Czech Republic, Norway and Sweden, the song peaked at number 2. \"Dark Horse\" also managed to reach the top 10 in Finland and Denmark where it respectively peaked at number 5 and 6. \"Dark Horse\" topped the Belgian Ultratop 50 Flandre chart and reached the top 10 in other European countries such as France and Germany.\nIn Italy, on the week-ending March 13, 2014, the song entered the FIMI official top 20 at number 17 and, after five weeks, it has so far reached a peak of number 5. It has also been certified gold for sales of 15,000 copies.\n\nIn an interview with \"Billboard\" at the 2014 Grammy Awards, Juicy J stated the video will be filmed \"soon\"; he added that it is \"a major motion picture.\" He further teased the release by saying, \"I can't really tell you because it's definitely going to be a surprise, but I'll tell you this much right here: you've seen her other videos, this one's gonna be just as big. Everything she does is like grade A.\"\n\nWhen \"Dark Horse\" had attained the top position on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Chart, Perry announced that she was working on the video. \" On February 6, 2014, Perry tweeted the video would be released \"soon\". On February 13, 2014, she released a preview of the music video onto her Vevo account on YouTube, revealing the Egyptian setting of the video. Perry played a character named \"Katy Pätra\", a takeoff on the Egyptian queen Cleopatra. The video was released on February 20, 2014.\n\nThe music video was directed by Mathew Cullen, who previously worked with Perry on her music video for the song \"California Gurls\". Perry's idea for the music video was to combine Ancient Egyptian culture with Memphis, Tennessee hip hop: setting the video in ancient Memphis, Egypt as a nod to Juicy J's Tennessee hometown. Speaking of Perry's concept, Cullen said \"That's music to my ears — when an artist has a couple concepts that they want to mash up to create something fresh.\"\n\nDuring the video's opening, it is revealed that the music video takes place \"a crazy long time ago\" in Memphis, Egypt. For the opening verses, Perry's character Katy Pätra, the witch of Memphis, is shown wearing a white dress and white and blue wig while floating on a large barge at sunset, with pyramids and palm trees visible in the background. The video transitions to a different scene where Pätra, now wearing a longer dress and a black wig, sits in an extravagant Sphinx-like throne while pharaohs gather to bring her expensive gifts (such as a large diamond) in an attempt to \"win her heart.\"\n\nAfter retrieving the first suitor's gift, she hits the man with a magical bolt of lightning from her hand, turning him into a pile of sand, and takes his jewels to wear on her teeth as a grill. Another suitor brings her candy, cupcakes, twinkies, and spicy cheese puffs. After she burns her mouth with the spicy cheese puffs, she turns the suitor into a large cup of water, which she drinks. Pätra also appears as a gray statue in a scene where golden pythons and gray guardian statues such as Anubis, Horus, Nisroch and Apep surround her, and in a scene with a blue background where she wears a golden dress and several golden hieroglyphs levitate around her.\n\nDuring Juicy J's verse, the rapper emerges from a gold sarcophagus while Pätra accepts an Egyptian chariot with hydraulics (she turns the associated suitor into a set of giant dice to hang from the frame) and rejects a suitor who turns out to have the face of a crocodile by turning him into a wallet. During the final chorus, the last suitor brings Pätra a large gold pyramid with a pink capstone, which she ascends. At the top of the pyramid, Pätra, dressed as Isis, uses her powers to conjure up a magical \"perfect storm\" with pink, purple, and violet clouds. Although it seems like Pätra has finally found a gift she likes, the final frame of the video reveals that she has turned the final suitor into a dog with a human head.\n\nThe music video was criticized by some for appropriating the symbols and imagery of Egyptian culture. Cullen, the director, defended the music video, saying that, while he believes it is dangerous to rip things directly from present cultures without adding anything to them, Ancient Egypt is part of what he calls our \"shared collective mythology\". He said: \"The most important thing is that when you create something, and this is actually something Katy and I worked to do — you bring a new spin to it.\" Egyptologist David P. Silverman praised the music video's use of Egyptian imagery and the interest it could generate to viewers: \"[Egypt has] always been a part of popular culture. It encourages people to think of these things, and some of those people actually begin to learn a lot.\" The video was noted by conspiracy theorists for bearing resemblance to imagery used by the alleged Illuminati, but Ritner rejected the allegations, saying that \"The many discussions of the Illuminati are nonsense\" and that, in fact, the masonic imagery associated with the Illuminati is drawn from Egyptian imagery (as a common source for both).\n\nOn June 9, 2015, the music video for \"Dark Horse\" became the first video by a female artist to reach 1 billion views on Vevo. Perry also became the first female to have a video on YouTube with 1 billion views. As of September 2018, the video has received over 2.4 billion views on YouTube, making it the fourteenth most viewed video of all time.\n\nThe music video caused controversy among some Muslims who criticized a scene in the video where a man wearing a pendant appearing to display the Arabic word for \"Allah\" is disintegrated and turned into sand by Perry's character. The scene took place 1 minute and 15 seconds into the video. A petition launched on Change.org accused Perry of \"representing an opposition of God\" and demanded that the video be taken down from YouTube. The petition reached over 65,000 signatures and as a response, the pendant was digitally removed from the video on February 26, 2014, after which the petition was closed.\n\nOn July 1, 2014, the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" reported that Christian rapper Flame and others filed a lawsuit against Perry, Capitol Records, and Perry's co-writers for infringing copyright on the song \"Joyful Noise\", which appeared on the 2008 album \"\". Flame's DJ, Cho'zyn Boy, stated that Perry's song is \"identical\" to \"Joyful Noise\", but ten BPM slower in tempo and one step higher in pitch. In addition to the infringement claims, the suit claims that \"by any measure, the devoutly religious message of 'Joyful Noise' has been irreparably tarnished by its association with the witchcraft, paganism, black magic, and Illuminati imagery evoked by the same music in 'Dark Horse'\". Rapper Lecrae, who is featured on the song and named in the lawsuit, clarified to MTV that \"I was in Hong Kong [when] the press release went out and it's not my song — it's my guy Flame's song and I respect everyone's intellectual properties — but that statement about the witchcraft and stuff, that's not my statement and I don’t stand behind that statement.\"\n\n\"Dark Horse\" was first performed at the iHeartRadio Music Festival in Las Vegas on September 20, 2013. It was later performed at the iTunes Festival in London. Perry also performed the song with Juicy J at the We Can Survive event at the Hollywood Bowl on October 23. Perry also performed \"Dark Horse\" on \"The Voice of Germany\" on December 13, 2013. Perry and Juicy J performed the song at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards on January 26, 2014. The \"dark and mysterious\" performance featured a \"haunted forest\" design with animatronic horses, broomstick pole dances, and a controlled fire. The singer also performed the song at the 2014 BRIT Awards and the performance featured a neon-colored Egyptian theme, like the music video.\n\nOn February 1, 2015, the song was performed by Perry during the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show, where she was on a chessboard, with her dancers as chess pieces. It was one of the most technical performance out of the rest of the performances.\nCredits adapted from \"Prism\" album liner notes.\n\n\n\n\n!scope=\"row\"| France (SNEP)\n\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"| Streaming\n\n\n"}

Fionnuala Halligan of \"Screen Daily\" also criticised the writing, saying that Watts' \"brave performance should not be under-estimated given the poverty of the dialogue and the pressure of the part.\"\n\nNaomi Watts received a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Actress for her work in both this film and \"Movie 43\", where she lost to Tyler Perry for his performance in drag in \"A Madea Christmas\".\n\n"}

{"id": "269067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=269067", "title": "Diner", "text": "Diner\n\nA diner is a small restaurant found predominantly in the Northeastern United States and Midwest, as well as in other parts of the US, Canada, and parts of Western Europe. Diners offer a wide range of foods, mostly American cuisine, a casual atmosphere, and, characteristically, a combination of booths served by a waitstaff and a long sit-down counter with direct service, in the smallest simply by a cook. Many diners have extended hours, and some along highways and areas with significant shift work may stay open 24 hours.\nEven today many diners share an archetypal exterior form. Some of the earliest were converted rail cars, retaining their streamlined structure and interior fittings. From the 1920s to the 1940s, diners, by then commonly known as \"lunch cars\", were usually prefabricated in factories like modern mobile homes and delivered on site with only the utilities needing to be connected. As a result, many early diners were typically small and narrow in order to fit onto a rail car or truck. This small footprint also allowed them to be fitted into tiny and relatively inexpensive lots that otherwise were unable to support a larger enterprise. Diners were historically small businesses operated by the owner, with some presence of restaurant chains evolving over time.\n\nDiners typically serve staples of American cuisine such as hamburgers, french fries, club sandwiches, and other simple, quickly cooked, and inexpensive fare, such as meatloaf. Much of the food is grilled, as early diners were based around a gas-fueled flat-top. Coffee is a diner staple. Diners often serve hand-blended milkshakes and desserts such as pies, which are typically displayed in a glass case. Comfort food cuisine draws heavily from, and is deeply rooted in, traditional diner fare.\n\nClassic American diners often have an exterior layer of stainless steel siding—a feature unique to diner architecture. In some cases, diners share nostalgic, retro style features also found in some restored drive-ins and old movie theatres.\n\nA crude precursor of the diner was created in 1872 by Walter Scott, who sold food out of a horse-pulled wagon to employees of the \"Providence Journal\", in Providence, Rhode Island. Scott's diner can be considered the first diner with walk-up service, as it had windows on each side of the wagon. Commercial production of such \"lunch wagons\" began in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1887, by Thomas Buckley. Buckley was successful and became known for his \"White House Cafe\" wagons. Charles Palmer received the first patent (1893) for the diner, which he billed as a \"Night-Lunch Wagon.\" He built his \"fancy night cafes\" and \"night lunch wagons\" in the Worcester area until 1901.\n\nAs the number of seats increased, wagons gave way to pre-fabricated buildings made by many of the same manufacturers which had made the wagons. Like the lunch wagon, a stationary diner allowed one to set up a food service business quickly using pre-assembled constructs and equipment.\n\nThe Transfer Station neighborhood of Union City, New Jersey was the site, in 1912, of the first lunch wagon built by Jerry and Daniel O'Mahoney and John Hanf, which was bought for $800 and operated by restaurant entrepreneur Michael Griffin, who chose the location for its copious foot traffic. The wagon helped spark New Jersey's golden age of diner manufacturing, which in turn made the state the diner capital of the world. In the decades that followed, nearly all major U.S. diner manufacturers, including Jerry O'Mahoney Inc., started in New Jersey. Jerry O'Mahony (1890-1969), who hailed from Bayonne, New Jersey, is credited by some to have made the first such \"diner\". The O'Mahony Diner Company of Elizabeth, New Jersey, produced 2,000 diners from 1917 to 1952. Only approximately twenty remain throughout the United States and abroad. Others more credibly credit Philip H. Duprey and Grenville Stoddard, who established the Worcester Lunch Car and Carriage Manufacturing Company in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1906, when O'Mahony was still just 16.\n\nUntil the Great Depression, most diner manufacturers and their customers were located in the Northeast. Diner manufacturing suffered with other industries during the Depression, though not as much as many industries, and the diner offered a less expensive way of getting into the restaurant business as well as less expensive food than more formal establishments. After World War II, as the economy returned to civilian production and the suburbs boomed, diners were an attractive small business opportunity. During this period, diners spread beyond their original urban and small town market to highway strips in the suburbs, even reaching the Midwest, with manufacturers such as Valentine. After the Interstate Highway System was implemented in the U.S. in the 1960s, diners saw a boom in business as mobile travellers would stop for a meal.\nIn many areas, diners were superseded in the 1970s by fast food restaurants, but in parts of New Jersey, New York, the New England states, Delaware, and Pennsylvania, the independently-owned diner remains relatively common. Since the 1970s, most newly constructed diners lack the original narrow, stainless steel, streamlined appearance, and are usually much bigger buildings, though some are still made of several prefabricated modules, assembled on site, and manufactured by the old line diner builders. A wide variety of architectural styles were now used for these later diners, including Cape Cod and Colonial styles. The old-style single module diners featuring a long counter and a few small booths sometimes now grew additional dining rooms, lavish wallpaper, fountains, crystal chandeliers and Greek statuary. The definition of the term \"diner\" began to blur as older, prefabricated diners received more conventional frame additions, sometimes leaving the original structure nearly unrecognizable as it was surrounded by new construction or a renovated facade. Businesses that called themselves diners but which were built onsite and not prefabricated began to appear. These larger establishments were sometimes known as diner-restaurants.\n\n\nInspired by the streamlined trains, and especially the Burlington Zephyr, Roland Stickney designed a diner in the shape of a streamlined train called the Sterling Streamliner in 1939. Built by the J.B. Judkins coach company, which had built custom car bodies, the Sterling and other diner production ceased in 1942 at the beginning of American involvement in World War II. Two Sterling Streamliners remain in operation: the Salem Diner at its original location in Salem, Massachusetts and the Modern Diner in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.\n\nLike a mobile home, the original style diner is narrow and elongated and allows roadway or railway transportation to the restaurant's site. In the traditional diner floorplan, a service counter dominates the interior, with a preparation area against the back wall and floor-mounted stools for the customers in front. Larger models may have a row of booths against the front wall and at the ends. The decor varied over time. Diners of the 1920s–1940s feature Art Deco or Streamline Moderne elements or copy the appearance of rail dining cars (though very few are, in fact, refurbished rail cars). They featured porcelain enamel exteriors, some with the name written on the front, others with bands of enamel, others in flutes. Many had a \"barrel vault\" roofline. Tile floors were common. Diners of the 1950s tended to use stainless steel panels, porcelain enamel, glass blocks, terrazzo floors, Formica, and neon sign trim. Diners built in the 2000s generally have a different type of architecture; they are laid out more like restaurants, retaining some aspects of traditional diner architecture (stainless steel and Art Deco elements, usually) while discarding others (the small size, and emphasis on the counter).\n\nDiners attract a wide spectrum of the local populations, and are generally small businesses. From the mid-twentieth century onwards, they have been seen as quintessentially American, reflecting the perceived cultural diversity and egalitarian nature of the country at large. Throughout much of the 20th century, diners, particularly in the Northeast, were often owned and operated by Greek-American immigrant families. The presence of Greek casual food, like gyros and souvlaki, on several diners' menus, testifies to this cultural link.\n\nDiners frequently stay open 24 hours a day, especially in cities, and were once America's most widespread 24-hour public establishments, making them an essential part of urban culture, alongside bars and nightclubs; these two segments of nighttime urban culture often find themselves intertwined, as many diners get a good deal of late-night business from persons departing drinking establishments. Many diners were also historically placed near factories which operated 24 hours a day, with night shift workers providing a key part of the customer base. All this meant diners could serve as symbols of loneliness and isolation. Edward Hopper's iconic 1942 painting \"Nighthawks\" depicts a diner and its occupants, late at night. The diner in the painting is based on a real location in Greenwich Village, but was chosen in part because diners were anonymous slices of Americana, meaning that the scene could have been taken from any city in the country-and also because a diner was a place to which isolated individuals, awake long after bedtime, would naturally be drawn. The spread of the diner meant that by 1942 it was possible for Hopper to cast this institution in a role for which, fifteen years earlier, he had used an Automat all-night restaurant.\n\nBut as a rule, diners were always symbols of American optimism. Norman Rockwell made his 1958 painting, \"The Runaway\", generically American by placing his subjects, a young boy and a protective highway patrolman, at the counter of an anonymous diner. In television and cinema (e.g. \"The Blob\", \"Happy Days\", \"Grease\" and \"Diner\"), diners and soda fountains have come to symbolize the period of prosperity and optimism in America in the 1950s. They are shown as the place where teenagers meet after school and as an essential part of a date. The television show \"Alice\" used a diner as the setting for the program, and one is often a regular feature in sitcoms such as Seinfeld. The diner's cultural influence continues today. Many non-prefab restaurants (including franchises like Denny's) have copied the look of 1950s diners for nostalgic appeal, while Waffle House uses an interior layout derived from the diner.\n\nManhattan was once known for its diners. The Moondance Diner was shipped to Wyoming to make room for development.\nDiners provide a nationwide, recognizable, fairly uniform place to eat and assemble, desirable traits mirrored by fast food chains. The types of food served are likely to be consistent, especially within a region (exceptions being districts with large immigrant populations, in which diners and coffee shops will often cater their menus to those local cuisines), as are the prices charged. At the same time, diners have much more individuality than fast food chains; the structures, menus, and even owners and staff, while having a certain degree of similarity to each other, vary much more widely than the more rigidly standardized chain and franchise restaurants. The Poirier's Diner and Munson Diner, both manufactured by the Kullman Dining Car Company of Lebanon, New Jersey, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nDiners almost invariably serve American food such as hamburgers, french fries, club sandwiches, and other simple fare. Much of the food is grilled, as early diners were based around a grill. There is often an emphasis on breakfast foods such as eggs (including omelettes), waffles, pancakes, and French toast. Like the British greasy spoon, the typical American diner serves mainly fried or grilled food, for example: fried eggs, bacon, hamburgers, hot dogs, hash browns, waffles, pancakes, omelettes, deep fried chicken, patty melts, and sausages. These are often accompanied by baked beans, french fries, cole slaw, or toast. Some diners serve these \"breakfast foods\" throughout the business day and others who focus on breakfast may close at around 3 pm. These are most commonly known as pancake houses. Coffee is ubiquitous at diners, if not always of high quality. Many diners do not serve alcoholic drinks, although some may serve beer and inexpensive wine, while others—particularly in New Jersey and on Long Island—carry a full drink menu, including mixed drinks. Many diners serve hand-blended milkshakes. The food is usually quite inexpensive, with a decent meal (sandwich, side dish, drink) available for less than ten dollars.\n\nThere is regional variation among diners with traditional regional American food. In Michigan and the Ohio Valley at \"Coney Island–style\" restaurants, coney dogs are served, as are certain types of Greek cuisine like gyros influenced by Greek diner owners. In Indiana and Illinois, fried pork tenderloin sandwiches are typically on the menu. The Northeast has more of a focus on seafood, with fried clams and fried shrimp commonly found in Maine. In Pennsylvania, cheesesteak sandwiches and scrapple are fixtures in most diners. Diners in the southwest serve tamales. In the southern U.S., typical breakfast dishes include grits, biscuits and gravy, and soul food such as fried chicken and collard greens. In New Jersey, the \"Pork roll, Egg, and Cheese Sandwich\" is a staple of many diners. Many diners have transparent display cases in or behind the counter for the desserts. It is common with new diners to have the desserts displayed in rotating pie cases. Typical desserts include a variety of pies, often on view in a separate transparent case. Most diners in New York and Chicago also offer cheesecake.\n\nSeveral foreign ethnic influences have been introduced into the diner industry. Many diners in the United States — especially in New Jersey, Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut — are owned or operated by Greek Americans. Eastern European owners, chiefly Polish, Ukrainian, and Eastern European Jews, are also typical. Italian Americans also have a notable presence. And in some places where there are significant Latino populations, Mexicans and Cubans may also have notable presences. These influences can be seen in certain frequent additions to diner menus, such as Greek moussaka, Slavic blintzes, and Jewish matzah ball soup, deli-style sandwiches (e.g., corned beef, pastrami, Reubens), and bagels and lox.\n\nDiners have figured significantly in American films and television since the form developed. In \"I Love Lucy\", the episode titled 'The Diner' shows the perils, pitfalls, and difficulty in operating a diner, to much comedic effect. Archetypal appearances include significant scenes in classic films such as \"Sullivan's Travels\" and \"The Killers\". The 1982 \"rites of passage\" film \"Diner\" was centered on an eatery shared by the protagonists. \"Waitress\" in 2007 was about a waitress in a diner., Television series include the Food Network show \"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives\". \"Pennsylvania Diners and Other Roadside Restaurants\", is a 1993 documentary.\n\nThe diner as an institution was iconically captured by painter Edward Hopper in his 1942 \"Nighthawks\", a vignette mimicked by a movie lead-in aired nightly on the Turner Classic Movie Channel. Diners are the focus of photorealist painter John Baeder who spent about 40 years painting diners across the US.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "56241785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56241785", "title": "Fake News Awards", "text": "Fake News Awards\n\nThe Fake News Awards was created by U.S. President Donald Trump to highlight the news outlets he said were responsible for misrepresenting him or producing false reports both before, and during, his presidency. On January 17, 2018, a post to the blog of the GOP website announced the winners. They included errors by journalists on social media and news reports that later issued corrections.\n\nPresident Trump first proposed an award—then called the \"Fake News Trophy\"—in a November 2017 tweet, stating \"We should have a contest as to which of the Networks, plus CNN and not including Fox, is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me).\" At the time, it was unclear whether he intended to actually create the award. In late December, Trump's re-election campaign sent emails to supporters with a link to an online poll asking them to rank three nominated stories as \"fake,\" \"faker\" or \"fakest\" news. Trump next mentioned the awards in a January 2, 2018 tweet. At this time, he called them the \"Most Dishonest & Corrupt Media Awards of the Year\", and wrote they would be awarded for \"dishonesty & bad reporting in various categories\". The awards were scheduled for January 8, 2018 at 5pm CST. In a January 7 tweet, Trump changed the date to January 17, citing increased interest in the award.\n\nSeveral late-night talk show hosts, including Samantha Bee and Jimmy Kimmel, satirically campaigned for an award. \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" displayed a billboard doing such in New York City's Times Square, with categories including \"Least Breitbarty\" and \"Corruptest Fakeness\", and Trevor Noah's \"The Daily Show\" bought a full-page ad in \"The New York Times\". \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" aired a sketch satirizing the Fake News Awards on January 16.\n\nThe ten stories awarded were from CNN (four times), \"The New York Times\" (twice), \"The Washington Post\", ABC News, \"Newsweek\" and \"Time\".\nAn eleventh bonus award was given to reports about Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections in general, which was called \"perhaps the greatest hoax perpetrated on the American people\".\n\nThe initial announcement of the winners was described by media pundits as a flop, because the Republican Party's website experienced technical difficulties and displayed a 404 error, along with a note that stated \"we're making it great again\". Eventually, a link to a working blog post was supplied.\n\nThe three stories on the online poll previously offered to Trump's supporters were ABC's reporting on Michael Flynn, CNN's reporting on Trump access to WikiLeaks documents, and Zeke Miller's erroneous report on the Martin Luther King Jr. bust.\n\nReaction to the \"awards\" was strong from different sources. Trump's supporters have seen the \"awards\" as a tongue-in-cheek approach to highlighting what they believe is media biased against the president, while critics have viewed them as an attempt to undermine freedom of the press.\n\nIn response to the Fake News Awards, the Committee to Protect Journalists announced on January 8, 2018, its \"Press Oppressors awards\". The group gave Trump the \"Overall Achievement in Undermining Global Press Freedom\" for inspiring cries of \"fake news\" in China, Syria, and Russia. Other awards went to Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Xi Jinping, and Aung San Suu Kyi. The \"awards\" were called an assault on a free press and the First Amendment by 2016 presidential candidate Evan McMullin. It was described similarly by \"The Guardian\", who called it \"a bizarre spectacle\". Trump was also criticized for the awards by Republican Senators Jeff Flake and John McCain. McCain, in an op-ed in \"The Washington Post\", commented that Trump's use of the phrase \"fake news\" is \"being used by autocrats to silence reporters, undermine political opponents, stave off media scrutiny, and mislead citizens\". Connecticut governor Dannel Malloy called the awards \"fascist propaganda\".\n\nOn Twitter, some media commentators congratulated the \"winners\", and others mocked the awards. The Twitter account for the \"New York Daily News\" expressed disappointment that it did not win an award. The journalist Chris Riotta joked that he was \"honored and humbled\" to be included in the awards.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3453407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3453407", "title": "Ghosting (television)", "text": "Ghosting (television)\n\nIn television, a ghost is a replica of the transmitted image, offset in position, that is super-imposed on top of the main image. It is often caused when a TV signal travels by two different paths to a receiving antenna, with a slight difference in timing.\n\nCommon causes of ghosts (in the more specific sense) are:\n\nNote that ghosts are a problem specific to the video portion of television, largely because it uses AM for transmission. SECAM TV uses FM for the chrominance signal, hence ghosting only affects the luma (video) portion of its signal. TV is broadcast on VHF and UHF, which have line-of-sight propagation, and easily reflect off of buildings, mountains, and other objects.\n\nThe audio portion uses FM, which has the desirable property that a stronger signal tends to overpower interference from weaker signals due to the capture effect. Even when ghosts are particularly bad in the picture, there may be little audio interference.\n\nIf the ghost is seen on the left of the main picture, then it is likely that the problem is pre-echo, which is seen in buildings with very long TV downleads where an RF leakage has allowed the TV signal to enter the tuner by a second route. For instance, plugging in an additional aerial to a TV which already has a communal TV aerial connection (or cable TV) can cause this condition.\n\nGhosting is not specific to analog transmission. It may appear in digital television when interlaced video is incorrectly deinterlaced for display on progressive-scan output devices. The mechanisms that cause ghosting in analog television may corrupt the signal beyond use for digital television. 8VSB, COFDM, and other modulation schemes seek to correct this.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "38051431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38051431", "title": "History of Canadian sports", "text": "History of Canadian sports\n\nThe history of Canadian sports falls into five stages of development: early recreational activities before 1840; the start of organized competition, 1840-1880; the emergence of national organizations, 1882-1914; the rapid growth of both amateur and professional sports, 1914 to 1960; and developments of the last half-century. Some sports, especially hockey, lacrosse and curling enjoy an international reputation as particularly Canadian.\n\nCanadian sports attract large numbers of participants and huge audiences; hockey, played by 1.4 million Canadians, has become part of the national identity. Team sports often involved informal gambling. More formal bigger-stakes wagering and prize competitions were characteristic especially of horse racing and boxing. In the 21st century the major team sports are hockey, baseball, softball, football, and basketball. Women, once shunted aside, are now actively competing in most of these sports; the nation celebrated the medal performance of its Olympic athletes. As in many modern nations the challenges faced by sports in recent decades include violence, racism, illegal drug therapies, ridicule of women, the increasingly disproportionate salaries of professional athletes, and the soaring cost of the newest model stadiums. Such problems stand in contrast to the fundamental values of sports including personal health, teamwork, striving for responsibility, loyalty, equality, winning, pleasure, and freedom.\n\nIndividual sports have long been important, including skating, skiing, golf, paddling, swimming, and track and field; in recent years there has been a surge of interest in more \"extreme\" sports such as snowboarding, rollerblading and mountain climbing.\n\nImmigrants brought along their favourite sports, often adapting them to the snowy environment. The influence of the games of the First Nations can be seen especially in the evolution of lacrosse. British officers, soldiers, and royal officials, and indeed ordinary British immigrants as well, transplanted such games as football, rugby, curling, and cricket; sailors brought rowing competitions. Britons considered these sports to be conducive to relieving boredom on remote outposts, and more generally produced team spirit, good health, hardiness, and manliness; they were a sophisticated alternative to \"blood sports\", such as cockfighting, bullfighting or bear baiting.\n\nParaschak, identifies two approaches to the history of Native American sports. On the one hand, there is the history of First Nation athletes playing within the Euro-American mainstream culture. Important topics include the issues of racism, exploitation, and ethnocentric distortion. Secondly there is the history of the sports played among the natives, especially the history of lacrosse as well as other games. The different tribes played (and wagered bets on) toboggan, snowshoe, and canoe races as well as archery, wrestling, spear throwing and running events. They provided entertainment for the community and a way to sharpen essential survival skills, including the ability to endure pain and hardship.\n\nThe roots of organized sports in Canada date back to the 1770s, often originating in horse racing at British military garrisons, curling in Scottish settlements, and lacrosse among the Indians. Perhaps the first athletic celebrities were the Canadian scullers who won several international championships.\n\nFrench Canadians by 1700 were influenced by native culture to the degree that they began to measure themselves and their masculinity against their native counterparts by competing against them in such activities as canoeing, snowshoeing, and tobogganing and in the team sport of lacrosse. In building on this mix of French and native traditions, the French Canadiens expressed not only their masculinity and identity through sports, but also built a sense of national identity that contrasted sharply with the Anglo spirit of sports for bourgeois gentlemen during the Victorian era.\n\nMuch of Canadian historiography on sports education deals with the linkage between sports education and the construction of a national identity. Hudon (2005) examines the history of sports education from 1870 to 1940 in Quebec's classic schools for boys from ages 11 to 18. He finds an impact of religious pedagogy on sports education, arguing that it promoted a Catholic spirituality with masculine undertones.\n\nIn Anglophone Canada a strong influence came from the ideals of English author and reformer Thomas Hughes, especially as exemplified in \"Tom Brown's Schooldays\" (1857). Hughes's notions that sportsmanship exemplified moral education and provided training for citizenship, have had a powerful influence on the Canadian sport community. Despite commercialism and the celebration of high-performance athletes, the Hughesian principles of Christian socialism continues to influence sports programs for youth. Outside of sports the social and moral agendas behind muscular Christianity influenced numerous reform movements, thus linking it to the political left in Canada, contrary to its right-wing reputation in other parts of the world.\n\nCanadians in the 19th century came to believe themselves possessed of a unique \"northern character,\" due to the long, harsh winters that only those of hardy body and mind could survive. This hardiness was claimed as a Canadian trait, and such sports as ice hockey and snowshoeing that reflected this were asserted as characteristically Canadian. Outside the arena Canadians express the national characteristics of being peaceful, orderly and polite. Inside they scream their lungs out at ice hockey games, cheering the speed, ferocity, and violence, making hockey an ambiguous symbol of Canada.\n\nThe advantage of the larger cities was the potential availability of a large paying crowd; the problem was providing cheap transportation for people not living close by. The solution was to use steamers, and later railways and trams to run special schedules to bring fans to an outlying event. As early as the 1830s steamers were making special trips to horseracing events to horse races. By the 1860s there were special trains or steamers to take fans to rowing contests, track and field events, bicycle races, and other contests.\n\nBaseball emerged in the 1870s, as a nonviolent, rules-oriented game that appealed to middle-class reformers seeking antidotes to crime, rowdiness and social disorder. However, when professional baseball emerged in the 1880s, unruly behavior by players and fans contradicted the reformers ideal of a gentleman's game played before a well-behaved audience. Gambling became a major feature, as did the rise of working-class players and rowdy working-class fans. The only solution the reformers found was to separate gentleman elite amateur baseball from the professional version that was getting out of control.\n\nAlthough many small cities and towns had their own local teams, the residents paid special attention to the celebrity players on the great big-city teams. Advancing technology of the telegraph, the radio, and television allowed real time reporting of major games, often to public gatherings or restaurants or bars. Further details were sure to appear the next newspaper, keeping up local interest, and wagering, on a daily basis. Vicarious participation as the fan of a particular team enhanced a sense of belonging to the Canadian nation and its rapidly developing popular culture.\n\nIn recent decades professional sports has involved large scale funding for stadiums. The intense interest shown by the fan base in their community's teams encourages the political leadership to invest heavily in public subsidies for new arenas. There is a \"honeymoon\" effect producing a surge in attendance in the first few years of the new arena. In the 1972-2003 era, the honeymoon effect for major new arenas in hockey, baseball, and basketball is an increase in attendance of 15-20% in the first few years. The honeymoon ends after 5 to 8 years.\n\nAs the popular daily press emerged in all Canadian cities in the late 19th century, they broadened their audience appeal by detailed coverage of local provincial and national sporting events. Readers developed a sense of community pride, while also involving fans in the national and international \"world of sport.\" The telegraph provided near-real-time coverage of events. Despite the vast distances separating them from other Canadians, local fans discovered that they were part of a common national audience as they followed the successes and disappointments of Canadian and American hockey and baseball teams, as well as such sports as rowing and boxing.\n\nIn the early 20th century the major sports set up volunteer national organizations to take jurisdiction; by 1914 there were 20 governing bodies. By 1919 the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada (AAU) presided over all leadership and provided international recognition. The AAU promoted participation in the Olympics. All the governing bodies saw sport as a suitable training ground or productive citizenship, allegiance to the social order, and English Canadian nationalism. They fought againstprofessionalism through a \"Canadian Parliament of Sport\". However, in the 1930s the amateur leaders split bitterly over the issue of a liberalized amateur code, as ice hockey, basketball and lacrosse walked out of the AAU. By 1939, the jurisdiction of the AAU was reduced to track and field and the other individual Olympic sports. The Canadian Olympic Association broke away in 1948.\n\nFrom 1909 until 1967, the Canadian Track and Field Association (C.T.F.A.) controlled track and field sports. It operated under the umbrella of the A.A.U. of C. (Amateur Athletic Union of Canada). In 1968, the C.T.F.A broke loose from the A.A.U. of C. The A.A.U. of C. dissolved in the early 1970s as all national the federations in the different sports went their own ways. In 1991 the C.T.F.A. changed its name to Athletics Canada.\n\nInformal stick-and-ball games on ice had been played for years, especially in the Maritime provinces and at military garrisons. In its modern form hockey was standardized by students at McGill University in 1875. The game rapidly spread nationwide; recognition came in 1893 when Lord Stanley, Canada's governor general, established the Stanley Cup. Ice hockey was distinctly Canadian; it was a winter sport with vague rules, played on conveniently available outside ice. There were few spectators. Professional teams appeared around 1900; in 1904, five cities in the United States and Ontario formed the International Hockey League (IHL). The American-based league paid salaries that attracted many Canadian stars. Canadian amateur teams were forced to secretly pay their players, even as they proclaimed the principles of amateurism. The IHL collapsed in 1907. in 1908 came the first Canadian-based professional league, the Ontario Professional Hockey League. The Timiskaming League, fuelled by gambling and mining profits, started paying players and raiding amateur and professional senior teams for players\n\nCanadians explored polar extremes of masculinity by a watching the Ottawa Silver Seven battle the Montreal Wanderers in 1907. Reporters depicted the game as a combination of \"strenuous spectacle\" and \"brutal butchery.\" Middle-class ideals of gentlemanly masculinity and genteel sportsmanship stood opposed to a rough, working-class expression of violent masculinity. They both coexisted within the fast, skilled, rugged, hard-hitting hockey, thereby appealing to the largest possible audience.\n\nBy 1910, the world of ice hockey had split into two worlds, the amateurs of the junior, intermediates and the seniors playing for the new Allan Cup, while the professionals took over as the elite leagues, playing for the Stanley Cup. From a combination of the money of the mining of Timiskaming and the industry of Montreal, the National Hockey Association (NHA) was formed. Unlike previous leagues, which were derived from amateur hockey associations, the NHA organized itself as a business, organizing each team as a franchise of the business and first used standard player's contracts and a salary cap. Professional ice hockey came to the west coast with the arrival of the Patrick family, organizing the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). Organized as a single business, it developed as an alternative elite league and furthered the development of ice hockey in western Canada. Professional ice hockey was established from coast to coast by this time. Although the PCHA eventually failed, other professional leagues were organized to take its place.\n\nIn 1917, the NHA became the National Hockey League (NHL). After a few weak years, the NHL grew with expansion into the United States. By 1940 it had strong bases in Montreal, Toronto, Boston, New York, Chicago, and Detroit—the \"original six\". After 1926 it became a cartel that controlled all aspects of professional hockey. Other professional leagues one by one collapsed. The NHL exerted its control by expansion into the U.S., the establishment of a minor league system.\n\nAt the same time, amateur hockey continued, and was still competitive with professional ice hockey. The Winnipeg Falcons, composed of Icelandic Canadians, was excluded from Winnipeg's senior hockey league for the 1919-20 season. Nevertheless, the team became Canadian national champions and won the 1920 Olympic gold medal in Antwerp. Combined with their willingness to volunteer for military service in the Great War, its success made the team a symbol of Canadian manhood, transcending the ethnic stereotyping and discrimination that affected some other sports teams during postwar era.\n\nWith fans having less discretionary spending during the Great Depression, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association faced financial uncertainty. Its response was to reevaluate its purist position on amateurism and to rethink its relation to the system of amateur sports, which was headed by the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada. The weak performance of the Canadian hockey team at the 1936 Olympics led to substantial changes in policies and procedures.\n\nThe NHL formed an affiliation with the major governing body in Canadian amateur hockey, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA). The alliances made with the minor leagues and the CAHA, in particular, gave the NHL's market control over players such as the waivers, reserve clause, draft, and territorial right much broader impact. Although the NHL only had six teams, they had control of the best players. Players could be signed for life to an NHL team's organization at the age of twelve.\n\nThe original six era cemented the NHL as the biggest draw in Canada, fuelled partly by the rivalry of the Montreal Canadiens and the Toronto Maple Leafs. The Canadiens' Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard (1921–2000) became one of Canada's iconic heroes, especially in Quebec. Playing from 1942–60, he scored 544 regular season goals and 82 more in playoffs. Famed for his dashing style of play, his intensity, determination, and scoring prowess, Richard became the first 50-goal scorer in NHL history in 1944-45, with a 50-game schedule. He was named to the All Star team 14 times, won two Hart trophies as league MVP, and led the Canadiens to eight Stanley Cups.\n\nAfter World War II, the amateur system declined in the face of competition from professional ice hockey, both in the growth of minor leagues, and the introduction of televised matches by the NHL. Several amateur leagues, such as the Quebec Senior League, became first mixed then fully professional. While senior play for the Allan Cup continued, fewer and fewer senior players were available. Further growth in hockey leagues in the United States led to further demand for players. By this time, several of the minor leagues had many players who could have played in the NHL, had there been more teams. By the 1960s, there was interest in setting up another professional league in the United States. In response, the NHL expanded to 12 teams, the new positions mostly filled by players from the minors. The control of junior players by the NHL went away at this time. The signing of contracts to under-age players, binding them to a single team was replaced by a draft of the available players by the NHL teams. The junior leagues became the pre-eminent Canadian leagues, discarding the control of the regional associations to set up \"major junior\" leagues. Senior amateur play dwindled further with the increase in professional positions.\n\nBy the 1960s, Canada had difficulty forming amateur senior teams to compete internationally. University players and a dedicated amateur national team were no match for the organized amateurism of teams from Europe, especially the Soviet Union. Finally, the Canadian ice hockey federation broke off from amateur play at the Olympics and world championships. The Canadians demanded that the organizations allow professionals, those considered Canada's best.\n\nIn September 1972, Canada's best hockey players from the National Hockey League (NHL) played the elite amateurs from the Soviet Union in a friendly series. Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau and his Soviet counterpart, Alexei Kosygin in 1971 proposed increasing the hockey competitions between the two northern nations. National hockey officials Planned series of eight games, four to be played across Canada and four in Moscow. Canadians saw the Summit Series as an affirmation of their global supremacy in hockey. However, the Soviets planned an upset that would impress the world and let them claim the Canadian game as their own. The publicity was enormous. The media portrayed a global contests pitting East against West - communism against capitalism - and many of the players were swept away with the sense of history in the making. The Summit series became a politically charged event with widespread cultural repercussions - quite literally, a Cold War. The Canadians fell 2 games behind but swept the final three games in Moscow to win the series four games to three, with one tie.\n\nThe Summit Series awoke an interest in developing the sport of ice hockey further in Canada. Before 1919, few safety rules existed in amateur hockey. By 1945, however, there were rules against boarding and hits from behind, and fighting was penalized more severely. By 1972, the professionals still did not wear helmets, required in amateur play. Fighting was still allowed in amateur and professional play in Canada. There was also an interest in further developing the quality of instruction. Canada returned to international play with the IIHF and the Olympics allowing professionals.\n\nAt the same time, the number of professional teams was expanding with the formation of the World Hockey Association. New professional teams were formed in Edmonton, Winnipeg, Quebec and Ottawa. Several of the teams made it into the expanded NHL in 1979, which now had professional teams from Vancouver all the way east to Quebec City. The 1980s saw a period of consolidation, and the introduction of European players into the professional teams of the NHL, made necessary by the expansion of the NHL. In the 1990s, the Canadian dollar declined, and while Canada gained an NHL team in Ottawa, teams from Quebec City and Winnipeg move to the United States.\n\nWomen's hockey continued to develop in popularity in the 1980s. The first women's world championship was held in 1990. Women's ice hockey became a medal sport in the Olympics of 1998. Women players developed to the point where professional leagues were organized and women players started playing in men's professional leagues.\nThe Memorial Cup, a tournament originated in 1920 for junior-level teams began to grow in popularity. The junior leagues also grew in popularity and expanded into United States near to the border. The junior leagues, like the professionals, started to allow non-Canadian players, partly in response to the American teams, and partly in response to the growing popularity and competition within its ranks to make it to the Memorial Cup tournament. The growth of cable television meant more junior-level games were televised.\n\nBy 2000, the NHL had grown to 30 teams and has not expanded since. The junior leagues had consolidated into three; in Quebec and the Maritimes, Ontario and Western Canada. The further introduction of European players became a concern and was limited. In 2002, Canada won its first men's ice hockey title in 50 years, at the Olympics in Salt Lake City, using NHL players. The Canadian team won another title in 2010, at the Olympics held in Vancouver, where the Olympics used Canadian standard-sized rinks.\n\nThe game of Soccer goes back centuries in England, where around 1823 was transformed into rugby. The first game in Canada came in the 1860s with British officers playing university students in Montreal. Universities quickly adopted the new sport, as did rowing clubs that found it useful in the off-season. The Americans were developing a similar game, so in 1874 McGill played two games with Harvard, alternating the rules. The series was played out for several years, but Canada increasingly adopted the American rules and so the two versions of football were very similar. In 1898 the Canadian rules were formalized; they differed from the American rules chiefly in the size of the field and in three- rather than four-down play.\n\nGovernor General Earl Grey donated a championship trophy in 1907 to the best amateur team; the Grey Cup went to the professional champions in 1954. Major innovations, such as the forward pass, came in the 1920s and 1930s as American athletes and coaches arrived. In 1936, fearful of the drift towards Americanization, the Canadian Rugby Union placed a limit on the number of foreigners; import quotas remain in effect in the 21st century. After 1945 football flourished at the intercollegiate and professional levels. The Canadian Football League (CFL) distributed franchises across the country, and crowds flocked to the games. The Grey Cup championship game, first telecast in 1952, attracts one of the largest TV audiences, over 4 million. The CFL added five American teams in 1993; this proved a costly blunder, as four teams folded and the fifth moved to Montreal. After surviving the closing of the Ottawa Rough Riders in 1996 and bankruptcies by the Toronto and Hamilton teams in 2003, football has recovered and is in fair health in the 21st century.\n\nSoccer in Canada has grown in popularity in recent decades, especially as a school sport for boys and girls. It has more players than ice hockey. At the professional level, the Toronto FC in 2007 became the first Canadian club in the American Major League Soccer (MLS). In 2009, another MLS franchise was awarded to Vancouver, and began play in the 2011 season. In 2010, an MLS franchise was awarded to Montreal for the 2012 season. Both the Vancouver and Montreal clubs had their roots in lower-tier professional soccer leagues.\n\nLacrosse was invented in the 1850s, when the Anglophone middle class of Montreal adopted the Indian game of \"baggataway\", which was a violent game played by the First Nation teams numbering hundreds of players. The 1860s saw the first powerhouse team, the Montreal Shamrocks; it was Irish, Catholic, and aggressive. During the 1870s and 1880s the Shamrocks had bloody confrontations with the upscale Protestant Montreal and Toronto Lacrosse Clubs. Field lacrosse spread across the country with the tide of Anglophone settlers from Ontario and Quebec. By the early 1890s it was the most popular summer game in Canada. The golden age came in the 1900s, as two professional leagues operated. Escalating violence led to the collapse of the professional leagues in 1914, and the game's base of support shrank to Montreal, Victoria, Vancouver, New Westminster, and small-towns in Ontario. The organizational infrastructure proved too weak—for example, it was never adopted by schools or churches.\n\nIn 1931, promoters introduced \"box lacrosse\" to broaden the fan base to include a summer audience. Played in a smaller space, box lacrosse could be held indoors or in baseball stadiums. The game was especially violent. The poverty of the Great Depression reduced the number of fans who could afford to attend and cities that could find sponsors. The promoters, while failing to make a profit, changed the landscape of Canadian amateur lacrosse, isolating it from the more widely contested field lacrosse played in the United States, Britain, and Australia. In 1987 the National Lacrosse League began; it opened clubs in twelve cities in the United States and Canada.\n\nField lacrosse was revived in the late 1990s when some Ontario universities included it in their women's athletic programs; university women now play the game once associated with Canadian masculinity.\n\nJames Naismith, a Canadian who emigrated to the U.S., invented basketball in Springfield, Massachusetts in the 1890s. It rapidly became popular as an indoor winter sport that needed a minimum of equipment, gaining popularity at upscale high schools and colleges in both the U.S. and Canada. In 1946, early in the era of professional basketball, the owners of the Toronto Maple Leaf hockey team started a franchise in the newly formed Basketball Association of America. Seven thousand spectators watched the first game of the Toronto Huskies, but they lost and attendance fell off as newsmen called it a freak show. The Huskies ended in last place, and folded. It had suffered inconsistent management decisions and the temper tantrums of its coach. The Huskies could not compete with Toronto's successful teams and sporting heroes in hockey, baseball, football, rugby, and wrestling.\n\nThe sport of boxing, both amateur and professional, has been practised in Canada since before Confederation. Professional boxing was illegal in Canada during the London Prize Ring era but fights still took place outside major towns in barns and farmers' fields. The first universally recognized world boxing champion from Canada was George Dixon a black man from Halifax, Nova Scotia. Despite its relatively small population this country has produced many world class pugilists in both the pro and amateur ranks.\n\nCurling, a sport that earned Olympic status in 1998, arrived with Scottish soldiers in the 1750s. the Royal Caledonian Curling Club in Scotland standardized the rules in the 1830s. It involves sliding a 42-pound teapot-shaped granite curling stone by its handle toward a goal painted on the ice, with players using brooms to alter its course. The sweeping removes debris, and warms the surface, creating a hydroplane-like effect. By 1903 Winnipeg had become the world's curling capital of an intensely competitive winter sport played throughout Canada.\n\nCricket never caught on, despite efforts by an imperial-minded elite to promote the game as a way of identifying with the British Empire. Linked to upper class Canadian elites, the game never became popular with the general public. It had to compete with baseball, and was handicapped by the short summer season. During the First World War, Canadian units stationed in Britain played baseball, not cricket.\n\nIn Canada, organized disc sports began in the early 1970s, with promotional efforts from Irwin Toy (Frisbee distributor for Canada), the Canadian Open Frisbee Championships, Toronto (1972–1985), the Vancouver Open Frisbee Championships (1974-1976). Freestyle, double disc court, disc guts, ultimate and disc golf, became disc sports first events. The first Canadian Ultimate Championships (CUC) were held, for the open division, in Ottawa 1987, produced by Marcus Brady and Brian Guthrie. OCUA subsequently hosted the 1993, 1999, 2002 and 2011 Canadian Ultimate Championships.\n\nSports are high priority in Canadian culture, but women were long relegated to second-class status by men. There were regional differences as well, with the eastern provinces emphasizing a more feminine \"girls rule\" game of basketball, while the Western provinces preferred identical rules. Girls’ and women’s sport has traditionally been slowed down by a series of factors: girls and women historically have low levels of interest and participation; there were very few women in leadership positions in academic administration, student affairs or athletics; there were few women coaches; the media strongly emphasized men's sports as a demonstration of masculinity, suggesting that women seriously interested in sports were crossing gender lines; the male sports establishment was actively hostile. Staunch feminists dismissed sports as unworthy of their support. Women's progress was uphill; they first had to counter the widespread notion that women's bodies were so restricted and delicate that vigorous physical activity was dangerous. These notions where first challenged by the \"new woman\" around 1900. These women started with bicycling; they rode into new gender spaces in education, work, and suffrage.\n\nThe 1920s marked a breakthrough for women, including working-class young women in addition to the pioneering middle class sportswomen. The Women's Amateur Federation of Canada (WAAF) was formed in 1926 to make possible new opportunities, particularly in international competition. The WAAF worked to rebut the stereotype that vigorous physical activity and intense competition was \"unwomanly\". One tactic was to set up a system of medical supervision for all women athletes. The WAAF forged an alliance with supportive men who dominated the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada; this allowed women to compete in the Olympics and the British Empire Games.\n\nMany barriers fell in the 1920s: the Edmonton Grads became the world champions of women's basketball; the first Canadian women participated in the Olympics; and women sportswriters such as Phyllis Griffiths were hired to cover their feats on the sports pages.\n\nThe 1930s brought setbacks, as critics recommended non-competitive athletic activities as the recreation most suited to women. During the 1930s, a team of women from the small town of Preston, Ontario, overcame the difficulty of obtaining adequate ice time for practice, and the challenge of raising adequate funds from their small fan base. The Rivulettes dominated women's ice hockey, winning ten provincial championships and four of the six Dominion championships. With money short during the Great Depression; after 1939 the hyper-masculinity of the Second World War blocked women's opportunities. Women's hockey largely disappeared during the Second World War. After the war, the back-to-the-family conservatism Women's sports in the shadows. The feminists of the 1970s rarely helped promote women's breakthroughs in sports. Nevertheless, more and more women engaged in aerobics and organized sport. Figure skater Barbara Ann Scott was the outstanding female athlete of the 1940s, as the 1948 Olympic champion, a two-time World champion (1947–1948), and a four-time Canadian national champion (1944–46, 48) in ladies' singles. She was very heavily covered by the media. However, it focused less on her sportsmanship and athletic achievements and more on her beauty and her \"sweetheart\" image.\n\nChange for women in sport began slowly, but then accelerated after 1980. The Fitness and Amateur Sport Act of 1961 (Bill C-131) and the report of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women in 1970 marked major advances. Perhaps the most critical development came in 1974, when Marion Lay and the federal government’s Fitness and Amateur Sport Branch (FASB) sponsored a National Conference on Women and Sport. it brought together coaches, academic administrators, and athletes to talk over the issues raised by the Royal Commission, and to chart a way forward. Even so, there was no way to monitor the process and implement the recommendations. The 1980s accelerated the movement forward. The Sport Canada’s Women’s Program in 1980; the Female Athlete Conference in 1981; the Women in Sport program in 1981; and the Constitution Act of 1982. In 1981 Abby Hoffman, a former Olympian, was named director general of Sport Canada. Its \"Policy on Women's Sport\" called for equality. The AAU of Canada now became more supportive. Court cases nail down the women's right to participate. In the provinces, human rights commissions addressed dozens of sport-related equity cases for women. Gender barriers in sports became a political topic, as shown by the Minister’s Task Force Report in 1992 and the landmark decision of the Canadian Sport Council to include gender equity quotas in their operating principles. By the 1990s women proved eager to enter formerly all-male sports such as ice hockey, rugby, and wrestling. Their activism and their prowess on the playing field eroded old stereotypes and opened up new social roles for the woman athlete on campus and in her community. New problems emerged for sportswomen trying to achieve equal status with sportsmen: raising money, attracting popular audiences, and winning sponsors.\n\nHarrigan, (2003) reviews the emergence of women's athletics in higher education during 1961-2001. The establishment of the National Fitness and Amateur Sport Advisory Council helped women's intercollegiate sports to gain momentum. simultaneously there was a rise in the proportion of women in the student bodies, which enhanced the visibility of their sports. To overcome institutional inertia, women concentrated on organizing their sports and raising the consciousness of both male and female students. In 1969, the Canadian Women's Intercollegiate Athletic Union was formed to oversee events and sanction national championships; it merged with the Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Union in 1978. Women increasingly became more active after 1980.\n\nCanadians have participated in the Olympics since 1900.\n\nThe 1976 Summer Olympics, officially known as the \"Games of the XXI Olympiad,\" held in Montréal, was the first Olympics in Canada. The entire province of Quebec prepared for the games and associated activities, generating a resurgence of interest in amateur athletics across the province. The spirit of Québec nationalism helped motivate the organizers; however, the city went $1 billion into debt. The Games helped introduce Quebec (and Canada) to the rest of the world. Nadia Comaneci's outstanding performances in gymnastics helped popularize the sport in Canada.\n\nLike Montreal, Calgary, Alberta, which hosted the 1988 Winter Olympics, used the event to reposition itself as world-class city.\n\nThe 2010 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XXI Olympic Winter Games, was held from February 12 to February 28, 2010, in Vancouver, British Columbia, and nearby venues.\n\nCanada hosted the first ever British Empire Games in 1930 in Hamilton, Ontario, as well as the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Alberta, and the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, British Columbia. Halifax, Nova Scotia had been nominated to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games before it withdrew its bid due to unacceptably high cost projections.\n\nCanada hosted three Pan American Games. Winnipeg hosted the 1967 Pan American Games and the 1999 Pan American Games. Toronto hosted the 2015 Pan American Games. The Toronto 2015 Pan American Games was the largest multi-sport event hosted in Canada in terms of athletes competing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

By introducing the latest in Japanese music, fashion, film, art, games, tech-innovations, anime, food, as well as niche subcultures, the festival has become a landing platform for new trends from Japan. The festival is also getting attention by foreign companies and organizations as an effective promotional opportunity and an entry point into US markets. In 2014, the festival was held in Japantown and enjoyed 120,000 in attendance in two days. Since 2015, the festival expanded its area to different locations in the city; Fort Mason Center, Union Square, NEW PEOPLE Cinema and Castro Theatre and successfully re-launched as an indoor event. J-POP SUMMIT in 2018 was canceled due to unforeseen circumstances with the venue. Website http://www.j-pop.com\n\nJ-POP SUMMIT first took place as the opening ceremony of NEW PEOPLE building at Japan Town in San Francisco in 2009. Since then it has become an annual festival to introduce the latest Japanese pop culture including Anime, Manga, Food, Sake, Games, Fashion, Films, and Music. In recent years, Interactive (tech innovations) and Travel have been added to its content diversity to make stronger bonds between IT companies in the two countries and also to revitalize Japanese inbound tourism from the US. The event has provided good opportunities for Japanese companies to expand their business to the U.S. market.\n\n\"POP IS OUR TRADITION\" is the theme of J-POP SUMMIT.\n\nTakako Tokiwa, a Japanese actress and Yoshitaka Amano, a well-known character designer joined the first J-POP SUMMIT in 2009, and since then, prominent guests from a variety of fields including artists, actors, directors, designers, voice actors, programmers have been invited from Japan each year. One of the most popular program is the J-POP LIVE concert event and Japan’s top musical acts such as Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, JAM Project, WORLD ORDER, Silent Siren, Tomomi Itano, May'n, Tokyo Girls’ Style, YANAKIKU and many more have performed on the J-POP SUMMIT main stage.\nJ-POP SUMMIT was held in Japantown as a free outdoor event from 2009 until 2014, and it moved to Fort Mason Center in 2015. When it was in Japantown, the streets were turned into a pedestrian precinct. The number of attendees kept increasing year by year and finally in 2014, it went over the crowd capacity of Japantown. Thus J-POP SUMMIT made its big move to an indoor festival venue to pursue the next level of exhibition and staging, and became a ticketed event in 2015. In 2017, J-POP SUMMIT will be held again at the Fort Mason Center For Arts & Culture (Festival Pavilion, Firehouse and outside Parking area)\n\nThis is the first Japanese Film Festival in Northern California held along with J-POP SUMMIT for about 2 weeks. At this festival, selected Japanese films are screened; and prominent guests are typically invited from Japan to make appearance on stage for US premieres. Originally, “film” was just one of the contents at J-POP SUMMIT, but for the popularity it gained, it became an independent festival in 2013. Tadanobu Asada, a Japanese actor, received the first Japan Film Festival of San Francisco Honorary Award at the opening night event that was held at Castro Theatre in 2015.\n\nSake Summit is a sake tasting event at J-POP SUMMIT. Major sake manufacturers, distributors, and retailers gather at one place to promote Japanese sake culture. The number of sake labels available at this event is increasing every year and it reached 52 different bottles in 2015.\n\nRamen Summit* is where the top ramen restaurants gather to show off their best broth and noodles. People can enjoy ‘slurping’ a variety of ramen, including Tonkotsu (pork bone broth), Miso, Shoyu (soy broth), Tsuke-men and more. The list of ramen shops that have participated are: Orenchi Beyond, Hinodeya Ramen & Bar, Marufuku Ramen, YOROSHIKU, nojo ramen tavern, Naruto Ramen, Ramen TAKA, and Iza Ramen.\n\n"}

He was born in Bacong, Negros Oriental, to Don Policarpio Villegas and Doña Úrsula Soldi. His grandfather was Don Pedro Villegas, a native of Spain, and Dorotea, a daughter of a \"capitán\" of Bacong.\n\nIn 1895, he worked at Botica Antigua located in the corner of Calle del Palacio and Calle Legazpi (Burgos and Legazpi). It was a well-known drugstore frequented by many Cebuanos. With him were Ciriaco Murillo and Eulogio Duque who told the writer Manuel Enríquez de la Calzada that Pantaleón actually used the name \"Eulogio\", instead of Pantaleón. Because there were two Eulogios working in the drugstore, the German owner had to call him instead \"León\". Why he used the name \"Eulogio\" was not known.\n\nVillegas did not stay long at Botica Antigua. He transferred to a bakery in Pahina (Fagina). From there he moved on to a circus owned by Tagalogs on their way to Manila. The circus happened to be owned by a katipunero. It was there that he was recruited into the secret council of the Katipunan.\n\nDuring the rebellion against Spain, Kilat led the revolutionaries in Cebu. Initially intending to begin the rebellion on Easter Sunday, he was forced to change his plans when the Spaniards discovered the planned revolt. Kilat and his men began the rebellion in Cebu on Palm Sunday, April 3, 1898. He was, however, betrayed and murdered on Good Friday, April 8, 1898, in Carcar, Cebu. He was stabbed to death by his own aide-de-camp, Apolinario Alcuitas.\n\nThe town of Bacong in Negros Oriental has honored Villegas with a statue erected in the town plaza in 1926. On July 27, 2008, the 135th anniversary of Villegas' birth, the Philippine National Historical Institute turned over a historical marker in honor of Villegas to local and provincial officials in his hometown.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18963870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18963870", "title": "Literature", "text": "Literature\n\nLiterature, most generically, is any body of written works. More restrictively, literature refers to writing considered to be an art form or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage.\n\nIts Latin root \"literatura\"/\"litteratura\" (derived itself from \"littera\": \"letter\" or \"handwriting\") was used to refer to all written accounts. The concept has changed meaning over time to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature), and non-written verbal art forms. Developments in print technology have allowed an ever-growing distribution and proliferation of written works, culminating in electronic literature.\n\nLiterature is classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction, and whether it is poetry or prose. It can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).\n\nDefinitions of literature have varied over time: it is a \"culturally relative definition\". In Western Europe prior to the 18th century, literature denoted all books and writing. A more restricted sense of the term emerged during the Romantic period, in which it began to demarcate \"imaginative\" writing. Contemporary debates over what constitutes literature can be seen as returning to older, more inclusive notions; Cultural studies, for instance, takes as its subject of analysis both popular and minority genres, in addition to canonical works.\n\nThe value judgment definition of literature considers it to cover exclusively those writings that possess high quality or distinction, forming part of the so-called \"belles-lettres\" ('fine writing') tradition. This sort of definition is that used in the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" Eleventh Edition (1910–11) when it classifies literature as \"the best expression of the best thought reduced to writing.\" Problematic in this view is that there is no objective definition of what constitutes \"literature\": anything can be literature, and anything which is universally regarded as literature has the potential to be excluded, since value judgments can change over time.\n\nThe formalist definition is that \"literature\" foregrounds poetic effects; it is the \"literariness\" or \"poetic\" of literature that distinguishes it from ordinary speech or other kinds of writing (e.g., journalism). Jim Meyer considers this a useful characteristic in explaining the use of the term to mean published material in a particular field (e.g., \"scientific literature\"), as such writing must use language according to particular standards. The problem with the formalist definition is that in order to say that literature deviates from ordinary uses of language, those uses must first be identified; this is difficult because \"ordinary language\" is an unstable category, differing according to social categories and across history.\n\nEtymologically, the term derives from Latin \"literatura/litteratura\" \"learning, a writing, grammar,\" originally \"writing formed with letters,\" from \"litera/littera\" \"letter\". In spite of this, the term has also been applied to spoken or sung texts.\n\nLiterary genre is a mode of categorizing literature. A French term for \"a literary type or class\". However, such classes are subject to change, and have been used in different ways in different periods and traditions.\n\nThe history of literature follows closely the development of civilization. When defined exclusively as written work, Ancient Egyptian literature, along with Sumerian literature, are considered the world's oldest literatures. The primary genres of the literature of Ancient Egypt—didactic texts, hymns and prayers, and tales—were written almost entirely in verse; while use of poetic devices is clearly recognizable, the prosody of the verse is unknown. Most Sumerian literature is apparently poetry, as it is written in left-justified lines, and could contain line-based organization such as the couplet or the stanza,\n\nDifferent historical periods are reflected in literature. National and tribal sagas, accounts of the origin of the world and of customs, and myths which sometimes carry moral or spiritual messages predominate in the pre-urban eras. The epics of Homer, dating from the early to middle Iron age, and the great Indian epics of a slightly later period, have more evidence of deliberate literary authorship, surviving like the older myths through oral tradition for long periods before being written down.\n\nLiterature in all its forms can be seen as written records, whether the literature itself be factual or fictional, it is still quite possible to decipher facts through things like characters' actions and words or the authors' style of writing and the intent behind the words. The plot is for more than just entertainment purposes; within it lies information about economics, psychology, science, religions, politics, cultures, and social depth. Studying and analyzing literature becomes very important in terms of learning about human history. Literature provides insights about about how society has evolved and about the societal norms during each of the different periods all throughout history. For instance, postmodern authors argue that history and fiction both constitute systems of signification by which we make sense of the past. It is asserted that both of these are \"discourses, human constructs, signifying systems, and both derive their major claim to truth from that identity.\" Literature provides views of life, which is crucial in obtaining truth and in understanding human life throughout history and its periods. Specifically, it explores the possibilities of living in terms of certain values under given social and historical circumstances.\n\nLiterature helps us understand references made in more modern literature because authors often reference mythology and other old religious texts to describe ancient civilizations such as the Hellenes and the Egyptians. Not only is there literature written on each of the aforementioned topics themselves, and how they have evolved throughout history (like a book about the history of economics or a book about evolution and science, for example) but one can also learn about these things in fictional works. Authors often include historical moments in their works, like when Lord Byron talks about the Spanish and the French in \"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage: Canto I\" and expresses his opinions through his character Childe Harold. Through literature we are able to continuously uncover new information about history. It is easy to see how all academic fields have roots in literature. Information became easier to pass down from generation to generation once we began to write it down. Eventually everything was written down, from things like home remedies and cures for illness, or how to build shelter to traditions and religious practices. From there people were able to study literature, improve on ideas, further our knowledge, and academic fields such as the medical field or trades could be started. In much the same way as the literature that we study today continue to be updated as we continue to evolve and learn more and more.\n\nAs a more urban culture developed, academies provided a means of transmission for speculative and philosophical literature in early civilizations, resulting in the prevalence of literature in Ancient China, Ancient India, Persia and Ancient Greece and Rome. Many works of earlier periods, even in narrative form, had a covert moral or didactic purpose, such as the Sanskrit \"Panchatantra\" or the \"Metamorphoses\" of Ovid. Drama and satire also developed as urban culture provided a larger public audience, and later readership, for literary production. Lyric poetry (as opposed to epic poetry) was often the speciality of courts and aristocratic circles, particularly in East Asia where songs were collected by the Chinese aristocracy as poems, the most notable being the \"Shijing\" or \"Book of Songs\". Over a long period, the poetry of popular pre-literate balladry and song interpenetrated and eventually influenced poetry in the literary medium.\n\nIn ancient China, early literature was primarily focused on philosophy, historiography, military science, agriculture, and poetry. China, the origin of modern paper making and woodblock printing, produced the world's first print cultures. Much of Chinese literature originates with the Hundred Schools of Thought period that occurred during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (769‒269 BCE). The most important of these include the Classics of Confucianism, of Daoism, of Mohism, of Legalism, as well as works of military science (e.g. Sun Tzu's \"The Art of War\") and Chinese history (e.g. Sima Qian's \"Records of the Grand Historian\"). Ancient Chinese literature had a heavy emphasis on historiography, with often very detailed court records. An exemplary piece of narrative history of ancient China was the \"Zuo Zhuan\", which was compiled no later than 389 BCE, and attributed to the blind 5th-century BCE historian Zuo Qiuming.\n\nIn ancient India, literature originated from stories that were originally orally transmitted. Early genres included drama, fables, sutras and epic poetry. Sanskrit literature begins with the Vedas, dating back to 1500–1000 BCE, and continues with the Sanskrit Epics of Iron Age India. The Vedas are among the oldest sacred texts. The Samhitas (vedic collections) date to roughly 1500–1000 BCE, and the \"circum-Vedic\" texts, as well as the redaction of the Samhitas, date to c. 1000‒500 BCE, resulting in a Vedic period, spanning the mid-2nd to mid 1st millennium BCE, or the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age. The period between approximately the 6th to 1st centuries BCE saw the composition and redaction of the two most influential Indian epics, the \"Mahabharata\" and the \"Ramayana\", with subsequent redaction progressing down to the 4th century AD. Other major literary works are Ramcharitmanas & Krishnacharitmanas.\n\nIn ancient Greece, the epics of Homer, who wrote the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\", and Hesiod, who wrote \"Works and Days\" and \"Theogony\", are some of the earliest, and most influential, of Ancient Greek literature. Classical Greek genres included philosophy, poetry, historiography, comedies and dramas. Plato and Aristotle authored philosophical texts that are the foundation of Western philosophy, Sappho and Pindar were influential lyric poets, and Herodotus and Thucydides were early Greek historians. Although drama was popular in Ancient Greece, of the hundreds of tragedies written and performed during the classical age, only a limited number of plays by three authors still exist: Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. The plays of Aristophanes provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as Old Comedy, the earliest form of Greek Comedy, and are in fact used to define the genre.\nRoman histories and biographies anticipated the extensive mediaeval literature of lives of saints and miraculous chronicles, but the most characteristic form of the Middle Ages was the romance, an adventurous and sometimes magical narrative with strong popular appeal. Controversial, religious, political and instructional literature proliferated during the Renaissance as a result of the invention of printing, while the mediaeval romance developed into a more character-based and psychological form of narrative, the novel, of which early and important examples are the Chinese Monkey and the German Faust books.\n\nIn the Age of Reason philosophical tracts and speculations on history and human nature integrated literature with social and political developments. The inevitable reaction was the explosion of Romanticism in the later 18th century which reclaimed the imaginative and fantastical bias of old romances and folk-literature and asserted the primacy of individual experience and emotion. But as the 19th century went on, European fiction evolved towards realism and naturalism, the meticulous documentation of real life and social trends. Much of the output of naturalism was implicitly polemical, and influenced social and political change, but 20th century fiction and drama moved back towards the subjective, emphasizing unconscious motivations and social and environmental pressures on the individual. Writers such as Proust, Eliot, Joyce, Kafka and Pirandello exemplify the trend of documenting internal rather than external realities.\n\nGenre fiction also showed it could question reality in its 20th century forms, in spite of its fixed formulas, through the enquiries of the skeptical detective and the alternative realities of science fiction. The separation of \"mainstream\" and \"genre\" forms (including journalism) continued to blur during the period up to our own times. William Burroughs, in his early works, and Hunter S. Thompson expanded documentary reporting into strong subjective statements after the second World War, and post-modern critics have disparaged the idea of objective realism in general.\n\nTheorists suggest that literature allows readers to access intimate emotional aspects of a person's character that would not be obvious otherwise. That literature aids the psychological development and understanding of the reader, allowing someone to access emotional states from which they had distanced themselves. D. Mitchell, for example, explains how one author used young adult literature to describes a state of \"wonder\" she had experienced as a child. There are also those who focus on the significance of literature in an individual's psychological development. For example, language learning uses literature because it articulates or contains culture, which is an element considered crucial in learning a language. This is demonstrated in the case of a study that revealed how the presence of cultural values and culturally familiar passages in literary texts played an important impact on the performance of minority students in English reading. Psychologists have also been using literature as a tool or therapeutic vehicle for people, to help them understand challenges and issues. An example is the integration of subliminal messages in literary texts or the rewriting of traditional narratives to help readers address their problems or mold them into contemporary social messages.\n\nHogan also explains that the time and emotion which a person devotes to understanding a character's situation makes literature \"ecological[ly] valid in the study of emotion\". That is literature unites a large community by provoking universal emotions, as well s allowing readers to access cultural aspects that they have not been exposed to, and that produce new emotional experiences. Theorists argue that authors choose literary device according to what psychological emotion they are attempting to describe.\n\nSome psychologists regard literature as a valid research tool, because it allows them to discover new psychological ideas. Psychological theories about literature, such as Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs have become universally recognized.\n\nPsychologist Maslow's \"Third Force Psychology Theory\" helps literary analysts to critically understand how characters reflect the culture and the history to which they belong. It also allows them to understand the author's intention and psychology. The theory suggests that human beings possess within them their true \"self\" and that the fulfillment of this is the reason for living. It also suggests that neurological development hinders actualizing this and a person becomes estranged from his or her true self. Maslow argues that literature explores this struggle for self-fulfillment. Paris in his \"Third Force Psychology and the Study of Literature\" argues that \"D.H. Lawrence's 'pristine unconscious' is a metaphor for the real self\". Literature, it is here suggested, is therefore a tool that allows readers to develop and apply critical reasoning to the nature of emotions.\n\nPoetry is a form of literary art which uses the aesthetic qualities of language (including music, and rhythm) to evoke meanings beyond a prose paraphrase. Poetry has traditionally been distinguished from prose by its being set in verse; prose is cast in sentences, poetry in lines; the syntax of prose is dictated by meaning, whereas that of poetry is held across meter or the visual aspects of the poem. This distinction is complicated by various hybrid forms such as the prose poem and prosimetrum, and more generally by the fact that prose possesses rhythm. Abram Lipsky refers to it as an \"open secret\" that \"prose is not distinguished from poetry by lack of rhythm\".\n\nPrior to the 19th century, poetry was commonly understood to be something set in metrical lines; accordingly, in 1658 a definition of poetry is \"any kind of subject consisting of or Verses\". Possibly as a result of Aristotle's influence (his \"Poetics\"), \"poetry\" before the 19th century was usually less a technical designation for verse than a normative category of fictive or rhetorical art. As a form it may pre-date literacy, with the earliest works being composed within and sustained by an oral tradition; hence it constitutes the earliest example of literature.\n\nProse is a form of language that possesses ordinary syntax and natural speech, rather than a regular metre; in which regard, along with its presentation in sentences rather than lines, it differs from most poetry. However, developments in modern literature, including free verse and prose poetry have tended to blur any differences, and American poet T.S. Eliot suggested that while: \"the distinction between verse and prose is clear, the distinction between poetry and prose is obscure\".\n\nOn the historical development of prose, Richard Graff notes that \"[In the case of Ancient Greece] recent scholarship has emphasized the fact that formal prose was a comparatively late development, an \"invention\" properly associated with the classical period\".\n\nPhilosophical, historical, journalistic, and scientific writings are traditionally ranked as literature. They offer some of the oldest prose writings in existence; novels and prose stories earned the names \"fiction\" to distinguish them from factual writing or nonfiction, which writers historically have crafted in prose.\nA long fictional prose narrative. In English, the term emerged from the Romance languages in the late 15th century, with the meaning of \"news\"; it came to indicate something new, without a distinction between fact or fiction. The romance is a closely related long prose narrative. Walter Scott defined it as \"a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents\", whereas in the novel \"the events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society\". Other European languages do not distinguish between romance and novel: \"a novel is \"le roman\", \"der Roman\", \"il romanzo\"\", indicates the proximity of the forms.\n\nAlthough there are many historical prototypes, so-called \"novels before the novel\", the modern novel form emerges late in cultural history—roughly during the eighteenth century. Initially subject to much criticism, the novel has acquired a dominant position amongst literary forms, both popularly and critically.\n\nIn purely quantitative terms, the novella exists between the novel and short story; the publisher Melville House classifies it as \"too short to be a novel, too long to be a short story\". There is no precise definition in terms of word or page count. Literary prizes and publishing houses often have their own arbitrary limits, which vary according to their particular intentions. Summarizing the variable definitions of the novella, William Giraldi concludes \"[it is a form] whose identity seems destined to be disputed into perpetuity\". It has been suggested that the size restriction of the form produces various stylistic results, both some that are shared with the novel or short story, and others unique to the form.\n\nA dilemma in defining the \"short story\" as a literary form is how to, or whether one should, distinguish it from any short narrative; hence it also has a contested origin, variably suggested as the earliest short narratives (e.g. the Bible), early short story writers (e.g. Edgar Allan Poe), or the clearly modern short story writers (e.g. Anton Chekhov). Apart from its distinct size, various theorists have suggested that the short story has a characteristic subject matter or structure; these discussions often position the form in some relation to the novel.\n\nAn essay consists of a discussion of a topic from an author's personal point of view, exemplified by works by Michel de Montaigne or by Charles Lamb. Genres related to the essay may include the memoir and the epistle.\n\nAs advances and specialization have made new scientific research inaccessible to most audiences, the \"literary\" nature of science writing has become less pronounced over the last two centuries. Now, science appears mostly in journals. Scientific works of Aristotle, Copernicus, and Newton still exhibit great value, but since the science in them has largely become outdated, they no longer serve for scientific instruction. Yet, they remain too technical to sit well in most programs of literary study. Outside of \"history of science\" programs, students rarely read such works.\n\nPhilosophy has become an increasingly academic discipline. More of its practitioners lament this situation than occurs with the sciences; nonetheless most new philosophical work appears in academic journals. Major philosophers through history—Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, Augustine, Descartes, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche—have become as canonical as any writers. Some recent philosophy works are argued to merit the title \"literature\", but much of it does not, and some areas, such as logic, have become extremely technical to a degree similar to that of mathematics.\nA significant portion of historical writing ranks as literature, particularly the genre known as creative nonfiction, as can a great deal of journalism, such as literary journalism. However, these areas have become extremely large, and often have a primarily utilitarian purpose: to record data or convey immediate information. As a result, the writing in these fields often lacks a literary quality, although it often(and in its better moments)has that quality. Major \"literary\" historians include Herodotus, Thucydides and Procopius, all of whom count as canonical literary figures.\nLaw offers more ambiguity. Some writings of Plato and Aristotle, the law tables of Hammurabi of Babylon, or even the early parts of the Bible could be seen as legal literature. Roman civil law as codified in the \"Corpus Juris Civilis\" during the reign of Justinian I of the Byzantine Empire has a reputation as significant literature. The founding documents of many countries, including Constitutions and Law Codes, can count as literature.\n\nDrama is literature intended for performance. The form is often combined with music and dance, as in opera and musical theater. A play is a subset of this form, referring to the written dramatic work of a playwright that is intended for performance in a theater; it comprises chiefly dialogue between characters, and usually aims at dramatic or theatrical performance rather than at reading. A closet drama, by contrast, refers to a play written to be read rather than to be performed; hence, it is intended that the meaning of such a work can be realized fully on the page. Nearly all drama took verse form until comparatively recently.\n\nGreek drama exemplifies the earliest form of drama of which we have substantial knowledge. Tragedy, as a dramatic genre, developed as a performance associated with religious and civic festivals, typically enacting or developing upon well-known historical or mythological themes. Tragedies generally presented very serious themes. With the advent of newer technologies, scripts written for non-stage media have been added to this form. War of the Worlds (radio) in 1938 saw the advent of literature written for radio broadcast, and many works of Drama have been adapted for film or television. Conversely, television, film, and radio literature have been adapted to printed or electronic media.\n\n\nLiterary technique and literary device are used by authors to produce specific effects.\n\nLiterary techniques encompass a wide range of approaches: examples for fiction are, whether a work is narrated in first-person, or from another perspective; whether a traditional linear narrative or a nonlinear narrative is used; the literary genre that is chosen.\n\nLiterary devices involves specific elements within the work that make it effective. Examples include metaphor, simile, ellipsis, narrative motifs, and allegory. Even simple word play functions as a literary device. In fiction stream-of-consciousness narrative is a literary device.\n\nLiterary works have been protected by copyright law from unauthorized reproduction since at least 1710. Literary works are defined by copyright law to mean \"any work, other than a dramatic or musical work, which is written, spoken or sung, and accordingly includes (a) a table or compilation (other than a database), (b) a computer program, (c) preparatory design material for a computer program, and (d) a database.\"\n\nLiterary works are not limited to works of literature, but include all works expressed in print or writing (other than dramatic or musical works).\n\nThere are numerous awards recognizing achievement and contribution in literature. Given the diversity of the field, awards are typically limited in scope, usually on: form, genre, language, nationality and output (e.g. for first-time writers or debut novels).\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature was one of the six Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895, and is awarded to an author on the basis of their body of work, rather than to, or for, a particular work itself. Other literary prizes for which all nationalities are eligible include: the Neustadt International Prize for Literature, the Man Booker International Prize and the Franz Kafka Prize.\n\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\nMajor forms\n\nHistory\n\n"}

These themes compete to better adapt to a proper fitness function, generally grounded on formal and aesthetic criteria. The Melomics system encodes each theme in a genome, and the entire population of music pieces undergoes evo-devo dynamics (i.e., pieces read-out mimicking a complex embryological development process). The system is fully autonomous: once programmed, it composes music without human intervention.\n\nThis technology has been transferred to industry as an academic spin-off, Melomics Media, which has provided and reprogrammed a new computer cluster that created a huge collection of popular music. The results of this evolutionary computation are being stored in Melomics' site, which nowadays constitutes a vast repository of music content. A differentiating feature is that pieces are available in three types of formats: playable (MP3), editable (MIDI and MusicXML) and readable (score in PDF).\n\nThe Melomics computational system includes two computer clusters: Melomics109 and Iamus, dedicated to popular and artistic music, respectively.\n\nMelomics109 is cluster programmed and integrated in the Melomics system. Its first product is a vast repository of popular music compositions (roughly 1 billion), covering all essential styles. In addition to MP3, all songs are available in editable formats (MIDI); and music is licensed under CC0, meaning that it is freely downloadable.\n\n0music is the first album published by Melomics109, which is available in MP3 and MIDI formats, under CC0 license.\n\nIt has been argued that, by making such amount of editable, original and royalty-free music accessible to people, Melomics may accelerate the process of commoditization of music, and change the way music is composed and consumed in the future.\n\nIn the first stages of the development of the Melomics system, Iamus composed \"Opus one\" (on October 15, 2010), arguably the first fragment of professional contemporary classical music ever composed by a computer in its own style, rather than attempting to emulate the style of existing composers. The first full composition (also in contemporary classic style), \"Hello World!\", premiered exactly one year after the creation of \"Opus one\", on October 15, 2011. Four later works premiered on July 2, 2012, and were broadcast live from the School of Computer Science at Universidad de Málaga as part of the events included in the Alan Turing year. The compositions performed at this event were later recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra, creating Iamus' eponymous first album, which New Scientist reported as the \"first complete album to be composed solely by a computer and recorded by human musicians.\"\n\nCommenting on the quality and authenticity of the music, Stephen Smoliar, critic of classical music at \"The San Francisco Examiner\", commented \"What is primary is the act of making the music itself engaged by the performers and how the listener responds to what those performers do... what is most interesting about the documents generated by Iamus is their capacity to challenge the creative talents of performing musicians\".\n\nMelomics' empathic music has been tested in a number of therapeutic clinical trials, evidencing positive effects in reducing fear of heights, acute stress and pain perception. One of the studies resulted in a reduction of almost two thirds of pain perception in children's prick test, as compared to the standard procedure. Some of these experiments made use of mobile free apps to adapt music to daily activity, like jogging, or commuting, but also for therapeutic use, like lessen stress before an exam, for chronic pain, insomnia, and to help children to initiate sleep.\n\nThe way Melomics can adapt music in real-time to the physiological evolution of the listener, and to music branding has also been reported.\n\n"}

His circus toured continuously for over 40 years, from 1891 to 1935. Ernest Haag Circus toured using a boat, carts, trains, horse pulled wagons and trucks. At the time it was one of the largest traveling Circus in the United States. Many of Haag performers went on to have very successful careers after working in Haag Circus. Harry James (1916–1983) grew up in the Mighty Haag Circus as his father, Everett Robert James, was the bandleader in Mighty Haag Circus. Harry James' mother, Myrtle Maybelle (Stewart), was an acrobat and horseback rider in the Circus. Maybelle and Everett liked Ernest Haag so much they gave their son his middle name, Harry Haag James. Harry James was born in Albany, Georgia while the Haag Circus was performing there. The James family departed the Circus in 1931 when Harry was 15. Laurence Brasfield of Uncle Cyp and Aunt Sap Brasfield start in the Haag Circus at age 14. Cornet player Don Essig played in Haag Circus. Starting as Haag performers Rube Walters and Heinie Emgard became a vaudeville act. Fisher's Performing Elephants continued tours after the Haag Circus ended. Ruby Haag Brown performed for 50 years in the Haag Circus, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, the Circus Hall of Fame and Shrine Circus.\n\nThe story goes that Ernest Haag ran away from home (Plymouth, Indiana) at age 12 to join a Circus. From Indiana he traveled to Philadelphia and New York shining shoes and selling newspapers. Then got a job as musician and an orchestra leader. Ernest played alto in the short lived \"Robinson Two-Car Show\". He started a juice business. From Philadelphia he traveled south and turned his juice business into a minstrel show, that failed. He did a side show at the local fair grounds after purchasing a small tent from an old side-show man, Squire Bowman. At the age of 24, Ernest Haag started his circus show by purchasing a Flat-bottomed boat on the Red River near Shreveport, Louisiana in 1890. He hired local performers to put his show together and called it \"The Big Show\". In 1895 he renamed the show the Mighty Haag Shows. Ed Conklin a local juggler was one of first performers. The show moved down the Catawba River to Bayou Teche. From there down the Atchafalaya river near Morgan City, Louisiana. In Morgan City Haag moved his show to carts and later and wagons as he toured by land. Haag added more carts and wagon to the show as he toured Louisiana and then Kansas.\n\nThe Mighty Haag Shows toured Mississippi, Tennessee and Kentucky. For 10 years The Mighty Haag Shows toured through the Southern United States. In 1909 the Circus had out grown the horse and mule pulled wagons. Haag moved his Circus to 14 railroad cars calling show Mighty Haag Railroad Shows. Carved wagons, cages for animals, Pawnee Bill calliope wagon and chariots where place in rail cars. The Mighty Haag Railroad Shows toured from 1910 to 1912 in Eastern Canada including: Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, including Charlottetown. The Mighty Haag Circus toured many US states as far west as Montana. Mighty Haag Railroad Circus show had highly trained animal with elephants, bears, ponies, camels, lions, tiger and blue-faced monkeys, along with hyena, ocelot and badger. Tuckapo ponies act was put on by Capt. J. C. Farley. In 1915 Circus entrance fee was 35 cents. At its peak in 1918, the show had 100 workers, 3-Ring Circus in a 180 by 80 tent and 45 vehicles of all types. Circus was also known for the one-legged clown, Roy Fortune, a highwire walker and aerialist; also the sword swallower Marguerite Davis. In 1915 Ernest Haag sold all his railroad cars to Great Wortham Shows carnival and move back to wagons, renaming the show to the Mighty Haag Circus. The wagons toured locally in Louisiana and Texas. In the early 1930 with good roads and trucks now available, Haag moved his Circus and tents to trucks. The elephants were used to help with stuck trucks. Mighty Haag Circus rested and wintered first in Lecompte, Louisiana and then later back in Shreveport. With the success of the Circus Haag had a home made in Shreveport. In 1920 the Circus moved it wintered headquarter to Marianna, Florida. Ruby Haag Brown, daughter of the late Charles William Fisher and Ruth Eleanor Gregory was a performer in the show, she is known for Alice the elephant picking her up by her mouth and carrying her around by her legs. Ruby also did aerial acts in the show. She was married to Harry Eugene Haag Senior for 29 years.\n\nFor the summer of 1936 Harry Haag, Ruby Haag and Fisher family, with horses and trained dogs opened the Bud Hawkins Circus.\n\nIn 1935 with the death of Ernest Haag on 1 Feb. 1935 the operation of the Circus was given to family members. The name was changed to the Haag Brothers Circus in January 1937. The brothers were in fact cousins, Roy Haag and Henry Haag. Henry was Ernest son and Roy was Ernest's nephew. The Circus' last show was in 1939 in Climax, Georgia. Roy Haag (23 Nov. 1891-6 Jan. 1947) was Ernest nephew and worked in the Circus. After Circus closed, Harry Haag, Silverlake and Fisher fmailies took ALICE the Elephant and few other acts and ran an independent act-show from for one year, called United Amusement Company.\n\nErnest Haag was married to Alice N. Hubbard Haag (1879- 1951). They had a son Harry Eugene on tour in Oklahoma and later a daughter Helen. Ernest purshaed real estate in Louisiana, Florida and Oklahoma. Ernest also was the director of the Commercial National Bank of Shreveport. Ernest Haag father was Joseph N. Haag (July 8, 1840 - 1904), born in Bavaria (Bayern), Germany and lived in Plymouth, Indiana. Ernest Haag and Joseph Haag are buried in Plymouth, Indiana. Ernest Haag mother was Elizabeth Schoner Haag (April 1840 – 1906), she was born in Germany.\n\n\n"}

It was a Sunday-only spin-off of Breathed's strip \"Bloom County\", featuring many of the same characters.\n\nOn September 3, 1989, a month after retiring \"Bloom County\", Breathed began his second syndicated strip with a minor character from the previous strip. Ronald-Ann Smith, a little girl from the \"wrong side of the tracks\" in Bloom County, entered a magic doorway in a grimy alley that looked down into a cheery world of \"cotton-candy trees\" known as the Outland (the ground of her world did not align with that of Outland, so the door originally appears to be hovering in the sky above it).\n\nIn its earliest form, \"Outland\" had been intended to be an experimental strip for Breathed, featuring a channel for creativity in the forms of new characters (such as Mortimer Mouse, based on the rejected name for Disney's Mickey Mouse) and bizarre backgrounds (many of which initially resembled those seen in \"Krazy Kat\"). However, Opus the Penguin returned in the strip's third installment, and Bill the Cat appeared months after that. Before long, the premise of another world beyond a magic door had been lost completely.\n\nBreathed wrote that the strip became \"Bloom County without the continuing narrative that a daily appearance allows\" in the first Outland book collection. Other characters from \"Bloom County\", such as Milquetoast the Cockroach, Steve Dallas, Oliver Wendell Jones, and Michael Binkley, became major players in the strip. Some characters, such as Cutter John, made an occasional guest appearance. A few prominent members of \"Bloom County\", such as Milo Bloom, did not make an active appearance at all (Milo did appear in the second-to-last installment of \"Outland\", as a background extra on a bus).\n\nIn 1991, Breathed wrote a children's Christmas book entitled \"A Wish for Wings That Work\". The story revolved around Opus and included several \"Outland\" characters (although the Outland itself was not explicitly referenced in the story). It was made into an animated television movie that same year.\n\nFinally, on March 26, 1995, Breathed decided to end the strip and retire from cartooning. At the strip's end, Steve Dallas came out as gay, and eloped to California with Mark Slackmeyer from the comic strip \"Doonesbury\". Opus returned to Antarctica to live with his mother, whom he had finally located (some story arcs of the original comic \"Bloom County\" focused on his quest to find her).\n\nEight years later, Breathed abandoned retirement and picked up where \"Outland\" had left off. The result was the Sunday-only reunion strip, \"Opus\".\n\n\n\nMany \"Outland\" strips have never been reprinted in color, though all appeared in black & white in \"Comics Revue\" magazine.\n\n\"Outland\" strips also appeared in the 2004 book \"Opus: 25 Years of His Sunday Best\", which reprinted strips from \"Bloom County\" and the new \"Opus\" strip as well.\n\n"}

It was used again in Bernard Krigstein's \"From Eternity Back to Here!\" in \"Mad\" 12 (June 1954) on an airplane advertising banner. With the same type font, it reappeared in Jack Davis's \"Book! Movie!\" in \"Mad\" 13 (July 1954), pasted into a panel as the title of an abstract painting seen in the background. In the same issue the word appears as POTS-REBIE, emblazoned on a cauldron in which Robinson Crusoe is roasting a frankfurter. This piece reappeared in one of the earliest \"Mad\" paperbacks, \"Bedside Mad\" It was illustrated as a rebus in \"Puzzle Pages!\" in \"Mad\" 19 (January 1955). These stories, like others in \"Mad\" comics, were written by Harvey Kurtzman. Frequent repetition gave it the status of a catch phrase or in-joke among the readership which continues to the present day. In the first \"Mad Style Guide\", edited by Bhob Stewart in 1994, the word was made available for display on T-shirts and other licensed \"Mad\" products. It also sees occasional use as a metasyntactic variable by hackers.\nA typical appearance of the word is exemplified by the \"Mad\" version of Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\" (from \"Mad\" 43, December 1958), which begins:\n\nIn issue 33, \"Mad\" published a partial table of the \"Potrzebie System of Weights and Measures\", developed by 19-year-old Donald E. Knuth, later a famed computer scientist. According to Knuth, the basis of this new revolutionary system is the potrzebie, which equals the thickness of \"Mad\" issue 26, or 2.2633484517438173216473 mm, although a digit was mistakenly dropped and the thickness appeared as 2.263348517438173216473 mm in the MAD article. A standardization in terms of the wavelength of the red line of the emission spectrum of cadmium is also given, which if the 1927 definition of the Ångstrom is taken for the value of that wavelength, would equal 2.263347539605392 mm.\n\nVolume was measured in ngogn (equal to 1000 cubic potrzebies), mass in blintz (equal to the mass of 1 ngogn of halavah, which is \"a form of pie [with] a specific gravity of 3.1416 and a specific heat of .31416\"), and time in seven named units (decimal powers of the average earth rotation, equal to 1 \"clarke\"). The system also features such units as \"whatmeworry\", \"cowznofski\", \"vreeble\", \"hoo\" and \"hah\".\n\nAccording to the \"Date\" system in Knuth's article, which substitutes a 10-clarke \"mingo\" for a month and a 100-clarke \"cowznofski\", for a year, the date of October 29, 2007, was originally rendered as \"Cal 7, 201 C.M.\" (for Cowznofsko Madi, or \"in the Cowznofski of our MAD\"). The dates are calculated from October 1, 1952, the date MAD was first published. Dates before this point are referred to, tongue-in-cheek, as \"B.M.\" (\"Before MAD.\") Later Knuth preferred 0-origin indexing, so October 29, 2007 is now rendered as \"Cal 6, 201 C.M.\". The ten \"Mingoes\" are: Tales (Tal.) Calculated (Cal.) To (To) Drive (Dri.) You (You) Humor (Hum.) In (In) A (A) Jugular (Jug.) Vein (Vei.)\n\nGoogle's calculator can perform conversions from potrzebie system to other units.\n\nThe word made an impression on many readers, for example jazz guitarist Jimmy Raney, who recorded the tune \"Potrezebie\" on the album \"The Dual Role of Bob Brookmeyer\" (1954; reissued on compact disc in 1992). In the late 1960s, \"Potrzebie\" was a \"Jeopardy\" category.\n\n\"Potrzebie\" became the default password for the #1 (which is \"God\" or the root account) user account in several MUSHes and MUCKs (e.g., PennMUSH, TinyMUCK, Fuzzball MUCK, TinyMUSH, and TinyMUX).\n\nOther odd words favored by Kurtzman and popularized by him through their use as running gags in \"Mad\" were \"veeblefetzer\", \"axolotl\", \"hoohah\", \"osszefogva\", \"bitsko\", \"furshlugginer\", \"Moxie\", \"ganef\" and \"halavah\". Many of these are of Yiddish or Jewish origin.\n\nIn the Bill Griffith comic strip \"Zippy\" for February 27, 2007, Zippy and Zerbina mention both \"potrzebie\" and \"axolotl\" in a panel captioned, \"They like to use out-of-date words and catchphrases.\" The word was also featured as the title of the May 30, 2018 strip and again just over three months later on September 8.\n\nIn \"Agatha H. and the Clockwork Princess,\" the second of the novelizations of Phil and Kaja Foglio's \"Girl Genius\" webcomic, the character Herr Doktor Potrezbie Spün is one of the many footnoted references.\n\n"}

She began her career as an assistant editor at \"Spin Magazine\", and soon helped champion rock bands like My Chemical Romance and The Killers, which led to her starting her own record label, Stolen Transmission. In 2006, \"New York\" magazine named Lewitinn as one of the most \"influential people in music\", citing that \"Like it or not, she has more power than any print music critic.\".\n\nBorn in New York City to Egyptian-Jewish parents, Lewitinn was raised and educated in Tenafly, New Jersey. She began her career as a teenager writing for the AOL-based ABC Kidz site before interning at Spin Magazine. It was at that time she received the moniker of \"Ultragrrrl\", by which she continues to be known. After briefly working at the defunct Kurt Andersen-run Inside.com in 1999, Lewitinn was hired as an assistant to Michael Hirschorn at VH1. Lewitinn graduated with a degree in Advertising and Marketing from Fashion Institute of Technology in 2001.\n\nIn 2002, she was the first manager for both rock bands stellastarr* and My Chemical Romance, both prior to their first major record deals. Her blog, Ultragrrrl.com (launched in July 2003), further established her as a taste-maker in the New York indie rock scene, as did her early championing of the rock band The Killers before they were signed to Island Def Jam. She returned to Spin several months later, this time as an assistant editor with her own column. In 2005, Lewitinn quit Spin to start her own record label, Stolen Transmission in partnership with Island Def Jam and Rob Stevenson, the Island Def Jam A&R executive responsible for signing The Killers as well as Fall Out Boy, Thrice, and The Bravery. Bands which were signed or had releases by Stolen Transmission include The Oohlas, The Horrors, PlayRadioPlay!, Monty Are I, Permanent ME, Schoolyard Heroes, The Photo Atlas, Innerpartysystem, and Bright Light Fever. Though Stolen Transmission severed its official relationship with Island Def Jam in December 2007, Lewitinn edited IDJ's parent company Universal Music Group's short-lived website, Dance Hall.\n\nIn January 2008, Lewitinn, along with Stevenson, launched For The Win! Media, an Internet marketing company focused on promoting bands and Web sites. Clients have included Pet Shop Boys, Lady Sovereign, The Verve and The Futureheads as well as the film \"Anvil! The Story of Anvil\". However, in August 2008, Stevenson was named president of EMI's Virgin US label. In November 2008, Lewitinn became a featured presenter and on-air talent for FUSE's show \"Fuse On Tour\" where she presents \"The Ultragrrrl Report\". Lewitinn left for The Win! Media in 2009 and is now a member of the Digital Strategy Team at the public relations firm Edelman. Sarah provided a lot of smart counsel at Edelman but she was often criticized for throwing around the F bomb and not being \"office trained\"\n\nLewitinn is also a DJ and, along with New York-based publicist Karen Ruttner, threw a weekly party also called \"Stolen Transmission\" at various locations on Manhattan's Lower East Side, including Pete Wentz's bar, Angels & Kings. The Stolen Transmission party won two Paper Magazine Nightlife Awards for People's Choice Best Party in 2005 and 2006 and Lewitinn herself won People's Choice for Best Deejay those two years as well. In October 2009, Lewitinn went on tour as the backing DJ for Grammy-nominated R&B singer-songwriter Melanie Fiona. Lewitinn also joined the 9th annual Independent Music Awards judging panel to assist independent musicians' careers.\n\nLewitinn has published two books, both released by Simon Spotlight, a division of Simon & Schuster. Her first was \"The Pocket DJ\", a guide to \"building the best music library\", divided into \"Essential Genres\" the best music of certain eras and genres, \"Essential Artists\" a list of musicians who are important to pop culture or have \"a profound influence on music\" including such diverse artists as Eminem, The Beatles, Nirvana, Madonna, Björk and Queen, \"Celebrity Playlists\", recommended music from DJs, musicians and others and \"Other Playlists\", a list of various situations with recommended songs for them, ranging from pool parties to playlists for going back to school. Her second book, \"Pocket Karaoke\" featured karaoke song lists, including those contributed by Simon LeBon of Duran Duran and Mikey Way of My Chemical Romance.\n\nThe character Natalie \"Motorrrju\" Levine from Marc Spitz's 2006 novel \"Too Much, Too Late\", was based on Sarah \"Ultragrrrl\" Lewitinn.\n\n"}
{"id": "20344376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20344376", "title": "Social presence theory", "text": "Social presence theory\n\nSocial Presence Theory was developed by John Short with the help of Ederyn Williams, and Bruce Christie. The theory came together by the appearance of difference in the physical proximity that was produced by different mediums. The main thesis and major points of the theory were first described in 1956 in The Naked Sun, a novel by Isaac Asimov. Social Presence Theory is defined by Short, Williams & Christie as the ability of a communications medium to transmit social cues. In a study conducted by Baozhou, Weiguo and Zhou Social Presence builds trust between individuals, which is crucial to our interactions in person or online.\n\nLombard & Ditton (1997) interpreted Social Presence Theory as a multi-dimensional and flexible concept that identifies mediums depending on how intimate, personal, warm, and sensible they are when helping form personal connections between individuals.Social Presence serves as a measure for psychological processes such as social orientation, identifying motivations, and group think. Social Presence Theory inspires the feeling of being together, even through a screen. The Theory explains primitive responses to social cues. \n\nSocial Presence Theory is defined by the different physical proximities produced by different mediums, the two more popular being face-to-face communication and online interaction. Social Presence is measured by the ability to project physical and emotional presence, and experience it from others in interactions. Computer-mediated communication has risen in the recent years, which has forced Social Presence Theory to be adapted to the new medium, and how we portray our persona in order to make connections with others on the internet. Effective communication is measured by the parties' interpersonal involvement, while considering constraints of the communication medium used.\n\nThe definition of Social Presence remains inconsistent as scholars attempt to pinpoint what the phenomenon encompasses, and how it can be adapted as new mediums of interpersonal communication arise. Social Presence in recent years has been defined as the feeling of community a learner experiences in an online environment. We have developed multiple non-verbal intimacy behaviors in the online community that develop our personal relationships with people when we communicate in a medium where there is not real life contact. \n\nOther research has defined Social Presence as the awareness of others in an interaction combined with an appreciation of the interpersonal aspects of that interaction. Gunawardena (1995) argued that Social Presence varied in perception and was a subjective issue based upon objective qualities. We are social beings, and we crave socialization and Social Presence explains how we form relationships and how beneficial and necessary they are to our lives. \n\nThe definitions and interpretations of Social Presence given by multiple sources after the original work conducted by Short, Williams and Christie have offered a clearer view that Social Presence is more of a combination of factors that present themselves in a way so as to develop greater intimacy within a group that has a positive effect on the individual's affective filters. Several researchers have suggested that intimacy and immediacy are contributing factors to Social Presence with intimacy defined as a measure of communication involving eye contact, proximity and body language and immediacy defined as the psychological distance between two parties that is conveyed through verbal and nonverbal cues in speech. \n\nCommunicators face different challenges in order to tap into the necessities of the people they are trying to communicate with in a world that revolves around multicommunication, communicators must adapt and evolve to reach audiences. Social Presence was originally studied in connection with face-to-face (F2F), audio, and interactive television encounters. The emergence of computer-mediated communication (CMC) in education and training provided an entirely new series of variables and characteristics to already existing Social Presence models. In e-learning context, it was redefined as learners' ability to portray themselves as \"real\" members of a community in social and emotional ways. \n\nTu (2000,2001) argued that within distance learning, Social Presence rests upon three dimensions, social context, online communication, and interactivity. Social contexts contribute to a predictable degree of perceived Social Presence . Social contexts involve task orientation and privacy, topics, social relationships, and social process. A closely related theory, electronic propinquity, also examines this quality of human connection through technology.\n\nSocial Presence Theory, per Short, Williams and Christie in 1976, is primarily composed of Intimacy and Immediacy. Non-verbal communication and Efficiency are two sub-terms that are relevant to the theory. \n\nIntimacy is defined as the feeling of closeness and belonging that two people may feel with each other. Argyle and Dean (1965) defined the interpretation of intimacy in an interaction as something that is influenced by a number of factors, such as physical distance, eye contact, smiling, body language, and potential conversation topics. We create intimacy by interpreting non-verbal cues, whether it is in person or online. \n\nImmediacy is defined as giving urgency or importance to an exchange. The interpretation of immediacy was brought up by Wiener and Mehrabian in 1968 into Social Presence Theory, and it was paraphrased and further explained by Cobb as a measure of the psychological distance between the communicator and the recipient of that exchange. The urgency we indicate when communicating with others gives them a sense of closeness and importance to their relationship. \n\nIn an exchange participants share a multitude of additions to the verbal communication, like eye contact, posture, physical distance and facial expressions. When engaging in computer - mediated interactions the non-verbal cues can be more ambiguous such as, emoticons, urgency of response, and personal topics within the conversation. \n\nIn Social Presence Theory, one medium may be more reliable to get the message across. The communicator is the judge when it comes to picking a medium, and getting across their message to the desired audience in the most efficient way possible. There is never a clear answer when it comes to saying what is the most efficient way. \n\nSocial Presence theory classifies different communication media along a one-dimensional continuum of \"Social Presence\" , where the degree of Social Presence is equated to the degree of \"awareness\" of the other person in a communication interaction. \n\nSocial Presence Theory in communication is effective if the communication medium has the appropriate Social Presence required for the level of interpersonal involvement required in an engagement, which is one of the challenges communicators have at the time of engaging the correct audiences. \n\nOn a continuum of Social Presence , the face-to-face medium is considered to have the most Social Presence , and written, text-based communication the least. Inter-party and interpersonal exchanges are two aspects of interactions identified by Short, Williams, & Christie (1976). It is assumed in Social Presence theory that in any interaction involving two parties, both parties are concerned with acting out certain roles and developing or maintaining some sort of personal relationship.\n\nThe most basic of interactions are done face-to-face, and the participants exchange, in addition to verbal communication, a set of non-verbal cues just as facial expression, direction of gaze, posture, dress, and body language. In the work about Kinesics done by Birdwhistell in 1970 there were two types of functions identified for non-verbal cues. One of the functions is directly related to the message that is being sent between one individual to another, and the is concerned withe the communication process and the integrational aspects. \n\nThe integrational activity includes the behavior that keeps the interaction in process, and the comprehensibility that goes in the exchange between individuals. Argyle in 1969, identified six functions of six non-verbal cues and what role they play in the communications process. There are three that are integrational and three that are informational. \n\nThe integrational functions are: \n\n\nThe informational functions are: \n\n\nAs computer-mediated communication has evolved a more relational view of Social Presence has emerged. Social Presence has come to be viewed as the way individuals represent themselves in their online environment. It's a personal stamp that indicates that the individual is available and willing to engage and connect with other persons in their online community. Social Presence is demonstrated by the way messages are posted and how those messages are interpreted by others. Social Presence defines how participants relate to one another which in turn affects their ability to communicate effectively.\n\nSocial Presence theory provides a foundation for communication systems designers and serves as a main principle in computer-mediated communication studies. Aragon (2003), Gorham & Cristophel (1990), and Tu & McIsaac (2002) place high importance on using engagement tactics in online classrooms geared towards increasing Social Presence and reducing distance (Kendall & Kendall, 2017). These tactics include ways to humanize the interactions between instructor and students. Asynchronous (pre-produced content accessed individually by students on the web) and synchronous (real-time, simultaneous live connections of students together) components combined can enliven online interactions. Depending on the technology used, synchronous sessions can provide both audio and video connection, allowing an interchange involving both sight and sound, and all the rich nonverbal communication inherent in tone of voice and facial expression.\n\nAccepted as a major design principle, designers have used Social Presence Theory to gain insight into user behavior when developing web-based applications and social computing technologies. They use social communication tools to enhance the student experience and to overcome the challenges of forming interpersonal relationships in a virtual space. Designers seek to provide a high-quality experience for the users by encouraging meaningful interactions between users and the development of interpersonal relationships. In a study conducted by Jahng and Littau in 2016 the importance we give to computer mediated communications in order to trust the people we communicate with is reinforced. Their study describes how important it is for Journalists to be present and active on Social media in order to create a bond of trust with their audiences. Individuals do not feel comfortable when professionals are not as active on social platforms as it has been established to be the norm. \n\nResearch related to the importance of Social Presence in the success of students points to the need to design social communication tools to enhance users’ experience of one another. Social Presence affects different aspects of a learner’s experience such as, their \"success (Russo & Benson, 2005; Zhan & Mei, 2013), satisfaction (Gunawardena & Zittle, 1997; Richardson & Swan, 2003; So & Brush, 2008; Zhan & Mei, 2013), and performance (Lomicka & Lord, 2007; Richardson & Swan, 2003).\" A positive Social Presence enables students to engage on another with ease while a negative Social Presence has been shown to increase disappointment in users which decreases cognition and familiarity with the material. Without Social Presence learning interaction suffers, which has negative effects on learning performance. \nSocial Presence is critical in improving instructional effectiveness in any setting especially in distance education. Tu (2000,2001) argued that within distance learning, Social Presence rests on three dimensions: social context, online communication, and interactivity. Social contexts contribute to a predictable degree of perceived Social Presence . Social contexts involve task orientation, privacy, topics, social relationships, and social process. As an example, when a conversation is task-based and public without a sense of community being in place, the perception of Social Presence is low and affective filter (a communication blockage brought about by negative emotional feelings) is high. In addition, Social Presence research sheds light on the relationship between a shared learning space and participants' satisfaction and encourages to build up a shared learning space for a better e-learning environment. \n\nMore recently Social Presence has been used as a concept in exploring interpersonal communication suggesting a direct association between Social Presence with feelings of closeness. Recent research highlights the importance of Social Presence in educational settings when delivering feedback on marked assessments.\n\nThere hasn't been a general agreement on how to measure Social Presence Theory, but there are three major instruments that can be used to have a better understanding of the Theory. \n\n\nSteinfield (1986) found that task complexity, interdependence, uncertainty, and the perceived need to communicate over distances were positively associated with increasing online communication. Walther (1992) argued that social relationships could stimulate changes in discourse as well. In examining text-based CMC (e-mails) of conference participants, Walther discovered participants formed impressions of other participants from their communications. These impressions developed into visual interpretations of the other, and a sense of intimacy and identification between participants, which led to greater perceptions of Social Presence .\n\nGunawardena (1991) argued that a purely text-based communication system (e-mail, discussion boards and chat) rests upon the assumption that people using such a system have already developed a level of comfort with the technology that allow the person to effectively use it. Gunawardena argued further that text-based communications should account for not all users having a level of comfort in its use. Courses or conferences that will rely heavily on such a system for communication should begin with light and casual conversation in areas that the user has a lot of familiarity and can devote more resources to gaining a comfort level with the technology. Later work by Palloff and Pratt (1999, 2003) validated Gunawardena's recommendation in their call for establishing learning communities among online users at the very beginning of courses. In doing so, Palloff and Pratt argue that affective filters are lowered. \n\nInteractivity involves the activities and communication styles online users engage in. Norton (1986) identified eleven communication styles that can be associated with online communications: impression-leaving, contentious, open, dramatic, dominant, precise, relaxed, friendly, attentive, animated, and image. What style participants use in communicating, especially the style teachers use, will impact Social Presence . \n\nIn their 2002 study on Social Presence , Tu and McIssac declared, \"Social Presence positively influences online instruction; however, frequency of participation does not represent high Social Presence .\" In both a quantitative and qualitative analysis of 51 volunteers' interactions, Tu and McIssac found that social context was more qualitative (a learned skill set rather than a prescriptive set of actions) to achieve positive impact, online communication was more strongly related to quantifiable and organizational skills of participants, and that interactivity was a combination of skill sets and communication styles used in combination. As a result, Tu and McIssac identified the following variables that had strong positive effects on the fueling or perception of Social Presence .\n\nWhile research in Social Presence is ongoing, researchers are confidently recommending designing online and e-format courses for its presence along the three dimensions we have discussed. By building trust online, providing social \"hand holding\" support up front in any course using CMC and promoting informal relationships, teachers and instructors can provide a strong sense of Social Presence , increase sense of community, and in turn increase interaction among participants.\n\n\n\n"}

The play, printed in 1769 but dated 1770, was a stage failure when it premiered in 15 January 1774. \nThe action takes places in a hall of the palace of Cirta at the time if the Second Punic War. Sophonisbe, daughter of Asdrubal (Hasdrubal) is married to king Siphax (Syphax) of Numidia. Her former fiancé Massinisse (Massinissa) defeats and kills Siphax with the help of the Romans and wants to marry Sophonisbe; Scipion (Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus) however wants her sent to Rome. Massinisse therefore kills both Sophonisbe and himself.\n\nThe material for the plot derives from accounts by Titus Livius, Polybius and Appian, which had already been adapted into stage plays by a number of writers including Gian Giorgio Trissino (1514), Jean Mairet (1629), Pierre Corneille (1663) and Nathaniel Lee (1675). Analysis of the dramatic structure and the verse indicates that Voltaire drew on a number of earlier version of the story while crafting his own.\n\nVoltaire succeeded in having the play premiered at the Comédie-Française in 15 January 1774 but there were only four performances before it was taken off the stage.\nThe failure of both this and his other play \"Don Pèdre, roi de Castille\" depressed him, and he took a break from writing tragedies until 1777, when he wrote \"Irène\" and \"Agathocle\".\n\nVoltaire had arranged the printing of the work in late 1769 with the widow Duchesne in Paris. Publication followed at the end of that year, carrying the date 1770. The work was published with the title \"Sophonisbe, Tragédie de Mairet, reparée à neuf\", Veuve Duchesne, Paris, 1770. Voltaire added an explanatory preface in which he claimed that Mairet's work had been adapted by a certain Jean-Baptiste Lantin, who had died fifty years previously, but this is certainly spurious. It may be that Voltaire was uncertain about how the theatre-going public would respond to the play, and wished to distance himself to some degree from his own creation.\n\n"}
{"id": "612052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=612052", "title": "Spider-Man 2", "text": "Spider-Man 2\n\nSpider-Man 2 is a 2004 American superhero film directed by Sam Raimi and written by Alvin Sargent from a story by Alfred Gough, Miles Millar and Michael Chabon. A sequel to the 2002 film \"Spider-Man\", it is the second installment in the \"Spider-Man\" trilogy based on the fictional Marvel Comics character of the same name. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Rosemary Harris, and J. K. Simmons reprise their respective roles as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Mary Jane Watson, Harry Osborn, Aunt May, and J. Jonah Jameson, while Alfred Molina and Donna Murphy join the cast as Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus and Rosalie Octavius.\n\nSet two years after the events of \"Spider-Man\", the film finds Peter Parker struggling to manage both his personal life and his duties as Spider-Man, while Dr. Otto Octavius becomes a diabolical villain after a failed experiment kills his wife and leaves him neurologically fused to mechanical tentacles. Spider-Man must stop him from successfully recreating the experiment, which threatens to destroy the city, while dealing with a subconscious desire to stop being Spider-Man that is stripping him of his powers.\n\nPrincipal photography began in April 2003 in New York City and also took place in Los Angeles. \"Spider-Man 2\" was released in both conventional and IMAX theaters on June 30, 2004 and grossed $783 million worldwide, becoming the third highest-grossing film of the year. It won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and was also nominated for Best Sound Mixing and Best Sound Editing; it also received five awards at the Saturn Awards, including Best Fantasy Film and Best Director for Raimi. It is considered as one of the most influential and one of the best superhero films of all-time. Its success led to \"Spider-Man 3\" (2007).\n\nPeter Parker, secretly the superhero Spider-Man, is estranged from both love interest Mary Jane Watson and best friend Harry Osborn, and additionally discovers his Aunt May is facing eviction. He also finds himself suffering temporary, but reoccurring losses of his powers, often in life-threatening situations.\n\nHarry, now head of Oscorp's genetic and scientific research division, is sponsoring a fusion power project by nuclear scientist Otto Octavius, who befriends and mentors Peter. While handling hazardous materials, Octavius wears a harness of powerful robotic tentacle arms with artificial intelligence. During a public demonstration that Peter and Harry attend, a power spike causes the fusion reactor to destabilize. Octavius refuses to shut down the reactor, which goes critical — killing his wife and burning the inhibitor chip blocking the arms from his nervous system. Peter shuts the experiment down, destroying it in the process.\n\nAt a hospital, doctors prepare to surgically remove Octavius' harness. However, without the inhibitor chip the arms have developed sentience and attack them. Upon regaining consciousness and seeing the carnage, Octavius escapes and takes refuge at a harbor. Becoming increasingly influenced by the arms' AI, he robs a bank in order to fund a second experiment. Peter and May coincidentally are there, and Octavius takes May hostage. Peter rescues her, but Octavius flees with stolen money. The \"Daily Bugle\" subsequently dubs the scientist Doctor Octopus.\n\nMary Jane becomes engaged to astronaut John Jameson, son of \"Bugle\" publisher J. Jonah Jameson. Peter suffers an emotional breakdown over his inability to balance his life, resulting in him losing his powers. He abandons his Spider-Man identity, returns to his normal life, and attempts to reconcile with Mary Jane. A garbageman brings Peter's Spider-Man costume to Jameson, who takes credit for driving Spider-Man into hiding. Peter tells May the truth behind his Uncle Ben's death and how he is responsible. May forgives him, but the rise in New York City crime rates worries Peter.\n\nRequiring the isotope tritium to fuel his reactor, Octavius visits Harry to demand it. Harry agrees in exchange for Spider-Man, whom he believes is responsible for the death of his father Norman Osborn. He tells Octavius to seek Peter, who Harry believes is friends with Spider-Man, but tells Octavius not to harm him. Octavius locates Peter, tells him to find Spider-Man, and captures Mary Jane. Her endangerment leads to Peter's powers resurfacing. Just as Jameson admits he was wrong about Spider-Man, Peter steals his costume back from the \"Bugle\" and goes after Octavius.\n\nAs Peter battles Octavius, they fall onto a New York City Subway train. Octavius sabotages the controls and leaves Peter to save the passengers, which he does at a great physical toll. When he faints from exhaustion, the grateful passengers save him from falling and bring him into the train, seeing his unmasked face but promising to keep their knowledge hidden. In vain, they try to protect him when Octavius returns to capture Peter, whom Octavius delivers to Harry.\n\nAfter giving Octavius the tritium, Harry prepares to kill Spider-Man, only to be shocked to see Peter under the mask. Peter convinces Harry to direct him to Octavius' lair, as bigger things are at stake. As Spider-Man, he arrives at the doctor's waterfront laboratory and attempts to rescue Mary Jane discreetly. Octavius discovers him and they fight once again as the nuclear reaction swells. Peter ultimately subdues Octavius, reveals his identity, and persuades Octavius to let his dream go for the greater good. Octavius finally commands the tentacles to obey him, and gives his life to destroy the experiment. Mary Jane sees Spider-Man's true identity and feelings, which he says is why they cannot be together. Peter returns Mary Jane to John, and leaves.\n\nHarry is visited by a vision of his father in a mirror, pleading for Harry to avenge his death. Refusing to hurt Peter, Harry shatters the mirror, unintentionally revealing a secret room containing prototypes of the Green Goblin's equipment. On her wedding day, Mary Jane abandons John at the altar and runs to Peter's apartment. After they kiss, they hear police sirens, and Mary Jane encourages him go help as Spider-Man.\n\n\nBruce Campbell cameos as an obnoxious usher who denies Peter access to Mary Jane's play when he is late, thus causing a rift in their relationship. Spider-Man's co-creator Stan Lee cameos as a man on the street who saves a woman from falling debris during a battle between Spider-Man and Doc Ock. \"Evil Dead II\" co-writer Scott Spiegel appears as a man who attempts to eat some pizza Spider-Man is delivering, only to have it webbed from his hands. Joel McHale appears as the teller in the bank who refuses Aunt May's loan. Hal Sparks appears as the elevator passenger who has a conversation with Spidey. Comedian Donnell Rawlings appears as the New Yorker who exclaims that Spider-Man stole pizza. \"Bones\" star Emily Deschanel appears as the receptionist who tells Parker she isn't paying for the late pizza. \"The Daily Show\" correspondent Aasif Mandvi appears as Mr. Aziz, the pizza guy who subsequently fires Parker. Actor Elya Baskin appears as Mr. Ditkovich, Ursula's father and Peter's strict landlord demanding rent from him. Actor Joey Diaz appears as a train passenger who tells Doctor Octopus that he has to get past him to get to Spider-Man. Actress Vanessa Ferlito appears as one of Mary Jane's co-stars. Model/Actress Joy Bryant makes a cameo appearance as a spectator that witnesses Spider-Man in action. Director John Landis also appears briefly as one of the doctors who operates on Doctor Octopus. Actor Johnny Tri Nguyen appears as a stunt performer.\n\nImmediately after finishing \"Spider-Man\", director Sam Raimi with help from James Keltie segued into directing a sequel. In April 2002, Sony hired Alfred Gough and Miles Millar to write a script with Doctor Octopus, the Lizard and Black Cat as the villains. On May 8, 2002, following \"Spider-Man\"'s record breaking $115 million opening weekend, Sony Pictures announced a sequel for 2004. Entitled \"The Amazing Spider-Man\", after the character's main comic book title, the film was given a budget of $200 million and aimed for a release date of May 7, 2004. The following month, David Koepp was added to co-write with Gough and Millar.\n\nIn September 2002, Michael Chabon was hired to rewrite. His draft had a younger Doc Ock, who becomes infatuated with Mary Jane. His mechanical limbs use endorphins to counteract the pain of being attached to his body, which he enjoys. When he injures two muggers on a date, this horrifies Mary Jane and in the resulting battle with Spider-Man his tentacles are fused together, and the fusion begins to kill him. In the script, Octavius is the creator of the genetically-altered spider from the first film, and gives Peter an antidote to remove his powers: this means when Octavius is dying with his tentacles, he wants to extract Spider-Man's spine to save himself. This leads to the alliance with Harry in the final film. Beforehand, Harry and the \"Daily Bugle\" put a $10 million price on Spider-Man's head, causing the city's citizens to turn against him. Producer Avi Arad rejected the love triangle angle on Ock, and found Harry putting a price on Spider-Man's head unsubtle.\n\nRaimi sifted through the previous drafts by Gough, Millar, Koepp and Chabon, picking what he liked with screenwriter Alvin Sargent. He felt that thematically the film had to explore Peter's conflict with his personal wants against his responsibility, exploring the positive and negatives of his chosen path, and how he ultimately decides that he can be happy as a heroic figure. Raimi stated the story was partly influenced by \"Superman II\", which also explored the titular hero giving up his responsibilities. The story is mainly taken from \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" No. 50, \"Spider-Man No More!\" It was decided that Doctor Octopus would be kept as the villain, as he was both a visually interesting villain who was a physical match for Spider-Man, and a sympathetic figure with humanity, accompanied by the fact that the character had been repeatedly considered as a villain for the first film over the course of its 15-year development. Raimi changed much of the character's backstory, however, adding the idea of Otto Octavius being a hero of Peter, and how their conflict was about trying to rescue him from his demons rather than kill him.\n\n\"Spider-Man 2\" was shot on over one hundred sets and locations, beginning with a pre-shoot on the Loop in Chicago during two days in November 2002. The crew acquired a train of 2200 series cars, placing sixteen cameras for background shots of Spider-Man and Doc Ock's train fight. Principal photography began on April 12, 2003 in New York City. The crew moved on May 13 to Los Angeles, shooting on ten major sets created by production designer Neil Spisak. After the scare surrounding his back pains, Tobey Maguire relished performing many of his stunts, even creating a joke of it with Raimi, creating the line \"My back, my back\" as Spider-Man tries to regain his powers. Even Rosemary Harris took a turn, putting her stunt double out of work. In contrast, Alfred Molina joked that the stunt team would \"trick\" him into performing a stunt time and again.\n\nFilming was put on hiatus for eight weeks, in order to build Doc Ock's pier lair. It had been Spisak's idea to use a collapsed pier as Ock's lair, reflecting an exploded version of the previous lab and representing how Octavius' life had collapsed and grown more monstrous, evoking the cinema of Fritz Lang and the film \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\". Filming then resumed on that set, having taken fifteen weeks to build, occupying Sony's Stage 30. It was by long, and high, and a quarter-scale miniature was also built for the finale as it collapses. Filming was still going after Christmas 2003.\n\nA camera system called the Spydercam was used to allow filmmakers to express more of Spider-Man's world view, at times dropping fifty stories and with shot lengths of just over in New York or in Los Angeles. For some shots the camera would shoot at six frames per second for a faster playback increasing the sense of speed. Shots using the Spydercam were pre-planned in digital versions of cities, and the camera's movement was controlled with motion control, making it highly cost-effective. The camera system was only used in the previous film for the final shot.\n\nAlthough roughly the same, costume designer James Acheson made numerous subtle changes to Spider-Man's costume. The colors were made richer and bolder, the spider emblem was given more elegant lines and enlarged, the eye-lenses were somewhat smaller, and the muscle suit underneath was made into pieces, to give a better sense of movement. The helmet Maguire wore under his mask was also improved, with better movement for the false jaw and magnetic eye pieces, which were easier to remove.\n\nTo create Doctor Octopus' mechanical tentacles, Edge FX was hired to create a corset, a metal and rubber girdle, a rubber spine and four foam rubber tentacles which were long, which altogether weighed . The claws of each tentacle, which were dubbed \"death flowers\", were controlled by a single puppeteer in a chair. Each tentacle was controlled by four people, who rehearsed every scene with Molina to give a natural sense of movement as if the tentacles were moving due to Octavius' muscle movement. On-set, Molina christened his co-stars \"Larry\", \"Harry\", \"Moe\" and \"Flo\", with \"Flo\" being the top-right tentacle.\n\nEdge FX was only hired to do scenes where Octavius carries his tentacles. CGI was used for when the tentacles carry Octavius: a high rig held Molina to glide through his surroundings, with CG tentacles added later. The CG versions were scanned straight from the practical ones. However, using the practical versions was always preferred to save money, and each scene was always filmed first with Edge FX's creations to see if CGI was truly necessary. Completing the illusion, the sound designers chose not to use servo sound effects, feeling it would rob the tentacles of the sense that they were part of Octavius' body, and instead used motorcycle chains and piano wires.\n\nThe film was initially released on VHS and DVD on November 30, 2004. The DVD was available in both anamorphic widescreen and Pan-and-scan \"fullscreen\", as well as a Superbit edition and in a box-set with the first film. There was also a collector's DVD gift set including a reprint of \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #50. The DVD and VHS releases sold 12,404,597 units and grossed $185,260,344 in the United States. The film was also released on Sony's proprietary Universal Media Disc (UMD) format in 2005, with 1million UMD copies of the film sold in the United States as part of a PlayStation Portable (PSP) bundle.\n\nThe film was released on Blu-ray in October 2007 as a part of the \"Spider-Man: The High Definition Trilogy\" box set. It was also released separately on Blu-ray in November 2010 as well as the previous film as part of Sony's Blu-ray Essentials Collection including both the theatrical release and the 2.1 extended cut. All three films were rereleased on Blu-ray as part of the \"Spider-Man: Origins\" set on 2017.\n\nAn extended cut of the film, entitled \"Spider-Man 2.1\", was released on DVD and Blu-ray on April 17, 2007 and on October 30, 2007. The cut included eight minutes of new footage, with new special features not included in the original release, as well as a sneak preview of the then-upcoming \"Spider-Man 3\". The cut featured 3 new, 1 alternate, and 11 extended scenes, and a featurette: \"Inside Spider-Man 2.1\", detailing the making of the cut.\n\n\"Spider-Man 2\" grossed $373.6 million in the United States and Canada and $410.2 million in other territories for a total worldwide gross of $783.8 million, against a production budget of $200 million.\n\n\"Spider-Man 2\" opened in the United States on June 30, 2004 and grossed $40.4 million in its first day; this broke the first film's opening day record of $39.4 million until it was surpassed a year later by \"\" ($50.0 million). The film also broke \"\"s record ($34.5 million) for the highest-grossing Wednesday of all time. It held the Wednesday record for three years until it was topped by \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" ($44.2 million). Its Friday-to-Sunday gross reached a total of $88.2 million, which was the highest Independence Day weekend, breaking \"Men in Black II\"s record ($52.1 million), until it was broken seven years later by \"\" ($97.9 million). In its first six days, the film had grossed over $180 million. The film also eventually went on to gross $373.5 million, becoming 2004's second-highest-grossing film, behind \"Shrek 2\". \"Spider-Man 2\" is the 28th highest-grossing film in the U.S. and Canada and sold an estimated 60,158,700 tickets in the US.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \"Spider-Man 2\" has an approval rating of 93% based on 269 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Boasting an entertaining villain and deeper emotional focus, this is a nimble sequel that improves upon the original\". On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, calculated an average score of 83 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A–\" on an A+ to F scale. The film was placed at 411 on \"Empire\" magazine's top 500 movies list.\n\n\"Chicago Tribune\" Mark Caro stated that Alfred Molina was a \"pleasingly complex\" villain, and the film as a whole \"improves upon its predecessor in almost every way.\" Kenneth Turan, of the \"Los Angeles Times\", gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, and concurred with Caro when he stated, \"Doc Ock grabs this film with his quartet of sinisterly serpentine mechanical arms and refuses to let go.\" Roger Ebert, who had given the first film two and a half stars, gave \"Spider-Man 2\" a perfect four out of four stars, calling it \"The best superhero movie since the modern genre was launched with \"Superman\" (1978)\", and praising the film for \"effortlessly [combining] special effects and a human story, keeping its parallel plots alive and moving.\" He later called it the fourth best film of 2004.\" IGN's Richard George felt \"Sam Raimi and his writing team delivered an iconic, compelling version of Spider-Man's classic foe... We almost wish there was a way to retroactively add some of these elements to the original character.\" In 2016, James Charisma of \"Playboy\" ranked the film #9 on a list of \"15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals\".\n\nConversely, J. Hoberman, of \"The Village Voice\", thought the first half of the film was \"talky bordering on tiresome\", with the film often stopping to showcase Raimi's idea of humor. Charles Taylor believed, \"The script's miscalculation of Peter's decision feeds into the pedestrian quality of Raimi's direction and into Maguire's weightlessness... [Maguire] simply does not suggest a heroic presence\", and suggested that \"Dunst appears to be chafing against strictures she cannot articulate.\"\n\n\"Spider-Man 2\" won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, and was nominated for Best Sound Mixing (Kevin O'Connell, Greg P. Russell, Jeffrey J. Haboush and Joseph Geisinger) and Best Sound Editing, but lost to \"Ray\" and \"The Incredibles\", respectively. The film won Saturn Awards for Best Actor, Best Director, Best Fantasy Film, Best Special Effects, and Best Writer, while being nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Best Music. It was nominated for two British Academy Film Awards for Special Visual Effects and Sound, but lost to \"The Day After Tomorrow\" and \"Ray\", respectively. The AFI listed the film as one of the 2004's ten best films, and nominated it for positions on the lists of the top 10 fantasy films, the 100 most inspiring American films, and the 100 greatest American films.\n\nDespite the many comic book super-hero movies which have followed it, \"Spider-Man 2\" still regularly tops rankings as one of the best-loved of the genre. In 2012, Ask Men wrote, \"This is the high-water mark for Spider-Man movies, and good luck to anyone who wants to top it.\"\n\nIn 2013, Screen Crush wrote, Forbes described it as \"Not just one of the greatest sequels, but one of the best films of the genre, period.\"\n\nIn 2014, Yahoo Movies! wrote, \"Raimi's best superhero movie still takes the cake.\"\n\nIn June 2017, Cade Onder called Spider-Man 2 the best comic book movie ever.\n\nIn April 2018, Pierce Singgih of Film School Rejects called it \"the best summer movie ever\" and that its \"emotional and calculated story stands above modern summer flicks\" like those of \"The Avengers\" and \"The Dark Knight\".\n\n"}

{"id": "3972556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3972556", "title": "Super Bowl commercials", "text": "Super Bowl commercials\n\nThe U.S. television broadcast of the Super Bowl – the championship game of the National Football League (NFL) – features many high-profile television commercials, colloquially known as Super Bowl ads. The phenomenon is a result of the game's extremely high viewership and wide demographics: Super Bowl games have frequently been among the United States' most watched television broadcasts, with Nielsen having estimated that Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 was seen by at least 114.4 million viewers in the United States, surpassing the previous year's Super Bowl as the highest-rated television broadcast in U.S. history. As such, advertisers have typically used commercials during the Super Bowl as a means of building awareness for their products and services among this wide audience, while also trying to generate buzz around the ads themselves so they may receive additional exposure, such as becoming a viral video.\n\nSuper Bowl commercials have become a cultural phenomenon of their own alongside the game itself; many viewers only watch the game to see the commercials, national surveys (such as the \"USA Today\" Super Bowl Ad Meter) judge which advertisement carried the best viewer response, and CBS has aired yearly specials since 2000 chronicling notable commercials from the game. Super Bowl advertisements have become iconic and well-known because of their cinematographic quality, unpredictability, surreal humor, and use of special effects. The use of celebrity cameos has also been common in Super Bowl ads. A number of major brands, including Budweiser, Coca-Cola, Doritos, GoDaddy and Master Lock, have been well known for making repeated appearances during the Super Bowl.\n\nThe prominence of airing a commercial during the Super Bowl has also carried an increasingly high price: the average cost of a 30-second commercial during the Super Bowl has ranged from $37,500 at Super Bowl I, to around $2.2 million at Super Bowl XXXIV in 2000, and by Super Bowl XLIX in 2015, had doubled to around $4.5 million. The cost of advertising during the Super Bowl has reached a point that some companies may not be able to recoup their costs from the resulting revenue. Some commercials airing during, or proposed to air during the game, have also attracted controversy due to the nature of their content.\n\nSuper Bowl commercials are largely limited to the United States' broadcast of the game. Complaints about the inability to view the ads are prevalent in Canada, where federal \"simsub\" regulations require pay television providers to replace feeds of programs from U.S. broadcast stations with domestic feeds if they are being broadcast at the same time as a Canadian broadcast station. In 2016, the CRTC, Canada's telecom regulator, enacted a policy to forbid the use of simsub during the Super Bowl, citing viewer complaints and a belief that these ads were an \"integral part\" of the game; Super Bowl LI was the first game to fall under this policy. The NFL's Canadian rightsholder Bell Media challenged the policy at the federal appeals court, arguing that it violated the Broadcasting Act by singling out a specific program for regulation, and devalued its broadcast rights to the game. The court, however, ruled in December 2017 that the CRTC's actions were reasonable.\n\nSuper Bowl games have frequently been among the United States' most watched television broadcasts; Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 set an all-time record for viewership at the game, with an average of 114.4 million viewers according to Nielsen, exceeding a record set the previous year at Super Bowl XLVIII (112.2 million). Of the top twenty television broadcasts in the United States by viewership, only one program—\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\", the 1983 series finale of \"M*A*S*H\"—was not a Super Bowl, ranking in between Super Bowl XLIII (98.7 million) and XLIV (106.6 million) with 106 million viewers. The game broadcast not only attracts a wide audience, but a diverse audience spanning many demographics and age groups, and women have accounted for at least 40% of Super Bowl viewers. As such, airing a commercial during the Super Bowl can be valuable for advertisers seeking an audience for their products and services.\n\nBecause of the overall buzz surrounding them, commercials aired during the Super Bowl receive additional airplay and exposure outside of the game as well, such as during newscasts and morning shows. Since 2000, CBS has aired an annual television special prior to the game, \"Super Bowl’s Greatest Commercials\", which showcases notable Super Bowl ads from prior games, and in recent years, has allowed viewers to vote for their favorite Super Bowl ads to be featured during it. Many viewers watch the Super Bowl only for the commercials: in 2015, Dish Network went as far as allowing the \"Primetime Anytime\" and \"AutoHop\" features on its Hopper digital video recorder, which automatically records primetime programs from the major networks and trims commercials from the recordings, to function in reverse and allow users to view a recording of the Super Bowl that skips over the game itself and only shows the commercials.\n\nThe popularity of video sharing websites such as YouTube have also allowed Super Bowl advertisements to become viral videos; to take advantage of this, a growing number of advertisers have elected to post previews of their commercial, or even the full-length commercial, online prior to the game. A notable example of this strategy occurred at Super Bowl XLV: on February 2, 2011, four days prior to the game, Volkswagen posted the full version of its \"Star Wars\"-themed ad \"The Force\" on YouTube. By Sunday, the ad had already received over 16 million views, and went on to be the most shared Super Bowl advertisement ever. Ironically, until Super Bowl 50, official online streams of the Super Bowl provided by U.S. broadcasters did not include all of the commercials from the television broadcast; at Super Bowl XLIX, only 18 advertisers bought ad time within NBC's stream of the game (although NBC did post all of the ads on a Tumblr blog throughout the game). At Super Bowl 50, CBS mandated that each advertiser's purchase cover both the television and digital broadcasts, meaning that for the first time, the online stream of Super Bowl 50 provided by CBS included all national commercials from the television broadcast.\n\nOwing to the large potential audience, the network broadcasting the Super Bowl can also charge a premium on advertising time during the game. A thirty-second commercial at Super Bowl I in 1967 cost US$37,500. By contrast, Super Bowl XLVI set what was then a record for the price of a Super Bowl advertisement, selling 58 spots (including those longer than 30 seconds) during the game, generating $75 million USD for NBC; the most expensive advertisement sold for $5.84 million. Super Bowl XLVII and Super Bowl XLVIII both set the average cost of a 30-second commercial at $4 million. Super Bowl XLIX, also broadcast by NBC, surpassed that record with a base price of $4.5 million.\n\nMedia executives projected that the cost of a 30-second commercial could exceed $5 million at Super Bowl 50, a figure that CBS confirmed. That price would serve as a plateau for the two subsequent games; Fox would match that figure for Super Bowl LI, and NBC would slightly exceed for Super Bowl LII, although it never explicitly stated how much its base price would be. Super Bowl LI would also, for the first time in the game's history, feature overtime play; four ads were broadcast between the end of regulation and the start of play, including two ads seen earlier in the game, and two ads that were sold for and also seen during the post-game show. While Fox had negotiated ad sales for overtime in the event it were to occur, it is unknown whether the network charged a premium on top of the base cost. In comparison, \"Sunday Night Football\", the flagship primetime game during the regular season, has an average cost of around $700,000 for 30 seconds of time. The average cost of a 30-second ad during the Super Bowl increased by 87% between 2008 and 2017. However, the $5 million per 30 seconds appears to have become a soft cap, as for the third year in a row, as of Super Bowl LII, this has been quoted as the rough cost per ad.\n\nThe high cost of purchasing advertising time, on top of the cost of producing the commercial itself, has led to concerns by marketers that the increased sales that can result from a Super Bowl commercial does not recoup the cost of buying the ad time. Some advertisers, including Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, General Motors and Pepsi, chose to skip recent Super Bowls due to the high costs of advertising—although Pepsi would return in 2013, followed by GM in 2014. As a lower-cost alternative, some advertisers have elected to purchase advertising time during the games' extended pre-game shows (which, during Super Bowl XLVIII, ranged from $100,000 to $2 million), or from individual network affiliates that are broadcasting it.\n\nAs the 2018 Winter Olympics marked the first time since 1992 that the Winter Olympics and Super Bowl were shown by the same network in a single year, NBC offered advertisers the opportunity to purchase packages of time for their ads covering both Super Bowl LII and the Olympics. NBC stated that doing so would allow advertisers to amortize their expenses through additional airplay during the Olympics.\n\nMany Super Bowl advertisements have become iconic and well-known because of their quality, unpredictability, humor, and use of special effects. In recent years, advertisers have also attempted to stand out from others by producing ads with cinematographic qualities, and ads that channel emotions and real-world issues. The use of celebrity cameos has also been common in Super Bowl ads, ranging from then-unknown personalities, to unexpected combinations of celebrities, such as a 2007 CBS network promo for \"Late Show\" that featured David Letterman and Oprah Winfrey—whom Letterman had conflicts with following a joke directed at her during the 67th Academy Awards, and a 2010 sequel that also included Jay Leno (who was slated to return to its competitor, \"The Tonight Show\", following a publicized conflict between NBC and Conan O'Brien).\n\nA number of brands, including Budweiser, Coca-Cola, and Master Lock, have been well known for their frequent appearances as advertisers during the Super Bowl.\n\nSeveral notable commercials aired during Super Bowl games during the 1970s. In a commercial during Super Bowl IV in 1970, Chicago Bears linebacker Dick Butkus endorsed Prestone, a brand of antifreeze, stating the tagline, \"Because plugging holes is my business.\" The ad marked the first highly successful celebrity endorsement in Super Bowl advertising. In 1973, lotion brand Noxzema aired a commercial starring Farrah Fawcett and quarterback Joe Namath, featuring Namath being literally \"creamed\" by Fawcett. Later in the decade, Fawcett would become better known for her role on the television series \"Charlie's Angels\".\n\nAt Super Bowl XI in 1977, Xerox aired an advertisement entitled \"Monks\"; starring Jack Eagle as Brother Dominic—a monk discovering that he could create copies of a manuscript using a new Xerox photocopier. The advertisement was so well received that Brother Dominic became the mascot of Xerox for years afterward. Xerox premiered a new version of \"Monks\" in January 2017 (although not as a Super Bowl ad), which updated the premise of the original ad to feature the company's modern products.Y&R New York's CEO Leslie Sims described \"Monks\" as being the \"first viral ad\", explaining that it \"was the first commercial that got people to request to see it again on TV\".\n\nAmong the most prominent of campaigns during early Super Bowl games were those of Master Lock. In 1965, the company had first run a television commercial demonstrating the strength of its padlocks, by having a person shoot it with a handgun in a failed attempt to breach it. The campaign was pulled after the company's advertising director, Edson F. Allen, realized the stunt could be imitated by those who were unsure of the commercial's authenticity. By the 1970s, Allen discussed the possibility of reviving the concept, but using a rifle rather than a handgun to make it harder to imitate. The resulting commercial would premiere in 1974 during Super Bowl VIII; despite concerns by the staff of Master Lock and their agency, Campbell Mithun, over the content of the ad, the commercial was well received by the general public.\n\nWhen Cramer-Krasselt took over as Master Lock's agency later in the year, the company decided to make the gun ads a tradition, and began to produce new ads themed around the concept (including one featuring skeptics of previous editions of the ad, and one showcasing the company's major corporate clients) for future Super Bowls during the subsequent decades (aside from a brief hiatus in 1986 and 1987), and the early 1990s. Allen went as far as describing the ads as an \"event\" that continued to attract media attention after the game. The Super Bowl ads helped improve Master Lock's market share; from 1973 through 1994, sales had increased from $35 million per year to $200 million per year. Master Lock's yearly Super Bowl commercials accounted for nearly all of the company's annual advertising budget.\n\nAt Super Bowl XIV in 1980, Coca-Cola aired an advertisement popularly known as \"Hey Kid, Catch!\", featuring Pittsburgh Steelers All-Pro defensive lineman \"Mean Joe\" Greene being offered a Coca-Cola by a young fan—played by Tommy Okon, drinking it in one sip, and tossing the kid his game-worn jersey as repayment. The advertisement was filmed in 1979 and premiered that October, but did not gain mainstream attention until its airing during Super Bowl XIV. \"Hey Kid, Catch!\" became one of Greene's most famous roles; the ad would win a Clio Award, spawn a made-for-TV movie on NBC entitled \"The Steeler and the Pittsburgh Kid\", and be re-made for other markets with local athletes. In a 2011 poll by \"Advertising Age\", readers named \"Hey Kid, Catch!\" as the best Super Bowl commercial of all-time.\n\nThe ad also became the subject of parodies on television series, such as \"The Simpsons\", and in other ads. At Super Bowl XLIII in 2009, Coca-Cola aired a parody of the ad for its Coca-Cola Zero brand starring Steelers safety Troy Polamalu. Continuing an ongoing theme in the promotion of Coke Zero, the ad was interrupted by a Coca-Cola \"brand manager\" accusing Polamalu of \"stealing\" their commercial; in response, Polamalu tackled him and ripped off his shirt to give to the child. In 2012, Procter & Gamble aired a parody of the ad entitled \"Stinky\". The ad saw Greene reprise his role, but having the young fan throw Downy Unstoppables fabric softener to Greene instead of Coca-Cola, and the fan rejecting his jersey because it smelled. In 2016, Joe Greene was reunited with Okon as part of a segment for CBS's \"Super Bowl's Greatest Commercials\" special.\n\nCoca-Cola has also used the Super Bowl for other campaigns: in 2009, the company aired new ads as part of its recently introduced Open Happiness campaign. In 2014, the company aired the multiculturalism-themed ad \"It's Beautiful\", which featured scenes of Americans of various races and ethnicities, including the first ever same-sex couple featured in a Super Bowl commercial. However, the ad attracted due to its use of a multilingual rendition of \"America the Beautiful\" as its soundtrack. In 2015, the company aired ad entitled \"#makeithappy\"; themed around cyberbullying, the ad featured negative comments directed towards a teen being transformed into positive messages after a technician accidentally spills a bottle of Coca-Cola on a server.\n\nAt Super Bowl XVIII, Apple Computer broadcast an advertisement for its Macintosh computer entitled \"1984\", created by the agency Chiat/Day and directed by Ridley Scott. The advertisement, which incorporated elements inspired by the novel \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", featured a woman wearing track-and-field clothing (including orange pants and a white shirt branded with an image of the Macintosh) sprinting into a large auditorium and hurling a large hammer into a screen (displaying a large Big Brother-like figure speaking to a massive assembly of drone-like people in the audience), concluding with the message \"On January 24, Apple Computer will introduce the Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won’t be like '1984.'\" The advertisement received critical acclaim from both viewers and critics alike for helping position the Macintosh as a unique entry into the personal computer market, and is often considered to be one of the best Super Bowl advertisements of all-time.\n\nThe ad first aired nationally during Super Bowl XVIII. As the agency wanted \"1984\" to be eligible for that year's industry awards, which were only open to ads that aired during 1983, a low-profile premiere of the ad occurred on the Twin Falls, Idaho station KMVT on December 31, 1983 shortly before midnight. Apple attempted to follow up \"1984\" the following year with a new ad entitled \"Lemmings\", to promote its Macintosh Office system. The ad, which featured blindfolded businessmen walking over the edge of a cliff in unison, was criticized for its \"dark\" theme and exaggerated premise. By contrast, \"Lemmings\" has been considered to be one of Apple's worst television advertisements.\n\nThe beer brand Budweiser has long been a Super Bowl fixture. Its parent company Anheuser-Busch held a long-term contract with the NFL that allowed it to buy several slots of air time from the game's broadcaster each year at a steep discount, a contract that ran through Super Bowl 50; the company continues to buy multiple commercials in each game. Budweiser runs several advertising campaigns throughout each game, one of which has traditionally featured its mascots, the Budweiser Clydesdales. The Clydesdales were included in at least one Super Bowl commercial every year from Super Bowl IX in 1975 through Super Bowl LI in 2017. Budweiser's parent company Anheuser-Busch has been the most successful advertiser in the annual Super Bowl Ad Meter survey organized by \"USA Today\", having finished first on the survey fourteen times. When \"USA Today\" held an \"All-Time Ad Meter\" bracket tournament in 2014, two Budweiser commercials met in the finals; the winner was a 2008 ad spoofing \"Rocky\", which went against its 1999 ad \"Separated at Birth\", which featured a pair of Dalmatian puppies given to two separate owners, but eventually seeing each other again after one became a mascot dog on the Clydesdales' carriage.\n\nAs of 2015, Budweiser had won the survey thirteen times in fifteen years; its 2013 advertisement entitled \"Brotherhood\" focused on the relationship and emotional reunion of a clydesdale with its original trainer three years after leaving to become a Budweiser Clydesdale. Prior to the game, Budweiser also invited users to vote via Twitter on a name for the new foal that would be featured in the ad. A 2014 ad entitled \"Puppy Love\" featured a similar reunion between an adopted dog and another Budweiser Clydesdale. Its most recent victory and its third in a row, 2015's \"Lost Dog\", featured a dog being rescued from a wolf by the Clydesdales.\n\nIn 2017, Budweiser broadcast \"Born the Hard Way\", an ad which dramatized Anheuser-Busch co-founder Adolphus Busch's emigration to the United States from Germany to establish the company. The advertisement attracted controversy among supporters of U.S. president Donald Trump for being pro-immigration, in the wake of an executive order issued by Trump which briefly restricted entry into the country by residents of several countries with predominant Muslim populations. A boycott effort also emerged among Trump supporters. Anheuser-Busch denied that the ad was meant to be a political message, as it had been in production for the past year, and that it was meant to \"highlight the ambition of our founder, Adolphus Busch, and his unrelenting pursuit of the American dream.\" Barring a brief appearance, the Clydesdales were not prominently featured during the ad. However, Budweiser's social media outlets promoted \"ClydesdaleCam\", a Facebook live stream of the Clydesdales watching the game in a stable and waiting to see their cameo.\n\nIn 2018, Budweiser broadcast \"Stand by You\", an ad which chronicled Anheuser-Busch's disaster relief program of distributing cans of drinking water from its brewery in Cartersville, Georgia. The Clydesdales were, once again, downplayed from its television spots, with the brewery only airing a 5-second bumper in the second quarter to promote its streaming ClydesdaleCam event. However, the Clydesdales were featured in several digital-oriented companion campaigns alongside the game, including ClydesdaleCam, a second, web-exclusive ad entitled \"Beer Country\", as well as themed Snapchat filters.\n\nBudweiser has introduced other campaigns during the Super Bowl as well. During Super Bowl XXIII, Budweiser aired an episodic series of commercials known as the \"Bud Bowl\"—which featured a football game between stop motion-animated beer bottles representing Budweiser and Bud Light, with commentary by Bob Costas and Paul Maguire. Proving popular, the \"Bud Bowl\" would return at subsequent Super Bowls; it had become so popular that some viewers actually wagered on the outcome of the \"Bud Bowl\" as if it were an actual event. In 1995, Budweiser introduced the first of a series of ads featuring a group of three frogs named Bud, Weis, and Er. The frog ads were a major success for the brewery after the game, and ranked as one of its most popular advertising campaigns following its premiere.\n\nAnheuser-Busch has aired commercials for other beer brands during the game alongside Budweiser, such as Budweiser Black Crown, and Beck's Sapphire. At Super Bowl LI, the company re-launched Busch, and broadcast a Bud Light ad featuring the ghost of its former dog mascot Spuds MacKenzie.\n\nChrysler, and the marques of its current parent company Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, have made repeated appearances during the Super Bowl. From 2011 through 2014, Chrysler became known for running several notable long-form ads; at Super Bowl XLV, Chrysler aired a two-minute long ad entitled \"Born of Fire\" to launch the Chrysler 200 and the company's new slogan \"Imported from Detroit\". The ad featured scenes depicting the history and revitalization of Detroit, as well as local rapper Eminem and his song \"Lose Yourself\". The ad was critically acclaimed, and won a Creative Arts Emmy Award for \"Best Commercial\" in 2011.\n\nDuring Super Bowl XLVI, Chrysler broadcast \"Halftime in America\", a two-minute long commercial directed by David Gordon Green, written by poet Matthew Dickman and narrated by actor Clint Eastwood. The commercial recounted the automotive industry crisis of 2008–10, set to scenes showing Americans in despair, but then in hope. The narration of the ad equated the emergence from the crisis to the second half of a football game, explaining that \"All that matters now is what’s ahead: how do we come from behind? How do we come together? And how do we win? Detroit’s showing us it can be done. And what’s true about them is true about all of us. This country can’t be knocked out with one punch. We get right back up again, and when we do the world’s gonna hear the roar of our engines.\" The ad was heavily viewed online after the game, receiving over 4 million views on YouTube within 36 hours, but also attracted due to its political overtones.\n\nSuper Bowl XLVII featured an ad for Ram Trucks, which adapted Paul Harvey's 1978 speech \"So God Made a Farmer.\" During Super Bowl 50, the company focused exclusively on its SUV brand Jeep. At Super Bowl LI, the company similarly focused exclusively on Alfa Romeo, as part of a campaign to re-launch the Fiat-owned brand in the United States. Super Bowl LII featured two Ram Trucks commercials, the latter featuring an extract from a 1968 speech by Martin Luther King Jr., as well as three Jeep ads.\n\nSuper Bowl XXXIV (2000) became notable for featuring a large number of commercials from dot-com companies, to the extent that critics dubbed it the \"Dot-com Super Bowl\". With a 30-second ad costing around $2.2 million, 20% of the commercial time sold went to dot-com companies—constituting $44 million of the $130 million spent in total on Super Bowl advertising time that year. Despite their aspirations and the boosts in traffic they received from the ads, all of the publicly held companies which advertised saw their stocks slump after the game as the dot-com bubble began to rapidly deflate. Some of the companies that advertised during the game—including Epidemic Marketing and Pets.com, had become defunct by the end of the year, and at Super Bowl XXXV, only three dot-com companies—E-Trade, HotJobs, and Monster.com—advertised during the game.\n\nNotable dot-com ads broadcast during the game included \"If You Leave Me Now\", an ad for Pets.com which introduced the website's iconic sock puppet mascot, a self-proclaimed \"worst commercial on the Super Bowl\" by LifeMinder.com that consisted only of text captions on a yellow background with \"Chopsticks\" playing in the background, and \"Monkey\"—a deliberately nonsensical E-Trade ad that featured a monkey dancing to \"La Cucaracha\", and the tagline \"Well, we just wasted $2,000,000. What are you doing with your money?\" Electronic Data Systems also aired an ad during the game that featured cowboys who herded cats instead of cows.\n\nIn 2006, Doritos began holding a promotion known as \"Crash the Super Bowl\", soliciting viewers to film their own Doritos commercials to possibly be aired during the game. At Super Bowl XLIII in 2009, an additional bonus prize of $1 million was added if any of the winning entries were named #1 on the Super Bowl Ad Meter survey results; Doritos would reach the #1 spot on the survey that year with an ad entitled \"Free Doritos\", created by Joe and Dave Herbert of Batesville, Indiana. The ad featured an office worker attempting to fulfill a prediction that he would receive free Doritos by smashing open a vending machine with a crystal ball.\n\nThe following year, additional prizes of $600,000 and $400,000 were added for reaching second and third place on the poll, plus an additional $1 million bonus for each if three of the ads were to sweep the top three. A 2010 finalist, \"UnderDog\", reached second place on the poll.\n\nAnother user-submitted Doritos ad, \"The Cowboy Kid\", finished in second place on the Ad Meter survey in 2014, winning $50,000. The contest itself was won by \"Time Machine\"; created by Ryan Thomas Andersen of Arizona and produced on a budget of only $300, the ad featured his son scamming his neighbor into giving him his bag of Doritos by claiming that he had built a time machine that was fueled by them. For winning the contest, Anderson received $1 million and an opportunity to work on set during the production of the film \"\".\n\nThe domain registrar and web hosting company GoDaddy was well known for producing Super Bowl commercials featuring female spokespersons it dubbed \"GoDaddy Girls\", such as professional driver Danica Patrick, and for its 2011 ad, comedian Joan Rivers. Many of the company's planned Super Bowl ads were allegedly rejected by broadcasters due to their risqué subject matter, leading to GoDaddy instead airing a \"teaser\" ad during the game that instructed viewers to watch the uncensored version of the ad on their website.\n\nThe company's first appearance at Super Bowl XXXIX parodied the \"wardrobe malfunction\" that had occurred at last year's halftime show, featuring a woman testifying to Congress about why GoDaddy wanted to advertise during the game, but a strap of her tank top coming undone. The ad was scheduled to air twice, but its second airing was pulled in response to concerns by Fox and the NFL over its content. The following year at Super Bowl XL, thirteen ad concepts were rejected by ABC due to their content. In 2008, a GoDaddy ad entitled \"Exposure\" was rejected by Fox for using the word \"beaver\" as a double entendre. In turn, the ad was replaced with one advertising the availability of the ad on GoDaddy's website, attracting two million visits. In October 2013, GoDaddy's chief marketing officer Barb Rechterman announced that the company would no longer air provocative ads during the Super Bowl, explaining that \"our new brand of Super Bowl commercials will make it crystal clear what we do and who we stand for. We may be changing our approach, but as we've always said, we don't care what the critics think. We are all about our customers.\"\n\nGoDaddy's ad in 2015, \"Journey Home\", was controversial for different reasons: it featured a puppy travelling back to its owner after falling out of a pickup truck, only to learn that he had been sold to a new owner using a website built with GoDaddy. The ad was criticized by animal rights groups, who felt that it implied an endorsement of commercial puppy mills. GoDaddy quickly pulled the ad in response to the controversy; GoDaddy CEO Blake Irving explained that the ad's humor had \"clearly missed the mark\". PETA partially praised the ad for portraying the seller as being a \"callous jerk\", but explained that \"The sale of animals online and from pet stores and breeders should be roundly condemned, and it was today. GoDaddy did the right thing by swiftly promoting adoption.\"\n\nAs a byproduct of the increased cost of ad time at the Super Bowl, financial software company Intuit made its debut at Super Bowl XLVIII by hosting a promotion known as \"Small Business Big Game\", in which small businesses with \"inspiring\" stories competed for a chance to earn a commercial during the Super Bowl funded by Intuit, as decided by user votes. Company CEO Brad D. Smith explained that the promotion was an extension of the company's goals to improve financial lives \"in a way that you'd never imagine going back\", while Ken Wach, senior vice president of marketing for Intuit's Small Business Group, explained that \"normally you're looking at Budweiser ads or Chevy ads, so this was about putting small businesses on the national stage and shining the spotlight on them as heroes of the economy.\"\n\nThe winner of the 2014 edition was GoldieBlox, a toy company with a focus on promoting mechanical engineering to young girls. While the campaign was a success for the winner, resulting in increased prominence and sales, Wach felt that Intuit was not able to \"sustain the momentum as much as we would have liked\". At Super Bowl XLIX, Intuit did not hold the promotion, but still aired an ad for its own TurboTax product. The contest returned in 2015 for Super Bowl 50, and was won by Death Wish Coffee.\n\nDisney Parks is known for an advertising campaign associated with the Super Bowl entitled \"What's Next?\", but more popularly known as \"I'm going to Disney World!\". The ads feature a player from the winning team (typically the MVP) responding with the eponymous declaration after being asked what they would do after the game. These ads typically premiere on the day after the Super Bowl. The series began following Super Bowl XXI, and first featured Phil Simms of the New York Giants. Disney has reportedly offered players $30,000 if they participate in the commercial and visit a Disney theme park (usually Disney World or Disneyland) afterward, and has extended the campaign to champion players in other sports. At Super Bowl XL, Disney aired an in-game commercial themed around the campaign, featuring Pittsburgh Steelers and Seattle Seahawks players rehearsing the line in case they won.\n\nIn order to dodge the high costs of obtaining national ad time, or to broadcast more regionalized campaigns, some advertisers elect to purchase local advertising time from the individual network affiliates airing the Super Bowl, such as the Church of Scientology—who bought local ad time in major urban markets such as New York City in 2014, and the Bank of Montreal to promote its BMO Harris Bank branches. In 2012, Old Milwaukee broadcast a Super Bowl ad starring Will Ferrell; as an extension of the beer's regional campaign with the actor, the ad only aired in the city of North Platte, Nebraska.\n\nIn 2014, several notable local ads were broadcast. The Utah Department of Transportation used the game to broadcast a public service announcement on seat belt usage for its \"Zero Fatalities\" campaign, which featured a depiction of a child who had died in a rollover crash because he did not use a seat belt. In Savannah, Georgia, local personal injury lawyer Jamie Casino broadcast a two-minute long advertisement on WTGS, which featured a thriller-styled retelling of how he stopped representing \"cold-hearted villains\" to avenge the 2012 Labor Day shooting death of his brother Michael Biancosino, and Emily Pickels, after a subsequent statement by former police chief Willie Lovett who claimed that there were \"no innocent victims\", culminating with Casino digging through a grave with a sledgehammer. The commercial went viral after the game, with \"The Independent\" dubbing it the \"most metal\" Super Bowl ad imaginable. Tribune Broadcasting used local time on the Fox affiliates it owned to air an extended promo for \"Salem\", a then-upcoming series on sister cable network WGN America.\n\nIn 2015, Newcastle Brown Ale bought time on local NBC stations to air an ad that, as a commentary on the high cost of national Super Bowl advertising time, contained plugs for 37 other products and companies it had recruited in a crowdfunding campaign. In Savannah, Georgia, Jamie Casino aired a sequel to his 2014 ad that focused on the \"bullies\" that he had encountered throughout his life.\n\nIn 2016, St. Louis attorney Terry Crouppen aired a local ad in which he criticized Stan Kroenke for his decision to re-locate the St. Louis Rams to Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2017, some Canadian companies bought local advertising time from Fox affiliates carried in the country, taking advantage of a new regulatory policy that made the Super Bowl available directly from U.S. stations via local television providers for the first time.\n\nIn 2018, rock musician Alice Cooper appeared in a local ad for Desert Financial Credit Union, which played upon his band's song \"School's Out\" to promote its re-branding from Desert Schools Federal Credit Union. Jamie Casino also returned with a new ad. A local Subaru dealer in Muskegon, Michigan ran a simplistic ad containing only of the logos of the dealership, and the message \"Congratulations Patriots!\", despite the fact that the game was won by the Philadelphia Eagles. The dealership admitted that the ad was a \"last minute calculated risk\" and based on odds favoring the team.\n\nA number of Super Bowl commercials have been considered controversial by viewers and critics, or even outright blocked by networks' Standards and Practices departments, because of concerns surrounding their contents. Political advertising and most direct forms of issue-related advertising are usually not aired during the Super Bowl because of equal-time rules or other factors, while the NFL forbids ads for gambling, hard liquor, and banned substances from airing during any of its telecasts.\n\nAt Super Bowl XXXIII, footwear retailer Just For Feet aired its first Super Bowl ad. In the commercial, a barefoot Kenyan runner is tracked by a group of Caucasian men in a Humvee. The runner is offered drug-laced water which knocks him unconscious; when he wakes up, the runner discovers that the men had given him Nike shoes. The runner rejects the shoes and attempts to shake them off whilst running away.\n\nThe ad was widely criticized for its derogatory premise; Bob Garfield described the commercial as being \"neo-colonialist\", \"culturally imperialist\", and \"probably racist\", while Chuck McBride, creative director of Nike's agency Wieden+Kennedy, stated that he \"couldn't believe that they had done this.\" Just For Feet had spent $7 million on the ad, including $1.7 million for the time, and the rest on production and promotional costs. Despite its concerns about its content, Just For Feet relied on the expertise of their hired agency, Saatchi & Saatchi, because they assured that the ad was their best work. Just For Feet CEO Harold Ruttenberg explained to \"Salon\" that \"we took out advertisements. We gave away more than $1 million of product. Then the ad runs. And you would not believe the deluge of comments made about this company. I couldn't sleep for a solid month. And it's all because of these guys who said they knew everything.\"\n\nJust For Feet filed a $10 million lawsuit against Saatchi & Saatchi for malpractice, alleging that the agency was damaging its reputation and goodwill through its \"appallingly unacceptable and shockingly unprofessional performance\", which ran \"contrary to the deepest held principles of Just for Feet, which has always sought to promote racial harmony, finds racism abhorrent, and condemns drug use.\" Just for Feet filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 1999, and the lawsuit was dropped. It was later found that the company had been engaging in accounting fraud.\n\nAt Super Bowl XLI, General Motors aired a 60-second ad entitled \"Robot\", which was meant to promote the powertrain warranty it offered for its vehicles. Themed around an \"obsession\" with quality, the ad depicted an assembly line robot being fired for dropping a screw. After attempting several alternative careers, the robot is depicted committing suicide by rolling off the edge of a bridge into a river. The sequence is interrupted to reveal that the events were just a dream, and that the robot had not been fired at all. Although ranking in ninth place on the Adbowl survey, \"Robot\" received criticism for its glamorization of suicide; the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP) was a notable critic of the spot, as well as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and other suicide prevention groups. The AFSP stated that \"the ad, in its carelessness, portrays suicide as a viable option when someone fails or loses their job.\" Some critics also interpreted the ad's thematics as being in poor taste, as GM had laid off 35,000 factory workers in the previous year.\n\nA GM spokesperson defended the commercial as being \"a story of GM's commitment to quality\", and stated that this was \"the predominant impression by previewers of the ad\". GM pulled the original version of the ad from its YouTube page, and edited the ad to remove the suicide scene from future airings.\n\nAt Super Bowl XLIV, the non-profit evangelical organization Focus on the Family aired an advertisement featuring then-Florida Gators quarterback Tim Tebow and his mother, Pam. Prior to becoming pregnant with Tim, and while serving as Baptist missionaries in the Philippines, Pam had contracted amoebic dysentery and fell into a coma. She discovered she was pregnant while recovering. Because of the medications used to treat her, the fetus experienced a severe placental abruption. Doctors expected a stillbirth and recommended an abortion. The Tebows decided against it, citing their strong faith. In the ad, Pam described Tim as a \"miracle baby\" who \"almost didn't make it into this world\", and remarked that \"with all our family's been through, we have to be tough\"—after which she was tackled by Tim. The ad itself made no reference to abortion or Christianity, and directed viewers to the organization's website.\n\nThe then-unseen ad drew criticism from some women's rights groups, who asked CBS to pull the ad because they felt it would be divisive. Planned Parenthood released a video response of its own featuring fellow NFL player Sean James. The claim that Tebow's family chose not to perform an abortion was also widely criticized; as abortion is illegal in the Philippines, critics felt that it was implausible that a doctor would recommend the procedure in the first place. CBS's decision to run the ad was also criticized for deviating from its past policy of rejecting issue and advocacy-based commercials during the Super Bowl, including those by left leaning or perceived left leaning groups such as PETA, MoveOn.org and the United Church of Christ (which wanted to run an ad that was pro-same-sex marriage). However, CBS stated that \"we have for some time moderated our approach to advocacy submissions after it became apparent that our stance did not reflect public sentiment or industry norms on the issue.\"\n\nAvid Life Media, an operator of online dating services, has had two Super Bowl ads rejected by broadcasters. In 2009, NBC rejected an ad for the extramarital dating site Ashley Madison, which featured the tagline \"Who Are You Doing After the Game?\", from appearing during Super Bowl XLIII. Avid Life Media's CEO Noel Biderman felt the rejection was \"ridiculous\", noting an apparent double standard of allowing advertisements for alcoholic beverages to air during NFL games despite the number of deaths attributed to them. Biderman considered the NFL demographic to be a core audience of the site, and promised to \"find a way to let them know about the existence of this service.\"\n\nThe following year at Super Bowl XLIV, an advertisement for Ashley Madison's sister site ManCrunch—a dating website for homosexual relationships—was rejected by CBS. The ad featured two male football fans reaching into the same bowl of chips, and after a brief pause, passionately kissing and dry humping each other, much to the surprise of another man present. Company spokesperson Elissa Buchter considered the rejection to be discrimination, by contending that CBS would not have objected to the ad had it featured a kiss between a man and a woman, and acknowledging the frequent airplay of advertisements for erectile dysfunction medications on U.S. television as a double standard. Fellow spokesperson Dominic Friesen stated that the company was \"very disappointed\" of CBS's decision, noting that the network had allowed the aforementioned Focus on the Family ad to air during the game. A \"New York Post\" writer felt that their ad was \"no more racy than nearly any beer commercial not starring the Budweiser Clydesdales\".\n\nAvid Life was also accused of ambush marketing by critics, who argued that the company was intentionally submitting ads that would get rejected by broadcasters and receive free publicity from the ensuing controversy, thus removing the need to actually buy ad time during the game. However, the company denied these claims, and indicated that it did have serious intentions to purchase ad time during the game if its commercials were accepted. In an article posted following the 2015 security breach of Ashley Madison, a former CBS standards & practices employee stated that the ManCrunch ad had actually been rejected for its use of NFL trademarks, and not because of its content.\n\nAnimal rights activist organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, known for its salacious and shocking publicity stunts, has routinely submitted Super Bowl ads that have been rejected. Most of the advertisements have been explicitly sexual in nature. In 2018, PETA submitted a blasphemous advertisement instead, with a priest (portrayed by James Cromwell) telling a meat industry executive that he could not be forgiven for the sins of what PETA claimed were deceptive advertisements, even if he confessed. NBC expressed willingness to air the 2018 advertisement on the condition that the organization would buy additional ads during the 2018 Winter Olympics, which would have doubled the price; PETA refused and accused the network of price gouging.\n\nIn 2012, Randall Terry attempted to use a provision in Federal Communications Commission policies requiring \"reasonable access\" to local advertising time for political candidates within 45 days of an election or primary, to force several NBC stations to air a graphic anti-abortion attack ad during Super Bowl XLVI that featured images of blood-covered fetuses. Following a complaint by the Chicago-based NBC-owned station WMAQ, the FCC ruled that Terry could not expect reasonable access to advertising time during the Super Bowl because of the magnitude of the event and the limited amount of local advertising time available. Furthermore, it was also found that Terry did not show enough evidence that he was a \"bona fide\" candidate eligible to receive ad time in the first place.\n\nChrysler's Super Bowl XLVI ad \"Halftime in America\" was controversial due to its political overtones, especially as it came during the lead-up to the 2012 U.S. presidential election. Critics interpreted the ad as being in support of re-electing Barack Obama, suggesting that the metaphor of \"halftime in America\" symbolized the performance of Obama's first four-year term as president going into his re-election campaign, and noting Obama had supported George W. Bush's bailout of Chrysler whilst acting as a Democratic senator. It was also noted that Eastwood had made statements against the bailouts in 2011, had stated that he \"couldn’t recall ever voting for a Democratic presidential candidate\", and that he was a supporter of Republican candidate John McCain during the 2008 campaign. Eastwood would later appear as a surprise guest at the 2012 Republican National Convention in support of nominee Mitt Romney, addressing an empty chair meant to represent Obama.\n\nIn 2013, SodaStream submitted a Super Bowl advertisement directed by Alex Bogusky, which featured a pair of Coca-Cola and Pepsi deliverymen finding their bottles exploding and disappearing when another person uses the SodaStream to make their own beverages; representing a disruption of the soft drink market. The ad was rejected by CBS for its direct attacks towards the two rival companies. A \"Forbes\" writer expressed concern that the network may have had intentionally shown protectionism towards the two soft drink companies (who have been long-time Super Bowl advertisers), and drew comparisons to a recent incident where the CBS-owned technology news site CNET was controversially forced by its parent company to block Dish Network's Hopper with Sling digital video recorder from being considered Best in Show at CES 2013 because the broadcaster was in active litigation over an automatic commercial skipping feature on the device.\n\nAn older SodaStream commercial was shown in its place, which also featured exploding pop bottles in a similar fashion, but with no direct references to any other brand; ironically, this particular ad had been banned in the United Kingdom by Clearcast for being considered \"a denigration of the bottled drinks market.\"\n\nAnother SodaStream ad featuring Scarlett Johansson was produced for and aired during Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014; the supposed rejection of an initial version for containing the line \"Sorry, Coke and Pepsi\" was overshadowed by growing controversies around the company's use of a factory that was located in an Israeli settlement on the West Bank.\n\nIn 2014, Coca-Cola aired a Super Bowl advertisement entitled \"It's Beautiful\"; themed around multiculturalism, the ad featured scenes depicting Americans of various ethnicities, along with a same-sex couple—the first to ever appear in a Super Bowl ad, set to a rendition of the patriotic hymn \"America The Beautiful\" with lyrics sung in multiple languages.\n\nThe ad was divisive, with users taking to Twitter under the hashtag \"#SpeakAmerican\" to discuss their views and opinions on its content: those against the ad argued that per the melting pot principle, Coca-Cola should not have used languages other than English, the most common language of the country, to promote its products to ethnic minorities, and former Republican Congressman Allen West stated that \"If we cannot be proud enough as a country to sing 'America the Beautiful' in English in a commercial during the Super Bowl, by a company as American as they come—doggone we are on the road to perdition.\" By contrast, others praised the ad for celebrating the diversity of American people. \"Guardian\" writer Jill Filipovic noted that the company had been increasingly targeting minorities, such as Latino Americans (who are more likely to be heavy drinkers of soft drinks because of their low cost) and drew comparisons to the marketing of cigarettes to women, but that \"before we applaud Coke's advertising diversity, we should ask: do we really want Coke to diversify?\"\n\nThe commercial was re-aired prior to kickoff at Super Bowl LI, eliciting similar criticism.\n\nAt Super Bowl XLIX in 2015, after an eight-year hiatus, Nationwide Insurance returned to the game with two new advertisements. The second of these advertisements, \"Boy\" (also commonly referred to as \"Make Safe Happen\"), featured a child explaining that he couldn't grow up because he had already died—followed by scenes of an overflowing bathtub (implying drowning), spilled cleaning products (implying poisoning), and a television having fallen off of a wall. The ad was intended to promote Nationwide's child protection campaign \"Make Safe Happen\"; operated in partnership with Safe Kids USA and Nationwide Children's Hospital, it aims to draw awareness to deaths caused by preventable household accidents.\n\nViewers and critics acknowledged that the subject matter of \"Boy\" was a major contrast to other, upbeat and comedic ads broadcast during Super Bowl XLIX (including Nationwide's second ad, \"Invisible Mindy\"). Reception towards the ad was overwhelmingly negative; viewers criticized the company via social media for its decision to broadcast an ad dealing with such subject matter during the Super Bowl, Amobee estimated only 12% of reactions to the ad on Twitter were positive, and it ranked near the bottom of the \"USA Today\" Ad Meter results. Nationwide CMO Matthew Jauchius defended the ad, noting that the negative response was \"a little stronger than we anticipated\", and that \"Boy\" was intended to \"begin a dialogue to make safe happen for children everywhere.\" Jauchius later exited Nationwide two months after the advertisement aired.\n\nBuilding supply company 84 Lumber debuted at Super Bowl LI with \"The Journey\"; the ad depicted a mother and daughter migrating from Mexico to the United States border, only to discover that a wall had been built on it. However, after the daughter presented a handmade version of the U.S. flag that she had made with pieces of fabric collected along the way, the two discover a giant door in the wall. The ending of the ad is accompanied by the tagline \"The will to succeed is always welcome here.\"\n\nThe original version of the ad was rejected by Fox, as they believed that the border wall imagery was too politically sensitive in the wake of Donald Trump's presidency, as his campaign promises included a plan to build a wall across the entire southern border. The company's agency stated that it intended to present an edited version of the ad during the game, and promote the full, nearly 6-minute ad, streaming on 84 Lumber's website. The company reported that its website received a total of over 6 million visits in the hour following the airing, and received over 300,000 requests in a minute after the ad aired, causing it to crash.\n\nOn January 31, 2017, it was reported that an advertisement for the health store chain GNC had been rejected by the NFL for broadcast during Super Bowl LI. The ad had been rejected due to the company's inclusion on a list of \"prohibited companies\" issued by the NFL Players Association; a small number of GNC's products contain DHEA and Synephrine, which are performance-enhancing substances banned by the NFL. Inclusion on this list prohibits NFL players from promoting or endorsing the company. NFL policies do not allow advertising for “dietary or nutritional supplements that contain ingredients other than vitamins and minerals, energy drinks, or any prohibited substance”. Advertisements for health stores are not banned, provided that they do not reference such products. GNC's advertisement featured motivational themes as part of a larger \"Courage to Change\" marketing campaign, and did not make any references to specific products sold by the chain.\n\nOn February 2, 2017, it was reported that GNC had threatened to sue Fox over the rejection. The letter of intent stated that the contents of GNC's commercial had been \"expressly approved\" twice by Fox, and that the broadcaster did not inform GNC that ads broadcast during the Super Bowl were subject to approval by the NFL or any league policies. The company stated that Fox had \"induced GNC to spend millions of dollars in production costs and in the development of a national, coordinated marketing and rebranding campaign centered around this advertisement.\"\n\nIn 2018 at Super Bowl LII, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles marque Ram Trucks aired a commercial entitled \"Built to Serve\", as one of two Ram ads during the game. It featured an extract from the \"Drum Major Instinct\" sermon given by Martin Luther King Jr. on February 4, 1968 (exactly 50 years prior), wherein King explained the virtues of serving others. The speech was, in turn, set to footage of people using their Ram vehicles to help others.\n\nThe ad was largely criticized, as viewers considered it to be in bad taste for FCA to use the words of MLK to promote a product. It was also pointed out that, ironically, King had made comments criticizing the advertising industry during the same sermon. He described advertisers as being \"gentlemen of massive verbal persuasion\", explaining that \"in order to be a man of distinction, you must drink this whiskey. In order to make your neighbors envious, you must drive this type of car. In order to be lovely to love you must wear this kind of lipstick or this kind of perfume. And you know, before you know it, you're just buying that stuff.\" William B. Wachtel, co-founder of the Drum Major Institute, stated that \"In a twist of irony, one of the specific evils Dr. King condemned was the exploitation of the drum major instinct by advertisers, particularly car advertisers\". \"Current Affairs\" posted an edited version of the commercial on YouTube, overdubbed with this section of the speech.\n\nUse of the speech was approved by Intellectual Properties Management, the exclusive commercial licensor of King's estate. A representative of the organization stated that they approved the ad because its overall message \"embodied Dr. King's philosophy that true greatness is achieved by serving others.\" Although the King Center distanced itself from the ad by stating that it was not responsible for its licensing, it was pointed out that Intellectual Properties Management was based within the facilities of the King Center to begin with, and thus had close ties to the family. \"Los Angeles Times\" columnist Michael Hiltzik argued that King's rights should be managed by a larger group of historians and scholars through an \"open and transparent\" process, rather than just his close family, \"so at least we don't have a situation where some corporation drapes itself in King's preacherly robes while the estate issues fatuous excuses that a TV commercial embodies 'Dr. King's philosophy'.\"\n\nThe Super Bowl commercials are generally limited to the American television broadcast of the game. This prevents international viewers from watching the game with these often iconic commercials. Online postings of the commercials on sites such as YouTube have partially alleviated the issue, while NBC posted the Super Bowl XLIX commercials on a Tumblr blog as they aired during the game for the benefit of its U.S. online stream (which did not contain all of the same ads as the television feed).\n\nComplaints about the U.S. Super Bowl ads are common in Canada; although U.S. network affiliates are widely available on pay television providers in the country, \"simultaneous substitution\" regulations give Canadian television networks the right to request that a U.S. feed of a program be replaced with its Canadian counterpart on these providers if it is airing a program in simulcast with a U.S. network. This rule is intended to protect the investments of Canadian broadcasters in exclusive domestic broadcast rights, and also protect Canadian advertisers who had purchased their own advertising time on the Canadian network. As a result, most American Super Bowl ads are effectively \"blacked out\" by the Canadian broadcaster. Members of Parliament Bob Nault and Wayne Easter have stated that the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), Canada's telecom regulator, has only received around 100 specific complaints about Super Bowl ads in relation to the simsub rules.\n\nSome U.S.-based advertisers, particularly PepsiCo and Anheuser-Busch (via its Canadian subsidiary Labatt), do buy ad time during the Canadian broadcast on CTV, owned by Bell Media—the broadcasting subsidiary of Canadian telecommunications firm BCE and the current rightsholder of the game, to air at least some of their American commercials, but many Canadian advertisers simply re-air ads from their regular rotation, or air the same ad multiple times over the course of the game, neither of which is typical during the U.S. network broadcast. Reasons cited by Canadian advertisers for these practices include the additional talent and post-production fees that would be required to broadcast the American ads in Canada, and the perceived lower \"cultural resonance\" of the game for Canadian viewers as opposed to Americans. As such, and because Canada's population is approximately a tenth of the United States', advertising time costs a fraction of the price to air an ad on the U.S. broadcast: prices ranged between $170,000 to $200,000 for a 30-second slot on CTV's telecast of Super Bowl XLIX.\n\nOn the other hand, in the 2010s, there were a growing number of Super Bowl ads produced specifically for the Canadian broadcast: Hyundai's Canadian subsidiary began airing its own Super Bowl ads in 2010, and Budweiser produced the hockey-themed \"Flash Fans\" to air during the Canadian broadcast of Super Bowl XLVI. The following year, two Canadian companies—BlackBerry and Gildan Activewear, made their debut as U.S. Super Bowl advertisers; their ads were also broadcast in Canada alongside those by McDonald's Canada, who debuted its \"Our Food. Your Questions.\" campaign, Budweiser's internet-connected hockey goal lights, and Hyundai Canada's \"Gaspocalypse\", promoting the Sonata Hybrid. Budweiser expanded its goal light campaign for Super Bowl 50, which featured an ad introducing a -tall goal lamp used as part of a promotional campaign leading towards the 2016 World Cup of Hockey.\n\nOn January 29, 2015, the CRTC announced a proposal to forbid the invocation of simultaneous substitution on the Super Bowl telecast, thus allowing U.S. feeds of the event to co-exist with those of Canadian rightsholders on pay television providers. The decision came as a result of a series of hearings held by the CRTC known as \"Let's Talk TV\", which explored reforms of the Canadian television industry: the Commission cited viewer frustration over the use of simsubs, especially surrounding the Super Bowl, and argued that the commercials were an \"integral part\" of the game due to their cultural significance. In March 2015, Bell filed an appeal against this decision, arguing that the move would devalue its exclusive broadcast rights to the game, and violated the Broadcasting Act, which forbids the \"making of regulations singling out a particular program or licensee.\" A report commissioned by Bell estimated that without this lucrative exclusivity, it would lose about US$13.6 million per-year.\n\nIn spite of the complaints and legal action, the CRTC issued an order on August 19, 2016 that officially implemented the new rule. On September 6, 2016, the Federal Court of Appeal dismissed Bell Media's lawsuit for being premature, because it was filed before the CRTC had formally implemented the rules. On November 2, 2016, Bell was granted an appeal. In the lead-up to Super Bowl LI (which would be the first game to fall under this policy), a number of stakeholders, including the NFL, Bell Media, local unions. as well as politicians from both Canada and the U.S., called upon the CRTC to reverse the ruling. U.S. senators Marco Rubio and Ron Johnson wrote to an ambassador that the CRTC's decision \"sends a troubling signal about the value Canada places on its largest trading partner, best customer and close friend.\" Bell had also urged prime minister Justin Trudeau to invoke section 26(2) of the Broadcasting Act (which grants the government power to require the broadcasting of programming that is \"of urgent importance to Canadians\", and had only been invoked once before to mandate the broadcast of a major speech by a Prime Minister) to override the CRTC policy and still require that the Super Bowl LI telecast be subject to simsub.\n\nCourt action on the CRTC ruling was not taken in time for the game, meaning that Super Bowl LI was the first to be available through Canadian television providers without being subject to simsub. Some Canadian advertisers, such as Leon's and Pizza Pizza, took advantage of the decision by purchasing local ad time from U.S. Fox affiliates carried in Canada, to broadcast commercials aimed at the Canadian audience. The sales manager of Spokane's affiliate KAYU-TV praised the change for helping increase demand for its limited local inventory; the station is carried on cable in the significantly larger Canadian markets of Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nNeither Nielsen or Numeris (Canada's main television ratings provider) calculate Canadian viewership of U.S. television channels, so it is unknown exactly how many Canadian viewers watched the game directly from Fox stations rather than CTV. Following the game, it was reported that viewership of Super Bowl LI on CTV, in addition to CTV Two and TSN (which simulcast the game in order to increase the saturation of Bell-owned properties carrying it, and offered an on-air sweepstakes as a publicity stunt to attract viewers), was down by 39% over Super Bowl 50.\n\nOn December 19, 2017, the Federal Court of Appeal dismissed Bell Media's case, ruling that the CRTC's policy was reasonable. Bell Media once again filed for an appeal in January 2018, this time in the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nOn October 1, 2018, Canada agreed to the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement. Annex 15-D would require Canada to, in simsub regulations, \"not accord [a] program treatment less favorable than the treatment accorded to other programs originating in the United States retransmitted in Canada\", and specifically ordered that the CRTC policies implementing this simsub ban be rescinded.\n"}

The books were adapted for television (Joop Doderer playing the title role), in a series of shows which aired on NCRV in the 1960s and 1970s, one of the longest-running and most popular shows in Dutch TV history.\n\nThe character Swiebertje is a tramp, and is supposed to be inspired by a drawing by Tjeerd Bottema. He is a \"lovable vagabond\", and his character as well as the TV show \"present a comforting image of a simple rural past\". His wanderings, during which he typically got in trouble but always found a happy ending, evoked romanticism and adventure. The \"innocent\" show was the second-most popular show among children in 1966; the most popular was the more adult program \"Bonanza\".\n\nRegular characters included, besides Swiebertje, the police officer Bromsnor (Lou Geels), housekeeper Saartje (Riek Schagen), and shopkeeper Malle Pietje (Piet Ekel).\n\nOn TV, he was played by Joop Doderer, who became so identified with the part that the Dutch expression for the most extreme form of typecasting, where an actor is identified with just one single character, is called the \"Swiebertje-effect\". Oudewater has a Swiebertje statue. Doderer played Swiebertje for seventeen years and grew to dislike the character. After the show had run its course, in 1975, he was unable to find serious roles because he was so much identified with Swiebertje; he left for England, where playing roles in high-quality television drama proved a relief. He returned to the Netherlands, and to the stage, and later made peace with the character, saying that Swiebertje derived its popularity from his everyman-qualities.\n\nThe TV series was adapted into a comic strip by Gerrit Stapel. \n"}
{"id": "42093997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42093997", "title": "The Mistress of the World", "text": "The Mistress of the World\n\nThe Mistress of the World () is an eight-part 1919 silent film made in the Weimar Republic starring Mia May in the lead role. The film, under the creative control of director Joe May, is noted for bringing together talent from across German cinema, including many who would work behind the camera during the emergence of German Expressionist cinema.\n\nThe story follows a young Danish woman on her globe-trotting adventures to find the legendary lost treasure of the Queen of Sheba that she hopes will enable her to bring revenge on the man that drew her father to commit suicide and led to her own social destruction. The first film was released in Germany on 5 December 1919, and this was followed each week by the release of the subsequent episodes.\n\nYoung Danish adventuress Maud Gregaards (Mia May) answers an advertisement to take up a position as a governess in China. There, she falls victim to the white slave-trade and is placed in a brothel. She is freed by her travel companion, Dr. Kien-Lung (Henry Sze), but the physician is then kidnapped by the devilish Hai-Fung, who also captures and tortures Maud. Chinese consul Madsen (Michael Bohnen) releases both Dr. Kein-Lung and Maud from the clutches of Hai-Fung. It is later revealed that Maud is harbouring a secret plot of revenge that brought her to China. Maud decides to tell her two trusted companions what that secret is.\n\nThe second part of this film is a prequel to the first part. Maud explains to her companions why she travelled to China. Maud's father was an archivist at the Foreign Office in Denmark. There he was blackmailed to hand over a Chinese secret agreement. Unable either to face the blackmailers or to betray his country, he commits suicide. Maud later falls in love with Baron Murphy (Hans Mierendorff) for whom she works as a translator, and they become engaged. Unknowingly, Maud translates the Chinese document for the Baron, after which he takes the secret and flees the country, leaving Maud to be arrested as a spy. In jail, Maud gives birth to the Baron's child but the baby dies in prison. On being released from jail, Maud comes into the possession of information about the rabbi of Kuan-Fu, who is said to have knowledge of the hidden treasure of the Queen of Sheba. She decides to travel to China to find the treasure which she hopes will allow her to take revenge on her former lover.\n\nMaud Gregaards, Kien-Lung and Consul Madsen travel together to find the rabbi of Kuan-Fu, the last surviving member of an ancient Jewish settlement in Canton, who is said to be in possession of the secret to the fabled treasure of the Queen of Sheba. The three companions enter the ancient ruins where the rabbi is believed to live, watched suspiciously by the local natives. On finding the old rabbi, Madsen reveals that he is Jewish and gains the trust of the holy man. They are entrusted with the Gem of Astarte, which was once given to King Solomon by the Queen of Sheba, and within it the map to the treasure. Before he can reveal any further information the rabbi dies. On leaving the ruins Madsen is injured fighting with the natives, and is abandoned by Kien-Lung; the Gem of Astarte is briefly lost in the same encounter. As Madsen meets back up with Kien-Lung, a fight breaks out between the two men, only Maud's intervention separates the two.\n\nMaud, along with, Madsen and Kien-Lung, adventure into Central Africa, to search for the biblical city of Ophir where the treasure lies. There they enter the realm of King Makombe, at the heart of the Cult of Astarte. The tribe's Medicine Man (Louis Brody) steals the Gem of Astarte to appease the natives against the invaders. Maud, Madsen and Dr. Kien-Lung flee but during the escape Kien-Lung is struck by a poisoned arrow and dies. Maud and Madsen find shelter in a cave, where they are hidden from their pursuers. In the final scene, Maud and Madsen reach the gates of Ophir.\n\nMaud and Madsen eventually find the City of Ophir, but are discovered in the treasury of the Queen of Sheba and are captured as intruders. Maud is to be sacrificed because she had desecrated the sacred ground of the city. Madsen is sent to the slave city of Sabyten, where he is to suffer life as a slave. As Maud is laid on the sacrificial altar, the high priest sees she wears the necklace of Astarte, and Maud is declared as the reincarnation of the goddess, whose return had been predicted. Madsen escapes from captivity with the help of an American engineer, Allan Stanley (Paul Hansen), whom he met in the slave city, and returns to rescue Maud. The three find the treasure and manage to telegraph the outside world for help. An American expedition hears their plea and sends a plane to rescue all three, but Madsen is killed in the escape. As they fly from the city an earthquake leaves the mysterious City of Ophir in ruins.\n\nMaud Gregaards, now incredibly rich, seeks out a new life, and under the name Maud Fergusson, settles in the United States. The American newspaper publisher, Fletcher, who sent the rescuing aircraft to Ophir, turns her story into headline news, making Maud a celebrity. This story is attacked by a rival newspaper, \"Harrison's Universe\", run by Hannibal Harrison (Wilhelm Diegelmann), declaring the whole adventure a fantasy. Both tabloids are reduced to a war over Maud, while a theater agent, Karpeles (Paul Morgan), makes a film about Maud's adventure. Although little more than fabrication, the movie makes her a superstar. Meanwhile, Maud and Allan fall in love and leave for Europe.\n\nThe billionaire Maud Fergusson, attempts to start a new life with Allan Stanley. The wealth gained from the Queen of Sheba's treasure allows the \"Mistress of the World\" to live a carefree life in Denmark and the two plan to marry. Stanley insists that before they marry that Maud tells him the name of the man who is responsible for all her misfortunes. Maud, however, has put her past behind her and just wants to find peace. She plans to become a benefactor of mankind, sponsoring research and technology projects with their billions. Allan, meanwhile, develops a remote fusion machine that can melt metal. Since guns can be destroyed with this powerful invention, he soon falls into the sights of ruthless weapon manufacturers that want to stop its production. On the day of the invention's first public demonstration, there is a huge explosion, caused by Maud's nemesis Baron Murphy. Allan is killed in the explosion.\n\nThe death of Allan, shortly before their wedding, sends Maud on a quest for bloody revenge. Helped by a detective, Hunt, (Rudolf Lettinger), Maud discovers that Baron Murphy is behind her fiancé's death and sparks a newspaper campaign against the Baron to expose him. Murphy loses his entire fortune and is forced to leave the country and dies while desperately battling through a snowstorm. Hunt also discovers that a young academic Credo Merville (Ernst Hofmann) is Murphy and Maud's son, who is supposed to have died shortly after his birth. In the end, mother and son fall into each other's arms.\n\nAustrian film producer Joe May conceived the idea for filming \"The Mistress of the World\", which he loosely based on the novel \"Die Herrin der Welt\" by author Karl Figdor, in early 1919. May produced \"The Mistress of the World\" as a serial film, which Carjels argues was more influenced by the French serials of the time rather than the American 'cliff-hanger' serials. Whereas the popular American serials were filmed over two reels, making them short openers to a feature film, each part of \"The Mistress of the World\" was shot over six reels, making them feature length. Another difference to the American serials was the lack of a cliffhanger ending. Each episode of \"Mistress\" was a self-contained story, but the end goal was still out of reach, drawing audiences back to find out how the story resolved rather than how the heroine escaped a dangerous situation.\n\nNormal prerelease hype for serials was often manufactured through movie tie-ins, serialization in other media and spot prizes given to audience members. May attempted a different approach for \"The Mistress of the World\", which at first appeared to be meager in comparison. He instead released a steady stream of information regarding the production of the film, which included stories around the film's stars, the set design and the process of making the film. This in turn led to massive audience anticipation, making \"The Mistress of the World\" one of the first \"Monumentalfilm\", and this promotional technique was embraced by other productions that followed. May continued to feed the entertainment journals with facts from the film in the run up to its release, in an attempt to promote the enormity of the film: a 2,000 page script, 200 days of exterior filming and 150 days of interior filming. A set was created at Woltersdorf in Germany where a crew of 30,000 people fed by 100 cooks were utilised over the entire shoot and by the end of the production the film had cost six million Marks. This steady stream of figures resulted in the series being described as \"a completely new film experience\", and even without the story being unveiled May had given \"The Mistress of the World\" a feeling of importance and gravitas.\n\n\n\nAs well as starring many stars of Weimar cinema, \"The Mistress of the World\" is also notable for bringing together many of the most important writers and production and set designers of early German Expressionism. Of note in parts II and III, acting as Assistant director, was Fritz Lang, who also acted as a script writer in part VIII. Working in the role of set and production design were Otto Hunte, Martin Jacoby-Boy, Erich Kettelhut and Karl Vollbrecht, all of whom would work in the years following with Lang on many of his iconic German films setting the tone of German Expressionist films in such classics as \"Dr. Mabuse the Gambler\" (1922), \"Die Nibelungen\" (1924) and \"Metropolis\" (1926).\n\nThe first part of \"The Mistress of the World\" was premiered on 5 December 1919 at the Tauentzienpalast in Berlin, along with other high-end cinemas. The Tauentzienpalast was redecorated for the premier and the audience found themselves surrounded by tropical trees and bushes in an attempt to transport them to the exotic world of the film. Men dressed in Chinese servant uniforms handed out souvenirs, and large tapestries hung from the walls.\n\nInitial reviews to the film were very positive. \"Die illustrierte Filmwoche\" noted how no other film had created such anticipation and disappointed so little. \"Die Kinematograph\" saw it as a masterpiece of German film-making skill, while \"Der Film\" believed that \"it will win over foreign markets\". The more independent cultural publications were less positive, \"Berliner Börsen-Courier\" wrote that the serial did not rise above the average feature and that it lacked a sense of greatness, strength and depth. George Gottholt, writing in the \"Freie Deutsche Bühne\", was very negative in his views, stating \"This film, and others like, it have a vulgarizing effect on the taste and a dumbing-down effect on the intellect of its audience.\" Carjels compares \"The Mistress of the World\" to a modern globe-trotting adventure story more akin to an Indiana Jones or Lara Croft film, rather than a more intellect take such as \"Madame Dubarry\".\n\nAlthough receiving mixed reviews, the public responded positively and \"The Mistress of the World\" was the most commercially successful German film of the 1919-1920 season, outstripping \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" (1920) in popular appeal.\n\n\"The Mistress of the World\" was released in the United States in 1922 by Paramount Pictures but was shortened and re-edited into four films, spanning twenty reels, the result of which was that half of the eight films were removed. The four films were titled: Number 1. \"The Dragon's Claw\", Number 2. \"The Race for Life\", Number 3. \"The City of Gold\" and Number 4. \"Saved by Wireless\". According to Robert Kane, who oversaw the editing process for Paramount, it took four months to recut and give the film a more 'American Tempo'. The Paramount series only followed the events of the original story up until the end of part 5, not following the heroine's return to New York and her ultimate revenge.\n\nWhereas the original series of films were intended to be a mix of adventure, melodrama and comedy, the American edit was created to concentrate on the action. This was reflected in the promotional campaign with 11 of the 13 posters offered to the exhibitors, showing fight scenes or daredevil acts, similar to those used in American serials.\n\nIn 1960 CCC Films released a two part \"Mistress of the World\" feature film directed by William Dieterle starring Martha Hyer as Karin Fergusson.\n\n\n"}
