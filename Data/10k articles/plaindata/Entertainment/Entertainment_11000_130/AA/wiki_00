As mandated by the Commonwealth Games Charter, the proceedings of the ceremony combined the formal opening of the sporting event (including hoisting of the flags, parade of the athletes and welcome speeches) with an artistic performance to showcase the host nation's culture. The 2018 Games were formally opened by Charles, Prince of Wales. Jack Morton Worldwide was given the contract to produce the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2018 Commonwealth Games. The theme of the opening ceremony was Hello Earth and directed by David Zolkwer. \n\nThe ceremony began at 20:00 AEST and lasted almost three hours. It was watched by an estimated worldwide television of 1.5 billion. The principal sections of the artistic display represented Australia's Indigenous culture, Gold Coast's Surfers Paradise, wildlife and theme parks. A medley of Australian classics were played live by the Queensland Symphony Orchestra, Queensland Youth Orchestra and Gold Coast Youth Orchestra during the parade of nations. Popular Australian recording artists such as Christine Anu, Delta Goodrem, Katie Noonan and Ricki-Lee Coutler performed at the ceremony. The opening ceremony was seen as a tremendous success and worldwide praised. \n\nThree Australian companies: Specktak International, World Events, Dae Global and one American company Jack Morton Worldwide (JMW) submitted bids to the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games Corporation (GOLDOC) to produce the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast. On 27 December 2015, the GOLDOC announced they chose Jack Morton Worldwide to produce the ceremonies of the games. This sparked a controversy as the head of all the three Australian Companies Ric Birch, head of Spectak, David Atkins, head of Dae Global and Julie Brooks, head of World Events questioned to GOLDOC that why an American company (JMW) was chosen for the production of ceremonies which was going to happen in Australia. Ric Birch, who co-ordinated the ceremonies of the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, called for a review of the decision to overlook three Australian companies to present the ceremonies at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast. GOLDOC's head of communications Marcus Taylor said that JMW is an international company which have been working in Australia since 1983 and have a range of experiences in producing the ceremonies of events as they have previously done for 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne and the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. \n\nOn 22 November 2017, the GOLDOC revealed some of the key artistic personnel working on the ceremonies of the games. The creative team for the opening and closing ceremonies consisted of a roster of renowned individuals. Leading the ceremonies team as Artistic Director and Project Director was David Zolkwer, Head of Jack Morton Worldwide Public Events. David previously led the teams for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne and 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Australian singer Katie Noonan, winner of five ARIA music awards and former lead singer of Brisbane based band George, was given the role of the Music Director of the ceremonies. Katie said \"I'm a fiercely proud Queensland musician; I think we make some of the best music in the world and indeed some of the best art in the world. There's some truly world class dance and music being made here, so it's a good time to focus on our (cultural) identity and realise that we're really good at what we do.\" She has served as the Artistic Director of the Queensland Music Festival since 2015.\n\nNathan M. Wright served as the Head of Choreography and Staging Director for the opening ceremony. Nathan is a highly respected choreographer and performer who has worked on large-scale events extensively, including choreography for the opening and closing ceremonies of both the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics in London and the opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The role of Executive Producer for the ceremonies was given to Merryn Hughes. Merryn has also served as the Executive Producer for the ceremonies of the 2015 Pacific Games in Papua New Guinea and the closing ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.

Further she added that the games were the largest fully inclusive para-sport medal events programme ever at a Commonwealth Games; the largest at any international sports event.\nThe Queen's baton, which contained the message letter written by Queen Elizabeth II at the Buckingham Palace in London, was brought into the stadium in the kombi van by Australian former swimmer Susie O’Neill . She then went to the centre of the stadium. Images and videos of popular Gold Coast attractions were projected on the ground of the stadium such as feeding lorikeets, skydiving, dreaming in the ocean, walking in the treetops, and riding the rollercoaster.

It was released on August 4, 2006. The film stars the voices of Kevin James, Courteney Cox, Sam Elliott, Danny Glover, Wanda Sykes, Andie MacDowell and David Koechner. Most of the production was carried out in San Clemente, California.\n\n\"Barnyard\" grossed $116.5 million worldwide against a $51 million production budget and spawned a television series, titled \"Back at the Barnyard\", which ran for two seasons between 2007 and 2011.\n\nOtis (Kevin James) is a carefree young cow who prefers playing with his friends rather than accept responsibility. His strict father Ben (Sam Elliott) is the leader of the barnyard. After Otis interrupts a barnyard meeting with his wild antics, Ben has a talk with his son, warning him that he will never be happy if he spends his life partying without acting more maturely. Otis ignores his advice and leaves to have fun with his friends Pip the Mouse (Jeff Garcia), Pig the Pig (Tino Insana), Freddy the Ferret (Cam Clarke), and Peck the Rooster (Rob Paulsen). That same day, Otis meets a pregnant cow named Daisy (Courtney Cox), who is accompanied by her friend, Bessy (Wanda Sykes).\n\nThat night, the animals throw a party in the barn. All the animals at the barnyard are there except Ben, who guards the fence line. Otis is assigned a shift along with Ben, but Otis talks himself out of work. Before Otis leaves, Ben tells him that the night he found him as a baby calf stumbling alone in the meadow, he swore he saw the stars dance, thus giving him reason to know his place was at the farm. Later, Ben takes on a pack of coyotes led by Dag (David Koechner), plundering the chicken coop. He manages to fight off the pack until he is bitten on the leg by the red coyote, making him fall. The Coyotes pile on Ben, but he manages to grab Dag and escapes the pile. He threatens to punch Dag but lets him go, scaring away him and the coyotes. Ben falls on the ground, exhausted. Otis is alerted and he runs outside to his father. Ben dies and is buried on a hill by the farmer (Fred Tatasciore), and the other animals mourn Ben after the farmer leaves.\n\nAfter Ben's death, all the animals elect Otis as the new leader of the barnyard. Otis shirks his duties by leaving Freddy and Peck in charge of the coop, then helps the trouble-making Jersey Cows Eddy, Igg, and Bud (S. Scott Bullock, John DiMaggio, and Maurice LaMarche) teach a lesson to a mean fat youngster called Snotty Boy (Steve Oedekerk) for cow-tipping, eluding the police along the way. Later that night, when Otis is holding Daisy's hoof under the starlight, he overhears the coyotes chasing a rabbit and leaves Daisy to pursue the coyotes and avenge his father. Otis tries to attack Dag and his pack, but is outnumbered. Since Otis is weaker, Dag proposes a deal: he and his pack will take various barnyard animals at random times and that, if Otis tries to stand up to them, they will slaughter everyone at the barnyard. Otis decides to leave the barnyard, realizing that his chances of victory are slim.\n\nThe next morning, before leaving, Otis is informed that the Coyotes took some hens including Maddy (Madeline Lovejoy), a little chick who is one of Otis' friends. Otis realizes that he has been fooled by Dag, as he was not expecting him and the coyotes until tonight, and sets off to rescue the chickens. Otis confronts the pack but is easily defeated after Dag bites him in the leg; however, Pip, Pig, Freddy, Peck, Miles (Danny Glover), Ben's old friend, and the Jersey Cows arrive to help Otis. Dag tries to attack Otis from behind, but Otis is alerted when Peck successfully manages to crow a warning. Otis catches Dag and warns him to never return to the barnyard. Otis then swings Dag out of the junkyard with a golf club, finally avenging his father's death.\n\nAfter hijacking a biker gang's motorcycles from the diner, Otis and the rest make it back to the barn to witness Daisy giving birth to a calf that she names Li'l Ben. Otis then takes full responsibility and becomes the new leader of the barnyard as he watches the stars of himself, Daisy and Lil' Ben dance just like Ben said. Mrs. Beady gets ready for bed, but she noticed that Wild Mike is on top of her head.\n\n\n\"Barnyard\" was released in theaters on August 4, 2006 by Paramount Pictures. \n\n\"Barnyard\" was released on widescreen DVD on December 12, 2006, and includes the alternate opening. As of now, the film or its series has yet to be released on blu-ray.\n\nThe film has an approval rating of 22% at Rotten Tomatoes based on 97 reviews and an average rating of 4.4/10. The site's consensus says, \"Unimaginative and unfunny, this tale of barnyard mischief borders on 'udder' creepiness and adds little to this summer's repertoire of animated films.\" On Metacritic, it has a score of 42 out of 100, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nRoger Moore of the \"Orlando Sentinel\" gave the film 2 stars out of 5, saying that, \"with \"Barnyard\", another quick-and-dirty 'all-star cast' mess churned out by the digital start-ups hired to steal some of Pixar's cash, the year that computer-generated animation 'jumps the shark' becomes official. Politically correct, anatomically incorrect and ugly to look at, the only thing that saves \"Barnyard\" is a writer (and director) Steve Oedekerk's gift for gags and almost-edgy humor.\" Kyle Smith of the \"New York Post\" gave the film a score of 1.5/4, saying that \"if you want to punish your kids, send them to bed without dinner. If you want to disturb, frighten and depress them while making sure they fail biology, take them to the animated feature \"Barnyard\".\" Gregory Kirschling of \"Entertainment Weekly\" criticized the film's plot, giving it a C+ score and said that \"it feels like \"Barnyard\" swipes too much of its plot from \"The Lion King\".\" \n\nOn the positive side, J. R. Jones of the \"Chicago Reader\" enjoyed \"Barnyard\", saying that \"it's way funnier than many of the R-rated comedies I've seen lately, though Oedekerk seems to have ignored the writer's edict to know your subject—most of his cows are male. The CGI is excellent, with characters whose depth and solidity suggest Nick Park's clay animations. The laughs subside near the end as the requisite moral kicks in, but this is still that rare kids' movie I'd recommend to parents and non-parents alike.\" Claudia Puig of \"USA Today\" gave the film a score of 2.5/4, calling it \"a sweet and mildly funny movie that will entertain young audiences, but one aspect is utterly mystifying: The two main characters, father and son bovine creatures, have large, distracting udders.\"\n\nAs of 2018, \"Barnyard\" grossed $72.6 million domestically and $43.9 million internationally for a worldwide total of $116.5 million, against its production budget of $51 million.\n\nThe film opened at #2 at the box office on its opening weekend behind \"\", earning $16 million at the domestic box office from 3,311 theaters. On the film's second weekend, it dropped 38.7%, grossing $9.7 million and finishing in 4th place, behind \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\", \"Step Up\", and \"World Trade Center\". By its closing on November 2, 2006, it grossed almost $73 million in its domestic theatrical release.\n\nThe film's score is done by John Debney. The soundtrack was released on August 22, 2006 by Bulletproof Records. It includes an original song by indie pop band the Starlight Mints and \"You Gotta Move\" by Aerosmith.\n\nOther songs featured in the film:\n\nA video game based on the film was produced by THQ and Blue Tongue Entertainment. It is an adventure game in which the player names their own male or female cow and walk around the barnyard and play mini-games, pull pranks on humans, and ride bikes, plus party hard. The game was released for PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, Wii, PC and Game Boy Advance.\n\nOn September 29, 2007, a CG animated television series based on the film and titled \"Back at the Barnyard\" premiered on Nickelodeon. Chris Hardwick replaced Kevin James in the role of Otis, and Leigh-Allyn Baker voiced new character Abby, who replaced Daisy. The series ran for two seasons, and ended on November 12, 2011.\n\n"}
{"id": "339806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=339806", "title": "Burlesque", "text": "Burlesque\n\nA burlesque is a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects. The word derives from the Italian ', which, in turn, is derived from the Italian ' – a joke, ridicule or mockery.\n\nBurlesque overlaps in meaning with caricature, parody and travesty, and, in its theatrical sense, with extravaganza, as presented during the Victorian era. \"Burlesque\" has been used in English in this literary and theatrical sense since the late 17th century. It has been applied retrospectively to works of Chaucer and Shakespeare and to the Graeco-Roman classics. Contrasting examples of literary burlesque are Alexander Pope's \"The Rape of the Lock\" and Samuel Butler's \"Hudibras\". An example of musical burlesque is Richard Strauss's 1890 Burleske for piano and orchestra. Examples of theatrical burlesques include W. S. Gilbert's \"Robert the Devil\" and the A. C. Torr – Meyer Lutz shows, including \"Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué\".\n\nA later use of the term, particularly in the United States, refers to performances in a variety show format. These were popular from the 1860s to the 1940s, often in cabarets and clubs, as well as theatres, and featured bawdy comedy and female striptease. Some Hollywood films attempted to recreate the spirit of these performances from the 1930s to the 1960s, or included burlesque-style scenes within dramatic films, such as 1972's \"Cabaret\" and 1979's \"All That Jazz\", among others. There has been a resurgence of interest in this format since the 1990s.\n\nThe word first appears in a title in Francesco Berni's \"Opere burlesche\" of the early 16th century, works that had circulated widely in manuscript before they were printed. For a time, burlesque verses were known as \"poesie bernesca\" in his honour. 'Burlesque' as a literary term became widespread in 17th century Italy and France, and subsequently England, where it referred to a grotesque imitation of the dignified or pathetic. Shakespeare's Pyramus and Thisbe scene in \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" and the general mocking of romance in Beaumont and Fletcher's \"The Knight of the Burning Pestle\" were early examples of such imitation.\n\nIn 17th century Spain, playwright and poet Miguel de Cervantes ridiculed medieval romance in his many satirical works. Among Cervantes' works are \"Exemplary Novels\" and the \"Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes\" published in 1615. The term burlesque has been applied retrospectively to works of Chaucer and Shakespeare and to the Graeco-Roman classics.\n\nBurlesque was intentionally ridiculous in that it imitated several styles and combined imitations of certain authors and artists with absurd descriptions. In this, the term was often used interchangeably with \"pastiche\", \"parody\", and the 17th and 18th century genre of the \"mock-heroic\". Burlesque depended on the reader's (or listener's) knowledge of the subject to make its intended effect, and a high degree of literacy was taken for granted.\n\n17th and 18th century burlesque was divided into two types: High burlesque refers to a burlesque imitation where a literary, elevated manner was applied to a commonplace or comically inappropriate subject matter as, for example, in the literary parody and the mock-heroic. One of the most commonly cited examples of high burlesque is Alexander Pope's \"sly, knowing and courtly\" \"The Rape of the Lock\". Low burlesque applied an irreverent, mocking style to a serious subject; an example is Samuel Butler's poem \"Hudibras\", which described the misadventures of a Puritan knight in satiric doggerel verse, using a colloquial idiom. Butler's addition to his comic poem of an ethical subtext made his caricatures into satire.\n\nIn more recent times, burlesque true to its literary origins is still performed in revues and sketches. Tom Stoppard's 1974 play \"Travesties\" is an example of a full-length play drawing on the burlesque tradition.\n\nBeginning in the early 18th century, the term burlesque was used throughout Europe to describe musical works in which serious and comic elements were juxtaposed or combined to achieve a grotesque effect. As derived from literature and theatre, \"burlesque\" was used, and is still used, in music to indicate a bright or high-spirited mood, sometimes in contrast to seriousness.\n\nIn this sense of farce and exaggeration rather than parody, it appears frequently on the German-language stage between the middle of the 19th century and the 1920s. Burlesque operettas were written by Johann Strauss II (\"Die lustigen Weiber von Wien\", 1868), Ziehrer (\"Mahomed's Paradies\",1866; \"Das Orakel zu Delfi\", 1872; \"Cleopatra, oder Durch drei Jahrtausende\", 1875; \"In fünfzig Jahren\", 1911) and Bruno Granichstaedten (\"Casimirs Himmelfahrt\", 1911). French references to burlesque are less common than German, though Grétry composed for a \"drame burlesque\" (\"Matroco\", 1777). Stravinsky called his 1916 one-act chamber opera-ballet \"Renard\" (\"The Fox\") a \"Histoire burlesque chantée et jouée\" (\"burlesque tale sung and played\") and his 1911 ballet \"Petrushka\" a \"burlesque in four scenes\". A later example is the 1927 burlesque operetta by Ernst Krenek entitled \"Schwergewicht\" (\"Heavyweight\") (1927).\n\nSome orchestral and chamber works have also been designated as burlesques, of which two early examples are the Ouverture-Suite \"Burlesque de Quixotte\", TWV 55, by Telemann and the Sinfonia Burlesca by Leopold Mozart (1760). Another often-performed piece is Richard Strauss's 1890 Burleske for piano and orchestra. Other examples include the following:\n\nBurlesque can be used to describe particular movements of instrumental musical compositions, often involving dance rhythms. Examples are the Burlesca, in Partita No. 3 for keyboard (BWV 827) by Bach, the \"Rondo-Burleske\" third movement of Symphony No. 9 by Mahler, and the \"Burlesque\" fourth movement of Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 1.\n\nThe use of burlesque has not been confined to classical music. Well known ragtime travesties include \"The Russian Rag\", by George L. Cobb, which is based on Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor, and Harry Alford's \"Lucy's Sextette\" based on the sextet, 'Chi mi frena in tal momento?', from \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" by Donizetti.\n\nVictorian burlesque, sometimes known as \"travesty\" or \"extravaganza\", was popular in London theatres between the 1830s and the 1890s. It took the form of musical theatre parody in which a well-known opera, play or ballet was adapted into a broad comic play, usually a musical play, often risqué in style, mocking the theatrical and musical conventions and styles of the original work, and quoting or pastiching text or music from the original work. The comedy often stemmed from the incongruity and absurdity of the classical subjects, with realistic historical dress and settings, being juxtaposed with the modern activities portrayed by the actors. Madame Vestris produced burlesques at the Olympic Theatre beginning in 1831 with \"Olympic Revels\" by J. R. Planché. Other authors of burlesques included H. J. Byron, G. R. Sims, F. C. Burnand, W. S. Gilbert and Fred Leslie.\n\nVictorian burlesque related to and in part derived from traditional English pantomime \"with the addition of gags and 'turns'.\" In the early burlesques, following the example of ballad opera, the words of the songs were written to popular music; later burlesques mixed the music of opera, operetta, music hall and revue, and some of the more ambitious shows had original music composed for them. This English style of burlesque was successfully introduced to New York in the 1840s.\nSome of the most frequent subjects for burlesque were the plays of Shakespeare and grand opera. The dialogue was generally written in rhyming couplets, liberally peppered with bad puns. A typical example from a burlesque of \"Macbeth\": Macbeth and Banquo enter under an umbrella, and the witches greet them with \"Hail! hail! hail!\" Macbeth asks Banquo, \"What mean these salutations, noble thane?\" and is told, \"These showers of 'Hail' anticipate your 'reign'\". A staple of burlesque was the display of attractive women in travesty roles, dressed in tights to show off their legs, but the plays themselves were seldom more than modestly risqué.\nBurlesque became the speciality of certain London theatres, including the Gaiety and Royal Strand Theatre from the 1860s to the early 1890s. Until the 1870s, burlesques were often one-act pieces running less than an hour and using pastiches and parodies of popular songs, opera arias and other music that the audience would readily recognize. The house stars included Nellie Farren, John D'Auban, Edward Terry and Fred Leslie. From about 1880, Victorian burlesques grew longer, until they were a whole evening's entertainment rather than part of a double- or triple-bill. In the early 1890s, these burlesques went out of fashion in London, and the focus of the Gaiety and other burlesque theatres changed to the new more wholesome but less literary genre of Edwardian musical comedy.\n\nAmerican burlesque shows were originally an offshoot of Victorian burlesque. The English genre had been successfully staged in New York from the 1840s, and it was popularised by a visiting British burlesque troupe, Lydia Thompson and the \"British Blondes\", beginning in 1868. New York burlesque shows soon incorporated elements and the structure of the popular minstrel shows. They consisted of three parts: first, songs and ribald comic sketches by low comedians; second, assorted olios and male acts, such as acrobats, magicians and solo singers; and third, chorus numbers and sometimes a burlesque in the English style on politics or a current play. The entertainment was usually concluded by an exotic dancer or a wrestling or boxing match.\n\nWhile burlesque went out of fashion in England towards the end of the 19th century, to be replaced by Edwardian musical comedy, the American style of burlesque flourished, but with increasing focus on female nudity. Exotic \"cooch\" dances were brought in, ostensibly Syrian in origin. The entertainments were given in clubs and cabarets, as well as music halls and theatres. By the early 20th century, there were two national circuits of burlesque shows competing with the vaudeville circuit, as well as resident companies in New York, such as Minsky's at the Winter Garden.\nThe transition from burlesque on the old lines to striptease was gradual. At first, soubrettes showed off their figures while singing and dancing; some were less active but compensated by appearing in elaborate stage costumes. The strippers gradually supplanted the singing and dancing soubrettes; by 1932 there were at least 150 strip principals in the US. Star strippers included Sally Rand, Gypsy Rose Lee, Tempest Storm, Lili St. Cyr, Blaze Starr, Ann Corio and Margie Hart, who was celebrated enough to be mentioned in song lyrics by Lorenz Hart and Cole Porter. By the late 1930s, burlesque shows would have up to six strippers supported by one or two comics and a master of ceremonies. Comics who appeared in burlesque early in their careers included Fanny Brice, Mae West, Eddie Cantor, Abbott and Costello, W. C. Fields, Jackie Gleason, Danny Thomas, Al Jolson, Bert Lahr, Phil Silvers, Sid Caesar, Danny Kaye, Red Skelton and Sophie Tucker.\nThe uninhibited atmosphere of burlesque establishments owed much to the free flow of alcoholic liquor, and the enforcement of Prohibition was a serious blow. In New York, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia clamped down on burlesque, effectively putting it out of business by the early 1940s. It lingered on elsewhere in the U.S., increasingly neglected, and by the 1970s, with nudity commonplace in theatres, reached \"its final shabby demise.\" Both during its declining years and afterwards there have been films that sought to capture American burlesque, including \"Lady of Burlesque\" (1943), \"Striporama\" (1953), and \"The Night They Raided Minsky's\" (1968).\nIn recent decades, there has been a revival of burlesque, sometimes called Neo-Burlesque, on both sides of the Atlantic. A new generation, nostalgic for the spectacle and perceived glamour of the classic American burlesque, developed a cult following for the art in the early 1990s at Billie Madley's \"Cinema\" and later at the \"Dutch Weismann's Follies\" revues in New York City, \"The Velvet Hammer\" troupe in Los Angeles and The Shim-Shamettes in New Orleans. Ivan Kane's Royal Jelly Burlesque Nightclub at Revel Atlantic City opened in 2012. Notable Neo-burlesque performers include Dita Von Teese, and Julie Atlas Muz and Agitprop groups like Cabaret Red Light incorporated political satire and performance art into their burlesque shows. Annual conventions such as the Vancouver International Burlesque Festival and the Miss Exotic World Pageant are held.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1231563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1231563", "title": "Cardistry", "text": "Cardistry\n\nCardistry is a name given to the performance art of card flourishing. The term is a portmanteau of \"card\" and \"artistry\". Unlike card magic, cardistry is meant to be visually impressive and appear very hard to execute. People who engage in cardistry are colloquially known as \"cardists\".\n\nConjuring tricks with playing cards became popular around the 19th century. At that time, simple card flourishes—such as the Charlier Cut, Riffle Shuffle and Thumb Fan—were often performed by magicians as a way of demonstrating sleight of hand.\n\nCardistry is a portmanteau of “card” and “artistry.” It involves the use of hands to create cuts, displays, fans, patterns and sequences through the use of playing cards. Various armspreads, cuts, shuffles and springs can be used. The intent is to create a captivating motion and beautiful display. The effects are limited only by the types of cards used, the imagination, and the degree of manual dexterity of the performer. The presentation is typically neither “illusionary” nor purportedly “magic”; rather, it is more like juggling, mime, or similar entertaining activities.\n\nCardistry moves typically have unusual names that reflect their creator, origin, or appearance. There is Kevin Ho's \"Flurf\", \"Off the Hook\", and \"Racoon\", Joey Burton's \"Skater Cut\", Huron Low's \"Firefly\" and \"Flicker\", Daren Yeow's \"Rev 2 Twirl\", Bone Ho's \"Anaconda\" and \"Tornado Deck Split\", Oliver Sogard's \"Friffle\", Dan Buck's \"Vertigo\", and many more. Chris Kenner's two-handed \"Sybil Cut\" flourish uses multiple packets of cards, and is a good example of a popular flourish. It is arguably the most well-known and recognized move among cardists, and is a common starting challenge that newbies to the art try to take on. But from there, there are all kinds of advanced maneuvers to learn, some almost being a sub-genre of their own, such as \"isolations\".\nAmerican magician Chris Kenner published \"Totally Out of Control\" in 1992, an instructional book concerning magic tricks with household objects. On page 125 was a two-handed flourish he called \"The Five Faces of Sybil\". Making use of all fingers, the ending face of Sybil displays five distinct packets. Kenner referred to Sybil in his book as \"a quick cut flourish to demonstrate skill and dexterity\". The cut became the most notable creation from \"Totally Out of Control\" and would eventually form the nucleus of what is now known as cardistry. Kevin Pang of \"Vanity Fair\" magazine remarked that \"every cardist can deftly perform Sybil the way guitarists can run through a blues progression\".\n\nLos Angeles-based magician Brian Tudor released an instructional VHS tape in 1997 dubbed \"Show Off\" which featured only flourishes, including numerous variations of Sybil. The tape was well received by critics and resulted in growing attention to card flourishing as a performance art.\nSybil enthusiasts and twin brothers Dan and Dave released in 2001 \"Pasteboard Animations\", another VHS tape explaining advanced cuts and flourishes. It sold hundreds of copies and was critically praised in a \"Genii\" magazine review that same year. In 2004, the twins released the instructional DVD \"The Dan and Dave System\" which officially separated advanced card flourishing from magic. Three years later in 2007, Dan and Dave released \"The Trilogy\", a three-disc DVD set. Retailing at $85 per unit, \"The Trilogy\" is the best-selling cardistry release of all time, having sold more than 25,000 copies. Virtually every cardist mentions either the \"System\" or \"The Trilogy\" as the source of their inspiration.\n\nCardistry-Con, dubbed CC, is an interactive conference centered around the art of cardistry, where cardists from all over the world can gather and explore the limitless expressive potential of an ordinary deck of playing cards. The event promotes cardistry in an encouraging environment suitable for anyone passionate about the art. The \"beta\" Cardistry-Con occurred in 2014 as a subsection of Dan & Dave's Magic Con. In 2015, Magic Con was discontinued and an official Cardistry Con took its place. The 2015 CC took place in Brooklyn, New York. With the second annual Cardistry-Con in Berlin, Germany 2016, the Cardistry-Con Championship (CCC) was birthed, allowing cardists to compete in a competitive showcase of skill. The two finalists would be flown out to the event and have their video's screened live. The third annual Cardistry-Con took place in Los Angeles, California 2017.\n\n"}

{"id": "262807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=262807", "title": "Ceroc", "text": "Ceroc\n\nCeroc is an international dance club which has with over 200 venues across the UK as well as national and regional competitions and weekend events throughout the year. It also has franchises in many other countries in Europe, Asia and the antipodes.\n\nThe name 'Ceroc' is said to derive from the French \"C'est le roc\" (it's roc), used to describe rock n' roll dancing in France.\n\nCeroc was created in London, England, by James Cronin, the son of writer Vincent Cronin, and grandson of Scottish author A. J. Cronin. In January 1980 he held the first ever Ceroc event in Porchester Hall in London. By 1982, Ceroc had a cabaret team that performed routines in London nightclubs and venues. Throughout the spring and summer of 1982, the Ceroc troupe worked with choreographer Michel Ange Lau, whose classes Cronin and Sylvia Coleman had attended at the Centre Charles Peguy, a French youth centre, in Leicester Square. The first video recording of a Ceroc event appears on the description for the \"Gold Bug\" routine, performed at the 1982 Ceroc Ball, a charity event, at the Hammersmith Palais.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Cronin and Sylvia Coleman created Ceroc Enterprises, registered Ceroc as a trademark and started to sell Ceroc franchises around the country. In 1992, the Ceroc Teachers Association (CTA) was created, with associated examinations – all Ceroc teachers had to pass the relevant CTA examinations to be licensed to teach at Ceroc events. In 1994, Ceroc introduced 'taxi dancers' to their venues – volunteers who are experienced dancers, designated to assist beginners.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Cronin and Coleman sold Ceroc Enterprises to Mike Ellard, the current owner. By 2004, Ceroc Enterprises were running over 100 different venues, and claimed attendance figures of 500,000. In 2006, Ceroc started expanding into the \"Weekender\" market.\n\nAs of 2008, Ceroc Enterprises has franchises operating in Ireland, France, Italy, Spain, the UAE, Canada, the United States and Hong Kong. As of September 2008, there are over 30 Ceroc franchises running in the United Kingdom and 150 Ceroc venues there. There are also Ceroc organizations in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Africa and Dubai.\n\nApart from the franchises described above, there are Ceroc organisations in Australia and New Zealand. Ceroc Enterprises is a separate company to \"Ceroc Australia\" and \"Ceroc and Modern Jive Dance Company\" or CMJ (also based in Australia). These Australian companies are not franchisees of Ceroc Enterprises. Similarly, there is no legal connection between Ceroc Enterprises and \"Ceroc New Zealand\". In November 2013 'Ceroc Australia' was sold to 'Ceroc and Modern Jive Dance Company\" or CMJ to bring them both back under the same umbrella since they split in 1998.\n\nOutside of the Ceroc Franchise, the dance style Modern Jive is also taught and danced in many independent venues, where it is commonly called LeRoc. Originally it was the same dance style taught in Ceroc venues and independents, but these have diverged enormously over the last 20 years. However, dancers who have learned at either Ceroc venues or independents can dance together in freestyle, as underneath stylistic differences it is fundamentally the same dance. Ceroc franchise venues often attract a younger demographic than independents, largely because of their branding and that they often recruit younger teachers, however this is by no means ubiquitous.\n\nIn 1990, Robert Austin, an original Ceroc franchisee who had broken away from Ceroc to form LeJive, coined the term \"Modern Jive\". \"Modern Jive\" is a generic term for the dance form, and is used by teachers and clubs that are not affiliated to Ceroc Enterprise. Ceroc does not recognise the term “Modern Jive”, and Ceroc’s web site states that it teaches dance in general and not a specific dance form.\n\nMost Ceroc venues run regular classes, every week, usually on Monday through Thursdays.\n\nCeroc class formats are quite different from most other dance forms, in that:\n\nIn the UK, the franchise nature of Ceroc enforces a degree of uniformity across all teachers and all venues. Ceroc classes typically follow the same format, and comprise:\n\nThe start time varies from venue to venue, but is generally between 7pm and 8pm. Sunday classes often start earlier. Whatever the start time, the entire evening lasts three to four hours in most venues (with rare exceptions).\n\nA \"Beginner Progression\" class (also known variously as \"Bridging\", \"Beginner Consolidation\", \"Intromediate\" or \"Freestyle class\" ) taught at the same time as the \"Intermediate\" or \"Intermediate/Advanced\" class has also been introduced in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, and Adelaide, involving a breakdown of technique and either a review of the preceding \"Beginner\" class (possibly with some extensions or variations to the moves from that class) or a new routine drawn from a mixture of intermediate and beginner level moves . This class is taught at the same time as the \"Intermediate\" class.\n\nIndividual teachers are less constrained as to the content of the Intermediate classes, however there is generally a stronger focus on technique (footwork, frame & connection, balance etc.), intermediate skills (dips & drops, leans, spinning etc.) and styling rather than just teaching \"moves\".\n\nA video clip of a Ceroc class filmed in Melbourne can be seen at Mind Body & Soul\n\nMost Australian schools teach \"Step\" footwork. See Modern Jive#Step footwork vs Rock footwork\n\nIn New Zealand there are typically \"Beginners,\" \"Intermediate\" and \"Advanced\" classes, with the clearer separation of moves between the classes. Moving up the classes leads to moves which are more complicated, more syncopated and physically closer. Beginners moves have 2-4 timing, preserve contact between partners at all times, have single speed, single turn spins, the dancers keep their balance (no leans, drops or dips) and partners only contact with each other is hands, arms and shoulders. Intermediate moves introduce single speed double spins and assisted double speed turns, contact with the partners back, and leans (in which one partner takes the others' weight with their body). Advanced moves can include multiple speed, multiple turn spins, loss of contact, significant syncopation, dips and drops (in which one partner takes the weight of the other with their arms) and/or contact with different body parts.\n\nAs well as regular class nights, most Ceroc franchises put on special events, termed 'Freestyles', on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Sunday freestyles are termed 'tea dances' and are often held in the afternoon rather than evening. Some freestyle events begin with an 'icebreaker' class, usually at an intermediate level as beginners are unlikely to attend freestyles.\n\nA typical Saturday night freestyle would begin at either 8pm or 9pm and run until between 12midnight and 2am. Freestyles are usually held at larger venues such as town halls, and often have two rooms: the Main Room, usually the largest room playing up tempo music between 100 and 150BPM; and often a 'Blues Room' or 'Chillout' room, playing slower music between 80 and 110BPM, allowing for slower dancing focusing more on connection, interpretation and musicality.\n\nMany Ceroc teachers also occasionally run daytime dance workshops at weekends, which in the UK are known as Cerocshops. A workshop lasts for four hours, and covers more moves than are covered in a single regular evening class. The standard Ceroc workshops are graded (\"Beginners 1\", \"Beginners 2\", \"Beginners Plus\", \"Intermediate 1\", \"Intermediate 2\", and \"Intermediate Plus\").\nSpecialised workshops may also be available which cover more advanced techniques and styles such as \"Dips & Drops\", \"Baby Aerials\", \"Double Trouble\" (one lead, two follows), \"Switch it Up\" (swapping partners), \"Ceroc to Blues\", \"Footwork\", \"Frame\", \"Spins & Turn technique\", \"Musicality\", \"Connection & Posture\". The frequency and content of these workshops depends on the resident teacher or guest teachers who may teach various workshops over the course of a weekend often with a freestyle party in the evening such as Ceroc Aberdeen's Beach Ballroom Weekend or Ceroc Conexion's Extreme Mini Weekender.\n\nCeroc Enterprises holds an annual UK Ceroc dance championship. This is held in London (currently at the Watford Colosseum) at the beginning of May with a mix of freestyle dancing and competitions. Competitions range from beginner oriented categories, such as the Lucky Dip (a Jack and Jill competition) and 'Ceroc X' where competitors are restricted to a set list of 8 basic moves, which they have to dance to different musical styles and are judged on performance and musicality.\n\nIn recent years, the Intermediate and Advanced Freestyle Categories have been merged into an All Stars category divided into three different age brackets. Above this there is still the Open category, and Top Cats, another Jack and Jill where individual competitors are judged rather than couples. Other categories include Aerials, Showcase, and Team Cabaret competitions.\n\nThere are other championships held on a regional or franchise basis, for example the Midlands, Ceroc Scotland and Welsh champs, and the Australasian.\n\nCeroc also hosts the European Neo-Blues Championships. This is held at the weekender 'Breeze' at the Pontins at Brean Sands in October, and includes an invitational Masters Jack and Jill, Blues Open, Blues DWAS, and Showcase categories.\n\nCeroc hosts a number of 'Ceroc Escape' dance weekenders throughout the year, attracting hundreds of dancers from around the UK and Europe. Most of these take place at the Pontins holiday resorts at Camber Sands, Southport and Somerset. Other more luxurious weekenders are held at hotels, such as LUX and Swish. Freestyle dancing begins on the Friday night and carries on through until the Monday morning. During the day a range classes and workshops are available with teachers from around the country. Most events have a Saturday night cabaret, featuring teachers showcase, competition, and showcase performances.\n\nIn 2005, Ceroc Enterprises completed the purchase of Rebel Roc, along with its annual dance weekender event at Pontins, Camber Sands. The first such event under the ownership of Ceroc Enterprises was Ceroc \"Storm\" at Camber Sands in March 2006. Ceroc Enterprises has been expanding its weekender offerings, and has taken over weekender venues from JiveTime (Camber Sands) at the end of 2007, and Jive Addiction (Southport) in August 2008.\n\n\n"}

Released worldwide on November 10, 2009, it generated several controversies. In the game's fourth level, \"No Russian\", the player controls an undercover CIA agent who participates in a mass shooting at a Moscow airport to gain the trust of a Russian terrorist group. This level was largely criticized for allowing players to partake in a terrorist attack, and international versions of the game were subject to censorship due to the level's content. Allegations of homophobic content arose when Infinity Ward released a video titled \"Fight Against Grenade Spam\". Some video game journalists chastised the video's use of profanity, and that the video's title forms the acronym F.A.G.S., a pejorative for gay people. In response, Infinity Ward removed the video from YouTube. An easter egg referencing the United States policy \"don't ask, don't tell\" was also seen as homophobic, though most journalists belittled these allegations. The Windows version of the game was also met with criticism from players, when it was revealed that the game would not support dedicated servers among a litany of other changes. Windows players created an online petition to allow for dedicated servers, receiving over 150,000 signatures in ten days. However, despite these controversies, \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2\" grossed $310 million in its first day of release.\n\nIn the game's fourth level, \"No Russian\", the player controls an undercover CIA agent who participates in a mass shooting at a Moscow airport to gain the trust of a Russian terrorist group. It begins with the player walking out of an elevator with four other gunmen, who proceed to open fire on a large group of civilians at a security checkpoint. The player then accompanies the gunmen as they walk through the airport, killing any remaining civilians. The only legitimate targets are a group of security personnel encountered in waves throughout the airport interior, and a more heavily armed gang of riot squad members deployed on the tarmac. The level is very graphic, as screams can be heard throughout, and the injured crawl away leaving blood trails. However, the player is never forced to partake in the massacre, and may instead let their comrades kill the civilians. If the player does not feel comfortable during the level, they are allowed to skip to the next level with no penalties.\n\nPrior to the release of \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2\", footage taken from the \"No Russian\" level was leaked on the Internet. Though some journalists were cautious towards the level's content, they decided to wait until they could actually play the level to judge its merits. After the game's release, \"No Russian\" was largely criticized for allowing players to partake in a terrorist attack. Vince Horiuchi of \"The Salt Lake Tribune\" felt that the level was in poor taste following the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, and questioned why the level couldn't have been told through a non-interactive cutscene. Marc Cieslak of BBC News was saddened by \"No Russian\", as he felt it disproved his theory that the video game industry had \"grown up\". Several prominent British religious leaders condemned \"No Russian\": Alexander Goldberg of the London Jewish Forum was worried that children would play the level; Fazan Mohammed of the British Muslim Forum described the level as an intimate experience of enacting terrorism; and Stephen Lowe, the retired Bishop of Hulme, felt that the level was \"sickening\". Due to the graphic content featured in \"No Russian\", \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2\" was subject to censorship in international versions of the game, including the entire removal of the level from the Russian version.\n\nIn October 2009, Infinity Ward posted a video titled \"Fight Against Grenade Spam\" on YouTube. In the video, professional baseball player Cole Hamels delivers a public service announcement that advocates against the use of grenade spam. Hamels uses profanity in the video, calling grenade spam \"for pussies\", and says \"what the fuck\" when he is blown up with grenades. Soon after the video was released, it was quickly discovered that the video's title forms the acronym F.A.G.S., which is a pejorative term against gay people. Phillip Kollar of \"Game Informer\" criticized that the title's acronym and use of profanity, and felt that Infinity Ward was condoning homophobic slurs. Freelance journalist Mitchell Dyer echoed Kollar's statement, and commented that the video \"seems to enforce the asshole-ry\" of homophobic slurs. In response to the backlash, Infinity Ward community manager Robert Bowling remarked that while the video was intended to be a social commentary joke, he understood why people found it offensive, and removed the video from YouTube.\n\nFurther allegations of homophobic content arose when a easter egg was discovered in the game's opening tutorial level. If the player remains idle for a brief period of time, they are able to hear one soldier ask another soldier about his sexuality, and then remark \"don't ask, don't tell\". This easter egg references the United States policy \"Don't ask, don't tell\", which prevented openly gay people from serving in the United States Armed Forces. Unlike the \"Fight Against Grenade Spam\" video, few journalists commented on the easter egg. Jim Sterling of \"Destructoid\" felt that the easter egg was \"too silly/stupid\" for him to be angry at, while James Sherwood of \"The Register\" commented that people were trying to generate controversy over unimportant dialogue. Lyle Masaki of Logo TV's NewNowNext.com deemed the easter egg to be homophobic, but not representative of the game as a whole.\n\nIn a webcast conducted prior to the game's release, Bowling revealed that the Windows version of \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2\" would not support dedicated servers, and would instead be powered by the IWNet server. Infinity Ward would go on to state that the Windows version would also lack console commands, not support multiplayer matches larger than 18 players, and the inability for players to ban other players who are cheating. These decisions angered many Windows gamers, with Ben Kuchera of \"Ars Technica\" commenting: \"at launch, this will be one of the most locked-down, inflexible, and gamer-unfriendly game ever created.\" An online petition was created to have Infinity Ward allow dedicated servers, which surpassed 150,000 signatures in ten days. Additionally, users on Amazon.com submitted over 125 one-star reviews for the Windows version of the game. Mike Griffiths, CEO of Activision, stated that while Infinity Ward was aware of the petition, they weren't overly worried. He commented that IWNet would allow for a \"friendly consumer experience\", and that the benefits outweighed the negatives. \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2\" would go on to sell more than 4.7 million copies and gross $310 million in the United States and United Kingdom in its first day of release. According to Bowling, while only 3% of the game's sales came from the Windows version, it still outsold the Windows version of \"\" in its first week.\n"}

The song was released as the fourth and final single from the album. \"Criminal\" was written and produced by Max Martin and Shellback, with additional writing by Tiffany Amber. After Spears first listened to the song, she felt it was different and unlike anything she had heard before. She posted a snippet of it online on March 2, 2011, prior to the album's release. \"Criminal\" was chosen as a single by a poll on her Facebook page, as Spears explained it was a way to give back to her fans. The artwork for the single was released on September 14, 2011.\n\n\"Criminal\" is a guitar and synth-driven mid-tempo pop ballad which incorporates a folk-style flute melody. It is considered the only ballad on \"Femme Fatale\", and is less aggressive than the other songs of the album. \"Criminal\" is influenced by the works of ABBA and Madonna. In the song, Spears sings about being in love with a bad boy and outlaw, and pleads to her mother to not worry about their relationship. \"Criminal\" received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising its organic and refreshing feel in comparison with the rest of the album. After the release of \"Femme Fatale\", the song charted on the South Korean International chart. \"Criminal\" has also charted in major markets such as Canada, France, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States.\n\nThe accompanying music video for the song was filmed at Dalston and Stoke Newington, London. It features Spears as a woman in upper society and follows her relationship with a criminal, played by her then real-life boyfriend Jason Trawick. Prior to its release, London officials criticized Spears for shooting scenes with a replica gun and glamorizing violence. The video received a positive response from critics, with some calling it the best music video from \"Femme Fatale\". Reviewers also noted the parallels between the storyline and themes of the video with Spears's personal life.\n\n\"Criminal\" was written in 2008 by Max Martin, Shellback and Tiffany Amber, and was produced by Martin and Shellback. Spears told MTV News that after she first listened to the song, she felt it was different and unlike anything she had heard before. In an interview with \"Rolling Stone\", Spears spoke about Martin's productions on \"Femme Fatale\", saying, \"Max played a huge role on this album and he has been there since the beginning so there is such a huge level of trust. He gets exactly what I am saying when I tell him what I want and don’t want musically\". Spears recorded her vocals at Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. The track was later mixed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. It was registered on Broadcast Music Incorporated under the legal title \"In Love With a Criminal\". On March 2, 2011, Spears posted on her Twitter account a link to a 17-second clip of the song, describing it as \"one of [her] favorites\".\n\nOn August 5, 2011, she launched a poll on her Facebook page asking fans whether her next single should be \"Criminal\", \"Inside Out\" or \"(Drop Dead) Beautiful.\" After the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, she revealed to MTV News that \"Criminal\" was chosen as the fourth single. On the British talk show \"This Morning\", Spears explained that the song \"was chosen by the fans. It was just cool to give something back to them and see what they would appreciate.\" The \"Criminal (Radio Mix)\", which was included on her second remix album, \"\", was released a single on September 30, 2011 and the song was added to the United States mainstream radio playlists on October 4, 2011. The artwork for the single was released on September 14, 2011. It features Spears looking out into the distance, with her wavy hair falling on her bare back. A mysterious hooded man is also featured on the cover. Robbie Daw of Idolator said that \"it appears as if Camp Spears hired the best Photoshop expert $15 could buy when it came to designing the art. Oh, just kidding — we love red and blue! Makes us think of sex and, uh, ice-cold criminals. Or something.\"\n\n\"Criminal\" is a guitar-driven midtempo track which incorporates a folk-style flute melody. Erin Thompson of the \"Seattle Weekly\" said the song \"takes a breather from aggressive, wall-to-wall synths, driven instead by a steady guitar rhythm and an oddly Asian folky-sounding flute melody.\". The radio edit changes the drums to be louder, among various other instrumental changes. It is considered the only ballad of the album. Thompson compared it to her past ballads, saying it is not \"sappy\" like \"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\" (2002) and not \"teary-sad\" like \"Everytime\" (2004). \"Criminal\" is reminiscent of the music of ABBA and Madonna, and the latter's albums \"Ray of Light\" (1998) and \"American Life\" (2003), according to David Buchanan of \"Consequence of Sound\" and Samesame.com.au, respectively. The beat was compared by Keith Caufield of \"Billboard\" to Madonna's \"Don't Tell Me\" (2000). Carl Wilson of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said \"Criminal\" is \"awkwardly pitched between rock and ballad\". The use of the flute was compared by Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush to the sample of \"The Lonely Goatherd\" from \"The Sound of Music\" (1959) on Gwen Stefani's \"Wind It Up\" (2006).\n\nIn the verses, Spears sings about being in love with a bad boy and outlaw, in lyrics such as \"He is a hustler / He's no good at all / He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum\" and \"He is a bad boy with a tainted heart / And even I know this ain't smart\". During the chorus, she pleads to her mother not to worry in lines such as \"But mama I'm in love with a criminal\" and \"Mama please don't cry / I will be alright.\" Andrew Leahey of \"The Washington Times\" and Erin Thompson of the \"Seattle Weekly\" compared the lyrics to those of Madonna's \"Papa Don't Preach\" (1986), while David Bunachan compared them to Coolio's \"Mama I'm in Love Wit' a Gangsta\" (1994). The words in the chorus end in 'al's syllables, as evident in lyrics such as \"And this type of love isn't rational / It's physical\". Keith Caufield noted that they were an unintentional nod to Supertramp's \"The Logical Song\" (1979). Thompson stated that Spears's vocals are less processed than on the rest of the album, while according to Amy Sciarretto they are \"heavily auto-tuned and studio-treated, [...] she delivers her lines in a monotone, robotic fashion.\"\n\nCriminal received critical acclaim from music critics. Andy Gill of \"The Independent\" called it one of the highlights of \"Femme Fatale\", along with \"Till the World Ends\". Gill also said that the album sounds more programmed than natural, commenting that \"indeed, such is the shock when the final track, 'Criminal', opens with a little folksong-style flute and guitar figure that one's immediate reaction is that a Midlake soundfile has been accidentally appended to Britney's running-order.\" Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush gave the song four stars, explaining that \"Only Brit can make a flute sound sexy. Seriously, few pop stars can pull off a flute and Brit does it with ease.\" Aaron-Spencer Charles of \"Metro\" said that \"the verses, chorus and bridge all work perfectly for Ms. Spears, showing that she still has it from all those years ago.\" Erin Thompson of the \"Seattle Weekly\" called it her best vocal performance of the album, and added that \"it has a spark and a mischievous sass to it – and these days anytime Britney shows even just a bit of her old liveliness and independence, we like it.\" Rudy Klapper of Sputnikmusic commented the song \"isn't exactly the progressive stylings of a Janelle Monáe [\"sic\"], but damn if it’s not catchy \"and\" interesting.\" \"The A.V. Club\"s Genevieve Koski claimed that the album \"[i]s not all dance-floor narcotics\", adding that \"Inside Out\", \"Till the World Ends\" and \"Criminal\" \"add texture to the wall-to-wall synth waves and booty bass.\" Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said the production of \"Femme Fatale\" is \"polished, intriguing and – best of all – fun\", exemplifying \"Inside Out\", the piano breakdown in \"Big Fat Bass\" and the flute in \"Criminal\".\n\nNo Ripcord's Gary McGinley stated that \"Femme Fatale\" \"is so synth-led that hearing the simple guitar lines on Criminal and He's About To Lose Me (from the Deluxe Edition) is refreshing.\" Natalie Shaw of the BBC Online commented that \"Criminal\" \"with its teenage lyrics [...] on top of a fairytale flute melody and a rhythm so summery it manages to completely set itself free from the rest of the album.\" David Buchanan of Consequence of Sound found that \"Femme Fatale\" \"is entirely rescued by backtracking to \"Circus\"-style material, with Rihanna-esque 'Gasoline', and the \"Ray Of Light\"-era Madonna influence in closing song 'Criminal'. Katherine St Asaph of Popdust said that as \"a bad-boy track, it at least makes a bit more lyrical sense than 'Judas' and is more vulnerable than her past few singles, which is probably a good career move.\" Keith Caufield of \"Billboard\" commented that \"while some of the lyrics are a teensy clunky at times – [it] is a fitting closer to a nearly-completely excellent album.\" \"Los Angeles Times\" writer Carl Wilson stated that the album's momentum \"flags only on the closing 'Criminal', with its formless Renaissance fair flute line and a tempo [that is] joyless\". Thomas Conner of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" considered \"Criminal\", along with \"Inside Out\", \"weak mid-tempo fare\" songs. Eric R. Danton of the \"Hartford Courant\" deemed the song as \"an eye-rolling homage to those oh-so-attractive bad boys that good girls lust for in spite of themselves.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine, senior editor of Allmusic, called it \"a lousy song\".\n\nFollowing the release of \"Femme Fatale\", \"Criminal\" reached number fifty-one on South Korea's GAON International Chart, due to digital sales. On September 26, 2011, the song debuted at number forty on the US \"Billboard\" Pop Songs. On the chart issue of November 19, 2011, it peaked at number nineteen. On October 5, 2011, \"Criminal\" entered on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart at number twenty-one. Two weeks later, it debuted on the Hot 100 at number ninety-two, due to sales of 12,000 digital units. It then rose to a new peak of fifty-five. According to Nielsen Soundscan, \"Criminal\" has sold over 279,000 digital units in the United States as of June 2012. The song also entered Canadian Hot 100 at number eighty-three, reaching a new peak of sixty-three a week later and eventually peaking at sixteen. In Brazil, the song reached number 1 on \"Billboard\" Hot Pop Songs, and on Hot 100 Airplay. \"Criminal\" also achieved moderate success in Europe, reaching the top-twenty in Slovakia, Czech Republic, Finland and France, and the top-forty in Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, and both regions of Belgium.\n\nAt the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Spears said to MTV News that she had thought of a \"really cool concept for the video, just to make it interesting. You'll have to see.\" She then contacted Chris Marrs Piliero, who directed the music video for her previous single \"I Wanna Go\", to work with her. She told him the basic story she had planned, which he described as a \"fairy-tale, sweet, knight-in-shining-armor feel to it. I said let's take that and make the fairy tale badass.\" Spears also wanted her real-life boyfriend Jason Trawick to play the criminal. Marrs Piliero was initially hesitant to cast Trawick feeling that a professional actor would do a better job, but did not talk to Spears about it. He told \"USA Today\", \"When you're doing nudity, I don't think it was at the top of Britney's list to bring in some random guy while her boyfriend watches. [...] We definitely wanted to make some passionate, steamy scenes, but we also wanted it to be intensely beautiful. We didn't want to go for raunchy. We wanted it to be sensual and steamy.\" On September 6, 2011, Spears announced through her Twitter account that she had decided to shoot the video \"in the streets of merry old England when I get there.\" In an interview with AOL, she explained, \"I've never shot on location out of the country of America for a video. So, it should be very interesting. It was partly my idea ... to see if it could to happen, and they were like, 'Yeah, it's a great idea,' so we did it.\"\n\nThe video begins at a formal party in which Spears seems to be looking for someone. The opening shot of her was inspired by the scene of Jennifer Love Hewitt walking into the party in \"Can't Hardly Wait\" (1998). Her boyfriend (Bradshaw) talks with two people next to her. He persuades her to smile to avoid embarrassment from the guests then verbally abuses her and grabs her face, after which she leaves to the restroom, where she wipes away a tear and puts on her fragrance Radiance. She comes back to the party and catches her boyfriend flirting with another woman; Spears tells her \"So you're not working the street corner tonight I see?\", making her boyfriend angry. He apologizes to the other woman for his girlfriend's remark then grabs Spears by the arm and carries her outside the building. After he slaps her, one of the waiters of the party (Trawick) wearing a leather jacket punches her boyfriend several times. The waiter asks Spears if she is okay, and after she kicks her boyfriend in the crotch goodbye, she replies \"Now I'm okay.\" She and the waiter climb on his motorcycle and leave the scene. When they get to his house, it is revealed by a newspaper that he is a criminal. She opens one of the lockers in his house and finds a gun, after which the couple kisses. This is followed by scenes of them having sex.\n\nThe next morning, the criminal brings Spears breakfast to the bed and kisses her on the forehead. He has several tattoos in his body, including one on his chest that reads \"R.I.P. Goose\", a reference to the film \"Top Gun\" (1986). They go to a convenience store where she steals vanilla candles and points the gun to the employee; the criminal takes money out of the cash register and they escape by stealing a Citroën DS3. The robbery is caught by the security cameras, and pictures of the couple appear on the local news. There are scenes of them having sex in the shower. As they change clothes, several policemen then appear outside the criminal's house; they start shooting it with Heckler & Koch MP5's as Spears and the man embrace, kissing passionately. The policemen then enter the house, and one of them confirms that the couple escaped. The video ends with Spears and the criminal escaping on the motorcycle as the credits roll. One of them reads \"No vanilla candles were harmed in the making of this music video.\" The video also includes intercut scenes of Spears performing dance moves similar to voguing.\n\nAfter pictures of Spears and Trawick carrying replica guns on set surfaced online, the Hackney London Borough Council criticized her for \"promoting gun violence\", since the area had been badly affected by the 2011 England riots. The Council told \"London Tonight\" that they had not agreed to the use of replica guns at Stoke Newington Town Hall, and that they would be raising the matter with the production company. Councillor Ian Rathbone added that Spears should apologize and make a sizeable donation to a Hackney charity \"for the rudeness and damage she's done to this community.\" When asked if she thought the council was overreacting, Hackney MP Diane Abbott insisted: \"It is only a music video but it's images like this, with popstars glamorising gangs, which means that some young people... get drawn in. Britney should really know better.\" Rae Alexandra of the \"SF Weekly\" explained that the United Kingdom \"is not a place that readily embraces guns. Rather, it's a place where guns are rare, gun licensing is tightly controlled, and the entire establishment has been in a panic about gun use on its streets for the last three years.\" On September 26, 2011, Spears' representatives released a statement to MTV News saying, \"The video is a fantasy story featuring Britney's boyfriend, Jason Trawick, which literally plays out the lyrics of a song written three years before the riots ever happened.\" The production company apologized to the Council before the release of the video. Marrs Piliero stated about the controversy,\n\n\"Holding the gun became a controversial thing 'cause we filmed it in London, and they don't have a lot of gun use out there. That doesn't mean that there's no gun use, so I did find it really interesting. For me, the thing is, it blew me away that members of [the British] Parliament were speaking about this. One, because it's a music video, and two, because don't you guys have television shows out there that show crime? It's really strange to me. I don't understand why pop stars are put on such a high pedestal over other celebrities. Why do members of Parliament feel that they need to scrutinize her for having a gun, and 'She's in the public,' and 'She should know better,' and 'She's a role model,' but what about every other celebrity out there? What about every other actor? That's very strange to me. I was really surprised at how much the gun use was scrutinized. [Trawick plays] a professional criminal, so it makes sense he has a gun. We shouldn't censor ourselves.\"\n\nThe video was ranked at number ten on a list of the ten most controversial music videos in pop music by AOL on September 29, 2011. Spears announced through her Twitter account on October 13, 2011, that the video would be released the following week. On October 17, 2011, she posted five GIF files with scenes from the video on her Tumblr. The video was released the same day on the iTunes Store; it reached the top position on its chart within minutes. Becky Bain of Idolator called it \"an epic mini-movie, full of romance, intrigue [...] [with] a whole lot of unnecessary PDA between Brit and her beau. It was full of passion, joy and just a little touch of madness — just like its star.\" Bain also noted several influences, such as Alfred Hitchcock films and the music videos for Spears' \"Toxic\" (2004) and Green Day’s \"21 Guns\" (2009). A writer for \"Rolling Stone\" also compared it to a Hitchcock film and deemed the opening scene as \"a tribute to Old Hollywood\". The reviewer found the scenes of physical abuse \"surprising\" and called the acting \"stiff\", but said that \"from there on out, we're in the usual comfort zone of a Britney video – sexy dancing, sexy vamping – with the added bonus of gratuitous PDA between the pop star and her real-life boyfriend.\"\n\n\"USA Today\"s Ann Oldenburg described the video as sexy and \"pretty personal.\" Kenneth Partridge of AOL commented, \"Packed with sex, violence and questionable acting, the new Britney Spears video, 'Criminal,' has all the trappings of a midnight movie.\" A reporter from the American edition of \"The Huffington Post\" said: \"We can't honestly remember the last time Britney Spears looked so gorgeous in a music video\" and deemed it as the best video from \"Femme Fatale\". Erin Strecker \"Entertainment Weekly\" also called it the best video of the album, and highlighted Spears' look, the ending scene and the \"fun story\". Katherine St Asaph of Popdust said it is \"probably the best video of the \"Femme Fatale\" era.\" Tom Townshend of MSN stated that although the video was not appropriate for Spears' younger fans, \"[it] is actually rather compelling and feels more like a short film rather than a pop starlet's music video.\" A writer for VH1 said that part of the reason the video works is the comic sensibility between Spears and Marrs Piliero, explaining that \"[it] point[s] to one of Spears's greatest talents: giving the impression that although she takes her career extremely seriously, she nevertheless doesn't take it too seriously.\" The critic summarized the review by saying that the video is \"entertaining [as] a bad-girl adventure story, and her role here is essentially that of a (wait for it) femme fatale.\"\n\nCritics also commented on the Hackney controversy. Sarah Dean of the UK edition of \"The Huffington Post\" said: \"If having a blonde, leather-clad superstar brandishing a gun at a shop owner's face isn't glamourising violence, I'm not sure what is\" and added that, in essence, the video \"seems more like an opportunity for her to live out her sexual fantasies than anything beneficial to music fans.\" Amanda Dobbins of \"New York\" stated that \"After viewing the final product, we're guessing [the local officials] probably won't be down with the shower sex, the regular sex, the domestic abuse, the armed robbery, or any of Britney's other questionable activities, either.\" Katherine St Asaph of Popdust joked about the situation, saying, \"Britney Spears’ video for 'Criminal' is out, and \"gang recruitment is already up 200% since 8 a.m.!\" This has not happened.\" Marianne Garvey of the UK website of E! Online said, \"With the 'fantasy' getting so hot and heavy and Britney stripping down to nothing, the guns are the last thing you notice.\"\n\nAlyssa Rosenberg of ThinkProgress said that although it is common to see pop stars being assaulted by men in their videos —exemplifying Rihanna's \"Man Down\"— the public is aware of Spears's vulnerability, explaining that \"we believe she really would choose a guy who would do something like this to her.\" Rosenberg also stated even though her bad behaviour once she leaves her boyfriend is not directed at him, the fact that he treated her badly is a form of narrative permission for her to rob a store and have sex with the criminal. She also commented that the same narrative works on her previous video with Marrs Piliero for \"I Wanna Go\". The video received comparisons to Rihanna's \"We Found Love\", which was released two days after \"Criminal\", on October 19, 2011. Among the similarities, critics noted that they were both filmed in the United Kingdom and arose controversy in the country; both contain scenes of sex, violence and crime; both feature bad boy archetypes and both evoke the personal lives of the artists. Katherine St Asaph found the opening line of Spears's boyfriend (\"Would you try smiling \"just once\"?\") a subtle dig at the press. She explained that there is a tendency among writers and spectators to call \"her every smile plastered on or conservator-mandated\", and that the fact the line is delivered by her abusive boyfriend only makes it more evident. According to her, that there are two contradictory ways to analyze the relationship between Spears and Trawick as the criminal: it could be seen as him luring her into her life, but Spears is the one that kisses him and she is the first to pull the gun.\n\nSt Asaph explained that the only interpretation of the video lies on the opinion of each viewer about Spears's personal life, and how active a role each person imagines she plays in it. It was noted by St Asaph that although most pop stars release videos that draw from their personal lives, they do not make the viewer uncomfortable. The same cannot be said for Spears and Rihanna, and it does not matter if they themselves have moved on from past situations, because the discussion around them has not. St Asaph also expressed that neither Spears or Rihanna said much about the parallels to their lives, but that they do not need to: their videos are much more effective than anything they could reveal in an interview. Rae Alexandra of the \"SF Weekly\" also compared it to \"We Found Love\", saying that both videos feature an anti-British sentiment. She wrote that all the villains in the video – her boyfriend and the policemen – are British, whereas her savior in the video is an American criminal. Alexandra noted that Spears and Rihanna chose to films their \"grittiest videos\" in a country with a lower crime rate than the United States, that is also so against guns that politicians felt the need to talk about it. According to her, the videos continue with a xenophobic portrayal of British people as villains by American pop culture.\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from \"Femme Fatale\" booklet liner notes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49620198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49620198", "title": "Dad joke", "text": "Dad joke\n\n\"Dad joke\" is a pejorative term used to describe a corny or predictable joke, typically a pun. Generally inoffensive, dad jokes are traditionally told by fathers among family, either with sincere humorous intent, or to intentionally provoke a negative reaction to its \"dagginess\". One of the most common \"dad jokes\" goes as follows: A child will say to the dad, \"I'm hungry,\" to which the dad will reply, \"Hi, Hungry, I'm Dad.\" Many dad jokes may be considered anti-jokes, deriving humour from an intentionally unfunny punchline. \nThe term has spread into general use, receiving mentions in Australian quiz show \"Spicks and Specks\", and American sitcom \"How I Met Your Mother\".\n"}
{"id": "1360328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1360328", "title": "David North (comics)", "text": "David North (comics)\n\nDavid North (born Christoph \"Christopher\" Nord) is a fictional mutant character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He was originally known as Maverick, and more recently as Agent Zero. The character first appeared in \"X-Men\" (vol. 2) #5 and was created by Jim Lee.\n\nDaniel Henney portrayed Agent Zero in the 2009 superhero film \"\".\n\nDavid North has appeared in a self-titled one-shot \"Maverick: In the Shadow of Death\" as well as a self-titled short-lived ongoing series called \"Maverick\".\n\nLater, as Agent Zero, he became a regular in the second series of \"Weapon X\".\n\nChristoph Nord was born in East Germany to American parents. His early history is clouded in mystery, though there are whispers that his parents were involved with the Nazi regime. He also had an older brother, Andreas. A mutant, Christoph possessed the ability to absorb kinetic energy through impact with little to no harm.\n\nA self-described idealist, he fought against the communist regime during the height of the Cold War, joining a West German black ops unit named Cell Six. On a mission in Italy, he was injured by a rival assassin codenamed the Confessor.\n\nWhile recovering, he met an Italian nurse, Ginetta Barsalini, whom he fell in love with and married. Over the next three years, Cell Six's field agents were eliminated one by one, except for Nord. Nord realized Ginetta was a spy. Threatening to shoot her, he demanded to know her employer. Saying he didn't have the guts to shoot a defenseless woman in cold blood, she lunged at him with a knife, causing him to shoot her in self-defense. Dying, she revealed that in killing her, he also killed their unborn child. Long after this incident, Nord continues to be wracked with guilt about the betrayal and still seeks answers as to whom Barsalini was working for. This watershed moment left Nord cold and distrusting of everyone, especially women.\n\nFueled by the betrayal, North became one of the most efficient covert operatives in Germany. In the 1960s, his exploits caught the attention of the CIA, who offered him a spot in the clandestine Team X. He agreed, and at this time, changed his name to David North. As a part of Team X, he was one of the several mutant operatives the government experimented on and exploited. Each member unknowingly received false memory implants, and North received a slight healing factor culled from Logan's DNA. North's immediate team consisted of three field agents: North, Logan (who later became Wolverine), and Victor Creed (who later became Sabretooth). The mutant teleporter John Wraith also referred to as Kestrel, served as the team's intelligence man and extractor. It was at this time that North began wearing his signature yellow and black faceplate.\n\nOn a mission in East Germany, both Creed and Logan were badly injured. Rather than follow protocol and leave them, North dragged them to the extraction point. Cornered by Andreas Nord, now an assassin, North saved his teammates the only way he could; killing his own brother in cold blood. Because of this incident, Logan holds North in very high regard.\n\nAnother mission saw the three agents confront Omega Red in Berlin. They succeeded in stealing the carbonadium synthesizer, which was necessary for the Russian to control his death factor pheromone. Taking down the psychopathic Omega Red was not as easy. In the chaos, Creed panicked, killing Janice Hollenback, the CIA mole they were attempting to rescue. The team then escaped by jumping from a ten-story window. The synthesizer was thought lost, and a rift formed between Creed and Logan due to Creed's actions on the mission. Unbeknownst to the agency, Logan had recovered the synthesizer and hid it. North suspected as much at the time but did not know for sure.\n\nBy the early 1970s, Team X was summarily disbanded. However, the team's agents were captured by Weapon X to be used as test subjects. When Logan underwent the adamantium bonding, he went on a murderous rampage, allowing North and the others to escape. Around this time, North inexplicably lost his powers. Undaunted, North continued to work in espionage as a mercenary using the trade name Maverick. The inspiration for the name had come from a conversation in which North boasted that he neither trusted nor needed anyone, to which Logan responded, \"A regular maverick, eh?\"\n\nTime passed and Maverick developed a reputation as one of the best-hired guns available. Maverick compensated for his lack of powers with meticulous planning and a reliance on the latest technology.\n\nHe worked for private parties and governmental agencies alike, taking several contracts from retired Major Arthur Barrington, the man who had brought North into the CIA. When Omega Red captured Wolverine as well as several of the X-Men in Berlin in an effort to locate the carbonadium synthesizer, Maverick was sent in by Barrington. Maverick helped free the captive X-Men and tracked Sabretooth to Omega Red. With the X-Men's help, he obtained the device from Wolverine and hid it once again. Maverick aided the X-Men in combat against Sabretooth, Omega Red, Fenris, and Matsu'o Tsurayaba. During the course of this incident, Maverick murders apparently Dr. Abraham Cornelius in cold blood.\n\nBarrington later sent him to acquire the Xavier Files, profiles of the powers and weaknesses of various mutants, which were compiled by the X-Men's founder. Maverick battled Warhawk and killed Dr. Alexander Ryking. In the clash, Warhawk exploded, seemingly destroying the files. Maverick was later hired by the US government to protect Aldo Ferro, a former Weapon X member. Former Team X alumni sought Ferro out after Mastodon died when his age suppression factor reversed. Unbeknownst to Team X, Ferro was the second Psi-Borg and was responsible for the planting of false memories during their time with Weapon X. Betrayed by Ferro, Maverick then sided with his former teammates Wolverine, Sabretooth, Silver Fox, and John Wraith, and Ferro was seemingly killed in the subsequent battle.\n\nMaverick next sought to kill Sabretooth, who was in the midst of a psychotic murderous rampage following the death of Birdy. First seeking Wolverine to aid him in this goal, he reluctantly aids the X-Men in merely capturing Sabretooth, setting in motion what became a failed attempt by Charles Xavier to rehabilitate the serial killer.\n\nMaverick swiftly contracted the Legacy Virus. This development brought about the random return of his powers but also a loss of energy and horrible scarring all over his body. He tried to convince Wolverine to kill him, but Wolverine refused. Maverick decided to make the best of it, and \"fight the good fight.\" His health declining, he travelled the world from safe house to safe house, using his savings to procure treatment for his infection.\n\nDuring this time, he recruited a very unstable Wolverine to help him rescue Deadpool. Maverick was attacked by a group led by Slayback at his Manhattan safe house. Maverick managed to escape to the X-Mansion and spent several hours in a coma. After coming to, Maverick revealed that he and Deadpool had been targeted because both were mutants with healing factors taken from Wolverine's DNA template. Maverick felt they would soon come for Wolverine directly. Deadpool was being experimented on in an attempt to create a cure for the Legacy Virus. Maverick and Wolverine located and rescued Deadpool. It was later discovered by Beast that Deadpool's body could not generate a cure.\n\nWhile in New York, he saved a fellow Legacy Virus-positive mutant, teenager Chris Bradley and his family from an attack by the Friends of Humanity. The FOH retaliated by firebombing Bradley's home, spurring Maverick to use his connections to relocate the Bradley family to Florida under aliases. He also got Chris medical treatment and set his parents up with new jobs.\n\nHe then left for Canada. While there, former KGB agent and mutant telepath Elena Ivanova found him, demanding he helps her track down Sabretooth, who had killed her mother during his Weapon X years. Before he could answer her, they were attacked by Omega Red, who had tracked Ivanova to Maverick in hopes of recovering the carbonadium synthesizer. With the help of John Wraith, they succeeded in keeping the device away from the villain.\n\nIvanova felt that she owed Maverick and stuck by his side, despite his icy demeanor. They travelled together for a time. The Legacy Virus then took hold, killing North. Ivanova used her powers to resuscitate him. To their surprise, the virus seemingly went into remission, all of his wounds from the virus were healed. His powers not only returned but were enhanced. Also, Weapon X's memory implants were cleared from his mind. He would later realize that the Legacy Virus made his new powers inconsistent, at times making them a danger to himself. Immediately, trouble found them in the form of Russian mob boss Ivan Pushkin, who sent his enforcers Hammer and Sickle to abduct them.\n\nPushkin used Ivanova's powers in an attempt to brainwash Maverick into killing Major Arthur Barrington by making him believe it was Barrington who had set up Barsalini's betrayal all those years ago. In reality, Barrington was to deliver testimony at an inquest that would have been damaging to Pushkin's business interests. Attacking but not killing Barrington, Maverick quickly regained his senses. While he blinded the left eye of Sickle with his own weapon, Hammer killed Barrington.\n\nMeanwhile, Chris Bradley ran away from home, missing his girlfriend in New York. The FOH tapped his friends' phone and when he reached New York, they again tried to kill Chris. Maverick, Ivanova, and Wolverine saved him and his friend. Ivanova then used her abilities to make the FOH and Chris' girlfriend think he'd died in the scuffle. Both shaken by the life-threatening events of the past few days, Ivanova and North's relationship, platonic up to this point, became physical.\n\nThe following morning, Ivanova still expressed the desire to go after Sabretooth. Maverick harshly warned that an assault against Sabretooth was a fool's errand, and implied she'd slept with him to coerce him to aid her goal. Angered, Ivanova left Maverick that night to continue her vendetta. A regretful Maverick traced Ivanova's steps and found her as she was rendered comatose by Sabretooth's assault. Maverick stopped Sabretooth from delivering the killing blow and left a badly injured Ivanova in the care of the Bradley family.\n\nMaverick then renewed his vendetta with Ivan Pushkin, desperate to avenge Barrington's death. Pushkin captured Maverick, hoping to coerce Maverick to work for him. Maverick, however, freed himself and ruined Pushkin's attempted theft of a payload of A.I.M. weaponry. In the midst of this, Sickle gained a measure of revenge by gouging out Maverick's left eye and stranding him in the Swiss Alps \n\nThe Weapon X project was soon reinvigorated and having brought Sabretooth and Wraith back into the fold, they were sent to recruit Maverick. Wraith lured an unwitting Maverick into a rendezvous. Maverick refused to join, and a fierce battle ensued. Sabretooth caught Maverick off guard, impaling him in the chest then throwing him off the roof of a 20-story building and onto the street below.\nTaken to Weapon X near death, Malcolm Colcord again offered him the chance to join, as he could still be saved. This time, he reluctantly agreed, rationalizing it by saying he couldn't \"fight the good fight\" as a corpse. He was healed and then upgraded with the explicit intent of assassinating Wolverine. He has no scent, makes no sound thanks to a vibranium suit, possesses an enhanced healing factor, and a corrosive was added to his concussive blasts that hinder a foes' healing factor. In addition, he was equipped with a wide array of weapons, from wrist-mounted plasma blasters to an adamantium-coated knife. The world believed that North was dead, and he sought to keep it that way. He dyed his brown hair black and adopted the new alias Agent Zero. After sending him on a few simple missions, Colcord tried to break his will by sending him to kill Wolverine, a mission he purposely botched.\n\nFeeling guilty for joining the enemy, he contemplated suicide daily. His hatred for his teammate Sabretooth still ran deep, as he tried yet again to kill him, only to be stopped from dealing a fatal blow by the Director.\n\nDuring a mission, Agent Zero encountered a new Maverick, who unbeknownst to Zero, was Chris Bradley. Bradley had infiltrated a mutant terrorist group called Gene Nation in an effort to destroy them from inside. Bradley had wanted revenge on Weapon X for 'killing' North. To achieve that goal, he received training in black ops from Cable and assumed the Maverick mantle. Zero, believing this new Maverick was a terrorist, shot and killed him, only to find the truth as Bradley lay dying. Returning to the base after this occurred, Zero found Weapon X had disappeared without a trace. Zero then picked up Bradley's fight, attacking Gene Nation strongholds across the world and also searched for answers as to what happened to the program.\n\nIt was revealed that Zero doesn't know what happened to Weapon X was because he was being brainwashed by Mesmero as Zero had become increasingly harder to control. Zero had gone after Gene Nation because of Weapon X's instruction. Without realizing it, Zero served as executioner at Neverland, a mutant concentration camp set up by Weapon X. But as soon as Weapon X bothered to reveal these truths, they put him under again, and Zero went on, none the wiser.\n\nAgent Zero lost his powers on M-Day, as a result of Scarlet Witch's actions during the House of M. It has been revealed that he is among the mutants who have been depowered.\n\nNorth is seen residing in a center for former mutants and once again using the Maverick alias. Wolverine sought him out for information on carbonadium, reuniting the two and Jubilee. However, Omega Red soon attacked the building, looking for the carbonadium synthesizer.\n\nMaverick stole Weapon X files and sold them on the black market. In an effort to cover up his involvement in Kick-starting the Strikeforce X program from Wolverine, he killed the man to whom he sold the files.\n\nNorth's primary mutant power is an ability to absorb the kinetic energy generated by an impact without harm to himself. While there are limits to this power, North is able to survive falls from tremendous heights, energy blasts, and being struck by superhumanly strong foes without being injured.\n\nUpon accepting his first offer to work for the Weapon X Program, North is artificially granted a slight healing factor that allows him to recover from mild to moderate injuries much faster than a normal human. It also renders him immune to most diseases and toxins and also greatly suppressed his natural aging process. However, after contracting the Legacy Virus, his kinetic absorption ability is dramatically reduced in efficiency and his healing factor burns itself out while fighting the virus.\n\nAfter the virus claims his life and he is resuscitated by Elena Ivanova, the Legacy Virus immediately goes into remission and his kinetic absorption ability mutates. After absorbing energy, North must release the energy in the forms of powerful concussive or heat blasts. He can also channel the energy into physical attacks, increasing the physical force of his punches and kicks to superhuman levels.\n\nAfter being forced to join the Weapon X Program once again, North's kinetic absorption ability is artificially mutated further. Now, aside from channeling the energy to increase the strength of his physical attacks, North can expel a corrosive enzyme that is secreted from the tips of his fingers via his energy blasts. Aside from its acidic properties, the enzyme is specifically designed by the Weapon X Program to counteract the effects of an opponent's self-healing capabilities by reversing the process. The more an enemy's body attempts to heal itself from injuries sustained by the enzyme, the worse the injuries become. As a side effect of the procedure used to grant him this ability, North's body now possesses no discernible scent.\n\nCurrently, North possesses no superhuman powers. Like most of the world's mutant population, North has lost his mutant powers following the events of M-Day.\n\nNorth is a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant and covert operative. He is also an expert marksman, skilled in the use of virtually all types of firearms. He has also worn a variety of uniforms over the course of his career.\n\nThe costume he has worn for most of his mercenary career as Maverick is a suit of body armor consisting of lightweight fiberglass armor plating, a padded kevlar lining, and airtight seals or shields that allow him to seal the suit for further protection. His mask contained a limited oxygen supply as well as infrared scanning and targeting systems. The suit also harnessed a booster pack that could magnify the kinetic energy his body absorbed. Canadian inventor Isabel Ferguson is the primary source of his specialized gear.\n\nAs Agent Zero, North wears a body armor woven from vibranium, rendering him completely silent as he moves. It also refracts light which renders him practically invisible to conventional detection methods in total darkness.\n\nNorth has carried a wide array of weaponry including, but not limited to: thermite bombs, hydraulic bolt guns, titanium bullets, wrist-mounted projectile tasers, wrist-mounted plasma blasters, adamantium bullets, anti-metal bullets, and an adamantium-coated knife.\n\nAn alternate version of Maverick was revealed to exist in \"Exiles\" #62. Maverick was forced to join Weapon X, a group of reality-hopping people who had to kill people in order to save realities. Little is known about Maverick, except that he apparently was killed by the bladed shield of an alternate version of Captain America. For a time, the body was trapped in the Timebroker's Crystal Palace until the Exiles sent his body back home. On his homeworld of Earth-1287, Maverick was revealed to be an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. before his abduction, working alongside Nick Fury, who later honored his best agent by giving him a proper funeral.\n\nIn a possible future timeline (Earth-5700), Agent Zero joined a Wolverine-led version of the X-Men, teaming with Archangel, Juggernaut, Sunfire, Mystique, Aurora, and Deadpool. After a time, the Director activated Zero's embedded mental directive, and Zero, against his will, slaughtered the X-Men, except for Wolverine. Unable to bring himself to kill his friend and teammate, he fought the mind control just long enough to commit suicide.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the fourth theatrical feature film in the \"Lupin III\" franchise. The North American release was done by FUNimation; it was released individually and later made a part of the \"Final Haul\" box set.\n\nLupin the Third and Daisuke Jigen steal a diamond and hide it in a doll. Though Inspector Zenigata attempts to catch the two, he fails and they escape on an airplane. While on the plane, a little girl named Julia steals Lupin's doll. Lupin chases her and she leads him to Fujiko Mine, who is chaperoning her. Lupin tries to bargain with Fujiko in an effort to get the doll back, but their conversation is interrupted when the plane is hijacked.\n\nThe hijackers land the plane at a nearby airport and request transportation and a million dollar ransom in exchange for the women and children, as well as the Brazil National Football Team who also boarded the plane. While Fujiko and Julia are allowed to get off the plane, Lupin and Jigen must stay on with the hijackers. Meanwhile, a man named Chris watches the commotion from a distance and activates the bomb the hijackers have using his watch. When the bomb starts counting down, the hijackers become startled and Lupin, Jigen, and the rest of the passengers use this opportunity to fight back and escape from the plane.\n\nDuring the commotion, Zenigata arrives and makes another attempt to arrest Lupin and Jigen, but he becomes sidetracked when he tries to disarm the bomb. As Lupin and Jigen escape, Julia (still holding the doll) is kidnapped by Chris and his henchmen via helicopter. Fujiko then explains to Lupin and Jigen that Julia is the daughter of Douglas, a nominee for President of the United States and is worth $50,000,000. Meanwhile, a man named Rhisley, the head of a cult known as the Nostradamus Sect, speaks to a crowd of followers. He claims to have a book filled with the lost prophecies of Nostradamus and recites one of the verses which predicted the plane's hijacking.\n\nIn actuality, his book is a fake. The real one is in the safe on the top floor of the Earth Building, which belongs to Douglas. Fujiko reveals that she took the job of looking after Julia in order to break into the safe and steal the lost prophecies of Nostradamus. The three travel to the Earth Building and Fujiko meets with Douglas and his wife, Mary, to tell them that Julia has been kidnapped while Lupin and Jigen try to break into the vault. During all of this, Chris makes an appearance on TV and demands that Douglas drop out of the presidential race in exchange for Julia. Douglas refuses, saying that the kidnapping will lead to sympathy for his campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, Lupin and Jigen fail to open the vault and Fujiko is kidnapped by Chris. While driving through the city searching for Fujiko, Lupin and Jigen come across Goemon Ishikawa XIII and convince him to join them. Goemon agrees because he is also searching for the lost prophecies. Lupin then makes a plan to get himself arrested and sent to Execution Island, a prison where Lupin's Uncle Philip is kept in. He does this because Philip was the only person who managed to get inside the vault. During Lupin's stay, Chris and the Nostradamus Sect take Uncle Philip and use a machine to get inside his brain and extract the information on how to get into the vault. However, during the process, Philip dies. Lupin takes Philips body and discovers that one of his eyes is fake. He takes it out and keeps it as something to remember him by.\n\nAfter the mishap, Jigen and Goemon arrive in a helicopter and try to help Lupin escape, but Lupin is shot in the arm by Chris and falls into the ocean. The next day, Lupin wakes up on an island and is being nursed back to health by a boy named Sergio and his grandmother. While on the island, he discovers that Fujiko is there as well, but Sergio's grandmother says that she's really a handmaiden of the Nostradamus Sect named Tanya. Lupin follows Fujiko to a cathedral where the sect is located. When he sneaks in, he finds out that Julia is being kept prisoner there and Fujiko has lost her memory. Before he can find out anything else, Lupin is discovered by the sect and they throw them in a cell.\n\nMeanwhile, Jigen and Goemon believe that Lupin is dead and stake out a black market weapons shop, waiting for Chris. He shows up with some henchmen and they partake in a short battle. Jigen attempts to kill Chris, but he gets away. After the fight, Lupin contacts Jigen with a device hidden in his tooth. He informs Jigen that the Nostradamus Sect is connected to the kidnapping and that he is being held prisoner by them. While this is taking place, Julia cuts off a wrist band that Fujiko is wearing and her memories return. Chris then meets with Rhisley as their plan is revealed. As more people join the Nostradamus Sect, and their lies become the only truths, they plan to gain enough power to have the entire world bow down to them. Rhisley tells Chris that since Douglas won't back down, that Julia isn't of any use to them anymore.\n\nAn attempt on Julia's life is made, but Lupin, Fujiko, and Sergio help her escape. As the sect closes in on them, Jigen and Goemon arrive and get them all out of there via helicopter, but Julia is kidnapped once again. They make their way back to the States and try to come up with a plan to get into the vault. Lupin then recalls the fake eye he got from Uncle Philip and thinks that since the security system only recognizes the eyes of Douglas' immediate family, Philip must have used the eye to get into the vault. Meanwhile, the Brazilian Soccer Team is staying in the Earth Building when Chris uses his watch to activate the same wrist bands they're wearing that Fujiko had on earlier. The bands hypnotize them and they place several bombs throughout the building. Goemon discovers what's going on and informs the others about it.\n\nThe next day, Rhisley speaks to a crowd of people in front of the Earth Building and informs them that one of the verses states that the skyscraper will explode, leading to the many people inside to evacuate. During the commotion, Lupin, Jigen, Fujiko, and Goemon make another attempt to break into the vault. However, Chris goes against Rhisley's plan and enter the building to steal the lost prophecies of Nostradamus for himself. Rhisley chases him with a helicopter to stop him. Chris gets to the vault first and uses Julia to get inside, but the inside of the vault has a defense mechanism which creates the illusion that Chris is falling into an endless abyss. When Lupin and Jigen arrive, Julia gives them the prophecies of Nostradamus, but Rhisley meets them and threatens to kill them if they don't give him the prophecies.\n\nWhile Chris is still affected by the vault's illusion, he panics and activates the bombs with his watch. The building is severely damaged, but is still able to stand. Jigen, Goemon, and Fujiko are separated from Lupin and Julia, but Douglas gets parachutes to all of them and they plan to meet up at the bottom. However, the vault's illusion is disrupted and Chris comes to his senses and attacks Lupin and Julia. As the Earth Building continues to break apart, the vault collapses onto Chris, killing him. Lupin and Julia make their escape and Rhisley falls to his death.\n\nWhen the disaster is over, Julia is reunited with her family. As Lupin and the others make plans to sell the book of lost prophecies, Goemon discovers that Julia had doodled on several of the pages in the past, so no one would ever buy it. Realizing, that it's now useless, they destroy the book, but Julia returns the diamond to Lupin and they all watch as the Earth Building collapses.\n\n"}
{"id": "23004849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23004849", "title": "Film analysis", "text": "Film analysis\n\nFilm analysis is the process in which a film is analyzed in terms of mise-en-scène, cinematography, sound, and editing. One way of analyzing films is by the shot-by-shot analysis, though that is typically used only for small clips or scenes. Film analysis is closely connected to film theory.\n\nDifferent authors suggest various approaches to film analysis. Jacques Aumont and Michel Marie in their publication Analysis of Film propose several key points regarding film analysis. (1) There is general method of film analysis, (2) film analysis can never be concluded as there will always be something more to explore and (3) it is necessary for one to have knowledge about film history in order to perform a film analysis. They recognize various types of approaches: (1) Text-based film analysis (structural approach), (2) topic based analysis (narrative approach), (3) picture and sound approach (iconic analysis), (4) psychoanalytical approach and (5) historical approach.\n\nAnother methodology is suggested by Thomas and Vivian Sobchack in their publication Introduction to film. They suggest viewer can observe following elements: (1) analysis of film space, (2) analysis of film time and (3) film sound. As they focus mainly on iconic aspects of film they further propose additional elements: the image, tone, composition and movement.\n\nIconic analysis basically deals with image or picture (and sometimes also film sound). In iconic analysis we try to understand how different pictorial elements convey the meaning of film. There are several examples in film history where image was even more than just key element of film (i.e. pre WWII avant-garde films, Italian neorealism, film noir, etc.). However today in most narrative films (Fictional film) we try to hide pictorial elements from audience and mask them behind the story. In such films it is usually difficult (if not event pointless) to analyze image as such. We therefore more often tend to observe various other elements like light, camera movement (see Cinematography), composition etc. and try to understand how these elements influence or cross-reference other elements of film, like story, mood etc. As iconic analysis derives from single image and it is closely related to techniques of film production thus demanding at least brief understanding of these technical elements of film it is mostly useful method of research for film schools and other educational institutions. Film critics tend not use this method as a “stand alone” approach, but they rather use it as a part of other analysis method.\n\nSemiotics (also called semiotic studies and in the Saussurean tradition called semiology) is the study of meaning-making, the philosophical theory of signs and symbols. This includes the study of signs and sign processes (semiosis), indication, designation, likeness, analogy, metaphor, symbolism, signification, and communication. Semiotics is closely related to the field of linguistics, which, for its part, studies the structure and meaning of language more specifically. As different from linguistics, however, semiotics also studies non-linguistic sign systems. Semiotics often is divided into three branches:\nSemantics is the relation between signs and the things to which they refer; their \"denotata\", or meaning. Syntactics is relations among signs in formal structures. Pragmatics is the relation between signs and sign-using agents.\n\nAncient Greek philosophy's \"overturning of mythology\" as a definition to understanding of the heightened aesthetic. For Plato, Eros takes an almost transcendent manifestation when the subject seeks to go beyond itself and form a communion with the objectival other: \"the true order of going...to the things of love, is to use the beauties of earth as steps...to all fair forms, and from fair forms to fair actions, and from fair actions to fair notions, until from fair notions he arrives at the notion of absolute beauty\".\n\nThis is a written description of a given sequence in a film in order of the shots. According to Michael Ryan and Melissa Lenos, when doing shot-by-shot analysis, we start with describing the techniques used in the shots or images we are analyzing. After that, we also need to elaborate what effects these techniques can produce when viewing the movie; for example, camera leads what we see in the film so the changes in camera angles have impact on audience's interpretations of the meanings the movie tries to convey. Some of the techniques used in film producing could be composition (foreground/background, frame/raming, etc.), cinematography (close-up, medium shot and long shot, pan shot, tilt shot, etc.), editing (montage, eyeline match, etc.), and so on.\n\nA number of varied film analysis approaches have emerged and gained popularity on the internet such as those by Red Letter Media and Rob Ager. In 2012 Room 237, a documentary showcasing a variety of such interpretations of Stanley Kubrick's horror film The Shining, was screened at the Cannes Film Festival and generated wide media coverage followed by a distribution deal. The film has since generated considerable comment and debate from film critics and film communities.\n\n\n"}

After being instructed in the Delsarte system by a drama teacher in Chicago, Frances was invited to join the touring company of famed Shakespearean actress Julia Marlowe. In 1898 she made her Broadway debut with Miss Marlowe at the Knickerbocker Theatre in New York, and subsequently appeared in numerous productions in New York and London. \n\nAfter eleven years of acting, she joined her mother in Paris, where they enjoyed the company of performers and composers such as Enrico Caruso, Sarah Bernhardt and Camille Saint-Saens. Frances began her teaching career in Paris, and during World War I, she volunteered her services to teach wounded soldiers how to regain the use of damaged lungs. \n\nShortly after the end of the war, mother and daughter moved to New York City, where Frances established herself as a leading voice teacher, whose many famous pupils included Mary McCormic, Dorothy Gish, Helen Hayes, Kenneth MacKenna, Catherine Calvert, Ina Claire, Miriam Hopkins, Ruth Chatterton, Mary Pickford, Clark Gable, Norma Shearer, and Katharine Hepburn.\n\nThe Robinson-Duff approach to voice training involved elaborate vocal and breathing exercises focused on the use of the diaphragm, a method humorously recounted by Hepburn (who never mastered it) in her autobiography, \"Me: Stories of My Life\" (1991).\n"}

The term was coined by Erik Satie in 1917.\n\nAlthough other selections of Erik Satie's music can be experienced (and are sometimes indicated) as furniture music, Satie himself applied the name only to five short pieces, composed in three separate sets:\nThe first set was apparently never performed (nor the score published) during Satie's lifetime.\n\nThe second set contained reminiscences of popular tunes by, amongst others, Camille Saint-Saëns and Ambroise Thomas. It was premiered in Paris the year it was composed, as intermission music to a lost comedy by Max Jacob. During these intermissions the audience was invited to visit an exposition of children's drawings in the Galerie Barbazanges that was hosting the premiere.\n\nIndications of the intentions of the artists giving the first performance are found in the manuscript of the score:\n\nFurnishing divertissement organised by the group of musicians known as the \"Nouveaux Jeunes\"\n\nFurnishing music replaces \"waltzes\" and \"operatic fantasias\" etc. Don't be confused! \"It's something else!!!\" No more \"false music\"\n\nFurnishing music completes one's property;\n\nit's new; it doesn't upset customs; it isn't tiring; it's French; it won't wear out; it \"isn't boring\"\n\n\"--quoted in Gillmor, 1988, p 325-326\"\nSee also the Entr'acte article for more details regarding the circumstances of this first, and only documented, public performance of furniture music during Satie's lifetime, assisted by the composer himself.\n\nThe separate commissioned piece was sent to America. There are no known public performances or publications of this music prior to leaving the European continent. This piece is sometimes presented as \"furniture music No. 3\".\n\nAs Satie's pieces of furniture music were very short pieces, with an indefinite number of repeats, this kind of furniture music later became associated with repetitive music (sometimes used as a synonym of minimal music), but this kind of terminology did not yet exist in Satie's time.\n\nFor a quarter of a century after the composer's death, all of the furniture music pieces remained hidden from the general public, apart from being mentioned in early Satie biographies. By the end of the 1960s parts of the furniture music started to appear as facsimile illustrations to press articles and new Satie biographies. The first full publication of sets 1 and 3 followed in the early 1970s. There was no full publication of the 2nd set before the last years of the 20th century.\n\nSeveral decades after Satie's death, furniture music was revived, largely due to the American composer John Cage, as the composer's theory of minimalist background music. Furniture music appeared as the launchpad for minimalist/experimental/avant-garde music since it was the first instance of music being played or produced out of context: not as a centerpiece but as a cerebral backdrop.\n\nThese and other related ideas were picked up by several composers of the neo-Classical/20th Century school of music, accentuating atmosphere and texture over traditional form and movement. The minimalist references and anachronisms were not solidified until composer John Cage performed Satie's \"hidden\" piece \"Vexations\" 840 times as requested by Satie's own scribbled notes on the original sheet music.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "63743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63743", "title": "Jean Anouilh", "text": "Jean Anouilh\n\nJean Marie Lucien Pierre Anouilh (; 23 June 1910 – 3 October 1987) was a French dramatist whose career spanned five decades. Though his work ranged from high drama to absurdist farce, Anouilh is best known for his 1944 play \"Antigone\", an adaptation of Sophocles' classical drama, that was seen as an attack on Marshal Pétain's Vichy government. One of France's most prolific writers after World War II, much of Anouilh's work deals with themes of maintaining integrity in a world of moral compromise.\n\nAnouilh was born in Cérisole, a small village on the outskirts of Bordeaux, and had Basque ancestry. His father, François Anouilh, was a tailor, and Anouilh maintained that he inherited from him a pride in conscientious craftmanship. He may owe his artistic bent to his mother, Marie-Magdeleine, a violinist who supplemented the family's meager income by playing summer seasons in the casino orchestra in the nearby seaside resort of Arcachon. Marie-Magdeleine worked the night shifts in the music-hall orchestras and sometimes accompanied stage presentations, affording Anouilh ample opportunity to absorb the dramatic performances from backstage. He often attended rehearsals and solicited the resident authors to let him read scripts until bedtime. He first tried his hand at playwriting here, at the age of 12, though his earliest works do not survive.\n\nIn 1918 the family moved to Paris where the young Anouilh received his secondary education at the Lycée Chaptal. Jean-Louis Barrault, later a major French director, was a pupil there at the same time and recalls Anouilh as an intense, rather dandified figure who hardly noticed a boy some two years younger than himself. He earned acceptance into the law school at the Sorbonne but, unable to support himself financially, he left after just 18 months to seek work as a copywriter at the advertising agency Publicité Damour. He liked the work, and spoke more than once with wry approval of the lessons in the classical virtues of brevity and precision of language he learned while drafting advertising copy.\n\nAnouilh's financial troubles continued after he was called up to military service in 1929. Supported by only his meager conscription salary, Anouilh married the actress Monelle Valentin in 1931. Though Valentin starred in many of his plays, Anouilh's daughter Caroline (from his second marriage), claims that the marriage was not a happy one. Anouilh's youngest daughter Colombe even claims that there was never an official marriage between Anouilh and Valentin. She allegedly had multiple extramarital affairs, which caused Anouilh much pain and suffering. The infidelity weighed heavily on the dramatist as a result of the uncertainty about his own parentage. According to Caroline, Anouilh had learned that his mother had had a lover at the theatre in Arcachon who was actually his biological father. In spite of this, Anouilh and Valentin had a daughter, Catherine, in 1934 who followed the pair into theatre work at an early age. Anouilh's growing family placed further strain on his already limited finances. Determined to break into writing full-time, he began to write comic scenes for the cinema to supplement their income.\n\nAt the age of 25, Anouilh found work as a secretary to the French actor and director Louis Jouvet at the Comédie des Champs-Elysées. Though Anouilh's boss had happily lent him some of the set furniture left over from the production of Jean Giraudoux's play \"Siegfried\" to furnish his modest home, the director was not interested in encouraging his assistant's attempts at playwriting. Jouvet had risen to fame in the early 1930s through his collaborations with the playwright Giraudoux, and together the two worked to shift focus from the authorial voice of the director (which had dominated the French stage since the early twentieth century) back to the playwright and his text.\n\nGiraudoux was an inspiration to Anouilh and, with the encouragement of the acclaimed playwright, he began writing again in 1929. Before the end of the year he made his theatrical debut with \"Humulus le muet\", a collaborative project with Jean Aurenche. It was followed by his first solo projects, \"L'Hermine\" (\"The Ermine\") in 1932 and \"Mandarine\" in 1933, both produced by Aurélien Lugné-Poe, an innovative actor and stage manager who was then head of the Théâtre de l'Œuvre. Ruled by the philosophy, \"the word creates the decor,\" Lugné-Poe let Anouilh's lyrical prose shine in front of a backdrop of simple compositions of line and color that created a unity of style and mood.\n\nThe plays were not great successes, closing after 37 and 13 performances respectively, but Anouilh persevered, following it up with a string of productions, most notably \"Y'avait un prisonnier\" (1935). These works, most in collaboration with the experimental Russian director Georges Pitoëff, were considered promising despite their lack of commercial profits, and the duo continued to work together until they had their first major success in 1937 with \"Le voyageur sans bagage\" (\"Traveller Without Luggage\"). In subsequent years, there was rarely a season in Paris that did not prominently feature a new Anouilh play and many of these were also being exported to England and America. After 1938, however, much of Anouilh's later work was directed by the prominent Paris scenic designer André Barsacq, who had taken over as director of the Théâtre de l'Atelier after Charles Dullin's retirement in 1940. Barsacq was a champion for Anouilh and their affiliation was a major factor in the playwright's continued success after the war.\n\nIn the 1940s, Anouilh turned from contemporary tales to more mythical, classic, and historic subjects. With protagonists who asserted their independence from the fated past, themes during this period are more closely related to the existential concerns of such writers as Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. The most famous play of this group is \"Antigone\", which \"established Anouilh as a leading dramatist, not only because of the power with which he drew the classic confrontation between the uncompromising Antigone and the politically expedient Creon, but also because French theatre-goers under the occupation read the play as a contemporary political parable.\" His post-war plays dealt with similar concerns and included \"Roméo et Jeannette\", \"Médée\" (\"Medea\"), and Anouilh's Joan of Arc story \"L'Alouette\" (\"The Lark\"), which, in its distinct optimism, rivalled the commercial success of \"Antigone\".\n\nAnouilh himself grouped his plays of this period on the basis of their dominant tone, publishing his later works in collected volumes to reflect what he felt \"represented the phases of his evolution and loosely resembled the distinction between comedy and tragedy.\" \"Pièces noires\" or \"Black plays\" were tragedies or realistic dramas and included \"Antigone\", \"Jézabel\", and \"La Sauvage\" (\"The Restless Heart\"). This category typically featured \"young, idealistic, and uncompromising protagonists [who] are able to maintain their integrity only by choosing death.\" By contrast, Anouilh's \"pièces roses\" or \"pink plays\" were comedies where fantasy dominated with an atmosphere similar to that of fairy tales. In these plays such as \"Le Bal des voleurs\" (\"Carnival of Thieves\"), \"Le Rendez-vous de Senlis\" (\"Dinner with the Family\") and \"Léocadia\" (\"Time Remembered\"), the focus is on \"the burden of the environment and especially of the past on a protagonist seeking a happier, freer existence.\"\n\nMost of Anouilh's plays of the late 1940s and into the 1950s become darker and distinctly cruel and, in contrast with his earlier works, begin to feature middle-aged characters who must view life more practically than Anouilh's former idealistic youths. The playwright divided the works of this period into \"pièces brillantes\" (\"brilliant plays\") and \"pièces grinçantes\" (\"grating plays\"). The first group includes works such as \"L'Invitation au château\" (Ring Round the Moon) and \"Colombe\", and are typified by aristocratic settings and witty banter. The grating plays like \"La Valse des toréadors\" (\"Waltz of the Toreadors\") and \"Le Réactionnaire amoureux\" (\"The Fighting Cock\") are more bitterly funny, trading clever word play for a darker tone of disillusionment.\n\nAnother category Anouilh specifies are his \"pièces costumées\" (\"costume plays\") which include \"The Lark\", \"La Foire d'Empoigne\" (\"Catch as Catch Can\"), and \"Becket\", an international success, depicting the historical martyr Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who sought to defend the church against the monarch (and his friend), Henry II of England, who had appointed him to his see. So classified because they share historical \"costumed\" settings, Anouilh also specifies that these plays must also prominently feature an enlightened protagonist seeking \"a moral path in a world of corruption and manipulation.\"\n\nAnouilh's final period begins with \"La Grotte\" (\"The Cavern\"), in which he comments on his own progress as a writer and a theatre artist. The central character is a playwright suffering from writer's block who in his frustration recalls the foibles of Luigi Pirandello's \"Six Characters in Search of an Author\". Anouilh's work had always contained hints of metatheatricality, or commentary on the business of theatre within the world of the play, but in his late works these structures became more fully developed as he begins to write primarily about character who are dramatists or theatre directors. There is also a pronounced link, during this time, of Anouilh's emphasis of theatre and the family, displaying intimate relationships that are \"more profound and more important than the traditional heightened action of 'theatre' \". Antoine, the playwright-protagonist of \"Cher Antoine; ou, L'Amour raté\" (\"Dear Antoine; or, The Love That Failed\"), asserts that the world must take notice of these \"pièces secrètes\" (secret dramas) and Anouilh scholars have proposed this name, \"pièces secrètes\", to classify the collected works of his latest period.\"\n\nAnouilh remained staunchly apolitical for most of his life and career. He served in the military during at least two periods, having been drafted into the French Army in 1931 and 1939. He was a prisoner of war for a short time when the Germans conquered France and willingly lived and worked in Paris during the subsequent German occupation. Because he refused to take sides during France's collaboration with the Axis Alliance some critics have branded him as a potential Nazi sympathiser. This controversy escalated as a result of Anouilh's public clashes with leader of the Free French Forces (and later President of the Fifth Republic), General Charles de Gaulle. In the mid-1940s Anouilh and several other intellectuals signed a petition for clemency to save the writer Robert Brasillach, who was condemned to death for being a Nazi collaborator. Brasillach was executed by firing squad in February 1945, despite the outcry from Anouilh and his peers that the new government had no right to persecute individuals for \"intellectual crimes\" in the absence of military or political action. Nevertheless, Anouilh refused to comment on his political views, writing in a letter to the Belgian critic Hubert Gignoux in 1946, \"I do not have a biography and I am very happy about it. The rest of my life, as long as God wills it, will remain my personal business, and I will withhold the details of it.\"\nAnouilh's plays provide the most important clues about his political point of view, though their reputation for ambiguity further complicates the matter. For instance \"Antigone\", provides an allegorical representation of the debate between the idealistic members of the French Resistance and the pragmatism of the collaborationists. Though many have read the play as having a strong anti-Nazi sentiment, the fact that the Vichy Regime allowed the piece to be performed without censure testifies to the fact that it was potentially seen as supportive of the occupation in its time. Though the playwright romanticizes Antigone's sense of honor and duty to what is morally right, in this case resisting the Nazi forces, it can also be said that Anouilh, like Sophocles before him, makes a convincing argument for Creon's method of leadership.\n\nIn 1970 his work was recognized with the \"Prix mondial Cino Del Duca\". In 2012, the Nobel Records were opened after 50 years and it was revealed that Anouilh was among a shortlist of authors considered for the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature, along with John Steinbeck (winner), Robert Graves, Lawrence Durrell and Karen Blixen. According to a report in \"The Guardian\", \"It is not clear why Anouilh was passed over, but the French poet Saint-John Perse had taken the Nobel in 1960, meaning that France was well represented on the roster of winners, and \"Svenska Dagbladet\" reveals that Jean-Paul Sartre, who won the prize in 1964, was starting to be seriously considered as a candidate.\"\n\nIn 1980, he was the first recipient of the Grand Prix du Théâtre de l'Académie française established that year.\n\nBy the end of his career, Anouilh's reputation outstripped all his contemporaries. However, his repertoire remained unusually confined to theatre and film. Most French dramatists of the 1930s and 1940s, including Anouilh's most significant contemporary influence, Giraudoux, not only wrote for the stage but also composed poetry, novels, or essays. Nevertheless, he remained prolific, consistently producing and publishing performance works for more than fifty years.\n\nAnouilh's early works were \"naturalistic studies of a sordid and corrupt world.\" Many of these plays present the reader with the striking and inescapable dichotomy between pragmatism and a sort of transcendent idealism. There is little to no \"middle ground of ambiguity\" that exists where this conflict asserts itself. This is evidenced in \"Le Voyageur Sans Bagage.\" The main character Gaston, a World War I veteran who suffers from amnesia, cannot remember the moral depravity of his youth (he slept with his brother's wife and severely injured his best friend). This checkered past is invariably at odds with the near-angelic behavior that he now exhibits, and recognition of this truth forces him to leave his former identity behind, unable to reconcile the two sides of himself. In denouncing his past, Gaston reclasses his freedom as an illusion, but one of his own making. He befriends a young English boy and shows him his identifying scar; this gesture allows the boy to describe Gaston to the authorities, thereby claiming him as kin. With a new life and a new family, Gaston has a fresh start. David I. Grossvogel, describes this situation as the \"restoration of a childhood paradise lost,\" attributing \"Le Voyageur Sans Bagage\" as the beginning of Anouilh's search to justify the unhappiness of his youth. Theatre historian Marvin Carlson agrees, noting that this play epitomizes the \"complex tonality and deft dramatic technique\" that remained throughout his work, though, he asserts, it was only as the playwright matured that his \"dark view of the human condition [reached] its final expression.\"\n\nAnouilh disagreed with these somber readings of his best works, however, arguing that, like all great French literature, his plays had found ways to laugh at misfortune. \"Thanks to Molière,\" Anouilh said, \"the true French theatre is the only one that is not gloomy, in which we laugh like men at war with our misery and our horror. This humor is one of France's messages to the world.\"\n\nDisclosing his thoughts on French theatre and his personal perspective as a playwright, he said that the perception of his work was often misguided:\n\nIn the 1950s, Anouilh examined his antagonism with General de Gaulle in \"L'Hurluberlu, ou Le Reactionnaire amoureux\" (1958) and \"Le Songe du critique\" (1960). He began to lose the favor of audiences and critics alike, however, with the emergence of such playwrights as Eugène Ionesco and Samuel Beckett. Though he shared with these authors a \"similar desperate vision of human existence,\" these new absurdist theatres' pursuit of alternative dramaturgies made Anouilh's semi-realistic plays seem dull and old-fashioned. In the 1980s Anouilh reinvented himself as a director, staging his own plays as well as those of other authors. He died of a heart attack in Lausanne, Switzerland on 3 October 1987. By then divorced from Monelle Valentin, he was survived by his second wife, Nicole Lançon, and four children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "982687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=982687", "title": "Krona (comics)", "text": "Krona (comics)\n\nKrona is a fictional character that appears in comic books published by DC Comics.\n\nKrona first appeared in \"Green Lantern\" Vol. 2 #40 (Oct. 1965) and was created by writer John Broome and artist Gil Kane.\n\nBorn on Maltus, Krona is an Oan scientist who became obsessed with observing the origins of the universe itself, despite an ancient legend that said discovering that secret would cause a great calamity. Krona constructs a machine that pierces the temporal barrier and views the beginnings of time itself. Krona catches a glimpse of the hand of creation depositing the speck that would become the entire cosmos. His machine explodes at that instant, and the universe is shattered causing the creation of the Multiverse as the universe replicates into an infinite number of parallel universes. At this same moment, the Anti-Matter Universe is created, unleashing evil into the cosmos; thus, the Monitor and the Anti-Monitor are born. As punishment for this act, Krona is transformed into pure energy by his fellow Oans and is sent to forever wander the cosmos. Krona's actions are what caused the Oans to become the Guardians of the Universe.\n\nKrona returns to a physical state using the energies of Alan Scott's mystical power ring, but is again turned into his energy form by the Guardians. Krona is finally restored to his original form thanks to Nekron—who gained additional power due to the anomaly of an immortal entering the realm of the dead when the Guardians kill him—and attempts to kill all of the Guardians, only to be narrowly defeated by the weakened Green Lantern Corps.\n\nKrona later resurfaces as the manifestation of Entropy itself and battles the New Guardians.\n\nWhile trying to discover the secret of universal creation, Krona destroys entire universes, eventually arriving in the Marvel Universe. There he confronts the Grandmaster, who, in an attempt to save his universe, informs Krona of the existence of a being in the Marvel Universe who has witnessed the Big Bang. In exchange for Krona not destroying this universe, the Grandmaster and he will play a game; two teams, one from each universe, seek out 12 items of great power, six from each universe. Should Krona's team (the Avengers) win, Grandmaster will give the knowledge Krona seeks in return for not destroying his universe. But when Grandmaster's team (the Justice League) wins—thanks in part to Batman, Captain America and the Atom having discovered the nature of the game in time to ensure that the League win instead of declaring a draw—Krona strikes down the Grandmaster in a rage, draining his knowledge to learn the identity of the being he spoke of, allowing him to summon Galactus. He then repeats the process with Galactus, but the Grandmaster tricks him and uses the power of the items to lock Krona at the multiversal junction point, having linked the two universes together.\n\nThe Grandmaster's hopes are dashed, though, when it becomes evident Krona would continue even in his extremely dangerous location in his insane quest to view the birth of a universe despite the risks posed to himself. Even from there, he continued his onslaught to destroy both the Marvel and DC universes in order to create a new one, so that he could watch creation first-hand. He forces them closer together, causing reality to warp wildly, and even making items and people switch worlds. He is briefly disrupted by the efforts of the Scarlet Witch and Green Lantern, but then continues his experiments. After being told what has happened by a dying Grandmaster, the two teams get to Krona's stronghold, led by Captain America and coordinated by the Martian Manhunter, pitting them against various brainwashed villains and increasing the scale of his 'recruits' as the heroes defeat each wave. He nearly kills all of both teams as they penetrate his final wave of defences—even with Superman wielding Captain America's shield and Thor's hammer— but Hawkeye and the Flash (Barry Allen), who had earlier faked their deaths, stop his plan, Hawkeye firing a TNT arrow at Krona's machinery. The blast was immense, and ended up sucking Krona into the universe seed called the Cosmic Egg. The Spectre then pushes the worlds apart and reality returns to normal.\n\nThis egg is kept and studied in the JLA headquarters. Its fluctuations are a matter of intense scrutiny in the \"Syndicate Rules\" storyline, during which it is speculated that the reconstruction of the universes also altered the original 'rules' that allowed the League and the Syndicate to always win on their home ground, requiring each to fight harder in the future. After the League believes they have the situation under control, they implement tighter scans on the egg, to register alarms at even the most minor of fluctuations. At the end of the storyline, the New God Metron places several devices around the egg, so as to feed false readings to the League and to let the egg develop without interference.\n\nThe Cosmic Egg is taken by Despero in the Trinity series. It is used by Despero, Morgaine le Fey and Enigma to create powerful monsters, and was later used in a ritual to reshape the world. In the aftermath of these events, Krona is freed. He recruits some Controllers in an attempt to communicate with the consciousness of the universe, but is double-crossed by them, who attempt to absorb and study his energies. In retaliation, Krona destroys them and their lab planet, only to hear the planet's consciousness \"freed\" from its \"prison\". Krona then sets out to do the same for many other planets.\n\nKrona is later approached by Morgaine and her allies, seeking his power to fend off the returned Trinity (Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman). Morgaine offers the planet Earth's consciousness in return, intending to replace it with the soul of Enigma's daughter.\n\nKrona accepts and a lengthy battle ensues between him, the JLA, JSA, Titans, Teen Titans, the God-like trinity consisting of Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman, and other various heroes, aliens and villains. During the height of the battle Krona is imprisoned due to the united efforts of several heroes and villains, but is set free by Morgaine, finally snapped, claiming that if she cannot have the world, then nobody shall. Following that, Krona unleashes his powers and destroys the Earth.\n\nMoments after Earth's destruction he encounters its essence, the Worldsoul, which continuously alters its form between a little girl, an adult woman and an old hag. Krona inquires about the law of universes, wishing to know how the Worldsoul and other entities like it function and exist, hoping to learn of some higher plan or design. However, he is horrified to learn that the Worldsoul has no actual function other than to simply exist, resonate and, most importantly, to \"feel\", to share in the positive emotions of every lifeform that dwells upon its surface, at one with the Universe in a Great Dance with the other souls of worlds. This explanation, such as it is, defies all logic and science Krona has studied, and he believes this renders himself and his entire life, in effect, pointless. In a fit of rage, he attempts to destroy the Worldsoul, but is stopped by the Trinity, who have survived the destruction of Earth. Combining their powers with that of the Worldsoul, they imprison Krona and reform the Earth, restoring everything and everyone to the way it was prior to its destruction, even the supervillains of the planet. Krona's ultimate fate was to be remade as the Worldsoul of Earth-1, this time imprisoned for all eternity.\n\nAfter the events of the \"Blackest Night\", a cloaked stranger appears on Ryut, walking near an ancient temple with seven pillars marked with the symbols of the Emotional Spectrum and plotting against the Lantern Corps.\n\nThe first act of this stranger's plan occurs with the abduction of the fear entity, Parallax, during the finale of \"Blackest Night\", imprisoning the creature within the pillar marked with the symbol of the Sinestro Corps. He then proceeds to remove the willpower entity, Ion, from Sodam Yat, effectively turning Daxam's sun from yellow back to red and killing hundreds of Daxamites in the process, and later helps Hector Hammond get out of prison, to pursue the Avarice Entity which is trapped inside Larfleeze's lantern.\n\nThe stranger is also shown working with Hank Henshaw (Cyborg Superman), telling him that enslaving and altering the qualities of the Alpha Lanterns will restore his mortality. He is also shown working with the telepathic Zardor in his plot to brainwash rookie members of the Green Lantern Corps that will lead to the destruction of the Green Lantern Corps.\n\nThe stranger also freed Lyssa Drak from the Book of the Black, and informs her that her assistance is required since another book will soon be made and a keeper is needed.\n\nThe stranger later appears on the Eastern Seaboard of the United States—with an obedient Parallax in tow—where he faces Hal Jordan, Nicole Morrison, Larfleeze, Saint Walker and the Indigo Tribe, seeking to obtain both the hope entity, Adara, and the compassion entity, Proselyte, for his collection.\n\nWhen the figure captures the entities by ripping Proselyte and Adara from their hosts, he is confronted by Jordan. The figure finally reveals himself as Krona, the rogue Guardian, long believed dead – the bandages serving to help restore his body after the damage he has sustained in his previous encounters – and tells that prior to his banishment by the Guardians, he was the caretaker responsible for protecting the entities, which explains how he's aware of the orange power of avarice and its location as revealed during Hal Jordan's first encounter with Larfleeze, and that is why he can control them and the abilities they possess.\n\nDespite the combined efforts of the New Guardians (sans Sinestro and Carol Ferris), Krona still managed to overwhelm them with the assistance of Ophidian. Immobilized by Ophidian's disruptive powers, Krona discovered the location of the Butcher from the avarice entity, and expunged it from Atrocitus's power battery. As Hal struggled with his defiance, Krona unleashed the power of all of the entities, effectively defeating the New Guardians. Having no other reason for staying on Earth, Krona left with the entities in tow.\n\nLater as Hal Jordan, Larfleeze, Atrocitus, Saint Walker, Indigo-1 and a returned Sinestro tried to reach Zamaron, since the entity of love was the only one still free, they found instead a delusioned Carol Ferris who tells them that Krona had captured the Predator. Through Indigo-1 they follow Krona to the Dead Planet of Ryut where they found the Book of the Black, which after detecting the presence of the \"New Guardians\" opened its pages to unveil the history of Krona, revealing that it was Krona that was responsible for the Manhunters' programming glitch, which resulted in the annihilation of Sector 666. He did it to prove that there were flaws in an emotionless police force. He was also the one who created a gauntlet that harnessed Willpower which was the basis for the Green Lantern Power Ring. When he became the keeper of the emotional entities, he used the gauntlet to harness their powers and named it the Gauntlet of Power, since it could harness all emotions.\n\nIn the \"War of the Green Lanterns\", Krona, along with the emotional entities, launched an attack on Oa, attacking the six remaining Guardians (with Ganthet working in the Anti-Matter universe at the time), by having them possessed by all the entities, except for Parallax, who is placed inside the Central Power Battery. With the yellow impurity returned to the Central Power Battery, all of the Green Lanterns—even the experienced wielders, with the apparent exception of the Green Lanterns who had been possessed by Parallax before—are placed under Krona's control, revealing that they could not overcome the fear associated with it as the Guardians had thought. Even the Alpha Lanterns are affected by the yellow impurity which made them enter into some kind of hibernation. The former Guardian then declares that he will show the universe the true power of the Green Lanterns. However, despite his attempts to stop them by using Mogo against them, Hal Jordan, John Stewart, Guy Gardner and Kyle Rayner are able to escape Krona and fight back by using the rings of the other Corps— Hal wielding a Sinestro and an Orange ring, Guy a Red and a Star Sapphire, Kyle a Blue, and John an Indigo— to escape Parallax's influence long enough to kill Mogo and extract Parallax from the Power Battery. Undaunted, Krona uses all seven varieties of power ring at once, attacking Hal Jordan and the freed Sinestro (who had just been selected by another green ring). Despite his greater power, Krona is eventually killed by Hal Jordan. Afterwards, the Guardians of the Universe then wish to honor the fallen Guardian by putting him in the crypt on Oa, along with other dead Lanterns. Many Lanterns disagree with their decision and journey to the Crypt where they encounter Salaak creating a space for Krona. Later, Ganthet honors his promise to Atrocitus and gives Krona's corpse to him to do as he wishes.\n\nFollowing the \"War of the Green Lanterns\", it is revealed that Atrocitus has kept Krona's corpse as a 'confidant', talking to the body when he needs to give voice to his feelings about the Red Lantern Corps and his plans to upgrade their intelligence. However, after granting intellects to three Red Lanterns, Atrocitus returns to the place where he has left Krona's body only to find it gone. Although Atrocitus attempts to find Krona's body, he is left to consider both the worrying possibility that Krona has come back to life, when faced with a revolt from Bleez, Atrocitus starts to wonder if the loss of Krona's body has robbed him of the focus of his rage, as he has begun to try and justify his actions where he previously considered his mere identity enough of a justification. Krona's body, however, is found to be possessed by Abysmus, a demonic entity created by the earliest experiments of Atrocitus with shamanistic and necromantic magic, who willingly ate his body and flayed his skin to empower himself and a race of similar creatures, the so-called Abysmorphs.\n\nFollowing the events of 'Rise of the Third Army', in the opening of 'Wrath of the First Lantern', it is revealed that Krona's history has been changed: although he attempted to observe the beginning of the universe, the cosmos-spanning hand now bears a Lantern Power ring and when the viewscreen explodes, it is because a time-travelling ship has just arrived. From the ship, appears the mysterious Volthoom. During a conversation with Atrocitus, Krona's spirit-which manifests as a result of Abysmus's manipulations-claims that he became caught up in his work after his wives and child were killed in an accident, but Atrocitus dismisses the idea that this excuses his later actions; moments later, the newly freed Volthoom disperses Krona's spirit, apparently ending the last remnants of his existence.\n\nIt was also revealed that Krona's banishment from the Guardians of the Universe was not from the result of his machinations, but because he issued the order to the Manhunters to destroy Sector 666.\n\nA very alive Krona later finds John Stewart, Kilowog, Arisia, Two-Six and new Lantern Xrill-Vrek in a seeming hostile territory, long way from home. Given that this Krona is back to his Maltusan look, does not recognize any of the Green Lanterns and that the Green Lantern rings cannot locate anyone or the Central Power Battery, provides a little clue as to what has happened. Either they have been displaced to another universe, another time, or both.\n\nKrona possesses a supreme genius-level intellect, but his arrogance, lack of patience, short temper and above all insatiable hunger for knowledge have gotten the better of him. If it brought him any benefit, he would be the sort to attempt to quantify dance or measure a soul, solely for the sake of knowing. It is this madness that got Krona exiled and brought about his constant defeats. He has unhesitatingly destroyed universes and risked his own existence for a chance to gain deeper insight.\n\nLike the rest of his species, Krona possesses enhanced physical abilities, vast psionic powers (including telepathy and telekinesis) and virtual immortality (he does not need to breathe, eat or sleep, and can regenerate from any injury at an accelerated rate). His powers were later increased by Nekron, making him more powerful than any of the Guardians.\n\nAs Entropy, Krona was composed of anti-energy, could absorb others into his body, converting them into more anti-energy, and was able to create an army composed of anti-energy that were completely under his control. During the \"JLA/Avengers\" miniseries, where he wielded the power of all the universes he had previously destroyed, Krona proved able to easily defeat both the Grandmaster and Galactus, although the Grandmaster's power was sufficient to make him initially hesitant at the prospect of fighting the other being until his attempt to beat the Grandmaster in a game to gain the information he sought failed.\n\nAlso, as the caretaker of the Emotional entities which are the pure embodiments of the emotions comprising the Emotional Spectrum, Krona wields the powers of the entire emotional spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7542164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7542164", "title": "Little Jimmy", "text": "Little Jimmy\n\nLittle Jimmy, originally titled Jimmy, was a newspaper comic strip created by Jimmy Swinnerton. With a publication history from February 14, 1904, to 1958, it was one of the first continuing features and one of the longest running.\n\nThe title character was a little boy who was constantly forgetting what he was supposed to do and ended up getting into trouble. As comics historian Don Markstein described:\nThe strip first appeared sporadically in\" The New York Journal\". It soon became a regular in the Sunday comics section and was picked up as a feature in other newspapers owned by William Randolph Hearst. When King Features Syndicate was created in 1915, \"Little Jimmy\" went into nationwide syndication. In 1920, a daily strip was added and ran until the late 1930s. The Sunday strip continued until Swinnerton retired in 1958.\n\nMarkstein noted that Swinnerton \"drew his strip in a clear, open style, unlike most cartoonists of his time. In this, he anticipated dominant styles of the 20th century, less crowded and more easily read — quite appropriate for newsprint production, where the printing isn't always as clear as it should be.\"\n\nLittle Jimmy appeared in silent film animation and later in the 1936 Betty Boop film \"Betty Boop and Little Jimmy\".\n\nLittle Jimmy Camp in the Angeles National Forest, near Los Angeles, California, is named after the comic strip in honor of Swinnerton, who once stayed there.\n\n"}

The park was either named after the fanciful airship Luna, part of the new park's central attraction A Trip to the Moon, or after Dundy's sister. Luna Park was a vastly expanded attraction built partly on the grounds of Sea Lion Park, the first enclosed amusement park on Coney Island which closed down due to competition from near by Steeplechase Park.\n\nIn 1905, Frederick Ingersoll, who was already making a reputation for his pioneering work in roller coaster construction and design (he also designed scenic railroad rides) borrowed the name when he opened Luna Park in Pittsburgh and Luna Park in Cleveland. These first two amusement parks, like their namesake, were covered with electric lighting (the former was adorned with 67,000 light bulbs; the latter, 50,000). Later, in 1907, Charles Looff opened another Luna Park in Seattle, Washington. Ultimately, Ingersoll opened 44 Luna Parks around the world, the first chain of amusement parks. For a short time, Ingersoll renamed his parks Ingersoll's Luna Park to distinguish them from the Luna Parks to which he had no connection. Ingersoll's death in 1927 and the closing of most of his Luna Parks did not stop new parks from taking the name.\n\nToday, the term \"luna park\" or \"lunapark\" means \"amusement park\" in several European languages.\n"}

{"id": "860354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=860354", "title": "Menagerie", "text": "Menagerie\n\nA menagerie is a collection of captive animals, frequently exotic, kept for display; or the place where such a collection is kept, a precursor to the modern zoological garden. The term was first used in 17th-century France in reference to the management of household or domestic stock. Later, it came to be used primarily in reference to aristocratic or royal animal collections. The French-language \"Methodical Encyclopaedia\" of 1782 defines a menagerie as an \"establishment of luxury and curiosity\". Later on, the term referred also to travelling animal collections that exhibited wild animals at fairs across Europe and the Americas.\n\nA menagerie was mostly connected with an aristocratic or royal court and was situated within a garden or park of a palace. The aristocratic menageries are distinguished from the later zoological gardens since they were founded and owned by aristocrats whose intentions were not primarily of scientific and educational interest. These aristocrats wanted to illustrate their power and wealth, because exotic animals, alive and active, were less common, more difficult to acquire, and more expensive to maintain.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, several sovereigns across Europe maintained menageries at their royal courts. An early example is that of the Emperor Charlemagne in the 8th century. His three menageries, at Aachen, Nijmegen and Ingelheim, located in present-day Netherlands and Germany, housed the first elephants seen in Europe since the Roman Empire, along with monkeys, lions, bears, camels, falcons, and many exotic birds. \nCharlemagne received exotic animals for his collection as gifts from rulers of Africa and Asia.\nIn 797, the caliph of Baghdad, Harun al-Rashid, presented Charlemagne with an Asian elephant named Abul-Abbas. The pachyderm arrived on July 1, 802 to the Emperor's residence in Aachen. He died in June 810.\n\nWilliam the Conqueror had a small royal menagerie. At his manor, Woodstock, he began a collection of exotic animals. Around the year 1100 his son, Henry I, enclosed Woodstock and enlarged the collection.\nAt the beginning of the 12th century, Henry I of England is known to have kept a collection of animals at his palace in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, reportedly including lions, leopards, lynxes, camels, owls and a porcupine.\n\nThe most prominent animal collection in medieval England was the Tower Menagerie in London that began as early as 1204.\nIt was established by King John, who reigned in England from 1199 to 1216 and is known to have held lions and bears.\nHenry III received a wedding gift in 1235 of three leopards from Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor.\nThe most spectacular arrivals in the early years were a white bear and an elephant, gifts from the kings of Norway and France in 1251 and in 1254 respectively.\nIn 1264, the animals were moved to the Bulwark, which was renamed the Lion Tower, near the main western entrance of the Tower.\nThis building was constituted by rows of cages with arched entrances, enclosed behind grilles. They were set in two storeys, and it appears that the animals used the upper cages during the day and were moved to the lower storey at night.\nThe menagerie was opened to the public during the reign of Elizabeth I in the 16th century. During the 18th century, the price of admission was three half-pence, or the supply of a cat or dog to be fed to the lions.\nAnimals recorded here at the end of the 18th century included lions, tigers, hyaenas and bears.\nMost of the animals were transferred in 1831 to the newly opened London Zoo at Regent's Park, which did not receive all the animals but rather shared them with Dublin Zoo.\nThe Tower Menagerie was finally closed in 1835, on the orders of the Duke of Wellington. The Tower Menagerie in London can be considered to have been the royal menagerie of England for six centuries.\n\nIn the first half of the thirteenth century, Emperor Frederick II had three permanent menageries in Italy, at Melfi in Basilicata, at Lucera in Apulia and at Palermo in Sicily.\nIn 1235, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II established at his court in southern Italy the \"first great menagerie\" in western Europe. An elephant, a white bear, a giraffe, a leopard, hyenas, lions, cheetahs, camels and monkeys were all exhibited; but the emperor was particularly interested in birds, and studied them sufficiently to write a number of authoritative books on them.\n\nBy the end of the 15th century, the aristocracy of Renaissance Italy began to collect exotic animals at their residences on the outskirts of the cities. The role played by animals within the gardens of Italian villas expanded at the end of the 16th century and the beginning of the seventeenth century, and one prominent example was the Villa Borghese built 1608–1628 in Rome.\n\nDuring the seventeenth century, exotic birds and small animals provided diverting ornaments for the court of France; lions and other large animals were kept primarily to be brought out for staged fight.\nThe collecting grew and attained more permanent lodgings in the 1660s, when Louis XIV constructed two new menageries: one at Vincennes, next to a palace on the eastern edge of Paris, and a more elaborate one, which became a model for menageries throughout Europe, at Versailles, the site of a royal hunting lodge two hours (by carriage) west of Paris.\n\nAround 1661, he had a menagerie of \"ferocious\" beasts built at Vincennes for the organization of fights. Surrounding a rectangular courtyard, a two-storey building with balconies allowed spectators to view the scene. The animals were housed on the ground floor in cells bordering the courtyard, with small yards on the outside where they could take a bit of exercise.\nAt Vincennes, lions, tigers, and leopards were kept in cages around an amphitheater where the king could entertain courtiers and visiting dignitaries with bloody battles.\nIn 1682, for instance, the ambassador of Persia enjoyed the spectacle of a fight to the death between a royal tiger and an elephant.\n\nWhen the palace of Versailles was built, Louis XIV of France also erected a menagerie within the palace’s park.\nThe menagerie at Versailles was to be something very different from the one at Vincennes.\nMost of it was constructed in 1664 when the first animals were introduced, although the interior fittings were not finished until 1668-70. Situated in the south-west of the park, it was Louis XIV’s first major project at Versailles and one of several pleasure houses that were gradually assembled around the palace.\nIt represented the first menagerie according to Baroque style. The prominent feature of Baroque menageries was the circular layout, in the middle of which stood a beautiful pavilion. Around this pavilion was a walking path and outside this path were the enclosures and cages. Each enclosure had a house or stable at the far end for the animals and was bounded on three sides with walls. There were bars only in the direction of the pavilion.\n\nAnimal fights were halted at Vincennes around 1700, the site fell into disuse, and the animals were installed at Versailles with the others.\nAt about this time, the lions, leopards, and tigers from the menagerie at Vincennes were transferred to Versailles, where they were housed in newly built enclosures fronted with irons bars.\n\nThis particular enterprise marked a decisive step in the creation of menageries of curiosities and was imitated to some extent throughout Europe after the late seventeenth century.\nMonarchs, princes and important lords built them in France (Chantilly from 1663), England (Kew, Osterley), the United Provinces (Het Loo from 1748), Portugal (Belém in 1726, Queluz around 1780), Spain (Madrid in 1774) and Austria (Belvedere in 1716, Schönbrunn in 1752) as well in the Germanic lands following the ravages of the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) and the ensuing reconstruction. Frederick William, Elector of Prussia, equipped Potsdam with a menagerie around 1680. The Elector of the Palatinate, the Prince Regent of Westphalia and many others followed suit.\n\nThis design was adopted particularly by the Habsburg monarchy in Austria. In 1752 Francis I erected his famous Baroque menagerie in the park of Schönbrunn Palace near Vienna. \nBeing at first a courtly menagerie with private character it was opened to the general public in 1779. Initially, it was only open for \"respectably dressed persons\".\n\nAnother aristocratic menagerie was founded in 1774 by Charles III of Spain on grounds which were part of the gardens of the Buen Retiro Palace in Madrid.\nDuring two centuries, it was a predecessor institution of the modern facilities of the Madrid Zoo Aquarium, moved in 1972 to the Casa de Campo.\n\nIn the nineteenth century the aristocratic menageries were displaced by the modern zoological gardens with their scientific and educational approach. The last menagerie in Europe was the Tiergarten Schönbrunn in Vienna, which was known officially as a \"menagerie\" until 1924, before evolving into a modern zoological garden with a scientific, educational and conservationist orientation. Due to its local continuity, the former menagerie established in the medieval through baroque tradition of private wild-animal collections of princes and kings, is often seen as the oldest remaining zoo in the world. Although many of the old Baroque enclosures have been changed, one can still obtain a good impression of the symmetrical ensemble of the formerly imperial menagerie.\n\nIn England travelling menageries had first appeared at around 1700. In contrast to the aristocratic menageries, these travelling animal collections were run by showmen who met the craving for sensation of the ordinary population. These animal shows ranged in size but the largest was George Wombwell's. The earliest record of a fatality at one such travelling menagerie was the death of Hannah Twynnoy in 1703 who was killed by a tiger in Malmesbury, Wiltshire.\nAlso in North America travelling menageries became even more popular during that time.\n\nThe first exotic animal known to have been exhibited in America was a lion, in Boston in 1710, followed a year later in the same city by a camel.\nA sailor arrived in Philadelphia in August 1727 with another lion, which he exhibited in the city and surrounding towns for eight years.\nThe first elephant was imported from India to America by a ship’s captain, Jacob Crowninshield, in 1796. It was first displayed in New York City and travelled extensively up and down the East Coast.\nIn 1834 James and William Howes’ New York Menagerie toured New England with an elephant, a rhinoceros, a camel, two tigers, a polar bear, and several parrots and monkeys.\n\nAmerica’s touring menageries slowed to a crawl under the weight of the depression of the 1840s and then to a halt with the outbreak of the Civil War. Only one travelling menagerie of any size existed after the war: The Van Amburgh menagerie travelled the United States for nearly forty years. Unlike their European counterparts, America’s menageries and circuses had combined as single travelling shows, with one ticket to see both. This increased the size and the diversity of their collections. Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus advertised their shows as the “World’s Greatest Menagerie”.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12681405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12681405", "title": "Moscow Orphanage", "text": "Moscow Orphanage\n\nThe Moscow Orphanage or Foundling Home () was an ambitious project conceived by Catherine the Great and Ivan Betskoy, in the early 1760s. This idealistic experiment of the Age of Enlightenment was intended to manufacture \"ideal citizens\" for the Russian state by bringing up thousands of abandoned children to a very high standard of refinement, cultivation, and professional qualifications. Despite more than adequate staffing and financing, the Orphanage was plagued by high infant mortality and ultimately failed as a social institution.\n\nThe main building, one of the earliest and largest Neoclassical structures in the city, occupies a large portion of Moskvoretskaya Embankment between the Kremlin and Yauza River, boasting a 379-metre frontage on Moskva River. The complex was built in three stages over two centuries, from Karl Blank's master plan (1767) to its complete implementation in the 1940s. Today, the ensemble of the Orphanage houses the Academy of Missile Forces and Russian Academy of Medicine.\n\nAn outgrowth of the Russian Enlightenment, the idea of a state-run orphanage in Moscow was proposed by educator Ivan Betskoy and endorsed by Catherine II of Russia on September 1, 1763. Betskoy envisaged a spacious, strictly controlled, state-of-the-art institution that could raise abandoned infants and train them depending on each child's abilities—in craftsmanship, fine arts, or in preparation for university classes. Children born in slavery were automatically emancipated, and upon graduation could join the state service or the merchant estate.\n\nThe institution was set on a large lot of land between Kitai-gorod, Solyanka Street, Moskva and Yauza rivers, site of a former armoury. Construction was financed through a public subscription. The Empress herself pledged 100,000 roubles; the largest private donations, from Prokofy Demidov and Ivan Betskoy, amounted to 200,000 and 162,995 roubles.\n\nAccording to the master plan by Karl Blank (assisted by Yury Felten), the Orphanage was designed as a chain of three square-shaped buildings: the eastern wing for the girls, the western wing for the boys and the central administration block connecting them. The inauguration ceremony, attended by the Empress, was held on April 21, 1764, although the western wing was not completed by Blank until three years later. The central building, constructed between 1771 and 1781, was surmounted by a square dome with a spire. The adjacent Moskva River embankment was paved in 1795–97 and set in granite in 1801–06.\n\nAlthough the eastern wing did not materialize, the Orphanage expanded continuously, under the supervision of senior architects Giovanni Gilardi (1790s-1817) and Domenico Gilardi (1817–34). Domenico and Afanasy Grigoriev designed and built the Board of Trustees building facing Solyanka Street. By the mid-19th century, the Orphanage had evolved into \"a city within a city\" – a largely independent and wealthy institution housing thousands of residents. The bulk of the Orphanage survived the Fire of 1812 and preserved its original aspect until the mid-20th century.\n\nIn the 1940s, the missing eastern wing was finally constructed to a design by Alexander Loveyko, who generally followed Blank's original plans, albeit in a considerably simplified form.\n\nOn the inauguration day, 19 newborn babies were brought to the unfinished Orphanage. Two of them were publicly baptized Catherine and Paul, after the Empress and her heir, but both died soon afterward. This was an early portent of extremely high infant mortality that would be characteristic of the Orphanage in the 18th century.\n\nOf some 40,996 children admitted to the Orphanage during Catherine II's reign, 35,309, or 87%, died during their stay there. As a result, the vast complex housed only a handful of survivors. A 1792 report listed as few as 257 resident orphans who studied a variety of trades ranging from metallurgy to accountancy. Several attempts to decrease mortality by passing infants on to foster families did not improve the survival rate. The aged Betskoy could not be relied on for managing the expanding faculty, and the Orphanage became notorious for fraud and child abuse.\n\nChildren lived at the Orphanage until the age of 11, whereupon they were sent for training to local factories and government offices. Some were assigned to the Michael Maddox theater school; others managed to qualify for free admission to Moscow State University. 180 students furthered their education in the universities of Western Europe. The majority, however, graduated with little more than a rouble in cash and a passport (which served to distinguish free men from serfs).\n\nThe institution was managed by the Board of Trustees and financed by private donations and two special taxes—a tax on public theater shows and a tax on playing cards. For nearly a century, all playing cards sold in Imperial Russia were taxed 5 kopecks per deck on domestic-made cards and 10 kopecks on imports. As a result, every pack of Russian cards displayed the symbol of the Orphanage, the pelican. This tax generated 21,000 roubles in 1796 and 140,000 roubles by 1803.\n\nBeginning in 1772, the Orphanage also managed three banks: Loan Treasury, Savings Treasury, and Widows Treasury. These financial institutions, initially plagued by fraud and poor management, became effective and influential under the guidance of Empress Maria. By 1828, their total assets exceeded 359 million roubles, the largest capital assets in all of Moscow. This stock was the principal source of cash for the Orphanage throughout the 19th century.\n\nIn 1772, plans began to be formed for a \"domestic theatre\" affiliated with the Foundling Home. There were classes on acting, and the first production premiered late in 1773. In the course of 1778 alone, the Orphanage Theatre produced twelve comedies, two operas, and several ballets. By October 1783, the troupe of orphans had become so popular that Baron Vanzura petitioned the Empress to open this \"home theatre\" for the general public. Catherine readily approved the project of a public theatre and presented to the Orphanage a disused wooden building of the Golovin Opera House near the Yauza. The public Orphanage Theatre was inaugurated on 9 February 1764 with the pantomime \"The Marine Brigands\" and the ballet \"Venus and Adonis\".\n\nThe creation of a rival theatre company enraged Michael Maddox, an English entrepreneur who held the monopoly on public entertainment in Moscow. Under his pressure, the Board of Trustees agreed to close the Orphanage Theatre in November 1784, but the orphans were allowed to continue their acting careers on the stage of the Petrovsky Theatre, which was run by Maddox.\n\nIn May 1797 Emperor Paul of Russia asked his wife, Maria Feodorovna, to oversee the national charities. Empress Maria remained in charge of the Orphanage and similar institutions after her husband's assassination in 1801 until her death in 1828.\n\nStep by step, Empress Maria changed the social profile of the Orphanage. She encouraged a thorough inspection of prospective foster parents and limited admissions \"from the street\"; these measures decreased the inflow of new orphans and considerably reduced mortality. By 1826, the mortality rate was reduced to 15% per annum. The figure may appear outrageous by modern standards yet it was a great improvement on the 18th century.\n\nThe institution, headed by retired general Ivan Tutolmin, was not damaged during Napoleon I's occupation of Moscow, despite its proximity to the centre of the Fire of Moscow, which completely destroyed the adjacent districts, including Kitai-gorod and Taganka. While the French held the city, the Orphanage provided shelter for 350 children and an unspecified number of wounded soldiers. After the end of the Napoleonic wars, the Board of Trustees capitalized on the recent disaster by building cheap rental housing on its properties. As a result of this policy, the new facilities housed up to 8,000 residents of all ranks in the 1820s.\n\nEmpress Maria realized the need to downsize the institution, separating children from adult tenants and improving the educational program for the former. She detested the \"dirty\" appearance of trade workshops and transferred them to new, independent orphanages. The Moscow Crafts College, the largest spin-off, was established as an orphanage for teenagers in 1830, and continues today as the Bauman Moscow State Technical University. In the old Orphanage, a premium was placed upon high-level educational programs along the lines of the \"Latin classes\" for boys (established 1807) and the \"midwife classes\" for girls.\n\nBy the 1830s, the Orphanage finally achieved the espoused aim of taking the ablest children from the streets and preparing them for state service and professional careers. Among the teachers and tenants were Gerhardt Friedrich Müller, Alexander Vostokov, Sergey Solovyov, Vasily Klyuchevsky, Nicholas Benois, Isaak Levitan, and Vasily Vereshchagin. Until the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Moscow Orphanage ranked among the most prominent national charities.\n\nThe Bolsheviks disbanded the Orphanage immediately after the Revolution. The main building was conveyed to the Soviet trade unions, followed by Dzerzhinsky Military Academy and a long succession of state institutions. The satirical novel \"The Twelve Chairs\" features a famous episode: an abandoned wife chasing Ostap Bender, her runaway husband, through numerous editorial offices of the former Orphanage.\n\nDuring Joseph Stalin's reconstruction of old Moscow (1937), several Orphanage buildings facing Bolshoy Ustinsky Bridge were torn down to make way for the new bridge. The right wing of the Orphanage was topped out by June 1941, but the project was not completed until after World War II. Viewed from the outside, this later addition is only marginally different from the left wing, to which the top floor was added at about the same time. The main building conforms quite closely to Blank's original designs.\n\nMoscow chief architect A. Kuzminov proposed to house Russian Parliament Center in the premises of the Orphanage. The Russian Parliament Center will be used by both Russian Senate and Russian State Duma as their main residence.\n\n"}

{"id": "36518353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36518353", "title": "Pareh", "text": "Pareh\n\nPareh (Sundanese for \"rice\"), released internationally as Pareh, Song of the Rice, is a 1936 film from the Dutch East Indies (modern day Indonesia). Directed by the Dutchmen Albert Balink and Mannus Franken, it featured an amateur native cast and starred Raden Mochtar and Soekarsih. The story follows the forbidden love between a fisherman and a farmer's daughter.\n\nBalink began work on the film in 1934, working with the Wong brothers, who served as cinematographers. They gathered a budget of 75,000 gulden – several times the budget of other local productions – and brought Franken from the Netherlands to assist in production. The film was edited in the Netherlands after being shot in the Indies. The film was a commercial and critical success with European audiences, but disliked by native ones; despite this success, \"Pareh\" bankrupted its producers.\n\n\"Pareh\" resulted in a change in the cinema of Dutch East Indies, which had been Chinese-oriented for several years; films began to make more effort at targeting local audiences. Balink later found commercial success with \"Terang Boelan\" (1937). The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider considers \"Pareh\" and \"Terang Boelan\" the two most important cinematic works from the Dutch East Indies during the 1930s.\n\nMahmud (Rd. Mochtar), a fisherman, is in love with Wagini (Soekarsih), a farmer's daughter. However, local superstition dictates that their relationship will bring disaster. This seems to prove true after the village leader's keris is stolen, but eventually Mahmud and Wagini are able to unite with the help of his fellow villagers.\n\nDuring 1934 and early 1935, all feature films released in the Dutch East Indies had been produced by The Teng Chun, based on Chinese mythology or martial arts, and targeted at low-class audiences, generally ethnic Chinese. This situation was created by the Great Depression, which had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes, advertisers asking for more money, and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices; this ensured that there was a very low profit margin for local films. During this period cinemas in the country mainly showed Hollywood productions.\nAlbert Balink, a Dutch journalist, began work on what was to become \"Pareh\" in 1934. Unlike The Teng Chun, the inexperienced Balink chose to target his film at Dutch audiences. He brought in two of the Wong brothers, Chinese filmmakers who had been inactive since making \"Zuster Theresia\" (\"Sister Theresa\") in 1932. The Wongs donated their studio – an old tapioca flour factory – as well as filmmaking equipment. Meanwhile, much of the funding came from other backers. According to the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran, the money came from the cinema mogul Buse, while EYE Film Institute records indicate that the film was backed by the Centrale Commissie voor Emigratie en Kolonisatie van Inheemschen and meant to promote migration from Java to Sumatra.\n\nBalink and the Wongs spent most of two years compiling the necessary funds, with Balink in charge of general operations as the head of Java Pacific Film, a joint operation. Balink insisted on perfection and had a clear idea what kind of actor he wanted in the film. Unlike earlier filmmakers in the country, Balink invested time and money in searching for the best locations and actors possible, without considering whether a person was already a celebrity. Ultimately, most of those cast for \"Pareh\" had not acted before, including stars Mochtar and Soekarsih. \n\nThe role of Mahmud was filled when Balink was out with coffee with Joshua and Othniel Wong and saw a young man, tall, strong, and handsome – as he expected for the role – driving by. Balink called the Wongs and they got into their car, then chased and caught the young man. The man, Mochtar, a Javanese of noble descent, was told to use the title \"Raden\" for the film, which he and his family had already abandoned. According to the Indonesian anthropologist Albertus Budi Susanto, the emphasis on Mochtar's title was meant as a way to draw a higher-class audience.\n\nArtistic direction and some of the screenwriting was handled by Mannus Franken, an \"avant-garde\" documentary filmmaker from the Netherlands, whom Balink had brought to the Indies. Franken insisted on including ethnographic shots to better present the local culture to international audiences. Franken took an interest in the documentary and ethnographic aspects of the film, directing the shots for these portions, while the Wongs handled the general shots. According to Biran, this was reflected in the camera angles used. \n\n\"Pareh\", which had been recorded on 35 mm film using single-system devices, was brought to the Netherlands for editing. There the original voices of the cast were dubbed by actors in the Netherlands, resulting in stilted language use and heavy Dutch accents. Though initially the filmmakers had planned on using \"gamelan\" music, the poor quality of the recording equipment in the Indies led to the soundtrack being redone, using European-style music, in the Netherlands. \n\nFrom start to finish the production of \"Pareh\" cost 75,000 gulden (approximately US$ 51,000), 20 times as much as a regular local production. After editing there were 2,061 metres of film, equivalent to 92 minutes of runtime.\n\n\"Pareh\" was screened in the Netherlands as \"Pareh, een Rijstlied van Java\" (also noted as \"Het Lied van de Rijst\") beginning on 20 November 1936. The film was also shown in the Indies. It was unable to recoup its costs and bankrupted the producers. The film was critically acclaimed in the Netherlands, partially owing to the emphasis of Franken's involvement. Although it was a commercial success amongst the intelligentsia in the Indies, \"Pareh\" was a failure with lower-class native audiences. Mochtar never viewed the film in full. \n\nHistorical reception of \"Pareh\" has generally been positive. Writing in 1955, the Indonesian author and cultural critic Armijn Pane opined that \"Pareh\" was technically unparalleled in contemporary Indies cinema, with careful continuity and dynamic cuts. He was critical, however, of the film's tendency to see the Indies' native population through European eyes and depict them as \"primitive\". The American film historian John Lent, writing in 1990, described \"Pareh\" as a \"meticulously detailed and costly\" film which attempted to not only earn money, but show the local culture. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider considers \"Pareh\" one of the two most important cinematic works from the Dutch East Indies during the 1930s; Balink's later work \"Terang Boelan\" (\"Full Moon\"; 1937) was the other. Heider, John H. McGlynn, and Salim Said note that the film was of acceptable technical quality but is best remembered for changing the path of cinematic developments in the country.\n\nThe release of \"Pareh\" was followed by a shift in genres popularised by the local cinema. The Teng Chun, who – together with Balink – continued to be the only active filmmaker in the country until 1937, began focusing on more modern stories and those which would be popular with native audiences. Biran suggests that this was influenced by \"Pareh\". Other filmmakers in the late 1930s, partially inspired by \"Pareh\", began to improve the quality of the audio in their films. Pane notes that, following \"Pareh\", films produced domestically no longer centred around ethnic European casts.\n\nMochtar and Soekarsih, who first met on the set of \"Pareh\", married after appearing together in \"Terang Boelan\". This later production included much of the same cast and was highly successful, leading to a renewed interest in filmmaking in the Indies. \"Terang Boelan\" proved to be the most successful local production until 1953's \"Krisis\" (\"Crisis\"), released after Indonesia had become independent.\n\n\nFootnotes\nBibliography\n"}

{"id": "60130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60130", "title": "Prelude to Foundation", "text": "Prelude to Foundation\n\nPrelude to Foundation is a novel by American writer Isaac Asimov, published in 1988. It is one of two prequels to the \"Foundation\" series. For the first time, Asimov chronicles the fictional life of Hari Seldon, the man who invented psychohistory and the intellectual hero of the series. The novel was nominated for the Locus Award.\n\nPrelude to Foundation is set in the year 12,020 G.E. (Galactic era), during the rocky reign of the Emperor Cleon I. It starts with Seldon's presentation of a paper at a mathematics convention detailing how practical use of psychohistory might theoretically make it possible to predict the future. The Emperor of the Galactic Empire learns of this and wants to use Seldon for political gain. In a face-to-face interview, Seldon emphasizes that psychohistory is something that he has not even begun developing or even has a clear idea how to do so, but Cleon is not wholly convinced that Hari is of no use to the Empire.\n\nSeldon then meets reporter Chetter Hummin, who convinces him that Cleon's first minister, Eto Demerzel, is attempting to capture him, and that it is therefore imperative for Seldon to escape and try to make psychohistory practical. He is taken by Hummin to Streeling University, one of the top ranked of the Empire and introduced to Dors Venabili by Hummin. Seldon theorizes that the first development of psychohistory requires a smaller, yet still significant sample than the entire Empire, possibly just the original world where humans originated...which is now lost, along with much of the older historical records.\n\nHari and Dors narrowly evade capture at Streeling University, and Hummin arranges for them to be sheltered in the reclusive Mycogen sector, which supposedly values its ancient history. Seldon and Venabili are welcomed by Sunmaster Fourteen, the leader of Mycogen. Seldon obtains the Mycogenians' treasured religious/historical book, but finds it disappointing except for the revelation of what the Mycogenians call their home planet, Aurora, and references to \"robots\" (which do not exist in the Empire). Seldon and Venabili face execution when Seldon insists on entering the Mycogenian \"temple\", the Sacratorium, in disguise in hopes of interviewing a robot supposedly housed there. They are easily detected, but Hummin arrives in the nick of time to save them. \n\nThe action then shifts to the Dahl sector, where Seldon and Venabili rent rooms from a middle-class family. While in Dahl, they meet a guttersnipe named Raych, whom Seldon later adopts. Also in Dahl, they are told by an old wise woman that the Aurora of the Mycogenians is not the original world, but actually the \"enemy\" of the original human planet, called Earth. (This links with the Robot series.)\n\nTowards the end of the novel, Seldon, Venabili, and Raych are kidnapped and taken to Rashelle, the Mayor of Wye, a powerful and vital sector situated at Trantor's south pole. Rashelle and her father have long been plotting to overthrow the Emperor and take his place. Seldon has the revelation that he could try to develop psychohistory using Trantor itself as a test case because of the great cultural diversity of its sectors. Rashelle launches her coup attempt, but it quickly collapses due to Demerzel's skillful subversion of Wye's forces. The finale reveals that \"Hummin\" is actually Eto Demerzel. Seldon then gets Demerzel to admit he is a robot; Demerzel is in fact R. Daneel Olivaw, who can influence humans mentally. He wants the development of psychohistory to help him better protect humanity, as per \"The Zeroth Law Of Robotics.\" Seldon also suspects that Venabili is a robot, too. This theme would later be picked up in \"Forward the Foundation\".\n\nBelow is a list of all the major and minor characters in the book, in order of appearance, with brief descriptions.\n\n\nThe novel is one of French politician Jean-Luc Mélenchon's main metapolitical sources of inspirations.\n\n"}

Since Nash equilibria do not normally exist when the policy space is multidimensional, John Roemer introduced the concept of party-unanimity Nash equilibrium (PUNE), which can be considered a generalization of the concept of Nash equilibrium in models of political competition. It is also a generalization of the Wittman model of political competition.\n\nIn Roemer's model, all political parties are assumed to consist of three types of factions—opportunists, militants, and reformers. Opportunists seek solely to maximize the party's vote share in an election; militants seek to announce (and implement) the preferred policy of the average party member; and reformers have an objective function that is a convex combination of the objective functions of the opportunists and militants. It has been shown that the existence of reformers has no effect on what policies the party announces.\n\nWith two parties, a pair of policy announcements constitute a PUNE if and only if the reformers and militants of any given party do not unanimously agree to deviate from their announced policy, given the policy put forth by the other party. In other words, if a pair of policies constitute a PUNE, then it should not be the case that \"both\" factions of a party can be made weakly better off (and one faction strictly better off) by deviating from the policy that they put forward. Such unanimity to deviate can be rare, and thus PUNEs are more likely to exist than regular Nash equilibria.\n\nAlthough there are no known cases where PUNEs do not exist, no simple necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of non-trivial PUNEs have yet been offered. (A nontrivial PUNE is one in which no party offers the ideal policy of either its militants or opportunists.) The question of the existence of non-trivial PUNEs remains an important open question in the theory of political competition.\n\n"}
{"id": "542704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=542704", "title": "Spoiler (media)", "text": "Spoiler (media)\n\nA spoiler is an element of a disseminated summary or description of any piece of fiction that reveals any plot elements which threaten to give away important details. Typically, the details of the conclusion of the plot, including the climax and ending, are especially regarded as spoiler material. It can also be used to refer to any piece of information regarding any part of a given media that a potential consumer would not want to know beforehand. Because enjoyment of fiction depends a great deal upon the suspense of revealing plot details through standard narrative progression, the prior revelation of how things will turn out can \"spoil\" the enjoyment that some consumers of the narrative would otherwise have experienced. Spoilers can be found in message boards, articles, reviews, commercials, and movie trailers.\n\nThe term spoiler was introduced in the early days of the Internet, and came to prominence in newsgroup conversations. It is still common in internet articles and social media discussions. Early rules of netiquette insisted that spoilers could and should be normally avoided, but if the posting of \"spoiling\" information was unavoidable, it be preceded by a warning such as \"SPOILER ALERT\", or the spoiler itself has to be masked so that it can not be visible to any but those keen for details and not fazed at the thought of such potentially plot-revealing information.\n\nSometimes, these warnings are omitted, accidentally or deliberately (see below), and some unwitting readers have had literature, films, television programmes and other works that they were looking forward to experiencing \"spoiled\".\n\nThere is a common demand, especially among internet users, to have protection against accidentally seeing material considered to include \"spoiler\" information, even in the internet version of settings where such material has conventionally and historically appeared, such as discussion groups or literary reviews. As a result of this level of objection to spoilers, trolls may post them purely for their own pleasure, finding amusement in believing they are completely ruining a narrative experience for others. On reputable websites, these can be reported to moderators and such posts taken down, the posters blacklisted, but only after the fact. Most such websites provide a means of tagging certain threads as containing spoilers for those who wish to discuss a fictional work in depth, including the outcomes of events and the handling of the narrative resolution. Some have felt compelled to avoid participating on public websites altogether, set up \"closed\" websites to exclude those who are sensitive about spoilers, or decided they had to unilaterally blog at the expense of public exchange.\n\nOn Usenet, the common method for obscuring spoiler information is to precede it with many blank lines known as 'spoiler space' – traditionally enough to push the information in question on to the next screen of a 25-line terminal. A simple cipher called ROT13 is also used in newsgroups to obscure spoilers, but is rarely used for this purpose elsewhere.\n\nSome producers actively seed bogus information in order to misdirect fans. The director of the film \"Terminator Salvation\" orchestrated a \"disinformation campaign\" where false spoilers were distributed about the film, to mask any true rumors about its plot.\n\nWikipedia discloses spoilers in its articles without giving advance warning, although it previously did prior to 2006. Matthew Prichard, the grandson of Agatha Christie, criticized Wikipedia for giving away spoilers in the play \"The Mousetrap\". Andrew Jarecki, the producer of \"Catfish\", a documentary, argued that Wikipedia should have spoiler alerts. The plot of \"Catfish\" had been posted on Wikipedia before its theatrical release because the film had been shown at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. Jay Walsh, a Wikimedia Foundation spokesperson, said that Wikipedia is intended to be an exhaustive knowledge source, so it would have spoilers.\n\nSome internet forums and reference sites, such as TV Tropes and the IMDb FAQ section, have optional spoiler tags covering major plot details. The information underneath may be revealed by highlighting the text or, in the case of IMDb, rolling over the spoiler tag.\n\nIn 2011, Nicholas Christenfeld and Jonathan Leavitt of UC San Diego did a psychological experiment testing whether spoilers diminish enjoyment of fiction. They gave subjects short stories with twist endings to read, giving some of the subjects information about the twist in advance. For nearly every story, subjects who had the story \"spoiled\" enjoyed the story more than the subjects who didn't know the ending in advance.\n\nThere are some applications that prevent users from reading spoilers, such as TVShow Time's Google Chrome extension, which, once set up, blocks posts on social media about episodes that the user has not seen.\n\nOne of the first print uses of the terms was in the April 1971 issue of \"National Lampoon\". An article entitled \"Spoilers,\" by Doug Kenney, lists spoilers for famous films and movies.\nIn 2005, the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" film critic Roger Ebert wrote an article entitled \"Critics have no right to play spoiler\" which contained spoilers and spoilers warnings. Ebert wrote:\n\nEbert used two spoiler warnings in the article, saying \"If you have not yet seen \"Million Dollar Baby\" and know nothing about the plot, read no further\" and later said, \"Now yet another spoiler warning, because I am going to become more explicit.\" Ebert discussed six films in the article and mentioned how many critics handled \"The Crying Game\" and also noted a detail about the film \"The Year of Living Dangerously\". Ebert also mentioned two films alongside \"Million Dollar Baby\".\n\nEbert additionally criticized two commentators, Rush Limbaugh and Michael Medved (the latter of whom had \"for a long time been a political commentator, not a movie critic\"), for deliberately revealing the ending of the movie due to a moral disagreement with the lead character's life decision. \"[S]hould no movie be allowed to consider [the moral issue]?\" Ebert asked. \"The separation of church and state in America was wisely designed to prevent religions from dictating the personal choices of those who do not share the same beliefs.\"\n\nIn an interview about his \"Dark Tower\" series (appearing in issue #4 of the 2007 Marvel Comic adaptation \"The Gunslinger Born\"), Stephen King was asked if there are spoilers in the first few novels that would ruin someone's experience of the comic. \"There are no spoilers!\", King replied, \"You might as well say 'I'm never gonna watch \"Wizard of Oz\" again because I know how it comes out'\".\n\nThe executive producer of \"Doctor Who\", Steven Moffat, expressed disappointment with fans who revealed spoilers after a leaked copy of \"The Impossible Astronaut\" was made available online before the episode's first television broadcast.\n\nIn April 2015, the Under the Gun Theater created \"Swarm of Spoilers\", a parody show based on George R.R. Martin's \"Game of Thrones\" series. The comedic play recapped the previous four seasons of the HBO television show. Kevin Mullaney, who directed \"Swarm of Spoilers\", stated: \"I'm somebody who's very sensitive about spoilers, so I wanted to make sure it was very clear from the title,\" though he went on to say, \"There's actually this theory about spoilers that we think that they hurt the enjoyment of shows, and I definitely feel that way sometimes, but I think there's been studies that show the other side: that when we know the ending of a story that we haven't read before, it actually enhances the story, so I don't know if it would actually hurt anyone to come see it [\"Swarm of Spoilers\"].\" The final production included 45 of the series' characters, and was played by an 18-person ensemble.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16969624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16969624", "title": "Spotting (dance technique)", "text": "Spotting (dance technique)\n\nSpotting is a technique used by dancers during the execution of various dance turns. The goal of spotting is to attain a constant orientation of the dancer's head and eyes, to the extent possible, in order to enhance the dancer's control and prevent dizziness.\n\nAs a dancer turns, spotting is performed by rotating the body and head at different rates. While the body rotates smoothly at a relatively constant speed, the head periodically rotates much faster and then stops, so as to fix the dancer's gaze on a single location (the \"spotting point\", or simply the \"spot\"). Dancers will sometimes focus on an actual visual spot if one is available (e.g., a light or other object), but if no suitable object is available they will attempt to end each head rotation in a consistent orientation. The spotting point may be another dancer, in which case the spot may move.\n\nSpotting is advantageous for dancers in several ways:\n\nSpotting technique is employed for many types of turns, including pirouettes and chaînés. It is deliberately avoided in some types of turns, however. For example, adagio turns — in which the aesthetics are intended to convey serenity and calm — would be disturbed by the abrupt head movements of spotting. Turns in adagio style include turns in arabesque or attitude positions.\n\nIn some cases multiple spots may be used during a turn. For example, during a Salsa \"cross-body lead with inside turn\", the lady spots away from her partner to control travel and then spots on her partner to control the stop of rotation.\n\nAn adaptation of spotting is used in first person video games to avoid simulation sickness caused by scenery changes that are uncorrelated with body movement. For example, a visible crosshair or targeting reticle is provided in Mirror's Edge as a spotting reference point.\n\nIn Labanotation, spotting is recorded as a face sign followed by the \"spot hold\" sign, which is a diamond shape (◊) with a dot in the center.\n"}
{"id": "58570005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58570005", "title": "The Gardens Between", "text": "The Gardens Between\n\nThe Gardens Between is a puzzle video game developed by Australian studio The Voxel Agents, released in September 2018 for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4.\n\nThe game centers around teenagers Arina and Frendt, a girl and boy that live next door to each other that have become close friends since Arina's family moved into the area. One rainy night, the two sneak out and hide out in their treehouse, built on a small garden square next to both houses. In the midst of a rainstorm, they see a light sphere form in front of them, which suddenly causes the treehouse to fall into a vast dream ocean with small islands made up of their shared experiences. They sail between the islands in the treehouse to light each portal at the top, and finally to a central island and a large portal, together; as they progress, the weather of this dreamspace becomes overcast and then rainy. Once lit, the islands all collapse into the ocean, leaving them in their treehouse. When the next morning comes Arina and Frendt are hugging each other, as Frendt's family is now moving out. The two say their final goodbyes as Frendt's family drives off.\n\nThe game consists of about twenty abstract levels, grouped into sets of two or three levels each, each influenced by memories of Arina and Frendt's friendship. Arina gains control of a magic lantern that is able to carry a sphere of light, which is needed to activate a portal to the next level, while Frendt has the ability to sound wind chimes that open or close flowers that provide the light for the lantern, as well as interfacing with a device that manipulates the flow of time for some objects. Obstacles in the environment include small cubes that jump about the level, but which can also carry Arina's lantern past obstacles, flowers that emit a black light that steals spheres of light that come close, and purple fog that is solid when the light is not present but becomes intangible when the light is close.\n\nWhile the path to the portal at the top of each level is straight forward, the game is about manipulating the flow of time. The player does not directly move the characters but instead has their process move forward or backward in time, which will have the pair move forward or backward along the path. However, Arina and Frendt's interactions with the environment remain mutable with time. For example, the player may need to have Arina work forward in time to grab a sphere of light for the lantern, move time backward for her to place it on a jumping cube, and then continue to move forward pass a fog bridge to recollect the cube later. The player cannot move time forward or past a point where either Arina or Frendt cannot progress. Separately, Frendt's ability to interact with devices that control the flow of time for objects in the level may be needed to create paths previously blocked, bring falling light flowers into close proximity to Arina's paths, or similar motions. Other solutions may require lateral thinking that recognizing how the various time stream manipulations can work.\n\nOnce the player has completed a set of levels, they are presented with a short scene of Arina and Frendt involved in these activities, where a hidden jumping cube can be found using similar time manipulation controls. This completes a constellation, which once the final level is completed, merge into a final memory.\n\n\"The Gardens Between\" was developed by the Australia studio The Voxel Agents. Lead designer and animator Josh Alan Bradbury stated that the game was meant to be an allegory for how one looks back at childhood friends when they become older. Bradbury descirbed that Arina and Frendt are not necessary the most compatible friends - Arina is shown more adventurous and outgoing, while Frendt is shy and seeks intellectual pursuits - and as an adult may make little sense how they developed a friendship, but through the lens of their shared childhood memories, one is able to see how their friendship developed. The time manipulation mechanics was representative of trying to relive these childhood memories, running through them back and forth in order to recall them correctly. \n\nThe game's soundtrack is composed by Tim Shiel.\n\nThe game was released on Microsoft Windows, MacOS, Linux, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4 consoles on 20 September 2018.\n\n\"The Gardens Between\" received \"mixed or average\" reviews for PS4, and \"generally favorable\" reviews for PC and Switch, according to the review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nThe Verge's Michael Moore considered how \"The Gardens Between\" presented a type of theoretical physics related to different points-of-view when discussing the potential of time travel, as what Arina and Frendt would witness would be drastically different from what the player witnesses or other potential perspectives in the game.\n\n\"The Gardens Between\" won the Game of the Year award at the 2018 Australian Game Development Awards.\n"}

{"id": "1773505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1773505", "title": "Truco", "text": "Truco\n\nTruco is a variant of Truc and a popular trick-taking card game originally from Valencia and Balearic Islands (Spain) and played specially in the Southern Cone in Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Italy (in Piemonte, in Lomellina, and a particular variant in the towns Porto San Giorgio, Sirolo, Numana, Porto Recanati, Potenza Picena (Marche) and Paulilatino (Sardegna) ), Paraguay, southern Chile and Venezuela. It is played using a Spanish deck, by two, four or six players, divided into two teams.\n\nExcept for the variant played in the Brazilian states of Minas Gerais, São Paulo and some others, Truco is played with a 40-card Spanish deck - \"See below\".\n\nEach player is dealt three cards from a subset of the deck consisting of the numbers 1 to 7 and figures \"sota\" in Spanish or \"valete\" in Portuguese (jack, worth 10), \"caballo\" in Spanish or \"dama\" in Portuguese (equivalent to a queen, worth 11) and \"rey\" in Spanish or \"rei\" in Portuguese (king, worth 12).\n\nThe most common form of the game is the four-player version, in which there are two teams of two players, who sit opposite each other. For six players, there are two teams of three players, with every second player on the same team.\n\nThe game is played until a team finishes a game with 30 points or more. The 30 points are commonly split into two halves, the lower half called \"malas\" in Spanish or \"ruins\" in Portuguese (bad) and the higher half called \"buenas\" in Spanish or \"boas\" in Portuguese (good). Therefore, a team with 8 points would be \"ocho malas\" or \"oito ruins\" (8 bad ones), and a team with 21 points would be \"seis buenas\" or \"seis boas\" (6 good ones). However, because both teams can score points in one round, it is possible (but very rare) for both teams to go over 30 points in one round. Usually as soon as one team goes over 30 points, the game is ended, to stop there being a tie situation. However, sometimes the winner is the one with more points, otherwise another hand is played, until the tie is broken.\n\nThe popular appeal of the game comes from the exciting bidding process. Each type of scoring can be bid on to score your team more points. Bids can be accepted, rejected or upped. Bluffing and deception are also fundamental to the game.\n\n\nIn addition, the Uruguayan version of the game uses a \"Muestra\" each hand. The following cards of the same suit as the \"Muestra\" are ranked higher than the Ace of swords and are called \"Piezas\": 2, 4, 5, Knight, which in some regions is called \"Perico,\" worth 30 points, and the Jack, which in some regions is called \"Perica,\" worth 29 points. Finally, if any player has the King of the same suit as the \"Muestra\" and the \"Muestra\" is a \"Pieza\", the King becomes that card.\n\nThe Venezuelan version is quite similar to Uruguayan version with the exception that the \"Piezas\" 2, 4, and 5 are not used. The \"Muestra\" or as it is known in Venezuela, \"La Vira\" (or trump suit) is designated by turning over the top card of the deck after shuffle or optionally, the top card following the deal. \"La Vira\" is then placed beneath the deck offset 90 degrees so that it is visible during the play of the hand. The suit of \"La Vira\" designates the suit of \"El Perico\" (the Knight) and \"La Perica\" (the Jack) which become the highest two cards in the game respectively. The remaining three Knights and Jacks are ranked as initially specified.\n\nIn Truco, there are two concepts concerning which player begins the round and who is the last. The \"mano\" in Spanish or \"mão\" in Portuguese (\"hand\") is the one that plays first and the \"pie\" in Spanish or \"pé\" in Portuguese (\"foot\"), the dealer, is the last to play. The hand is always the player on the right of the foot. The turn to deal is then passed counterclockwise, so the hand of the first round is the foot of the second and so on. If playing in teams, partners sit opposite each other.\n\nThey can also refer, when playing in teams of two, which player of the partnership plays before and which after. This has no significance in the game, as the playing is always done counterclockwise. But it has strategic significance since the foot of a team is traditionally considered the \"captain\" of the partnership during that round.\n\nIf the game is tied (for example, if two opponents have the same points for envido), the hand wins. That advantage is offset by the fact that, being the last one to play, the foot plays with all their opponent's cards in sight. Also, the foot and the one sitting to his left are the ones who call envido in a game of four or more. Then, the hand is the first one to call his points for envido.\n\nPlayers can earn points in three different ways. These will be further developed below in special sections for each one.\n\nThe score won by a player is added to his team's score (when playing in teams). Any bet, win, loss, or surrender by a player also affects his partner/s. For this reason, partnerships are usually formed by mutual arrangement between two players who know each other very well. As in bridge, it is not rare for partners to share information using preestablished signs and gestures. Communication is usually performed by a standard set of gestures (see señas). Arranging a secret set of gestures is thus frowned upon.\n\nThe playing of the cards is done thus: the \"mano\" leads to the first trick (each round has three tricks) by playing one card. Then, counterclockwise, each other player plays one card. The player with the highest card (according to the ranking shown above) wins the trick. The cards remain face-up on the table until the round is finished.\n\nSometimes it happens that there is no single highest card, but a tie between two or more cards. If these tied cards were played by the same team, that team wins the trick. If that is not the case, the trick is called a draw, \"parda\". The same \"mano\" then leads the next trick.\n\nBy winning two of three tricks, one wins a round, equivalent to one point. If a team wins the first two tricks, the third is not played. But if one of the games ended in a \"parda\", the team that won the \"earlier\" of the other two tricks wins (e.g. If trick 1 was won by A, trick 2 was won by B, and trick 3 was a draw, A wins the round for having won the earlier trick. That concept is often referred to as \"primera vale doble\" (first is worth double) If trick 1 is drawn and trick 2 is won by B, the winner of the round is B and a third trick is not played). In the case of two \"pardas\", the winner of the remaining trick wins the round. In case of three \"pardas\", the \"mano\" wins the round. The winner of each round is the first one to play the next card. If a round is tied, or \"parda\", the hand plays first.\n\nDuring play, there are multiple opportunities to raise the stakes of the round. \n\n\"Truco\" must be accepted explicitly: if \"truco\" is said, the only way to accept it is by saying \"quiero\", but in a less competitive fashion it could be accepted to close the challenge saying \"veo, dale\" or any way of saying yes . To call \"retruco\" immediately, it is necessary first to say \"quiero\" (and the same is true when calling \"vale Cuatro\"). Instead of saying explicitly \"quiero\", a player can play a card and it is implied that he accepted.\n\nA player can play his card face up or face down, in which case it does not count towards the score. A card can be played face down in order to prevent opponents from deducing the value of a remaining card. In some cases (for example, when envido has been played), other players can deduce the value of some cards the remaining ones. If a player does not want his opponents to know his cards, which can be done in order to trick them into raising their bets, he can play his card face down. This should not be confused with \"irse al mazo\" (going to the deck), which means a whole team admits defeat without finishing the hand.\n\nIn games of two people, \"envido\" must be said before the player plays a card. In games of four or six, the foot and the player to the left of the foot are the ones who say \"envido\" (when they do, there are already cards played).\n\nIt is important to know that \"Envido\" bets have precedence before \"Truco\" bets. If one team calls \"Truco\", and then the other calls \"Envido\", the last must be completed (accepting, increasing or declining it) before the \"Truco\".\n\nWhen \"Envido\" is said, the challenged team/player can answer in any of these ways:\n\nFor \"Real Envido\", the answers are the same, excepting \"Envido\" (because it would \"lower\" the bet). For \"Falta Envido\", the answers are also the same as in \"Envido\", excepting \"Envido\" and \"Real Envido\" (that leaves only \"Quiero\" and \"No quiero\").\n\n\"Quiero\" and \"No quiero\" close the bet and after one of that, no other \"Envido\" bet can be opened. In the cases where the bet is ended with \"Quiero\", a comparison of the pairs (\"puntos de envido\" = \"score of envido\") is performed to see which team/player has the highest and wins the bet. The \"puntos de envido\" are calculated according to these rules: \n\nThe \"puntos de envido\" are told from the \"mano\" to the dealer player anticlockwise. In case of a tie between two or more players, the earliest (i.e. the one most on the left among the tied players) has preference. Any player, in case of having a bad \"envido\" can surrender without revealing information of his cards to the other team/player by saying \"Son buenas\" (\"They're good\"). To say this when playing in teams, is to surrender on behalf of the team. It is usual that when playing in teams, while telling the \"puntos de envido\", the partner of the player that had said the highest \"envido\" can remain silent unless someone of the other team says a higher \"envido\". Then, that player that remained silent will have to say either his score for the \"envidos\" (if his/her is higher) or \"Son buenas\" to recognize the defeat.\n\nAfter finishing the truco, the winner of envido has to show his cards to the rest of the players by placing them on the table and announcing \"[the amount of the envido] en mesa\", or, more commonly in Argentina \"las [the amount of the envido] jugadas\" meaning that the announced cards have been played. Failure to do so may be noted by the opponents and causes the points to be given to them.\n\nThe envido is also referred to as \"tanto\", in order to talk about it without actually proposing it.\n\nIn Argentina, Truco is usually played without \"Flor\" (flower). The variant is called \"Sin Flor\", or \"Sin Jardinera\" (without the gardenmaid).\n\nTo have a \"Flor\" is to have three cards of the same suit in the hand. When playing with \"flor\", any player having one must announce it or a penalty (see below) is risked. The player having the best \"Flor\" wins 3 points for each \"Flor\" announced. On the other hand, if a player has no \"Flor\", that player cannot announce a \"Flor\" (on the contrary to \"Envido\", where any player having or not the pair of the same suit can announce it).\n\nThe call for \"Flor\" can only be made before playing the first card, by simply saying \"Flor\". Then, any other player having \"flor\" must announce his own (the playing of cards is suspended, so players without \"flores\" should wait until the bet is over), going anticlockwise and by saying any of this possible answers:\n\n\nAfter calling \"Contraflor\", the challenged team must answer by one of these:\n\nAfter Contraflor al resto, the answers are:\n\nAfter the bet has been closed by saying \"con flor quiero\" or \"con flor me achico\", players announce the \"flores\". The comparison between \"Flores\" is done similarly as in \"Envido\": the values of the three cards are added up plus 20 (Aces to 7 are worth the face value and \"Sotas\", Knights and Kings, 0). When two \"flores\" have the same suit, the one of that player playing earlier (counting anticlockwise, as usual in \"Truco\") has precedence. If an earlier player announces a better \"flor\" than the one you have, it is usual to say \"Son buenas\", admitting defeat but without unnecessarily revealing information about your cards. At the end of the hand, the \"flores\" must be shown.\n\nAs with all bets in Truco, each \"Flor\" (or surrender) is made on behalf of the team.\n\nThis is a penalty for those players that, having a \"Flor\", didn't announce it. If a player suspects that another one is hiding a \"Flor\", he/she can challenge this player by saying \"Pido flor\". In the case that the player had actually a \"Flor\", the challenger team earns three points. But, if the challenged player shows at least two different cards, his/her team earns one point.\n\nIn contrast to Poker, where things are kept at a low level and quiet, the game of Truco is actually played by tricking your opponent by playing fast and distracting them through conversation. Truco is generally played with friends, and players are often loud, telling jokes, and talking amongst each other. When playing fast and laughing, it sometimes becomes hard to concentrate on the game, which is what many experienced players take advantage of. This is done in many ways:\n\nHowever, as tricky as it might be, in truco it is of very bad taste to cheat. Whether when writing down the score, hiding cards or cheat shuffling (\"cartearse\", to card yourself).\n\nIn a game of 6, sometimes \"Pica Pica\" is also played. When players get their cards, instead of playing the 2 teams of 3, each confronted pair of players of different teams play a game, adding the resulting points to their teams. Usually \"Pica Pica\" played is every other game, but only if a team has 5 or more points, and no team has more than 20 (or 25). \"Pica Pica\" is also known as \"Punta y Hacha\".\n\nThis is a way of finishing the game more quickly, because each pair in a pica pica plays a complete hand, with corresponding scores. Therefore, it is possible to have, for example, three \"vale cuatro\" in the same hand, which raises scores very quickly. However, envidos and its raises are usually capped (the most usual cap being 6 points).\n\nTruco is also a popular game in Brazil, with many regional variations, some similar to the Spanish counterparts, although the most known versions (\"Truco Paulista\" and \"Truco Mineiro\") use a French deck and different rules. \"Truco Paulista\" can be known as \"Ponta Acima\" in some regions.\n\nTruco in Brazil is mostly associated to college culture and lifestyle. The custom of students sitting on a table to play the game while drinking alcoholic beverages has become a stereotype itself, in such a way that it has even been featured prominently in advertising campaigns and it has been included in the program of every University \"Olympic\" Games around the country, known as \"Jogos Universitários\". \"Truco\" can be played by two, three and even four people in each team, which makes it more way exciting and intriguing.\n\nBrazilian \"Truco\" differs from the game played in other countries in various ways, including a maximum score of 12 points, the value of each hand and the card ranking (which itself can be different depending on where the game is played. It is also common to use a best-of-three games system when playing truco.\n\n\"Truco Paulista\" is played mostly (but not limited to) the state of São Paulo and most usually played between two teams of two players each. The game is won by the first team to reach 12 points, with each regular round being worth 1 point.\n\nOne of the players is chosen to be the first to shuffle and deal. The dealer is allowed to look at the faces of the cards while shuffling so as to be able to place certain cards at certain spots within the deck (e.g. placing the highest-ranking cards together). They are not allowed, however, to browse freely through the deck. After shuffling, the deck must be handed to the player to the left (the \"cortador\"), who can either reshuffle the deck (without looking at the faces of the cards), separate it into two or more parts or simply do nothing. The deck (or the part of it chosen by the \"cortador\", provided it contains at least than 12 cards) is then returned to the dealer who will deal the cards from the top or bottom of the deck (this is chosen by the \"cortador\"). The cards must be dealt counter-clockwise, starting with the player to the dealer's right. They can be dealt one at a time or, most commonly, three at a time. If the \"cortador\" chooses not to reshuffle, they can deal their and their partner's cards in advance.\n\nThe players each play one card, starting with the player to the right of the dealer, the \"mão\" (hand) and ending with the dealer, called the \"pé\" (foot). The player who played the highest-ranked card wins the trick for the team and begins the following trick.\n\nThe rounds consist of a best-of-three tricks. The team that wins two tricks wins the round and gets the point. If the first trick (or first and second tricks) ends in a tie, the winner of the next trick wins the round. If the second or third tricks end in a tie, the winner of the first trick wins the hand. In the rare occasion that all three tricks end in ties, nobody is awarded the point. In the case of a tie, the following trick is started by the player who tied the last trick.\n\nAt any point during the game any of the players can raise the stakes by saying \"truco\". When a player \"asks for truco\", the opposing team has three options:\nIf the team chooses to \"ask for 6\" they are automatically accepting that the round is now worth three points while trying to raise the stakes even further. The opposing team (the one who asked for \"truco\" in the first place) has the same three options:\nThis system goes on in this same pattern, with the players being able to raise the stakes further to \"game\" and finally \"match.\"\n\nWhen one of the teams reaches 11 points, they play the \"mão-de-onze\" (round of eleven). In this round, the members of each team can see their partner's cards before the round begins and the team with eleven points may choose to play the round of run away. If they choose to play, the round is worth three points. If they choose to run away, the opposing team is awarded one point. If any of the players ask for truco during the round of eleven, the team loses the round. For this reason, if one of the players is dealt an unbeatable hand (having the two best cards at the same time) they may simply show the cards to the rest of the table and win the round without having to play. If both teams reach eleven points, the round must be played.\n\nIf one of the players receives fewer or more than three cards dealt by a member of the opposing team, they can point out this error after the round has begun and win the round. If the error is pointed out before the hand begins the deck must be shuffled and the cards dealt again.\n\nIn \"truco paulista\" the cards are ranked in the following order, from strongest to weakest:\n8s, 9s and 10s are never included. Upon agreement, the 7s, 6s, 5s, and 4s can be removed from the deck, this is called playing with a clean deck (\"jogar com baralho limpo\").\n\nAfter the cards are dealt, one card from the remainder of the deck is turned over to determine the \"trump cards\" (\"manilhas\"), which rank above all others. The trump cards are the cards directly above the one which was turned over (e.g. if the card revealed is a 7, the trump cards are the queens). The strength of a trump card when compared to the others is determined by its suit, with diamonds being the weakest, followed by spades, hearts and clubs being the strongest.\n\n\"Truco mineiro\" is a variety of truco played mostly in the state of Minas Gerais, but also not limited to it. The rules are mostly the same as in \"truco paulista\", with only a few differences:\nIn \"truco mineiro\", the round of eleven is replaced by the roughly similar \"round of ten\", the only differences (aside from the number of points required) being that only the team with ten points is allowed to see each other's cards and that the round is worth four points instead of three. If both teams reach ten points the round must be played and they are not allowed to see each other's cards.\n\n\"Truco mineiro\" uses a fixed set of trump cards, so there is no need to turn one card over after dealing to determine them (the order of the suits remain the same, however). The ranking of the cards is as follows:\nAs an alternative, the game can also be played with only the cards up to the Queens, removing the weaker cards 4 through 7.\n\nMost teams communicate through body or facial signals as a way of making their partners aware of their hands without having to show it to everyone at the table. The signals for each trump card are standard among most players, making it easy for new teammates to communicate with each other without previously defining signals, although long-time partners usually develop their own unique signals. The standard signals are the following:\n\nSeñas are gestures that are used among players of the same team to tell the pie (hand captain) their most valuables cards or if they have good score for a potential envido situation. The most generally accepted señas are as follows:\n\nPerforming the señas during the game is a skill that takes time to master. The player has to be very careful not to be seen by players of the opposite team, although because of this the señas also can be used as a strategy to trick them (for example, show a gesture of a low valuable card and then play with an unexpected card).\n\nThere are lots of informal expressions that have become part of the art of playing the game. Examples of jargon are described below:\n\n\nIn \"Truco Paulista\", \"manilha\" are the cards of the next number of the one who was trumped at the beginning of the round. For example: if you trumped a 2, the manilha will be the 3s. Then, the strength of each manilha depends on the stamp, which follows (strongest to weakest): clubs (zap), hearts (copas), spades (espadilha), diamonds (pica-fumo).\n\nMany times jargon is used to make the other team believe one's team has better or worse cards than it really does. For instance: if one is holding the As of spades and a worthless card he could say \"estou seco\" I'm dry, to indicate he hasn't got any better cards so that the other team will go for a truco on the last hand.\n\n"}

The other two components of \"sangita\" are \"gita\" (vocal music, song) and \"nrtya\" (dance, movement). In the general sense, \"Vadya\" means an instrument and the characteristic music they produce, sound or play out.\n\nThe term \"Vadya\" in the sense of \"music, sounded, played, uttered\" appears in the Vedic literature such as in the \"Aitareya Brahmana\", and in early post-Vedic era Sanskrit texts such as the \"Natya Shastra\", \"Panchatantra\", \"Malvikagnimitra\" and \"Kathasaritsagara\". These texts call the musician or the performer on the musical instrument as \"Vadyadhara\". A stringed instrument is described with proportional lengths in \"Jaiminiya Brahmana\" and \"Aitareya Aranyaka\", and these are compared to poetical meters.\n\nThe Sanskrit literature such as \"Natya Shastra\" describes four types of \"Vadya\":\n\nThe chapter 14 of the \"Saṅgītaśiromaṇi\" describes musical ensembles based on a collective performance of \"vadya\" instruments by musicians, and it calls such a band orchestra as a \"Kutapa\". The term \"Vadya\" also appears in the Buddhist Sanskrit text \"Sukhavativyuha\", influential in the Chinese and Japanese traditions, which Luis Gomez translates as \"instrumental music\". The 17th-century text \"Sangeeta Darpana\" defines \"sangita\" (musical arts) as \"Gītam Vādyam Tathā Nrityam Trayan Sangeeta Muchyate\", which states Dona means, \"sangita\" comprises \"gīta\" (vocal music), \"vādya\" (instrumental music) and \"nritya\" (dance).\n\nIn Hindu-Javanese music tradition, \"Vadya\" is called \"Vaditra\". According to Roger Blench, most scholars consider the African term \"Valiha\" for tube zither to be rooted in the Sanskrit term \"Vadya\", reflecting a period of cultural exchange over the Indian Ocean.\n\n"}
{"id": "32685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32685", "title": "Victor Borge", "text": "Victor Borge\n\nBørge Rosenbaum (3 January 1909 – 23 December 2000), known professionally as Victor Borge ( ), was a Danish and American comedian, conductor, and pianist who achieved great popularity in radio and television in the United States and Europe. His blend of music and comedy earned him the nicknames \"The Clown Prince of Denmark,\" \"The Unmelancholy Dane,\" and \"The Great Dane.\"\n\nRosenbaum was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, into a Jewish family. His parents, Bernhard and Frederikke (Lichtinger) Rosenbaum, were both musicians: his father a violist in the Royal Danish Orchestra, and his mother a pianist. Borge began piano lessons at the age of two, and it was soon apparent that he was a prodigy. He gave his first piano recital when he was eight years old, and in 1918 was awarded a full scholarship at the Royal Danish Academy of Music, studying under Olivo Krause. Later on, he was taught by Victor Schiøler, Liszt's student Frederic Lamond, and Busoni's pupil Egon Petri.\n\nBorge played his first major concert in 1926 at the Danish Odd Fellow Palæet (\"The Odd Fellow's Lodge building\") concert hall. After a few years as a classical concert pianist, he started his now famous \"stand-up\" act, with the signature blend of piano music and jokes. He married American Elsie Chilton in 1933, the same year he debuted with his revue acts. Borge started touring extensively in Europe, where he began telling anti-Nazi jokes.\n\nWhen the German armed forces occupied Denmark on April 9, 1940, during World War II, Borge was playing a concert in Sweden and managed to escape to Finland. He traveled to America on the United States Army transport , the last neutral ship to make it out of Petsamo, Finland, and arrived 28 August 1940, with only $20 (about $ today), with $3 going to the customs fee. Disguised as a sailor, Borge returned to Denmark once during the occupation to visit his dying mother.\n\nEven though Borge did not speak a word of English upon arrival, he quickly managed to adapt his jokes to the American audience, learning English by watching movies. He took the name of Victor Borge, and in 1941, he started on Rudy Vallee's radio show. He was hired soon after by Bing Crosby for his \"Kraft Music Hall\" program.\n\nBorge quickly rose to fame, winning Best New Radio Performer of the Year in 1942. Soon after the award, he was offered film roles with stars such as Frank Sinatra (in \"Higher and Higher\"). While hosting \"The Victor Borge Show\" on NBC beginning in 1946, he developed many of his trademarks, including repeatedly announcing his intent to play a piece but getting \"distracted\" by something or other, making comments about the audience, or discussing the usefulness of Chopin's \"Minute Waltz\" as an egg timer. He would also start out with some well-known classical piece like Beethoven's \"Moonlight Sonata\" and suddenly move into a harmonically similar pop or jazz tune, such as Cole Porter's \"Night and Day\" or \"Happy Birthday to You.\"\n\nOne of Borge's other famous routines was \"Phonetic Punctuation,\" in which he read a passage from a book and added exaggerated sound effects to stand for all of the punctuation marks, such as periods, commas, and exclamation marks. Another is his \"Inflationary Language,\" in which he added one to every number or homophone of a number in the words he spoke. For example: \"once upon a time\" becomes \"twice upon a time,\" \"wonderful\" becomes \"twoderful,\" \"forehead\" becomes \"fivehead,\" \"anyone for tennis\" becomes \"anytwo five elevennis,\" \"I ate a tenderloin with my fork and so on and so forth\" becomes \"'I nine an elevenderloin with my five'k' and so on and so fifth.\"\n\nBorge used physical and visual elements in his live and televised performances. He would play a strange-sounding piano tune from sheet music, looking increasingly confused; turning the sheet upside down or sideways, he would then play the actual tune, flashing a joyful smile of accomplishment to the audience (he had, at first, been literally playing the tune upside down or sideways). When his energetic playing of another song would cause him to fall off the piano bench, he would open the seat lid, take out the two ends of an automotive seat belt, and buckle himself onto the bench, \"for safety.\" Conducting an orchestra, he might stop and order a violinist who had played a sour note to get off the stage, then resume the performance and have the other members of the section move up to fill the empty seat while they were still playing. From off stage would come the sound of a gunshot.\n\nHis musical sidekick in the 1960s, Leonid Hambro, was also a well-known concert pianist. In 1968, classical pianist Şahan Arzruni joined him as his straight man, performing together on one piano a version of Liszt's Second Hungarian Rhapsody, considered a musical-comedic classic.\n\nHe also enjoyed interacting with the audience. Seeing an interested person in the front row, he would ask them, \"Do you like good music?\" or \"Do you care for piano music?\" After an affirmative answer, Borge would take a piece of sheet music from his piano and say, \"Here is some,\" and hand it over. After the audience's laughter died down, he would say, \"That'll be $1.95\" (or whatever the current price might be). He would then ask whether the audience member could read music; if the member said yes, he would ask a higher price. If he got no response from the audience after a joke, he would often add \"...when this ovation has died down, of course.\" The delayed punchline to handing the person the sheet music would come when he would reach the end of a number and begin playing the penultimate notes over and over, with a puzzled look. He would then go back to the person in the audience, retrieve the sheet music, tear off a piece of it, stick it on the piano, and play the last couple of notes from it.\n\nMaking fun of modern theater, he would sometimes begin a performance by asking if there were any children in the audience. There always were, of course. He would sternly order them out, then say, \"We do have some children in here; that means I can't do the second half in the nude. I'll wear the tie. (pause) The long one. (pause) The very long one, yes.\"\n\nIn his stage shows in later years, he would include a segment with opera singer Marilyn Mulvey. She would try to sing an aria, and he would react and interrupt, with such antics as falling off the bench in \"surprise\" when she hit a high note. He would also remind her repeatedly not to rest her hand on the piano, telling her that if she got used to it, \"and one day a piano was not there – \"Fffftttt!\" \" After the routine, the spotlight would fall upon Mulvey and she would sing a serious number with Borge accompanying in the background.\n\nBorge appeared on \"Toast of the Town\" hosted by Ed Sullivan several times during 1948. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States the same year. He started the \"Comedy in Music \" show at John Golden Theatre in New York City on 2 October 1953. \"Comedy in Music\" became the longest running one-man show in the history of theater with 849 performances when it closed on 21 January 1956, a feat which placed it in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\".\n\nContinuing his success with tours and shows, Borge played with and conducted orchestras including the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic and London Philharmonic. Always modest, he felt honored when he was invited to conduct the Royal Danish Orchestra at the Royal Danish Theatre in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1992.\n\nHis later television appearances included his \"Phonetic Punctuation\" routine on \"The Electric Company\" in a filmed sketch. He would also use this sketch on \"The Electric Company\"'s LP record to follow, during its \"Punctuation\" song. In addition, he appeared several times on \"Sesame Street\", and he was a guest star during the fourth season of \"The Muppet Show\".\n\nVictor Borge continued to tour until his last days, performing up to 60 times per year when he was 90 years old.\n\nBorge made several appearances on the long-running TV show \"What's My Line?\", both as a celebrity panelist, and as a contestant with the occupation \"poultry farmer\" (the latter was not a comedy routine; as a business venture, Borge raised and popularized Rock Cornish game hens starting in the 1950s).\n\nBorge helped start several trust funds, including the Thanks to Scandinavia Fund, which was started in dedication to those who helped the Jews escape the German persecution during the war.\n\nAside from his musical work, Borge wrote three books, \"My Favorite Intermissions\" and \"My Favorite Comedies in Music\" (both with Robert Sherman), and the autobiography \"Smilet er den korteste afstand\" (\"The Smile is the Shortest Distance\") with Niels-Jørgen Kaiser.\n\nIn 1979, Borge founded the American Pianists Association (then called the Beethoven Foundation) with Julius Bloom and Anthony P. Habig. The American Pianists Association now produces two major piano competitions: the Classical Fellowship Awards and the Jazz Fellowship Awards.\n\nHe married his first wife, Elsie Chilton, in 1933. After divorcing Elsie, he married Sarabel Sanna Scraper in 1953, and they stayed married until her death at the age of 83 in September 2000.\n\nBorge had five children (who occasionally performed with him): Ronald Borge and Janet Crowle (adopted) with Elsie Chilton, and Sanna Feinstein, Victor Bernhard (Vebe) Jr., and Frederikke (Rikke) Borge with Sarabel.\n\nOn 23 December 2000, Borge died in Greenwich, Connecticut, at the age of 91, after more than 80 years of entertaining. He died peacefully in his sleep a day after returning from a concert in Denmark. \"It was just his time to go\", Frederikke Borge said. \"He's been missing my mother terribly.\" (His wife had died only three months earlier.)\n\nAs per Borge's wishes, his connection to both the United States and Denmark was marked by having part of his ashes interred at Putnam Cemetery in Greenwich, with a replica of the iconic Danish statue \"The Little Mermaid\" sitting on a large rock at the grave site, and the other part in Western Jewish Cemetery (\"Mosaisk Vestre Begravelsesplads\"), Copenhagen.\n\nBorge received an honorary degree from Trinity College Connecticut in 1997.\n\nWhen in 1998 the Royal Danish Orchestra celebrated its 550th anniversary, Borge was appointed an honorary member — at that time one of only ten in the orchestra's history.\n\nVictor Borge received numerous honorable awards and honors during the course of his career. Borge received Kennedy Center Honors in 1999. He was decorated with badges of chivalric orders by the five Nordic countries, receiving the Order of the Dannebrog, Order of Vasa, St. Olav's Medal, Order of the White Rose of Finland and Order of the Falcon.\n\nVictor Borge Hall, located in Scandinavia House in New York City, was named in Borge's honor in 2000, as was Victor Borges Plads (\"Victor Borge Square\") in Copenhagen in 2002. In 2009, a statue celebrating Borge's centennial was erected on the square.\n\nAsteroid (5634) Victorborge is named in his honor.\n\nFrom 23 January to 9 May 2009, the life of Borge was celebrated by The American-Scandinavian Foundation with \"Victor Borge: A Centennial Celebration.\"\n\nOn 14 March 2009, a television special about his life, \"100 Years of Music and Laughter\", aired on PBS.\n\nOn 7 February 2017, it was reported that, according to a press release by the Danish production company M&M Productions, both a television series and cinematic film about the life of Borge are set to be filmed in 2018.\n\n\n\n"}

The large wheel consists of two circles, which are connected with six spokes. The diameter of the wheel depends on the length of the gymnast, so that the gymnast can hold himself on the grips when fully stretched. The wheels are available from a diameter of 130 to 245cm. The wheels weigh between 40 and 60 kg. They are available in several depths and colors.\n\nThe wheel was invented in 1925 by Otto Feick in Schönau an der Brend. The grandson of a blacksmith, Feick was inspired by the memory of an event from his childhood in Reichenbach, when he had tied sticks between two hoops that his grandfather had made and rolled down a hill. \n\nHe filed for a patent as \"wheel-gymnastic and sports equipment\". He had invented the wheel in Ludwigshafen am Rhein ca. 1920-1922, on the grounds of the VSK Germania, a sports club, of which he was the founding chairman. The patent was issued on 8 November 1925; the name \"Rhönrad\" has been registered and protected since 1926 (\"Rhön\" is the name of the mountain region where the wheel was invented).\n\nThe Rhönrad was featured at the GeSoLei trade fair held in Düsseldorf in 1926.\n\nIn 1936, this sport was shown at the Olympic Games in Berlin, but was not presented as an Olympic discipline.\n\nThe focus of wheel gymnastics remains largely in Germany.\n\n"}
