{"id": "7391324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7391324", "title": "Billy the Puppet", "text": "Billy the Puppet\n\nBilly is a puppet that has appeared in the \"Saw\" franchise. It was used by John Kramer to communicate with his test subjects by delivering recorded messages, often appearing on a television screen or occasionally in person to describe the details of the traps and the means by which the test subjects could survive.\n\nIn the film series, before becoming the Jigsaw Killer, Kramer was believed to have created Billy to be given as a toy to his unborn child. However, Jill, his wife, is shown to miscarry after being hit in the stomach by a swinging hospital door due to Cecil ramming it open without looking. Kramer's unresolved anger was likely a primary motive for creating the puppet as a vehicle for his instructions trap victims. The traps he created can be seen as a manifestation of his anger with people who he feels don't appreciate having their life when his unborn baby was killed before having a life of its own.\n\nAlthough it has never actually been identified in the films, \"Billy\" is the name by which it is referred to by writers, directors, and members of the cast and crew on documentaries and interviews. The name was given to it by its real-life creator James Wan, who is the director and co-writer of \"Saw\". Some claim that the name is spelled \"Billie\", though Wan himself spells it \"Billy\".\n\nThe endurance and popularity of the \"Saw\" franchise has resulted in the production of Billy merchandise, as well as references in other media. Billy has become a type of mascot for the \"Saw\" series.\n\nBilly appears to be a male ventriloquist's dummy, as its jaw is movable to give the suggestion that it is talking; however, it is not used in the same manner, as the entire doll is frequently seen moving on its own. Its face is white, with a protruding brow and cheeks that have red spirals painted on them. His red lips form a grin. His eyes are black with red irises, and his head is topped with black, messy hair.\n\nBilly is always depicted wearing a black tuxedo, with a white shirt and gloves, red bow tie, and red handkerchief in the breast pocket. He also has red Mary Janes for shoes. In the short film, he is seen wearing a green bowler hat. He is often riding an old-fashioned red tricycle. The only sound originating directly from him is a generic electronic cackle much like one would find in a Halloween-type toy.\n\nAccording to Wan, the construction of the original puppet's face for \"Saw\" involved clay, papier-mâché, and black ping pong balls with the irises painted in for the eyes. Paper towel rolls were used internally. To make him move, the puppeteers pulled him along on a fishing line.\n\nFor \"Saw II\", Billy was redesigned with mechanical features that could be manipulated by a remote control, including his unhinged jaw and his eyes.\n\nFor \"Saw III\", the prop crew was given the original puppet, but found it unfit for work, as time had damaged it. Instead, they recreated Billy, using waterjet-cut foam for his body instead of fiberglass, equipped with plates to hold the puppet together and magnets to attach him to his tricycle. The back of his head was removable, to make it easier to slide animatronic pieces in.\n\nFor \"Saw IV\", the prop crew again made the body of waterjet-cut foam, held together by metal rods. They used strong magnets to make a flat rear for the puppet, so it could be easily positioned on any metal surface. The resin-filled ping-pong ball eyes were moved with a remote control, as was the mouth.\n\nIn the first \"Saw\" movie, Billy is seen on a television set by Amanda Young, telling her about the reverse bear trap that was hooked into her jaws, and explaining that the key to remove it is in the stomach of her \"dead cellmate\" (who is actually a heavily sedated man) lying in the room. After she disembowels the man and frees herself, Billy comes into the room on his tricycle to congratulate her.\n\nLater, Adam remembers seeing the puppet in his apartment when the lights went out. As he was searching through the dark rooms using his camera flash, the puppet's eerie laugh rang through the apartment, and Adam hit it with a bat until it stopped.\n\nWhen Detectives David Tapp and Steven Sing uncover Jigsaw's latest hideout, they snoop around the area and pull the blankets off several covered items, one of which proves to be Billy.\n\nIn \"Saw II\", Billy is seen on the screen at the beginning of the film, giving Michael hints about the death mask he is wearing. It plays out similarly to Amanda's test, except Michael dies.\n\nLater, when the detectives discover Jigsaw's new hideout, several officers walk up a caged staircase and are greeted by Billy, who wheels into sight at the top of the stairs on his tricycle and laughs. The cage then becomes electrified after one officer steps on a rigged stair that breaks his legs.\n\nIn \"Saw III\", Jigsaw is seen constructing Billy in a flashback for the purpose of Amanda's game, painting the puppet's face. Later, Billy appears on videotape to inform both Troy and Kerry of their respective traps. The puppet is also seen in the background of a flashback that features Jigsaw and Amanda discussing her loyalty.\n\nHe is also used to remind Jeff Denlon of his dead son at one point, by being laid down next to his tricycle in the same position Jeff's son was in when he was killed. The puppet gives a mocking laugh until Jeff beats it into silence.\n\nAfter Jeff cuts Jigsaw's throat, a reflection of Billy can be seen on Jigsaw's heart rate monitor for a split second.\n\nBilly is first seen in \"Saw IV\" when Rigg awakes after being attacked in his apartment and rendered unconscious. Rigg opens his bathroom door, pulling a trigger-wire from a TV set. Billy appears on the screen to explain Rigg's game. Upon leaving the room, Rigg is greeted by another message concerning his first test, referring to a woman Jigsaw deemed to be a criminal that had been placed in a machine that would scalp her.\n\nAgents Peter Strahm and Lindsey Perez later find Billy in a room in a school, sitting on a chair surrounded by candles. From a microcassette recorder hung around the puppet's neck, Perez learns that her partner will soon take the life of an innocent man (who is later revealed to be Jeff Denlon), and that her next move is critical. Billy's eyes begin turning to Perez while a low voice on the tape murmurs, \"Open the door.\" Perez leans in to hear this last, at which point Billy's face explodes, blowing shrapnel into her face and neck. Perez collapses into Strahm's arms as Billy begins to laugh.\n\nThere is also a flashback of Jigsaw giving a less menacing, early version of Billy to Jill Tuck as a gift for their unborn son Gideon. An interview with Tobin Bell revealed that this was the beginning of a storyline concerning the origins of Billy, as well as his tricycle, to be explored in future \"Saw\" films.\n\nBilly appeared in the opening sequence of \"Saw V\", to tell Seth Baxter the rules of his game, which is later revealed to have been set up by Mark Hoffman to frame Jigsaw and kill Seth. It is unknown how Hoffman created the tape for this game. According to a list of potential Jigsaw victims, Seth was the third person tested after Cecil and Mark. In those tests, Jigsaw didn't use a puppet.\n\nBilly is also seen at the beginning of all of the team's traps.\n\nThe early version of Billy from a \"Saw IV\" flashback is seen in the background of a flashback explaining the connection between Jigsaw and Hoffman.\n\nIn \"Saw VI\", Billy appears on tape in the opening trap, which pits Simone and Eddie against each other. He also addresses William Easton during two of his four tests (Jigsaw himself addresses William via video in his first test). He appears \"in person\" in William's second test by way of hanging from a noose, and on video in the fourth. \"Saw VI\" marks the first time Billy was purposefully shown in person to deliver test information to victims. Snippets of the Seth Baxter tape which Billy is featured in are also played.\n\nBilly appears in \"Saw 3D\". He gives Brad and Ryan instructions to their trap in person, does the same for Bobby Dagen's second test, and appears on tape for the others. When Hoffman goes to his hideout after he escapes the Reverse Beartrap, multiple Billy heads can be seen. His final appearance is in Hoffman's secret hideout at the end of the film; Hoffman blows it up, destroying Billy in the explosion. Billy's voice is changed, as if Jigsaw is using a voice changer, implying that it was Hoffman who recorded the tapes.\n\nBilly returns for the eighth Saw film titled \"Jigsaw\". He was first shown in the official trailer on his iconic tricycle. He is shown this time with illuminated eyes and shoes. In the film, he only appears twice. He appears once on his tricycle with a letter around his neck with the word \"Confess\" written on it. The second time is on tape with his eyes lit up for the grain silo trap.\n\nIn the Original Saw short film, Billy is seen on a television set by David, telling him about the reverse bear trap that was hooked into his jaws, and explaining that the key to remove it is in the stomach of his \"dead cellmate\" (who is actually a heavily sedated man) lying in the room. After he disembowels the man and frees himself, Billy comes into the room on his tricycle to congratulate him.\n\nIn the 2007 film \"Dead Silence\", one of the puppets, who appears on the film's poster and wears the same outfit as Jigsaw's puppet, is named Billy. The \"Saw\" puppet is also seen in the movie for a brief second, in a shot that reveals all of Mary Shaw's puppets in the attic above the theatre.\n\nA graffiti-style painting of Billy's face can be seen on a wall in James Wan's film \"Death Sentence\".\n\nIn the 2011 film \"Insidious\" there is a scene in which Josh (the father) is working late in the classroom and Billy is drawn in chalk on the blackboard behind his head. Underneath the drawing the number eight is shown, hinting at Jigsaw.\n\nBilly the Puppet makes a cameo appearance as the parody antagonist.\n\nA graffiti-style painting of Billy's face can be seen on a wall in Leigh Whannell's film \"Upgrade\".\n\nBilly can be seen in the corners of two panels near the beginning of \"\", foreshadowing John's eventual transformation into Jigsaw. The comic also appears to mark Billy as one of John's creations at the toy factory where he worked, but this backstory was negated in \"Saw IV\".\n\nBilly, voiced by Tobin Bell, appears throughout \"Saw: The Video Game\" delivering hints and objectives to the player. He also featured prominently in marketing for the game. In the Freedom ending, Billy's reflection is seen on a T.V. when Tapp commits suicide.\n\nHe returns in \"\", the sequel to the first game, also voiced by Tobin Bell. Billy repeats his role as in the first game, giving hints and clues to the player. The player can also collect small Billy dolls throughout the game, which require solving more complicated puzzles to obtain them; they are off of the main path, so the player does not have to get them. \"Flesh & Blood\" is also the only time in the \"Saw\" franchise that he is actually called \"Billy.\"\n\nDead By Daylight: Chapter VII the SAW chapter.\nBilly is in the video game 'Dead by Daylight' as a NPC as part of the SAW chapter DLC.\nHe appears when the player chooses 'the Pig' a licenced character from Saw. He is also seen in the map 'The Game, gideon's meatplant,'\n\nSaw – The Ride\n\nBilly appears on numerous screens throughout the queue line of Saw – The Ride at Thorpe Park, England telling riders that they are not worthy of the life they have been given, implicating the ride to be one of Jigsaw's traps. He also appears on his tricycle at the start of the ride itself, riders on the second dispatched car (two cars are dispatched one after the other), the vehicle will stop while Billy gives a speech, informing you that there is no escape, and proclaiming, \"Here's what happens when you lose\", before allowing the train to pass – this regulates the distance between cars. He can also be seen before the car travels up the lift hill, appearing on a screen and saying \"GAME OVER\", and at the end of the ride, where his head can be seen on a shelf covered with body parts.\n\nSaw - The Maze\n\nThe Saw Alive maze, also in Thorpe Park, allows parkgoers to be photographed with Billy.\n\nSaw: Game Over\n\nIn the U.S., Billy appears several times in the maze Saw: Game Over at Orlando Horror Nights at Universal Studios Florida.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4333783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4333783", "title": "Cinema of Thailand", "text": "Cinema of Thailand\n\nThe cinema of Thailand dates back to the early days of filmmaking, when King Chulalongkorn's 1897 visit to Bern, Switzerland was recorded by François-Henri Lavancy-Clarke. The film was then brought to Bangkok, where it was exhibited. This sparked more interest in film by the Thai Royal Family and local businessmen, who brought in filmmaking equipment and started to exhibit foreign films. By the 1920s, a local film industry was started and in the 1930s, the Thai film industry had its first \"golden age\", with a number of studios producing films.\n\nThe years after the Second World War saw a resurgence of the industry, which used 16 mm film to produce hundreds of films, many of them hard-driving action films. Competition from Hollywood brought the Thai industry to a low point in the 1980s and 1990s, but by the end of the 1990s, Thailand had its \"new wave\", with such directors as Nonzee Nimibutr, Pen-Ek Ratanaruang and Apichatpong Weerasethakul, as well as action hero Tony Jaa, being celebrated at film festivals around the world.\n\nAuguste and Louis Lumière had a film exhibition that toured in Southeast Asia in 1894, and on 9 June 1897, \"the wonderful Parisian cinematograph\" was screened in Bangkok, and is the first known film screening in Thailand.\n\nThat same year, the film of the visit to Europe by King Chulalongkorn was brought back to Thailand, along with camera equipment acquired by the king's brother, Prince Thongthaem Sambassatra. () The prince, considered \"the father of Thai cinema\", made many films and his work was shown commercially.\n\nJapanese businessmen opened the first permanent cinema, the Japanese Cinematograph, in 1905. Japanese films were so popular that \"nang yipun\" became the generic term for all moving pictures. European and American films were called \"nang farang\" (after the nang drama (shadow puppet plays) that were a Thai traditional art).\n\nUnder another member of the royal family, Prince Kamphangphet, the Topical Film Service of the State Railway of Thailand was set up. The service produced many promotional documentaries for the railroad and other government agencies and became an important training ground for many filmmakers. One of the early works produced was\n\"Sam Poi Luang: Great Celebration in the North\" (Thai: สามปอยหลวง), a docudrama that became a hit when it was released in 1940.\n\nAnother of the first Thai films was \"Nang Sao Suwan\", or \"Miss Suwanna of Siam\", a Hollywood co-production with the Topical Film Service that was directed and scripted by Henry MacRae. It premiered on 22 June 1923, in Bangkok at the Phathanakorn Cinematograph. Unfortunately, \"Miss Suwanna\" has been lost over the years, with only a few still photos from it remaining.\n\nThe first all-Thai feature was \"Chok Sorng Chan\" (\"Double Luck\"), produced by the Wasuwat brothers' Bangkok Film Company in 1927 and directed by Manit Wasuwat (Thai: มานิต วสุวัต). That same year, a film company, Tai Phapphayon Thai Company, produced \"Mai Khit Loei\" (\"Unexpected\").\n\nSeventeen films were made between 1927 and 1932, but only fragments have survived, such as a one-minute car chase from \"Chok Song Chan\" or a two- to three-minute boxing match from \"Khrai Di Khrai Dai\" (\"None But the Brave\").\n\nHollywood would also make movies in Siam during this time, including the documentary, \"Chang\", by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, about a poor farmer struggling to carve out a living in the jungle. In making the film, they were assisted by Prince Yugala Dighambara, grandfather of modern-day filmmaker Prince Chatrichalerm Yukol.\n\nRobert Kerr, who served as assistant director to Henry MacRae on \"Miss Suwanna\" returned to Siam in 1928 to direct his own film, \"The White Rose\". It was shown in Bangkok in September 1928.\n\nBy 1928, the first \"talkies\" were being imported, providing some heavy competition for the silent Thai films. In the tradition of the benshi in Japan, local cinemas had entertaining narrators to introduce the films as well as traditional Thai orchestras that were often as big an audience pleaser as the films themselves, and but within two or three years, silent movies had given way to the talkies.\n\nThe first Thai sound film was \"Long Thang\" (\"Gone Astray\"), produced by the Wasuwat brothers, and premiered on 1 April 1932. Considered an ideological film in the period of political reform, the film proved a big success and led to the building of the Sri Krung Talkie Film Company in Bang Kapi. It produced three to four films a year.\n\nIn 1933, Sri Krung made the first colour Thai film, \"Grandpa Som's Treasure\" (\"Pu Som Fao Sap\").\n\nThis period up until 1942 is regarded by scholars as the \"Golden Age\" for Thai film.\n\nAmong the hit films of this period was the 1938 musical, \"Klua Mia\" (\"Wife-phobia\") by the Srikrung studio. It was shot on 35-mm colour stock. The stars were Chamras Suwakhon and Manee Sumonnat, the first Thai actors to be recognized as movie stars by having their names painted on their chairs while filming at the studio.\n\nAs the Second World War loomed, and the country being led by a dictatorship under Field Marshal Plaek Pibulsonggram film companies were pressed into service to make propaganda films to whip up nationalism.\n\nOpposition politics found their way into film, too, with statesman Pridi Phanomyong producing \"King of the White Elephant\", in 1940. With all the dialogue in English, Pridi hoped to send a message to the outside world that he was unhappy with the militaristic direction his country was taking. The film depicts the story of an ancient Siamese king who only goes to war after he's been attacked.\n\nThe advent of sound raised another problem for cinemas in Thailand: the language of the talkies. Soon a dubbing method developed in which a dubber would provide a simultaneous translation of the dialogue by speaking Thai into a microphone at the back of the theater. The first Thai dubber was Sin Sibunruang, or \"Tit Khiaw\", who had worked for Siam Film Company and was the editor of the company's film magazine. Tit Khiaw and other talented dubbers became stars in their own right. They would perform all the roles in the films, both male and female, as well as such sound effects as animal noises, cars and gunfire.\n\nAlso, there were film companies that could not afford to make sound films, and would make films with the intention that they would be dubbed at screenings by live performers reading from a script. These dubbed films proved as popular as the talkies, especially if the dubber was well known.\n\nDue to the extensive use of 16 mm film in the 1970s, the technique has lasted up until recent years, especially for outdoor screenings of films at temple fairs in rural areas. Examples of a dubber at work can be seen in contemporary Thai films, \"Monrak Transistor\" (2000) and \"Bangkok Loco\" (2004).\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War, filmmaking got under way again in Thailand using surplus 16 mm black-and-white stock from wartime newsreel production.\n\nAt least two Thai films were produced in 1946. One was an action film, \"Chai Chatree\" (\"Brave Men\"), directed by journalist-turned-filmmaker Chalerm Sawetanant. The screenplay was by writer Malai Chupinij, who would go on to script other films of the era, including \"Chao Fah Din Salai\" (\"Till Death Do Us Part\"). The other film noted by the National Film Archive for 1946 was an adaptation of a Thai folktale, \"Chon Kawao\" (\"The Village of Chon Kawao\").\n\nThe post-war boom in filmmaking really took off, however, with the use of 16-mm colour-reversal film, which was easy to obtain and make films with. The vividly coloured films were popular with audiences as well, prompting dozens of new filmmakers to enter the business.\n\nSimilar to the dubbing of films during the pre-war years, some of these films used dubbers to provide dialogue and sound effects as the film was running, further adding to the entertainment value of the movies. From 1947 until 1972, 16 mm was the industry standard for Thai film production.\n\nThe first hit of the era was 1949's \"Suparb Burut Sua Thai\" (\"Thai Gentlemen Fighters\"), which outgrossed Hollywood films at the local box office. That success prompted more enthusiasm for filmmaking, giving rise to the second \"golden age\" of Thai cinema.\n\nAt the height of the 16-mm era, cinematographer and director Rattana Pestonji sought to use 35 mm film and generally improve the artistic quality of Thai films. Most of his films are regarded today as masterpieces, including \"Santi-Weena\", which was the first Thai film to be entered into international competition, at the 1954 Asia Pacific Film Festival in Tokyo, and 1961's \"Black Silk\", the first Thai film in competition at the Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nThough Rattana made relatively few films, he worked tirelessly to promote the industry, and died in 1970 as he was to make a speech to government officials about setting up a national film agency.\n\nThailand saw an explosion of locally produced films during the 1970s after the Thai government imposed a heavy tax on imported films in 1977, which led to a boycott of Thailand by Hollywood studios. To pick up the slack, 150 Thai films were made in 1978 alone. Many of these films were low-grade action films and were derided by critics and scholars as \"nam nao\" or \"stinking water\".\n\nBut socially conscious films were being made as well, especially by Prince Chatrichalerm Yukol, a US-educated filmmaker and member of the Thai Royal Family, whose own family had been involved with filmmaking since the industry started in Thailand. Among Chatrichalerm's films during the 1970s was \"Khao Chue Karn\" (\"Dr. Karn\"), which addressed corruption in the Thai civil service and was nearly banned by the military-dominated regime of Thanom Kittikachorn. Chatrichalerm also made \"Hotel Angel\" (\"Thep Thida Rong Raem\"), about a young woman trapped into a life of prostitution. He made dozens of films along these socially conscious lines through the 1990s, working up to his lavish historical epic, \"The Legend of Suriyothai\" in 2001.\n\nAnother filmmaker active during this time was Vichit Kounavudhi, who made his share of action films as well as more socially conscious works like \"First Wife\", about the custom of men taking \"second wives\" or \"mia noi\" – a euphemism for mistress. Vichit also made \"Her Name is Boonrawd\" (1985), about prostitution around an American military airbase during the Vietnam War. Vichit's best known works are two semi-documentary films, \"Mountain People\" (\"Khon Phukao\"), an adventure tale about a young hill-tribe couple, and \"Look Isan\" (\"Son of the Northeast\"), about a family of subsistence farmers in 1930s Isan.\n\nAlso in 1985, director Euthana Mukdasanit made \"Pee Seua lae Dawkmai\" (\"Butterfly and Flowers\"), highlighting hardships along the Southern Thailand border. Not only did the film help expose urban Thais to regional poverty, the film broke new ground in its portrayal of a Buddhist-Muslim relationship. It won the Best Film award at the Hawaii International Film Festival.\n\nBy 1981, Hollywood studios were once again sending films to Thailand. Also, television (see also Media in Thailand) was a growing part of Thai culture. This was a low period for the Thai film industry, and by the mid-1990s, studio output was averaging about 10 films per year.\n\nIn the wake of the Asian financial crisis in 1997, three directors of television commercials – Nonzee Nimibutr, Pen-Ek Ratanaruang and Wisit Sasanatieng – were thinking that films needed to be more artistic to attract investors and audiences.\n\nThe first breakthrough was in 1997, with Nonzee's crime drama, \"Dang Bireley's and Young Gangsters\" (\"2499 Antapan Krong Muang\"), which earned a record box office take of more than 75 million baht. Also in 1997, Pen-Ek's crime comedy, \"Fun Bar Karaoke\", was selected to play at the Berlin Film Festival – the first time in twenty years that Thai cinema had had any kind of an international presence.\n\nNonzee's next film, the ghost story \"Nang Nak\", was an even bigger success, earning 149.6 million baht – the highest-grossing film at the time.\n\nWisit, who wrote screenplays for \"Dang Bireley's\" and \"Nang Nak\", broke out with \"Tears of the Black Tiger\", a super-stylised western homage to the Thai action films of the 1960s and '70s. It was the first film to be included on the programme at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThere were also the Pang Brothers from Hong Kong, who came to Thailand to make stylish movies, starting with \"Bangkok Dangerous\" and the nod to J-Horror, \"The Eye\".\n\nWith the New Wave directors achieving commercial and artistic success, a new crop of filmmakers has grown up outside the traditional and often restrictive Thai studio system to create experimental short films and features.\n\nThe leader of this indie movement is Apichatpong Weerasethakul, whose 2002 feature \"Blissfully Yours\" won the Un Certain Regard Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Featuring a risqué sex scene involving a Burmese man and a Thai woman in the jungle, the movie received only limited screenings in Thailand and a Thai-released DVD of the film was censored. Apichatpong's next film, \"Tropical Malady\", featuring a gay romance between an army soldier and a country guy, was a jury-prize winner at Cannes. It, too, only received limited screenings in Thailand.\n\nOther indie directors include Aditya Assarat (\"Wonderful Town\"), Anocha Suwichakornpong (\"Mundane History\"), Pimpaka Towira (\"One Night Husband\"), Thunska Pansittivorakul (\"Voodoo Girls\"), Sivaroj Kongsakul (\"Eternity\"), Wichanon Somumjarn (\"In April the Following Year, There Was a Fire\") and Nawapol Thamrongrattanarit (\"36\").\n\nAll films, VCDs and DVDs are placed under scrutiny of a censorship board. Until 2009, films were regulated by the Film Act of 1930.\n\nThe first board of censors included both men and women and was drawn from the ranks of aristocracy, the civil service and the police. Each film passed by the censors had to include a stamp on each reel, and each item of printed advertising had to contain the stamp, too. The National Police was responsible for screening films and videos until September 2005, when the government's Ministry of Culture took over the function. Every VCD and DVD sold for home viewing must bear a stamp that it has passed the Censorship Board.\n\nOn some VCDs and DVDs produced in Thailand, the censors sometimes take a hard line against depictions of nudity, sex, smoking, the presence of alcohol and guns being pointed at people, images that are forbidden on broadcast television. In other instances, violent acts might pass through uncut, but sex and nudity will be edited out.\n\nBefore the digital age, scissors and petroleum jelly were the tools of the trade for censors. Today the offending images are blurred out electronically. The effect of pixelization is so pervasive that the practice has been satirised in films, including 2004's action comedy, \"Jaew\" or \"M.A.I.D.\", as well as the zombie comedy, \"SARS Wars\".\n\nImported DVDs are generally not altered by the Thai authorities, though the Ministry of Culture's watchdogs do ban items, or at least strongly encourage retailers to not carry them. From the time the Ministry of Culture took over the censorship board until March 2006, about 40 VCD or DVD titles were banned, though a list of the banned items was not made available.\n\nIn 2007, the independent film, \"Syndromes and a Century\" was to undergo cuts before public release in Thailand. The censors objected to depictions of a Buddhist monk playing guitar, a physician kissing his girlfriend, some doctors drinking whisky in a hospital conference room and some monks playing with a remote-control flying saucer. Director Apichatpong Weerasethakul would not make the cuts and withdrew his film from release in Thailand. It had previously screened in other countries uncut.\n\nAfter the controversy over \"Syndromes and a Century\", the Free Thai Cinema Movement started to gain momentum in late April 2007. A petition signed by artists and scholars was submitted to the National Legislative Assembly, which was considering a new motion picture ratings system. The proposed system, passed by the military-appointed National Legislative Assembly proved controversial as well, as it would not imposes ratings structure but also keeps censorship in place.\n\nThe 1930 Film Act was replaced in 2009 by a film-ratings system. The ratings system has six classifications – G for general audiences, P for \"promote\" as educational, 13+, 15+ and 18+ suggested viewing ages and the restricted 20- rating, which requires ID checks at the cinemas. A hidden seventh tier of the system is an outright ban by the Film and Video sub-committee.\n\nAction films are a predominant genre of Thai film. During the 1960s and '70s, when Mitr Chaibancha and Sombat Metanee were the leading action heroes, hundreds of hard-hitting, explosive features were made.\n\nIn recent years, the martial arts films starring Tony Jaa, \"\" and \"Tom-Yum-Goong\", have put Thai action films on the international map. \"Kerd ma lui\" (\"Born to Fight\") is in the same vein, and gives more exposure to action choreographer Panna Rittikrai, who toiled for decades making low-budget, direct-to-video action films featuring dangerous stunt choreography.\n\nThe culture of Thailand's B-movie stuntmen is further examined in the 2005 documentary, \"Crying Tigers\", by Santi Taepanich.\n\nAction comedies have also proven to be popular, including 2001's \"Killer Tattoo\" by Yuthlert Sippapak, who cast well-known Thai comedians, including Petchtai Wongkamlao and Suthep Po-ngam, in roles as bumbling hitmen.\n\nThai animation got underway after the Second World War, when artist Sanae Klaikluen was asked by the Thai government to make a short animated cartoon that instructed Thai citizens to wear hats and farmers to wear boots.\n\nSanae in turn influenced Payut Ngaokrachang, who made a 1955 short about a traffic cop called \"Haed Mahasajan\". Payut went on to make Thailand's first and only cel-animated feature film, \"The Adventure of Sudsakorn\", in 1979.\n\nBecause of the labour-intensive work involved with animation, it was cheaper for studios to make live-action films, so animation was eschewed. But in recent years, Thailand's technology community has sought to make the country a hub for computer animation, with many animated television shows, commercials and video games being created in Thailand.\n\nIn 2006, Thailand's first computer-animated feature film was released, \"Khan Khluay\", about King Naresuan the Great's war elephant. It is directed by Kompin Kemgunerd, on such Disney features as \"\" and \"Tarzan\" and Blue Sky Studios' \"Ice Age\". Although the work is being done on computers, Kompin has faced many of the same difficulties in funding and human resources that Payut faced.\n\nNo matter what the genre of Thai film, most films – be they action, horror or romantic dramas – have some element of comedy.\n\nOne of the classic comedies from the 1960s is called \"Ngern Ngern Ngern\" (\"Money, Money, Money\"). It starred Mitr Chaibancha and Petchara Chaowarat in a story about the nephew of an unscrupulous moneylender who takes sides with a group of debtors against his uncle. The remake of the film was done in the 1980s.\n\nIn 2005, the comedy \"Luang phii theng\" (\"The Holy Man\") starring comedian Pongsak Pongsuwan as a street hood who poses as a Buddhist monk, was one of the top films at the domestic box office.\n\nMost of the films by Pen-Ek Ratanaruang have been crime films, from his debut feature 1997's \"Fun Bar Karaoke\" to 2006's \"Invisible Waves\".\n\nA true-crime film, 2003's \"Macabre Case of Prom Pirom\" (\"Keunbab prompiram\") by veteran director Manop Udomdej, about a 1977 murder-rape of a young woman in a rural village was controversial because the village where the case took place did not want the incident revisited. The film played at many overseas festivals, including the New York Asian Film Festival.\n\nAnother true-crime case about a cannibalistic serial killer in 1946 Bangkok was depicted in the 2004 film \"Zee-Oui\".\n\nKathoey (transsexual/transvestite) or gays are often featured as comic relief or villains in mainstream Thai films, but there have been a number of films that make gays and kathoey the main characters. Transvestites and gays are also known as \"tdoot\", originated from the title of the 1982 American film \"Tootsie\".\nOne of the first was Youngyooth Thongkonthun's \"Iron Ladies\", or \"Satree lek\", based on a true story about a transsexual/transvestite gay men's volleyball team that won a national championship in 1996. It was a huge hit on the international festival circuit. The 2000 comedy spawned a sequel in 2003, \"The Iron Ladies 2\" \"(Satree lek 2)\".\nMore loosely based on a true incident was the 2002 film \"Saving Private Tootsie\", which tells the story of a group of gay and kathoey entertainers who are lost in rebel-held jungle territory after their plane crashes. A squad from the Thai army, led by a gruff, homophobic sergeant played by veteran actor Sorapong Chatree, goes to the rescue.\nAnd the life of transgender Muay Thai champion Parinya Kiatbusaba (or Nong Tum) is related in 2003's \"Beautiful Boxer\", directed by Ekachai Uekorngtham. Unlike \"The Iron Ladies\", \"Beautiful Boxer\" was less comedic in tone.\nThe 2003 film \"Tropical Malady\", directed by Apichatpong Weerasethakul, depicts a romance between a Thai army soldier and a local small-town boy. The narrative of the film then abruptly shifts in the middle to relate a folk tale about a tiger shaman, with the soldier alone in the jungle, haunted by the tiger-shaman's spirit. The film won a jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival.\nApichatpong also co-directed the low-budget digital movie, \"The Adventure of Iron Pussy\", with artist Michael Shaowanasai, who portrays a transvestite secret agent. A musical, the movie also was an homage and a parody of the Thai films of the 1960s and '70s, with Shaowansai basing his character on the actress Petchara Chaowarat.\nIn 2005, Thai film \"Rainbow Boys\", depicting a contemporary gay relationship, produced by Vitaya Saeng-aroon, saw a limited-release screening. Vitaya also produced the comedy-drama \"Club M2\", set in a gay sauna. And in 2006 there was \"The Last Song\", a remake of a 1985 Thai film about a transsexual cabaret dancer and her struggle to find acceptance and true love.\n\"Me ... Myself\" ( or \"Kaw hai rak jong jaroen\") is a 2007 Thai romantic drama film written and directed by actor-singer Pongpat Wachirabunjong. In the film, Ananda Everingham stars as a male dancer in a transvestite cabaret who must re-find himself after being struck by a car and suffering from amnesia.\nAnother 2007 film, \"Bangkok Love Story\", directed by Poj Arnon, was critically hailed as a departure from the stereotyped view of homosexuals as transvestites and transsexuals.\nGay Thai independent film producer similarly praised the film, saying director Poj Arnon was \"brave enough to shake society up\".\n\nIn 2011, Thanwarin Sukhaphisit's Insects in the Backyard, a movie depicting the struggles of a family in which a transgender teenage son and daughter's lives are tormented by a lack of communication and an inability to communicate with their biological father to the point that they end up selling their bodies looking, very much in vain, for a way out of their own lives, became the first film to receive the Haw Heep rating, which banned the distribution and showing of the film. There is one scene which the national board of film reviewers deemed to be pornographic in nature and therefore determined in an impediment to national order.\n\nIn 2012, Thanwarin's It Gets Better is marketed to a more mainstream audience, and was admitted by the film committee. The film portrays the story of a young boy whose father forces him to become a monk after he catches him wearing his mother's clothes and dancing around effeminately in his room. At first the boy resists, but is then captivated by the beauty of the monk who comes out of the temple, and so immediately changes his mind. The story runs alongside two other narratives, one of a man returned to Thailand to sell his father's business and the other of a woman whose purpose seems unclear throughout the story until the very end. We find out that the monk is the woman, who has come back to see her father but is killed by a thief before she can make amends with him. It turns out the bar/dance club was hers and her death is the reason for her son's return to Thailand; his father's identity was kept from him his whole life, but after he learns everything from his biological father's office, he goes to see his grandfather and the story ends. \n\nAnother staple of the Thai film industry, among the biggest was 2003's \"The Legend of Suriyothai\" by Chatrichalerm Yukol, who had done research for many years to write the screenplay. With a huge budget, support from the royal family and the cooperation across the nation's film industry, this film is considered a true \"national film\". A follow-up epic is 2007's \"King Naresuan\", about 16th century ruler King Naresuan the Great, which topped the budget for \"Suriyothai\", and was shown in two parts.\n\nOther epics include \"Bang Rajan\" by Thanit Jitnukul, who has made several other historical battle epics, including \"\" and \"\".\n\nMore recent history is depicted in \"The Overture\", covering the life of a palace musician from the late 19th century to the 1940s, and \"The Tin Mine\", set at a mine in southern Thailand in the 1950s.\n\nMany of the Thai early horror movies such as 1958 \"Mae Nak Phra Khanong\" and 1973 movie \"Krasue Sao\" (Ghosts of Guts Eater), , featured Mae Nak and Krasue, ancient village ghosts of Thai folklore that became very popular.\nNonzee Nimibutr's \"Nang Nak\" in 1999 was a ghost story based on the same folkloric theme that had been depicted dozens of times throughout the history of Thai cinema and television. But it gave rise to a new crop of Thai horror and suspense films, including the Pang Brothers' \"The Eye\", Nonzee's pan-Asian compilation \"Three\", \"Bangkok Haunted\", directed by Pisuth Praesaeng-Iam and Oxide Pang and the 2004 box-office smash \"Shutter\" by Banjong Pisonthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom.\n\nIn 2013, Pee Mak Phra Khanong - another spin-off from \"Mae Nak\" folklore - became an instant hit throughout Southeast Asia, earning more than ฿ 1 Billion. \"Pee Mak\" is currently the highest grossing Thai film in the history of Thai cinema. \n\nExamples of slasher movies include \"Art of the Devil\" and a 2005 sequel (Long khong), as well as \"Scared\" and \"Narok\" (\"Hell\"), also in 2005.\n\nThe horror genre also has spawned a number of genre-blending horror comedies, most notably the films of Yuthlert Sippapak, \"Buppah Rahtree\" (featured at the Toronto International Film Festival) and a sequel, and \"Krasue Valentine\". There has even been a zombie movie, 2004's \"SARS Wars\".\nThe biggest hit musical was 1970's \"Monrak luk thung\" (\"Magical Love in the Countryside\"), starring Mitr Chaibancha and Petchara Chaowarat. It was hugely popular, playing in cinemas for six months.\n\nAs a result, a whole genre of luk thung musicals, rhapsodizing Thailand's rural life in Isan was created. Another example was Dokdin Kanyamarn's 1971 musical comedy, \"Ai Tui\" (\"Mr. Tui\"), which starred Sombat Metanee and Petchara.\n\nIn 2001 there were two movies that celebrated luk thung, the singing-contest comedy \"Monpleng Luk Thung FM\" (\"Hoedown Showdown\") and Pen-Ek Ratanaruang's, \"Monrak Transistor\", which paid tribute to the music of Suraphol Sombatcharoen. And in 2005, comedian-actor-director Petchtai Wongkamlao wrote, directed and starred in \"Yam Yasothon\", a colourful homage to the 1970s musicals. It was one of top films at the Thai box office.\n\nWeepy, sentimental romance stories are audience favorites. Historically, Cherd Songsri's 1970s film \"Plae Chow\" (\"The Old Scar\") is a classic tale of star-crossed lovers, and was one of the first Thai films to be a success internationally.\n\nDuring the 1980s, \"Baan Sai Thong\" based on the novel \"Kor Surangkanang\" was a popular hit. More recent examples include \"The Letter\", in which tissues were actually handed out at the cinemas.\n\nChildhood romance was a hit with 2003's \"Fan Chan\", which was made by six directors. One of the six, Komgrit Treewimol, went on to make the college-age romance, \"Dear Dakanda\", a hit in 2005, but took three years to completely write, cast, film, and tweak.\n\nAs a genre, teen films arose in the 1970s, with director Piak Poster's \"Wai Ounlawon\", about a young man whose courtship of a teenaged girl puts him at odds with the girl's irascible father. That young couple, portrayed by the original actors, were revisited 30 years later as embattled parents in the 2005 sequel, \"Wai Ounlawon 4\" (\"Oops ... There's Dad\").\n\nMusic was an important component of the teen films, with a musical interlude featured prominently in the film and a soundtrack album that would be a popular hit. This was the case with both \"Wai Ounlawon\" and its recent sequel.\n\nAnother noteworthy film of this genre is \"Fake\", which was the debut film by Thanakorn Pongsuwan. The film's modern, visual style offers a sharp-focus snapshot of the city of Bangkok and a plausible account of the mating game in its current forms.\n\nIn the burgeoning independent film movement, many short films are being produced and featured in festivals. \"Graceland\", a film by Anocha Suwichakornpong, about an Elvis impersonator, was featured in the Cinéfondation competition at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. It was the first Thai short film selected at Cannes. Short-film festivals in Thailand include the Thai Short Film and Video Festival by the Thai Film Foundation and the Fat Film Festival by Fat Radio. Thai short-film programs are also put together for the Bangkok International Film Festival and the World Film Festival of Bangkok. for the past two years CNXWOOD Studios has co-sponsor a Film Festival, in the northern city of Chiang Mai in conjunction with Creative Kingdom Animation Studios Film.\n\nPen-ek Ratanaruang's \"Twelve Twenty\" (30 min) was made as part of the Digital Short Films by Three Filmmakers project for the 2006 Jeonju International Film Festival. The film stars Ananda Everingham, has an appearance by American bilingual actor Erich Fleshman, and was shot by Christopher Doyle. The short film is shot in a minimalist style and slowly moves along the encounters of a man and a woman on a long-haul flight, where they spend the next 12 hours and 20 minutes reading, drinking, eating and watching movies and sleeping by each other's side without talking.\n\nIn 2007, Digital Forum by Thai Film Foundation, Festival for a digital long-film\n\nThe Thai Short Film and Video Festival was first held in 1997. The Bangkok Film Festival was started in 1998, and was eventually supplanted by the Bangkok International Film Festival, which started in 2002 and is organized by the Tourism Authority of Thailand. The World Film Festival of Bangkok, sponsored by the Nation Multimedia Group, began in 2003, and it is held annually in October.\n\nIn 2007, Digital Forum was begun in Bangkok as an outgrowth of the Thai Short Film and Video Festival, to showcase feature-length independent digital-video productions. Also in 2007, the inaugural Phuket Film Festival was held. In 2008, the annual Phangan Film Festival (PFF) was established on Koh Phangan, with a focus on spiritual and environmental indie films from around the world. In 2009, PFF's sister event, the annual Samui Film Festival (SFF) took place for the first time on Koh Samui.\n\nThe first film awards in Thailand were the \"Golden Doll\" awards given by \"Tukata Tong\" magazine. The awards were first given in 1957. The statuette at first was a Thai classical dancer and later it was modelled after Phra Suratsawadi, the Thai-Hindu god of art. King Bhumibol Adulyadej handed out the awards in 1965 and '66. The \"Tukata Tong\" awards were discontinued after eight years due to organizational problems, but were revived in 1974 by the Association of Entertainment News Journalists of Thailand.\n\nThe Thailand National Film Association Awards are organised by the National Federation of Motion Pictures and Contents Associations. The name of the award is the Subhanahongsa Award.\n\nThere is also the Bangkok Critics Assembly, which gives awards chosen by a panel of around 20 members, the Starpics Awards, given by \"Starpics\" magazine and the Kom Chad Luek Awards, given by \"Kom Chad Luek\" newspaper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis resume includes numerous prizes including three Rotterdam Tiger awards and Pusan New Current Award for Wonderful Town, Mundane History Eternity and 36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4637600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4637600", "title": "Dialect coach", "text": "Dialect coach\n\nA dialect coach is an acting coach who helps an actor design the voice and speech of a character in the context of an on-camera (film, television or commercial), stage (theatre, musical theatre, opera, etc.), radio or animation voiceover production. The dialect coach often does original research on dialects and speech patterns, prepares training materials, provides instruction and works on lines with the actor. A dialect coach will give the actor feedback focusing on issues of credibility, consistency, and clarity. A dialect coach may also be employed to help comedians hone impressions of celebrities, to train non-actor public speakers in vocal character and delivery, or to help singers improve in diction and attain a balance between tone and articulation, especially when singing in a second language.\n\nThe term \"dialect coach\" persists as the primary designation for an accent or language coach in the US and Canadian entertainment businesses. However, other designations may also be used. Some dialect coaches will refer to themselves as \"dialogue coaches\" (or, occasionally, by the historical designation, \"dialogue directors\"), especially when working on a second language or when offering acting coaching on straight dialogue in the performer's own language or dialect.\n\nIn the opera world, coaches who help opera singers with articulation of lyrics (often in an unfamiliar language, such as Russian, German or Czech) are called \"diction coaches.\" In the United Kingdom, dialect coaches are generally called \"accent coaches\" and are not acting coaches.\n\nThe term \"voice coach\" is applied to those who work with breathing, voice and text in the theatre in the UK, though this usage is not common in the US film and television businesses where the term \"voice coach\" would generally be understood to refer to a singing coach (a.k.a., a \"vocal coach\").\n\nLikewise, on US stage productions the term \"voice coach\" is also avoided to prevent confusion with either a vocal (singing) coach or someone who coaches actors in techniques for inducing a state of heightened relaxation prior to a rehearsal or performance, and who may offer guidance on breath support or vocal practices intended to promote effective placement of resonances in the upper body, the actor's availability of expression and appropriate projection.\n\nIn some cases, voice warm-up coaching integrates full-body work in yoga, movement or balance. Many actors believe that such warm-ups and exercises reduce the likelihood of vocal damage, most especially during expression of high intensity emotion outdoors or in a large performing venue in the absence of electronic amplification (e.g., microphones and a PA system). A dialect coach may also be engaged to coach voice issues in this latter sense in conjunction with theatrical dialect coaching. Not every dialect coach has the training and knowledge to also do vocal coaching in a singing sense.\n\nOn a film or television production, dialect coaches are typically hired by the line producer during pre-production to begin preparing cast far in advance of the first day of principal photography. If engaged during principal photography, it is the unit production manager, production manager, production supervisor, production coordinator or, in some cases, executive producer who is likely to interview prospective coaches in behalf of the production. If engaged only during post-production, the coach may even be hired directly by the post producer. In advance of being hired, coaches may be interviewed by the showrunner or a staff writer in the case of episodic television or by the film director in the case of a feature film. Dialect coaches may work with any members of the cast, but are brought in especially often to work with celebrity actors who have been cast in roles which require accents other than their own or even the performance of dialogue in languages unknown to the actors. Therefore, frequently, the actors themselves will ask Production to hire a particular coach. \n\nHowever the coach comes to be hired, the creatives will often consult with the dialect coach early in the process in order to acquaint the dialect coach with the overall creative vision and to start the actor as early as possible to allow time for the character's voice to become fully integrated by the actor prior to the actor's first shoot day. Once hired, the coach will typically prepare actors over a number of sessions either remotely, on set, at the Production Office or in the actor's own home. Coaches who work in serialized television are expected to be especially flexible as there may be no opportunity for a meeting between the episode director and coach, as shooting scripts may not be finalized until very close to the day of the shoot and as last-minute casting decisions and limitations on actor-availability may make it difficult to schedule advance coaching.\n\nDuring production, the key second assistant director typically schedules coaching sessions. Many creatives will ask that the coach be present at read-throughs or story conferences, at production meetings (if serving as key coach) and during at least some first-team rehearsals. While a shot is set-up, the coach will be kept in close proximity to the actors to be coached. Often, the coach will be assigned a dressing room, or, on location, a room in the honeywagon, double-banger or triple-banger near the actors' trailers. On set, the dialect coach will be issued a wireless headset and given a chair (exclusive, if on set regularly) in video village in order to facilitate access to the director and to the script supervisor who may be asked by the coach to relay notes on pronunciation and clarity, particularly if the dialogue is in dialect or language unfamiliar to the post-production team. An on-set coach may also work with an actor between takes if needed, especially on last minute changes to the script. Later, the coach may be brought back for dubbing or to pick up new lines during the post-production process, sometimes via a feed from a remote studio when the actors are no-longer available in person.\n\nOn a stage production, dialect coaches are typically brought in by a director or artistic director with contractual terms negotiated by a producer or general manager. Coaches work closely with the production stage manager who coordinates meetings with the director and coaching sessions for the cast collectively or individually. The coach will often also be present to give notes to the actors at some rehearsals, partial runs and full runs. Coaching typically takes place throughout the rehearsal process, but especially before the actors begin memorizing their lines and again after the show is loaded into the performance space. Understudies may be coached alongside the principal performers or after the show goes into previews. Coaching may continue in a limited way during a run.\n\nIn the film and television businesses, dialect coaches are very well paid. Coaches are customarily given on-screen credits for their work on films and for substantial contributions to serialized television. The wording of the credit may vary with the specific requirements of the production. On some shows, dialect coaches may be asked to contribute intellectual property to the production in the form of, for instance, dialogue polishing in English or other languages. They may serve as technical consultants in the areas of culture and written language. They often guide, or engage with, the cast's process of creating a character and consult on the overall vocal design for the production. Consequently, the deal memos for coaches may include compensation terms that are not typical for crew positions, leading to the adage that dialect coaches are neither above-the-line nor below-the-line, but on-the-line.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, the UK and the US, dialect coaches remain among a very small minority of production staff who are not unionized; their deals may differ in substance from production to production in these jurisdictions. In Australia and New Zealand, dialect coaches who are employed on a film or theatre set are covered under the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance. On English-language Canadian film and television productions, dialect coaches are unionized under the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists. Coaches are not unionized under the Union des artistes for French-language productions in Canada.\n\nIn the theater, coaches who help actors hone dialects or character voices typically seek compensation on a par with designers and may be credited as dialect coaches, dialect designers or voice and speech directors. Dialect coaches are not unionized for live performances in Canada, the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, the UK or the US. \n\nThere is no membership branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that incorporates dialect coaching, nor is there a peer group of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences that accords active membership status to coaches.\n\nDue to budget constraints, producers of student films and stage plays, showcase theater and slimly financed independent films and web series may avoid hiring a dialect coach, and instead substitute the services of a low-paid or volunteer native speaker model in hopes that the actors will be able to learn mimetically, retain the accent and act in it without expert guidance or monitoring. In some such cases, cast members may themselves pay a coach, sometimes in consultation with the director, though employing crew is not normally regarded as a cast member’s responsibility. In other cases, actors may attempt to self-study the dialect using commercially available training materials or web-based voice archives which host native-speaker recordings of oral histories or interviews or other scripted speech. The majority of such archives also provide native-speaker recordings of phonemically balanced narrative passages, especially \"Comma Gets a Cure,\" which is structured around the lexical sets of English and other phonological patterns of potential interest to the student of dialect.\n\nWhile there are many hundreds of voice and speech trainers connected with drama courses throughout the English-speaking world who may control a stock of \"stage dialects\" for general use, far fewer specialize in dialect coaching. A web search of dialect coaches with Internet Movie Database listings produces fewer than 100 living film and TV coaches worldwide, the majority showing few recent jobs, credited or uncredited. Most of these dialect coaches work on an ad hoc basis on individual productions. However, in some cases, a coach may become attached to a theatre company as a resident voice and speech director, especially if the coach has a second specialization (esp. Shakespeare or voice). As with many aspects of the entertainment business, entry into the field of dialect coaching is very competitive. Because dialect coaches are not always called for every day of a shoot, many coaches find a way to supplement income while maintaining their availability for coaching, often by acting, directing (including animation voice directing), teaching in related areas (public speaking, etc.) or taking on private students, especially for auditions. Outside of the entertainment businesses based in English-speaking countries, dialect coaching is less common, and opportunities rarer.\n\nDialect coaches, especially those who teach in theater education programs, may become active in such professional societies as the Australian Voice Association, the British Voice Association, the International Centre for Voice and the Voice and Speech Trainers Association.\n\n"}
{"id": "328284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=328284", "title": "Doctor Who: The Curse of Fatal Death", "text": "Doctor Who: The Curse of Fatal Death\n\nDoctor Who: The Curse of Fatal Death is a \"Doctor Who\" special made for the Red Nose Day charity telethon in the United Kingdom, and was originally broadcast in four parts on BBC One on 12 March 1999 under the title Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death. Later home video releases are formatted as two parts and drop the \"and\" in the title. It follows in a long tradition of popular British television programmes producing short, light-hearted specials for such telethon events.\n\nIt has a special status amongst \"Doctor Who\"-themed charity productions. It has twice been featured on the cover of \"Doctor Who Magazine\" – an unusual feat even for a regular episode of the programme. It is the only parodic story to be covered by \"DWM Archives\", a section of \"DWM\" normally reserved for discussion of past episodes of the regular series. Similarly, it is the only parody to be given an extensive behind-the-scenes article on the BBC official website, and its own video release through BBC Video. It is also the only BBC-commissioned live-action \"Doctor Who\" production between the \"Doctor Who\" television movie in 1996 and \"Rose\" in 2005.\n\nFinally, it serves as a production bridge – if not a narrative bridge – between the 1963 and 2005 versions of the programme. Most notable amongst the many connections between \"old\" and \"new\" versions is the fact that it showcases the first televised \"Doctor Who\" script by Steven Moffat, the first post-production work of The Mill on the programme, the only time a woman produced an episode of the programme between Verity Lambert and Susie Liggat, and the final performance by the longest-serving Dalek vocal artist, Roy Skelton. Executive Producer Richard Curtis would later write the 2010 episode \"Vincent and the Doctor\". Richard E. Grant, who plays the alternative Tenth Doctor would later appear on the actual show, as the main antagonist of the seventh series, the Great Intelligence, after performing the voice of another version of the Ninth Doctor in an animated webcast serial \"Scream of the Shalka\".\n\nThe story begins with the Master gloating over his latest scheme to destroy his nemesis. However, instead of only spying on the Doctor and his companion Emma, he is actually in communication with them, so they hear his plans. The Doctor invites his old foe to meet him at a castle on the planet Tersurus. The planet is in ruins, and was the home of a now-extinct race of supremely-enlightened beings shunned by all because they used flatulence as their means of communication. They all died when they discovered fire.\n\nThe Master appears, gloating that he travelled a century back in time, and persuaded the architect of the castle to put in a secret death trap. The Doctor had anticipated this and travelled further back, persuading the same architect to sabotage the trap. The Master had also anticipated this, and arranged for an additional trap – with identical results because the Doctor had likewise anticipated his move. The Doctor informs the Master, having calculated that he \"has saved every planet in the known universe a minimum of 27 times\", and having grown tired of battles with aliens and \"the endless gravel quarries\", that he is retiring, having found a Companion – Emma – with whom he has fallen in love. The Master springs yet another trap; a trap door under the Doctor's feet leading to the vast sewers of Tersurus, which he intends to suggest to the architect after going back in time again and buying him an expensive dinner. However, the Doctor had already bought the architect that dinner, so when the Master pulls the lever the trap door opens beneath him instead.\n\nSeconds later, as the Doctor and Emma start to leave, the Master bursts in. Having taken him 312 years to crawl out, he emerges as an old man covered in sewage. Using his TARDIS to return to the present, he has brought allies – the Daleks (who, lacking noses, are the only race that will have anything to do with him). Additionally, he has been enhanced by superior Dalek technology, a Dalek Suction Cup Hand. To the Master's dismay he can not answer when Emma asks him what the suction cup is for. The Master throws himself at the Doctor but falls into the sewers again, and immediately bursts in again, another 312 years older. The Daleks give chase to the Doctor, knocking the Master once more into the sewers. Having spent a total of 936 years in the sewers, he returns using a zimmer frame (walker) and is easily outpaced by the slow moving Daleks.\n\nEmma and the Doctor are captured when they run into a room full of Daleks. Rather than being exterminated immediately, they are tied to chairs aboard the Dalek ship. The Master claims he has been enhanced again with Dalek technology – rejuvenating him and adding \"Dalek bumps\" to his chest. The Doctor insults the Master, comparing the \"bumps\" to breasts. In return for his enhancements, the Master agreed to give the Daleks the Zektronic energy beam – a weapon that would \"allow the Daleks to conquer the universe in a matter of minutes\".\n\nWhen the Doctor tells the Daleks they will have to share the universe \"with the beard and the bosoms over there\", they inform the Doctor that they plan to exterminate the Master after he has assisted them. The Doctor uses the Tersuran language (farting) to warn his fellow Time Lord. The Master helps the Doctor and Emma escape, but not before the Doctor is fatally injured by the Daleks. He tells Emma (in Tersuran, which the Master translates) that he loves her, then dies. The Doctor regenerates into a handsome and sexually eager new Doctor (Richard E. Grant). Forced to fix the Dalek weapon, he is also electrocuted and becomes a shy, middle-aged and overweight Doctor (Jim Broadbent). Another accident results in a handsome, smooth-mannered Doctor (Hugh Grant), but this Doctor is also accidentally killed while fixing the weapon. Due to Zektronic energy beam's ability to disable the regenerative process, the Doctor permanently dies. The Master vows to live a life of heroism in honour of his fallen foe's memory, as do the Daleks.\n\nSeemingly through the will of the universe itself, the Doctor does regenerate yet again, only this time as a woman (Joanna Lumley). Emma is deeply disappointed, pointing out that \"You're just not the man I fell in love with.\" The Master, however, is quite smitten with this new Doctor, who notices the sonic screwdriver has \"\"three\" settings!\" The story ends with them walking off together.\n\nThis story is connected to a number of others by virtue of its narrative and its production elements. Many of the story's actors also have other connections to the programme, although most of these connections take the form of various actors \"almost\" getting a role in the main production.\n\n\n\nThe production was deliberately based on the Fourth Doctor's era and a conscious effort was made to use cues taken directly from episodes of that era. However, the practical unavailability of these soundtracks forced the show's musical director, Mark Ayres, to use material mostly from the Fifth Doctor's era. Except for the reuse of the theme music, the majority of musical cues come from episodes between \"Meglos\" and \"The Caves of Androzani\", with a brief excerpt also taken from the Third Doctor serial \"The Sea Devils\" as well as an excerpt from the Seventh Doctor serial \"The Greatest Show in the Galaxy\" (written by Ayres himself). The music during the episode's final scene, for example, is the same as that which played at the conclusion of the Fourth Doctor's regeneration into the Fifth in \"Logopolis\". After each regeneration portrayed in the episode, music from \"Meglos\" is employed.\n\n\n\nA week after the special aired, \"Doctor Who\" writer Lawrence Miles contacted BBC Books editor Stephen Cole with an idea for a novel sequel focusing on Joanna Lumley's Thirteenth Doctor; Cole had already received a different Thirteenth Doctor pitch from David A. McIntee that weekend. Titled \"The War\", Miles's novel would have taken place during the time war alluded to in Miles's \"Eighth Doctor Adventures\" novels. Miles planned to take advantage of the BBC's catalogue of characters, mostly those from 1970s and 1980s sitcoms: with the war causing alternative timelines to overlap, the Doctor would have found herself in a concentration camp on Earth along with strays from other realities, such as Norman Stanley Fletcher from \"Porridge\". In a pastiche of war story clichés, the heroes would have been betrayed by \"Mrs. Slocombe's pussy\", a running joke in \"Are You Being Served?\" which would have been revealed as a conceptual entity working for the Enemy, the Time Lords' unseen opponents. At the story's climax, the Doctor and Captain Mainwaring from \"Dad's Army\" would have led a suicidal \"Light Brigade\"-style assault on the Enemy's base. Cole never replied, which Miles has attributed to Cole mistaking the submission for a joke.\n\n"}

{"id": "772780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=772780", "title": "Football in India", "text": "Football in India\n\nFootball is a popular sport in India. Football has enjoyed popularity in Kerala, West Bengal, Goa and north-eastern India which consists of Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim.\n\nIndia's current top domestic league, I-League, was formed in 2007 in an attempt to professionalize domestic football and in 2013 the Indian Super League was formed with 8 teams to promote Indian football to the country and world. Also contested is Santosh Trophy, a knock-out competition between states (provinces) and government institutions. The current captain of the Indian national team is Sunil Chhetri and the team is coached by Stephen Constantine. India is currently ranked 96 among the FIFA World Rankings.\n\nThe 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup was hosted by India in the month of October in 2017 and the first time the country had hosted a FIFA event.The tournament was touted as the most successful FIFA U-17 World Cup ever, with the attendance being a record 1,347,133 surpassing China's 1985 edition where it was 1,230,976. Owing to this, India has also bid to host the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup and is considering a bid for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup\n\nThe origin of football in India can be traced back to mid-nineteenth century when the game was introduced by British soldiers. Initially, games were played between army teams. However, clubs were soon set up around the country. Calcutta FC was the first club to be established in 1872, though reports suggest that they were initially a rugby club and switched their attentions to football as late as 1894. Other early clubs include Dalhousie Club, Traders Club and Naval Volunteers Club. Several other football clubs like Sovabazar, Mohun Bagan and Aryan Club were established in Calcutta around the 1890s. Calcutta, then capital of British India, soon became the hub of Indian football. Tournaments like Gladstone Cup, Trades Cup and Cooch Behar Cup was also started around this time. The Durand Cup and IFA Shield were both started in late nineteenth century.\n\nThe first Indian team to achieve success was Sovabazar Club, which won the Trades Cup in 1892. Mohun Bagan Athletic Club was set up in what is now West Bengal in 1889. The club became famous in 1911 when it became the first Indian team to lift the IFA Shield, a tournament previously won only by British teams based in India. It defeated the East Yorkshire Regiment 2–1 in the final of the tournament in a victory that is still regarded by many as the greatest win by an Indian team before Independence.\n\nThe Indian Football Association (IFA) was established in Calcutta in 1893, but did not have a single Indian on its board until the 1930s. The All India Football Federation, which runs the game in India, was formed in 1937, but took more than a decade to get affiliated with FIFA. India also insisted on playing barefoot when other nations were putting their boots on and the game was changing fast.\n\nIndia qualified by default for the 1950 FIFA World Cup as a result of the withdrawal of all of their scheduled opponents. But lack of foreign exchange, the prospects of a long sea journey and an insistence on playing barefoot meant that the team never made it to Brazil. Although FIFA imposed a rule banning barefoot play following 1948 Olympics where India had played barefoot. The myth that Indians refused to play because they were not allowed to play barefoot is not entirely true, according to the then Indian captain Shailen Manna, it was just a story to cover up the disastrous decision of the AIFF. The team has never since come close to qualifying for the World Cup.\n\nIndia even picked up the gold in football in the first Asian Games in 1951, beating a \"booted\" Iran by a solitary goal. In 1956, after having put on its boots, India reached the semi-final in Melbourne Olympics football, the first Asian country to do so. It stood fourth in the tournament. In 1962, India again picked up the football gold in the Asian Games. 1951–1962 is usually considered as \"golden phase\" of Indian football. The National team won numerous titles in this era under the coaching of Syed Abdul Rahim. Other than success in Asian Games football, India also won Merdeka Cup and Quadrangular Tournament while East Bengal garnered rave reviews after its tour of Romania. Rahim's death in the early 1960s pegged Indian football back after a successful period. The foremer FIFA president Mr. Sepp Blatter believes India is 'the sleeping giant of World Football'.\n\nIndia never qualified for the Olympics after 1960. India did qualify for its first Asian Cup in 1964 but failed to capture the title. India's last important performance in an international tournament was in 1970 Asian Games, when it won the bronze medal by defeating Japan 1–0. In the mid-70s, Indian youth team jointly won the Youth Asian Cup with Iran. 24 September 1977, was a golden day for Indian Club football, when Mohun Bagan managed to hold on for a memorable 2–2 draw at the legendary Eden Gardens stadium in Calcutta, against a Pele led New York Cosmos. Mohun Bagan would have gone on and won the tie, had it not been for a controversial penalty awarded to the visitors that ensured the spoils were shared. The next day, the Ananda Bazar Patrika described Goutam Sarkar as \"India's very own Beckenbaur\". Indian football would however go through a barren phase in 70s, 80s and 90s, gradually losing its foothold as a top Asian team.\n\nIn August 2007, the Indian national team won the Nehru Cup for the first time in its history beating Syria 1–0. In August the following year, India defeated Tajikistan 4–1 to lift the AFC Challenge Cup and in turn qualified for the 2011 AFC Asian Cup in Qatar. In August 2009, India again won the Nehru Cup beating Syria in penalty (6–5).\n\nIn January 2011 India played in the 2011 Asian Cup which was the first time India has played in the Asian Cup for 24 years. India were knocked out in the group stage which contained South Korea, Australia, and Bahrain.\n\nEver since the 2011 Asian Cup the All India Football Federation has been working very hard on Indian Football. For instance they allowed former coach Bob Houghton coach the Indian side in the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers. After going first in there AFC Challenge Cup group Bob Houghton was sacked and replaced by Wim Koevermans. Meanwhile, the India national under-23 football team won the first round of the 2012 Olympics qualifiers against Myanmar but were knocked out by Qatar. India played their next official matches against United Arab Emirates in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers which India lost on aggregate 5–2.\n\nIn 2014, India hosted the first-ever Unity World Cup in Goa, Hyderabad and Bangalore.\n\nIndia has participated for the first time in FIFA U-17 World Cup as hosts in the 2017 edition of the tournament. This was the first time ever  that a team representing India participated in the finals of a FIFA-organised world tournament. India was placed in Group A along With, U.S.A, Ghana and Columbia. On 6 October 2017, India played their First Ever match in FIFA-U17 World Cup history in front of 47000 people against U.S.A.But unfortunately, India lost the match by 3–0. India played their Second match against Colombia. In 82nd minute Jeakson Singh Thounaojam became the First Indian Goal Scorer in any FIFA Tournament. For the third match of group stage, India faced Ghana where they went down to lose 4–0, finishing bottom of the group A.\n\nRecently in 2018, Indian football has reached another level, by defeating Argentina U20 2–1 in 2018 Cotif Cup and Iraq U16 the defending champions of AFC U-16 Championship by 1–0.\n\nThe game in India is administered by the All India Football Federation (AIFF), which is affiliated with the regional Asian Football Confederation, as well as with the worldwide body FIFA. The Indian national team has entered into the regional Asian Cup but has never competed in any World Cup. The Indian women's national team has also played in various competitions; moreover, women's football has its own separate inter-state and state competitions. Youth football is administered by the governmental Sports Authority of India.\n\nThe India national football team is the national football team of India and is governed by the All India Football Federation. It is a member of the Asian Football Confederation. Since 1948, the AIFF has been affiliated with FIFA, the international governing body for world football. In 1954, AIFF became one of the founder members of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).\n\nAt the peak of its success during the 1950s and 60s, the team was automatically advanced to play in the 1950 FIFA World Cup (all the other Asian teams withdrew), but ultimately they did not go to the tournament in Brazil due to the cost of travel, lack of practice time, team selection issues, the issue of the AIFF valuing Olympics over the World Cup, and, unusually, their instance on playing barefoot when FIFA required all players to wear football boots. They won gold medals at two Asian Games, and held the record for the best performance by an Asian football team at the Olympics.\n\nThere are also a number of other national teams from the Under-23 team to the Under-17 team, the under-23's is considered to be a feeder team for the national team.\n\nThe Indian Super League, a tournament just recently recognized by AFC or FIFA, was founded in 2013 in an effort to make football a top sport in India and to make Indian football a major player worldwide. The league operates along the lines of the Twenty20 cricket Indian Premier League, and Major League Soccer of the United States. Unlike the vast majority of football leagues around the world, the ISL does not use the promotion and relegation system. Instead, it uses an American style franchise system in which ten teams were specifically created to participate in the league. Each team in the ISL is composed of players from I league or state league, apart from the foreigners who may or may not be a part of the I league. Recently it was recognised as the second national league in India, which means ISL champions from 2017–2018 leagues will be eligible for an AFC Cup qualifying slot\n\nNational Football League, established in 1996 by governing body All India Football Federation (AIFF) was the first \"semi-professional\" football league in India. \nThe League was renamed and restructured and the I-League was founded in 2006 after India's former top league the National Football League disbanded in a successful effort aimed at increasing the game in India. Links with clubs that were not in the I-League were maintained, and each season the bottom two clubs are relegated from the I-League and replaced by two from the I-League 2nd Division. The I-League is contested between 14 clubs each season. The Kolkata Derby in the I League (and other tournaments) played between Mohun Bagan and East Bengal is one of the most fierce rivalries of the world (featured in FIFA website) and one of the oldest derbies in the world (90 years). An average 80, 000 to 100, 000 supporters throng the stadium in this special fixture.\n\nThe I-League 2nd Division ranks second in the hierarchy of Indian football since the disbanding of India's top league in 2005. The I-League 2nd Division has 21 member clubs evenly divided among three divisions. Promotion and relegation of clubs still takes place between the I-league and the I-League 2nd Division.\n\nRight now the official youth leagues in India are I-League U18, U15 Youth league and U13 Youth league. I league U18 started as U19 tournament in 2011. 2017–18 season U18 champions are Shillong Lajong. AIFF started U16 Youth League in 2015 (later renamed U15 Youth league) in the wake of 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup (hosted by India). Minerva Academy is the reigning three-time champions of U16 League.\n\nWinners of U18 Youth league\n\nWinners of U15 Youth League\nWinners OF U13 Youth League\n\nState league football is considered the best amateur leagues in India. Each state has their own league in India. There is no promotion/relegation between the state leagues and the I-League 2nd Division but there could be promotion/relegation between leagues within the state. For example, the Calcutta Football League has five divisions with promotion/relegation but the winner of the Calcutta Football League will not get promoted to the I-League 2nd Division. However, apart from the clubs already featuring in the I League, AIFF may select the next best achiever of the state league as an entrant to the I league 2nd Division.\n\nCalcutta Football League (CFL) is the football league system where several football clubs of the Indian city of Kolkata (Calcutta) participate. It currently consists of six-tier pyramid system. Indian Football Association (IFA) conducts the CFL with 157 mostly Kolkata based clubs and units. Started in 1898, this league is the oldest league in Asia and one of the oldest in the world. There are about 8500 directly registered players of IFA who participate in CFL.\n\nFederation Cup (abbreviated as Fed cup) is an annual knockout style club football tournament in India. It has started in 1977. From its inception till I-League has been started in 1997 (then called NFL), it was the most prestigious national level club football tournament in India. Presently it is the most important club tournament after I-league. Winning club of Federation cup gets a chance to compete in the continental level in AFC Cup along with I-league champion team.\n\nThe Durand Football Tournament was started by then, India's Foreign Secretary, Mortimer Durand at Simla, India, in 1888, initial matches were played in Dagshai. It was basically initiated, as a recreation for British troops stationed in India. The Durand Cup was twice suspended, during the two world wars. In 1940 the venue was shifted to New Delhi.\n\nThe Super Cup is a knockout football tournament. The top six teams from both the top tier leagues for professional football in India, the I-League and Indian Super League, qualify directly for the main round of the competition. The bottom four clubs from each league participate in qualification round to complete.\n\nThe IFA Shield is an annual football competition organized by the Indian Football Association, Calcutta. It is the fourth oldest club cup competition in the world (Started in 1893) after the English and Scottish FA cup's and the Durand Cup.\n\nSantosh Trophy is an annual Indian football tournament which is contested by states and government institutions. The first winners were Bengal, who also lead the all-time winners list with 31 titles till date.\n\nWomen's football has not had the relative head start over the rest of the world that the men's game has had, and also has not had the chance to spread through the country like its male counterpart. The game was administered by the Women's Football Federation of India (WFFI) from 1975 until the early 1990s when they were absorbed into the AIFF. However, there are complaints that women's football is treated as a poor relation to the men's game leading to (unfulfilled) plans to de-merge the WFFI.\n\nThe women's game, like the men's game, also has its early pioneers in the state of West Bengal. The large Kolkata teams, East Bengal and Mohun Bagan, started women's club sides in the 2000–01 season, and they participate with other teams in the Calcutta Women's Football League. However, it has been seen recently that players from Odisha and Manipur have made advances in the game. Players from these two states make up a large part of the India women's national football team.\n\nThe women's national competition is played on a state vs. state basis in the India women's football championship. There are also similar national championships for junior teams like the \"Junior Girls National Championship\" (for under 19s) and the \"Under-17 Girls National Championship\".\n\nSome female players have become internationally recognised. Among them are Chitra Gangadharan who was selected to play for the All Asian Star team. Jaanki Kotecha was selected as captain to the All Asian Star Team in 2008–2009, where she led her team to victory. In February 2000, Sujata Kar and Alpana Sil became the first Indian footballers to sign a contract outside India. They signed with the German team TSV Crailsheim, but had to return after a month due to problems with the clearance of their international transfer.\n\nUntil 1983, women's football took part in international tournaments like the AFC Women's Asian Cup. For example, the team won silver in 1980 at Calicut. In later years it had become poor in status just like its male counterpart. During the 2003 AFC Women's Championship, the Indian team were embarrassed by a 12–0 defeat to China.\n\nThe poor support of the national team by the AIFF became evident, when the team's trip to Germany was only made possible by Non Resident Indians in the country, and by the support of the German Football Association. Furthermore, championships are held in remote locations, and national media coverage is said to be restricted to state and local newspapers.\n\nThe women's game reached a new low in June 2009 when FIFA delisted the side from its world rankings for being out of action for more than 18 months. This comes at a time when the game was gaining in popularity amongst the younger generation as evident by the local leagues conducted around the country. The recently concluded Mumbai Women's Football League 2009–10 organised by the MDFA (Mumbai District Football Association) was a major success and featured many talented players who had played for the national team. Furthermore, the popularity of the event gave hope that the women's game could rise in India.\n\nOn 21 April 2016, over a year after the AIFF started plans for a women's football league, the AIFF President, Praful Patel, said that a women's football league would kick off in October 2016 with six teams to be decided, with the goal to expand to eight teams by 2017. Just over two months later, on 5 July 2016, the AIFF organized a workshop to discuss the India women's national team and discuss the proposed women's football league. Five Indian Super League sides (Delhi Dynamos, Chennaiyin FC, Kerala Blasters, FC Pune City, Atletico de Kolkata) and three I-League teams (Bengaluru FC, Aizawl FC, Mumbai FC) attended the workshop. It was announced that the league would feature the eight teams in the league and two other spots would be determined through a pre-qualification round.\n\nOn 14 October, the AIFF announced that the preliminary rounds for the Women's League would begin on 17 October 2016 in which ten teams are split into two groups of five teams each, with the winner from each group qualifying for the national finals.\n\nThere are many football stadiums in India, however only a few of them stadiums are currently of world standards. These are namely the largest stadium in India, the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata with a seating capacity of 85,000 , Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in New Delhi with a capacity of over 60,000 and the Ambedkar Stadium with a capacity of 20,000 (but is known to have had crowds of 35,000 in the 2009 Nehru Cup). Barabati Stadium in Cuttack, with seating capacity of over 45,000 and Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar, with seating capacity approximately 55,000 are two major arenas for football events in Odisha. In Sikkim, the Paljor Stadium in Gangtok which seats over 25,000 is famous as one of the most beautiful stadiums in the world as it is situated in the backdrop of Himalayas. In Shillong the main stadium is the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium with a capacity of 25,000 standing. Both the Paljor and the JLN in Shillong have been renovated and now have artificial playing surfaces. Some other stadiums important stadiums are the Shree Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex in Pune, the Barasat Stadium in Barasat, the Fatorda in Goa, the Kaloor International Stadium in Kochi, Municipal Corporation Stadium in Kozhikode, the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Guwahati. Apart from the above-mentioned stadiums, there are hundreds of more stadiums in the country.

{"id": "19394651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19394651", "title": "Homelessness", "text": "Homelessness\n\nHomelessness is the circumstance when people are without a permanent dwelling, such as a house or apartment. People who are homeless are most often unable to acquire and maintain regular, safe, secure and adequate housing due to a lack of, or a steady income. The legal definition of \"homeless\" varies from country to country, or among different jurisdictions in the same country or region. The term \"homeless\" may also include people whose primary night-time residence is in a homeless shelter, a domestic violence shelter, long-term residence in a motel, a vehicle, squatting, cardboard boxes, a tent city, tarpaulins, shanty town structures made of discarded building materials or other \"ad hoc\" housing situations. According to the UK homelessness charity Crisis, a home is not just a physical space: it also provides roots, identity, security, a sense of belonging and a place of emotional wellbeing. United States government homeless enumeration studies also include people who sleep in a public or private place not designed for use as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings. There are a number of organizations who provide help for the homeless.\n\nIn 2005, an estimated 100 million (1 in 65 at the time) people worldwide were homeless and as many as 1 billion people live as squatters, refugees or in temporary shelter, all lacking adequate housing. In Western countries, the majority of homeless are men (50–80%), with single males particularly overrepresented. However, current data suggests similar rates of homeless males and females. Also, in the United States more than 500,000 people are homeless each night.\n\nMost countries provide a variety of services to assist homeless people. These services often provide food, shelter (beds) and clothing and may be organized and run by community organizations (often with the help of volunteers) or by government departments or agencies. These programs may be supported by the government, charities, churches and individual donors. Many cities also have street newspapers, which are publications designed to provide employment opportunity to homeless people. While some homeless have jobs, some must seek other methods to make a living. Begging or panhandling is one option, but is becoming increasingly illegal in many cities. People who are homeless may have additional conditions, such as physical or mental health issues or substance addiction; these issues make resolving homelessness a challenging policy issue.\n\nHomeless people, and homeless organizations, are sometimes accused or convicted of fraudulent behaviour. Criminals are also known to exploit homeless people, ranging from identity theft to tax and welfare scams. These incidents often lead to negative connotations on the homeless as a group.\n\nIn 2004, the United Nations sector of Economic and Social Affairs defined a homeless household as those households without a shelter that would fall within the scope of living quarters due to a lack of or a steady income. They carry their few possessions with them, sleeping in the streets, in doorways or on piers, or in another space, on a more or less random basis.\n\nIn 2009, at the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Conference of European Statisticians (CES), held in Geneva, Switzerland, the Group of Experts on Population and Housing Censuses defined homelessness as:\nIn its Recommendations for the Censuses of Population and Housing, the CES identifies homeless people under two broad groups: (a) Primary homelessness (or rooflessness). This category includes persons living in the streets without a shelter that would fall within the scope of living quarters; (b) Secondary homelessness. This category may include persons with no place of usual residence who move frequently between various types of accommodations (including dwellings, shelters, and institutions for the homeless or other living quarters). This category includes persons living in private dwellings but reporting 'no usual address' on their census form. The CES acknowledges that the above approach does not provide a full definition of the 'homeless'.\nArticle 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted 10 December 1948 by the UN General Assembly, contains this text regarding housing and quality of living:\nEveryone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.\nHomelessness is perceived and addressed differently according to country. \"The European Typology of Homelessness and Housing Exclusion\" (ETHOS) was developed as a means of improving understanding and measurement of homelessness in Europe, and to provide a common \"language\" for transnational exchanges on homelessness. The ETHOS approach confirms that homelessness is a process (rather than a static phenomenon) that affects many vulnerable households at different points in their lives.\n\nThe typology was launched in 2005 and is used for different purposes: as a framework for debate, for data collection purposes, for policy purposes, monitoring purposes, and in the media. This typology is an open exercise which makes abstraction of existing legal definitions in the EU member states. It exists in 25 language versions, the translations being provided mainly by volunteer translators.\n\nThe terms \"unsheltered\" and \"unhoused\" refer to that segment of a homeless community who do not have ordinary lawful access to buildings in which to sleep; the latter term is defined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as describing persons occupying \"place not designed for ... sleeping accommodation for human beings\". Such persons frequently prefer the term \"houseless\" to the term \"homeless\". Recent homeless enumeration survey documentation utilizes the term \"unsheltered homeless\". The common colloquial term \"street people\" does not fully encompass all unsheltered people, in that many such persons do not spend their time in urban street environments. Many shun such locales, because homeless people in urban environments may face the risk of being robbed or beaten up. Some people convert unoccupied or abandoned buildings (\"squatting\"), or inhabit mountainous areas or, more often, lowland meadows, creek banks and beaches. Many jurisdictions have developed programs to provide short-term emergency shelter during particularly cold spells, often in churches or other institutional properties. These are referred to as warming centers, and are credited by their advocates as lifesaving.\n\nHUD requires jurisdictions which participate in Continuum of Care grant programs to count their homeless every two years. These counts have led to a variety of creative measures to avoid undercounting. Thus teams of counters, often numbering in the hundreds in logistically complex volunteer efforts, seek out the unsheltered in various nooks and crannies. These counts include people sleeping in official shelters and people sleeping in parks, alleys and other outdoor locations.\n\nA portion of the homeless population are generally in transit, but there is no generally accepted terminology to describe them; some nomenclature is frequently associated with derogatory connotations, and thus the professional and vernacular lingo to describe these persons is both evolving and not lacking in controversy. Much of the concern stems from the European situation, where homeless persons of Roma, Sinti and other ethnic descent have rejected the term \"gypsy\", which they view as a racial slur. Other terms which some use regarding in-transit persons are: transient, vagabond, tramp or drifter. Occasionally, these terms are interchanged with terms not necessarily implying that the person is a traveler, e.g. \"hobo\". The pejorative term \"bum\" is used for persons who are alleged to be lacking a work ethic. The term \"transient\" is frequently used in police reports, without any precise definitions across jurisdictions.\n\nFollowing the Peasants' Revolt, English constables were authorised under 1383 English Poor Laws statute to collar vagabonds and force them to show support; if they could not, the penalty was gaol. Vagabonds could be sentenced to the stocks for three days and nights; in 1530, whipping was added. The presumption was that vagabonds were unlicensed beggars. In 1547, a bill was passed that subjected vagrants to some of the more extreme provisions of the criminal law, namely two years servitude and branding with a \"V\" as the penalty for the first offense and death for the second. Large numbers of vagabonds were among the convicts transported to the American colonies in the 18th century. During the 16th century in England, the state first tried to give housing to vagrants instead of punishing them, by introducing bridewells to take vagrants and train them for a profession. In the 17th and 18th centuries, these were replaced by workhouses but these were intended to discourage too much reliance on state help.\n\nThe growing movement toward social concern sparked the development of rescue missions, such as the U.S. first rescue mission, the New York City Rescue Mission, founded in 1872 by Jerry and Maria McAuley. In smaller towns, there were hobos, who temporarily lived near train tracks and hopped onto trains to various destinations. Especially following the American Civil War, a large number of homeless men formed part of a counterculture known as \"hobohemia\" all over the United States. This phenomenon re-surged in the 1930s during and after the Great Depression.\n\n\"How the Other Half Lives\" and Jack London's \"The People of the Abyss\" (1903) discussed homelessness, and raised public awareness, which caused some changes in building codes and some social conditions. In England, dormitory housing called \"spikes\" was provided by local boroughs. By the 1930s in England, there were 30,000 people living in these facilities. In 1933, George Orwell wrote about poverty in London and Paris, in his book \"Down and Out in Paris and London\". In general, in most countries, many towns and cities had an area which contained the poor, transients, and afflicted, such as a \"skid row\". In New York City, for example, there was an area known as \"the Bowery\", traditionally, where alcoholics were to be found sleeping on the streets, bottle in hand.\n\nThe Great Depression of the 1930s caused a devastating epidemic of poverty, hunger, and homelessness. There were two million homeless people migrating across the United States. Many lived in shantytowns they called \"Hoovervilles\". In the 1960s, the nature and growing problem of homelessness changed in England as public concern grew. The number of people living \"rough\" in the streets had increased dramatically. However, beginning with the Conservative administration's Rough Sleeper Initiative, the number of people sleeping rough in London fell dramatically. This initiative was supported further by the incoming Labour administration from 2009 onwards with the publication of the 'Coming in from the Cold' strategy published by the Rough Sleepers Unit, which proposed and delivered a massive increase in the number of hostel bed spaces in the capital and an increase in funding for street outreach teams, who work with rough sleepers to enable them to access services.\n\nModern homelessness started as a result of economic stresses in society and reductions in the availability of affordable housing such as single room occupancies (SROs) for poorer people. In the United States, in the 1970s, the deinstitutionalisation of patients from state psychiatric hospitals was a precipitating factor that seeded the homeless population, especially in large cities like New York City. This theory is vigorously disputed by clinical psychologist Seth Farber who points out that \"the emptying of the state mental hospitals took place almost entirely in the 1960s and 1970s,\" a decade or more before the steep rise in homelessness which began in the late 1980s. Some feel that Ronald Reagan's signing (as governor of California in 1967) of the Lanterman–Petris–Short Act greatly exacerbated homelessness among the mentally ill. This law lowered the standards for involuntary commitment in civil courtrooms and was followed by significant de-funding of 1700 hospitals caring for mental patients [unclear why \"lowering\" standards would cause less committals].\n\nThe Community Mental Health Act of 1963 was a predisposing factor in setting the stage for homelessness in the United States. Long-term psychiatric patients were released from state hospitals into SROs and supposed to be sent to community mental health centers for treatment and follow-up, but it never quite worked out properly. The community mental health centers mostly did not materialize, and this population largely was found living in the streets soon thereafter with no sustainable support system.\n\nAlso, as real estate prices and neighborhood pressure increased to move these people out of their areas, the SROs diminished in number, putting most of their residents in the streets. Other populations were mixed in later, such as people losing their homes for economic reasons, those with addictions, the elderly, and others. Trends in homelessness are closely tied to neighborhood conditions, according to a report by the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation in 1990.\n\nIn 2002, research showed that children and families were the largest growing segment of the homeless population in the United States, and this has presented new challenges, especially in services, to agencies. Some trends involving the plight of homeless people have provoked some thought, reflection and debate. One such phenomenon is paid physical advertising, colloquially known as \"sandwich board men\".\n\nAnother trend is the side-effect of unpaid free advertising of companies and organizations on shirts, clothing, and bags, to be worn by homeless and poor people, given out and donated by companies to homeless shelters and charitable organizations for otherwise altruistic purposes. These trends are reminiscent of the \"sandwich board signs\" carried by poor people in the time of Charles Dickens in the Victorian 19th century in England and later during the Great Depression in the United States in the 1930s.\n\nIn the US, the government asked many major cities to come up with a ten-year plan to end homelessness. One of the results of this was a \"Housing first\" solution; rather than to have a homeless person remain in an emergency homeless shelter it was thought to be better to quickly get the person permanent housing of some sort and the necessary support services to sustain a new home. But there are many complications of this kind of program which must be dealt with to make such an initiative work successfully in the middle to long term. Some formerly homeless people, who were finally able to obtain housing and other assets which helped to return to a normal lifestyle, have donated money and volunteer services to the organizations that provided aid to them during their homelessness. Alternatively, some social service entities that help homeless people now employ formerly homeless individuals to assist in the care process.\n\nHomelessness has migrated toward rural and suburban areas. The number of homeless people has not changed dramatically but the number of homeless families has increased according to a report of HUD. The United States Congress appropriated $25 million in the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Grants for 2008 to show the effectiveness of Rapid Re-housing programs in reducing family homelessness. In February 2009, President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, part of which addressed homelessness prevention, allocating $1.5 billion for a Homeless Prevention Fund. The Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG) program's name was changed to Emergency Solution Grant (ESG) program, and funds were re-allocated to assist with homeless prevention and rapid re-housing for families and individuals.\n\nOn 20 May 2009, President Obama signed the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act into Public Law (Public Law 111-22 or \"PL 111-22\"), reauthorizing HUD's Homeless Assistance programs. It was part of the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009. The HEARTH act allowed for the prevention of homelessness, rapid re-housing, consolidation of housing programs, and new homeless categories. In the eighteen months after the bill's signing, HUD was to make regulations implementing this new McKinney program.\n\nThe HEARTH Act also codified in law the Continuum of Care planning process, long a part of HUD's application process to assist homeless persons by providing greater coordination in responding to their needs. This final rule integrated the regulation of the definition of \"homeless\" and the corresponding record-keeping requirements, for the Shelter Plus Care program and the Supportive Housing Program. This final rule also established the regulation for the definition \"developmental disability\" and the definition and record-keeping requirements for \"homeless individual with a disability\" for the Shelter Plus Care program and the Supportive Housing Program.\n\nIn late 2009, some homeless advocacy organizations, such as the National Coalition for the Homeless, reported and published perceived problems with the HEARTH Act of 2009 as a HUD McKinney-Vento Reauthorization bill, especially with regard to privacy, definitional ineligibility, community roles, and restrictions on eligible activities.\n\nMajor reasons and causes for homelessness as documented by many reports and studies include:\n\n\n\nA substantial percentage of the US homeless population are individuals who are chronically unemployed or have difficulty managing their lives effectively due to prolonged and severe drug and/or alcohol abuse. Substance abuse can cause homelessness from behavioral patterns associated with addiction that alienate an addicted individual's family and friends who could otherwise provide support during difficult economic times. Increased wealth disparity and income inequality causes distortions in the housing market that push rent burdens higher, making housing unaffordable. Dr. Paul Koegel of RAND Corporation, a seminal researcher in first-generation homelessness studies and beyond, divided the causes of homelessness into structural aspects and then individual vulnerabilities.\n\nThe basic problem of homelessness is the need for personal shelter, warmth, and safety. Other difficulties include:\n\n\nHomeless people face many problems beyond the lack of a safe and suitable home. They are often faced with reduced access to private and public services and vital necessities:\n\n\nThere is sometimes corruption and theft by the employees of a shelter, as evidenced by a 2011 investigative report by FOX 25 TV in Boston wherein a number of Boston public shelter employees were found stealing large amounts of food over a period of time from the shelter's kitchen for their private use and catering. The homeless are often obliged to adopt various strategies of self-presentation in order to maintain a sense of dignity, which constrains their interaction with passers-by and leads to suspicion and stigmatization by the mainstream public.\n\nHomelessness is also a risk factor for depression caused by prejudice (i.e. \"deprejudice\"). When someone is prejudiced against people who are homeless and then becomes homeless themselves, their anti-homelessness prejudice turns inward, causing depression. \"Mental disorders, physical disability, homelessness, and having a sexually transmitted infection are all stigmatized statuses someone can gain despite having negative stereotypes about those groups.\" Difficulties can compound exponentially. For example, a homeless man in New Jersey found that he could not get food from some volunteer organizations if he did not have a legally-recognized address; after being mugged, he lost valuable identification documents and contact information so he could not contact his daughter; since his hips and knee had been broken because of the attack, it was harder for him after recovering in the hospital to walk to those places which did offer free food; in numerous instances, problems seemed to exacerbate other problems in a downward cycle. A study found that in the city of Hong Kong over half of the homeless population in the city (56%) suffered from some degree of mental illness. Only 13% of the 56% were receiving treatment for their condition leaving a huge portion of homeless untreated for their mental illness.\n\nThe homeless are often the victims of violent crime. A 2007 study found that the rate of violent crimes against the homeless in the United States is increasing. In the United States in 2013 there were 109 reported attacks on homeless people, an increase of 24 per cent on the previous year, according to the National Coalition for the Homeless. Eighteen of those attacked died as a result. In July 2014 three boys 15, 16 and 18, were arrested and charged with beating to death two homeless men with bricks and a metal pole in Albuquerque. The 18-year-old was subsequently found guilty of second-degree murder and other felony charges and sentenced to 67 years in prison, the 16-year old was sentenced to 26 years in prison. A study of women veterans found that homelessness is associated with domestic violence, both directly as the result of leaving an abusive partner, and indirectly due to trauma, mental health conditions, and substance abuse.\n\nRent-controlled apartments contribute to shelter and street populations (around .04%). Apartments that are rent-controlled encourage people to not move out or to pass apartments along between families; this leads to higher rents for new renters, and reduces availability and affordability. About 10% of housing in the United States is under price control laws. Most of the laws were enacted to deal with the high inflation rates experienced during the 1970s and 80s. These laws can motivate apartment owners to convert their property to a more profitable enterprise, thereby reducing the amount of housing available to potential tenants. A black market can also develop, with tenants leasing rent-controlled premises at prices above the legal maximum. This can price out lower income individuals and families.\n\nPrior to 1983, the term 'homeless' implied that economic conditions caused homelessness. However, after 1983, conditions such as alcoholism and mental illness also became associated with the term in the media. Claims were often backed up with testimony made by high-ranking officials. For example, Ronald Reagan stated that \"one problem that we’ve had, even in the best of times, is the people who are sleeping on the grates, those who are homeless by choice.\". This claim made homelessness into a personal choice and a state of mind, and unhinged it from the neoliberal reforms sweeping through the economic system. In the broader sense, it made homelessness something that would exist even under the best economic conditions, and therefore independent of economic policies and economic conditions.\n\nDue to the stigma attached to the term, consequences have arisen. Fear is a major consequence. Many people fear the homeless due to the stigma surrounding the homeless community. Surveys have revealed that before spending time with the homeless, most people fear them, but after spending time with the homeless, that fear is lessened or is no longer there. Another effect of this stereotype is isolation. Homeless people often experience isolation. This gives the homeless community no say in how things are. No one really listens to them.\n\nMost countries provide a variety of services to assist homeless people. Provisions of food, shelter and clothing and may be organized and run by community organizations, often with the help of volunteers, or by government departments. Assistance programs may be supported by government, charities, churches and individual donors. In 1998, a study by Koegel and Schoeni of a homeless population in Los Angeles, California, reported that a significant number of homeless do not participate in government assistance programs, and the authors reported being puzzled as to why that was, with the only possible suggestion from the evidence being that transaction costs were perhaps too high. \n\nThe United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and Veterans Administration have a special Section 8 housing voucher program called VASH (Veterans Administration Supported Housing), or HUD-VASH, which gives out a certain number of Section 8 subsidized housing vouchers to eligible homeless and otherwise vulnerable US armed forces veterans. The HUD-VASH program has shown success in housing many homeless veterans.\n\nNon-governmental organizations also house and/or redirect homeless veterans to care facilities. Social Security Income/Social Security Disability Income, Access, Outreach, Recovery Program (SOAR) is a national project funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. It is designed to increase access to SSI/SSDI for eligible adults who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless and have a mental illness and/or a co-occurring substance use disorder. Using a three-pronged approach of Strategic Planning, Training, and Technical Assistance (TA), the SOAR TA Center coordinates this effort at the state and community level.\n\nWhile some homeless people are known to have a community with one another, providing each other various types of support, people who are not homeless also may provide them friendship, food, relational care, and other forms of assistance. Such social supports may occur through a formal process, such as under the auspices of a non-governmental organization, religious organization, or homeless ministry, or may be done on an individual basis. In Los Angeles, a collaboration between the Ostrow School of Dentistry of the University of Southern California and the Union Rescue Mission shelter offer homeless people in the Skid Row area free dental services.\n\nMany non-profit organizations such as Goodwill Industries \"provide skill development and work opportunities to people with barriers to employment\", though most of these organizations are not primarily geared toward homeless individuals. Many cities also have street newspapers or magazines: publications designed to provide employment opportunity to homeless people or others in need by street sale. While some homeless have paying jobs, some must seek other methods to make money. Begging or panhandling is one option, but is becoming increasingly illegal in many cities. Despite the stereotype, not all homeless people panhandle, and not all panhandlers are homeless. Another option is busking: performing tricks, playing music, drawing on the sidewalk, or offering some other form of entertainment in exchange for donations. In cities where plasmapheresis (blood donation) centers still exist, homeless people may generate income through visits to these centers.\n\nHomeless people can also provide waste management services to earn money. Some homeless people find returnable bottles and cans and bring them to recycling centres to earn money. For example, they can sort out organic trash from other trash, and/or separate out trash made of the same material (for example, different types of plastics, and different types of metal). Especially in Brazil, many people are already engaged in such activities. In addition, rather than sorting waste at landfills, ... they can also collect litter found on/beside the road to earn an income. Homeless people have been known to commit crimes just to be sent to jail or prison for food and shelter.\n\nInvented in 2005, in Seattle, Bumvertising, an informal system of hiring homeless people to advertise, has provided food, money, and bottles of water to sign-holding homeless in the Northwest. Homeless advocates have accused its founder, Ben Rogovy, and the process, of exploiting the poor and take particular offense to the use of the word \"bum\" which is generally considered pejorative. In October 2009, \"The Boston Globe\" carried a story on so-called cyberbegging, or Internet begging, which was reported to be a new trend worldwide.\n\nThe United States Department of Labor has sought to address one of the main causes of homelessness, a lack of meaningful and sustainable employment, through targeted training programs and increased access to employment opportunities that can help homeless people develop sustainable lifestyles. This has included the development of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, which addresses homelessness on the federal level in addition to connecting homeless individuals to resources at the state level. All individuals who are in need of assistance are able, in theory, to access employment and training services under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA), although this is contingent upon funding and program support by the government, with veterans also being able to use the Veterans Workforce Investment Program.\n\nUnder the Department of Labor, the Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS) offers a variety of programs targeted at ending homelessness among veterans. The Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Program (HVRP) is the only national program that is exclusively focused on assisting veterans as they reenter the workforce. The VETS program also has an Incarcerated Veterans' Transition Program, as well as services that are unique to female Veterans. Mainstream programs initiated by the Department of Labor have included the Workforce Investment Act, One-Stop Career Centers, and a Community Voice Mail system that helps to connect homeless individuals around the United States with local resources. Targeted labor programs have included the Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Project, the Disability Program Navigator Initiative, efforts to end chronic homelessness through providing employment and housing projects, Job Corps, and the Veterans Workforce Investment Program (VWIP).\n\nStreet newspapers are a tool for allowing homeless individuals to work. In New York City in 1989, a street newspaper was created called \"Street News\" which put some homeless to work assisting with writing, producing, and mostly selling the paper on streets and trains. Street News was written \"pro bono\" by a combination of homeless, celebrities, and established writers. In 1991, in England, a street newspaper following the New York model was established, called \"The Big Issue\" which is published weekly. Its circulation has grown to 300,000.\n\nChicago has \"StreetWise\" which has the second largest circulation of its kind in the United States, 30,000. Boston has a \"Spare Change News\" newspaper, founded in 1992 by a small group of homeless people in Boston, built on the same model as the others: homeless helping themselves. San Francisco has the twice-monthly \"Street Sheet\" newspaper, founded in 1989, with a distribution of 32,000 per month. In central and southern Florida, The Homeless Voice works to spread awareness of homelessness and provide aid to victims through its street paper. The publication is the oldest continuously published street newspaper, operates advertising-free, contains poverty-related news stories, artwork, and poetry, and is provided to street vendors free of charge.\n\nSeattle has \"Real Change\", a $1 newsletter that aims to directly benefit homeless people and also report on economic issues in the area. Portland, Oregon, has \"Street Roots\" with articles and poetry by homeless writers, sold on the street for a dollar. \"Street Sense\" in Washington, D.C., has gained popularity and helped many make the move out of homelessness. Students in Baltimore, Maryland, have opened a satellite office for that paper as well.\n\"The Challenger\" Street Newspaper is written and run by people experiencing homelessness and their allies in Austin, Texas – one of the most economically segregated cities in America. Sacramento, California, has \"Homeward Street Journal\", published bimonthly with a circulation of about 11,000 per issue.\n\nMany housing initiatives involve homeless people in the process of building and maintaining affordable shared housing. This process works as a double impact by not only providing housing but also giving homeless people employment income and work experience. One example of this type of initiative is the nonprofit organization Living Solutions, located in downtown San Diego, CA. This community initiative provides the homeless population with a source of housing as well as giving them jobs building affordable homes. The initiative builds community empowerment by asking formerly homeless residents to help to maintain and repair the homes. Residents are responsible for all household duties, including menu planning, budgeting, shopping, cooking, cleaning, yard work, and home maintenance. The environment of responsibility over a living space fosters a sense of ownership as well as involvement in all parts of the decision-making process.\nHomeless shelters can become grounds for community organization and the recruitment of homeless individuals into social movements for their own cause. Cooperation between the shelter and an elected representative from the homeless community at each shelter can serve as the backbone of this type of initiative. The representative presents and forwards problems, raises concerns and provides new ideas to the director and staff of the shelters. Examples of possible problems are ways to deal with drug and alcohol use by certain shelter users, and resolution of interpersonal conflicts. SAND, the Danish National Organization for Homeless People, is one example of an organization that uses this empowerment approach. Issues reported at the homeless shelters are then addressed by SAND at the regional or national level. To open further dialogue, SAND organizes regional discussion forums where staff and leaders from the shelters, homeless representatives, and local authorities meet to discuss issues and good practices at the shelters.\n\nVoting for elected officials is important for the homeless population to have a voice in the democratic process. Equal access to the right to vote is a crucial part of maintaining a democracy. Voting enables homeless people to play a part in deciding the direction of their communities on local, regional and national issues that are important and relevant to their lives. Unfortunately, in some jurisdictions it may be hard for homeless people to vote if they do not have identification, a fixed address, or a place to receive mail. With each election, low income and homeless individuals vote at a lower rate than those with higher incomes, despite the fact that many policy decisions directly impact people who are economically disadvantaged. Currently, issues such as raising the minimum wage and funding certain social welfare and housing programs are being debated in the U.S. Congress and in communities around the country. In order for the government to represent the people, citizens must vote — especially those who are economically disadvantaged.\n\nA model of how to overcome obstacles and encourage greater voter participation among low-income and homeless citizens was provided by the National Coalition for the Homeless and other national advocacy and grassroots social movement groups. These groups collaborated to create a manual that promotes voting access for low income and homeless persons, to ensure that those who are economically disadvantaged maintain an active role in shaping their futures. The manual is designed to cultivate ideas to help overcome the many obstacles that prevent people experiencing homelessness from becoming registered, active voters. By working together with homeless persons, low-income individuals, and advocates around the country, grassroots social movement organizations can help ensure their voices heard on Election Day.\n\nIn 1979 a New York City lawyer, Robert Hayes, brought a class-action suit, \"Callahan v. Carey\", against the City and State, arguing for a person's constitutional \"right to shelter\". It was settled as a consent decree in August 1981. The City and State agreed to provide board and shelter to all homeless men who met the need standard for welfare or who were homeless by certain other standards. By 1983 this right was extended to homeless women.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, there was a dramatic increase in family homelessness. Tied into this was an increasing number of impoverished and runaway children, teenagers, and young adults, which created a new substratum of the homeless population (street children or street youth). Also in the 1980s, in the United States, some federal legislation was introduced on homelessness as a result of the work of Congressman Stewart B. McKinney. In 1987, the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act was enacted.\n\nThere are many community organizations and social movements around the world which are taking action to reduce homelessness. They have sought to counteract the causes and reduce the consequences by starting initiatives that help homeless people transition to self-sufficiency. Social movements and initiatives tend to follow a grassroots, community-based model of organization – generally characterized by a loose, informal and decentralized structure, with an emphasis on radical protest politics. By contrast, an interest group aims to influence government policies by relying on more of a formal organization structure. These groups share a common element: they are both made up of and run by a mix of allies of the homeless population and former or current members of the homeless population. Both grassroots groups and interest groups aim to break stereotyped images of the homeless as being weak and hapless, or defiant criminals and drug addicts, and to ensure that the voice of homeless people and their representatives is clearly heard by policymakers.\n\nHomeless shelters are most often night shelters, where people leave in the morning to do whatever they can manage and return in the evening when the beds in the shelter open up again for sleeping. An example of a homeless shelter is Pine Street Inn in Boston's South End neighborhood. There are some daytime shelters where people might go instead of being stranded on the street, and to receive meals, counseling, avail themselves of resources, and otherwise spend their day until returning to their overnight sleeping arrangements. An example of such a day center shelter model is Saint Francis House in Boston, founded in the early 1980s, which is open to the homeless all year long during daytime hours and was originally based on the settlement house model.\n\nMany homeless people keep all their possessions with them because they have no access to storage. There have been \"bag\" people, shopping cart people, and soda can collectors (known as binners or dumpster divers) who sort through garbage to find items to sell, trade, or eat. Such people have typically carried all their possessions with them all the time. If they had no access to or ability to get to a shelter and possible bathing, or access to toilets and laundry facilities, their hygiene was lacking. This has created social tensions in public places.\n\nThese conditions have created an upsurge in tuberculosis and other diseases in urban areas. In 1974, Kip Tiernan founded Rosie's Place in Boston, the first drop-in and emergency shelter for women in the United States, in response to the increasing numbers of needy women throughout the country.\n\nThere are various places where a homeless person might seek refuge:\n\nThe inhabitants of such refuges are called in some places, like New York City, \"Mole People\". Natural caves beneath urban centers allow for places where people can congregate. Leaking water pipes, electric wires, and steam pipes allow for some of the essentials of living.\n\nTransitional housing\nTransitional housing provides temporary housing for the certain segments of the homeless population, including the working homeless, and is meant to transition residents into permanent, affordable housing. This is usually a room or apartment in a residence with support services. The transitional time can be relatively short, for example, one or two years, and in that time the person must file for and obtain permanent housing along with gainful employment or income, even if Social Security or assistance. Sometimes transitional housing programs charge a room and board fee, maybe 30% of an individual's income, which is sometimes partially or fully refunded after the person procures a permanent residence. In the U.S., federal funding for transitional housing programs was originally allocated in the McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1986.\n\nSupportive housing\nSupportive housing is a combination of housing and services intended as a cost-effective way to help people live more stable, productive lives. Supportive housing works well for those who face the most complex challenges — individuals and families confronted with homelessness who also have very low incomes and/or serious, persistent issues such as substance abuse, addictions, alcoholism, mental illness, HIV/AIDS, or other serious challenges.\n\nPedestrian villages\nIn 2007, urban designer and social theorist Michael E. Arth proposed a controversial national solution for homelessness involving the building of nearly car-free \"Pedestrian Villages\" in place of what he terms \"the current band-aid approach to the problem.\" A prototype, Tiger Bay Village, was proposed for near Daytona Beach, FL. He claimed this would be superior for treating the psychological and psychiatric needs of both temporarily and permanently homeless adults, and would cost less. It would provide a lower cost alternative to jail, and provide a half-way station for those getting out of prison. Work opportunities, including construction and maintenance of the villages, as well as the creation of workforce agencies would help make the villages financially and socially viable.\n\nGovernment initiatives\nIn South Australia, the state government of Premier Mike Rann (2002-2011) committed substantial funding to a series of initiatives designed to combat homelessness. Advised by Social Inclusion Commissioner David Cappo and the founder of New York's Common Ground program, Rosanne Haggerty, the Rann government established Common Ground Adelaide , building high-quality inner city apartments (combined with intensive support) for \"rough sleeping\" homeless people. The government also funded the Street to Home program and a hospital liaison service designed to assist homeless people admitted to the emergency departments of Adelaide's major public hospitals. Rather than being released back into homelessness, patients identified as rough sleepers were found accommodation backed by professional support. Common Ground and Street to Home now operate across Australia in other States.\n\nIn 2013, a Central Florida Commission on Homelessness study indicated that the region spends $31,000 a year per homeless person to cover \"salaries of law enforcement officers to arrest and transport homeless individuals — largely for nonviolent offenses such as trespassing, public intoxication or sleeping in parks — as well as the cost of jail stays, emergency room visits and hospitalization for medical and psychiatric issues. This did not include \"money spent by nonprofit agencies to feed, clothe and sometimes shelter these individuals\". In contrast, the report estimated the cost of permanent supportive housing at \"$10,051 per person per year\" and concluded that \"[h]ousing even half of the region's chronically homeless population would save taxpayers $149 million over the next decade — even allowing for 10 percent to end up back on the streets again.\" This particular study followed 107 long-term-homeless residents living in Orange, Osceola or Seminole Counties. There are similar studies showing large financial savings in Charlotte and Southeastern Colorado from focusing on simply housing the homeless.\"\n\nHealth care for homeless people is a major public health challenge. Homeless people are more likely to suffer injuries and medical problems from their lifestyle on the street, which includes poor nutrition, exposure to the severe elements of weather, and a higher exposure to violence (robberies, beatings, and the like). Yet at the same time, they have reduced access to public medical services or clinics, in part because they often lack identification or registration for public healthcare services. There are significant challenges in treating homeless people who have psychiatric disorders because clinical appointments may not be kept, their continuing whereabouts are unknown, their medicines may not be taken as prescribed, medical and psychiatric histories are not accurate, and other reasons. Because many homeless people have mental illnesses, this has presented a crisis in care.\n\nHomeless people may find it difficult to document their date of birth or their address. Because homeless people usually have no place to store possessions, they often lose their belongings, including identification and other documents, or find them destroyed by police or others. Without a photo ID, homeless persons cannot get a job or access many social services, including healthcare. They can be denied access to even the most basic assistance: clothing closets, food pantries, certain public benefits, and in some cases, emergency shelters. Obtaining replacement identification is difficult. Without an address, birth certificates cannot be mailed. Fees may be cost-prohibitive for impoverished persons. And some states will not issue birth certificates unless the person has photo identification, creating a Catch-22. This problem is far less acute in countries which provide free-at-use health care, such as the UK, where hospitals are open-access day and night and make no charges for treatment. In the U.S., free-care clinics for homeless and other people, do exist in major cities, but often attract more demand than they can meet.\n\nThe conditions affecting homeless people are somewhat specialized and have opened a new area of medicine tailored to this population. Skin conditions, including scabies, are common because homeless people are exposed to extreme cold in the winter and have little access to bathing facilities. They have problems caring for their feet and have more severe dental problems than the general population. Diabetes, especially untreated, is widespread in the homeless population. Specialized medical textbooks have been written to address this for providers.\n\nThere are many organizations providing free care to homeless people in countries which do not offer free state-run medical treatment, but the services are in great demand given the limited number of medical practitioners. For example, it might take months to get a minimal dental appointment in a free-care clinic. Communicable diseases are of great concern, especially tuberculosis, which spreads more easily in crowded homeless shelters in high-density urban settings. There has been ongoing concern and studies about the health and wellness of the older homeless population, typically ages 50 to 64, and older, as to whether they are significantly more sickly than their younger counterparts and if they are under-served.\n\nIn 1985, the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program was founded to assist the growing numbers of homeless living on the streets and in shelters in Boston and who were suffering from lack of effective medical services. In 2004, Boston Health Care for the Homeless in conjunction with the National Health Care for the Homeless Council published a medical manual called \"The Health Care of Homeless Persons\", edited by James J. O'Connell, M.D., specifically for the treatment of the homeless population. In June 2008 in Boston, the Jean Yawkey Place, a four-story, building, was opened by the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program. It is an entire full-service building on the Boston Medical Center campus dedicated to providing healthcare for homeless people. It also contains a long-term care facility, the Barbara McInnis House, which expanded to 104 beds, and is the first and largest medical respite program for homeless people in the United States.\n\nA 2011 study led by Dr. RebeccaT. Brown in Boston, conducted by the Institute for Aging Research (an affiliate of Harvard Medical School), Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program found the elderly homeless population had \"higher rates of geriatric syndromes, including functional decline, falls, frailty and depression than seniors in the general population and that many of these conditions may be easily treated if detected\". The report was published in the Journal of Geriatric Internal Medicine. There are government avenues which provide resources for the development of healthcare for the homeless. In the United States, the Bureau of Primary Health Care has a program which provides grants to fund the delivery of healthcare to the homeless. According to 2011 UDS data community health centers were able to provide service to 1,087,431 homeless individuals. There are also many nonprofit and religious organizations which provide healthcare services to the homeless. These organizations help meet the large need which exists for expanding healthcare for the homeless.\n\nThe 2010 passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act could provide new healthcare options for the homeless in the United States, particularly through the optional expansion of Medicaid. A 2013 Yale study indicated that a substantial proportion of the chronically homeless population in America would be able to obtain Medicaid coverage if states expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThere have been significant numbers of unsheltered persons dying of hypothermia, adding impetus to the trend of establishing warming centers as well as extending enumeration surveys with vulnerability indexes. A review article on foot and skin care of the homeless showed foot fungus as the most common ailment of the homeless, while one study showed 7% of the homeless tested positive for syphilis. Most surprising was that no single case of biopsy-proven melanoma had been reported among the homeless.\n\nIn 1999, Dr. Susan Barrow of the Columbia University Center for Homelessness Prevention Studies reported in a study that the \"age-adjusted death rates of homeless men and women were four times those of the general U.S. population and two to three times those of the general population of New York City\". A report commissioned by homeless charity Crisis in 2011 found that on average, homeless people in the UK have a life expectancy of 47 years, 30 years younger than the rest of the population.\n\nIn western countries such as the United States, the typical homeless person is male and single, with the Netherlands reporting 80% of homeless people aged 18–65 to be men. Some cities have particularly high percentages of males in homeless populations, with men comprising eighty-five percent of the homeless in Dublin. Non-white people are also overrepresented in homeless populations, with such groups two and one-half times more likely to be homeless in the U.S. The median age of homeless people is approximately 35.\n\nIn 2005, an estimated 100 million people worldwide were homeless. The following statistics indicate the approximate average number of homeless people at any one time. Each country has a different approach to counting homeless people, and estimates of homelessness made by different organizations vary wildly, so comparisons should be made with caution.\n\nThe number of homeless people worldwide has grown steadily in recent years. In some developing countries such as Nigeria and South Africa, homelessness is rampant, with millions of children living and working on the streets. Homelessness has become a problem in the countries of China, India, Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines despite their growing prosperity, mainly due to migrant workers who have trouble finding permanent homes.\n\nDetermining the true number of homeless people worldwide varies between 100 million and 1 billion people based on the exact definition used. Refugees, asylum-seekers, and internally displaced persons (ITDs) can also be considered homeless in that they too experience \"marginalization, minority status, socio-economic disadvantage, poor physical health, collapse of social supports, psychological distress, and difficulty adapting to host cultures\" like the domestic homeless.\n\nIn the past twenty years, scholars like Tipple and Speak have begun to refer to homelessness as the \"antithesis or absence of home\" rather than rooflessness or the \"lack of physical shelter.\" This complication in the homelessness debate further delineates the idea that home actually consists of an adequate shelter, an experienced and dynamic place that serves as a \"base\" for nurturing human relationships and the \"free development of individuals\" and their identity. Thus, the home is perceived to be an extension of one's self and identity. In contrast, the homeless experience, according to Moore, constitutes more as a \"lack of belonging\" and a loss of identity that leads to individuals or communities feeling \"out of place\" once they can no longer call a place of their own home \n\nThis new perspective on homelessness sheds light on the plight of refugees, a population of stateless people who are not normally included in the mainstream definition of homelessness. It has also created problems for researchers because the nature of \"counting\" homeless people across the globe relies heavily on who is considered a homeless person. Homeless individuals, and by extension refugees, can be seen as lacking lack the \"crucible of our modern society\" and lacking a way of actively belonging to and engaging with their respective communities or cultures As Casavant demonstrates, a spectrum of definitions for homelessness, called the \"continuum of homelessness,\" should refer to refugees as homeless individuals because they not only lose their home, but they are also afflicted with a myriad of problems that parallel those affecting the domestic homeless, such as \"[a lack of] stable, safe and healthy housing, an extremely low income, adverse discrimination in access to services, with problems of mental health, alcohol, and drug abuse or social disorganization\" Refugees, like the domestic homeless, lose their source of identity and way of connecting with their culture for an indefinite period of time.\n\nThus, the current definition of homelessness unfortunately allows people to simplistically assume that homeless people, including refugees, are merely \"without a place to live\" when that is not the case. As numerous studies show, forced migration and displacement brings with it another host of problems including socioeconomic instability, \"increased stress, isolation, and new responsibilities\" in a completely new environment \n\nFor people in Russia, especially the youth, alcoholism and substance abuse is a major cause and reason for becoming and continuing to be homeless. The United Nations, United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (UN-Habitat) wrote in its \"Global Report on Human Settlements\" in 1995: \"Homelessness is a problem in developed as well as in developing countries. In London, for example, life expectancy among homeless people is more than 25 years lower than the national average.\"\n\nPoor urban housing conditions are a global problem, but conditions are worst in developing countries. Habitat says that today 600 million people live in life- and health-threatening homes in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. For example, more than three in four young people had insufficient means of shelter and sanitation in some African countries like Malawi. \"The threat of mass homelessness is greatest in those regions because that is where population is growing fastest. By 2015, the 10 largest cities in the world will be in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Nine of them will be in developing countries: Mumbai, India – 27.4 million; Lagos, Nigeria – 24.4; Shanghai, China – 23.4; Jakarta, Indonesia – 21.2; São Paulo, Brazil – 20.8; Karachi, Pakistan – 20.6; Beijing, China – 19.4; Dhaka, Bangladesh – 19; Mexico City, Mexico – 18.8. The only city in a developed country that will be in the top ten is Tokyo, Japan – 28.7 million.\"\n\nIn 2008, Dr. Anna Tibaijuka, Executive Director of UN-HABITAT, referring to the recent report \"State of the World's Cities Report 2008/2009\", said that the world economic crisis we are in should be viewed as a \"housing finance crisis\" in which the poorest of poor were left to fend for themselves.\n\nIn Australia the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP) is a joint Commonwealth and state government program which provides funding for more than 1,200 organisations which are aimed to assist homeless people or those in danger of becoming homeless, as well as women and children escaping domestic violence. They provide accommodation such as refuges, shelters, and half-way houses, and offer a range of supported services. The Commonwealth has assigned over $800 million between 2000 and 2005 for the continuation of SAAP. The current program, governed by the Supported Assistance Act 1994, specifies that \"the overall aim of SAAP is to provide transitional supported accommodation and related support services, in order to help people who are homeless to achieve the maximum possible degree of self-reliance and independence. This legislation has been established to help the homeless people of the nation and help rebuild the lives of those in need. The cooperation of the states also helps enhance the meaning of the legislation and demonstrates their desire to improve the nation as best they can.\" In 2011, the Specialist Homelessness Services (SHS) program replaced the SAAP program.\n\nIn the United States, the number of homeless people grew in the 1980s, as welfare cuts increased.\n\nHousing First is an initiative to help homeless people reintegrate into society, and out of homeless shelters. It was initiated by the federal government's Interagency Council on Homelessness. It asks cities to come up with a plan to end chronic homelessness. In this direction, there is the belief that if homeless people are given independent housing to start, with some proper social supports, then there would be no need for emergency homeless shelters, which it considers a good outcome. However this is a controversial position.\n\nMiami, Florida's Community Partnership for Homeless launched a national outreach program in 2008 to help other communities throughout the United States address homelessness. Since its inception in 1993, CPH has served nearly 76,000 residents with a successful outplacement rate of nearly 62 percent in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The number of homeless people in the county has declined by 83 percent. The national program shares CPH's model of Homeless Assistance Centers, job training programs, on-site childcare, housing assistance and more. The organization also provides background on its unique funding structure and partnerships within the community.\nHomelessness has increased rapidly in the past decade. Domestic violence, substance abuse, losing jobs, unaffordable rent and issues with family are significant contributing factors.\nIn the Bowery, homelessness used to be common, but has declined since the 1970s. The area began revitalization in the 1990s and now is an upscale Manhattan neighborhood.\n\nCarrfour Supportive Housing, a nonprofit organization established in 1993 by the Homeless Committee of the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce – develops, operates and manages innovative housing communities for individuals and families in need through a unique approach combining affordable housing with comprehensive, on-site supportive services. As the leading not-for-profit provider of supportive housing in Florida, Carrfour has supplied homes for more than 10,000 formerly homeless men, women and children since its founding. \n\nIn Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 2007, a non-profit organization named Back on My Feet was created by runner Anne Mahlum as a running club for homeless men and women in the area, to help overcome homelessness through a multi-step self-help program centered on running three days a week, plus sponsored running events. Participants, drawn from local homeless shelters partnered with the organization, are assigned to different teams within each chapter and monitored by a nonresident member, and are required to commit to punctuality, endurance, self-optimism, team spirit, and sobriety. The members earn incentives through continued participation and progress, culminating in educational scholarships and assistance in finding permanent housing and employment. Back on My Feet counted a total of 400 homeless runners in nine cities after five years, and by the beginning of 2013 counted 10 different city chapters in the United States, with four more chapters planned by the end of the year.\n\nIn Boston, Massachusetts, in September 2007, an outreach to homeless people was established in the Boston Common, after some arrests and shootings, and in anticipation of the cold winter ahead. This outreach targets homeless people who would normally spend their sleeping time on the Boston Common, and tries to get them into housing, trying to skip the step of an emergency shelter. Applications for Boston Housing Authority were being handed out and filled out and submitted. This is an attempt to enact by outreach the Housing First initiative, federally mandated. Boston's Mayor, Thomas Menino, was quoted as saying \"The solution to homelessness is permanent housing\". Still, this is a very controversial strategy, especially if the people are not able to sustain a house with a proper community, health, substance counseling, and mental health supportive programs.\n\nIn October 2009, as part of the city's \"Leading the Way\" initiative, Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston dedicated and opened the Weintraub Day Center which is the first city-operated day center for chronically homeless persons. It is a multi-service center, providing shelter, counseling, healthcare, housing assistance, and other support services. It is a facility located in the Woods Mullen Shelter. It is also meant to reduce the strain on the city's hospital emergency rooms by providing services and identifying health problems before they escalate into emergencies. It was funded by $3 million in grants from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), the Massachusetts Medical Society and Alliance Charitable Foundation, and the United States Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).\n\nIn 2010 in New York City, where there were over 36,000 homeless people in 2009, there was a mobile video exhibit in the streets showing a homeless person on a screen and asking onlookers and passersby to text with their cellphones a message for him, and they also could donate money by cellphones to the organization Pathways to Housing. In September 2010, it was reported that the Housing First Initiative had significantly reduced the chronic homeless single person population in Boston, Massachusetts, although homeless families were still increasing in number. Some shelters were reducing the number of beds due to lowered numbers of homeless, and some emergency shelter facilities were closing, especially the emergency Boston Night Center. In 2011, the Department of Veterans Affairs Supportive Services for Veterans Families Initiative, SSVF, began funding private non-profit organizations and consumer cooperatives to provide supportive services to very low-income veteran families living in or transitioning to permanent housing.\n\nEnhanced data collection and evaluation\nHomeless enumeration counts are mandated by HUD for all jurisdictions participating in HUD Continuum of Care grant programs. These occur as frequently as every two years. More recently, organizations such as Common Ground have compiled Vulnerability Indexes which prioritize homeless persons. The factors include the existence of late stage terminal disease, HIV-AIDS, kidney or liver disease, frequent hospitalizations and frequent emergency room visits. The data which is compiled which exceeds the BUD mandate is retained and held confidential by Common Ground. Advocates of the system claim high rates of success in placing the most vulnerable persons, but skeptics remain concerned with confidentiality and security issues.\n\nSince the late 1990s, housing policy has been a devolved matter, and state support for the homeless, together with legal rights in housing, have therefore diverged to a certain degree. A national service, called Streetlink, was established in 2012 to help members of the public obtain near-immediate assistance for specific rough sleepers, with the support of the Government (as housing is a devolved matter, the service currently only extends to England). Currently, the service does not operate on a statutory basis, and the involvement of local authorities is merely due to political pressure from the government and charities, with funding being provided by the government (and others) on an ad-hoc basis. \n\nA member of the public who is concerned that someone is sleeping on the streets can report the individual's details via the Street Link website or by calling the referral line number on 0300 500 0914. Someone who finds themselves sleeping on the streets can also report their situation using the same methods. It is important to note that the Streetlink service is for those who are genuinely sleeping on the streets, and not those who may merely be begging, or ostensibly living their life on the streets despite a place to sleep elsewhere (such as a hostel or supported accommodation).\n\nThe annual number of homeless households in England peaked in 2003–04 at 135,420 before falling to a low of 40,020 in 2009–10. In 2014–15, there were 54,430 homeless households, which was 60 per cent below the 2003–04 peak. The UK has more than 80,000 children in temporary accommodation, a number which increases every year. In 2007 the official figures for England were that an average of 498 people slept rough each night, with 248 of those in London. It is important to note that many individuals may spend only a few days or weeks sleeping rough, and so any number for rough sleepers on a given night hides the total number of people actually affected in any one year.\n\nHomelessness in England since 2010 has been rising. By 2016 it is estimated the numbers sleeping rough had more than doubled since 2010. The National Audit Office say in relation to homelessness in England 2010-17 there has been a 60% rise in households living in temporary accommodation and a rise of 134% in rough sleepers. It is estimated 4,751 people bedded down outside overnight in England in 2017, up 15% on previous year. The housing charity Shelter used data from four sets of official 2016 statistics and calculated 254,514 people in England were homeless.\n\nThe Homelessness Reduction Act 2017 places a new duty on local authorities in England to assist people threatened with homelessness within 56 days and to assess, prevent and relieve homelessness for all eligible applicants including single homeless people from April 2018. In short, no one should be turned away.\n\nIn South Africa, there are an estimated 200,000 homeless people from a diverse range of backgrounds. Most South African municipalities preimarily view homelessness as a social dependency issue, responding with social interventions.\n\nIn Sweden, municipalities are required to provide a home to any citizen who does not have one. However, landlords and lessors have the right to select guests among applicants. Owners, including municipalities themselves, avoid homeless people, unemployed people or people with a bad credit score. People who cannot pay their rent will be evicted, including families with small children. In 2009, 618 children were evicted. In cities with a lack of housing, the only options for homeless are usually shelters; usually privately owned, often of bad quality, for which municipalities pay.\n\nIn Finland the municipalities are required by law to offer apartments or shelters to every Finnish citizen who does not have a residence. In 2007 the centre-right government of Matti Vanhanen began a special program of \"four wise men\" modeled after a US-originated Housing First policy to eliminate homelessness in Finland by 2015.\n\nAfter the abolition of serfdom in Russia in 1861, major cities experienced a large influx of former peasants who sought jobs as industrial workers in rapidly developing Russian industry. These people often lived in harsh conditions, sometimes renting a room shared between several families. There also was a large number of shelterless homeless. Immediately after the October Revolution a special program of \"compression\" (\"уплотнение\") was enabled: people who had no shelter were settled in flats of those who had large (4, 5 or 6 room) flats with only one room left to previous owners. The flat was declared state property. This led to a large number of shared flats where several families lived simultaneously. Nevertheless, the problem of complete homelessness was mostly solved as anybody could apply for a room or a place in dormitory (the number of shared flats steadily decreased after large-scale residential building program was implemented starting in the 1960s).\n\nBy 1922 there were at least 7 million homeless children in Russia as a result of nearly a decade of devastation from World War I and the Russian Civil War. This led to the creation of a large number of orphanages. By the 1930s the USSR declared the abolition of homelessness and any citizen was obliged to have a propiska – a place of permanent residency. Nobody could be stripped of propiska without substitution or refuse it without a confirmed permission (called \"order\") to register in another place. If someone wanted to move to another city or expand their living area, he had to find a partner who wanted to mutually exchange the flats. The right for shelter was secured in the Soviet constitution. Not having permanent residency was legally considered a crime.\n\nAfter the breakup of the USSR, the problem of homelessness sharpened dramatically, partially because of the legal vacuum of the early 1990s with some laws contradicting each other and partially because of a high rate of frauds in the realty market. In 1991 articles 198 and 209 of Russian criminal code which instituted a criminal penalty for not having permanent residence were abolished. In Moscow, the first overnight shelter for homeless was opened in 1992. In the late 1990s, certain amendments in law were implemented to reduce the rise in homelessness, such as the prohibition of selling last flat with registered children.\n\nNevertheless, the state is still obliged to give permanent shelter for free to anybody who needs better living conditions or has no permanent registration, because the right to shelter is still included in the constitution. Several projects of special cheap 'social' flats for those who failed to repay mortgages were proposed to facilitate mortgage market.\n\nAccording to the most recent count by the Puerto Rico Department of Family, in January 2017 there were 3,501 homeless persons in the country. The study shows that 26.2% of this population live in the capital, San Juan. Other municipalities percentage of this population was Ponce with 6.3%, Arecibo with 6%, Caguas with 5.3%, and Mayagüez with 4.7%. Results from the study determined that 76% of the homeless population were men and 24% were women and that both men and women populations, were on average age, 40 years old. This steadily increasing population, might have increased more drastically as a result of Hurricane María which caused over 90 billion dollars in damage to the island of Puerto Rico.\n\nData provided by the Department of Community Social Development of San Juan, indicates that in 1988 the number of homeless in the municipality was of 368, while in 2017 there are about 877 persons without a home. While the average age for the overall homeless population is 40 years old for both women and men, in San Juan the median is 48 years for men and 43 years for women. Other data obtained showed that more than 50% have university level education. Also it revealed that 35% of men and 25% of women have relapsed more than four times after unsuccessful attempts to reinsert themselves socially. Reasons given to wander are varied with the most common causes being drug abuse (30.6%), family problems (22.4%), financial or economic problems (15.0%), and others such as unemployment, mental health problems, domestic violence, evictions, or lack of support when released from prison.\n\nThere are estimated to be 15,000 homeless persons in Hungary of which about 6,500 live in Budapest (2016). There have been repeated attempts at criminalising homelessness in Hungary by the Fidesz government and homeless people face severe restrictions in many cities. 131 homeless people died of cold exposure in Budapest between 2006 and 2010.\n\nHomelessness in popular culture is depicted in various works. The issue is frequently described as an invisible problem, despite its prevalence. Writers and other artists play a role in bringing the issue to public attention. Homelessness is the central theme of many works; in other works homelessness is secondary, added to create interesting characters or contribute authenticity to the setting (e.g., for a story set in the impoverished inner city). Some stories and films depict homeless people in a stereotypical or pejorative manner (e.g., the exploitation film \"Hobo With a Shotgun\", which depicts homeless people fighting).\n\n\n\nAdvocates for the homeless have developed various events, commemorations, and projects to raise awareness of the issue of homelessness. In 1987, the United Nations established an International Year of Shelter for the Homeless.

The Society is made up of national branches, and within these, local clubs who usually represent a town, city or locality. The first branch was established in the United Kingdom in 1963.\n\nLocal clubs organise regular meetings, typically once a month for members to meet up, show off their latest models, discuss the hobby and work on ongoing projects. Many also organise their own annual shows and invite fellow clubs to display alongside traders, and together, these shows make up a busy calendar of events throughout each year. The UK has the most developed club network, with organisations covering virtually the whole country. Elsewhere, local clubs can often function as national branches simultaneously, such as IPMS Argentina who also represent the Mar del Plata region of the country.\n\nAt a higher level, national branches will also organise their own shows. These are typically termed 'Nationals'. The largest of these is IPMS UK's Scale ModelWorld, held at Telford in November each year and features not just local British club displays, but also contributions from overseas branches and clubs, such is its scale.\n\nIn addition to the branch and club structure, Special Interest Groups (SIG) exist which focus on a specific area or type of model building, for instance a particular aircraft such as the Tornado, a time period like the Cold War, a manufacturer such as Airfix or a genre like science fiction and fantasy. SIGs often transcend club and branch boundaries, being made up of modellers from around the world sharing a common interest. As a result, most SIGs do not meet up on a regular basis like clubs, but instead communicate more frequently online.\n\nAerobatic Display Teams ;\nAircraft Carrier ;\nAirfix Modelling ;\nAirliner ;\nAirport, Aerodrome & Airfields ;\nArmour TAS Armour ;\nAustralia ;\nAviation Ireland ;\nBattle of Britain ;\nBattleship ;\nBetween The Wars ;\nBeyond the Box ;\nBiggles ;\nBomber Command ;\nBrazil (São Paulo)\nCAFFE ;\nCanberra ;\nCar & Motorcycle ;\nCivil Aircraft 1/72 ;\nClassic British Jets ;\nClassic British Kit ;\nClassic US Jets ;\nCoastal Command ;\nCold War ;\nCruiser ;\nCzech & Slovak ;\nDC3 / C47 Dakota ;\nEighth USAAF 1942 - 45 ;\nEnglish Electric ;\nF-4 Phantom ;\nFine Waterline ;\nFinnish ;\nFleet Air Arm ;\nFormula 1 & Motorsports ;\nFrench Airforces ;\nGulf War ;\nHarrier ;\nHarvard ;\nHawk AJT ;\nHawker Hurricane ;\nHot Rod and Custom Car ;\nIsraeli Defence Forces ;\nItalia ;\nJapanese Aviation ;\nLanding Craft ;\nLatin American Aviation ;\nLuftwaffe ;\nNASA ;\nNew Zealand Aviation ;\nNight Fighter ;\nPanavia Tornado;\nPhoto-Recce ;\nPortuguese Military Aviation ;\nProject Cancelled ;\nRacing and Record Aircraft ;\nRed Cross Wings ;\nSAAF ;\nSci-Fi and Fantasy ;\nSIG 144 ;\nSmall Warships ;\nSouth Atlantic ;\nSoviet Aircraft ;\nSpecial Schemes ;\nSpitfire ;\nSplash ;\nSwedish Airforces ;\n1/32 Scale ;\nTruck ;\nUK and Commonwealth Armed Forces ;\nUS Air Forces of WWII ;\nUS Airforces ;\nUS Naval Aircraft ;\nVietnam ;\nWarbirds ;\nWhat If? ;\nWorld Helicopters ;\nWorld War Two ;\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "58893945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58893945", "title": "Kratzen", "text": "Kratzen\n\nKratzen is a \"fun\", Austrian card game for three to six players that is played for small stakes using a 33-card, William Tell pack.\n\nKratzen uses a William Tell pack (German-suited) from which all the Sixes have been removed apart from the 6 or \"Weli\", which has a special role as the permanent, 2nd highest trump. The suits are: Acorns (\"Eichel\"), Leaves (\"Laub\"), Hearts (\"Herz\") and Bells (\"Schellen\").\n\nThe ranking of the cards is: Sow (also erroneously called the Ace, actually a Deuce) (\"Sau\") > King (\"König\") > Ober > Unter > Ten > Nine > Eight > Seven. In the trump suit, the \"Weli\" is just below the Trump Sow.\n\nThe following rules are taken from kartenspiele.net, the source recommended by Geiser.\n\nThe game is in two phases. In the first phase, players may not drop out and they contribute an ante or antes to the pot. In the second phase, the aim is to win the contents of the pot, but players may drop out for an individual hand if they think they are unlikely to take the minimum number of tricks.\n\nThe first deal is a so-called \"Muss\" i.e. everyone has to participate; there is no option to 'drop out'. Each player pays an ante into the pot; the dealer pays double. The dealer shuffles and offer the pack to rearhand to cut. Rearhand cuts and shows the bottom card of the top packet. If it is the \"Weli\", a Sow or a Seven, the cutter looks at the bottom card of the lower packet. Play now proceeds as follows, depending on the cards revealed:\n\n\nThe above process is repeated each time until a normal card is cut. The dealer then deals a packet of 2 cards, in clockwise order, to each player. The next card is flipped. If it is the \"Weli\", another one is turned. Then another packet of 2 cards is dealt to each player. The upcard determines the trump suit and belongs to the dealer. So the dealer will have at least one, and possibly two, extra cards.\n\nThe dealer now becomes the striker (\"Schläger\"), effectively the soloist, and must take at least 2 tricks. He discards one or two cards to reduce his hand to four and leads to the first trick. The others have to take at least one trick. \n\nSuit must be followed (\"Farbzwang\"), trumps played if that is not possible (\"Trumpfzwang\") and players must head the trick if they are able (\"Stichzwang\"). The winner of a trick leads to the next.\n\nAfter 4 tricks have been played, the score is reckoned. If the Striker has not won a minimum of 2 tricks, he pays a penalty of double the pot contents. If a defender has not won at least 1 trick, he pays a penalty equivalent to the pot.\n\nThe role of dealer now rotates to the left and the new dealer pays an ante to the pot, shuffles and offers the cards to rearhand to cut. The aforementioned rules for determining the eventual dealer apply and the cards are then dealt. This time the dealer chooses one of the following four contracts: \n\n\nIf other players wish to bid, they must outbid any previously announced contracts. The contracts rank in the above order.\n\nPlayers then decide whether to \"play\" (\"mitgehen\") or \"drop out\" (\"Spiel verzichten\"). In a variant of the rules, a player has the right to announce his decision last; the first one to claim this right has it.\n\nNext, the participating players may exchange any number of hand cards for cards in the talon. The first 3 may be exchanged without revealing them. The fourth and fifth cards to be exchanged must be faced up and, for each trump, the player is dealt another card. if the Trump Ace is dealt face up, the player is given 5 extra cards, face down. They can they rearrange their hand and discard excess cards to bring their hand down to four again. \n\nA special feature is the Seven Muss (\"Siebenermuss\"). If the trump suit has been determined by a Seven, the deal becomes a \"Muss\" and is played as in the first phase. Each player only needs one trick to win, regardless of whether they were the striker or not. \n\nWith the exception of the Seven Muss, the game continues as follows. The striker must win at least two tricks, the other active players at least one. For each trick won, players earn 1/4 of the pot. The indivisible remainder can either remain in the pot or be assigned to the striker If any player fails to achieve his target, he pays an amount equivalent to that already in the pot, or double if he is the striker. If no player has to pay a penalty, the pot is either empty again or contains an indivisible remainder. Then the next round is another \"Muss\". Otherwise another normal game is played.\n\n\n"}

For example, Dr. Tezuka changed the conclusion of his original manga story (represented in the last two episodes of this series) to a happy ending.\n\"Leo the Lion\" does not follow immediately from the end of the \"Kimba\" series. Instead, the story begins a couple of years following the end of the previous series. To English-speaking audiences, the behavior of the title character is inexplicably out of line with what was established in the first series. At the end of the first series, in the original Japanese script, Kimba promises to keep his animals separate from humans. It is this promise that drives the seemingly hermit-like Leo in this series.\nAs the series unfolds, the focus shifts from the title character to one of his cubs, the male named Rune. This series as a whole is about Rune's growth, from a whining weakling to a confident leader.\n\nThis Japanese series was dubbed into English by a company based in Miami, Florida in the United States known as SONIC-Sound International Corporation, and run by Enzo Caputo. \"Leo the Lion\" (so named because Leo was the Japanese name for the Kimba character) aired on CBN Cable Network in 1984, The theme song for the English dub was written by Mark Boccaccio and Susan Brunet.\n\nStuart Chapin, who dubbed many of the voices into English, \"colloquialized\" all 26 scripts. After Chapin and Caputo clashed about basic matters (Chapin wanted the series to reference Kimba, a show Caputo never heard of; Chapin also wanted the Thompson gazelle to be called \"Tommy\" but Caputo stuck with \"Tumy\" because that was how the Japanese spelled it), Chapin ignored most of the plots and made up the scripts as he pleased, matching the dialog to lip movements. Thus, an elephant quotes a poem by Emily Dickinson and a gadget-heavy spy episode becomes a vehicle for \"Sterling Bond\", James' hapless brother. In later scripts, puns abounded. In the last script, Chapin had Leo/Kimba (voiced by Caputo himself) explain the Kimba name mix-up.\n\nWhile there is some speculation that Leo's cub Rune is Leo himself, Leo is actually grown up to a fully adult lion with white fur. Unlike the previous series, the producers of the English-dubbed version of this series used the original Japanese names for nearly all the characters:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31643353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31643353", "title": "Man Down (song)", "text": "Man Down (song)\n\n\"Man Down\" is a song by Barbadian singer, Rihanna from her fifth studio album, \"Loud\" (2010). Singer Shontelle and production duo Rock City wrote the song with its main producer, Sham. They wrote it during a writing camp, in Los Angeles of March 2010, held by Rihanna's record label to gather compositions for possible inclusion on the then-untitled album. Rock City were inspired by Bob Marley's 1973 song \"I Shot the Sheriff\" and set out to create a song which embodied the same feel, but from a female perspective. \"Man Down\" is a reggae song which incorporates elements of ragga and electronic music. Lyrically, Rihanna is a fugitive after she shoots a man, an action she later regrets. Several critics singled out \"Man Down\" as \"Loud\"s highlight, while others commented on her prominent West Indian accent and vocal agility.\n\nDef Jam released \"Man Down\" on May 3, 2011, as the fifth single from the album. In the United States, the single reached number 59 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number 9 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It has been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The song topped the chart in France for five consecutive weeks and reached the top three in Belgium and the Netherlands. Anthony Mandler directed its music video, in which Rihanna's character shoots a man after he rapes her. The video was criticized by the Parents Television Council, Industry Ears and Mothers Against Violence, who faulted Rihanna for suggesting that murder is an acceptable form of justice for rape victims. However, actress Gabrielle Union, a rape victim, praised the video for being relatable. \"Man Down\" was on the set list for three of Rihanna's tours – the Loud Tour (2011), the Diamonds World Tour (2013) and the Anti World Tour (2016).\n\nIn March 2010, record label Def Jam held a writing camp in Los Angeles for songwriters and producers to compose material for possible inclusion on Rihanna's then-untitled fifth studio album, \"Loud\". Def Jam rented out nearly every recording studio in Los Angeles in order to create as many songs as possible. Ray Daniels, the manager of musical duo Rock City (brothers Theron and Timothy Thomas), was present during the sessions, and stated that a writing camp typically involves the label hiring ten recording studios for two weeks at the cost of $25,000 per day. Daniels revealed that it is where songwriters have lyrics but no music, and where producers have music but no lyrics.\n\nShama Joseph, professionally known as Sham, was hired as one of the producers to work on crafting songs at the camp. Sham's manager had arranged his attendance at the camp through an acquaintance who was an employee of the record label. Sham explained that he found a flight to Los Angeles and began working on music as soon as he arrived, stating that he had \"nothing to lose and everything to gain\". He was inspired by a vision of Rihanna performing songs at a concert that were Caribbean themed. Sham felt that Rihanna had not explored Caribbean-themed music since her debut album, \"Music of the Sun\" (2005).\n\nAccording to Daniels, Rock City knew Sham but they had not heard the West Indian/Caribbean-themed music that he had composed during the camp. Sham played the music to them, to which the brothers responded \"Let's give Rihanna a one-drop! Like, a response to 'I shot the sheriff'!\" Together, Sham and Rock City wrote the lyrics to \"Man Down\" in twelve minutes. In an MTV News interview, Rock City said they intended to write a song that would embody Bob Marley's \"I Shot the Sheriff\" (1973) from a female perspective and to \"tap [Rihanna's] island origins in a way that sounded authentic\". Singer Shontelle said that Rihanna called her during the Last Girl on Earth tour and asked her to be involved with the song. She confirmed that Rihanna was present when she was writing her part in the recording studio. Shontelle elucidated that following one of Rihanna's concerts, the singer exited the stage and immediately returned to the tour bus to work in the studio. Daniels said that once the writing camp had concluded, Rihanna listened to all of the songs which had been composed for her and chose her favorites. In September 2010, several months after Sham attended the writing camp, Rihanna called him and said that she wanted to record \"Man Down\" for inclusion on \"Loud\".\n\nRihanna later described the sentiment she wanted to express as \"gangsta\", and elaborated on how reggae culture has influenced her musical style: \"I'm super inspired by reggae music [and it] has been a part of me since I was born, and I grew up listening to it. I was exciting for me to take this on as my own and do a song like this, especially with the lyrics being like that.\" The track was composed during Rihanna's Last Girl on Earth tour. The song's instrumental was recorded by Cary Clark at The Village in Los Angeles. Kuk Harrell produced Rihanna's vocals with Josh Gudwin and Marcos Tovar at Westlake Recording Studios, also in Los Angeles. Bobby Campbell assisted with vocal production and recording. The song was mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Sound Studios in Los Angeles, assisted by Erik Madrid and Christian Plata.\n\nDaniels estimated the total cost of the writing camp to be approximately $200,000, averaging $18,000 for each of the eleven songs which were included on \"Loud\"; the camp consisted of forty writers and producers. Daniels confirmed that Rock City received $15,000 and Sham $20,000 for their part in the production of \"Man Down\". He said that \"to get that twelve minutes of inspiration from a top songwriting team is expensive — even before you take into account the fee for the songwriters\". A cost of $53,000 for \"Man Down\" was already incurred prior to Rihanna entering the studio with a vocal producer. Although Makeba Riddick did not serve as the song's vocal producer, Daniels cited her as an example of how the process works and how much she would charge. It is the responsibility of the vocal producer to tell a singer how to sing the song correctly to achieve the desired sound. Daniels said that Riddick's fee varies from $10,000 to $15,000, and that the final part of the process is for the song to be mixed and mastered, which incurs a similar fee. He estimated the final cost of writing, producing, vocal producing, mixing and mastering \"Man Down\" to be $78,000. When combined with the marketing and promotional costs, the total expense was $1,078,000.\n\n\"Man Down\" is a reggae murder ballad with \"Caribbean-rhythms\" and elements of ragga and electronic music. The song, in the key of C minor, has a tempo of 77 beats per minute. Rihanna's voice spans more than one and a half octaves, from F to E. Slant Magazine critic Sal Cinquemani described \"Man Down\" as one of Rihanna's \"most confident vocal performances\" with her strong Barbadian patois. Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\" said that the singer \"plays up her West Indian accent\", and August Brown of the \"Los Angeles Times\" described the vocals as reasserting \"her Caribbean lilt\". \"Entertainment Weekly\" writer Leah Greenblatt described \"Man Down\" as a song with \"island rhythms\". Lyrically, Rihanna is a fugitive after she shoots a man, but later regrets it. Rihanna slowly relays the chain of events which led up to the murder. She cries to her mother about the act that she has committed – \"Mama, I just shot a man down\" – expressing guilt and remorse for not meaning to kill her attacker, and that he is somebody's son. As the track develops, Rihanna's Bajan accent becomes stronger and exaggerated, which climaxes during the bridge as she declares \"Why deed I pull dee treeguh, pull dee treeguh, pull dee treeguh, BOOM!\" MuuMuse writer Bradley Stern thought that the track took on a confessional tone.\n\nOn February 8, 2009, Rihanna was reported to have been involved in an altercation with her boyfriend, Chris Brown. He allegedly punched Rihanna and threatened to kill her. Brown turned himself in to the police and pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault during the trial. August Brown called the song an apparent \"warning\" to Chris Brown and a response to his song \"Deuces\" (2010), which denounces an ex-lover. Kitty Empire of \"The Guardian\" wrote that Brown's assault on Rihanna gives the song lyrical context, and that Rihanna sings the song with \"bittersweet menace.\" When asked by HipHopDX about how he reacted to listeners of the song saying that it condones violence, Sham dismissed the accusations:\n\nOn March 1, 2011, Rihanna asked fans to help her choose the next single from \"Loud\" using Twitter, saying that she would film a music video in the forthcoming weeks. After an influx of suggestions, the singer said she had narrowed the options down to four songs: \"Man Down\", \"California King Bed\", \"Cheers (Drink to That)\" and \"Fading\". On March 12, she confirmed that \"California King Bed\" had been selected as the next international single. However, \"Man Down\" was sent to rhythmic and urban radio stations in the United States on May 3, before the May 13 release of \"California King Bed\", making \"Man Down\" and \"California King Bed\" the fifth and sixth singles from \"Loud\". The song was released in France and Switzerland on July 11 and the Netherlands on July 15.\n\nKitty Empire called the track \"excellent\", and praised it for being an original composition which is reminiscent of a \"righteous old reggae murder ballad\". \"Consequence of Sound\" writer Ryan Burleson said that \"Man Down\" and another album track called \"Fading\" both \"stand on their own sonically\", and that the former is an homage to her Caribbean heritage with its dancehall melody. Describing the track as \"breezy\", Bradley Stern thought that no other song on \"Loud\" embodied Rihanna's personality more so than on \"Man Down\". Cinquemani chose \"Man Down\" as the best song on \"Loud\", calling Rihanna's vocal agility \"surprising\" and noting that the \"fully-fledged reggae\" song is co-written by a fellow Barbadian-born singer, Shontelle.\n\nIn her review of \"Loud\", Emily Mackay of \"NME\" called its experimentation more \"organic\" than that on Rihanna's previous album \"Rated R\" (2009), citing \"Man Downs theme of \"doomed youth\". Similarly, Nima Baniamer of Contactmusic.com pointed out that \"Man Down\", which she described as \"a dark track\" that is \"haunting\" yet \"delightfully intriguing\", was reminiscent of the material on \"Rated R\". In their review of Rihanna's top 20 songs, \"Time Out\" ranked \"Man Down\" as their tenth best track, writing that it is Rihanna at \"her badass best\". \"Complex\" staff compiled a list of their top 26 Rihanna songs, and ranked \"Man Down\" in thirteenth place; Claire Lobenfeld thought that it was the singers most \"cinematic\" song of her career, and that she elevated the theme of \"accidental manslaughter\" from \"downtrodden\" to \"adorable\".\n\nIn the United States, \"Man Down\" debuted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at number 94 on June 1, 2011, peaking at number 59 and spending a total of 14 weeks on the chart. On the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, it peaked at number 9 on August 6, 2011, remaining there for 2 weeks and spending a total of 19 weeks charting. It was number 47 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs 2011 year-end list. The track peaked at number 56 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart, number 20 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Digital Songs chart and number 40 on the Radio Songs chart. \"Man Down\" was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of more than 2 million units. The song reached number 92 on the Canadian Hot 100.\n\n\"Man Down\" debuted at number 65 on the French Singles Chart on June 6, 2011, a month before its release as a single. It rose to number 1 on July 30, remaining there for 5 consecutive weeks, and was number 2 the week before and for 3 weeks after its chart-topping run. It stayed on the chart until May 12, 2012, but re-entered three weeks later. The song, on and off the French chart for the rest the year, continued to appear on it sporadically in 2013. After a total of 73 weeks on the chart, the track's last French chart appearance was at number 172 on August 8, 2013.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Man Down\" entered the Singles Chart at number 117 on June 11, 2015, reaching number 75 the following week. The song peaked at number 54 in its fourth week, remaining there for 2 weeks and spending a total of 11 weeks on the chart. On the UK R&B Chart, \"Man Down\" reached number 15 on June 26, spending 18 weeks in the top 40. In Belgium, the song peaked at number 3 in Dutch-speaking Flanders and number 2 in French-speaking Wallonia. It was certified gold by the Belgian Entertainment Association (BEA) for selling more than 15,000 copies. Although the song spent only 1 week on the Italian Singles Chart (at number 8), it was certified platinum by the Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana (FIMI) in 2014 for selling more than 30,000 copies.\n\nAnthony Mandler directed the music video for \"Man Down\" in April 2011 on a beach in Portland Parish, on the northeastern Jamaican coast. Rihanna told \"Rap-Up\" that the video has a \"strong underlying message [for] girls like me!\" On May 1, 2011, three camera phone teaser photos, of Rihanna on a beach in a white Dolce & Gabbana dress and riding a bicycle in Portland Parish, were released. The music video premiered on BET's \"106 & Park\" on May 31, 2011. In an interview for MTV News, Mandler said that \"Man Down\" required \"a strong narrative and visual\" and that fans could expect something \"dramatic and shocking and intense and emotions and uplifting and enlightening\".\n\nThe video opens as the protagonist (Rihanna) shoots and kills a man while he walks through a busy train station. She flees before a flashback to the previous day, when she rides her bike, meets friends and is alone in a bedroom at dusk. At a nightclub the protagonist dances and flirts with another club-goer, who then attacks her when she leaves the club. Disheveled, the woman cries in the street after an implied sexual assault, and the video ends as she runs home to grab a gun hidden in a dresser drawer.\n\nJanell Hobson analysed the imagery presented in the video for \"Man Down\" in her book \"Body as Evidence: Mediating Race, Globalizing Gender\", which \"challenges postmodernist dismissals of identity politics and the delusional belief that the Millennial era reflects a 'postracial' and 'postfeminist' world.\" In the chapter titled \"Disclosures: Black Women's Resistance to Sexual Violence\", Hobson explores how black women have \"found the courage\" to speak out about sexual violence, protest against it and not remain a silent victim. She recalled Rihanna's interview for \"20/20\" with Diane Sawyer, which aired on November 6, 2009. Having remained silent about her altercation with Brown on the evening of the Grammy Party in February that year, whereby Brown assaulted her, Rihanna decided to speak about it for the first time. The author noted how Sawyer decided to approach the interview by presenting the couples relationship and assault case as an \"anomaly\" and accused Rihanna of \"projecting a 'fake' imagery of strong black woman\", rather than presenting her another domestic violence victim not only in the United States, but in the world. \"I \"am\" strong,\" Rihanna responded. Hobson wrote that from then on, the singer decided to project an image of \"hardcore masculinity and dominatrix-type femininity in her music trajectory\".\n\nSubsequently, several of Rihanna's songs and music videos have courted controversy for their violent themes, which Hobson attributes to the leaking of a photo showing the singers \"battered face\" on the evening of the assault by TMZ which circulated the internet without the permission of Rihanna. Hobson writes: \"Because of this, Rihanna has had to wrest back control of the 'victim' image foisted on her, and she in turn has challenged us rhetorically and visually to question and examine the power, danger, and violences that shape our relationships.\" She continued to highlight the music videos for \"Russian Roulette\", \"Hard\", \"We Found Love\", \"Love the Way You Lie\" with Eminem which documents domestic violence, and \"S&M\", which contains references to bondage and fetishism and is, in part, Rihanna's response to disparaging critics, as examples. At one point in the video for \"S&M\", Rihanna is literally tied up as a victim.\n\nHowever, Hobson noted that Rihanna \"rejects the victim stance\" in the video for \"Man Down\", and elucidated that she played the role of a rape survivor who shot her attacker. She attributed the location of shooting the video in Jamaica as significant, due to how the image of a gun proliferated during 1990s Jamaican dance hall's to \"express female rage\". The prologue depicts Rihanna as a \"dark-hooded\" \"femme fatale\" whereby the narrative explains her motives for murder and provokes the spectator to sympathize with her because she danced in a provocative manner with a man in a club, which Hobson suggests is \"somehow deserving of rape\". She continued to explain that Rihanna is inviting the audience to consider what justice means by \"pointing both a literal and lyrical gun at the issue\". Hobson concluded that Rihanna is protecting her vulnerability and countering the image of the abused black woman who is looked at unsympathetically in society.\n\nBeck Bain of Idolator described the video as \"visually stunning\", while \"Metro\" writer Lee Ann labelled it as \"shocking\". Co-writer of \"Man Down\" Theron Thomas felt that the video was very theatrical and that Rihanna played her role \"perfectly\". He continued to say that had the video been a lyric-by-lyric representation, the narrative would have been more \"graphic\".\n\nThe Parents Television Council (PTC) criticized Rihanna for her portrayal of \"cold, calculated execution of murder\" in the music video, and argued that murdering a rapist as socially-acceptable justice is impermissible. The group disagreed with Rihanna's rationale for the storyline: that the video has \"a very strong underlying message [for] girls\" like Rihanna. According to the PTC and Industry Ears, if Chris Brown murdered a woman in a video that premiered on BET \"the world would stop\" and Rihanna should not have been allowed to release her clip. The week before the council's statement about the video it had objected to Rihanna and Britney Spears' performance of the \"S&M\" remix at the \"Billboard\" Music Awards, having called it a \"profanity-laced, S&M sex show on prime-time broadcast television\".\n\nAfter the PTC's statement, Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of AlterNet wrote that the group seemed to employ a double standard; it had not condemned Kanye West's music video for \"Monster\", in which dead women hang from ceilings and West holds a severed head. Shepard added that Eminem and Rihanna's video for \"Love the Way You Lie\" had not been criticized, despite the fact that she felt that it \"glorified and romanticized\" domestic violence. A Mothers Against Violence spokesperson criticised Rihanna for failing to present a solution, rather than encouraging the vulnerable youth, for which rape is a reality for many people. Director Anthony Mandler addressed the controversy in an interview for \"The Hollywood Reporter\", saying that the visual evoked the reaction he intended and that it highlighted an issue still taboo in modern society. He recalled growing up in an era in which artists such as Madonna released controversial music videos, and noted that contemporary videos no longer tackle taboo subjects as frequently.\n\nRihanna responded to the PTC's criticism on Twitter, and said that parents should not expect her to parent their children and that \"touchy subject matters\" should not be hidden from children otherwise they will not learn how to adapt in society, and that it empowers abusers even more because children are embarrassed to talk about rape. The singer continued to state that \"the industry isn't 'Parent's 'R Us and that singers \"have the freedom to create art\". In an interview for \"BET\", Rihanna further explain why rape was used as the vehicle to push the story forward in the video despite the lyrics not mentioning rape, saying \"Making that into a mini-movie or video, we needed to go back to why it happened. Obviously she's not a cold-blooded killer. It had to be something so offensive. And we decided to home in on a very serious matter that people are afraid to address, especially if you've been victimized in this scenario.\" Rihanna added that the character is remorseful for her actions.\n\nActress and women's-health advocate Gabrielle Union, a rape victim, voiced support for the video on Twitter. Union called it \"brave\" and, although she did not agree with the eye for an eye sentiment, she could relate to the situation. Union said that every rape victim or survivor is a unique situation, and that they all have an idea of how justice should be served. She admitted that she tried to shoot her rapist, but missed, and that she has since realised that committing murder as a form of justice for herself would not have made the situation better. She continued to say that while it is \"understandable\" to desire to kill a rapist, unless it is in self-defense then it is not advisable.\n\nRihanna has included \"Man Down\" on the set lists of several concerts and tours, including the 2011 Loud Tour, BBC Radio 1's Hackney Weekend on May 24, 2012 and the 2013 Diamonds World Tour. For the Loud Tour, Rihanna performed the song on \"a levitating, rotating platform, a conveyer belt and graffiti-laden car shell.\" Although Kitty Empire described \"Man Down\" as \"terrific\", the critic felt let down by the \"baffling lack of creativity\" from Rihanna's production team for the stage set up during Rihanna's performance. She wrote that she did not understand why a truck bonnet was in the middle of the stage. Maza praised the tracks placement on the set-list. \"Man Down\" was performed as the fourth song on the Loud Tour, following its opener \"Only Girl (In the World)\", \"Disturbia\" and \"Shut Up and Drive\". Maza noted that the tempo of \"Man Down\" should have \"slowed down the momentum she'd accumulated until then but that was instead an ideal marriage of production and performance.\" Instead, the red lights on the stage played up the \"ominous\" tone of the song as it gradually increased its tempo to the point whereby the end of the song was on the verge of sounding like an incantation.\n\nFor the Diamonds World Tour, Rihanna performed \"Man Down\" in a Caribbean-theme section of the show, which also included \"You da One\", \"No Love Allowed\", \"What's My Name?\" and \"Rude Boy\".\n\nBritish singer and songwriter Leona Lewis performed a mashup of \"Man Down\" with her 2008 single \"Better in Time\" at BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge in June 2011. She also included the mashup on the set list of her 2013 Glassheart Tour. Her rendition received a mixed response from critics. Katherine Hollisey-McLean of the \"Worthing Herald\" complimented the fusion of \"Better in Time\" with reggae beats, while \"The Guardian\"s Malcolm Jack thought the performance was \"cringey\" and called Lewis a \"reasonably priced Rihanna\".\n\n\n"}

According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, given the complexity of the Syrian conflict, media bias in reporting remains a key challenge, plaguing the collection of useful data and misinforming researchers and policymakers regarding the actual events taking place.\n\nAs in the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt, the Internet played a major role in the organization and coverage of the protests/armed-uprising. As of 2011 the largest Facebook page in support of the Syrian uprising was \"The Syrian Revolution 2011\", which claimed more than 383,000 followers. The page, co-founded by Fida al-Sayed, reports on news related to the uprising and provides general guidelines for protests.\n\nAs of 2015 the largest Facebook page in support of the Syrian President Bashar-al-Assad has more than 2,958,595 followers.\n\n\nSince international news media was banned in Syria, the main source of second-hand information/dis-information was private videos usually taken by shaky mobile phone cameras and uploaded to YouTube. Such videos were difficult to verify independently, and several TV stations showed older footage from Iraq and Lebanon, which was claimed to have been filmed in Syria. Twitter accounts have also been used to spread news and opinions about the conflict, using pictures from mobile phones. For example, pro Assad Rana Harbi from Lebanon is one of the most popular persons using tweets to inform about the conflict development (using pictures from mobile phones). \n\nBetween January 2012 and September 2013, over a million videos documenting the war have been uploaded, and they have received hundreds of millions of views. \"The Wall Street Journal\" states that the \"unprecedented confluence of two technologies—cellphone cams and social media—has produced, via the instant upload, a new phenomenon: the YouTube war.\" \"The New York Times\" states that online videos have \"allowed a widening war to be documented like no other.\"\n\nProminent videos include the rebel commander Abu Sakkar cutting organs from the dead body of a Syrian soldier and putting one of them in his mouth, \"as if he is taking a bite out of it\". He called rebels to follow his example and terrorize the Alawite sect, which mostly backs Assad.\n\nSyria is ranked the third most repressive country in the world in terms of press freedom by the Committee to Protect Journalists, and the 4th most repressive by Reporters Without Borders.\n\nIt has been rumoured that Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) television interviews sometimes use government supporters 'disguised as locals' who stand near sites of destruction and claim that they were caused by rebel fighters.\n\nThe Lebanese newspaper \"As-Safir\" cited outtakes of interviews showing that the channel's staff coached Syrian eyewitnesses and fabricated reports of oppression by Syria's government. It refers to leaked internal e-mails suggest that Al Jazeera has become subordinated to the Qatari emir's assertive foreign policy, which supports Syria's rebels and advocates military intervention in the country.\n\nIn March 2012, Al Jazeera correspondents Ali Hashim and two others resigned from their jobs because of objections over the reporting on the conflict. They reported that Al Jazeera paid $50,000 for smuggling phones and satellite communication tools to Syria's rebels. Hashim concluded, \"The channel was taking a certain stance. It was meddling with each and every detail of reports on the Syrian revolution.\"\n\nAhmad Ibrahim, who is in charge of the Al Jazeera's coverage on Syria, is the brother of a leading member of the opposition Syrian National Council. Al Jazeera reportedly put pressure on its journalists to use the term \"martyr\" for slain Syrian rebels, but not pro-government forces.\n\nIn January 2013, a former News Editor at Al Jazeera, who was from Syria, and had been at Al Jazeera for \"nearly a decade\" was fired without cause given, but in an interview stated their belief that it was linked to his/her resistance of ongoing strong pressure to conform to biased coverage of the Syrian civil war. The former Editor stated that the Muslim Brotherhood was \"controlling the Syrian file at Al-Jazeera\" with both organizations biasing news coverage in favour of the Brotherhood ousting the Syrian government of Assad by force and warning the then-editor \"the majority [in Syria] is with the Muslim Brotherhood and [taking power] is within our grasp\" so \"thank your god if you get a pardon when we become the government.\" The source named the names of several other former employees who resigned in protest, including director of the Berlin bureau Aktham Sleiman, a Syrian, \"who was, at the beginning, with the [Syrian] opposition\" but resisted what the interviewee terms the \"lies and despicable [political and ethnic] sectarianism\" and concluded that \"Al-Jazeera has lied and is still lying\" about Syria and in favour of armed overthrow and of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nPropaganda has been used by the Syrian government since the beginning of the conflict. The Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), the official government news agency, often refers to the FSA and ISIS as \"armed gangs\" or \"terrorists\" - while other media sources maintain that only part of the opposition are 'extremists'. President Assad has characterized the opposition as armed terrorist groups with Islamist \"takfiri\" extremist motives, portraying himself as the last guarantee for a secular government form.\nSyrian public school instructors teach students that the conflict is a foreign conspiracy.\n\nThe Syrian foreign ministry called the U.S. government's statements in 2012, concerning the danger of the Syrian government using chemical weapons against civilians a myth they invented to launch a campaign against Syria and \"a joke\", thus accusing the U.S. of propaganda on that subject; which accusation and denial of above-mentioned danger, 'are in turn of course again examples of propaganda'.\n\nIn 2016, it was revealed through emails of Hillary Clinton that Google and Al-Jazeera planned to encourage defections from the Syrian government, through various internet tools that disseminate information.\n\nBoth sides have been distributing on social media videos and photos of violence, while falsely claiming that the atrocities had been committed by the opposition: later it turned out to be footage from conflicts in other countries.\n\nExamples:\n\n\nIt has been maintained that, by October 2012, 'more than hundred professional or citizen journalists' had reportedly died in the Syrian Civil War. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 13 journalists were killed in work-related incidents during the first eighteen months of the uprising. During the same period, Reporters Without Borders said a total of 33 journalists were killed. Examples are Marie Colvin who was killed by an explosion during the battle of Homs, but at least one, French journalist Gilles Jacquier, was killed by rebel mortar fire.\n\nExcept for those hand-picked by the government, journalists have been banned from reporting in Syria. Those who have entered the country regardless have been targeted. Within a month of the protests taking off, at least seven local and international journalists were detained, and at least one of them was beaten. 'Citizen journalist' Mohammed Hairiri was arrested in April 2012, tortured in prison, and sentenced to death in May 2012 for giving an interview for Al Jazeera. Jordanian Salameh Kaileh was tortured and detained in deplorable conditions before being deported.\n\nOn 13 December 2012, NBC News reporter Richard Engel and his five crew members, Aziz Akyavaş, Ghazi Balkiz, John Kooistra, Ian Rivers and Ammar Cheikh Omar, were abducted in Syria. Having escaped after five days in captivity, Engel said he believed that a Shabiha group loyal to al-Assad was behind the abduction, and that the crew was freed by the Ahrar ash-Sham group five days later. Engel's account was however challenged from early on. In April 2015, NBC had to revise the kidnapping account, following further investigations by \"The New York Times\", which suggested that the NBC team \"was almost certainly taken by a Sunni criminal element affiliated with the Free Syrian Army,\" rather than by a loyalist Shia group.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2549178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2549178", "title": "Milky Way (mythology)", "text": "Milky Way (mythology)\n\nThere are many myths and legends about the origin of the Milky Way, the crowd of stars that makes a distinctive bright streak across the night sky.\n\nAncient Armenian mythology called the Milky Way the \"Straw Thief's Way\". According to legend, the god Vahagn stole some straw from the Assyrian king Barsham and brought it to Armenia during a cold winter. When he fled across the heavens, he spilled some of the straw along the way.\n\nThe Khoisan people of the Kalahari desert in southern Africa say that long ago there were no stars and the night was pitch black. A girl, who was lonely and wanted to visit other people, threw the embers from a fire into the sky and created the Milky Way.\n\nA Cherokee folktale tells of a dog who stole some cornmeal and was chased away. He ran away to the north, spilling the cornmeal along the way. The Milky Way is thus called ᎩᎵ ᎤᎵᏒᏍᏓᏅᏱ (\"Gili Ulisvsdanvyi\") \"The Way the Dog Ran Away\".\n\nPeoples in Eastern Asia believed that the hazy band of stars was the \"Silvery River\" of Heaven (, and ). In one story, the stars Altair and Vega were said to be two lovers who were allowed to meet only once a year on the seventh day of the seventh month, when a flock of magpies and crows formed a bridge over the galactic river. That day is celebrated as Qi Xi, the \"Seventh Night\" (, and ).\n\nIn Egyptian mythology, the Milky Way was considered a pool of cow's milk. The Milky Way was deified as a fertility cow-goddess by the name of Bat (later on syncretized with the sky goddess Hathor).\n\nAmong the Finns, Estonians and related peoples, the Milky Way was and is called \"The Pathway of the Birds\" (, ). The Finns observed that the migratory birds used the galaxy as a guideline to travel south, where they believed \"Lintukoto\" (bird home) resided.\n\nIn Estonian folklore it is believed that the birds are led by a white bird with the head of a maiden who chases birds of prey away. The maiden, the goddess Lindu, was the Queen of the Birds and the daughter of Uko, the King of the Sky. After refusing the suits of the Sun and Moon for being too predictable in their routes and the Pole Star for being fixed, she fell in love with the Light of North for its beauty. They became engaged, but the inconstant Light of North left her soon afterward. The tears of the broken-hearted Lindu fell on her wedding veil, which became the Milky Way when her father brought her to heaven so she could reign by his side and guide the migrating birds, who followed the trail of stars in her veil. Only later did scientists indeed confirm this observation; the migratory birds use the Milky Way as a guide to travel to warmer, southern lands during the winter.\n\nThe name in the Indo-European Baltic languages has the same meaning (, ).\n\nIn the Babylonian epic poem \"Enûma Eliš\", the Milky Way is created from the severed tail of the primeval salt water dragoness Tiamat, set in the sky by Marduk, the Babylonian national god, after slaying her. This story was once thought to have been based on an older Sumerian version in which Tiamat is instead slain by Enlil of Nippur, but is now though to be purely an invention of Babylonian propagandists with the intention to show Marduk as superior to the Sumerian deities. Another myth about Labbu is similarly interpreted.\n\nThe Greek name for the Milky Way (Γαλαξίας \"Galaxias\") is derived from the Greek word for milk (γάλα, \"gala\"). One legend explains how the Milky Way was created by Heracles when he was a baby. His father, Zeus, was fond of his son, who was born of the mortal woman Alcmene. He decided to let the infant Heracles suckle on his divine wife Hera's milk when she was asleep, an act which would endow the baby with godlike qualities. When Hera woke and realized that she was breastfeeding an unknown infant, she pushed him away and the spurting milk became the Milky Way.\n\nAnother version of the myth is that Heracles (Roman Hercules) was abandoned in the woods by his mortal parents, Amphitryon and Alcmene. Heracles, son of Zeus and Alcmene, was naturally favored by his father, who sent Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom, to retrieve him. Athena, not being so motherly, decided to take him to Hera to suckle. Hera agreed to suckle Heracles As Heracles drinks the milk, he bites down, and Hera pushes him away in pain. The milk that squirts out forms the Milky Way. \n\nA story told by the Roman Hyginus in the \"Poeticon astronomicon\" (ultimately based on Greek myth) says that the milk came from the goddess Ops (Greek Rhea), or Opis, the wife of Saturn (Greek Cronus). Saturn swallowed his children to ensure his position as head of the Pantheon and sky god, and so Ops conceived a plan to save her newborn son Jupiter (Greek Zeus): She wrapped a stone in infant's clothes and gave it to Saturn to swallow. Saturn asked her to nurse the child once more before he swallowed it, and the milk that spurted when she pressed her nipple against the rock eventually became the Milky Way.\n\nIn the Hindu collection of stories called Bhagavata Purana, all the visible stars and planets moving through space are likened to a dolphin that swims through the water, and the heavens are called \"śiśumãra cakra\", the dolphin disc. The Milky Way forms the abdomen of the dolphin and is called \"Akasaganga\" which means \"The Ganges River of the Sky\".\n\nAccording to Hindu mythology, Vishnu lies meditating on Shesha with his consort Lakshmi, in the Kshira Sagara (Sea of Milk).\n\nIn Irish mythology, the main name of the Milky Way was \"Bealach na Bó Finne\" — Way of the White Cow. It was regarded as a heavenly reflection of the sacred River Boyne, which is described as \"the Great Silver Yoke\" and the \"White Marrow of Fedlimid,\" names which could equally apply to the Milky Way. (\"Mór-Chuing Argait\", \"Smir Find Fedlimthi\").\n\nOther names include:\n\nIn Hungarian mythology, Csaba, the mythical son of Attila the Hun and ancestor of the Hungarians, is supposed to ride down the Milky Way when the Székelys (ethnic Hungarians living in Transylvania) are threatened. Thus the Milky Way is called \"The Road of the Warriors\" (lit. \"Road of Armies\") . The stars are sparks from their horseshoes.\n\nTo the Māori the Milky Way is the waka (canoe) of Tama-rereti. The front and back of the canoe are Orion and Scorpius, while the Southern Cross and the Pointers are the anchor and rope. According to legend, when Tama-rereti took his canoe out onto a lake, he found himself far from home as night was falling. There were no stars at this time and in the darkness the Taniwha would attack and eat people. So Tama-rereti sailed his canoe along the river that emptied into the heavens (to cause rain) and scattered shiny pebbles from the lakeshore into the sky. The sky god, Ranginui, was pleased by this action and placed the canoe into the sky as well as a reminder of how the stars were made.\n\nThe Kaurna Aboriginal People of the Adelaide Plains in South Australia see the band of the Milky Way as a river in the skyworld. They called it Wodliparri (wodli = hut, house, parri = river) and believe that positioned along the river are a number of dwellings. In addition, the dark patches mark the dwelling place of a dangerous creature known as a \"yura\"; the Kaurna call these patches Yurakauwe, which literally means \"monster water.\" Moreover, Aboriginal Groups from the Cape York region of Queensland see the band of light as termites that had been blown into the sky by the ancestral hero Burbuk Boon. Further south the band of stars that comprise the Milky Way are seen as thousands of flying foxes carrying away a dancer known as Purupriggie.\n\nIn addition, the Aranda who come from central Australia see the band of the Milky Way as a river or creek in the skyworld. This stellar river separates the two great camps of the Aranda and Luritja People. The stars to the east of this river represent the camps of the Aranda and the stars to the west represent Luritja encampments and some stars closer to the band represent a mixture of both.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "973943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=973943", "title": "Oldies", "text": "Oldies\n\nOldies is a radio format that concentrates on rock and roll and pop music from the latter half of the 20th century, specifically from around the mid-1950s to the 1970s or 1980s.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, \"oldies\" meant the 15 years from the birth of rock and roll to the beginning of the singer-songwriter era of the early 1970s, or about 1955 to 1972, although this varied and some stations chose 1950–1969.\nAfter 2000, 1970s music was increasingly included, and early 1980s music is beginning to also be called \"oldies\", though the term \"classic hits\" is used to distinguish the \"new\" oldies (the Generation X oldies) from the \"old\" oldies (the Baby Boomer oldies).\n\nOldies tunes are typically from R&B, pop and rock music genres. Country, jazz, classical music, and other formats are generally not considered oldies music, although some of those genres have their own oldies format (for instance, classic country), and a number of songs \"crossed over\" from country to Top 40. Occasionally the term is used to describe the rare station that includes 1940s music as well, although music from before 1955 (coinciding with the \"birth of rock'n'roll\") is typically the domain of the adult standards format. However, the term constitutes ambiguity for people who like old dancing music.\n\nThis format is sometimes called Golden Oldies (after another album series of the same name, which was sold through bulk TV commercials), though this term usually refers to music exclusively from the 1950s and 1960s. Oldies radio typically features artists such as Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, The Beatles, The Beach Boys, The Animals, The Four Seasons, and Sam Cooke; as well as such musical movements and genres as early rock and roll, rockabilly, doo-wop, soul music, Motown, British Invasion, early girl groups, surf music, teen idol singers, teenage tragedy songs, and bubblegum pop. One notable omission from most oldies playlists is the music of the folk revival of the early 1960s.\n\nMost traditional oldies stations limit their on-air playlists to no more than 300 songs, based on the programming strategy that average listeners and passive listeners will stay tuned provided they are familiar with the hits being played. A drawback to this concept is the constant heavy rotation and repetition of the station's program library, as well as rejection of the format by active listeners. This can be avoided either through the use of a broader playlist or by rotating different songs from the oldies era into and out of the playlist every few weeks. The oldies format has an inherent advantage over current-music formats in that it can draw popular songs from a broad period of over a decade and is not bound to devote the majority of its spins to a single top 40 playlist as current stations are.\n\nOldies has some overlap with the classic rock format, which concentrates on the rock music of the late-1960s and 1970s and sometimes plays newer material made in the same style as the older songs. Traditionally, classic rock focuses on the heavier rock music of the era while oldies focuses on the lighter pop music.\n\nOldies stations as they are known today did not come into existence until the early 1970s. In the 1970s, KOOL-FM in Phoenix, Arizona became one of the first radio stations to play oldies music, at that time focusing on the 1950s and early 1960s. KOOL is still playing oldies today.\n\nIn the 1960s, very few Top 40 Radio stations played anything older than a few years old. In the late 1960s, a few FM stations adopted Top 40 formats that leaned towards adults who did not want to hear the same 30 songs over and over again but also did not want to hear easy listening music featured on MOR radio stations. They mixed in oldies with their current product and played new music only several times per hour. These radio stations were often referred to as \"Golden\" or \"Solid Gold\" stations. Some AM radio stations also began to employ this format. There were also syndicated music format packages such as Drake-Chenault's \"Solid Gold\" format, frequently used on FM stations that needed separate programming from their AM sisters due to the new FCC rules on simulcasting, that functioned as a hybrid of oldies and the adult-oriented softer rock hits of the day. The popularity of the movie \"American Graffiti\" is often credited with helping to spur the 1950s nostalgia movement of the early 1970s, and it was out of this 1950s nostalgia movement that some of these stations, such as WHND/WHNE \"Honey Radio\" in Detroit, WCBS-FM in New York, WQSR Baltimore, and WROR in Boston, sprang up and were classified as Oldies stations and not Adult Top 40 stations. These stations, however, did play current product sparingly (one or two per hour) throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s; WCBS-FM, for example, played current hits under the moniker \"Future Gold\" as late as the late 1980s, and WLNG on nearby Long Island featured a roughly 50/50 mix of current hits and oldies from the early 1960s until about 1999. WGAR in Cleveland and KRLA 1110 in Los Angeles were other examples of Top 40 stations with heavy oldies orientations; KRLA was in fact promoted in the 1970s as the \"Elvis-to-Elton\" station.\n\nMost of these \"Solid Gold\" stations began to either evolve into other formats or abruptly drop the format altogether from the late 1970s to early 1980s. Most AM solid Gold stations simply flipped to other formats. Some FM stations evolved into Adult Contemporary stations such as WROR Boston, WFYR Chicago, for example. Other FM stations simply moved into other formats like Rock, Top 40, Urban, or Country. In the early 1980s many Adult Contemporary stations began mixing in more oldies into regular rotation. Many of these stations had oldies shows on Saturday nights.\n\nGradually, beginning in 1982, both AM and FM stations began flipping to a full-time oldies format playing \"All Oldies All The Time\". These stations played strictly music from 1955 to 1973 focusing on the 1964 to 1969 era. By the mid to late 1980s stations like WDRC-FM Hartford, WODS Boston, WOGL Philadelphia, KLUV Dallas, 970AM WWSW Pittsburgh, WJMK Chicago, 1050AM CHUM Toronto, and many others had sprung up. Some had as few as 300 songs while stations like WODS and WOGL had as many as 1,500 songs in regular rotation. By 1989, most large and medium markets had at least one Oldies station. By 1990, most were on FM.\n\nThis period also saw the rise of syndicated radio shows specifically aimed at an oldies format. They included \"Soundtrack Of the 60s\" with Murray the K, \"Dick Clark's Rock, Roll & Remember\", \"Live From the 60s with the Real Don Steele\", \"Cruisin America With Cousin Brucie\", and \"American Gold with Dick Bartley\". Most of these shows were three hours in length and featured much of the same music from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s that was in rotation at affiliate stations. All but a few of these shows had ended their run by the mid-1990s, though Bartley's show remains on air (now focusing on the 1970s and 1980s) while Clark's and Steele's can still be heard in reruns.\n\nFrom 1986 to 1990 several solid gold stations evolved into full-time oldies stations by eliminating current and recent product, gradually eliminating 1980s songs, and even limited 1970s songs severely. KRTH and WQSR both did this in the late 1980s into the early 1990s. WCBS-FM however continued playing current product in regular rotation until 1988. After that, they continued playing it once an hour between 11 p.m. and 5:30 a.m. until 2001. WCBS-FM also played several 1990s songs per shift during these overnight hours. They also continued to play between one 1980s song every couple hours to as many as two per hour day and night. WCBS-FM also played from three to five songs per hour from the 1970s. They indeed played more 1970s music than any other notable oldies station. At the same time, WCBS-FM featured slightly more pre 1964 songs than the average station playing as many as five of those per hour.\n\nOldies stations continued to be late 1960s based throughout the 1990s. WCBS-FM was an exception. Most AM oldies stations also disappeared by the early 1990s except in markets where there was no FM oldies outlet. The format fared well with no end in sight.\n\nIn 2000, oldies stations began to notice their demographics were getting older and harder to sell. Still, at that time few stations dumped the format altogether. A few (such as Orlando's WOCL) went for a flavor-of-the-month format called \"Jammin' Oldies\". But most continued to hang onto the format initially.\n\nSince 2000, stations have begun to limit selections from the 1950s and early 1960s. At the same time these stations began playing songs from as late as 1979 and even a few 1980s songs. WCBS-FM New York slightly cut back on the pre-1964 oldies and slightly increased the 1970s and 1980s songs early in 2001. They also eliminated the overnight currents and recurrents at the same time along with some specialty shows.\n\nIn 2002, many oldies stations began dropping pre-1964 music from their playlists, since the earlier music tended to appeal to an older demographic that advertisers found undesirable—hence, the addition of music from the 1970s and early 1980s. WCBS-FM canceled their \"Doo Wop Shop\" program and began playing only one pre-1964 oldie per hour; by 2003, there were fewer than 50 songs from the 1950s and early 1960s in the regular rotation. Many other oldies stations eliminated their early rock-era catalog altogether, and rare exceptions included mainstay songs such as \"Louie Louie\" by The Kingsmen and \"Stand by Me\" by Ben E. King.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2006, many FM oldies stations—including KRTH, WOGL and KLUV—evolved into classic hits, classic rock, or gold-based adult contemporary formats (e.g. WHTT in Buffalo, New York). Others simply dumped the format altogether.\n\nThe changes in selection have created some confusion over the definition of \"oldies\", while many stations have adjusted their logos to accommodate their new formats. Stations that continue to use the term \"oldies\" in their on-air positioning generally do not play music made after 1979 (with some exceptions) and still may play one pre-1964 oldie an hour. Still, that is not always true. But most stations that do play post-1975 music have generally dropped the word \"oldies\" from their positioners, using identifiers such as \"Super Hits\", \"Classic Top 40\" or \"The Greatest Hits of All Time\" (a la WRIT in Milwaukee, KLUV in Dallas/Fort Worth, WRBQ-FM (Q-105) in Tampa) or \"Classic Gold\" (a la the former format of CFCO in Chatham, Ontario, which has since switched to country music, or the now-defunct \"Classic Gold\" oldies-radio network in the United Kingdom). Many such as WODS, KLDE, and WWBB said \"Greatest Hits of the 60s and 70s\". WSRZ-FM in Sarasota, Florida dropped their \"Oldies 108\" advertising nomenclature in favor of \"Your Home Town Station\" while expanding their playlist up to 1980. They still have their \"Cruise In\" segment for late 1950s and early 1960s music. KQQL in Minneapolis – St. Paul and WLDE in Fort Wayne, Indiana, are two other examples of oldies stations which have relegated early and mid-1960s music to weekend specialty shows.\n\nIn 2003, Clear Channel's WSAI launched the first \"Real Oldies\" branded station. It was created by Programmer Dan Allen and featured mostly the songs from the beginning of rock through the Summer of Love, 1967. It was a recreation of the WSAI that dominated Cincinnati ratings in the 1960s and early 1970s and returned original WSAI DJs to the air, such as Dusty Rhodes, Jack Stahl, Ted McAllister and Casey Piotrowski. Unlike the 300 songs normally played, the Real Oldies format featured a very wide playlist and spawned clones all around the country. Soon, other radio stations such as WWKB in Buffalo, WCOL in Columbus, and WRLL in Chicago adopted the \"Real Oldies\" moniker. Most of these \"Real Oldies\" stations were on the AM dial and featured legendary personalities from the 1960s–1970s golden Top 40 era (for example, WLS legend Larry Lujack was part of the WRLL air staff). The \"real oldies\" format mostly faded in popularity from 2004 to 2006 as less expensive formats, including satellite-fed progressive talk radio, became more attractive to station operators who began reducing their investments into AM radio stations. A handful of stations remain. Clear Channel has maintained the Real Oldies format on Iheartradio.com with Dan Allen programming and hosting along with two other WSAI personalities, Bobby Leach and Marty Thompson. It is also available on AM and FMHD2 stations in Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, Binghamton, Albany, Portland, Oregon, and Waco.\n\nVeteran New York radio programmer Scott Shannon developed a format known as the \"True Oldies Channel,\" distributed via satellite by ABC Radio, which features some of the music featured on \"Real Oldies\" stations as well as hits of the 1960s and very early 1970s, but generally nothing after 1975. The most high-profile \"True Oldies Channel\" affiliate is probably WLS-FM in Chicago, which adopted the \"True Oldies\" approach in the wake of WJMK's change to Jack FM. However, WLS-FM has slowly been adding more local personalities (including veteran radio personalities Greg Brown and Dick Biondi), and now only airs 'True Oldies' from 10am-3pm weekdays, overnights, and weekends. WIFO-FM Jesup, Georgia airs the True Oldies Channel during weekends as a contrast to its normal weekday country programming, and it is well received. True Oldies has also evolved to include more 1970s music and less pre-1964 product, and at times plays 1980s material, despite initial promises to the contrary.\n\nMany stations have since dropped the oldies format because of low ad revenue despite high ratings. On June 3, 2005, New York's WCBS-FM, an oldies-based station for over three decades, abruptly switched to the Jack FM format, resulting in a tremendous outcry from oldies fans in the Big Apple and a huge decline in revenue followed. WJMK in Chicago (WCBS-FM's sister station) switched to Jack FM on the same day. Some point to the demise of WCBS-FM and WJMK as a sign that the oldies format is in danger, for many of the same reasons that the adult standards and smooth jazz formats are disappearing. However, WJMK had been struggling for many years, and was in much worse shape than most other major-market oldies stations. In addition, unlike New York City (with the possible exception of WMTR (AM) in nearby New Jersey), the Chicago market has not technically been without an oldies station since, due to the existence of the aforementioned WRLL and now WLS-FM.\n\nYet another reason for the discontinuance of oldies stations in recent years is the attraction of a more lucrative format as an attempt to lure younger listeners. In 2001, Baltimore's WQSR (105.7 FM) and WXYV (102.7 FM) swapped frequencies, with WXYV being flipped from CHR/Top-40 to hip hop at the same time, and WQSR retaining its oldies format. These two stations have since changed formats again, with 105.7 going to talk and eventually to sports radio, and 102.7 being a Jack FM station. In 2004, WWMG (\"Magic 96.1\") in Charlotte, North Carolina, switched to a Rhythmic CHR format and was renamed \"96.1 The Beat\". A new oldies station, nicknamed \"Oldies 106.1\" and carrying the WOLS callsign, was created to serve the Charlotte area, but has since been flipped to Spanish-language programming.\n\nThe oldies format returned to WCBS-FM on July 12, 2007 in an updated form featuring music from 1964 to 1989 (and without the word \"Oldies\", but rather \"Greatest Hits\" in the on-air positioning), with songs such as \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" by Cyndi Lauper, \"Gloria\" by Laura Branigan, and \"We Built This City\" by Starship in rotation (though the original WCBS-FM played current hits mixed in with its oldies as late as the late 1980s and the three songs mentioned here during most of their years). Also included on the returning format were a selected number of classic oldies from the pre-1964 period. The resurrected WCBS-FM has been well received. Still, WCBS-FM is positioned as \"Classic Hits\" rather than oldies. Since 2017, the station has focused on hits of the 1970s to the 1990s, having gradually decreased the number of 1960s songs on its playlist while increasing the number of 1980s and 1990s hits it plays.\n\nAfter spending almost six years as Jack FM, WJMK reverted to its oldies format in an updated form on March 14, 2011. Much like New York sister WCBS-FM, the updated playlist was broader in time range, featuring music from the early 1960s to the late 1980s. In addition, the format is positioned on-air as \"The Greatest Hits of the 60s, 70s and 80s\" rather than \"Oldies\". WJMK's reversion to the previous classic hits format it dropped in 2005 resulted in a significant increase in ratings from its previous \"Jack FM\" format, whose ratings began to struggle after WILV (now WSHE-FM) debuted a 1980s-shifted adult hits format.\n\nBy the mid-2010s, as the phrase \"classic hits\" came to entail a format centered around late 1970s (disco-era) and 1980s pop, dance and rock format, the phrase \"oldies\" had come to entail a 1960s to mid-1970s format that centered mostly on soft rock and easy listening, examples including WRME-LP in Chicago.\n\nThe oldies format remains one of the most popular formats on radio in markets where it is still active. Some of the most successful major-market oldies stations today really lean towards the Classic Hits format and include KRTH \"K-Earth 101\" in Los Angeles, XHPRS-FM \"105.7 the Walrus\" in Tijuana-San Diego, KOLA 99.9 in Riverside-San Bernardino, 98.1 WOGL in Philadelphia, WMJI \"Majic 105.7\" in Cleveland, and KLUV in Dallas. WLS-FM in Chicago, however is similar to the way oldies stations sounded several years back. They still play one or two pre-1964 songs an hour during the day and as many as 4 an hour at night. However, to illustrate the continued decline in the format, San Francisco's KFRC moved toward Classic Hits in 2005 and dropped this format entirely in 2006 in favor of the Rhythmic AC \"MOViN\" format which left most of Northern California without an oldies station until the debut of KCCL (K-Hits 92.1) in Sacramento in January 2007. (However, KFRC had already evolved its format and positioning to classic hits at the time it changed to \"Movin\".) But KFRC was not gone for long. On May 17, 2007 with Free FM hot talk format failing on 106.9 KIFR CBS relaunched KFRC with a rock leaning classic hits format on 106.9. But KFRC was not back for long either. On October 27, 2008, 106.9 KFRC FM became an all news 740 KCBS AM simulcast. KFRC now only airs on 106.9 FM HD-2 and online at KFRC.com. But KFRC came back again. On January 1, 2009, KFRC returned on the radio at 1550 AM, as true oldies.\n\nKZQZ, which airs in St. Louis, Missouri and began playing oldies in March 2008, has held onto the traditional oldies format, playing a wide variety of top 40 Billboard hits from the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s.\n\nNon-commercial WXRB, 95.1 FM in Dudley, Massachusetts (one of the very first non-commercial all-oldies stations in North America) began playing Golden Oldies on March 6, 2005 at 1:00 PM, focusing on the years 1954 through 1979.\n\nOn August 27, 2009, Grand Rapids, Michigan station WGVU became the first public radio station to feature an all-oldies format. The format has since been imitated by other public radio stations; for example, WCNY-FM in Syracuse, New York has begun broadcasting a personality-based oldies format on its HD Radio digital subchannel.\n\nJones Radio Networks, Waitt Radio Networks and Transtar Radio Networks also offered 24-hour satellite-distributed oldies formats; since those companies have integrated into the Dial Global corporation, the networks have merged into one, Kool Gold. Satellite Music Network offered \"Oldies Radio;\" Oldies Radio survived until its acquisition by ABC but has since rebranded as Classic Hits Radio under current owner Cumulus Media Networks, focusing on music primarily from the 1970s and 1980s, with some limited 1960s music.\n\nABC also offered The True Oldies Channel, a 24-hour oldies network programmed and voice tracked at all hours by Scott Shannon, at the time morning show host at ABC's WPLJ. The True Oldies Channel was conceived on the concept of avoiding the drift into 1970s and 1980s music that the oldies format was undergoing in the first years of the 21st century. Eventually, by the end of the network's terrestrial run in 2014, it had taken a hybrid approach, with both 1960s and 1970s music being featured at the core of the network, with some limited 1980s music included.\n\nIn North America, satellite radio broadcasters XM and Sirius launched in 2001 and 2002, respectively, with more than a dozen oldies radio channels, with XM offering separate stations for each decade from the 1940s to the 1990s, and Sirius doing the same for the 1950s through the 1980s. These companies also offered specific genre channels for disco and dance hits, garage rock, classic rock, classic country, and vintage R&B and soul hits. These pay radio channels boasted thousands of songs in their libraries, ensuring far less repetition than traditional broadcast stations. (In November 2008, following a merger of Sirius and XM, the two services shifted to a unified group of \"decades\" channels, with the playlists for most cut back to reflect a more conventional style of oldies programming.) Music Choice similarly offers an interruption-free oldies station (which covers the 1950s and 1960s, primarily from the rock and roll era) as well as decades channels for the 1970s through the 1990s. A number of Internet radio stations also carry the format.\n\nA variation on the oldies theme is classic hits, which provides most of the playlist of oldies with some classic rock with an addition of contemporaneous R&B and pop hits as well, striking a balance between the mostly 1970s-focused classic rock genre and the more broad-based oldies format. The evolution of oldies into classic hits is an example of channel drift.\n\n"}

It was released as the second single from the album on 5 November 2001, by One Little Indian Records.\n\nThe single peaked at number 38 in the UK and number 15 in Canada.\n\nIt was written and produced by Björk with additional production by Marius de Vries and mixed by Mark \"Spike\" Stent. The music box adaptation, featured in the song, was done by Jack Perron and the full version was later featured as a B-side song on the \"Cocoon\" single.\n\nHeather Phares of AllMusic said of \"Pagan Poetry\" that it \"shares a spacious serenity with the album's quietest moments\" and included this song as a track pick. \"Rolling Stone\" said, \"In 'Pagan Poetry', she deploys the implied heaven of Zeena Parkins harp and a flotilla of music boxes with an Asian-teahouse touch\". \"Blender\" said \"'Pagan Poetry' sounds like the prelude to a particularly exotic sexual interlude\". Saul Campbell from \"7\" magazine called the track \"terrifying\" and an album standout.\n\nIn March 2006, on the Spanish edition of \"Rolling Stone\", \"Pagan Poetry\" was ranked number 38 by Spanish music professionals and experts on a list of the best songs of the 21st century. \"Pitchfork\" placed the song at number 227 on its list of \"The Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s\".\n\nThe accompanying music video for \"Pagan Poetry\" was directed by Nick Knight, who had previously photographed the cover image for her third studio album \"Homogenic\" (1997). The video is described as being about \"a woman preparing herself for marriage and for her lover\". It features highly blurry and stylized images of explicit sex from Björk's personal footage, including fellatio and ejaculation, and images of large needles sewing pearls to skin. The second half of the video features Björk in a dress designed by Alexander McQueen, which covers only the lower portion of her body. The upper portion of the dress consists of pearls piercing her skin, which is shown throughout the first half. The video ends with a shot of a Corset piercing.\n\nThe video had three stages of shooting: a video shoot of piercings, a private video shoot handled by Björk, and a film shoot of Björk. The piercings video and film shoot were done in a day in June 2001 in Knight's studio in London. The sole light source was diffused sunlight shining through the ceiling windows of the second floor daylight studio. This studio gave a \"northlight\" look and had a rawness to it that matched the subject matter, photography director Simon Chaudoir said.\n\nFive young women who were into subculture and piercings were cast for the video. Knight directed Chaudoir to shoot the piercings by placing the Sony Mini DV camera on the women's bodies—mostly chests, arms, and shoulders—and getting as physically near as he could while maintaining a close, macro focus on a wide-angle lens. A nurse and piercing unit were on hand, but no thimble, so the bleeding most often came from cast girls' thumbs as they pushed the needles in. \"It was one of the most difficult things I've ever filmed because I felt I was on the verge of throwing up. I liked to actually only watch it by the video monitor rather than with my eyes as it were because it was just too much\", Chaudoir said. Björk also pierced her own ear at the shoot, but all other piercings were the cast girls'. Knight gave Björk a Sony Mini DV camera and asked her to shoot her own private scenes.\nTired of music videos which featured the singer looking to the camera and lip-synching throughout, Chaudoir suggested having Björk lip-synch and look into the camera only for some of the last lines. He also suggested using a track so they could move closer to her as she sings these lines or move closer before she sings them—\"so it's like a reveal of her\", he said. There was no script, so some improvisation made it to the final cut. Since blue-screening and CGI work were not involved, Chaudoir did not use diffusion or consulted with post-production, and he arrived with only a few assistants—a gaffer, loader, grip, focus puller, and some electricians. \"Basically what I was asked to do and what I thought I'd be able to do is more or less there. It would have benefited from being simplified down to a much more bold and direct visualization of what she was trying to do. I think we were too subtle in that\", Knight said.\n\nThe video was banned by MTV in the United States, but was eventually shown in unedited form on MTV2 in a presentation of the \"20 Most Controversial Music Videos\". The music video was placed sixth on the \"20 Of The Most Controversial Music Videos Ever\" list by \"NME\", which described it as \"scarier than her dead swan dress or when she punched that photographer\". It was also included on the list by \"Rolling Stone\", \"The 15 Most NSFW Music Videos of All Time\", and was considered by \"Slant\" the sixth best music video by Björk. The dress was shown in Björk's MoMA retrospective in 2015. It was sold as part of Kerry Taylor Auctions \"Passion for Fashion\" sale in London, in June 2016.\n\nIn 2001, Björk performed \"Pagan Poetry\" on the \"Late Night with David Letterman\" with a Greenland women's choir, harpist and electronica duo Matmos.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its splash screen shows Gorbachev and the Kremlin, the seat of Soviet government. The splash screen includes imagery suggestive of crumbling masonry, perhaps symbolizing the deterioration of public infrastructure in the twilight years of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe game consists of controlling a small frog-like creature which jumps from one lily pad to another, trying to collect dots in four colours symbolizing grocery goods, currency transactions, progressive taxes and adventures and to reach a certain pad in the right-top corner of the screen. The lilies, symbolizing the ever-changing laws and acts in the USSR, constantly shrink and disappear only to appear in other places. Higher levels also feature one or more evil creatures called \"bureaucrats\" which follow the frog and try to eat it. The frog dies if the lily pad on which it is standing disappears, if the player moves it to a place where there is no lily pad, or if it is caught by a bureaucrat.\n\nPerestroika runs under DOS, and it was written in Borland C++ using the Borland Graphics Interface and has a resolution of 640×350.\n\nNikita Online released a remake of this game for Windows—Toppler for Windows—and chose the frog from the game as its logo.\n\nThe frog itself and the second game name (which is mentioned in the file name \"toppler.exe\") may be inspired by the Tower Toppler game.\n\nThe game exists also in a version for computers Sinclair ZX Spectrum and compatible. It was programmed by a Czech programmer group \"GCC\" under a Czech variant of the name Perestrojka. The producer was a company Proxima - Software, the game was published in 1992 as a part of compilation Mah Jongg.\n\nThe game also has several look-alikes in Javascript and in flash.\n\nThis games also has several remakes for mobile (smart)phones, e.g. iPhones Perestroika Revival and Toppler.\n\n"}

Players follow a pre-set path, shooting enemies and picking up optional weapons and health items, occasionally choosing between multiple paths. Using the analog stick on the Nunchuk, players can look around in a limited manner. In some cases, the Wii Remote can be used to activate melee weapons against enemies where the camera shifts to a third-person view, or use timed button presses in certain cutscenes to evade traps and enemy attacks. Each stage is split into individual chapters and contains save checkpoints at the end of each chapter. Stars are obtained at the end of each stage, based on the player's performance, which can be used to upgrade weapons. To unlock some levels and sublevels, the player needs a certain ranking, \"S\" being the best. The amount of destroyed items, obtained objects, files, critical hits and clear time affects this.\n\nUpon beating Hunk's \"4th Survivor\" mission, co-operative mode will be unlocked for the single-player missions. When selecting characters, an option will appear on the screen to select co-op mode. Both players will play as the same character, but each player will have their own aiming reticule. \n\n\"The Umbrella Chronicles\" encompasses several scenarios, which are based on various plot elements from the \"Resident Evil\" series. The game's first three scenarios, \"Train Derailment\", \"The Mansion Incident\", and \"Raccoon's Destruction\", are set within Raccoon City, or its surrounding area, in 1998. The final scenario, which is based on new material, is set in Russia, taking place in 2003. The game features nine playable characters from previous \"Resident Evil\" games, including Rebecca Chambers, Billy Coen, Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, Carlos Oliviera, Albert Wesker, Ada Wong, Richard Aiken, and Hunk. \n\nThe game's first scenario, based on the events of \"Resident Evil Zero\", follows STARS operative Rebecca Chambers, and former Marine Billy Coen as they venture through a train that eventually takes them to a derelict training facility. Once within the facility, they discover they are being stalked by James Marcus, one of the Umbrella Corporation's co-founders and former scientists, who has managed to resurrect himself with the aid of leech test-subjects. After a confrontation, Marcus mutates into a monstrosity, but is subdued by the duo. Chambers and Coen escape as the facility self-destructs. Another sub-chapter within the scenario traces Wesker's actions, now posing as the leader of STARS' Alpha team, as he attempts to escape the training facility. This chapter also introduces Sergei Vladimir and one of his bodyguard Tyrants, codenamed \"IVAN\".\n\nThe game then proceeds to retell the events of the first \"Resident Evil\". The scenario follows Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine, as opposed to the actual \"Resident Evil\" game, which features the two splitting up. Redfield and Valentine are forced to battle their way through a mansion full of undead residents before stumbling upon a secret Umbrella Corporation research facility in the mansion's basement. The two then discover the facility's most powerful creation, a Tyrant, and destroy it. The scenario features two different sub-chapters, which reveal Chambers' action between \"Resident Evil Zero\" and \"Resident Evil\", as well as Wesker's reanimation and escape after his apparent death.\n\nThe next scenario visits Raccoon City during the events of \"\". Valentine returns to the game, and is paired with mercenary Carlos Oliveira, as they attempt to survive an outbreak of the T-virus. After defeating several undead citizens, Valentine and Oliveira encounter Nemesis, an upgraded Tyrant, sent to kill Valentine. They defeat Nemesis and escape Raccoon City before it is destroyed by the United States government in a desperate contingency measure. The scenario also features two sub-chapters, detailing Ada Wong and Hunk's background roles during the main scenario's events.\n\nThe game's final scenario is composed of new material, which trails Redfield and Valentine as they and other armed anti-bioweapon activists investigate the Umbrella Corporation's final stronghold in Russia. Now leading a group of armed activists, they storm the stronghold, encountering waves of undead soldiers and mutations. Despite their force sustaining heavy casualties, Redfield and Valentine enter the facility's inner sanctum, only to encounter and destroy the Umbrella Corporation's latest creation, the T-ALOS project. The game's final sub-chapter features Wesker infiltrating the facility in an attempt to recover the Umbrella Corporation's most important files. He is confronted by his long-time nemesis, Sergei Vladimir, whom he defeats. The game's credits reveal that the Umbrella Corporation's secrets have finally been exposed. As a result, the U.S. government succeeds in its legal action against Umbrella's top officials.\n\nThe game was co-developed by Capcom and Cavia and produced by Masachika Kawata, who was behind the PlayStation 2 port of \"Resident Evil 4\". At E3 2006, Capcom officially announced that development was already underway for an exclusive \"Resident Evil\" game for the Wii and mentioned that it would take advantage of the console's unique Wii Remote controller, giving players a new experience. Members of Capcom's Clover Studio, who created such games as \"Viewtiful Joe\" and \"Ōkami\", were called upon to help develop the game.\n\nA short clip of the game was shown on the Nintendo World event on November 3, 2006, where 2007 was revealed as the release date. On April 6, 2007, the official Japanese website went live containing an official teaser video. On April 13, 2007, the official Japanese website updated with a second trailer, character profiles and screenshots. A Japan-only release of the game came with a limited edition collector's \"Biohazard\" box featuring several items. Christian Svensson, Capcom's senior director of strategic planning and research, stated the game would support 480-progressive scan and widescreen resolution. A trailer was included in the \"Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition\", which shows the mansion from the original game and areas of Raccoon City. At its pre-E3 press conference on July 11, 2007, Nintendo announced that the Wii Zapper peripheral will be compatible with the game.\n\nThe game was initially going to play similarly to \"Resident Evil 4\". However, in an interview with Famitsu, the game's producer Masachika Kawata revealed the reason for the drastic change in gameplay: according to him, \"Wii users like easiness\" and that a \"Resident Evil 4\"-style game is \"too complicated\" for Wii users to enjoy. Masachika Kawata then elaborated that \"complex operability can be an obstacle for Wii users\", and that he purposefully had to \"compromise to a lower difficulty level\" and \"reduce enthusiast-only elements\".\n\n\"Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles\" was released in late 2007. An extensive line of tie-in products was created to promote the release of Capcom's on-rails shooter and to expand its storyline. This includes a graphic novel, several spin-off novels, and an official soundtrack release.\n\nThe Resident Evil Shot Blaster is a replacement to the Wii Zapper. The gun comes with a detachable Nunchuk holster. The holster also rotates downward to allow easy reloading for in the game. When the Nunchuk holster is removed the gun becomes something like a pistol. The package also includes a decal that you can put on your Wii Remote which has a picture of characters from the game on it, and a Nunchuk joystick grip which has the logo of the Umbrella Corporation on it.\n\n\"\" was composed by Masafumi Takada and Jun Fukuda from Grasshopper Manufacture featuring Ada Wong as the cover. A CD with 49 tracks called \"Biohazard: The Umbrella Chronicles Original Sound Track\" was released in Japan on December 19. It was published by Suleputer and was distributed by Sony Music Distribution for 3150 yen. The soundtrack includes a full-color booklet. Initially produced items are limited editions with special sleeve cases.\n\nThe Wii version of \"The Umbrella Chronicles\" has received positive scores from critics. \"GamePro\" praised its unlockable secrets and satisfying gameplay, adding that \"the only downside to \"The Umbrella Chronicles\" is that longevity will be an issue.\" GameTrailers called it \"fantastic overall\" and a \"superb entry in the genre,\" praising the game for its surprising length and unlockable content, but stated that while the graphics \"look good\", they were sometimes \"a step behind\" \"Resident Evil 4\" and added that having the game on rails actually makes it scarier, and that it's \"basically a love letter\" to fans of the series. IGN praised the game for having \"amazingly cool\" design but complained about the lack of representation from \"Resident Evil 2\" and \"4\" as well as the gameplay, which they felt was too slow; on the other hand, they called the presentation \"pretty impressive\" and stated that \"there’s no denying the fun\" they had with it. GameSpot praised the easy controls and the look and feel of the game, but criticized the music, stating that \"it undermines the atmosphere,\" and that the \"on-rails shooter gameplay can still feel restrictive. 1UP.com called it \"a surprisingly meaty experience\" and \"an accessible, mostly satisfying shooter\" and praised the depth and strategy offered by the gameplay, but complained about difficult headshots and stated that \"it never really amounts to more than its concept\".\n\nThe Wii version of the game has sold over 1.4 million copies worldwide.\n\nOn March 8, 2009, Capcom announced they would have new game announcements on March 12 at the \"Resident Evil 5\" launch party in San Francisco. A few days earlier, Capcom’s Associate Product Marketing Manager, Matt Dahlgren, said in an interview that \"Nintendo Wii fans will be very happy very soon\" when asked about getting more \"Resident Evil\" on Wii. On March 11, \"Famitsu\" confirmed a sequel for \"Umbrella Chronicles\", titled \"\". The game, like its predecessor, has on-rails gameplay. \n\n"}

Instead of relying on television programming for entertainment, participants read, daydream, explore, enjoy nature, and spend time with family and friends. Over 300 million people have taken part in the turnoff, with millions participating each year.\n\nIn 2010, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC) became the home of Screen-Free Week at the request of the Board of the Center for SCREEN-TIME Awareness (CSTA), which ran the initiative since 1994 (first as TV-Free America). CCFC launched a new website and developed a new Organizer's Kit, fact sheets, and other materials for Screen-Free Week 2011 and beyond. The Screen-Free Week Organizer's Kit is available as a free download.\n\nIn 1994, the week was first championed by TV-Free America, and promoted by Adbusters magazine and other organizations. TV-Free America then became Center for SCREEN-TIME Awareness. CSTA was an organization that encouraged all people to use electronic screen media responsibly and then have more time for a healthy life and more community participation. It was a grassroots alliance of many different organizations, with participation in over 70 nations around the world. Screen Free week happens in Canada.\n\nCCFC changed the name of TV-Turnoff to Screen-Free Week in 2010, since entertainment media (and advertising) are increasingly delivered through a variety of screens (computers, hand-held devices, etc.), and not just traditional television commercials.

{"id": "1237973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1237973", "title": "Shooting range", "text": "Shooting range\n\nA shooting range, firing range or gun range is a specialized facility designed for firearms qualifications, training or practice. Shooting ranges are typically operated by military or law enforcement agencies, though the majority of ranges are privately-owned and cater to recreational shooters. Each facility is typically overseen by one or more supervisory personnel, called variously a \"range master\" or \"Range Safety Officer\" (RSO) in the US, or a \"range conducting officer\" (RCO) in the UK. Supervisory personnel are responsible for ensuring that all weapon safety rules and relevant government regulations are followed at all times.\n\nShooting ranges can be indoor or outdoor, and may be restricted to certain types of type of firearm that can be used such as handguns or rifles, or they can specialize in certain shooting sports such as skeet shooting or 10 m Air Pistol/Rifle. Most indoor ranges restrict the use of certain powerful calibers, rifles, or fully automatic weapons.\n\nA shooting gallery is a recreational shooting facility with very low-powered guns, often located within amusement parks, arcades, carnivals or fairgrounds that provides games and entertainments for the visiting crowd.\n\nIn urban areas, most shooting ranges will be at indoor facilities. Indoor ranges offer protection from inclement weather conditions and can be operated around the clock under controlled environmental conditions. Outdoor shooting ranges are typically found away from populated areas because of concerns about safety, noise pollution and soil contamination.\n\nIndoor firing ranges are usually constructed as standalone structures, though they may be housed in larger buildings in basement or such. The basic components of most indoor firing ranges consist of firing lines/lanes, targets and a bullet trap/\"backstop\". Design considerations may vary depending on planned use but they all must address the basic requirements for operating the range safely, and that is provide ballistic protection, safety controls, proper ventilation, acoustic isolation and appropriate lighting. \n\nFiring range walls are usually constructed of poured concrete, precast concrete, or masonry block. The walls must be impenetrable and provide adequate ballistic protection from stray bullets and back splatter. Floors are constructed from dense reinforced concrete with a smooth surface finish. Floors are usually slanted slightly from uprange (shooting lanes) toward the bullet trap downrange to allow for better maintenance and cleaning.\n\nIndoor firing range roofs are constructed from steel joists or precast concrete panels with a smooth flat surface that will redirect misfired bullets, facilitate maintenance, and prevent lead buildup. Roof baffles are installed at a 25–30 degree angle protect ceilings, lighting fixtures, ventilation ducts, and any other unprotected element from stray bullets. Baffles are typically constructed of armored plate steel covered with fire-rated plywood. Deflectors are similar to baffles, but are not usually covered with plywood; they can be installed either vertically or horizontally and are used to redirect stray bullets from unprotected fixtures and elements inside the firing range such as doors, windows, and ventilation registers. Shields are constructed of plate steel and plywood.\n\nControl rooms or stations houses the central controls for the firing range equipment, communication, lights, and security. The controls are operated by the range master–the designated official responsible for range operation and management. The control station must provide the range master with unobstructed line of sight of the firing lanes and all shooters. Control stations are usually constructed of concrete blocks with bulletproof observation windows.\n\nBackstops and bullet traps are used to absorb the energy from the bullet and capture it to prevent overflight beyond the range area. Bullet traps come in a variety of designs and are usually constructed of impenetrable metal plates. The thickness of the plates and the materials used depend on the velocity and energy levels of the projectiles to be fired in the range. Most modern traps consist of angled hardened steel plates that deflect the bullets into other metal plates to remove their energy. The plates must be resistant to penetration, abrasion and metal fatigue. The traps direct the spent bullets to a collection area in front of the trap or, for high-energy projectiles, at the back of the trap.\n\nMany indoor firing ranges provide additional spaces such as a cleaning room for weapons, a classroom, restrooms (including shower facilities), office areas, lounge area, or storage and maintenance rooms. Passageways are used to physically isolate the firing range from the adjoining areas.\n\nSome firing ranges are equipped with shooting booths to provide shooters with a defined firing area and to reduce potential hazard from misfires and ejected bullet cartridges from adjacent shooters. Shooting booths are made of partitions or panels which can be acoustically treated to reduce the effect of weapons discharge on other shooters. The booths are sometimes equipped with communication or target-operation equipment; target or booth lighting controls; shelves for holding weapons and bullets, or to prevent shooters from going downrange; and equipment for practicing shooting from behind a barrier. The firing line, usually marked red or orange, runs along the downrange edge of the shooting booths. Some ranges have motion detectors that can set off an alarm when a shooter passes this line during shooting. \n\nTarget systems consist of a target, a target carrier system, and a target control system. Targets for indoor firing ranges are usually a paper sheet or piece of corrugated cardboard with a printed target image on the sheet. The target carrier system allows the firing range to operate more efficiently and safely by transporting the target and frame between the firing line and the target line, in both downrange and uprange directions. The target control system allows the range master to control the operation and movement of the targets through a central control station in the control booth. Some firing ranges provide local control modules that can be operated in the shooting booths.\n\nA critical component in the design and proper operation of an indoor firing ranges is the ventilation system. Proper ventilation reduces shooters’ exposure to airborne lead particles and other combustion byproducts. Ventilation systems consist of supply and exhaust air systems and associated ductwork. Supply air can be provided through a perforated wall plenum or radial air diffusers mounted at ceiling height. Airflow along the firing line should be no more than 0.38 m/s (75 feet per minute, fpm) with a minimum acceptable flow of 0.25 m/s (50 fpm). Air is typically exhausted at or behind the bullet trap. Some firing ranges are designed to have multiple exhaust points downrange to maintain downrange flow and desired velocities at the firing line. The exhaust system should be designed to provide minimum duct air velocities of 12.70 – 15.24 m/s (2,500 – 3,000 fpm).. The equipment and designs for the ventilation systems are varied, most firing ranges have one supply and one exhaust fan, however, some have multiple supply or exhaust fans. Very often, the air-flow rate required by the firing range and space constraints for the fans dictate the number and types of fans. Most firing ranges have systems that supply 100% outside air to the firing range and exhaust all of the air to outside the building; but, some firing range ventilation systems are designed to recirculate some of the exhaust air to the supply air system to conserve energy especially in extreme climates. The exhaust air is always filtered before being exhausted outside the building or recirculated to the supply system.\n\nLighting in the range consists of control booth, uprange area, shooting booth, and downrange lighting systems. Control booth lighting is usually manually controlled and consists of general lighting and low-level lighting used during particular shooting conditions. Lighting uprange of the booths is general ceiling-level lighting and can usually be controlled manually or from the central controls. Lights downrange of the firing line are usually spotlights used to illuminate the targets at various distances downrange of the booths.\n\nSafety control systems are installed to protect the shooters during range malfunction or emergency situations. Such systems may include warning lights, alarm bells, and air-flow and filtration monitors.\n\nOutdoor shooting ranges are used for longer-distance shooting up to or exceeding . Training might also specifically require exposure to the elements such as wind or rain. Outdoor competition shooting is preferred under benign weather conditions, although conditions may change, competition is only abandoned when safety becomes an issue.\n\nOutdoor shooting ranges are designed to contain all fired shots. This necessitates a high retaining wall behind the target line called a back-stop or stop-butt, comprising an earth mound, sandbag barrier or specially designed funnel-shaped traps to catch and prevent misaligned shots, errant projectile ricochets, or shots going beyond the bounds of the shooting range. Most outdoor ranges restrict the maximum caliber size and/or projectile energy based on the design specification of the range. Some target-shooting ranges have separate facilities devoted to the use of higher-powered firearms such as .50 caliber.\n\nOutdoor ranges may be partially enclosed and so have some features in common with indoor ranges, for example the British Armed Forces barrack range has a roofed firing point and normally has 360° walls. As its name suggests, it is generally found in military bases rather than in the more remote areas common to outdoor ranges. \n\nSeveral studies of outdoor firing ranges have shown that exposure to lead and noise can cause health problems, particularly among employees and instructors. \n\nOutdoor ranges need less cleaning and maintenance than indoor ranges. However, despite the natural ventilation of outdoor firing ranges, some outdoor ranges have ballistic baffles overhead, and concrete walls and structures on the sides that can cause the air to stagnate and lead to increase exposure to lead and noise. \n\nConsequently, operators of ranges might consider adding sound transmission barriers, absorptive materials, and natural vegetation to lessen noise emission. Fans pointing downrange can provide air movement away from shooters to lessen lead exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe firing point normally is at a defined point on the ground, and on a civilian range will usually be level and flat. Outdoor ranges without a covered firing point are usually grass, often on a slightly raised, flattened mound. Outdoor ranges with a covered firing point are usually concrete or tarmacadam. Outdoor military range firing points are not usually covered and may have other configurations, e.g., sloping, a gravel base or hole in the ground.\n\nA \"fixed firing point\" or echelon rifle range is where the targets are located at the various distances with the marksman or woman shooting from the one firing point. The most advanced rifle range of this design was constructed for the Commonwealth Games New Delhi 2010.\n\nThe firing point cover can be as simple as a tent, to a frame with only a roof (to keep off rain or sunshine) to a substantial building with appropriate apertures to shoot through.\n\nCivilian targets are usually made of paper or a plastic coreflute, sometimes with a canvas or hessian back on the larger long-range types. Most competitive targets are a solid black circle on a white background. The black circle may have scoring rings. Targets of other shapes may be used such as used in pistol (hand gun) target shooting. Reactive targets allow shooters to easily identify bullet strikes. This allows shooters to improve their skills by quickly being able to compare their aiming point and where the actual bullet impacted the target.\n\nThose who choose to use military surplus rifles in competition on firing ranges at set distances include bolt and semiautomatic actions, with targets used as per military standards, current and historic. The same applies for the matches they shoot. Other target types include a metal plate that is knocked over by the bullet such as in the air rifle sport of field target or handgun discipline of IPSC, and stationary metal plates of scaled animal outlines on which bullet strikes mark as well as those that mark the paint which is painted over again after scoring.\n\nThe butts / backstop is the area behind the target into which the shot impacts having passed through the target. Outdoor and sometimes indoor ranges have earth or sand butts. Indoor ranges can use angled plates with collectors, often with a rubber curtain through which the bullet passes and is then stopped by a metal plate.\n\nRanges without automatic target placements sometimes have concrete trenches where personnel lift and retract, mark and replace targets.\n\nThey need to be of sufficient height to capture the projectile intended for the target as well as any ricochet that may occur from the projectile striking the floor of the target range fairway. Usually the top is at least five degrees in elevation from the 100m firing line.\n\nOutdoor shooting ranges sometimes have wind flags, positioned between the firing line (where the shooters are) and the targets. Shooters observe these flags to make an estimate of wind speed, which is then converted into lateral minute of angle point of aim corrections or, alternatively, windage holdoff corrections.\n\nThe flag method is the most common method used to estimate wind speed. A flag blowing in the wind will naturally blow away from the flagpole, with the angle of the bottom of the flag to the flagpole increasing with increasing windspeed. To estimate the wind speed in mph, the angle in degrees between the bottom of the flag to the flagpole at the mid-range position between the shooter and the target is divided by 4. For example, an angle of 60 degrees between the bottom of a flag and a flagpole would be estimated as a windspeed.\n\nThe clock method is then used to determine full value, half value, or no value corrections in minute of angle for this wind. Aligning the target at the 12 o' clock position or direction, with the 6 o' clock direction being directly behind the shooter, winds at 3 or 9 o'clock are equated to full value, winds at 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11 o'clock are equated to half value, and winds at 12 and 6 o'clock are equated to no value.\nThe minute of angle correction (full value) is then commonly estimated as ((Range [meters] / 100) × Wind [mph]) / \"C\", where \"C\" is a constant. The constant \"C\" equals 15 for ranges from 100 to 500 meters, 14 for 600 meters, 13 for 700–800 meters, 12 for 900 meters, and 11 for 1,000 meters.\nFor full-value winds, this full windage correction is used. For half-value winds, the minute of correction in windage given by this formula is halved; for no-value winds, no minute of angle correction in windage is required.\n\nMultiple flags are required for two reasons. First, the wind speed closest to the midpoint of range has the greatest effect on the projectile. In addition, the wind at one part of the range will not always be the same at another part.\n\nWind flags are not always actual flags, sometimes streamers are used, small triangle flags, or even pin wheels. Factors such as the range length and expected strength of the wind determine the best type of flag to use. When no flags are available, a small leaf or other small light object can be dropped from shoulder height, and the object is then pointed at by the shooter; the angle between his arm and his torso can provide an equivalent wind speed estimation as a wind flag, although it will not be at the mid-range location along the bullet's trajectory.\n\nOftentimes the same range is made available to both bow and gun shooters. However, there are many ranges that have been made available exclusively for archers, and thousands of them can be found in the USA. The most popular types of archery ranges include 3-D ranges, field ranges and indoor ranges.\n\nWhile some ranges require that all firearms be unloaded and variously securely encased and/or trigger-locked prior to entering, or leaving, the range facility, irrespective of whether one holds a concealed carry license in jurisdictions where concealed carry is legal, many have no such regulations.\n\nWhether indoors or outdoors, all shooters are typically required to wear eye protection as well as hearing protection (ear muffs or ear plugs) at all times when within the defined boundaries of the range. employees and users are exposed to lead dust from bullets or cartridge primers, which can be inhaled or can settle on skin or clothing. Additionally, the discharging of firearms in indoor ranges can produce noise levels of over 140 dB sound pressure level. To combat this, it is commonly recommended that those inside the range \"double up\" ear protection by using both earplugs and over-the-head earmuffs, and to protect range bystanders from sound exposure, Depending on the range, prescription eyeglasses may qualify as eye protection. Indoor ranges can be particularly unsafe, due to high lead exposures and increased noise exposures where the design or management is not of a quality conducive to best practice.\n\nThe National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health issued an Alert, that presents five case reports documenting lead and noise exposures, and examines firing range operations, exposure assessment and control methods, existing regulations, and exposure standards and guidelines. More information about reducing occupational exposures at indoor firing ranges can be found at NIOSH Firing Range topic page\n\nIn 2013, The National Academy of Sciences published a report titled Potential Health Risks to DOD FIRING-RANGE PERSONNEL from Recurrent Lead Exposure. The report highlighted the shortcomings of current occupational lead exposure standards and urged The Department of Defense to update its guidelines and practices for protecting workers from lead exposure on firing ranges.\n\nSafety areas are own places on shooting ranges where a small bay with a safe direction is set up for shooters to be able to handle unloaded firearms without the supervision of a Range Officer (RO). Safety areas are widely used in dynamic shooting sport disciplines and PPC 1500, and may for example be used to pack, unpack or holster a gun, cleaning or repair, dry firing and training with empty magazines.\n\nThese will vary from country to country, and even within a country. In some countries, no license or advanced training beyond just gun familiarization (for rental guns) and range rules familiarization is required for using a shooting range. In other countries, participants must be part of an organized club and must hold licenses for ownership of individual firearms. A common requirement is that the shooter must be of legal age (or have a guardian present) prior to shooting.\n\nIn the United States, training classes for a concealed carry license are often available at shooting ranges.\n\nMany target shooting ranges offer services to aid both novice and expert shooters.\n\nTypically, a range will offer safety courses, concealed carry courses, and advanced training in firearms techniques, for a fee. In addition, some states in the USA require employees who use firearms on the job (e.g., armored car drivers, security guards) to have certain certifications. In most cases, a shooter may take a class and qualify for these certifications at a range.\n\nMany ranges will let shooters rent firearms, as well. In most cases, ranges (especially indoor) rent out handguns and rifles in various calibers, however there are ranges that rent Class III/NFA firearms (full-auto weapons, suppressed weapons, etc.). Some ranges offering firearms rental also provide instructors at little to no cost as part of the rental fee.\n\nThis article discusses shooting or firing ranges in a general sense.

The eligible age-range for contestants is currently 18–35 years old.\n\nIn July 2010 it was announced Network Ten had cancelled \"So You Think You Can Dance Australia\" in favour of a new musical/dancing format for 2011. However, Network Ten says they are in continual discussions with production company FremantleMedia Australia and Conrad Sewell Productions regarding the format's future. In 2011, rumors began to appear in the Australian media industry press that the series would be returned to broadcast, likely on original home network Ten. The show returned with a fourth series broadcast on Network Ten starting on 9 February 2014.\n\n These contestants are the only ones to have never been in the bottom three couples or the bottom four dancers throughout the entire season.\n\nAuditions for the first season were held during July and August 2008 in Perth, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide and Sydney. After being selected, through either an impressive initial audition or after a choreography workshop, the top 100 finalists spent a week in Sydney for more auditions, ultimately forming a Top 20. Auditions began on 9 October 2007 in Brisbane, Queensland and ended in Sydney, New South Wales on 6 November 2007. A 600-seat arena was constructed in Sydney for the finals. Jack Chambers was announced as the winner on 26 April 2008. Chambers won $200,000 prize money and the title of \"Australia's Favourite Dancer\", with Rhys Bobridge, Kate Wormald, Demi Sorono finishing in second, third, and fourth places respectively. Several finalists later performed during the 2008 \"Australian Idol\" grand final, as well as Ten's New Year's Eve broadcast.\n\nAuditions for the second season were held during September and November 2008. Dancers auditioning were requested to bring pre-approved copyright music CDs because of music licensing issues. Judges hoped that season 2 would see more industry dancers auditioning after the favourable response to the first season of the show. Repeats of the performance and results show aired a week later on MuchMusic. Talia Fowler was announced the winner on 27 April 2009. Fowler received $200,000 prize money, the title of \"Australia's Favourite Dancer\" and the opportunity to perform at the finale of America's version of So You Think You Can Dance, while Ben Veitch came 4th place, then Amy Campbell came 3rd place, while lastly Charlie Bartley was named runner-up.\n\nNigel Lythgoe and Mary Murphy made separate appearances in this season as guest judges.\n\nThe third season premiered on 31 January 2010. Robbie Kmetoni was announced the winner on 21 May 2010. Kmetoni received $200,000 prize money and the title of \"Australia's Favourite Dancer\". Furthermore, he will have the opportunity to choose from three exclusive dance contracts (including Australian Dance Theatre, Hairspray and Burn the Floor) to perform throughout Australia and overseas, While Phillipe Witana came 4th place, then Ivy Heeney came 3rd place, while lastly Robbie Kmetoni's secondary college friend Jessie Hesketh was named runner-up.\n\nIn July 2010, it was announced Network Ten would not recommission \"So You Think You Can Dance Australia\" for a 2011 season. It follows media speculation the show had been cancelled, and talks Ten had a new \"shiny floor\" format to reveal. Ten advised FremantleMedia Australia that it would opt out of format, but didn't rule out a future return. Instead Ten was to develop a local version of British talent show Don't Stop Believing, inspired by the success of Glee. \"Don't Stop Believing\" was instead to be produced by Shine Australia, which is headed by former FremantleMedia Australia executives. Plans were halted late 2010, with the show cancelled before starting.\n\nIn October 2011, Ten began airing ads for So You Think You Can Dance Australia implying it would be returning soon, but Ten were yet to release details on when. In February 2012 rumors began to emerge in the Australian media press that former \"Australia's Next Top Model\" host Sarah Murdoch had been approached to take over hosting duties for a revival of the show as Natalie Bassingthwaighte has moved on to a judging position for Australia's iteration of music talent show The X-Factor. The show was also rumored to be returning to its original network, Channel Ten. These rumors ultimately proved to be inaccurate when Ten revealed that it had engaged Murdoch to host a different dance-themed show entitled \"Everybody Dance Now\". Ultimately the show did return to broadcast on Network Ten, airing season 4 in the spring of 2014 after a four-year hiatus.\n\nThe show resumed airing on 9 February 2014 featuring a shortened format with one show broadcast a week, similar to the U.S. seasons 9 and 10. The new format also eliminated the open audition process, with the season opening at the Top 100 stage, these dancers having been selected via audition tapes and processes not portrayed in any episode, a format atypical of So You Think You Can Dance shows, which generally show the contestant selection process from earlier auditions on. The show also featured an entire change in judging cast, with Paula Abdul, Aaron Cashacting, Jason Gilkison, and Shannon Holtzapffel filling the seats of the panel, as well as a change in host, with Carrie Bickmore presenting. The fourth season concluded on Thursday, 1 May with contemporary dancers Michael Dameski and Lauren Seymour taking 1st and 2nd places respectively. To date, neither Network Ten nor the show's producers have made a statement as to whether the show will be returning for a fifth season.\n\n3 February 2008 premiere of \"So You Think You Can Dance Australia\" attracted a peak audience of 2.15 million viewers. The show was the night's top-rating program, averaging 1.83 million viewers over its timeslot. The following two audition episodes also put up respectable figures, peaking at 2.04 million and 1.94 million viewers respectively. The Sunday night Top 100 show averaged 1.6 million viewers to become the most watched program of the night.\n\nAfter its debut, the weekly performance show averaged around 1.5 million viewers. The series one finale averaged 1.8 million viewers, peaking at 2.2 million viewers nationwide. Over 50 per cent of Ten's key 18–49 age demographic had tuned into the show. In season 3, ratings further slumped to a below million average, after which the show was cancelled. Season 4's revival of the series had smaller viewership still, with most episodes pulling less than a million viewers, and several seeing viewership as low as 300,000.\n\nJason Coleman has been questioned over his position as judge on the show, with members of the dance community accusing him of being under qualified, and using incorrect jargon on the show, calling a pivot a promenade. Eliminated contestant Marko Panzic also accused Coleman of playing favourites. Critics also cite a possible conflict of interest due to Coleman's external business relationship with choreographer Kelly Aykers.\n\nColeman has responded to these criticisms, saying: \"Mate, this is just nit-picking. With this show a pivot is the same thing as a promenade. In my world it's called a promenade, in the ballroom dancing world it's called a pivot. I'm aware of the differences but I don't have time in my minute-and-a-half speech to explain that.\" In response to the Aykers issue, he said: \"Kelly Aykers has delivered three great routines. I would never put myself in a position where I would compliment a person's work because they are my friend. If the work deserves a compliment it will receive it, if it does not, it will not.\"\n\nThe show has also received criticism from the Australian dance community and mainstream media over the representation of the art of dance on the show. In one example, commentator Valerie Lawson observes that \"\"So You Think You Can Dance Australia\" goes further. Its very success ... is compromising dance as a performance art. The audience is led to believe that the most obvious effort, the most athletic of tricks, and the most vulgar of moves, represent dance at its best. As hips swivel, the studio audience cheers. When a guy lifts a girl with as much finesse as a forklift truck the audience roars its approval.\"\n\nOn two occasions the show has accidentally broadcast profanities during the PG-rated live show. On the first occasion, Ten issued an apology for a \"indistinct and muffled\" profanity uttered during the first elimination show, and promised that \"efforts [have been] redoubled to prevent such an incident happening again.\" Nonetheless, when Sermsah Bin Saad was making his speech after being eliminated, he accidentally swore on national television, saying, \"You guys are so fucking awesome!\". At that time, Sermsah didn't realise that it was on live and apologised after finding out his mistake. In this case the profane word was censored during broadcast.\n\n\n"}

Jeffries in Reno, Nevada.\n\nThe footage depicts the heavyweight championship that took place in Reno, NV on July 4, 1910, when reigning champion Jack Johnson, a black American, knocked out former champion James J. Jeffries, a white American, in the fifteenth round of a very one-sided fight. The fight was already a media sensation weeks before it happened and was dubbed \"The Fight of the Century\". This sparked motivation to film the event as it was thought to be a guaranteed money-maker. The fight's promoter, George \"Tex\" Rickard, (who also refereed the bout) sold exclusive film rights. The film was recorded by nine cameramen and is two hours long. Novelist Jack London was also present in the crowd, reporting the event.\n\nSince Johnson was African-American and Jeffries was white the competition took on major racial overtones. The press dubbed Jeffries \"The Great White Hope.\" Sports writers and white America were generally astounded when Johnson beat Jeffries soundly. This caused race riots in many places across the USA and provided the film with more public attention in the United States than any other film to date and for the next five years, until the release of \"The Birth of a Nation (1915)\". On July 7, 1910, only three days after the fight various states and cities in the USA declared they would not allow the screening of the footage. The picture was banned virtually everywhere in the South, as well as in South Africa.\n\nTwo weeks after the match former President Theodore Roosevelt, an avid boxer and fan, wrote an article for \"The Outlook\" in which he supported banning not just moving pictures of boxing matches, but a complete ban on all prize fights in America. He cited the \"crookedness\" and gambling that surrounded such contests and that moving pictures have \"introduced a new method of money getting and of demoralization.\" The controversy surrounding the film directly motivated Congress to ban distribution of all prizefight films across state lines in 1912; the ban lasted for nearly three decades. It was finally lifted in 1940.\n\nIn 2005, the film of the Jeffries-Johnson \"Fight of the Century\" was entered into the United States National Film Registry as being worthy of preservation.\n\n"}

{"id": "2203351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2203351", "title": "Willie Lumpkin", "text": "Willie Lumpkin\n\nWillie Lumpkin is a fictional supporting character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is best known as the mailman of the Fantastic Four in their self-titled comic book.\n\nThe character was originally created for a syndicated daily comic strip by writer Stan Lee and artist Dan DeCarlo. Lee recalled in a 1998 interview that,\n\"Willie Lumpkin\" drew humor from the people and situations Willie would encounter along his mail delivery route in the small town of Glenville. The daily strip ran from December 1959 to May 6, 1961. A Sunday strip ran through May 28.\n\nLee and artist Jack Kirby then introduced their comic book version of Willie Lumpkin in \"Fantastic Four\" #11 (Feb. 1963). The comic book Lumpkin is depicted as significantly older than in the comic strip, though the character's good nature was retained, as were references to his past as a mailman in Glenville, which the comic book placed in Nebraska.\n\nIn his first comic book appearance, Lumpkin is represented as having befriended the Fantastic Four, to whom he makes regular fan mail deliveries at their Baxter Building headquarters in New York City. He half-jokingly requests to join the team on the grounds that he has the \"power\" to wiggle his ears.\n\nLumpkin appeared in his own solo feature in \"Marvel Comics Presents\" #18 (May 1989). In this parody of \"A Christmas Carol\", he is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past, who had intended to haunt cantankerous Spider-Man nemesis J. Jonah Jameson but couldn't find his address. The story concludes with the normally amiable postman deciding he hates Christmas.\n\nIn Marvel Comics, Willie Lumpkin serves as the postal worker mailman whose Manhattan route includes the joint home and office of the superhero group the Fantastic Four. On occasion he falls into the danger that typically surrounds the adventuring heroes. Examples include a story in which he is forced to spend Christmas Eve locked in a closet while the Fantastic Four fight the Super-Skrull, or when he helped to save the team from the Mad Thinker. This incident involved Reed's trust in Lumpkin; he had hired the mailman to manipulate the machinery as part of a safety routine. Later Lumpkin is mind-controlled into accessing Doctor Doom's time machine by a minion of Immortus. An alien Skrull also impersonates him in another story to infiltrate the Fantastic Four's headquarters.\n\nHe also briefly dated Peter Parker's Aunt May. When May briefly appeared to have died, Lumpkin grieved and was seen to befriend a new companion named Doreen Greenwald.\n\nLumpkin has since retired, and his niece Wilhemina \"Billie\" Lumpkin has taken his position as the Fantastic Four's mail carrier.\n\nHe was interviewed about the Fantastic Four on the news show \"Lateline\", saying how though the group took on cosmic menaces, they always found time to greet him. Sometime later, the super-team, miniaturized, entered his body to remove an otherwise inoperable brain tumor.\n\nLumpkin was later hired as a biology teacher for the 'Future Foundation', a school founded by the Fantastic Four. Willie enjoyed a trip to the moon when the Future Foundation and associates decided to hold a party. \n\n\"Marvels\" is a \"history\" of the world of Marvel super-heroes painted by Alex Ross and which spans from the late 1930s to the 1960s. In one scene, main character Phil Sheldon, a journalist who observes the Marvel characters from a distance (and sometimes close-up), meets his ex-girlfriend in a movie theatre where she introduces him to her date, Bill Lumpkin. With a smile, Lumpkin tells Sheldon that they have met though he states that Sheldon will not remember where, causing the reporter a little embarrassment.\n\nIn the Ultimate Marvel Universe, there is a government agent named Lumpkin, who works for the agency that runs the think-tank/school in the Baxter Building. His first name is not mentioned. He is in his forties and overweight. He is initially shown recruiting Reed Richards. He has expressed a romantic interest in Grimm's mother. Lumpkin and three of his men assist the Four in confronting the Mad Thinker, a former Baxter Building student. The entire group is knocked out by tranquilizing chemicals. Reed saves everyone.\n\n\n\n"}
