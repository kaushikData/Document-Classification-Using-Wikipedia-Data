It honours outstanding international violinists. The competition takes place annually in May and/or June during International Days of Music Hesse Main-Taunus Hofheim in Hofheim am Taunus, Hesse, Germany. After the competition, the award is presented on a separate date through the Lord Mayor of the city of Frankfurt am Main in the of the historic city hall Römer.\n\nThe Alois Kottmann Award was founded and donated in 2001. It is named after its founder and benefactor, the German violinist and university professor Alois Kottmann.\n\nDuring the first years of the competition, only one participant received an award and special prizes were offered to honour further special talents or performances. This changed in 2005 when two participants received awards. In the years 2006 and 2007, special appreciation awards were introduced along the main award and the special prizes. In addition, the unparalleled \"Bach Award of the city of Hofheim am Taunus\" was presented in 2007 to Sabrina-Vivian Höpcker (Germany). In 2010, first and second places of the Alois Kottmann Award were created, along with the special prizes. In addition, the title \"Laudatory Appreciation\" was introduced.\n\nThe award is meant to aid and encourage the Frankfurt-based tradition of Carl Flesch which has its most prominent exponents in Alma Moodie and Max Rostal. The jury will place special emphasis on classical discipline, on an artistic and stylistic understanding of the performed works as well as a \"singing\" (\"cantando\") style which signifies and characterises the personality of the artist.\n\n\"Outstanding violinists can be recognized by their tone, but with the young ones this is often not possible anymore. What is heard from them is performed speciously but without personality. The violin was created because man is able to sing also with it.\"Professor h. c. Alois Kottmann (translated from German)\n\nThe award consists of 3,000 euro, a silver medal and a certificate. In addition, one or more special prizes will be awarded if applicable.\n\nThe competition is open for violinists internationally. There is no age restriction. During the competition musical pieces are required to be performed which are published one year in advance and will change annually. Memorised play is not required nor specially rated. Closing date for applications is in April.\n\nThe members of the judging panel are Margit Neubauer (singer), university professor Alois Kottmann (violin, benefactor and patron of the award), and Boris Kottmann (violin).\n\n"}
{"id": "31295481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31295481", "title": "Andha Yug", "text": "Andha Yug\n\nAndha Yug (Hindi: अंधा युग, \"The Age of Blindness\" or \"The Blind Age\") is a 1954 verse play written in Hindi, by renowned novelist, poet, and playwright Dharamvir Bharati (1926-1997). It was the first important play of 20th century India. Set in the last day of the Great Mahabharat war, the five-act tragedy was written in the years following the 1947 partition of India atrocities, as allegory to its destruction of human lives and ethical values. It is a metaphoric meditation on the politics of violence and aggressive selfhood and that war dehumanized individuals and society. Thus both the victor and the vanquished lose eventually.\n\nThe anti-war play first created sensation as a radio play at Allahabad All India Radio. This led to its production by Mumbai-based theatre director, Satyadev Dubey (1962), and subsequent famous production by theatre doyen Ebrahim Alkazi against the backdrop of historical monuments in Delhi (like Feroz Shah Kotla and Purana Qila). It became \"a national theatrical event\"; his 1963 production was seen by then Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. It was subsequently staged by numerous directors and in many Indian languages.\n\nAs part of the \"theatre of the roots\" movement which started in Indian theatre in the 1950s, which tried to look into Indian epics and myths for form, inspiration and content, \"Andha Yug\" is today recognised as the \"play that heralded a new era in Indian theatre\" and standard repertoire of Hindi theatre. Dharamvir Bharati wrote one play during his career and was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in Playwriting (Hindi) in 1988, given by Sangeet Natak Akademi, India's National Academy of Music, Dance and Drama.\n\n\"Andha Yug\" is based on the ancient Sanskrit epic, \"Mahabharata\" written by Ved Vyasa. The play begins on the eighteenth and last day of the Great Mahabharata War, which devastated the kingdom of Kauravas, the feuding cousins of Pandavas, their capital the once-magnificent Hastinapur lay burning, in ruins, the battlefield of Kurukshetra was strewn with corpses, and skies filled with vultures and death laments. Fatalities were on both sides as cousins killed each other. The survivors were left grieving and enraged as they continued to blame each other for the destruction. No one was willing to view it as a consequence of their own moral choices.\n\nAshwatthama, son of guru Dronacharya, in one last-ditch act of revenge against the Pandavas, releases the ultimate weapon of destruction — the \"Brahmastra\", which promises to annihilate the world. No one comes forward to condemn it: Ethics and humanity have been the first casualties of the war.\n\nKrishna who mediated between the cousins before war, remains the moral centre of the play. Even in his failure he presents options that are ethical and just and reminds us that a higher or sacred way is always accessible to human beings even in the worst of times. The play ends with the death of Krishna.\n\nBharati constructed the play using western drama tradition and early Indian drama, found in Sanskrit drama.\n\n\n\"Andha Yug\" highlights the perils of self-enchantment in an anti-war allegory. It explores human capacity for moral action, reconciliation, and goodness in times of atrocity and reveals what happens when individuals succumb to the cruelty and cynicism of a blind, dispirited age.\n\nWhen a ruler, epitomized by a blind Dhritarashtra (physically and also by his ambition for his son Duryodhana), in an equally blind society fail its own side and that of their loved ones. It elaborates on the consequences, when a society fails to stop a cycle of revenge and instead choose a redemptive path, which is always available even in worst of scenarios. This is shown by Krishna's presence amid the mindlessness of fellow human beings. It was only when they collectively reject the voice of wisdom that denigration of war step upon them, leading to wide-scale bloodshed.\n\nThe story hints at the perils that await a society that turns away from its wisdom culture and instead succumb to the logic of the moment that can be easily swayed by emotions. Bharati uses the war of Mahabharat to make an anti-war statement and raises questions regarding moral uprightness in the wake of Partition-related atrocities, loss of faith and national identity.\n\nSome directors have used it to bring out contemporary issues like the role of diplomacy of the world.\n\nDharamvir Bharati (1926–1997), was a renowned Hindi novelist, poet, and playwright. His novels, \"Gunahon Ka Devta\" (The God of Sins, 1949) and \"Suraj Ka Satvan Ghoda\" (The Seventh Horse of the Sun, 1952), are classics of Hindi literature. The latter was adapted into a film by Shyam Benegal in 1992.\n\nOriginally written as a radio play, the play was first broadcast by the All India Radio (public radio) and immediately drew attention.\n\nPlaywright and theatre director Satyadev Dubey heard of the play and met Bharati when the latter had dropped in to see Dubey's Hindi adaptation of Albert Camus's \"Cross Purposes\", as \"Sapne\". Recognizing its potential, Dubey walked around with the script for nearly 10 years trying to get it done. Dubey had been running 'Theatre Unit' (a theatre group started by Ebrahim Alkazi who moved to Delhi in 1962 as director of National School of Drama, Delhi), After staging it himself in 1962, Dubey sent the script to Alkazi. Though many found the play lacking action, Alkazi believed, \"action is not rushing around. It’s inward growth.\"\n\nAlkazi's production made history in modern Indian theatre, when he staged first \"Andha Yug\" in 1963, first amidst the backdrop of the ruins of Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi and then Purana Quila's tiered steps in the 70s. It brought in a new paradigm in Indian theatres. The music for this production was given by noted composer Vanraj Bhatia.\n\nIn the coming years, the play attracted many directors and was staged across the country, including Mohan Maharishi, Ram Gopal Bajaj, and Bhanu Bharti. M.K. Raina staged the play in Berlin and the Festival of India in the USSR in 1987, Ratan Thiyam staged it in an open-air performance in Tonga, Japan, on 5 August 1994, a day before the 49th anniversary of atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Other noted productions have been by directors Arvind Gaur, Girish Tiwari (Girda), and Bijon Mondal (2010), who gave it a contemporary twist, accompanied by fusion band. A notable production in 2010 at Feroze Shah Kotla ruins included a cast of Ashish Vidyarthi (Ashwatthama), Uttara Baokar (Gandhari), Mohan Maharishi (Dhritrashtra), Vasant Josalkar (Vidur), Ravi Jhankal (Vriddha Yachak), Om Puri (Krishna), Govind Namdev (Vyas).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is an action-adventure mixed with RPG.\n\nThe game was in development since 1994. The team consisted of only 2 people - Jakub Dvorský and Marek Floryán. Developers drew inspiration form games like \"Myst\", \"\" and \"Stonekeep\". \"Asmodeus\" also changed genre a few times during development. The game was originally a text adventure game but changed in a point-and-click adventure. Action parts were added later and game become a dungeon crawl RPG mixed with adventure game. Team has grown as Dvorský and Floryán were later aided by three other members. The game was finished in 1996 and developers contacted Petr Vochozka a CEO of Vochozka Trading. Vochozka Trading released \"Asmodeus\" in 1997.\n\nThe game follows Mot. He is an apprentice of a Monk who decides to summon an ancient God Asmodeus to \"save the world.\" Monk sends Mot to find three Eterons, magic stones needed to summon Asmodeus.\n\nMot searches for Eterons through Ruthaniol country. He completes the task but finds out that Asmodeus is not a god that will save the world but devil. Mot still takes Eterons to the Monk but tries to convince him to not summon Asmodeus. Monk reveals that he actually wants to use Asmodeus to rule the world. Mot stands up to his master but is quickly killed and Monk summons Asmodeus. The game ends as Asmodeus kills the Monk and leaves the cave.\n\n\"Asmodeus\" features a First person view. Movement is similar to \"Myst\". The game is played as a dungeon crawler RPG, while in underground tunnels that arefull of enemies. Player can kill these enemies with his weapon. He can improve his weapon and skills throughout the game so he can fight harder enemies. On the other hand, when the player is outside of tunnels, it becomes an adventure game.

{"id": "4337992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4337992", "title": "Cinema of North Korea", "text": "Cinema of North Korea\n\nBecause of the isolated nature of the country, information—particularly unbiased information—on North Korean cinema is difficult to find. Outsider appraisal of North Korean cinema is often condescending, while statements from official North Korean sources include claims like, \"In recent years our film art has created an unprecedented sensation in the world's filmdom... The revolutionary people of the world are unstinting in their praise of this feature film and other monumental works, calling them 'the first-class films by international standards', 'the most wonderful movies ever produced' and 'immortal revolutionary and popular films'.\"\n\nNorth Korea's principal producer of feature films is the Korean Film Studio, a state-run studio founded in 1947 and located outside of Pyongyang. Other North Korean film studios include the Korean Documentary Film Studio (founded in 1946), the April 25 Film Studio of the Korean People's Army (founded in 1959 and previously known as the February 8 Cinema Studio) and the Korean Science and Educational Film Studio (founded in 1953 and also known as the April 26 Children's Film Production House, and Science Educational Korea, or SEK.) These studios produce feature films, documentaries, animated films, children's films and science films. According to a report from 1992, the Korean Feature Film Studio produced about forty films per year, while the other studios together accounted for another forty.\n\nIn addition to animation for the North Korean domestic market, SEK has become a resource for international animation, including some well-known American animated films. Production costs in North Korea are very low, and the quality of animators is well perceived. SEK has done work on such productions as Mondo TV's animated series \"Pocahontas\" and \"King Lion Simba\" (\"not\" the Walt Disney feature films), the science fiction epic \"Light Years\", and \"Empress Chung\".\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Il-sung believed in Lenin's maxim: \"Cinema is the most important of all arts.\" Accordingly, since the country's division, North Korean films have often been used as vehicles for instilling government ideology into the people. A common theme is martyrdom for the nation. The film \"Fate of a Self-defence Corps Member\", based on a novel written by Kim Il-sung during the fight against the Japanese occupation reflects this theme, as does the highly regarded film, \"Sea of Blood\" (1969). The latter film comes from a novel telling the story of a woman farmer who becomes a national heroine by fighting the Japanese.\n\nAnother favorite theme is the happiness of the current society. This theme can be seen reflected in titles of feature films like \"A Family of Workers\", \"A Flowering Village\", \"Rolling Mill Workers\", \"When Apples Are Picked\" and \"Girls at a Port\". All of these films were awarded the People's Prize before 1974.\n\nThe number of films produced in North Korea is difficult to determine. In 1992, \"Asiaweek\" reported that the country produced about 80 films annually, and a BBC report in 2001 indicated that North Korea was then producing about 60 films a year. In spite of these claims, Johannes Schönherr, an attendee of the 2000 Pyongyang International Film Festival, found little evidence for actual films or titles. He notes that the country offered only one domestic feature and one documentary at their most high-profile film festival, and suggests that the high number of reported films includes short films, cartoons, and short installments of long-running series. He also cites a 1998 North Korean pamphlet containing a list of films which had been made in the country up to 1998. This gives a total of 259 titles, and indicates that the 1980s were the most prolific decade with about 15 to 20 films made yearly.\n\nThe British Film Institute Sight & Sound magazine reported that an average of 20 films per year were made from the 1960s to the early 1990s. However, in the economic hard times following the collapse of the Soviet Union film production reduced, and from 2000 to 2009 only about 5 films per year were made.\n\nThe Pyongyang International Film Festival, established in 1987 and broadened in scope in 2002, is now held every two years.\n\nAfter the division of Korea following the defeat of the Japanese Empire in WWII, filmmakers in the North and the South sought to produce the first Korean film after the liberation in their respective half of the peninsula. Although South Koreans were first, with \"Viva Freedom!\" (1946), North Korea soon followed with \"My Home Village\".\n\nBecause of the secretive nature of the country as well as the lack of film exports, the exact number of feature films produced in North Korea is almost impossible to determine. The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) lists only 165 films produced in North Korea; some of which include foreign co-productions. Two of these were released in the years between the liberation from Japan and the outbreak of the Korean War, \"Our Construction\" (\"Uri Geonseol\") (1946) and \"My Homeland\" () (1949). Five were released during the war, including \"Righteous War\" (1950), \"Boy Partisans\" (1951) and \"Again to the Front\" (1952). These titles suggest that film was used for ideological purposes from the beginning of North Korea's existence as a separate entity.\n\nNearly all studios and film archives were destroyed during the Korean War, and after 1953 studios had to be rebuilt.\n\nJudging from the IMDB's entries, \n\n\"A Spinner\" (1964) and \"Boidchi annun dchonson\" (1965) made in the 1960s. One of the most highly regarded films in North Korea, \"Sea of Blood\", was produced in 1969. The entrance hall to the Korean Feature Film Studio contains a mural of \"Dear Leader\" Kim Jong-il supervising the production of this film. This is a two-part, black and white film. The first part is 125 minutes in duration, and the second is 126 minutes.\n\nKim Il-sung made a famous call for \"Juche\" art in 1966, saying, \"Our art should develop in a revolutionary way, reflecting the Socialist content with the national form\". In a 1973 treatise on film entitled \"Theory of Cinematic Art\", Kim Jong-il further developed this idea of \"Juche\" art into the cinema, claiming that it is cinema's duty to help develop the people into \"true communists\", and as a means \"to completely eradicate capitalist elements\". The ideology-heavy nature of North Korean cinema during the 1970s can be seen in titles such as \"The People Sing of the Fatherly Leader\" and \"The Rays of \"Juche\" Spread All Over the World\".\n\nPart of this ideological usage of the arts was a treating of the same subjects repeatedly through various art forms. Consequently, the most prominent films of the era took their stories and titles from pre-existing novels, ballets or operas. The film \"Sea of Blood\" was also an opera and a symphony, as well as the name of an opera company. Future Minister of Culture, Choe Ik-kyu's \"The Flower Girl\" (1972, 130 min.) later was remade as a dance. This film won a special prize and special medal at the 18th International Film Festival, and is one of the more well-known North Korean films of the 1970s.\n\n\"Unsung Heroes\", a 20-part spy film about the Korean War, was released between 1978 and 1981; it achieved notice outside of North Korea two decades later mainly because United States Forces Korea defector Charles Robert Jenkins played a role as a villain and the husband of one of the main characters.\n\nWith 14 listings, the 1980s is the best-represented decade for North Korea at IMDB. A possible turning to less didactic subjects is indicated with a 1986 production of the popular stories like \"Chunhyang-jon\" (1980 - 155 min.) and \"Hong kil dong\" () (1986 - 115 min.). Probably the most well-known North Korean film internationally is the giant-monster epic, \"Pulgasari\" () (1985), directed by kidnapped South Korean director Shin Sang-ok. Multi-part films promoting the \"Juche\" ideology, including \"Star of Korea\" and \"The Sun of the Nation\" were also produced in the 1980s. North Korean animation produced for domestic consumption is reportedly less politically dogmatic during this period, resulting in a large adult audience. At least one international co-production has been filmed in North Korea, \"Ten Zan - Ultimate Mission\", directed by Italian director Ferdinando Baldi and starring American Frank Zagarino.\n\nIMDB lists only four North Korean films made in the 1990s. \"Nation and Destiny\" () is a 56-part series of movies produced from 1992–1999, on Korean subjects and people like General Choi Duk Shin (parts 1-4) and composer Yun I-sang (parts 5, 14-16).\n\nThe 2000s appear to be reasonably productive for North Korean cinema, having five listings so far. In a sign of thawing relations, the animated film, \"Empress Chung\" (2005), is a co-production of South and North Korea. This film is said to be the first released simultaneously in both countries. Another recent North/South co-production is the 3-D animated television series \"Lazy Cat Dinga\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15103874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15103874", "title": "Contest of Homer and Hesiod", "text": "Contest of Homer and Hesiod\n\nThe Contest of Homer and Hesiod (Greek: \"Ἀγὼν Oμήρου καὶ Ἡσιόδου\", Latin: \"Certamen Homeri et Hesiodi\" or simply Certamen) is a Greek narrative that expands a remark made in Hesiod's \"Works and Days\" to construct an imagined poetical \"agon\" between Homer and Hesiod. In \"Works and Days,\" Hesiod (without mentioning Homer) claims he won a poetry contest, receiving as the prize a tripod, which he dedicated to the Muses of Mount Helicon. A tripod, believed to be Hesiod's dedication-offering, was still being shown to tourists visiting Mount Helicon and its sacred grove of the Muses in Pausanias' day, but has since vanished.\n\nThe \"Certamen\" itself is clearly of the second century A.D., for it mentions Hadrian (line 33). Friedrich Nietzsche deduced that it must have an earlier precedent in some form, and argued that it derived from the sophist Alcidamas' \"Mouseion\", written in the fourth century B.C. Three fragmentary papyri discovered since have confirmed his view. One dates from the third century B.C., one from the second century B.C. (both of these contain versions of the text largely agreeing with the Hadrianic version) and one, identified in a colophon text as the ending of Alcidamas, \"On Homer\" (University of Michigan Pap. 2754) from the 2nd or 3rd century AD.\nThat the story derives in part from the classical period or earlier (and before the \"Mouseion\") has been shown most clearly by two lines from its riddle passage that appear in Aristophanes' \"Peace\" \"It does seem easier to suppose that Aristophanes was quoting a pre-existing text of the \"Certamen\" than that Alcidamas appropriated the lines from Aristophanes for a \"Certamen\"-like story in his \"Mouseion\",\" R.M. Rosen observes. The more profound influences of some version of the \"Contest\" on Aristophanes' \"The Frogs\" has been traced by Rosen, who notes the clearly traditional organising principle of the contest of wits (\"sophias\"), often involving riddling tests.\n\nThe site of the contest is Chalcis, in Euboea. Hesiod tells (\"Works and Days\" lines 650–662) that the only time he took passage in a ship was when he went from Aulis to Chalcis, to take part in the funeral games for Amphidamas, a noble of Chalcis. Hesiod was victorious; he dedicated the prize, a bronze tripod, to the Muses at Helicon. There is no mention of Homer.\n\nIn \"Certamen Homeri et Hesiodi\" the winning passage that Hesiod selects is the passage from \"Works and Days\" that begins, \"When the Pleiades arise...\" The judge, who is the brother of the late Amphidamas, awards the prize to Hesiod. The relative value of Homer and Hesiod is established in the poem by the relative value of their subject matter to the \"polis\", the community: Hesiod's work on agriculture and peace is pronounced of more value than Homer's tales of war and slaughter.\n\nThe work also preserves 17 epigrams attributed to Homer. Three of these epigrams (epigrams III, XIII and XVII) are also preserved in the Contest of Homer and Hesiod and epigram I is found in a few manuscripts of the Homeric Hymns.\n\nThe short text begins with brief sketches of the poets' lives, including their parentage and birth. It then describes the contest itself, which consists of challenges and riddles that Hesiod poses, to which Homer improvises masterfully, to the applause of the on-lookers, followed by their recitation of what they considered their best passage and the awarding of the tripod to Hesiod; this takes up about half the text and is followed by accounts of the circumstances of their deaths.\n\nOne modern edition of the Greek text is in volume 5 of T.W. Allen's \"Oxford Classical Text of Homer\" (1912). \n\nAn edition with Greek text and English translation (on facing pages) by Hugh Evelyn-White was published in 1914 as part of the Loeb Classical Library volume titled \"Hesiod, the Homeric Hymns and Homerica,\" and is now in the public domain and available online.\n\n"}

The first example he offers used an umbrella-like canopy hung over an oil lamp and provided with a vaned opening at its top, so that heated air rising from the lamp would cause it to rotate. The lower part of the canopy was in the form of a cylinder and had translucent panes with paintings of animals or men. Sufficiently rapid rotation would \"give an impression of movement\" to the painted figures. Several later writers have misreported Needham by crediting this particular device to Ding Huan. The only such invention Needham attributes to Ding Huan is \"a 'nine-storied hill-censer' ... on which many strange birds and mysterious animals were attached. All ... moved quite naturally ... presumably as soon as the lamp was lit.\"\n\nNeedham claims these devices \"certainly embodied the principle of a rapid succession of images\", but it is not apparent from any of the descriptions provided that there was anything other than a \"procession\" of painted figures or carvings or cast shadows seen actually moving through space. By contrast, the invention for which the name \"zoetrope\" was coined in the 19th century is, like the flip book, an animation device that creates an \"illusion\" of motion from a series of images showing successive phases of that motion, by rapidly presenting them to the viewer one after another in such a way that each abruptly replaces (or \"seems\" to abruptly replace) the previous one.\n"}

{"id": "49250478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49250478", "title": "Heavy metal guitar", "text": "Heavy metal guitar\n\nHeavy metal guitar (or simply metal guitar) is the use of highly-amplified electric guitar in heavy metal. Heavy metal guitar playing is rooted in the guitar playing styles developed in 1960s-era blues rock and psychedelic rock, and it uses a massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos and overall loudness. The electric guitar and the sonic power that it projects through amplification has historically been the key element in heavy metal. The heavy metal guitar sound comes from a combined use of high volumes and heavy distortion.\n\nHeavy metal bands often have two electric guitarists, with one guitarist playing rhythm guitar and one guitarist playing lead guitar. The rhythm guitar player is part of the rhythm section of the band, along with the bass guitarist and the drummer. The lead guitarist plays guitar solos, instrumental melody lines and melodic fill passages. In power trios, which consist of a guitarist, bassist and drummer, with one or more members singing lead vocals, the single guitarist will switch between rhythm guitar and lead guitar roles as needed.\n\nThe rhythm guitar player is part of the rhythm section of the band, along with the bass guitarist and drummer (and in some bands, a keyboard player). The rhythm guitarist typically plays power chords and riffs using an electric guitar that is plugged into a guitar amplifier, with either the amplifier and/or a distortion effect pedal creating a thick, heavy, distorted sound. The rhythm guitar player plays chords and riffs that create, along with the bass and drums, the rhythmic sound of a metal song. The rhythm guitar also plays the chord progression of a song, along with the bass player (and, if the band has one, the keyboard player). \n\nIn 1966, the British company Marshall Amplification began producing the Marshall 1963, a guitar amplifier capable of producing the distorted \"crunch\" that rock musicians were starting to seek. With rhythm guitar parts, the \"heavy crunch sound in heavy metal...[is created by] palm muting\" the strings with the picking hand and using distortion. Palm muting creates a tighter, more precise sound and it emphasizes the low end.\n\nSome rhythm guitarists sing lead vocals or backup vocals simultaneously as they play guitar.\n\nThe lead guitarist plays guitar solos, instrumental melody lines and melodic fill passages. Guitar solos are \"...an essential element of the heavy metal code ... that underscores the significance of the guitar\" to the genre. Most heavy metal songs \"... featur[e] at least one guitar solo\", which is \"... a primary means through which the heavy metal performer expresses virtuosity\". One exception is nu metal bands, which tend to omit guitar solos.\n\nShred guitar or \"shredding\" is a virtuoso lead guitar solo playing style for the electric guitar that is used in a number of metal genres. Shredding uses a range of fast playing techniques, such as \"sweep-picked arpeggios, diminished and harmonic minor scales, finger-tapping, fast scale and arpeggio runs and special effects such as tremolo bar \"dive bombs\". Metal guitarists playing in a \"shred\" style use the electric guitar with a guitar amplifier and a range of electronic effects such as distortion, which create a more sustained guitar tone and facilitate guitar feedback effects.\n\nIn 1978, a \"heretofore unknown guitarist named Eddie Van Halen\" from Los Angeles released \"'Eruption', a blistering aural assault of solo electric guitar\" which featured rapid \"tapping\", which \"had rarely been heard in a rock context before\". Chris Yancik argues that it is this \"record, above any other, that spawned the genre of Shred\".\n\nSome lead guitarists sing lead vocals or backup vocals when they are not playing guitar solos.\n\nShred guitar players often use electric solidbody guitars such as Ibanez, Gibson, Fender, Kramer, Kiesel/Carvin, Jackson, Charvel, Schecter and ESP. Some shred guitarists use elaborately-shaped models by B.C. Rich or Dean, as well as modern versions of classic-radical designs like Gibson's Flying V and Explorer models. Tremolo bars (also known as \"whammy bars\"), which are hinged bridges that can be bent down or up in pitch, are an important part of shred playing, as they permit the \"dive bombing\" effect and many sounds which are not possible with a fixed-bridge instrument.\n\nGuitars with double-cutaways give performers easier access to the higher frets. Many guitar makers are now making a \"scalloped cutaway\" which was popularized by Irron R. Collins IV. This removes material on the backside of the \"horn\" allowing extended room for the fretting hand to get extended reach onto the higher notes of the fretboard. Some shred guitarists, such as Scorpions' Ulrich Roth, have used custom-made tremolo bars and developed modified instruments, such as Roth's \"Sky Guitar, that would greatly expand his instrumental range, enabling him to reach notes previously reserved in the string world for cellos and violins.\"\n\nSome shred guitar players use seven or eight string guitars to allow a greater range of notes, such as Steve Vai. Most shred guitar players use a range of effects such as distortion and audio compression units, both of which increase sustain and facilitate the performance of shred techniques such as tapping, hammer-ons, and pull-offs. These and other effects units, such as delay effects are also used to create a unique tone. Shred-style guitarists often use high-gain vacuum tube amplifiers such as Marshall, Carvin, Peavey, Mesa Boogie, ENGL, Laney, Hughes & Kettner and Randall. To facilitate the use of audio feedback effects with the guitar, shred guitarists use high gain settings, distortion pedals and high on-stage volume.\n\nElectric guitarists in metal use large, powerful guitar amplifiers, typically with multiple large speaker cabinets. Some metal guitarists use 18 or more speaker cabinets, with each cabinet containing four 10\" speakers. Following the lead set by Jimi Hendrix, Cream and The Who, early heavy metal acts such as Blue Cheer set new benchmarks for volume. As Blue Cheer's Dick Peterson put it, \"All we knew was we wanted more power.\" A 1977 review of a Motörhead concert noted how \"excessive volume in particular figured into the band's impact\". Weinstein states that powerful sound, timbre, and volume are the key elements of metal. She argues that the loudness is designed to \"sweep the listener into the sound\" and to provide a \"shot of youthful vitality\".\nIn relation to the gender composition of heavy metal bands, it has been said that \"[h]eavy metal performers are almost exclusively male\" \"...[a]t least until the mid-1980s\" apart from \"... exceptions such as Girlschool\". However, \"...now [in the 2010s] maybe more than ever–strong metal women have put up their dukes and got down to it\",\"carv[ing] out a considerable place for [them]selves\". Given that most heavy metal musicians are male, most metal guitarists are male. Almost all of the most well-known metal guitarists in major bands are male.\n\nWomen have less roles in rock music genres like metal because the \"... rebellion of rock music was largely a male rebellion\". Philip Auslander says that \"Although there were many women in rock by the late 1960s, most performed only as singers, a traditionally feminine position in popular music\". Though some women played instruments in American all-female garage rock bands, none of these bands achieved more than regional success. So they \"did not provide viable templates for women's on-going participation in rock\".\n\nNotable women metal guitarists include:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1565221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1565221", "title": "Italian playing cards", "text": "Italian playing cards\n\nPlaying cards (\"carte da gioco\") have been in Italy since the late 14th century. As Latin suited cards, they use swords (\"spade\"), cups (\"coppe\"), coins (\"denari\"), and clubs (\"bastoni\"). All Italian suited decks have three face cards per suit: the \"fante\" (Knave), \"cavallo\" (Knight), and \"re\" (King), unless it is a tarocchi deck in which case a \"donna\" or \"regina\" (Queen) is inserted between the \"cavallo\" and \"re\". Italian suited cards normally only refer to cards originating from northeastern Italy around the former Republic of Venice as the rest of Italy uses Spanish suits, French suits or German suits. Until the late 19th century, Italy was composed of many smaller independent states or under foreign occupation which led to the development of various regional patterns. Italian suited cards are largely confined to northern Italy, parts of Switzerland, Dalmatia and southern Montenegro. Popular games include Scopa, Briscola, Tressette, Bestia, and Sette e mezzo.\n\nPlaying cards arrived from Mamluk Egypt during the 1370s. Mamluk cards used suits of cups, coins, swords, and polo-sticks. As polo was an obscure sport, Italians changed them into batons. Italy was a collection of small states so each region developed its own variations. Southern Italy was under strong Spanish influence so their cards closely resemble the ones in Spain. Northern Italian suits used curved swords instead of straight ones and their clubs are ceremonial batons instead of cudgels. Swords and clubs also intersect unlike their Spanish counterparts.\n\nTarot cards were invented during the early 15th century in northern Italy as a permanent suit of trumps (trionfi). Italian-suited cards are rarely found outside of Northern Italy. In the past, however, tarot cards based on those from Milan, the Tarot of Marseilles, spread to France, Switzerland, and most of central and northern Europe before being replaced by French-suited tarots during the 18th and 19th centuries. In a few places in Switzerland, the Italian-suited Swiss 1JJ Tarot is still used for games. \n\nThe Venetian game of Trappola also spread northwards until dying out in the mid-20th century. The Greek word for playing card, \"Τράπουλα\", is a transliteration of Trappola. It may have entered into the Greek language from the Venetian-occupied Ionian Islands during the 16th century. In Corfu, Aspioti-ELKA produced Venetian pattern cards until the Greco-Italian War.\n\n40-card stripped decks lacking the 8s, 9s, and 10s are the most common format found in Italy today. This is the result of popular 16th and 17th century games like Primero and Ombre. \n\nThese three patterns are closely related, having been formed in close proximity to one another. The Trentine pattern is believed to be the oldest surviving Italian pattern and the origin of the Bresciane and Bergamasche patterns. Trappola cards may also have originated from this pattern.\n\nTrentine cards are sold in either packs of 40 or 52. The smaller deck is missing the 8s through 10s. The larger deck comes with a pair of Jokers. All the Kings sit on thrones and the cards are not reversible. The cards utilize only five colors: black, white, red, blue, and yellow which has led to face cards with blue, yellow, and red hair. Trentine pip cards also have numerals though not always in the corner. These cards are wider than the two below.\n\nThe Bresciane deck comes only in sets of 52 cards and are not reversible. The cards are slightly more colorful, adding green and brown. Only the 7 and 9 of Swords are numbered and they are found within the pips.\n\nThe Bergamasche pattern comes in decks of 40 cards only. They are reversible or double-headed, meaning they can be turned upside down. None of the pip cards are numbered and color is added to the faces of the characters.\nThe Trevisane deck, also known as the Trevigiane, Venetian or Veneto deck, comes in sets of 40 or 52. The smaller set is missing ranks 8 through 10 while the larger often includes two Jokers to bump it up to 54 cards. The face cards are reversible and the pip cards have corner indices.\n\nClosely related is the Triestine pack, which was created in the mid-19th century and was once available in 52 card sets but now only 40 card decks are sold. Though ranks 8 through 10 were removed, the face cards are still numbered 11 through 13. The face cards are reversible with each half separated by white box that labels the card, a feature usually found only in some tarot decks. This is the only deck in which both face cards and pip cards are numbered though not always in the corner.\n\nThese patterns can be found in some regions that used to be part of the Venetian Republic's Stato da Màr.\n\nCards from Bologna are sold in two sets, the 40 card Primiera Bolognese set and the 62 card Tarocco Bolognese set. The Primiera set is used for standard games like Primero while the Tarocco set is used to play Tarocchini. The Primiera set goes from ranks Ace to 7, Knave, Knight, and King. The Tarocco set goes from ranks 6 to 10, Knave, Knight, Queen, King, and Ace. All ranks that they share in common appear very similar but are not identical.\n\nThe Tarocco set's trump cards are also different from other tarot decks. While it has 21 trump cards, only trumps 5 to 16 are numbered and four of the lower trumps are considered equal. The Magician is an unnumbered trump and ranks as the lowest. All the face cards and trumps are reversible. Tarocco sets by Dal Negro includes two Jokers that aren't used in any tarocchini games.\nThe Tarocco Piemontese is a 78-card tarot deck from Piedmont and the most popular tarot playing deck in Italy. It is derived from the Tarot of Marseilles. Unlike the traditional Piemontesi deck which uses French suits, the tarot deck uses Italian suits. The Fool is numbered as 0 despite not being a trump card. Trumps and most pip cards have indices in modern Arabic numerals (for trumps, cups, and coins) or Roman numerals (for swords and batons). The face cards and trumps are reversible. Dal Negro's decks include two Jokers that aren't used for tarot games.\n\nSwiss 1JJ is a 78-card tarot set descended from the Tarot of Besançon, an offshoot of the Marseilles tarot, and is still used in pockets of Switzerland. Despite having Italian suits, the trumps are labelled in French or German. They are not reversible and the trumps and pip cards use Roman numeral indexing. They are used by the Romansh to play Troccas and by German Swiss to play Troggu.\n\n\n"}

Originally opened on a different site in 1969, it claimed to be the longest-running live music venue in the United Kingdom, and hosted early performances by acts such as Dire Straits and U2.\n\nThe club has been owned throughout its existence by former motorcycle speedway rider Sam Jukes, who started the club with two friends in 1969 after his sporting career was ended by injury. It began operation as a disco night held in the social club at the former home stadium of Dudley Town Football Club and was intended to raise extra funds for the cash-strapped club. It quickly outgrew these premises and relocated to a 250-capacity venue behind a menswear shop on King Street in the early 1970s, before moving to its present location on Castle Hill in 1994, which afforded a capacity of 1000. Jukes states that he named the club after John Bryant, a local DJ who was popular with women, as he felt his association with the venue would help bring in customers, although rumours persist that it was named after Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham, a native of nearby Redditch. It has now re-open for venue bookings such as parties and marriages.\n\nIn 2008, rumours circulated that the venue might be subject to a compulsory purchase order and closed down as part of a multimillion-pound redevelopment scheme for the town centre. A spokesman for Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council stated, however, that this was not part of the plan at that time, although the redevelopment might extend to include Castle Hill at a future date.\n\nThe club went into administration during 2010, and it was hoped that a buyer would be found to continue to run the club in its then-present state but new ownership failed to materialise and the club was closed in January 2011. The site of the club was eventually sold in late 2012 and was briefly transformed into a conference and banqueting centre.\n\nThe venue has hosted performances by U2, UB40, Blur, Manic Street Preachers, Elvis Costello, Skunk Anansie, The Stone Roses, Primal Scream, Doctor Feelgood, Sister Love Radiohead and Judas Priest. It also regularly hosted concerts by up-and-coming local bands. The three leading bands of the so-called \"Stourbridge music scene\" of the early 1990s, Pop Will Eat Itself, The Wonder Stuff and Ned's Atomic Dustbin, all cite the venue as a major influence over their early careers. In 2000, the venue celebrated its 30th anniversary by hosting a two-day music festival at nearby Dudley Castle featuring Terrorvision, Ned's Atomic Dustbin, and former Wonder Stuff frontman Miles Hunt.\n\nFrank Sidebottom maintained that his set at JB's -- a poorly-attended gig at which the audience collectively decided to play football instead of watch the band -- was the best gig he ever did.\n\n"}

It draws its stories from Javanese history and romances and in this differs from \"wayang wong\", which shares with \"wayang kulit\" a repertoire drawn from the Hindu epics Mahabharata and Ramayana, as well as from \"ludruk\" which uses contemporary settings and the three-walled \"srimulat\", which specializes in vampire stories. According to Clifford Geertz it was invented as recently as 1923.\n\nKetoprak troupes might own or rent a performance building, such as Ketoprak Srimulat that used to be performed in a theatre both in Jakarta and Surabaya back in the 1980s, or troupes might travel through villages. The travelling ketoprak troupe is called \"Kethoprak Tobong\", also known as \"Ketoprak Tonil\". It might be considered as common people theatrical tradition in Java. The show were performed in certain period in an empty plain near a village and moved from one place to another, in fashion similar to western travelling circus. In this traveling troupe, the performers and staffs also brought show properties; such as costumes, stage decorations, chairs, gamelan, sound system, diesel electric generator, all were contained in a portable building that also used as set or stage called \"tobong\". During their journey, the troupe members also living in this \"tobong\".\n\nRecently ketoprak has been adopted into television show, the \"Ketoprak Humor\" show was aired in Indonesian national television. It is a comedy and action performance, often took place in modern settings or in historical ancient Javanese kingdoms. The ketoprak that took the story of ancient Java is quite similar with Wayang wong performance, however ketoprak performance is more free for improvisations, jokes and adoption of popular languages, while Wayang wong are traditionally highly stylized with precise and structurized dance drama discipline.\n"}

Unlike \"The Corsair\", it was published anonymously, in conjunction with Samuel Rogers' \"Jacqueline\".\n\n\"Lara, A Tale\" was first published anonymously by Lord Byron in 1814 alongside another poem that was not written by Byron. In this version, there is nothing to distinguish between \"Lara\" and \"Jacqueline\" (written by Samuel Rogers), as they were published anonymously and without any indication that there are two separate authors within the text. This tragic narrative poem is seen as a continuation of another poem of Byron’s, \"The Corsair\". It details Count Lara’s return home after spending a few years travelling abroad. With a page as his only company, Lara’s story continues as he encounters problems with his fellow men. First, this leads to a duel that Count Lara ends up winning and as the story progresses, he must also fight both friends and foes. Count Lara is successful in his battle against all odds, until one night he encounters a large group and attempts to fight them. Unfortunately, he is mortally wounded in the process and dies at the end of the poem.\n\nThe first drafts of the poem are from 1814. The copy text that Byron wrote for the first edition was made between June 14 and June 23, 1814. There were subsequent corrections made but none of the materials have been found. Sometime after August 5, 1814, \"Lara\" was published with \"Jacqueline\" for the first time. The first three editions were published together and anonymously, selling almost 7,000 copies. When the fourth edition was released, the tale was published by itself and under Byron’s name.\n\nThe narrative poem recounts the story of the fateful return of Count Lara to his home after spending years abroad traveling the orient. One of Byron's footnotes explains that, even though the name \"Lara\" is of Spanish origin, \"no circumstance of local or national description fix[es] the scene or hero of the poem to any country or age\". \n\nReturning to his patrimony with a retinue consisting of one foreign-born page, Kaled, Count Lara resumes the management of his landed estates. Lara's first efforts are crowned with success: only to be undermined by the jealousy and envy of his peers. After a successful duel to defend his honour, the count becomes inexorably caught up in local blood-feuds; which quickly escalate to open warfare between his own followers and the private armies of his enemies.\n\nFighting against insuperable odds with desperate courage, Count Lara rallies the remnant of his shattered forces and makes for the border to regroup. During a forced night march he is intercepted by a large opposing force: and in the course of the ensuing battle he is mortally wounded, and is retired from the fighting due to the good offices of his ever-faithful oriental page.\n\nAs Count Lara lies dying he is confronted by his nemesis, Count Otho, but ignores the latter's taunts to address his dying words to his page in a foreign tongue unknown to his countrymen. Otho arranges the obsequies, but Count Lara's page refuses to desert the graveside, his grief rendering him immune to Otho's threats and pleas not to abandon his former master.\n\n"}

{"id": "253335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=253335", "title": "Maciste", "text": "Maciste\n\nMaciste () is one of the oldest recurring characters in cinema, created by Gabriele d'Annunzio and Giovanni Pastrone. He cuts a heroic figure throughout the history of the cinema of Italy from the 1910s to the mid-1960s.\n\nHe is usually depicted as a Hercules-like figure, utilizing his massive strength to achieve heroic feats that ordinary men cannot. Many of the 1960s Italian films featuring Maciste were retitled in other countries, substituting more popular names in the titles (such as Hercules, Goliath or Samson).\n\nThere are a number of references to the name in literature. The name of Maciste appears in a sentence in Strabo's \"Geography\" (Book 8, Chapter 3, Section 21), in which he writes: — \"And in the middle is the temple of the Macistian Heracles, and the river Acidon.\" The epithet Μακίστιος (Makistios, Latinized as \"Macistius\") is generally understood to be an adjective referring to a town called Μάκιστος (Makistos) in the province of Triphylia in Elis.\nIn the first volume of the \"Dizionario universale archeologico-artistico-technologico\" (1858) \"Macistius\" is given as one among several epithets of Hercules (\"Ercole\"). In the second volume of the same dictionary (1864) this name appears Italianized as \"Maciste\", defined as \"uno dei soprannomi d'Ercole\" (\"one of the nicknames of Hercules\").\nAccording to William Smith's \"A Dictionary of Greek and Roman mythology\", \"Macistus\" (Μάκιστος) was \"a surname of Heracles, who had a temple in the neighbourhood of the town of Macistus in Triphylia\". Makistos was also the third child of Athamas and Nephele, according to the Greek mythology.\n\nIn the original draft outline of the 1914 film \"Cabiria\" by director Giovanni Pastrone, the muscular hero's name had been \"Ercole\". In the revised script, writer Gabriele d'Annunzio gave the character the name \"Maciste\", which he understood (based on the above or similar sources) to be an erudite synonym for Hercules. \n<br>\nBy later writers using the character the original etymology was generally forgotten, and a folk etymology was constructed based on the name's superficial similarity to the Italian word \"macigno\" \"large stone\"; in the first of the 1960s films, Maciste tells another character in the film that his name means \"born of the rock\", and in a later film, Maciste is actually shown in one scene appearing from within a solid rock wall in a cave as if by magic.\n\nMaciste made his debut in the 1914 Italian silent movie classic \"Cabiria\". \"Cabiria\" was a story about a slave named Maciste (played by Bartolomeo Pagano) who was involved in the rescue of a Roman princess named Cabiria (played by Lidia Quaranta) from an evil Carthaginian priest who plotted to sacrifice her to the cruel god Moloch. The film was based very loosely on \"Salammbo\", a historical novel by Gustave Flaubert, and had a plot and screenplay by Gabriele D'Annunzio.\n\nMaciste's debut set the tone for his later adventures. Including \"Cabiria\" itself, there have been at least 52 movies featuring Maciste, 27 of them being pre-1927 silent films starring Bartolomeo Pagano and the other 25 being a series of sound/color films produced in the early 1960s. Typical plots involve tyrannical rulers who practice vile magical rituals or worship evil gods. Typically, the young lady who is the love interest runs afoul of the evil ruler. Maciste, who possesses superhuman strength, must rescue her. There is often a rightful king who wants to overthrow the evil usurper, as well as a belly dance scene. There is often an evil queen who has carnal designs on the hero. These films were set in locales including Mongolia, Peru, Egypt, and the Roman Empire.\n\nAs a character, Maciste had two distinct moments in the spotlight. The first was in the Italian silent movie period, in which the original Maciste from \"Cabiria\", the muscular actor Bartolomeo Pagano, starred in a series of at least 26 sequels over the period from 1915 through 1926. Then decades later, (following on the heels of the success of the two 1950s Steve Reeves \"Hercules\" films) Maciste was revived by Italian filmmakers for a series of 25 sound films (all made between 1960 and 1965).\n\nThe Bartolomeo Pagano silent Maciste films established the character as someone who could appear at any place and at any time. Some of the earlier ones, made during World War I, had the distinct flavour of propaganda, and cast the hero in the role of a soldier. Later films in the series return to fantasy, but the fantasy was not always mythological. Maciste appears as an Olympic athlete, in contemporary settings, or in the afterlife. His character and his plots remained consistent in whatever setting; he was always a populist Hercules, using his physical prowess to overcome the evil ruses of effete aristocrats and authority figures.\nThe character was revived in the 1960s. In 1957, Steve Reeves' \"Hercules\", an Italian production, created a minor boom in Italian dramas featuring American bodybuilders in vaguely mythological or classical historical subjects. Maciste was the hero in 25 of these films. Other films starred such heroes as Ursus, Samson, Hercules and Goliath.\n\nMaciste was never given an origin, and the source of his mighty powers was never revealed, nor was he confined to one specific time period/setting in his adventures. However, in the first of the 1960s Maciste films, he mentions to another character that the name \"Maciste\" means \"born of the rock\" (almost as if he was a god who would just appear out of the earth in times of need). One of the 1920s silent Maciste films was actually entitled \"The Giant from the Dolomite\" (another reference that he was not born as an ordinary mortal man would have been). Hence it is hinted that Maciste is more god than man, which would explain his great strength.\n\nThis sword and sandal fad continued for about six years, until the new fad for spaghetti Westerns and spy films took over the attention of the Italian cinema industry. The name Maciste was not in the title of the English versions of most of these films: when the films were imported into the USA and dubbed in English, the hero's name was often changed to Hercules, Samson, Goliath, Atlas, Ulysses or Colossus, because the name Maciste was not widely recognised in the USA.\n\nSome Italian sword and sandal films were not theatrically released in the USA; rather they premiered on American television in a syndication package called \"The Sons of Hercules\", usually broadcast on Saturday afternoons. Best remembered for its stirring theme song, films originally featuring Maciste were dubbed into a variety of different \"Sons of Hercules\" pictures, with stock narration at the opening attempting to tie the film's lead character in to Hercules any way they could. A number of Italian musclemen played Maciste in the 1960s films, but Mark Forest was the actor who played Maciste the most (7 times). The other actors included Gordon Scott, Reg Park, Gordon Mitchell, Reg Lewis, Kirk Morris, Samson Burke, Alan Steel, Richard Lloyd, Renato Rossini and Frank Gordon.\n\n\n\nThere were a total of 25 Maciste films from the 1960s peplum craze (not counting the two dozen silent Maciste films made in Italy pre-1930). By 1960, seeing how well the two Steve Reeves \"Hercules\" films were doing at the box office, Italian producers decided to revive the 1920s silent film character \"Maciste\" in a new series of color/sound films. Unlike the other Italian peplum protagonists, Maciste found himself in a variety of time periods ranging from the Ice Age to 16th Century Scotland. Maciste was never given an origin, and the source of his mighty powers was never revealed. However, in the first film of the 1960s series, he mentions to another character that the name \"Maciste\" means \"born of the rock\" (almost as if he was a god who would just appear out of the earth itself in times of need). One of the 1920s silent Maciste films was actually entitled \"The Giant from the Dolomite\", hinting that Maciste may be more god than man, which would explain his great strength. <br>\nThe first title listed for each film is the film's original Italian title along with its English translation, while the U.S. release title follows in bold type in parentheses. (Note how many times Maciste's name in the Italian title is altered to an entirely different name in the American title):\n\n\nIn 1973, the Spanish cult film director Jesús Franco directed two low-budget \"Maciste films\" for French producers: \"Maciste contre la Reine des Amazones\" (\"Maciste vs the Queen of the Amazons\") and \"Les exploits érotiques de Maciste dans l'Atlantide\" (\"The Erotic Exploits of Maciste in Atlantis\"). The films had almost identical casts, both starring Wal Davis as Maciste, and appear to have been shot back-to-back. The former was distributed in Italy as a \"Karzan\" movie (a cheap Tarzan imitation), while the latter film was released only in France with hardcore inserts as \"Les Gloutonnes\" (\"The Gobblers\"). Despite their titles; these two films were totally unrelated to the 1960s Italian Maciste series; Maciste was presented as a 16th-century French adventurer who travels overseas to exotic lands.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33212344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33212344", "title": "Meno Fortas", "text": "Meno Fortas\n\nMeno Fortas is a theatrical production facility and theater group in Vilnius formed and directed by Lithuanian Eimuntas Nekrošius since 1998. It was specifically created for the production of works under this director, but is also active in the formation of young theater arts professionals and the promotion of Lithuanian theatre tradition both at home and abroad. The institution does not have its own theater and performs heavily abroad at theatre festivals. The institution is known for its streamlined stagings, heavy on metaphor, with most of its stories based on known plays, including major works by Shakespeare, Anton Chekov and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. These productions are an extension of Nekrošius’s directing career which began in the 1970s.\nMeno fortas was formed in 1998 as a private, non-profit institution by Eimuntas Nekrošius, Nadežda Gultiajeva and The Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Lithuania. (shorthis) The name translates to “fortress of art,” and applies to the Vilnius-based production facility as well as the theater company. The focus of the institution is to produce works created and/or directed by Lithuanian director Eimuntas Nekrošius in Lithuania and abroad. Most of these works represent Lithuanian theatrical tradition and are promoted by the company to a wider audience. However, it also works to on collaborative projects with other institutions, training young theater artists, organize various types of cultural events financed by both public and private monies. Meno Fortas has been a member of the Union of the Theatres of Europe since 2000.\n\nThere are different artists working constantly in the studio, chamber concerts and performances are taking place here as well. After 2007, the group added chamber theatre to its repertoire. Meno Fortas does not have its own building, but rather rents space for its offices and rehearsal rooms and performances are held in rented theatres. The company performs about fifty times a year outside of the country, mostly of works such as Song of Songs, The Seasons by Kristijonas Donelaitis and the Shakespeare trilogy of Hamlet, Macbeth and Othello. The group is part of strong theatre scene in that exists in the capital of Vilnius despite the country’s poverty. It also has a very strong tradition of the theater being dominated by its directors.\nEimuntas Nekrošius, born 1952, is a graduate of the Lunacharsky Art Institute (today Russian Academy of Theatre Arts) in Moscow. He began is directing career as the “enfant terrible” of the Vilnus State Youth Theater, working there from 1978 to 1991, with a short stint from 1979 to 1980 at the Kaunas National Drama Theatre. During the Soviet era, major works that he produced include such as \"The Square\" by Yeliseyeva in 1980, L\"ove and Death in Verona\" by Antanėlis and Geda (1982), \"Pirosmani, Pirosmani, A Day Longer Than a Hundred Years\" by Aitmatov (1983) and \"Uncle Vanya\" by Chekhov (1986). Of these the two most important were \"The Square\" and \"Uncle Vanya\". In the first, life in prison was measured by counting sugar cubes, which audiences interpreted as a metaphor for Soviet life and in the latter, Astrov’s maps were tiny postage stamps, which Yelena viewed through a very large magnifying screen. This performance of Uncle Vanya broke the tradition of staging this play set by Constantin Stanislavski . His performances produced by the LIFE Festival include \"Mozart and Salieri\", \"Don Juan\", \"Plague\" by Pushkin (1994), \"Three Sisters\" by Chekhov (1995) and \"Love and Death in Verona\" (1996), all of which were also presented at various international theater festivals. This work popularized a new trend in Lithuanian theatre based on poetry and metaphor, with the main focus on psychology and emotion with relatively plastic acting. Scenery, while sparse, is important to give multiple layers to the use of metaphor. Nekrošius has continued with this style of production as founder and director of Meno Fortas, founded 1998. The director has received a number of awards for his work include best stage director of the year by Lithuanian Critique, the New Reality in Europe Theater by the Europe Theater Union and the Taormina Art Festival committee and the UBU Premium of Italy.\n\nMenos Forte has continued with Nekrošius streamlined, metaphoric staging. One example of this style is seen in the group’s production of Faust. Its depiction of Faust is marked by the main character slowly walking downstage as other actors are flicking ropes to makes waves in yellow light. When in the middle of them, he panics, grabs his heart and falls. The ropes then cover Faust.\n\nMeno Forte’s shows are financed as international co-productions and are presented more often abroad than in Lithuania. One of its signature pieces, \"Hamlet\", actually precedes the group as it was first performed at the LIFE Festival in 1997, being performed there for five year in a row. However, the characteristics of this piece would define Meno Fortas, as it starred a Lithuanian pop singer in the title role and featured a huge, melting chandelier made of ice hovering over the scene. The piece has been performed by the group in nearly all of Europe’s main theatre festivals, winning many awards. \n\nMacbeth was created after the formation of the theater group, premiering in 1999. In 2001, Othello was first premiered at the Venice Biennale, followed by the first opera Macbeth at the Teatro Comunale in Florence. The three Shakespeare pieces, \"Hamlet\", \"Macbeth\" and \"Othello\" are heavily dependent on the performance of the actor in the title role. This reliance on a single main actor has forced the company to cancel shows when this actor cannot perform.\n\nOther productions include a version of Pedro Calderón’s \"La vida es sueño\" with the Compañía Estable of Colombia, Cornamusa, SA of Mexico and Teatro 4 of Argentina.\n\nIn 2003, the company created a production called \"The Seasons\", based on an epic poem by Lithuanian writer Kristijonas Donelaitis. In the same year, a production of Anton Chekov’s \"The Cherry Orchard\" was produced with Russian actors.\n\nIn 2004, the company produced a play based on the Old Testament called \"The Song of Songs\", and \"the Cherry Orchard\" received the top prize at the Golden Mask Festival in Moscow.\n\nIn 2005, two operas were produced called the \"Children of Rosenthal\" by Leonid Desyatnikov at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow and \"Boris Godunov\" at the Teatro Comunale in Florence.\n\nAnother major work by the group is called \"Faust\", base on the version by Johan Wolfgang. This piece has been performed for various years in various countries including the Festival Internacional Cervantino in Mexico. Another 2006 production is \"Valkyrie\", based on the musical piece by Richard Wagner, and which was staged at the Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theater in 2007.\n\nIn 2008, the company performed \"Anna Karenina\" at the Emilia Romagna Teatro in Modena and an opera called \"The Legend of Invisible city of Kitez\", at the Teatro Lirico di Cagliari and Bolshoi Theater.\n\nThe most recent production by the company include a large scale show based on Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s \"The Idiot\".\n"}

{"id": "51296636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51296636", "title": "Murder of Seth Rich", "text": "Murder of Seth Rich\n\nThe murder of Seth Rich occurred on Sunday, July 10, 2016, at 4:20 a.m. in the Bloomingdale neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Rich died from two shots to the back. \n\nThe 27-year-old Rich was an employee of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), and his murder spawned several right-wing conspiracy theories, including the false claim that Rich had been involved with the leaked DNC emails in 2016, contradicted by the law enforcement branches that investigated the murder. It was also contradicted by the July 2018 indictment of 12 Russian military intelligence agents for hacking the e-mail accounts and networks of Democratic Party officials and by the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion the leaked DNC emails were part of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Fact-checking websites like PolitiFact.com, Snopes.com, and FactCheck.org stated that these theories were false and unfounded. \"The New York Times\", \"Los Angeles Times\", and \"The Washington Post\" wrote that the promotion of these conspiracy theories was an example of fake news.\n\nRich's parents condemned the conspiracy theorists and said that these individuals were exploiting their son's death for political gain, and their spokesperson called the conspiracy theorists \"disgusting sociopaths\". They requested a retraction and apology from Fox News after the network promoted the conspiracy theory, and sent a cease and desist letter to the investigator Fox News used. The investigator stated that he had no evidence to back up the claims which Fox News attributed to him. Fox News issued a retraction, but did not apologize or publicly explain what went wrong. In return, the Rich family filed a defamation lawsuit against Fox News in March 2018,<ref name=\"Grynbaum_3/13/2018\"></ref> which was dismissed in August 2018, when a judge ruled that the plaintiffs failed to prove \"extreme and outrageous\" conduct by the defendants under the legal standard.\n\nRich grew up in a Jewish family in Omaha, Nebraska. He volunteered for the Nebraska Democratic Party, interned for Senator Ben Nelson, was active in Jewish outreach, and worked with the United States Census Bureau. In 2011, he graduated from Creighton University with a degree in political science. He moved to Washington, D.C. to work for pollster Greenberg Quinlan Rosner. In 2014 he began working for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) as the Voter Expansion Data Director. One of his tasks at the DNC was the development of a computer application to help voters locate polling stations.\n\nOn Sunday, July 10, 2016, at 4:20 a.m., Rich was shot about a block from his apartment at the southwest corner of Flagler Place and W Street Northwest in the Bloomingdale neighborhood of Washington, D.C.\n\nEarlier that night he had been at Lou's City Bar, a sports pub from his apartment, in Columbia Heights, where he was a regular customer. He left when the bar was closing, at about 1:30 or 1:45 a.m. Police were alerted to gunfire at 4:20 a.m. by an automated gunfire locator. Within approximately one minute after the gun shots, police officers found Rich conscious with multiple gunshot wounds. He was transported to a nearby hospital, where he later died. According to police, he died from two shots to the back and may have been killed in an attempted robbery, noting that the neighborhood had recently been plagued by robberies. Rich's mother told NBC's Washington affiliate WRC-TV, \"There had been a struggle. His hands were bruised, his knees are bruised, his face is bruised, and yet he had two shots to his back, and yet they never took anything... They didn't finish robbing him, they just took his life.\" The police told the family they had located a surveillance recording showing a glimpse of the legs of two people who could possibly be the killers.\n\nOn the day after the shooting, DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued a statement mourning his loss and praising Rich's work to support voter rights. Two days after the shooting, Hillary Clinton spoke of his death during a speech advocating limiting the availability of guns.\n\nIn September 2016, Rich's parents and girlfriend appeared on the syndicated television show \"Crime Watch Daily\" to speak about the murder case. In October 2016, a plaque and bike rack outside the DNC headquarters were dedicated to Rich's memory. In February 2017, the Beth El Synagogue in Omaha named after Rich an existing scholarship that helps Jewish children attend summer camps.\n\nThe Rich family accepted the \"pro bono\" public relations services of Republican lobbyist Jack Burkman in September 2016. The Rich family and Burkman held a joint press conference on the murder in November 2016. In January 2017, Burkman launched an advertising campaign in Northwest D.C. searching for information regarding Seth's death. This included billboard advertisements and canvassing with flyers. In late February, Burkman told media outlets he had a lead that the Russian government was involved in Rich's death, and the Rich family then distanced itself from Burkman. On March 19, 2017, Rich's brother, Aaron, started a GoFundMe campaign to try to raise $200,000 for private investigation, public outreach activities, and a reward fund.\n\nThe Rich family was approached by Ed Butowsky (a friend of Trump advisor Steve Bannon and a frequent Fox News contributor), who recommended having Fox News contributor and former homicide detective Rod Wheeler investigate Seth's murder. Butowsky said Wheeler had been recommended to him. The family gave Wheeler permission to investigate, though they did not hire him. When questioned by CNN, Butowsky denied involvement in the case, but later admitted he was involved and had offered to pay Wheeler's fees. After Wheeler asserted links between Rich and Wikileaks in a Fox affiliate interview on May 15, 2017—an assertion he later backpedaled from—the family spokesman said that the family regretted working with Wheeler. Wheeler then sued Fox News on August 1, 2017, for mental anguish and emotional distress, alleging that he had been misquoted in a story that was then published on the urging of Trump.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC) posted its customary reward of $25,000 for information about the death.\n\nOn August 9, 2016, WikiLeaks announced a $20,000 reward for information about Rich's murder leading to a conviction, although Rich's family said they were unable to verify this reward offer. WikiLeaks stated that this offer should not be taken as implying Rich had been involved in leaking information to them.\n\nIn November 2016, Republican lobbyist Jack Burkman said he was personally offering a $100,000 reward in addition to those announced by the police department and WikiLeaks, and he added another $5,000 to his offer in December and another $25,000 in January. Burkman said he hoped the money would help \"get to the truth of what happened here and will either debunk the conspiracy theories or validate them\".\n\nRight-wing conspiracy theories began circulating in the days following Rich's death, including false claims that his murder was connected to the DNC email leak of 2016, or the FBI's investigation of the Clinton Foundation. A post on Twitter before Rich's memorial service originated the idea that his killing was a political assassination. Subsequently, the conspiracy theory was spread on the subreddit /r/The Donald, and on July 29, 2016, the website \"Heat Street\" reported on these Reddit posts. Reddit users attempted to tie the homicide to prior \"Clinton Body Count\" conspiracy theories. The conspiracy theory was later popularized by Donald Trump political adviser Roger Stone via his Twitter account.\n\nAccording to British journalist Duncan Campbell, the Russian intelligence agency, GRU, tried to implicate Rich as the source of the stolen DNC emails, in order to draw attention away from themselves. Datestamps on the DNC files were altered to show the data had been obtained on July 5, 2016, five days before Rich's death, and the timezone was changed to Eastern Time, within which Washington, D.C. falls. Guccifer 2.0, the alleged GRU front that provided the emails to Wikileaks, then reported that Rich had been their source. Based partly on their acceptance of the false dates, some experts then concluded that the emails had been copied in the DNC offices, and had not been hacked from outside.\n\nJulian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, fueled the speculation in an interview with \"Nieuwsuur\" published on August 9, 2016, which touched on the topic of risks faced by WikiLeaks' sources. Unbidden, Assange brought up the case of Seth Rich. When asked directly whether Rich was a source, Assange nodded, then said \"we don't comment on who our sources are\". Subsequent statements by WikiLeaks emphasized that the organization was not naming Rich as a source. For context, Assange was well-known as a longtime critic of Clinton, and it subsequently came to light that WikiLeaks communicated with the Trump campaign over other issues, casting doubt on Assange's motivation.\n\nIn April 2018, Twitter direct messages revealed that even as Assange was suggesting publicly that WikiLeaks had obtained emails from Seth Rich, Assange was trying to obtain more emails from the hacker Guccifer 2.0, who was at the time suspected of being linked to Russian intelligence. \"BuzzFeed\" described the messages as \"the starkest proof yet that Assange knew a likely Russian government hacker had the Democrat leaks he wanted. And they reveal the deliberate bad faith with which Assange fed the groundless claims that Rich was his source, even as he knew the documents' origin.\" WikiLeaks' supporters on social media argued Assange's actions were consistent with WikiLeaks' mission.\n\nThese conspiracy theories were promoted by Mike Cernovich, Sean Hannity, Geraldo Rivera, Kim Dotcom, Paul Joseph Watson, Newt Gingrich, Jack Posobiec, and others.\n\nThe same venues that fomented the false Pizzagate conspiracy theory helped to promulgate the Seth Rich murder conspiracy theories, and each shared similar features. Both were promoted by individuals subscribing to far-right politics, and by campaign officials and individuals appointed to senior-level national security roles by Donald Trump. After prior coordination on Facebook, each theory was spread on Twitter by automated bots using a branded hashtag, with the goal of becoming a trending topic. Both the Pizzagate conspiracy theory and the Seth Rich murder conspiracy theory were spread in the subreddit forum /r/The Donald. In both conspiracy theories, the promoters attempted to shift the burden of proof — asking others to attempt to disprove their claims, without citing substantiated evidence. \"Slate\"s Elliot Hannon called the claims about Seth Rich a \"PizzaGate-like conspiracy theory surrounding Rich's death\", \"The Huffington Post\" described it as \"the 'alt-right' idiocy of Pizzagate all over again\", NPR's David Folkenflik said Fox News coverage of it \"evokes the pizza-gate terrible allegations utterly unfounded\", and Margaret Sullivan wrote for \"The Washington Post\": \"The Seth Rich lie has become the new Comet Ping Pong ... Crazy, baseless and dangerous.\"\n\nThe conspiracy theories have been debunked by law enforcement, as well as by fact-checking websites like PolitiFact.com, Snopes.com, and FactCheck.org.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia described the murder as related to a bungled attempted robbery, and said \"the assertions put forward by Mr. Wheeler are unfounded.\" The FBI told PolitiFact.com that the MPD was investigating the homicide.\n\nAssistant Police Chief Peter Newsham said the police had no information suggesting a connection between Rich's death and data obtained by WikiLeaks.\n\nPeople who worked with Rich said he was not an expert computer hacker helping to leak information to foreigners. Andrew Therriault, a data scientist who had mentored Rich, said although he had recently been working as a programmer, this \"wasn't his background\", and another co-worker said Rich was very upset when he heard hackers associated with Russian intelligence services had broken into the DNC computers and could be interfering with the election.\n\nRich family representative, Brad Bauman, responding to the conspiracy theorists' claim that the FBI was investigating the case said, \"The FBI is not now and has never been a party to this investigation.\"\n\nFactCheck.org analyzed statements by Newt Gingrich related to the conspiracy theory, where Gingrich said Rich \"apparently was assassinated\" subsequent to \"having given WikiLeaks something like … 53,000 [DNC] emails and 17,000 attachments\". FactCheck.org determined this claim was \"unsupported\" and determined \"there's no evidence for his claim.\"\n\nPolitiFact.com said the assertion that Rich gave emails to WikiLeaks is a \"baseless claim\", concluding \"Gingrich and others are talking about an unfounded conspiracy theory as if it's a matter of fact. It is far from it. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.\" In a separate analysis, PolitiFact.com concluded: \"There's no evidence there's any link between Rich and WikiLeaks. The FBI has indirectly denied investigating the case, which Washington police consider a robbery gone wrong.\"\n\nSnopes.com looked into the matter and stated: \"We were able to confirm the FBI is not investigating Rich's murder — it is an MPD investigation.\" Snopes contacted a spokesman for the Washington, D.C. mayor's office, who said, \"All claims made by Mr. Wheeler are false and take fake news to a whole new level. The family deserves better and everyday MPD continues to work diligently to solve this case.\" Snopes rated the claim \"DNC staffer Seth Rich sent 'thousands of leaked e-mails' to WikiLeaks before he was murdered\" as \"False\".\n\nThe fabrications were described as fake news and falsehoods by \"The New York Times\". \"The New York Times\" cited the conspiracy theories as an example of the persistence of false claims, concluding: \"fake news dies hard\". The \"Los Angeles Times\" called the conspiracy theories \"unsubstantiated rumors\".\n\n\"The Washington Post\" cited the conspiracy theories as an example of the power of fake news to spread virally online. The paper used the example as a case study of the persistence of fake news, and found that television news media can be a soft target for such false stories. \"The Washington Post\" further found that the proliferation of fake news via Facebook had decreased, but remained powerful on Twitter due to spread via online bots. They found that the conspiracy theories with the largest potential to spread on the Internet were those that held attraction for both the alt-right movements and the political left wing. \"The Washington Post\" concluded that even if a particular false story had been sufficiently debunked, such fact-checking was unable to stop the spread of the falsehoods online.\n\nOn May 15, 2017, Fox 5 DC (WTTG) reported the uncorroborated and later largely retracted claims by Rod Wheeler, a Fox News contributor and former homicide detective, that there was evidence Seth Rich had contacted WikiLeaks and that law enforcement were covering this up; claims that were never independently verified by Fox. The next day, Fox News published a lead story on its website and provided extensive coverage on its cable news channel about what it later said were Wheeler's uncorroborated claims about the murder of Seth Rich; in the lead story Fox News removed from their website a few days later, they stated that Wheeler's claims had been \"corroborated by a federal investigator who spoke to Fox News.\" In reporting these claims, the Fox News report re-ignited conspiracy theories about the killing. According to NPR, within a day of the original Fox report, \"Google searches for Rich had overtaken searches for James Comey, even amid continuous news about the former FBI director's conversations with Trump.\" \"The Washington Post\"s Callum Borchers noted Fox News chose to lead with this story at a time when most other media outlets were covering Donald Trump's disclosure of classified information to Russia.\n\nOther news organizations revealed Wheeler was a Donald Trump supporter, a paid Fox News contributor, and according to NBC News had \"developed a reputation for making outlandish claims, such as one appearance on Fox News in 2007 in which he warned that underground networks of pink pistol-toting lesbian gangs were raping young women\". \"The Washington Post\" noted it is \"rare for a news organization to have such a close relationship with the people it is covering\", as Wheeler was \"playing three roles at once: as a Fox source, as a paid contributor to the network and as a supposedly independent investigator of the murder\". When Wheeler appeared on Sean Hannity's Fox News shows, these multiple roles were not disclosed to viewers. After Wheeler's Fox News interview on May 15, 2017, Brad Bauman, a communications professional and spokesman for the Rich family, said the family was asking Fox News and the Fox affiliate to retract their reports and apologize for damaging their son's legacy.\n\nThe family spokesperson, the Washington, D.C. police department, the Washington, D.C. mayor's office, the FBI, and law enforcement sources familiar with the case all disputed Wheeler's claims. The family said, \"We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth's murderers.\" Bauman criticized Fox News for its reporting, saying he believed that the outlet was motivated by a desire to deflect attention from the Trump-Russia story: \"I think there's a very special place in hell for people that would use the memory of a murder victim in order to pursue a political agenda.\"\n\nLater that day, Wheeler told CNN he had no evidence that Rich had contacted Wikileaks. Wheeler claimed that Fox had presented his quotes misleadingly and that he only learned about the possible existence of the evidence from a Fox News reporter. Despite this, Sean Hannity's show and \"Fox & Friends\" continued to promote the conspiracy theory for the remainder of the week. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Geraldo Rivera took part in spreading the conspiracy. Hannity had on his program Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch, who said the organization filed Freedom of Information Act requests for documents from Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser, and from the Metropolitan Police. Sean Hannity furthermore promoted the uncorroborated claims of Kim Dotcom, a New Zealand resident sought by the United States on fraud charges who claimed without evidence that Rich had been in contact with him before his death. Fox News host Julie Roginsky was critical of the conspiracy theory peddlers, stating on Twitter and on her television show: \"The exploitation of a dead man whose family has begged conspiracy theorists to stop is really egregious. Please stop.\" Fox News was also criticized by conservative outlets, such as the \"Weekly Standard\", \"National Review\", and \"Red State\", and conservative columnists, such as Jennifer Rubin, Michael Gerson, and John Podhoretz. In September 2017, \"NPR\" noted that Fox News had yet to apologize for its false story or explain what went wrong; \"When a story of this scale crumbles, most news organizations feel obligated to explain what happened and why. Not so far at Fox.\"\n\nOn May 19, 2017, an attorney for the Rich family sent a cease and desist letter to Wheeler.\n\nFox News issued a retraction of the story on May 23, 2017 and removed the original article, and did not apologize or specify what went wrong or how it did so. Despite this, Hannity, who pushed the theory, remained unapologetic, saying \"I retracted nothing\" and \"I am not going to stop trying to find the truth.\" In their May 23 statement, Fox News said, \"The article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting. Upon appropriate review, the article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed.\" Media ethics writer Kelly McBride criticized the retraction as \"woefully inadequate\", writing that it did not specify exactly what was inaccurate, or provide correct information in place of the retracted story.\n\nOn May 23, 2017, Sean Hannity stated on his television program that he would cease discussing the issue. Hannity said his decision to cease commenting on the matter was related to the family of the murder victim: \"Out of respect for the family's wishes, for now, I am not discussing the matter at this time.\" In the same statement wherein he promised to cease discussion of the topic, he vowed to pursue facts in the future: \"I promise you I am not going to stop trying to find the truth.\" Several advertisers including Crowne Plaza Hotels, Cars.com, Leesa Mattress, USAA, Peloton and Casper Sleep pulled their marketing from his program on Fox News. Crowne Plaza Hotels later said that it was not their policy to advertise on political commentary shows, and had not been aware of their sponsorship of the show. USAA soon returned to advertising on Fox News after receiving customer input.\n\nOn August 1, 2017, Rod Wheeler, the private investigator hired by Butowsky who was the first to claim links between Seth Rich's murder and the DNC hack on Fox, but who later appeared to retract his claims, filed a lawsuit (Case 1:17-cv-05807 Southern District of New York), in which 21st Century Fox, the Fox News Channel, Fox News reporter Malia Zimmerman and Ed Butowsky are named as defendants, stating that quotes attributed to him in the original Fox News piece were fabricated. The lawsuit also alleges that the fabricated quotes were included in the Fox News story at the urging of the Trump White House.\n\nText messages and audio apparently supporting this assertion were included in the filing of the lawsuit. About a month before the story was aired on Fox News, Wheeler and Butowsky met at the White House with the White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer to review the planned story on Seth Rich's murder. After talking to Wheeler and Butowsky, Zimmerman sent Wheeler a draft of a story without any quotes from Wheeler on May 11. On May 14 Butowsky texted Wheeler saying \"Not to add any more pressure but the president just read the article. He wants the article out immediately. It's now all up to you. But don't feel the pressure.\" Butowsky also left a voicemail for Wheeler which said \"We have the full, uh, attention of the White House on this. And tomorrow, let's close this deal, whatever we've got to do.\"\nButowsky said Seymour Hersh confirmed a link between Rich and the FBI. Hersh confirmed the conversation with Butowsky but told NPR the link was \"gossip\" and that Butowsky exaggerated its significance.\n\nIn an email to Fox News Butowsky also wrote about the purpose behind the Seth Rich story: \"One of the big conclusions we need to draw from this is that the Russians did not hack our computer systems and ste[a]l emails and there was no collusion (between) Trump and the Russians.\" He also instructed Wheeler that \"[T]he narrative in the interviews you might use is that you and [Zimmerman's] work prove that the Russians didn't hack into the DNC and steal the emails and impact our elections (...) If you can, try to highlight this puts the Russian hacking story to rest.\"\n\nWhen the story aired on Fox News, it included supposed quotes from Wheeler and was written as if the accusations against the DNC came from him. Wheeler alleges that the quotes were fabricated and should not have been attributed to him.\n\nIn later recordings Butowsky told Wheeler that the claims being attributed to him were false but says that \"One day you're going to win an award for having said those things you didn't say.\" He also says \"I know that's not true, if I'm under oath, I would say I never heard him say that.\"\n\nJudge George B. Daniels dismissed this lawsuit in August 2018.\n\nIn May 2017, Seth Rich's brother Aaron Rich issued a statement saying, \"We simply want to find his killers and grieve. Instead, we are stuck having to constantly fight against non-facts, baseless allegations, and general stupidity to defend my brother's name and legacy.\"\n\nThe family spokesperson said \"At this point, only people with transparent political agendas or sociopaths are still perpetuating Seth Rich conspiracies.\"\n\nHis parents authored a piece in \"The Washington Post\" on May 23, 2017 titled: \"We're Seth Rich's parents. Stop politicizing our son's murder,\" in which they wrote:\n\nIn March 2018, Rich's family filed a lawsuit against Fox News, Fox reporter Malia Zimmerman, and Fox contributor Ed Butowsky, for publishing a news report about Seth Rich. The suit alleges that the report fueled conspiracy theories about Rich's death and caused the family emotional distress. Judge George B. Daniels dismissed the lawsuit in August 2018, stating that the case failed to prove \"extreme and outrageous\" conduct on the part of defendants, as that standard is determined under New York state law. \n\nAlso in March 2018, Aaron Rich filed a lawsuit against Butowsky, Couch, America First Media, and \"The Washington Times\" for suggesting he had played a role in the purported theft of emails from the DNC. On October 1, 2018, as part of a settlement they had reached with Aaron Rich, \"The Washington Times\" retracted the relevant articles and issued an apology to Rich and his family.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40899047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40899047", "title": "My Father and the Man in Black", "text": "My Father and the Man in Black\n\nMy Father and the Man in Black is a 2012 Canadian documentary film directed and produced by Jonathan Holiff about the stormy relationship between country music star Johnny Cash and the filmmaker's father, Saul Holiff, Cash's personal manager. It qualified for Oscar consideration in 2013. Holiff was inspired to produce the film when he stumbled on his father's storage locker filled with audio diaries and a large assortment of other documents relating to his time in the 1960s and 1970s as Cash's manager. The locker also included a framed gold record of \"A Boy Named Sue\" which went on display at the Grand Theatre during the running of their musical \"Ring of Fire\".\n\nThe film employs historically accurate flashbacks, starting with how Holiff met Johnny Cash when he hired him to sign autographs at his \"Sol's Square Boy\" drive-in in London, Ontario. Hollif went on to sign Cash to a number of other music gigs and Cash hired him to be his manager, with a contract written on the back of a paper napkin.\n\nThe film is narrated by Jonathan Holiff, interlaced with archival audio by Johnny Cash and Saul Holiff.\n\nThe structure of the film interlocks the relationship of Cash and Saul, and often pans to the relationship of Saul with Jonathan. His son often resented his father's time on the road. There is an emphasis of the rift between Cash and Saul, caused by Cash's status as a born-again Christian and Saul as an atheist, and how their relationship spiraled out of control. Variety.com comments on the unique structure of this film: \n\"Documentaries as expressions of filial trauma usually fail to generate audience empathy. But with its posthumous, anguished, first-person confessional revolving around the larger-than-life Man in Black this one partly transcends its inherent self-indulgence.\"\n\n\"My Father and the Man in Black\" has had mixed reviews from critics in the United States. The film has a \"Fresh\" rating (63 percent) on critic review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes. \"LA Weekly\" described it as a \"fascinating documentary\" despite what it called the \"warning signs of a vanity project\" Metacritic noted the fresh take on a documentary, saying: \"Refreshingly, My Father and the Man In Black does not slip into the realm of tabloid. It’s an intense personal adventure with universal themes and appeal that just happens to feature one of 20th-century music’s great icons\" On Roger Ebert.com, the movie was described as \"too damn interesting to be maudlin.\" A review in \"The Village Voice\" stated, \"heart and feeling is soaked through it like the sweat in Cash's guitar strap.\"\n\nThe film has been nominated and has won a number of awards on the film festival circuit.\n\nThe film garnered mostly positive reviews in other countries, particularly in the United Kingdom. \"The Financial Times\" called it \"a non-fiction 'Walk the Line' with script input by Eugene O'Neill.\" \"The Guardian\" said, \"finally, a fresh angle on the Cash mythology.\" A reviewer with \"The Daily Telegraph\" commented on the frequent dramatic confrontations between Cash and Holiff revealed in authentic audio of phone exchanges between the two. A reviewer from the UK website Film Forward stated that the movie is a type of answer song to the movie \"Walk the Line\" and it covers a number of themes not mentioned in \"Walk the Line\", like Cash's conversion to Christian fundamentalism at the peak of his career, the racism Cash faced by the KKK when they believed Cash's first wife was African American, and the antisemitism Holiff faced both growing up and in the early days of country music.\n\nThe documentary is considered among the most historically accurate films about Johnny Cash's career in the 1960s and early 1970s, and the often stormy relationship with his manager between 1958 and 1977. This is due to the fact that the film is driven by contemporaneous audio diaries and telephone calls, and hundreds of letters between the two men. A number of the movie props were genuine articles given to Holiff by Cash.\n\n"}

The museum has seven floors of galleries with permanent exhibitions focusing on photography, television, animation, videogaming, the Internet and the scientific principles behind light and colour. It also hosts temporary exhibitions and maintains a collection of 3.5 million pieces in its research facility. The venue has three cinemas, operated in partnership with Picturehouse Cinemas, including an IMAX screen. It hosts festivals dedicated to widescreen film, video games and science, and has previously hosted popular film festivals, including the Bradford International Film Festival until 2014.\n\nIn September 2011 the museum was voted the best indoor attraction in Yorkshire by the public, and it is one of the most visited museums in the north of England. the museum, in response to revenue shortfalls, has controversially adopted a policy of focusing on \"the science and culture of light and sound\"—to the exclusion of what are seen as \"unsustainable\" aspects of creativity and culture, such as past film festivals.\n\nIn March 2016 a £7.5 million five year investment plan in the museum was revealed by the Science Museum Group. In March 2017 its name was changed from National Media Museum to National Science and Media Museum.\n\nEntrance is free, with the exception of cinema screens. The museum is open 10 am until 6 pm every day. The museum underwent a £16 million refurbishment in 1998, developing a new digital technology gallery. This new development created a new glass-fronted atrium, which houses a new café and shop.\n\nThere are seven permanent exhibitions:\n\n\n\nThe museum incorporates the first permanent UK installation of an IMAX cinema (with a second screen opening in the UK 15 years later). Opened in 1983 as part of the Bradford Film Festival with the projector visible from a darkened booth of the 4th floor. Films included IMAX prints of \"Apollo 13\", \"The Lion King\", \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" and \"Batman Begins\". In 1999, IMAX upgraded the system and began releasing IMAX 3D presentations. In 2015 it was changed to digital projection instead of film. As a result, the IMAX projection booth is no longer visible.\n\nThe museum also incorporates the Pictureville Cinema – opened in 1992 and described by David Puttnam as 'the best cinema in the world ', Pictureville Cinema screens everything from 70 mm to video; from Hollywood to Bollywood; from silents to digital sound, with certifications in presentation including THX in sound and picture and the Dolby EX system. In 2008, the cinema presented the only true recorded public screening of Danny Boyle's 2002 film \"Alien Love Triangle\".\n\nPictureville Cinema is one of only three public cinemas in the world permanently equipped to display original 3-strip 35mm Cinerama prints, and is the only public Cinerama venue in the UK. Cinerama films are screened at the annual Widescreen Weekend film festival.\n\nThe Cubby Broccoli Cinema (in memory of Cubby Broccoli, producer of James Bond films), contains 106 seats and is used for a variety of film shows. In 2012, it was one of three venues in the UK to screen the Olympic Opening Ceremony in Super Hi-Vision.\n\"Insight\" is a facility where members of the public can (by prior booking) view parts of the collections which are not on general display.\n\nThe museum's collection contains 3.5 million items of historical, cultural and social value. Notable objects and archives include:\n\n\nThe collections are accessible to the public through the museum's Insight study centre.\n\nThe collection of the Royal Photographic Society was transferred to the Museum on behalf of the nation in 2003. As of 2017, most of the collection is moving to the Victoria and Albert museum in London. The National Science and Media Museum \"will retain collections that help explore the development of photographic processes, such as the Kodak collection; the cultural impact of photography, such as the Daily Herald archive; and archives that have a direct relevance to Bradford.\"\n\nThe museum occupies a site originally proposed for a theatre in central Bradford, for which work begun in the 1960s remained unfinished. Resulting from discussions between Dame Margaret Weston of the Science Museum, London and Bradford city councillors, the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, as it was then called, opened on 16 June 1983. The museum launched Britain’s largest cinema screen, IMAX, five storeys high with six-channel sound, on the same day. During this period the museum specialised in the art and science of images and image-making since Colin Ford, its first director, believed that understanding how images are made led to appreciation of the ideas expressed and the intentions and skills of image-makers. To mark the 50th anniversary of the first public television service, two interactive television galleries were developed in 1986. These allowed visitors to operate cameras on a studio set with programmed sound and lighting, use vision mixers, read a news item from an autocue and discover how chroma keying works.\n\nIn 1989, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of photography, the museum launched the Kodak Gallery, a display of the history of photography from its invention. This was followed by the installation of a standard television studio, first used by TV-am for outside broadcasts and, later, Nickelodeon. These studios were the first live broadcasting studios in a museum.\n\nWhile continuing to run the Pictureville Cinema and exhibitions in a temporary venue on the other side of the city, the museum closed its main site on 31 August 1997 to allow for a 19-month, £16 million redevelopment, making the museum 25% bigger. The IMAX cinema was also developed to show 3D films. The new museum was opened on 16 June 1999 by Pierce Brosnan.\n\nOn 1 December 2006, the museum was renamed the National Media Museum and two new £3 million interactive galleries were opened: Experience TV (now replaced by Wonderlab) and TV Heaven (now the BFI Mediatheque), dedicated to the past, present and future of television. The galleries displayed scientific exhibits, such as John Logie Baird's original apparatus, and television ephemera such as Wallace and Gromit and Play School toys. TV Heaven made accessible the museum's collection of television programmes, most of which are not available elsewhere.\n\nIn 2009 the museum partnered with other bodies from the Bradford district in a successful bid to become the world's first UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) City of Film.\n\nA major revamp of the foyer was unveiled in February 2010, including a brand new Games Lounge, a new gallery drawing on the National Videogame Archive established in 2008 in partnership with Nottingham Trent University. It was originally intended to be temporary but one in five visitors to the Games Lounge named it as their favourite part of the museum, resulting in the creation of a permanent Lounge in another part of the museum.\n\nIn March 2012 the museum opened Life Online, the world's first gallery dedicated to exploring the social, technological and cultural impact of the Internet. The permanent gallery was initially accompanied by a temporary exhibition, \"[open source]: Is the internet you know under threat?\" – an exploration of the open source nature of the Internet and the current threats to net neutrality and the continuation of the open source culture.\n\nIn October 2014 the museum entered into a partnership with Picturehouse Cinemas with the national chain taking over the running of the three cinema screens in a bid to boost audience figures and revenue. The partnership is designated \"Picturehouse at the National Media Museum\".\n\nDespite sustained growth in ticket sales, the museum cancelled its participation in the 2015 Bradford International Film Festival and followed up by totally withdrawing from the festival the following year. This move, together with the transfer of a major photographic collection to London's Victoria and Albert Museum, is very controversial.\n\nIn August 2016, the museum confirmed plans to permanently close their Experience TV gallery on 30 August 2016. The TV collection objects previously on display in Experience TV are now available to view by booking through the Insight centre at the museum.\n\nIn March 2017, the museum opened its £1.8 million interactive gallery Wonderlab – which replaces Experience TV – and announced its change of name to the National Science and Media Museum. Wonderlab is based on the principles of light and sound; attractions include a mirror maze, a 15-metre echo tube and a musical laser tunnel, as well as the world’s first permanent 3D-printed zoetrope.\n\nIn August 2017, it was announced that Soyuz TMA-19M – the space capsule that brought British astronaut Tim Peake back to Earth after his months-long stint on the International Space Station – would be displayed at the museum in September 2017. This was the first time the capsule had been displayed outside London.\n\nIn April 2018 the museum reported 505,000 visits in the 2017/18 financial year, a 25% increase on the previous year and the highest number since 2009.\n\nThis event began as part of Bradford International Film Festival and has been expanded into a 4-day standalone film festival. It takes place every October and focuses on large-screen formats and cinema technologies. It includes 70mm and Cinerama screenings.\n\nThis video game festival began in 2016. It celebrates games culture, design and production, and includes a conference programme as well as a weekend of events for families. It takes place every November. Guests at the first Yorkshire Games Festival included John Romero, Rhianna Pratchett, Charles Cecil, Warren Spector (via live video link), Brenda Romero, and presenters of The Yogscast.\n\nThis family science festival was first held in 2012, but was cancelled in 2016 after the previous organisers no longer had the capacity to carry it on. The museum took over the festival in 2017, in partnership with organisations including the University of Bradford, Bradford Council and Bradford College.\n\nThe museum organised and held four major film events every year: Bradford International Film Festival, Bradford Animation Festival, Bite the Mango and Fantastic Films Weekend. These attracted international speakers and new and classic works from around the world. All four festivals were eventually cancelled by the museum.\n\nFrom its inception in 1995, Bradford International Film Festival (BIFF) presented new and classic films from around the world. The Festival presented films in their original formats wherever possible, and existed to develop understanding of the art and science of the moving image by hosting innovators in many fields of filmmaking.\n\nBIFF included the Shine Awards – which highlighting the work of new European directors, a Filmmakers Weekend designed to offer guidance and support to filmmakers in the north of England, and the Widescreen Weekend, which discussed film formats including Cinerama, VistaVision, 70 mm and IMAX.\n\nGuests at Bradford International Film Festival included Riz Ahmed, Jenny Agutter, Michael Apted, David Arnold, Thomas Arslan, Ken Annakin, Olivier Assayas, Richard Attenborough, Simon Beaufoy, Alan Bennett, James Benning, Claire Bloom, Kenneth Branagh, Adam Buxton, Jack Cardiff, Ian Carmichael, Gurinder Chadha, Tom Courtenay, Mark Cousins, Alex Cox, Brian Cox, Benedict Cumberbatch, Terence Davies, Michael Deeley, Denis Dercourt, The Dodge Brothers, James Ellis, Mike Figgis, Freddie Francis, Terry Gilliam, Stephen Graham, Richard Griffiths, Ronald Harwood, Mike Hodges, Joanna Hogg, John Hurt, Derek Jacobi, Gualtiero Jacopetti, Terry Jones, Patrick Keiller, Mark Kermode, Mike Leigh, Euan Lloyd, Ken Loach, Malcolm McDowell, Virginia McKenna, Fernando Meirelles, Kay Mellor, Metamono, Chris Morris, Barry Norman, Michael Palin, Pawel Pawlikowski, Christian Petzold, Sally Potter, Godfrey Reggio, Menelik Shabazz, John Shuttleworth, Jean Simmons, Timothy Spall, Imelda Staunton, Eric Sykes, Julien Temple, Alex Thomson, Richard Todd, Danny Trejo, Roy Ward Baker, Peter Whitehead, Michael G. Wilson, Barbara Windsor, Ray Winstone, Stephen Woolley, Thierry Zéno and many independent filmmakers from around the world.\n\nOther special programmes included Bradford After Dark (new horror films), Alexey Balabanov, Stan Brakhage, Richard Burton, new Canadian cinema, Pierre Clementi, Alexander Dovzhenko, Hauntology, a centenary of Indian cinema, Chuck Jones, James Mason, Yoshitaro Nomura, Nicolas Roeg, sixpackfilm, American Teen Movies, Uncharted States of America (undiscovered American Cinema), Amos Vogel, and the science films of Charles Urban.\n\nThe animation and video games festival was the UK's leading event of its kind; host to discussions, workshops and special events. The annual BAF Awards honoured new animation from around the world.\n\nPast guests include representatives from studios such as Pixar, Aardman, Weta Workshops and Sony Interactive plus animators Ray Harryhausen, Richard Williams, Bob Godfrey, Caroline Leaf, Michael Dudok de Wit and Bill Plympton.\n\nAfter the museum ended the festival following its 20th edition in 2014, former museum staff successfully revived the event in Manchester in November 2015 as Manchester Animation Festival.\n\nThis festival began in 2002 as a weekend event focusing on classic ghost stories and the supernatural. It developed into an annual celebration of horror, fantasy and sci-fi cinema and television. In February 2013 it was announced that the Fantastic Films Weekend would not continue.\n\n"}

The music, originally in F major, is set for four singers. The words are probably by Mozart himself.\n\nThe work was written sometime between 1785 and 1787. On 2 September 1788, Mozart entered it into his personal catalog of works as part of a set of ten canons. Although some of the canons in the set of ten have serious (that is, religious) lyrics, K. 559a was meant for fun, a gesture of mocking, scatological humor directed at a friend of Mozart's, the baritone Johann Nepomuk Peyerl (1761–1800). The canon begins\n\n(\"Oh, you asinine Peierl; oh you Peierline ass\"). Later, the lyrics include \"O leck mich doch geschwind im Arsch\" (\"Oh lick me real quick in the ass (arse)\"), a favorite expression in Mozart's scatological works. For more examples and discussion, see Mozart and scatology.\n\n\"O du eselhafter Peierl\" was originally intended to be sung immediately following \"Difficile lectu\". For the tale of how these two canons originated, see \"Difficile lectu (Mozart)\".\n\nMozart later transposed \"O du eselhafter Peierl\" into G major, in versions that replaced \"Peierl\" with the names of two other individuals, named Martin and Jakob. There are other minor differences in words and notes.\n\nAccording to Link (2007), \"Martin\" was the composer Vicente Martín y Soler. Mozart scholar Alfred Einstein suggested a different hypothesis, that \"Martin\" was Philipp Jakob Martin, who served as impresario for Mozart's concerts in the Mehlgrube and in the Augarten. The lyrics of the revised canon replace \"Nepomuk\" (see above) with \"Lipperl\", a German diminutive form of \"Philipp\".\n\nThe autograph (original manuscript copy) of K. 559a has survived; it is a \"tiny slip of paper\" (Searle) on the reverse side of which is the original of K. 559. For discussion, see Difficile lectu (Mozart). The later G major version, K. 560, is also preserved and is currently in the Mozarteum in Salzburg.\n\nThe canon is perhaps the most often performed of Mozart's comic canons; performances have often used bowdlerized versions of the lyrics.\n\nZaslaw and Cowdury (1990) express admiration for the work, saying \"it makes brilliant use of imitative and hocket-like devices\" and \"possesses the clockwork-like vocal interplay of a well-wrought \"opera buffa\" ensemble.\"\n\n\n\n. The preface, in German, discusses the origin of the canon.\n"}

It is a four-day competition that occurs in early May at Brock University of St. Catharines, Ontario. Initially, the Conference was established as an extension of the National Junior Classical League (NJCL) but has since expanded and grown to become one of the largest and most popular conferences in Ontario, with over 500 students attending each year from 15-20 schools.\nThe conference is dedicated to the study of Classics; students compete in over 100 academic, athletic, and creative competitions all based on aspects of Classical life.\nIn addition to competitions, students also participate in different classically themed events, one of these being the \"Pompa\" (Latin for \"Parade\"). For this event everyone is required to dressed appropriately in classical attire, namely togas, and line up with their school to parade around the campus before attending a celebratory banquet and awards ceremony.\n\nThe OSCC is not affiliated with the Ontario Classical Association (OCA).\n\n\"The Ontario Student Classics Conference brings together students and teachers from across the province to promote and nurture a deeper understanding of the Classical World by providing opportunities to celebrate our Classical heritage through a variety of social events and competitions.

Produced and distributed by Universal Pictures, the film stars Nelson Eddy, Susanna Foster and Claude Rains, and was filmed in Technicolor. The original music score was composed by Edward Ward.\n\nThe auditorium set, a replica of the Opéra Garnier interior, created for the previous iteration was reused. Other than the sets, this remake had little in common with the earlier film. The original storyline was completely revised and there was no attempt to film the masked ball sequence, although the famous falling of the chandelier was re-enacted on an epic scale, using elaborate camera set-ups. It is also the only Universal horror film to win an Oscar, for Art Direction and Cinematography.\n\nViolinist Erique Claudin is dismissed from the Paris Opera House after revealing that he is losing the use of the fingers of his left hand. Unbeknownst to the conductor, who assumes Claudin is able to support himself, the musician has used all his money to help anonymously fund the voice lessons for Christine Dubois, a young soprano with whom he has fallen in love. In a desperate attempt to earn money, Claudin submits a piano concerto he has written for publication.\n\nAfter submitting it and not hearing a response, he becomes worried and returns to the publishers, Pleyel & Desjardins, to ask about it. No one there knows what happened to it, and do not seem to care. Claudin persists, but Maurice Pleyel rudely tells him to leave and goes back to the etchings he was working on. Finally giving up, Claudin stands there for a moment and hangs his head sadly. Someone begins to play music in the next room, and he looks up in shock when he hears it. It is his concerto that is merely being endorsed and praised by Franz Liszt. Convinced that Pleyel is trying to steal his concerto, Claudin leaps up and begins to strangle him. Just as he tosses the body of Pleyel to the floor, Georgette, the publisher's assistant, throws etching acid at Claudin. Screaming and wailing in agony, Claudin dashes out the door clutching his face. Now being hunted down by the police for murder, he flees to the sewers of the Opera. Claudin steals a prop mask from the costume department to cover his now-disfigured face.\n\nMeanwhile, Inspector Raoul Dubert (Edgar Barrier) wants Christine to quit the Opera and marry him. But famed opera baritone Anatole Garron (Nelson Eddy) hopes to win Christine's heart. Christine considers them both good friends but doesn't openly express if she loves them.\n\nDuring a performance of the opera \"Amore et Gloire\", Claudin drugs a glass of wine which Biancarolli drinks and makes her collapse and unable to perform. The director puts Christine in her place and she dazzles both the audience and everyone else with her singing.\n\nHowever Mme. Biancarolli, who suspects that Garron and Christine are responsible for drugging her, orders Raoul to arrest them but he says he can't because there is no evidence to prove her statement true. So Biancarolli sets a condition that she will forget the whole affair only if Christine's performance is not mentioned in the papers. Her conditions are reluctantly accepted, much to Christine and Anatole's dismay. The next night Claudin enters Biancarolli's dressing room and kills her and her maid. The opera is subsequently closed.\n\nAfter some time, the opera's owners receive a note demanding that Christine replace Biancarolli. To catch Claudin, Raoul comes up with a plan: not let Christine sing during a performance of the (fictive) Russian opera \"Le prince masqué du Caucase\" (“The Masked Prince of the Caucasus”) so as to lure Claudin out into the open, while Garron plans to have Liszt play the concerto after the performance. But Claudin strangles one of Dubert's men and heads to the domed ceiling of the auditorium. He then brings down the large chandelier on the audience causing chaos. As the audience and the crew flee, Claudin takes Christine down underground. He tells Christine that he loves her and that she will now sing all she wants, but only for him. But Christine doesn't recognize Claudin and is afraid of him.\n\nRaoul, Anatole and the police begin pursuing them underground. Just as Claudin and Christine arrive in his lair they hear Liszt and the orchestra playing Claudin's concerto. Claudin plays along with it on his piano. Christine watches, realizing the concerto was written around the melody of a lullaby she had known since childhood. Raoul and Anatole hear Claudin playing and follow the sound. Overjoyed, Claudin urges Christine to sing, which she does. While Claudin is distracted by the music, Christine sneaks up and pulls off his mask and sees his burnt disfigured face caused by the acid. At that same moment, Raoul and Anatole break in. Claudin grabs a sword to fight them with. Raoul fires his gun at Claudin, but Anatole knocks Raoul's arm and the shot hits the ceiling causing a cave in. Anatole and Raoul escape with Christine but Claudin gets crushed to death by the falling rocks.\n\nOnce they're safe, Anatole tells Christine that she and Claudin had come from the same town district, which explains why they both knew the lullaby. She responds by saying while Claudin had seemed a bit like a stranger to her she had somehow \"always felt drawn to him\" (an earlier version of the script had Claudin be Christine's biological father, who abandoned her and her mother—this explains his devotion and knowledge of the lullaby). Anatole finishes by saying that Claudin's madness will be forgotten, but his concerto will live on.\n\nLater, Anatole and Raoul demand that Christine finally chooses between the two men. She surprises them by choosing to marry neither one of them and pursue her singing career, because she now understands how much Claudin loved her and how much he was devoted to her singing career. She leaves the room and joins her adoring fans outside. The film ends with Anatole and Raoul going off to commiserate together.\n\nUniversal first announced a remake of \"The Phantom of the Opera\" in 1935. This version would have been set in contemporary Paris, and would have portrayed the Phantom as a psychologically wounded World War I veteran who was physically unharmed, but imagined that he was disfigured. The screenplay lingered in development until 1941, when Henry Koster was brought on board to direct. Koster discarded the previous screenplay, and envisioned a new version of the story in which the Phantom was Christine's father. Producer George Waggner ultimately fired Koster from the project and replaced him with Arthur Lubin.\n\nCesar Romero, Boris Karloff, Feodor Chaliapin, Charles Laughton and Broderick Crawford were all considered for the role of the Phantom at various points during production, before the role was given to Rains. Koster's subplot about the Phantom being Christine's father was jettisoned because it gave the romantic elements of their relationship incestuous overtones. During the same year that the film was released, \"Phantom of the Opera\" was adapted into an audio presentation for the \"Lux Radio Theater\". Nelson Eddy, Susanna Foster and Edgar Barrier reprised their roles, but instead of Claude Rains, Basil Rathbone played Erique Claudin. This presentation was produced and hosted by Cecil B. DeMille.\n\nEdward Ward wrote the score. The film has many elements of a musical, with lengthy opera sequences, and has been criticized for being more musical than horrific. For the opera sequences, Ward adapted music from Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 4 as well as using themes by Chopin. He also composed an original theme, \"Lullaby of the Bells\", which was heard in the film as the Phantom's piano concerto.\n\nContemporary reviews were mixed. Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" panned the film for being \"watered down\" from the original, calling the opening sequence \"the only one in the film in which the potential excitement of the story is realized,\" while otherwise the \"richness of décor and music is precisely what gets in the way of the tale.\" \"Variety\" called it \"a vivid, elaborate, and, within its original story limitations, an effective production geared for substantial grosses.\" \"Harrison's Reports\" called it \"a good entertainment, the sort that will direct an appeal to all types of audiences.\" David Lardner's review in \"The New Yorker\" dismissed the film, calling it \"by no means a sample of the march of progress in the film world. The old version had Lon Chaney, who scared you plenty, and the new one has Claude Rains, who somehow doesn't.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes gave this version of \"Phantom of the Opera\" an average score of 75%, based on 20 reviews from critics.\n\nFollowing the success of \"Phantom of the Opera\", Universal announced that a sequel would be made, titled \"The Climax\". Nelson Eddy and Susanna Foster were to return, along with Claude Rains as the Phantom, most likely meaning that his character survived the cave-in at the finale of the first film (indeed, in the final shot of the mask and violin atop the rubble, there is a sound of moving rock). The sequel, however, was later cancelled due to story troubles and problems concerning the availability of Claude Rains. \"The Climax\" was indeed released the year after \"Phantom of the Opera\", but it was not a continuation of the previous film and featured completely new characters.\n\nThe film was nominated for four Academy Awards, winning in two categories:\n\n"}

Its origin is unknown. A variant exists called Easter Eggs.\n\nThe game requires a seating area for the players (such as a flight of porch steps or a garden wall) which is designated the \"Pie Shop\" or \"Bakery.\" Also required are a Goal distant from the seating area such as a tree, post or other object, and an expanse of lawn or field for a chase similar to the chase in the game of Tag.\n\nOne player is chosen Pieman, another Buyer, and the other players are Pies. The Buyer is sometimes designated Simple Simon following the Mother Goose rhyme:\n\nTo begin the game, the Buyer is sent to the Goal where he cannot see or hear the other players. The Pieman then names each Pie with a common pie filling such as Apple, Blueberry, Pumpkin, etc. When all the Pies have been named, the Pieman calls the Buyer to the Pie Shop.\n\nThe Buyer demands, \"Pieman, Pieman, I would like a pie.\" The Pieman asks, \"And what might that Pie be?\" The Buyer then names a pie flavor such as Apple. If one of the Pies has been designated Apple, then he rushes from the Pie Shop to the Goal while the Buyer runs after him and attempts to tag him. Both the Pie and the Buyer must touch the Goal before running back to the Pie Shop. If the Pie returns to the Pie Shop without being tagged, he resumes his seat, and is renamed for another round. The chase may be complicated with dodging about lawn furniture, flower beds, clotheslines of drying laundry, or other obstacles in the path to and from the Goal.\n\nBefore the Buyer leaves the Pie Shop in pursuit of the Pie, he is required to pay the Pieman the price he asks for the Pie (such as 10 dollars). Payment is accomplished by slapping the Pieman's outstretched, up-turned palm, and counting aloud the required number of \"dollars.\" Paying the Pieman gives slower, or smaller Pies a \"head-start\" against the Buyer.\n\nShould the Pie be \"tagged\" during his flight to the Goal, he becomes the Buyer, the Buyer becomes a Pie, and play resumes in a similar manner.\n\nA variation of the game for children who may have limited knowledge of pie flavors is Easter Eggs. Here, players are given colors (red, blue, green, purple，etc.) rather than pie fillings. The Pieman becomes The Easter Bunny and the seating area the Easter Basket. Another variant is called Red Devil, where one child is removed from the group, and the kids are assigned colors (pink,yellow,blue) the child then returns and says \"Red Devil, Red Devil, may I borrow a crayon?\" the group then asks \"What color?\" and like pie the color chosen must try to catch the asker before the asker takes that person's seat.\n\nIn another variant, the Buyer is known as the Witch. The Witch says to the Baker: \"Do you have any pies today?\" The Baker replies, \"What kind do you want?\" If the Witch names one of the Pies, he or she must chase the named Pie around a designated spot, such as a tree or a light post. If the Pie gets back to the Pie Shop safely, the game begins again. However, if the Pie is caught, he or she becomes the new Witch. The Witch now becomes a Pie and sits with the others on the Pie Shop shelf and the game continues.\n\n"}

It depicts a fictional side-scroller video game, \"heavily influenced and inspired by anime, cult 1980s games such as Double Dragon, Bubble Bobble and R-Type, and Australian popular culture\" in which two male characters must fight their way through a building full of zombies, humans, giant grubs and octopuses to rescue a woman being held captive by the main antagonist, a pirate baby. The animation was created with Autodesk Animator and Adobe Flash, and contains considerable gore and some nudity.\n\nSponsored by Melbourne's Living the Arts program, it was first shown at the 2006 Next Wave Festival. It was released on the internet as a 113 MB MPEG video on April 20, 2006.\n\nThe fictional game begins with an introductory title sequence. There are five play levels, each with a boss at the end. The two heroes each have a preferred fighting style; one primarily uses a baseball bat, though he also uses Uzis at one point, and the other utilizes a variety of kicks. Numerous special attacks are used, including three which are specifically named:\n\nIt ends with credits and stills depicting events after the pirate baby is defeated.\n\nThe video was generally well-received, but considered inappropriate for children due to intense violence and some nudity.\nRobertson later made a second movie, \"Kings of Power 4 Billion%\", also featuring music by Wilczek. Robertson later became involved in the art direction for the videogame, \"\", based on the \"Scott Pilgrim\" series of graphic novels, which was released on August 10, 2010.

The player has the ability to choose the gender of the protagonist. For every gender there are three optional romance endings, for a total of 6 different romance endings.\n\nThe game received a score of 78/100 on Gamertell, with reviewer Jenni Lada writing \"\"Planet Stronghold\" isn't for everyone. It's a good game, but it's also quite challenging. This may dissuade beginners or typical visual novel players, who may not be accustomed to level-grinding characters, seeking out extra battles and carefully managing character equipment to keep everyone at their best.\" Mac Games gave 4 of 5 stars and wrote: \"The anime artwork is exquisite as always with great alien drawings. The instructions are clear and stats detailed.\" GameZebo gave 3,5 of 5 stars and wrote: \"If \"Planet Stronghold\" has a weakness, it’s that the story and characters in and of themselves aren’t especially interesting. The game isn’t poorly written or even poorly translated, it’s just a bit generic given the type of anime sci-fi fare that’s clearly influenced it. That doesn’t matter quite so much when the game is simply fun to play for its own sake, which it is.\" Ratings Per Game explained and criticized the flaws in parts of the games combat mechanics. Such as the music not looping, the Grenades not being able to stack, and obvious chosen one aspect with the Nelson family. However she stated it was worth playing if you could overlook the flaws in the story and mechanics. The artwork, while praised, did get criticized on the costume design.\n\nA sequel is in production stages.\n\n"}

In the lunfardo argot, \"quilombo\" means brothel; the word is used by Argentines (when profanity is tolerated) to mean \"bedlam\" or \"mess\". In this case, \"quilombera\" is used to describe the fact that football fans make a lot of noise and usually a mess of throwing confetti when goals are scored. On recordings, or when profanity is not tolerated, \"quilombera\" is replaced by \"bullanguera\" (\"rackety\").\n\nThis chant unites all of Argentina's supporters regardless of their club allegiance. It had its first heyday during the 1978 World Cup, played in Argentina, and is often the first song attempted by Argentine expatriates when the national team visits a foreign country. Usage has spread to basketball and volleyball teams, but not to the Los Pumas rugby union team (normally they use \"Yo te daré, te daré una cosa\" -\"I will give you/I will give you a thing\"-).\n\nThe other most popular chant among Argentine fans is \"Es un sentimiento ... no puedo parar\" ( [\"cheering\"])\n"}
