In a Yiddish accent, Brooks would improvise answers to topics such as the earliest-known language (\"basic Rock\"); manufacturing the Star of David (\"I employed six men, see, each with a point. They would run together in the middle of the factory, and in the great speed, they would fuse, thus creating a star. I would make two a day, because of the many ACCidents\"; manufacturing the cross (\"It was simple. I didn't know then it was eloquent! Two men run together … BANG! You got a cross! I could have fired four men!\"), and Joan of Arc (\"KNOW her? I WENT with her, dummy, I WENT with her!\").\n\nThe inspiration for the skit was a tape-recorded exchange between Brooks and Reiner at a party that took place at Brooks' beachfront house in Lonelyville, on Fire Island. The tape recorder was brought into the mix shortly after the opening salvos, as the two comics soon had the party audience in stitches. In 1961, when the duo began doing the skit on television, Brooks had just undergone surgery for gout. Because of his post-surgical discomfort, Brooks quipped, \"I feel like a 2000-year-old man,\" which led Reiner to begin questioning him about what it's like to be a 2000-year-old man and to describe history as Brooks saw it.\n\nBrooks and Reiner have released five comedy albums. The 2000 Year Old Man character appeared on one track for each of the first three albums, and the entirety of the final two.\n\n\nThe last in the series won the 1998 Grammy Award for Spoken Comedy Album.\n\nA half-hour animated television special, \"The 2000 Year Old Man\", premiered January 11, 1975, incorporating some of the original recordings. This special has since been released on VHS videocassette and DVD. The musical introduction was Bach's \"Sinfonia to Cantata #29\" performed on a Moog synthesizer by Mort Garson.\n\nAll five comedy albums were compiled and newly remastered on a 3-CD/1-DVD box set by Shout! Factory for the 50th anniversary. \"The 2000 Year Old Man: The Complete History\" DVD was released November 24, 2009, and features an interview with Reiner and Brooks; the 1975 animated \"2000 Year Old Man\" television special, and clips of the two appearing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" and \"The New Steve Allen Show\".\n\nMany of the jokes (especially the caveman jokes) were eventually brought to the screen in Brooks' film \"History of the World, Part I\".\n\nMel Brooks appeared as the 2000 Year Old Man to help celebrate the 2000th episode of the original \"Jeopardy!\" hosted by Art Fleming (February 21, 1972), in which the three highest-scoring undefeated champions at that point returned to play an abbreviated game for charities. During his pre-game appearance he recounted how the show was done 2,000 years earlier—\"It wasn't this hippy-happy-dappy game you've got here … the moment you walked out of your cave—Jeopardy!\" On the March 17, 2014 airing of the current \"Jeopardy!\" hosted by Alex Trebek, Brooks and Reiner read an entire category of clues as their characters.\n\nMel Brooks adapted the character to create the 2500 Year Old Brewmaster for Ballantine Beer in the 1960s. Interviewed by Dick Cavett in a series of ads, the Brewmaster (in a German accent, as opposed to the 2000 Year Old Man's Jewish voice) said he was inside the original Trojan horse and \"could've used a six-pack of fresh air.\"\n\nIn the episode of \"The Simpsons\" entitled \"Homer vs. Patty and Selma\", Mel Brooks appears as himself, riding in a limo being driven by Homer. After Homer incorrectly identifies the act as \"The 2000-pound man thing,\" he and Brooks engage in a brief sketch, with Homer playing the part of Carl Reiner. When Homer is pulled over by the police, Chief Wiggum offers to give Brooks a ride and says they can do \"the $2000-Man thing.\" Brooks agrees, but asks that he not play Reiner's part—\"I \"hate\" Carl Reiner!\" he says.\n\nIn the episode of \"Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip\" entitled \"The Option Period\", comedy writer Rick Tahoe uses The 2000 Year Old Man as an example of an ideal comedy sketch.\n"}

{"id": "3247598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3247598", "title": "405-line television system", "text": "405-line television system\n\nThe 405-line monochrome analogue television broadcasting system was the first fully electronic television system to be used in regular broadcasting.\n\nIt was introduced with the BBC Television Service in 1936, suspended for the duration of World War II, and remained in operation in the UK until 1985. It was also used between 1961 and 1982 in Ireland, as well as from 1957 to 1973 for the Rediffusion Television cable service in Hong Kong.\n\nSometimes called the Marconi-EMI system, it was developed in 1934 by the EMI Research Team led by Sir Isaac Shoenberg. The figure of 405 lines had been chosen following discussions over Sunday lunch at the home of Alan Blumlein. The system used interlacing; EMI had been experimenting with a 243-line all-electronic interlaced system since 1933. In the 405 system the scanning lines were broadcast in two complementary fields, 50 times per second, creating 25 frames per second. The actual image was 377 lines high and interlaced, with additional unused lines making the frame up to 405 lines to give the slow circuitry time to prepare for the next frame; in modern terms it would be described as 377i.\n\nAt the time of its introduction the 405-line system was referred to as \"high definition\", which it was compared to earlier systems, although of lower definition than 625-line and later standards.\n\nIn 1934 the British government set up a committee (the \"Television Committee\") to advise on the future of TV broadcasting. The committee recommended that a \"high definition\" service (defined by them as being a system of 240 lines or more) to be run by the BBC be established. The recommendation was accepted and tenders were sought from industry. Two tenders were received: one from the Baird company offering a 240-line mechanical system, and the other from EMI offering a 405-line all-electronic one. The Television Committee advised that they were unable to choose between the two systems and that both tenders should be accepted, the two systems to be run together for an experimental period.\n\nBroadcasting of the resulting BBC Television Service from its Alexandra Palace site began in November 1936, at first time-sharing broadcasts with the 240-line Baird system; however, in January 1937, after three months of trials, the Baird system was abandoned in favour of exclusive broadcasting with the 405-line Marconi-EMI system on VHF. This became the standard for all British TV broadcasts until the 1960s.\n\nIt soon became apparent that television reception was also possible well outside the original intended service area. In February 1938, engineers at the RCA Research Station, Riverhead, Long Island, New York, in the USA, were able to receive the BBC signal away, due to the signal being \"bounced\" back to earth from the ionosphere. A few minutes of programming were recorded on 16mm movie film. This is now considered to be the only surviving example of pre-war, live British television. The images recorded included two of the original three BBC announcers, Jasmine Bligh and (in a brief shot) Elizabeth Cowell, an excerpt from an unknown period costume drama, and the BBC's station identification transmitted at the beginning and end of the day's programmes.\n\nThe BBC temporarily ceased transmissions on 1 September 1939, the day of the German invasion of Poland, as war was imminent. After the BBC Television Service recommenced in 1946, distant reception reports were received from various parts of the world, including Italy, South Africa, India, the Middle East, North America and the Caribbean.\n\nThe BBC lost its monopoly of the British television market in 1954, and the following year the commercial network ITV, comprising a consortium of regional companies, was launched.\n\nIn 1964, the BBC launched its BBC2 service on UHF using only a 625-line system, which older sets could not receive. For several years BBC1 and ITV transmitted using the 405-line and BBC2 the 625-line standard; the only way to receive them all was to use a complex \"dual-standard\" 405- and 625-line, VHF and UHF, receiver. The introduction of colour on BBC2 in 1967 necessitated an even more complex dual-standard set to receive all three channels.\n\nIn November 1969 BBC1 and ITV also started broadcasting in 625-line PAL colour on UHF. As their programming was now entirely produced using the new standard, the 405-line broadcasts served only as a rebroadcast in monochrome for people who did not have the newer receivers. Thereafter, receivers were of a simpler single standard design which could not receive the legacy 405-line transmissions.\n\nOne reason for the long switchover period was the difficulty in matching the coverage level of the new UHF 625-line service with the very high level of geographic coverage achieved with the 405-line VHF service.\n\nThe last 405-line transmissions were seen on 4 January 1985 in Scotland; they had been officially shut down one day earlier in the rest of the UK (although they were actually switched off at various points the next day). This left only the UHF PAL system in operation in the UK. The frequencies used by the 405-line system were initially left empty, but were later sold off; they are now used for other purposes, including DAB and trunked PMR commercial two-way radio systems.\n\nIreland's use of the 405-line system began in 1961, with the launch of Telefís Éireann, but only extended to two main transmitters and their five relays, serving the east and north of the country. This was because many people in these areas already had 405-line sets for receiving UK broadcasts from Wales or Northern Ireland. Telefís Éireann's primary standard was 625-line; it began using this in the summer of 1962, more than two years before the UK had any 625-line channels.\n\nThe 405-line system was used in the Rediffusion Television cable television service in Hong Kong, established in 1957, making it both the first British colony and the first predominantly Chinese city to have television. The service of 405-line system ended in 1973, replaced by 625-line PAL system free-to-air broadcast.\n\nFor a brief time in 1939 there were experimental 405-line transmissions from stations in Montrouge in France and Eindhoven in the Netherlands Czechoslovakia and Switzerland.\n\nA few 405-line videotapes still survive. However, the majority of surviving 405-line programmes are in the form of black and white film telerecordings, usually with optical soundtracks. Occasionally video re-recording would be employed instead, with a 625-line camera pointing at a 405-line monitor. This preserves the original 50-field interlaced format, but with some geometrical distortions owing to the curvature of the CRT monitors used at the time.\n\n405-line programming may be recorded and played on an unmodified VHS or Betamax video recorder, as long as the input to the recorder is baseband rather than RF. Thus various modern video recordings of 405-line programming also exist. Betamax was sometimes preferred for this, as the Dropout Compensator could be switched off on certain models for use with PCM digital audio decoders.\n\n405-line is System A in the CCIR assignment of broadcast systems. The audio uses amplitude modulation rather than the frequency modulation in use on modern analogue systems. In addition, the system was broadcast in an aspect ratio of 5:4 until 3 April 1950, when it changed to the more common 4:3 format.\n\nAll System A transmitters used vestigial sideband transmission, with the single exception of Alexandra Palace in London, which closed down in 1957 when it was replaced by Crystal Palace.\n\nSince the mid-1930s it has been standard practice to use a field frequency equal to the AC mains electric supply frequency (or a submultiple thereof) 50 Hz in most countries (60 Hz in the Americas) because studio lighting generally uses an alternating current supply to the lamps and if these were not synchronized with the field frequency, an unwelcome strobe effect could appear on TV pictures. Secondly, the smoothing (filtering) of power supply circuits in early TV receivers was rather poor, and ripple superimposed on the DC could cause visual interference. However, the main problem was the susceptibility of the electron beam in the CRT being deflected by stray magnetic fields from nearby transformers or motors. If the picture was locked to the mains frequency, this interference would at least be static on the screen and thus relatively unnoticeable. The very earliest TV sets used a mains transformer; care had to be taken in design to prevent the transformer's stray magnetic field from disturbing the electron beam in the CRT.\n\nBecause an interlaced system requires accurate positioning of scanning lines, the horizontal and vertical timebase must be in a precise ratio. This is done by passing the one through a series of electronic divider circuits to produce the other. Each division is by an odd integer.\nTherefore, there has to be a straightforward mathematical relationship between the line and field frequencies, the latter being derived by dividing down from the former. The technology constraints of the 1930s meant that this division process could only be done using small integers, preferably no greater than 7, for good stability. The number of lines was odd because of 2:1 interlace. The 405-line system used a vertical frequency of 50 Hz (standard AC mains supply frequency in Britain) and a horizontal one of 10,125 Hz (50 × 405 ÷ 2 or, using the frame rate, 25 x 405), with 405 being derived from (3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 5).\n\nWhen used with vestigial sideband filtering, the total bandwidth of a 405-line TV channel is 5 MHz, significantly less than the 8 MHz required by the 625-line system I, which replaced it in Britain. Systems in other countries used anything between six and fourteen megahertz of bandwidth per channel.\n\nThe use of VHF frequencies combined with the narrow vision bandwidth (AM signals [at VHF low band frequencies] are less affected by noise as bandwidth is reduced) meant that 405-line signals could be received well even under marginal conditions. Therefore, it was possible to cover virtually all of the UK with a relatively small number of transmitting stations.\n\nThe use of AM (rather than FM) for sound and the use of positive (rather than negative) video modulation made 405-line signals very prone to audible and visible impulse interference, such as that generated by the ignition systems of vehicles. Such interference manifested itself as a loud popping on sound and large bright spots on the picture, which viewers found much more noticeable than the dark spots encountered when such interference is encountered on a signal using negative video modulation. With positive modulation, interference could easily be of similar amplitude to the sync pulses (which were represented by 0–30% of the transmitter output). The early time-base circuits were less able to discriminate between the signals and the picture would break up. By contrast, in negative modulation sync, pulses represent peak transmitter output (70–100% output). As a result, impulse interference would cause visual dark spots before it was large enough to affect the synchronisation of the picture. If the interference was large enough, the picture was probably unwatchable anyway. The later introduction of flywheel sync circuits rendered the picture much more stable, but these could have alleviated some of the problems with positive modulation. Almost all television systems that succeeded the 405-line system adopted negative modulation for this reason alone.\n\nThe AGC circuit was problematic. First-generation AGC merely detected the average value of the transmitted signal; however, due to the positively modulated carrier, peak power represented peak white – not guaranteed to be present. Thus for a completely black picture, the AGC circuit would increase the RF gain to restore the average carrier amplitude. The result was a screen that was not black but mid-grey. In fact, the total light output of early TV sets was practically constant regardless of the picture content.\n\nBy the mid-1950s, several manufacturers started to introduce gated-AGC systems to avoid this issue. A delayed pulse was derived from the recovered line-sync signal. This pulse would trigger a gate which would sample the received video signal during the \"back porch\" which was a guaranteed black-level transmitted between the end of the line-sync pulse and the start of the picture information.\n\nThe introduction of negative modulation in later systems simplified the problem because peak carrier power represented sync pulses (which were always guaranteed to be present). A simple peak-detector AGC circuit would detect the amplitude of only the sync pulses, thus measuring the strength of the received signal.\n\nThe 405-line system produced a noticeable 10,125 Hz whistle in many sets, equal to the number of lines per second. This high-pitched whistle was caused by magnetostriction in the line output transformer.\n\nThis is a common artifact in sets that use a cathode ray tube. While all CRT-based television systems produce such a noise, the higher number of lines per second in later standards produces frequencies (PAL's 15,625 Hz and NTSC's 15,734 Hz) that are at the upper end of the audible spectrum, which not all people are able to hear. Modern sets using plasma, LCD or OLED display technology are completely free of this effect as they are composed of a million or more individually controllable elements, rather than using a single magnetically deflected beam, so there is no requirement to generate the scanning signal.\n\nThe absence of equalizing pulses to facilitate interlace was defended at the start of the BBC service on the grounds that it only caused a lack of interlace with field synchronizing separators of the integrator type, and that there were, even at that time, numerous other circuits which gave completely accurate interlace without equalizing pulses. The question was raised again from time to time, but a series of tests, conducted during 1952 in cooperation with the British Radio Equipment Manufacturers' Association, confirmed that there was no general need for equalizing pulses.\n\nOn some larger TV screen sizes, the scanned lines were not fat enough to give 100% coverage of the CRT. The result was a lined picture with darkness between each horizontal scanned line, reducing picture brightness and contrast. Larger screen sets often used a spot wobble oscillator, that slightly elongated the scanning spot vertically at high frequency to avoid this line separation effect without reducing horizontal sharpness. Spot wobble was also utilised when making telerecordings of 405-line programmes.\n\nDuring the late 1950s and early-to-mid 1960s, some experimental colour broadcasts were made in the UK with the 405-line system using NTSC colour encoding (this encoding was a 1953 enhancement of the original 1941 NTSC monochrome standard, added to the NTSC standard so that it could also provide for colour broadcasting). The subcarrier frequency was 2.6578125 MHz (525/2 times line frequency) with an \"I\" signal bandwidth of 500 kHz and a \"Q\" signal bandwidth of 300 kHz. Tests with PAL, SECAM and other NTSC subcarrier frequencies were also attempted.\n\nSome of these broadcasts were on UHF (also an experimental technology at the time), while others were carried over the regular VHF network outside of normal broadcasting hours.\n\nAfter the U.S. adopted the NTSC 525-line monochrome standard for commercial broadcasting in 1941, subsequent efforts were made to upgrade the standard so that it could also accommodate a \"compatible\" colour broadcasting system. Eventually these efforts would prove successful, but because repeated attempts had consistently produced unsatisfactory results, in 1950 the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) officially approved for commercial broadcast an alternate 405-line broadcasting system which the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) had developed over the past decade. This system was a field-sequential colour system which electronically transmitted a 405-line monochrome picture. Colour was provided mechanically by means of a synchronized rotating transparent Red-Green-Blue disk, which was placed in front of the receiver screen. Regular broadcast channels were used to transmit the 405-line system signals, but the millions of existing NTSC 525-line television receivers could only correctly process the audio portion of these transmissions, so unless these sets were modified they would only display a jumbled picture.\n\nCBS aired a variety show special entitled \"Premiere\" on 25 June 1951 to officially launch commercial 405-line colour broadcasting, but just four months later CBS ended its colour broadcasts. CBS’s efforts were hindered from the beginning by a widespread lack of acceptance, and the ultimate setback came at the end of the year when the U.S. government temporarily banned the manufacture of colour televisions in order to conserve resources during the Korean War.\n\nIn 1953, the FCC rescinded its approval of the CBS 405-line colour system. In its place it approved a newly improved and now satisfactory second NTSC 525-line standard which had been developed by RCA. It provided for colour broadcasting yet remained compatible with existing 525-line monochrome sets.\n\n\nRobson, Neil, 'Living Pictures Out of Space: The Forlorn Hopes for Television in Pre-1939 London', \"Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television\", vol. 24, no. 2 (June 2004), pp. 223–32.\n\n"}

{"id": "4026652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4026652", "title": "ATSC tuner", "text": "ATSC tuner\n\nAn ATSC (Advanced Television Systems Committee) tuner, often called an ATSC receiver or HDTV tuner is a type of television tuner that allows reception of digital television (DTV) television channels transmitted by television stations in North America, parts of Central America and South Korea that use ATSC standards. Such tuners may be integrated into a television set, VCR, digital video recorder (DVR), or set-top box that provides audio/video output connectors of various types.\n\nAnother type of television tuner is a digital television adapter (DTA) with an analog passthrough.\n\nThe terms \"tuner\" and \"receiver\" are used loosely, and it is perhaps more appropriately called an ATSC receiver, with the tuner being part of the receiver (see Metonymy). The receiver generates the audio and video (AV) signals needed for television, and performs the following tasks: demodulation, error correction, MPEG transport stream demultiplexing, decompression, AV synchronization, and media reformatting to match what is optimal input for one's TV. Examples of media reformatting include: interlace to progressive scan or vice versa, picture resolutions, aspect ratio conversions (16:9 to or from 4:3), frame rate conversion, even image scaling. Zooming is an example of resolution change. It is commonly used to convert a low-resolution picture to a high-resolution display. This lets the user eliminate letterboxing or pillarboxing by stretching or cropping the picture. Some ATSC receivers, mostly those in HDTV TV sets, will stretch automatically, either by detecting black bars, or reading the Active Format Descriptor (AFD).\n\nAn ATSC tuner works by generating audio and video signals that are picked up from over-the-air broadcast television. ATSC tuners provide the following functions: selective tuning, demodulation, transport stream demultiplexing, decompression, error correction, analog-to-digital conversion, AV synchronization and media reformatting to fit the specific type of TV screen optimally.\n\nSelective tuning is the process by which the radio frequency (RF) of the television channel is selected by a receiver from within a band of transmitted RF signals. The tuner usually performs the function of frequency-agile selection, along with rejection of unwanted out-of-band signals.\n\nDemodulation means transforming the signal from the tuner into a usable signal that a TV set can use to produce images and sound without further consideration for the frequency at which it was transmitted. It is separation of a standard baseband signal from the RF carrier that was used to transmit it through the air (or down a coaxial cable or other long-distance medium.) ATSC as implemented in the US uses 8VSB modulation, which requires less power to transmit, as opposed to the also proposed COFDM modulation (used in European DVB-T, which is less prone to multipath distortion and therefore better received in mobile installations).\n\nIn the US, multiple digital signals are combined and then transmitted from one antenna source to create over the air broadcasts. By the reverse process (demultiplexing), an ATSC receiver first receives the combined MPEG transport stream and then decodes it to display one of its component signals on a TV set.)\n\nSince digital signals that are broadcast over the air are compressed (packed smaller), once they are received by the ATSC tuner, these compressed packets of digital data are then decompressed (unpacked to their original size). The ATSC system uses lossy compression, so while the decompressed data size is the same as the original compressed data size, the data produced is not exactly the same as the original data fed into the system at the transmitting site, but it is close enough that most people don't notice the difference.\n\nError correction is a technology that is used by the ATSC tuner to make sure that any data that is missing can be corrected. For instance, sometimes interference or a poor-quality signal will cause the loss of some data that the ATSC tuner receives. With error correction, the tuner has the ability to perform a number of checks and repair data so that a signal can be viewed on a TV set. Error correction works by adding some extra information to the signal before transmission that can be used upon reception to fill in gaps. Therefore, error correction has the opposite effect of compression—it increases the amount of data to transmit, rather than reducing it like compression does, and it improves the quality and robustness of the signal rather than reducing it. Compression removes redundant (and some non-redundant) data, while error correction adds some redundant data. The reason for using error correction rather than just using less compression and keeping the redundancy that was already there is that error correction systems are specially designed to get the maximum benefit out of a very small amount of redundant data, whereas the natural redundancy of the data doesn't do this job as efficiently, so with error correction the net amount of data needed is still smaller.\n\nAV synchronization is the coordination of audio and video signals being displayed on a digital TV in proper time. AV synchronization ensures that the audio does not lag behind the video that is being displayed on the TV set or vice versa, so that both audio and video are in sync.\n\nMedia reformatting is extremely important because the formatting of images on TV sets differs significantly according to the technology employed. For instance, some televisions have an interlaced picture, whereas others have a progressive-scan picture. Different televisions have a different aspect ratio.\n\nThe FCC has issued the following mandates for devices entering the US:\n\n\nIt should be noted that devices manufactured before these dates can still be sold without a built-in ATSC DTV tuner; the lack of digital tuners legally must be disclosed to consumers and most name-brand retailers have incurred onerous FCC penalties for non-compliance with these requirements.\n\nThe current regulations are specified in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).\n\nIn early 2006 the US Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 became law, which calls for full power over-the-air television stations to cease their analog broadcasts by February 17, 2009 (this cut-off date had been moved several times previously). On February 11, 2009 the mandatory DTV broadcast date was moved again to June 12, 2009, although stations were allowed to switch earlier. The delay enabled distribution of more coupons for purchase of converter boxes.\n\nSince June 12, 2009, TVs and other equipment with legacy NTSC tuners are unable to receive over-the-air broadcasts from United States TV stations, unless the broadcast is from a repeater or low-power transmitter. Canada had a similar analogue TV termination date set to September 1, 2011 (except in some remote northern regions).\n\nIt was feared that the US switch-off would cause millions of non-cable- and non-satellite-connected TV sets to \"go dark\". Viewers who did not upgrade, either to a television with a digital tuner or a set-top box, ended up losing their only source of television, unless they relied only upon the aforementioned non-full-power broadcasters. A Congressional bill authorized subsidized converter boxes in a way that allowed viewers to receive the new digital broadcasts on their old TVs. The actual transition proceeded smoothly with about 235,000 people requesting coupons after the June 12, 2009 transition date.\n\nTwo $40 coupons were made available per US address nominally from January 1, 2008 through March 31, 2009; each coupon could be used toward the purchase of one approved coupon-eligible converter box. The coupons expired 90 days after initial mailing and were not renewable. All households were eligible to receive coupons from the initial $990 million allocated, after which an additional $510 million in coupons was to be available to households that rely exclusively on over-the-air television reception. On January 4, 2009 the coupon program reached its $1.34 billion ceiling and any further consumer requests were placed on a waiting list.\n\nIn Canada, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) had set August 31, 2011 as the date where over-the-air analog TV transmission service would cease in 31 major markets of the country, including all provincial capitals, plus Ottawa (the National Capital), and most other major urban centers.\n\nAs of the end of 2008, there were 22 Canadian DTV transmitters on-air and all existing digital transitional television licenses explicitly proscribe as a condition of license, the broadcast of more than fourteen hours a week of programming not already on the analogue service. Unlike in the United States, there is no plan to subsidise ATSC converter purchases and no requirement that newly imported receivers decode the digital signal. Canadian retailers are also not required to disclose the inability of new equipment to receive DTV. The Canadian market therefore has been flooded with obsolete new NTSC equipment which lawfully cannot be exported to the US. A limited number of ATSC receivers are in Canadian retail stores as high-definition television (HDTV) receivers. ATSC CECB converter boxes were first carried nationally in October 2008, with chains such as Best Buy and Home Hardware offering limited selection at higher prices than in the US with no government subsidies. ATSC tuners may also be present in most recently manufactured televisions, as well as DVD recorders, HDTV FTA receivers and personal computer TV tuner cards.\n\nAs of the beginning of 2012, almost all Canadian broadcasters are now broadcasting an ATSC signal, with a handful of exceptions granted for low power and regional stations. These signals can be reliably tuned in most cities with a good indoor antenna and an ATSC tuner. US based ATSC signals can be reliably tuned with an outdoor antenna and an ATSC tuner in Canadian markets within 60 miles of the US broadcast towers. These markets include Toronto (from Buffalo), Windsor (from Detroit and Toledo), Vancouver (from Seattle and Tacoma), Montreal (from Burlington and Plattsburgh), Ottawa (from Watertown and Plattsburgh), Fredericton (from Presque Isle). Indoor antennas (both passive and amplified) are easier to install, but outdoor antennas are better at tuning stations from further distances.\n\nMost ATSC tuners have relatively simple on-screen menus, and automatically bring the user to a setup screen when turned on for the first time. This allows the user to pick the time zone and daylight-saving time mode (as all stations transmit time in UTC), and bandscan for stations. The scan \"listens\" on every channel from 2 to 69, and pauses when it detects a digital carrier wave. If it is able to decode the station, it reads its PSIP data, and adds its virtual channels to the channel map. If no PSIP is transmitted, the physical channel number is used, and each transport stream is enumerated according to its TSID (converted from hexadecimal), or starting sequentially at .1, .2, .3, and so forth, depending on the tuner.\n\nSeveral TV stations are using or have used a temporary channel to send their DTV signals, and upon terminating analog, move their digital transmission either back to their old analog channel, or to a third channel (sometimes the former analog of another local station), chosen in the digital channel election in the U.S. This requires all viewers to re-scan or manually add the new channel and possibly delete the old one. Doing a full re-scan will usually cause other channels to be dropped if they cannot be received at the moment the scan passes their physical channel, so this is typically undesirable, although many ATSC tuners only have this option. Some have an \"easy-add\" feature which does not delete what is already mapped in memory. Some allow the user to enter the physical channel and an unmapped subchannel, causing the tuner to search the physical channel. Depending on the tuner, this may or may not automatically add the station and its digital subchannels to the map, and/or to the user's \"favorites\". This may also leave the old \"dead\" channel mapping in place, so that there is the new 8.1, dead 8.1, new 8.2, dead 8.2, etc. In most cases, TV stations will not have the actual frequency they are currently using on their website. If the auto scan does not pick up the signal and the tuner has manual frequency scan capability try to get the actual frequency from the station engineer. This may allow one to stay on one frequency (channel) versus \"scanning\" (moving too quickly through) and allow one to make antenna adjustments while observing only a problematic channel.\n\nOther errors which appear to be in the tuner are actually the result of incorrect data sent by one or more stations, often including missing electronic program guide data. Many ATSC tuners will remember EPG info for each station, but only for a few hours after viewing a channel on that station. Some will not remember at all (displaying only the required channel banner), while a very few others will store data for days (although this requires staying tuned to each station for more than a few seconds in order to receive the extended info). DirecTV receivers with ATSC tuners can download the guide at any time, while other TiVo units download guide data separately. TV Guide On Screen can also be used for this, but very few if any ATSC tuners include this (which requires downloading all guide data for all channels from one particular station). Stations sending the wrong time are also a major problem, as this can skew or ruin guide data for all stations until correct time is received again from a different and correctly set station.\n\nEach digital OTA channel number is composed of a main number and a subchannel, for example 4.1, 4.2, etc. A dash is an alternate form of representation: 4-1, 4-2... The dot and dash are interchangeable; they both mean the same thing. The main channel numbers refer to the same radio frequencies as previously. However, now \"virtual channel\" (technically known as \"logical channel number\") numbers are common. So, Channel 4 digital signals may now actually be broadcast on channel 43, or any other frequency. When the ATSC tuner does a channel scan, it finds the signal on channel 43, learns that this material is called \"Channel 4\", and remembers that mapping. The user can tune to \"4\", and the tuner will know to tune in 43. Before a scan is done, it may be possible to access the programs directly by manual tuning, by entering 43-1, 43-2... After the scan, the programs would usually be accessed by entering 4-1, 4-2 etc., but it may still be possible to also access them directly at 43. If stations change their broadcast frequencies, it may be possible to access the new frequencies directly, but the usual procedure is to rescan all of the channels.\n\nA complete table of US station assignments is here:\nTentative Digital Television (DTV) Channel assignment\n<br>The actual channel frequencies are listed here:\nTelevision Frequency Table\n\n"}

It is loosely based on the novel \"Allan Quatermain\" by H. Rider Haggard. It is the sequel to \"King Solomon's Mines\".\n\nThe role of Allan Quatermain is reprised by Richard Chamberlain as is that of Jesse Huston by Sharon Stone, who was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress for this role, for which she lost to Madonna for \"Who's That Girl\". The movie also starred James Earl Jones as Umslopogaas, Henry Silva as Agon, Aileen Marson as Queen Nyleptha, Cassandra Peterson as Queen Sorais and Chamberlain's then real-life partner Martin Rabbett as Robeson Quatermain.\n\nAfter surviving their expedition to King Solomon's Mines, Allan Quatermain and Jesse have settled down in colonial Africa. They are engaged to be married and Jesse plans that they will travel to America for the wedding. But Allan is restless.\n\nA man chased by two strange masked men emerges from the jungle, and is recognised as one of Quatermain's friends. He is delirious and is cared for by Jesse and Allan, but at night, his pursuers return and kill him.\n\nBefore he dies, he tells Allan that his brother, supposedly lost, is alive, and that they have found the legendary 'Lost City of Gold'. Quatermain immediately starts preparing for an expedition to find his lost brother. Jesse is furious and stalks off, but then realises how important this is to Allan.\n\nAllan and Jesse are assisted by Umslopogaas, a fearless warrior and old friend of Allan's, to put together an expedition. Swarma, a spiritual guru, and five Askari warriors, accompany them. The group crosses the Sahara desert; two Askari are lost when Swarma trips a trap that opens a pit under the road to the city. Another member of the party is lost when savage Esbowe warriors attack the group. Many spears get thrown at Quatermain and his friends, but Umslopogaas deflects most of them by with his giant axe.\n\nQuatermain and his friends indeed discover the city. The inhabitants, both black and white, are friendly, and Allan meets his brother Robeson, seemingly in good health and at peace in the society. The city boasts two queens—the noble and beloved, Nyleptha and her power-hungry sister, Sorais. But the real leader is the evil High Priest, Agon, feared by all.\n\nAllan raises the population against Agon and Sorais, who musters an army to recover the city by force. Allan realizes that they can make all the weapons they need out of gold, which is mined by the population. The final battle ends when, atop the temple, during a lightning storm, Allan uses Umslopogaas' axe to channel the lightning and melt the gold (into liquid form) causing it to flow off the side of the structure and pour over the attacking horde, turning Agon and his army into gold statues.\n\nThe film was made simultaneously with its predecessor, \"King Solomon's Mines\", although it was released a couple of years later. Despite the tremendous liberties both films took with the source material, being more similar in tone to the \"Indiana Jones\" film series, \"Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold\" was loosely based, mostly, on the book sequel of Haggard's \"King Solomon's Mines\", entitled simply \"Allan Quatermain\". In that book, which depicts Quatermain's last adventure (although it's just the second in the series of novels), the character and his associates go searching for a lost white tribe in Africa, and end up involved in a war between the rival queens of the kingdom. \n\nAn opulent set was constructed for the film just outside Victoria Falls.\nThe film features just over half an hour of original music written by Michael Linn; for financial reasons, the producers reused material composed by Jerry Goldsmith for the first film (although Linn's score does use Goldsmith's main theme), supplemented with music composed for other productions from Cannon Films.\n\nThe score was initially released by Silva Screen in 1988 on a CD with cues from \"Manifesto\" (scored by Nicola Piovani), \"Making the Grade\" (Basil Poledouris), \"Doin' Time on Planet Earth\" (Dana Kaproff) and \"The Seven Magnificent Gladiators\" (Dov Seltzer); in 2009 it was issued on its own album by La-La Land Records. Cues in italics contain material composed by Jerry Goldsmith.\n\n\nThe film debuted at number seven at the box office during its first week, earning $2 million.\n\nIt was a box office disappointment, one of several that led to Cannon Films reporting a loss in early 1987. The other box office disappointments for the company included \"Assassination\", \"The Hanoi Hilton\", \"Over the Top\" and \"Street Smart\".\n\n\"I know it went through town pretty fast,\" said Richard Chamberlain. \"I know my family didn't like it much. My father was too ill to see it, but my mother said, 'Richard, the advertising was all wrong. They should have told people it was funny.' But I don't think it hurt my chances for other movies. I know a lot of people who do a lot of movies, and some of them are good and some of them aren't. Michael Caine's one example. He's wonderful in some movies and forgettable in others. I think as long as you're doing generally good work that you enjoy, things will be okay.\"\n\nAccording to Rotten Tomatoes, the film has received two positive and one negative review.\n\n\"The Boston Globe\" film critic wrote \" there's nothing new under the broiling afternoon sun. It's the same: washed-out scenery, stale dialogue and lackluster performances... Except for the presence of James Earl Jones doing a depressing turn as a native chieftain, \"Allan Quatermain\" is just for folks who don't mind mining for fool's gold.\" \"The New York Times\" said the film was \"of minor academic interest. Those who take the Spielberg special effects for granted are sure to learn a lot by watching these same tricks done badly... Fortunately, Richard Chamberlain is professional and then some, since the film would otherwise be virtually unwatchable.\" The \"Los Angeles Times\" said the \"movie seems largely aimed at fans who can't wait for the next installment of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\" Unfortunately, most of the battle scenes were... ineptly staged... Chamberlain has none of the breezy, irreverence that made Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones such a delightful hero. In his Banana Republic khaki duds and a bullet-proof undershirt, he exudes the dashing spirit of a game-show host. The rest of the cast is good largely for unintentional laughs.\"\n\nBased on a 19th-century novel that, though progressive for its time, reflected some racist attitudes, the film itself has been criticized for conveying some of these same racist themes. The book \"Africans and the Politics of Popular Culture\" provides a harsh critique saying it reached \"levels of racism unachieved since the 1930s.\" Though the film has been portrayed as a comedy and a satire not all critics have been satisfied that the racist themes are excused under this pretense.\nThe Cannon Group originally planned a trilogy of films, the third film to be an adaptation of \"She and Allan\" but this was ultimately abandoned after the extreme negative reception of \"Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold\", coupled with the financial difficulties of the company at that time.\n\nIn 2011, a new sequel was proposed by Menahem Golan called \"Allan Quatermain and the Jewel of the East\". The script was written by Golan and Richard Albiston and was to be directed by Golan himself. The plot concerned Quatermain attempting to rescue his daughter from Chinese treasure hunters in the Congo. According to the 2015 documentary \"Golan: A Farewell to Mr Cinema\", Richard Chamberlain had agreed to return as the title character but Golan died before the film began shooting.\n\nMGM released the film on DVD on February 10, 2004. A Blu-ray edition followed in March 2015.\n\n"}

It premiered on 28 August 1917 in Zagreb, making it the first Croatian fictional film.\n\nLike all other Croatian fictional films of the era, \"Brcko in Zagreb\" is now considered lost. The identity of Arsen Maas remained unknown until 2014, when it was discovered to be an alias of Ante Masovčić, previously known for his theater-related work, and for being a subject of a well-known painting by Miroslav Kraljević.\n\nBrcko, a provincial salesman (Arnošt Grund), comes to Zagreb and meets a diva from the operetta (Irma Polak). He takes her to various places, including a public swimming pool on the Sava, and buys her a new outfit. Brcko's wife learns about what is going on in Zagreb. She arrives in the city and finds the two sitting in a café. The wife makes a scene and sprays Brcko in the face with a soda water syphon.\n\n\"Brcko in Zagreb\" was a creation of a group of actors – Arnošt Grund, Irma Polak, Tonka Savić and Stjepan Bojničić – who were members of the ensemble of the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb, and had also performed in cabaret acts. They felt the time had come to shoot their first film. The film's screenplay was based on \"Alaj su nas nasamarili\" (\"They Played a Trick on Us\", 1912), a then-popular comedy play written by Grund, a Czech-born actor and theatre director known for his numerous comedic roles.\n\nThe film was produced by Croatia k.d., established in 1917 by Hamilkar Bošković and Julio Bergman, which was the first Croatian film production company. The actors performed virtually as amateurs, with almost no compensation.\n\n\"Brcko in Zagreb\" premiered on 28 August 1917 in Metropol Cinema in Zagreb (later known as Capitol Cinema and Zagreb Cinema), making it the first Croatian fictional film. It was shown in a number of cinemas across Croatia and was very popular.\n\nNo copies of the film have been preserved, and it is now considered lost, sharing the fate of all other feature films from the earliest days of Croatian cinema, none of which survived in entirety. All that is known about it is based on contemporary newspaper articles and advertisements, as well as several surviving stills.\n\nIn 2017, on the 100th anniversary of the film's release, the Croatian Post issued a stamp commemorating the event.\n\nToday, the main prize of the PSSST! Silent Film Festival, held annually in Zagreb since 2007, is named the Brcko Grand Prize, after the protagonist of the first Croatian silent film.\n\nThe identity of the film's director, credited as Arsen Maas, was accidentally discovered after being a mystery for almost a century.\n\nIn 2014, Croatian film archivist and historian Daniel Rafaelić visited a retrospective exhibition of Miroslav Kraljević, held in Modern Gallery in Zagreb. Under the painting titled \"Bonvivant\" – one of Kraljević's most important works – he noticed a legend which identified the subject as Ante Masovčić, also known under the alias of Arsen Mazoff. Rafaelić immediately suspected that Masovčić and Maas are the same person, and subsequent research quickly found strong corroborating evidence.\n\nAnte Masovčić (1889–1948) became friends with Kraljević in Paris, and was 23 years old when he posed for the painting. He wrote theater reviews for \"Obzor\", a Zagreb-based newspaper, and mingled with actors and artists. According to Tin Ujević, Masovčić was \"well-known in the theatrical and bohemian circles of Paris\". At the time of release of \"Brcko in Zagreb\", Masovčić was the secretary of the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb, which also employed the entire main cast of the film. In the last decade of his life, Masovčić worked as a diplomat. \"Brcko in Zagreb\" most probably remained his only film work.\n"}

The term is borrowed from the canter horse gait, which sounds three hoof beats followed by a pause, i.e., 3 accents in time.\n\nIn waltz dances it may mark the 1st and the 4th eighths of the measure, producing a overlay beat over the time. In other words, when a measure is cued as \"one, two-and three\", the canter rhythm marks \"one\" and \"and\". This rhythm is the basis of the Canter Waltz. In modern ballroom dancing, an example is the Canter Pivot in the Viennese Waltz. \n\nIn Vals (a style of Tango), the canter rhythm is also known as medio galope (which actually means \"canter\" in Spanish) and may accent beats 1 and 2 of the measure.\n\nThe Canter Waltz or Canter is a dance with waltz music characterized by the canter rhythm of steps. A 1922 dance manual describes it as follows: \"The Canter Waltz has been revived and presents an opportunity to show the use of \"direction\" in the straight backward and forward series of walking steps. This dance is walking to waltz time but walking most quietly and gracefully. There are two steps to the three counts of music. Step forward on 1 and make the second step between the 2 and 3 count. Give the first step the accent, although the steps are almost of the same value.

Kirchner accused the Clarín Group, \"La Nación\", \"Perfil\", and related media of having promoted their overthrow.\n\nThe president and most of her cabinet increasingly avoided press conferences and interviews with independent media, relying instead on Twitter, press statements, and public service announcements to communicate with the populace. Large media groups, particularly the Clarín Group, in turn opposed anti-trust laws enacted during her administration.\n\nCritics maintain that new legislation passed by the Congress would be selectively applied against dissenting media and journalists, while fostering a proliferation of supportive media. Supporters maintained in turn that media consolidation has become the greater threat to freedom of the press in Argentina and elsewhere in Latin America, and that measures such those abolishing media laws dating from the country's last dictatorship and rescinding criminal penalties for defamation and libel of the president, promote freedom of expression.\n\nOther press advocacy groups, such as the Argentine Journalist Forum (FOPEA) and the Committee to Protect Journalists, observed that the dispute polarized news media and public opinion to the point that accuracy and objectivity in the media itself had become jeopardized.\n\nThe conflict started in 2008, during a period in which the government was in open confrontation with the agricultural sector over a propose hike in oilseed export taxes. The Clarín Group, led by CEO Héctor Magnetto, strongly supported the sector, and their newspapers published articles that were considered favorable to the \"ruralists\" or \"chacareros\". At least one writer who worked for one of the conglomerate's dailies (Enrique Lacolla of \"La Voz del Interior\") was dismissed for submitting an op ed opposing the landowners' lockout of April 2008.\n\nThe president reacted with strong criticism of the role of media, questioning whether freedom of speech \"belonged to corporations or to ordinary citizens.\" The Government sent its \"Resolution 125\" to Congress, which after an 18-hour Senate debate, fell in a tie vote broken by the Vice President Julio Cobos in a surprise vote against the executive branch resolution.\n\nAnother source of contention with the government arose when the Clarín Group was denied regulatory support for the planned acquisition in 2008 of a controlling stake in Telecom Argentina, which would have given the media group a dominant position in domestic internet, television, and phone services. \"La Nación\" was likewise at odds with the federal government over an injunction issued in October 2003 that allowed it to continue in subsequent years to claim an expired corporate tax credit on payroll taxes paid; were the injunction to be lifted, a 280 million-peso (US$50 million) tax debt, including interest, would result.\n\nThe television broadcasting rights for all Argentine football league matches had been held by the Clarín Group cable channel TyC Sports since 1992. That contract was terminated by the Argentine Football Association in August 2009, and broadcasts of all league matches were made freely available as \"Fútbol para Todos\" (\"Football for All\"). These broadcasts were afterwards used to provide advertising for the government, and with the single exception of Iveco no advertisements from nongovernmental sources were aired after March 2010.\n\nIn October 2009, the Argentine National Congress approved Law 26.522, known as the \"Audiovisual Media Law\" but usually described as the \"K Law\" by the Clarín Group. The new law served to deregulate the television and radio industries which until then were still limited to the few channels created by the media law enacted in 1980. A series of five judicial appeals and injunctions prevented it from coming into force for almost a year. The Supreme Court ruled against one of those appeals, declaring that it created a precedent where \"a single legislator could not challenge an act of Congress, nor judges use their authority to stop the application of an entire law.\" The antitrust provisions of the law remained blocked subsequently via injunctions.\n\nA court ruling in December 2012 ruled that the Clarín Group’s television and radio licenses cannot be sold until the Argentine Supreme Court can rule on the constitutionality of articles 45 and 161, which limit the amount of licenses companies can hold and which establish a divestment procedure for companies who hold more than 24 cable television licenses and 10 free-to-air radio or television licenses. The Argentine government claims the Clarín Group has over 200 licenses; Grupo Clarín claims the number is 158. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld the constitutionality of the Audiovisual Media Law in its entirety on October 29, 2013.\n\nFrank LaRue, the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression, supports the new law, which replaces the law enacted in 1980 under the National Reorganization Process dictatorship, as \"an example for the entire continent.\" A majority of journalist respondents in a 2011 Argentine Journalism Forum (FOPEA) survey considered the new law a partial or even substantial progress compared to the previous one.\n\nMarcela and Felipe Noble Herrera are adopted children of Ernestina Herrera de Noble, the largest shareholder of the Clarín Group. It was suspected that they may be children of people murdered during the Dirty War. The President pledged to \"personally\" go to international courts to seek justice done if Argentine judges did not rule on the case.\n\nCharges of illicit adoption were not ultimately proven by DNA tests against the available pool of data, and the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo NGO, who advocated for these tests, celebrated that the case was at least taken up in court. Estela Barnes de Carlotto also considered that the case will remain open, as further tests will be done as new families submit blood samples. The Noble Herrera lawyers motioned instead that the case against Ernestina Herrera de Noble be closed, as happened with all the similar cases when the DNA tests gave negative results. The case was finally closed in January 2016.\n\nCable television reaches two out of three Argentine households, and is at the center of debate over the 2009 Audiovisual Media Law. The Clarín Group's cable TV unit, \"Cablevisión\", merged with rival \"Multicanal\" in 2007 and since then controls the majority of the cable market in Argentina, including a 90% share of cable households in Buenos Aires, Córdoba, and Santa Fe Provinces (the three largest); potential competitors have likewise been stifled by predatory pricing and by Cablevisión's control of 97% of the fiber optic cable mileage in Argentina.\n\nBesides the Media Law, the federal government has used its regulatory power over rates against Cablevisión; when Cablevisión and DirecTV intended to increase subscriber rates in March 2010, the Argentine government appealed. Subsequently, in August 2010, a Federal Judge supported the government decision and prevented the two companies from changing their basic rates. Cablevisión later disregarded a February 2011 order by the Federal Audioviual Services Authority that the INCAA, CN23, and TeleSUR networks be included in its lineup; children's programming channel Pakapaka was likewise excluded, but was added in May as part of the \"premium plan.\" A court ruling in June 2013 enjoined Cablevisión to reorganize its channel lineup and to include the hitherto excluded channels.\n\nPapel Prensa is the largest Argentine producer of newsprint. The company is owned by the newspapers \"Clarín\" and \"La Nación\", with a 27.5% share owned by the Argentine government. President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner alleged that the sale of Papel Prensa by the family of the late David Graiver in 1976 was done so by illicit means and in collusion with the dictatorship to take advantage of its use against other Argentine newspapers, as well as toeing the dictatorship line when covering the Dirty War in which up to 30,000 people were forcibly disappeared. The government presented a report, \"Papel Prensa: The Truth\", claiming that during the Dirty War, while being coerced, the Graivers were forced to sell Papel Prensa at a bargain price.\n\nShortly afterward Isidoro Graiver denied the charges, stating that the sale of the company took place while his brothers were free, and that their detention was not related to Papel Prensa but with their link to the \"Montoneros\" guerrilla group. He had made statements to the contrary one month earlier, and was therefore later accused of being manipulated by \"Clarín\".\n\nThe \"Nunca Más\" report, published in 1984 by the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons, contains no information about the Graivers being forced to give away their property. Michael Soltys, editor of the \"Buenos Aires Herald\" newspaper declared: \"Papel Prensa is an anachronistic holdover from the military dictatorship which should not continue any further into the 21st century; but not this way. It is not only that the government is at least as interested a party when it comes to controlling newsprint — if this control is established on such a mendacious basis, the Cristina Fernández de Kirchner administration is not so much seeking the truth as to be the owner of the truth.\" On same day of its announcement, the government sent the report to the National Congress and the Judiciary for further investigation.\n\nAnother source of contention between the government and its private partners in Papel Prensa is that production at the firm's San Pedro facility has been well below capacity and declining, leading to increasing imports of a staple considered one of national interest. A preferential pricing scale that allowed \"La Nación\" and the Clarín Group's numerous dailies to buy newsprint at a 25% discount while other dailies were charged prices based on expensive Chilean imports, was rescinded in 2010.\n\nOn April 2013 Congressman Carlos Kunkel presented a bill to expropriate the 24% of Papel Prensa, thereby raising the state's share to 51% and thus putting the newsprint maker under state control; the bill would dismiss all current board members and executives in Papel Prensa, and appoint new ones.\n\nFibertel, a Broadband Internet access provider and part of the Clarín Group, had its licence revoked in August 2010 by the government arguing that Clarín itself dissolved Fibertel in January 2009, merging the company with its TV cable network provider Cablevisión, and does not have a licence to provide Internet services by itself. The government gave a 90-day time limit to end operations and move current users to other providers. The case was taken to the courts to prevent \"Fibertel\"s closure, which would force 10% of the country's Internet users to change to a new service provider or get disconnected.\n\nMore controversy arose in September 2010 when the Government's Secretary of Communications office published a list of 389 Internet providers that could potentially replace Fibertel. The list, however, was totally outdated and resulted in only 22 companies still operating and only two \"Telcos\" with nationwide coverage: \"Telefónica de Argentina\" and \"Telecom Argentina\".\n\nJudge Ernesto Marinelli of the First National Court on Federal Administration Contentions was initially chosen to preside over the case, but declared himself in a \"conflict of interest\" because he was a Fibertel user. At the same time, the different factions in the National Congress were divided on the issue. Pino Solanas of the Proyecto Sur Party, for example, proposed that the country should have a new law to deregulate and promote all the communication services instead of regulating a single company.\n\nThe disputes over \"Fibertel\" and \"Papel Prensa\" took place nearly at the same time, and generated strong reaction from the international media. \"El País\" from Uruguay highlighted the confrontation between government and the \"Grupo Clarín\" media concern.\n\nCriticism of the Argentine government included an editorial by Mary Anastasia O'Grady from \"The Wall Street Journal\" who said that Kirchnerism is \"cracking down on the free press.\" Editorial comment from Spain's \"El País\" was of the opinion that Kirchnerism is \"using methods similar to those of dictatorships to keep its power\" by revisiting the \"Papel Prensa\" case.\n\nOther voices echoed a different view, including editorial comments in \"El Tiempo\" from Colombia, declaring: \"The government maintains that the company sells the paper to small newspapers at higher prices than those who buy \"Clarín\" and \"La Nación\" and considered these actions go against freedom of expression.\" UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression Frank LaRue also supports the new law; as does the world's largest federation of journalists, the International Federation of Journalists, whose director, Beth Costa, visited Martín Sabbatella of the AFSCA (the agency overseeing the Audiovisual Media Law) in August 2013 to express the IFJ's \"support for and commitment to the media law and the defense of freedom of expression in Argentina.\"\n\nIn August 2010, U.S. Department of State Deputy Spokesman Mark Toner declared that the Barack Obama administration is closely following the controversy and that concerns about press freedom are taken seriously.\n\nThe government has made increasing use of advertising during the Kirchner era. State publicity - at all levels of government - accounted for 1.8% of Argentina's 3 billion-peso (US$1 billion) ad market in 2003, but fully 8% of a 19.5 billion-peso (US$4.7 billion) ad market in 2011 - an almost twentyone-fold increase. The official budget for national government publicity in 2012 was 735.8 million pesos (US$160 million); the 2011 budget was $608.1 million (US$146 million). An administrative resolution increased that number by $4.7 million, a presidential decree added $112.8 million, and another administrative resolution allowed to use $10.2 million more. A General Audit Office (AGN) report showed that in 2009, the largely supportive \"Página 12\" daily and Veintitrés Group received 18% and 13% of these revenues, respectively; while \"Clarín\", \"La Nación\", and \"La Razón\" received 15%, 8%, and 5% despite their much larger circulation.\n\nAdvertising is not the sole venue used by the government to broadcast publicity. The nationalized soccer broadcasts, whose commercial breaks feature mostly state ads, are officially budgeted at $690 million (US$150 million). A presidential decree allocated another $38.5 million, that with a loan of $25 million to the Argentine Football Association totals $753.5 million (US$165 million). The Ministry of Economy has a special budget for this purpose of $42.8 million. Nor is criticism of excessive ad spending limited to the federal government; a leading opponent, Buenos Aires Mayor Mauricio Macri, had the city spend over $86 million (US$20 million) in publicity during the first quarter of 2012 alone, dwarfing the 8 million pesos spent on city health and education infranstructure combined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was followed by a 2007 sequel entitled \"Fear of Clowns 2\".\n\nLynn Blodgett, an artist with coulrophobia, has a nightmare in which she is a young girl and encounters a clown with a decomposing face after a car crash at a carnival. Lynn's nightmares have been getting worse since she filed for divorce from her husband, Doctor Bert Tokyo, who hit her upon getting the news, and is fighting for full custody of their son, Nicholas. One night, a shirtless clown (\"Shivers\") with black eyes and a battle axe gazes at Lynn's house, then walks away. In the morning, Lynn is told that a family living near where she was house sitting was massacred.\n\nAt a gallery exhibiting her work, most of which involves monstrous clowns, Lynn meets Tucker Reid, a roller coaster tycoon who purchases one of her paintings for $8000. Tuck invites Lynn to his office, and after the tour, the two are attacked by a mugger, Heston, but escape. Lynn is shaken by the attempted robbery, but brushes off Tuck's offer to stay at her house. Lynn answers a call from the gallery owner and faints after spotting Shivers standing on her patio. The gallery owner then calls the police, who later question Lynn and dismiss her story.\n\nAt the gallery, Lynn reluctantly accepts an offer of $20,000 to do a portrait of a man's father, a clown and convicted child molester. Elsewhere, Shivers is tormented by voices, which tell him that he will get better if he continues to terrorize Lynn. Lynn meets with Bert and his lawyer, who state that Bert not only wants custody of Nicholas, but also wants child support, and half the rights and profits to all the paintings that Lynn has created and sold since they married. It is also revealed that Bert has been out of work for six months, and has been lying about being preoccupied with his job.\n\nShivers stalks Lynn as she is walking with Tuck, and later murders Lynn's friend Amanda. Lynn is contacted by Detective Peters, who tells her about Amanda's death, and that he now believes her story about being scared by a clown, as grease paint was found under Amanda's nails, and in a colorful pattern on one of her windows. In a parking lot, Bert meets with Heston, who he has hired to kill Lynn so he can collect life insurance. Heston successfully badgers Bert into giving him more money, due to the complications caused by Shivers and the police. Bert visits Shivers, who is revealed to be Doug Richardson, a former patient of his, a sex offender with Leber's congenital amaurosis. Worried that Shivers will wreck his plans, Bert orders him to leave Lynn alone.\n\nIgnoring Bert, Shivers sends a party clown to Lynn's house to distract the guard, who he beheads, spotting Heston nearby as he does so. When Shivers leaves, Heston breaks into Lynn's home, and is shot with his own gun during a struggle with Lynn and Tuck, who had stopped by to check on Lynn. At the Tokyo residence, Shivers murders Bert, due to Bert trying to have Heston assassinate Lynn, and thus almost ruining Shivers's chance to be \"cured\". While the authorities are content with believing that Heston was Shivers, Lynn is unconvinced. Nevertheless, she decides to go out on a date to a theatre with Tuck to celebrate being paid $100,000 for the painting she was hired to do.\n\nShivers continues his mission of trying to rid himself of his schizophrenia through Lynn. He kills her boss, abducts Nicholas after dismembering his babysitter, and breaks into the theatre, where he butchers two employees. As Shivers pursues Lynn and Tuck, Detective Peters races to the theatre, having gotten an alert about a 911 call from it, and news that the DNA under Amanda's fingernails matches Doug. Shivers uses Nicholas to lure Lynn out, and as the clown is about to kill her, Tuck blinds him from a projectionist booth, incapacitating him long enough for Peters and other officers to arrive, and arrest him.\n\nLynn goes home, and has a nightmare about Shivers escaping from prison, and attacking her and Nicholas.\n\n\nThe film made its DVD debut on Feb 28, 2006 where it was released by Live/Artisan.\n\nCritical reception for the film has been mixed to negative.\n\nDread Central gave \"Fear of Clowns\" a 2½ out 5, and said that while the villain was intimidating and the film had \"a few ambitious twists and turns\" it was marred by uneven and inconsistent writing, and poor direction, though the website ultimately admitted that \"For horror fans, \"Fear of Clowns\" is definitely worth a look. The film hits its mark much more than it misses and all in all is a fun ride\". A 2/5 was awarded by DVD Talk, which wrote, \"Although it has a few tense moments and creatively creepy scenes, \"Fear of Clowns\" runs on way too long\" and \"There's some good stuff tucked away in the generally forgettable \"Fear of Clowns\" -- and I'll gladly admit that it's a marked improvement over \"Hunting Humans\" -- but it's just too dry and familiar a tale\".\n\nThe same grade was given by Bloody Disgusting, which wrote that the film was unfocused and overlong, and the characters largely two-dimensional, despite the solid performances of Jacky Reres and Mark Lassise as Lynn and Shivers, respectively. Arrow in the Head's Andre Manseau bestowed a score of 3½ out of 5, and summed up his feelings towards \"Fear of Clowns\" by calling it \"a decent low budget slasher\". Ain't It Cool News responded well to \"Fear of Clowns\" and its sequel, concluding, \"If you're patient enough to sit through some lulls and low fi rough edges, Kangas delivers some definite shivers with his \"Fear of Clowns\" series\".\n\n"}

Hewitt in turn recruited some of the cast and crew from Tamiment (an entertainment camp run in the summer), including the young Jonathan Tunick, then a Juilliard student, as co-orchestrator with Jay Brower.\n\nThe revue had its out-of-town tryout at the Shubert Theatre, New Haven, Connecticut starting on March 26.\n\n\"From A to Z\" opened on Broadway at the Plymouth Theatre on April 20, 1960 and closed on May 7, 1960 after 21 performances.

These properties allow a venue to be filled with haze prior to or during an event without creating an overtly distracting cloud. Haze typically has a substantially longer persistence (\"hang time\") than conventional theatrical fog. While conventional fog will hang in the air for several minutes, a haze effect filling the same volume of space can last upwards of an hour to several hours or more, depending on the size of the venue and the amount of ventilation.\n\nThe fluid used in haze machines to generate the effects are either oil or water-based. Most oil-based haze fluids use a mineral oil base, while water-based fluids use either a propylene glycol or glycerol base. Although both formulations of fluid are referred to as haze fluid, the different formulations are neither compatible nor interchangeable. Propylene glycol/water haze fluid is sometimes referred to as \"water based haze\" to avoid ambiguity. Describing the fluid as \"glycol\" might cause stagehands to use automotive antifreeze, which contains ethylene glycol, and unlike propylene glycol, must not be used for this purpose because of its toxicity.\n\nCrackers (also known as \"oil crackers\") were first developed in the 1960 and the fluid is usually, though not always, refined mineral oil. Crackers work by use of a spray pump powered either by electricity or compressed CO passing through a dispersion head into a fluid reservoir. The compressed air aerosols the fluid, dispersing fine droplets. Because the haze is mechanically generated, this type of machine does not require any warm up time.\n\nPump spray haze machines use electricity or compressed CO to power a spray pump connected to a mixing valve, which draws in and atomizes the fluid.\n\nPump hazers also includes machines which function in the same manner as a fog machine, pumping fluid into a heated chamber where it is vapourized to produce a cloud. Hazers which heat fluid to create an atmospheric effect only use mixtures of water and glycol or glycerine. Spray hazers which atomize fluid can use either a water-based or mineral oil fluid.\n\nSmaller volumes of haze can also be generated from aerosol canisters containing mineral oil under pressure. Although to the density of haze generated and the volume of space that can be filled is significantly smaller than that of a haze machine, aerosol canisters have the advantages of portability, no requirements for electricity and finer control over the volume of haze generated.\n\nUltrasonic haze machines use transducers submerged in a reservoir of fluid to create atmospheric effects. Although less common than some of the other technologies used to produce haze, ultrasonic hazers are promoted as generating their effects with much less noise than other technologies.\n\nFaze machines, or fazers, can also be used to produce a haze-like effect. These machines are typically fog machines with a fan built in front to disperse the output, creating a haze-like effect. These machines are typically considered more cost effective, with prices ranging from $100–$400 USD as compared to haze machines with prices ranging from $400–$1,400 USD.\n\nAlthough the atmospheric effect created by hazers produces a significantly smaller particle size, around 1 micrometre, compared to the effect generated by a fog machine (hence the finer composition of the \"cloud\"), the size of particle and effect varies by manufactures and type of fluid used. Because of this haze is far less likely to set off fire alarms than fog machines or larger smoke particles.\n\n\n"}

Outside of the holodeck, though she has been invited to the baby shower, Seven declines. Tuvok assures her that despite their mutual discomfort at such social situations, they are good for morale and encourages her to attend. Seven still decides not to go, and later discusses her feelings while seeing the Doctor about malfunctions in one of her Borg implants. The Doctor finds he cannot extract the implant, which reminds Seven that she is not fully human.\n\nSometime later, \"Voyager\" is knocked out of warp by a nearby explosion. Though the ship is unharmed, they investigate the source of the explosion and find it was from a warhead launched some distance away to a nearby beacon. Fearing that another warhead may actually harm the ship, Captain Janeway orders Seven to find a method to detect the warheads to give them time to evade them. Seven works with Icheb in the Astrometrics lab. She also continues to use the holodeck, the relationship with the virtual Chakotay becoming more romantic.\n\nSeven begins to have difficulty separating the events on the holodeck from that on the real ship; she interrupts Torres during a situation in Engineering to present her with a baby shower gift, mimics some of the behavior she had towards the holodeck Chakotay with the real version, and becomes short-tempered at Icheb. As a result, she fails to complete her assignment, and \"Voyager\" is rocked by an explosion from another warhead, closer than the last. Janeway speaks to Seven, seeing that she is distracted, and has Chakotay keep watch on her. Seven goes to the holodeck to break up with the virtual Chakotay, but she suddenly feels pain from her implants, and calls for the Doctor. The Doctor appears in the holodeck, sees the program that she is running, and then has her transported to Sick Bay. After some operations, Seven regains consciousness, and tells the Doctor she plans to delete that program; instead the Doctor encourages her that she just needs to find the balance between her personal life and her duties.\n\nSeven returns to Astrometrics and completes her assignment; they discover a series of warheads approaching \"Voyager\" but are able to safely evade them without damage to the ship. Later, the Doctor tells Seven that he believes her Borg implants had malfunctioned as a failsafe that triggered if a drone would ever gain back their emotions. He suggests he could remove them after a long series of surgeries, but Seven declines, believing it necessary to keep her focused on her duties. When she later encounters Chakotay, he invites her to a dinner party for the senior crew that even Tuvok is attending, but she declines and walks away.\n\n"}
{"id": "375202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=375202", "title": "Jim (comics)", "text": "Jim (comics)\n\nJim is a comic book series by Jim Woodring. It began in 1980 as a self-published zine and was picked up by Fantagraphics Books in 1986 after cartoonist Gil Kane introduced Woodring to Fantagraphics co-owner Gary Groth. The publisher released four magazine-sized black-and-white issues starting in September 1987. A comic book-sized continuation, \"Jim Volume II\", with some color, began in 1993 and ran for six issues until 1996.\n\n\"Jim\", which Woodring described as an \"autojournal\", contained comics on a variety of subjects, many based on dreams, as well as surreal drawings and free-form text which resembled Jimantha automatic writing. Besides dreams, the work drew on Woodring's childhood experiences, hallucinations, past alcoholism, and Hindu beliefs. It also included stories of recurring Woodring characters such as Pulque (the embodiment of drunkenness), boyhood friends Chip and Monk, and, in \"Volume II\", his signature creation Frank.\n\n\"Jim\" is made up of a variety of short comics, text pieces, and artwork. Most of the works are short comics based on Woodring's dreams. Some of the pieces are surreal parodies of advertisements in the \"Mad\" tradition.\n\nThe series began as a photocopied 12-page minicomic that Woodring self-published in 1980. The contents were drawn from Woodring's autojournal—a journal in which he recorded his dreams in comics, prose, drawings, and paintings. Fantagraphics Books co-owner Gary Groth began publishing the series; the four issues of the first volume ran from 1987 to 1990.\n\nMost of the contents of the first volume were reprinted in the book collection \"The Book of Jim\" in 1993. A collection of both volumes appeared in 2014 under the title \"Jim\", subtitled \"Jim Woodring's Notorious Autojournal\".\n\n\n\nComics critic Joe McCulloch stated, \"What Woodring did better than anyone was promote the idea that the subconscious, the imaginary, and the dreamtime state were perfectly valid terrains for autobiographical exploration\" at a time when the confessional work of Justin Green and the mundane stories of Harvey Pekar defined the range of autobiographical comics.\n\n\"Jim\" ranked No. 71 on \"The Comics Journal\"s list of the hundred greatest English-language comics of the 20th century.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "252919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=252919", "title": "Ligne claire", "text": "Ligne claire\n\nLigne claire (French for \"clear line\") is a style of drawing pioneered by Hergé, the Belgian creator of \"The Adventures of Tintin\". It uses clear strong lines all of the same width and no hatching, while contrast is downplayed as well. Cast shadows are often illuminate. Additionally, the style often features strong colours and a combination of cartoonish characters against a realistic background. All these elements together can result in giving comics drawn this way a flat aspect. The name was coined by Joost Swarte in 1977.\n\nHergé started out drawing in a much looser, rougher style which was likely influenced by American comic strip artists of the late 1920s and 1930s, such as Gluyas Williams and George McManus. However the precise lines which characterize most of his work, are firmly in place from early on (e.g.: the colored version of \"The Blue Lotus\" (released in 1946) is based on the original black and white newspaper version from 1934–35 and not redrawn). For Hergé, the style was not limited to the drawings but extended to the story: the plot must be straightforward. Much of the \"Brussels school\" started to use this style, notably Edgar P. Jacobs, Bob de Moor, Roger Leloup, and Jacques Martin, many of whom also worked for \"Tintin\" magazine.\n\nThe \"ligne claire\" style achieved its highest popularity in the 1950s, but its influence started to wane in the 1960s and was seen as old-fashioned by the new generation of comic book artists. In the late 1970s, it experienced a resurgence of interest, largely due to Dutch artists like Joost Swarte and Theo van den Boogaard, who had come up through the Dutch underground comics scene, as well as the French artist Jacques Tardi. Henk Kuijpers was also successful in his application of the style.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Yves Chaland, Ted Benoit, Serge Clerc and Floc'h relaunched the \"ligne claire\" style in France. This incarnation was a very stylistic and artistic variation, which the artists also utilized for illustrating posters and LP covers etc. Swarte dubbed this variant \"atoomstijl\" (\"atomic style\").\n\nContemporary use of the \"ligne claire\" is often ironic or post-modern. For example, Van den Boogaard used the simple, clear style to set up a conflict with the amorality of his characters, while Tardi used it in his \"Adèle Blanc-Sec\" series to create a nostalgic atmosphere which is then ruthlessly undercut by the story. A recent serious clear line artist is the Dutchman Peter van Dongen, who created the \"Rampokan\" series about the Dutch colonisation of Indonesia.\n\n\"Ligne claire\" is not confined to Franco-Belgian comics. British artists such as Martin Handford, Bryan Talbot and Garen Ewing; Norwegian artists like Jason; American artists like Chris Ware, Geof Darrow, Jason Lutes, and Jason Little; Italian artists such as Vittorio Giardino: and Spanish artists such as Francesc Capdevila Gisbert (\"\") have also used it.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1441840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1441840", "title": "Open mic", "text": "Open mic\n\nAn open mic or open mike (derived from the expression \"open microphone\") is a live show at a coffeehouse, nightclub, comedy club, strip club, institution or pub at which audience members who are amateur performers or professionals who want to try out new material or plug an upcoming show are given the opportunity to perform onstage. Typically, as the name suggests, the performer is provided with a microphone which is plugged into a PA system, to make the individual's performance loud enough for the audience to hear. Often the performers sign up in advance for a time slot with the host or master of ceremonies, typically an experienced performer or the venue manager or owner. The master of ceremonies may screen potential candidates for suitability for the venue and give individuals a time to perform in the show. These events are focused on performance arts like poetry and spoken word, music (often singer-songwriters who accompany themselves on guitar), and comedy. Less commonly, small groups, such as a small rock band duo/trio or a comedy duo may appear. Group performances are uncommon, because of the space and the logistics of loading in and soundchecking such a group. In strip club terms, amateur night is a contest for everyday women and men who compete for a cash prize by taking their clothes off just like everyday strippers.\n\nOpen mic nights may have no cover charge, or a very low cover charge, although the venue may have a gratuity jar or \"pass the hat\" for donations. Venues that have no charge make revenue from selling alcoholic beverages and food. The performers are not typically paid, although the venue may recompense the performers with a beverage or meal. The host or MC, as an experienced professional, is usually paid for her/his services. The host or MC may perform at some point during the evening, either a full set or to fill in when an amateur member is not available for her/his slot. Open mic events are somewhat related to jam sessions, in that in both cases amateur performers are given the opportunity to sing or play instruments. The difference is that jam sessions often involve musical ensembles, possibly even a house band or rhythm section and a jam session may involve the participation of professional performers, especially at a high-end jazz club.\n\nPoetry and spoken word open mics feature a host, who is normally a poet or spoken word artist, poets and spoken word artists, and audience members. A sign-up is done before the show begins, so that the host has a list of names to call from. Some spoken word artists use pseudonyms or stage names when they perform. Poetry/spoken word open mics range from laid back, serene settings to lively sessions where readers and/or performers compete for audience applause. They are usually held in libraries, coffee houses, cafes, bookstores and bars.\n\nEach poet or spoken word artist is often asked to keep their performances to a minimum/specified time slot, giving each performer enough time to share some of their work with the audience. The host or MC acts as a \"gatekeeper\", determining which performers are suitable for the event. If a performer goes over their time limit, the host diplomatically thanks the performer for their contribution and asks them to yield the stage for the next performer.\n\nComedy open mic nights can be held at established comedy clubs, but are more commonly held at other venues with or without a stage, often the upstairs or back room of a pub or bar. Such nights give newer or emerging comedians an opportunity to practice and improve, with a view to getting paid work in the future. More experienced comedians may use open mics as an opportunity to work out newer material or a new character, as the audience is not paying in anticipation of seeing their normal act. In a typical open mic night, newer acts will get three or maybe five minutes of stage time, but more experienced acts may get ten or more minutes.\n\nThere are booked shows, regular open mics and \"bringer\" shows. A booked show is usually booked week in advance with some lottery spots selected by pulling candidates' names from a hat. With a regular open mic, a person puts their name on the list and they go on when their name is called by the host. With a \"bringer\" show, each performer has to bring a certain number of people (friends, family members, etc.) to get on stage. Open mic shows may have no cover charge, a reduced cover charge, or a minimum drink requirement. Open mic comedy nights are most widespread in larger English-speaking cities with a well-established stand-up comedy scene, especially London and New York. In these cities, with a plethora of aspiring comedians, the greatest challenge may be in attracting an audience.\n\nThese shows provide an opportunity for emerging musicians to gain experience performing to a live audience without having to go through the process of getting normal music gigs, which is very difficult to do without experience or a demo recording. Open mics provide an outlet for singer-songwriters. Prior to their popularity, the only outlet generally were folk clubs, which were not always friendly towards creators of new music, preferring traditional, well-known music. They also suggested that music performed by acoustic musicians or solo artists in this manner would necessarily be folk music, a misconception that still commonly exists today. Some organizers have chosen the title \"acoustic night\" or \"acoustic club\" in an attempt to indicate an event run broadly on the lines of a folk club, but with a much wider range of musical styles.\n\nOpen mic events are most commonly held in the middle of the week or at the very end of the weekend when footfall through venues is low. They rarely occur on the hallowed Friday and Saturday night time slots when venues are busy with weekend revellers and any live performance is usually specifically booked, professional artists. The most common night for a UK open mic event is Thursday, followed by Wednesday.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the largest ongoing open mic-styled music contest is Open Mic UK, which regularly attracts 10,000 participants of all genres. The grand prize for the contest is an investment up to £30,000. The size of the event has necessitated that all participants sign up for performance slots beforehand, instead of simply walking onstage.\n\nA popular open mic arrangement in the United States is the \"Blues Night\". In this format a bar or club will dedicate a particular night, usually in the middle of the week, as being \"open mic blues night\". The establishment may supply a house band, typically guitar, bass and drums, sometimes a keyboard. Singers, guitarists, harmonica performers who wish to play sign up, usually with the master-of-ceremonies or host. This person is tasked with screening the performers, choosing and ordering, and getting the performers on and off stage in a polite manner.\n\nSince the songs chosen need to be simple enough so that a band of musicians who have not played together can perform them without practice, blues standards are used. Songs might be announced as a \"12-bar fast shuffle in C\" or \"slow 12-bar blues in F\", or similar phrases, that should be familiar to all concerned. Lead singers, keyboards, horn players, (usually saxophones) and various percussion instruments are common additions.\n\nIn most strip clubs, amateur night is a contest held by the clubs themselves where women and men compete for cash by stripping just like their stripper counterparts.\n\nThe terms \"open deck\" (where \"deck\" refers to the kind of turntable used by a DJ) and \"open reel\" (where \"reel\" refers to a 35 mm film reel) are used for more niche open mic events where keen amateurs can meet to exhibit and critique their skills/artform. A decrease in the cost of consumer video technology combined with the powerful editing capabilities of modern PCs has caused an increase in the popularity of DJing and amateur filmmaking, but these types of events are still very rare.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32427039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32427039", "title": "Oz the Great and Powerful", "text": "Oz the Great and Powerful\n\nOz the Great and Powerful is a 2013 American fantasy film directed by Sam Raimi and written by David Lindsay-Abaire and Mitchell Kapner. Based on L. Frank Baum's \"Oz\" novels and set 20 years before the events of the original novel, the film is a spiritual prequel to the 1939 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film \"The Wizard of Oz\". Starring James Franco, Michelle Williams, Rachel Weisz, Mila Kunis, Zach Braff, Bill Cobbs, Joey King and Tony Cox, the film tells the story of Oscar Diggs, a deceptive magician who arrives in the Land of Oz and encounters three witches: Theodora, Evanora and Glinda. Oscar is then enlisted to restore order in Oz while struggling to resolve conflicts with the witches and himself.\n\nKapner began developing an origin story for the Wizard of Oz after a lifelong interest of wanting to create one for the character. Walt Disney Pictures then commissioned the film's production in 2009 with Joe Roth as producer and Grant Curtis, Joshua Donen, Philip Steuer and Palak Patel serving as executive producers. Raimi was hired to direct the following year. After Robert Downey Jr. and Johnny Depp declined the titular role, Franco was cast in February 2011 with principal photography commencing five months later. Danny Elfman composed the film's score.\n\n\"Oz the Great and Powerful\" premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on February 14, 2013 followed by a general theatrical release on March 8, 2013 in Disney Digital 3-D, RealD 3D and IMAX 3D formats. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film grossed over $493 million worldwide against a $200 million budget, making it the 13th-highest-grossing film of 2013. The film won the Phoenix Film Critics Society Award for Best Live Action Family Film and Kunis won the 2014 MTV Movie Award for Best Villain for her performance as the Wicked Witch of the West.\n\nIn 1905 Kansas, Oscar Diggs is a magician and con artist working for a traveling circus. As a storm approaches, the circus strongman learns that Oscar has flirted with his wife and threatens him. Oscar promptly escapes in a hot air balloon, but is sucked into a tornado that takes him to the Land of Oz. There he encounters the beautiful and naïve witch Theodora, who believes him to be the wizard prophesied to become King of Oz by destroying the Wicked Witch who killed the previous king. The idea of being a wealthy monarch makes Oscar accept the role. En route to the Emerald City, Theodora falls in love with Oscar though he does not reciprocate her feelings. They then encounter the flying monkey Finley who pledges a life debt to Oscar when he saves him from a lion. Oscar reveals his deception to Finley and forces him to maintain the lie that he is really a wizard.\n\nAt the Emerald City Theodora's beautiful older sister Evanora tells Oscar that the Wicked Witch resides in the Dark Forest and can be killed by destroying her wand. On the way to the forest they are joined by China Girl, a living china doll whose village and family were destroyed by the Wicked Witch. The three reach the forest and discover the \"Wicked Witch\" is the late king's daughter Glinda the Good Witch, and Evanora is the true Wicked Witch. Evanora sees this with her crystal ball and tricks Theodora into thinking Oscar is trying to court all three witches at once. She offers Theodora a magic apple \"to remove her heartache\" but it turns her into a hideous green-skinned witch.\n\nGlinda brings Oscar's group to her domain to escape Evanora's army of Winkies and flying baboons. She confides in Oscar that she knows he is not a wizard but still believes he can help stop Evanora. He reluctantly takes charge of an \"army\" of Quadlings, Tinkers and Munchkins. Theodora enters Glinda's domain and angrily reveals her new hideous appearance to Oscar before threatening to kill him and his allies with the Emerald City's well-prepared army. Oscar despairs at his chances of victory, but after telling China Girl about the exploits of his hero Thomas Edison he conceives a plan that relies on trickery.\n\nGlinda and her subjects mount a fake attack on the Emerald City using a pulley-rig army of scarecrow puppets hidden by thick fog. The witches are tricked into sending their flying baboons through a poppy field that puts them to sleep. However two baboons capture Glinda. Meanwhile, Oscar infiltrates the Emerald City with his allies but apparently abandons them in a hot air balloon loaded with gold, which Theodora destroys with a fireball. As the wicked sisters prepare to execute Glinda, Oscar appears, having faked his betrayal and death. Using a hidden smoke machine and image projector, he presents a giant image of his face as his \"true\" form and a fireworks display to intimidate the Wicked Witches. Evanora fearfully hides in her castle while Theodora flees on her broom, unable to hurt the \"invincible\" wizard. Oscar offers to Theodora that she would be welcome to return if she overcomes her wickedness, but Theodora refuses and flies away to the West laughing maniacally, leaving Oscar saddened. China Girl frees Glinda who engages Evanora in a magical duel. Glinda destroys Evanora's emerald necklace revealing her to be an old hag. Evanora is carried away by two flying baboons as she vows revenge.\n\nOscar, now ruler of Oz, uses his projector to sustain the belief that he is a powerful wizard. He presents gifts to his friends: Master Tinker, who helped build his machines, receives Oscar's jackknife while Knuck, the grumpy Munchkin herald, receives a mask with a smiley face; the long-suffering Finley receives Oscar's friendship along with his top hat and China Girl accepts her friends as her new family. Finally, Oscar takes Glinda behind the curtains of his projector, thanks her for making him a better person, and they kiss.\n\n\nStephen R. Hart and Bruce Campbell play Winkie guards at the Emerald City. Abigail Spencer plays May, Oscar's temporary magic assistant in Kansas and one of his several fleeting loves in the film. Tim Holmes plays the strongman who attacks Oscar for trying to court his wife (played by Toni Wynne), prompting Oscar to take the hot air balloon that sends him to the Land of Oz.\n\nRaimi, who often casts friends and actor-regulars in cameo roles, cast his brother Ted as a small-town skeptic at Oscar's magic show who yells \"I see a wire!\", two of his former teachers—Jim Moll and Jim Bird—as Emerald City townspeople and the three actresses from his 1981 directorial debut \"The Evil Dead\" —Ellen Sandweiss, Betsy Baker and Theresa Tilly— as Quadling townspeople.\n\n\"Oz the Great and Powerful\" features several artistic allusions, homages and technical parallels to Baum's novels and the 1939 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film, \"The Wizard of Oz\".\n\nThe film's opening sequence is presented in black and white. When Oscar is caught up in the tornado, the audio switches from monaural to stereo and eventually surround sound. The film shifts to full color when Oscar arrives in Oz; additionally, the aspect ratio gradually widens from 4:3 Academy ratio to 2.35:1 widescreen. As in the 1939 film, Glinda travels in giant bubbles, and the Emerald City is actually emerald; in the novel, characters wear tinted glasses to make it appear so. However, during the battle preparations sequence Oz can be seen wearing emerald goggles. The iconic green look of the Wicked Witch of the West is closer to her look in the 1939 film, as the Witch is a short, one-eyed crone in the novel. The Wicked Witches are portrayed as sisters, an idea which originated in the 1939 film. Also from the 1939 film is that several actors who play Oz characters make cameos in the Kansas segments, such as Frank, Oscar's assistant whom he refers to as his \"trained monkey\" (Frank's \"Oz\" counterpart is the winged monkey Finley) and a young girl in a wheelchair who serves as the Kansas counterpart to China Girl (in Kansas, Oscar is unable to make the wheelchair-bound young girl walk, and gets a chance to do so when he repairs China Girl's broken legs). Annie, a woman wearing a gingham dress who inspires Oscar to be a good and great person, informs him that she has been proposed to by John Gale, presumably hinting at Dorothy Gale's parental lineage (Annie's \"Oz\" counterpart, Glinda, also inspires Oscar to be a better person).\n\nOther referenced characters include the Scarecrow, who is built by the townspeople as a scare tactic, and the Tin Woodman, whose creator is the Master Tinker that can build \"anything\", and the lion that attacks Finley, a reference to the Cowardly Lion. Similarly, various other races of Oz are depicted besides the Munchkins; the Quadlings, the china doll inhabitants of Dainty China Country, and the Winkies (who went unnamed in the 1939 film). Similarly, Glinda is referred to by her title in the novel (the Good Witch of the South), unlike the 1939 film, where her character's title is \"Good Witch of the North\" (due to her character being merged with the Good Witch of the North). Glinda is also the daughter of the late King of Oz, though in the novels, Ozma is the King's daughter. Theodora's tears leave streaks of scars on her face, reflecting her weakness to water in the original novel/film. Also, Oz is presented as a real place as it is in the novel, and not as a possible dream as the 1939 film implies.\n\nAfter the success of \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" in 1937, Walt Disney planned to produce an animated film based on the first of L. Frank Baum's \"Oz\" books. However, Roy O. Disney, the chairman of Walt Disney Productions, was informed by Baum's estate that they had sold the film rights to the first book to Samuel Goldwyn, who re-sold it to Louis B. Mayer in 1938. The film was ironically approved due to the success of \"Snow White\". The project was then developed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) into the well-known musical adaptation which was released the following year.\n\nIn 1954, when the film rights to Baum's remaining thirteen \"Oz\" books were made available, Walt Disney Productions acquired them for use in Walt Disney's television series \"Disneyland\" which led to the live-action film \"Rainbow Road to Oz\", which was abandoned and never completed. Disney's history with the \"Oz\" series continued with the 1985 film \"Return to Oz\", which performed poorly, both critically and commercially, but has developed a cult following since its release by fans of the books who considered it a more faithful adaptation to the \"Oz\" books than the 1939 classic. After \"Return to Oz\", Disney lost the film rights to the \"Oz\" books and they were subsequently reverted to the public domain.\n\nScreenwriter Mitchell Kapner was intrigued by the prospect of exploring the origins of the Wizard of Oz character which he discussed in many meetings. After \"Wicked\" came out, Kapner felt he missed his window of opportunity. In 2009, Kapner met with Joe Roth, who turned down his current pitches, request any other ideas he had. The discussion turned to what Kapner was reading which he indicated he was reading the Oz series to his kids. Roth was interested as he only knew about the first book. Kapner went through the plot of the novels, when Roth stopped him on the sixth novel in the series, \"The Emerald City of Oz\", which had some of back story of the Wizard. Producer Joe Roth became involved for nearly the same reason as Kapner, stating that \"… during the years that I spent running Walt Disney Studios—I learned about how hard it was to find a fairy tale with a good strong male protagonist. You've got your Sleeping Beauties, your Cinderellas and your Alices. But a fairy tale with a male protagonist is very hard to come by. But with the origin story of the Wizard of Oz, here was a fairy tale story with a natural male protagonist. Which is why I knew that this was an idea for a movie that was genuinely worth pursuing.\" Kapner and co-writer Palak Patel presented the idea to Sony Pictures but were turned down. In 2009, the project was set up at Walt Disney Pictures when the studio's president of production, Sean Bailey commissioned \"Oz the Great and Powerful\" under the working title \"Brick\" during the tenure of then Walt Disney Studios chairman Dick Cook, who was succeeded by Rich Ross and later Alan Horn, a succession in management that a major studio release is rare to survive. David Lindsay-Abaire was later hired to do a re-write.\n\nRoth initially sought out Robert Downey Jr. for the titular role of the Wizard in April 2010. By summer of that year, Sam Raimi was hired to direct the film from a shortlist that reportedly included directors Sam Mendes and Adam Shankman. In January 2011, Raimi met with Downey, but did not secure his casting. With Downey's disinterest acknowledged, Johnny Depp was then approached due to his previous collaboration with the studio in the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" franchise and \"Alice in Wonderland\". Depp liked the role but declined involvement, citing his commitment to another Disney tentpole film, \"The Lone Ranger\". The film was without a lead until February when James Franco entered final negotiations to star in the film (including a $7 million salary), five months before filming was scheduled to begin. Coincidentally, Franco and Raimi had previously worked together on the 2002-07 \"Spider-Man\" trilogy. To prepare for the role, Franco received training with retired magician Lance Burton.\n\nScreenwriter Kapner adopted information about the Wizard from L. Frank Baum's novels to conceptualize an original story. Raimi made sure that the film would also \"nod lovingly\" to the 1939 film and inserted several references and homages to that film. Disney wanted to reduce the film's production budget to be approximately $200 million. Casting calls were put out for local actors in Michigan.\n\nIn June 2011, composer Danny Elfman was hired to score \"Oz the Great and Powerful\" despite Elfman and Raimi having had a falling-out over \"Spider-Man 2\" and Elfman declaring that they would never again work together.\n\nPrincipal photography for \"Oz the Great and Powerful\" began July 25, 2011, at Raleigh Michigan Studios in Pontiac, Michigan, employing 3D cameras. \n\nRaimi opted to use practical sets in conjunction with computer-generated imagery during filming. Physical sets were constructed so the actors could have a visual reference, as opposed to using green screen technology for every scene. Chroma key compositing was only used for background pieces. Zach Braff and Joey King were on set, recording their dialogue simultaneously with the other actors whenever their CG characters were present in a scene. Puppetry was employed for a physical version of the China Girl to serve as a visual key-point for actors to manipulate. Braff wore a blue motion capture suit to create Finley's movements and had a camera close to his face for the flying sequences to obtain facial movements.\n\nArt director Robert Stromberg, who worked on \"Avatar\" and \"Alice in Wonderland\", drew inspiration from the films of Frank Capra and James Wong Howe to achieve the Art Deco design he envisioned for the Emerald City. Stromberg contrasted the colorful tonal qualities of \"Oz\" with the restrained appearance of \"Alice\", affirming that although both films explore similar fantasy worlds, the overall atmosphere and landscape of each \"are completely different.\" In 2011, Stromberg and his team visited the Walt Disney archives during the pre-production phase to reference production art from Disney's animated films such as \"Pinocchio\", \"Bambi\", \"Fantasia\", \"Cinderella\", \"Sleeping Beauty\", \"Alice in Wonderland\" and \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", drawing from designs and textures in order to give certain settings in the film an affectionate nod to the Disney style. Costume designer Gary Jones focused on authenticity with his wardrobe designs: \"We started by doing a lot of research and having ideas of the ways (costumes) should look in order to be (historically accurate) but as we went on, we really began creating a whole new world.\"\nAlthough the film is a spiritual prequel to the 1939 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film \"The Wizard of Oz\", it was not allowed legally to be considered as such. The filmmakers had to toe a fine line between calling the film to mind but not infringing upon it. To that end, Disney had a copyright expert on set to ensure no infringement occurred. The production team worked under the constraint of abiding by the stipulations set forth by Warner Bros., the legal owner of the rights to iconic elements of the 1939 film (via its Turner Entertainment sister company which purchased the MGM film library in 1986), including the ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland. Therefore, Disney was unable to use them nor any original character likenesses from the 1939 film. This extended to the green of the Wicked Witch's skin for which Disney used what its legal department considered a sufficiently different shade dubbed \"Theostein\" (a portmanteau of \"Theodora\" and \"Frankenstein\"). Additionally, the studio could not use the signature chin mole of Margaret Hamilton's portrayal of the Wicked Witch of the West nor could they employ the yellow brick road's swirl design for Munchkinland. The expert also ensured that the Emerald City was not too close in appearance to the original Emerald City in the 1939 film.\n\nWhile Warner and Disney did not engage in copyright battle, they did file rival trademarks. In October 2012, Disney filed a trademark on \"Oz the Great and Powerful\" while one week later Warner filed its own trademarks for \"The Great and Powerful Oz.\" The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office suspended Warner's attempt at a trademark because Disney had filed basically the same one a week earlier.\n\nIn addition to the legal issues, the film was also faced with delays when several cast members went on hiatus due to unrelated commitments and circumstances. Rachel Weisz left halfway through the shoot to film her entire role in \"The Bourne Legacy\", Michelle Williams was required to promote the release of \"My Week with Marilyn\" and Franco's father died during production. Roth compared the task of managing overlapping schedules to \"being an air-traffic controller.\" Mila Kunis's makeup and prosthetics were supervised by Greg Nicotero and demanded four hours to apply and another hour to remove, with Kunis taking nearly two months to fully recover from the subsequent removal of the makeup from her skin. Raimi had to edit the frightening nature of several scenes to secure Disney's desired PG rating from the MPAA. Sony Pictures Imageworks was contracted to create the film's visual effects.\n\nComposer Danny Elfman noted that the film's score was accessibly quick to produce, with a majority of the music being written in six weeks. Regarding the tonal quality of the score, Elfman stated, \"We're going to take an approach that's old school but not self-consciously old-fashioned. Let the melodrama be melodrama, let everything be what it is. I also think there's the advantage that I'm able to write narratively, and when I'm able to write narratively I can also move quicker because that's my natural instincts, I can tell a story in the music.\"\n\nAmerican singer-songwriter Mariah Carey recorded a promotional Pop single called \"Almost Home\" written by Carey, Simone Porter, Justin Gray, Lindsey Ray, Tor Erik Hermansen, and Mikkel Eriksen (a.k.a. Stargate) for the soundtrack of the film. The single was released on February 19, 2013 by Island Records.\n\nThe original soundtrack to \"Oz the Great and Powerful\" was released digitally and physically by Walt Disney Records on March 5, 2013. The physical CD release was in association with Intrada Records.\n\nIn May 2011 before filming began, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures gave \"Oz the Great and Powerful\" a March 8, 2013 North American theatrical release date. The film had its world premiere at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood on February 14, 2013. Disney opened the film in wide release in 3,912 theaters.\n\nTo promote the film, Disney partnered with the IMAX Corporation and HSN to coordinate a hot air balloon campaign across the United States beginning in California at the Walt Disney Studios lot in Burbank, stopping at four locations; the El Capitan Theatre during the world premiere, the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, the Daytona International Speedway in Florida and Central Park in New York City. Disney also promoted the film through its theme parks; Epcot's International Flower and Garden Festival featured a multi-purpose garden and play area themed to the film and Disney California Adventure hosted sample viewings inside the Muppet*Vision 3D theatre. The estimated marketing campaign cost upwards of $100 million.\n\n\"Oz the Great and Powerful\" was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, DVD, and digital download on June 11, 2013. The film is Disney's first home media release to exclude a physical digital copy disc and instead provides only a digital code for the download. \"Oz the Great and Powerful\" debuted at number one in its first week of home media release in overall disc sales with 46% of its first week sales from Blu-ray Discs. The film has earned $52 million in sales.\n\n\"Oz the Great and Powerful\" earned $234.9 million in the United States and Canada, and $258.4 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $493.3 million. Worldwide, it was the thirteenth-highest-grossing film of 2013. Calculating in all expenses, \"Deadline Hollywood\" estimated that the film made a profit of $36.4 million. It topped the box office on its worldwide opening weekend with $149 million. Before its theatrical release, several media outlets reported that \"Oz the Great and Powerful\" was expected to duplicate the box office performance of 2010's \"Alice in Wonderland\". However, \"Oz\" accumulated less than half of \"Alice\"s worldwide gross.\n\nPreliminary reports had the film tracking for an $80–$100 million debut in North America. The movie earned $2 million from 9 p.m. showings on Thursday night. For its opening day, \"Oz the Great and Powerful\" grossed $24.1 million, the fourth-highest March opening day. During its opening weekend, the film topped the box office with $79.1 million, the third-highest March opening weekend. Despite the film's solid debut, which was larger than nearly all comparable titles, it clearly lagged behind \"Alice in Wonderland\"'s opening ($116.1 million). The film's 3-D share of the opening weekend was 53%. Females made up 52% of the audience. Surprisingly, though, families only represented 41% of attendance, while couples accounted for 43%. The film retained first place at the box office during its second weekend with $41.3 million.\n\nOutside North America, the film earned $69.9 million on its opening weekend from 46 territories. Among all markets, its highest-grossing debuts were achieved in Russia and the CIS ($14.7 million), China ($9.06 million), France and the Maghreb region ($5.77 million). The film's openings trailed \"Alice in Wonderland\" in all major markets except Russia and the CIS. It retained first place at the box office outside North America for a second weekend. In total grosses, \"Oz\"s largest countries are Russia and the CIS ($27.4 million), China ($25.9 million) and the UK, Ireland and Malta ($23.4 million).\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \"Oz the Great and Powerful\" received an approval rating of 60% based on 253 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"It suffers from some tonal inconsistency and a deflated sense of wonder, but \"Oz the Great and Powerful\" still packs enough visual dazzle and clever wit to be entertaining in its own right.\" On Metacritic the film holds a score of 44 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \"mixed to average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nKim Newman, writing for \"Empire\", gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and said, \"If there are post-Harry Potter children who don't know or care about \"The Wizard Of Oz\", they might be at sea with this story about a not-very-nice grownup in a magic land, but long-term Oz watchers will be enchanted and enthralled … Mila Kunis gets a gold star for excellence in bewitchery and Sam Raimi can settle securely behind the curtain as a mature master of illusion.\" Critic Alonso Duralde also admired the movie: \"That \"Oz the Great and Powerful\" is so thoroughly effective both on its own terms and as a prequel to one of the most beloved movies ever made indicates that this team has magic to match any witch or wizard.\" Leonard Maltin on \"IndieWire\" claimed that \"No movie ever can, or will, replace 1939's \"The Wizard Of Oz\", but taken on its own terms, this eye-filling fantasy is an entertaining riff on how the Wizard of that immortal film found his way to Oz.\" IGN rated the film 7.8 and said, \"The film is expansive and larger-than-life in scope and so are the performances, overall. Franco in particular hams it up and is often playing to the balcony … The 3D is utilized just as it should be in a children's fantasy epic such as this – overtly, but with skill. Snowflakes, music boxes and mysterious animals all leap through the screen towards the audience as the story unfolds.\"\n\nJustin Chang of \"Variety\" had a mixed reaction, writing that the film \"gets some mileage out of its game performances, luscious production design and the unfettered enthusiasm director Sam Raimi brings to a thin, simplistic origin story.\" He also compared the film's scale with the \"Star Wars\" prequel trilogy adding, \"In a real sense, \"Oz the Great and Powerful\" has a certain kinship with George Lucas's \"Star Wars\" prequels, in the way it presents a beautiful but borderline-sterile digital update of a world that was richer, purer and a lot more fun in lower-tech form. Here, too, the actors often look artificially superimposed against their CG backdrops, though the intensity of the fakery generates its own visual fascination.\" /Film rated the film 7 out of 10, saying it had \"many charms\" while considering it to be \"basically \"Army of Darkness\": (Normal guy lands in magical land, is forced to go on quest to save that land.) But just when you see Raimi's kinetic, signature style starting to unleash, the story forces the film back into its Disney shell to play to the masses. We're left with a film that's entertaining, a little scarier than you'd expect, but extremely inconsistent.\"\n\nRichard Roeper, writing for Roger Ebert, noted the film's omnipresent visual effects but was largely disappointed by the performance of some cast members; \"… to see Williams so bland and sugary as Glinda, and Kunis so flat and ineffectual as the heartsick Theodora …\" Marshall Fine of \"The Huffington Post\" was unimpressed, writing, \"Oh, it's exciting enough for a six-year-old; anyone older, however, will already have been exposed to so much on TV, at the movies and on the Internet that this will seem like so much visual cotton-candy. Even a sophisticated grade-schooler will find these doings weak and overblown.\" Similarly, Todd McCarthy criticized the characterization, writing that the film's supporting cast \"can't begin to compare with their equivalents in the original … so the burden rests entirely upon Franco and Williams, whose dialogue exchanges are repetitive and feel tentative.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" agreed, giving the film a C+ and saying that the \"miscast\" Franco \"lacks the humor, charm, and gee-whiz wonder we're meant to feel as he trades wisecracks with a flying monkey … and soars above a field of poppies in a giant soap bubble. If \"he\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s not enchanted, how are \"we\" supposed to be?\" and complaining that \"while Raimi's Oz is like retinal crack, he never seduces our hearts and minds.\" Alisha Coelho of in.com gave the movie 2.5 stars, saying \"\"Oz The Great and Powerful\" doesn't leave a lasting impression, but is an a-ok watch.\"\n\nOn March 7, 2013, \"Variety\" confirmed that Disney has already approved plans for a sequel with Mitchell Kapner and Joe Roth returning as screenwriter and producer respectively. Mila Kunis said during an interview with E! News, \"We're all signed on for sequels.\" On March 8, 2013, Sam Raimi told \"Bleeding Cool\" that he has no plans to direct the sequel, saying, \"I did leave some loose ends for another director if they want to make the picture,\" and that \"I was attracted to this story but I don't think the second one would have the thing I would need to get me interested.\" On March 11, 2013, Kapner and Roth have said to the \"Los Angeles Times\" that the sequel will \"absolutely not\" involve Dorothy Gale, with Kapner pointing out that there are twenty years between the events of the first film and Dorothy's arrival, and \"a lot can happen in that time.\"\n\n"}

The format basically was an adaption of the music hall of the United Kingdom or vaudeville in the United States, showcasing live entertainment in a restaurant and saloon setting. It was owned by local celebrity/businessman/humanitarian Frank Palumbo. Amid unsubstantiated rumors of Mafia connections, Palumbo expanded a boardinghouse started by his grandfather, Antonio Palumbo into the entertainment complex. Palumbo’s was destroyed by fire in 1994 and was determined to be arson. The site, marked by an unofficial historical plaque, is now occupied by a chain drug store.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, Philadelphia was an important pop music center, with many bands and singers being made or broken in the city. The 20th Century Club, Ciro's and the opulent, art deco Click Club on Market St. which Frank also owned were significant elements in the music scene. Benny Goodman And His Orchestra with Patti Page and pianist Teddy Wilson performed a Live 1946 radio broadcast for the 'One Night Stand' show at Frank Palumbo's Click Club in Philadelphia. Frequent performers at Palumbo's included Frank Sinatra, Sergio Franchi, Louis Prima, Louis Armstrong, the Clooney Sisters, Jimmy Durante and \"The Godfathers\" [Al Martino], comedians and numerous entertainers. A nightly radio series broadcast concerts from the club, many of which were later released as albums.\n\nWell beyond the club’s heyday, the restaurant remained popular. Sinatra visited the “black tie saloon” frequently and Mayor Frank Rizzo spent most evenings there during his rise to power, years in office and beyond.\nThe banquet hall became a popular cultural tradition for many social groups, business organizations, family celebrations, and special events that were mostly attracted by the reasonable prices, menu items and entertainment. \n\n"}

It originally aired in the United States on Cartoon Network's late-night programming block Adult Swim on January 15, 2006. The episode's name was taken from \"The Lord of the Rings\" volume \"The Return of the King\". It won a Peabody Award in 2006.\n\nThe episode begins with two quotes, the first being:\n\nAnd the second:\n\nHuey Freeman tells an alternate version of history regarding the \"attempted\" assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. On April 4, 1968 King is shot and critically wounded. Instead of dying, he falls into a coma in which he remains for 32 years, waking up significantly aged in a hospital bed on October 27, 2000. He shows up to vote for the 2000 U.S. presidential election, but is \"turned away due to voting irregularity\". While walking along a city street which happened to bear his name, gunshots go off, causing the gathered crowd to flee. He thus learns that \"streets named after him weren't the very safest.\"\n\nKing experiences a resurgence of popularity, obtaining a book deal and agreeing to a biopic of his life (starring Cuba Gooding, Jr. as King). The movie is directed by Oliver Stone, \"pissing off\" Spike Lee (a reference to Lee's anger that Norman Jewison was initially supposed to direct \"Malcolm X\"). Unfortunately, the movie is released the week after the September 11 attacks, making it a flop. Soon after, King appears on \"Politically Incorrect\", stating that his Christian faith teaches him to \"turn the other cheek\", even with respect to enemies such as Al-Qaeda. His commentary receives severe scorn from the White House Press Secretary, CNN and \"Time\" magazine, and causes his popularity to plummet.\n\nAt his vacant book signing, King meets Huey and Robert Freeman, the latter of whom he became acquainted with during the Civil Rights Movement (it is later revealed in the episode that Robert Freeman participated in the Montgomery bus boycott with Rosa Parks, but was completely ignored). Robert prank calls Rosa Parks out of retaliation. Learning that he is staying in a Holiday Inn Express, the Freemans invite Dr. King to dinner and to sleep at their house. Riley rudely disrespects Dr. King during dinner (not knowing who he is and mistaking him for Morgan Freeman) and thus earns a spanking from Robert. Riley hates Dr. King even more while being spanked. Later that night, Huey and King, while watching television, express their disgust and disappointment with the state of black popular culture. When King asks Huey what happened to African American society, Huey responds by saying that everyone was waiting for King to return, as without strong leaders like him, the entire culture plummeted.\n\nThe next day, Huey persuades King to try to reach out to the public again. While eating at a McWuncler's, a parody of McDonald's (where King guiltily admits to having an affinity for the McRib), Huey convinces him that the two of them should start a political party, although King is insistent that Huey should get Oprah Winfrey to do so instead. King appears on a television show to explain the philosophy of his new party, but finds himself unable to expound due to frequent interruptions from the fast-talking, curt, bowtie-wearing right-wing host (voiced by Jim Meskimen). Right before a commercial break, Huey rushes the stage after throwing a chair at the host, beating him on camera. Afterwards, King and Huey settle on spreading their message the old-fashioned way: through flyers and door-to-door solicitation.\n\nThe goal of their party is further disrupted when King hires an \"urban promotions firm\" to advertise the party's planning meeting, which advertises it on an FM radio pop music station as a \"party.\" As a result, dozens of young black people arrive at the church and begin behaving as though it were a club. A bouncer (voiced by DJ Pooh) prevents Huey and King's entrance, insisting that they must bribe him, which they do. Upon entering, they are stunned by the unrestrained behavior of the reveling crowd and are shocked to find that the podium has been taken over by a series of rappers, televangelists, and other superficial black pop culture icons. King, managing to get to the podium, tries to quiet the crowd by appealing to the audience's sense of brotherhood. He fails. Suddenly becoming fiercely impassioned, he proclaims, \"Will you ignorant niggas please shut the hell up?!\" The crowd is shocked.\n\nKing then goes on to ask: \"Is this it? \"This\" is what I got all those ass-whoopings for?\" He continues to refer to the audience repeatedly as \"niggas\" out of apparent frustration that the current generation of black people have willfully assumed the negative racial stereotypes associated with them. He goes on a tirade, attacking specific elements of black popular culture such as Black Entertainment Television, Usher, and \"Soul Plane\". King concludes his speech by saying, \"I've seen what's around the corner, I've seen what's over the horizon, and I promise you, you niggas have nothing to celebrate! And no, I won't get there with you. I'm going to Canada.\"\n\nKing thanks Huey, advising him to \"do what he can\" and leaves. This was the last time Huey ever saw King. Media exposure of his speech causes black citizens to become angry with their situation, creating an uprising similar to those of the 1960s. The episode concludes with several news reports that all black members of the NBA are sitting the season out until \"troops are withdrawn\", that drop-out rates among African-American youths have suddenly plummeted, and that Robert L. Johnson issued a public apology for founding BET. The next scene shows young black men and women screaming at the gates of the White House, cursing an unnamed presidential administration. Finally, the front page of a newspaper from 2020 is shown, revealing that King has died in Vancouver, British Columbia at the age of 91 and, furthermore, that Oprah Winfrey has been elected President of the United States.\n\nHuey concludes the episode with these words: \"It's fun to dream\", stating that this whole episode was Huey's interpretation as to what would happen if MLK Jr. have lived instead of being assassinated in '68.\n\n\"Return of the King\" was the most controversial episode of \"The Boondocks\"'s first season. The episode received criticism from Al Sharpton for depicting Martin Luther King Jr. using the term \"nigga.\" He demanded an apology from Aaron McGruder and Cartoon Network, stating \"Cartoon Network must apologize and also commit to pulling episodes that desecrate black historic figures. We are totally offended by the continuous use of the n-word in McGruder's show.\"\n\nCartoon Network replied by releasing a statement saying, \"We think Aaron McGruder came up with a thought-provoking way of not only showing Dr. King's bravery but also of reminding us of what he stood and fought for, and why even today, it is important for all of us to remember that and to continue to take action.\" McGruder himself responded to Sharpton's criticism in \"The Boondocks\" comic strip, by having the characters ridicule the activist's choice to attack a cartoon over other, more relevant issues. The characters in the strip never specify the cartoon to which they're alluding.\nThe incident was also referenced on the show, in the episode \"The Block is Hot.\" While Huey listens to an internet radio station, the broadcaster mentions that Al Sharpton: \"Folks, this heat will not let up, it is hot! Speaking about hot, Al Sharpton is hot right now. Havin' a big ole protest. Seems his anger again has something to do with... I think it's a cartoon this time...\"\n"}
{"id": "4800533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4800533", "title": "Said the actress to the bishop", "text": "Said the actress to the bishop\n\nThe phrase \"Said the actress to the bishop\" is a colloquial and vulgar British exclamation, offering humour by serving as a punch line that exposes an unintended double entendre. An equivalent phrase in North America is \"that's what \"she\" said\". Each phrase is an example of a Wellerism, exposing a second meaning of what precedes it. The versatility of such phrases, and their popularity, lead some to consider them clichéd.\n\nThe term, or its variant \"as the actress said to the bishop\", is British in origin. It was in popular usage in the Royal Air Force c.1944-47, but may originate from the Edwardian era.\n\nThe phrase is frequently used by the fictional character Simon Templar (alias \"The Saint\") in a long-running series of mystery books by Leslie Charteris. The phrase first appears in the inaugural Saint novel \"Meet the Tiger\", published in 1928.\n\nThe version \"as the girl said to the soldier\" appears in a recorded sound test for Alfred Hitchcock's 1929 film \"Blackmail\".\n\nKingsley Amis uses the line in his 1954 novel \"Lucky Jim\", where a woman offering relationship advice to Jim Dixon says \"I can't show you, as the actress said to the bishop.\"\n\nThe title character on the US TV show \"Archer\", after several seasons of using \"phrasing!\" to draw attention to double entendres, briefly toyed with \"...said Ripley to the android Bishop\", a reference to both this phrase and the 1986 film \"Aliens.\"\n\nBy 1973, \"that's what \"she\" said\" had already been characterized as an \"ancient one-liner\". In the early 1990s, it was a recurring joke in the \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch \"Wayne's World\". In the movie of the same name, the character, Wayne Campbell, uses the phrase after his partner Garth says, \"Hey, are you through yet? 'Cause I'm getting tired of holding this\", in regard to a picture he is holding. An 1896 recording by Len Spencer of the song \"All Coons Look Alike to Me\" includes the suggestive line \"That's what she said, yeah.\"\n\nIn the original BBC version of \"The Office\", Ricky Gervais's character David Brent frequently used the phrase \"as the actress said to the bishop\" as an inappropriate joke. When the show was adapted for American audiences, also under the title \"The Office\", the phrase was translated to \"that's what she said\" for Steve Carell's character Michael Scott. \"That's what she said\" (with an emphasis on the word \"she\") became a catchphrase of \"The Office\" and was used for the show's \"That's What She Said\" Sweepstakes.\n\nMatthew R. Meier of West Chester University of Pennsylvania and Christopher A. Medjesky of the University of Findlay have argued that \"such off-hand, common remarks such as “that’s what she said” jokes are deeply entrenched in modern society, and contribute to humorizing and legitimizing sexual misconduct.\"\n\nIn 2017, the terminology was used again in \"Saturday Night Live\" by Alec Baldwin who portrayed Donald Trump in \"Paul Manafort's House Cold Open\": \"'I would never do that to you.' 'That's what she said.'\"\n\n"}
{"id": "27640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27640", "title": "Samuel Beckett", "text": "Samuel Beckett\n\nSamuel Barclay Beckett (; 13 April 1906 – 22 December 1989) was an Irish avant-garde novelist, playwright, theatre director, poet, and literary translator who lived in Paris for most of his adult life. He wrote in both English and French.\n\nBeckett's work offers a bleak, tragicomic outlook on human existence, often coupled with black comedy and gallows humor, and became increasingly minimalist in his later career. He is considered one of the last modernist writers, and one of the key figures in what Martin Esslin called the \"Theatre of the Absurd\".\n\nBeckett was awarded the 1969 Nobel Prize in Literature \"for his writing, which—in new forms for the novel and drama—in the destitution of modern man acquires its elevation\". He was elected Saoi of Aosdána in 1984.\n\nSamuel Beckett was born in Dublin on Good Friday, 13 April 1906, to William Frank Beckett, a quantity surveyor and descendant of the Huguenots, and Maria Jones Roe, a nurse, when both were 35. They had married in 1901. Beckett had one older brother, Frank Edward Beckett (1902–1954). At the age of five, Beckett attended a local playschool in Dublin, where he started to learn music, and then moved to Earlsfort House School in Dublin city centre near Harcourt Street. The Becketts were members of the Anglican Church of Ireland. The family home, Cooldrinagh in the Dublin suburb of Foxrock, was a large house and garden complete with tennis court built in 1903 by Samuel's father, William. The house and garden, together with the surrounding countryside where he often went walking with his father, the nearby Leopardstown Racecourse, the Foxrock railway station and Harcourt Street station at the city terminus of the line, all feature in his prose and plays.\n\nIn 1919/1920, Beckett went to Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh (which Oscar Wilde had also attended). He left 3 years later, in 1923. A natural athlete, Beckett excelled at cricket as a left-handed batsman and a left-arm medium-pace bowler. Later, he was to play for Dublin University and played two first-class games against Northamptonshire. As a result, he became the only Nobel literature laureate to have played first-class cricket.\n\nBeckett studied French, Italian, and English at Trinity College, Dublin from 1923 to 1927 (one of his tutors was the eminent Berkeley scholar A. A. Luce, who introduced him to the work of Henri Bergson). He was elected a Scholar in Modern Languages in 1926. Beckett graduated with a BA and, after teaching briefly at Campbell College in Belfast, took up the post of \"lecteur d'anglais\" at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris from November 1928 to 1930. While there, he was introduced to renowned Irish author James Joyce by Thomas MacGreevy, a poet and close confidant of Beckett who also worked there. This meeting had a profound effect on the young man. Beckett assisted Joyce in various ways, one of which was research towards the book that became \"Finnegans Wake\".\n\nIn 1929, Beckett published his first work, a critical essay entitled \"Dante... Bruno. Vico.. Joyce\". The essay defends Joyce's work and method, chiefly from allegations of wanton obscurity and dimness, and was Beckett's contribution to \"Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress\" (a book of essays on Joyce which also included contributions by Eugene Jolas, Robert McAlmon, and William Carlos Williams). Beckett's close relationship with Joyce and his family cooled, however, when he rejected the advances of Joyce's daughter Lucia owing to her progressing schizophrenia. Beckett's first short story, \"Assumption\", was published in Jolas's periodical \"transition\". The next year he won a small literary prize for his hastily composed poem \"Whoroscope\", which draws on a biography of René Descartes that Beckett happened to be reading when he was encouraged to submit.\n\nIn 1930, Beckett returned to Trinity College as a lecturer. In November 1930, he presented a paper in French to the Modern Languages Society of Trinity on the Toulouse poet Jean du Chas, founder of a movement called \"le Concentrisme\". It was a literary parody, for Beckett had in fact invented the poet and his movement that claimed to be \"at odds with all that is clear and distinct in Descartes\". Beckett later insisted that he had not intended to fool his audience. When Beckett resigned from Trinity at the end of 1931, his brief academic career was at an end. He commemorated it with the poem \"Gnome\", which was inspired by his reading of Johann Wolfgang Goethe's \"Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship\" and eventually published in \"The Dublin Magazine\" in 1934:\n\nBeckett travelled in Europe. He spent some time in London, where in 1931 he published \"Proust\", his critical study of French author Marcel Proust. Two years later, following his father's death, he began two years' treatment with Tavistock Clinic psychoanalyst Dr. Wilfred Bion. Aspects of it became evident in Beckett's later works, such as \"Watt\" and \"Waiting for Godot\". In 1932, he wrote his first novel, \"Dream of Fair to Middling Women\", but after many rejections from publishers decided to abandon it (it was eventually published in 1992). Despite his inability to get it published, however, the novel served as a source for many of Beckett's early poems, as well as for his first full-length book, the 1933 short-story collection \"More Pricks Than Kicks\".\n\nBeckett published essays and reviews, including \"Recent Irish Poetry\" (in \"The Bookman\", August 1934) and \"Humanistic Quietism\", a review of his friend Thomas MacGreevy's \"Poems\" (in \"The Dublin Magazine\", July–September 1934). They focused on the work of MacGreevy, Brian Coffey, Denis Devlin and Blanaid Salkeld, despite their slender achievements at the time, comparing them favourably with their Celtic Revival contemporaries and invoking Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, and the French symbolists as their precursors. In describing these poets as forming \"the nucleus of a living poetic in Ireland\", Beckett was tracing the outlines of an Irish poetic modernist canon.\n\nIn 1935—the year that Beckett successfully published a book of his poetry, \"Echo's Bones and Other Precipitates\"—Beckett worked on his novel \"Murphy\". In May, he wrote to MacGreevy that he had been reading about film and wished to go to Moscow to study with Sergei Eisenstein at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography in Moscow. In mid-1936 he wrote to Eisenstein and Vsevolod Pudovkin to offer himself as their apprentice. Nothing came of this, however, as Beckett's letter was lost owing to Eisenstein's quarantine during the smallpox outbreak, as well as his focus on a script re-write of his postponed film production. In 1936, a friend had suggested him to look up the works of Arnold Geulincx, which Beckett did and he took many notes. The philosopher's name is mentioned in \"Murphy\" and the reading apparently left a strong impression. \"Murphy\" was finished in 1936 and Beckett departed for extensive travel around Germany, during which time he filled several notebooks with lists of noteworthy artwork that he had seen and noted his distaste for the Nazi savagery that was overtaking the country. Returning to Ireland briefly in 1937, he oversaw the publication of \"Murphy\" (1938), which he translated into French the following year. He fell out with his mother, which contributed to his decision to settle permanently in Paris. Beckett remained in Paris following the outbreak of World War II in 1939, preferring, in his own words, \"France at war to Ireland at peace\". His was soon a known face in and around Left Bank cafés, where he strengthened his allegiance with Joyce and forged new ones with artists Alberto Giacometti and Marcel Duchamp, with whom he regularly played chess. Sometime around December 1937, Beckett had a brief affair with Peggy Guggenheim, who nicknamed him \"Oblomov\" (after the character in Ivan Goncharov's novel).\n\nIn January 1938 in Paris, Beckett was stabbed in the chest and nearly killed when he refused the solicitations of a notorious pimp (who went by the name of Prudent). Joyce arranged a private room for Beckett at the hospital. The publicity surrounding the stabbing attracted the attention of Suzanne Dechevaux-Dumesnil, who previously knew Beckett slightly from his first stay in Paris. This time, however, the two would begin a lifelong companionship. At a preliminary hearing, Beckett asked his attacker for the motive behind the stabbing. Prudent replied: \"Je ne sais pas, Monsieur. Je m'excuse\" [\"I do not know, sir. I'm sorry\"]. Beckett eventually dropped the charges against his attacker—partially to avoid further formalities, partly because he found Prudent likeable and well-mannered.\n\nAfter the Nazi German occupation of France in 1940, Beckett joined the French Resistance, in which he worked as a courier. On several occasions over the next two years he was nearly caught by the Gestapo. In August 1942, his unit was betrayed and he and Suzanne fled south on foot to the safety of the small village of Roussillon, in the Vaucluse \"département\" in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur. There he continued to assist the Resistance by storing armaments in the back yard of his home. During the two years that Beckett stayed in Roussillon he indirectly helped the Maquis sabotage the German army in the Vaucluse mountains, though he rarely spoke about his wartime work in later life.\n\nBeckett was awarded the Croix de guerre and the Médaille de la Résistance by the French government for his efforts in fighting the German occupation; to the end of his life, however, Beckett would refer to his work with the French Resistance as \"boy scout stuff\". While in hiding in Roussillon, he continued work on the novel \"Watt\" (begun in 1941 and completed in 1945, but not published until 1953, though an extract had appeared in the Dublin literary periodical \"Envoy\").\n\nIn 1945, Beckett returned to Dublin for a brief visit. During his stay, he had a revelation in his mother’s room: His entire future direction in literature appeared to him. Beckett had felt that he would remain forever in the shadow of Joyce, certain to never best him at his own game. His revelation prompted him to change direction and to acknowledge both his own stupidity and his interest in ignorance and impotence:\n\"I realized that Joyce had gone as far as one could in the direction of knowing more, [being] in control of one’s material. He was always adding to it; you only have to look at his proofs to see that. I realized that my own way was in impoverishment, in lack of knowledge and in taking away, in subtracting rather than in adding.\"\n\nKnowlson argues that \"Beckett was rejecting the Joycean principle that knowing more was a way of creatively understanding the world and controlling it ... In future, his work would focus on poverty, failure, exile and loss – as he put it, on man as a 'non-knower' and as a 'non-can-er.'\" The revelation \"has rightly been regarded as a pivotal moment in his entire career\". Beckett fictionalised the experience in his play \"Krapp's Last Tape\" (1958). While listening to a tape he made earlier in his life, Krapp hears his younger self say \"clear to me at last that the dark I have always struggled to keep under is in reality my most...\", at which point Krapp fast-forwards the tape (before the audience can hear the complete revelation). Beckett later explained to Knowlson that the missing words on the tape are \"precious ally\".\n\nIn 1946, Jean-Paul Sartre’s magazine \"Les Temps modernes\" published the first part of Beckett’s short story \"\"Suite\" (later to be called \"La Fin\"\", or \"The End\"), not realizing that Beckett had only submitted the first half of the story; Simone de Beauvoir refused to publish the second part. Beckett also began to write his fourth novel, \"Mercier et Camier\", which was not published until 1970. The novel presaged his most famous work, the play \"Waiting for Godot\", which was written not long afterwards. More importantly, the novel was Beckett’s first long work that he wrote in French, the language of most of his subsequent works which were strongly supported by Jérôme Lindon director of his parisian publishing house Les Éditions de Minuit, including the poioumenon \"trilogy\" of novels: \"Molloy\" (1951); \"Malone meurt\" (1951), \"Malone Dies\" (1958); \"L'innommable\" (1953), \"The Unnamable\" (1960). Despite being a native English speaker, Beckett wrote in French because—as he himself claimed—it was easier for him thus to write \"without style\".\nBeckett is most famous for his play \"En attendant Godot\" (1953) (\"Waiting for Godot\"). In a much-quoted article, the critic Vivian Mercier wrote that Beckett \"has achieved a theoretical impossibility—a play in which nothing happens, that yet keeps audiences glued to their seats. What's more, since the second act is a subtly different reprise of the first, he has written a play in which nothing happens, twice.\" Like most of his works after 1947, the play was first written in French with the title \"En attendant Godot\". Beckett worked on the play between October 1948 and January 1949. He published it in 1952 and it premièred in 1953; an English translation appeared two years later. Directed by Roger Blin, the play was a critical, popular, and controversial success in Paris. It opened in London in 1955 to mainly negative reviews, but the tide turned with positive reactions from Harold Hobson in \"The Sunday Times\" and, later, Kenneth Tynan. In the United States, it flopped in Miami and had a qualified success in New York City. After this, the play became extremely popular, with highly successful performances in the US and Germany. It is frequently performed today.\n\nBeckett translated all of his works into English himself, with the exception of \"Molloy\", for which he collaborated with Patrick Bowles. The success of \"Waiting for Godot\" opened up a career in theatre for its author. Beckett went on to write successful full-length plays, including \"Fin de partie\" (\"Endgame\") (1957), \"Krapp's Last Tape\" (1958, written in English), \"Happy Days\" (1961, also written in English), and \"Play\" (1963). In 1961, Beckett received the International Publishers' Formentor Prize in recognition of his work, which he shared that year with Jorge Luis Borges.\n\nThe 1960s were a time of change for Beckett, both on a personal level and as a writer. In 1961, he married Suzanne in a secret civil ceremony in England (its secrecy due to reasons relating to French inheritance law). The success of his plays led to invitations to attend rehearsals and productions around the world, leading eventually to a new career as a theatre director. In 1957, he had his first commission from the BBC Third Programme for a radio play, \"All That Fall.\" He continued writing sporadically for radio and extended his scope to include cinema and television. He began to write in English again, although he also wrote in French until the end of his life.\n\nBeckett bought some land in 1953 near a hamlet around northeast of Paris and built a cottage for himself with the help of some locals.\n\nFrom the late 1950s until his death, Beckett had a relationship with Barbara Bray, a widow who worked as a script editor for the BBC. Knowlson wrote of them: \"She was small and attractive, but, above all, keenly intelligent and well-read. Beckett seems to have been immediately attracted by her and she to him. Their encounter was highly significant for them both, for it represented the beginning of a relationship that was to last, in parallel with that with Suzanne, for the rest of his life.\" Barbara Bray died in Edinburgh on 25 February 2010.\n\nIn October 1969 while on holiday in Tunis with Suzanne, Beckett heard that he had won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Anticipating that her intensely private husband would be saddled with fame from that moment on, Suzanne called the award a \"catastrophe\". In true ascetic fashion, he gave away all of the prize money. While Beckett did not devote much time to interviews, he sometimes met the artists, scholars, and admirers who sought him out in the anonymous lobby of the Hotel PLM St. Jacques in Paris near his Montparnasse home. Although Beckett was an intensely private man, a review of the second volume of his letters by Roy Foster in the 15 December 2011 issue of \"The New Republic\" reveals Beckett to be not only unexpectedly amiable but frequently prepared to talk about his work and the process behind it.\n\nSuzanne died on 17 July 1989. Confined to a nursing home and suffering from emphysema and possibly Parkinson's disease, Beckett died on 22 December. The two were interred together in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris and share a simple granite gravestone that follows Beckett's directive that it should be \"any colour, so long as it's grey\".\n\nBeckett's career as a writer can be roughly divided into three periods: his early works, up until the end of World War II in 1945; his middle period, stretching from 1945 until the early 1960s, during which he wrote what are probably his best-known works; and his late period, from the early 1960s until Beckett's death in 1989, during which his works tended to become shorter and his style more minimalist.\n\nBeckett's earliest works are generally considered to have been strongly influenced by the work of his friend James Joyce. They are erudite and seem to display the author's learning merely for its own sake, resulting in several obscure passages. The opening phrases of the short-story collection \"More Pricks than Kicks\" (1934) affords a representative sample of this style:\n\nIt was morning and Belacqua was stuck in the first of the canti in the moon. He was so bogged that he could move neither backward nor forward. Blissful Beatrice was there, Dante also, and she explained the spots on the moon to him. She shewed him in the first place where he was at fault, then she put up her own explanation. She had it from God, therefore he could rely on its being accurate in every particular.\n\nThe passage makes reference to Dante's \"Commedia\", which can serve to confuse readers not familiar with that work. It also anticipates aspects of Beckett's later work: the physical inactivity of the character Belacqua; the character's immersion in his own head and thoughts; the somewhat irreverent comedy of the final sentence.\n\nSimilar elements are present in Beckett's first published novel, \"Murphy\" (1938), which also explores the themes of insanity and chess (both of which would be recurrent elements in Beckett's later works). The novel's opening sentence hints at the somewhat pessimistic undertones and black humour that animate many of Beckett's works: \"The sun shone, having no alternative, on the nothing new\". \"Watt\", written while Beckett was in hiding in Roussillon during World War II, is similar in terms of themes but less exuberant in its style. It explores human movement as if it were a mathematical permutation, presaging Beckett's later preoccupation—in both his novels and dramatic works—with precise movement.\n\nBeckett's 1930 essay \"Proust\" was strongly influenced by Schopenhauer's pessimism and laudatory descriptions of saintly asceticism. At this time Beckett began to write creatively in the French language. In the late 1930s, he wrote a number of short poems in that language and their sparseness—in contrast to the density of his English poems of roughly the same period, collected in \"Echo's Bones and Other Precipitates\" (1935)—seems to show that Beckett, albeit through the medium of another language, was in process of simplifying his style, a change also evidenced in \"Watt\".\n\nAfter World War II, Beckett turned definitively to the French language as a vehicle. It was this, together with the \"revelation\" experienced in his mother's room in Dublin—in which he realized that his art must be subjective and drawn wholly from his own inner world—that would result in the works for which Beckett is best remembered today.\n\nDuring the 15 years following the war, Beckett produced four major full-length stage plays: \"En attendant Godot\" (written 1948–1949; \"Waiting for Godot\"), \"Fin de partie\" (1955–1957; \"Endgame\"), \"Krapp's Last Tape\" (1958), and \"Happy Days\" (1961). These plays—which are often considered, rightly or wrongly, to have been instrumental in the so-called \"Theatre of the Absurd\"—deal in a darkly humorous way with themes similar to those of the roughly contemporary existentialist thinkers. The term \"Theatre of the Absurd\" was coined by Martin Esslin in a book of the same name; Beckett and \"Godot\" were centerpieces of the book. Esslin argued these plays were the fulfilment of Albert Camus's concept of \"the absurd\"; this is one reason Beckett is often falsely labeled as an existentialist (this is based on the assumption that Camus was an existentialist, though he in fact broke off from the existentialist movement and founded his own philosophy). Though many of the themes are similar, Beckett had little affinity for existentialism as a whole.\n\nBroadly speaking, the plays deal with the subject of despair and the will to survive in spite of that despair, in the face of an uncomprehending and incomprehensible world. The words of Nell—one of the two characters in \"Endgame\" who are trapped in ashbins, from which they occasionally peek their heads to speak—can best summarize the themes of the plays of Beckett's middle period: \"Nothing is funnier than unhappiness, I grant you that. ... Yes, yes, it's the most comical thing in the world. And we laugh, we laugh, with a will, in the beginning. But it's always the same thing. Yes, it's like the funny story we have heard too often, we still find it funny, but we don't laugh any more.\"\n\nBeckett's outstanding achievements in prose during the period were the three novels \"Molloy\" (1951), \"Malone meurt\" (1951; \"Malone Dies\") and \"L'innommable\" (1953: \"The Unnamable\"). In these novels—sometimes referred to as a \"trilogy\", though this is against the author's own explicit wishes—the prose becomes increasingly bare and stripped down. \"Molloy\", for instance, still retains many of the characteristics of a conventional novel (time, place, movement, and plot) and it makes use of the structure of a detective novel. In \"Malone Dies\", movement and plot are largely dispensed with, though there is still some indication of place and the passage of time; the \"action\" of the book takes the form of an interior monologue. Finally, in \"The Unnamable\", almost all sense of place and time are abolished, and the essential theme seems to be the conflict between the voice's drive to continue speaking so as to continue existing, and its almost equally strong urge towards silence and oblivion. Despite the widely held view that Beckett's work, as exemplified by the novels of this period, is essentially pessimistic, the will to live seems to win out in the end; witness, for instance, the famous final phrase of \"The Unnamable\": 'I can't go on, I'll go on'.\n\nAfter these three novels, Beckett struggled for many years to produce a sustained work of prose, a struggle evidenced by the brief \"stories\" later collected as \"Texts for Nothing\". In the late 1950s, however, he created one of his most radical prose works, \"Comment c'est\" (1961; \"How It Is\". An early variant version of \"Comment c'est\", \"L'Image\", was published in the British arts review, \"X: A Quarterly Review\" (1959), and is the first appearance of the novel in any form.). This work relates the adventures of an unnamed narrator crawling through the mud while dragging a sack of canned food. It was written as a sequence of unpunctuated paragraphs in a style approaching telegraphese: \"You are there somewhere alive somewhere vast stretch of time then it's over you are there no more alive no more than again you are there again alive again it wasn't over an error you begin again all over more or less in the same place or in another as when another image above in the light you come to in hospital in the dark\" Following this work, it was almost another decade before Beckett produced a work of non-dramatic prose. \"How It Is\" is generally considered to mark the end of his middle period as a writer.\n\nThroughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, Beckett's works exhibited an increasing tendency—already evident in much of his work of the 1950s—towards compactness. This has led to his work sometimes being described as minimalist. The extreme example of this, among his dramatic works, is the 1969 piece \"Breath\", which lasts for only 35 seconds and has no characters (though it was likely intended to offer ironic comment on \"Oh! Calcutta!\", the theatrical revue for which it served as an introductory piece).\nIn his theatre of the late period, Beckett's characters—already few in number in the earlier plays—are whittled down to essential elements. The ironically titled \"Play\" (1962), for instance, consists of three characters immersed up to their necks in large funeral urns. The television drama \"Eh Joe\" (1963), which was written for the actor Jack MacGowran, is animated by a camera that steadily closes in to a tight focus upon the face of the title character. The play \"Not I\" (1972) consists almost solely of, in Beckett's words, \"a moving mouth with the rest of the stage in darkness\". Following from \"Krapp's Last Tape\", many of these later plays explore memory, often in the form of a forced recollection of haunting past events in a moment of stillness in the present. They also deal with the theme of the self confined and observed, with a voice that either comes from outside into the protagonist's head (as in \"Eh Joe\") or else another character comments on the protagonist silently, by means of gesture (as in \"Not I\"). Beckett's most politically charged play, \"Catastrophe\" (1982), which was dedicated to Václav Havel, deals relatively explicitly with the idea of dictatorship. After a long period of inactivity, Beckett's poetry experienced a revival during this period in the ultra-terse French poems of \"mirlitonnades\", with some as short as six words long. These defied Beckett's usual scrupulous concern to translate his work from its original into the other of his two languages; several writers, including Derek Mahon, have attempted translations, but no complete version of the sequence has been published in English.\n\nBeckett's prose pieces during the late period were not so prolific as his theatre, as suggested by the title of the 1976 collection of short prose texts \"Fizzles\" (which the American artist Jasper Johns illustrated). Beckett experienced something of a renaissance with the novella \"Company\" (1980), which continued with \"Ill Seen Ill Said\" (1982) and \"Worstward Ho\" (1984), later collected in \"Nohow On\". In these three \"'closed space' stories,\" Beckett continued his preoccupation with memory and its effect on the confined and observed self, as well as with the positioning of bodies in space, as the opening phrases of \"Company\" make clear: \"A voice comes to one in the dark. Imagine.\" \"To one on his back in the dark. This he can tell by the pressure on his hind parts and by how the dark changes when he shuts his eyes and again when he opens them again. Only a small part of what is said can be verified. As for example when he hears, You are on your back in the dark. Then he must acknowledge the truth of what is said.\" Themes of aloneness and the doomed desire to successfully connect with other human beings are expressed in several late pieces, including \"Company\" and \"Rockaby\".\n\nIn the hospital and nursing home where he spent his final days, Beckett wrote his last work, the 1988 poem \"What is the Word\" (\"Comment dire\"). The poem grapples with an inability to find words to express oneself, a theme echoing Beckett's earlier work, though possibly amplified by the sickness he experienced late in life.\n\nJack MacGowran was the first actor to do a one-man show based on the works of Beckett. He debuted \"End of Day\" in Dublin in 1962, revising it as \"Beginning To End\" (1965). The show went through further revisions before Beckett directed it in Paris in 1970; MacGowran won the 1970–1971 Obie for Best Performance By an Actor when he performed the show off-Broadway as \"Jack MacGowran in the Works of Samuel Beckett.\" Beckett wrote the radio play \"Embers\" and the teleplay \"Eh Joe\" specifically for MacGowran. The actor also appeared in various productions of \"Waiting for Godot\" and \"Endgame,\" and did several readings of Beckett's plays and poems on BBC Radio; he also recorded the LP, \"MacGowran Speaking Beckett\" for Claddagh Records in 1966.\n\nBillie Whitelaw worked with Beckett for 25 years on such plays as \"Not I\", \"Eh Joe\", \"Krapp's Last Tape\", and \"Footfalls\" and \"Rockaby.\" She first met Beckett in 1963. In her autobiography \"Billie Whitelaw...: Who He?,\" she describes their first meeting in 1963 was \"trust at first sight\". Beckett went on to write many of his experimental theatre works for her. She came to be regarded as his muse, the \"supreme interpreter of his work\", perhaps most famous for her role as the mouth in \"Not I\". She said of the play \"Rockaby\": \"I put the tape in my head. And I sort of look in a particular way, but not at the audience. Sometimes as a director Beckett comes out with absolute gems and I use them a lot in other areas. We were doing \"Happy Days\" and I just did not know where in the theatre to look during this particular section. And I asked, and he thought for a bit and then said, 'Inward' \". She said of her role in \"Footfalls\": \"I felt like a moving, musical Edvard Munch painting and, in fact, when Beckett was directing \"Footfalls\" he was not only using me to play the notes but I almost felt that he did have the paintbrush out and was painting.\" \"Sam knew that I would turn myself inside out to give him what he wanted\", she explained. \"With all of Sam's work, the scream was there, my task was to try to get it out.\" She stopped performing his plays in 1989 when he died.\n\nThe English stage designer Jocelyn Herbert was a close friend and influence on Beckett until his death. She worked with him on such plays as \"Happy Days\" (their third project) and \"Krapp's Last Tape\" at the Royal Court Theatre. Beckett said that Herbert became his closest friend in England: \"She has a great feeling for the work and is very sensitive and doesn't want to bang the nail on the head. Generally speaking, there is a tendency on the part of designers to overstate, and this has never been the case with Jocelyn.\"\n\nThe distinguished German director Walter D. Asmus began his working relationship with Beckett in the Schiller Theatre in Berlin in 1974 and continued until 1989, the year of the playwright's death. Asmus has directed all of Beckett's plays internationally.\n\nOf all the English-language modernists, Beckett's work represents the most sustained attack on the realist tradition. He opened up the possibility of theatre and fiction that dispense with conventional plot and the unities of time and place in order to focus on essential components of the human condition. Václav Havel, John Banville, Aidan Higgins, Tom Stoppard, Harold Pinter and Jon Fosse have publicly stated their indebtedness to Beckett's example. He has had a wider influence on experimental writing since the 1950s, from the Beat generation to the happenings of the 1960s and after. In an Irish context, he has exerted great influence on poets such as Derek Mahon and Thomas Kinsella, as well as writers like Trevor Joyce and Catherine Walsh who proclaim their adherence to the modernist tradition as an alternative to the dominant realist mainstream.\nMany major 20th-century composers including Luciano Berio, György Kurtág, Morton Feldman, Pascal Dusapin, Philip Glass, Roman Haubenstock-Ramati and Heinz Holliger have created musical works based on Beckett's texts. His work has also influenced numerous international writers, artists and filmmakers including Edward Albee, Avigdor Arikha, Paul Auster, J. M. Coetzee, Richard Kalich, Douglas Gordon, Bruce Nauman, Anthony Minghella, Damian Pettigrew and Charlie Kaufman.\n\nBeckett is one of the most widely discussed and highly prized of 20th-century authors, inspiring a critical industry to rival that which has sprung up around James Joyce. He has divided critical opinion. Some early philosophical critics, such as Sartre and Theodor Adorno, praised him, one for his revelation of absurdity, the other for his works' critical refusal of simplicities; others such as Georg Lukács condemned him for 'decadent' lack of realism.\n\nSince Beckett's death, all rights for performance of his plays are handled by the Beckett estate, currently managed by Edward Beckett (the author's nephew). The estate has a controversial reputation for maintaining firm control over how Beckett's plays are performed and does not grant licenses to productions that do not adhere to the writer's stage directions.\n\nHistorians interested in tracing Beckett's blood line were, in 2004, granted access to confirmed trace samples of his DNA to conduct molecular genealogical studies to facilitate precise lineage determination.\n\nSome of the best-known pictures of Beckett were taken by photographer John Minihan, who photographed him between 1980 and 1985 and developed such a good relationship with the writer that he became, in effect, his official photographer. Some consider one of these to be among the top three photographs of the 20th century. It was the theater photographer John Haynes, however, who took possibly the most widely reproduced image of Beckett: it is used on the cover of the Knowlson biography, for instance. This portrait was taken during rehearsals of the San Quentin Drama Workshop at the Royal Court Theatre in London, where Haynes photographed many productions of Beckett's work.\n\nAn Post, the Irish postal service, issued a commemorative stamp of Beckett in 1994.\nThe Central Bank of Ireland launched two Samuel Beckett Centenary commemorative coins on 26 April 2006: €10 Silver Coin and €20 Gold Coin.\n\nOn 10 December 2009, the new bridge across the River Liffey in Dublin was opened and named the Samuel Beckett Bridge in his honour. Reminiscent of a harp on its side, it was designed by the celebrated Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, who had also designed the James Joyce Bridge further upstream opened on Bloomsday (16 June) 2003. Attendees at the official opening ceremony included Beckett’s niece Caroline Murphy, his nephew Edward Beckett, poet Seamus Heaney and Barry McGovern.\n\nThe newest ship of the Irish Naval Service, the LÉ \"Samuel Beckett\" (P61), is named for Beckett. An Ulster History Circle blue plaque in his memory is located at Portora Royal School, Enniskillen, County Fermanagh.\n\nHappy Days Enniskillen International Beckett Festival is an annual multi-arts festival celebrating the work and influence of Beckett. The festival, founded in 2011, is held at Enniskillen, Northern Ireland where Beckett spent his formative years studying at Portora Royal School.\n\nMusic for three Samuel Beckett plays (\"Words and Music\", \"Cascando\", and \"...but the clouds...\"), was composed by Martin Pearlman which was commissioned by the 92nd Street Y in New York for the Beckett centennial and produced there and at Harvard University.\n\nSamuel Beckett's prolific career is spread across archives around the world. Significant collections include those at the Harry Ransom Center, Washington University, the University of Reading, Trinity College, Dublin, and Houghton Library. Given the scattered nature of these collections, an effort has been made to create a digital repository through the University of Antwerp.\n\n\nTheatre\n\nRadio\n\nTelevision\n\nCinema\nNovels\nShort prose\nNon-fiction\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1438514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1438514", "title": "Shooto", "text": "Shooto\n\nShooto is a combat sport and mixed martial arts organization that is governed by the \"Shooto Association\" and the \"International Shooto Commission\". Shooto was originally formed in 1985, as an organization and as a particular fighting system derived from shoot wrestling. Practitioners are referred to as shooters, similarly to practitioners of shoot wrestling. Shooto rules have evolved such that their events are now true mixed martial arts competitions.\n\nThe word \"shooto\" is an English transliteration of 修斗 (pronounced \"shū-to\"), an ateji derived from the English word \"shoot\". The word 修斗 can be translated as \"learn combat\".\nShooto was established as a \"New Martial arts\" (Shin-Kakutōgi) in 1985 by Satoru Sayama (the original Tiger Mask), a Japanese professional wrestler trained in shoot wrestling, who wished to create a sport that revolved around a realistic and effective fighting system. After its establishment New Martial arts was renamed \"Shooting\" which came from Shoot, a term of professional wrestling meaning \"Serious match\", but this changed to \"Shooto\" to avoid confusion with Shooting sports. Compared to the other professional wrestling organizations of the time, such as the New Japan Pro Wrestling and the Universal Wrestling Federation (Japan), Shooto was aimed at having no predetermined results. The first amateur event was held in 1986 and the first professional event in 1989.\n\nThe Shooto organization hosted the \"Vale Tudo Japan\" tournament in the summer of 1994. Previously to this tournament, Shooto did not feature punches to the face in a ground position, but after seeing effective usage of punching by foreign participants, Sayama decided to incorporate these striking techniques into shooto. In April 1996, \"World Shooto\", the \"Shooto Association\" and the \"International Shooto Commission\" were formed. This marked the end of Shooto as a single organization, and turned it into a combat sport with governing bodies. Since establishment of ISC, the champions of Shooto are called \"World Champion\". \"Vale Tudo Japan\" events were held annually from 1994 to 1999. In May 2009, it was announced that Vale Tudo Japan would return for the first time in ten years on October 30, 2009.\n\nShooto was brought to America in the late 1980s by top student of Satoru Sayama, Yorinaga Nakamura. He began teaching Shooto at the Inosanto Academy in 1991, and is the instructor of Erik Paulson, Ron Balicki, Dan Inosanto, Larry Hartsell, and many others.\n\nShooto South America, also known as ShootoBazil is managed by founder of Nova União mixed martial arts academy, André Pederneiras. Its first event was held in Rio de Janeiro in May 2002\n\nThere has been an ongoing effort to bring Shooto competition to the United States and Canada that has been spearheaded by Rich Santoro. He was officially named the Director of the International Shooto Commission - SHOOTO Americas division (the North American branch of the Shooto Association) in 2001. He has worked with both U.S. event promoters and state officials to spread the Shooto brand of competition throughout North America. As of 2006 Shooto has taken place in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee, Missouri, Nevada, Hawaii, and Vancouver, British Columbia. Promoters of Shooto events in North America have been HOOKnSHOOT, The Ironheart Crown, Midwest Fighting, Tennessee Shooto, RSF Shooto Challenge, TUFF-N-UFF, World Freestyle Fighting, SHOOTO Hawaii and Mannidog Productions.\n\nPrevious to 2009, Shooto's rules included a knockdown rule giving knocked down fighters an eight-count to recover as well as allowing strikes to the back of the head. Shooto had argued that the potential for a knocked out (and thus unconscious) fighter to receive unnecessary damage while on the ground necessitated the rule, but with Shooto being one of the lone organizations still having the rule, consideration of the potential for injury allowing a knocked down fighter time to recover thus allowing additional blows, and with the original vision of Shooto's founder being a synthesis of striking, throwing and submitting - the rule change was instituted in mid-2008. The disallowment of strikes to the back of the head was done for similar medical reasons.\n\nThe long-running Japanese league Shooto and sister organization Vale Tudo Japan live-streamed its first shows on UFC Fight Pass in 2016. Vale Tudo Japan bouts are contested in a cage instead of Shooto’s traditional ring,\nBroadcast schedules for both promotions were announced April 20, 2016 during a press conference in Tokyo.\nShooto made its Fight Pass debut Saturday, April 23, with “Fight & Mosh” live from Maihama Amphitheater in Urayasu, Japan. Two world titles were on the line, Masaaki Sugawara made his first defense of the 125-pound belt against Hiromasa Ogikubo, plus Koshi Matsumoto and Yuki Kawana vied for the vacant 155-pound mantle.\nShooto followed that up with events on July 17 and Nov. 12, both took place at Korakuen Hall in Tokyo as well as VTJ in Osaka” June 19 at Osaka Prefectural Gymnasium, and “VTJ 9th” on Sept. 19 which saw the organization return to its birthplace of Chiba prefecture.\n\nThe aim in a shooto match is to defeat the opponent by a knockout or a submission, but fights can also end in a referee stoppage or by a judge decision. Legal techniques include general grappling, chokeholds, joint locks, kicks, knee strikes, punches, takedowns and throws. Illegal techniques include biting, elbow strikes, eye-gouging, forearm strikes, hair pulling, headbutting, kicking or kneeing the head of a downed opponent, small joint manipulation, strikes to the groin or throat and since September 1, 2008, strikes to the back of the head.\n\nShooto fighters are categorized into four Classes.\n\nFighters start out as Class-D or Class-C fighters and enter amateur competitions that Shooto hosts together with the help of local gyms all over Japan. Class-D Shooto does not allow knee strikes to the face or striking on the ground. Class-C Shooto does not allow striking on the ground, but knee strikes to the head are allowed. There are regional championship and once a year the All-Japan amateur championships. Then a fighter can get a Class-B pro license, these fights are 2x5 minute long and use the same rules as Class-A fights. Shooto holds yearly rookie tournaments in each weightclass.\n\nWhen a fighter has gathered enough wins and experience in Class-B he will get awarded with a Class-A license, as a sign that he's part of the elite professional fighters.\n\n\n"}

These songs rose in popularity during summer and thus classify as summer hits. In some years, a single pop song will gain widespread international popularity during the summer holiday season, becoming that summer's definitive summer hit in many countries. Many of the best-known summer hits emerge from outside the British and American pop music industries.\n\nSongs that are marketed to be summer hits are very common, and often feature an upbeat tempo and descriptions of things such as relaxation outdoors and beach parties. These are songs considered ideal listening during summer activities. These intentional summer hits are most common in country (particularly country pop) and mainstream popular music but are much less common in rock.\n\nThe opposite of a summer hit in the music industries of the Northern Hemisphere in the West would be a Christmas song, a category that usually incorporates general winter songs as well.\n\n"}
{"id": "751718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=751718", "title": "Temple Bar, Dublin", "text": "Temple Bar, Dublin\n\nTemple Bar () is an area on the south bank of the River Liffey in central Dublin, Ireland. The area is bounded by the Liffey to the north, Dame Street to the south, Westmoreland Street to the east and Fishamble Street to the west. It is promoted as Dublin's 'cultural quarter' and, as a centre of Dublin's city centre's nightlife, is a tourist destination.\n\nTemple Bar is in the postcode Dublin 2 (D2).\n\nIn medieval (Anglo-Norman) times, the name of the district was St. Andrews Parish. It was a suburb, located outside the city walls. But the area fell into disuse beginning in the 14th century because it was exposed to attacks by the native Irish.\n\nThe land was redeveloped again in the 17th century, to create gardens for the houses of wealthy English families. At that time the shoreline of the River Liffey ran further inland of where it lies today, along the line formed by Essex Street, Temple Bar and Fleet Street. Marshy land to the river side of this line was progressively walled in and reclaimed, allowing houses to be built upon what had been the shoreline; but unusually, the reclaimed land was not quayed, so that the back yards of the houses ran down to the water's edge. (Not until 1812 were these back yards replaced by Wellington Quay.) The fronts of the houses then constituted a new street. The first mention of Temple Bar as the name of this street is in Bernard de Gomme's Map of Dublin from 1673, which shows the reclaimed land and new buildings. Other street names given nearby are Dammas Street (now Dame Street) and Dirty Lane (now Temple Lane South).\nIt is generally thought that the street known as Temple Bar got its name from the Temple family, whose progenitor Sir William Temple built a house and gardens there in the early 1600s. Temple had moved to Ireland in 1599 with the expeditionary force of the Earl of Essex, for whom he served as secretary. (He had previously been secretary of Sir Philip Sydney until the latter was killed in battle.) After Essex was beheaded for treason in 1601, Temple \"retired into private life\", but he was then solicited to become provost of Trinity College, serving from 1609 until his death in 1627 at age 72. William Temple's son John became the \"Master of the Rolls in Ireland\" and was the author of a famous pamphlet excoriating the native Irish population for an uprising in 1641. John's son William Temple became a famous English statesman.\n\nDespite this grand lineage, however, the name of Temple Bar street seems to have been more directly borrowed from the storied Temple Bar district in London, where the main toll-gate into London was located dating back to medieval times. \n\nLondon's Temple Bar is adjoined by Essex Street to the west and Fleet Street to the east, and streets of the same names occupy similar positions in relation to Dublin's Temple Bar. It seems almost certain therefore that Dublin's Temple Bar was named firstly in imitation of the historic Temple precinct in London. However, a secondary and equally plausible reason for using the name Temple Bar in Dublin would be a reference to one of the area's most prominent families, in a sort of pun or play on words. Or as it has been put more succinctly, Temple Bar 'does honour to London and the landlord in nicely-gauged proportions'.\n\nFishamble Street near Temple Bar was the location of the first performance of Handel's \"Messiah\" on 13 April 1742. An annual performance of the \"Messiah\" is held on the same date at the same location. A republican revolutionary group, the Society of the United Irishmen, was formed at a meeting in a tavern in Eustace Street in 1791.\n\nIn the 18th century Temple Bar was the centre of prostitution in Dublin. During the 19th century, the area slowly declined in popularity, and in the 20th century, it suffered from urban decay, with many derelict buildings.\n\nIn the 1980s, the state-owned transport company Córas Iompair Éireann (C.I.É.) proposed to buy up and demolish property in the area and build a bus terminus in its place. While that was in the planning stages, the purchased buildings were let out at low rents, which attracted small shops, artists and galleries to the area. Protests by An Taisce, residents and traders led to the cancellation of the bus station project, and then Taoiseach Charles Haughey was responsible for securing funding, and, in 1991, the government set up a not-for-profit company called \"Temple Bar Properties\" to oversee the regeneration of the area as Dublin's cultural quarter.\n\nIn 1999, \"stag parties\" and \"hen nights\" were supposedly banned (or discouraged) from Temple Bar, mainly due to drunken loutish behaviour, although this seems to have lapsed. However, noise and anti-social behaviour remain a problem at night.\n\nThe area is the location of a number of cultural institutions, including the Irish Photography Centre (incorporating the Dublin Institute of Photography, the National Photographic Archive and the Gallery of Photography), the Ark Children's Cultural Centre, the Irish Film Institute, incorporating the Irish Film Archive, the Button Factory, the Arthouse Multimedia Centre, Temple Bar Gallery and Studios, the Project Arts Centre, the Gaiety School of Acting, IBAT College Dublin, the New Theatre, as well as the Irish Stock Exchange.\n\nAfter dark, the area is a centre for nightlife, with various tourist-focused nightclubs, restaurants and bars. Pubs in the area include The Temple Bar Pub, The Porterhouse, the Oliver St. John Gogarty, the Turk's Head, Czech Inn, the Quays Bar, the Foggy Dew, The Auld Dubliner and Bad Bobs.\n\nThe area has two renovated squares – \"Meetinghouse Square\" and the central \"Temple Bar Square\". The Temple Bar Book Market is held on Saturdays and Sundays in Temple Bar Square. Meetinghouse Square, which takes its name from the nearby Quaker Meeting House, is used for outdoor film-screenings in the summer months. Since summer 2004, Meetinghouse Square is also home to the 'Speaker's Square' project (an area of public speaking) and to the 'Temple Bar Food Market' on Saturdays.\n\nThe 'Cow's Lane Market' is a fashion and design market which takes place on Cow's Lane on Saturdays.\n\nPart of the 13th century is visible within an apartment/restaurant complex called 'The Friary'.\n\nA dance sequence from Bollywood film \"Ek Tha Tiger\" was filmed in the area. Irish singer/songwriter Billy Treacy wrote a song about the area, and country singer Nathan Carter as well as Irish rock band Kodaline have released songs called Temple Bar.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34541638", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34541638", "title": "The American Girls Premiere", "text": "The American Girls Premiere\n\nThe American Girls Premiere is an educational computer game developed and published by The Learning Company for American Girl. The game allows players to create theatrical productions featuring characters from American Girl's Historical collection, along with scenes and other elements unique to each of the girls' respective time periods.\n\nIt is the first installment of the \"American Girl\" series, and so far the only one to date to be released on Mac OS; subsequent personal computer titles in the series were released for Windows. \"The American Girls Premiere\" was later followed by \"\", a paper doll-based software toy released by Mattel Interactive in 1999.\n\nBuilt upon the earlier MECC game \"Opening Night\", \"The American Girls Premiere\" allows the creation and direction of unique stage plays starring the Historical Characters, from Felicity Merriman, representing the American Revolution, to Molly McIntire, daughter of an army doctor during World War II, alongside supporting characters from each of the girls' story arcs.\n\nAfter selecting a character, players are presented with a stage to which plays are created or presented, utilizing a drag-and-drop interface to add actors, props, lighting and other elements to the scene. Digitized sprites taken from live actors and props from American Girl's historical collection are used throughout the game, \"à la\"-\"Mortal Kombat\". Each of the characters have their own set of outfits based on the historical era their stories take place in, e.g. long gowns and petticoats for Felicity or argyle sweaters and blouses for Molly, along with scenarios from their respective time period. Players can also add dialogue in their productions, either through a voice recording, or using the built-in text-to-speech feature. The game develops skills in storytelling and writing, and is open-ended in nature, allowing the player to create theatrical productions at his or her own leisure, though the limited selection of characters, props and settings may present creative constraints to some players.\n\nIn addition to the main game, bonus content such as a tutorial application and a sampler called the \"Director's Guide\" is included for players to get acquainted with the game's mechanics and user interface, along with a behind-the-scenes look on production as well as historical facts and commentary on American history and culture, and backstories for each of the characters.\n\nThe game marked the debut of Pleasant Company – the creator of the \"American Girl\" franchise – into the digital software space. Linda Ehrmann, vice president of Internet business strategy consulting firm Grey Interactive, said that the video game had a due potential as it was entering a relatively untapped market, commenting that in the interactive media space, \"girls are for the most part totally ignored.\"\n\nThe game could be bought from major software retailers or ordered directly from The Learning Company or American Girl.\n\nA \"Special Edition Collector's Set\" of the title was double the price, and in addition to the CD-ROM, it came with: \"a keepsake tin, a one-year club membership, a club handbook, a membership card, a baseball cap and six bi-monthly issues of the club newspaper\".\n\nAn update to the game subtitled 2nd Edition was released in 1998, adding Josefina Montoya to the roster in line with the aforementioned doll's debut. The \"2nd Edition\" release is a standalone expansion pack containing characters and scenes from the first release, and does not require a copy of the original game to play. The aforementioned \"Collector's Set\" was later updated to include the Josefina-specific content from the 2nd Edition, though it is missing the American Girls Club membership kit.\n\n\"The American Girls Premiere\" was released to mostly positive reception, with praise being given for providing children a \"creative outlet\"; a number of reviewers however criticized the user interface to be intimidating and complicated. Children's software review site SuperKids noted that \"Those who chose to spend time with the program were delighted with their creations,\" Lisa Karen Savignano of AllGame also noted the game's steep learning curve and limited selection of scenarios and props for authoring stage productions, but gave \"American Girls Premiere\" a largely positive review, stating \"I think any girl would be entertained by this and it may start them on the road to creating not just plays, but stories and art of their own,\" Kevin Mukhar of Computer Shopper thought the game would provide hours of open-ended play to young girls ages 7–12 who liked the \"American Girl\" franchise. A reviewer from The Wisconsin State Journal praised the game for being \"historically accurate\", easy to use, and providing players with \"limitless creativity\". The Buffalo News commented that the title wouldn't appeal to the \"easily bored\" or \"readily frustrated\", but that it would thrill players who were willing to invest both the time and energy. The Capital Times praised the artwork as \"rich and detailed\", and noted that the interface was user-friendly. Playthings deemed it a \"winner\". Clint Basinger of \"Lazy Game Reviews\" also criticized \"Premiere\"'s similarity to \"Opening Night\" and what he saw as limited educational value, but praised its appeal to fans of the American Girl franchise, calling it a \"neat little program\" and a \"fascinating industry case study\" on video games aimed at girls and repackaging an existing product to drive sales through the use of a licensed property.\n\nMany reviewers noted that \"The American Girls Premiere\" was a prime example of video games targeted at the female demographic. Deborah Porterfield of the Chicago Sun-Times described the title as \"for girls\" and \"girl-oriented\". The Buffallo News suggested that the game was \"at the top of many girls' Christmas wish lists\". Citing this title as an example, The Boston Globe reviewer Joann Muller suggested that while the video game industry had begun to make commercially successful titles that appealed to the female demographic, the rushed targeting of games directly to girls could \"perpetuate gender stereotypes\" and \"[not] teach girls anything of value about computers\". The Buffalo News thought this game was the first \"girl-targeted software\" from The Learning Company, a company that had built its catalogue from \"gender-neutral educational software\". Rocky Mountain News reported that Children's Software Revue gave the title a \"tentative endorsement\" due to offering a \"female spin\" to traditional video game genres such as adventure.\n\nIn December 1997, the game \"achieved the highest monthly dollar and unit sales of any single product\" in the history of The Learning Company up to that point. In March 1998, The Boston Globe said the girls' category of the video game market was \"exploding\" with titles such as \"Barbie Fashion Designer\" (by Mattel), \"The American Girls Premiere, Let's Talk About Me,\" (by Simon & Schuster Interactive) and \"Rockett's New School\" (by Purple Moon). In July 1998, The Buffalo News reported that The Learning Company had captured 20.3% of the girl video game market with this video game.\n\nThe game was nominated at the 1998 Interactive Achievement Award for Computer Innovation, and won a Gold Award from the Parents' Choice Foundation. The game also won a Mom's Choice Software award for Fall 1997, and a 1998 selection in American Library Association's Great Interactive Software for Kids List.\n\nIn a similar vein to \"Moonbase Alpha\", \"The American Girls Premiere\" has gained a cult following due to its use of a text-to-speech system by Lernout & Hauspie, which most players find to be ironically appealing. Adding to the unintentional humor is the lack of collision detection and other quirks within the game engine allowing characters to perform unusual movements, which led to a number of parody machinima clips on YouTube and other video sharing platforms.\n"}
{"id": "28924501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28924501", "title": "Weiß Schwarz", "text": "Weiß Schwarz\n\nThe game focuses on 2 main aspects, character battle and clock/level which regulate what cards can be played as well as acting as a player's life point.\n\n\nThe player's deck is placed face down in this area and consists of 50 cards. Unlike other trading card games when the deck runs out of cards the player reconstructs a deck out of the cards in their waiting room.\n\nCards placed in this area represent the player's level. Upon reaching level 4, the player loses.\n\nWhen a player takes damage, the amount is then added in cards to this area. This zone can hold up to six cards at time. However, when a seventh card is added the player is forced to level up.\n\nCards representing \"Stock\" are placed in this area. Cards in this area are placed faced down after trigger check and cannot be revised or rearranged.\n\nA maximum of one face-up Climax card is allowed in this zone. At the end phase a card in this area is sent to the Waiting Room.\n\nConsists of five stage positions. Character cards are placed face-up in these areas. There are two types of Stage Areas:\n\nThe three foremost positions make up the Center Stage. Character cards placed in this area can battle with opponent's Character cards directly in front of them.\n\nThe two rear positions make up the Back stage. Character cards placed in this area cannot battle with opponent's Character cards. However, cards in this usually possess support abilities.\n\nCards that have been retired/used are placed in this area. Example: Character cards defeated in battle.\n\nThe cards that are removed from the game are placed in this area.\n\nGameplay of Weiß Schwarz is broken into several phases during a players turn:\n\nAll characters on the active player's Stage in [Rest] are returned to [Stand].\n\nThe active player draws a card from the top of his deck.\n\nThe active player may choose to discard one card from his hand into his/her Clock Area to draw 2 additional cards from his/her deck.\n\nThe phase where you play and move characters or event cards and activate start up abilities/effects.\n\nWhen you play a card, you have to match the three conditions (level, cost, and color) in order to play the card.\n\nClimax cards are played during this phase.\n\nThe player declares an attack of choice with his/her characters one at a time to damage the opponent's life points (called \"Clock\" in Weiß Schwarz) and also their characters (if present) at the same time.\nDuring the first turn of the game, the player who goes first may only declare an attack with one character.\nOnly Characters that are in [Stand] Position and in the Center Stage can declare attacks.\nCharacters declaring attack will be put to [Rest] position from [Stand] position.\nThe 3 different types of Attack:\nThis attack is the default attack when a character is attacking an empty slot.\nThe attacking character will gain an additional Soul Damage to the Soul Damage total.\nThe player may choose this attack when a character is attacking and there is a character opposing it. Battle between the characters will occur and the character with the lower Power will be put to [Reverse]. Characters that are put to [Reverse] will be sent to the Waiting Room during the Encore Phase unless otherwise stated.\nThe player may choose this attack when a character is attacking and there is a character opposing it. Battle between the characters will NOT occur. The attacking character will suffer a Soul Damage penalty that is equivalent to the Level of the opposing character.\n\nUpon declaring an attack from front attack, side attack, or direct attack, a card is flipped over from your deck as trigger to check for trigger (effect varies upon trigger) and the card goes into stock.\n\nIf you declared a front attack, your opponent may play a character/event counter card, if they have one.\n\nYour opponent takes damage equivalent to your soul output + soul trigger upon trigger step (if any) onto their clock. 7 cards on the clock raises your level by 1, and any additional damage are retained onto your next level. However, should you flip over a climax card, all the damage sustained for that damage step is canceled, and they are moved into the waiting room (discard pile) instead.\n\nThis Phase occurs only when a Front Attack is declared.\nA Power comparison between the characters is done and the character with the lower Power is put to [Reverse].\nIf the power of both battling characters are the same, both of them are put to [Reverse].\n\nThis Phase occurs when the Main Player has decided to stop attacking.\nAll Characters that are in the [Reverse] state are sent to the Waiting Room.\nBoth Players are allowed to \"Revive\" their characters by paying the characters' respective Encore cost.\nEven when not stated, all character cards comes with a built-in ability [Auto] Encore (3), which means that a player may pay 3 cost from his/her stock to \"Revive\" a character which has been put to [Reverse].\nThe Encored characters will be put back from the Waiting Room in [Rest] position to their original position on the Center Stage.\n\nYou pass on your turn to the opponent.\n\nThere are 3 main type of cards in Weiß Schwarz, namely character cards, event cards and climax cards. They are further broken down into colors and level subcategory. A deck can contain any four copies of cards with the same name, and no more than 8 climax cards per deck. The number of cards in a deck build is exactly 50.\n\nCharacter cards form the base of the gameplay, serving as your means of damaging the opponent and subsequently defeating them. Character cards have several features which include the level and cost on the top left, soul trigger on the top right, effects, color, power, soul output and traits on the bottom of the card. To play a character, you have to meet the color requirement (applies only to card level 1 and above), the cost requirement and the level requirement.\n\nEvent cards act as an instant play card during your main phase which may give functions like retrievals or healing effects. Event cards have to meet color and level requirements to be played.\n\nClimax cards act as a means to boost your soul and power damage output during your climax phase upon play, as means to increase soul output or resources advantage upon triggering on trigger phase and also serves as damage canceler during damage phase. Because of the usefulness of climax cards, a deck is capped at 8 climaxes. Climax card have to meet the color requirement to be played during climax phase.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2421208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2421208", "title": "Z Channel", "text": "Z Channel\n\nThe Z Channel was one of the first pay television stations in the United States. Launched in 1974 from Los Angeles, California, this station was known for its devotion to the art of cinema due to the eclectic choice of films by the programming chief, Jerry Harvey. It also popularized the use of letterboxing on television, as well as showing 'director's cut' versions of films (which is a term popularized after Z Channel's showing of \"Heaven's Gate\"). Z Channel's devotion to cinema and choice of rare and important films had an important influence on such directors as Robert Altman, Quentin Tarantino, and Jim Jarmusch.\n\nZ Channel was launched in 1974 by Theta Cable (a division of TelePrompTer Corporation and Hughes Aircraft Co.) which was acquired by Group W (Westinghouse) in 1981. Operations were located in Santa Monica, California. Jerry Harvey was hired as program director in 1980. As program director, Harvey was given permission to program the network the way he saw fit. As such, the network featured a wide variety of films not typically shown on other pay television services at the time. \n\nThese included many B movies, silent films, foreign films, and original unedited versions of films. \nOn Christmas Eve 1982, Harvey made the decision to show the original (previously unreleased in two years) version of \"Heaven's Gate\", a movie that had been considered a disaster by all accounts. His decision was a success and the movie became the most watched feature ever shown on Z Channel. Other networks soon followed and aired \"Heaven's Gate.\"\n\nBy the mid-1980s, Z Channel had 90,000 subscribers. In 1987, Group W sold Z Channel to Seattle-based Rock Associates for $5 million. Both increased competition and lack of interest by Group W leading up to the sale led to a decrease in subscribers. In January 1988, Rock Associates merged with American Spectacor.\n\nIn April 1988, there were two major (though unrelated) changes; the departure of Jerry Harvey due to his suicide and the addition of sports to the network. Deals were made to bring games from the Angels, Clippers and Dodgers to the network. This increased the numbers of subscribers to 110,000. The sports deals were funded by selling advertising during the games. However, a lawsuit ensued with a court ruling that contracts with the movie studios stipulated that the service be commercial-free.\n\nOut of options, the channel was sold to Cablevision and NBC on March 16, 1989, who were partners in the joint-venture SportsChannel. On June 29, 1989 Z Channel faded to black and was replaced by SportsChannel Los Angeles. The last film shown on Z Channel was the John Ford film \"My Darling Clementine.\"\n\nThe channel was the subject of the 2004 documentary \"\", which was directed by Alexandra Cassavetes, daughter of John Cassavetes. \n\nIn the late 1980s, Z Channel broadcast a number of the World Wrestling Federation's live events from the Los Angeles Sports Arena, but nowhere near as many as Madison Square Garden (MSG Network), Boston Garden (New England Sports Network) or the Philadelphia Spectrum (PRISM).\n\n\n"}
