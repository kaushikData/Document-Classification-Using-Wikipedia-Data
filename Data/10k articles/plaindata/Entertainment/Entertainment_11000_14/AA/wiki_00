{"id": "2798805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2798805", "title": "3 Women", "text": "3 Women\n\n3 Women is a 1977 American avant-garde drama film written and directed by Robert Altman and starring Shelley Duvall, Sissy Spacek and Janice Rule. It depicts the increasingly bizarre, mysterious relationship between a woman (Duvall) and her roommate and co-worker (Spacek) in a dusty, underpopulated Californian desert town.\n\nThe story came directly from a dream Altman had, which he adapted into a treatment, intending to film without a screenplay. 20th Century Fox financed the project on the basis of Altman's past work, and a screenplay was completed before filming.\n\n\"3 Women\" premiered at the 1977 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d'Or and Duvall received the Best Actress Award. It received widespread critical acclaim. Interpretation of the film has involved use of psychoanalysis and discussion of identity. It was not a strong box office success despite Hollywood studio financing and distribution. After its theatrical release, the film was unavailable on home video for almost thirty years, until it was released by The Criterion Collection in 2004.\n\nPinky Rose, a timid and awkward young woman, begins working at a health spa for the elderly in a small California desert town. She becomes enamored of Millie Lammoreaux, a relentlessly outgoing and self-absorbed co-worker who talks incessantly. Despite their stark personality differences, Pinky and Millie become roommates at the Purple Sage Apartments, owned by a drinking, womanizing, has-been Hollywood stunt double, Edgar Hart, and his wife Willie, a mysterious pregnant woman who rarely speaks and paints striking and unsettling murals.\n\nMillie takes Pinky along on her visits to Dodge City, a local tavern and shooting range also owned by Willie and Edgar, where Millie continues espousing her petty opinions and interests to her new roommate. Millie's babble alienates most of her co-workers, neighbors, acquaintances, and would-be suitors; Pinky is the only person in Millie's orbit who enjoys her advice about dating, fashion, cuisine and interior decorating gleaned from women's magazines.\n\nTensions begin to rise between Pinky and Millie over their living situation. One night, after Millie prepares a dinner party for friends who fail to show up, she gets into a fight with Pinky and leaves the apartment, only to return with a drunk Edgar. Pinky begs Millie to consider Edgar's pregnant wife, Willie, and not have sex with him. Millie, angry at what she perceives as Pinky's meddling and sabotaging her social life, yells at her and suggests she move out of the apartment. A distraught Pinky jumps off the apartment balcony into the swimming pool.\n\nPinky survives the suicide attempt but falls into a coma. Millie, feeling responsible, visits her in the hospital daily. When Pinky still fails to wake up, Millie contacts Pinky's parents in Texas, hoping their presence at the hospital will help her regain consciousness. She wakes up, but does not recognize her parents and furiously demands that they leave. Once sent home to live with Millie again, Pinky begins to copy Millie's mannerisms and behavior—drinking and smoking, sleeping with Edgar, shooting guns at Dodge City—and demanding to be called \"Mildred\", both women's birth name.\n\nMillie becomes increasingly frustrated by Pinky's imitative shift in personality, and begins to exhibit Pinky's timid and submissive personality herself. One night after Pinky has a bad dream, she shares a bed with Millie platonically. A drunken Edgar enters their apartment and awakens them, initially making sexual overtures to Pinky before casually telling both women that Willie is about to give birth. Pinky and Millie drive to Edgar and Willie's house, where Willie is alone and in agonizing labor. Her baby is stillborn, as Pinky fails to summon medical help during the delivery as Millie tells her to. Millie slaps Pinky in anger.\n\nLater, Pinky and Millie are working at Dodge City, having again changed roles: Pinky has reverted to her child-like timidity and refers to Millie as her mother, while Millie has assumed Willie's role in running the tavern—even imitating Willie's make-up and attire. A delivery vendor at the tavern refers to Edgar's death from a \"gun accident\" when talking to Millie, who offers a pat, hollow reply that suggests the three women are complicit in Edgar's murder. Pinky and Millie walk to Willie's rustic house behind the tavern, where the three prepare dinner together under Millie's supervision.\n\nDirector Robert Altman conceived of the idea for \"3 Women\" while his wife was being treated in a hospital, and he was deeply concerned as to whether she would die. During a restless sleep, he had a dream in which he was directing a film starring Shelley Duvall and Sissy Spacek in an identity theft story, against a desert backdrop. He stated he woke up mid dream, jotted notes on a pad, and went back to sleep, receiving more details.\n\nUpon waking up, he wanted to make the film, although the dream had not provided him with a complete storyline. Altman consulted author Patricia Resnick to develop a treatment, drawing up 50 pages, initially with no intent to write a full screenplay. Ingmar Bergman's 1966 film \"Persona\" was also an influence on the film.\n\nAltman secured approval from 20th Century Fox, which supported the project on the basis of the success of his 1970 film \"MASH\". Studio manager Alan Ladd Jr. also found the story idea interesting, and respected the fact that Altman consistently worked within his budget in past films, as this was before Altman's 1980 film version of \"Popeye\" considerably exceeded its initially approved budget.\n\nThe film was shot in Palm Springs, including the apartment scenes, and Desert Hot Springs, California. Although a screenplay was completed, actresses Duvall and Spacek employed much improvisation, particularly in Duvall's silly ramblings and advice on dating. Altman also credited Duvall with drawing up her character's recipes and diary.\n\nFor Willie's paintings, the filmmakers employed artist Bodhi Wind, whose real name was Charles Kuklis. The cinematographer, Chuck Roscher, worked with the intense sunlight in the Californian desert.\n\nIn one scene, Duvall's character's skirt gets caught in a car door. This initially happened accidentally in one take, after which assistant director Tommy Thompson called for a cut. However, Altman stated he \"loved\" the accident, and shot more takes deliberately repeating it.\n\nAltman has said the film is about \"empty vessels in an empty landscape\". Psychiatrist Glen O. Gabbard and Krin Gabbard believed \"3 Women\" could best be understood through psychoanalysis and the study of dreams. In theory, a person dreaming can shift from one character into another within the dream. The three titular characters in the film represent the psyche of one person. Whereas Pinky is the child among the three, Millie is the sexually awakened young woman and the pregnant Willie is the mother figure. The Gabbard siblings interpreted Pinky, post-coma, as transforming into Millie, while Millie became more of a mother figure to her. Altman equated the death of Willie's child to the murder of Edgar, which the three title characters appear to all have participated in.\n\nAuthor David Greven agreed psychoanalysis could be used, but saw the relationship between Millie and Pinky as one of mother and daughter, respectively, with Willie at the end of the film being the \"grandmotherly figure\" who defends Pinky from Millie's scornful mothering. Greven wrote the film also demonstrated a focus on strong female characters.\nWriter Frank Caso identified themes of the film as including obsession, schizophrenia and personality disorder, and linked the film to Altman's earlier films \"That Cold Day in the Park\" (1969) and \"Images\" (1972), declaring them a trilogy. Caso states critics have argued the dreamer in the film is Willie, since she says she had a dream at the end of the film, and Pinky had the \"dream within a dream\".\n\nThe setting is also a key feature in the film, with Joe McElhaney arguing the California landscapes \"come to represent something much larger than a 'mere' location\". He states it is \"a space of death but also one of creation\".\n\nThe film opened in New York City in April 1977. The film was also screened at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1977, which was where Altman first admitted to Ladd the film was based on his dream.\n\nOn home video, the film never had a VHS release, and Altman said the film negative was beginning to deteriorate until it was repaired and remastered. However, The Criterion Collection released the film on DVD in 2004, with a director's commentary. Criterion re-released the film on Blu-ray in 2011.\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics. Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, calling the first half \"a funny, satirical, and sometimes sad study of the community and its people,\" and adding the film then turns into \"masked sexual horror\". Vincent Canby, writing for \"The New York Times\", called \"3 Women\" a \"funny, moving\" film, and Millie \"one of the most memorable characterizations Mr. Altman has ever given us,\" giving credit to Duvall as well. Molly Haskell, in \"New York\", ranked the film as the second best of the year, describing it as \"ambitious, pretentious, gentle, goofy and mesmerizing\". \"Texas Monthly\" critics Marie Brenner and Jesse Kornbluth stated Altman had a likely desire to be the \"American Bergman,\" calling \"3 Women\" \"an attempt at equaling Bergman's \"Persona\"\". Brenner and Kornbluth credited Duvall for an \"extraordinary performance,\" but lamented the second-half shedding a documentary style.\n\nEbert added \"3 Women\" to his Great Movies list in 2004, calling it \"Robert Altman's 1977 masterpiece\" and stating Duvall's expressions are \"a study in unease\". Writing for \"The New Yorker\", Michael Sragow remarked \"In the Robert Altman canon, no picture is stranger—and more fascinating—than this 1977 phantasmagoria,\" adding it is \"full of images so rich that they transcend its metaphoric structure,\" praising Duvall. The film has a 96% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 27 reviews.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "70502", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70502", "title": "Baritone", "text": "Baritone\n\nA baritone is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range lies between the bass and the tenor voice types. Originally from the Greek (), meaning \"heavy sounding\", music for this voice is typically written in the range from the second F below middle C to the F# above middle C (i.e. F–F) in choral music, and from the second F below middle C to the F above middle C (F to F) in operatic music, but can be extended at either end. The baritone voice type is generally divided into the baryton-Martin baritone (light baritone), lyric baritone, \"Kavalierbariton\", Verdi baritone, dramatic baritone, \"baryton-noble\" baritone, and the bass-baritone.\n\nThe first use of the term \"baritone\" emerged as \"baritonans\", late in the 15th century, usually in French sacred polyphonic music. At this early stage it was frequently used as the lowest of the voices (including the bass), but in 17th-century Italy the term was all-encompassing and used to describe the average male choral voice.\n\nBaritones took roughly the range as it is known today at the beginning of the 18th century, but they were still lumped in with their bass colleagues until well into the 19th century. Indeed, many operatic works of the 18th century have roles marked as bass that in reality are low baritone roles (or bass-baritone parts in modern parlance). Examples of this are to be found, for instance, in the operas and oratorios of George Frideric Handel. The greatest and most enduring parts for baritones in 18th-century operatic music were composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. They include Count Almaviva in \"The Marriage of Figaro\", Guglielmo in \"Così fan tutte\", Papageno in \"The Magic Flute\" and the lead in \"Don Giovanni\".\n\nIn theatrical documents, cast lists, and journalistic dispatches that from the beginning of the 19th century till the mid 1820s, the terms \"primo basso\", \"basse chantante\", and \"basse-taille\" were often used for men who would later be called baritones. These included the likes of Filippo Galli, Giovanni Inchindi, and Henri-Bernard Dabadie. The basse-taille and the proper bass were commonly confused because their roles were sometimes sung by singers of either actual voice part.\n\nThe bel canto style of vocalism which arose in Italy in the early 19th century supplanted the castrato-dominated \"opera seria\" of the previous century. It led to the baritone being viewed as a separate voice category from the bass. Traditionally, basses in operas had been cast as authority figures such as a king or high priest; but with the advent of the more fluid baritone voice, the roles allotted by composers to lower male voices expanded in the direction of trusted companions or even romantic leads—normally the province of tenors. More often than not, however, baritones found themselves portraying villains.\n\nThe principal composers of bel canto opera are considered to be:\nThe prolific operas of these composers, plus the works of Verdi's maturity, such as \"Un ballo in maschera\", \"La forza del destino\", \"Don Carlos\"/\"Don Carlo\", the revised \"Simon Boccanegra\", \"Aida\", \"Otello\" and \"Falstaff\", blazed many new and rewarding performance pathways for baritones.\nFigaro in \"Il barbiere\" is often called the first true baritone role. However, Donizetti and Verdi in their vocal writing went on to emphasize the top fifth of the baritone voice, rather than its lower notes—thus generating a more brilliant sound. Further pathways opened up when the musically complex and physically demanding operas of Richard Wagner began to enter the mainstream repertory of the world's opera houses during the second half of the 19th century.\n\nThe major international baritone of the first half of the 19th century was the Italian Antonio Tamburini (1800–1876). He was a famous Don Giovanni in Mozart's eponymous opera as well as being a Bellini and Donizetti specialist. Commentators praised his voice for its beauty, flexibility and smooth tonal emission, which are the hallmarks of a bel canto singer. Tamburini's range, however, was probably closer to that of a bass-baritone than to that of a modern \"Verdi baritone\". His French equivalent was Henri-Bernard Dabadie, who was a mainstay of the Paris Opera between 1819 and 1836 and the creator of several major Rossinian baritone roles, including Guillaume Tell. Dabadie sang in Italy, too, where he originated the role of Belcore in \"L'elisir d'amore\" in 1832.\n\nThe most important of Tamburini's Italianate successors were all Verdians. They included:\n\nAmong the non-Italian born baritones that were active in the third quarter of the 19th century, Tamburini's mantle as an outstanding exponent of Mozart and Donizetti's music was probably taken up most faithfully by a Belgian, Camille Everardi, who later settled in Russia and taught voice. In France, Paul Barroilhet succeeded Dabadie as the Paris opera's best known baritone. Like Dabadie, he also sang in Italy and created an important Donizetti role: in his case, Alphonse in \"La favorite\" (in 1840).\n\nLuckily, the gramophone was invented early enough to capture on disc the voices of the top Italian Verdi and Donizetti baritones of the last two decades of the 19th century, whose operatic performances were characterized by considerable re-creative freedom and a high degree of technical finish. They included Mattia Battistini (known as the \"King of Baritones\"), Giuseppe Kaschmann (born Josip Kašman) who, atypically, sang Wagner's Telramund and Amfortas not in Italian but in German, at the Bayreuth Festival in the 1890s; Giuseppe Campanari; Antonio Magini-Coletti; Mario Ancona (chosen to be the first Silvio in \"Pagliacci\"); and Antonio Scotti, who came to the Met from Europe in 1899 and remained on the roster of singers until 1933. Antonio Pini-Corsi was the standout Italian \"buffo\" baritone in the period between about 1880 and World War I, reveling in comic opera roles by Rossini, Donizetti and Paer, among others. In 1893, he created the part of Ford in Verdi's last opera, \"Falstaff\".\n\nNotable among their contemporaries were the cultured and technically adroit French baritones Jean Lassalle (hailed as the most accomplished baritone of his generation), Victor Maurel (the creator of Verdi's Iago, Falstaff and Tonio in Leoncavallo's \"Pagliacci\"), Paul Lhérie (the first Posa in the revised, Italian-language version of \"Don Carlos\"), and Maurice Renaud (a singing actor of the first magnitude). Lassalle, Maurel and Renaud enjoyed superlative careers on either side of the Atlantic and left a valuable legacy of recordings. Five other significant Francophone baritones who recorded, too, during the early days of the gramophone/phonograph were Léon Melchissédec and Jean Noté of the Paris Opera and Gabriel Soulacroix, Henry Albers and Charles Gilibert of the Opéra-Comique. The Quaker baritone David Bispham, who sang in London and New York between 1891 and 1903, was the leading American male singer of this generation. He also recorded for the gramophone.\n\nThe oldest-born star baritone known for sure to have made solo gramophone discs was the Englishman Sir Charles Santley (1834–1922). Santley made his operatic debut in Italy in 1858 and became one of Covent Garden's leading singers. He was still giving critically acclaimed concerts in London in the 1890s. The composer of \"Faust\", Charles Gounod, wrote Valentine's aria \"Even bravest heart\" for him at his request for the London production in 1864 so that the leading baritone would have an aria. A couple of primitive cylinder recordings dating from about 1900 have been attributed by collectors to the dominant French baritone of the 1860s and 1870s, Jean-Baptiste Faure (1830–1914), the creator of Posa in Verdi's original French-language version of \"Don Carlos\". It is doubtful, however, that Faure (who retired in 1886) made the cylinders. However, a contemporary of Faure's, Antonio Cotogni, (1831–1918)—probably the foremost Italian baritone of his generation—can be heard, briefly and dimly, at the age of 77, on a duet recording with the tenor Francesco Marconi. (Cotogni and Marconi had sung together in the first London performance of Amilcare Ponchielli's \"La Gioconda\" in 1883, performing the roles of Barnaba and Enzo respectively.)\n\nThere are 19th-century references in the musical literature to certain baritone subtypes. These include the light and tenorish baryton-Martin, named after French singer Jean-Blaise Martin (1768/69–1837), and the deeper, more powerful \"Heldenbariton\" (today's bass-baritone) of Wagnerian opera.\n\nPerhaps the most accomplished \"Heldenbaritons\" of Wagner's day were August Kindermann, Franz Betz and Theodor Reichmann. Betz created Hans Sachs in \"Die Meistersinger \"and undertook Wotan in the first \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" cycle at Bayreuth, while Reichmann created Amfortas in \"Parsifal\", also at Bayreuth. Lyric German baritones sang lighter Wagnerian roles such as Wolfram in \"Tannhäuser\", Kurwenal in \"Tristan und Isolde \"or Telramund in \"Lohengrin\". They made large strides, too, in the performance of art song and oratorio, with Franz Schubert favouring several baritones for his vocal music, in particular Johann Michael Vogl.\n\nNineteenth-century operettas became the preserve of lightweight baritone voices. They were given comic parts in the tradition of the previous century's comic bass by Gilbert and Sullivan in many of their productions. This did not prevent the French master of operetta, Jacques Offenbach, from assigning the villain's role in \"The Tales of Hoffmann \"to a big-voiced baritone for the sake of dramatic effect. Other 19th-century French composers like Meyerbeer, Hector Berlioz, Camille Saint-Saëns, Georges Bizet and Jules Massenet wrote attractive parts for baritones, too. These included Nelusko in \"L'Africaine\" (Meyerbeer's last opera), Mephistopheles in \"La damnation de Faust \"(a role also sung by basses), the Priest of Dagon in \"Samson and Delilah\", Escamillo in \"Carmen\", Zurga in \"Les pêcheurs de perles\", Lescaut in \"Manon\", Athanael in \"Thaïs \"and Herod in \"Hérodiade\". Russian composers included substantial baritone parts in their operas. Witness the title roles in Peter Tchaikovsky's \"Eugene Onegin \"(which received its first production in 1879) and Alexander Borodin's \"Prince Igor \"(1890).\n\nMozart continued to be sung throughout the 19th century although, generally speaking, his operas were not revered to the same extent that they are today by music critics and audiences. Back then, baritones rather than high basses normally sang Don Giovanni – arguably Mozart's greatest male operatic creation. Famous Dons of the late 19th and early 20th centuries included Scotti and Maurel, as well as Portugal's Francisco De Andrade and Sweden's John Forsell.\n\nThe dawn of the 20th century opened up more opportunities for baritones than ever before as a taste for strenuously exciting vocalism and lurid, \"slice-of-life\" operatic plots took hold in Italy and spread elsewhere. The most prominent verismo baritones included such major singers in Europe and America as the polished Giuseppe De Luca (the first Sharpless in \"Madama Butterfly\"), Mario Sammarco (the first Gerard in \"Andrea Chénier\"), Eugenio Giraldoni (the first Scarpia in \"Tosca\"), Pasquale Amato (the first Rance in \"La fanciulla del West\"), Riccardo Stracciari (noted for his richly attractive timbre) and Domenico Viglione Borghese, whose voice was exceeded in size only by that of the lion-voiced Titta Ruffo. Ruffo was the most commanding Italian baritone of his era or, arguably, any other era. He was at his prime from the early 1900s to the early 1920s and enjoyed success in Italy, England and America (in Chicago and later at the Met).\n\nBetween them, these baritones established the \"echt\" performance style for baritones undertaking roles in verismo operas. The chief verismo composers were Giacomo Puccini, Ruggero Leoncavallo, Pietro Mascagni, Alberto Franchetti, Umberto Giordano and Francesco Cilea. Verdi's works continued to remain popular, however, with audiences in Italy, the Spanish-speaking countries, the United States and the United Kingdom, and in Germany, where there was a major Verdi revival in Berlin between the wars.\n\nOutside the field of Italian opera, an important addition to the Austro-German repertory occurred in 1905. This was the premiere of Richard Strauss's \"Salome\", with the pivotal part of John the Baptist assigned to a baritone. (The enormous-voiced Dutch baritone Anton van Rooy, a Wagner specialist, sang John when the opera reached the Met in 1907). Then, in 1925, Germany's Leo Schützendorf created the title baritone role in Alban Berg's harrowing \"Wozzeck\". In a separate development, the French composer Claude Debussy's post-Wagnerian masterpiece \"Pelléas et Mélisande\" featured not one but two lead baritones at its 1902 premiere. These two baritones, Jean Périer and Hector Dufranne, possessed contrasting voices. (Dufranne – sometimes classed as a bass-baritone – had a darker, more powerful instrument than did Périer, who was a true baryton-Martin.)\n\nCharacteristic of the Wagnerian baritones of the 20th century was a general progression of individual singers from higher-lying baritone parts to lower-pitched ones. This was the case with Germany's Hans Hotter. Hotter made his debut in 1929. As a young singer he appeared in Verdi and created the Commandant in Richard Strauss's \"Friedenstag \"and Olivier in \"Capriccio\". By the 1950s, however, he was being hailed as the top Wagnerian bass-baritone in the world. His Wotan was especially praised by critics for its musicianship. Other major Wagnerian baritones have included Hotter's predecessors Leopold Demuth, Anton van Rooy, Hermann Weil, Clarence Whitehill, Friedrich Schorr, Rudolf Bockelmann and Hans Hermann Nissen. Demuth, van Rooy, Weil and Whitehill were at their peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries while Schorr, Bockelmann and Nissen were stars of the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nIn addition to their heavyweight Wagnerian cousins, there was a plethora of baritones with more lyrical voices active in Germany and Austria during the period between the outbreak of WW1 in 1914 and the end of WW2 in 1945. Among them were , Heinrich Schlusnus, Herbert Janssen, Willi Domgraf-Fassbaender, Karl Schmitt-Walter and Gerhard Hüsch. Their abundant inter-war Italian counterparts included, among others, Carlo Galeffi, Giuseppe Danise, Enrico Molinari, Umberto Urbano, Cesare Formichi, Luigi Montesanto, Apollo Granforte, Benvenuto Franci, Renato Zanelli (who switched to tenor roles in 1924), Mario Basiola, Giovanni Inghilleri, Carlo Morelli (the Chilean-born younger brother of Renato Zanelli) and Carlo Tagliabue, who retired as late as 1958.\n\nOne of the best known Italian Verdi baritones of the 1920s and 1930s, Mariano Stabile, sang Iago and Rigoletto and Falstaff (at La Scala) under the baton of Arturo Toscanini. Stabile also appeared in London, Chicago and Salzburg. He was noted more for his histrionic skills than for his voice, however. Stabile was followed by Tito Gobbi, a versatile singing actor capable of vivid comic and tragic performances during the years of his prime in the 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s. He learned more than 100 roles in his lifetime and was mostly known for his roles in Verdi and Puccini operas, including appearances as Scarpia opposite soprano Maria Callas as Tosca at Covent Garden.\n\nGobbi's competitors included Gino Bechi, Giuseppe Valdengo, Paolo Silveri, Giuseppe Taddei, Ettore Bastianini, Cesare Bardelli and Giangiacomo Guelfi. Another of Gobbi's contemporaries was the Welshman Geraint Evans, who famously sang Falstaff at Glyndebourne and created the roles of Mr. Flint and Mountjoy in works by Benjamin Britten. Some considered his best role to have been Wozzeck. The next significant Welsh baritone was Bryn Terfel. He made his premiere at Glyndebourne in 1990 and went on to build an international career as Falstaff and, more generally, in the operas of Mozart and Wagner.\n\nThe first famous American baritone appeared in the 1900s. It was the American-born but Paris-based Charles W. Clark who sang Italian, French and German composers. An outstanding group of virile-voiced American baritones appeared then in the 1920s. The younger members of this group were still active as recently as the late 1970s. Outstanding among its members were the Met-based Verdians Lawrence Tibbett (a compelling, rich-voiced singing actor), Richard Bonelli, John Charles Thomas, Robert Weede, Leonard Warren and Robert Merrill. They sang French opera, too, as did the American-born but also Paris-based baritone of the 1920s, and 1930s Arthur Endreze.\n\nAlso to be found singing Verdi roles at the Met, Covent Garden and the Vienna Opera during the late 1930s and the 1940s was the big-voiced Hungarian baritone, Sandor (Alexander) Sved.\n\nThe leading Verdi baritones of the 1970s and 1980s were probably Italy's Renato Bruson and Piero Cappuccilli, America's Sherrill Milnes, Sweden's Ingvar Wixell and the Romanian baritone Nicolae Herlea. At the same time, Britain's Sir Thomas Allen was considered to be the most versatile baritone of his generation in regards to repertoire, which ranged from Mozart to Verdi and lighter Wagner roles, through French and Russian opera, to modern English music. Another British baritone, Norman Bailey, established himself internationally as a memorable Wotan and Hans Sachs. He had, however, a distinguished if lighter-voiced Wagnerian rival during the 1960s and 1970s in the person of Thomas Stewart of America. Other notable post-War Wagnerian baritones have been Canada's George London, Germany's Hermann Uhde and, more recently, America's James Morris.\n\nAmong the late-20th-century baritones noted throughout the opera world for their Verdi performances was Vladimir Chernov, who emerged from the former USSR to sing at the Met. Chernov followed in the footsteps of such richly endowed East European baritones as Ippolit Pryanishnikov (a favorite of Tchaikovski's), Joachim Tartakov (an Everardi pupil), Oskar Kamionsky (an exceptional \"bel canto\" singer nicknamed the \"Russian Battistini\"), Waclaw Brzezinski (known as the \"Polish Battistini\"), Georges Baklanoff (a powerful singing actor), and, during a career lasting from 1935 to 1966, the Bolshoi's Pavel Lisitsian. Dmitri Hvorostovsky and Sergei Leiferkus are two Russian baritones of the modern era who appear regularly in the West. Like Lisitsian, they sing Verdi and the works of their native composers, including Tchaikovsky's \"Eugene Onegin\" and \"The Queen of Spades\".\n\nIn the realm of French song, the bass-baritone José van Dam and the lighter-voiced Gérard Souzay have been notable. Souzay's repertoire extended from the Baroque works of Jean-Baptiste Lully to 20th-century composers such as Francis Poulenc. Pierre Bernac, Souzay's teacher, was an interpreter of Poulenc's songs in the previous generation. Older baritones identified with this style include France's Dinh Gilly and Charles Panzéra and Australia's John Brownlee. Another Australian, Peter Dawson, made a small but precious legacy of benchmark Handel recordings during the 1920s and 1930s. (Dawson, incidentally, acquired his outstanding Handelian technique from Sir Charles Santley.) Yet another Australian baritone of distinction between the wars was Harold Williams, who was based in the United Kingdom. Important British-born baritones of the 1930s and 1940s were Dennis Noble, who sang Italian and English operatic roles, and the Mozartian Roy Henderson. Both appeared often at Covent Garden.\n\nPrior to World War II, Germany's Heinrich Schlusnus, Gerhard Hüsch and Herbert Janssen were celebrated for their beautifully sung lieder recitals as well as for their mellifluous operatic performances in Verdi, Mozart, and Wagner respectively. After the war's conclusion, Hermann Prey and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau appeared on the scene to take their place. In addition to his interpretations of lieder and the works of Mozart, Prey sang in Strauss operas and tackled lighter Wagner roles such as Wolfram or Beckmesser. Fischer-Dieskau sang parts in 'fringe' operas by the likes of Ferruccio Busoni and Paul Hindemith as well as appearing in standard works by Verdi and Wagner. He earned his principal renown, however, as a lieder singer. Talented German and Austrian lieder singers of a younger generation include Olaf Bär, Matthias Goerne, Wolfgang Holzmair (who also performs regularly in opera), Thomas Quasthoff, and Christian Gerhaher. Well-known non-Germanic baritones of recent times have included the Italians Giorgio Zancanaro and Leo Nucci, the Frenchman François le Roux, the Canadians Gerald Finley and James Westman and the versatile American Thomas Hampson, his compatriot Nathan Gunn and the Englishman Simon Keenlyside.\n\nThe vocal range of the baritone lies between the bass and the tenor voice types. The baritone vocal range is usually between the second A below middle C (A) and the A above middle C (A).\n\nWithin the baritone voice type category are seven generally recognized subcategories: baryton-Martin baritone (light baritone), lyric baritone, \"Kavalierbariton\", Verdi baritone, dramatic baritone, \"baryton-noble\" baritone, and the bass-baritone.\n\nThe baryton-Martin baritone (sometimes referred to as light baritone) lacks the lower G–B range a heavier baritone is capable of, and has a lighter, almost tenor-like quality. Its common range is from C to the B above middle C (C to B). Generally seen only in French repertoire, this \"Fach\" was named after the French singer Jean-Blaise Martin. Associated with the rise of the baritone in the 19th century, Martin was well known for his fondness for falsetto singing, and the designation 'baryton Martin' has been used (Faure, 1886) to separate his voice from the 'Verdi Baritone', which carried the chest register further into the upper range. It is important to note that this voice type shares the \"primo passaggio\" and \"secondo passaggio\" with the Dramatic Tenor and Heldentenor (C and F respectively), and hence could be trained as a tenor.\n\nBaryton-Martin roles in opera:\n\nThe lyric baritone is a sweeter, milder sounding baritone voice, lacking in harshness; lighter and perhaps mellower than the dramatic baritone with a higher tessitura. Its common range is from the A below C to the G above middle C (A to G). It is typically assigned to comic roles.\n\nLyric baritone roles in opera:\n\nThe \"Kavalierbariton\" baritone is a metallic voice that can sing both lyric and dramatic phrases, a manly, noble baritonal color. Its common range is from the A below low C to the G above middle C (A to G). Not quite as powerful as the Verdi baritone who is expected to have a powerful appearance on stage, perhaps muscular or physically large.\n\n\"Kavalierbariton\" roles in opera:\n\nThe Verdi baritone is a more specialized voice category and a subset of the Dramatic Baritone. Its common range is from the G below low C to the B above middle C (G to B). A Verdi baritone refers to a voice capable of singing consistently and with ease in the highest part of the baritone range. It will generally have a lot of squillo, or \"ping\".\n\nVerdi baritone roles in opera:\n\nThe dramatic baritone is voice that is richer, fuller, and sometimes harsher than a lyric baritone and with a darker quality. Its common range is from the G half an octave below low C to the G above middle C (G to G). The dramatic baritone category corresponds roughly to the Heldenbariton in the German \"Fach\" system except that some Verdi baritone roles are not included. The primo passaggio and secondo passaggio of both the Verdi and dramatic baritone are at B and E respectively, hence the differentiation is based more heavily on timbre and tessitura. Accordingly, roles that fall into this category tend to have a slightly lower tessitura than typical Verdi baritone roles, only rising above an F at the moments of greatest intensity. Many of the Puccini roles fall into this category. However, it is important to note, that for all intents and purposes, a Verdi Baritone is simply a Dramatic Baritone with greater ease in the upper tessitura (Verdi Baritone roles center approximately a minor third higher). Because the Verdi Baritone is sometimes seen as subset of the Dramatic Baritone, some singers perform roles from both sets of repertoire. Similarly, the lower tessitura of these roles allow them frequently to be sung by bass-baritones.\n\nDramatic baritone roles in opera:\n\nThe \"baryton-noble\" baritone is French for \"noble baritone\" and describes a part that requires a noble bearing, smooth vocalisation and forceful declamation, all in perfect balance. This category originated in the Paris Opera, but it greatly influenced Verdi (Don Carlo in \"Ernani \"and \"La forza del destino\"; Count Luna in \"Il trovatore\"; \"Simon Boccanegra\") and Wagner as well (\"Wotan\"; \"Amfortas\"). Similar to the Kavalierbariton.\n\n\"Baryton-noble\" roles in opera are:\n\nBass-baritones are typically divided into two separate categories: lyric bass-baritone and dramatic bass-baritone.\n\nThe lyric bass-baritone is a higher bass-baritone. Its common range is from about the F below low C to the F above middle C (F to F). Some bass-baritones are baritones, like Friedrich Schorr, George London, James Morris and Bryn Terfel. The following are more often performed by lower baritones as opposed to high basses.\n\nLyric bass-baritone roles in opera:\n\nThe dramatic bass-baritone is a lower baritone (a \"heldenbaritone\"). Its common range is from about the F below low C to the F above middle C (F to F).\n\nDramatic bass-baritone roles in opera:\n\nAll of Gilbert and Sullivan's Savoy operas have at least one lead baritone character (frequently the comic principal). Notable operetta roles are:\n\nIn barbershop music, the baritone part sings in a similar range to the Lead (singing the melody) however usually singing lower than the lead. A barbershop baritone has a specific and specialized role in the formation of the four-part harmony that characterizes the style.\n\nThe baritone singer is often the one required to support or \"fill\" the bass sound (typically by singing the fifth above the bass root) and to complete a chord. On the other hand, the baritone will occasionally find himself harmonizing above the melody, which calls for a tenor-like quality. Because the baritone fills the chord, the part is often not very melodic.\n\nIn bluegrass music, the melody line is called the lead. Tenor is sung an interval of a third above the lead. Baritone is the fifth of the scale that has the lead as a tonic, and may be sung below the lead, or even above the lead (and the tenor), in which case it is called \"high baritone\". Conversely, the more \"soul\" baritones have the more traditional timbre, but sing in a vocal range that is closer to the tenor vocal range. Some of these singers include Tom Jones Michael McDonald, and Levi Stubbs of the Four Tops.\n\n\n\n"}

The game was released on October 30, 2007. Beenox developed the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, and Windows versions of the game, Smart Bomb Interactive developed the Wii version, and Vicarious Visions developed the Nintendo DS version.\nAs Barry B. Benson, players take on an adventure to save the bees' production of honey through New York City. Players get to experience Barry's life within the hive and navigate their way around the world from the feature film using many techniques. Players can drive through the city using racecars, scooters, taxicabs, and trucks. Players can \"fly\" Barry at high speed through the sky. Using the Pollinator, players can \"Blast\" through obstacles or they can \"Buzz\" to cause a chain reaction. Players get to \"Stop Time\" by using Barry's bee reflexes. The video game features 2-person multiplayer mini games.\n\nThe video game \"Shrek the Third\" includes a demo which has Barry chase a truck. The name \"Honey Farms\" is omitted in this demo.\n\nJerry Seinfeld, John Goodman, Patrick Warburton, and Tress MacNeille reprise their voices from the movie in this game.\n\nA honey bee named Barry B. Benson stars on a new show known as \"New Hive Tonight\". On the show, Barry talks about how he changed the lives of honey bees and humans, bringing them together.\nOn his graduation day from BU university (which is the only university in the entire hive, and also maybe a spoof of Boston University, having the same abbreviation), Barry and his best friend Adam Flayman head to a honey factory called \"Honex\", where they are to work for the rest of their lives. Adam enjoys working, but Barry does not, thinking that everything they do in Honex is making honey, and longs to do something else in the remaining stage of his life. The game focuses on Barry's various job skills which are not in the movie such as car racing, Taxi, playing video arcade games, delivering food to owners, car fixing and doing Honex jobs while not in a mission.\n\nBarry decides that he wants to go to the outside and joins the Pollen Jocks, a group of bees who go to the \"outside\" to collect nectar from flowers and bring them back. A Pollen Jock manages to train Barry so he would be a Pollen Jock such as how to make flowers bloom, and getting Nectar from them. He also teaches him to kill other non-bee insects such as hornets, wasps, and dragonflies. However, while Barry is resting, it starts to rain, but he manages to find cover in the apartment of a couple: Vanessa and Ken. Ken tries to smash Barry, but Vanessa allows him to escape. Barry soon discovers that the humans \"steal\" their honey regularly, so he goes to get the honey back. After chasing a truck delivering honey, he finds himself in a honey farm, where he takes pictures of it to prove to the rest of the bees that the humans are \"stealing\" their honey. However, a squad of wasps arrive at the apiary to take away the bees and kill Barry but he manages to fend them off and rout them, foiling their plans. Then, Freddy the head Beekeeper manages to smoke all the bees but Barry and the other bees defeat the Beekeeper which he bumps his head on the tree.\n\nBarry and Adam chase after the car of a main defense lawyer named Layton T Montgomery, and secretly listen to a conversation between him and his associate about the human-stealing-honey case while they are in a restaurant called La Couchon. He sneaks into Montgomery's house along with Vanessa and Barry disguises himself as a fly in a Tron-like suit to gain access to a safe which holds papers explaining Montgomery's plan, but it is revealed to be a trick and he is attacked by a group of hornets, but he manages to defeat them.\n\nThe game received \"mixed or average reviews\" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\nGameZone said that the PC version \"will certainly have some charm for younger players, but there are a few challenges to overcome while playing it. Even a 13-year old was surprised and confused when the game changed control options, moving from WASD and arrow keys to numbers, during one section.\"\n\n\n\nAma\n"}

It is an update of the formula and soundtrack of the original \"Blaster Master\" game, also produced by Sunsoft, in 1988.\n\nThe game's plot is based on an Earth that has become infected with a virus that has caused animals to be transformed into monsters that threaten humanity. Alex, a world-leading biologist, takes the fight to the mutations to find the source of the virus, using an armored vehicle called S.O.P.H.I.A. to battle against the creatures.\n\nThe gameplay reuses much of the same concepts of the original \"Blaster Master\" title. In side-scrolling sections, the players controls S.O.P.H.I.A. to progress through terrain spaces, gaining power-ups needed to face tougher monsters and progress to new areas. At times, the player can have Alex leave S.O.P.H.I.A. and enter smaller caves, at which point the perspective is turned to a top-down run-and-gun game, where the player controls Alex directly, using weapons and gaining upgrades to explore the caves and defeat boss characters.\n\nIn December 2009, Sunsoft announced that they wanted to rebuild the Sunsoft brand in North America, and teamed with United States publisher Gaijinworks to bring the original \"Blaster Master\" as a Virtual Console title for the Wii on December 14, 2009. At the time, Vic Ireland, owner of Gaijinworks, stated that: \n\"Blaster Master: Overdrive\" was announced on February 6, 2010, only 2 days before its North America release on WiiWare. On release, the game was criticized only to support one controller configuration (using the Wii Remote in a horizontal alignment in the same manner as the original Nintendo Entertainment System controllers; Ireland stated that he was working with Sunsoft to help implement a patch to include alternative control schemes, including through use of the Classic Controller.\n\n\"Blaster Master: Overdrive\" received \"mixed\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\nCritics praised the title as a modern upgrade to a classic Nintendo Entertainment System game, but identified faults with its controls and lack of progressive scan support that limited the graphics quality. John Meyer of \"Wired\" identified the game as the \"most faithful to the original\" of the other attempts to recapture the \"Blaster Master\" gameplay, improving on the original game by adding a map screen and tweaking the gameplay in the top-down sections, but noted the default, uncustomized controls, placing the strafing action button on the backside of the remote would lead to hand cramping. Bob Mackey of 1UP.com noted the game, while still remaining challenging, \"manages to iron out a few unforgivable aspects\" of the original \"Blaster Master\", but also lamented that the improved gameplay in the top-down sections suffered from the choice of controls.\n"}

The aim of the Act was to liberalise and deregulate the British broadcasting industry by promoting competition; ITV, in particular, had earlier been described by Margaret Thatcher as \"the last bastion of restrictive practices\". The act came about after the finding from the Peacock Committee.\n\nIt led directly to the abolition of the Independent Broadcasting Authority and its replacement with the Independent Television Commission and Radio Authority (both themselves now replaced by Ofcom), which were given the remit of regulating with a \"lighter touch\" and did not have such strong powers as the IBA; some referred to this as \"deregulation\". The ITC also began regulating non-terrestrial channels, whereas the IBA had only regulated ITV, Channel 4 and British Satellite Broadcasting; the ITC thus took over the responsibilities of the Cable Authority which had regulated the early non-terrestrial channels, which were only available to a very small audience in the 1980s.\n\nAn effect of this Act was that, in the letter of the law, the television or radio companies rather than the regulator became the broadcasters, as had been the case in the early (1955–1964) era of the Independent Television Authority when it had fewer regulatory powers than it would later assume.\n\nIn television, the Act allowed for the creation of a fifth analogue terrestrial television channel in the UK, which turned out to be Channel 5, and the growth of multichannel satellite television. It also stipulated that the BBC, which had previously produced the vast majority of its television programming in-house, was now obliged to source at least 25% of its output from independent production companies.\n\nThe act has sometimes been described, both as praise and as criticism, as a key enabling force for Rupert Murdoch's ambitions in Britain. It reformed the system of awarding ITV franchises, which proved controversial when Thames Television was replaced by Carlton Television, for what some felt were political reasons (see \"Death on the Rock\"), and when TV-am, admired by Mrs Thatcher for its management's defiance of the trade unions, lost its franchise to GMTV (the now-former Prime Minister personally apologised to the senior TV-am executive Bruce Gyngell). It also allowed companies holding ITV franchises to merge with each other starting in 1994, beginning the process which eventually led to all franchises in England and Wales coming under the control of ITV plc in 2004.\n\nIn radio, it allowed for the launch of three Independent National Radio stations, two of them on medium wave using frequencies formerly used by the BBC, and the other on FM using frequencies formerly used by the emergency services. It set out plans for many more local and regional commercial radio stations, generally using parts of the FM band not previously used for broadcasting, which have since come to fruition. Its plans for expanding community radio were only really developed in the 2000s.\n\nThe Act passed through Parliament despite opposition from much of the Labour Party and from some members of the ruling Conservative Party, who saw it as representative of a decline in standards, and on occasions saw it as enabling what was, for them, an unwelcome Americanisation. Notably, Douglas Hurd has since criticised the Act's after-effects, describing it as \"one of the less successful reforms of those years\". These Conservatives would have described their position as paternalistic as a term of praise, while supporters of the Act would use it against them as a term of abuse. During Tony Blair's tenure as leader, the Labour Party's broadcasting policy generally shifted much more towards that expounded in the Act.\n\nThe then Home Secretary, David Waddington, described the Act as heralding \"a massive expansion in choice\", and supporters of the multichannel age in British broadcasting have praised the Act, and later regulation influenced by it, for such reasons. Supporters of the previous, more regulated system have strongly criticised the Act, and some have blamed it for what they see as a \"dumbing down\" of British television and radio. Like many other reforms of the Thatcher years, it has a tendency to polarise opinion very strongly. One initially less-obvious effect of the Act was that technical standards ceased to be monitored & enforced by the regulatory body along with the programme content.\n\n\n"}

It was released on Steam Early Access on March 17, 2017 for Microsoft Windows with additional platforms slated for Q3 2017 including PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.\n\nThe game features melee and ranged combat, inventory management, player-driven dialogues and weapon customization that is made possible through item crafting.\n\nThe plot focuses on Buck, a motorcycle garage mechanic who decides to leave everything he knows behind in order to find the truth behind a girl's disappearance.\n\n\"Buck\" had a successful Kickstarter campaign which raised just above the goal of $30,000.\n\n\"Buck\" is a single-player side-scrolling brawler where the player controls Buck, a lonely garage mechanic who knows how to fight and build weapons. The game currently features three weapons: a sawed-off shotgun, heavy melee exhaust pipe and a pair of custom-made revolvers. Each weapon has a specific function to counter different enemy types throughout the game. Each weapon can be upgraded in four different ways and it's up to the player to decide which weapon to upgrade and in what order.\n\nBuck has basic melee attacks that can be combined with any of his equipped weapons, resulting in a multiple solution approach to every combat encounter. Buck can dodge enemy attacks to gain a short but crucial invulnerability window to escape or re-position. Attacking and Dodging costs stamina which is a finite resource with a short recovery cooldown.\n\nBuck will also need to engage with characters in the world where fully voiced dialogues are included. The player will need to choose Buck's answers and determine his personality. These dialogues occur in the game's 'safe-zones' or town hubs; the first of which is Westown.\n\nSafe zones like Westown is where the player goes to unlock new missions and move the plot forward. Mission levels are designed with branching paths, random enemy spawns, hidden loot caches and percentage-based loot drops from enemies to encourage returning to previously explored areas.\n\nLevels have light platforming elements where the player can use Zip-lines, elevators, slides, ladders and platforms to get across the level.\n\nBuck's HUD includes his Health, Stamina and ammunition count. He has access to his Inventory, fast-travel map and journal as well.\n\nItem management plays a key-role in the game since Buck can only carry up to 10 items. Most items can stack up to 4 before taking an additional slot but crafting recipes require at least three different materials. The player can't take all the item he finds, some will have to be dropped in favor of crafting other components.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Note that some gameplay elements might be subject to change until \"Buck\" finishes his development on Steam Early Access.\n\nThe story of \"Buck\" will unfold as Early Access development continues.\n\nThe game follows the character of Buck from the moment he decides to leave the comfort of his home to venture out into the unforgiving wasteland. Ignoring his step-dad's advice, he leaves his home to try to find out what happened Jodie, a female that spent some time with Buck at his garage/home.\n\nThe story is told through the narration of Buck's step-father, Grit. An old and gravely voiced Vulture.\n\nDevelopment on \"Buck\" began on February 2013. However the concept art, characters, plot and initial art-assets were made in 2002. The game's director, Gal, was 12 years old when he decided to make a game about his dog. His older brother, Adi Katz, who does all the art for the game, has helped him design the characters and the world they inhabit. The plot, style and tone of the game has changed dramatically over the years.\n\nThe plot and tone of the game has undergone many iterations. Gal said that once the real Buck had passed away, the story became much grimmer and darker. Today, he describes the game as a sort of \"Metroidlike, Apocalpytic-Noir brawler\".\n\nGal cited multiple sources of his inspiration, including Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Sin City, Waterworld, The Blues Brothers and most notably the anime Series Trigun.\n\nThe team still uses the sole proprietor name \"Wave Interactive\" but has since opened a company called Rainfall Entertainment which is based in the UK.\n\nThe game and its kickstarter campaign were noticed by the gaming press.,\n"}

The buttered cat paradox, submitted by artist John Frazee of Kingston, New York, won a 1993 \"OMNI\" magazine competition about paradoxes. The basic premise, stating the conditions of the cat and bread and posed as a question, was presented in a routine by comic and juggler Michael Davis, appearing on \"The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson\", July 22, 1988.\n\nSome people jokingly maintain that the experiment will produce an anti-gravity effect. They propose that as the cat falls towards the ground, it will slow down and start to rotate, eventually reaching a steady state of hovering a short distance from the ground while rotating at high speed as both the buttered side of the toast and the cat’s feet attempt to land on the ground.\nIn June 2003, Kimberly Miner won a Student Academy Award for her film \"Perpetual Motion\". Miner based her film on a paper written by a high-school friend that explored the potential implications of the cat and buttered toast idea.\n\nThe faux paradox has captured the imagination of science-oriented humorists. In May 1992, the Usenet Oracle Digest #441 included a question from a supplicant asking about the paradox. Testing the theory is the main theme in an episode of the comic book strip \"Jack B. Quick\", the title character seeks to test this theory, leading to the cat hovering above the ground, with the cat's wagging tail providing propulsion. The March 31, 2005, strip of the webcomic \"Bunny\" also explored the idea in the guise of a plan for a \"Perpetual Motion MoggieToast 5k Power Generator\", based on Sod's law. In \"Science Askew\", Donald E. Simanek comments on this phenomenon.\n\nThe idea appeared on the British panel game \"QI\", where the idea was discussed. As well as talking about the idea, they also brought up other questions regarding the paradox. These included:\n\nThe paradox also appeared in the episode \"Gravitational Anarchy\" of the scientific podcast \"Radiolab\". Later, a humoristic explainer animation was put together by the animated production company Barq, based on an extracted audio clip from the \"Radiolab\" episode.\n\nBrazilian energy drink brand Flying Horse has released an award-winning commercial that simulates the recreation of this phenomenon, which is then used to create perpetual energy.\n\nIt also appeared in a comics series called \"Kid Paddle\" where Kid tells the story to his gullible friend Horace while at the dinner table. The comic is fairly popular in France and Belgium.\n\nIn reality, cats possess the ability to turn themselves right side up in mid-air if they should fall upside-down, known as the cat righting reflex. This enables them to land on their feet if dropped from sufficient height, about .\n\nToast, being an inanimate object, lacks both the ability and the desire to right itself. A study at Manchester Metropolitan University involving dropping 100 slices under laboratory conditions established that toast typically lands on the floor butter-side-down as a result of the manner in which it is typically dropped from a table, and the aerodynamic drag caused by the air pockets within the bread. The toast is typically butter-side-up when dropped. As it falls, it rotates; given the typical speed of rotation and the typical height of a table, a slice of toast that began butter-side-up on the table will land butter-side-down on the floor in 81% of cases.\n\n\n"}

During World War II, he served in the United States Marine Corps in the South Pacific. He later moved to Hollywood to continue a career in show business.\n\nArnold appeared in films as an actor opposite the comic duo Martin and Lewis, and also wrote the screenplay for the Martin and Lewis vehicle \"The Caddy\" (1953). In 1956, Arnold started writing for such television series as \"The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show\" and \"The Rosemary Clooney Show\". In the 1960s, he began writing and producing episodes for such sitcoms as \"The Real McCoys,\" \"Bewitched\", and \"That Girl.\" Regarding \"Bewitched\", which he produced for its first season, Arnold noted, \"With this show, I saw a great opportunity to accomplish something. Fantasy can always be a jumping-off place for more sophisticated work.\"\n\nThough his subsequent work was popular with audiences, Arnold frequently butted heads with TV executives regarding issues of content and fair shooting schedules. Television sitcom writer-director Ken Levine described Arnold as \"brilliant, unpredictable (a nice term for bi-polar), demanding, and kind.\" Tapings on \"Barney Miller\" became legendary for lasting into the wee hours as Arnold worked on rewrites; due to these extended tapings the show in its later seasons ceased having a live audience. While working on \"Barney Miller\", Arnold became so sick of the constant network battles that he founded his own distribution company Pro-Synd, Inc., so he could syndicate shows as he wished, but with the cancellation of his subsequent series \"Joe Bash\" and \"Stat\", his plans for \"Barney Miller\" never came to fruition. He eventually sued regarding what he felt was the unfair sharing of the profits from \"Barney Miller\" and got a $50 million settlement.\n\nOn August 28, 1986, Danny Arnold sold his production company Four D Productions, Inc. to Coca-Cola's Columbia Pictures Television Group for $50 million after Arnold dropped the federal and state lawsuits against Columbia Pictures Industries accusing them of antitrust violations, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty.\n\nArnold won two Emmy Awards, one for \"My World and Welcome to It\" and one for the series for which he is most famous, \"Barney Miller\". This latter show also won Arnold a Peabody Award. He was honored with the Paddy Chayefsky Award in 1985 by the Writer's Guild of America to celebrate his lifetime of achievement.\n\n\nArnold was married twice and had two children. His first marriage was to the daughter of songwriter Ray Gilbert, actress Joanne Gilbert, in 1955. The marriage ended the following year.\n\nArnold met his second wife, Donna, while he was working as a writer on \"The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show\" and she was appearing as a singer and dancer on the program. They married in 1961 and had two children, David and Dannel. The couple remained married until Arnold's death.\n\nOn August 19, 1995, Arnold died of heart failure at his Los Angeles home at the age of 70. He is buried at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.\n\n"}

{"id": "5711479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5711479", "title": "Film memorabilia", "text": "Film memorabilia\n\nFilm memorabilia are objects considered of value because of their connection to the cinema. These include costumes, props, advertising posters, and scripts, among other things. Fans have always coveted memorabilia, but in recent years, what was once a hobby has mushroomed into big business, with millions of dollars changing hands in auctions held by such top firms as Christie's and Sotheby's. In addition, many popular films have their collectible items sold via independent, online movie memorabilia stores, web auctions, and at film studio charity events.\n\nIn the early days, most people sought autographs or original photographs or posters. Collectors had to rely on a handful of news magazines that were full of various sellers offering mail order catalogues or asking to buy bulk lots, or particular items of interest. Occasionally, events would be organized which were structured around a live auction — these, while fewer in number today, still occur, and one can still buy memorabilia in person from trusted sellers on-site. The community was also fairly fragmented, with collectors and dealers spread out across the globe and no real consistent and reliable way to communicate with one another.\n\nMovie studios were slow to recognize the value of their property, \"generally viewing the material as junk taking up precious backlot real estate.\" Often, workers would just take souvenirs or sell items without permission, aware that their employers did not particularly care. One of the more notorious of these was costumer Kent Warner, who amassed a large private collection and made money selling to interested buyers. One of his friends claimed that Warner rescued Humphrey Bogart's \"Casablanca\" trench coat, which had been slated for burning.\n\nThe turning point came in 1970. Kirk Kerkorian had bought MGM the year before and installed James Thomas Aubrey, Jr. as president. As part of his cost-cutting measures, Aubrey decided to auction off hundreds of thousands of items. The success of this mammoth event made people take notice.\n\nMGM sold the contents of seven sound stages \"for a mere $1.5 million\" to auctioneer David Weisz. There were over 350,000 costumes alone. Weisz hired Kent Warner to help catalog and prepare for the auction. In the course of his work, Warner found several pairs of the ruby slippers from \"The Wizard of Oz\" (it is common practice to make multiple copies of important props). One pair became the centerpiece of the event and sold for a then-unheard-of $15,000 (Warner kept or sold an unknown number of other pairs).\n\nActress Debbie Reynolds spent $180,000 and \"purchased thousands of items\", the beginning of her large collection. Weisz \"recouped eight times\" what he paid \"from eager nostalgia enthusiasts.\"\n\nAmong the items sold were:\n\nThe unsold items, \"... truckloads of costume sketches, movie stills and other memorabilia were sent to the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas to be sold in the gift shop and used as hotel decorations.\" The auction catalogs have now themselves become sought-after collectibles.\n\nDebbie Reynolds' collection was sold by Profiles in History in two auctions in June and December 2011. Among the items to be put up for bid in the first of these auctions are:\n\nOn June 18, 2011, the subway dress sold for $4.6 million, far in excess of pre-auction estimates of $1–2 million. Another Monroe dress, worn in \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\", fetched $1.2 million; it had been expected to go for $200,000 to $300,000. Estimated at $60,000 to $80,000, a blue cotton dress Judy Garland used in test shots for \"The Wizard of Oz\" went for $910,000. In total, the auction grossed $22.8 million.\n\nIn the second Reynolds auction, on December 3, 2011, a still-functioning Panavision PSR 35mm camera used to film \"Star Wars\" went for $625,000, breaking records for \"Star Wars\" memorabilia and vintage cameras.\n\nIn the early days of the internet, the larger community began to get in touch with one another through UseNet newsgroups (for example, alt.binaries.pictures.movie-posters). As the internet grew, collectors began communicating in ways never thought possible. In 1995, popular on-line email group MoPo was formed, creating a central place for people to keep in touch about things and events important to the community. This group continues to provide information to new and old collectors alike.\n\nBy 1997, the community had changed forever; eBay was quickly becoming the alternative marketplace after two years of steady growth. Professional sellers took notice, causing many of them to close their bricks-and-mortar businesses and focus their attention completely on internet sites and the future of the on-line marketplace.\n\nIn the early days of internet selling, prices varied widely. One could find posters normally valued in the hundreds of dollars selling for twenty dollars, or, alternatively, find posters normally valued at twenty dollars going for a hundred, or more. Today, the market place for film memorabilia has mostly stabilised. While one can still see a rare film poster go for large amounts, it is far more common to find that items are priced either at or near market value, or are bid up to that point.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "248712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=248712", "title": "Fred Allen", "text": "Fred Allen\n\nJohn Florence Sullivan (May 31, 1894 – March 17, 1956), known professionally as Fred Allen, was an American comedian. His absurdist, topically pointed radio program \"The Fred Allen Show\" (1932–1949) made him one of the most popular and forward-looking humorists in the Golden Age of American radio.\n\nHis best-remembered gag was his long-running mock feud with friend and fellow comedian Jack Benny, but it was only part of his appeal; radio historian John Dunning (in \"On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio\") wrote that Allen was radio's most admired comedian and most frequently censored. A master ad libber, Allen often tangled with his network's executives (and often barbed them on the air over the battles) while developing routines whose style and substance influenced fellow comic talents, including Groucho Marx, Stan Freberg, Henry Morgan and Johnny Carson; his avowed fans also included President Franklin D. Roosevelt and novelists William Faulkner, John Steinbeck and Herman Wouk (who began his career writing for Allen).\n\nAllen was honored with stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for contributions to television and radio.\n\nJohn Florence Sullivan was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Irish Catholic parents. Allen barely knew his mother, Cecilia Herlihy Sullivan, who died of pneumonia when he was not quite three years old. Along with his father, James Henry Sullivan, and his infant brother Robert, Allen was taken in by one of his mother's sisters, \"my aunt Lizzie\", around whom he focused the first chapter of his second memoir, \"Much Ado About Me\". His father was so shattered by his mother's death that, according to Allen, he drank more heavily. His aunt suffered as well; her husband Michael was partially paralyzed by lead poisoning shortly after they married, leaving him mostly unable to work, something Allen remembered as causing contention among Lizzie's sisters. Eventually, Allen's father remarried and offered his sons the choice between coming with him and his new wife or staying with Aunt Lizzie. Allen's younger brother chose to go with their father, but Allen decided to stay with his aunt. \"I never regretted it\", he wrote.\n\nAllen took piano lessons as a boy, his father having brought an Emerson upright along when they moved in with his aunt. He learned exactly two songs – \"Hiawatha\" and \"Pitter, Patter, Little Raindrops\" – and would be asked to play \"half or all my repertoire\" when visitors came to the house. He also worked at the Boston Public Library, where he discovered a book about the origin and development of comedy. Enduring various upheavals at home (other aunts came and went, prompting several moves), Allen also took up juggling while learning as much as possible about comedy.\n\nSome library co-workers planned to put on a show and asked him to do a bit of juggling and some of his comedy. When a girl in the crowd told him, \"You're crazy to keep working here at the library; you ought to go on stage,\" Allen decided his career path was set. \n\nIn 1914, at the age of 20, Allen took a job with a local piano company, in addition to his library work. He appeared at a number of amateur night competitions, soon taking the stage name Fred St. James and booking with the local vaudeville circuit at $30 a week, enough at that time to allow him to quit his jobs with the library and the piano company. Eventually he became \"Freddy James,\" often billing himself as the world's worst juggler. Allen refined the mix of his deliberately clumsy juggling and the standard jokes and one-liners, directing much of the humor at his own poor juggling abilities. During a ten-year world tour, his vaudeville act evolved toward more monologue comedy and less juggling. In 1917, returning to the New York circuit, his stage name was changed to Fred Allen so that he would not be offered the same low salary that theater owners had been accustomed to paying him in his early career. His new surname came from Edgar Allen, a booker for the Fox theaters.\n\nIn 1922, Allen commissioned comic-strip artist Martin Branner to cover a theater curtain with an elaborate mural painting depicting a cemetery with a punchline on each gravestone. This was the \"Old Joke Cemetery\", where overworked gags go to die. In Allen's act, the audiences would see the curtain (and have several minutes to read its 46 punchlines) before Allen made his entrance. Audiences typically would be laughing at the curtain before Allen even appeared. Robert Taylor's biography of Allen includes an impressive full-length photo of Branner's curtain painting, and many of the punchlines are clearly legible in the photo.\n\nAllen used a variety of gimmicks in his changing act, from a ventriloquist dummy to juggling to singing, but the focus was always on his comedy, which was heavy on wordplay. One recurring bit was to read a purported \"letter from home\" with material such as the following:\n\nAllen's wit was at times not intended for the vaudeville audience but rather for other professionals in show business. After one of his appearances failed one day, Allen made the best of it by circulating an obituary of his act on black-bordered funeral stationery. He also mailed vials of his supposed flop sweat to newspapers as part of his comic self-promotion.\n\nIn 1921 Fred Allen and Nora Bayes toured with the company of Lew Fields. Their musical director was a nineteen-year-old Richard Rodgers. Many years later, when he and Oscar Hammerstein II appeared as mystery guests on \"What's My Line?\", Rodgers recalled Allen's act, sitting on the edge of the stage, his legs dangling down, playing a banjo while telling jokes.\n\nAllen gave vaudeville itself a timeline of 1875–1925 in \"Much Ado About Me\", but he actually left vaudeville a few years earlier, moving to work in such Shubert Brothers stage productions as \"The Passing Show\" in 1922. The show played well in its runup to Broadway but lasted only ten weeks at the Winter Garden Theatre. Allen did, however, take something far more lasting from the show: one of the show's chorus girls, Portland Hoffa, who became his wife in 1927 and remained with him until his death.\n\nHe also took good notices for his comic work in several of the productions, particularly \"Vogues\" and \"Greenwich Village Follies\", and continued to develop his comic writing, even writing a column for \"Variety\" called \"Near Fun.\" A salary dispute ended the column; Allen wanted only $60 a week to give up his theater work to become a full-time columnist, but his editor tried a sleight-of-hand based on the paper's ad rates to deny him. He spent his summer in Boston, honed his comic and writing skills even further, worked in a respectfully received duo that billed themselves as Fink and Smith, and played a few of the dying vaudeville houses.\n\nAllen returned to New York to the pleasant surprise that Portland Hoffa was taking instruction to convert to Roman Catholicism. After the couple married, Allen began writing material for them to use together (\"With a vaudeville act, Portland and I could be together, even if we couldn't find any work\"), and the couple divided their time between the show business circuit, Allen's New England family home and Old Orchard Beach, Maine, in summers.\n\nFred Allen's first taste of radio came while he and Portland Hoffa waited for a promised slot in a new Arthur Hammerstein musical. In the interim, they appeared on a Chicago station's program, \"WLS Showboat\", into which Allen recalled, \"Portland and I were presented... to inject a little class into it.\" Their success in these appearances helped their theater reception; live audiences in the Midwest liked to see their radio favorites in person, even if Allen and Hoffa would be replaced by Bob Hope when the radio show moved to New York several months afterward. \n\nThe couple eventually got their Hammerstein show, \"Polly\", which opened in Delaware and made the usual tour before hitting Broadway. Also in that cast was a young Englishman named Archie Leach, who received as many good notices for his romantic appeal as Allen got for his comic work. Hammerstein retooled the show before bringing it to New York, replacing everyone but two women and Allen. Leach decided to buy an old car and drive to Hollywood. \"What Archie Leach didn't tell me,\" Allen remembered, \"was that he was going to change his name to Cary Grant.\"\n\n\"Polly\" never succeeded in spite of several retoolings, but Allen did go on to successful shows like \"The Little Show\" (1929–30) and \"Three's a Crowd\" (1930–31), which eventually led to his full-time entry to radio in 1932.\n\nAllen first hosted The Linit Bath Club Revue on CBS, moving the show to NBC and becoming \"The Salad Bowl Revue\" (in a nod to new sponsor Hellmann's Mayonnaise, which was marketed by the parent company of Linit) later in the year. The show became \"The Sal Hepatica Revue\" (1933–34), \"The Hour of Smiles\" (1934–35), and finally \"Town Hall Tonight\" (1935–39). In 1939–40, however, sponsor Bristol-Myers, which advertised Ipana toothpaste as well as Sal Hepatica during the program, altered the title to \"The Fred Allen Show\", over his objections. Allen's perfectionism (odd to some, considering his deft ad-libs) caused him to leap from sponsor to sponsor until \"Town Hall Tonight\" allowed him to set his chosen small-town milieu and establish himself as a bona fide radio star.\n\nThe hour-long show featured segments that would influence radio and, much later, television; news satires such as \"Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In\"'s \"Laugh-In Looks at the News\" and \"Saturday Night Live's\" \"Weekend Update\" were influenced by \"Town Hall Tonight's\" \"The News Reel\", later renamed \"Town Hall News\" (and in 1939–40, as a sop to his sponsor, \"Ipana News\"). \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson's\" \"Mighty Carson Art Players\" routines referenced Allen's Mighty Allen Art Players, in name and sometimes in routines. Allen and company also satirized popular musical comedies and films of the day, including and especially \"Oklahoma!\". Allen also did semi-satirical interpretations of well-known lives—including his own.\n\nThe show that became \"Town Hall Tonight\" was the longest-running hour-long comedy-based show in classic radio history. In 1940, Allen moved back to CBS Radio with a new sponsor and show name, \"Texaco Star Theater\", airing every Wednesday at 9:00 pm ET on CBS, then Sundays at 9:00 pm in the fall of 1941. By 1942, he shortened the show to half an hour, at 9:30 pm ET—under network and sponsor edict, not his own. He also chafed under being forced to give up a \"Town Hall Tonight\" signature, using barely known and amateur guests effectively, in favor of booking more recognizable guests, though he liked many of those. Guests included singers from Kingston, New York, the original woman behind the \"Aunt Jemima\" on pancake boxes, and more guests up the road—from Saugerties, like the singer, Donald Gardner.\n\nHe took over a year off due to hypertension and returned in 1945 with \"The Fred Allen Show\" on NBC, Sunday nights at 8:30 p.m. EST. Standard Brands' Blue Bonnet Margarine & Tenderleaf Tea, and later, Ford Motor Company, were the sponsors for the rest of the show's life. (Texaco revived \"Texaco Star Theater\" in 1948 on radio, and more successfully on television, making an American icon out of star Milton Berle).\n\nAllen again made a few changes, including the singing DeMarco Sisters, to whom he'd been tipped by arranger-composer Gordon Jenkins. \"We did four years with Mr. Allen and got one thousand dollars a week,\" Gloria DeMarco remembered. \"Sunday night was the best night on radio.\" Sunday night with Fred Allen seemed incomplete on any night listeners didn't hear the DeMarco Sisters, whose breezy, harmonious style became as familiar as their cheerfully sung \"Mr. Al-len, Mr. Alll-llennnn\" in the show's opening theme. During the theme's brief pause, Allen would say something like, \"It isn't the mayor of Anaheim, Azusa and Cucamonga, kiddies.\" That device became a signature for three of the four years.\nThe other change, born in the Texaco days and evolving from his earlier news spoofs, proved his most enduring, premiering December 6, 1942. The inspiration for the mythical Main Street of \"Allen's Alley\" came from the small-town heartland folks who were often profiled in the newspaper columns written by O. O. McIntyre (1884–1938), one of the most popular columnists of the 1930s with some seven million readers.\n\n\"Allen's Alley\" followed a brief Allen monologue and comic segment with Portland Hoffa (\"Misssss-ter Allll-llennnn!\"), usually involving gags about her family which she instigated. Then a brief music interlude would symbolize the two making their way to the fictitious Alley.\n\nThe segment was always launched by a quick exchange that began with Hoffa asking Allen what he would ask the Alley denizens that week. After she implored him, \"Shall we go?\" Allen would reply with cracks like, \"As the two drumsticks said when they spotted the tympani, let's beat it!'\"; or \"As one strapless gown said to the other strapless gown, 'What's holding us up?'\"\n\nA small host of stereotypical characters greeted Allen and Hoffa down the Alley, discussing Allen's question of the week, usually drawing on news items or popular happenings around town, whether gas rationing, traffic congestion, the Pulitzer Prizes, postwar holiday travel, or the annual Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus visit.\n\nThe Alley went through a few changes in the first installments. Early denizens included sarcastic John Doe (John Brown), self-possessed Senator Bloat and town drunk Sampson Souse (Jack Smart), dimwitted Socrates Mulligan (Charlie Cantor), pompous poet Falstaff Openshaw (Alan Reed), and wry Jewish housewife Pansy Nussbaum (Minerva Pious). By 1945, Pious and Reed were joined by two new Alley denizens: Parker Fennelly as stoic New England farmer Titus Moody, and Kenny Delmar, the new show's announcer, as bellowing Southern senator Beauregard Claghorn. Pious is credited with tipping Allen to Delmar, who based the character on a real-life person he had encountered while hitchhiking in 1928. Within weeks, Claghorn became one of the leading comedy characters of radio as listeners across the country began quoting his catchphrases: \"Somebody, Ah say, somebody knocked\"; \"I'm from the South, Suh\"; \"That's a joke, son\"; and \"Pay attention, boy!\" Claghorn served as the model for the Warner Bros. cartoon character Foghorn Leghorn, who first appeared the following August in the Oscar-nominated \"Walky Talky Hawky\".\n\nOther characters had catchphrases that were almost as famous as Claghorn's, such as Titus Moody's \"Howdy, Bub\", and Falstaff Openshaw's \"That is precisely why I am here.\" Mrs. Nussbaum always greeted Allen by saying, \"You were expecting maybe...\", and then she would mispronounce the name of a glamorous film star, such as \"...Tulalulalula Bankhead?\". The Alley sketches made only one further cast change, when Peter Donald's chipper Irishman Ajax Cassidy succeeded Reed's Falstaff.\n\nDespite the ethnic diversity, the Alley characters seemed less citified and more akin with O. O. McIntyre's small-town America. Allen's topical humor is sometimes thought an acquired taste for audiences curious about his generation of radio stars; Dunning has written that when he \"went into topical humor, he may have forfeited his only opportunity to be the Mark Twain of his century. He had flashes of undeniable brilliance. But the main body of his work deals with the day-to-day fodder of another time, and sons have seldom been amused by the embarrassments or tragedies of their fathers.\"\n\nBut others find many parallels to today's world and its absurdities. The \"Allen's Alley\" stereotypes make some cringe, as Allen biographer Robert Taylor noted (in \"Fred Allen: His Life and Wit\"), but others find them lancing more than lauding stereotypes, letting listeners make up their own minds about how foolish they could be. \"Interestingly enough,\" wrote Frank Buxton and Bill Owen in \"The Big Broadcast 1920-1950\", \"[Claghorn, Nussbaum, Moody, and Cassidy] were never criticized as being anti-Southern, anti-Semitic, anti-New England or anti-Irish. The warmth and good humor with which they were presented made them acceptable even to the most sensitive listeners.\"\n\nAllen employed a writing staff but they served as his sounding boards and early draft consultants as much as actual writers; it was Allen who had the final edit and rewrite of each week's script, working as long as twelve hours a day in his own right on ideas or sketches. His ad-libbing ability caused many a show to fade away behind the ending network identification, because Allen often ate up air time. It was not as unusual for him as for others to sign off with \"We're a little late, so good night, folks.\" Buxton and Owen believed the Allen show needed it more than anyone else of his era. Allen also \"died\" more eloquently than other radio comics, particularly in the later years. When a joke was greeted with an awkward silence, Allen would comment on the lack of response, with his ad-libbed \"explanation\" almost always funnier than the original joke. \n\n\"The Fred Allen Show\" was radio's top-rated show of the 1946-47 season. Allen was able to negotiate a lucrative new contract as a result not only of the show's success, but thanks in large measure to NBC's anxiety to keep more of its stars from joining Jack Benny in a wholesale defection to CBS. The CBS talent raids broke up NBC's hit Sunday night, and Benny also convinced George Burns and Gracie Allen and Bing Crosby to join his move.\n\nBut a year later, he was knocked off his perch, not by a talent raid but by a show on a third rival network, ABC (the former NBC Blue network). The quiz show \"Stop the Music\", hosted by Bert Parks (debuted 1948), required listeners to participate live by telephone. The show became a big enough hit to break into Allen's grip on that Sunday night time slot. At first, Allen fought fire with his own kind of fire: he offered $5,000 to any listener getting a call from \"Stop the Music\" or any similar game show while listening to \"The Fred Allen Show\". He never had to pay up, nor was he shy about lampooning the game show phenomenon (especially a riotous parody of another quiz show Parks hosted, lancing \"Break the Bank\" in a routine called \"Break the Contestant\" in which players didn't receive a thing but were compelled to give up possessions when they blew a question).\n\nUnfortunately, Allen fell to number 38 in the radio ratings, his fall compounded by the rise of television in many major cities. By this time, he had changed the show again somewhat, changing the famed \"Allen's Alley\" skits to take place on \"Main Street,\" and rotating a new character or two in and out of the lineup. He stepped down from radio again in 1949, at the end of his show's regular season, as much under his doctor's orders as because of his slipping ratings. He decided to take a year off, but it did more for his health (he suffered from hypertension) than his career; after the June 26, 1949 show, on which Henry Morgan and Jack Benny guested, Fred Allen never hosted another radio show full-time again.\n\nGood friends in real life, Fred Allen and Jack Benny inadvertently hatched a running gag in 1937 when a child prodigy, violinist Stuart Canin, gave a very credible performance on the Allen show, inspiring an Allen wisecrack about \"a certain alleged violinist\" who should hide in shame over his poor playing. Allen often mentioned his show-business friends on the air (\"Mr. Jacob Haley of Newton Highlands, Massachusetts\" was Allen's way of saying hello to his pal Jack Haley), and on the Canin broadcast Allen knew Benny would be listening. Benny, according to Allen biographer Taylor, burst out laughing, then responded in kind on his own program. The rivalry gag went on for a decade and convinced some fans that the two comedians really were blood enemies.\n\nThe Allen-Benny feud was the longest-playing, best-remembered dialogic running gag in classic radio history. The gag even pushed toward a boxing match between the two comedians and the promised event was a sellout, though the match never occurred. The pair even appeared together in films, including \"Love Thy Neighbor\" (1940) and \"It's in the Bag!\" (1945), Allen's only starring vehicle, also featuring William Bendix, Robert Benchley, and Jerry Colonna. He also starred with Oscar Levant in 20th Century-Fox's anthology film \"O. Henry's Full House\", starring in the best filmed version to date of \"The Ransom of Red Chief\".\n\nSome of the feud's highlights involved Al Boasberg, who is credited with helping Benny refine his character into what may have been America's first stand-up comedian. Boasberg was well known behind the scenes as a top comedy writer and script doctor, but he seldom received recognition in public. He worked, uncredited, on many films (including the Marx Brothers' hits \"A Night at the Opera\" and \"A Day at the Races\"). Steaming mad because of his long battles for recognition, Boasberg was said to have delivered a tirade that ended up (in slightly altered form) in an Allen-Benny feud routine:\n\nAllen: \"Why you fugitive from a Ripley cartoon ... I'll knock you flatter than the first eight minutes of this program.\"\n\nBenny: \"You ought to do well in pictures, Mr. Allen, now that Boris Karloff is back in England.\"\n\nAllen: \"Why, if I was a horse, a pony even, and found out that any part of my tail was used in your violin bow, I'd hang my head in my oatbag from then on.\"\n\nBenny's side of the feud included a tart interpretation of Allen's \"Town Hall Tonight\" show, which Benny and company called \"Clown Hall Tonight.\" A signature element of the feud was that, whenever one guested on the other's shows, the host would tend to hand the guest the best lines of the night. (Both Benny and Allen revealed later that each man's writers consulted with each other on routines involving the feud.)\n\nThey toned the gag down after 1941, though they kept it going often enough as the years continued, climaxing on Allen's May 26, 1946 show, in which a sketch called \"King for a Day,\" satirizing big-money game shows, featured Benny pretending to be a contestant named Myron Proudfoot on Allen's new quiz show. \nAllen: \"Tomorrow night, in your ermine robe, you will be whisked by bicycle to Orange, New Jersey, where you will be the judge in a chicken-cleaning contest.\"\n\nBenny (rapturously): \"I'm KING for a Day!\"\n\n[Allen proceeds to have Benny's clothes pressed:]\n\nAllen: \"And that's not all!\"\n\nBenny: \"There's more?\"\n\nAllen: \"Yes! On our stage we have a Hoffman pressing machine.\"\n\nBenny: \"Now wait a minute! Wait a minute!\"\n\nAllen: \"An expert operating the Hoffman pressing machine will press your trousers in seconds.\"\n\nBenny: \"NOW WAIT A MINUTE!!!\" (total audience hysteria laughter, as Benny's pants are literally removed).\n\nAllen: \"Quiet, King!\"\n\nBenny: \"Come on, Allen, give me my pants!\"\n\nAllen: \"Keep your shirt on, King.\"\n\nBenny: \"You bet I'll keep my shirt on!\"\n\nAllen: \"We're a little late, folks! Tune in next week---\"\n\nBenny: \"Allen, this is a frame--- (starts laughing himself) Where are my pants!\"\n\nAllen: \"Benny, for 15 years I've been waiting to catch you like this!\"\n\nBenny: \"Allen, you haven't seen the end of me!\"\n\nAllen: \"It won't be long now!\"\n\nBenny: \"I want my pants!\"\n\nAllen and Benny couldn't resist one more play on the feud on Allen's final show. Benny appeared as a skinflint bank manager and mortgage company owner bedeviling Henry Morgan. Typically, Allen handed Benny the show's best crack: \"Listen, I was never \"this\" cheap on my \"own\" program!\"\n\nBenny even used the feud on his TV show, when Fred Allen appeared as a special guest in 1953. The program depicted Benny and Allen as rivals for the sponsor's favors. When the sponsor pointed out that Benny was also a musician, Allen countered with a passage on his clarinet.\n\nAs Benny said in his co-memoir, \"Sunday Nights at Seven: The Jack Benny Story\" (1990; his daughter, Joan, added her own recollections and published the book after Benny's death), \"[T]he sky was the limit. Or rather, the mud was the limit.\"\n\nBenny was profoundly shaken by Allen's sudden death by heart attack in 1956. In a statement released the day after Allen's death, Benny said, \"People have often asked me if Fred Allen and I were really friends in real life. My answer is always the same. You couldn't have such a long-running and successful feud as we did, without having a deep and sincere friendship at the heart of it.\"\n\nAllen may have battled censors more than most of his radio contemporaries. \"Fred Allen's fourteen-year battle with radio censorship,\" wrote the \"New York Herald-Tribune\" critic John Crosby, \"was made particularly difficult for him by the fact that the man assigned to reviewing his scripts had little sense of humor and frankly admitted he didn't understand Allen's peculiar brand of humor at all.\" Among the blue pencils, according to Crosby, were:\n\n\n\"Allen not only couldn't poke fun at individuals\", Crosby wrote, \"he also had to be careful not to step on their professions, their beliefs, and sometimes even their hobbies and amusements. Portland Hoffa was once given a line about wasting an afternoon at the rodeo. NBC objected to the implication that an afternoon at the rodeo was wasted and the line had to be changed. Another time, Allen gagged that a girl could have found a better husband in a cemetery. (The censor) thought this might hurt the feelings of people who own and operate cemeteries. Allen got the line cleared only after pointing out that cemeteries have been topics for comedy since the time of Aristophanes.\" Allen's constant and sometimes intense -- as well as often ridiculous -- battles with censors may have aggravated his longtime problems with hypertension.\n\nAfter his own show ended, Allen became a regular attraction on NBC's \"The Big Show\" (1950–1952), hosted by Tallulah Bankhead. He appeared on 24 of the show's 57 installments, including the landmark premiere, and showed he had not lost his trademark ad-lib skill or his rapier wit. (The show's head writer, Goodman Ace, later told radio host Richard Lamparski that Allen's lucrative NBC contract was a large factor in getting him on the show, though Allen also wrote the segments on which he appeared and consulted with the respected Ace and staff on other portions of the show.)\n\nIn some ways, \"The Big Show\" was an offspring of the old Allen show; his one-time \"Texaco Star Theater\" announcer, Jimmy Wallington, was one of \"The Big Show's\" announcers, and Portland Hoffa made several appearances with him as well. On the show's premiere, Allen – with a little prodding from head writer Goodman Ace – could not resist one more play on the old Allen-Benny \"feud,\" a riotous parody of Benny's show called \"The Pinch Penny Program.\"\n\nIt was also on \"The Big Show's\" premiere that Allen delivered perhaps his best-remembered crack about television: \"You know, television is called a new medium, and I have discovered why they call it a Medium – because nothing is Well Done.\" That did not stop the Museum of Broadcast Communications from considering Allen \"the intellectual conscience of television.\" Aside from his famous crack about not liking furniture that talked, Allen observed that television allowed \"people who haven't anything to do to watch people who can't do anything.\"\n\nAllen tried three short-lived television projects of his own, including a bid to bring \"Allen's Alley\" to television in a visual setting similar to \"Our Town\". NBC apparently rejected the idea out of hand. \"Television is a triumph of equipment over people,\" Allen observed after that, \"and the minds that control it are so small that you could put them in the navel of a flea and still have enough room beside them for a network vice president's heart.\" His other two TV tries were quiz shows. \"Judge for Yourself\" (subtitled \"The Fred Allen Show\") was a game show incorporating musical acts. The idea was to allow Allen to ad-lib with guests à la Groucho Marx, but the complicated format had to be revamped in the middle of the run. (The star was \"lost in the confusion of a half hour filled with too many people and too much activity,\" wrote Alan Havig.)\n\nA comedy series, \"Fred Allen's Sketchbook,\" did not catch on. He landed a two-year stint as a panelist on the CBS quiz show \"What's My Line?\" from 1954 until his death in 1956 (March 17, 1956). Allen actually appeared as a Mystery Guest on \"What's My Line?\" on July 17, 1955, when he was taking a week off from the show to have an emergency appendectomy. Afterwards he joked about the operation: \"It was an emergency. The doctor needed some money hurriedly.\"\n\nAllen also spent his final years as a newspaper columnist/humorist and as a memoirist, renting a small New York office to work six hours a day without distractions. He wrote \"Treadmill to Oblivion\" (1954, reviewing his radio and television years) and \"Much Ado About Me\" (1956, covering his childhood and his vaudeville and Broadway years, and detailing especially vaudeville at its height with surprising objectivity); the former—which included many of his vintage radio scripts—was the best-selling book on radio's classic period for many years. After the frustrations and failures of his attempts to succeed on television, the popularity of \"Treadmill\" revealed Allen's potential as a literary humorist.\n\nAllen had a relatively minor career on screen, appearing in 7 full-length features and 3 shorts between 1929 and 1952. His first feature film was the 1935 Dick Powell musical comedy \"Thanks a Million\", which \"The New York Times\" reviewed, naming only Allen in their headline. 1940's \"Love Thy Neighbor\" played off the comic feud with Jack Benny. His sole leading role was as flea circus impresario Fred F. Trumble Floogle, in the frenetic \"It's in the Bag!\", a loose adaptation of Ilf and Petrov’s novel \"The Twelve Chairs\".\n\n Taking one of his regular late night strolls up New York's West 57th Street on Saturday night, March 17, 1956, Allen suffered a heart attack and died at the age of 61. A popular myth repeated for many years, first published in \"The New York Times\" story appearing the day after Allen's death, was that he had died while walking his dog. However, biographer Robert Taylor later revealed that Allen had never owned a dog. Allen died before he could complete the final chapter of his memoirs, and as a result the book was published as he had left it. He was a tireless letter writer, and his letters were edited by his wife into the publication of \"Fred Allen's Letters\" in 1965. \n\nDuring the following night's regular Sunday broadcast of \"What's My Line?\" at 10:30 p.m., barely 24 hours following Allen's death, host John Daly preceded the program with a special message to the viewing audience. He stated that earlier in the day the producers had considered replacing the regular game play with a special memorial episode, but Allen's wife Portland Hoffa stated that she preferred the show be conducted as it always had been, indicating that this is what Allen would have wanted. The program then proceeded as normal, but with a noticeably subdued tone. Steve Allen took Fred's chair on the panel. During the final ninety seconds of the program Steve Allen, Arlene Francis and Bennett Cerf (whose eyes began to tear) gave brief but heartfelt tributes to Fred. A somber Dorothy Kilgallen thanked Steve Allen for stepping in and helping them to carry on at a difficult moment; a similar on-air farewell would air after Kilgallen herself died unexpectedly in 1965.\n\nFred Allen is buried at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New York. Both his real and stage names are engraved on the headstone.\n\nAllen has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: a radio star at 6713 Hollywood Blvd. and a TV star at 7001 Hollywood Blvd. His widow, Portland Hoffa, married bandleader Joe Rimes in 1959 and celebrated a second silver wedding anniversary well before her own death of natural causes in Los Angeles on Christmas Day, 1990. Allen was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1988. A pedestrian passageway in the Boston Theater District, designated \"Allen's Alley\", also honors his memory.\n\nSeveral late-'30s Warner Bros. \"Merrie Melodies\" cartoon shorts feature parodies of Allen. Friz Freleng's \"Toy Town Hall\" (1936) is a spoof of Allen's \"Town Hall Tonight\", with toys that come to life in a boy's dreams and put on a variety show. Frank Tashlin's \"The Woods Are Full of Cuckoos\" (1937) features a Fred Allen fox screaming about being misinformed, hinting about his heated feuds with censors who were often at the last minute forcing script changes on his show because of its content. And Tex Avery's \"Thugs with Dirty Mugs\" (1938) features the main character addressing the audience and showing them his Fred Allen impersonation in one scene.\n\nIn \"Action Comics\" #50 (July 1942), Superman quips, \"Fred Allen would get a kick out of this!\" as he hops on to the side of a moving train.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Many frogs, especially small ones, are inexpensive, and their food is in most cases easily purchased. Commonly kept pet frogs include ranids, hylids, bufonids, leptodactylids, and dendrobatids.\n\nPet frogs can be fed a wide variety of live foods, from pinhead crickets to mice and rats, depending on the size of the frog. Particularly small pet frogs, like those of \"Dendrobates\" and \"Phyllobates\" species, will generally feed on small crickets, fruit flies, springtails, and other small arthropods. Medium-sized pet frogs can be fed larger crickets, mealworms, butterworms, silkworms, grasshoppers, and even small fish. Large pet frogs, like those in the genus \"Ceratophrys\" can be fed small fish, other frogs, reptiles, and small mammals such as mice or rats.\n\nDepending on the size and nature of the frog, the size of terrariums in which they can be kept varies widely. Small or sluggish frogs can be kept in 60 x 30 x 30 cm terrariums; the highly active dendrobatids are an exception as they like to climb; dendrobatids generally need a terrarium of about 1 m x 60 cm x 60 cm. Large frogs, on the other hand, may need a terrarium measuring 1 m in each direction. Some arboreal frogs, such as dendrobatids, can stick to glass; these frogs require terrariums with sealed tops to prevent escape. Tropical frogs also often require an air flow; cages with metal mesh on at least two walls should provide them with enough air flow. All pet frogs require moisture; this can be provided either with an automatic fog machine or by a hand-held spray bottle. Frogs that live in the jungle naturally must be misted at least twice per day; frogs native to drier areas do not require as much moisture. Pools of clean water must also be provided; water with chlorine in it can damage the frogs. Bottled water should be used instead to fill the frogs' pools.\n\n"}

{"id": "11152729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11152729", "title": "International No Diet Day", "text": "International No Diet Day\n\nInternational No Diet Day (INDD) is an annual celebration of body acceptance, including fat acceptance and body shape diversity. This day is also dedicated to promoting a healthy life style with a focus on health at any size and in raising awareness of the potential dangers of dieting and the unlikelihood of success; the Institute of Medicine summarises: \"those who complete weight loss programs lose approximately 10 percent of their body weight only to regain two-thirds within a year and almost all of it within five years.\" The first International No Diet Day was celebrated in the UK in 1992. Feminist groups in other countries around the globe have started to celebrate International No Diet Day, especially in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Israel, Denmark, Sweden and Brazil.\n\nSince 1998 both the International Size Acceptance Association (ISAA) and the National Organisation for Women (NOW) have sponsored similar days. ISAA's day is the International Size Acceptance Day which is celebrated on 24 April. NOW organises a \"Love Your Body\" campaign, with its own annual Love Your Body Day in the fall, which critiques what it defines as \"fake Images\" of the fashion, beauty and diet industries demanding that images of women with diverse body sizes and shapes are used instead.\n\nInternational No Diet Day is observed on May 6, and its symbol is a light blue ribbon.\n\nIn celebrating International No Diet Day, participants aim to:\n\nThe Institute of Medicine's Committee To Develop Criteria for Evaluating the Outcomes of Approaches To Prevent and Treat Obesity in its book \"Weighing the Options: Criteria For Evaluating Weight Management Programs\" states that \"the intractability of obesity\" has led to the anti-dieting movement. International No Diet Day is then mentioned and the authors comment:\nWe agree, of course, that there should be more appreciation and acceptance of diversity in the physical attributes of people, more discouragement of dieting in vain attempts to attain unrealistic physical ideals, and no obsession with weight loss by individuals who are at or near desirable or healthy weights. However, it is inappropriate to argue that obese individuals should simply accept their body weight and not attempt to reduce, particularly if the obesity is increasing their risk for developing other medical problems or diseases.\n\nInternational No Diet Day was created by Mary Evans Young in 1992. Young is the director of the British group \"Diet Breakers\". After personally experiencing anorexia nervosa, she worked to help people appreciate themselves for what they are, and to appreciate the body they have. Young, a British feminist, developed her understanding both through her own experiences of being bullied at school for being fat and by speaking with women who attended the management courses she ran. She relates in her book, \"Diet Breaking: Having It All Without Having to Diet\", how during one of these courses in 1991 she became irritated with the coffee break conversation about whether or not the women were going to eat a biscuit - \"Oh, I'll just have one\", \"I shouldn't really\", \"Oh, all right then\". Young asked the group \"What do you think would happen if you spent as much time and energy on your careers as you do on diets?\"\n\nTwo other incidents strengthened Young's desire to expose what she believes is the futility of dieting. First, a television program in which three women were having their stomachs stapled in an effort to become thin. None of them received any counseling before undergoing surgery and one of the women had split her staples, regained the weight, and undergone the operation again – three times. Mary found this program very distressing, eventually she realised that she identified with the physical and emotional pain of the women in the program because she had herself experienced that deep self-loathing. The second incident, about a month later, was Young reading in a newspaper aboout a teenager who had hanged herself because she was bullied for being fat. She was size 14 (USA size 12).\n\nIn May 1992, Young introduced the first No Diet Day. Originally intended to be a UK-based National No Diet Day, a week before the event, International Clear Your Desk Day was declared and Young was inspired to make her holiday also an international one. It was a small affair to be celebrated by a dozen women with a picnic in Hyde Park, London. Ages ranged from twenty-one to seventy-six and they all wore stickers saying: \"Ditch That Diet\". It rained, and so Mary Evans Young held the picnic in her home.\n\nBy 1993, feminists in many more countries were planning on celebrating International No Diet Day. Americans, particularly those in California, Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, were concerned that the date clashed with the Cinco de Mayo celebrations in the southern states. For Young there was no particular significance to 5 May so she agreed to change the date to May 6, coincidentally her birthday.\n\nINDD has evolved into No Diet Day, still on May 6, recommended as a marketing technique for restaurant owners via indulgent treats for their customers. In a similar approach, in a discussion on social marketing techniques for Australian public health educators it was suggested that local campaigns could be tagged onto a national social marketing strategy and the example given was to attach a local Healthy Eating campaign onto 'National No-Diet Day'.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1896986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896986", "title": "Kendama", "text": "Kendama\n\nThe is a traditional Japanese skill toy. The \"ken\" has three cups and a spike which fits into the hole in the ball. The \"kendama\" is a variant of the classic cup-and-ball game, and the Hispanic world toy known as \"boliche\" or \"balero\". The principle of these toys are the same: catching one object with another, where both are joined by a string. However the modern kendama style takes influences from a diverse range of skills including yo-yo, diabolo, and juggling.\n\nThe origins of the game are disputed . It has been described as a variation of the French ball-and-cup game bilboquet which dates to the 16th century. It is generally agreed that Kendama dates to the late 17th or early 18th century.\n\nThe kendama arrived in Japan from the West in around 1777, at which point Nagasaki was the only port open to foreign trade. Reportedly, kendama was initially a sort of adult's drinking game — a player who made a mistake was forced to drink more. The game gained popularity during the Edo period (1600–1868).\n\nIn the early 20th century, the toy had two side cups and was called a \"jitsugetsu ball\" . This translates to \"sun and moon ball\", named so because of the ball's representation of the sun and the cups' likeness to the crescent moon.\n\nIn 1919, Hamaji Egusa applied for a patent on the \"ball and cup\" style toy and it was awarded in 1920. The size and proportions of the toy were later altered. Hatsukaichi City in Hiroshima Prefecture is considered to be the birthplace of the modern Japanese Kendama. The current competition design descends from Issei Fujiwara's model, which featured string holes in the crosspiece. Little deviation has been made from his basic design, with the exception of the ken becoming more rounded to reduce wood chipping. It was also Fujiwara who established the Japan Kendama Association, which established the rules for play, the grading system now in use, and organised competition. To ensure that the toy was suitable for use in competition, the JKA also standardised kendama itself.\n\nToday, kendama is popular in many parts of the world. Kendama is particularly well loved in Japan, where national tournaments are held and Japanese employers recognise applicants who have attained the higher \"dan\" rankings as \"persistent, patient and determined potential employees\".\n\nDuring the 2000s, kendama surged in popularity outside Japan. In 2006 KendamaUSA and the British Kendama Association were founded. They began to promote kendama in North America and Europe, particularly throughout the juggling and rollerblading communities. Also, in 2010 Sweets Kendamas was founded. \nAs players worldwide began to put videos online, kendama continued to grow and has branched out forming its own global community. Many of those videos can be seen on Downspike, a forum and media hub for international kendama play.\n\nKendama play has also been used as a measure of accuracy, agility, and learning ability in robotic arms.\n\nTo play with a kendama, one holds the toy, and pulls the ball upward so that it may either be caught in one of the cups or land with the hole on the spike. More advanced tricks include sequential balances, juggles, and catches. There are eleven prescribed moves on the kendama trick list for achieving a \"kyu\" ranking and several more for a \"dan\" ranking. A 10-\"kyu\" rating (the lowest beginner grade) is attained by simply catching the ball in the largest cup. A book published by the Japan Kendama Association lists 101 different tricks for the toy and there are supposedly tens of thousands of trick variations. Different stances and grips are required to perform different tricks.\n\nWhile most people play with kendamas for personal satisfaction, competitions do take place, especially in Japan, where many kendama shokūgekìs (Japanese for battle) are held. Participation in such competitions entails performing lists of tricks in sequence or completing particular tricks repeatedly for as long as possible. Additionally, tricks may be performed head to head with a rival to determine a winner. The first competitor to fail a trick loses.\n\nIn the trick \"moshikame\" , the ball is juggled between the big cup and the smallest cup at the bottom repeatedly. A Japanese children's song of the same name is often sung to help with timing.\n\nThe Japanese Kendama Association has held kendama contests since 1979.\nThe British Kendama Association was the first group to hold a formal kendama contest outside Japan in 2008 at the British Juggling Convention in Doncaster and has been staging a British Kendama Open and European Kendama Open every year since. These contests have taken a variety of formats including trick ladders, speed battles, freestyle, and the head-to-head world championship style.\n\nThe Global Kendama Network (Gloken) held the first Kendama World Cup in 2014 in Hatsukaichi, Japan, utilizing a new format whereby players choose 5 tricks from a list of 100 and attempt to complete tricks within a time limit. These tricks are classified according to difficulty into 10 different levels and the player receives points corresponding to the level of the completed trick i.e. a level 7 trick is worth 7 points and but a more difficult level 10 trick is worth 10 points.\nThis year's Kendama World Cup (KWC 2018) will take place in Hatsukaichi again, on 21 and 22 July.\n\nGloken Kendama World Cup Winners\n\n2014 - Bonz Atron / USA / Kendama Co (at the time)\n\n2015 - Wyatt Bray / USA / Kendama USA\n\n2016 - Bryson Lee / USA / Sweets Kendamas\n\n2017 - So Kanada / Japan / Sweets Kendamas\n\n2018 - Nick Gallagher / USA / Sweets Kendamas\n\nCatch & Flow, Freestyle World Championship was first held in September 2014 in downtown Tokyo, Japan. Using a new format to determine the best freestyle skills in the world, the Catch & Flow defined a new way to perform freestyle kendama and to judge such style. Players from around the world apply to participate listing their achievements. The top approx. 60 players are selected to perform for 90 seconds one by one.

{"id": "2099535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2099535", "title": "Nana (echos)", "text": "Nana (echos)\n\nPhthora nana (Medieval Greek ) is one of the ten modes of the Hagiopolitan Octoechos consisting of 8 diatonic echoi and two additional phthorai. It is used in different traditions of Orthodox chant until today (→ Neobyzantine Octoechos). The name \"nana\" is taken from the syllables (written in ligatures \"ʅʅ\") sung during the intonation which precedes a melody composed in this mode. The name \"phthora\" derived from the verb and means \"destroy\" or \"corrupt\". It was usually referred to the diatonic genus of the eight mode system and as a sign used in Byzantine chant notation it indicated a \"change to another genus\" (), in the particular case of phthora nana a change to the enharmonic genus. Today the \"nana\" intonation has become the standard name of the third authentic mode which is called \"echos tritos\" () in Greek and \"third glas\" () in Old Church Slavonic.\n\nIn the theory and notation of Byzantine and Orthodox chant nana is the name of a special phthora which had been used in different ways according to its historic context:\n\nIt is supposed that the Hagiopolites treatise served during the 9th century as a manual preceding a chant book called \"tropologion\". The book contained a collection of simple hymns troparia as well as heirmoi which served as melodic models () for the 10 modes of Octoechos.\n\nNana holds the status one of the two \"special\" additional echoi or \"mesoi\" (medial forms between authentic and plagal echoi) in the system of the Hagiopolitan Octoechos. The other one is called nenano. Already in the Hagiopolites treatise the phthorai nana and nenano have been characterized as both echoi and \"not echoi, but phthorai\" (→ phthora). This means that they were proper modes with their own models, but they had to be integrated within the Octoechos and its eight-week cycle. Thus, phthora nana was subordinated to the tetartos, and the treatise also referred to it as \"Mesos tetartos\": as a third medial mode of the tetartos which was neither authentic (kyrios) nor plagal (plagios).\n\nThe concrete intervals of the enharmonic genus are less subject than the explanation of relationships between the modes. Often certain paragraphs of the Hagiopolites concerned about the phthora nana have been re-interpreted again and again according to the current tradition of psaltic art.\n\nIn contemporary theoretical explanations the phthora nana had not only been regarded as a melodic model for stichera and heirmoi, but also as a transition model as well, which mainly connected tritos with tetartos echoi.\n\nAccording to theoretical explanations of the Papadike, phthora nana was not only defined by its melos like a proper echos itself, as such it had been subordinated to certain echoi already in the Hagiopolites treatise. Manuel Chrysaphes, Lampadarios at the Byzantine court, emphasised that phthora nana is only used as a phthora of the echos tritos, but within its melos it causes always a change into the echos plagios tetartos. Any other changes have to be made after the transition into the plagios tetartos:\n\nHe also mentioned that the phthora had its own solfège (parallage), so that it solved the diatonic echos tritos and binds it to the echos plagios tetartos ( \"binding and solving\").\n\nThe distinction, that it was by the own solfège (\"apo parallagon\") \"like a kyrios echos of its own\" (\"os echos kyrios\"), meant on the surface, that the tritos could be based on the octave on B flat (heptaphonia) with the finalis F, while it had to change into the tetartos octave which was based on C and therefore used b natural as seventh degree. The triphonic solfège could be solved again from the enharmonic into the diatonic genus, but it was in fact not just a change of the genus (, \"metavole kata genos\"), but also a change from the triphonic into the tetraphonic tone system (, \"metavole kata systema\"). It was not organised by separated tetrachords (tetraphonia), but by connected ones (triphonia: C—F—b flat). Hence, the \"own triphonic parallage\" intermediated between both octave species, which were otherwise very far from each other. Already in this transitional function it formed an alternative melos of the tetartos echoi.\n\nThe phthora could intermediate, because it was distinct by its triphonic tone system and its enharmonic genus (the minor tone was always on the top of a tetrachord and smaller than a Western half tone—a diesis). Ioannis Plousiadinos invented an own system of parallage in shape of a square made up by four X. It was constructed to represent the triphonic combinations of conjunct tetrachords, but only the last two X on the bottom described the triphonia of the phthora nana—the triphonia based on echos varys (left) and the triphonia based on the plagios tetartos (right). Both possibilities were illustrated at the end of John Koukouzeles' didactic chant Mega Ison.\n\nThe Papadikai list between six and ten phthorai which represent the ten modes of the Hagiopolitan Octoechos—the diatonic eight modes (which did not need eight phthorai, since the echoi just represented the four elements of a tetrachord) and the two additional phthorai as their own echoi.\n\nIn this very particular sense, the term \"phthora\" did neither refer to nenano nor nana, but simply meant the use of a transposition sign in order to indicate the precise place of a temporary transposition ().\n\nNote also, that these phthorai <nowiki>[</nowiki> and <nowiki>]</nowiki> are different from those of , and or , since the phthorai of the latter <nowiki>[</nowiki>diatonic<nowiki>]</nowiki> echoi bind or solve quickly and thus, they only create a temporary change from one echos to another one, this is the only purpose they have.\n\nThe list of phthora did not include one to indicate a change into the melos of phthora nana. This change was instead caused by one of the great signs (), the xeron klasma (), like here in the sticherarion of the Biblioteca ambrosiana, where the medial signature of phthora nana (a temporary change into its melos) is prepared by this great sign.\n\nThis sticheron could be sung as well by a protopsaltes in the soloistic kalophonic style. If the medial signature of nana was the end of the section chosen for the realisation of a \"sticheron kalophonikon\", this sign could cause, that a whole kratema, a section in abstract syllables like for instance, was created in the phthora nana as an echos kratema.\n\nThe phthora nana was called in various theories \"phthora atzem\" which referred to perde acem (the fret on the long necked lute tambur called \"acem\" which was a common reference for Ottoman musicians) or even to makam acem—the \"Persian makam\" or \"phthora.\" Panagiotes Keltzanides' edition offered a seyir—a melodic example to illustrate makam acem—on page 81:\n\nIt is close to the melodic models of the Persian Dastgāh-e Šur.\n\nThe reform of the Byzantine neume notation in the early 19th century redefined the mele according to each genre (troparic, heirmologic, sticheraric, papadic), it also transcribed for the first time the rhythm which was so far part of an oral tradition or method, how to do the thesis of the melos. In these transcriptions the diatonic tritos echoi had little relevance. Chrysanthos of Madytos, together with Chourmouzios the Archivist and Gregorios the Protopsaltes one of the three \"great teachers\" that undertook the reform, published a treatise explaining the principles of the new system, entitled \"Theoretikon Mega tes Mousikes\".\n\nWhile there was once a diatonic form of echos tritos and echos varys, it has no longer any relevance for the current tradition of Orthodox chant, even if it based on Byzantine monodic chant. Orthodox chanters know nowadays only the intonation \"nana\" (), when they would like to perform melodies composed in echos tritos. Already Papadikai of the 16th century identified \"nana\" signature in their lists with the diatonic intonation \"aneanes.\" But its long formula was already replaced by the short of in Chrysanthos explanation of the former papadic practice of solfège using the enechemata:\n\nThis simple form is used until today, but Chrysanthos also developed its whole melos as a kind of exegesis (\"interpretation\") of the simple traditional echema of phthora nana:\n\nChrysanthos' exegesis of the real nana intonation uses the enharmonic intervals:\n\nHence, if the melos of the enharmonic genus starts on F , F γα and b flat [] should be symphonous, and not the phthongos c νη'. And like the diatonic and chromatic scales are made of tetraphonia, here they are made of triphonia:\nThus, also conjunct similar tetrachords are constructed by the same intervals in the middle [12+13+3=28]: C —D is equal to F —G , D —E sharp [] to G —a , E sharp []—F is equal to a —b flat [], etc.\n\nHe applied this intonation to the traditional varys enechema:\n\nThere is also a diatonic form of echos varys, but according to Chrysanthos' adaption to the Ottoman tone system it was no longer based on a pentachord between kyrios tritos and varys, but on a tritonus on a low b natural.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a sequel to the 2005 film \"Nanny McPhee\". It was adapted by Emma Thompson from Christianna Brand's \"Nurse Matilda\" books. Thompson reprises her role as Nanny McPhee, and the film also stars Maggie Gyllenhaal, Ralph Fiennes, Rhys Ifans, Ewan McGregor, Asa Butterfield and Maggie Smith. The film was theatrically released on August 20, 2010 by Universal Pictures.\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics and it earned $93.2 million on a $35 million budget. It also received a Young Artist Award nomination for Best Performance in a Feature Film. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the UK on 19 June 2010.\n\nOn a farm during World War II, while her husband is away at war, Isabel Green is driven to her wits end by her hectic life. Between trying to keep the family farm up and running and her job in the village shop, run by the slightly mad Mrs. Docherty, she also has three boisterous children to look after, Norman, Megsie, and Vincent. When her children's two wealthy cousins, Cyril and Celia, also then come to live with them, Isabel requires childcare help.\n\nWhen the magical Nanny McPhee arrives, the children at first do not listen and carry on fighting, which she soon puts a stop to. Meanwhile, Isabel's brother-in-law, Phil, has gambled away his half of the farm, and is being chased by two hired female assassins working for casino owner Mrs. Biggles. He desperately attempts to make Isabel sell her half of the farm, using mean and spiteful schemes to leave her no choice. Isabel takes the children on a picnic during which an ARP Warden, Mr. Docherty, warns them about bombs and how he imagines a pilot might accidentally release his bomb. At the end of the picnic, Uncle Phil delivers a telegram saying Isabel's husband was killed in action. Isabel and everyone else believes the telegram, but Norman says that he can \"feel it in his bones\" that his father is not dead. He tells this to Cyril, who at first says it is just because he is upset, but then agrees that Norman might be right, so the two boys ask Nanny McPhee to take them to the War Office in London, where Cyril and Celia's father works.\n\nThere, Nanny McPhee and the boys ask Cyril and Celia's father Lord Gray, who is very important in the War Office, what has happened to Mr. Green. At first Lord Gray sneers at Norman's disbelief at his father's death, but after Cyril blurts out that he knows his parents are getting a divorce, Lord Gray checks what has happened. While he is gone, Cyril tells Norman that he and Celia have been sent away because their parents will be splitting up, and Norman asks where Cyril and Celia will live. When Cyril replies \"with Mum, I suppose, not that it makes much difference, she only ever really sees us when she wants to show us off\", Norman tells Cyril that he and Celia are welcome to live on the farm with the Greens. Lord Gray returns and tells Norman that his father is not dead, but is missing in action, and that there is no record of a telegram being sent to his mother. After the boys leave, Norman deduces that Uncle Phil forged the telegram.\n\nWhile the boys were at the War Office, Megsie, Celia and Vincent were trying to stop Isabel from signing the papers and selling the farm. Just as Isabel is about to sign the papers, a German pilot accidentally drops a huge bomb; it shakes everything but does not explode and is left sticking out of the barley field. When Nanny McPhee returns with Norman and Cyril, Norman accuses Phil of forgery, which he admits to, and Isabel handcuffs him to the stove. The children go out to watch Mr. Docherty dismantle the bomb, but he falls from the ladder. Megsie takes over, and succeeds with the help of the other children and Nanny McPhee's jackdaw, Mr. Edelweiss. After Nanny McPhee helps to harvest the barley with a little magic, saving Phil from Mrs. Biggles hitwomen in the process, it is revealed that old Mrs. Docherty is in fact baby Agatha from the first film and that Nanny McPhee has been staying with her. As Nanny McPhee walks away from the now happy family, the children and Isabel chase after her, only to see Mr. Green, in army uniform with an injured arm, making his way to them. He runs to his family and they embrace.\n\n\nThe village in the film is Hambleden in Buckinghamshire, the farm set and scenes were filmed in Hascombe, near Godalming in Surrey and the War Office scenes, both interior and exterior, were filmed at the University of London, and the motorbike scenes on various London roads.

The figure depicted on an Ober is usually a nobleman or officer. It is distinguished from the lowest court card Unter by the figure's suit sign located in the upper range of the card. In the Württemberg pattern the Ober appears on horseback, as they inspired by Cego decks whose face cards included a Knight or Cavalier as well as the Jack, Queen and King.\n\nThe earliest description of playing cards in Europe comes from Johannes of Rheinfelden in 1377. He describes the recent introduction of cards in his region. For decks he regards as common, beneath the seated king were two marshals (cavalry commanders), with one holding his suit sign up while the other held his hanging down. This corresponds with modern obers and unters with the exception that they are no longer mounted on horseback.\nCard decks that contain four Obers are used, for example, in Skat, Mau Mau, Bavarian Tarock and Schafkopf. By contrast, the decks used to play Gaigel and Doppelkopf have eight Obers. In Schafkopf, the four Obers are the highest trump cards, in Doppelkopf the eight Obers are the highest trump cards after the two 10s of hearts. In the Bavarian card game, Grasobern, tricks that contain the 'Grass Ober' are to be avoided.\n"}

A Concert Celebrating Music Composed for Television\n\nScore! A Concert Celebrating Music Composed for Television was a live concert sponsored by the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, which presented iconic and contemporary television music performed by a 65-piece orchestra and a 40-voice choir. Hosted by noted author and journalist Jon Burlingame, the program included music from over 50 shows including \"Downton Abbey\", \"House of Cards\", \"The Simpsons\", \"The Walking Dead\", \"Game of Thrones\", \"24\", \"Glee\", \"The Borgias\", \"Nurse Jackie\", \"Family Guy\", \"Da Vinci's Demons\" and many others conducted by their composers. A career achievement award was presented to composer Mark Snow (\"The X-Files\", \"Blue Bloods\").\n\nScore! was the brainchild of the Academy's music branch governor Michael A. Levine. Levine, former music branch governor Mark Watters and Lucas Cantor served as executive producers. Spike Jones, Jr. produced and directed.\n\nSponsors of the event included ASCAP in conjunction with their 100th anniversary, The Guild of Music Supervisors, Cinesamples, The Gorfaine and Schwartz Agency, First Artists Management, The Society of Composers and Lyricists and Varèse Sarabande.\n\nTelevision Academy members and guests were treated to performances of various television scores by accomplished composers Sean Callery, Alf Clausen, Jeff Beal, Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman, John Lunn, Walter Murphy, James S. Levine and Bear McCreary, Trevor Morris, Ramin Djawadi and Mark Snow.\n\nUnlike previous Academy television music concerts, notably two at the Hollywood Bowl, the show focused almost entirely on current or recent program music, spotlighting suites created by composers especially for the concert. An opening video of theme-music clips from nearly 90 classic TV shows led seamlessly into a live medley of main titles from 24 contemporary series, which was arranged by 6-time Emmy winner Mark Watters. Shows featured in the medley included \"Game of Thrones\", \"Mad Men\", \"Copper\", \"The Amazing Race\", \"Survivor\", \"Parks and Recreation\", \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\", \"The Americans\", \"Modern Family\" and \"Veep\".\n\nSean Callery conducted his theme for \"The Kennedys\" and, in a send-off video before the performance of Callery’s \"24\" theme, Kiefer Sutherland complained that Callery did not get enough time in the Score! show, and Mary Lynn Rajskub said, “Sean Callery has won enough awards – how about one for me?\"\n\nActor Tim Daly presented Mark Snow — who happens to be Daly's brother-in-law — with the Music Peer Group Career Achievement Award, in recognition of the composer's prolific and diverse 30-year career.

And a rousing sword fight broke out between medieval-costumed warriors between Trevor Morris' \"The Borgias\" suite and Ramin Djawadi's \"Game of Thrones\" theme.\n\nScore! was met with critical acclaim. Tim Appelo of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" stated that \"The sold-out, 1800-member audience repeatedly leaped to its feet in standing ovations as the simple, yet intricate, music of 11 TV composers burst forth with a grandeur and sonic fidelity you can’t get at home.\"\n\nJon Burlingame of \"Variety\" noted that \"The immediate sellout of this event tells us what we suspected – that music for television is not just ‘background,’ or ‘underscore,’ as it's often referred to – but rather an integral part of the storytelling experience, a critical factor in creating mood, setting the pace, reminding us of the place and the people and most of all, conveying the emotion that is ultimately the reason we keep tuning in.\"\n\n\"It's said we are in the second Golden Age of television. But I think this is the Platinum Age and music is its emotional beating heart. There has never been such a confluence of so many great programs - and great scores - in the history of our medium.

{"id": "94154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=94154", "title": "Songwriter", "text": "Songwriter\n\nA songwriter is a professional that writes lyrics or musical compositions for songs. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre and Film Scoring. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with the task of creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers – songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers.\n\nThe old-style apprenticeship approach to learning how to write songs is being supplemented by university degrees and college diplomas and \"rock schools\". Knowledge of modern music technology (sequencers, synthesizers, computer sound editing), songwriting elements and business skills are now often necessary requirements for a songwriter. Several music colleges offer songwriting diplomas and degrees with music business modules. Since songwriting and publishing royalties can be substantial sources of income, particularly if a song becomes a hit record, legally, in the US, songs written after 1934 may be copied only by the authors. The legal power to grant these permissions may be bought, sold or transferred. This is governed by international copyright law.\n\nSongwriters can be employed to write either the lyrics or the music directly for or alongside a performing artist, or they present songs to A&R, publishers, agents and managers for consideration. Song pitching can be done on a songwriter's behalf by their publisher or independently using tip sheets like \"RowFax\", the \"MusicRow\" publication and \"SongQuarters\". Skills associated with song-writing include entrepreneurism and creativity.\n\nSongwriters who sign an exclusive songwriting agreement with a publisher are called \"staff writers\". Being a staff writer effectively means that, during the term of the songwriter's contract with the publisher, all their songs are automatically published by that company and cannot be published elsewhere.\n\nIn the Nashville country music scene, there is a strong staff writer culture where contracted writers work normal \"9-to-5\" hours at the publishing office and are paid a regular salary. This salary is in effect the writer's \"draw\", an advance on future earnings, which is paid on a monthly basis and enables them to live within a fixed budget. The publisher owns the copyright of songs written during the term of the agreement for a designated period, after which the songwriter can reclaim the copyright. In an interview with HitQuarters, songwriter Dave Berg extolled the benefits of the set-up: \"I was able to concentrate on writing the whole time and have always had enough money to live on.\"\n\nUnlike contracted writers, some staff writers operate as employees for their respective publishers. Under the terms of these \nwork for hire agreements, the compositions created are fully owned by the publisher. Because the recapture provision of the United States Copyright Act of 1976 does not apply to \"works made for hire,\" the rights to a song created under an employment contract cannot be \"recaptured\" by the writer after 35 years. In Nashville, young writers are often, strongly encouraged to avoid these types of contracts.\n\nStaff writers are common across the whole industry, but without the more office-like working arrangements favored in Nashville. All the major publishers employ writers under contract. Obtaining a staff writer contract with a publisher can be a first step for any professional songwriting career, with some writers with a desire for greater independence outgrowing this set-up once they achieve a degree of success. Songwriter Allan Eshuijs described his staff writer contract at Universal Music Publishing as a starter deal. His success under the arrangement eventually allowed him to found his own publishing company, so that he could \"...keep as much [publishing income] as possible and say how it's going to be done.\"\n\nSongwriters are also often skilled musicians. In part, this is because the process of \"working out\" a song or arrangement requires a songwriter to play an instrument, typically the guitar or the piano, to hear how the chord progression sounds and to hear how well a given set of chords supports a melody. In addition to selling their songs and musical concepts for other artists to sing, some songwriter-musicians create songs to perform themselves. Songwriters need to create a number of elements for a song. At minimum, a songwriter must prepare a lead sheet for a song, which consists of one or more pieces of sheet music with the melody notes and chord progression indicated on it.\n\nThe songwriter may expand upon the melody and chord progression by adding an instrumental melody (which may occur before or after the vocal melody, or alongside the vocal melody) and creating a more complex song structure (e.g., verse, chorus, bridge, instrumental solo section, verse, etc.).\n\nA \"beatmaker\" often referred to as \"co-writer\", is a songwriter that composes the instrumental musical composition known as backing track's or beats. The Beatmakers role is very similar to a film music composer who composes background music or soundtrack recordings for film production. Tools typically used are keyboards, drum machines, software synths and digital audio workstations. Beatmakers aren't necessarily record producers since they generally do not work directly with an artist in a recording studio. However, a traditional \nRecord Producer can be involved in the co-writing process wearing two hats as the Producer and Songwriter for writing the instrumental backing tracks for the recording Artist, there forth the Producer would receive both songwriting and production credits. This is especially true for Hip Hop Producer's in urban Hip hop production which Co-Writing is an integrated into their role as a Producer such as Timbaland or Pharrell Williams opposed to a Rock Producer that rarely Co-Writes the Music. Beatmakers sells or licenses (musical instrumental compositions) or beats to a recording artist as the Co-Writer for use in pre-production to create a \"New Song\". The Record Producer or Artist then takes the musical composition as the backing track to produce an entire song with vocal production, lyrics and arrangement glued together known as the Masters. Beatmakers often receive songwriting credits, writing and publishing royalties for their musical work.\n\nMany singers also write songs for themselves, and as such, they are usually referred to as singer-songwriters.\n\nWhen a song is written by more than one person, it is co-written, or written jointly or in collaboration with another author. Co-writers create songs in different ways. Some co-writers use a \"stream of consciousness\" approach, throwing out every single line or word or rhyme that comes to them. By letting ideas flow, this generates potential lyrics and song structures more effectively than trying to writing the song by discussing options. Co-writing can help two creators with different talents and strengths to create a new song that neither could have been able to devise if they were working alone. The first step in co-writing is to establish the division of the contribution between co-writers. In copyright law, there is no distinction of importance between the lyrics of the song or the melody of the song, therefore each writer is given ownership equally over all of the song, unless another agreement is arranged. \"Phantom\" songwriters are those who provided small contributions to the song, such as a band member who suggests a line for a verse or a session musician who informally proposes a chord progression for a coda. Once a songwriter is acknowledged as a cowriter on the project, this is almost impossible to undo, so \"phantom\" songwriters are not usually given credit.\n\nA top-liner is a songwriter who writes a song over a pre-made beat. Top-lining differs from songwriting in that the writer is not creating a song from scratch, but rather creating lyrics and melodies over an existing music genre, tonality, harmony, rhythm, and form of a song.\n\nIn modern commercial writing, it is a common practice for the musical track to be produced first without any vocal melody or lyrics. This is partially due to the rise of portable music production equipment and digital audio workstations that are designed for the swift arrangement of electronic music, such as Ableton Live.\n\nThe top-liner usually is also a singer, and will sing over the track as the demo singer. If the song is for a particular artist, the top-liner may sing the demo in that artist’s style. Topliners often work in groups to co-write. Sometimes producers send out tracks to more than one top-line writer so that the producer or singer could choose the best option. Since the track is the same, melodies by different writers can sometimes be very similar. Occasionally, the producer might choose a few lines of melodic or lyrical ideas from one top-liner without properly crediting or paying them. These situations sometimes result in legal battles over ownership of the melodies or lyrics.\n\nThere is a way to prevent such legal battles. A songwriter can commit their \"intent to make a song\", which prevents any of the parties ripping the song apart. Some artists send out a legal disclaimer making clear that if their melody isn't used after doing a topline, it reverts back to them, and the track back to the track writer.\n"}
{"id": "35758473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35758473", "title": "The Golden Boat", "text": "The Golden Boat\n\nThe Golden Boat is a 1990 American low-budget film directed by Raúl Ruiz. Shot in New York City, \"The Golden Boat\" is Ruiz’s first film produced in the United States and has been categorized as a absurdist black comedy.\n\nThe setting of New York City is not only important to the plot of the film but also its production, for the film was “made in cooperation with the New York performance art group, The Kitchen.” Ruiz channels the performances of the individuals in the art group in order to complete a “transposition of both US and Mexican soap operas” on screen. The film’s low budget was put together through a collaboration of small production companies; Duende Pictures, Nomad Films (Luxembourg), A.A.L.B. Partners, with the film’s ludic nature being born out of, or produced through, the “collaboration with the postmodern performance group ‘The Kitchen.’”\n\nOne thing that is abundantly clear about the film is its lack of obviousness or clarity, which makes it all the more interesting that this film marked one of the first times that Ruiz shot from a script. But even with a script Ruiz’s \"The Golden Boat\" is elusive and ever-changing narrative, a film in flux. \"In the United States you have to play by the rules,\" claimed Ruiz, who was living in the United States for the first time while he teaches film at Harvard. But a man making a feature for $125,000, from a script he wrote in two days and rewrites at whim, with a cast of mostly nonprofessional actors, who did not even know where his post-production money would come from, is not playing by U.S. rules. Yet in his standards this film’s production was much more structured than his past works, for Ruiz stated that his American film was very organized. He compares it to his works in France, saying “I have shot scenes where I didn't know which actors were coming. I usually write the scene about one hour before the take.\" \n\nThe film seems to break all standard conventions in a way that only Ruiz knows how to do so masterfully well. As a spectator one is left wondering what the film is about, as it’s “a sort of Beckettian black comedy of anti-manners, involving New Yorkers who insult and knife each other and themselves and then return from the dead - ask the question, provoke guffaws, and never get an answer. More often people defined the story by what it was not: as the Wooster Group’s Kate Valk, the Mexican soap-opera star, lectured me, “There’s no psychologically linear narrative. It’s more formal, more surreal. I am the sound of my voice, which is the same as the color of the room.” \n\nMembers of the production crew were given little direction in a way that provides legitimacy to the power of not knowing. Continuity is nearly entirely absent, for Michael Kirby, the NYU professor of performance studies who was playing Austin, a knife-wielding philosopher, said \"The Golden Boat\" had \"the strange continuity of a dream. The smallest thing that comes into a dream will suddenly make it take off in that direction.\" When asked about this, Ruiz began making air-drawn maps that turned and wandered and branched out like some unstoppable family tree. \"You can follow this direction or you can follow that direction and then suddenly there's another one which moves parallel to that one,\" he said.\n\nThe film deconstructs traditional narrative techniques, multiplying the linguistic eccentricities. \"The Golden Boat\" was realized on a small budget, relying on the avant-garde theater company The Kitchen. Several important actors on the New York scene took part in the film such as filmmaker Jim Jarmusch, writer Kathy Acker, Vito Acconci, John Zorn, the Wooster Group, or Annie Sprinkle.\n\n\"The Golden Boat\" is inspired by American police series, mixed with Mexican soap operas, and immersed in the artistic context of the Underground Art scene of the early 90’s of New York. In the street, a young student of philosophy and criticism at \"The Village Voice\", Israel Williams, meets Austin, an old man hurt and desperately in love with a soap opera star. Although he was stabbed several times, Austin does not seem to be affected by his injuries and refuses to go to see a doctor. He asks Israel to help him find his alienated son. Things get complicated when Israel discovers that the old man turns out to be a murderer. Israel is soon losing itself in a strange world populated by international celebrities, Marxist employees, and postmodern literary critics.\n\nShortly summed up as an absurdist odyssey through downtown Manhattan with a sweet old serial killer, a student rock-music critic, and international bohemians. The film is centered around the curious student Israel and the knife-happy Austin. Criminals in the film are desensitized and/or numb, with themes centralized around death, confusion, craziness, cowardice and loneliness. There are certainly more questions raised than answers given and the narrative seems to unfold in a way that parallels the narrative that is life.\nThe film is primarily shot in color during which the audio, or music, seems to undermine the visuals through a technique of cutting in and out quickly. Ruiz jumps back and forth quite a bit from color to black and white visuals, during which the music seems to play a different role, for during the black and white shots the music seems to add to the visuals in a hyper-melodramatic way.\n\nMichael Kirby - Austin <br>\nFederico Muchnik - Israel Williams<br>\nBrett Alexander - Doc<br>\nMary Hestand - Alina<br>\nMichael Stumm - Tony Luna<br>\nKate Valk - Amelia Lopes\n\nProduction Design by Sermin Kardestuncer<br>\nArt Direction by Flavia Galuppo<br>\nCinematography by \nMaryse Alberti<br>\nSound Design by \nPiero Mura<br>\nEdited by \nSylvia Waliga<br>\nMusic by \nJohn Zorn<br>\nAssociate Producers:\nScott Macaulay, Dimitri de Clercq and Jacques de Clercq<br>\nProduced by James Schamus + Jordi Torrent<br>\nWritten and Directed by Raúl Ruiz\n\nThe film was generally well-received at its time, described as “somewhat plotted than the standard Ruiz pastiche.” “Reality, dream and time merge in a vertiginous warped continuum. Ruiz seems to be suggesting that human redemption and spiritual resurrection are possible in the most benighted landscapes. None of this is meant to be taken too seriously.” The reviewer for \"Variety\" claims that Ruiz “benefits from working in English and on location in New York. Although unmistakably a Ruiz concoction, “The Golden Boat” has a punchy contemporary atmosphere lacking in his French-language museum pieces. Bizarre editing and no-frills cinematography make for arrestingly disconcerting images that evoke a cockeyed alternative universe.”\n\nJ. Hoberman for \"The Village Voice\":<br>\nThe least one can say for \"The Golden Boat\" is that it should show would-be purveyors of ironic noir how it’s done. In addition to the requisite impossible camera angles and loop-de-loop dialogue, the movie is characterized by its bloody tableaux, circular structure, and pervasive hacienda music. The locations range from a Bowery flophouse to Mary Boone’s loft to a pink-walled Loisaida apartment, and there’s some superb local color: the garbage that stews some Soho alley includes a half dozen pairs of shoes.\n\nCaryn James for \"The New York Times\":<br>\n“The Golden Boat” will be shown at midnight as part of the New York Film Festival, and though that slot is an appropriate tribute to its hip, cult sensibility, the film deserves prime time. Mr. Ruiz’s absurdist wit and skewed visual style have rarely been so accessible. His often laborious artistic imagery has never been so distant as it is from this slight, gleeful work. The twisty narrative line is as smooth and nonsensical as the film’s opening shot, in which the camera glides at ankle level through garbage-strewn gutters, following a trail of abandoned shoes. But unlike most Ruiz films, “The Golden Boat” at least has a narrative, however loopy it may be.\n\n\"Variety: Film Reviews - The Golden Boat\" from \n"}

Crist who uses the stage moniker ShoEboX and performs fast, synth-driven, pseudo-metal punk/pop. The band was formed in 1991 and its name is a reference to cartoons Crist used to draw.\n\nWorm Quartet's \"I Bit William Shatner\" was featured as a Top 5 song on the Dr. Demento Show in 2001, \"Frank's Not In The Band Anymore\" was Dr. Demento's 2nd most requested song of the year in 2002, \"Great Idea For A Song\" was the most requested song in 2004, \"You Were Wrong Cabinet Sanchez\" reached #15 in 2006, and \"Fueled By Angst\" reached #7 in 2014. \"The Ballad of Doctor Stopp\" was nominated for a Logan Award in 2013 after having previously won the Outstanding Original Comedy Song award in 2011, \"Fueled by Angst\", and \"Math is Bulls**t\" (featuring Insane Ian) were both nominated in 2015, and \"I Don't Matter\" (featuring Chris Mezzolesta) was nominated in 2017.\n\nWhile in high school, Crist created a cartoon featuring four worms which were depicted at various times singing songs with silly lyrics, or on mock record covers such as \"Worm Quartet Sings The Songs Of Barry Manilow While Puking And Pissing On Lobsters.\"\n\nAround 1991 Crist decided to begin producing music under the Worm Quartet name. He recorded the album \"Pass the Potatoes\" on cassette using a Yamaha PSR-6 keyboard. Despite being disappointed in the quality of the first album, Crist went on to record 10 more tapes of Worm Quartets very different style of music. In 1993, upon graduating high school and entering college, Crist was joined by Tony \"Coffee\" Roche on guitar, and Kevin Morgan on drums and recorded \"No Talent Implied\" which was to be a demo recording. Roche left the band shortly after and was ostensibly replaced by a drum machine. Crist and Morgan went on to record the first official Worm Quartet tape, \"Urine Sampler\".\n\nCrist moved to Syracuse, NY for software engineering work in 1997. Morgan left the band shortly after, so Crist began recording solo with the use of digital studio software, keyboards, and effects pedals, creating the first full-length Worm Quartet CD, \"Sumophobia\". Worm Quartet was played several times on the Syracuse radio stations WXXE, and WERW. He continued working in this manner while he moved to nearby Rochester, NY in 2001.\n\nHe returned to Syracuse on August 18, 2001 for his first live performance, part of \"TorpedoFest\", a benefit for Torpedo Magazine at the Old Parochial League where he sang over a prerecorded CD of the instrumental parts of the music.\n\nWorm Quartet released \"Stupid Video Game Music\" on December 19, 2001 which featured the award-winning song \"Frank's Not In The Band Anymore\". For the next several years, he would regularly play live performances. In January, 2004, he released the album \"Faster Than A Speeding Mullet\".\n\nCrist collaborated with Rob Balder under the name \"Baldbox\" in 2009 to release one CD (\"The Dumb Album\") and several follow-up songs, which have also been played frequently by Dr. Demento and other radio shows.. From that album, the track \"USF'nA\" was the 12th most requested song on Dr. Demento in 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
