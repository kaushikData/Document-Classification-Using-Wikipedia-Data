{"id": "5263148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5263148", "title": "ABC Movie of the Week", "text": "ABC Movie of the Week\n\nThe ABC Movie of the Week was a weekly television anthology series featuring made-for-TV movies, that aired on the ABC network in various permutations from 1969 to 1975.\n\nIn the 1960s, movie studios viewed television as a second-rate medium but also as a threat to their theatrical revenue, so they charged high fees for the privilege to broadcast their films. The networks experimented with having films made specifically for TV to lower expenses. NBC created the first weekly umbrella for such films with their \"World Premiere Movie\" in 1966, running in a two-hour time slot.\n\nUntil the late 1960s, ABC ran a distant third behind rivals CBS and NBC, leading to jokes about its acronym meaning \"Almost Broadcasting Company\" or coming in fourth among the three networks. Desperation and a looser corporate structure allowed ABC to consider plans that the other two networks would not. Barry Diller, then a junior executive at ABC and later a co-founder of the Fox network, is often cited as the creator of the \"Movie of the Week (MotW),\" but the concept was actually originated by producer Roy Huggins. Huggins reasoned that many older theatrical films ran shorter than 90 minutes so requiring a 120-minute time slot was unnecessary. His proposal was rejected by all three networks but became the subject of a cover story in \"Variety\" magazine. ABC's interest was renewed but they lacked confidence that Huggins could produce an entire season of telefilms by himself. As the \"Variety\" article had effectively placed the concept into the public domain, ABC continued to develop it without Huggins' permission or involvement. They approached Universal, which demanded a larger budget than ABC wanted to spend, as well as the exclusive right to produce all future TV movies for ABC, conditions that pushed ABC to control production on their own, assigning them to various studios and production companies. ABC consoled Huggins by allowing him to produce several films, including \"The Young Country,\" precursor to \"Alias Smith and Jones.\"\n\nThe shorter format allowed a smaller budget than previous two-hour films ($350,000 per film compared with NBC's $400,000 \"World Premiere\"). It featured the work of producers like Aaron Spelling and David Wolper (both of whom later developed hit series of their own), and was produced by different production companies such as Bing Crosby Productions, Spelling-Goldberg Productions, Thomas-Spelling Productions (partly owned by Danny Thomas) and the network's own ABC Circle Films.\n\nThe \"MotW\" provided ABC with a ratings hit and, along with \"Monday Night Football\", helped establish the network as a legitimate competitor to rivals CBS and NBC. The films themselves varied in quality and were often escapist or sensationalistic in nature (suspense, horror and melodrama were staples), but some were critically well received. For example, \"Duel\" (1971), based on a Richard Matheson short story from \"Playboy\", was director Steven Spielberg's first feature film, catapulting his career and enabling him to move from television to theatrical films.\n\nABC earned four Emmys, a Peabody Award and citations from the NAACP and American Cancer Society for an airing of \"Brian's Song\" in 1972. The 1971-72 season of the series finished as the fifth highest rated series of the year.\n\nThe series was documented by Michael Karol in his 2005 book, \"The ABC Movie of the Week Companion,\" which was updated in 2008 (), and by Michael McKenna in \"The ABC Movie of the Week: Big Movies for the Small Screen\".\n\nThe \"MotW\" originally aired on Tuesday nights at 8:30 pm Eastern/7:30 pm Central. Established series \"The Mod Squad\" acted as a lead-in from 7:30 to 8:30, bringing the younger demographic. The shorter running time of the film freed the 10 p.m. time slot for a full 60-minute program, initially \"Marcus Welby, M.D.\" during the first season. Starting earlier at 8:30 could also prevent viewers from switching to competing movies at 9:00. Beginning with the 1971 season, ABC added a second \"MotW\" on Saturday night and adjusted the titles of the shows to the \"Movie of the Week\" and \"Movie of the Weekend\". The following season, the Saturday installment was moved to Wednesday night, and the titles were adjusted to \"Tuesday Movie of the Week\" and \"Wednesday Movie of the Week\".\n\nDuring the 1973-74 season, ABC added another movie on Saturday nights to their schedule, this time titled the \"ABC Suspense Movie\", and usually consisting of thriller, mystery and horror type films (some of which were reruns of movies which had originally aired as \"Movies of the Week\").\n\nThe title sequence was designed by Harry Marks and animated by Douglas Trumbull using the slit-scan process that he had created for \"\".\n\nThe accompanying theme music was an orchestral version of \"Nikki\", a song composed by Burt Bacharach and named for his daughter. The theme was arranged and performed by Harry Betts.\n\nOver the music was narration voiced by Dick Tufeld . \"The Movie of the Week. Presenting the world premiere of an original motion picture produced especially for ABC (or 'for the Movie of the Week' in some seasons).\" That would be followed by a promotional teaser for the movie.\n\nThe opening for the Saturday \"Movie of the Weekend\" featured footage of a silhouetted \"rotating cameraman\" operating a 35 mm movie camera (). This footage would later be incorporated into the opening of ABC's New York City television station WABC-TV's various movie umbrellas beginning around 1972-73, including and especially their weekday afternoon movie showcase \"\".\n\nThe series was often used as a platform to show pilots for possible series for the network. It allowed the network to air pilots that it had already commissioned and paid for but had not ordered as regular series. As well, pilots that had already been sold as ongoing series or were being tested such as \"Kung Fu\", \"The Six Million Dollar Man\", \"Starsky and Hutch\", \"Longstreet\", \"Toma\", \"Alias Smith and Jones\" and \"Get Christie Love!\" premiered here and returned on the regular schedule after minor to major alterations to premise and/or cast. Other programs are sometimes mistakenly believed to have aired under the \"Movie of the Week\" banner. \"Marcus Welby, M.D.\" is believed to be a \"MotW\" but actually premiered after \"Seven in Darkness\" and was the lead-out for the Tuesday installment. Still others like \"Earth II\" and (Robert Conrad's version of) \"Nick Carter\" did air during that era, but were actually on other nights under different banners - the \"ABC Sunday Night Movie\" in the case of \"Nick Carter\" and \"Earth II\".\n\nMost of the actors in non-recurring roles appeared only once or twice in the series. Notable exceptions who appeared in three or more films as different characters include Doug McClure, Darren McGavin, Dennis Weaver, Earl Holliman, Leonard Nimoy, Barbara Eden, Elizabeth Montgomery, Donna Mills, Ed Nelson, Ken Berry, Connie Stevens, Myrna Loy and William Windom.\n\nMany of the telefilms had actors credited as guest stars, special guest stars and \"special appearance by,\" even if the movie was not a pilot for a series. \"Death Race\" and \"The Weekend Nun\" billed their lead actors as special guest stars. In the unusual case of \"Assault on the Wayne,\" all of the first-billed cast members were credited as guest stars.\n\nThe series proper ended in 1975 as ABC's ratings collapsed that season. Analysts laid part of the blame on ABC's reliance on the \"MotW,\" which had suffered from ratings fatigue as well as a perceived drop in quality in its final season. After that, ABC's made-for-TV movies were either aired as stand-alone specials or shown in time slots that included both original and theatrical movie presentations, notably the \"ABC Friday Night Movie\" and the \"ABC Sunday Night Movie\". The \"Tuesday Movie of the Week\" would later be incorporated as part of \"ABC Late Night\", a replacement of \"ABC's Wide World of Entertainment\" that ran from 1976 to 1982; the late-night version would mainly feature repeats of movies, both made for television and traditional theatrical releases, that were previously seen on ABC and other networks. ABC continued to premiere new TV films on Sunday nights in prime time until 2005.\n\n\nOpening of \"ABC Movie of the Week\"\n\n"}
{"id": "16050580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16050580", "title": "A Thurber Carnival", "text": "A Thurber Carnival\n\nA Thurber Carnival is a revue by James Thurber, adapted by the author from his stories, cartoons and casuals (humorous short pieces), nearly all of which originally appeared in \"The New Yorker\". It was directed by Burgess Meredith. Following a six city tryout, during which Thurber continued to rewrite the show, it premiered on Broadway on February 26, 1960, and ran for 223 performances, with a break from June 25 to September 5. It closed on November 26, 1960. The title is similar to that of \"The Thurber Carnival\" (1945), Thurber's most successful collection of stories and drawings.\n\nThe nine member cast played roles generically designated as First Man, First Woman, etc., as listed in the published script. Each of these roles included portrayals of numerous characters within the revue's 16 sketches. The opening night cast was as follows:\n\nThese were supported by the jazz music of the Don Elliott Quartet (Jack Six, Jimmy Raney, Ronnie Bedford and Don Elliott).\n\nJames Thurber played himself in 88 performances, dictating letters in the sketch \"File and Forget\".\n\nThe sketches in Act One of the revue are as follows:\n\nWord Dance (Part 1) is a series of punchlines, delivered during breaks in the music as the characters dance, similar to the \"Cocktail Party\" sketches that later appeared in the television series \"Laugh-In\". The scene was staged by James Starbuck, with music from the Don Elliott Quartet. The characters were credited only by the generic names (and as \"performer\" in the Internet Broadway Database). The punchlines were primarily derived from the captions of Thurber cartoons, including \"Where did you get those big brown eyes and that tiny mind?\" Part 2 of the sketch appears at the end of Act 2.\n\nThe Night the Bed Fell consists of First Man sitting at the edge of the stage, telling the story of a particular night from his (Thurber's) childhood, when a collapsing bed provoked remarkable reactions from members of his eccentric extended family. The fictionalized reminiscence first appeared in \"The New Yorker\" on July 8, 1933, and was reprinted in the book \"My Life and Hard Times\" (1933).\n\nFables (Part 1) is a set of three of Thurber's \"Fables for Our Time\", originally staged by James Starbuck. In each fable, the nominally animal characters dress and behave as humans. It includes the following:\n\n\"If Grant Had Been Drinking at Appomattox\" - narrated by Fourth Man. The characters are Corporal Shultz of the Sixty-fifth Ohio Volunteer Infantry, aide to Grant (Fifth Man), Grant (First Man), Lee (Second Man), Lee's Staff Man (Third Man) and Officer (Fourth Man). Thurber's \"what if\" story about Grant and Lee at the Appomattox surrender first appeared in \"The New Yorker\" on December 6, 1930; and was first collected in his book \"The Middle-Aged Man on the Flying Trapeze\" (Harper and Brothers, 1935).\n\n\"Casuals of the Keys\" features two characters, Visitor (Third Man) and Darrel Darke (Second Man). It consists of Captain Darke telling his visitor unlikely stories of the people he has met. The story first appeared in \"The New Yorker\" on May 7, 1932, and was reprinted in \"The Middle Aged Man on the Flying Trapeze\".\n\n\"The Macbeth Murder Mystery\" lists its two characters as He (First Man) and She (First Woman). When a murder mystery aficionado finds herself with nothing to read but \"Macbeth\", she concludes that Macbeth was not the killer, and gives her acquaintance a very different way of looking at William Shakespeare's works. The story appeared in the \"New Yorker\" on October 2, 1937, and was reprinted in \"My World—and Welcome to It\" (1942).\n\n\"Gentlemen Shoppers\" - narrated by Fourth Man. Characters include Salesgirl (Second Woman), Westwater (Third Man), Bargirl (Third Woman), Anderson (First Man), and Bailey (Second Man). This story of drunken shoppers was specially written for \"A Thurber Carnival\". It did not appear in \"The New Yorker\", and has never been published in prose form.\n\n\"The Last Flower\" - The First Man narrates this slide show of Thurber's cartoon series about the aftermath of World War XII, which first appeared as a book, \"The Last Flower: A Parable in Pictures\" (Harper and Brothers, 1939). An animated version of it was later featured in the Thurber-inspired film \"The War Between Men and Women\".\n\nThe sketches in Act Two of the revue are as follows:\n\n\"The Pet Department\" features the Announcer (Fourth Man), the Pet Counsellor (First Man), Miss Whittaker (Second Woman), and a Girl (Third Woman). This is an advice show, in which the audience is shown Thurber cartoons of pets about which the advice is sought. Some of the individual letters and responses first appeared in a mock column in \"The New Yorker\" entitled \"Our Pet Department\" in 1930. The complete prose and drawings appeared in \"The Owl in the Attic and Other Perplexities\" (Harper and Brothers, 1931).\n\n\"Mr. Preble Gets Rid of His Wife\" features Preble (Second Man), Miss Daley (Third Woman), and Mrs. Preble (First Woman). When Mr. Preble wants to run off with another woman, his wife attempts to stage manage her own murder. The story appeared in the \"New Yorker\" on March 4, 1933, and was reprinted in \"My World—and Welcome to It\".\n\n\"File and Forget\" includes the characters James Thurber (First Man), Miss Bagley (Fourth Woman), Miss Alma Winege (First Woman), Miss Wynne (Third Woman), Jeannette Gaines (Second Woman), Clint Jordan (Second Man), H. F. Cluffman: Third Man. The sketch consists of Thurber dictating a series of letters in a vain attempt to keep one of his publishers from sending him books he did not order, and the escalating confusion of the replies. The real Thurber, who was completely blind at the time and nearing the end of his life, played himself in later performances of the show. The original casual appeared in the \"New Yorker\" on January 8, 1949, and was reprinted in \"Thurber Country: The Classic Collection About Males, and Females, Mainly of Our Own Species\" (Simon & Schuster, 1953).\n\n\"Take Her Up Tenderly\" features the characters John (Second Man), Nellie (Second Woman), and Lou (First Woman), updating classic poetry to be more cheerful. The prose version of the piece, which was a humorous essay rather than a short story, originally appeared in \"The Bermudian\", and was collected in \"Thurber Country\".\n\n\"Fables (Part 2) \" consists of two more Thurber fables, originally staged by James Starbuck. They are:\n\n\"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\" - narrated by Fourth Man. This adaptation of Thurber's most famous short story features the characters Walter Mitty (First Man), Mrs. Mitty (First Woman), First Voice (Fifth Man), Lieut. Berg (Fourth Man), Nurse (Third Woman), Dr. Renshaw (Third Man), Dr. Benbow (Fifth Man), Dr. Remington (Fourth Man), Mr. Pritchard-Mitford (Second Man) and The Leader (Second Man). Mitty, a meek dreamer, imagines himself as the hero of four adventures. The stage version features a slightly more upbeat ending than the short story, with Mitty outwitting a firing squad. The original short story first appeared in \"The New Yorker\" on March 18, 1939; and was first collected in his book \"My World and Welcome to It\" (Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1942).\n\n\"Word Dance (Part 2) \" - Originally staged by James Starbuck, this is the continuation of the sketch that begins the show. Like Part 1, it is based on captions from Thurber’s cartoons and some of his other writings. It concludes with a request, taken from the last line of \"The Ladies of Orlon\" (from \"Alarms & Diversions\", 1957), for the women in the audience to keep their seats until the men have left the theater. \"They need, God knows, a head start.\"\n\nNotes in the script call for a set design (originally by Marvin Reiss) that features painted white furniture, with black lines painted slightly askew to mimic the look of Thurber's cartoons. The scenery also includes backdrops, cutouts and a white scrim that reproduce some of the cartoons themselves. The production is meant to include original music written for the show by Don Elliott.\n\nAn original cast album, featuring both music and dialogue from the show, was released by Columbia Records in 1960.\n\nJames Thurber (writer) and Burgess Meredith (director) won a 1960 Tony Awards Special Award for \"A Thurber Carnival\".\n\nA second revue based on Thurber's work, \"The Beast in Me\", opened on Broadway on May 14, 1963, and closed four days later. Adapted by James Costigan from eleven of Thurber's \"Fables for Our Time\", it starred Kaye Ballard and Bert Convy, with music by Don Elliott.\n\n"}

In a city suffused with a zombie-type infection which Amy is immune to (and can heal Lana from), Lana must stay near her young charge, for frequent healing, while protecting her from the infected, and the Phoenix Foundation who hopes to exploit her. \"Amy\" received negative critical reviews, although updates were released to address complaints.\n\nThe player controls Lana, the woman escorting Amy and protecting her as the two attempt to escape their disease-ridden town. They encounter monsters and the military, among other foes, in their attempt to escape. The player is forced to protect Amy from the zombies, often making her hide, to avoid detection. However, Lana starts succumbing to the plague without medicine, and thus must remain close to Amy, to return for healing. There are syringes infrequently, which allow Lana to heal without returning to Amy. However, when Lana is somewhat infected, she can safely walk past zombies, which necessitates a balance between healing and zombification. At certain times, Lana must rely on Amy for other abilities: Amy can use shockwaves, to push enemies and objects, causing distractions, as well as a sound bubble, muffling glass either being smashed or stepped on, defending Lana. Amy also hacks computers and climbs through vents when Lana needs her to.\n\nThe player must escort Amy, an autistic 8-year-old as they try to get her out of a city overrun with wild creatures and enemies. Lana (Sabine Crossen) and Amy are traveling to a doctor in Silver City via train, when an explosion derails the train, and their plans. They discover that the people have been turned to monsters via a strange infection, and must escape the monsters, as they continue their journey to the city. They must also fend off the Phoenix Foundation, an organisation who intends to control Amy and exploit her strange powers.\n\nOn 3 April 2012, VectorCell announced a patch for \"Amy\" on the game's official Facebook page. The patch was released on 6 April. Major changes include the saving of the player's progress during chapters, the addition of more checkpoints, skipping of sequences in-game and several corrections to the subtitles.\n\n\"Amy\" received \"generally unfavorable reviews\" on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN's Colin Moriarty stated at the end of his review that he \"spent at least a dozen hours with [\"Amy\"], got as far as the end portion of the fifth chapter, and gave up out of sheer anger and frustration.\" \"Game Informer\"s Jeff Cork stated that \"as a downloadable title, I wasn't expecting [\"Amy\"] to measure up against the triple-A juggernauts of the survival horror genre. However, I was expecting a game that was at least playable and contained some kind of entertainment. Make no mistake: Whether [\"Amy\"] is delivered to you via download, retail SKU, direct brain wave, or retinal implant, it is terrible and should be avoided.\" Jim Sterling of \"Destructoid\" went as far in his review as to describe \"Amy\" as \"one of the worst games ever made\". Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw of \"The Escapist\" criticized the game's awkward camera views, poor optimization to Xbox, and also gave up the game in frustration due to the addition of poorly implemented stealth mechanics, and later stated that it was the worst game of 2012. The most positive PlayStation 3 review was given by Thomas Pichler from \"GamingXP\". He praised the main protagonist, but criticized the periodical lack of explanation of what to do next. Alan Bradley of GamesRadar+ said \"Amy\" was boring and no fun to play and really unpleasant for most of the time. He also criticised the combination of a bad control system and widely spaced checkpoints that meant the player would have to repeat sections numerous times.\n\n411Mania gave the Xbox 360 version a score of 3.3 out of 10 and said that it \"tries to offer something new. The good news is that it does introduce some new gameplay concepts that can be toyed with by developers. The bad news, the controls and gameplay are implemented in such a way the game will just leave you frustrated and angry.\" Susan Arendt of \"The Escapist\" gave the same console version one-and-a-half stars out of five and stated, \"Pick something to hate about videogames, and \"Amy\" has it. Graphics glitches, lousy design, repetitious gameplay, mushy controls, bad acting, horrible save system ... it's all there. The game's few good ideas simply aren't enough to suffer through the amount of crap surrounding them.\" \"The A.V. Club\" gave the same console version a D, saying, \"Oddly, it is tempting to look forward to a second outing, however unlikely. Because videogame disasters this gruesome are fascinating. And, to be dangerously optimistic, \"Amy\" can't get much worse.\" \"Metro UK\" gave the same console version one out of ten, saying, \"Awful in almost every possible aspect, this hugely disappointing download is not just a failure as a survival horror but as a video game.\" \"The Digital Fix\" gave the PlayStation 3 version a score of one out of ten, saying, \"If you need to satiate your survival-horror appetite go revisit the \"Resident Evil\" series, \"Clock Tower\" or \"Parasite Eve\" as you will get much more interesting and developed games despite them being released over a decade ago.\"\n\nIt was included among the worst games of all time by GamesRadar+ in 2014 and in 2017.\n\n"}
{"id": "4057939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4057939", "title": "Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance", "text": "Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance\n\nThe Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance (also known as the Dworkin-MacKinnon Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance or Dworkin-MacKinnon Ordinance) is a name for several proposed local ordinances in the United States and that was closely associated with the anti-pornography radical feminists Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon. It proposed to treat pornography as a violation of women's civil rights and to allow women harmed by pornography to seek damages through lawsuits in civil courts. The approach was distinguished from traditional obscenity law, which attempts to suppress pornography through the use of prior restraint and criminal penalties.\n\nThe ordinances were originally written in 1983 by Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon, and supported by many (but not all) of their fellow members of the feminist anti-pornography movement. Versions of the ordinance were passed in several cities in the United States during the 1980s, but were blocked by city officials and struck down by courts, who found it to violate the freedom of speech protections of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nThe idea of combating pornography through civil rights litigation in the United States was first developed in 1980. Linda Boreman, who had appeared in the pornographic film \"Deep Throat\" as \"Linda Lovelace,\" published a memoir, \"Ordeal\", in which she stated that she had been beaten and raped by her ex-husband Chuck Traynor, and violently coerced into making Deep Throat. Boreman held a press conference, with Andrea Dworkin, feminist lawyer Catharine MacKinnon, and members of Women Against Pornography supporting her, in which she made her charges public for the press corps. Dworkin, MacKinnon, and Gloria Steinem began discussing the possibility of legal redress for Boreman under federal civil rights law. Two weeks later, they met with Boreman to discuss the idea of pursuing a lawsuit against Traynor and other pornographers. She was interested, but Steinem discovered that the statute of limitations for a possible suit had passed, and Boreman backed off (Brownmiller 337). Dworkin and MacKinnon, however, began to discuss the possibility of civil rights litigation as an approach to combatting pornography.\n\nIn the fall of 1983, MacKinnon secured a one-semester appointment for Dworkin at the University of Minnesota, to teach a course in literature for the Women's Studies program and co-teach (with MacKinnon) an interdepartmental course on pornography. Hearing about the course, community activists from south Minneapolis contacted Dworkin and MacKinnon to ask for their help in curbing the rise of pornography shops. Dworkin and MacKinnon explained their idea for a new civil rights approach to pornography, which would define pornography as a civil rights violation against women, and allow women who had been harmed by pornography to sue the producers and distributors in civil court for damages. The Minneapolis city council hired Dworkin and MacKinnon as consultants to help the city find an approach to deal with pornography. Public hearings were held by the city council, with testimony from Linda Boreman, Ed Donnerstein (a pornography researcher from the University of Wisconsin–Madison), and Pauline Bart, a radical feminist professor from Chicago. The ordinance was passed on December 30, 1983 but vetoed by Mayor Donald M. Fraser (who opposed the idea on its merits and also claimed that the city ought not get involved in litigation over the ordinance's constitutionality). The ordinance was passed a second time in July 1984, and was vetoed again by Fraser. In the interim, the city council in Indianapolis invited Dworkin and MacKinnon to draft a similar ordinance, and also held public hearings. A different version of the ordinance, rewritten to focus specifically on pornography that depicted violence, was passed by the Indianapolis city council and signed into law by Mayor William Hudnut on May 1, 1984. However, the law was quickly challenged in court, and overturned as unconstitutional by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals's ruling on American Booksellers v. Hudnut. The Supreme Court denied to hear the case, thus leaving the ordinance unconstitutional. The case is often cited as an important decision on freedom of speech as applied to pornography.\n\nIn spite of the defeat in the courts, Dworkin, MacKinnon, and some other feminists continued to advocate versions of the civil rights ordinance, organizing campaigns to place it on the ballot as a voter initiative in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1985 (where it was voted down in the referendum 58%–42%), and then again in Bellingham, Washington in 1988 (where it was passed). The American Civil Liberties Union filed suit against the city of Bellingham after the ordinance was passed, and the federal court again struck the law down on First Amendment grounds.\n\nFeminists were strongly divided over the anti-pornography ordinance. Some feminists, such as Wendy McElroy, Ellen Willis, and Susie Bright, opposed anti-pornography feminism on principle, identifying with sex-positive feminist position in the feminist sex wars of the 1980s. Many anti-pornography feminists supported the legislative efforts, but others—including Susan Brownmiller, Janet Gornick, and Wendy Kaminer—agreed with Dworkin and MacKinnon's critique of pornography, but opposed the attempt to combat it through legislative campaigns, which they feared would be rendered ineffectual by the courts, would violate principles of free speech, or would harm the anti-pornography movement by taking organizing energy away from education and direct action and entangling it in political squabbles (Brownmiller 318–321).\n\nIn 1992, the Supreme Court of Canada made a ruling in R. v. Butler (the Butler decision) which incorporated some elements of Dworkin and MacKinnon's legal approach to pornography into the existing Canadian obscenity law. In \"Butler\" the Court held that Canadian obscenity law violated Canadian citizens' rights to free speech under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms if enforced on grounds of morality or community standards of decency; but that obscenity law \"could\" be enforced constitutionally against some pornography on the basis of the Charter's guarantees of sex equality. The Court's decision cited extensively from briefs prepared by the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF), with the support and participation of Catharine MacKinnon. Andrea Dworkin opposed LEAF's position, arguing that feminists should not support or attempt to reform criminal obscenity law. In 1993, copies of Dworkin's book \"Pornography\" were held for inspection by Canadian customs agents, fostering an urban legend that Dworkin's own books had been banned from Canada under a law that she herself had promoted. However, the Butler decision did not adopt Dworkin and MacKinnon's ordinance; MacKinnon and Dworkin claimed that Dworkin's books (which were released shortly after they were inspected) was a standard procedural measure, unrelated to the \"Butler\" decision.\n\nDworkin and MacKinnon placed special emphasis on the legal definition of pornography provided in the civil rights ordinance. The civil rights ordinance characterizes pornography as a form of \"sex discrimination\" and defines \"pornography\" as \"the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures and/or words,\" when combined with one of several other conditions. In the \"model ordinance\" that they drafted, Dworkin and MacKinnon gave the following legal definition:\n\nEach version of the ordinance provided different \"causes for action\" under which women could file sex discrimination suits related to pornography.\n\nThe original version of the ordinance passed in Minneapolis, the Indianapolis ordinance, and the proposed Cambridge ordinance each recognized four causes for action that could justify a sex discrimination suit:\n\n\nThe Model Ordinance that Dworkin and MacKinnon advocated in \"Pornography and Civil Rights: A New Day for Women's Equality\" (1988), and the version of the ordinance passed in Bellingham, Washington the same year, added a fifth cause of action in addition to these four:\n\n\nThe most vocal critic of Mackinnon and (Andrea) Dworkin's rights-based approach to pornography is Ronald Dworkin, who rejects the argument that the private consumption of pornography can be said to be a breach of women's civil rights. Ronald Dworkin states that the Ordinance rests on the \"frightening principle that considerations of equality require that some people not be free to express their tastes or convictions or preferences anywhere.\" Ronald Dworkin also argues that the logic underpinning the Ordinance would threaten other forms of free speech.\n\n\n\n"}

The film also won Best Australian Feature Film at the Sexy International Film Festival.\n\nSister Marie Fenche is a woman on the verge of collapse. Unable to distinguish reality from fantasy, Marie's life is thrown into turmoil when she awakens one morning, alone in a room with a corpse in the bathtub. The truth is not even Marie knows for sure. Marie's only grounding in this confused world is Jamie, an innocent young nun who is both equally enamored and repulsed by her. Jamie can only help so much, however, and Marie's world comes crashing down when she encounters a mysterious stranger who triggers dark and dangerous memories. Unable to sleep and addled by pills Marie releases her final grip on reality as her dementia leads her deeper and deeper into a world of violence, sex and drugs.\nThe film was shot in Melbourne, Victoria.\n\n\nThe soundtrack was the first collaboration with the directors long standing composer Evan \"Moxie\" Kitchener. Their other features are Only The Young Die Good and Burlesque. The score has been described as tense and quite haunting.\n\nBad Habits has received mostly positive reviews upon its release.\n\n\"Digital-retribution\" gave it 4 out of 5 saying, \"Clever, gruesome, grotesque and all wrapped up in a gloriously slimy coat of sleaze, Bad Habits shows that its writer/director Dominic Deacon, and his crew who acquit themselves admirably, is a name to look out for. Next film please folks!\".\n\nSevered Cinema's Ray Casta gave 3 and a half stars (out of five) and said, \"The film is also erotic and psychosexual, but it never once succumbs to exploitation. A nice touch are the homage's to 1970's Italian cinema which are plentiful. Dominic Deacon's \"Bad Habits\" is a naughty, Giallo-inspired head-trip that takes the viewer on a dark journey where nothing is what it seems\".\n\nScaryminds.com gave it a perfect 10 out of 10 and said, \"One of the best movies I've seen all year, full recommendation to anyone who loves them some quality cinema. Bad Habits will provide the fix true movie fans have been waiting on all year\".\n\n"}

It is the sequel to \"Bases Loaded\" and is continued by \"Bases Loaded 3\". As opposed to the original, \"Bases Loaded II\" (and the sequels) was developed directly for Nintendo's consoles and never saw an arcade version. The game is the second installment of the \"Bases Loaded\" series. The game was novelized by Peter Lerangis, as part of the \"Worlds of Power\" series published by Scholastic Books.\n\nLike its predecessor, \"Bases Loaded II\" offers both a single-game mode and a single-\nplayer \"pennant race\" mode. In the \"pennant race\", a player must first achieve at least a 75-55 record during the regular season, then win a best-of-7 \"World Series\" against L.A. or N.Y. depending whether you have chosen a team from the Eastern or Western league respectively.\n\nThough some characteristics remained the same between \"Bases Loaded\" and \"Bases Loaded II\" (e.g. the same fictitious 12-team league returns in this game, with new players. It is worth noting that all of the players on the Washington, D.C. team are named after famous politicians, while all of Los Angeles's players take their names from Hollywood luminaries. In addition, one of Hawaii's pitchers is named Ho.), there are several noteworthy changes. One new feature was the \"biorhythm\" concept; players in the game had \"biorhythms\" that could be monitored to ensure optimal performance. \"Bases Loaded II\" had a little faster play action than the original game, and the point of view once a ball was hit into play was also different. In \"Bases Loaded\" the view was from behind home plate, whereas in \"Bases Loaded II\" the view was either from the first-base line if the home team was at bat, or from the third-base line if the visiting team was at bat.\n\nOne big improvement over the original \"Bases Loaded\" included the ability to modify the starting lineup and batting order for the user controlled team, and clearly defined pitcher's roles which were outlined clearly in the detailed rosters included with the instructional manual.\n\nOne other feature largely unique to this particular game was the concept of a mandatory called game via an unconventional \"9-run rule.\" Also, like in Nippon Professional Baseball, no game was allowed to last more than 12 innings.\n\nAllgame gave \"Bases Loaded II\" four out of five stars.\n"}

{"id": "43548543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43548543", "title": "Blow book", "text": "Blow book\n\nThe blow book, better known as a magic coloring book in modern variations, is a classic magic trick that has been performed for hundreds of years. It was most popular from the 16th to the 19th century, when variations of the concept were a staple of the book publishing trade. It has been referred to as the oldest example of a manufactured prop used for magic. It remains a common trick today, albeit mostly performed for children, preferably at birthday parties or other events due to the visual nature of the illusion.\n\nThe magician presents a book and riffles through it, showing a number of images in black and white. The book is then closed and a flourish is performed, normally involving audience participation, originally having an audience member blow on the outside of the book. The magician picks up the book and riffles it again, revealing that the images are now colored, or have changed completely into different images depending on the nature of the book.\n\nThe blow book is one of the oldest magic tricks. It has a history that is well-documented in historical sources, because the trick is based on a device that was only really practical after the widespread introduction of the printing press in 1450, which created a market for inexpensive paper and binding that the trick relies upon.\n\nThe earliest known mention of the concept was by Gerolamo Cardano in 1550, who described the trick by mentioning \"conjurors show different and always unlike pictures in one and the same book\". Another early mention is by Reginald Scot in his book \"The Discoverie of Witchcraft\", published in 1584. This work examined witchcraft and revealed the tricks involved, ultimately concluding that witchcraft was not real. As part of this discussion he mentions the use of blow books, and goes on to describe how to prepare a book that the magician would then \"whew you everie leafe to be painted with birds, then with beasts, then with serpents, then with angels, etc.\" He realized that the preparation might be beyond the capabilities of many would-be magicians, and directs his readers to \"buie for a small value the like booke, at the shop of W. Brome in Powles churchyard\", the earliest known example of a magic prop for sale. William Broome of St. Paul's in London was active between 1577 and 1591. A similar description of the blow book was published in French the same year by Jean Prévost.\n\nThe blow book is mentioned in \"Hocus Pocus Junior\", the earliest known collection of magic tricks in the English language, published in London in 1635. In this text the concept is called a \"iugling booke\" (\"juggling book\") or \"booke for Waggery\". It contains a complete description of how to prepare a blow book. The author suggests presenting the book by saying \"this booke is not painted thus as some of you may suppose, but it is of such a property, that whosoever bloweth on it, it wil give the representation of whatsoever he is naturally addicted unto\". He further mentions that in order for the trick to work, one must use a \"bold and audacious countenance, for that must be the grace of all your trickes\". Many of the tricks in the book feature the magician or an audience member blowing on the prop; this was a common fixture of the trade. The trick continues to appear in many books on magic through time, often with references to where to buy copies; in \"The Whole Art of Legerdemain\" of 1748 it's mentioned that \"the blowing Books ... may have them at my Shop on little Tower-hill\".\n\nNone of these very early examples of blow books are known to exist today. The earliest surviving examples are a Belgian version from the 16th century, and French and Italian books from the second half of the 18th century. By the 19th century prices on printed materials had dropped so much that the trick was quite well known, and it was not uncommon for magicians of the period to hand them out after their performances. Quaker Oats even gave out a version in their cereal. The basic concept has never gone out of print for long, and modern examples remain widespread today, along with descriptions on how to make your own. Modern versions are typically in the form of children's coloring books and remain popular, even appearing on The Wiggles.\n\nThe mechanical resemblance of the blow book to the early animation concept known as a flip book has been a subject of some consideration in animation circles. Whether the blow book inspired the flip book remains an unanswered question.\n\nThe most basic version of the blow book is based on alternating pages being different widths. The book is assembled by alternating the different pages, wide, narrow, wide, narrow (etc.), and then binding them together. Images of one type, black and white for instance, are drawn on every set of facing pages with narrow on the left and wide on the right. The alternate set of images, color in this example, are drawn on the alternate sets of pages with the wide page on the left and narrow on the right. The result is a series of alternating images on sets of facing pages.\n\nTo perform the trick, the book is held by the binding in one hand and riffled with the other; for right handed magicians this will normally mean the binding is in the left hand and the riffling is performed with the right hand. By carefully grasping the right side close to the edge, the fingers or thumb are only touching the wider pages, so when the book is riffled two pages flip each time, the wider page under the thumb, and the narrower one on top of it. This way the audience is always seeing the face side of a wide page and the back of a narrow one. To complete the trick, the book is simply riffled with the right hand inverted, or more commonly, by rotating the entire book around its transverse (horizontal) axis while the audience is directed elsewhere. This causes the upper side of the narrow pages to display along with the back of the wider ones. Images drawn on alternating pages are thus shown or hidden depending on where the thumb is placed.\n\nMore complex versions of the same basic concept can be used to have multiple sets of pages with different images. In these cases the pages are wider or narrower in a pattern along the entire length of the outer edge, creating a number of \"hot spots\" where the book can be riffled to cause different pages to appear. \"Hocus Pocus\" creates a similar concept by using small pieces of paper pasted to the pages to create the same effect, allowing the magician to grasp the tabs while they riffle. This version allows any number of pages per flip, the \"Pocus\" version using sets of eight pages.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12828393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12828393", "title": "Broadcast relay station", "text": "Broadcast relay station\n\nA broadcast relay station also known as a satellite station, relay transmitter, broadcast translator (U.S.), rebroadcaster (Canada), repeater (two-way radio), or complementary station (Mexico) is a broadcast transmitter device which repeats, or transponds, the signal of a radio or television station to an area not covered by the signal of the originating station. They may expand the broadcast range of a television or radio station beyond the primary signal's original coverage area or to improve service in a part of the original coverage area. These transmitters may be, but are not usually, used to create a single-frequency network. They may also be used by an FM or AM radio station to establish a presence on the other band.\n\nSometimes, a rebroadcaster may be owned by a community group rather than the owner of the primary station. For example, WHLS/WHLX of Port Huron, Michigan purchased a translator, and shortly after that switched to an alternative rock format without mentioning the original FM translator, except for their legally required top-of-the-hour ID. No AM frequencies have been mentioned.\n\nIn its simplest form, a broadcast translator is a facility created to receive a terrestrial broadcast over-the-air on one frequency and rebroadcast the same or substantially identical signal on another frequency. These stations are used in television and radio to cover areas such as valleys or rural villages which are not adequately covered by a station's main signal. They can also be used to expand market coverage by duplicating programming on one band to another.\n\nRelays which broadcast within or very near the parent station's coverage area (a \"fill-in\") on the \"same\" channel or frequency are called \"booster\" stations in the U.S. However, this can pose difficulties because the signals from the two stations may interfere with each other unless they are carefully designed. Radio interference can be avoided by using exact atomic time obtained from GPS satellites to perfectly synchronise co-channel stations, as in a single-frequency network.\n\nAnalog television stations cannot have same-channel boosters unless opposite (perpendicular) polarisation is used, due to video synchronization issues such as ghosting. In the U.S., no new on-channel UHF signal boosters have been authorized since July 11, 1975.\n\nDistributed transmission (DTx) is the use of several medium-power stations (usually digital) on the same frequency to cover a broadcast area, rather than one high-power station with repeaters on a different frequency. Digital television stations are technically capable of sharing a channel, however this is more difficult with the 8VSB modulation and invariable guard interval used in the ATSC standard than with COFDM used in the European and Australian DVB-T standard. A distributed transmission system would therefore have tight synchronisation requirements which requires each transmitter to receive its signal from one central source for broadcast at a GPS-synchronised time. DTS (or DTx) are not broadcast repeaters in the conventional sense as they cannot simply receive the signal of one main terrestrial broadcast transmitter for rebroadcast; to do so would introduce a retransmission delay which breaks the precise synchronisation required, causing interference between individual transmitters.\n\nThe use of virtual channels is another alternative, though this may cause the same channel to appear multiple times on a receiver (once for each relay station), and require the user to manually tune to the best one (which may change due to radio propagation conditions like weather). Use of boosters or DTx instead causes all relay stations to ideally appear as a single signal, but requires significant broadcast engineering to work properly and not cause destructive interference.\n\nSome fully licensed stations simulcast another station. These are relay stations in name only and are generally licensed the same as any other major station. This is unregulated in the U.S. and is widely allowed in Canada, while otherwise the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates radio formats to ensure a diverse variety of programming.\n\nU.S. satellite stations may request that the FCC grant an exemption to requirements that a properly staffed broadcast studio be maintained in the city of license or (in rural states) that television programming be simulcast in both analogue and digital during digital television transition. These stations most often cover vast but sparsely populated regions (in economic hardship) or are operated as statewide non-commercial educational radio and television systems.\n\nA television rebroadcaster often sells local or regional advertising for broadcast only on the local transmitter, and may also air a very limited amount of distinct programming from their parent station. Some such \"semi-satellites\" broadcast their own local newscasts, or separate news segments during part of the newscast. For example, CHEX-TV-2 in Oshawa, Ontario, aired daily late afternoon and early evening news and community programs separate from its parent station, CHEX-TV in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada. The U.S. FCC prohibits this on FM translator stations, and only allows it on different fully licensed stations.\n\nIn some cases, a semi-satellite is a formerly autonomous full-service station which is being programmed remotely through centralcasting or broadcast automation in order to avoid the cost of retaining a full local staff. CBLFT, an owned-and-operated station of the French language network Ici Radio-Canada Télé in Toronto, is a \"de facto\" semi-satellite of its stronger Ottawa sibling CBOFT as its programming has long either been identical or differed only in local news and advertising. A financially weak privately owned broadcaster in a small market can easily become a \"de facto\" semi-satellite by gradually curtailing local production and relying on a commonly owned station in a larger city for programming (WWTI in Watertown, New York, relies on WSYR-TV in this manner). Broadcast automation allows substitution of any syndicated programming or digital subchannel content which the broadcaster was unable to obtain for both cities.\n\nSome defunct full-service stations (such as CJSS-TV in Cornwall, Ontario, now CJOH-TV-8) have been turned into full satellites and originate nothing. If programming from the parent station must be removed or substituted due to local sports blackouts, the modified signal is \"de facto\" that of a semi-satellite station.\n\nMost broadcasters outside of North America maintain a national network and use several relay transmitters to provide the same service to a region or entire nation. In comparison to the other types of relays explained above, the transmitter network is often created and maintained by an independent authority, often paid for using television license fees, and multiple major broadcasters use the same transmitters.\n\nIn North America, a similar pattern of regional network broadcasting is sometimes employed by statewide or province-wide educational television networks such as Kentucky Educational Television, UNC-TV, Vermont Public Television, Wisconsin Public Television, TVOntario or Télé-Québec; a state or province establishes one educational station and extends it with multiple full-power transmitters to cover the entire jurisdiction with no capability for local programming origination. In the U.S., a regional network of rebroadcast sites may in turn join the national Public Broadcasting Service as an individual member station.\n\nIn Canada, \"rebroadcaster\" or \"rebroadcasting transmitter\" are the terms most commonly used by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).\n\nA television rebroadcaster may be permitted to sell local or regional advertising for broadcast only on the local transmitter. On rarer occasions, they may also air a very limited amount of distinct programming from their parent station. Some such \"semi-satellites\" broadcast their own local newscasts, or separate news segments during part of the newscast.\n\nThere is no strict rule for the call sign of a television rebroadcaster. Some transmitters have distinct call signs from the parent station (for example, CFGC in Sudbury is a rebroadcaster of CIII), while others use the call sign of the originating station followed by a number (e.g., the former CBLFT-17 in Sarnia, Ontario). Officially, the latter type includes the television station's \"-TV\" suffix between the call sign and the number, although in media directories this is often left out for convenience.\n\nIn the latter case, the numbers are usually applied sequentially, starting from one and denoting the chronological order in which the station's rebroadcast transmitters began operation. Some broadcasters may, at their discretion, use a system in which the number denotes the actual broadcast channel of the transmitter (e.g., CJOH-TV-47 in Pembroke). A broadcaster cannot, however, mix the two numbering systems under a single call sign – the transmitters are either \"all\" numbered sequentially or \"all\" numbered by their analogue channel position. On the rare occasion that the sequential numbering reaches 99 (e.g., TVOntario's former broadcast transmitters), rather than being numbered as 100 the next transmitter is assigned a new call sign and numbered as one. Translators which share the same frequency (such as CBLT's former repeaters CBLET, CBLHT, CBLAT-2 and CH4113, all on channel 12) are also given distinct call signs.\n\nDigital rebroadcasters may be numbered using the television channel number of the analogue signal which they replaced; TVOntario's CICO-DT-53 (digital UHF 26, Belleville) is one example (that station was converted in 2011 solely to vacate an out-of-core analogue channel, UHF 53, and retains CICO-TV-53's former analogue UHF television call sign numbering as one of the few surviving TVO repeaters).\n\nLow-power rebroadcasters may also have a call sign which consists of the letters \"CH\" followed by four numbers. For example, CH2649 in Valemount, British Columbia is a rebroadcaster of Vancouver's CHAN. Rebroadcasters of this type are numbered strictly sequentially to the order in which they were licensed by the CRTC, and their call signs have no inherent relationship to those of the parent stations or of other rebroadcasters. Although the next number in the sequence, CH2650 in Anzac, Alberta, is also a rebroadcaster of CHAN, this is simply because CH2649 and CH2650 happened to be licensed simultaneously – the following number, CH2651, is a rebroadcaster (also in Anzac) of Edmonton's CITV. A single station's rebroadcasters are not necessarily all named in the same manner. CBLT, for example, had some retransmitters which had their own call signs, some which used CBLT followed by a number \"and\" some transmitters with CH numbers.\n\nAll CBC and Radio-Canada owned-and-operated retransmitters were shut down permanently on August 1, 2012, along with most TVOntario transmitters (which often were located at Radio-Canada sites) and some Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN) transmitters in the far north. Private commercial broadcasters continue to operate some full-power rebroadcasters as a means of obtaining \"must carry\" status on cable television systems.\n\nTransmitters in small markets with one (or no) originating stations were in most cases not required to convert to digital, even if operating at full-power. Transmitters broadcasting on high-band UHF channels 52–69 were required to vacate those channels by August 31, 2011; some (such as a CKWS-TV retransmitter in Brighton, Ontario, and three of the TVOntario sites) did go digital as part of a move to a lower frequency but do not provide high-definition television service, extra digital subchannels or any functionality beyond that of the original analogue site.\n\nAs in television, a radio rebroadcaster may have either a distinct call sign or use the calls of the originating station followed by a numeric suffix. In the case of radio, however, the numeric suffix is always sequential.\n\nFor a rebroadcaster of an FM station, the numeric suffix is appended to the FM suffix. For example, rebroadcasters of CJBC-FM in Toronto are numbered CJBC-FM-1, CJBC-FM-2, etc. Where an AM station has a rebroadcaster operating on the FM band, the numeric suffix instead falls \"between\" the four-letter call sign and the FM suffix – for example, CKSB-1-FM is an FM rebroadcaster of the AM station CKSB, while CKSB-FM-1 would be a rebroadcaster of CKSB-FM.\n\nAs a broadcaster is limited to no more than two stations on one radio band in a market, one possible means to obtain a third FM signal in-market is to use a rebroadcaster of the AM station to move that signal onto low-power FM. In Sarnia, Blackburn Radio already owns CFGX-FM (99.9) and CHKS-FM (106.3); its third Sarnia station CHOK (1070) uses an FM repeater for in-city coverage as \"Country 103.9\" FM, although officially the AM signal remains the station's primary transmitter.\n\nLow-power radio rebroadcasters may also have a call sign which consists of the letters \"VF\" followed by four numbers; however, a call sign of this type may also denote a low-power station which originates its own programming and is not a rebroadcaster. Some stations licensed under the CRTC's experimental broadcasting guidelines, a special class of short-term license (similar to special temporary authority) sometimes granted to newer campus and community radio operations, may have another distinct class of call sign which consists of three letters from anywhere within Canada's ITU prefix range followed by three digits – e.g. CFU758 or VEK565. Some other stations within this license class, however, have been assigned conventional C\"xxx\" call signs.\n\nOccasionally, former rebroadcasters have been converted to originating stations in their own right, but have retained their former call sign instead of being reassigned a new one of their own. Such stations include CITE-FM-1 in Sherbrooke, CBF-FM-8 in Trois-Rivières and CBAF-FM-15 in Charlottetown.\n\nIn Mexico, translator and booster stations are given the call sign of the parent station.\n\nThe majority of television stations in Mexico are operated as repeaters of the networks they broadcast. Translator stations in the Mexico are given call signs which begin with XE and XH. Televisa and Azteca each maintain two networks with national reach. Televisa's Canal de las Estrellas network includes 128 separately licensed stations, the most in Mexico, while Azteca's networks incorporate 88 and 91 stations. These stations may have the capability to insert local advertising. Azteca's stations in larger cities may include local news and a limited amount of regional content; Televisa prefers to use its non-national Gala TV network and Televisa Regional stations as outlets for its local production. On top of the listed number of transmitters for each network, many have multiple translators of their own that serve areas with little or no signal within their defined coverage area, known as \"equipos complementarios de zona de sombra\" (). Most shadow channels air the same programming as their parent station, with several notable exceptions. The northern and central regional network Multimedios Televisión out of Monterrey uses the same sort of system to a smaller extent (its XHSAW-TDT serves in the shadow channel role to main station XHAW-TDT within Monterrey), but mainly offers regional outputs for local newscasts and advertising formed around a master schedule.\n\nThere are two main national networks of non-commercial television stations in Mexico. One is the Canal Once or XEIPN-TDT network run by the Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN). This operates 13 transmitters of its network and airs its programs on 4 more under a contract with the Quintana Roo state network. The other network, operated by the Sistema Público de Radiodifusión del Estado Mexicano (SPR), incorporates 26 stations (16 in operation), most of which are entirely digital. The SPR transmitters are located almost exclusively in cities where the IPN never built its own stations and carry Canal Once as one of the five educational networks in the multiplex of the digital station.\n\nAdditionally, 26 of Mexico's 32 states own and operate television services of their own. 16 of these incorporate more than one transmitter. The largest by number of stations is Telemax, the state network of Sonora, which operates 59 transmitters. Many transmitters in state networks broadcast at very low effective radiated powers (ERP).\n\nLastly, a small number of stations are owned by municipalities or translator associations. These are relatively uncommon, and like state networks, transmit at extremely low power.\n\nTransmitters rebroadcasting Mexico City stations into Baja California and other communities along the Pacific coast normally operate on a two-hour delay relative to the originating station; there is a one-hour delay in Sonora, and Quintana Roo (which as of 2015 is now one hour ahead of central Mexico) receives programs one hour later (but live) than they are broadcast to most of Mexico.\n\nWhile comparatively rare, a number of FM shadow channels also exist (approximately 10 to 15). These are required to be co-channel to the stations they retransmit.\n\nThe state with the most FM shadow channels is Quintana Roo, whose seven FM shadows represent about half of the national total. Three more FM shadows are authorized but not in this table: XETIA-FM/XEAD-FM Ajijic, Jal. and XHRRR-FM Tecolula, Ver.\n\nAs of July 2009, the basic Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations on translators are:\n\nThere is one loophole by which programming may differ between a main station and an FM translator: an HD Radio signal may contain digital subchannels with different programming from the main analogue channel, and a translator may operate in such a way as to broadcast programming taken from the originating station's HD2 subchannel as the translator's main analogue signal. W237DE (95.3, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) broadcasts the programming format formerly carried by WTCY (1400 AM, now WHGB), but it actually gets this signal from a WNNK (104.1 FM) HD2 digital subchannel for analogue rebroadcast at the WNNK tower site on 95.3's main signal. As such, it technically is still legally an FM repeater of an FM station, even though each signal would be heard as delivering unique content by users of standard analogue FM radio receivers.\n\nCommercial stations may own their translators or boosters when that translator or booster exists within the primary service contour of the parent station (they can only fill in where terrain blocks the signal). In fact, boosters may only be owned by the primary station. Translators outside of a primary station's service contour cannot be owned by the primary station, nor can they receive any financial support from the primary station. Most translators operate by picking-up the signal of the main station off the air with a directional antenna and sensitive receiver, and directly retransmitting the signal. They also may not transmit in the FM \"reserved band\" from 88 to 92 MHz, where only non-commercial stations are allowed. Non-commercial stations may broadcast in the commercial band, however. Unlike commercial stations, they can also relay programming to translators via satellite, so long as those translators are in the reserved band. Translators in the commercial band may only be fed by a direct off-the-air signal from another FM station or translator. Non-fill-in commercial band translators may not be fed by satellite, as spelled out in FCC rule 74.1231(b). All stations may use any means to feed boosters.\n\nAll U.S. translator and booster stations are low-power and have a class D license, making them secondary to other stations (including the parent). They must accept any interference from full-power (100-watt or more on FM) stations, while not causing any of their own. Boosters must not interfere with the parent station within the community of license. Licenses are automatically renewed with that of the parent station and do not require separate applications, though each may still be challenged with a petition to deny.\n\nFM booster stations are given the full call sign (always including an \"-FM\" suffix, even if there is none assigned) of the parent station, plus a serial number, such as WXYZ-FM1, WXYZ-FM2, etc.\n\nFM translator stations may use sequential numbered call signs, consisting of \"K\" or \"W\", followed by a three-digit number (201 through 300 corresponding to frequencies 88.1 to 107.9 MHz) followed by a pair of sequentially assigned letters. The format is similar to that used by numbered television translators, where the number refers to the permanent channel assignment.\n\nAs of October 2008, the largest terrestrial radio translator system in the U.S. belongs to KUER-FM, the non-commercial radio outlet of the University of Utah, with 33 translator stations ranging from Idaho to New Mexico and Arizona.\n\nUnlike FM, low-power television stations may operate as either translators or originate their own programming.\n\nTranslator stations in the U.S. are given call signs which begin with a \"W\" or \"K\" (respectively east or west of the Mississippi River, as with regular stations), followed by a channel number, and two serial letters for each channel (the first stations on that channel are AA, AB, AC, and so on). Television channels are always two-digit, from 02 to 51 (formerly 02 to 83); while FM radio channels are from 200 (87.9 MHz) to 300 (107.9 MHz), one every 0.2 MHz (for example, W42BD or K263AF). The presence of an X after the number in these call signs does not indicate an experimental broadcasting license as it may in other services, as all 26 letters are included in the sequence. The highest pair of letters used, , is ZS (K13ZS-D is a translator of KTSC in Sargents, Colorado).\n\nNumbered translator stations (a format such as \"W70ZZ\") are typically low-power repeaters, often 100 watts or less on FM, and 1,000 or less on television. The former \"translator band\", UHF television channels 70 through 83, was originally occupied primarily by these low-powered translators. The combination of low power and high frequencies provided a very limited range for these broadcasts. This band was reallocated to cellular telephone services in the 1980s, with the handful of remaining transmitters from these channels moved to lower frequencies.\n\nFull-power repeaters (such as WPBS-TV's identical twin transmitter WNPI-TV) are normally assigned \"-TV\" call signs like those of any other full-power station. These \"satellite stations\" do not bear numbered call signs and must operate in the same manner as other full-power broadcasters. This simulcasting is generally not regulated by the FCC, except where a station's owner seeks to be exempted from requirements such as restrictions on owning multiple full-service stations in the same market, limits on overlap in coverage area between commonly owned stations or requirements that each full-service station have a local studio and a skeleton staff capable of originating programming locally. These exemptions are normally justified on the basis of \"economic hardship\", where a heavily rural location unable to support a full-service originating station of its own may be able to sustain a full-power rebroadcaster. Some stations (such as KVRR in Fargo, North Dakota) are actually chains of as many as four full-power transmitters, each with its own call sign and license, covering a vast but sparsely populated region.\n\nLPTV stations may also choose a regular four-letter call sign with an \"-LP\" suffix (shared with low-power FM [LPFM]) for analog or \"-LD\" for digital, generally done only if the station originates programming. Class A television stations are assigned calls with \"-CA\" and \"-CD\" suffixes instead. Digital stations which use numerals get a \"-D\" suffix (as in W42BD-D). All of these are despite the fact most of the full-power digital television stations had their \"-DT\" (originally \"-HD\") suffixes dropped by the FCC before \"-D\" and \"-LD\" were implemented. Digital LPTV stations have their digital RF channel numbers as part of their digital call signs, which means it may be different from the virtual channel (the analog number).\n\nNumbered broadcast translators which are moved permanently to another frequency are normally issued new call signs to reflect the updated channel assignments. The same is not true of displaced translators using another frequency temporarily under special technical authority. For instance, K55KD could retain its call sign while displaced temporarily to channel 57 to resolve interference to MediaFLO users, while W81<nowiki>AA</nowiki> would have received new calls when channel 81 was deleted from the bandplan. On the rare occasion that a station moves back to its original channel, it is given its old call sign, as they are not reused by other stations like regular call signs can be.\n\nLow-power television stations are not required to simulcast a digital signal, nor were they required to shut down analog operation in June 2009 when full-power U.S. television stations had to do so.\n\nFull-power stations used for simulcasting another station were, like other full-service television broadcasters, required to convert fully to digital in June 2009. The FCC defines these \"TV satellite stations\" as \"full-power broadcast stations authorized under Part 73 of the Commission's rules to retransmit all or part of the programming of a parent station that is typically commonly owned.\" As most satellite stations operate in small or sparsely populated areas that have an insufficient economic base to support full-service operations, many were granted FCC authorization on a case-by-case basis to flash-cut from analog to digital on the same channel instead of simulcasting in both formats during the digital transition.\n\nWhile no current or future digital television mandates had been forced on existing low-power television stations, Congress passed legislation in 2008 funding low-power stations which went digital by the conversion date or shortly thereafter. Some low-power stations were forced to change frequency to accommodate full-power stations which moved to UHF or operated digital companion channels on UHF during the digital transition period.\n\nBy 2008, existing channel 55 licensees (both low-power and full-power) were being encouraged to relocate early to free spectrum for Qualcomm's (now-defunct) MediaFLO transmitters.\n\nBy 2011, any remaining LPTV broadcasters on UHF channels 52 through 69 were forced onto lower channels; in many cases, transmitters on the original UHF 70–83 translator band were forced to relocate twice (channels 70–83 were lost to mobile phones in 1983; followed by channels 52–69 between 2009 and 2011).\n\nMany low-power broadcast translators also were directly affected by a parent station's conversion to digital television. Translators which received an analog over-the-air signal from a full-service television station for rebroadcast needed to convert receiving equipment in much the same way that individual viewers needed to deploy digital converters. While the signal transmitted by the repeater may remain in analog format, the uplink had to be changed. In the United States, 23% of the 4,000 licensed translators have received a US$1000 federal government subsidy which covers a small portion of the cost of this additional equipment. Many other translators silently went dark after the digital transition deadline or did not apply for new channels after UHF channels 52–69 were removed from the bandplan.\n\nSome small translators operated by direct conversion of a parent station's signal to another frequency for rebroadcast, without any other local signal processing or demodulation. For example, W07BA, a 16-watt repeater for WSYR-TV in Syracuse, New York, was by design a very simple piece of broadcast apparatus; it merely shifted the main station's signal from channel nine to channel seven to cover a small valley in Dewitt. After digital transition, Syracuse became a UHF island and WSYR-TV's main ABC signal became a 100 kW digital broadcast on channel 17. Therefore, there is no longer a channel 9 signal in any format available to feed the tiny repeater. Translators in remote locations, where no commercial power is available, were also expected to have problems in deploying extra equipment to handle an uplink's digital conversion. While many translators continue analog broadcasts (and a minority transitioned to digital themselves), some distant rural communities expected to find all local translator signals gone as a result of originating stations' transition to digital.\n\nMany originating stations which were marginally available over-the-air as analog signals were irretrievably lost to digital conversion in certain locations (VHF Band I signals moving to UHF often losing the most range). This often meant that the parent station was no longer receivable over-the-air at the relay site. As an interim solution to this problem, communities that are permitted to do so by state and federal laws have chosen to purchase Ku-Band (Echostar, Hughes, etc.) or C-Band satellite receivers for their translator stations: the satellite input is simply rebroadcast as their analog translator output. Retransmitting the local channels from the satellite has the same problems as if the service area residents purchased individual service themselves: signal latency, atmospheric conditions (e.g.: torrential rain or snow accumulation on the receiving device), satellite equipment issues, etc.\n\nA digital-to-digital repeater or broadcast translator is possible; in North America, the ATSC specifications allow such repeaters to leave the virtual channel numbering and guide (Program and System Information Protocol [PSIP]) of the originating station unchanged, so that the rebroadcaster appears to the viewer as if it were on the same channel numbers as the original station. Some full-power television stations that have lost coverage after the digital transition have applied for digital replacement translators to fill in the gaps in some of the station's lost coverage. Those \"fill-in\" translators use the same call letters, suffix and facility IDs as their main full-power station.\n\nA few local translator districts (in which one municipal or county-level group had operated multiple low-power analog retransmitters fed from multiple distant stations) consolidated all programming on digital subchannels of a single digital television transmitter on a new channel. These rebroadcast stations insert PSIP virtual channel numbering and call signs locally.\n\nMost digital television sets and digital video recorders include analog and digital tuners, however most digital television set-top boxes fail to display analog stations or even to include analog passthrough for RF from the television antenna (the way a VCR does). This is an issue primarily with coupon-eligible converter boxes and caused grave concern among low-power television operators and border stations; the Community Broadcasters Association filed a lawsuit claiming it violated the All-Channel Receiver Act, the law on which the FCC based its digital mandate. However, in late 2008, 58% of approved coupon-eligible converter models were providing analog pass-through.\n\nUnder U.S. law, full-service local broadcasters are the primary occupants of the FM radio broadcast band. All LPFM operations, as well as all translators, are considered to be secondary in importance. In theory, this leaves low-power FM stations and broadcast translators with co-equal status on the FM band. In practice, as the FM broadcast band becomes more crowded, frequencies assigned to translators become unavailable to new LPFM stations or to existing LPFM stations seeking to upgrade their facilities.\n\nA few key distinctions often place small, local LPFM operators at a disadvantage:\n\nBroadcast translators for commercial stations are normally required to receive a signal from their parent full-service FM station over-the-air and retransmit solely within the region which should be covered by the main station (this eliminates the need for a translator except in cases where the terrain shielding is a problem). This same restriction does not apply to non-commercial educational stations. Any non-commercial station, even one with no local or educational content to offer, can apply for an unlimited number of translators anywhere to be fed by any means (including via satellite). The end result is a network of hundreds of small local transmitters, none of which broadcast (and none of which can lawfully broadcast) programming of interest to the local community. All take increasingly scarce available spectrum which otherwise could have been employed by local LPFM stations or used for rebroadcast of local full-service stations.\n\nAnother related issue involves the use of full-power stations to carry automated or satellite-originated programming. Any new full-service station can displace an existing low-power translator or an independent LPFM station; regulations allow this on the presumption that the full-service broadcaster would be more likely to provide a local voice to the community of license. Not all full-service broadcasters live up to this expectation. In some cases (such as the displacement of existing National Public Radio repeaters by newly created religious stations in Lake Charles, Louisiana) the result has been the loss of local or educational content. While an exactly opposite outcome to that which legislative intent had anticipated, often a small non-commercial educational translator was carrying content of higher quality than a satellite-fed full-power station for which it is displaced.\n\nAn FCC licensing window for new translator applications in 2003 resulted in over 13,000 applications being filed, most of them coming from religious broadcasters. Due to the extremely high volume of license applications, LPFM advocates describe this as the \"Great Translator Invasion\".\n\nA few broadcasters have taken advantage of FM translator regulations which allow non-commercial stations to feed distant translators from satellite-delivered programming hundreds or even thousands of miles outside the parent station's coverage area. However, it is a misconception that all translators can be fed by satellites. Only translators located on the non-commercial portion of the FM band (88.1 to 91.9 MHz) can be so-called \"satellators\". All other translators must be fed off the air by direct radio reception, except in the case of so-called \"fill-in\" facilities that exist within the service contour of a primary station. Translators may also be used to feed other translators, so it is possible to create small chains of translators all fed from one distant station, however, this only works until the chain is broken and, if any one translator fails, the entire network beyond the failed translator would go down. The high volume of application in 2003 overloaded the FCC which issued an emergency hold order on new translator applications until those which had been received were processed; this came after considerable criticism from LPFM lobbyist groups such as Prometheus Radio. These translator applications were all on the commercial band and none of them could be used as satellators. It is unknown how the one broadcast group with the most applications planned to deliver programming to all of the translators, but affiliated churches of the parent organization own broadcasting outlets in many of the cities.\n\nSome religious broadcasting outlets – such as Calvary Chapel's KAWZ Twin Falls, Idaho; Educational Media Foundation; or Family Radio's KEBR Sacramento – are relayed by hundreds of FM \"translator\" stations across the U.S. As these parent stations are owned by non-profit organizations and they exist on the non-commercial part of the spectrum, they are not required to have their translators receive their signal over the air, as would be required for a commercial broadcaster. This has been used by a number of religious broadcasters to set up large satellite-based networks composed almost entirely of \"distant translators\" – translators outside of the market area (generally a 50-mile radius surrounding the transmitter).\n\nSome LPFM advocates erroneously state that the proliferation of translators has posed difficulties for non-translator station operators, in particular LPFM license applicants who claim that they cannot get stations on the air due to translators eliminating any available channels in an area. While this may be true for future LPFM applications, it is not true for any existing LPFM broadcasters or LPFM applicants. This is because the last LPFM filing window was in 2001. All translator applications from the 2003 window were required to protect the LPFM applications already pending or authorized at that time. As a result, no LPFM station was denied due to translators.\n\nSince so-called sat-casting translators are only permitted on the non-commercial part of the spectrum, where LPFM stations do not exist, they pose no threat to the ability of existing LPFM licensees to expand their current station facilities. Non-sat-casting translators may present a problem for existing LPFM stations: if the LPFM station is \"bumped\" from its existing channel by a new full-power station, there may be no available frequency to which to move. The FCC has, generally, not required LPFM stations to be displaced by full power stations. In such cases, the LPFM may be subject to increased interference from the full-powered move-in, but the FCC has adopted a \"live and let live\" policy that has been used to keep existing LPFM stations operating.\n\nThere is at least one proposed rulemaking that would revise the procedures by which nonprofit groups may apply for translators (thus disallowing more than a certain number of translator applications to be owned by any one entity); in addition, the FCC has modified channel requirements for LPFM broadcasters to open channel space. REC Networks has filed a petition with the FCC that would, among other things, require the FCC to give higher priority to LPFM stations.\n\nAreas with no available FM spectrum for LPFM stations due to large distant translator networks include Chicago (with several Calvary Chapel and Educational Media Foundation stations), Atlanta (with several Way-FM – associated with K-Love and Salem Communications – and Edgewater Broadcasting stations) and Dallas, Texas, (with Calvary Satellite Network and American Family Radio). Even smaller markets like Louisville, Kentucky, and Knoxville, Tennessee, have a complete lack of LPFM channels due to distant translator invasion by broadcasters such as Calvary Chapel and Way-FM.\n\nThe largest satellite-fed translator networks are endeavors linked to Calvary Chapel (including Radio Assist Ministry, Horizon Broadcasting, and (formerly) Edgewater Broadcasting and REACH Media) and American Family Radio owned by the American Family Association. The multiple networks associated with Calvary Chapel have been a particular focus in regard to translator-based networks. In many cases, multiple applications were submitted by different companies linked to Calvary Chapel in particular for the same channel. At least four separate radio stations operated by Calvary Chapel churches and relaying Calvary Satellite Network programming have been identified as \"home stations\" for distant translators and there are many home churches in addition to the main \"national\" Calvary Chapel concerns applying for licenses.\n\nIn the case of American Family Radio in particular, there are indications of a deliberate strategy to crowd out rebroadcasters of National Public Radio stations for political purposes.\n\nEducational Media Foundation, owners of the K-Love contemporary Christian music radio network, have also been cited as applying for distant translators \"en masse\". \n\n, the FCC officially sanctioned the use of FM translators for cross-band carriage of AM signals. Although some feel that this poses a threat to LPFM stations, the FCC did not authorize the use of any new FM translators for this purpose and limited cross-band translation to existing translators that had already been authorized as of May 2009. Since no new translators were authorized, there is no increased threat to LPFMs from cross-band translation services. The FCC also allows translation of HD Radio digital-only channels as inputs for analog FM-only output.\n\nSome groups have sold their translator construction permits for a large profit; this is most obvious with the Educational Media Foundation, which has traded both translators and desired call signs with iHeartMedia (mainly involving various forms of \"LV\", \"KLV\" or \"LVE\", as was done with WLVE) in exchange for HD carriage on iHeart stations of K-LOVE and Air1. Other licensees have sold their translator stations for large amounts of money – sometimes tens of thousands of dollars or more, and many times what it costs to build one.\n\nAustralia's national radio networks (Radio National, ABC NewsRadio, Triple J, ABC Classic FM and SBS Radio) each have relay transmitters which allow each service to be broadcast as widely as possible. In order to provide this, the ABC and SBS both allow community-based relay transmitters to rebroadcast radio or television in areas which would otherwise have no service. Commercial radio broadcasters normally have relay transmitters only if the local geography (such as mountainous terrain) prevents them from broadcasting to their entire market.\n\nSince market aggregation in the early 1990s, each television broadcaster transmits its service using multiple relays in order provide the same service throughout Australia's large market areas. While each market is often divided into submarkets due to the legacy of previous commercial broadcasts (for example, Southern Cross Nine maintains two separate stations in the single Victoria market, GLV and BCV), the only difference between these submarkets in practice is limited to news services or local advertising. Except in major cities, all major television broadcasters use the same network of transmitters, which may have dozens of relay stations in each market. As a result, some areas have had trouble starting digital or HD services due to problems with certain regional transmitters.\n\nBecause most radio and television systems in Europe are national networks, the entire radio or television system in some countries can be considered a collection of relay stations, in which each broadcaster uses a transmitter network (either developed by the public broadcaster or maintained through a government-funded authority) to provide broadcast services to the entire nation.\n\nIn most parts of Asia, satellite is the preferred method of getting national signal coverage in most countries (notable exceptions include Singapore, which outright bans civilian ownership of satellite receivers, and Malaysia, which only allows civilian ownership of receivers provided by Astro). However, terrestrial-wise, the scenario is much like that of Europe – the systems are considered national networks and comprise a collection of relay stations, maintained by a government-funded authority. This is not the case in Japan, where television stations are either owned-and-operated by the networks or are affiliates owned by other media companies.\n\n"}
{"id": "54275492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54275492", "title": "Carpenter v. United States", "text": "Carpenter v. United States\n\nCarpenter v. United States, , was a landmark United States Supreme Court case concerning the privacy of historical cellphone location records. The Court held, in a 5–4 decision authored by Chief Justice Roberts, that the government violates the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution by accessing historical records containing the physical locations of cellphones without a search warrant.\n\nPrior to \"Carpenter\", government entities could obtain cellphone location records by claiming the information was required as part of an investigation. After \"Carpenter\", government entities must obtain a warrant in order to access the information. The decision overturned portions of 20th century legislation and case law when nearly all US homes had landline phones in favor of constitutional rights stemming from technological advances of cellphones in the early 21st century. The ruling was very narrow and did not otherwise change the third-party doctrine related to other business records that might incidentally reveal location information, nor overrule prior decisions concerning conventional surveillance techniques and tools such as security cameras. The Court did not expand its ruling on other matters related to cellphones not presented in \"Carpenter\", including real-time cell site location information (CSLI) or \"tower dumps\" (a download of information about all the devices that connected to a particular cell site during a particular interval). The opinion also did not consider other collection techniques involving foreign affairs or national security.\n\nThird-party wireless service providers (such as AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon) are able to find the location of cell phones through either global positioning system (GPS) data or cell site location information (CSLI). CSLI is cell phone information captured by nearby cell towers; and this information is able to triangulate, or pinpoint, the location of cell phones. Third-party service providers capture and store this data for business purposes, such as troubleshooting, maximizing network efficiencies and to determining whether to charge customers roaming fees for particular calls. The data can also provide the historical movements of a cellphone. Thus, anyone with access to this data has the ability to know where the phone has been and what other cell phones were in the same area at a given time. Assuming cell phone owners travel with their cellphones, this data can theoretically provide every place a person has traveled and nearly everyone the person met.\n\nIn \"Carpenter\", the Supreme Court determined what type of legal authorization is required by a government entity in order to compel third-party wireless service providers to turn over historical records containing the physical locations of cellphones. Attorneys for Carpenter argued that the authorization should be a search warrant. Attorneys for the United States argued that the authorization should be a court order for disclosure. Requirements to obtain an \"order for disclosure\" are less stringent than the requirements to obtain a warrant. \n\nPrior to \"Carpenter\", the Supreme Court consistently held that a person had no legitimate expectation of privacy in regards to information voluntarily turned over to third parties, and therefore a search warrant was not required to obtain this information. This legal theory is known as the third-party doctrine, established by the Supreme Court cases \"United States v. Miller\" (1976), which determined that bank records were not subject to expectation of privacy, and \"Smith v. Maryland\" (1979), which determined the rights of individuals with regards to phone communications \n\nIn particular, \"Smith\" was a landmark decision by the Court and has guided the federal courts ever since on questions related to privacy and phones. The Court held in \"Smith\" that the government may not eavesdrop on a phone call, even a one placed from a public phone booth; however, the phone numbers the person dialed on his phone could be obtained without a warrant. The Court also determined that the Fourth Amendment does not protect the public from allowing the government to obtain the information necessary to get communications from point A to point B. For example, without a warrant the government could obtain from a letter or package the sender, receiver, originating and delivery addresses, package size, and weight; however, the government was required to obtain a warrant before opening the package or letter to obtain its contents.\n\nIn 1986, the United States Congress passed the Stored Communications Act (codified at 18 USC Chapter 121 §§ 2701–2712), which governs the privacy of stored Internet communications in the United States. The Act protects the personal information that is stored by certain providers, such as electronic communication and remote computing service providers. It prohibits these service providers \"from knowingly disclosing the contents of customers’ electronic communications or subscriber records,\", but \"a provider is required to disclose the information to a U.S. government agent or agency,\" if they obtain a warrant first. Section 2703 (18 USC § 2703) provides the rules that the government must follow in order to compel a third-party service provider to disclose \"customer or subscriber\" content and non-content information. Prior to passage of the Stored Communications Act, many courts were reluctant to issue orders for disclosure that allowed the government to obtain data held by third parties; but section (d) of this act required a judge to issue a court order for disclosure whenever the federal government showed that the requested information was relevant to a criminal investigation.\n\nIn the 2010’s, cellphones, particularly smartphones, had become an important instrument for nearly every person in the United States. By 2016, over 95% of Americans owned a cellphone. Many applications, such as GPS navigation and location tools, required the cellphone to send and receive information constantly, including the exact location of the cellphone. \nAs technology advanced in the 21st Century, the Court began to back away from its 20th Century third-party doctrine. In 2014, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in \"Riley v. California\" that the warrantless search and seizure of digital contents of a cellphone during an arrest is unconstitutional. In its decision, the Court recognized that the public's adoption of cellphones, combined with their capacity to hold vast quantities of detailed personal information, makes them vastly different from the old analog phones.\n\nIn 2012, the Court ruled in \"United States v. Jones\" that the government is prohibited from entering private property to attach a GPS tracker to a suspect’s car without a valid warrant. Foreshadowing \"Carpenter\", Justice Sotomayor used her concurrence in \"Jones\" to express her discomfort with the third-party doctrine:\n\nMore fundamentally, it may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties. This approach is ill suited to the digital age, in which people reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks.\n\nBetween December 2010 and March 2011, several individuals in the Detroit, Michigan, area conspired and participated in armed robberies at RadioShack and T-Mobile stores in Michigan and Ohio. When the robbers entered the store, they brandished their guns, ordered customers and employees to the back of the store, and told the employees to fill their bags with new smartphones.\n\nIn April 2011, four of the robbers were captured and arrested. (The petitioner, Timothy Carpenter, was not among the group of arrestees.) One of those arrested confessed and turned over his phone so that FBI agents could review the calls made from his phone around the time of the robberies. Soon afterwards, a magistrate judge, in accordance with the Stored Communications Act, granted the FBI's request to obtain \"transactional records\" from various wireless carriers for 16 different phone numbers for \"[a]ll subscriber information, toll records and call detail records including listed and unlisted numbers dialed or otherwise transmitted to and from [the] target telephones... as well as cell site information for the target telephones at call origination and at call termination for incoming and outgoing calls[.]\" The government was able to obtain a court order before gaining access to the information; prosecutors only had to show that they were seeking evidence relevant to a criminal investigation. Getting a search warrant requires the government to prove probable cause which is harder to obtain because it requires more specific information. The 16 different phone numbers called or received by the confessed robber around the time of the robberies were not sufficient evidence to establish probable cause; however, it was sufficient evidence under the Stored Communications Act, which requires only \"that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.\"\n\nFrom the historical cell-site records, the government was able to determine that Carpenter's cellphone communicated with cell towers at the time and from this information, the government was able to determine that Carpenter was within a two-mile radius of four robberies. Using this information, the government charged and arrested Carpenter. A jury later convicted Carpenter on several counts of aiding and abetting a robbery that affected interstate commerce and another count of aiding and abetting the use or carriage of a firearm during a federal crime of violence. Carpenter was sentenced by Judge Sean Cox of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan to 1395 months, or 116.25 years, in federal prison.\n\nCarpenter appealed his conviction and sentence to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. A three-judge panel heard the case on October 14, 2015. On April 13, 2016, Judge Raymond Kethledge delivered the opinion of the Court, affirming Carpenter's conviction and sentence.\n\nThe Sixth Circuit relied on the Supreme Court's guidance from the Supreme Court's 1979 decision in \"Smith v. Maryland\" to clarify that only the content of a person's communication is protected by the Fourth Amendment. The Court explained that \"cell-site data — like mailing addresses, phone numbers, and IP addresses — are information that facilitate personal communications, rather than part of the content of those communications themselves.\" Furthermore, the Court determined that the government obtained information from not Carpenter but the service provider's business records. Therefore, the government's collection of the service provider's business records did not constitute a \"search\" of Carpenter under the Fourth Amendment and so did not require a warrant.\n\nJudge Jane Branstetter Stranch dissented from the majority's conclusion that the collection of the service provider's business records did not constitute a search. In her dissent, Judge Stranch states, \"this case involves tracking physical location through cell towers and a personal phone, a device routinely carried on the individual's person; it also involves the compelled provision of records that reflect such tracking. In light of the personal tracking concerns articulated in our precedent, I am not convinced that the situation before us can be addressed appropriately with a test primarily used to obtain business records such as credit card purchases — records that do not necessarily reflect personal location. And it seems to me that the business records test is ill suited to address the issues regarding personal location that are before us.\"\n\nCarpenter petitioned for a writ of certiorari on September 26, 2016. On June 5, 2017, the Supreme Court agreed to review the case when it granted Carpenter's petition for writ of certiorari. Twenty amicus curiae briefs were filed by organizations, scholars, and corporations in this case. The Supreme Court heard Oral arguments on November 29, 2017. Nathan Freed Wessler, a staff attorney with the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, argued on behalf of Carpenter. Michael Dreeben, the Deputy Solicitor General in charge of the US Department of Justice criminal docket before the Supreme Court, argued on behalf of the United States.\nWhile the Court reviewed the case, some considered \"Carpenter\" to be the most important Fourth Amendment case before the Supreme Court in a generation.\n\nThe Court issued its decision on June 22, 2018, with the court split 5–4. Chief Justice Roberts wrote the majority opinion. Associate Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan joined Roberts' opinion. The majority determined that the third-party doctrine applied to telephone communications in \"Smith v. Maryland\" could not be applied to cellphone technology and ruled that the government must obtain a warrant in order to access historical cellphone records. Roberts argued that technology \"has afforded law enforcement a powerful new tool to carry out its important responsibilities. At the same time, this tool risks Government encroachment of the sort the Framers [of the US Constitution], after consulting the lessons of history, drafted the Fourth Amendment to prevent.\" The majority adds,\n\n[S]eismic shifts in digital technology [] made possible the tracking of not only Carpenter’s location but also everyone else’s, not for a short period but for years and years. Sprint Corporation and its competitors are not your typical witnesses. Unlike the nosy neighbor who keeps an eye on comings and goings, they are ever alert, and their memory is nearly infallible. There is a world of difference between the limited types of personal information addressed in \"Smith\" and \"Miller\" and the exhaustive chronicle of location information casually collected by wireless carriers today.\n\nRoberts's opinion reasoned that the \"detailed, encyclopedic, and effortlessly compiled\" data used in tracking of a person by cell towers was qualitatively similar to that of using a Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking device as determined by \"Jones\". Roberts stressed that the decision is a very narrow ruling; it does not affect other parts of the third-party doctrine, such as banking records, nor does it prevent collection of cell tower data without a warrant in emergencies or for national security issues.\n\nJustices Kennedy, Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch each wrote dissenting opinions. Kennedy's dissent cautioned against the limitation on law enforcement, writing, \n\nThis case involves new technology, but the Court’s stark departure from relevant Fourth Amendment precedents and principles is, in my submission, unnecessary and incorrect, requiring this respectful dissent. The new rule the Court seems to formulate puts needed, reasonable, accepted, lawful, and congressionally authorized criminal investigations at serious risk in serious cases, often when law enforcement seeks to prevent the threat of violent crimes. And it places undue restrictions on the lawful and necessary enforcement powers exercised not only by the Federal Government, but also by law enforcement in every State and locality throughout the Nation. Adherence to this Court’s longstanding precedents and analytic framework would have been the proper and prudent way to resolve this case.\n\nAlito wrote in his dissent,\n\nI share the Court’s concern about the effect of new technology on personal privacy, but I fear that today’s decision will do far more harm than good. The Court’s reasoning fractures two fundamental pillars of Fourth Amendment law, and in doing so, it guarantees a blizzard of litigation while threatening many legitimate and valuable investigative practices upon which law enforcement has rightfully come to rely.\n\nAlthough Gorsuch also wrote a dissent, his opinion is similar to a concurring opinion because he agreed with the majority’s decision but disagreed with the majority’s reasoning. Gorsuch agreed that law enforcement agencies need a warrant to obtain cell phone data; however, he disagreed that the Fourth Amendment provides the right to a \"reasonable expectation of privacy.\" Instead, Gorsuch argues that cell phone location records are the property of cell phone owners, and, under the Fourth Amendment, law enforcement agencies cannot search a person’s property without a warrant. \nIn 1967, the Supreme Court first suggested in \"Katz v. United States\" that the Fourth Amendment provides the right to a \"reasonable expectation of privacy.\" Gorsuch believes \"Katz\" was incorrectly decided because the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment does not provide for a \"reasonable expectation of privacy.\" Instead, Gorsuch writes that the Fourth Amendment \"grants you the right to invoke its guarantees whenever one of your protected things (your person, your house, your papers, or your effects) is unreasonably searched or seized. Period.\" Thus, he argues that historical cell record data is the property of cell phone owners and cannot be searched without a warrant. Gorsuch also advocates that the Court should overturn the \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" doctrine suggested in \"Katz\", as well as the \"third-party doctrine\" established in \"Smith\" and \"Miller\" because they are not consistent with the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment and lead to confusion and inconsistencies in the lower courts.\n\n\n\n"}

This conceit is seen, and sometimes exploited for plot purposes, in such films as \"Over the Hedge\", the \"Balto\" series, and \"Brother Bear\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12885832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12885832", "title": "Chrome Dreams II", "text": "Chrome Dreams II\n\nChrome Dreams II is the 28th studio album by Canadian musician Neil Young. The album was released on October 23, 2007 as a double LP and as a single CD. The album is a sequel to \"Chrome Dreams\", a legendary Neil Young album from 1977 that had originally been scheduled for release but was shelved in favor of \"American Stars 'N Bars\".\n\nThe album debuted on the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200 chart at number 11, selling about 54,000 copies in its first week. In addition, the song \"No Hidden Path\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance at the 51st Grammy Awards, 2009.\n\n\"Chrome Dreams II\" was produced by The Volume Dealers (Neil Young & Niko Bolas), and features the ensemble of Crazy Horse drummer Ralph Molina, pedal steel guitarist and dobro player Ben Keith (\"Harvest\", \"Comes A Time\", \"Harvest Moon\") and bassist Rick Rosas (\"Freedom\", \"Living With War\", \"This Note's for You\"). A horn section, The Blue Note Horns, appear on one track, \"Ordinary People,\" while the Young People’s Chorus of New York City appear on \"The Way.\" Most of the recording was done live with few overdubs at Feelgood's Garage studio near Redwood City, California, with two vintage gas pumps out front and vintage studio gear inside.\n\nAccording to Young, \n\nIt's an album with a form based on some of my original recordings, with a large variety of songs, rather than one specific type of song. Where \"Living with War\" and \"Everybody's Rockin'\" were albums focused on one subject or style, \"Chrome Dreams II\" is more like \"After the Gold Rush\" or \"Freedom\", with different types of songs working together to form a feeling. Now that radio formats are not as influential as they once were, it's easier to release an album that crosses all formats with a message that runs through the whole thing, regardless of the type of song or sound. Some early listeners have said that this album is positive and spiritual. I like to think it focuses on the human condition. Like many of my recordings, this one draws on earlier material here and there. I used to do that a lot back in the day. Some songs, like 'Ordinary People,' need to wait for the right time. I think now is the right time for that song and it lives well with the new songs I have written in the past few months. I had a blast making this music. \n\nThe first three songs of \"Chrome Dreams II\" date from the 1980s. \"Beautiful Bluebird\" was first recorded for the original version of \"Old Ways\" that was shelved by Geffen Records; \"Boxcar\" was a track on the unreleased \"Times Square\" album, which was scrapped in favor of the more commercially viable \"Freedom\"; and \"Ordinary People,\" which was recorded in summer 1988 for what became the \"Freedom\" album, was highly regarded as one of Young's greatest unreleased songs, and was often played live during the \"Sponsored By Nobody\" tour with The Bluenotes to promote the album. This was the album's first single, and was sent to radio on Monday, September 10. The length of this track (clocking in at 18:13) makes it hard to program into today's limited radio playlists, so it was initially heard on radio web sites.\n\n\n\n\nThe Young People’s Chorus of New York City\n\n\n"}

{"id": "46754025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46754025", "title": "DC Extended Universe", "text": "DC Extended Universe\n\nThe DC Extended Universe (DCEU) is a term used to refer to an American media franchise and shared universe that is centered on a series of superhero films, distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures and based on characters that appear in American comic books by DC Comics. The shared universe, much like the original DC Universe in comic books and the television programs, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. The films have been in production since 2011 and in that time Warner Bros. has distributed five films. The series has grossed over $3.7 billion at the global box office, currently making it the fourteenth highest-grossing film franchise.\n\nThe films are written and directed by a variety of individuals and feature large, often ensemble, casts. Several actors, including Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, and Ray Fisher, have appeared in numerous films of the franchise, with continued appearances in sequels planned. In May 2016, DC's chief creative officer Geoff Johns and Warner Bros. executive vice president Jon Berg were appointed to co-run the DC Films division and oversee creative decisions, production and story-arcs in order to create a cohesive overarching plot within the films. In January 2018, Walter Hamada was appointed the president of DC Films, replacing Berg.\n\nThe first film in the DCEU was \"Man of Steel\" (2013) followed by \"\" (2016), \"Suicide Squad\" (2016), \"Wonder Woman\" (2017), \"Justice League\" (2017), and \"Aquaman\" (2018). The franchise will continue with scheduled release dates for \"Shazam!\" in 2019, as well as \"Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn)\" and \"Wonder Woman 1984\" scheduled for release in 2020. A multitude of other projects are in various stages of development.\n\nIn 2002, Wolfgang Petersen was set to direct a \"Batman vs. Superman\" film from a script by Akiva Goldsman. Warner Bros. canceled development to focus on individual Superman and Batman projects after J. J. Abrams submitted another draft for \"Superman: Flyby\". In February 2007, Warner Bros. hired husband and wife duo Michele and Kieran Mulroney to write a script for a \"Justice League\" film. Christian Bale, who starred as Batman in \"Batman Begins\" (2005), was not approached to reprise the role, nor was Brandon Routh, who starred as Superman in \"Superman Returns\" (2006). George Miller was hired to direct the film, reportedly titled \"Justice League Mortal\", with Armie Hammer cast as Batman, D. J. Cotrona as Superman, Adam Brody as Flash, Santiago Cabrera as Aquaman, Common as Green Lantern, Megan Gale as Wonder Woman, Hugh Keays-Byrne as Martian Manhunter and Jay Baruchel as Maxwell Lord. The project was put on indefinite hold in January 2008, after failing to secure tax breaks for filming in Australia, as well as the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike preventing progress on the script.\n\nIn 2013, a reboot of the \"Superman\" franchise, \"Man of Steel\", was set to lay the groundwork for future DC films. The film contained references to other characters in the DC Universe, so if it were a success, it could launch a shared universe. Days before \"Man of Steel\"s release in June, it was reported that director Zack Snyder and screenwriter David S. Goyer would be returning for a sequel, which was being fast-tracked by Warner Bros. In July, at San Diego Comic-Con, it was revealed that the sequel would include Batman in a main role, thus establishing the shared universe. In October 2014, Warner Bros. announced a slate of ten DC films.\n\nWhile the rival Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) includes television productions, the DC's new crossover film series is a shared continuity for films. Several television series featuring DC characters and storylines have their own shared continuity, frequently referred to as the Arrowverse. DC's chief creative officer Geoff Johns explained DC's difference in approach to Marvel Studios and their cinematic universe, saying, \"We look at it as the multiverse. We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist. For us, creatively, it’s about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world. Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through ... It's just a different approach.\" In June 2015, Warner Bros. president of creative development Greg Silverman expanded on DC's approach to their cinematic universe, saying, \"We ... take these beloved characters and put them in the hands of master filmmakers and make sure they all coordinate with each other. You'll see the difference when you see ... the things that we are working on.\"\n\nIn May 2016, following criticism of \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\", Warner Bros. established a DC Films division with Geoff Johns and Warner Bros. executive vice president Jon Berg as its heads, which oversees production to form a cohesive creative direction for the franchise. DC Films will not be fully autonomous, with Johns reporting to DC president Diane Nelson and Berg reporting to Silverman. Charles Roven was also moved from his day-by-day producer role on future DC films, which he had served since 2005's \"Batman Begins\", to an administrative executive producer role. In December, Silverman was ousted from his role in Warner Bros., and Toby Emmerich was promoted to president and chief content officer, in his place. By January 2017, Johns and Berg reported to Emmerich. Following the financial and critical success of \"Wonder Woman\" in June 2017, Johns stated that moving forward the films will focus on the heart, humor, hope, heroics, and optimism of the characters. DC also decided to begin deemphasizing the shared nature of their films, with Diane Nelson stating, \"Our intention, certainly, moving forward is using the continuity to help make sure nothing is diverging in a way that doesn't make sense, but there's no insistence upon an overall story line or interconnectivity in that universe... Moving forward, you'll see the DC movie universe being a universe, but one that comes from the heart of the filmmaker who's creating them.\" As a result of \"Justice League\"'s underperformance at the box office, Berg left his position by January 2018 and became a production partner with Roy Lee.\n\nIn January 2018, Walter Hamada was appointed the President of DC Films and the new co-runner of the DCEU, replacing Berg. The following month, Chantal Nong was hired as Vice President of the film studio, additionally overseeing the production of the franchise. The pair were hired to oversee the future of the franchise with Johns, as the key production team managers. However, in June of the same year, Johns stepped down from his role as co-head of DC Films and co-runner of the DCEU. He will remain with the studio as co-chairman, while starting his own studio where he will take on a greater hands-on role with film media as a producer and screenwriter. His production company, Mad Ghost Productions, will produce future films in the franchise, as well as comic book and television media.\n\nKal-El / Clark Kent, who arrived on Earth years ago as an infant from Krypton, struggles with why he was sent to Earth. Raised by his adoptive parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent, Clark adopts the persona \"Superman\", and learns if his abilities are meant to maintain peace or conquer the world.\n\nDuring story discussions for \"The Dark Knight Rises\", David S. Goyer told Christopher Nolan his idea regarding how to present Superman in a modern context. Impressed with Goyer's concept, Nolan pitched the idea to the studio, who hired Nolan to produce and Goyer to write based on the financial and critical success of \"The Dark Knight\". Zack Snyder was hired in October 2010 to direct the film. In January 2011, Henry Cavill was cast as Clark Kent / Superman. Other cast members included Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Michael Shannon as the villain General Zod, Diane Lane as Martha Kent, Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent, Russell Crowe as Jor-El, and Laurence Fishburne as Perry White. Principal photography began on August 1, 2011. \"Man of Steel\" released in North America on June 14, 2013.\n\nGotham City-based vigilante Batman travels to Metropolis to preemptively combat Superman, fearing what would happen if the latter is kept unchecked, while another threat endangers humankind.\n\nIn June 2013, it was reported that Snyder and Goyer would be returning for a sequel to \"Man of Steel\", which was being fast-tracked by Warner Bros. Nolan was involved in an advisory role as executive producer. In July, at the San Diego Comic-Con, Warner Bros. announced that Superman and Batman would meet for the first time in a cinematic format in the film, which would be the follow-up to \"Man of Steel\" and a reboot of the \"Batman\" film series. According to Snyder, the film took inspiration from the comic \"The Dark Knight Returns\". Cavill, Adams, Lane, and Fishburne reprised their roles. In August, Ben Affleck was cast as Bruce Wayne / Batman. In December, Gal Gadot was cast as Diana Prince / Wonder Woman, marking the character's first appearance in a live-action theatrical film. Later in the month, Chris Terrio was hired to rewrite Goyer's script. In January 2014, the film was delayed from its July 17, 2015, release date to May 6, 2016, to give the filmmakers \"time to realize fully their vision, given the complex visual nature of the story\". Later that month, Jesse Eisenberg and Jeremy Irons joined the cast as Lex Luthor and Alfred Pennyworth, respectively. In May 2014, the film's title was revealed to be \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\". Initial filming occurred on October 19, 2013, at East Los Angeles College, before full principal photography began on May 21, 2014, in Detroit. Production also took place in Illinois, New Mexico, Africa and the South Pacific. After another date change, the film was released in North America on March 25, 2016.\n\nThe film is set 18 months after the events of \"Man of Steel\". \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\" introduced Ezra Miller as Barry Allen / The Flash, Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry / Aquaman, Ray Fisher as Victor Stone / Cyborg, and Joe Morton as Dr. Silas Stone. The film also introduced Steppenwolf, who served as the main antagonist in \"Justice League\", through a brief scene. The scene was not included in the film's theatrical release, but instead was revealed online by Warner Bros. on March 28, before being included in the \"Ultimate Edition\" home video release.\nAfter the death of Superman, a secret government agency recruits imprisoned supervillains to execute dangerous black ops missions and rescue the world from a powerful threat, in exchange for clemency.\n\nIn February 2009, prior to the development of the DCEU, Warner Bros. was developing a Suicide Squad film, with Dan Lin producing and Justin Marks writing the script. In October 2014, \"Suicide Squad\" was announced by Warner Bros., with David Ayer confirmed as director. In December, it was revealed that Ayer would also be writing the screenplay. The main cast included Will Smith as Deadshot, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Jared Leto as the Joker, Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang, Jay Hernandez as El Diablo, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Killer Croc, Karen Fukuhara as Katana, Cara Delevingne as Enchantress, Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, and Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag. Tom Hardy was originally cast as Rick Flag, but dropped out due to scheduling issues with his film \"The Revenant\". Principal photography commenced April 13, 2015, and took place in and around Toronto. Filming concluded August 28, 2015. \"Suicide Squad\" was released in North America on August 5, 2016.\n\nThe film is set after the events of \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\". Affleck as Bruce Wayne / Batman and Miller as Barry Allen / The Flash made appearances in the film. In a mid-credits scene, Waller meets Wayne in a restaurant and hands him a dossier containing information on future members of the Justice League.\nDiana of Themyscira, an Amazon warrior who also is the demigoddess daughter of the god Zeus, uses her talents and abilities in order to help humanity during World War I.\n\nIsraeli actress and model Gal Gadot was cast as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman in December 2013 and signed a three-picture deal which included a solo film. In October 2014, \"Wonder Woman\" was announced by Warner Bros. In November, Michelle MacLaren was confirmed to direct the film from a screenplay by Jason Fuchs. In April 2015, MacLaren left the project due to creative differences. Later that month, Patty Jenkins was announced as the new director of the film. In July, Chris Pine was cast as Steve Trevor. Other cast members include Connie Nielsen as Queen Hippolyta, Robin Wright as General Antiope, Danny Huston as Erich Ludendorff, Elena Anaya as Doctor Poison, and David Thewlis as Ares. Filming began in November 2015, and was shot in the United Kingdom, France and Italy. \"Wonder Woman\" was released in North America on June 2, 2017.\n\nMotivated by at the hands of Doomsday, Batman and Wonder Woman assemble a team of metahumans to face a new catastrophic threat.\n\nIn June 2013, it was reported that Goyer would be writing \"Justice League\" as part of a three-film deal he signed for \"Man of Steel\". In April 2014, it was announced that Snyder would return as director. The film was announced in October as \"Justice League Part One\". In March 2016, it was confirmed that Chris Terrio had written the script, who said that the film would not be as tonally dark as \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\". In June, Geoff Johns announced that the title had been changed to simply \"Justice League\". Affleck, Cavill, Gadot, Momoa, Miller, Fisher, Irons, Lane, Adams, Eisenberg, Nielsen, Wright, and Morton reprised their respective roles from previous films. Ciarán Hinds provides the voice and performance capture for the villain Steppenwolf. Beginning on April 11, 2016, filming took place at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, in England, as well as locations around London and in Iceland. Filming concluded in October 2016. In May 2017, Snyder stepped down from his duties on the film due to his daughter's death; Joss Whedon filled his position on post-production, with additional scenes being written and directed by him. Though Whedon was not officially credited for his role as post-production director, he completed enough additional work for a screenwriting credit on the film. \"Justice League\" was released worldwide on November 17, 2017.\n\n\"Justice League\" introduced various characters, including J. K. Simmons as James Gordon, Amber Heard as Mera, and Billy Crudup as Henry Allen; both Kiersey Clemons as Iris West and Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko were to be introduced but their scenes were ultimately cut from the film. Joe Manganiello as Slade Wilson / Deathstroke was also introduced in a post-credits scene, teasing an alliance between him and Lex Luthor.\n\nFollowing the events of \"Justice League\", Arthur Curry / Aquaman must fight to retain the Atlantean throne from opposing threats.\n\nIn June 2014, Jason Momoa was cast as Arthur Curry / Aquaman. By August, Will Beall and Kurt Johnstad were writing competing scripts for the character's solo film. \"Aquaman\" was announced in October. In June 2015, James Wan was hired as director, as well as to oversee the screenplay by Johnstad. The film's plot takes place after the events of \"Justice League\". In November 2015, David Leslie Johnson was hired to write a new script. In July 2016, Beall returned to write the script, based on a story treatment by Wan and Geoff Johns. In December, Patrick Wilson was cast as Orm / Ocean Master, the half-brother of Aquaman and the main antagonist of the film. In January 2017, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II was cast in the role of villain Black Manta. In March, Nicole Kidman confirmed that she will play Queen Atlanna, Aquaman's mother. In April, Dolph Lundgren was cast as the villain King Nereus. In June, \"Deadline Hollywood\" reported that Johnson had returned to the project to work on a rewrite of Beall's script with Wan and producer Peter Safran. Heard will reprise her role as Mera from \"Justice League\". Other cast members include Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko, Temuera Morrison as Aquaman's father Tom Curry, and Ludi Lin as Murk, an ally of Aquaman. Principal photography began on May 2, 2017, in Queensland, Australia, and wrapped on October 21, 2017. \"Aquaman\" is scheduled to be released in North America on December 21, 2018.\n\nIn order to expand and build the universe the films are set in, some additional material has been released, such as additional scenes or bonus material included in the home releases of the films. The purpose of said material is also to set up and tease the overarching narrative that future installments of the franchise will adhere to. In the case of additional scenes, on March 28, 2016, Warner Bros. released to the public via its YouTube channel, a scene not shown in theaters from \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\", titled \"Communion\", which teased the events that would be depicted in \"Justice League\"; the scene was later integrated in the Ultimate Edition home release of the film. Similarly, in the Blu-ray disc home release of \"Wonder Woman\", an epilogue is included in the form of a short titled \"Etta's Mission\", which details a final incident that transpired after the events of the film. Etta teases the existence of a Mother Box, which is crucial to the storyline of \"Justice League\". Also, in the Blu-ray home release of \"Justice League\", two additional scenes not shown in the theatrical cut are included, which further flesh-out the return of Superman and him joining the League.\n\nFurthermore, the various special featurettes and documentaries included in the Blu-ray home releases of the films feature concept arts and designs, as well as background information that greatly expands the shared universe; giving detailed insight into the fictional history, technology, worlds and cultures that appear in the films.\n\nAlthough not all the films in the franchise resort to this practice, some of them make use of post-credits scenes to further develop character relationships and establish the plot elements that will influence future installments, such as \"Suicide Squad\" and \"Justice League\".\n\nBy shouting \"Shazam\", a 14-year-old foster child, Billy Batson, can turn into an adult superhero, courtesy of an ancient wizard. He attempts to master his powers and defeat the evil forces controlled by Doctor Sivana.\n\nIn August 2014, Dwayne Johnson announced his attachment to a project about the superhero Shazam, formerly known as Captain Marvel. In September, Johnson was revealed to be portraying the antihero Black Adam, Shazam's nemesis in the film, with Darren Lemke set to write the script. In October, Warner Bros. announced \"Shazam\" as a film in its upcoming slate. By January 2017, Henry Gayden was working on the script. In July, David F. Sandberg was confirmed as director of the film. It was also confirmed that month that, despite the initial announcement, Dwayne Johnson would not appear as Black Adam in \"Shazam!\", but will instead star in a solo film. Pre-production began with the casting process for Shazam's child-age alter ego Billy Batson in August. By October, Zachary Levi was cast as Shazam. In November, Grace Fulton joined the cast as Shazam's foster sister, Mary Bromfield. Fulton is reteaming with the director after \"\". The film's primary villain will be Doctor Sivana, with actor Mark Strong cast in the role. Later that month, Asher Angel was cast as Billy Batson. In December, Jack Dylan Grazer was cast as Frederick \"Freddy\" Freeman, Batson's foster brother and best friend. Later that month, Jovan Armand, Ian Chen, and Faithe Herman were cast as Batson's foster siblings Pedro Peña, Eugene Choi, and Darla Dudley respectively, while Cooper Andrews and Marta Milans will portray Billy's foster parents. By January 2018, Ron Cephas Jones was in negotiations to portray the wizard, Shazam, who gives Billy his powers, but was replaced by Djimon Hounsou due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nThe film began principal photography in Toronto on January 29, 2018, and wrapped on May 11, 2018, with most of the filming taking place at Pinewood Toronto Studios, among other locations around the city. \"Shazam!\" will be released in North America on April 5, 2019.\n\nBy November 2016, \"Birds of Prey\", based on the female superhero team of the same name, was in development with Christina Hodson signed on as screenwriter. By April 2018, Warner Bros. selected Cathy Yan as director, with Margot Robbie, Sue Kroll, and Bryan Unkless serving as producers for the project. Robbie will reprise her role as Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn from \"Suicide Squad\". The film is expected to be the first theatrical R-rated installment in the franchise and will have a smaller budget than most of the other films. In addition to Robbie's starring role, the team roster will also include Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, Rosie Perez, and Ella Jay Basco as Huntress, Black Canary, Renee Montoya, and Cassandra Cain, respectively. Black Mask will serve as the film's primary antagonist with Ewan McGregor portraying the character. The film began pre-production in late July 2018, with principal photography scheduled to commence on January 15, 2019 in Los Angeles under the working title \"Fox Force Five\". In November 2018, Robbie revealed the full title of the film as, \"Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)\". Warner Bros. had the slated film scheduled to be released on February 14, 2020, but \"Birds of Prey\" moved the date forward one week, to February 7, 2020.\n\nBy June 2017, Geoff Johns and Patty Jenkins had begun work on the story treatment for a \"Wonder Woman\" sequel. By July, Johns announced that he is working on the script for the film. That same month, the sequel was officially announced at San Diego Comic-Con. Gadot will reprise her role as Wonder Woman. By September, Jenkins signed a deal to return as director, and brought on David Callaham to pen the script with her and Johns. The film takes place in the 1980s during the Cold War. Jenkins said the film, like its predecessor, will be a love story, but with a new love interest. Pre-production had begun by early December 2017, with filming scheduled to start in June 2018, under the working title \"Magic Hour\". By March 2018, Kristen Wiig was cast to portray the film's primary antagonist, Barbara Ann Minerva / Cheetah. That same month, Pedro Pascal was also cast in a key role.\n\nProduction began on June 13, 2018 around the District of Columbia and Northern Virginia. Other filming locations include the Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden in the United Kingdom and the islands of Tenerife and Fuerteventura in Spain. \"Wonder Woman 1984\" is scheduled to be released in North America on June 5, 2020.\n\nBy July 2013, Greg Berlanti was developing a film that centered around Barry Allen / The Flash. In October 2014, \"The Flash\" was announced with a scheduled 2018 release date. The initial script was drafted by Berlanti, Chris Brancato, Michael Green and Marc Guggenheim. In April 2015, a story treatment was written by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller based on the previous draft, with the intent being that the duo would also direct the film. Over the next two years, Seth Grahame-Smith and Rick Famuyiwa, had individually dropped out of the project due to creative differences with the studio. In January 2017, Joby Harold was hired to do a page-one rewrite of the script, which previously had drafts written by Grahame-Smith and Famuyiwa. In July 2017, the title for the film was changed to \"Flashpoint\", based on the comic book story arc of the same name. \n\nIn March 2018, John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein were hired to direct. Zack Snyder, Alex Gartner, Geoff Johns, Dan Mazer, Richard Suckle, Deborah Snyder, Phil Lord, Chris Miller, Jon Berg, and Denise Di Novi will serve as producers on the project. Dan Mazeau was brought on as co-writer, followed by Grahame-Smith and Brancato as additional screenwriters. Daley and Goldstein had initially announced the release of \"The Flash\" to be sometime during 2020, though production was delayed from April 2019 to later in the same year to allow for additional work on the script. Principal photography will take place in Atlanta, Georgia, and follow in Leavesden, Hertfordshire, England. The tone of the film will be similar to \"Back to the Future\".\n\nIn October 2014, a Batman standalone film was announced by Warner Bros. By 2016, Ben Affleck was set to star in, produce, direct, and write the project. Geoff Johns was hired as co-writer. The film was on track to begin shooting in 2017, until Affleck stepped down as director in January 2017, in order to more efficiently focus on starring as the eponymous role. In February 2017, Warner Bros. announced the title as \"The Batman\" and revealed that Matt Reeves would direct and co-produce the film. By July of that year, Reeves confirmed that the script was being rewritten. The story has reportedly been reworked to focus on Batman earlier on in his career as a vigilante.

{"id": "526089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=526089", "title": "Dance-pop", "text": "Dance-pop\n\nDance-pop is a pop and dance subgenre that originated in the early 1980s. It is generally uptempo music intended for nightclubs with the intention of being danceable but also suitable for contemporary hit radio. Developing from a combination of electronic dance music and pop music, with influences of disco, post-disco and synth-pop, it is generally characterised by strong beats with easy, uncomplicated song structures which are generally more similar to pop music than the more free-form dance genre, with an emphasis on melody as well as catchy tunes. The genre, on the whole, tends to be producer-driven, despite some notable exceptions.\n\nDance-pop borrowed influences from other genres, which varied by producer, artist and period. Such include contemporary R&B, house, trance, techno, new jack swing, funk, synthpop, electropop and some forms of Europop.\n\nDance-pop is a popular mainstream style of music and there have been numerous pop artists and groups who perform in the genre. Notable ones include Cher, Madonna, Britney Spears, Kylie Minogue, Gloria Estefan, Christina Aguilera, Jennifer Lopez, Spice Girls, Paula Abdul, Backstreet Boys, Michael Jackson, NSYNC, Destiny's Child, Janet Jackson, Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift.\n\nAs the term \"disco\" started to go out of fashion by the late 1970s to early 1980s, other terms were commonly used to describe disco-based music, such as \"post-disco\", \"club\", \"dance\" or \"dance-pop\" music. These genres were, in essence, a more modern variant of disco music known as post-disco, which tended to be more experimental, electronic and producer/DJ-driven, often using sequencers and synthesizers.\n\nDance-pop music emerged in the 1980s as a combination of dance and pop, or post-disco, which was uptempo and simple, club-natured, producer-driven and catchy. Dance-pop was more uptempo and dancey than regular pop, yet more structured and less free-form than dance music, usually combining pop's easy structure and catchy tunes with dance's strong beat and uptempo nature. Dance-pop music was usually created, composed and produced by record producers who would then hire singers to perform the songs.\n\nIn the beginning of the 1980s, disco was an anathema to the mainstream pop. According to prominent Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Madonna had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music, utilizing her charisma, chutzpah and sex appeal. Erlewine claimed that Madonna \"launched dance-pop\" and set the standard for the genre for the next two decades. As the primary songwriter on her self-titled debut album and a co-producer by her third record, Madonna's insistence on being involved in all creative aspects of her work was highly unusual for a female dance-pop vocalist at the time. The staff of \"Vice\" magazine stated that her debut album \"drew the blueprint for future dance-pop.\"\n\nIn the 1980s, dance-pop was closely aligned to other uptempo electronic genres, such as Hi-NRG. Prominent producers in the 1980s included Stock, Aitken and Waterman, who created Hi-NRG/dance-pop for artists such as Kylie Minogue, Dead or Alive and Bananarama. During the decade, dance-pop borrowed influences from funk (e.g. Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston), new jack swing (e.g. Janet Jackson and Paula Abdul), and contemporary R&B.\n\nOther prominent dance-pop artists and groups of the 1980s included the Pet Shop Boys, Mel and Kim, Samantha Fox, Debbie Gibson, and Tiffany.\n\nBy the 1990s, dance-pop had become a major genre in popular music. Several dance-pop groups and artists emerged during the 1990s, such as the Spice Girls, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, Backstreet Boys, and 'NSYNC. During the early 1990s, dance-pop borrowed influences from house music (e.g. Right Said Fred's \"I'm Too Sexy\", Taylor Dayne's \"Soul Dancing\", and Madonna's \"Vogue\", \"Rescue Me\" and \"Deeper and Deeper\"), as well as contemporary R&B and new jack swing (e.g. Shanice's \"I Love Your Smile\").\n\nBy the late 1990s, electronic influences became evident in dance-pop music; Madonna's critically acclaimed and commercially successful album \"Ray of Light\" (1998) incorporated techno, trance and other forms of electronic dance music, bringing electronica into mainstream dance-pop. Additionally, also in 1998, Cher released a dance-pop song called \"Believe\" which made usage of a technological innovation of the time, Auto-Tune. An audio processor and a form of pitch modification software, Auto-Tune is commonly used as a way to correct pitch and to create special effects. Since the late 1990s, the use of Auto-Tune processing has become a common feature of dance-pop music.\n\nCeline Dion also released a midtempo dance-pop song, \"That's the Way It Is\" by the end of 1999.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2000s, dance-pop music was still prominent, and highly electronic in style, influenced by genres such as trance, house, techno and electro. Nonetheless, as R&B and hip hop became extremely popular from the early part of the decade onwards, dance-pop often borrowed a lot of its influences from urban music. Dance-pop stars from the 1980s and 1990s such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Madonna, Janet Jackson and Kylie Minogue continued to achieve success at the beginning of the decade. Whilst a lot of dance-pop at the time was R&B-influenced, many records started to return to their disco roots; Kylie Minogue's albums such as \"Light Years\" (2000) and \"Fever\" (2001) contained influences of disco music, or a new 21st-century version of the genre known as nu-disco; hit singles such as \"Spinning Around\" (2000) and \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" (2001) also contained disco traces. In Madonna's case, her album \"Music\" (2000) contained elements of Euro disco, especially the successful eponymous lead single.\n\nNevertheless, it was not until the mid-to-latter part of the decade when dance-pop music returned greatly to its disco roots; this can be seen with Madonna's album \"Confessions on a Dance Floor\" (2005), which borrowed strong influences from the genre, especially from 1970s artists and bands such as ABBA, Giorgio Moroder, the Bee Gees and Donna Summer. Britney Spears' album \"Blackout\" (2007) contained influences of Euro disco.\n\nThe mid-to-late 2000s saw the arrival of several new dance-pop artists, including Rihanna, Kesha, Lady Gaga and Katy Perry. This period in time also saw dance-pop's return to its more electronic roots aside from its disco ones, with strong influences of synthpop and electropop; Rihanna's singles in the dance-pop genre, including \"Don't Stop the Music\" and \"Disturbia\", contained electronic influences, the former of which has elements of house music, the latter electropop; Lady Gaga's singles \"Just Dance\" and \"Poker Face\" were also heavily influenced by synthpop and electropop; Kesha's debut single, \"Tik Tok\", was also highly electronic in style and employed a video game beat. Katy Perry's \"Hot N Cold\" (2008), \"California Gurls\" (2010), and \"Firework\" (2010), which were major commercial hits, also showcased influences of electropop and house music.\n\nThe 2010s so far have, similarly to the late 2000s, seen strong electronic influences present within dance-pop and also heavy emphasis on bass-heavy drum beats. Dance-pop artists such as Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Kesha, Christina Aguilera, Usher and Rihanna remain very popular, and several new recording artists within the genre have or are starting to emerge. Country-pop artist Taylor Swift's albums \"Red\" (2012) and \"1989\" (2014) both contain more of a pop-influenced sound which features production by dance-pop producers Max Martin and Shellback. Ariana Grande's single \"Problem\" was a big hit in 2014.\n\nDance-pop generally contains several notable characteristics, which are listed here:\n\n\n"}

It is an international body coordinating dozens of national and international clubs and federations around the world. Together these clubs represent approximately 50,000 magicians from 50 countries as of 2015. The organization hosts a self-named \"FISM\" conference every three years, where magicians compete for \"Best of\" categories. The most recent FISM was in 2018, held in Busan, South Korea. \nFounded in 1948, it is one of the most recognized magic organizations in the magic circle. Currently, there are more than 80 member organizations and about 50,000 members from 50 countries and regions, including Taiwan’s Black Hat Magic Association and the Taiwan Magic Development Association (TMA). Another 808 magic item shop is also in the process Apply for membership. The FISM organizes a worldwide magic convention every three years. The member organizations fight for the right to host. Top magicians from all over the world will compete for the title of “World Magic Champion”. Prior to this, various regions will hold regional selections. FISM Europe, FISM Asia, FISM North America, FISM Latin America, FISM Africa, FISM Oceania, and member organizations have the quotas recommended by their regional selection committees.\n\nThe roots of the FISM began in Paris, France, in 1937, at a meeting of the 34-year-old ASAP, \"Association Syndicale des Artistes Prestidigitateurs\" (Association of prestidigitation artists), which had a monthly magazine \"Le Journal de la Prestidigitation\". The group's vice-president, Dr. Jules Dhotel, wanted the ASAP to produce an international convention in Paris in October 1939, and then proceed to have the convention in a different country each year. Plans proceeded, but when the Nazis invaded Poland in September 1939, the convention was cancelled. After World War II, progress resumed. In 1946, a hotel in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, hosted an International Congress of Magicians, with over 300 registrants from around Europe. There were lectures, exhibits of antique books and apparatus, tours of Amsterdam, a public show, and a contest in which 20 magicians took part. There were no categories, so only one set of awards. First prize went to amateur French magician Jean Valton, for an exceptional routine of card juggling and manipulation; second went to Scotland's amateur magician John Ramsay, and third to a professional husband-wife duo, De Flezkis, who combined magic and dance.\n\nThe 1947 \"Congrès Magique International\" brought in 500 attendees from 18 countries, and 70 participants in the competition. Meetings at that convention were held to discuss the creation of a formal international organization, and that was where the FISM title was proposed. While details were worked out, the \"Congrès\" conventions continued annually.\n\nFISM's stated aim is to create a centralized \"voice\" for the magic world and to help develop, elevate, and promote the art of magic. It coordinates activities of member societies and encourages communication between them, as well as the exchange of services. It has a corporate identity and a team of professional marketers. It also serves a capacity in the realm of intellectual property, fighting against the copying or inappropriate release of magical inventions or routines.\n\nThe FISM is probably best known for conducting one of the premier magic conventions in the world, the triennial \"World Championship of Magic\".

() is a South Korean video game corporation primarily known for the development of the massively multiplayer online role-playing game \"Ragnarok Online\".\n\nThe corporation started as a small business in Shinsa-dong, Kangnam-ku, Seoul, South Korea and has expanded to an international corporate interest with several subsidiary divisions. On 8 February 2005, Gravity Corporation made their IPO and traded $108 million US dollars on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol GRVY.\n\nThe company has had a rather turbulent history initially involving internal political conflicts between CEO Hakyu Kim (who eventually left the company), and company president Jung Ryool Kim (who later assumed control as CEO), but has since stabilised and expanded operations to all of north and south-east Asia through supervised partnerships with native corporate entities. However, while Gravity Corporation's flagship product Ragnarok Online is considered a success in Asia, operations are not as well developed in Europe and the United States in comparison to similar products marketed and developed there.\n\nOn 30 August 2005, Jung Ryool Kim, the controlling shareholder, sold his 52% stake and set plans to quit as a director. The buyers of his shares were Ezer and Techno Groove of Japan, a pair of technology ventures controlled by Il Young Ryu and Taizo and Masayoshi Son. After becoming the new majority shareholder, on 13 September 2005, Il Young Ryu was named by Gravity as its new chairman and joint chief executive. Il Young Ryu is also the founder of Area Network Limited and the CEO of Internet Japan. In December, 2006, Techno Groove merged into Asian Groove, and ceased to exist. EZER subsequently returned Techno Groove's investment of 9.9 billion yen to Asian Groove, which gave up any interest in Gravity. On 19 October 2007, EZER sold their interest in Gravity to Son Assets Management or SAM.\n\nOn 22 May 2006, Gravity announced it had invested $9 Million in US game developer Perpetual Entertainment. Consequently, Gravity received a position on Perpetual's board of directors. Gravity also received \"priority rights for future access to contents and other intellectual property rights of Perpetual Entertainment.\" On 21 November 2007, Gravity announced they had lost their investment after Perpetual cancelled its development of the MMORPG Gods and Heroes.

In 2005, Kim sold his shares of Gravity to EZER, Inc., a Japanese corporation. Kim paid the company back KRW 7.8 billion on 17 October 2005. After an investigation, Gravity and Kim reached a final settlement where Mr. Kim would additionally pay Gravity \"in part to reimburse the Company for certain of the costs and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the investigation of the former Chairman's diversion of revenues otherwise due to the Company.\" Both parties agreed to cease any civil and criminal litigation against one another. As a result of the investigation, Gravity was forced to restate its financial statements for the years 2002-2004.\n\nIn 2006, two U.S. based hedge funds created a committee for \"fair treatment of minority shareholders\" which initiated litigation charging that the majority shareholders and officers have violated their fiduciary obligations.\n\nThe funds, Moon Capital Management and Ramius Capital Group, both headquartered in New York City, demanded that Gravity call an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders to give them a chance to vote Il Young Ryu out of office.

HDMI is a digital replacement for analog video standards.\n\nHDMI implements the EIA/CEA-861 standards, which define video formats and waveforms, transport of compressed and uncompressed LPCM audio, auxiliary data, and implementations of the VESA EDID. CEA-861 signals carried by HDMI are electrically compatible with the CEA-861 signals used by the digital visual interface (DVI). No signal conversion is necessary, nor is there a loss of video quality when a DVI-to-HDMI adapter is used. The CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) capability allows HDMI devices to control each other when necessary and allows the user to operate multiple devices with one handheld remote control device.\n\nSeveral versions of HDMI have been developed and deployed since initial release of the technology, but all use the same cable and connector. Other than improved audio and video capacity, performance, resolution and color spaces, newer versions have optional advanced features such as 3D, Ethernet data connection, and CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) extensions.\n\nProduction of consumer HDMI products started in late 2003. In Europe either DVI-HDCP or HDMI is included in the HD ready in-store labeling specification for TV sets for HDTV, formulated by EICTA with SES Astra in 2005. HDMI began to appear on consumer HDTVs in 2004 and camcorders and digital still cameras in 2006. (twelve years after the release of the first HDMI specification), over 4 billion HDMI devices have been sold.\n\nThe HDMI founders were Hitachi, Panasonic, Philips, Silicon Image, Sony, Thomson, RCA, and Toshiba. Digital Content Protection, LLC provides HDCP (which was developed by Intel) for HDMI. HDMI has the support of motion picture producers Fox, Universal, Warner Bros. and Disney, along with system operators DirecTV, EchoStar (Dish Network) and CableLabs.\n\nThe HDMI founders began development on HDMI 1.0 on April 16, 2002, with the goal of creating an AV connector that was backward-compatible with DVI. At the time, DVI-HDCP (DVI with HDCP) and DVI-HDTV (DVI-HDCP using the CEA-861-B video standard) were being used on HDTVs. HDMI 1.0 was designed to improve on DVI-HDTV by using a smaller connector and adding audio capability and enhanced capability and consumer electronics control functions.\n\nThe first Authorized Testing Center (ATC), which tests HDMI products, was opened by Silicon Image on June 23, 2003, in California, United States. The first ATC in Japan was opened by Panasonic on May 1, 2004, in Osaka. The first ATC in Europe was opened by Philips on May 25, 2005, in Caen, France. The first ATC in China was opened by Silicon Image on November 21, 2005, in Shenzhen. The first ATC in India was opened by Philips on June 12, 2008, in Bangalore. The HDMI website contains a list of all the ATCs.\n\nAccording to In-Stat, the number of HDMI devices sold was 5 million in 2004, 17.4 million in 2005, 63 million in 2006, and 143 million in 2007. HDMI has become the de facto standard for HDTVs, and according to In-Stat, around 90% of digital televisions in 2007 included HDMI. In-Stat has estimated that 229 million HDMI devices were sold in 2008. On April 8, 2008 there were over 850 consumer electronics and PC companies that had adopted the HDMI specification (HDMI adopters). On January 7, 2009, HDMI Licensing, LLC announced that HDMI had reached an installed base of over 600 million HDMI devices. In-Stat has estimated that 394 million HDMI devices would sell in 2009 and that all digital televisions by the end of 2009 would have at least one HDMI input.\n\nOn January 28, 2008, In-Stat reported that shipments of HDMI were expected to exceed those of DVI in 2008, driven primarily by the consumer electronics market.\n\nIn 2008, \"PC Magazine\" awarded a Technical Excellence Award in the Home Theater category for an \"innovation that has changed the world\" to the CEC portion of the HDMI specification. Ten companies were given a Technology and Engineering Emmy Award for their development of HDMI by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences on January 7, 2009.\n\nOn October 25, 2011, the HDMI Forum was established by the HDMI founders to create an open organization so that interested companies can participate in the development of the HDMI specification. All members of the HDMI Forum have equal voting rights, may participate in the Technical Working Group, and if elected can be on the Board of Directors. There is no limit to the number of companies allowed in the HDMI Forum though companies must pay an annual fee of US$15,000 with an additional annual fee of $5,000 for those companies who serve on the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors is made up of 11 companies who are elected every 2 years by a general vote of HDMI Forum members. All future development of the HDMI specification take place in the HDMI Forum and are built upon the HDMI 1.4b specification. Also on the same day HDMI Licensing, LLC announced that there were over 1,100 HDMI adopters and that over 2 billion HDMI-enabled products had shipped since the launch of the HDMI standard. From October 25, 2011, all development of the HDMI specification became the responsibility of the newly created HDMI Forum.\n\nOn January 8, 2013, HDMI Licensing, LLC announced that there were over 1,300 HDMI adopters and that over 3 billion HDMI devices had shipped since the launch of the HDMI standard. The day also marked the 10-year anniversary of the release of the first HDMI specification.\n\nThe HDMI specification defines the protocols, signals, electrical interfaces and mechanical requirements of the standard. The maximum pixel clock rate for HDMI 1.0 is 165 MHz, which is sufficient to allow 1080p and WUXGA (1920×1200) at 60Hz. HDMI 1.3 increases that to 340 MHz, which allows for higher resolution (such as WQXGA, 2560×1600) across a single digital link. An HDMI connection can either be single-link (type A/C/D) or dual-link (type B) and can have a video pixel rate of 25 MHz to 340 MHz (for a single-link connection) or 25 MHz to 680 MHz (for a dual-link connection). Video formats with rates below 25 MHz (e.g., 13.5 MHz for 480i/NTSC) are transmitted using a pixel-repetition scheme.\n\nHDMI uses the Consumer Electronics Association/Electronic Industries Alliance 861 standards. HDMI 1.0 to HDMI 1.2a uses the EIA/CEA-861-B video standard, HDMI 1.3 uses the CEA-861-D video standard, and HDMI 1.4 uses the CEA-861-E video standard. The CEA-861-E document defines \"video formats and waveforms; colorimetry and quantization; transport of compressed and uncompressed LPCM audio; carriage of auxiliary data; and implementations of the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) Enhanced Extended Display Identification Data Standard (E-EDID)\". On July 15, 2013, the CEA announced the publication of CEA-861-F, a standard that can be used by interfaces such as DVI, HDMI, and LVDS. CEA-861-F adds the ability to transmit several Ultra HD video formats and additional color spaces.\n\nTo ensure baseline compatibility between different HDMI sources and displays (as well as backward compatibility with the electrically compatible DVI standard) all HDMI devices must implement the sRGB color space at 8 bits per component. Ability to use the color space and higher color depths (\"deep color\") is optional. HDMI permits sRGB 4:4:4 chroma subsampling (8–16 bits per component), xvYCC 4:4:4 chroma subsampling (8–16 bits per component), 4:4:4 chroma subsampling (8–16 bits per component), or 4:2:2 chroma subsampling (8–12 bits per component). The color spaces that can be used by HDMI are ITU-R BT.601, ITU-R BT.709-5 and IEC 61966-2-4.\n\nFor digital audio, if an HDMI device has audio, it is required to implement the baseline format: stereo (uncompressed) PCM. Other formats are optional, with HDMI allowing up to 8 channels of uncompressed audio at sample sizes of 16-bit, 20-bit and 24-bit, with sample rates of 32kHz, 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88.2kHz, 96kHz, 176.4kHz and 192kHz. HDMI also carries any IEC 61937-compliant compressed audio stream, such as Dolby Digital and DTS, and up to 8 channels of one-bit DSD audio (used on Super Audio CDs) at rates up to four times that of Super Audio CD. With version 1.3, HDMI allows lossless compressed audio streams Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio. As with the video, audio capability is optional. Audio return channel (ARC) is a feature introduced in the HDMI 1.4 standard. \"Return\" refers to the case where the audio comes from the TV and can be sent \"upstream\" to the AV receiver using the HDMI cable connected to the AV receiver. An example given on the HDMI website is that a TV that directly receives a terrestrial/satellite broadcast, or has a video source built in, sends the audio \"upstream\" to the AV receiver.\n\nThe HDMI standard was not designed to pass closed caption data (for example, subtitles) to the television for decoding. As such, any closed caption stream must be decoded and included as an image in the video stream(s) prior to transmission over an HDMI cable to appear on the DTV. This limits the caption style (even for digital captions) to only that decoded at the source prior to HDMI transmission. This also prevents closed captions when transmission over HDMI is required for upconversion. For example, a DVD player that sends an upscaled 720p/1080i format via HDMI to an HDTV has no way to pass Closed Captioning data so that the HDTV can decode it, as there is no line 21 VBI in that format.\n\nHDMI has three physically separate communication channels, which are the DDC, TMDS and the optional CEC. HDMI 1.4 added ARC and HEC.\n\nThe Display Data Channel (DDC) is a communication channel based on the I²C bus specification. HDMI specifically requires the device implement the Enhanced Display Data Channel (E-DDC), which is used by the HDMI source device to read the E-EDID data from the HDMI sink device to learn what audio/video formats it can take. HDMI requires that the E-DDC implement I²C standard mode speed (100 kbit/s) and allows it to optionally implement fast mode speed (400 kbit/s).\n\nThe DDC channel is actively used for High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP).\n\nTransition-minimized differential signaling (TMDS) on HDMI interleaves video, audio and auxiliary data using three different packet types, called the Video Data Period, the Data Island Period and the Control Period. During the Video Data Period, the pixels of an active video line are transmitted. During the Data Island period (which occurs during the horizontal and vertical blanking intervals), audio and auxiliary data are transmitted within a series of packets. The Control Period occurs between Video and Data Island periods.\n\nBoth HDMI and DVI use TMDS to send 10-bit characters that are encoded using 8b/10b encoding that differs from the original IBM form for the Video Data Period and 2b/10b encoding for the Control Period. HDMI adds the ability to send audio and auxiliary data using 4b/10b encoding for the Data Island Period. Each Data Island Period is 32 pixels in size and contains a 32-bit Packet Header, which includes 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data for error correction and describes the contents of the packet. Each packet contains four subpackets, and each subpacket is 64 bits in size, including 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data, allowing for each packet to carry up to 224 bits of audio data. Each Data Island Period can contain up to 18 packets. Seven of the 15 packet types described in the HDMI 1.3a specifications deal with audio data, while the other 8 types deal with auxiliary data. Among these are the General Control Packet and the Gamut Metadata Packet. The General Control Packet carries information on AVMUTE (which mutes the audio during changes that may cause audio noise) and Color Depth (which sends the bit depth of the current video stream and is required for deep color). The Gamut Metadata Packet carries information on the color space being used for the current video stream and is required for xvYCC.\n\nConsumer Electronics Control (CEC) is an HDMI feature designed to allow the user to command and control up to 15 CEC-enabled devices, that are connected through HDMI, by using only one of their remote controls (for example by controlling a television set, set-top box, and DVD player using only the remote control of the TV). CEC also allows for individual CEC-enabled devices to command and control each other without user intervention.\n\nIt is a one-wire bidirectional serial bus that is based on the CENELEC standard AV.link protocol to perform remote control functions. CEC wiring is mandatory, although implementation of CEC in a product is optional. It was defined in HDMI Specification 1.0 and updated in HDMI 1.2, HDMI 1.2a and HDMI 1.3a (which added timer and audio commands to the bus). USB to CEC adapters exist that allow a computer to control CEC-enabled devices.\n\nIntroduced in HDMI 1.4, HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel (HEAC) adds a high-speed bidirectional data communication link (HEC) and the ability to send audio data upstream to the source device (ARC). HEAC utilizes two lines from the connector: the previously unused \"Reserved\" pin (called HEAC+) and the \"Hot Plug Detect\" pin (called HEAC−). If only ARC transmission is required, a single mode signal using the HEAC+ line can be used, otherwise, HEC is transmitted as a differential signal over the pair of lines, and ARC as a common mode component of the pair.\n\nAudio Return Channel (ARC)\n\nARC is an audio link meant to replace other cables between the TV and the A/V receiver or speaker system. This direction is used when the TV is the one that generates or receives the video stream instead of the other equipment. A typical case is the running of an app on a smart TV such as Netflix, but reproduction of audio is handled by the other equipment. Without ARC, the audio output from the TV must be routed by another cable, typically TOSLink or coax, into the speaker system.\nHDMI Ethernet Channel (HEC)\n\nHDMI Ethernet Channel technology consolidates video, audio, and data streams into a single HDMI cable, and the HEC feature enables IP-based applications over HDMI and provides a bidirectional Ethernet communication at 100 Mbit/s. The physical layer of the Ethernet implementation uses a hybrid to simultaneously send and receive attenuated 100BASE-TX type signals through a single twisted pair.\n\nHDMI is backward compatible with single-link Digital Visual Interface digital video (DVI-D or DVI-I, but not DVI-A). No signal conversion is required when an adapter or asymmetric cable is used, so there is no loss of video quality.\n\nFrom a user's perspective, an HDMI display can be driven by a single-link DVI-D source, since HDMI and DVI-D define an overlapping minimum set of allowed resolutions and frame-buffer formats to ensure a basic level of interoperability. In the reverse case, a DVI-D monitor has the same level of basic interoperability unless content protection with High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) interferes—or the HDMI color encoding is in component color space instead of RGB, which is not possible in DVI. An HDMI source, such as a Blu-ray player, may require an HDCP-compliant display, and refuse to output HDCP-protected content to a non-compliant display. A further complication is that there is a small amount of display equipment, such as some high-end home theater projectors, designed with HDMI inputs but not HDCP-compliant.\n\nAny DVI-to-HDMI adapter can function as an HDMI-to-DVI adapter (and vice versa). Typically, the only limitation is the gender of the adapter's connectors and the gender of the cables and sockets it is used with.\n\nFeatures specific to HDMI, such as remote-control and audio transport, are not available in devices that use legacy DVI-D signalling. However, many devices output HDMI over a DVI connector (e.g., ATI 3000-series and NVIDIA GTX 200-series video cards), and some multimedia displays may accept HDMI (including audio) over a DVI input. Exact capabilities beyond basic compatibility vary. Adapters are generally bi-directional.\n\nHigh-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) is a newer form of digital rights management. Intel created the original technology to make sure that digital content followed the guidelines set by the Digital Content Protection group.\n\nHDMI can use HDCP to encrypt the signal if required by the source device. CSS, CPRM and AACS require the use of HDCP on HDMI when playing back encrypted DVD Video, DVD Audio, HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc. The HDCP Repeater bit controls the authentication and switching/distribution of an HDMI signal. According to HDCP Specification 1.2 (beginning with HDMI CTS 1.3a), any system that implements HDCP must do so in a fully compliant manner. HDCP testing that was previously only a requirement for optional tests such as the \"Simplay HD\" testing program is now part of the requirements for HDMI compliance. HDCP accommodates up to 127 connected devices with up to 7 levels, using a combination of sources, sinks and repeaters. A simple example of this is several HDMI devices connected to an HDMI AV receiver that is connected to an HDMI display.\n\nDevices called HDCP strippers can remove the HDCP information from the video signal so the video can play on non-HDCP-compliant displays, though a fair use and non-disclosure form must usually be signed with a registering agency before use.\n\nThere are five HDMI connector types. Type A/B are defined in the HDMI 1.0 specification, type C is defined in the HDMI 1.3 specification, and type D/E are defined in the HDMI 1.4 specification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe HDMI alternate mode lets a user connect the reversible USB-C connector with the HDMI source devices (mobile, tablet, laptop). This cable connects to video display/sink devices using any of the native HDMI connectors. This is an HDMI cable, in this case a USB-C to HDMI cable.\n\nAn HDMI cable is composed of four shielded twisted pairs, with impedance of the order of 100 Ω (±15%), plus seven separate conductors. HDMI cables with Ethernet differ in that three of the separate conductors instead form an additional shielded twisted pair (with the CEC/DDC ground as a shield).\n\nAlthough no maximum length for an HDMI cable is specified, signal attenuation (dependent on the cable's construction quality and conducting materials) limits usable lengths in practice and certification is difficult to achieve for lengths beyond 13 m. HDMI 1.3 defines two cable categories: Category 1-certified cables, which have been tested at 74.5 MHz (which would include resolutions such as 720p60 and 1080i60), and Category 2-certified cables, which have been tested at 340 MHz (which would include resolutions such as 1080p60 and 4K30). Category 1 HDMI cables are marketed as \"Standard\" and Category 2 HDMI cables as \"High Speed\". This labeling guideline for HDMI cables went into effect on October 17, 2008. Category 1 and 2 cables can either meet the required parameter specifications for inter-pair skew, far-end crosstalk, attenuation and differential impedance, or they can meet the required non equalized/equalized eye diagram requirements. A cable of about can be manufactured to Category 1 specifications easily and inexpensively by using 28 AWG (0.081 mm²) conductors. With better quality construction and materials, including 24 AWG (0.205 mm²) conductors, an HDMI cable can reach lengths of up to . Many HDMI cables under 5 meters of length that were made before the HDMI 1.3 specification can work as Category 2 cables, but only Category 2-tested cables are guaranteed to work for Category 2 purposes.\n\nAs of the HDMI 1.4 specification, the following cable types are defined for HDMI in general:\n\n\nA new certification program was introduced in October 2015 to certify that cables work at the 18 Gbit/s maximum bandwidth of the HDMI 2.0 specification. In addition to expanding the set of cable testing requirements, the certification program introduces an EMI test to ensure cables minimize interference with wireless signals. These cables are marked with an anti-counterfeiting authentication label and are defined as:\n\nIn conjunction with the HDMI 2.1 specification, a third category of cable was announced on January 4, 2017, called \"48G\". Also known as Category 3 HDMI or \"Ultra High Speed\" HDMI, the cable is designed to support the 48Gbit/s bandwidth of HDMI 2.1, supporting 4K, 5K, 8K and 10K at 120Hz. The cable is backwards compatible with the earlier HDMI devices, using existing HDMI type A, C and D connectors, and includes HDMI Ethernet.\n\nAn HDMI extender is a single device (or pair of devices) powered with an external power source or with the 5V DC from the HDMI source. Long cables can cause instability of HDCP and blinking on the screen, due to the weakened DDC signal that HDCP requires. HDCP DDC signals must be multiplexed with TMDS video signals to comply with HDCP requirements for HDMI extenders based on a single Category 5/Category 6 cable. Several companies offer amplifiers, equalizers and repeaters that can string several standard HDMI cables together. Active HDMI cables use electronics within the cable to boost the signal and allow for HDMI cables of up to ; those based on HDBaseT can extend to 100 meters; HDMI extenders that are based on dual Category 5/Category 6 cable can extend HDMI to ; while HDMI extenders based on optical fiber can extend HDMI to .\n\nThe HDMI specification is not an open standard; manufacturers need to be licensed by HDMI LLC in order to implement HDMI in any product or component. Companies who are licensed by HDMI LLC are known as HDMI Adopters.\n\nWhile earlier versions of HDMI specs are available to the public for download, only Adopters have access to the latest standards (HDMI 1.4/1.4a/2).\n\n\nThis is required before any HDMI product can be legally sold.\n\nThere are 2 annual fee structures associated with being an HDMI Adopter:\n\n\nThe annual fee is due upon the execution of the Adopter Agreement, and must be paid on the anniversary of this date each year thereafter.\n\nThe royalty fee structure is the same for all volumes. The following variable per-unit royalty is device-based and not dependent on number of ports, chips or connectors:\n\n\nUse of HDMI logo requires compliance testing. Adopters must license HDCP separately.\n\nThe HDMI royalty is only payable on Licensed Products that will be sold on a stand-alone basis (i.e. that are not incorporated into another Licensed Product that is subject to an HDMI royalty). For example, if a cable or IC is sold to an Adopter who then includes it in a television subject to a royalty, then the cable or IC maker would not pay a royalty, and the television manufacturer would pay the royalty on the final product. If the cable is sold directly to consumers, then the cable would be subject to a royalty.\n\nHDMI devices are manufactured to adhere to various versions of the specification, in which each version is given a number or letter, such as 1.0, 1.2, or 1.4b. Each subsequent version of the specification uses the same kind of cable but increases the bandwidth or capabilities of what can be transmitted over the cable. A product listed as having an HDMI version does not necessarily mean that it has all features in that version, since some HDMI features are optional, such as deep color and xvYCC (which is branded by Sony as \"x.v.Color\"). Note that since the release of HDMI 1.4, the HDMI Licensing LLC group (which oversees the HDMI standard) has banned the use of version numbers to identify cables. Non-cable HDMI products, starting on January 1, 2012, may no longer reference the HDMI number, and must state which features of the HDMI specification the product implements.\n\nHDMI 1.0 was released on December 9, 2002 and is a single-cable digital audio/video connector interface. The link architecture is based on DVI, using exactly the same video transmission format but sending audio and other auxiliary data during the blanking intervals of the video stream. HDMI 1.0 allows a maximum TMDS clock of 165 MHz (4.95 Gbit/s bandwidth per link), the same as DVI. It defines two connectors called Type A and Type B, with pinouts based on the Single-Link DVI-D and Dual-Link DVI-D connectors respectively, though the Type B connector was never used in any commercial products. HDMI 1.0 uses 8b/10b encoding for video transmission, giving it 3.96 Gbit/s of video bandwidth (1920 × 1080 or 1920 × 1200 at 60 Hz) and 8 channel LPCM/192 kHz/24-bit audio. HDMI 1.0 requires support for RGB video, with optional support for 4:4:4 and 4:2:2 (mandatory if the device has support for on other interfaces). Color depth of 10bpc (30bit/px) or 12bpc (36bit/px) is allowed when using 4:2:2 subsampling, but only 8bpc (24bit/px) color depth is permitted when using RGB or 4:4:4. Only the Rec. 601 and Rec. 709 color spaces are supported. HDMI 1.0 allows only specific pre-defined video formats, including all the formats defined in EIA/CEA-861-B and some additional formats listed in the HDMI Specification itself. All HDMI sources/sinks must also be capable of sending/receiving native Single-Link DVI video and be fully compliant with the DVI Specification.\n\nHDMI 1.1 was released on May 20, 2004 and added support for DVD-Audio.\n\nHDMI 1.2 was released on August 8, 2005 and added the option of One Bit Audio, used on Super Audio CDs, at up to 8 channels. To make HDMI more suitable for use on PC devices, version 1.2 also removed the requirement that only explicitly supported formats be used. It added the ability for manufacturers to create vendor-specific formats, allowing any arbitrary resolution and refresh rate rather than being limited to a pre-defined list of supported formats. In addition, it added explicit support for several new formats including 720p at 100 and 120 Hz and relaxed the pixel format support requirements so that sources with only native RGB output (PC sources) would not be required to support output.\n\nHDMI 1.2a was released on December 14, 2005 and fully specifies Consumer Electronic Control (CEC) features, command sets and CEC compliance tests.\n\nHDMI 1.3 was released on June 22, 2006, and increased the maximum TMDS clock to 340 MHz (10.2 Gbit/s). Like previous versions, it uses 8b/10b encoding, giving it a maximum video bandwidth of 8.16 Gbit/s (1920×1080 at 120 Hz or 2560×1440 at 60 Hz). It added support for 10 bpc, 12 bpc, and 16 bpc color depth (30, 36, and 48 bit/px), called deep color. It also added support for the xvYCC color space, in addition to the Rec. 601 and Rec. 709 color spaces supported by previous versions, and added the ability to carry metadata defining color gamut boundaries. It also optionally allows output of Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio streams for external decoding by AV receivers. It incorporates automatic audio syncing (audio video sync) capability. It defined cable Categories 1 and 2, with Category 1 cable being tested up to 74.25 MHz and Category 2 being tested up to 340 MHz. It also added the new type C Mini connector for portable devices.\n\nHDMI 1.3a was released on November 10, 2006, and had Cable and Sink modifications for type C, source termination recommendations, and removed undershoot and maximum rise/fall time limits. It also changed CEC capacitance limits, and CEC commands for timer control were brought back in an altered form, with audio control commands added. It also added the optional ability to stream SACD in its bitstream DST format rather than uncompressed raw DSD.\n\nHDMI 1.4 was released on May 28, 2009, and the first HDMI 1.4 products were available in the second half of 2009. HDMI 1.4 added support for 4096×2160 at 24 Hz, 3840×2160 at 24, 25, and 30 Hz, and 1920×1080 at 120 Hz. It also added an HDMI Ethernet Channel (HEC) that accommodates a 100 Mbit/s Ethernet connection between the two HDMI connected devices so they can share an Internet connection, introduced an audio return channel (ARC), 3D Over HDMI, a new Micro HDMI Connector, an expanded set of color spaces with the addition of sYCC601, Adobe RGB and Adobe YCC601, and an Automotive Connection System. HDMI 1.4 defined several stereoscopic 3D formats including field alternative (interlaced), frame packing (a full resolution top-bottom format), line alternative full, side-by-side half, side-by-side full, 2D + depth, and 2D + depth + graphics + graphics depth (WOWvx). HDMI 1.4 requires that 3D displays implement the frame packing 3D format at either 720p50 and 1080p24 or 720p60 and 1080p24. High Speed HDMI cables as defined in HDMI 1.3 work with all HDMI 1.4 features except for the HDMI Ethernet Channel, which requires the new High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet defined in HDMI 1.4.\n\nHDMI 1.4a was released on March 4, 2010, and added two mandatory 3D formats for broadcast content, which was deferred with HDMI 1.4 pending the direction of the 3D broadcast market. HDMI 1.4a has defined mandatory 3D formats for broadcast, game, and movie content. HDMI 1.4a requires that 3D displays implement the frame packing 3D format at either 720p50 and 1080p24 or 720p60 and 1080p24, side-by-side horizontal at either 1080i50 or 1080i60, and top-and-bottom at either 720p50 and 1080p24 or 720p60 and 1080p24.\n\nHDMI 1.4b was released on October 11, 2011, containing only minor clarifications to the 1.4a document. HDMI 1.4b is the last version of the standard that HDMI Licensing, LLC is responsible for. All future versions of the HDMI Specification were produced by the HDMI Forum, created on October 25, 2011.\n\nHDMI 2.0, referred to by some manufacturers as HDMI UHD, was released on September 4, 2013.\n\nHDMI 2.0 increases the maximum bandwidth to 18.0 Gbit/s. HDMI 2.0 uses 8b/10b encoding for video transmission like previous versions, giving it a maximum video bandwidth of 14.4 Gbit/s. This enables HDMI 2.0 to carry 4K video at 60 Hz with 24 bit/px color depth. Other features of HDMI 2.0 include support for the Rec. 2020 color space, up to 32 audio channels, up to 1536 kHz audio sample frequency, dual video streams to multiple users on the same screen, up to four audio streams, 4:2:0 chroma subsampling, 25 fps 3D formats, support for the 21:9 aspect ratio, dynamic synchronization of video and audio streams, the HE-AAC and DRA audio standards, improved 3D capability, and additional CEC functions.\n\nHDMI 2.0a was released on April 8, 2015, and added support for High Dynamic Range (HDR) video with static metadata.\n\nHDMI 2.0b was released March, 2016. HDMI 2.0b initially supported the same HDR10 standard as HDMI 2.0a as specified in the CTA-861.3 specification. In December 2016 additional support for HDR Video transport was added to HDMI 2.0b in the recently released CTA-861-G specification, which extends the static metadata signaling to include Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG).\n\nHDMI 2.1 was officially announced by the HDMI Forum on January4, 2017, and was released on November 28, 2017. It adds support for higher resolutions and higher refresh rates, including 4K 120Hz and 8K 120Hz. HDMI 2.1 also introduces a new HDMI cable category called \"Ultra High Speed\" (referred to as \"48G\" during development), which certifies cables at the new higher speeds that these formats require. Ultra High Speed HDMI cables are backwards compatible with older HDMI devices, and older cables are compatible with new HDMI 2.1 devices, though the full 48Gbit/s bandwidth is not possible without the new cables.\n\nAdditional features of HDMI 2.1:\n\n\nVideo formats that require more bandwidth than 18.0 Gbit/s (4K 60Hz 8bpc RGB), such as 4K 60Hz 10bpc (HDR), 4K 120Hz, and 8K 60Hz, may require the new \"Ultra High Speed\" or \"Ultra High Speed with Ethernet\" cables. HDMI 2.1's other new features are supported with existing HDMI cables.\n\nThe increase in maximum bandwidth is achieved by increasing both the bitrate of the data channels and the number of channels. Previous HDMI versions use three data channels (each operating at up to 6.0GHz in HDMI 2.0, or up to 3.4GHz in HDMI 1.4), with an additional channel for the TMDS clock signal, which runs at a fraction of the data channel speed (one tenth the speed, or up to 340MHz, for signaling rates up to 3.4GHz; one fortieth the speed, or up to 150MHz, for signaling rates between 3.4 and 6.0GHz). HDMI 2.1 doubles the signaling rate of the data channels to 12GHz (12Gbit/s). The structure of the data has been changed to use a new packet-based format with an embedded clock signal, which allows what was formerly the TMDS clock channel to be used as a fourth data channel instead, increasing the signaling rate across that channel to 12GHz as well. These changes increase the aggregate bandwidth from 18.0Gbit/s (3 × 6.0Gbit/s) to 48.0Gbit/s (4 × 12.0Gbit/s), a 1.66x increase in bandwidth. In addition, the data is encoded using a 16b/18b scheme as opposed to the 8b/10b scheme used by previous versions, which lets a larger percentage of the bandwidth be used for data rather than DC balancing (88.8% compared to 80%). This, in combination with the 1.66x bandwidth increase, raises the maximum data rate of HDMI 2.1 from 14.4Gbit/s to 42.66Gbit/s, a ≈1.96x increase.\n\nThe 48Gbit/s bandwidth provided by HDMI 2.1 is enough for 8K resolution at approximately 50Hz, with 8bpc RGB or 4:4:4 color. To achieve even higher formats, HDMI 2.1 can use Display Stream Compression with a compression ratio of up to 3:1. Using DSC, formats up to 8K (7680×4320) 120Hz or 10K (10240×4320) 100Hz at 8bpc RGB/4:4:4 are possible. Using with 4:2:2 or 4:2:0 chroma subsampling in combination with DSC can allow for even higher formats.\n\nNote that the \"version\" of a connection depends on the versions of the HDMI ports on the source and sink devices, not on the HDMI cable. The different categories of HDMI cable only affect the bandwidth (maximum resolution / refresh rate) of the connection. Other features such as audio, 3D, chroma subsampling, or variable refresh rate depend only on the versions of the ports, and are not affected by what type of HDMI cable is used. The only exception to this is Ethernet-over-HDMI, which requires an \"HDMI with Ethernet\" cable.\n\nAlso note that products are not required to implement all features of a version to be considered compliant with that version, as most features are optional. For example, displays with HDMI 1.4 ports do not necessarily support the full 340 MHz TMDS clock allowed by HDMI 1.4; they are commonly limited to lower speeds such as 300 MHz (1080p 120 Hz) or even as low as 165 MHz (1080p 60 Hz) at the manufacturer's discretion, but are still considered HDMI 1.4-compliant. Likewise, features like 10 bpc (30 bit/px) color depth may also not be supported, even if the HDMI version allows it and the display supports it over other interfaces such as DisplayPort.\n\nFeature support will therefore vary from device to device, even within the same HDMI version.\n\nHDMI 1.0 and 1.1 are restricted to transmitting only certain video formats, defined in EIA/CEA-861-B and in the HDMI Specification itself. HDMI 1.2 and all later versions allow any arbitrary resolution and frame rate (within the bandwidth limit). Formats that are not supported by the HDMI Specification (i.e., no standardized timings defined) may be implemented as a vendor-specific format. Successive versions of the HDMI Specification continue to add support for additional formats (such as 4K resolutions), but the added support is to establish standardized timings to ensure interoperability between products, not to establish which formats are or aren't permitted. Video formats do not require explicit support from the HDMI Specification in order to be transmitted and displayed.\n\nIndividual products may have heavier limitations than those listed below, since HDMI devices are not required to support the maximum bandwidth of the HDMI version that they implement. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that a display will support the refresh rates listed in this table, even if the display has the required HDMI version.\n\nUncompressed 8bpc (24bit/px) color depth and RGB or 4:4:4 color format are assumed on this table except where noted.\n\nHDR10 requires 10bpc (30bit/px) color depth, which uses 25% more bandwidth than standard 8bpc video.\n\nUncompressed 10bpc color depth and RGB or 4:4:4 color format are assumed on this table except where noted.\n\nBlu-ray Disc and HD DVD, introduced in 2006, offer high-fidelity audio features that require HDMI for best results. HDMI 1.3 can transport Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, and DTS-HD Master Audio bitstreams in compressed form. This capability allows for an AV receiver with the necessary decoder to decode the compressed audio stream. The Blu-ray specification does not include video encoded with either deep color or xvYCC; thus, HDMI 1.0 can transfer Blu-ray discs at full video quality.\n\nThe HDMI 1.4 specification (released in 2009) added support for 3D video and is used by all Blu-ray 3D compatible players.\n\nThe Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA) spokespersons have stated (Sept. 2014 at IFA show in Berlin, Germany) that the Blu-ray, Ultra HD players, and 4K discs are expected to be available starting in the second half to 2015. It is anticipated that such Blu-ray UHD players will be required to include a HDMI 2.0 output that supports HDCP 2.2.\n\nBlu-ray permits secondary audio decoding, whereby the disc content can tell the player to mix multiple audio sources together before final output. Some Blu-ray and HD DVD players can decode all of the audio codecs internally and can output LPCM audio over HDMI. Multichannel LPCM can be transported over an HDMI connection, and as long as the AV receiver implements multichannel LPCM audio over HDMI and implements HDCP, the audio reproduction is equal in resolution to HDMI 1.3 bitstream output. Some low-cost AV receivers, such as the Onkyo TX-SR506, do not allow audio processing over HDMI and are labelled as \"HDMI pass through\" devices. Virtually all modern AV Receivers now offer HDMI 1.4 inputs and outputs with processing for all of the audio formats offered by Blu-ray Discs and other HD video sources. During 2014 several manufacturers introduced premium AV Receivers that include one, or multiple, HDMI 2.0 inputs along with a HDMI 2.0 output(s). However, not until 2015 did most major manufacturers of AV receivers also support HDCP 2.2 as needed to support certain high quality UHD video sources, such as Blu-ray UHD players.\n\n, most consumer camcorders, as well as many digital cameras, are equipped with a mini-HDMI connector (type C connector).\n\n, some cameras also have 4K capability and 3D, even some cameras costing less than US$900. It needs at least a TV/monitor with HDMI 1.4a port.\n\nAlthough often HD video capable cameras include an HDMI interface for playback or even live preview, the image processor and the video processor of cameras usable for uncompressed video must be able to deliver the full image resolution at the specified frame rate in real-time without any missing frames causing jitter. Therefore, usable uncompressed video out of HDMI is often called \"clean HDMI\".\n\nPCs with a DVI interface are capable of video output to an HDMI-enabled monitor. Some PCs include an HDMI interface and may also be capable of HDMI audio output, depending on specific hardware. For example, Intel's motherboard chipsets since the 945G and NVIDIA's GeForce 8200/8300 motherboard chipsets are capable of 8-channel LPCM output over HDMI. Eight-channel LPCM audio output over HDMI with a video card was first seen with the ATI Radeon HD 4850, which was released in June 2008 and is implemented by other video cards in the ATI Radeon HD 4000 series. Linux can drive 8-channel LPCM audio over HDMI if the video card has the necessary hardware and implements the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA). The ATI Radeon HD 4000 series implements ALSA. Cyberlink announced in June 2008 that they would update their PowerDVD playback software to allow 192 kHz/24-bit Blu-ray Disc audio decoding in Q3-Q4 of 2008. Corel's WinDVD 9 Plus currently has 96 kHz/24-bit Blu-ray Disc audio decoding.\n\nEven with an HDMI output, a computer may not be able to produce signals that implement HDCP, Microsoft's Protected Video Path, or Microsoft's Protected Audio Path. Several early graphic cards were labelled as \"HDCP-enabled\" but did not have the hardware needed for HDCP; this included some graphic cards based on the ATI X1600 chipset and certain models of the NVIDIA Geforce 7900 series. The first computer monitors that could process HDCP were released in 2005; by February 2006 a dozen different models had been released. The Protected Video Path was enabled in graphic cards that had HDCP capability, since it was required for output of Blu-ray Disc video. In comparison, the Protected Audio Path was required only if a lossless audio bitstream (such as Dolby TrueHD or DTS-HD MA) was output. Uncompressed LPCM audio, however, does not require a Protected Audio Path, and software programs such as PowerDVD and WinDVD can decode Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD MA and output it as LPCM. A limitation is that if the computer does not implement a Protected Audio Path, the audio must be downsampled to 16-bit 48 kHz but can still output at up to 8 channels. No graphic cards were released in 2008 that implemented the Protected Audio Path.\n\nThe Asus Xonar HDAV1.3 became the first HDMI sound card that implemented the Protected Audio Path and could both bitstream and decode lossless audio (Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD MA), although bitstreaming is only available if using the ArcSoft TotalMedia Theatre software. It has an HDMI 1.3 input/output, and Asus says that it can work with most video cards on the market.\n\nIn September 2009, AMD announced the ATI Radeon HD 5000 series video cards, which have HDMI 1.3 output (deep color, xvYCC wide gamut capability and high bit rate audio), 8-channel LPCM over HDMI, and an integrated HD audio controller with a Protected Audio Path that allows bitstream output over HDMI for AAC, Dolby AC-3, Dolby TrueHD and DTS Master Audio formats. The ATI Radeon HD 5870 released in September 2009 is the first video card that allows bitstream output over HDMI for Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio. The AMD Radeon HD 6000 Series implements HDMI 1.4a. The AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series implements HDMI 1.4b.\n\nIn December 2010, it was announced that several computer vendors and display makers including Intel, AMD, Dell, Lenovo, Samsung, and LG would stop using LVDS (actually, FPD-Link) from 2013 and legacy DVI and VGA connectors from 2015, replacing them with DisplayPort and HDMI.\n\nOn August 27, 2012, Asus announced a new monitor that produces its native resolution of 2560×1440 via HDMI 1.4.\n\nOn September 18, 2014, Nvidia launched GeForce GTX 980 and GTX 970 (with GM204 chip) with HDMI 2.0 support. On January 22, 2015, GeForce GTX 960 (with GM206 chip) launched with HDMI 2.0 support. On March 17, 2015, GeForce GTX TITAN X (GM200) launched with HDMI 2.0 support. On June 1, 2015, GeForce GTX 980 Ti (with GM200 chip) launched with HDMI 2.0 support. On August 20, 2015, GeForce GTX 950 (with GM206 chip) launched with HDMI 2.0 support.\n\nOn May 6, 2016, Nvidia launched the GeForce GTX 1080 (GP104 GPU) with HDMI 2.0b support.\n\nThe Xbox 360, Xbox One, Xbox One X, PS3, PS TV, PS4, Wii U, and Nintendo Switch consoles support HDMI. Xbox One X is the first commercial available HDMI 2.1 device.\n\nSome tablet computers, such as the Microsoft Surface, Motorola Xoom, BlackBerry PlayBook, Vizio Vtab1008 and Acer Iconia Tab A500, implement HDMI using Micro-HDMI (Type D) ports. Others, such as the ASUS Eee Pad Transformer implement the standard using mini-HDMI (type C) ports. All iPad models have a special A/V adapter that converts Apple's data line to a standard HDMI (Type A) port. Samsung has a similar proprietary thirty-pin port for their Galaxy Tab 10.1 that can adapt to HDMI as well as USB drives. The Dell Streak 5 smartphone/tablet hybrid is capable of outputting over HDMI. While the Streak uses a PDMI port, a separate cradle adds HDMI compatibility. Most Chinese-made tablets running Android OS provide HDMI output using a mini-HDMI (type C) port. Most new laptops and desktops now have built in HDMI as well.\n\nMany recent mobile phones can produce output of HDMI video via either a micro-HDMI connector or MHL output. Some older phones may use SlimPort to achieve similar result.\n\nHDMI can only be used with older analog-only devices (using connections such as SCART, VGA, RCA, etc.) by means of a digital-to-analog converter or AV receiver, as the interface does not carry any analog signals (unlike DVI, where devices with DVI-I ports accept or provide either digital or analog signals). Cables are available that contain the necessary electronics, but it is important to distinguish these \"active\" converter cables from \"passive\" HDMI to VGA cables (which are typically cheaper as they don't include any electronics). The passive cables are \"only\" useful if you have a device that is generating or expecting HDMI signals on a VGA connector, or VGA signals on an HDMI connector; this is a non-standard feature, not implemented by most devices.\n\nThe HDMI Alternate Mode for USB-C allows HDMI-enabled sources with a USB-C connector to directly connect to standard HDMI display devices, without requiring an adapter. The standard was released in September 2016, and supports all HDMI 1.4b features such as video resolutions up to Ultra HD 30 Hz, and Consumer Electronic Control (CEC). Previously, the similar DisplayPort Alternate Mode could be used to connect to HDMI displays from USB Type-C sources, but where in that case, active adapters were required to convert from DisplayPort to HDMI, HDMI Alternate Mode connects to the display natively.\n\nThe Alternate Mode reconfigures the four SuperSpeed differential pairs present in USB-C to carry the three HDMI TMDS channels and the clock signal. The two Sideband Use pins (SBU1 and SBU2) are used to carry the HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel and the Hot Plug Detect functionality (HEAC+/Utility pin and HEAC−/HPD pin). As there are not enough reconfigurable pins remaining in USB-C to accommodate the DDC clock (SCL), DDC data (SDA), and CEC – these three signals are bridged between the HDMI source and sink via the USB Power Delivery 2.0 (USB-PD) protocol, and are carried over the USB-C Configuration Channel (CC) wire. This is possible because the cable is electronically marked (i.e., it contains a USB-PD node) that serves to tunnel the DDC and CEC from the source over the Configuration Channel to the node in the cable, these USB-PD messages are received and relayed to the HDMI sink as regenerated DDC (SCL and SDA signals), or CEC signals.\n\nThe DisplayPort audio/video interface was introduced in May 2006. In recent years, DisplayPort connectors have become a common feature of premium products—displays, desktop computers, and video cards; most of the companies producing DisplayPort equipment are in the computer sector. The DisplayPort website states that DisplayPort is expected to complement HDMI, but 100% of HD and UHD TVs had HDMI connectivity. DisplayPort supported some advanced features which are useful for multimedia content creators and gamers (e.g. 5K, Adaptive-Sync), which was the reason most GPUs had DisplayPort. These features were added to the official HDMI specification slightly later, but with the introduction of HDMI 2.1 these gaps are already leveled off (with e.g. VRR / Variable Refresh Rate).\n\nDisplayPort uses a self-clocking, micro-packet-based protocol that allows for a variable number of differential LVDS lanes as well as flexible allocation of bandwidth between audio and video, and allows encapsulating multi-channel compressed audio formats in the audio stream. DisplayPort 1.2 supports multiple audio/video streams, variable refresh rate (FreeSync), Display Stream Compression (DSC), and Dual-mode LVDS/TDMS transmitters compatible with HDMI 1.2 or 1.4. Revision 1.3 increases overall transmission bandwidth to 32.4Gbit/s with the new HBR3 mode featuring 8.1Gbit/s per lane; it requires Dual-mode with mandatory HDMI 2.0 compatibility and HDCP 2.2. Revision 1.4 adds support BT.2020 color space and HDR10 extensions from CTA-861.3, including static and dynamic metadata.\n\nThe DisplayPort connector is compatible with HDMI and can transmit single-link DVI and HDMI 1.2/1.4/2.0 signals using attached passive adapters or adapter cables. The source device includes a dual-mode transmitter that supports both LVDS signals for DisplayPort and TMDS signals for DVI/HDMI. The same external connector is used for both protocols - when a DVI/HDMI passive adapter is attached, the transmitter circuit switches to TDMS mode. DisplayPort Dual-mode ports and cables/adapters are typically marked with the DisplayPort++ logo. Thunderbolt ports with mDP connector also supports Dual-mode passive HDMI adapters/cables. Conversion to dual-link DVI and component video (VGA/YPbPr) requires active powered adapters.\n\nThe USB 3.1 Type-C connector is an emerging standard that replaces legacy video connectors such as mDP, Thunderbolt, HDMI, and VGA in mobile devices. USB-C connectors can transmit DisplayPort video to docks and displays using standard USB Type-C cables or Type-C to DisplayPort cables and adapters; USB-C also supports HDMI adapters that actively convert from DisplayPort to HDMI 1.4 or 2.0. DisplayPort Alternate Mode for USB Type-C specification was published in 2015. USB Type-C chipsets are not required to include Dual-mode transmitters and only support DisplayPort LVDS protocol, so passive DP-HDMI adapters do not work with Type-C sources.\n\nDisplayPort has a royalty rate of US$0.20 per unit (from patents licensed by MPEG LA), although this claim is contested, while HDMI has an annual fee of US$10,000 and a per unit royalty rate of between $0.04 and $0.15.\n\nHDMI has a few advantages over DisplayPort, such as ability to carry Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) signals, and electrical compatibility with DVI (though practically limited to single-link DVI rates). Also, HDMI can sustain full bandwidth for up to 10 meters of cable length and there are certification programs to ensure this; DisplayPort cables, conversely, don't ensure full bandwidth beyond 3 meters, however some \"active\" cables extend the distance to 15 meters at certain resolutions, and specialist \"optical\" extender solutions exists to extend distances even farther by sending the signal over fiber optic cable.\n\nMobile High-Definition Link (MHL) is an adaptation of HDMI intended to connect mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets to high-definition televisions (HDTVs) and displays. Unlike DVI, which is compatible with HDMI using only passive cables and adapters, MHL requires that the HDMI socket be MHL-enabled, otherwise an active adapter (or dongle) is required to convert the signal to HDMI. MHL is developed by a consortium of five consumer electronics manufacturers, several of which are also behind HDMI.\n\nMHL pares down the three TMDS channels in a standard HDMI connection to a single one running over any connector that provides at least five pins. This lets existing connectors in mobile devices – such as micro-USB – be used, avoiding the need for additional dedicated video output sockets. The USB port switches to MHL mode when it detects a compatible device is connected.\n\nIn addition to the features in common with HDMI (such as HDCP encrypted uncompressed high-definition video and eight-channel surround sound), MHL also adds the provision of power charging for the mobile device while in use, and also enables the TV remote to control it. Although support for these additional features requires connection to an MHL-enabled HDMI port, power charging can also be provided when using active MHL to HDMI adapters (connected to standard HDMI ports), provided there is a separate power connection to the adapter.\n\nLike HDMI, MHL defines a USB-C Alternate Mode to support the MHL standard over USB-C connections.\n\nVersion 1.0 supported 720p/1080i 60 Hz (RGB/4:4:4 pixel encoding) with a bandwidth of 2.25 Gbit/s. Versions 1.3 and 2.0 added support for 1080p 60 Hz ( 4:2:2) with a bandwidth of 3 Gbit/s in PackedPixel mode. Version 3.0 increased the bandwidth to 6 Gbit/s to support Ultra HD (3840 × 2160) 30 Hz video, and also changed from being frame-based, like HDMI, to packet-based.\n\nThe fourth version, superMHL, increased bandwidth by operating over multiple TMDS differential pairs (up to a total of six) allowing a maximum of 36 Gbit/s. The six lanes are supported over a reversible 32-pin superMHL connector, while four lanes are supported over USB-C Alternate Mode (only a single lane is supported over micro-USB/HDMI). Display Stream Compression (DSC) is used to allow up to 8K Ultra HD (7680 × 4320) 120 Hz HDR video, and to support Ultra HD 60 Hz video over a single lane.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "563962", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=563962", "title": "Hooker with a heart of gold", "text": "Hooker with a heart of gold\n\nThe hooker with a heart of gold (also the whore with a heart of gold or the tart with a heart) is a stock character involving a courtesan or prostitute with a hidden integrity and kindness. The character, traditionally female, is usually an example of irony: an allegedly immoral woman who demonstrates virtues absent in woman morally correct for the role.\n\nThis character is often a pivotal, but peripheral, character in literature and motion pictures, usually giving key advice or serving as a go-between. She is sometimes established in contrast to another female character who is morally correct but frigid or otherwise unyielding. Hookers with hearts of gold are sometimes reluctant prostitutes due to either desperation or coercion from a pimp. Or her prostitution may reflect an overall lust for life, as in Ilya in \"Never on Sunday\".\n\nThe stereotype might owe something of a debt to certain traditions surrounding the Biblical figures of Mary Magdalene (who was not a prostitute) and Rahab, or to the ancient Indian theatrical tradition of Sanskrit drama where Śudraka's play \"Mṛcchakatika\" (\"The Little Clay Cart\") featured a nagarvadhu (courtesan) with a heart of gold named Vasantasena. But this stock character is pervasive enough in various myths and cultures in the form of a tragic story of the concubine who falls in love with her patron/client or, alternatively, young and often poor lover. Therefore, this might be considered not just an archetype but also fairly universal, and somewhat indicative of various societies' complex ideas about sexual decency and moral character. A variation on the theme, the dancer (stripper) with a heart of gold, is a tamer version of the character.\n\nThe fictitious courtesan Chandramukhi (character) in Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's highly acclaimed Bengali novel Devdas has been adapted into film numerous times, most notably into Hindi in 1955 and 2002 with the character-role of \"Chandramukhi\" being played by actresses Vyjayanthimala and Madhuri Dixit, respectively. Chandramukhi (character) here fulfils Devdas' desire of feeling loved which was betrayed by Parvati (Paro).\n\nIn opera and musical theater, a hooker with a heart of gold is most often portrayed by a mezzo-soprano. (One notable exception is the heroine of Giuseppe Verdi's \"La traviata\", Violetta Valery, portrayed by a soprano.) She is portrayed in a tragic light and often dies a tragic death. Another classic example of the \"Tart with a heart\" character is the character of Nancy in Charles Dickens' novel \"Oliver Twist\" and the stage musical derived from it, \"Oliver!\".\n\nIn television history, the \"tart with a heart\" has become an important archetype in serial drama and soap opera, especially in Britain. During the 1960s, the character of Elsie Tanner in British series \"Coronation Street\" set the mold for future characters such as Bet Lynch (also \"Coronation Street\"), Kat Slater, Stacey Slater and Dawn Swann (all three characters from the British soap opera \"EastEnders\"). Characters of this nature are often depicted as having tragic lives, but put on a front when in public to create the illusion of happiness. More often than not, these female characters are vital to their respective shows, and inevitably become some of the biggest stars in British Television.\n\nThe hooker with a heart of gold is also a prominent character in many American western movies. In \"The Usual Suspects\", detective Dave Kujan says to Roger \"Verbal\" Kint: \"... so don't sell me the hooker with a heart of gold.\"\n\nThe story of Rahab in the Bible's Book of Joshua is considered by some the earliest example of this character type.\n\nIn Giuseppe Verdi's \"La Traviata\", the courtesan Violetta Valery turns to love when she meets Alfredo and subsequently sells all of her possessions to support them (unbeknownst to Alfredo). She is later persuaded to leave him by Alfredo's father Giorgio Germont in order to keep the family's nobility from falling (as her reputation has threatened his daughter's engagement). She is also coping with tuberculosis and keeps this a secret, leaving Alfredo who later comes after her.\n\nIn Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel \"Crime and Punishment\", protagonist Rodion Raskolnikov is persuaded to confess to murder by the prostitute Sonya Semyonovna Marmeladova, who consistently exhibits characteristics of the archetype throughout the novel.\n\nBertolt Brecht's play \"The Good Person of Szechwan\" features a textbook example in the form of the young Shen Te, who is rewarded by the gods at the beginning of the play upon demonstrating courtesy when nobody else does, after which she relinquishes whoredom and acquires a tobacco shop—though to ill avail.\n\nThe Marlene Dietrich role \"Shanghai Lily\" in the 1932 Pre-Code \"Shanghai Express\"\n\nTwo Shirley MacLaine roles—Ginny Moorhead in 1958's \"Some Came Running\" and Irma la Douce in 1963's \"Irma la Douce\"\n\nThe \"hooker with a heart of gold\" also appears as \"Cabiria\" (played by Giulietta Masina) in the 1957 film \"Nights of Cabiria\".\n\nThe character appears in modern action films as \"Chris\" (played by Angie Dickinson) in the 1967 action film \"Point Blank\", as \"Rosie\" (played by Maria Bello) in the 1999 re-make \"Payback\" and as \"Donna Quintano\" (played by Monica Bellucci) in \"Shoot 'Em Up\" (2007).\n\nIn modern comedy films, Jamie Lee Curtis's role in \"Trading Places\" has been called an example of this archetype, and the 1990 film \"Pretty Woman\" (starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere) is probably the most recognizable modern depiction of the 'hooker with a heart of gold'. The character \"V\", played by Melanie Griffith in the movie \"Milk Money\" could also be considered an example of this type or role.\n\n\"Moulin Rouge!\" is another modern-day film, in which the main character is a courtesan named Satine who does end up having a heart and falling in love, but ultimately (tragically) dies of tuberculosis during one of her performances and never actually gets to be with the one she truly loves.\n\nIn the 1970 highly successful Pakistani film, \"Anjuman\", Rani played the virtuous prostitute \"Anjuman\". The role was later reprised by Sara Loren, in the remake of the film in 2013.\n\nIn the 1990 film \"Pretty Woman\", Vivian Ward (played by Julia Roberts) is portrayed as a kind-hearted prostitute.\n\nA 2003 episode of \"Firefly\" titled \"Heart of Gold\" has the crew of \"Serenity\" defending a brothel called the Heart of Gold from a wealthy, misogynistic local rancher.\n\nAcclaimed Bollywood actor Rani Mukerji plays the hooker with a golden heart in three films. In \"\", she plays a compassionate courtesan. In \"Laaga Chunari Mein Daag\", she plays a lower middle class woman who turns into a high profile escort. In \"Saawariya\", Mukerji appeared in a small but highly appreciated cameo of a street-smart prostitute called Gulab.\n\nIn the 2004 Hindi film \"Chameli\", Kareena Kapoor plays the highly acclaimed golden-hearted prostitute named \"Chameli\".\n\nThe 2010 thriller miniseries \"The Hooker with a Heart of Gold\", by independent filmmaker Brad Jones, takes the proverb literally, in giving the main character – a kind-hearted prostitute simply named \"Hooker\" (played by Sarah Lewis) – a heart made of gold. In the 2011 Pakistani film \"Bol\", actress and model, Iman Ali, played the acclaimed golden-heart prostitute, named, \"Sabina (Meena)\".\n\nIn the 2012 film \"Fury\" (originally titled \"The Samaritan\") ex-con Foley (played by Samuel L. Jackson) falls in love with a disturbed but ultimately good hearted prostitute named Iris (played by Ruth Negga).\n\nIn the 2012 Bollywood film, 's main plotline involves around a prostitute, Rosie (also played by Kareena Kapoor).\n\nThe songs \"Carmen\" by Lana Del Rey and \"The A Team\" by Ed Sheeran each describe such a character.\n\nMadhuravani was a prostitute in Gurazada Apparao's popular Telugu play \"Kanyasulkam\", who was portrayed to be very progressive, opinionated and independent and played a key role in the play.\n\nIn \"Coronation Street\", the characters Elsie Tanner, Carla Connor, Bet Lynch, Raquel Watts and Leanne Battersby can be described as such stereotypes.\n\n"}

{"id": "2193186", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193186", "title": "Joe E. Ross", "text": "Joe E. Ross\n\nJoe E. Ross (born Joseph Roszawikz, March 15, 1914 – August 13, 1982) was an American actor known for his trademark \"Ooh! Ooh!\" exclamation, which he used in many of his roles. He starred in such TV sitcoms as \"The Phil Silvers Show\" and \"Car 54, Where Are You?.\"\n\nRoss was born on March 15, 1914 to Jewish immigrant parents in New York, New York. He dropped out of Seward Park High School at age 16 to become a singing waiter at the Van Cortlandt Inn in the Bronx. When the cafe added a female dancer and singer, Ross was promoted to announcer. He added some jokes and became a comedian.\n\nIn 1938, he appeared at the Queens Terrace, near Jackson Heights, New York. Jackie Gleason had already been playing there for 16 weeks, and the manager was about to ask Gleason to stay a while longer. Ross heard of the opening, auditioned for it, got the contract, and also stayed 16 weeks. Ross then turned burlesque comic on the Schuster circuit out of Chicago.\n\nHis career was interrupted by World War II. He served in the United States Army Air Corps at Camp Blanding, Florida, before being stationed in England.\n\nDischarged at the war's end, Ross became an announcer-comic at Billy Gray's Band Box in Hollywood. He kept his ties to burlesque, and appeared in Irving Klaw's feature-length theatrical film \"Teaserama\" (1955), a re-creation of a burlesque show.\n\nIn 1955, Ross worked at a nightclub in Miami Beach called Ciro's. He was spotted by Nat Hiken and Phil Silvers, who were planning \"You'll Never Get Rich\" (later known as \"The Phil Silvers Show\" and sometimes \"Sgt. Bilko\") and loved Ross's comedy skills. Ross was hired on the spot and cast as the mess sergeant, Rupert Ritzik.\nRoss made Ritzik memorable. Ritzik was henpecked, dumb, and greedy, always an easy mark for Bilko's schemes. Whenever Ritzik had a sudden inspiration, he would hesitate and stammer \"Ooh! Ooh!\" before articulating his idea. The catch phrase came from the actor's own frustration when he couldn't remember his lines. Silvers would deliberately stray from the scripted dialogue and give Ross the wrong cues, prompting a genuinely confused reaction and an agonized \"Ooh! Ooh!\" from Ross.\n\nAfter \"The Phil Silvers Show\" ended in 1959, Nat Hiken went on to produce \"Car 54, Where Are You?\" and cast Joe E. Ross as Patrolman Gunther Toody of New York's 53rd Precinct. Fred Gwynne, another \"Bilko\" alumnus, played Toody's partner, Francis Muldoon. Toody could usually be counted on at some point to say \"Ooh! Ooh!\", or \"Do you mind? Doyoumind?\". Ross became so identified with his policeman role that he recorded an album of songs entitled \"Love Songs from a Cop\". Roulette Records released the LP in 1964. Ross did the voice for Toody for the episode \"Car 54\" of Hanna-Barbera's \"Wait Till Your Father Gets Home\", in which Toody and Muldoon moonlight running a day care center and one of the children turns up missing.\n\nRoss also starred as Gronk in Sherwood Schwartz's ill-fated 1966 sitcom \"It's About Time\", which featured two 1960s American astronauts who were thrown back in time to the prehistoric era.\n\nFollowing the breakup of Allen & Rossi in 1968, Steve Rossi teamed for less than three months with Ross in an act called \"Rossi & Ross\". Rossi & Ross played once on Ed Sullivan and disbanded in January 1969.\n\nRoss also was a prominent cartoon voice into the 1970s, playing the stereotypical bumbling sergeant in many cartoons such as \"Hong Kong Phooey\" (as Sgt. Flint) and \"Help!... It's the Hair Bear Bunch!\" (as Botch). He also voiced Roll on CB Bears segment Shake, Rattle and Roll. His \"Ooh! Ooh!\" phrase was emulated by Frank Welker in the animated series \"Fangface\". He was also one of the few white comedians with 1970's label Laff Records, which specialized in African-American comedians and released his album \"Should Lesbians Be Allowed to Play Pro-Football?\".\n\nRoss was often known as a difficult person to work with. Co-workers complained that he was continually vulgar, even cursing around children. Others, however, called him \"a man of sweet character\".\n\nRoss died of a heart attack on August 13, 1982 while performing in the clubhouse of his apartment building in Los Angeles, The Oakwood Apartments. He was buried in Forest Lawn-Hollywood Hills Cemetery. Jay Leno delivered the eulogy. Ross' gravestone is inscribed with the double entendre \"This man had a ball\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25328283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25328283", "title": "Laughter (book)", "text": "Laughter (book)\n\nLaughter is a collection of three essays by French philosopher Henri Bergson, first published in 1900. It was written in French, the original title is \"Le Rire. Essai sur la signification du comique\" (\"Laughter, an essay on the meaning of the comic\").\n\nThe three essays were first published in the French review \"Revue de Paris\". A book was published in 1924 by the Alcan publishing house. It was reprinted in 1959 by the Presses Universitaires de France, on the occasion of the hundredth anniversary of the birth of Bergson.\n\nIn a foreword published in 1900, but suppressed in 1924, Bergson explains that through the three articles, he wanted to study laughter, especially the laughter caused by the comic, and to determine the principal categories of comic situations, to determine the laws of the comic. He also added a list of works and studies about laughter and the comic.\n\nIn the preface written in 1924 to replace the initial foreword, Bergson explains that his method is entirely new because it consists in determining the process of the comic instead of analyzing the effects of the comic. He specifies that his method does not contradict the results of the other one, but he assumes that it is more rigorous from a scientific point of view. He adds a larger bibliography.\n\nThe first essay is made up of three parts:\n\nIn a short introduction, Bergson announces that he will try to define the comic, but he does not want to give a rigid definition of the word; he wants to deal with the comic as part of human life. His ambition is also to have a better knowledge of society, of the functioning of human imagination and of collective imagination, but also of art and life.\n\nGeneral facts on the comic\n\nBergson begins to note three facts on the comic:\n\nThe social role of laughter\n\nBergson now assumes that the comic requires the use of intelligence instead of sensibility, and he tries to determine what is the real role of intelligence in a comic situation. He takes the example of a man falling down in the street in front of passers-by. Laughter is caused by an accidental situation, caused by a movement. The source of the comic is the presence of a rigidity in life. Life is defined by Bergson a perpetual movement, it is characterized by flexibility and agility. Comic situations, such as that of a falling man, are situations where movement is not flexible.\n\nHowever, the comic is not only based upon unusual situations, but also upon characters and individuals. Bergson takes the example of absent-minded people, a common source of comedy. People tend to associate individuals with a comic character, which increases the comic. In addition, when we make fun of somebody for one of his vices, it is because the individual is unaware of his own vice while we are aware of it. Thus laughter forces people to be better and to suppress their vices, because laughter makes them be conscious of them. This is why Bergson asserts that laughter has a moral role, it is a factor of uniformity of behaviours, it eliminates ludicrous and eccentric attitudes : « Beyond actions and attitudes that are automatically punished by their natural consequences, there remains a certain inflexibility of the body, of the mind and of the character that society would like to eliminate to obtain a greater elasticity and a better sociability of its members. This inflexibility is the comic, laughter is the punishment ».\n\nComic and forms of materiality\n\nLaughter can be caused by ugliness, but ugliness is not always comic. To laugh about ugliness, we need to have a naive, immediate, original approach, not to think. We also have to focus on a specific feature of the person and to associate the person with this feature. It is the same with cartoonists, who exaggerate physical and natural features of people. Our imagination sees in everyone the efforts of the soul to dynamise materiality, the soul or the mind give flexibility, agility and animation to the rigid body and to materiality. However the body tends to rigidify itself, and it produces a comic effect: « When materiality succeeds in fixing the movement of the soul, in hindering its grace, it obtains a comic effect. To define comic in comparison to its contrary, we should oppose it to grace instead of beauty. It is stiffness rather than ugliness ».\n\nComic of gesture and movements\n\nBergson concludes as an immediate consequence of the previous chapter that « attitudes, gestures and movements of the human body are subject to laughter precisely in the way that body makes us think to a simple machine ». Humans tend to laugh when they see the effect of a machine within the human body. This is why when we concentrate our attention on a particular gesture made by a speaker to better express his thinking, we automatically find it comic whereas this movement in itself is not comic. We also laugh when someone imitates somebody else, because to imitate somebody, the imitator reproduces the most mechanical, the most unconscious movements and gestures of the person. This is also the case with the parody of an activity. For Bergson, this explains also why, as Pascal had noted, when we see two faces that look like very much, we find it comic, while the faces alone are not comic. And finally: « This is because really lively life is not supposed to repeat itself. Where there is repetition, complete similarity, we suspect that there is mechanism behind life. That diversion of life towards mechanism is the real cause of laughter. »\n\nThe comic and human imagination\n\nAt the beginning of chapter five, Bergson thinks again about his method of analysis. He recalls that to look for a unique method of the comic does not make sense. However, there is a central cause of the comic, and all comic situations are derived from it. This central cause is mechanism applied to life, and all comic effects are articulated around this cause by our imagination. There are three main directions in which our imagination is oriented to produce comic effects, three general laws:\n\n"}

The show is presented by its creator, Klaus-Jürgen \"Knacki\" Deuser, along with \"house band\" Alex Flucht on guitar. The show is well-known due to a number of famous German stand-up comedians making their first appearances there, and it is generally considered an important step in the career of a comedian to perform at Nightwash.\n\nThe original show was started in 2000 as an open-mic night, to give stage time to new stand-up comedians - due to stand-up comedy being a fairly new form in Germany, very few open-mic nights existed at that time. The show was originally sited in a Laundromat, as it was thought that this would give the show a captive audience, due to people waiting for their washing to finish.

{"id": "2101713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2101713", "title": "Pantomime", "text": "Pantomime\n\nPantomime (; informally panto) is a type of musical comedy stage production designed for family entertainment. It was developed in England and is still performed throughout the United Kingdom and (to a lesser extent) in other English-speaking countries, especially during the Christmas and New Year season. Modern pantomime includes songs, gags, slapstick comedy and dancing. It employs gender-crossing actors and combines topical humour with a story more or less based on a well-known fairy tale, fable or folk tale. It is a participatory form of theatre, in which the audience is expected to sing along with certain parts of the music and shout out phrases to the performers.\n\nPantomime has a long theatrical history in Western culture dating back to classical theatre. It developed partly from the 16th century commedia dell'arte tradition of Italy and other European and British stage traditions, such as 17th-century masques and music hall. An important part of the pantomime, until the late 19th century, was the harlequinade.\n\nOutside Britain, the word \"pantomime\" is often understood to mean miming, rather than the theatrical form discussed here.\n\nThe word pantomime was adopted from the Latin word \"pantomimus\", which in turn derives from the Greek word \"παντόμιμος\" (\"pantomimos\"), consisting of \"παντο-\" (\"panto-\") meaning \"all\", and \"μῖμος\" (\"mimos\"), meaning a dancer who acted all the roles or all the story. The Roman pantomime drew upon the Greek tragedy and other Greek genres from its inception, although the art was instituted in Rome and little is known of it in pre-Roman Greece. The English word came to be applied to the performance itself. According to a lost oration by Aelius Aristides, the pantomime was known for its erotic content and the effeminacy of its dancing; Aristides's work was responded to by Libanius, in his oration \"On Behalf of the Dancers\", written probably around 361 AD.\n\nRoman pantomime was a production, usually based upon myth or legend, for a solo male dancer—clad in a long silk tunic and a short mantle (\"pallium\") that was often used as a \"prop\"—accompanied by a sung \"libretto\" (called the \"fabula saltica\" or \"dance-story\") rendered by a singer or chorus (though Lucian states that originally the pantomime himself was the singer). Music was supplied by flute and the pulse of an iron-shod shoe called a scabellum. Performances might be in a private household, with minimal personnel, or else lavish theatrical productions involving a large orchestra and chorus and sometimes an ancillary actor. The dancer danced all the roles, relying on masks, stock poses and gestures and a hand-language (cheironomy) so complex and expressive that the pantomime's hands were commonly compared to an eloquent mouth. Pantomime differed from mime by its more artistic nature and relative lack of farce and coarse humour, though these were not absent from some productions.\n\nRoman pantomime was immensely popular from the end of the first century BC until the end of the sixth century AD, a form of entertainment that spread throughout the empire where, because of its wordless nature, it did more than any other art to foster knowledge of the myths and Roman legends that formed its subject-matter – tales such as those of the love of Venus and Mars and of Dido and Aeneas – while in Italy its chief exponents were celebrities, often the protegés of influential citizens, whose followers wore badges proclaiming their allegiance and engaged in street-fights with rival groups, while its accompanying songs became widely known. Yet, because of the limits imposed upon Roman citizens' dance, the populism of its song-texts and other factors, the art was as much despised as adored, and its practitioners were usually slaves or freedmen.\n\nBecause of the low status and the disappearance of its \"libretti\", the Roman pantomime received little modern scholarly attention until the late 20th century, despite its great influence upon Roman culture as perceived in Roman art, in statues of famous dancers, graffiti, objects and literature. After the renaissance of classical culture, Roman pantomime was a decisive influence upon modern European concert dance, helping to transform ballet from a mere entertainment, a display of technical virtuosity, into the dramatic ballet d'action. It became an antecedent which, through writers and ballet-masters of the 17th and 18th centuries such as Claude-François Ménestrier (1631–1705), John Weaver (1673–1760), Jean-Georges Noverre (1727–1810) and Gasparo Angiolini (1731–1803), earned it respectability and attested to the capability of dance to render complex stories and express human emotion.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the Mummers Play was a traditional English folk play, based loosely on the Saint George and the Dragon legend, usually performed during Christmas gatherings, which contained the origin of many of the archetypal elements of the pantomime, such as stage fights, coarse humour and fantastic creatures, gender role reversal, and good defeating evil. Precursors of pantomime also included the masque, which grew in pomp and spectacle from the 15th to the 17th centuries.\n\nThe development of English pantomime was also strongly influenced by the continental \"commedia dell'arte\", a form of popular theatre that arose in Italy in the Early Modern Period. This was a \"comedy of professional artists\" travelling from province to province in Italy and then France, who improvised and told comic stories that held lessons for the crowd, changing the main character depending on where they were performing. Each \"scenario\" used some of the same stock characters. These included the \"innamorati\" (young lovers); the \"vecchi\" (old men) such as Pantalone; and \"zanni\" (servants) such as Arlecchino, Colombina, Scaramouche and Pierrot. Italian masque performances in the 17th century sometimes included the Harlequin character.\n\nIn the 17th century, adaptations of the commedia characters became familiar in English entertainments. From these, the standard English harlequinade developed, depicting the eloping lovers Harlequin and Columbine, pursued by the girl's father Pantaloon and his comic servants Clown and Pierrot. In English versions, by the 18th century, Harlequin became the central figure and romantic lead. The basic plot of the harlequinade remained essentially the same for more than 150 years, except that a bumbling policeman was added to the chase.\n\nIn the first two decades of the 18th century, two rival London theatres, Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre and the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane (the patent theatres) presented productions that began seriously with classical stories that contained elements of opera and ballet and ended with a comic \"night scene\". \"Tavern Bilkers\", by John Weaver, the dancing master at Drury Lane, is cited as the first pantomime produced on the English stage. This production was not a success, and Weaver waited until 1716 to produce his next pantomimes, including \"The Loves of Mars and Venus – a new Entertainment in Dancing after the manner of the Antient Pantomimes\". The same year he produced a pantomime on the subject of \"Perseus and Andromeda\". After this, pantomime was regular feature at Drury Lane. In 1717 at Lincoln's Inn, actor and manager John Rich introduced Harlequin into the theatres' pantomimes under the name of \"Lun\" (for \"lunatic\"). He gained great popularity for his pantomimes, especially beginning with his 1724 production of \"The Necromancer; or, History of Dr. Faustus\".\n\nThese early pantomimes were silent, or \"dumb show\", performances consisting of only dancing and gestures. Spoken drama was allowed in London only in the two (later three) patent theatres until Parliament changed this restriction in 1843. A large number of French performers played in London following the suppression of unlicensed theatres in Paris. Although this constraint was only temporary, English pantomimes remained primarily visual for some decades before dialogue was introduced. An 18th-century author wrote of David Garrick: \"He formed a kind of harlequinade, very different from that which is seen at the Opéra-Comique in Paris, where harlequin and all the characters speak.\" The majority of these early pantomimes were re-tellings of a story from ancient Greek or Roman literature, with a break between the two acts during which the harlequinade's zany comic business was performed. The theatre historian David Mayer explains the use of the \"batte\" or slapstick and the transformation scene that led to the harlequinade:\n\nPantomime gradually became more topical and comic, often involving spectacular and elaborate theatrical effects as far as possible. Colley Cibber, David Garrick and others competed with Rich and produced their own pantomimes, and pantomime continued to grow in popularity.\n\nBy the early 1800s, the pantomime's classical stories were often supplanted by stories adapted from European fairy tales, fables, folk tales, classic English literature or nursery rhymes. Also, the harlequinade grew in importance until it often was the longest and most important part of the entertainment. Pantomimes usually had dual titles that gave an often humorous idea of both the pantomime story and the harlequinade. \"Harlequin and ________\", or \"Harlequin _______; or, the ________\". In the second case, harlequin was used as an adjective, followed by words that described the pantomime \"opening\", for example: \"Harlequin Cock Robin and Jenny Wren; or, Fortunatus and the Water of Life, the Three Bears, the Three Gifts, the Three Wishes, and the Little Man who Woo'd the Little Maid\". Harlequin was the first word (or the first word after the \"or\") because Harlequin was initially the most important character. The titles continued to include the word Harlequin even after the first decade of the 1800s, when Joseph Grimaldi came to dominate London pantomime and made the character, Clown, a colourful agent of chaos, as important in the entertainment as Harlequin. At the same time, Harlequin began to be portrayed in a more romantic and stylised way.\n\nGrimaldi's performances elevated the role by \"acute observation upon the foibles and absurdities of society, and his happy talent of holding them up to ridicule. He is the finest practical satyrist that ever existed. ... He was so extravagantly natural, that the most saturnine looker-on acknowledged his sway; and neither the wise, the proud, or the fair, the young nor the old, were ashamed to laugh till tears coursed down their cheeks at Joe and his comicalities.\" Grimaldi's performances were important in expanding the importance of the harlequinade until it dominated the pantomime entertainment.\n\nBy the 1800s, therefore, children went to the theatre around the Christmas and New Year holiday (and often at Easter or other times) primarily to witness the craziness of the harlequinade chase scene. It was the most exciting part of the \"panto\", because it was fast-paced and included spectacular scenic magic as well as slapstick comedy, dancing and acrobatics. The presence of slapstick in this part of the show evolved from the characters found in Italian commedia dell'arte. The plot of the harlequinade was relatively simple; the star-crossed lovers, Harlequin and Columbine, run away from Columbine's foolish father, Pantaloon, who is being slowed down in his pursuit of them by his servant, Clown, and by a bumbling policeman. After the time of Grimaldi, Clown became the principal schemer trying to thwart the lovers, and Pantaloon was merely his assistant.\n\nThe opening \"fairy story\" was often blended with a story about a love triangle: a \"cross-grained\" old father who owns a business and whose pretty daughter is pursued by two suitors. The one she loves is poor but worthy, while the father prefers the other, a wealthy fop. Another character is a servant in the father's establishment. Just as the daughter is to be forcibly wed to the fop, or just as she was about to elope with her lover, the good fairy arrives. This was followed by what was often the most spectacular part of the production, the magical transformation scene. In early pantomimes, Harlequin possessed magical powers that he used to help himself and his love interest escape. He would tap his wooden sword (a derivative of the Commedia dell'arte slapstick or \"batte\") on the floor or scenery to make a grand transition of the world around him take place. The scene would switch from being inside some house or castle to, generally speaking, the streets of the town with storefronts as the backdrop. The transformation sequence was presided over by a Fairy Queen or Fairy Godmother character. The good fairy magically transformed the leads from the opening fairy story into their new identities as the harlequinade characters. Following is an example of the speech that the fairy would give during this transformation:\n\n<poem>Lovers stand forth. With you we shall begin.\nYou will be fair Columbineyou Harlequin.\nKing Jamie there, the bonnie Scottish loon,\nWill be a famous cheild for Pantaloon.\nThough Guy Fawkes now is saved from rocks and axe,\nI think he should pay the powder-tax.\nHis guyish plots blown upnay, do not frown;\nYou've always been a guynow be a Clown.</poem>\nThis passage is from a pantomime adaptation of the Guy Fawkes story. The fairy creates the characters of the harlequinade in the most typical fashion of simply telling the characters what they will change into. The principal male and female characters from the beginning plotline, often both played by young women, became the lovers Columbine and Harlequin, the mother or father of Columbine became Pantaloon, and the servant or other comic character became Clown. They would transition into the new characters as the scenery around them changed and would proceed in the \"zany fun\" section of the performance. From the time of Grimaldi, Clown would see the transformed setting and cry: \"Here We Are Again!\" The harlequinade began with various chase scenes, in which Harlequin and Columbine manage to escape from the clutches of Clown and Pantaloon, despite the acrobatic leaps of the former through windows, atop ladders, often because of well-meaning but misguided actions of the policeman. Eventually, there was a \"dark scene\", such as a cave or forest, in which the lovers were caught, and Harlequin's magic wand was seized from his grasp by Clown, who would flourish it in triumph. The good fairy would then reappear, and once the father agreed to the marriage of the young lovers, she would transport the whole company to a grand final scene.\n\nDespite its visible decline by 1836, the pantomime still fought to stay alive. After 1843, when theatres other than the original patent theatres were permitted to perform spoken dialogue, the importance of the silent harlequinade began to decrease, while the importance of the fairy-tale part of the pantomime increased. Two writers who helped to elevate the importance and popularity of the fairy-tale portion of the pantomime were James Planché and Henry James Byron. They emphasized puns and humorous word play, a tradition that continues in pantomime today. As manager of Drury Lane in the 1870s, Augustus Harris wrote a series of extraordinarily popular pantomimes, focusing on the spectacle of the productions, that pushed this transition by emphasizing comic business in the pantomime opening and grand processionals. By the end of the 19th century, the harlequinade had become merely a brief epilogue to the pantomime, dwindling into a brief display of dancing and acrobatics. It lingered for a few decades longer but finally disappeared, although a few of its comic elements had been incorporated into the pantomime stories. The last harlequinade was played at the Lyceum Theatre in 1939.\n\nTraditionally performed at Christmas and afterwards, with family audiences, British pantomime continues as a popular form of theatre, incorporating song, dance, buffoonery, slapstick, cross-dressing, in-jokes, topical references, audience participation, and mild sexual innuendo.\n\nPantomime story lines and scripts usually make no direct reference to Christmas, and are almost always based on traditional children's stories, particularly the fairy tales of Charles Perrault, Joseph Jacobs, Hans Christian Andersen and the Grimm Brothers. Some of the most popular pantomime stories include \"Cinderella\", \"Aladdin\", \"Dick Whittington and His Cat\" and \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", as well as \"Jack and the Beanstalk\", \"Peter Pan\", \"Puss in Boots\" and \"Sleeping Beauty\". Other traditional stories include \"Mother Goose\", \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"Robinson Crusoe\", \"The Wizard of Oz\", \"Babes in the Wood\" (combined with elements of \"Robin Hood\"), \"Little Red Riding Hood\", \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\", \"Sinbad\", \"St. George and the Dragon\", \"Bluebeard\", \"The Little Mermaid\" and \"Thumbelina\". Prior to about 1870, many other stories were made into pantomimes.\n\nWhile the familiarity of the audience with the original children's story is generally assumed, plot lines are almost always adapted for comic or satirical effect, and characters and situations from other stories are often interpolated into the plot. For instance \"panto\" versions of \"Aladdin\" may include elements from \"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves\" or other \"Arabian Nights\" tales; while \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" might include references to nursery rhymes and other children's stories involving characters called \"Jack\", such as \"Jack and Jill\". Certain familiar scenes tend to recur, regardless of plot relevance, and highly unlikely resolution of the plot is common. Straight retellings of the original stories are rare.\n\nThe form has a number of conventions, some of which have changed or weakened a little over the years, and by no means all of which are obligatory. Some of these conventions were once common to other genres of popular theatre such as melodrama.\n\nAnother contemporary pantomime tradition is the celebrity guest star, a practice that dates back to the late 19th century, when Augustus Harris, proprietor of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, hired well-known variety artists for his pantomimes.\n\nMany modern pantomimes use popular artists to promote the pantomime, and the play is often adapted to allow the star to showcase their well-known act, even when such a spot has little relation to the plot. As critic Michael Billington has explained, if the star enters into the spirit of the entertainment, he or she can add to its overall effect, while if it becomes a \"showcase for a star\" who \"stands outside the action\", the celebrity's presence can detract, notwithstanding the marketing advantage that the star brings to the piece. Billington said that Ian McKellen in a 2004 \"Aladdin\" \"lets down his hair and lifts up his skirt to reveal a nifty pair of legs and an appetite for \"double entendre\": when told by decorators that 'your front porch could do with a good lick', McKellen adopts a suitable look of mock-outrage. ... At least we can tell our grandchildren that we saw McKellen's Twankey and it was huge.\"\n\nThe main roles within pantomime are usually as follows:\n\nPantomime is performed in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Bermuda, Australasia, Canada, Zimbabwe, Jamaica, South Africa, India, Gibraltar, and Malta, mostly during the Christmas and New Year season.\n\nMany theatres in cities and towns throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland continue to have an annual professional pantomime. Pantomime is also very popular with amateur dramatics societies throughout the UK and Ireland, and the pantomime season (roughly speaking, late November to February) will see pantomime productions in many village halls and similar venues across the country.\n\nPantomimes in Australia at Christmas were once very popular, but the genre has declined greatly since the middle of the 20th century. Several later professional productions did not recover their costs.\n\nChristmas pantomimes are performed yearly at the Hudson Village Theatre in Quebec. Since 1996, Ross Petty Productions has staged pantomimes at Toronto's Elgin Theatre each Christmas season. Pantomimes imported from England were produced at the Royal Alexandra Theatre in the 1980s. The White Rock Players Club in White Rock, BC have presented an annual pantomime in the Christmas season since 1954. The Royal Canadian Theatre Company produces pantomimes in British Columbia, written by Ellie King.\n\nPantomime was imported for a British expatriate audience and later adapted by Maltese producers for Maltese audiences. While in many former territories of the British empire, pantomime declined in popularity after independence, as it was seen as a symbol of colonial rule, studies have shown that this genre remains strong in Malta.\n\nThe National Pantomime of Jamaica was started in 1941 by educators Henry Fowler and Greta Fowler, pioneers of the Little Theatre Movement in Jamaica. Among the first players was Louise Bennett-Coverley. Other notable players have included Oliver Samuels, Charles Hyatt, Willard White, Rita Marley and Dawn Penn. The annual pantomime opens on Boxing Day at the Little Theatre in Kingston and is strongly influenced by aspects of Jamaican culture, folklore and history.\n\nPantomime has seldom been performed in the United States, although a few productions have been mounted in recent years. As a consequence, Americans commonly understand the word \"pantomime\" to refer to the art of mime as it was practised, for example, by Marcel Marceau and Nola Rae. However, certain shows that came from the pantomime traditions, especially \"Peter Pan\", are performed quite often, and a few American theatre companies produce traditional British-style pantomime as well as American adaptations of the form.\n\nAccording to Professor Russell A. Peck of the University of Rochester, the earliest pantomime productions in the US were \"Cinderella\" pantomime productions in New York in March 1808, New York again in August 1808, Philadelphia in 1824, and Baltimore in 1839. A production at Olympic Theatre in New York of \"Humpty Dumpty\" ran for at least 943 performances between 1868 and 1873, (one source says 1,200 performances), becoming the longest-running pantomime in history.\n\nIn 1993 there was a production of \"Cinderella\" at the UCLA Freud Theatre, starring Zsa Zsa Gabor. Stages Repertory Theatre in Houston, Texas, has been performing original pantomime-style musicals during the Christmas holidays since 2008. Lythgoe Family Productions has produced pantomimes each winter since 2010 in California.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a prequel to Seth Grahame-Smith's 2009 novel \"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\", focusing on \"the early life and training of Elizabeth Bennet, heroine of the earlier \"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\" as she strove to become a gifted zombie hunter, with some mishaps in her early romantic encounters also included.\" It was first published by Quirk Books on March 23, 2010.\n\nSet four years before the events described in \"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\", the novel takes place in an alternate universe version of Regency era England where zombies are a well-known menace spawned by an event known as The Troubles.\n\nAfter attending a funeral in which a zombie rises from his coffin, Mr. Bennet decides that he must finally keep an old promise to train his five daughters in the art of zombie-killing. To this end, he turns the family's greenhouse into a dojo and hires young martial-arts expert Master Hawksworth to teach the girls. Meanwhile, a scientist named Dr. Keckilpenny arrives in the area with the dream of studying and possibly domesticating the zombies. As the zombie plague continues to spread across England, Hawksworth and Keckilpenny compete for Elizabeth's affections while Mrs. Bennet plots to find suitably wealthy suitors for both Elizabeth and her older sister Jane. In a bid to get reinforcements against the plague, Jane becomes the bodyguard of Lord Lumpley, a fat, lazy nobleman with low moral standards.

They are contrasted with amusement with prize machines which, while interactive, do not depend on the player's skill in determining outcome.\n\nSWP machines are a hybrid of games of skill and games of chance; the degree to which skill versus chance determines the outcome varies between machines, and may be set by operator parameters.\n\nStacker is a common free-standing merchandiser SWP machine.\nIn the United Kingdom, the most common class of SWP machines are quiz machines, on such platforms as the itbox, and are widely found in public houses. Indeed, \"quiz machine\" is often used interchangeably with \"SWP\" for such counter-top machines, though not all games on these devices are quiz-based: other games include \"Crystal Maze,\" based on The Crystal Maze, and Word Up.\nAnother class of SWP machines are free-standing machines, generally found in video arcades. These are frequently merchandisers – devices containing prizes – most commonly claw cranes, and more recently Stacker. Other examples include Barber Cut and Barber Cut Lite by Namco Bandai Games.\nThere are also a number of SWP games specific to Japan, such as \"Move Sector\" and \"Ring Magician\". Another class are redemption games, which rather than containing prizes, instead dispense tickets which can be redeemed for prizes. Some machines, such as Flamin' Finger and Stacker, can be configured as either merchandisers or redemption games.\n\nSWP machines are generally intended to be profitable for the operator in their own right, rather than as loss leaders; sample economics are given in reference. For example, \"Barber Cut\" is advertised as \"more addicting than any other prize redemption game, and those repeat-plays will land right in your cash box!\"\n\nA problem that some vendors identify is that players may be \"skeptical of any chance at winning\", since many SWP games can be and are rigged to only provide payout a fraction of the time;\nthus evidence that suggests that a prize has been won \"convinces players that it is actually possible to win.\"\n\nWhile SWP machines are generally not intended to be winnable by skilled players – otherwise such a player could continue to play and win and causes losses to the operator – it is sometimes possible that player skill, or using the machine in a way not anticipated by the manufacturer, can result in the game becoming winnable. This may result in service updates by the manufacturer to close the exploit. Other methods to minimize losses are discussed at claw cranes.\n\nSWP machines are in a legal gray area in the United States, due to containing elements of skill and of chance, particularly since payout percentages can to a large extent be set by the operator – such setting leads to machines being described as rigged. They are generally regulated separately from games of pure chance such as slot machines; see claw vending machine: legality for statutes pertaining to claw machines. (They are legal and regulated in the United Kingdom, for example).\n\nClaims of being largely or entirely skill-based can expose the operator to accusation of unfair practices; thus some lawyers advise operators to not advertise the machines as being skill-based.\n\nAs of November 1st 2010, all UK SWP machines must adhere to strict guidelines set down by BACTA (British Amusement & Catering Trade Association) & the gambling commission. These guidelines state that there must be no element of chance within the game that can affect the outcome. There are also limits set on the level of skill needed to play, for example there must be a minimum amount of time for a player to react to the game. This ensures that manufacturers & operators cannot be accused of setting physically impossible skill levels.\n\n"}
{"id": "227135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=227135", "title": "Stage combat", "text": "Stage combat\n\nStage combat or fight choreography is a specialised technique in theatre designed to create the illusion of physical combat without causing harm to the performers. It is employed in live stage plays as well as operatic and ballet productions. With the advent of cinema and television the term has widened to also include the choreography of filmed fighting sequences, as opposed to the earlier live performances on stage. It is closely related to the practice of stunts and is a common field of study for actors. Actors famous for their stage fighting skills frequently have backgrounds in dance or martial arts training.\n\nThe history of stage fighting and mock combat can be traced to antiquity, with Aristotle quoted as noting that tragedy is conflict between people or indeed it may be traced to the origins of the human species and primate display behaviour. Display of martial aptitude is a natural occurrence in warrior societies, and ritualized forms of mock combat often evolve into war dances. Whether it is the struggle between the men and women of Aristophanes' Lysistrata in Ancient Greece or Ancient Egypt where Herodotus in his Histories talks about a religious festival in which they beat each other with staves but no one dies, staged combat has always existed. As it doesn't make sense to sacrifice citizens in rituals, many ancient civilizations turned to symbolic gestures of combat through dancing or bringing a weapon to someone's throat or neck without actually touching them to symbolize death or an act of violence.\n\nFights staged for entertainment may also be in earnest for the combatants, as was the case with the Roman gladiators, and any public duel, such as the judicial duel of the European Middle Ages. The medieval tournament and joust are a classical examples of competitive ritualised mock combat. The joust from the time of Maximilian I developed into a sport with enormous cost involved for each knight and correspondingly high prestige attached, comparable to contemporary Formula One races, while at the same time minimizing the danger of injury with highly specialized equipment.\n\nIn the Late Middle Ages, staged fencing bouts, with or without choreography, became popular with fencing schools. Some German fechtbuch (\"combat manuals\", literally 'fight' or 'fence book') have sections dedicated to flamboyant techniques to be employed in such \"Klopffechten\" (\"knockabout fighting\"), which would be impractical in serious combat, and the Late Medieval German masters distinguish mock fights (\"fechten zu schimpf\", 'rant fighting') and real combat (\"fechten zu ernst\", 'earnest fighting').\n\nThe history of European theatrical combat has its roots in medieval theatre, and becomes tangible in Elizabethan drama. Richard Tarleton, who was a member of both William Shakespeare's acting company and of the London Masters of Defence weapons guild, was among the first fight directors in the modern sense. Sword duels depicted in plays showed how popular the pastime was in actual life. Before 1615 in England, many plays featured duels and the duels were regarded as highlights of the show. As opposed to after 1615, when dueling was publicly condemned by King James and the duels were used as a last resort in regards to the plot.\n\nDuring the late 17th and early 18th centuries, stylized stage combat has been a staple feature of traditional performing arts for centuries, such as in Japanese \"Kabuki\" theater (as \"tachimawari\" \"fighting scenes\"), Chinese Beijing Opera and Indian theater.\n\nFencing masters in Europe began to research and experiment with historical fencing techniques, with weapons such as the two-handed sword, rapier and smallsword, and to instruct actors in their use. Notable amongst these were George Dubois, a Parisian fight director and martial artist who created performance fencing styles based on gladiatorial combat as well as Renaissance rapier and dagger fencing. Egerton Castle and Captain Alfred Hutton of London were also involved both in reviving antique fencing systems and in teaching these styles to actors.\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, scenes of swordplay in touring theatrical productions throughout Europe, the British Commonwealth and the USA were typically created by combining several widely known, generic routines known as \"standard combats\", identified by names such as the \"Round Eights\" and the \"Glasgow Tens\".\n\nCinematic fencing has its roots in the 1920s, with the movies of Douglas Fairbanks. One of the more celebrated fight directors who emerged in this time was Paddy Crean who revolutionized stage combat, specifically sword play, for the silver screen and theater. Paddy created the flamboyant style of sword play that can be seen in Errol Flynn movies, among others. He promoted the use of safety above all things and then focused on story of the fight. B. H. Barry and J. Allen Suddeth, students of Paddy Crean, are two fight masters who have continued developing Paddy's legacy. Barry helped found the Society of British Fight Directors and then came to the United States to give fight direction a more specific shape. J. Allen Suddeth founded the National Fight Directors Training Program in the United States and wrote the book \"Fight Direction for the Theater\" (1996). Martial arts movies emerge as a distinct genre from the 1940s, popularized by Bruce Lee and Sonny Chiba from the 1960s.\n\nInformal guilds of fight choreographers began to take shape in the 1970s with the establishment of The Society of British Fight Directors, 1969 to 1996. Training was established in the United States with the formation of the Society of American Fight Directors in 1977.\n\nFollowing this, further academies and associations worldwide have been established to uphold the craft, training and quality of work in the art-form of stage combat nationally and internationally, including: The British Academy Of Stage & Screen Combat (BASSC) and Fight Directors Canada (FDC) in 1993; the Society of Australian Fight Directors Inc. (SAFDi) in 1994; the Nordic Stage Fight Society (NSFS) and the New Zealand Stage Combat Society in 1995; the British Academy of Dramatic Combat (BADC) in 1996; Art of Combat in 1997; Stage Combat Deutschland in 2004; and the Australian Stage Combat Association (ASCA) in 2010; The British Guild of Stage Combat in 2015. As of 2005, East 15 Acting School, London offered a B.A. (Hons) Degree in \"Acting & Stage Combat.\" Many of the societies offer certification programs for different weapons, which is used as an indicator about how much training an actor has had.\n\nStage combat training includes unarmed combat skills such as illusory slaps, punches, kicks, throwing and holding techniques; theatrical adaptations of various forms of fencing such as rapier and dagger, smallsword and broadsword, as well as the use of other weapons, notably the quarterstaff and knives; and more specialized skills such as professional wrestling and different styles of martial arts. However, stage combat can include any form of choreographed violence and the options are limited only by safety concerns, and the ability of the participants involved. As a note, most of these techniques are drawn from actual fighting techniques, but modified to be safer for actors. For example, although there are a number of ways of creating the safe illusion of a slap to the face (which is obviously something that could really be done in combat), none of these involve making actual contact with the victim's face.\n\nThe over-riding concern is for the safety of the actors and audience. This requirement has led to the adaptation of many standard martial arts and fencing skills specifically for performance. For example, many basic sword attacks and parries must be modified to ensure that the actors do not bring the points of their weapons past their partner's face or otherwise inadvertently risk the other actor's health and well-being. Attacking actions in stage combat are extended past the performance partner's body, or aimed short of their apparent targets. Likewise, whereas their characters may be trying to violently twist each other's limbs, slap, or punch, or grapple, and engaging in vicious unarmed combat, the actors must operate at a high level of complicity and communication to ensure a safe, exciting fight scene. In many forms of stage combat, distance is a key factor in technique. Many attacks are performed 'out of distance' so that there is no possible chance of one performer accidentally striking the other. Considerable professional judgement is called upon to determine what technical level may be appropriate for a given performer, taking into account allotted rehearsal time, and the expectations of the director.\n\nAnother important element of stage combat is sound. Sound increases the believability of an action for the audience. There are two kinds of sounds that can be made. One is vocal reactions. By adding a gasp, groan, or grunt when struck, the combatants make the moves come to life. The other kind of sound is a knap or a percussive sound made by hitting a resonant part of the body. This is timed to the moment an impact would happen and is staged so it is hidden from the audience. This allows the audience to believe that an actual blow or slap has landed because they hear a corresponding sound and see a reaction. \n\nThe combat phase of a play rehearsal is referred to as a \"fight rehearsal\". Choreography is typically learned step by step, and practiced at first very slowly before increasing to a speed that is both dramatically convincing and safe for the performers and their audience. Even stage combat is risky, and it is preferable for actors to have as much training and experience as possible. A \"fight call\" or a brief rehearsal before the show is performed each time, set aside for the actors to \"mark\" through the fight to increase their muscle memory. A show which involves fight choreography will typically be trained and supervised by a professional fight choreographer and may also include a \"fight captain\", who runs fight calls and ensures that actors are remaining safe throughout the duration of the show. \n\nThe fighting styles in movies set in the Medieval or Renaissance period may be unrealistic and historically inaccurate. Most fight choreographers use a mix between Asian martial arts and sports fencing to re-enact fight scenes. This generally due to the look of the fighting asked for by the director. If the director wants the story to flow a certain way, then the fight director will choreograph the fights to fit that style and tell the story.\n\nFor stage combat, all edges should be dulled and points blunted so that there is no risk of severe injury if someone is accidentally stabbed. In addition, weapons that are used, and not just for show, should be certified as combat-ready, thereby preventing any accidents involving blades accidentally breaking off.\nUsed in shows that are performed in large playing spaces due to the large size of the weapon. Most popular quarterstaff fight is that between Robin Hood and Little John in the tale of Robin Hood from the 17th century ballad. Modern quarterstaff choreography has also integrated the techniques of the bō staff from the Japanese martial art Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū which originated around 1447. Examples of this style can be seen in the famous Kabuki play \"Yoshitsune Senbon Zakura\" written in 1748.\n\nA large sword commonly used in the early Middle Ages in Europe. The broadsword was notable for its large hilt which allowed it to be wielded with both hands due to its size and weight. Used for slashing rather than stabbing, this weapon is used in plays set in this period like Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\" and is also seen in fantasy epics like \"Lord of the Rings\".\n\nFirst school instructing on the correct use of the rapier in England was started in 1576 by Rocco Bonetti from Italy. Bonetti took over the lease from playwright John Lyly to open his school in Blackfriars. The rapier has the advantage of the thrust over the slash which means it could be a much smaller and lighter weapon than the broadsword. It is popular in Shakespeare plays like \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Hamlet\" where duels are performed and can be used in combination with a dagger.\nThe smallsword came into fashion in England and France in the late seventeenth century. It was used as a thrusting weapon and so sword movements were kept minimal to find the opening that a thrust could land. Most men of the period carried smallswords as fashion accessories so most were elegantly ornamented. An example of a smallsword duel can be seen in \"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\" by Christopher Hampton written in 1985, based on the 1782 novel of the same name.\nThere are many styles of knives from the Bowie knife to a switchblade. Knife fights tend to have quick sharp movements. A example of this can be seen in \"West Side Story\"'s fight between Riff and Bernardo. Often in plays however, it is one actor with a knife against someone who is unarmed like in Act I of Georges Bizet's opera \"Carmen,\" written in 1875.\n\nThe shields used in stage combat are commonly round and are strong enough that they can be used as a defensive and offensive weapon. An important element in using a shield is to hold the shield arm in an upper diagonal so the fist is higher than the elbow so the top of the shield does not move when struck, and the danger being hit in the face with the shield or the weapon using to strike it can be avoided. Sword and shields can be found in battle scenes like in Shakespeare's Wars of the Roses history plays.\n\nThis consists of hand to hand combat without weapon. Elements of unarmed combat include slaps, punches, kicks, grabs, chokes, falls, rolls, grappling, among others. Many fight directors rely on combinations of messy street fighting and martial arts such as aikido and Brazilian jiu-jitsu to create fights of this nature. Generally more common in modern contemporary plays, after swords have gone out of style but also seen in older plays such as Shakespeare's \"Othello\" when Othello strangles Desdemona.\n\nFound objects are objects that are not traditionally weapons but can be used so in the context of the scene. A classic example of this is breaking a bottle over someone's head. As with all stage combat, the objects are rigged so as not to actually pose any danger to the recipients. In the case of bottles or plates, sugar glass molds are used rather than actual glass bottles.\nOther weapons like a katana, a Japanese style sword that is curved on one side, and nunchuks can also be used onstage. These require more detailed study of Japanese martial arts. Stage combat versions of nunchuks can be purchased that are foam instead of wood, thereby reducing the danger to the actors.\nMelee weapons are used in large battle scenes and can include spears, axes, maces, flails, and more. These are other weapons that are best used in large playing spaces where there is room to work at a safe distance.\n\nFight choreography can vary widely from true realism to outright fantasy depending upon the requirements of a particular production. One of the biggest reasons that theatrical fight directors often do not aim for strict realism is that the live audience could not easily follow the 'story' of the action if bodies and blades were moving in the ways trained fighters would move them. For example, a production of Cyrano de Bergerac (play), by Edmond Rostand, using 17th-Century rapiers, might show Cyrano making lots of circular cut attacks. But a more efficient, practical attack would be taking a quicker, more direct line to the opponent's body. But the fight director knows that the audience couldn't follow the action as well if the attacks were faster (the audience might hardly be able to see the thin blades whip through the air), so most fight choreographers would make choices to help the audience follow the story. Of course, this is dependent on the production, the director and other stylistic choices.\n\nOne school of fight choreographer thought says that an unusual aspect of live stage combat, such as in a play, is that audiences will react negatively to even simulated violence if they fear the actors are being harmed: for example, if an actor is really slapped in the face, the audience will stop thinking about the character and, instead, worry about the performer. Audiences may also fear for their own safety if large combat scenes seem to be out of control. Therefore, stage combat is not simply a safety technique but is also important for an audience to maintain uninterrupted suspension of disbelief.\n\nHaving its roots in Medieval theatre, stage combat enters classical theatre choreography with Elizabethan drama (Shakespeare's simple and oft seen stage direction, \"they fight\").\n\nClassical stageplays with sword fight scenes:\n\nCinema inherited the concept of choreographed fights directly from the theatrical fight. Douglas Fairbanks in 1920 was the first film director to ask a fencing master to assist the production of a fencing scene in cinema. A second wave of swashbuckling films was triggered with Errol Flynn from 1935. Renewed interest in swashbuckling films arose in the 1970s, in the wake of\n\"The Three Musketeers\" (1973). Directors at this stage aimed for a certain amount of historical accuracy, although, as the 2007 Encyclopædia Britannica puts it, \"movie fencing remains a poor representation of actual fencing technique\".\nThe \"Star Wars\" films, the fights for which are choreographed by Bob Anderson & Peter Diamond (Episodes IV, V & VI) and Nick Gillard (Episodes I, II & III), tend to portray its lightsaber combat using swordsmanship techniques drawn from existing martial arts, but performed with fantasy weapons such as lightsabers or the Force, whereas the action featured in \"The Lord of the Rings\" also choreographed by Bob Anderson employed fantasy weapons and fighting styles, designed by Tony Wolf.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Sonny Chiba, Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan, who are famous for both choreographing and acting in martial arts action films, were influential in the development of stage combat on film. Hong Kong-based fight choreographer Yuen Woo-ping is known for his work on \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" and the \"Matrix\" trilogy, in which the often unrealistic fighting techniques are complemented by directorial techniques such as bullet time. Ching Siu-tung is particularly noted in the field of Hong Kong action cinema for his use of graceful wire fu techniques. By contrast, films such as \"The Duellists\", fight directed by William Hobbs, \"Once Were Warriors\", fight directed by Robert Bruce and \"Troy\" & Ironclad, fight directed by Richard Ryan are widely famed for including gritty, realistic combat scenes. Ryan is also known for his creativity in devising styles such as Batman's in \"The Dark Knight\", Sherlock Holmes 'prevision' style in Guy Ritchie's two \"Sherlock Holmes\" movies.\n\nCombat reenactment is a side of historical reenactment which aims to depict events of battle, normally a specific engagement in history, but also unscripted battles where the 'winner' is not predetermined.\n\n\n"}

More than 250 productions have been put on its stage, more than 20 0000 performances have been played, seen by more than 8 million spectators in total.\n\nThe theatre has its own building in the centre of the town, containing an auditorium with 200 seats, a rehearsal stage, dressing rooms, administration rooms, studios and a Museum of Puppets - the only one of that kind on the Balkans.\n\nThe repertoire of the theatre offers performances for spectators of all age, starting from classical and modern plays for children, entertaining and vanguard performances for adults to educational productions for students.\n\nVarna Puppet Theatre has been the host of the prestigious International Puppet Festival The Golden Dolphin. It is held every three years at the beginning of October in the town of Varna and it has turned into a centre of the best achievements of puppet theatres in the world.\n\nThe puppeteer, stage designer and director Georgi Saravanov (1920–2000) was the founder, manager, director and stage designer of Varna Puppet Theatre from 1952 to 1958. Before that, had founded the marionette theatre in Plovdiv in 1948.\n\nIn 1951, the community of Varna invited Georgi Saravanov to establish a puppet theatre in Varna. He established a group of novice actors, some of whom had graduated from a musical school. In August 1952, the puppet show The Duckling by Nina Gernett and Tamara Gurevich was played in the old hall of the Varna Commune theatre with marionettes that Saravanov made by himself. His unique puppets from the first performances may be seen at the Museum of Puppets at the theatre.\n\nThe other founders included: Yordanka Saravanova, Petya Mandadzhiyska, Olga Peneva, Ruska Tsekova, Stefan Krumov, Avgustina Boeva, Anton Kutikov, Boris Zhelev, Vyara Mihaylova-Popova, Veselin Dionisiev, Dimitar Popov, Konstantin Kotsev, Nedka Pinteva, Neli Dzhedzheva-Mihova, Nastya Mihaylova, Roza Bozadzhieva, Stefan Voykov, Dimitar Bogdanov, etc.\n\nA building was allocated to be converted into a new theatre for the company; this was situated at Vladislav Varnenchik boulevard, behind the Post Station. There were soup kitchens and a cereals warehouse there, but despite having almost no money, the first puppeteers worked to transform it into a theatre. The first premiere in the new hall was The Golden Fish, after Alexander Pushkin, in late December 1953.\n\nIn Varna Saravanov staged the performances: The Duckling, The Two Bears, The Golden Fish, Cinderella, The Dragon and the Golden Apple, The Devil's Mill, The Scarlet Flower, Aladdin's Magic Lamp, The Pearl Tears Girl, Life-giving Water and Ivan - the Peasant Son, Darling Beauty, etc. Some of these shows came from Bulgarian and Russian fairy-tales, others from other parts of the world. His preference for the marionettes with the highest degree required an exceptional puppeteering technique from the actors. This circumstance contributed to further achievement of notable puppeteering mastery by the actors' team of Varna.\n\nFive years after its construction, first international event for the theatre - participation in the World Puppet Art Festival in Bucharest, Romania in May 1958.\n\nOn 12 July 1985, the theatre moved to a new building in the city centre. Professor Nikolina Georgieva's performance Carnival of Animals was played at the official inauguration.\n\nManager and playwright of Varna State Puppet Theatre from 1958 to 1968.\n\nManager and artistic director of Varna State Puppet Theatre from 1958 to 1968.\n\nHis activity resulted in the professional development of all theatre units. In 1970, he became the initiator and promoter of a puppet theatre festival that was transformed into an international festival in 1972 - The Golden Dolphin. He was author of the plays: Maximka, Goldie Golden Girl, Tale of Sleepy Girl, Pie the Parrot, The Raven, etc. He wrote the scripts for Little Ani, Toshko Afrikanski, The Nightingale and the Rose, The Happy Prince, Queen of Spades. Prize for dramaturgy (Pie the Parrot) at the 7th International Puppet Festival of Bulgarian Puppet Play The Golden Dolphin.\n\nManager and director of Varna State Puppet Theatre from 1991 to 2006.\n\nHe staged more than 50 performances at the theatre: The Merry Roosters, Maximka, The Nightingale and the Rose, Love, Love…, The Happiest Man, The Little Prince, Queen of Spades, Long Live Louis XVI, Booboo's New Adventures, Kosse Bosse, a Button for Sleep and others. A number of Bulgarian theatre companies have performed his shows in England, Algeria, Belgium, Germany, Greece, India, Iran, Mexico, Poland, Russia, Turkey, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Japan,

{"id": "11507786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11507786", "title": "University Rover Challenge", "text": "University Rover Challenge\n\nThe University Rover Challenge (URC) by the Mars Society is a robotics competition for university level students that challenges teams to design and build a rover that would be of use to early explorers on Mars. The competition is held annually at the Mars Desert Research Station, outside Hanksville, Utah in the United States. The site was selected by the Mars Society for its geographic similarity to Mars: In addition to being a largely barren desert area, the soil in the area has a chemical composition similar to Martian soil. The competition has also expanded internationally to include the European Rover Challenge, Canadian International Rover Challenge, and the Indian Rover Challenge as part of the Rover Challenge Series.\n\nThe aim of the University Rover Challenge is to encourage students to develop skills in robotics, improve the state-of-the-art in rovers, and work in multi-disciplinary teams with collaboration between scientists and engineers. The competition was launched in 2006 with competitions held annually every summer since 2007.\n\nSpecific scenario details change each year as teams master given tasks and to encourage flexibility in designs and improve the capabilities of the rovers each year. Rovers are required to perform tele-operated or autonomous tasks that would assist astronauts in the field. Tele-operated tasks are performed from control stations with no direct view of the rover, only what can be determined via video and data links from the rover or sensors deployed by the rover. It is assumed the operators are also on Mars so there is no time-delay in communications. For 2017 tasks included:\n\nTeams must submit a written report and a short video describing and demonstrating the design and capabilities of the rover to perform the required tasks, scientific plan, and team management. The SAR for the winning team of the 2018 competition can be found here.\n\n\"The goal is to conduct in-situ analysis with the rover, including life detection testing of samples\"\n\nTeams must investigate multiple sites of biological interest, using instruments and methods of their choice, where they must conduct analysis of samples entirely on board the rover. The goal of the task is to determine the presence or absence of life, either extinct or extant, at designated sites. After the 20-30 minutes of investigation time, teams must also prepare a short presentation to give to the judges on-site, which presents their results, analysis, and conclusions. Analysis is expected to be relevant to the setting on Earth while demonstrating an understanding of how these observations would translate to a Martian setting.\n\n\"rovers shall be required to pick up and deliver objects in the field, and deliver assistance to astronauts\"\n\nRovers must pick up and deliver objects in the field, such as screwdrivers, hammers, toolboxes, rocks, etc. Rovers are required to traverse a wide variety of terrain -- anything from soft sandy areas, to rock and boulder fields, to vertical drops. Teams are given approximate GPS coordinates for each pickup and delivery location, and potentially specific instructions for particular objects. Scoring is based on teams' ability to pick up and deliver objects to their correct locations.\n\n\"Rovers shall be required to perform several dexterous operations on a mock-up equipment system.\"\n\nPossible operations outlined in the rules for 2019 include:\n\n\n2017 required rovers to tow a wagon carrying a fuel canister to a generator, fill up the fuel tank, swap the regulator on gas cylinders, and start the generator by pressing a button. Previous equipment tasks have included pumping air into an inflatable habitat, and cleaning solar panels.\n\n\"Rovers shall be required to autonomously traverse between markers in this staged mission across moderately difficult terrain.\"\n\nHere, autonomous means without teleoperation -- that is, without operators from the base station giving commands or user input. The rover must do all its decision-making on board. However, teleoperated scouting is allowed in the earlier stages.\n\nThe markers in this task are tennis balls and approximate GPS coordinates given to teams. As the stages get more difficult, the GPS coordinates will become increasingly vague and there will be more between the tennis balls, requiring obstacle avoidance and autonomous route finding. In addition, teleoperated scouting is allowed in the earlier stages, but not in the later ones.\n\n\n\n\nA panel of judges conducts the judging, and this panel changes from year to year. Some effort is made to have a diversity of experience on the judging team, and past judges have included persons with professional experience as: systems engineers, biologists, roboticists, industrial designers, scientists and professors of varied fields. Judges are volunteers.\n\nTeams raise the money for the rovers themselves, through their university and/or outside sponsors. The competition itself is funded in part by the Mars Society, but is also sponsored by TASC Inc, a defense contractor, and in more recent years Protocase Inc, a custom parts manufacturer, which offers teams credit and discounts for all parts manufactured at Protocase.\n\nThe idea behind the URC's creation is that the kinds of rovers teams are building would assist astronauts in the field, controlled remotely by another astronaut. This imagined use case drives the competition's emphasis on teleoperation and ability to perform tasks that a human might need to. (Such as equipment servicing and retrieval and delivery)\n\nIn its first year, only 4 teams competed: University of Nevada Reno, Brigham Young University, Penn State University, and University of California Los Angeles. There were only 2 tasks, a Science Task, and a task to deploy a mock radio repeater in the field. URC spokesperson Kevin Sloan says they were unsure what to expect, but were \"blown way by the quality\". University of Nevada Reno won that year, winning a $5000 cash prize, which was reduced to $1000 in subsequent years.\n\nSince its inception in 2006, with 4 US teams, the competition has grown substantially, with 95 teams from 12 countries in 2018, and a total of 35 rovers selected to compete, their teams totaling more than 500 students.\n\nThe tasks have also undergone significant changes over the years, evolving from the 2 simple tasks of the first year to the 4 robust tasks of 2019, and continuing to get more challenging every year. Detailed information about years 2007 - 2009 is unavailable, but by 2010 there were 4 tasks: Sample Return, Site Survey, Equipment Servicing, and Emergency Navigation. In its 2010 incarnation, sample return involved choosing a sample to bring back with the rover, then doing analysis on it at the base and presenting to the judges on its scientific significance. Site survey involved analysis of a site from potentially far away. Equipment servicing most notably required teams to plug in a 3-prong plug into an outlet, and emergency navigation was a timed challenge in which rovers were to locate astronauts as fast as possible. In addition to these tasks teams scored points on a presentation they gave to judges on the design of their rover.\n\nThe following two years saw tweaks in the content of tasks to make them increasingly challenging, but the spirit of each task remained the same. For example, in 2012, the emergency navigation task was designed such that in order to reach some of the astronauts rovers would need to pass into areas where they would lose communication with their operators and thus need to operate autonomously for a time.\n\nIn 2013 the Site Survey task was replaced with Terrain Traversing, which tested rovers capability of navigating through difficult terrain. 2016 introduced a formal down-selection process, including a CDR (Critical Design Review) which took the place of the Presentation task, and a semi-finals round of competition. The next year, 2017, replaced Astronaut Assistance with Extreme Retrieval and Delivery (a mix of astronaut assistance and terrain traversing), Sample Return with Science Cache, and Terrain Traversing with Autonomous Traversal, an entirely new challenge which explicitly required teams to implement autonomous behavior on their rovers.\n\nFinally, 2018 and 2019 have seen this task structure preserved, with increases in difficulty and complexity. Notably, the 2019 Science task requires detection of life aboard the rover, whereas in 2018 teams could bring back samples to conduct tests at the base.\n\nThe number and diversity of teams has also grown significantly over the competition's lifespan. In 2018, 95 teams representing 10 different countries registered, 36 of which were selected to compete. Teams from the US generally make up the majority, but teams from Canada, Poland, and in more recent years, India, are also strongly represented. Poland in particular, fielding their first team in 2009, has been particularly competitive. A Polish team from Czestochowa University of Technology won the 2018 competition, making 6 consecutive years Poland has been represented on the podium.\n\nSome teams have been competed for many years in a row. Notably the team from Brigham Young University is the only team to have participated in every competition from 2006 to 2018, consistently placing in the top 5.\n\nTop Scores by Year:<graph>{\n}</graph>\n\n"}

{"id": "28485066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28485066", "title": "Wine humour", "text": "Wine humour\n\nWine humour is humour associated with wine. As well as ordinary anecdotes, cartoons and jokes, the whimsical labels and names given to wine are a particular source of amusement. Humour is usually rare in the world of wine, and wine jokes may only be amusing to wine obsessives.\n\nNumerous wines have been given names which are deliberately amusing. These form categories:\n\nThe South African \"Goats do Roam Wine Company\", owned by Charles Back, produces labels with names such as \"Goats do Roam\", \"Bored Doe\" and \"Goat-Roti\". The Institut National des Appellations d'Origine (INAO) has protested at the similarity of these names to the French appellation Côtes du Rhône but owner Charles Back's defence is that the names are based upon the goats which roam about his Fairview winery and has made counter-protests with a herd of goats outside the French embassy.\n\nThe New Zealand producer Cooper's Creek produces a Sauvignon blanc called \"Cat's Pee on a Gooseberry Bush\" which has sold well throughout the world. This phrase to describe the distinctive taste of the New Zealand wines made from this grape variety was first coined by wine critic, Oz Clarke. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which controls the import of alcoholic drinks into the USA, insisted that the name should be changed to \"Cat's Phee on a Gooseberry Bush\".\n\nWolf Blass created a sparkling Australian red wine called \"René Pogel\". When people inquired who this person was, Blass advised them to read the name backwards (leg opener). This innuendo caused offence and so the wine was withdrawn from sale.\n\nThe Bonny Doon vineyard in California is famous for its amusing labels which include \"Le Cigare Volant\". This recalls the resolution passed by the village council of Châteauneuf-du-Pape in 1954, forbidding the landing of flying saucers in the region's vineyards.\n\nCritter brands feature animals on their labels - a style which started with the \"Yellow Tail\" brand in 2004. These have a light-hearted, whimsical style which appeals to consumers who might be repelled by a more traditional style, which might seem too intimidating, pretentious or stuffy. Sales figures in 2006 indicated that about 18% of new wine brands were styled in this way and that annual sales in the USA were about $600 million. The d'Arenberg company in Australia is famous for the amusing names of its wines and one such is called \"The Hermit Crab\".\n\nAnecdotes and jokes may be told about wine. An old chestnut which has appeared in many contexts concerns a vineyard which sent its wine to a lab for analysis. The report which was returned warned that \"Your horse has diabetes!\". The artist and wine enthusiast Ronald Searle has produced a book of cartoons and humour about wine called \"Something in the cellar\". He also produced a collection of cartoons which satirised the art of wine-tasting — \"The Illustrated Winespeak\".\n\n"}
{"id": "42517527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42517527", "title": "Women in dance", "text": "Women in dance\n\nThe important place of women in dance can be traced back to the very origins of civilization. Cave paintings, Egyptian frescos, Indian statuettes, ancient Greek and Roman art and records of court traditions in China and Japan all testify to the important role women played in ritual and religious dancing from the start. In the Middle Ages, what has become known as ballet had its beginnings in Italian court festivals when women frequently played the parts of men. It was however in late 17th-century France that the Paris Opera produced the first celebrated ballerinas. While women began to dominate the ballet scene in the 18th century, it was with the advent of Romantic ballet in the 19th century that they became the undisputed centre of attraction with stars playing the leading roles in the works of Marius Petipa, appearing in theatres across Europe from Milan's La Scala to the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg. More recently, women have played a leading role in developing various forms of modern dance including flamenco and expressionist dance.\n\nWomen have always played a predominant role in dance, as can be seen from its earliest history until the emergence of formal dances in the 15th century which developed into ballet.\n\nCave paintings from as long ago as 6000 BC provide scenes of dancing women. Examples can be seen in the Addauta Cave near Palermo and in the Roca dels Moros in Catalonia. In Ancient Egypt, women performed ritual dances for religious ceremonies such as funerals, as illustrated by frescos on the pharaohs' tombs. The oldest records of organised dance and of professional female dancers come from Egypt. Especially in the Old Kingdom, women were organised into groups known as khener, apparently being joined by men only at a later stage.\n\nIn the Indian subcontinent too, there is early evidence of dancing women, most notably a bronze statuette from Mohenjo-daro in the Indus Valley dating from around 2500 BC. While men's early participation in dancing rituals appears to have been connected to hunting and fighting, women's dance was above all related to fertility, both agricultural and human.\n\nDance in classical Crete and Greece seems to have been influenced by the dances of Ancient Egypt. There are many examples of ancient Greek art from the 6th and 5th centuries BC depicting dancing women. The virgins of Delos danced in a circle to honour Apollo while Terpsichore was the Muse of dance. In the 6th century BC, the \"choros\" became a lasting feature of Greek theatre while women known as the Dyonysiac, frequently depicted on Greek vases, dance in frensy, celebrating Dionysus, the god of wine. In Ancient Rome, female singers and dancers performed in the annual celebrations of Isis which included mystery plays representing the resurrection of Osiris.\n\nThe Bible contains several accounts of women dancing, in particular the celebrations led by Miriam after the crossing of the Red Sea when women are said to have danced and played hand-drums. After David had returned from slaying Goliath, women came out singing and dancing. In the New Testament, Matthew tells the story of how Salome danced for Herod in order to be given the head of John the Baptist.\n\nIn China too there is a long recorded history of women dancers since the Zhou Dynasty (c. 1046–256 BC) reaching a peak in the Tang Dynasty (618–907 AD). The chorus dances performed by women in the Zhou dynasty were known as \"xi\". The ancient theatrical spectacles called \"baixi\" probably involved dancing girls in dresses with fluttering silk sleeves. Texts from the Spring and Autumn period (771–476 BC) contain descriptions of professional dancing girls while the Nishang Yuyi dance, created by the Emperor Li Longji (685–762), stages virgin women dancing as if in a magic world. In 12th-century Japan, the Shirabyoshi were famous for their dancing and poetry. One of the most famous was the court dancer Shizuka who appears in the Japanese literature of the period.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, with the spread of Christianity across Europe, the church generally frowned upon dance although there was often dancing at folk festivals, particularly at the beginning of May. In France and Italy, chain and circular dances such as the \"carole\", and the \"tresque\" were popular from the 4th to 14th centuries. They were usually danced in a closed circle with men and women interspersed and holding hands. In Italy, the lively saltarello from Naples became popular in the 14th and 15th centuries. Groups of courtesans dressed as men performed the dance at masquerades.\n\nIn the 15th century, court festivities in Italy became ever more elaborate, often featuring formal dances. One of the early masters was Domenico da Piacenza (c. 1400–1470) who compiled a manual of dance: \"De arte saltandi et choreas ducendi\". In France, too, professional dancing began to take shape when dancers performed for Henry III of France at Fontainebleau in the early 1580s. Further presentations were made for Louis XIII, who frequently took the main part himself. But it was, above all, during the reign of Louis XIV (1643–1715) that the foundations were laid for what became known as ballet. The king not only had the rules of dance written down but established the Académie Royale de Danse in 1661, which developed into today's Paris Opera Ballet. Many of the early ballets were created by the Italian-French composer Jean Baptiste Lully and the French choreographer Pierre Beauchamp, often assisted by Molière.\n\nInitially, female parts in the early ballets were taken by young men; but, in 1681, a young woman known as Mademoiselle De Lafontaine danced in Lully's \"Le Triomphe de l'amour\". She went on to be the leading ballerina in at least 18 other productions at the Paris Opera between 1681 and 1693, establishing the supreme importance of women in ballet. De Lafontaine was succeeded by Marie-Thérèse de Subligny who became the first ballerina to perform in London when she appeared with Claude Ballon in 1699. Said to be the best ballerina of her day, with beautiful eyes and a fine figure, Subligny danced at the Paris Opera from 1688 until her retirement in 1707.\n\nThe next leading dancer of the Opéra was Françoise Prévost (1680–1741), whose precision, lightness and grace contributed much to classical ballet. She persuaded conductor Jean-Féry Rebel to compose suites specifically for ballet. His \"Caprice\", \"Boutade\", \"Les Caractères de la danse\" and \"La Terpsichore\" brought her considerable success. In particular, her personal interpretation of the steps in \"Caprice\" served as an example for other soloists while she transformed the \"Caractères\" into a sequence illustrating different types of lover, both male and female. Prévost trained two highly successful dancers, Marie Camargo (1710–1770) and Marie Sallé (1707–1756), who added their personal preferences to her \"Caractères\", each developing individual styles. They would take her place as prima ballerinas after she retired from the opera in 1730.\n\nCamargo proved to be a tremendous success, not only as a result of her dazzling footwork (especially her entrechat à quatre), but because she introduced slightly shorter skirts and new hair styles. She also discarded high-heeled shoes, introducing dancing slippers which facilitated the execution of the more demanding routines. By dancing demanding routines, which had previously been performed exclusively by men, Camargo further consolidated the image of the ballerina.\n\nSallé sought more from ballet than skillful demonstrations of technique as favoured by proponents of traditional ballet. She believed music, steps, decor and costumes should all contribute to a graceful, expressive performance combining pantomime with dance in what became known as ballet d'action. As many in the Paris Opera did not share her views, she decided to move to the more liberal London. At Covent Garden, she caused a sensation in 1734 as Galatea in \"Pygmalion\", a ballet she had choreographed herself. Discarding the usual attire of a ballerina, she chose to wear a simple muslin tunic and allow her hair to fall freely over her shoulders. The following year, she even decided to dress as a man while performing the role of Cupid but the reviews were extremely critical. As a result, she returned to Paris where she danced at the Opéra until her retirement in 1740 at the young age of 33. Thereafter, she occasionally danced for the court at Versailles.\n\nDuring the second half of the 18th century, the dominating star of the Paris Opera was Marie-Madeleine Guimard who may not have had the technique of Sallé but was nevertheless recognized for her sensuous movements, her numerous suitors and her exotic attire. Other stars included Marie Allard (1738–1802) who joined the Paris Opera in 1756 where she was trained by Gaétan Vestris, becoming not just an étoile but also his wife. Although she was rather corpulent and frequently pregnant, she was acclaimed for her impressive footwork.\n\nThe most successful period for female ballet dancers was around the 1830s and 1840s when they became the great stars of Romantic ballet. The Italian-Swedish Marie Taglioni (1804–1884) not only excelled at the Paris Opera when she danced \"La Sylphide\" in 1832 but extended her fame to Saint Petersburg's Mariinsky Ballet as well as to the stages of Berlin, Milan and London until her retirement in 1847. It was she who developed ballet's en pointe (dancing on the tips of the toes) while introducing new fashions in dress and hair styling which became popular throughout Europe. The Austrian Fanny Elssler (1810–1884) gained fame and fortune by dancing the flirtatious Spanish cachucha in \"Le Diable boiteux\", performing not only in Austria, Germany, France, England and Russia but also in the United States. Nevertheless, in 1845 she refused to dance with her rivals Marie Taglioni, Carlotta Grisi, Fanny Cerrito, and Lucile Grahn in Jules Perrot's \"Pas de Quatre\".\n\nPresented at Her Majesty's Theatre in London, the \"Pas de Quatre\" caused a sensation, bringing together the four greatest ballerinas of the day. In addition to Marie Taglioni, Italy's Grisi (1819–1899) had become famous both in Paris and Saint Petersburg for her \"Giselle\", while Cerrito from Naples had become the star of La Scala in Milan. Grahn (1819–1907), a Dane trained by Bournonville, was based in Paris but had also danced in London, Saint Petersburg and Milan before settling in Germany.\n\nSeveral notable Italian ballerinas emerged in the second half of the 19th century, reaching their zeniths in Russia. Italian-born Virginia Zucchi (1849–1933) first danced in Italy and Germany but her interpretations of Marius Petipa's ballet in Russia were so successful that the Tzar insisted she should join the Mariinsky Ballet in Saint Petersburg. In the mid-1880s, she starred in \"Coppélia\", \"La fille mal gardée\" and \"La Esmeralda\", revolutionizing ballet in Russia through the extraordinary power of her performances. Pierina Legnani (1863–1930) from Milan followed as similar path, also dancing at the Mariinsky from 1892 where she originated famous roles in Petipa's ballets including \"Cinderella\", \"Swan Lake\" and \"Raymonda\", gaining the title of prima ballerina assoluta. Carlotta Brianza (1867–1930), also from Milan, first gained fame at La Scala with which she toured the United States. She is remembered above all for dancing Aurora at the premiere of Petipa's \"Sleeping Beauty\" in 1890.\n\nNew, more dynamic approaches to ballet developed from the beginning of the 20th century, the most influential being Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, promoting innovative collaborations between choreographers, composers and dancers. One of the early stars was Anna Pavlova (1881–1931) who gained fame by dancing \"The Dying Swan\" choreographed by Mikhail Fokine before joining the Ballets Russes in 1909. Her rival, Tamara Karsavina (1885–1978), who also performed with the Ballets Russes, is remembered above all for creating the title role in Fokine's \"The Firebird\". Olga Spessivtseva (1895–1991) danced with the Mariinsky in Saint Petersburg but also toured with the Ballets Russes, dancing Aurora in Diaghilev's \"The Sleeping Princess\" (1921) in London.\n\nBallet also began to develop in London, thanks mainly to the efforts of two women. Polish-born Marie Rambert (1888–1982) who had also gained experience with the Ballets Russes founded the Ballet Club (later the Rambert Dance Company) in 1926 introducing new choreographers such as Frederick Ashton. Even more influential, Ninette de Valois (1898–2001) spent three years with the Ballets Russes before creating London's Vic-Wells Ballet in 1931 (later becoming the Royal Ballet) where Alicia Markova (1910–2004) was the first prima ballerina, starring in ballets from the Mariinsky's classical productions. Markova left to form her own touring company in 1937. Ten years later Margot Fonteyn (1919–1991) became the company's prima ballerina. The height of her fame came in 1961 when she embarked on a partnership with Rudolf Nureyev, first in \"Giselle\", until she retired in 1979.\n\nAs ballet developed in the United States, Maria Tallchief (1925–2013), the first major American prima ballerina, was promoted by the choreographer Bronislava Nijinska (1891–1972) when she joined the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in New York in 1942. She danced as a soloist in George Balanchine's arrangements for \"Song of Norway\" in 1944. As Balanchine's wife, she soon became the star of the New York City Ballet. Lucia Chase (1897–1986) was a co-founder of the American Ballet Theatre in 1939 and became its artistic director for over 40 years, overseeing the production of a wide variety of new ballets. Several outstanding American ballerinas have emerged over the years including Gelsey Kirkland (born 1952), who performed the leading role in \"The Firebird\" when she was just 17, and Suzanne Farrell (born 1945) who was the star of Balanchine's \"Don Quixote\" in 1965.\n\nWomen have also contributed significantly to most other forms of dance, in particular flamenco, modern dance, expressionist dance, belly dance and cabaret which led to musical theatre.\n\nFlamenco music originated in the south of Spain in the 15th century, probably resulting from the influence of the Moors with possible origins in India. While many of the singers who emerged in the 18th century were men, women increasingly gained fame as dancers. One of the earliest was Juana la Macarrona (1860–1947) who first performed in Seville with singer Silverio Franconetti but soon become popular not only throughout Spain but across Europe. Lola Flores (1923–1995) is remembered for singing and dancing Andalusian folklore, especially flamenco, copla and chotis. Angelita Vargas (born 1946) is considered to be one of the greatest stars of Andalusian flamenco dancing, touring Europe, the United States, Japan and Australia.\n\nLed by women, various styles of modern dance began to develop towards the end of the 19th century. Loie Fuller (1862–1928) from Chicago was one of the pioneers. She employed her own natural approach to movement and improvisation, later becoming a star at the Folies Bergères in Paris. Inspired by Greek art, Isadora Duncan (1877–1927) from San Francisco paved the way to the modern free dance style believing it was more important to express the essence of life through movement rather than to follow the precepts of classical ballet. Raised on a farm in New Jersey, Ruth St. Denis (1879–1968) developed her own interpretations of Oriental dance as an expression of spiritualism. The American Martha Graham (1894–1991) exerted considerable influence on the development of modern dance through her New York-based Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance. Other female figures who contributed to developments in the mid-20th century include Doris Humphrey (1895–1958) who choreographed Afro-American spirituals and Helen Tamiris (1905–1966) who played an important part in choreographing early musicals. Another major choreographer of Broadway musicals was German-born Hanya Holm (1893–1992), a student of Mary Wigman.\n\nThe German Mary Wigman is credited as the creator of expressionist dance. Inspired by Oriental percussion, she often stressed the macabre. Hertha Feist (1896–1990), also from Germany, was an expressionist dancer and choreographer. She established her own school in Berlin, combining gymnastics with nudism and dance although her ambitions were later seriously curtailed by the Nazis. Also an associate of Wigman, Gret Palucca (1902–1993) opened her own schools in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s but they were later closed because of her Jewish ancestry. One of her students, Dore Hoyer (1911–1967), who was also an associate of Mary Wigman, developed her own programmes before the Second World War in Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. After the war she became ballet director at the Hamburg State Opera.\n\nWhile belly dancing appears to have its origins in the distant past, it was introduced to Europe and North America towards the end of the 19th century. Several of Egypt's film actresses performed belly dancing in the musicals of the 1930s and 1940s. Early stars included Tahia Carioca (1919–1999), Samia Gamal (1924–1994) and Nelly Mazloum (1929–2003). From the 1960s, belly dance became increasingly popular across the United States with stars including Dalilah (bellydancer) (1936–2001), Dahlena and Serena (1933–2007).\n\nWomen started to sing and dance in the cabarets of Paris in the 1890s, emphasizing the female body by introducing seductive movements highlighting their breasts and hips. Most of them had no formal training, the exception being Cléo de Mérode (1875–1966) who left the Paris Opera to perform at the Folies Bergère. The major choreographer was Algerian-born Mariquita (1830–1922) who became ballet director at the Folies Bergère and the Opéra Comique. Stars of the period included the Spanish La Belle Otero from Galicia who gained fame at Charles Franconi's Cirque d'été in 1890, Émilienne d’Alençon (1869–1946) who danced at the Folies Bergère, and Dutch-born Mata Hari (1876–1917) who from 1905 became famous for her Indonesian-inspired temple dance, first in Paris and then in other European capitals. La Goulue (1866–1929) is remembered for dancing the cancan at the Moulin Rouge in the 1890s.\n\n\n"}
