{"id": "1481629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1481629", "title": "Ace of Aces (picture book game)", "text": "Ace of Aces (picture book game)\n\nAce of Aces is a two-player combat picture book game designed by Alfred Leonardi and first published in 1980 by Nova Game Designs.\n\nEach set includes a pair of small books, one for each player (generally marked 'German' and 'Allied'). These are like gamebooks in that instead of reading through them, a person is 'at' one particular page, and the book represents a World War I fighter. Each player turns to the same page number in his book; the illustration on that page shows the view from the cockpit of his airplane, looking at the opponent. Along the bottom of the page is series of maneuvers that can be performed, with page numbers listed under them (while the page numbers are different with each page, the maneuvers are constant).\n\nEach player selects a maneuver. Both players then announce the corresponding numbers. Each player turns to the page number announced by the opponent, looks up his own maneuver there, and turns to the page number listed under it. After both players have done this, they are on the same (new) page, looking at new views of each other. The process is repeated until one player has maneuvered his opponent into the sights of his guns and can shoot him down.\n\nThe maneuvers in both books are the same, with each set representing a range of aircraft with similar handling characteristics. Different sets are completely compatible with each other and can be used together, as long as opposing books are selected.\n\nAdditionally, a single player can in essence \"fly solo\" by picking up any single book and executing maneuvers. The result is not unlike using the aircraft pictured in the book's pages as a fixed, non-moving spatial reference point. This provides an easy way for newcomers to the game to get a feel for what each maneuver does, and hence a reasonably quick way to get up to a competitive level of play against opponents.\n\nGameplay could further be customised by using an included sheet of rules which provided for \"intermediate\" and \"advanced\" games. These games added factors such as altitude difference, ammunition supply, windspeed and jammed guns to the basic game (which assumed the guns always worked and had an endless supply of ammunition, and that the players would fly at the same altitude throughout in still air).\n\nDespite what some perceived as a lack of \"realism\", the basic game was extremely popular and simple to learn, and it could be played anywhere there was room for two people to sit or stand.\n\n\n\"Ace of Aces\" was the first game of this type, but others were done later. \"Bounty Hunter\" used much the same format for an old west gunfight (only one set was released, \"Shootout at the Saloon\"). \"Dragonriders of Pern\" used the \"Ace of Aces\" format in a contest to stop Threadfall. Alfred Leonardi also designed the \"Lost Worlds\" combat book game system which is sometimes mistakenly described as using the \"Ace of Aces\" system. Joe Dever also used this style of books in a fantasy setting for his Combat Heroes books.\n\nIn 1989, West End Games released a set of books with the title \"Starfighter Battle Book: X-wing vs. Tie Interceptor\", using exactly the same Ace of Aces format: even the shooting pages are the same as those in the earlier game.\n\nNick Schuessler reviewed \"Ace of Aces\" in \"The Space Gamer\" No. 45. Schuessler commented that \"enjoy trying to figure out how this little paper computer always gets you back to the same page with the right pictures showing.\" In 1981, \"Ace of Aces\" won the Charles Roberts/Origins \"Gamers Choice\" of 1980 and was inducted into the Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame in 1994. In 1999, \"Pyramid\" magazine named \"Ace of Aces\" as one of the \"Millennium's Best Games\". According to that magazine the game is \"nothing more than a hex-based single-unit wargame, [but] what made \"Ace of Aces\" great was the presentation. By completely hiding the actual mechanics of the game in the flipbooks, it didn't \"feel\" like a wargame.\"\n\nThe game is long out of print, but in June 2012 a Kickstarter project was initiated to reprint the game, with the permission and cooperation of the game's designer. The project was successful and the game was republished in January 2014.\n\n"}

It was published in 1996 by Ocean Software.\n\nTeam17 had originally intended this to be its final Amiga title. Following the success of \"Worms\", Team17's first multi-format release, the company was looking to get out of the Amiga game market, which had become stagnant over the years. As it transpired, \"The Killing Grounds\" was not Team17's final Amiga title\"\" was released the following year.\n\nTeam17 made the game's source code freely available in March 1997, on the cover CD of Amiga Format magazine issue 95.\n\nWith the success of \"Alien Breed 3D\", Team17 decided to follow it up with a sequel. This time Team17 was aiming even higher, hoping to recreate something similar to the \"Quake\" engine on an Amiga. Team17 had included two versions of the game spread over 5 disks: one with high-quality sound and textures, the other with reduced quality versions. The reduced version was supposedly able to run on a non-expanded Amiga 1200, although the game ran slowly.\n\nTheir project, however, was perhaps over-ambitious. Most Amigas of the time struggled to run the game, even with upgraded RAM and accelerator cards. Even with the fastest CPU at that time (MC68060 @ 66 MHz), the game could not be played smoothly with high details in fullscreen. Most Amiga enthusiasts have only been able to play the game in recent years using emulation.\n\nPoor level design, no collision-detection with monsters, and repetitive sounds did nothing to aid the gameplay experience.\n\nAn editor was shipped with the game, allowing users to create their own levels.\n\nA PC/Dreamcast follow-up to \"The Killing Grounds\", entitled \"Alien Breed: Conflict\", began development in 1999. The development was cancelled due to the size of the project. To date, \"Conflict\" remains as the only title in the series that was developed specifically for the PC and as the only PC game in the series developed solely by Team17 (the PC version of \"Alien Breed\" was ported by MicroLeague, while \"\" were ported to the PC by East Point Software). According to what little information there is concerning this game, \"Conflict\" was also planned to be a first-person shooter and, presumably, would have followed on directly where \"The Killing Grounds\" left off.\n"}
{"id": "297267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=297267", "title": "Allusion", "text": "Allusion\n\nAllusion is a figure of speech, in which an object or circumstance from unrelated context is referenced covertly or indirectly. It is left to the audience to make the direct connection; where the connection is directly and explicitly stated (as opposed to indirectly implied) by the author, it is instead usually termed a reference. In the arts, a literary allusion puts the alluded text in a new context under which it assumes new meanings and denotations. It is not possible to predetermine the nature of all the new meanings and inter-textual patterns that an allusion will generate. Literary allusion is closely related to parody and pastiche, which are also \"text-linking\" literary devices.\n\nIn a wider, more informal context, an allusion is a passing or casually short statement indicating broader meaning. It is an incidental mention of something, either directly or by implication, such as \"In the stock market, he met his Waterloo.\"\n\nIn the most traditional sense, \"allusion\" is a literary term, though the word has also come to encompass indirect references to any source, including allusions in film or the visual arts. In literature, allusions are used to link concepts that the reader already has knowledge of, with concepts discussed in the story. In the field of film criticism, a film-maker's intentionally unspoken visual reference to another film is also called an homage. It may even be sensed that real events have allusive overtones, when a previous event is inescapably recalled by a current one. \"Allusion is bound up with a vital and perennial topic in literary theory, the place of authorial intention in interpretation\", William Irwin observed, in asking \"What is an allusion?\"\n\nWithout the hearer or reader's comprehending the author's intention, an allusion becomes merely a decorative device. \nAllusion is an economical device, a figure of speech that uses a relatively short space to draw upon the ready stock of ideas, cultural memes or emotion already associated with a topic. Thus, an allusion is understandable only to those with prior knowledge of the covert reference in question, a mark of their cultural literacy.\n\nThe origin of \"allusion\" is in the Latin verb \"ludere, lusus est\" \"to play with, jest.\" Recognizing the point of allusion's condensed riddle also reinforces cultural solidarity between the maker of the allusion and the hearer: their shared familiarity with allusion bonds them. Ted Cohen finds such a \"cultivation of intimacy\" to be an essential element of many jokes. Some aspect of the referent must be invoked and identified for the tacit association to be made; the allusion is indirect in part because \"it depends on something more than mere substitution of a referent.\"\n\nThe allusion depends as well on the author's intent; a reader may search out parallels to a figure of speech or a passage, of which the author was unaware, and offer them as unconscious allusions—coincidences that a critic might not find illuminating. Addressing such issues is an aspect of hermeneutics.\n\nWilliam Irwin remarks that allusion moves in only one direction: \"If A alludes to B, then B does not allude to A. The Bible does not allude to Shakespeare, though Shakespeare may allude to the Bible.\" Irwin appends a note: \"Only a divine author, outside of time, would seem capable of alluding to a later text.\" This is the basis for Christian readings of Old Testament prophecy, which asserts that passages are to be read as allusions to future events due to Jesus's revelation in .\n\nAllusion differs from the similar term intertextuality in that it is an intentional effort on the author's part. The success of an allusion depends in part on at least some of its audience \"getting\" it. Allusions may be made increasingly obscure, until at last they are understood by the author alone, who thereby retreats into a private language (e.g. \"Ulalume\", by Edgar Allan Poe).\n\nIn discussing the richly allusive poetry of Virgil's \"Georgics\", R. F. Thomas distinguished six categories of allusive reference, which are applicable to a wider cultural sphere. These types are:\n\nA type of literature has grown round explorations of the allusions in such works as Alexander Pope's \"The Rape of the Lock\" or T. S. Eliot's \"The Waste Land\".\n\nIn Homer, brief allusions could be made to mythic themes of generations previous to the main narrative because they were already familiar to the epic's hearers: one example is the theme of the Calydonian boarhunt. In Hellenistic Alexandria, literary culture and a fixed literary canon known to readers and hearers made a densely allusive poetry effective; the poems of Callimachus offer the best-known examples.\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr., alluded to the Gettysburg Address in starting his \"I Have a Dream\" speech by saying 'Five score years ago...\"; his hearers were immediately reminded of Abraham Lincoln's \"Four score and seven years ago\", which opened the Gettysburg Address. King's allusion effectively called up parallels in two historic moments without overwhelming his speech with details.\n\nA sobriquet is an allusion. By metonymy one aspect of a person or other referent is selected to identify it, and it is this shared aspect that makes a sobriquet evocative: for example, \"the city that never sleeps\" is a sobriquet of (and therefore an allusion to) New York.\n\nAn allusion may become trite and stale through unthinking overuse, devolving into a mere cliché, as is seen in some of the sections below.\n\nAndy Warhol, a 20th-century American artist most famous for his pop-art images of Campbell soup cans and of Marilyn Monroe, commented on the explosion of media coverage by saying, \"In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes.\"\nToday, when someone receives a great deal of media attention for something fairly trivial, and he or she is said to be experiencing his or her \"15 minutes of fame\", that is an allusion to Andy Warhol's famous remark.\n\nAccording to the Book of Genesis, God destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, but Lot, the nephew of Abraham, was given time to escape with his family before the destruction. God commanded Lot and his family not to look back as they fled. Lot's wife disobeyed and looked back, and she was immediately turned into a pillar of salt as punishment for her disobedience.\n\nAn allusion to Lot's wife or to a pillar of salt is usually a reference to someone who unwisely chooses to look back once he or she has begun on a course of action or to someone who disobeys an explicit rule or command.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Cassandra, the daughter of Trojan king Priam, was loved by Apollo, who gave her the gift of prophecy. When Cassandra later angered Apollo, he altered the gift so that her prophecies, while true, would not be believed. Thus, her accurate warnings to the Trojans were disregarded, and disaster befell them.\n\nToday, a \"Cassandra\" refers to someone who predicts disasters or negative results, especially to someone whose predictions are disregarded.\n\nThis phrase comes from a novel by Joseph Heller. \"Catch-22\" is set on a U.S. Army Air Force base in World War II. \"Catch-22\" refers to a regulation that states an airman's request to be relieved from flight duty can only be granted if he is judged to be insane. However, anyone who does not want to fly dangerous missions is obviously sane, thus, there is no way to avoid flying the missions.\n\nLater in the book the old woman in Rome explains that Catch-22 means \"They can do whatever they want to do.\" This refers to the theme of the novel in which the authority figures consistently abuse their powers, leaving the consequences to those under their command. \n\nIn common speech, \"catch-22\" has come to describe any absurd or no-win situation.\n\nThe poetry of T. S. Eliot is often described as \"allusive\", because of his habit of referring to names, places or images that may only make sense in the light of prior knowledge. This technique can add to the experience, but for the uninitiated can make Eliot's work seem dense and hard to decipher.\n\nThe most densely allusive work in modern English may be \"Finnegans Wake\" by James Joyce. Joseph Campbell and Henry Morton Robinson wrote \"A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake\" (1944) that unlocked some of Joyce's most obscure allusions.\n\n"}

{"id": "3333461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3333461", "title": "BARGE", "text": "BARGE\n\nBARGE, the Big August Rec.Gambling Excursion, is a yearly convention held in Las Vegas during the first weekend of August. It consists of a series of tournaments both of poker and other gambling games, as well as a banquet and a host of informal social and gambling activities organized by attendees. Some of the well-known poker players who have participated either as speakers or players in the no limit holdem tournament include: Howard Lederer, Chris Ferguson, Phil Hellmuth Jr, Greg Raymer, Mason Malmuth, David Sklansky, Mike Caro, Matt Matros, Linda Johnson, Phil Gordon, Paul Phillips, Andy Bloch, William Chen, Doyle Brunson and many others.\n\nBARGE is formally open to \"members of the rec.gambling\" community, but registration must be done in advance over the Internet. BARGE organizers include Russell Fox, Rich Bremer, Jeff Deitch and Stevan Goldman. Former organizers include Chuck Weinstock, Peter Secor, Michael \"mickdog\" Patterson, Nick Christenson, Bree Goldman and Mike Zimmers.\n\nThe first BARGE was an informal gathering of a small number of participants of the rec.gambling newsgroup in Las Vegas in 1991 during SIGGRAPH, a computer graphics convention. The next year, many of the same players got together and had a poker tournament at The Mirage. The poker tournament was No Limit Hold'em (as it still is, while additional poker tournaments have been added), and nine players participated. Since then, BARGE has been held at various Las Vegas locations (see below for a list). Attendance has grown steadily, averaging about 200 participants.\n\nIn its earlier years, BARGE attendees were interested in Blackjack as much as they were in\nPoker. Some famous Blackjack players (card counters) who have attended BARGE include Andy Bloch, Stanford Wong, Arnold Snyder and 'Mr. M.' Since around 1998, BARGE attendees and BARGE activities have centered much more around Poker.\n\nIn 2006 BARGE was moved to later in the month of August due to a conflict with the World Series of Poker as some attendees participated in both events. Since then BARGE has returned to its traditional 1st weekend of August.\n\nBARGE is the progenitor of all the other annual \"ARG\" events, including ATLARGE (held in Atlantic City), ESCARGOT (held in the Los Angeles area), FARGO (held in Connecticut, prior to 2014 at Foxwoods, now at Mohegan Sun), MARGE (held in Biloxi), EMBARGO (Winter Las Vegas event) and others. \n\nTraditions are extremely important to BARGE. For example, Scottro (a prominent BARGE participant) denied that his much-washed originally red hat was actually pink, resulting in dozens of players wearing pink baseball hats at the 2006 BARGE, held at the Venetian. \"To Throw Down the Pink Hat\" has subsequently come to mean \"to challenge someone to a heads-up poker match.\"\n\nPerhaps the most famous BARGE tradition is \"Presto!\" as a nickname for a hold'em hand of pocket fives. The term was originated by Frank Irwin (as slang for a blackjack) but its poker meaning is far more widespread, making appearances on multiple sets of commemorative chips, badges, etc.\n\nOther BARGE traditions include multiple poker tournaments, a blackjack tournament, a video poker tournament, the Official ADB Darkside Craps Crawl, a Sushi outing with Sake tasting, the Unofficial BARGE Smoker and Bourbon Tasting, Karaoke night, and the only known Chowaha games played in casino settings for real money. Chinese Poker has also been played at BARGE for many years.\n\nAfter the BARGE banquet on Saturday evening, another tradition is played out. 'Reindeer games' – various exotic poker games—are spread. These games include or have included Chowaha, first spread at Binion's\nin 1997; Binglaha (a variant of Omaha, in which whether the game is played high-only or high/low is determined after the flop betting by a roll of a die), first spread at Binion's in 2003, 'Must-drink, must-toke HORSE', and Lowball.\n\nWhenever anyone busts out of a BARGE tournament, they are given a round of applause; not as an ironic gesture, but as a thank-you for participating in BARGE. Many players also bring a \"bust-out gift,\" which they give to the player who busted them. These are typically small, memorable tokens, but have included such gifts as a decoupage \"Last Supper\" featuring Chris \"Jesus\" Ferguson (the late Don Perry's gift in 2005, the year he won) and an iPad (JK Scheinberg's gift in 2010).\n\nThe winner of the No-Limit tournament is traditionally tasked with designing a set of chips for next year's BARGE, with some sort of commemorative design. These chip sets are then sold the next year. The BARGE Chip Committee, currently headed by Patrick Milligan (circa 2008), helps the winner with the logistics and artwork.\n\nEach year, the Saturday night banquet features a guest speaker.

One version of the game is played when \"one player climbs another’s back\" and the climber guesses \"the number of certain objects out of sight.\" Another version of the game is played with \"one group of players <nowiki>[climbing]</nowiki> on the backs of a second group in order to build as large a pile as possible or to cause the supporting players to collapse.\"\n\nAs early as the 16th century, children in Europe and the Near East played Buck, Buck, which had been called \"Bucca Bucca quot sunt hic?\". Pieter Bruegel's painting \"Children's Games\" (1560) depicts children playing a variant of the game.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the game is sometimes called High Cockalorum, but has a large number of different names in various local dialects. These include: 'Polly on the Mopstick' in Birmingham, 'Strong Horses, Weak Donkeys' in Monmouthshire, 'Hunch, Cuddy, Hunch' in west Scotland, 'Mont-a-Kitty' in Middlesbrough, 'Husky Fusky Finger or Thumb' in Nottinghamshire, 'High Jimmy Knacker' in east London, 'Jump the Knacker 1-2-3' in Watford, 'Wall-e-Acker' or 'Warny Echo' in north West London, 'Stagger Loney' in Cardiff and 'Trust' in Lancashire. The game is sometimes played in the sergeants' or officers' messes of the British Armed Forces.\n\nA similar game is played in South Korea (malttukbakgi). There is even a statue depicting it. Malttukbakgi (말뚝박기) is a game that both Korean girls and boys play up until high school. In malttukbakgi, there are two teams. Team A has one person stand up against the wall and the rest of the team have all their heads up in someone else’s butt/crotch area to form what looks like a big horse. Team B then jumps up onto the human horse one by one, each jumping with as much force as possible. If anyone from any team falls to the floor, that team loses. If everyone stays up, then the person against the wall and the person in front will play a game of gawibawibo (rock, scissor, paper) to determine the winner.\n\nTurkish game called Uzun Essek, or \"Long Donkey.\" The person standing up is called the Pillow, or the referee. One team bends over as you see in the picture, then the other team one by one jumps on the \"Donkey.\" If the Donkey can stand the pressure, the first person to go in the jumping team puts up one or two with his fingers. If the donkey can guess the number right, they get to jump. If the jumpers fall to the ground, it is the donkey's turn to jump. If the donkey falls, the jumpers jump again.\n\nBill Cosby's 1967 album \"Revenge\" includes a track \"Buck, Buck\" in which he describes playing the game as a child. He mentions that in his hometown of Philadelphia it was called \"Buck Buck,\" while in New York City it was known as \"Johnny on the Pony.\" This track introduces Fat Albert, \"the baddest Buck Buck breaker in the world,\" who \"weighed 2,000 pounds\" and could cause earthquakes when he ran down the street. The character would later become the basis for the cartoon series \"Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids\" which includes a buck buck episode (season 1 episode 6). The same story, in a slightly different form, is also included in Cosby's book \"Childhood\".\n\nIn the 2014 \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" film, the heroes use a game of buck buck as an attack that is key to their defeat of the main villain.\n\nNotes\n"}

{"id": "34320167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34320167", "title": "Chennai Express", "text": "Chennai Express\n\nChennai Express () is a 2013 Indian Hindi-language action comedy film directed by Rohit Shetty and written by Sajid-Farhad and Yunus Sajawal. Produced by Gauri Khan, Karim Morani, Ronnie Screwvala and Siddharth Roy Kapur, the film stars Shah Rukh Khan as Rahul Mithaiwala, a man who accidentally boards the eponymous train and journeys from Mumbai to Rameswaram, falling in love with the daughter of a local don, played by Deepika Padukone. \"Chennai Express\" had Nikitin Dheer and Sathyaraj play supporting roles. It was released with subtitles in English, French, Spanish, Arabic, German, Hebrew, Dutch, Turkish and Malay.\n\nThe first planned collaboration between Khan and Shetty was a remake of \"Angoor\" (1982). The script of \"Chennai Express\", which was initially written as a backup project for Khan, was chosen instead. Conceived as a \"commercial\" romance, the film was originally titled \"Ready Steady Po\". Filming began in Mehboob Studio in October 2012 and was completed by May 2013. A large part of the film was set in Ooty, for which sets were constructed in Wai. The soundtrack for \"Chennai Express\" was composed by Vishal–Shekhar, with the background score being composed by Amar Mohile. UTV Motion Pictures acquired the distribution rights of the film.\n\n\"Chennai Express\" was released theatrically in overseas markets on 8 August 2013 and a day later in India. The film received mixed reviews from critics. Regardless, it broke several box office records in India and abroad, becoming the quickest film to collect net domestically. The film surpassed \"3 Idiots\" to become the highest-grossing Bollywood film worldwide at that point. As of March 2018, it is the eleventh-highest-grossing Bollywood film worldwide. \"Chennai Express\" is also the first Bollywood film which was released on the same day in India and Peru.\n\nRahul Mithaiwala is an orphaned bachelor living in Mumbai. Raised by his grandparents from the age of eight, Rahul's grandfather owns a chain of confectionery shops. Before his grandfather's 100th-birthday celebration, two of Rahul's friends invite him to accompany them on a vacation in Goa, which he accepts. Rahul's grandfather dies on the eve of the celebration, just when he witnesses Sachin Tendulkar on TV in a cricket match get dismissed on his 99th run. His grandmother tells Rahul that his grandfather wanted his ashes to be divided into two partsone of each to be immersed in the Ganga and Rameswaram. She asks Rahul to take the ashes to Rameswaram and disperse them. Reluctantly, he accepts her request but is also eager to attend the Goa trip.\n\nRahul and his friends plan to dump the ashes at Goa but his grandmother wants to see him off, forcing Rahul to travel by train. He books a single ticket on the \"Chennai Express\", planning to meet his friends along the way, at Kalyan Junction station. However, Rahul forgets to take the ashes, and he almost misses the train when he returns to collect them. As he tries to leave the train, he notices a young woman running to board it. He helps her and four other people board the moving train, but the train leaves the station before he can get off.\n\nRahul tries to flirt with the woman, who starts communicating by singing parodies of Hindi film songs, and explains that the four men are trying to kidnap her. Rahul lends her his mobile phone so that she can contact her friends, but the men with her grab it and throw it from the train. Rahul is annoyed, but says nothing because the men are carrying weapons. Rahul tells the Travelling Ticket Examiner about them, but they push the inspector into a river below a bridge. Panicked, Rahul learns that the men are her cousins, and that her name is Meenalochni \"Meena\" Azhagusundaram. She is fleeing from a forced marriage to ruffian Tangaballi. Her father, Durgeshwara Azhagusundaram is a powerful headman of the local mafia in Tamil Nadu.\n\nMeena takes Rahul to her father and introduces him as her lover. Tangaballi challenges Rahul to a duel that Rahul unknowingly accepts, due to his lack of knowledge in Tamil. On the night of the duel, Rahul escapes with the help of a local policeman, Shamsher, but he ends up on a ship with Sri Lankan terrorists and smugglers. A gun battle ensues between the police force and the terrorists. When the police officers investigate and take Rahul into custody, he tells his story and ends up back in Komban.\n\nTerrified and once again surrounded by Azhagusundaram's sickle-wielding henchmen, Rahul pretends to take Meena hostage and escapes with her in her father's car, battling Azhagasundaram's men. When the car breaks down, Rahul and Meena quarrel and part ways. Rahul, not knowing which way to go, returns to Meena, who takes him to the Vidhamba village. Meena tells the villagers that they are a married couple who needs protection and rest, to which the villagers agree.\n\nMeena then realises that she has fallen in love with Rahul. When Rahul plans to sneak away, she argues, not wanting to earn the villagers' distrust. Tangaballi catches Rahul as he tries to leave, but the villagers help them escape again. Meena persuades Rahul to disperse his grandfather's ashes and travels with him to Rameswaram, where they complete the rites. On their way back, Rahul realises that he has fallen in love with Meena, and does not tell her where they are going. He takes Meena back to her father and tries to make him understand and honour his daughter's wish. He also tells Meena that he loves her.\n\nRahul tells Tangaballi and his goons that he is ready for the fight this time. In the fight that follows, Rahul is severely injured but emerges victorious. Azhagusundaram and Tangaballi reform, accepting that the love of a common man like Rahul is bigger than their physical ability and political influence. Azhagusundaram allows Rahul to marry Meena. Rahul then leaves a message that love knows no regional or language barriers and that with a strong heart, there is no limit to what the common man can achieve.\n\nMayank and Rohit Shetty had originally planned to team up with Shah Rukh Khan for a remake of the 1982 film, \"Angoor\". After the 2011 blockbuster \"Singham\", Shetty had begun writing the script of the film but left it half-finished. The script of \"Chennai Express\" was ready for Khan as a back-up, because of the difficulty of obtaining the actor's filming dates. Upon reading the script, Khan liked the idea and agreed to star in it before the \"Angoor\" remake, causing \"Angoor\" remake to be postponed. Shetty said the film is \"a hard-core commercial film with a romantic angle. The story is about this man's travel from Mumbai to Rameshwaram and what happens during the journey.\" About 68 minutes of footage were enhanced with CGI by Reliance MediaWorks.\n\nKhan was the first actor to be approached with the script and was the first lead actor to be signed for the film. Rohit Shetty stated that despite the title, Khan would not play a South Indian in the film. The casting of the lead heroine was the subject of much press speculation; Kareena Kapoor, Asin and Deepika Padukone were rumoured to be involved. Shetty denied those rumours, stating that the cast would be finalised in April 2012, and that he was going to cast an established actress in the role. In October 2012, it was confirmed that Deepika Padukone had been signed to play the female lead opposite Khan, and photographs showing Padukone and Khan shooting were released. This was Padukone's second film opposite Khan, with whom she made her Bollywood debut in the 2007 blockbuster \"Om Shanti Om\". Starting with this film, which was released on Women's Day, Khan wished to have the name of his female co-star appear above his own in the credits.\n\nSathyaraj was cast to play the role of Padukone's character's father, making his debut in Bollywood. Actress Priyamani was signed in January 2013 for an item number in the film. Other personalities from Tamil cinema, including Delhi Ganesh and Mohan Raman, appear in minor roles. The film was initially titled as \"Ready Steady Po\". However, to emphasis on the connection with South India, the film was retitled as \"Chennai Express\" with the planned title used as the tagline.\n\nFilming on the project began at Mehboob Studio in Mumbai on 5 October 2012. additional filming was done at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station with a minimal crew. Stills of the lead actor were unofficially released in mid-October 2012. In November 2012, the cast and crew went to Goa to begin filming the scenes set there. Vasco Da Gama Railway Station was used to portray as Kalyan Junction railway station. A romantic scene on board a train passing next to Dudhsagar Falls was also shot. In December 2012, the crew went to Jakarta to film certain scenes.\n\nIn January 2013, a shoot was supposedly scheduled to take place in Ooty, but since Khan felt that Ooty was too far from Mumbai, several locations from Ooty were reconstructed on the outskirts of Panchgani in Wai by the art director Narendra Ruharikar. It took over 40 days and 15 million to build the required sets. Filming in Wai took the entire month of March 2013. A 10-day shooting schedule in Munnar, Kerala, began in mid-April 2013; scenes were filmed at Devikulam Lake, Meesapulimala, Wagavara and Kannimala. Filming was stopped for several days because of heavy rainfall, resulting in the schedule being slightly extended until end of the same month. A press conference was held in Munnar. In May 2013, scenes were filmed in North Goa. Padukone finished shooting on 25 May 2013. Khan flew to Hyderabad in May 2013 to film his remaining scenes. The film has several Tamil dialogues, but to retain context no subtitles were used.\n\n\"Chennai Express\" was produced by Gauri Khan, Karim Morani, Ronnie Screwvala and Siddharth Roy Kapur under the Red Chillies Entertainment banner. It was released internationally by UTV Motion Pictures.\n\nThe score of \"Chennai Express\" was composed by Amar Mohile; the songs were composed by the duo Vishal-Shekhar, and the lyrics were written by Amitabh Bhattacharya and Yo Yo Honey Singh. Recording of the songs began in late October 2012. The track \"Ready Steady Po\" was recorded in November 2012 by the music's composers. Several sources said that the director and actor were unsatisfied with the score. The director was reportedly asked to plan for a different musical composition. However, the composers denied these rumours. In mid-April 2013, singer S. P. Balasubrahmanyam recorded the title track for the film, marking his return to Bollywood for playback after an absence of fifteen years. He said the song celebrated the spirit of togetherness. Initially, Balasubrahmanyam was apprehensive, but chose to sing due to the content and leads of the film. The song \"1 2 3 4 get on the dance floor\" was released as a promotional single on World Music Day. On 27 June 2013, the video promo of the song \"Titli\" was released, and on 11 July 2013, the promo video of \"Kashmir Main Tu Kanyakumari\" was released. On 19 July 2013, T-Series uploaded a song to its official channel on YouTube; sung by Honey Singh. The song was titled \"Lungi Dance – The 'Thalaivar(r)' Tribute\" in honour of the film actor Rajinikanth. On 25 July 2013, a promotional video of the song \"Tera Rasta Main Chhodoon Na\" was released. The music album was launched on 1 July 2013.\n\nThe soundtrack album of \"Chennai Express\" received positive reviews. Devesh Sharma of \"Filmfare\" gave the album 4/5, saying that it is \"a robust offering, which is full of new sounds and zany surprises\", and that Vishal-Shekhar put in a lot of effort to bring out their best for the film. IBN Live gave the album 3.5/5 and stated that the album was another \"winner\" from Vishal-Shekhar. The composers were critically praised for blending different forms of music which \"pepped\" the otherwise usual Bollywood music.\n\nYashika Mathur of \"DNA\" gave the album 3.5/5 and said that \"Chennai Express\" is \"another winner from Vishal-Shekhar\" that \"boasts of a soothing bouquet of typical Bollywood numbers and some peppy tracks with exceptional mixing.\" She wrote that it \"is likely to appeal to music lovers of all age-groups and sentiments\" and called it \"[a]n entertaining all-rounder, the composers must be applauded for fusing different music and beats to pep up the otherwise usual Bollywood music.\"\n\nJoginder Tuteja of Rediff.com gave the album 3/5 and wrote that the title song, \"Chennai Express\", is \"just about average\". He expressed his displeasure over Balasubramaniam's ill-suiting of voice for Shah Rukh Khan, and said that in all the song was not remarkable. He, however, complimented that the overall outcome was \"satisfactory\" with a few of the songs even standing out. Anand Holla of \"Mumbai Mirror\" said, \"It's easy to imagine director Rohit Shetty's crystal clear brief to Vishal-Shekhar, involving words such as catchy, peppy, fun, and of course 'hit songs'. Given how happily formulaic the soundtrack has turned out, V–S have given us a fair idea of what awaits us this Eid.\"\n\nThe film had paid previews in India on 8 August 2013, with ten to twelve shows at multiplexes. \"Chennai Express\" was scheduled to be released in non-traditional international markets. In Peru, it was the first Hindi film to be released on the same day as in India. \"Chennai Express\" was also released in Morocco, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, France, and Israel. The price of tickets for \"Chennai Express\" was increased 40 percent above the usual tariff during the weekday shows and up to 20 percent on weekends; although this increase was not uniformly applied in all multiplexes.\n\nThe film was released in 2,550 cinemas across 3,550 screens in India, and across 700 screens internationallyincluding 196 screens in North America, 175 in the United Kingdom, 55 in the Middle East, and 30 in Australiathe widest Bollywood release up to that point.\n\nA first look of \"Chennai Express\" was released on 1 January 2013. A 31-second title track teaser, sung by S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, was released on 23 May 2013. The official trailer of the film was released at an event in Mumbai on 13 June 2013; two days after its launch it exceeded four million views on YouTube. The outfits worn by Khan and Padukone in the film were auctioned; proceeds from the sale were donated to a charity. The auction took place around the day of the film's release. A Karaoke app developed by \"Singbox\"a Swedish gaming studiowas launched on 2 August 2013 for Android and iOS based smartphones.\n\nKhan promoted his film on the reality television shows \"Comedy Nights with Kapil\", \"Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah, \"Madhubala Ek Ishq Ek Junoon\", \"DID Super Moms\", \"Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 6\" and \"Indian Idol Junior\". The ZeitgeistGoogle's year-end compilation of the most frequent search queriesnamed \"Chennai Express\" the most trending topic of 2013 in India.\nThe film's satellite television rights were sold to Zee Network for . The agreement was linked to the film's box office revenuethe first deal of its kind in Indian cinema. If \"Chennai Express\" collected over net, then for every 100 million earned after that, the producers would get an additional 20 million. The film had its television premiere on 20 October 2013, and was seen by a record number of viewers, almost doubling that of the highest rated fiction show. It helped its broadcaster, Zee TV, to reach the top position among General Entertainment Channels that month.\n\nAlong with \"Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara!\", \"Chennai Express\" was initially abandoned by Pakistani distributors and exhibitors because four Pakistani films were released on the same day. The release dates were postponed to 15 and 9 August, respectively. During its Wai schedule of filming, the film's unit ran into trouble for using too much water from Dhom Dam, in the drought-stricken Satara district of Maharashtra. The state's relief and rehabilitation minister, Patangrao Kadam, addressed the problem.\n\nThe film's poster and trailer, released on Twitter and YouTube, were criticised by some Tamil media for their depiction of Tamil ethos. They said Padukone's heavily accented dialogue resembled a Malayalee accent rather than a Tamil one. Padukone defended the film, saying that it did not parody South Indian culture and that most of the crew, including herself, are South Indians. She later said, \"Why would we spoof our own culture?\"\n\nOn 31 July 2013, the Nationalist political party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena's film wing threatened to disrupt the film's premiere; it reportedly attempted to dislodge ongoing popular Marathi movies from cinemas that show only one film at a time. The party was upset with reports that the distributors of \"Chennai Express\" had demanded prime slots in single screen cinemas, and at some multiplexes, where the superhit Marathi film \"Duniyadari\" had been popular since 19 July. On 1 August 2013, both the film directors, Rohit Shetty and Sanjay Jadhav were called on by Raj Thackeray to find a solution. After listening to both parties, Thackeray ruled that if \"Duniyadari\" was not removed from single screen cinemas across the state, then the MNS would not object to the release of \"Chennai Express\" in Maharashtra. \"Chennai Express\" was released in 10 languages.\n\n\"Chennai Express\" received mixed reviews from critics worldwide.\n\nTaran Adarsh of \"Bollywood Hungama\" gave the movie 4 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"On the whole, 'Chennai Express' has the trademark Rohit Shetty stamp all over. You seek entertainment, entertainment and entertainment in a film like 'Chennai Express' and the movie lives up to the hype and hoopla surrounding it.\" Rachit Gupta of \"Filmfare\" rated the movie 4 of 5 stars, stating, \"The film's peppered with humorous set pieces and colourful locales and songs. Rohit Shetty makes chettinad-style masala movies. And that's the perfect description of this film. If you don't plan to engage in a multi-lateral critique of dramatic elements and narrative, this film can be fun.\" Sarita Tanwar Of \"DNA\" gave the movie 3.5 of 5 stars and said, \"This is a treat for all Hindi film lovers. It has all the ingredients you'd expect from a big commercial masala filmbig star cast, drama, action, comedy, songs, the car chases and the big finish, all delivered in Rohit Shetty's unapologetic ishtyle ... Overall, this is a bubblegum blockbuster.\" Meena Iyer of \"Times of India\" gave the movie 3.5 of 5 stars, saying, \"Chennai Express is a magnificently mounted film. In an ode to his own cinemaread Golmaal series or Bol Bachchan, Rohit Shetty, the director, who has grossers in Bollywood's 100-crore club, ups the scale for his Eid offering.\"\n\nSaibal Chatterjee of \"NDTV\" gave the movie 3 of 5 stars and said that, \"The whole-hearted zeal that SRK and Deepika bring to the table and the steady flow of funny one-liners serve Shetty's purpose well, turning Chennai Express into a full-on masala film that is completely unapologetic about its intentions. And that is its USP [Unique Selling Point].\" \"Zee News\" rated the movie 3 of 5 stars, stating that if one ignores the platitudes, the absence of \"punch\" in the script and predictability, then the person is \"onboard for a fun ride\" with Chennai Express. \"India Today\" gave the film 3 stars: \"The good news first. 'Chennai Express' is a pleasant and likeable film in parts. The bad news is, it does nothing for Shah Rukh Khan's imdomitable star power except to tell us he can still play a 40-year [old] Rahul without faltering.\" Abhishek Gupta of \"India TV\" gave it 2.5 stars and wrote, \"The comedy along with the action is rarely served with equal entertainment in today's cinema. We discern Rohit Shetty for his mass leisure which includes cars fluttering from the unknown corners and comedy which isn't slapstick but works.\"\n\nShubhra Gupta of \"The Indian Express\" gave the movie 2.5 out of 5 stars, and wrote that the film comes up with some genuinely funny moments. She commended Padukone's looks, although she criticized aspects of her stagecraft skills. Sukanya Verma of \"Rediff.com\" gave the film 2.5 stars, saying, \"Chennai Express evokes a few laughs but otherwise it decides to shift tracks from droll comedy to dreadful drama.\" Khalid Mohamed of \"Deccan Chronicle\" gave the film 2.5 stars and wrote, \"board Chennai Express at your own risk\". Rajeev Masand of \"CNN-IBN\" gave the film 2/5 rating and said the film was a \"big, fat\" bore. He commented that \"Chennai Express\" was a \"bloated vanity project\", and felt that the lead actor could have performed better. Mayank Shekhar of \"Dainik Bhaskar\" rated it 1 star out of 5, saying, \"You've paid for the ticket? Yes. Now just sit back and suffer.\"\n\nRachel Saltz of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"'Chennai Express' feels like a sumptuous meal with carefully chosen wine and tasty appetizers but a botched main course. Money and visual care have been lavished on this Bollywood action-comedy-romance and glossy stars engaged (Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone). But the movie chugs along for most of its 2 hours and 20 minutes searching for comedy and characters in a frantically overplotted story.\" Sneha May Francis of \"Emirates 24/7\" wrote, \"Rohit Shetty's s(h)tyle of romance relies heavily on buffoonery and will be applauded mainly by Shah Rukh Khan loyalists\". She added, \"Rohit's carnival-like comedy coaxes some laughs, but can leave you exhausted.\" Sneha said that Padukone's performance \"outshines\" that of Khan. Ronnie Scheib of \"Variety\" wrote, \"Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone are ill matched in this overworked comedy/romance/actioner ... Shetty's need to maintain his characters' romantic heroism constantly grates against his depictions of their ridiculousness.\" Simon Foster of the \"Special Broadcasting Service\" gave the film 2 stars out of 5 and described it as \"a loud, lame-brained romantic comedy from the (very) broad directorial brush of Rohit Shetty, SRK's over-hyped vehicle sees the charismatic but ageing actor badly miscast and easily overshadowed by his leading lady, Deepika Padukone.\"\n\nAt the time, \"Chennai Express\" became the highest-grossing Bollywood film, both in India and around the world, when it collected .

{"id": "30189231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30189231", "title": "Cinema of Algeria", "text": "Cinema of Algeria\n\nCinema of Algeria refers to the film industry based in the north African country of Algeria. \n\nDuring the era of French colonization, movies were predominantly a propaganda tool for the French colonial state. Although filmed in Algeria and viewed by the local population, the vast majority of \"Algerian\" cinema in this era was created by Europeans.\n\nThe colonial propaganda films themselves generally depicted a stereotypical image of pastoral life in the colony, often focusing on an aspect of local culture that the administration sought to change, such as polygamy. One example of such a film is Albert Durec's 1928 \"Le Désir\".\n\nPopular French cinema filmed or set in Algeria often echoed many of the tropes common in administration-funded films. For example, L'Atlantide was a wildly popular 1921 French-Belgian silent movie filmed in the Aurès Mountains, Djidjelli, and Algiers in what was then French Algeria. Although not explicitly about Algeria, the movie (itself based on a popular book) depicts two French Foreign Legion officers and their love affair with the lascivious queen of a fictional Saharan kingdom. One of the earliest films to engage with the French presence in North Africa, the film emphasizes not only the romance and exoticism of the venture, but also European anxieties over their role in Africa and the possibly dangerous affects of inter-racial contact. Other films with similar themes followed, including \"Le Bled\" (1929), \"Le Grand Jeu\" (1934), and \"La Bandera\" (1935).\n\nEuropean domination of the means of cinematic production ended in the early days of the Algerian War, when several Algerian nationalists from the National Liberation Army (ALN) obtained basic film-making equipment which they used to create four short programs. These films were screened via a relay system to viewers in a variety of sympathetic socialist nations. Their content supported the growing nationalist rebellion, including the place of ALN hospitals and a Mujahideen attack on the French mines of the Société de l'Ouenza.\n\nAlgeria became an independent nation in 1962, a topic which garnered heavy attention amongst Algerian movie productions of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nMohammed Lakhdar-Hamina's canonical 1967 film \"The Winds of the Aures\" depicts a rural farming family whose lives are destroyed by colonialism and war. The plot depicts the tragic plight of a mother who leaves her home in the Aurès mountains of eastern Algeria to search desperately for her son, a nationalist who has followed in his father's footsteps but been captured by the French army. Symbolically, the film uses the family to represent the fate of the nation: impoverished, exploited, but struggling to be free. The film won an award at the 1967 Cannes Film Festival for Best First Work.\n\nOutside of Algeria, one of the most famous films of this era is The Battle of Algiers (1966), an Algerian-Italian film that obtained three Oscar nominations.\n\nOther examples of Algerian cinema from this era include \"Patrol in the East\" (1972) by \"Amar Laskri\", \"Prohibited Area\" (1972) by \"Ahmed Lallem\", \"The Opium and the Stick\" (1970) by Ahmed Rachedi, Palme d'Or-winner \"Chronicle of the Years of Fire\" (1975) by Mohammed Lakhdar-Hamina, and Costa Gavras' Oscar-winning \"Z\". A notable French-Algerian documentary about the aftermath of the war is the 1963 Peuple en marche.\n\nAlong with decolonization and the Algerian War, the plight of urban youth is another common theme. One example of this theme is Merzak Allouache's \"Omar Guetlato\".\n\nSeveral comedy stars also emerged, including the very popular \"Rouiched\", star of \"Hassan Terro\" or \"Hassan Taxi\". In addition, Hadj Abderrahmane - better known under the pseudonym of the \"Inspector Tahar\" - starred in the 1973 comedy \"The Holiday of The Inspector Tahar\" directed by Musa Haddad. The most famous comedy of this period is \"Carnaval fi dechra\" directed by Mohamed Oukassi, and starting Athman Ariouet.\n\nAlgerian cinema slumped in the mid-1980s, and major productions became rare. Some attribute this fact to the state's unwillingness to subsidize Algerian film. There were a few success, including Mohamed Oukassi's 1994 comedy \"Carnival fi Dachra\", filmed in Maghrebi Arabic and following the story of a man who runs for mayor of his village (or \"dachra\") only to be seduced by power and seek to become the president of Algeria. Director Merzak Allouache's \"Athmane Aliouet\" and \"Salut Cousin!\" (1996) are two other examples of Algerian comedies produced in this era.\n\nSome characterize contemporary Algerian cinema to be in a rebuilding phase. The recent trend has been an increase of Francophone cinema, as opposed to films in Algerian Arabic. Some attribute this to the Francophone market encouraged by increased immigration to France in the 1990s. For example, Franco-Algerian productions such as Rachid Bouchareb's \"Outside the Law\" have met with great success (and controversy).\n\nA full statistical report on the cinema industry in Algeria, edited by Euromed Audiovisual and the European Audiovisual Observatory can be found on the Observatoyr's website here \n\n\n"}

{"id": "307862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=307862", "title": "Fårö", "text": "Fårö\n\nFårö () is a Baltic Sea island just off north of the island of Gotland, itself off mainland Sweden's southeastern coast. It is the second-largest island in the province and it is a popular summer resort. It has its own dialect (\"Faroymal\", a dialect of Gutnish). Formerly a socken which includes the Gotska Sandön island, on 1January 2016, it was reconstituted into the administrative area Fårö District.\n\nThe island is separated from Gotland by the narrow Fårö-strait, and connected by two car ferries, operated by the Swedish Transport Administration. It has a total area of , of which are water areas or islets.\n\nOn the islands of Fårö and Gotland are rock formations called \"Rauk\". They are a result of erosion during the Ice age and are unique to Gotland and Fårö.\n\nThe medieval Fårö Church is on Fårö.\n\nOne of the asteroids in the Asteroid belt, , is named after the island.\n\nThe name \"Fårö\" (in Gutnish \"Faroy\") is derived from the words \"ö\", meaning island, and probably \"far-\", which is a word stem associated with travel like in the Swedish verb \"fara\" (to travel). The word Fårö probably means the island you have to travel to or the traveler's island. Mainland Swedes might misinterpret the name Fårö to be derived from \"får\", the (standard) Swedish word for sheep, due to the many sheep on the island. That word is absent from Modern Gutnish, which uses the word \"lamm\" (which in Swedish means \"lamb\").\n\nUntil the 1990s, Fårö and the North of Gotland were off-limits to foreigners because of a government military installation there. There were large, multilingual signs at the side of the roads informing visitors of this and the prohibition was strictly enforced. After the Cold War ended, the installation (Swedish Coastal Artillery regiment KA 3) was mostly shut down. A relic of the island's military past is a tall radio mast at Holmudden at 57°57'33\" N and 19°20'46\" E.\n\nSwedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman lived and died on Fårö and several of his films were filmed there, among them \"Through a Glass Darkly\" (1961), \"Persona\" (1966), \"Hour of the Wolf\" (1968), \"Shame\" (1968), \"The Passion of Anna\" (1969), and \"Scenes from a Marriage\" (1972), as well as Liv Ullmann’s \"Faithless\" (2000), based on a Bergman screenplay. The Bergman Week is tribute to the filmmaker held on the island every June.\n\nAndrei Tarkovsky wanted to film \"The Sacrifice\" on Fårö but was denied access by the military. \"The Sacrifice\" was filmed further south on Gotland at När.\n\nAn annual event on Fårö is \"Fårönatta\" (Fårö Night), held in September, during which restaurants and bars stay open all night, craft stands are set up and the church holds a midnight Mass.\n\nThe Digerhuvud coast with Bjärge nature reserve is the largest stack area in Sweden, with hundreds of stacks along a part of the coast. Close by is the Helgumannen fishing village. The coast is not suited for swimming due to its depth (up to close to the shore), and its strong currents.\n\nAn asteroid in the Asteroid belt, 10102 Digerhuvud, is named after the area.\n\nThe \"Fårö Lighthouse\" lies on the island's northeastern point. It is high and was built between 1846 and 1847.\n\nThe Langhammars peninsula and the Langhammars nature reserve on north-western Fårö are rocky beaches with Ice age stone monoliths known as rauks. Langhammars was the setting for Ingmar Bergman's film Shame.\n\nThe long, sandy Sudersand beach on north-eastern Fårö lies next to Sudersands Semesterby which rents cabins to tourists.\n\n"}

{"id": "1419615", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1419615", "title": "Herbie Popnecker", "text": "Herbie Popnecker\n\nHerbie Popnecker is a fictional comic book character that first appeared in \"Forbidden Worlds\" #73 in December 1958, published by American Comics Group. He was created by Richard E. Hughes (using the pseudonym \"Shane O'Shea\") and Ogden Whitney.\n\nHerbie is an antithetical hero: short, obese, unstylish, and young. Deriving some of his powers from genetics and some from magical lollipops from \"the Unknown\", Herbie can talk to animals and sometimes even inanimate objects (who all know him by name), fly at high enough speeds to quickly travel to other galaxies (by walking through the sky), become invisible, cast spells and summon spirits from other dimensions, quickly dispatch his enemies with apparent ease, and (once he got his own title) travel through time. Herbie is emotionless, terse, irresistible to women, consulted by world leaders, nearly omnipotent, and more powerful than Satan.\n\nHerbie made several appearances in \"Forbidden Worlds\", in issues #73, #94, #110, #114, and #116—the final two issues with Herbie featured on the cover. Herbie also made a cameo appearance—albeit very much out of character—in \"Unknown Worlds\" #20, published in 1961.\n\nHerbie received his own title, \"Herbie\", in April 1964. The series ran for twenty-three issues until February 1967, shortly before the demise of American Comics Group.\n\nHerbie's parents are unaware of his great powers and fame. His mother is reasonably supportive, however his father, Pincus Popnecker, repeatedly refers to him as a \"little fat nothing\" and wishes he had a son who \"did something\". Pincus believes himself to be a financial genius and, despite his wholesome and conservative \"1950s dad\" appearance, constantly engages in harebrained schemes; he inevitably fails in spectacular fashion and winds up in varying levels of trouble. Herbie is always obliged to bail him out in each circumstance, though the clueless Pincus never notices this and always takes the credit for victory himself.\n\nHerbie is practically always shown with a lollipop, and lollipops are the main subjects of several stories. Herbie can \"bop\" adversaries with his lollipops, immediately defeating them. Herbie intimidates his adversaries by asking them rhetorically, \"You want I should bop you with this here lollipop?\", which almost always results in them backing down.\n\nIn \"Herbie\" #8 (March 1965), Herbie feels a need to become a costumed superhero, but after failing superhero school, he creates the Fat Fury by donning full-body red underwear with a drop seat, a blue cape, a blue plastic mask, and a plunger on his head. He is bare-footed. Herbie's obtuse father then begins to wish that his little fat nothing of a son could be more like the Fat Fury. \n\nAs the Fat Fury, Herbie does not have any powers beyond the many he had before donning the costume. Although Herbie travels back in time, the Fat Fury never does. The Fat Fury was featured in even-numbered \"Herbie\" comics from #8 to #22.\n\n\nThere are many recurring gags in Herbie comics:\n\nIn a review of the Dark Horse Comics collections \"Herbie: Volume One\" and \"Herbie: Volume Two\", \"The New York Times\" described Hughes' Herbie Popnecker as,\nIn the 1990s, there were some attempts to revive Herbie. A-Plus Comics (which had purchased the American Comics Group reprint rights) published six black-and-white issues of reprints in 1991. Dark Horse Comics published two issues of a planned twelve in 1992, the first with a new story by John Byrne. \"Flaming Carrot Comics\" #31 (1994) featured an appearance by Herbie (words and pictures by Bob Burden). America's Comic Group (a publisher affiliated with A+ Comics) published a new story written by Roger Broughton with artwork by Dan Day.\n\nIn 2008, Dark Horse Comics announced that they would reprint the original Herbie stories in a series of hardcover archive volumes. The first Herbie Archives came out in August 2008 () and collects Herbie stories from \"Forbidden Worlds\" #73, 94, 110, 114, 116, \"Unknown Worlds\" #20, and \"Herbie\" #1–5. The second came out in December 2008 (), and collects issues #6–14. The third and final volume came out in April 2009 (), and collects issues #15–23.\n\nHerbie comics received the Alley Award for Best Humor Comic Book 1964 and 1965.\nThe Herbie Archives received the Eisner Award for Best Humor Publication in 2009.\n\n"}

{"id": "3103095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3103095", "title": "Impossible Mission II", "text": "Impossible Mission II\n\nImpossible Mission II is a 1988 computer game developed by Novotrade and published by Epyx. It was released for the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Enterprise 64 and 128, Nintendo Entertainment System, MS-DOS based PCs, Atari ST, Apple IIe with at least 128K, Apple IIc, Apple IIGS and Amiga computers. In 2004, it was one of the games featured on the C64 Direct-to-TV.\n\n\"Impossible Mission II\" is a direct sequel to Epyx's 1984 game \"Impossible Mission\". The game follows directly from the same plot, with Elvin Atombender seeking revenge, and the player having to stop him. The overall game structure and basic gameplay is mostly similar, but there are a few differences and new features.\n\nThe game takes place in Elvin's fortress, which consists of nine towers. Each of the eight outer towers has a specific theme, such as computers, automobiles, furniture and so on. Each tower consists of several rooms connected by two vertical corridors with elevators and two horizontal corridors leading to other towers. The corridors leading between different towers are locked, and can only be unlocked by figuring out a numerical puzzle.\n\nEach tower contains the numbers zero through nine in three different colors. The computer interface allows the player to try various number combinations to see if they are correct.\n\nThe elevator to the central tower is unlocked by finding a password, which is encoded in a piece of music. Each of the eight outer towers has a musical piece locked inside a safe. The final password consists of six distinct musical pieces. Two of the pieces in the towers are duplicates. The player must rewind the tape so that the next musical piece records over the duplicate, erasing it.\n\nThe main addition over the previous game is the addition of new types of enemy robots and devices for the player to use. Whereas the original game only included security bots and a special flying ball robot, \"Impossible Mission II\" has the following types of robots:\nThe \"ball\" type robot is no longer present.\n\nAs well as snoozes that temporarily freeze the robots and lift resets, the player can now collect bombs and mines that can be used to blow up holes in the floor, or to open safes. Bombs explode after a specific time, whereas mines explode if the player or an enemy robot touches them.\n\nUnlike most computer game sequels of the time, \"Impossible Mission II\" did not use any code from the original game. The graphics were remade from scratch using a bitmap animation tool called Film Director. The lead platform was the Atari ST, with work on the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum ports being started once the Atari ST version was nearly complete. All the rooms in \"Impossible Mission II\" were redesigned for the ZX Spectrum version.\n\nAccording to Novotrade programmer László Szenttornyai, who coded the Spectrum version, the NES version of the game \"almost wasn't released because of the strict situation between Epyx and Nintendo.\"\n\nThe game received mixed reviews from critics. Common criticisms were the game's overt similarity to and lack of improvement from the original \"Impossible Mission\" and the extremely limited sound. However, the challenging puzzles, impressive player character animations, and the tension of playing against the clock were all praised by multiple critics.\n\n\"Impossible Mission\" and \"Impossible Mission II\" were followed by \"Impossible Mission 2025\", an Amiga exclusive. \"Impossible Mission 2025\" abandoned the corridor layout of different rooms and instead includes one big room. The player also has the choice of three different characters: the normal secret agent, a female gymnast, and an android.\n\n"}

{"id": "222898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=222898", "title": "Iron Crown Enterprises", "text": "Iron Crown Enterprises\n\nIron Crown Enterprises (ICE) has produced role playing, board, miniature, and collectible card games since 1980. Many of ICE's better-known products were related to J. R. R. Tolkien's world of Middle-earth, but the \"Rolemaster\" rules system, and its science-fiction equivalent, \"Spacemaster\", have been the foundation of ICE's business.\n\nIn college in the late 1970s, while running a six-year \"Dungeons & Dragons\" campaign set in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, Pete Fenlon, S. Coleman Charlton, and Kurt Fischer began to develop a set of unique house rules; after most of them had graduated from the University of Virginia in 1980, many of the group's principals decided to turn their rules into a business and formed Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE), named after a regalia of Middle-earth. Besides Felon and Charlton, the original ICE also included Richard H. Britton, Terry K. Amthor, Bruce Shelley, Bruce Neidlinger, Kurt Fischer, Heike Kubasch, Olivia Fenlon, and a few others.\n\nICE was incorporated in 1980, shortly after the youngest of the principal founders graduated from the University of Virginia. Among the founders were Pete Fenlon (then in Law school), Rick Britton, S. Coleman Charlton, Bruce Neidlinger, Terry K. Amthor, Kurt Fischer, Bruce Shelley, and Heike Kubasch. The company originally only had a few full-time staff, relying on volunteer work from the other founders. But as income increased, it brought more on as employees.\n\nICE quickly published three products: \"Arms Law\" (1980), \"The Iron Wind\" (1980), and \"Manassas\" (1981). \"Arms Law\" was the first release of the house rules from the University of Virginia days, and thus became the start of \"Rolemaster\", although at that time \"Rolemaster\" was not seen as a standalone RPG but was offered as an alternative combat system for \"AD&D\". \"The Iron Wind\" was a system-generic campaign centered on a fantastic island, and although it was unsupplemented for years it would eventually be recognized as the first release in ICE's \"Loremaster\" campaign setting. \"Manassas\" was a Civil War era wargame set in ICE's home state of Virginia.\n\nICE began by publishing a series of rules supplements, beginning with \"Arms Law\", which were intended to serve as modular add-ons to other RPG systems offering greater detail. This was followed by \"Spell Law\" and Character/Campaign Law.\" In time, these supplements were tied together to form an RPG system of their own, \"Rolemaster\". Concurrent with the rules supplements, ICE began releasing world campaign content materials in what was originally called the \"Loremaster\" series, beginning with \"Iron Wind\".\n\n\"Rolemaster\" had grown out of a Middle-earth game, so ICE approached Tolkien Enterprises seeking a license to \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\", which Tolkien Enterprises granted because no one else had ever asked. Tolkien Enterprises signed an exclusive, worldwide license with ICE in 1982, and ICE started the Middle-earth line off with a generic sourcebook that could be used with AD&D or other games, called \"A Campaign and Adventure Guidebook for Middle-earth\" (1982).\n\nThe company enjoyed a sudden jump in status when it acquired the license to produce an official fantasy RPG based upon J. R. R. Tolkien's world of Middle-earth, which would come to be known as \"MERP\" (\"Middle-earth Role Playing\"). According to some interpretations, at the time of its publication ICE's \"Middle-earth Role Playing\" was the second best selling fantasy RPG after TSR's \"Dungeons & Dragons\".\n\nICE then added the science fiction RPGs \"Spacemaster\" and \"Cyberspace\" to its line, and, with the rise of collectible card games, the \"Middle-earth Collectible Card Game\". ICE also published a moderately successful space miniatures battle game called \"Silent Death\", based on \"Spacemaster\" but with simpler mechanics. \"Silent Death\" was released in two major editions, with supplemental books and a fair number of paintable lead miniatures. ICE also expanded its original Loremaster supplements into a full-blown fantasy world to support Rolemaster, called the Shadow World, supported by dozens of adventures and sourcebooks. ICE signed in 1986 a publication contract to take over Hero Games' production and distribution. Later with Hero Games staff leaving for other jobs, ICE took over the creative reins of Hero's products.\n\nIron Crown branched out into the solo gaming books under the Tolkien Quest (later called Middle-earth Quest) and Sherlock Holmes Solo Mysteries book lines. Unknown to ICE at the time, the Middle-earth Quest books violated ICE and Tolkien Enterprises' contract with Tolkien's book publishing licensee, George Allen & Unwin. (ICE and TE considered the books to be games, and so fall under their license, but the format came too close to being literary books). ICE was forced to recall and destroy the whole line of books, at devastating cost. Meanwhile, ICE sued the Narnia licensor as they turned out to not have the necessary rights to license Narnia to ICE. That company went bankrupt from the legal settlement and was unable to pay ICE their damages. ICE reached terms in 1988 for a gamebook license with the estate of J.R.R. Tolkien and George Allen & Unwin for four new Middle-earth Quest books, beginning with \"Spy in Isengard\". However, the solo game book market was going soft by this time. ICE canceled all solo game book lines, with dozens of books still in development. Returns were high on the Sherlock Holmes Solo Mysteries line. All this brought ICE to near bankruptcy in a \"voluntary-type of receivership\".\n\nDespite ICE's many successes and overcoming many setbacks over 17 years, in 1997 ICE suffered financial difficulties from a rapid decline in its distribution net; nearly 70% of ICE's distributors either went bankrupt or became moribund. There has been some debate over whether Tolkien Enterprises forced ICE into bankruptcy in order to get the gaming license in anticipation of the upcoming new movie franchise.\n\nThe company entered bankruptcy and filed for Chapter 7 in October 2000. This bankruptcy cost ICE the Middle-earth license, ending both the MERP and CCG lines. Many of the authors and illustrators were not paid for substantial amounts of work.\n\nIn December 2001, ICE's assets were purchased by Aurigas Aldebaron LLLC, an intellectual property ownership company backed by several wealthy individuals. The new owners licensed the Iron Crown Enterprise name and other assets to Mjolnir LLC until 2011. Starting in January 2011, licensing was transferred to Guild Companion Publications Ltd.\n\nIn 2016 Aurigas Alderbaron merged with Guild Companion Publications Ltd to create a single company: Guild Companion Publications. This company both holds the Iron Crown Enterprises intellectual property and produces and sells Iron Crown products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its software was used by several online publications. By 2013, page views for the company reached about seven to eight billion per month. Publications are available in thirty different languages.\nIn 2014, the company released Clip, a tool that allows readers to take a snapshot of any part of a publication and share that on social media or through email. That year the company had around 80 million monthly unique visitors, with 32 million monthly arriving from web or mobile searches. In 2014 Issuu also partnered with LinkedIn, which built-in Issuu magazine integration into basic LinkedIn profiles. In 2015 the number was around 85 million unique visitors per month, with 21 million publications publishing through Issuu (amounting to about 15,000 new publications per day).\n\nIn early 2013, the company opened an office in Palo Alto, California and appointed CEO Joe Hyrkin, formerly of Reverb, Trinity Ventures, and Yahoo!, to helm its Silicon Valley operations. The company soon moved its headquarters to the Palo Alto location. Upon the move, the founders of Issuu stated that they chose the city as they saw social media and digital distribution partnerships as the key to its growth, rather than focusing mostly on publishing relationships.\n\nIn July 2014, Issuu raised $10 million in a Series B round to bring the total capital it has raised since it was founded to $21.5 million. That round of investment was led by KDDI and Sunstone. In 2012 Issuu partnered with Peecho, to embed a cloud printing button into Issuu publication documents. In 2013 Issuu acquired publishing software maker Magma. In 2014 Issuu partnered with LinkedIn, which built in Issuu magazine integration into basic LinkedIn profiles. In January 2016, Micromedia Publications began publishing its seven weekly newspapers through the Issuu service.\n\nIn 2014 Issuu released its iOS app to access Issuu on Apple devices. The app includes an offline reading list function that allows users to read from the Issuu app without being online. The app can also stack publications back to back so that they can be read in succession. Initially the app was released on Android in January, and received between one and five million downloads over the front part of 2014. Previous to the launch of the company’s 2014 apps, Apple had rejected an app from Issuu three times during 2009 (before the company expanded into the US).\n\nIn 2008, the site was a South by Southwest (SXSW) finalist. In 2009, Issuu was named one of \"TIME\"&apos;s 50 Best Websites. Since then, Issuu has hosted the scam site 1340 Art Magazine. Despite alarms raised since at least 2017, over submission fees to a nominally existent magazine, and uncompensated sublicensing of submitted art, Issuu has not posted a warning or issued a statement regarding the matter, as of April 2018. The company began offering paid subscriptions in October of 2017. By April 2018, Issuu app users were reporting unauthorized charges on their credit cards for up to $420.\n\n"}

The film is the fifth entry in the \"Kickboxer\" franchise and the first to have a plot that does not revolve around a member of the Sloane family. It instead revolves around a character named Matt Reeves, said in dialogue to be a friend of the Sloane family.\n\nNegaal is a South African former kickboxer turned promoter who is gearing up to start his own kickboxing organization. When American champion David Sloane refuses to join, Negaal sends his men Moon, Bull, and Pinto to eliminate Sloane. Seen in a bluescreen opening credit sequence, Sloane manages to break Moon's leg but is ultimately killed by Bull and Pinto. \n\nMatt Reeves is a former kickboxer turned martial arts teacher. As a friend of Sloane's, he is shocked to learn of his death. That night, his one-time student Johnny Styles is competing for the now vacant United States Championship. When Johnny wins the title, he is approached by Moon, Bull, and Pinto to join the Negaal Kickboxing Federation. Johnny decides to meet with the trio but Matt is suspicious. When his friend Charlie informs him that the three men also talked to David just two days before he was found murdered, Matt races to find Johnny. Johnny refuses the offer from Negaal and is forced to fight Bull and Pinto who overwhelm him and break his back. Matt arrives to fend them off but he is too late to help Johnny. \n\nWhen Negaal gets word of what has happened, he wants Matt dead. Bollen, Negaal's right hand man, recruits Paul Croft, a former member of Negaal's organization who is freed from prison on the condition he kills Matt. That night, Matt is confronted by Paul, who instead of killing him, warns him about Negaal. Matt decides to head to Johannesburg, South Africa to find Negaal. Paul finds out Matt is on the plane and the two end up sitting next to each other. When they arrive at the airport, Moon is awaiting Paul, who hides Matt in an attempt to prove he did his job. However, Paul attempts to escape and is confronted by Negaal's thugs until Matt arrives to help. Shocked by the turn of events, Moon escapes as does the thugs. Matt and Paul part ways and when Matt finds an address, he goes there to find a regular shop. When he inquires the shopkeeper about Negaal, Bollen just happens to be there and both he and his men attempt to go after Matt. Returning the favor from the airport incident, Paul arrives to help Matt. It is also revealed that it was Bollen who sent Paul to prison in the first place and Paul wants revenge. The duo fight off the thugs, but then find themselves arrested for causing trouble at the shop when Bollen forces the shopkeeper to rat on them. \n\nMeanwhile, Negaal has been presenting champions from all over the world with an ultimatum: join his federation or die. Fearing for his life, the French Champion reluctantly joins. After the two incidents involving Matt and Paul, Negaal confronts Moon, Bull, and Bollen and proceeds to shoot Bull in the head with a hunting rifle. When the German Champion refuses to join the federation, he challenges Negaal to a fight on the lawn. Negaal kills the German Champion with the \"tiger claw\", an illegal strike that he had used on the Dutch Champion years ago when he was a kickboxer, resulting in him getting a lifetime ban from the sport. \n\nWith the help of fellow prisoner Joseph, Matt and Paul escape when one of the guards was revealed to be one of Negaal's men. The trio make their escape and separate with Matt and Paul catching up to Angie, who is revealed to be Paul's younger sister. She is wondering what is going on and is unhappy when it is revealed that Negaal is the reason. While Paul served his prison sentence, the patriarch of the Croft family had died. Matt and Paul convince Angie that they must stop Negaal once and for all if they are to ever be happy again. Both men begin to train with Matt discovering a way to counter Negaal's fatal blow when he breaks an arrow using his neck muscles to show that a fatal blow can in fact, be countered. As they learn Negaal is planning a major party, they decide to crash it along with Angie, who defies Matt and Paul and goes undercover as well.\n\nWhen Paul finally confronts Bollen in the backyard, Matt sees Negaal at the roulette table and begins to win, angering Negaal. When Negaal learns that the man who is winning is the one he's been after this whole time, Matt finally exposes Negaal to everyone for who he really is. The goons arrive and Matt defeats them all and finally is ready to take on Negaal. As the two begin their fight, they go from Negaal's office to the lawn. When Negaal attempts the \"tiger claw\" to Matt's neck, Matt uses his counter technique and unleashes a \"tiger claw\" of his own hitting Negaal right in the heart. Negaal falls and Matt proceeds back to the office, where he grabs the United States Championship belt. Negaal returns to grab the belt back. Repeating \"It's mine\", Matt's \"tiger claw\" finally takes its effect and Negaal finally dies. Matt retrieves the belt as he, Paul, and Angie walk off as police sirens are heard.\n\n"}

Their parents, Jane and Philip Jamison, were writers and painters. The Jamisons attended Temple University, and later worked as painters and performance artists.\n\nAfter leaving West Chester, they moved to Los Angeles and refocused their career as psychics, calling themselves \"The Psychic Twins\", reportedly charging more than $500 per person for psychic readings. According to the Jamisons, they have predicted the future and contacted spirits of the dead, such as Lady Diana, Natalie Wood and Michael Jackson.\n\nThe Jamisons predictions have often been featured in tabloid newspapers such as \"The Sun\", and according to the Jamisons, they have made numerous appearances in print, television, and on stage with \"major stars\".\n\nThe Jamisons widely claim to have predicted the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center during a November 2, 1999 interview on the Art Bell radio show.

Since 2011, he has been a Conservative Party life peer in the House of Lords.\n\nGrade was born into a Jewish show business family originally called Winogradsky; his father was the theatrical agent Leslie Grade and his uncles were the impresarios Lew Grade and Bernard Delfont. When he was three years old his mother left the family to conduct a relationship with wrestling commentator Kent Walton. Grade was brought up by his grandmother, and only saw his non-Jewish mother once more as an adult. He was educated at Stowe School in Buckinghamshire and St Dunstan's College in London.\n\nGrade joined the \"Daily Mirror\" in 1960, and was a sports columnist from 1964 to 1966. By his own account (as related on Channel 4 chat show \"The Late Clive James\"), the job had been organised by his father. When Leslie Grade suffered a serious stroke in 1966, the 23-year-old Michael moved into his theatrical business. In 1969, he moved to London Management & Representation. Among the artists whom Grade represented were Morecambe and Wise (he successfully negotiated the duo's defection from ATV to BBC2 in 1968) and Larry Grayson.\n\nGrade entered the television industry in 1973 when he joined London Weekend Television (LWT) as Deputy Controller of Programmes (Entertainment).

Adapted as \"The Fosters\" (1976–77), it became the first British sitcom to have an entirely black cast. At LWT, Grade worked with both John Birt and Greg Dyke.\n\nAfter he became Director of Programmes in 1977, Grade commissioned the series \"Mind Your Language\", but later cancelled it. At an event at the Edinburgh Television Festival in 1985, he agreed that the series was racist, and said that \"it was really irresponsible of us to put it out\". In what was termed 'Snatch of the Day' by the press in 1978, Grade attempted the acquisition of exclusive screening rights to Football League matches. Previously the BBC had held the more desirable rights, but the Office of Fair Trading intervened, and Grade's purchase was revoked. The package of recorded highlights on Saturday evenings now alternating each season between ITV and the BBC.\n\nAlso in 1978, Grade managed to place under contract the entertainer Bruce Forsyth who had helped the BBC to dominate the Saturday evening television ratings through the decade via \"The Generation Game\" series. His new vehicle was titled \"Bruce Forsyth's Big Night\" and was intended to feature all his talents in one programme lasting two hours. The budget was £2million for a fourteen-week run. The new series was considered a disaster, with the press turning against the host, but did achieve an initial audience of 14 million. \"The Generation Game\", with new host Larry Grayson, managed to achieve a larger audience. LWT's \"Big Night\" was not re-commissioned.\n\nGrade announced at a press conference in May 1979 that LWT had secured a contract with a production company formed by television dramatist Dennis Potter and his producer Kenith Trodd. The corporate association proved short-lived, with both sides having insufficient experience for budgeting drama shot on film, and was terminated by Grade in the summer of 1980. Only three of what had been projected as six filmed plays by Potter were shot and screened. Grade though, was directly involved with some of the playwright's later commissions.\n\nGrade approved production of \"The Professionals\" and initiated the long-running arts' programme \"The South Bank Show\".\n\nIn 1981, Grade left LWT to begin a two-year period as the president of Embassy Television in the United States. In \"The Times\" he was quoted as stating, \"It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; it is, if you like, a gamble I want to take\". His pay rose from £32,000 to $250,000 per annum. During this time he was largely involved in developing and selling sitcoms in this period: \"When you read 30 or 40 comedy scripts a week, you get a bit barking.\" Grade produced for the only time in his career his only series, a nine-part adaptation of \"Kane and Abel\", the novel by Jeffrey Archer. In a \"Jewish Chronicle\" interview with Michael Freedland in 2011, Grade said he had \"missed public service broadcasting, real drama, news, current affairs\".\n\nGrade joined BBC Television in 1984 as Controller of BBC 1, taking \"the biggest pay cut in history\" he told Michael Freedland; his salary went down from $500,000, excluding large bonuses to £37,000 a year. Later he became Director of Programmes in 1986, and Managing Director Designate in 1987. His tenure as Controller was rocky.\n\nGrade cancelled \"Dallas\" while fighting Thames Television for the rights to the series (although this decision was subsequently reversed). He cut short the expensive serialisation of \"The Tripods\" trilogy, written by John Christopher, because he was dissatisfied with the ratings it had achieved after two seasons. He also considered cancelling the sitcom \"Blackadder\", judging the first series to be unfunny. In exchange for renewing \"Blackadder\", he required that it become a wholly studio-based production on a lower budget.\n\nGrade agreed the BBC should make Dennis Potter's \"The Singing Detective\" (1986) after a brief meeting with Jonathan Powell, then the BBC's Head of Drama. It was a highlight of this period, but came under criticism from Mary Whitehouse and the tabloid press for its content. Referring to the depiction of an illicit sexual encounter in Episode Three, Grade said: \"There are very few people in television drama that you are prepared to trust with scenes like this. But Dennis Potter is one of them\".\n\nDuring his time as Controller, Grade was also responsible for purchasing the Australian soap opera \"Neighbours\" for BBC1's new daytime schedule; it debuted on British television on 27 October 1986. He was also responsible for repeating \"Neighbours\", at first exclusively an afternoon programme, in a later timeslot (on the advice of his daughter, Alison, who was annoyed that she could not watch it due to her being at school). This proved to be a successful scheduling decision, with audiences in excess of 18 million for the new 5.35 pm broadcasts. Other successes during Grade's tenure included the debut of soap operas \"EastEnders\" and \"Howards' Way\", and the broadcast of the charity rock concert Live Aid.\n\nIt was announced in February 1985 that the next series of \"Doctor Who\", scheduled to run from January 1986, would be postponed as Grade had decided that the programme's budget would be better spent on other drama productions. What became an 18-month hiatus for \"Doctor Who\" (the series did not resume until September 1986) prompted a strong reaction from viewers. In an interview in 2004, Grade said of the series: \"I thought it was horrible, awful. I thought it was so outdated. It was just a little show for a few pointy head \"Doctor Who\" fans. It was also very violent and it had lost its magic\". In an appearance on the BBC's \"Room 101\" in 2002, Grade chose the series as one of his hates, criticised its production values and admitted that he had little interest in, or sympathy for, science fiction.\n\nEric Saward, the script editor of \"Doctor Who\" at the time of its suspension, responded to Grade's criticism a few years later. In his view, Grade's comments were unfair because he was in the position to allocate more resources to the programme and thus improve its quality. However, actress Katy Manning, who had portrayed a companion of Jon Pertwee's Doctor, praised Grade's treatment of the series on the DVD commentary for \"The Mind of Evil\". In her view, Grade \"was actually doing the right thing\", and she credited the long break with rejuvenating the series.\n\nIn 1986, Grade decided to fire actor Colin Baker from the title role of \"Doctor Who\". Years later he explained that he thought Baker's portrayal of the Doctor was \"utterly unlikeable; absolutely God-awful in fact\".\n\nFollowing the end of the first series of the revived \"Doctor Who\" in 2005, he wrote a letter to Mark Thompson, the BBC Director General, congratulating all involved in the production on its success, signing-off with \"PS never dreamed I would ever write this. Must be going soft!\" In an interview for the \"Radio Times\" in 2012, Grade commented: \"From clunky Daleks that couldn't go up and down stairs to the filmic qualities today of \"Doctor Who\", it's a transformation... The show still leaves me cold, but I admire it, which I never did before.\"\n\nGrade accepted the post of chief executive of Channel 4, succeeding Jeremy Isaacs, and taking up his post at the beginning of 1988. It was a decision which led Isaacs to criticise the appointment and to threaten to \"throttle\" Grade if the nature of the Channel was altered.\n\nHe phased out some of its more high-brow programming, for which he was accused of \"dumbing down\"; Grade retorted that in the same week that he moved to Channel 4, it had shown a repeat of the 1984 adaptation of \"The Far Pavilions\", featuring American actress Amy Irving \"blacked up\" as an Indian princess. During this period, he was also attacked by the conservative press: \"Daily Mail\" columnist Paul Johnson dubbed him Britain's \"pornographer-in-chief\".\n\nGrade was successful in developing the station at a time when Channel 4 was obliged to award a proportion of its advertising revenue to the rival ITV network. In addition to securing talent from the BBC, he recognised the improving quality of US television output, making series such as \"Friends\" and \"ER\" the mainstays of the channel's schedule. Grade became involved in a dispute with Chris Morris regarding the satire \"Brass Eye\" after repeatedly intervening in the production to order edits to various episodes, and re-scheduling some instalments for sensitivity.\n\nGrade left Channel 4 in 1997 to head First Leisure Corporation, He departed two years later, following a substantial internal re-structuring, to return to the media industry as chairman of the new Pinewood and Shepperton Film Studios Company.\n\nGrade was on the board of the poorly received Millennium Dome project, and has served as chairman of Octopus Publishing, the Camelot Group, and Hemscott (a position that he intends to relinquish).\n\nHe had ambitions to become Chairman of the BBC Board of Governors in 2001, but was beaten to the post by Gavyn Davies. Following Davies' resignation in the aftermath of the Hutton Inquiry report, it was announced on 2 April 2004 that Grade had been appointed BBC Chairman; his only demand was that he would not have to give up his job as a director of Charlton Athletic F.C. He took up his post on 17 May.\n\nOn 19 September 2006, Grade became non-executive chairman of online food delivery company Ocado. He resigned from the role on 23 January 2013, after which he was replaced by Sir Stuart Rose.\n\nOn 28 November 2006, Grade and the BBC confirmed that he was to resign from his position within the corporation to replace Sir Peter Burt as Chairman, and Charles Allen as Chief Executive, of one of the companies forming part of its commercial rival, ITV. He became Executive Chairman of ITV plc on 8 January 2007.\n\nDuring Grade's tenure, ITV has struggled with falling advertising revenue and viewing figures. Upon appointment, Grade announced that his first priority would be to work as a senior partner at ITV Network Limited to improve ITV programming, as well as strengthen its digital channels, ITV2, ITV3, ITV4 and CITV. On 12 September 2007, Grade announced a controversial five-year re-structuring plan for ITV plc-owned regions, selecting entertainment as the top priority. A major overhaul of ITV plc's regional structure was also proposed. The plans would result in the consolidation of the ITV regional news programmes in England, with regions now broadcasting a single service per region rather than multiple, specialised, local services (for example, ITV Yorkshire would no longer broadcast in separate Northern and Southern regions). They would also merge fully ITV Border with ITV Tyne Tees, and ITV West with ITV Westcountry, effectively ending two regions' tenure as independent players within ITV; the proposals have been criticised by BECTU and the National Union of Journalists. Any such changes would be subject to approval by Ofcom.\n\nIn March 2009, Grade initiated libel action against another television executive, Greg Dyke, and \"The Times\" newspaper over allegations of improper conduct made by Dyke about Grade, relating to his move from the BBC to ITV in 2006. The newspaper subsequently withdrew the allegations and published an apology, admitting that the allegations had no justification.\n\nOn 23 April 2009, Grade announced he would be stepping down as chief executive to become non-executive chairman at the conclusion of regulatory reviews into advertising contract rights and digital TV, at some point before the end of 2009.\n\nGrade was appointed a CBE in 1998. That same year, he published his autobiography, \"It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time\", and married his third wife, Francesca Leahy; they have a son, Samuel.\n\nHe was previously married to Penelope Jane Levinson (1967–81; she is now the wife of writer and historian Sir Max Hastings), by whom he has two children, and Sarah Lawson (1982–91), a film producer.\n\nGrade is a fan of Charlton Athletic F.C.\n\nGrade revealed his membership of the Conservative Party for the first time in May 2010. On 25 January 2011, he was created a life peer, as Baron Grade of Yarmouth, of Yarmouth in the County of Isle of Wight. He was introduced in the House of Lords on 27 January and sits as a Conservative.\n\n"}

On the website, the anonymous fan claimed that if Miley Cyrus did not come back to Twitter by November 16 (a deadline which was later extended to November 22), their cat, Fuzzy, would be killed and eaten.

For example, a songwriter might align downbeats or accents with stressed syllables or important words, or create musical accompaniment to the meter of the lyrics. Also, prosody can mean how the music supports the connotation, or emotive nature, of a song.\n\nAny musical work with a singer, regardless of the genre, requires its composer or songwriter to examine the interplay between the music and the words. For example, the mood of the music typically matches that of the lyrical content: for example, when the lyrics address a sad topic, the music would sound sad. Of course, composers might work differently, setting a textual mood against a contrasting musical mood. However, the term \"prosody\" tends to refer not to the matching of music with content, but with the matching of a melody with the language itself, so that the words being sung come across as naturally as possible. According to Mark Altrogge: \"Generally when writing songs and poetry, we want to accent a phrase like we'd speak it.\" Melodies that do not come relatively close to approximating speech make the words hard to understand; melodies that go beyond the point of clarity and come even closer to approximating speech make the singer sound more human and therefore have a stronger emotional impact on the listener.\n\nA melody with good prosody will not assign long notes to relatively insignificant syllables, nor will it put them on the beat or give them any sort of accentuation. The musical phrases will match the grammatical phrases, so that musical pauses happen in places that would be natural for a speaker.\n\n"}
{"id": "14461798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14461798", "title": "Prostitution in Norway", "text": "Prostitution in Norway\n\nProstitution () in Norway is illegal, in that offering consideration for sexual acts (\"seksuelle tjenester\" or \"seksuelle ytelser\"), but not selling sex, is a criminal offence. The Norwegian law prohibiting the buying of sexual acts (\"sexkjøpsloven\") came into effect on 1 January 2009, following the passing of new legislation by the Norwegian parliament (\"Storting\") in November 2008.\n\nIn early times, proscription of prostitution fell under more general laws on fornication and adultery, particularly after the Reformation. Around this time, sexual acts started to be moved from civil law (largely with fines) to criminal law. For instance, in one part of Mediaeval law, the Frostathing Law, it is stated, \"If a woman lies with a man whom she is not allowed to possess, she owes a fine of three marks, just as he does with whom she lies\". Regulation of sexuality in the High Middle Ages was largely a function of the Church, for whom only heterosexual sexual relations within marriage were acceptable. Despite this, prostitution was not considered amongst the most serious sexual crimes, but was frequently associated with other nuisances such as gambling, drinking, and causing a disturbance.\n\nProstitution was criminalized in Norway with the introduction of the new Criminal Code (\"Norske Lov\") in 1842, but was made legal again when the Penal Code (\"Straffeloven\") was revised in 1902, when the prohibition of both the sale and purchase of sex was lifted. However, even during that time, it was actually tolerated and regulated in practice, in the larger cities such as Oslo, Bergen, and Trondheim. While prostitution was defined as an immoral vice, it was street prostitution that was especially frowned upon, being visible. It was also considered important to distinguish between \"decent\" and \"indecent\" women. The regulation of prostitution in Europe (\"Regulationism\") was closely tied to the concept that prostitution was a source of venereal disease, requiring medical supervision. \nThis form of regulation first appeared in Bergen, then the largest Norwegian municipality, in 1816, in (what is now known as) Oslo in 1840, and Trondheim in 1844. Regulation was at least on the surface contrary to the Penal Code which had made fornication and hence prostitution a criminal offence in 1842. In practice the latter law was considered only to apply to males.\n\nThe media, the church, and social commentators started to express concerns about prostitution which was labelled as \"The Great Social Evil\". Various institutions stated a desire to rescue 'fallen women', and help them exit their trade and 're-enter society', training them for positions such as domestic servants.\n\nIn the mid-nineteenth century, there was a growth of organized society, in which religious and philanthropic organizations developed, many of which had a predominance of women members. Amongst these were \"societies for the defense of moral standards\", concerned \"inter alia\" with prostitution and the government's failure to deal with it. (UNESCO 1989, p. 13)\n\nBrothels were eventually prohibited in Norway in 1887 as part of a pan-European moral reform campaign of \"Abolitionism\" that replaced Regulationism and was supposed to end prostitution. The change in the Penal Code in 1902 did not, however, mean that prostitution was more tolerated by society. The exchange of sex in one's own home was now legal, but loitering and procurement was not, and women seen selling sex in public were directed to \"rehabilitation\" programs.\n\nA Pan-Scandinavian conference on prostitution was held in Lillehammer in 1993. Sex workers participated, and the emphasis was on harm reduction. Liv Jessen from Pro-Sentret compared this to the punitive approach of the radical \"Women's Front\" (\"Kvinnefronten\"), a feminist activist group. The debate on what to do was to continue for another 30 years. \"Kvinnenfronten\" had been founded in 1972, and was to work for a change in the law over all of that time.\n\nThe criminal Code deals with organized crime (Section 60a), third parties (\"tredjeparts\"), and procurers, such as pimps (, \"halliker\" (pl.)) or madams (S 202), purchase of sexual \"services\" (S 202a), purchase under 18 (S 203), and human trafficking () (S 224).\n\nSection 60a<br> \n\"If a criminal act has been committed as part of the activity of an organized criminal group, the maximum penalty laid down in the penal provision shall be increased to double its prescribed limit, but not by more than five years' imprisonment.\nAn organized criminal group is here defined as an organized group of three or more persons whose main purpose is to commit an act that is punishable by imprisonment for a term of not less than three years, or whose activity largely consists of committing such acts. An increase of the maximum penalty pursuant to the present provision shall be applicable in relation to statutory provisions that give legal effect to the penalty limit, unless it is otherwise provided.\"\nSection 202 <br> \n\"Anyone who\na) promotes the engagement of other persons in prostitution, or\nb) lets premises on the understanding that such premises shall be used for prostitution or is grossly negligent in this respect\n\nshall be liable to fines or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.\n\nAny person who in a public announcement unambiguously offers, arranges or asks for prostitution shall be liable to fines or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.\n\nIn this provision, prostitution means that a person engages in sexual activity or commits a sexual act with another person in return for payment.\"\n\nSection 202a <br> \n\"Any person who\na) procures sexual intercourse or any other sexual act, for himself/herself or for another person, in return for payment or agreement to provide payment,\nb) procures sexual intercourse or any other sexual act in return for another person paying or agreeing to pay, or\nc) in the manner described in a) or b) above induces someone to carry out acts that are equivalent to sexual intercourse with himself/herself\n\nshall be liable to a fine or up to 6 months' imprisonment or both.\n\nIf the sexual intercourse or act has been particularly humiliating in its nature, but it is not punishable under any other law, the punishment is imprisonment for a term of up to 1 year.\"\n\nSection 203<br> \n\"Any person who, in return for payment, procures sexual intercourse or any other sexual act from a person under the age of 18, shall be liable to a fine or up to 2 years’ imprisonment. Being mistaken about someone’s age does not affect criminal liability, unless diligent good faith has been shown.\"\n\nSection 224<br> \n\"Any person who by force, threats, abuse of another person's vulnerability or other improper conduct exploits another person for the purpose of\na) prostitution or other sexual purposes,\nb) forced labour or forced services, including begging,\nc) military service in a foreign country, or\nd) removal of any of the said person's organs,\nor who induces another person to allow himself or herself to be used for such purposes, shall be guilty of human trafficking, and shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.\n\nAny person who\na) makes arrangements for such exploitation or inducement as is mentioned in the first paragraph by procuring, transporting or receiving the person concerned,\nb) in any other way aids and abets such exploitation or inducement, or\nc) provides payment or any other advantage in order to obtain consent to such exploitation from any person who is in a position of authority over the aggrieved party, or who receives such payment or other advantage shall be liable to the same penalty.\n\nAny person who commits an act referred to in the first or second paragraph against a person who is under the age of 18 shall be liable to a penalty independently of any use of force or threats, abuse of a person’s vulnerability, or other improper conduct. Being mistaken about someone’s age does not affect criminal liability, unless diligent good faith has been shown.\n\nGross human trafficking is punishable by imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years. In deciding whether the offence is gross, particular importance shall be attached to whether the person exposed to the act was under the age of 18, whether gross violence or coercion was used or whether the act led to considerable gain.\"\n\nThe Planning and Building Act<br>\nSpecifies requirements for premises where commercial activities take place, used to close massage parlours occupying premises that do not meet the requirements for commercial activities.\n\nTax and VAT<br>\nAll income is taxable, including income from prostitution, but implementation varies. Some people have been made to pay tax on their estimated earnings from prostitution, while some have registered as self-employed, to benefit from the rights that taxpayers have. Most services are liable to VAT.\n\nWelfare <br>\nProstitution is not considered legal work in Norway. Those entitled to social welfare benefits may claim economical support from NAV when not employed and indigent.\n\nImmigration Act <br>\nIt is for foreigners to work as prostitutes in Norway, because prostitution is not considered legal work. \"Section 27\" states that foreigners can be deported for breaches of the peace.\n\nPolice Act<br>\n\"Section 7\" (Public order and peace) allows the police to stop breaches of the peace or intervene when there is reason to fear such a breach.\n\nChild Welfare Act<br>\nProtects and gives rights to children under the age of 18. If a child is in the company of sex workers, this may lead to intervention under the act. All government employees have a duty to report to the child welfare authorities if they see a child who may be suffering from neglect.\n\nCommunicable Diseases Control Act<br>\nEntitles residents to preventive care, diagnosis and treatment for such diseases. It does not allow collective restrictions to be imposed on sex workers.\n\nIn 2013, it was estimated there were 3,000 sex workers (\"prostituert\", \"prostituerte\" (pl.)) working in Norway (population 5 million). Earnings from sex trade are estimated at 390 million kroner (£39m., $US63m., €48m.).\n\nNorwegian prostitutes make a clear distinction between the term \"prostitute\" and \"sex worker\", seeing \"prostitution\" as a derogatory word (\"nedlatende ord\"). They also describe themselves as \"gledespike\" (literally, \"fille de joie\"), or \"hjelpepleier\" (health worker). As in most countries, prostitution takes on a number of different forms, including street prostitution (\"Gateprostitusjon\") and indoor prostitution in brothels (\"\", \"bordeller\" (pl.)). Technically, both street work and brothel operations (\"bordellvirksomhet\") are legal, even though purchase of those \"services\" is not, but as with other countries, technological change has resulted in a shift to offering \"services\" from street solicitation to mobile phones and the internet. While brothels are technically legal in that there is no explicit law banning then (\"de jure\"), the sex purchase ban prevents them operating overtly (\"de facto\"). As a form of protest, it was suggested that some sex workers might operate free brothels that circumvent the ban, to make this point. Later, it was stated that this was an exercise designed primarily to stimulate debate on the issue.\n\nThe current law banning purchase creates an administrative anomaly, since any money earned is illegal, yet is taxable. Recent legislative proposals have included a ban on advertising. Some sex workers have complained about the lack of government consultation with them. In July 2014, the Nadheim City Mission has reported that street prostitution levels in Norway have returned to those prior to the introduction of the law in 2009.\n\nThe possibility of criminalizing the purchase of sex was discussed in an official report in 1997; \n\nhowever, neither the Justice Department (\"Justis- og politidepartementet\") nor the Storting (Parliament) were in favour of taking this step. The Department did, however, promise to re-look at the situation in two years.\n\nNorway then criminalized the purchase of sex from people under the age of 18 in 2000 (Law 76, 11 August; Penal Code art. §203). \n\nAlthough Sweden had banned the purchase of sex in 1999, opinions remained divided in Norway. In 2003, as part of its \"Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Women and Children\"\nthe Justice Ministry investigated the situation in both the Netherlands (which had recently legalized brothels) and Sweden to better inform the debate, and concluded that neither approach would be appropriate at that point. \nThe working group for this report was chaired by Professor Ulf Stridbeck, of Oslo University's law school.\n\nWith regard's to Sweden's law, the group found that reliable data was unavailable, the law was difficult to enforce, and had had little impact (p. 23).\n\nThe difference between the two countries they saw was the different way they defined prostitution, and hence approached it (p. 45). They were particularly concerned about the unintended effects of the Swedish approach (p. 52).\n\nThe debate which finally led to the introduction of the sex purchase ban concerned the effects of the arrival of women from Africa, typically Nigerian, on the streets of Norway. \n\nIt was argued that human trafficking was fuelled by a demand for sex and that therefore a ban was necessary, and whether solicitation was offensive.\nIn November 2008, the Storting passed legislation which criminalized purchasing sex (\"sexkjøploven\"). This became Section 202a of the Norwegian Penal Code.\nSection 202a\n\n\"Any person who\"\n\n\"shall be liable to fines or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both.\"\n\n\"If the sexual activity or sexual act is carried out in a particularly offensive manner and no penalty may be imposed pursuant to other provisions, the penalty shall be imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year\"\n\nThe ban extends to Norwegians outside of Norway (extra territorial law).\n\nDespite an initial drop in the visibility of street prostitution, \n\nlater reports suggested it had returned to its previous levels.\n\nThis created great difficulties for Norwegian street workers.\n\nIn 2013, prior to the elections, the Justice Ministry announced plans to evaluate the law, with applications to contract closing at the end of August, being awarded to Vista Analyse. However, researchers have criticized this because neither the budget nor the scope seem likely to provide useful answers. The evaluation was not expected to add much new to what was already known.\n\nThe report was released on 11 August 2014. It stated that the law had met its mandate, and that the street market had been reduced, and probably also the indoor market, but that this was more difficult to estimate:\n\nMain findings.<br>\n\"The ban on purchasing sexual services has reduced demand for sex and thus contribute to reduce the extent of prostitution in Norway. The enforcement of the law, in combination with the laws against trafficking and pimping, makes Norway a less attractive country for prostitution based trafficking than what would have been the case if the law had not been adopted. Furthermore, the economic conditions for prostitution in Norway are reduced following the implementation of the law. These effects are in line with the intentions of the law and are thus not considered as unintended side effects. This report does not find any evidence of more violence against prostitutes after the ban on buying sex entered into force\".\n\nCritics argued that while one could show trends in prostitution, it was simplistic to argue that they were a direct result of regulatory change, given the complex social phenomenon and the many forces acting on it. Vidar Brein-Karlsen (FrP), the Justice Secretary, has promised a thorough parliamentary inquiry (\"stortingsmelding\"). The conclusions conflict with other studies, and the definition of \"success\" has been a subject of debate. The report also states that the it has become much more difficult to be a sex worker in Norway. As with the corresponding Swedish evaluation (performed at ten years), the analysis appeared to be gender blind.\n\nThe 2008 sex purchase ban was passed by the centre-left red-green coalition government. At the time of the passage of the purchase law, it was opposed by the centre-right opposition parties in the Storting, including the Conservatives (\"Høyre\", H), the Progress Party (\"Fremskrittspartiet\", FrP), and the Liberals (\"Venstre\", V). The bill passed 44 to 28, with the Labour Party (\"Arbeiderpartiet\", A/Ap), Socialist Left (\"Sosialistisk Venstreparti\", SV), Centre (\"Senterpartiet\", Sp), and Christian Democrats (\"Kristelig Folkeparti\", KrF) voting in favour, and the Conservatives, Progress Party, and Liberals voting against. \nThe opposition parties continued to express their objections, according to Conservative MP Bent Høie and Anniken Hauglie, a fellow Conservative and Commissioner for Social Services in Oslo.\nFollowing revelations that selling sex was as prevalent as ever, and that reporters posing as clients were easily able to negotiate transactions, Conservative MP André Oktay Dahl, deputy chairman of the Standing Committee on Justice (\"Justiskomiteen\"), called for a repeal of the law, as did his fellow Progress Party member Ase Michaelsen.\n\nThe change of government in the September 2013 election which created a Conservative (48 seats) led coalition with the Progress Party (29 seats) created an opportunity for the laws to be revisited, and the Liberals (9 seats) pressed for reform. Høie has now become the Minister of Health and Care Services.\n\nAmongst those continuing to support the law are the Christian Democrats (10 seats), who wish to see the law strengthened. They and the Liberals hold the balance of power in supporting the minority Conservative coalition government. Opposition parties supporting the law include the Labour Party, which holds the greatest number of seats (55), and the Socialist Left (7 seats). Critics of the law include Sveinung Rotevatn (V) and Conservative leader Trond Helleland, as well as the Green (\"De Grønne\", MDG) (1 seat). Marthe Hammer (SV), leader of her party's women's movement, sees the law as having symbolic value, sending a message that buying sex is unacceptable. However, even the KrF agree the effects of the law should be evaluated. Support is particularly strong amongst the youth wings of the parties. The twelve member Justice Committee is currently chaired by Hadia Tajik (A), a strong supporter of the law, with Anders Bjørnsen Werp (H) and Kjell Ingolf Ropstad (KrF) as deputies. Jan Arild Ellingsen represents Progress on the committee, and is an outspoken critic, as is Ropstad. Werp and Justice Minister Anders Anundsen (FrP) saying only that they will review the evaluation. News from the Nadheim City Mission in July 2014 that the levels of prostitution in Norway had returned to those before the introduction of the law, reignited the debate, with Rotevatn stating that there was a sufficient majority in parliament to rescind the law, and that unless the evaluation produced startlingly positive results, this should now proceed.\n\nIn November 2013, the Mayor of Oslo, Stian Berger Røsland, stated that selling sex was now so prevalent in Oslo that the government should ban the sale as well as purchase of sex. By January 2014, all parties had created platforms around prostitution policy.\n\nThe law is supported by women's organizations such as the radical feminist \"Kvinnefronten\". Despite political opposition, the law has public support, 65% in January 2014, but at least one newspaper editorial has called for repeal.\n\nFollowing release of the report in August 2014, there was little evidence of any shift in political positions. While the Ap and SV celebrated, and the KrF warned the government not to change the law, the FrP stated that it changed nothing, while the H want a thorough discussion of this and other studies. The issue has now moved into the area of public and political debate; one of the arguments being whether this is merely a matter of whether morality should be legislated, or whether it is about the protection of the vulnerable. Others, especially the social services, dispute the validity of the numbers used, while \"Kvinnefronten\" welcomed the news. A critical analysis by researchers suggests that the process has not advanced knowledge, and that the result is inconclusive.\n\nPION (Prostitutes Interest Organization in Norway) provides support and advocacy for those involved in prostitution in Norway. Other organizations include Nadheim City Mission, a church-based group, and ROSA, an organization dealing with victims of human trafficking.\n\nPro Sentret is a health and social service centre for sex workers, and a national coordination centre for prostitution issues. It was set up by Oslo city, and co-funded by the government, with some private donations. It provides health care, social services, legal assistance, and counselling to sex workers of all genders. It has both a drop-in centre and outreach services. Nationally, it carries out research and education on prostitution, and provides a resource on national and international developments in prostitution. In December 2013, Oslo City Council substantially reduced funding to Pro Sentret.\n\nIn 1886, Christian Krohg wrote a novel titled \"Albertine\" (see illustration above) about a seamstress of that name living in what was then Christiana (Oslo) forced into prostitution by poverty and abuse. Although the book was confiscated, and Krogh was fined, the ensuing debate expedited the abolition of prostitution in Norway. Krohg also executed several paintings on the Albertine theme. Despite this, prostitution was a frequent theme in nineteenth century literature.\n\nA Norwegian architect has designed a brothel, as a symbolic gesture.\n\nNorway is a destination and, to a lesser extent, transit and source country for women and girls subjected to sex trafficking. Trafficking victims identified in Norway primarily originate from Eastern Europe and Africa, particularly Bulgaria, Lithuania, Nigeria, and Romania, as well as victims from Pakistan and the Philippines.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Norway as a 'Tier 1' country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25149905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25149905", "title": "Pussycat Theater", "text": "Pussycat Theater\n\nThe Pussycat Theaters were a chain of Adult movie theater, operating between the 1960s and the 1980s. Pussycat Theaters had 30 locations in California and were known for their cat-girl logo.\n\nDavid F. Friedman and Dan Sonney founded Pussycat Theaters. Dan Sonney invented the name, based on Woody Allen film \"What's New Pussycat\". Friedman has also cited the Pink Pussycat burlesque club on Santa Monica Boulevard as having previously established the word \"pussycat\" in relation to \"pink\" porn, since the early 1960s. The first Pussycat Theater opened in March 1966 on 444 South Hill Street, Los Angeles. Within two years, there were almost a dozen locations, from San Diego to San Francisco.\n\nIn 1968, Vince Miranda bought a 50% share of the company. Miranda was unable to prevent those outside California from using the Pussycat name. Miranda spent $1 million to improve the decor of the theaters. They were known for being cleaner and fancier than other such places. The interiors featured red and gold carpeting, velveteen fixtures, beveled glass, mirror walls, chandeliers, oil paintings, murals, and merchandise bearing the Pussycat logo. Some Pussycat theaters sold popcorn from the box office to pedestrians on the sidewalk, with no obligation to buy a ticket.\n\nVince Miranda and George Tate (who were lovers) shared ownership of Walnut Properties, the company that owned the Pussycat Theaters. Miranda may have had exclusive California license to show \"Deep Throat\", a hugely lucrative film. His main competitors were the Mitchell brothers.\n\nResidents who lived near the theaters complained to the city governments that children could see the images of women on posters, ads, and cardboard stand-ups. Community members wanted the theaters to close. The citizens groups and government sued Walnut Properties under a variety of laws, including obscenity, public nuisance, rezoning, eminent domain, The Red Light Abatement Act, and the US Supreme Court's \"preponderance\" redefinition of porn theaters. Walnut Properties was served with over 100 civil lawsuits filed between 1973 and 2005. Between 1977 and 1994, at the Pussycat Theater in Santa Monica, \"the Los Angeles Police Department made 2000 arrests for lewd conduct on the premises.\" In 1981, an ordinance was passed banning adult movie theaters in Santa Monica.\n\nIn 1983, pornographic videotape sales began to compete with adult theaters, reducing theater attendance. At the age of 52, Vince Miranda died of complications related to cancer in 1985. George Tate and his new paramour Jonathan Cota inherited Walnut and the Pussycat Theaters. The IRS imposed a federal tax lien of $6,047,760 on Miranda's estate. The theaters were losing money fast. Many theaters are given to debtors in lieu of money, and/or converted to general admission theaters.\n\nBy 1990, fewer than 20 California Pussycats remained, and by 1992, only a dozen were still open. In 1994, Walnut Properties filed for bankruptcy, claiming liabilities of $17.7 million. George Tate spent all the money and died the same year. Jonathan Cota inherited Walnut and its debts.\n\nBy 2003, all the theaters were lost except one at 7734 Santa Monica Boulevard. Filmmaker Roger Corman saved the last Pussycat Theater by brokering a deal with an unnamed buyer. In 2004, Cota threatened to file a lawsuit against the Pussycat Dolls, for trademark infringement on the Pussycat name. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office declared the Pussycat trademark to be \"abandoned\" and the case was dismissed. Today, Cota runs the last Pussycat Theater, which now shows homosexual pornography. The name was changed to the Tomkat, then to Studs.\n\n"}

At the time it was run by Uthingo.\n\nAfter a marketing effort that aimed to reach 80 percent of South African homes directly\nmore than 800,000 tickets were sold in the first day of availability\nNearly R70 million worth of tickets were sold in the first three weeks of operation.\n\nIn October 2002 operator Uthingo suggested a daily lottery to supplement the weekly draw. The concept, called Keno, was rejected by the trade and industry ministry in March 2003.\nIn November 2003 the Lotto Plus game was launched, acting as a supplementary weekly lottery available on the purchase of a primary lottery ticket, with an entry fee of R1.\n\nIn July 2006 the Gidani consortium, featuring Greek company Intralot as a technical partner, was judged the preferred bidder to operate the lottery for seven years starting April 2007. The operating licence was awarded in October 2006.\nIn March 2007 the Pretoria High Court set aside that award on application by incumbent Uthingo, finding that the failure to adequately investigate the shareholders in some bidding consortia left room for conflicts of interest.\n\nFollowing the final draw by incumbent Uthingo, the lottery was indefinitely suspended in April 2007.\n\nIn September the operating licence was awarded to Gidani again. \nWhen ticket sales re-opened in October more than 200,000 tickets were sold within the first three hours. Gidani introduced scratch cards, but they were discontinued for several months when they lost their licence to Ithuba.\n\nIn 2015, Lotto licences were awarded to ITHUBA. In 2015, 2 new games were introduced by Ithuba: EAZiWIN, an instant win game consisting of four types of indigenous inspired games; \"Morabaraba, Fafi Fortune, 4 Siya Wina and Popa Feela\" and PowerBall Plus.\n\n\n8 games operate under the South African National Lottery brand:\n\nPlayers buy tickets with their choice of six different numbers between 1 and 52; there is provision for random numbers to be generated automatically for those who do not wish to choose, known as 'Quick Pick'.\n\nIn the draw, six numbered balls are drawn without replacement from a set of 52 balls numbered from 1 to 52. A further \"Bonus Ball\" is also drawn, which affects only players who match five numbers.\n\nPrizes are awarded to players who match at least three of the six drawn numbers, with prizes increasing for matching more of the drawn numbers. All players who match all six drawn numbers win equal shares of the jackpot; the chance of doing so is 1 in 20,358,520. If four, five, or six balls are matched, the relevant prize is divided equally between all who match that many balls. If no player matches all six numbers, the jackpot is added to that of the next Lotto draw—a \"Rollover\".\n\nThe entry fee to the LOTTO draw is set at R5.00 per board.\n\nThe draw is conducted on Wednesdays and Saturdays on SABC 2 at 20:56.\n\nLOTTO PLUS 1 is exactly the same as LOTTO, but gives the player a second chance to win.

The top prize of the game is won by matching all five main numbers as well as the PowerBall.

An example of the recent additions were, if the player matched only the Powerball, he or she would win money, while before, that ticket would not win anything.\n\nThe record prize for any Lottery game in South Africa was in PowerBall at R102,016,595.

{"id": "47374607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47374607", "title": "The Anarchist (play)", "text": "The Anarchist (play)\n\nThe Anarchist is a two-person 2012 play by David Mamet that opened in New York on Broadway and starred Patti LuPone and Debra Winger. The \"anarchist\" of the title has its origin related to and perhaps based upon members of the Weather Underground, Judith Clark and Kathy Boudin, former members of the Weather Underground, who took part in the Brink's robbery (1981).\n\nThe play is set in the office of a prison parole review officer who is seen questioning and conducting an extended interview with a long-term prisoner incarcerated for a Weather Underground-type crime during which she killed two police officers. The outcome denies the long-term prisoner access to parole based on the harsh nature of the crime and the lack of remorse shown for her crimes.\n\nThe New York production of the play was not well-received by critics. Writing in his \"New York Times\" review of 2 December 2012, Ben Brantley wrote: \"Mr. Mamet has always been preoccupied with words both as power tools and as camouflage. That’s true whether the language is lowdown (as in 'Glengarry' and 'American Buffalo') or high-flown (as in 'Oleanna'). This has often involved a certain verbal self-consciousness among his characters. But it has never been as acute as in 'The Anarchist,' in which both women are especially aware of words as instruments of misdirection and what Cathy calls the opacity of human motives. Theatergoers must really furrow their brows here just to follow the basic arguments, never mind the layers of motivation woven into them. And without giving away too much, I think it’s fair to reveal 'Anarchist' basically concludes that all those polysyllabic words mean nothing, when you come right down to it. Right is right, and wrong is wrong. When you reach the end of 'Anarchist,' you may feel you’ve traveled an unnecessarily winding road to get there.\"\n\nHaving officially opened on Sunday 2 December 2012, producers posted closing notices the following Wednesday and cut the run short on 16 December, after only 23 previews and 17 performances.\n\nThe play opened in Madrid at the same time to positive reviews. \"La anarquista\" was directed by José Pascual with Magüi Mira as Cathy (the anarchist) and Ana Wagener as Ann (the prison officer).\n\nThe play had a 2015 production in Los Angeles, directed by Marja-Lewis Ryan with Felicity Huffman and Rebecca Pidgeon.\n\nThe play had its Ohio premiere on July 1 and 2, 2017, at the Van Fleet Theatre in Columbus. It was produced by Stage Right Theatrics, the country's only conservative theatre organization, and was chosen because of Mamet's much publicized conversion to conservatism in 2008.\n"}
{"id": "31856492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31856492", "title": "The Book of Mormon: Original Broadway Cast Recording", "text": "The Book of Mormon: Original Broadway Cast Recording\n\nThe Book of Mormon: Original Broadway Cast Recording contains the songs from the American musical \"The Book of Mormon\", with music, lyrics, and book by Trey Parker, Robert Lopez, and Matt Stone. It was recorded by the musical's original Broadway cast and released on May 17, 2011 to digital outlets. The album saw a physical release on June 7, 2011, in a deluxe package with liner notes provided by former \"The New York Times\" theatre critic Frank Rich, as well as full lyrics and a synopsis of the musical. \"The Book of Mormon\" was named best musical theater album at the 2012 Grammy Awards. \n\nParker, Lopez, and Stone wrote the musical progressively over a period of six years, beginning in 2004. The recording for the album took place over three days, with the orchestra recording for one and the cast recording for another. Stephen Oremus, Parker, Lopez, and Stone were the primary producers of the album. \"The Book of Mormon\" original cast recording was recorded at MSR Studios, Studio A in New York City. The record has received positive reviews.\n\nThe recording received substantial commercial success after its initial digital release broke iTunes Store records and the subsequent album made a relatively strong debut on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart. After the show's success at the 2011 Tony Awards and an aggressive marketing campaign, the recording skyrocketed to number 3 on the chart and became the highest charting Broadway cast album in over four decades.\n\nA vinyl version is planned.\n\nThe cast recording for \"The Book of Mormon\" was recorded on March 21, 22 and 28, 2011. The two former dates were shortly before the show officially opened and the latter was days afterward. The record was recorded at Studio A in MSR Studios (formerly Right Track Recording) in New York City. The show's creators, Trey Parker, Matt Stone, and Robert Lopez, served as producers for the album, as did \"The Book of Mormon\" producers Anne Garefino and Scott Rudin. In addition, Stephen Oremus (music director for \"Wicked\") and Kurt Deutsch (co-founder of Sh-K-Boom Records, owner of Ghostlight Records) also served as producer and executive producer, respectively.\n\nBecause of payment schedules imposed by union rules, Broadway cast recordings are traditionally recorded over a single 15-hour day, with all instruments and vocals tracked together. In addition to reducing costs, this approach enables the singers to control the tempo of the songs. But according to Frank Filipetti, who both recorded and mixed the album, \"The Book of Mormon\"'s complex vocal arrangements called for a different strategy in which the instrumental tracks were recorded first, followed by a separate day dedicated to the cast. Filipetti said that the arrangements had \"vocal parts within vocal parts within vocal parts. Trying to do all of that with the principal singers, rhythm section, orchestra, all in two or three takes in an all-day session wasn’t going to work.\" He credited Oremus and drummer Sean McDaniel for being able to anticipate the singers' phrasing. Other mixing challenges included \"creating enough air and clarity for all the vocalists while still maintaining the vibrancy of [Lopez's] orchestral arrangements\", as well as dealing with the score's wide range of musical styles. \n\nOremus and Lopez were heavily involved in the orchestra recording, whereas Stone and Parker were more invested in the vocal session. According to Filipetti, their main concern was making sure the jokes were coming across. The album was recorded to Pro Tools as to allow for multiple tracks of recordings to be present in the final cut. Mixing and mastering were done in April at Filipetti's studio in West Nyack, New York. The album was mastered by Scott Hull. Filipetti set up Source Connect to enable the core producers—Oremus, Lopez, Parker and Stone—to listen in on the session in real time from Manhattan, with Skype providing an audio/video connection between the two locations.\n\nIn the recording's liner notes, Frank Rich wrote that \"The Book of Mormon\" \"scrupulously follows the old testament of Broadway circa 1945–1965, A.D., even while fondly spoofing it\". He compares \"I Believe” to “I Have Confidence” from \"The Sound of Music\", the opening number \"Hello!\" to “The Telephone Hour” in \"Bye Bye Birdie\", and “Turn It Off” to “I’ll Never Be Jealous Again” from \"The Pajama Game\". Other songs, he writes, owe much to the parodies of Tom Lehrer.\n\nKristin Rawls, in her critique of the score, draws several parallels to other musicals. She likens \"I Believe\" to \"I Have Confidence\" from \"The Sound of Music\", citing similarities in their lyrics. She also makes a comparison between the Ugandans' version and presentation of Joseph Smith's story in \"Joseph Smith American Moses\" to \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" from \"The King and I\", as well as the recalling and overlap of previous numbers in \"Man Up\" to \"Les Misérables\"'s \"One Day More\". Other observers have made other comparisons, arguing, for example, that \"You and Me (But Mostly Me)\" references \"The Wizard and I\" from \"Wicked\", that \"All-American Prophet\" is a throw-back to \"The Music Man\"s \"Ya Got Trouble\"; and that \"Hasa Diga Eebowai\" spoofs \"Hakuna Matata\" from \"The Lion King\".\n\nAs the audio was being mixed, the musical's popularity exploded, giving the show a much higher profile than when the album was first recorded. The cast album was promoted through advertisements running during Parker and Stone's \"South Park\" on Comedy Central. A free preview of the entire recording was released on NPR starting on May 9, 2011. Excerpts from the cast recording are featured in an extended \"Fresh Air\" interview.\n\nDuring its first week of its iTunes Store release, the recording became \"the fastest-selling Broadway cast album in iTunes history\", according to representatives for the production, ranking No. 2 on its day of release on the iTunes Top 10 Chart. According to \"Playbill\", \"It's a rare occurrence for a Broadway cast album to place among the iTunes best sellers. The cast album for the Green Day musical \"American Idiot\" also ranked among the top 10 when it debuted in 2010.\" The album debuted at number 31 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart, with first-week sales of 13,000. The start for \"The Book of Mormon\" was also the best debut sales week for a cast set since \"The Little Mermaid\" cast album in 2008. The cast album also started at No. 1 on the Top Cast Albums chart – the 24th topper since the list began in 2006. After its initial success, the record fell to number 124 on the \"Billboard\" 200 with only 4,000 copies sold, and soon fell off the chart.\n\nHowever, after the show's success at the 2011 Tony Awards, \"The Book of Mormon\" cast album broke sales records again when it skyrocketed up the \"Billboard\" charts back to number 3 on the \"Billboard\" 200 on June 15, making it the highest charting Broadway cast album–and first top 10–since 1969, when \"Hair\" spent 13 straight weeks at No. 1. It sold over 61,000 copies, the largest sales week for any cast album since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking data in 1991. The previous best sales week for a cast set belonged to the original London cast recording of \"Highlights from The Phantom of the Opera\", which sold 54,000 over the Christmas week of 1992. Many news outlets attributed its chart success not only to its physical release on June 7 and publicity from the Tony Awards, but to Amazon MP3's sale pricing of the digital album. The retailer offered it at just $1.99 for three days during the sales tracking week that ended on Sunday (the night of the Tony broadcast). Amazon MP3 promoted the record aggressively through Twitter and through a commercial in the Tony Awards telecast. As a result, 85 percent of the sales were digital downloads, a much higher ratio than usual.\n\nMatthew Perpetua of \"Rolling Stone\" complimented the recording's witty lyrics and memorable songs and stated the album would leave listeners \"desperate to score tickets to see the actual show\".

{"id": "32799501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32799501", "title": "Twistaplot", "text": "Twistaplot\n\nTwistaplot is a series of children's gamebooks, that were published by Scholastic from 1982 to 1985. Books #1, #4, #9 and #14 were written by R.L. Stine, who would go on to write the \"Fear Street\" series, and the \"Goosebumps\" series, which in turn, spawned the gamebook spin-off series, \"Give Yourself Goosebumps\". The remaining books were written by various authors including Louise Munro Foley. They were Scholastic's response to the \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" series. After the success of the \"Goosebumps\" series, the books which were written by R. L. Stine were reissued with new covers in 1994 and 1995.\n\nTwistaplot covers a wide variety of genres, including science fiction, fantasy, and horror. Similar to the \"Give Yourself Goosebumps\" series, they are novels with branching plots. The books are written from the second-person perspective, in present-tense form. The protagonist in each book is never referred to by name, and the protagonist's gender is ambiguous. Thus the reader can easily imagine himself/herself as the protagonist of the storyline. But unlike the \"Give Yourself Goosebumps\" series, the books have interior illustrations.\n\nAfter the success of Twistaplot, the series spawned a series of computer games for Scholastic's electronic magazine, \"Microzine\". It also spawned another gamebook spin-off titled \"Pick-a-Path\", which was intended for a younger audience.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Poliakov was born in Jerusalem, and grew up in Tel Aviv. He became one of the three members of the Israeli comedy group, HaGashash HaHiver (The Pale Tracker).\n\nPoliakov originally chose a career as a farmer and studied at the Kfar HaYarok agricultural high school. This changed when he was spotted at a school party by members of Nahal Brigade's entertainment troupe, and he was soon recruited by the group. In 1961, he joined the original singing band Hatarnegolim (The Roosters) that had been founded by Naomi Polani, the original cast of which broke up in 1964.\n\nPoliakov appeared in a number of famous Israeli films, often with members of HaGashash HaHiver. His film credits include \"Schlager\" (The Hit) in 1979; \"Krav al Hava'ad\" (The House Committee) in 1986; and \"Givat Halfon Eina Ona\" (Halfon Hill Doesn't Answer) in 1975. He appeared in a number of Israeli television roles, and produced and acted in his daughter's television show, \"It's All Honey\".\n\nPoliakov began working on stage as a theater actor in 2000. His credits include \"The Israeli Family\", \"The Rubber Merchants\", \"God's Finger\", \"Mother Courage\" and \"The Return of Moris Shpigelman\".\n\nAbraham \"Pashanel\" Deshe, a producer and agent who died of cancer in 2004 at age 78, started HaGashash HaHiver in late 1963. The group was composed of three members – Poliakov, Yeshayahu \"Shaike\" Levy and Gavriel \"Gavri\" Banai. They created a \"unique Israeli comedy group,\" according to the Jerusalem Post. Their jokes, which included the best and worst of Israeli society, often achieved a cult status among fans.\n\nIn 2000, the group and its three members were awarded the Israel Prize for lifetime achievement & special contribution to society for their work. The judges wrote of their award decision:\nThe uniqueness of HaGashash HaHiver is in its two faces: On the one hand, it reflects the life and the culture that were created in Israel during its first 50 years and in the course of wars, immigration absorption and the struggle for its existence. On the other hand, it has taken an active role in shaping this culture, creating its language and sketching its identity... Their language, Gashashit, and the images they created broke the walls of the inflexible Hebrew language and became standard idiomatic phrases, so much so that he who doesn't know them doesn't know a large part of the culture that has sprouted here. Phrases such as, 'Drive in peace, the keys are inside,' 'There was an engine?' [referring to a mechanic who cheats a client], 'Israbluff' and many others that became part of our everyday language. \n\nYisrael Poliakov died of cancer at the Rabin Medical Center-Beilinson Campus in Petah Tikva on October 30, 2007, at the age of 66, following a two-week hospitalization for heart problems. Poliakov's coffin was taken to Cameri Theater in Tel Aviv for a public memorial service, and was buried in a cemetery in Kibbutz Einat.\n\nFellow HaGashash HaHiver member Yeshayahu Levy told Israel Army Radio: \"...lost a brother. There is no other word. We've been together since 1958, and he was part of me. He was a great talent, an outstanding comic actor, and a wonderful friend... The pain is great.\"\n\nActor Moshe Ivgi, who costarred with Poliakov in \"The Rubber Merchant\", told the Jerusalem Post: \"He was a great actor who was blessed with comic and dramatic qualities, and it was a pleasure to work with him. Poli was a modest and ego-free man, full of love, and I am sure he would have done so much more.\"\n\nPresident Shimon Peres stated \"Generations upon generations watched him and fell captive to his charm\".\n\n"}
