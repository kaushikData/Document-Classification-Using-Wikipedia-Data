{"id": "11436091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11436091", "title": "Babies switched at birth", "text": "Babies switched at birth\n\nBabies switched at birth are babies who, because of either error or malice, are interchanged with each other at birth or very soon thereafter, leading to the babies being unknowingly raised by parents who are not their biological parents. The occurrence is not unknown but rarely discovered in real life, but is much more common as a plot device in novels and films, such as the TV series \"Switched at Birth\" and \"Autumn in My Heart\".\n\nThe plot device of babies who are switched at birth, or in their cradles, has been a common one in American fiction since the 18th century. It is one of the several identifiable characteristics of melodrama that are plot devices dealing with situations that are highly improbable in real life.\n\nThe use of this common theme has continued ever since. The device was used a number of times by W. S. Gilbert, including in the Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" and \"The Gondoliers\". In both cases, well-born babies were switched with commoners. Mark Twain later used this plot device in \"The Tragedy of Pudd'nhead Wilson\" (1893), where two babies, one white and one black, are switched at birth, resulting in both passing for races that they are not. It is one of the themes that television films regularly exploited in the 1970s and 1980s. It continues to be a popular theme in the 1990s and 21st century with (for examples) it being employed as a plot device in \"Veronica Mars\" (the characters Cindy \"Mac\" Mackenzie and Madison Sinclair), in \"Neighbours\" (the characters Bree Timmins and Anne Baxter), \"Night and Day\" (the characters Jane Harper and Della Wells) and in \"The Young and the Restless\" (children of Lauren Fenmore Baldwin and Sheila Carter). A non-human example occurs in the \"Planet of the Apes\" franchise, when the son of intelligent apes Zira and Cornelius is swapped with a 20th-century circus ape's infant, in order to assure the survival of the offspring that can become sentient. In \"Desperate Housewives\" the characters Juanita Solis and Grace Sanchez were switched at birth by a nurse named Teresa Pruitt. In the Philippine television series, \"Mara Clara\", the characters Mara Davis/David and Clara del Valle were switched at birth by Gary for revenge after his former lover was married to another man. On the ABC Family series \"Switched at Birth\", the characters Bay and Daphne were switched at birth.\n\nBaby switching storylines are a staple of daytime drama, as in the case of \"The Young and the Restless\" mentioned above. Other notable switched-at-birth storylines on American soaps include \"One Life to Live\"s story, begun in 1979, in which prostitute Katrina Karr, who had planned to put her child up for adoption as soon as it was born, and former nun Jenny Vernon both gave birth to girls at the same hospital, at the same time. Jenny's baby died in the maternity ward as Karen Wolek and Marco Dane (posing as a doctor) visited the child. As they knew Katrina had planned to give up her baby girl, Karen and Marco switched the newborns. It was not until 1982 that the truth came out and Jenny tearfully gave baby Mary back to Katrina.\n\nIn 2008, another \"One Life to Live\" storyline saw Starr Manning pregnant with Cole Thornhart's baby. Her cousin Jessica Brennan was also pregnant with her late husband's baby. Starr went into labor as her father Todd Manning (later revealed to be his twin brother Victor) planned to kidnap his grandchild and raise the baby secretly with Cole's amnesiac mother Marty Saybrooke. Tess, one of Jessica's alter personalities, had taken control of Jessica's life and went into premature labor. Starr, with the help of the baby's adoptive mother Marcie McBain and Starr's mother Blair Manning, gave birth to a healthy girl, whom she named Hope. Tess's child, named Chloe, was stillborn. The trauma of Chloe's death resulted in the emergence of another alter, Bess, who took Jessica's deceased baby to the hospital and switched her with Starr's healthy child. Seven months later, Jessica realized what had happened and told the truth to her cousin.\n\nPossibly the most complex storyline involving the switched-at-birth plot device ran simultaneously on \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\". Involved were \"All My Children\"s Bianca Montgomery and Babe Chandler, and \"One Life to Live\"s Kelly Cramer Buchanan, as well as many other characters.\n\nIn George R. R. Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series, the baby Aegon Targaryen was switched with a commoner's baby at some point prior to the Sack of King's Landing in order to save him from being killed during the rebellion against the Targaryen dynasty. After the commoner's baby is killed, everyone believes that Aegon is dead when in fact he is preparing to take back his grandfather's throne.\n\nIn the 1971 manga/anime \"Wandering Sun / Nozomi in the Sun\" (\"Sasurai no Taiyou\"), Miki and Nozomi are two girls who were switched at birth by the nurse Michiko Nohara, who holds a personal grudge against one of the families involved. Miki should've been raised as the daughter of the poor but loving Mine family but instead is taken in by the rich and snobbish Kouda clan, and Nozomi the opposite. The deceit isn't properly revealed until almost the end of the series.\n\nIn the \"Umineko no naku koro ni\" visual novels, Rudolf Ushiromiya's wife Asumu and mistress/later second wife Kyrie were pregnant and gave birth at roughly the same time. Rudolf had the children switched when Asumu's child was stillborn so the affair wouldn't be uncovered, and after Asumu's death from an illness, he married Kyrie. The surviving child grows into the protagonist of the games, Battler Ushiromiya, who believes himself to be Asumu and Rudolf's son until later in the story.\n\nIn the game \"Tales of the Abyss\", Princess Natalia Luzu Kimlasca-Lanvaldear died few after birth so her nanny Maggie switched her with her also newborn granddaughter, Meryl Oakland. This causes Meryl's mother Sylvia (Maggie's own daughter) to commit suicide out of grief, and her father Badaq soon became the enemy general Largo the Black Lion. Meryl, now Natalia, is raised as the Princess and doesn't find out the truth until she's a teenager.\n\nIn real life, such a switch occurs rarely. Since many cases of babies switched at birth are likely undocumented or unknown, the following is presumably not an exhaustive list.\n\n\nSome hospitals take fingerprints, foot prints, or palm prints of newborns to prevent babies from being mixed up. Nurses also double check with the mother, checking the identity of that person as well, in order to prevent errors. Many hospitals also have policies in which a medical record number is assigned to an infant at birth, and bands with this number as well as the last name of the mother of the infant, the sex of the infant, and the date and time of birth are placed on the infant and the mother immediately after parturition before the mother and child are separated. A band may also be placed on the father (or other person chosen by the mother) at the time of birth.\n\n"}

{"id": "1591228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1591228", "title": "Character generator", "text": "Character generator\n\nA character generator, often abbreviated as CG, is a device or software that produces static or animated text (such as news crawls and credits rolls) for keying into a video stream. Modern character generators are computer-based, and can generate graphics as well as text.\n\nMonoscopes were used as character generators for text mode video rendering in computer displays for a short time in the 1960s. The CBS Laboratories Vidiac, and the A. B. Dick 990 System, were among the earliest character generators for broadcast television. CBS Laboratories later developed the more advanced Vidifont system in preparation for the 1968 US presidential elections, where a rapid method of all-electronic character generation was required so that news outlets could identify unexpected interviewees on the spot. A similar generator using analogue electronics, Anchor, was developed by the BBC in 1970 and used in the general election later that year.\n\nIn the television business in North America, the digital on-screen graphics generated by character generators are also often called \"Chyrons\", after the Chyron Corporation, whether or not Chyron made the character generator. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, such graphics are often called \"Astons\", after Aston Broadcast Systems. These are examples of genericized trademarks.\n\nCharacter generators are primarily used in the broadcast areas of live television sports or television news presentations, given that the modern character generator can rapidly (i.e., \"on the fly\") generate high-resolution, animated graphics for use when an unforeseen situation in a broadcast dictates an opportunity for breaking news coverage—for example, when, in a football game, a previously unknown player begins to have what looks to become an outstanding day, the character generator operator can rapidly build a new graphic using the template \"shell\" of a similarly-designed graphic. The character generator is one of many technologies used to meet the demands of live television, where events on the field or in the newsroom dictate the direction of the coverage. As character generator development has progressed, the distinction between hardware and software generators has become less distinct as new platforms and operating systems evolve to meet the live television consumer's expectations.\n\nBefore character generators were available, the primary method of adding titles to video images was to dedicate one camera to shooting white letters on a black background, which then was combined with the video from a live-action camera to form what appeared to be a single image with white letters seemingly superimposed over it. In fact, to this day (and despite the fact that this technology is long-since antiquated by the modern CG) some directors of live TV continue to order the technical director (TD) to \"add the super\" when they want the CG output \"superimposed\" over the image of another camera. As technology advanced, the ability to \"key\" (compositing) these white letters over live video became available, involving electronically \"cutting a hole\" (analogous to cutting a keyhole) in the shape of the letters from the title camera and then electronically adding the letters to the holes cut into the live action camera image. Again, some directors still call this \"keying the graphic\". Finally, the modern CG allowed not only more precise and realistic \"keying\", but also the addition of multiple picture elements from the CG to further the illusion of a 3-dimensional graphic physically overlying a video image. The addition of full-motion graphics from the CG and the animation of graphic elements by the CG blur the line between \"character generator\" and \"computer graphics\", combining the CG's ability to elegantly present graphics and video with the computer's ability to interface with game scoring and timing systems, to keep running totals of an athlete's performance on the field or the court and to derive statistics both for individual players and the teams involved, and to interface with computer systems located at other game venues or at a television network's master control central broadcast center. On televised sporting events, score bugs are present. They contain CG data from that game, CG data from other games in progress, other games already completed, and games yet to come, all in an effort to keep the viewer from having to \"channel surf\" to another station to watch another television program. Viewers who do not change channels watch the first channel's television advertising (also included in CG output) which then generates revenue for the television network.\n\nAlthough the distinction between hardware and software CGs is becoming less evident as technology advances, and as consumer-grade computing equipment becomes more graphically sophisticated, it remains easiest to view CG's as either hardware- or software-dependent.\n\nHardware character generators are used in television studios and video editing suites. A desktop publishing-like interface can be used to generate static and moving text or graphics, which the device then encodes into some high-quality video signal, like digital Serial Digital Interface (SDI) or analog component video, high definition or even RGB video. They also provide a key signal, which the compositing vision mixer can use as an alpha channel to determine which areas of the CG video are translucent.\n\nSoftware CGs run on standard off-the-shelf computer hardware and are often integrated into video editing software such as non-linear editing system (NLE). Some stand-alone character generator products are available, however, for applications that do not even attempt to offer text generation on their own, as high-end video editing software often does, or whose internal CG effects are not flexible and powerful enough. Some software CGs can be used in live production with special software and computer video interface cards. In that case, they are equivalent to hardware generators.\n\n"}

{"id": "1061223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1061223", "title": "Closet drama", "text": "Closet drama\n\nA closet drama is a play that is not intended to be performed onstage, but read by a solitary reader or sometimes out loud in a small group. The contrast between closet drama and classic ‘stage’ dramas dates back to the late eighteenth century. Although non-performative in nature, closet drama is \"a quite legitimate product of literary art.\" \nA closet drama (or closet play) is a play created primarily for reading, rather than production. Closet dramas are traditionally defined in narrower terms as belonging to a genre of dramatic writing unconcerned with stage technique. Stageability is only one aspect of closet drama: historically, playwrights might choose the genre of 'closet' dramatic writing to avoid censorship of their works, for example in the case of political tragedies. Closet drama has also been used as a mode of dramatic writing for those without access to the commercial playhouse, and in this context has become closely associated with early modern women's writing.[4] Closet dramas were published in manuscript form, including \"dramatis personae\" and elaborate stage directions, allowing readers to imagine the text as if it was being performed.[5] This created an \"unusually tight fusion between book and reader as it endeavours to stimulate the theatrical imagination.\" The playwrights did not have to worry about the pressure to impress an audience due to their audience being who they chose. Thus, it was considered to be a freeing style of writing.]\n\nMarta Straznicky describes the form as \"part of a larger cultural matrix in which closed spaces, selective interpretive communities, and political dissent are aligned.\" Print is the crucial factor behind closet dramas: \"a play that is not intended for commercial performance can nevertheless cross between private playreading and the public sphere\" through this medium.\n\nIn the early modern period, women writers who were unable to ‘use their voice’ in public were able to emphasize their opinions using the form of closet drama. This outlet for communication provided women with the ability to \"engage in political discourse without exposing her views to an indiscriminate public,\" since they could choose to restrict their readership. However, women's writing could be influenced by societal pressures and occurrences.\n\nMargaret Lucas Cavendish, author of fourteen folio volumes, explored writing closet dramas during her exile and became one of the most well known women playwrights due to her interest in philosophical nature. ] Although living in relative oppression, women dealt with the risks of public shame and rejection in the effort to have their writing recognized.\n\nOther notable women involved in closet drama include Anne Finch, Jane Lumley, and Elizabeth Cary.\n\nThe philosophical dialogues of ancient Greek and Roman writers such as Plato (see Socratic dialogue) were written in the form of conversations between \"characters\" and are in this respect similar to closet drama, many of which feature little action but are often rich in philosophical rhetoric.\n\nBeginning with Friedrich von Schlegel, many have argued that the tragedies of Seneca the Younger in the first century AD were written to be recited at small parties rather than performed. Although that theory has become widely pervasive in the history of theater, there is no evidence to support the contention that his plays were intended to be read or recited at small gatherings of the wealthy. The emperor Nero, a pupil of Seneca, may have performed in some of them. Some of the drama of the Middle Ages was of the closet-drama type, such as the drama of Hroswitha of Gandersheim and debate poems in quasi-dramatic form.\n\nFulke Greville, Samuel Daniel, Sir William Alexander, and Mary Sidney wrote closet dramas in the age of Shakespeare and Jonson.\n\nBetween 1642 and 1660, the English government banned public performance. During this time, playreading became a \"substitute\" for playgoing. Thus, playwrights were moved to take on \"propagandist aims\" against parliament and topics beyond the theatre in their writing, meaning reading such work could be considered a revolutionary act. However, playwrights could write in relative security, protected by the anonymous means of print. Thomas Killigrew is an example of a stage playwright who turned to closet drama when his plays could no longer be produced during this period; he was in exile from England during the English Civil War.\n\nFollowing the Restoration in 1660, some authors continued to favour closet drama, proving that the form \"served a cultural function distinct from that of commercial drama.\" John Milton's play \"Samson Agonistes\", written in 1671, is an example of early modern drama never intended for the stage.\n\nSeveral closet dramas in verse were written in Europe after 1800; these plays were by and large inspired by classical models. \"Faust, Part 1\" and \"Faust, Part 2\" by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, among the most acclaimed pieces in the history of German literature, were written as closet dramas, though both plays have been frequently staged. Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Alexander Pushkin devoted much time to the closet drama.\n\nThe popularity of closet drama at this time was both a sign of, and a reaction to, the decline of the verse tragedy on the European stage in the 1800s. Popular tastes in theater were shifting toward melodrama and comedy and there was little commercial appeal in staging verse tragedies (though Coleridge, Robert Browning, and others wrote verse dramas that were staged in commercial theaters). Playwrights who wanted to write verse tragedy had to resign themselves to writing for readers, rather than actors and audiences. Nineteenth-century closet drama became a longer poetic form, without the connection to practical theater and performance.\n\n"}

Since its inception, more than a billion Colorforms play sets have been produced and sold.\n\nColorforms are sheet-thin, die-cut vinyl pieces, in colorful geometric \"forms\" and abstract shapes (figural or object), often with over-printed images that are to be attached to a smooth plastic laminated paperboard background, much like placing paper dolls against a paper backdrop. The pieces stick to the background without chemical or static adhesion, and in a secure, but non-permanent manner when a vacuum is created between the two polished surfaces, holding the piece in place. The Colorforms vinyl pieces can then be repositioned on the board a virtually unlimited number of times to create new designs and scenarios. The sets aide in promoting creative expression, concentration skills, comprehension of spatial relationships, and manual dexterity in young children.\n\nThe Colorforms concept was developed by Harry and Patricia Kislevitz in 1951, firmly rooted in the Modernist design ethos and reflecting the Color Field abstract style prevalent at the time.\n\nThe basic concept behind Colorforms is the ability to adhere and reposition abstract and geometric color form shapes on random surfaces to create art. Both recent art students, the couple discovered the idea when they acquired several rolls of flexible paper-thin colored vinyl used to manufacture plastic pocketbooks, and found that it would stick to the glossy paint in their bathroom and allow them to reposition it at will without affecting either surface. Simply cutting shapes out of the material and sticking them to the wall turned out to be amusing enough that they left extra vinyl with a pair of scissors for guests to add to their creation. The positive reactions they got to the project led Harry to believe there was market potential for a product.\n\nThe original Colorforms sets were spiral-bound booklets hand-assembled by the husband and wife team in their New York city apartment. The first 1,000 sets were sold 'on concept' to the FAO Schwarz toy store. Shallow boxed sets containing screen-printed, die-cut pieces, and illustrated backgrounds began appearing soon after. The company used the slogan \"It's More Fun To Play The Colorforms Way!\" in print ads and television commercials to promote their products. Prominent graphic designer Paul Rand was commissioned to create the company logo that remains in use today; he also gave input for a 'signature' edition play set.\n\nThe company rarely employed an in-house creative staff, relying instead on the Kislevitz' own artistic direction provided to top freelance illustrators for layouts and finished work. Indeed, even the company's creative director from 1965 until 1986, toy designer and inventor Mel Birnkrant, was not a formal Colorforms employee, working instead for a royalty percentage.\n\nThe defining feature of most Colorforms play sets is their signature plastic ‘Stick-Ons™’ that can be placed and repositioned on top of graphic backgrounds to create endless scenes and scenarios at a child's whim.\n\n\nOriginal character sets focused on household themes such as Miss Weather, a girl whose wardrobe changed with the weather, and Miss Cookie's Kitchen, a woman with a variety of kitchen tools and utensils. Later sets relied on the use of licensed cartoon characters such as Mickey Mouse, and Gumby. Colorforms products have expanded beyond the simple \"paper doll\" concept to more than 75 Colorforms toy products currently in distribution, with more added every year.\n\nThe first Colorforms product to utilize a licensed character property featured Popeye, the King Features Syndicate cartoon character, released as a boxed set in 1957. Since then, licensed products have remained critically important to the Colorforms marketing strategy, with hundreds of brands connected to Colorforms. Later Colorforms licensed various properties, producing sets supporting varied cartoons, TV series, movie releases, and popular musical artists, like The Beatles, \"Peanuts\", \"Gumby*\", \"Tarzan\", \"The Three Stooges\", \"Doctor Do little\", \"\", Batman and Superman (along with a whole pantheon of comic book super heroes), and \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\", Michael Jackson, \"The Smurfs\", and even \"Steve Urkel\".\n\nIn a licensing twist, Colorforms developed their own character property, Sugar & Spice to compete with Strawberry Shortcake (1979) when master license holder, Kenner Products would not allow wide usage of character rights throughout the toy industry. Colorforms turned around and sold their character concept to other companies that got shut out of the 'Shortcake' craze. Another property that Colorforms was never able to translate into their own form was the lucrative \"Star Wars\" franchise, again because Kenner held the toy products master license very tightly.\n\nIn 1968, saw an interesting diversion from the typical 2-dimensional toy lines that Colorforms specialized in, when they released The Outer Space Men (a.k.a. Colorform Aliens) bendy action figures. This group of aliens, hailing from other planets in our Solar System were designed to tie into the popularity of Mattel's Major Matt Mason astronaut line (1966); Colorforms nicely complimented the larger manufacturer's line due to Mattel's dearth of alien adversaries. Colorforms also offered a respectable 'knockoff' of the Silly Putty concept—the pliable rubbery clay-like substance that picked up newspaper-ink images when pressed upon them, with \"Moon Putty\" and \"Monster Print Putty.\" The former packaged in a hard plastic moon container, and the latter, packed in a little plastic human skull for heightened \"monster\" effect.\n\nThe Colorforms company was the major licensee of the Plasticine brand of modeling clay in the United States from 1979 until at least 1984; Plasticine is a non-drying putty-like modeling material made from a proprietary mix chalk and vasoline. This provided Colorforms with a viable competing product against Hasbro's Play-Doh.\n\nColorforms acquired the rights to license and distribute Shrinky Dinks in 1981, and continued creating and promoting their products until the brand was sold to Milton Bradley in 1988.\n\nThe company has also, at times, carried a wide range of children's board games, and both child-targeted, and high-end jigsaw puzzles.\n\nIn 1997, Colorforms was acquired by Toy Biz. A year later, Colorforms was sold off to University Games Corporation. In September 2014, it became a new division of Out of the Blue Enterprises, as Colorforms Brand, LLC. In January 2018, Toronto-based 9 Story Media Group acquired Out of the Blue also inheriting Colorforms\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1335689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1335689", "title": "Conga line", "text": "Conga line\n\nThe conga line is a novelty line dance that was derived from the Cuban carnival dance of the same name and became popular in the US in the 1930s and 1950s. The dancers form a long, processing line, which would usually turn into a circle. It has three shuffle steps on the beat, followed by a kick that is slightly ahead of the fourth beat. The conga, a term sometimes mistakenly believed to be derived from the African region of Congo, is both a lyrical and danceable genre, rooted in the music of carnival troupes or comparsas.\n\nThe conga dance was believed to have been brought over from Africa by slaves in the West Indies,\nand became a popular street dance in Cuba. The style was appropriated by politicians during the early years of republic\nin an attempt to appeal to the masses before election. During the Machado dictatorship in Cuba, Havana citizens were forbidden to dance the conga, because rival groups would work themselves to high excitement and explode into street fighting. When Fulgencio Batista became president in the 1940s, he permitted people to dance congas during elections, but a police permit was required.\n\nThe conga dance style is more of a march, which is characterized by its distinctive conga drum rhythm. It differs from the Cuban rumba, which uses more hip movements and shows the sensually aggressive attitude of each dancer. Conga music is played with a staccato beat as its base, which gives rhythm to the movements of the dancers. Conga dancers lift their legs in time with the rhythm of the music, marking each beat with the strong motion of their body.\n\nThe basic dance steps start from left leg 1-2-3 kick then repeat, opposite. Originally, a band member wearing a drum would venture onto the dance floor and begin zig-zagging around while drumming out the rhythm. Dancers would start joining up behind the drummer, forming a line that moved like a slithering snake in an open circle. The line (or the circular chain) would grow longer and the drumming more intense until it finally stopped. The dance has two styles, which is a single line form and partners. The single line is more popular in Cuba.\n\nBeginning in the late 1930s and booming in the 1940s, it became wildly popular in the US, due in no small measure to Hollywood's \"Latin\" musicals. RKO Pictures' offerings were particularly influential, notably \"Too Many Girls\" (1940), in which Desi Arnaz appeared as a conga-playing Argentine student. Spanish-Catalan bandleader Xavier Cugat, who gave Arnaz his musical start, helped to popularize the dance, but the biggest impact belonged to Arnaz himself. It is prominently featured in the 1941 Deanna Durbin film, It Started With Eve, in which Durbin and Charles Laughton dance it together in a nightclub.\n\nWith its simple march step, the interlinking of dancers circling about in single file, and one-two-three-bump rhythm with the fourth beat strongly marked, the dance was not only attractive but also readily accessible to US and other foreign audiences. The dance started to gain a foothold in the US around 1929, when the original La Conga nightclub opened its doors in Manhattan. It is believed that the La Conga was at Broadway and 51st Street. By 1937, the conga was well known in New York.\n\nThe widespread popularity of the dance resulted in many cultural references in contemporary media. For example, the conga line was a recurring theme in Warner Bros. animated cartoons of the 1940s.\n\nThis music and dance form has become totally assimilated into Cuba's musical heritage and has been used in many film soundtracks in the US and Mexico. One of the earliest and most successful of 20th-century Cuban musical exports, the conga lacked the polyrhythmic sophistication of the son, mambo, or salsa but served to nurture the future receptivity of an international public to the wider gamut of Cuban musical styles.\n\nThe video game Team Fortress 2 has adopted the conga as an in game \"taunt\", and has become a notable feature in the game, often being parodied in fan-made content such as animations or add-ons to the game.\n\nThe conga has been featured in countless films and TV series', though in most cases it was intended to serve as a distraction for the main characters to slip away silently.\n\nIn 1984 the British band Black Lace reached number 10 in the UK charts with the song \"Do the Conga\".\n\nThe long-time jingle for Dad's Old-Fashioned Root Beer employed a conga beat.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1395666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1395666", "title": "Forced", "text": "Forced\n\nForced is a single-player and co-op action role-playing game developed by BetaDwarf, released in October 2013 for Windows, OS X and Linux through the Steam platform as well as Wii U. It is about gladiators fighting for their freedom in a fantasy arena and are assisted by a spirit-like character called Balfus. Gameplay consists of selecting a weapon class and abilities to combat the various enemies of each arena, while solving puzzles using the help of Balfus. BetaDwarf was formed by a small group of students in 2011, who began developing the game in an unused classroom in Aalborg University – Copenhagen, Denmark. They were removed months later and launched a successful Kickstarter campaign involving an Imgur picture which documented their progress. \"Forced\" received moderate to favorable reviews with most critics praising its competitive gameplay and puzzle-system. The game's weak plot, technical glitches and excess difficulty were the negative highlights. It won the Level Up 2013 Intel award and BetaDwarf received the Danish Developer Of The Year (2013) for it.\n\n\"Forced\" is an action role-playing game having a top-down view for up to four players in the combat arena. Players have to select a weapon, which have 16 unlockable abilities each, similar to a character class. Though single player mode is also available, the game is mostly about cooperative gameplay by selecting a weapon class and abilities which complement the other players', while combating demons of various sizes and solving environmental puzzles—using a will-o-wisp-like companion called Balfus the Spirit Mentor.\n\nThere are four weapon classes: the Storm Bow, the Volcanic Hammer, the Spirit Knives, and the Frost Shield; each have the tactical roles of a long range attacker, slow melee attacker, fast melee attacker and a tank respectively. The active and passive abilities available for each class allow some form of customization. The weapon class and selected abilities (which also have cooldowns) can be changed before the start of any arena level. Each player must choose a different weapon class. Balfus can be made to interact with the environment's spiritual plane by ordering him to activate or trigger props like healing pedestals or set off a stunning blast from traps. He can travel with the characters, float in space or can be called to their location. Good positioning and communication will help the players use Balfus efficiently; the need to do this while facing waves of enemies, makes the game more challenging.\n\nGems are rewarded after completion of each arena trial. They can be used to enhance the weapons by unlocking more ability slots and new abilities at regular intervals. Each trial contains three gems as a reward. The first requires completion, the second is a specific challenge and the third is a time trial. If the arena boss is too difficult, it is possible to complete all these challenges to earn extra gems. \"Forced\" has a Mark Combat System, where weapons cause marks on the enemies. Greater number of marks cause certain abilities to have better effects, thus making it more effective to hit a group of enemies a few times before using an ability, rather than using it at the start. Though the difficulty increases in proportion to the number of players and sharing Balfus needs communication between them, multiplayer is easier and lets the player focus on specific abilities and tactical roles instead of being forced to cover every possibility in single player; also, if a player dies, the trial can be completed as long as another survives till the end.\n\nThe players are cast as slaves who are forced to fight in a fantasy gladiator arena, which is reason for the game title. The slaves are from a village where people are bred solely to be gladiators and fight for the pleasure of demon types to win their freedom. The players have the help of Balfus, a Spirit Mentor, and need to overcome the challenges and defeat the guardians of each arena. Spirit Mentors guide gladiators through the arena and Balfus is revealed to have done so for previous dead gladiators before the player. Balfus remains the source of drama since the protagonists are silent throughout the game and the antagonists do not go beyond taunting them.\n\nIn their first arena fight, they defeat the guardian called \"Wrathhoof\", who refuses to accept defeat to let them pass to the next arena. Despite Balfus' warning that this would be against the rules, Wrathhoof continues to attack the players who then kill him. The players and Balfus try to keep this murder of a guardian a secret and embark to the next arena, where the next guardian Slarth, discovers what they did. Slarth and the next guardian Graw are revealed to be former gladiators themselves and Balfus, their mentor. The players then defeat and kill Slarth. On killing Graw, Balfus decides to end this gladiator event by killing the remaining guardian Mordar and the final guardian called \"The Master\".\n\n\"Forced\" uses the Unity engine. BetaDwarf was formed by a small group of students in 2010, who moved into an unused classroom in Aalborg University – Copenhagen, Denmark and began developing the game. After seven months, the university discovered them when a lecturer accidentally walked into the room. They were removed and made a successful Kickstarter campaign involving a picture on Imgur, which described their progress as a team; they were then able to set up their office in Copenhagen. Steffen Kabbelgaard, Game Director and CEO of BetaDwarf, credited the 1996 videogame \"Crash Bandicoot\" as an inspiration for the campaigns and gem rewards in \"Forced\". A demo of the game was available in the 2013 Gamescom and PAX Prime. A beta version of \"Forced\" was initially released on Steam Early Access for Windows, OS X and Linux in the same year. Its full release was on October 24, 2013 which was also for Wii U. On March 19, 2014, BetaDwarf announced that the game would be available on Xbox One.\n\n\"Forced\" won the Level Up 2013 Intel award and BetaDwarf received the Danish Developer Of The Year at the 2013 Spilprisen game awards held by the Danish Producers Association. It received moderate to favorable reviews. Brittany Vincent of Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 4/5, calling it \"a gleeful return to form for cooperative play.\" Jim Rossignol from Rock, Paper, Shotgun called it a \"competently produced game\" but said that it \"simply lacks flair, and combined with the slightly awkward mechanics in co-op play, means it never feels wholly convincing.\" Lena LeRay from IndieGames.com felt the voice acting was mediocre and acknowledged the lack of depth in the plot but said that the \"engaging gameplay\" compensated it. Bob Richardson from RPGFan also highlighted these issues in addition to various technical glitches in multiplayer. Richardson praised the gameplay, the puzzle system and the skill customization, giving the game 80% rating. He said, \"\"Forced\" is purely an intrinsic experience: defeat is the result of lack of cooperation and skill, and victory is directly related to teamwork, communication, and aptitude.\"\n\nZach Welhouse from RPGamer gave it a 3/5 calling the combat \"complex and rewarding\" and multiplayer \"a good balance of tactics and adrenaline.\" He also praised the music, Balfus's character and called the puzzle-solving system \"unique\" but noted the bare plot and game difficulty as its negative highlights. Welhouse commented, \"The sheer number of ways to die makes it difficult to tell how much of \"Forced\" is unfair and how much is a series of lessons in avoiding dangerous situations to unlock a new ability is a compelling system for squeezing the most effort out of a player.\" Jason Venter from GameSpot, gave it 5/10 and said, \"It's a challenging game with built-in reasons to revisit familiar areas, but it's also too demanding for its own good, and the results are more frustrating than satisfying.\" Mike Gunn from NZGamer.com gave it 8.6/10 and said, \"Such a simple game, but one with a lot of tactical and strategic depth.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1455177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1455177", "title": "Four-color deck", "text": "Four-color deck\n\nA four-color deck is identical to the standard French deck except for the color of the suits. In a typical English four-color deck, hearts are red and spades are black as usual, but clubs are green and diamonds are blue. However, other color combinations have been used over the centuries, in other areas or for certain games.\n\nFour-color decks made for trick-taking games such as bridge, whist, or jass are often called no-revoke decks because they are perceived to reduce the risk of a player accidentally revoking (illegally playing a card of a suit other than that led). Dozens of card manufacturers have developed four-colored suit cards for bridge during the 1900s and continue into this century. \n\nThe earliest such deck in the US is by J. Y. Humphreys who created the \"Seminole Wars Deck\" in 1819, which had four colored suits of blue spades, green clubs, red hearts and yellow diamonds.\n\nIn the German game of skat the official tournament standard since the 1990s is to use a no-revoke deck known as a \"Turnierbild\" deck. In these decks, spades are green and diamonds are yellow, the clubs and hearts being respectively black and red as normal, which also reflects the suit order: clubs, spades, hearts, diamonds. This is intended as a compromise for players (typically from former East Germany) who prefer German suits over French; the green spades translate to \"leaves\" and the yellow diamonds to \"bells\" in the German suits.\n\nIn 1922, August Petrtyl & Son produced a tarock deck with black clubs, yellow diamonds, pink hearts, and green spades in the United States. They were sold in two versions, a full 78-card deck and a 54-card deck. The smaller deck is structured the same as \"Industrie und Glück\" decks as it was designed to play a variant of Königrufen.\n\nA four-color deck for poker using the black spades, red hearts, green clubs, and blue diamonds was developed and publicized by Mike Caro. It was introduced at his World Poker Finals at Foxwoods Resort Casino in 1992. His original design was not a success as the colors were a surprise to players. The World Poker Tour uses the same colors as Caro's deck to display the players' cards for increased visibility on small television screens.\n\nFour-color decks have become a somewhat popular option in online poker software interfaces since often each player may use their preferred design of playing cards without affecting others' experience, and since visibility is not as good on a small screen as in face-to-face play, especially as many online players play multiple tables simultaneously, with shorter time limits in which to make decisions. Having each suit represented by a different color can allow players to more easily recognize a flush.\n"}
{"id": "996343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=996343", "title": "Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)", "text": "Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)\n\nJosie and the Pussycats (formatted as Josie and the Pussy Cats in the opening titles) is an American animated television series, based upon the Archie Comics comic book series of the same name created by Dan DeCarlo. Produced for Saturday morning television by Hanna-Barbera Productions, sixteen episodes of \"Josie and the Pussycats\" aired on CBS during the 1970–71 television season and were rerun during the 1971–72 season. In 1972, the show was re-conceptualized as Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space, sixteen episodes of which aired on CBS during the 1972–73 season and were rerun the following season until January 1974. Reruns of the original series alternated between CBS, ABC, and NBC from 1974 through 1976. This brought its national Saturday morning TV run on three networks to six years.\n\n\"Josie and the Pussycats\" featured an all-girl pop music band that toured the world with their entourage, getting mixed up in strange adventures, spy capers, and mysteries. On the small-screen, the group consisted of level-headed lead singer, songwriter and guitarist Josie, intelligent bassist Valerie, and air-headed blonde drummer Melody. Other characters included their cowardly manager Alexander Cabot III, his conniving sister Alexandra, her cat Sebastian, and muscular roadie Alan.\n\nThe show, more similar to Hanna-Barbera's successful \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" than the original \"Josie\" comic book, is famous for its music, the girls' leopard print leotards (replete with \"long tails and ears for hats,\" as the theme song states), and for featuring Valerie as the first regularly appearing female black character in a Saturday morning cartoon show. Each episode featured a Josie and the Pussycats song played over a chase scene, which, in a similar fashion to \"The Monkees\", featured the group running after and from a selection of haplessly villainous characters.\n\nDuring the 1968-69 television season, the first \"Archie\"-based Saturday morning cartoon, \"The Archie Show,\" was a huge success, not only in the ratings on CBS, but also on the Billboard charts: The Archies' song \"Sugar, Sugar\" hit the #1 spot on the Billboard charts in September 1969, becoming the number one song of the year. Animation studio Hanna-Barbera Productions wanted to duplicate the success their competitors Filmation were having with \"The Archie Show\". After a failed attempt at developing a teenage-music-band show of their own called \"Mysteries Five\" (which eventually became \"Scooby-Doo, Where are You!\"), they decided to go to the source and contacted Archie Comics about possibly adapting one of their remaining properties into a show similar to \"The Archie Show.\" Archie and Hanna-Barbera collaborated to adapt Archie's \"Josie\" comic book into a music-based property about a teenage music band, adding new characters (Alan M. and Valerie) while dismissing others.\n\nIn preparation for the upcoming cartoon series, Hanna-Barbera began working on putting together a real-life Josie and the Pussycats girl group, who would provide the singing voices of the girls in the cartoons and also record an album of songs to be used both as radio singles and in the TV series.\n\nThe Josie and the Pussycats recordings were produced by La La Productions, run by Danny Janssen and Bobby Young. They held a talent search to find three girls who would match the three girls in the comic book in both looks and singing ability; early plans, which did not come to fruition, called for a live-action Pussycats segment at the end of each episode. After interviewing over 500 finalists, settled upon casting Kathleen Dougherty (Cathy Dougher) as Josie, Cherie Moor (later known as Cheryl Ladd) as Melody, and Patrice Holloway as Valerie.\n\nJanssen presented the newly formed band to William Hanna and Joseph Barbera to finalize the production deal. Hanna-Barbera wanted Janssen to recast Patrice Holloway, because they had decided to portray \"Josie and the Pussycats\" as an all-white trio and had altered Valerie, who had been conceived as African-American and was already appearing as such in Archie Comics' revamped \"Josie and the Pussycats\" comic book, to make her white. Janssen refused to recast Holloway and threatened to walk away from the project. After a three-week-long stand-off between Janssen and Hanna-Barbera, Hanna-Barbera finally relented and allowed Janssen to keep Holloway, and changed Valerie back to being African-American. The Valerie character was the first African-American female character on a regular Saturday morning cartoon series. \"The Hardy Boys\" drummer Pete Jones had been the first African-American male to appear on Saturday mornings a year earlier.\n\nThe show's theme song, titled \"Josie and the Pussycats\", was written by Hoyt Curtin, William Hanna (under the pseudonym \"Denby Williams\") and Joseph Barbera (under the pseudonym \"Joseph Roland\"). Patrice Holloway, the singing voice of Valerie, sings the lead vocal on the recording. The theme song was based on melodies from an incidental tune played on various Hanna-Barbera cartoons since \"The Jetsons\".\n\nA cover of \"Josie and the Pussycats\" performed by Juliana Hatfield and Tanya Donelly is included on the 1995 tribute album \"\", produced by Ralph Sall for MCA Records.\n\n\"Josie and the Pussycats\" debuted on the CBS Saturday morning lineup on September 12, 1970, with the episode \"The Nemo's a No-No Affair.\" The animated version of \"Josie\" was an amalgam of plot devices, villain types, settings, moods, and tones from other Hanna-Barbera shows such as \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\", \"Jonny Quest\", \"Space Ghost\", and \"Shazzan\".\n\nLike \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\", \"Josie and the Pussycats\" was originally broadcast with a laugh track. Later home video and DVD releases omit the laugh track. Cartoon Network and Boomerang, however, have aired the show its original broadcast format with laughter intact.\n\nEach episode would find the Pussycats and crew en route to perform a gig or record a song in some exotic location. Somehow, often due to something Alexandra did, they would accidentally find themselves mixed up in an adventure/mystery. The antagonist was always a diabolical mad scientist, spy, or criminal who wanted to take over the world using some hi-tech device. The Pussycats would usually find themselves in possession of the plans for an invention, an item of interest to the villains, a secret spy message, etc., and the villains would give chase. Eventually, the Pussycats would formulate a plan to destroy the villain's plans and bring them to justice, which result in a final chase sequence set to a Pussycats song.\n\nThe Pussycats would succeed in capturing the villain and get back to their gig/recording session/etc. The final gag always centered around one of Alexandra's attempts to interfere with/put an end to The Pussycats' performance and/or steal Alan away from Josie, which would always backfire on her.\n\n\nIn September 1972, a sequel spin-off series titled \"Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space\" debuted on CBS. This version of the series launched the characters into outer space; the opening credits sequence shows the group taking a promotional photo at the launch site of a new spaceship and a jealous Alexandra elbowing the cast aside to steal the spotlight from Josie. However, Alexandra is jerked inside as well and triggers the launch sequence, sending them and the ship into deep space. Despite never having been in the spaceship before, Val seems to know how to pilot it. Every episode centered on the Pussycats encountering a strange new world, where they would encounter and often be kidnapped by various alien races before escaping and attempting to return home.\n\nMusical numbers and chase sequences set to newly recorded songs were featured in this spin-off series as with the original. \"Josie in Outer Space\" also added the character of Bleep, a pet-sized fluffy alien adopted by Melody, who was the only one who could understand the creature (who only says \"Bleep\") and numerous other alien animals encountered.\n\nThe 16 episodes of \"Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space\" were re-run for the 1973-1974 season until January 26, 1974, when CBS canceled it and ordered no more new \"Josie\" episodes from Hanna-Barbera. \"Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space\" contained a laugh track as well but utilized an inferior version created by the studio.\n\nJosie and The Pussycats made a final appearance as animated characters in a guest shot on the September 22, 1973, episode of \" The New Scooby-Doo Movies\", \"The Haunted Showboat\". Early production art for Hanna-Barbera's 1977 \"all-star\" \"Battle of the Network Stars\" spoof \"Laff-A-Lympics\" featured Alexandra, Sebastian, Alexander, and Melody among other Hanna-Barbera characters as members of the \"Scooby Doobies\" team, but legal problems prevented their inclusion in the final program.\n\nIn 1976, Rand McNally published a children's book based on the \"Josie\" TV show, \"Hanna-Barbera's Josie and the Pussycats: The Bag Factory Detour\".\n\nThe original \"Josie and the Pussycats\" series was re-run on NBC Saturday morning for the 1975-1976 season, and weekdays in syndication from 1977 to 1982. In the mid-1980s, both series, along with a number of other 1970s Hanna-Barbera cartoons, were on board USA Network's \"Cartoon Express\"; they would next appear on Cartoon Network in 1992, where all 32 episodes were run in the same time slot. Both programs, as of March 3, 2014, are in the library of Boomerang (Turner Broadcasting's archive cartoon channel).\n\nSpeaking Voices\nSinging Voices\n\n\"Band Members Only\"\n\n\nA VHS videocassette of \"Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space\" containing 3 episodes was issued by Worldvision Home Video in 1980. A second video cassette, \"Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space, Volume 2\", was released in 1985.\n\nTwo VHS volumes of \"Josie and the Pussycats\", each containing four episodes of the original 1970 series, minus the laugh tracks, were released by Warner Home Video (Hanna-Barbera had been sold to Turner Broadcasting in 1991, with Turner merging with Time Warner six years later) on April 10, 2001 to coincide with the release of the live-action film. A \"Josie in Outer Space\" episode, \"Warrior Women of Amazonia\", was featured in a clip/episode collection of Hanna-Barbera on VHS, released in the UK.\n\nA \"Josie and the Pussycats: The Complete Series\" two-DVD box set was released in Region 1 (the United States, Canada, and Japan) on September 18, 2007. All sixteen episodes, again minus the laugh tracks, were included, as well as a half-hour documentary on the life and career of Dan DeCarlo.

Different animation styles are used for each era. The same year, \"Josie and the Pussycats\" was adapted into a live-action motion picture. The film, produced by Universal Pictures, featured a punk rock cover of the theme song during the end credits.\n\nThe 2004–2007 Comedy Central animated TV series \"Drawn Together\" featured a character named Foxxy Love. An African-American mystery-solving musician, she was a direct parody of the \"Josie and the Pussycats\" character Valerie Brown.\n\nSeveral episodes of \"Speed Buggy\", a later Hanna-Barbera show, had similar plots to \"Josie and the Pussycats\" episodes, specifically \"A Greenthumb is Not a Goldfinger\" (\"Island of the Giant Plants\"), \"X Marks the Spot\" (\"Out of Sight\"), and the \"Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space\" episode \"Warrior Women of Amazonia\" (called \"The Hidden Valley of Amazonia\" in \"Speed Buggy\").\n\nIn 2016, Josie and the Pussycats was rebooted as a comic book. This update features the origins of the band. Originally, Josie was a struggling musician who merely played an emptied bar while heckled by her former friend, Alexandra. After talking with her roommate, Melody and bringing a stray cat to the vets, they meet Valerie, a veterinarian. The trio decided to play for the Animal Shelter Fundraiser. Despite Alexandra's attempts, the trio is a success and decided to call themselves Josie and The Pussycats, where they meet the producer Alan M.\n\nThe 2017 live action TV series \"Riverdale\" featured Josie and the Pussycats as African-American students at the local high school. Josie's mother is the town mayor.\n\n\n\n"}

Similar laments can be found in the Book of Jeremiah, the Book of Ezekiel and the Book of Psalms, Psalm 137 (), a song covered by Boney M in 1978 as Rivers of Babylon.\n\nThe first lines of the lament were discovered on the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology catalogue of the Babylonian section, tablet numbers 2204, 2270, 2302 and 19751 from their excavations at the temple library at Nippur. These were translated by George Aaron Barton in 1918 and first published as \"Sumerian religious texts\" in \"Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions\", number six, entitled \"A prayer for the city of Ur\". The restored tablet is at its thickest point. Barton noted that \"from the portions that can be translated it appears to be a prayer for the city of Ur at a time of great danger and distress. It seems impossible to assign it with certainty to any particular period.\" He noted that it was plausible but unconfirmed to conjecture that it \"was written in the last days of Ibbi-Sin when Ur was tottering to its fall\".\n\nEdward Chiera published other tablets CBS 3878, 6889, 6905, 7975, 8079, 10227, 13911 and 14110 in \"Sumerian texts of varied contents\" in 1934, which combined with tablets CBS 3901, 3927, 8023, 9316, 11078 and 14234 to further restore the myth, calling it a \"Lamentation over the city of Ur\". A further tablet source of the myth is held by the Louvre in Paris, number AO 6446. Others are held in the Ashmolean, Oxford, numbers 1932,415, 1932,522, 1932,526j and 1932,526o. Further tablets were found to be part of the myth in the Hilprecht collection at the University of Jena, Germany, numbers 1426, 1427, 1452, 1575, 1579, 1487, 1510 and 1553. More fragments are held at the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire (Geneva) in Switzerland, MAH 15861 and MAH 16015.\n\nOther translations were made from tablets in the Nippur collection of the Museum of the Ancient Orient in Istanbul (Ni). Samuel Noah Kramer amongst others worked to translate several others from the Istanbul collection including Ni 4496, 1162, 2401, 2510, 2518, 2780, 2911, 3166, 4024, 4424, 4429, 4459, 4474, 4566, 9586, 9599, 9623, 9822 and 9969. Other tablets from the Istanbul collection, numbers Ni 2510 and 2518 were translated by Edward Chiera in 1924 in \"Sumerian religious texts\". Sir Charles Leonard Woolley unearthed more tablets at Ur contained in the \"Ur excavations texts\" from 1928. Other tablets are held in the Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin and the Yale Babylonian collection. Samuel Noah Kramer compiled twenty-two different fragments into the first complete edition of the \"Lament\", which was published in 1940 by the University of Chicago as \"Lamentation over the Destruction of Ur\" (\"Assyriological Study\" no. 12). Other tablets and versions were used to bring the myth to its present form with a composite text by Miguel Civil produced in 1989 and latest translations by Thorkild Jacobsen in 1987 and Joachim Krecher in 1996.\n\nThe lament is composed of four hundred and thirty eight lines in eleven \"kirugu\" (sections), arranged in stanzas of six lines. It describes the goddess Ningal, who weeps for her city after pleading with the god Enlil to call back a destructive storm. Interspersed with the goddess's wailing are other sections, possibly of different origin and composition; these describe the ghost town that Ur has become, recount the wrath of Enlil's storm, and invoke the protection of the god Nanna (Nergal or Suen) against future calamities. Ningal, the wife of the moon god Nanna, goes on to recall her petition to the leaders of the gods, An and Enlil to change their minds and not to destroy Ur. She does this both in private and in a speech to the Annunaki assembly:\n\nThe council of gods decide that the Ur III dynasty, which had reigned for around one hundred years, had its destiny apportioned to end. The temple treasury was raided by invading Elamites and the centre of power in Sumer moved to Isin, while control of trade in Ur passed to several leading families of the city. Kenneth Wade suggested that Terah, the father of Abraham in the Book of Genesis could have been one of the heads of such a leading family (). The metaphor of a garden hut being knocked down is used for the destroyed temple of Ur and in subsequent lines this metaphorical language is extended to the rest of the setting, reminiscent of the representation of Jerusalem as a \"booth\" in the Book of Amos (). Ningal bewails:\n\nThe different temples throughout the land are described with their patron gods or goddesses abandoning the temples, like sheepfolds:\n\nEdward L. Greenstein has noted the emptying of sheep pens as a metaphor of the destruction of the city. He also notes that the speakers of the laments are generally male lamentation-priests, who take on the characteristics of a traditional female singer and ask for the gods to be appeased so the temples can be restored. Then a goddess, sometimes accompanied by a god notes the devastation and weeps bitterly with a dirge about the destructive storm and an entreats to the gods to return to the sanctuaries. The destruction of the Elamites is compared in the myth to imagery of a rising flood and raging storm. This imagery is facilitated by the title of Enlil as the \"god of the winds\" The following text suggests that the setting of the myth was subject to a destructive storm prior to its final destruction:\n\nVarious buildings are noted to be destroyed in Enlil's storm, including the shrines of Agrun-kug and Egal-mah, the Ekur (the sanctuary of Enlil), the Iri-kug, the Eridug and the Unug. The destruction of the E-kic-nu-jal is described in detail. \n\nImages of what was lost, and the scorched earth that was left behind indicate the scale of the catastrophe. The Line 274 reads \n\nThe destruction of the location is reported to Enlil, and his consort Ninlil, who are praised and exalted at the end of the myth.\n\nThe Lament for Ur has been well known to scholarship and well edited for a long time. Piotr Michalowski has suggested this gave literary primacy to the myth over the Lament for Sumer and Ur, originally called the \"Second Lament for Ur\", which he argues was chronologically a more archaic version. Philip S. Alexander compares lines seventeen and eighteen of the myth with \"The Lord has done what he purposed, he has carried out his threat; as he ordained long ago, he has demolished without pity\", suggesting this could \"allude to some mysterious, ineluctable fate ordained for Zion in the distant past\":\n\nThe devastation of cities and settlements by natural disasters and invaders has been used widely throughout the history of literature since the end of the Third Dynasty of Ur. A stela (pictured) from Iraq depicts a similar destruction of a mountain house at Susa. \n\nMichelle Breyer suggested tribes of neighbouring shepherds destroyed the city and called Ur, \"the last great city to fall\".\n\n\n\n"}

After five years and four versions, it passed the U.S. Congress in 2010, granting equal protection to community radio stations with regard to translator and booster stations. All three types of stations remain secondary to full-power radio stations, which are typically owned by major corporations and nonprofits. (Previously, this second-class status was only a part of FCC regulation, rather than law.) The act negates the Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000, which enacted prevented community LPFM stations on the basis of RF interference.\n\n\nSponsored in the U.S. House of Representatives by Congressmen Mike Doyle and Lee Terry and in the U.S. Senate by Senators Maria Cantwell and John McCain the Local Community Radio Act of 2007 failed to be voted on. The House bill, H.R. 2802, was referred to the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet on June 21, 2007. Since the bill was not passed in FY 2007, the bill was removed from the docket as Never Passed.\n\nThis bill was an update of the Local Community Radio Act of 2007. It required FCC to alter current rules in order to eliminate the minimum distance separation between low-power FM stations and third-adjacent-channel stations. Previously, there had been a minimum distance requirement, however the FCC found that LPFM stations did not cause any interference on third-adjacent channel stations, thus eliminating the need for such a requirement.\n\nThe Local Community Radio Act of 2009 also required that the FCC keep the rules that offer interference protection to third-adjacent channels that offer a radio reading service (the reading of newspapers, books or magazines for those who are blind or hearing impaired.) This protection was to ensure that such channels are not subject to possible interference by LPFM stations.\n\nThe final part of the bill required that when giving out licenses to FM stations, the FCC must make licenses available to LPFM stations and that licensing decisions be made with regard to local community needs.\n\nThe bill had unanimous bipartisan support from FCC leadership.\nIt was passed by the House and referred to the Senate.\n\nThe Local Community Radio Act of 2010 (based upon legislation originally introduced in 2005) was signed into law by President Barack Obama on January 4, 2011 as , after passage in the House on December 17, 2010, and the U.S. Senate on December 18, 2010. In a statement after the bill became law, Federal Communications Commission Chair Julius Genachowski said, \"Low power FM stations are small, but they make a giant contribution to local community programming. This important law eliminates the unnecessary restrictions that kept these local stations off the air in cities and towns across the country.\" The Act states the following: The Federal Communications Commission, when licensing new FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations, shall ensure that--\n(1) licenses are available to FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations;\n(2) such decisions are made based on the needs of the local community; and\n(3) FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations remain equal in status and secondary to existing and modified full-service FM stations.\nIn General- The Federal Communications Commission shall modify its rules to eliminate third-adjacent minimum distance separation requirements between--\n(1) low-power FM stations; and\n(2) full-service FM stations, FM translator stations, and FM booster stations.\n\nIn July 2011, the FCC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in response to the law. It proposes to put a \"floor\" on the number of community LPFM stations in each media market, without considering the land area which the market covers. This could be detrimental for community stations in markets with a lower population density, and could result in LPFM stations being pushed into the exurbs, where more channels are available, but far fewer potential listeners live within a small broadcast range.\n\nA March 19, 2012 FTC ruling appears to address the concern that major corporations using \"translator\" stations as LPFMs, originating programming that could otherwise only have been heard on AM or on a proprietary digital radio system called HD Radio. This use, disallowed by the FCC, could have circumvented caps intended to prevent excessive concentration of media ownership, and violates the noncommercial, localism, power, and height rules that other community LPFM stations must abide by.\n"}

In 2008 IDW Publishing and Devil's Due Publishing (now Devil's Due Digital) became two of the earliest adopters of comics for mobile devices. Devil's Due's initially offered mobile comics through companies such as Uclick, on their GoComics Mobile Store. \nMobile comic content has until recently been miniatuarized or adapted versions of established branded comic content. With the rise of file sharing and piracy it has been increasingly hard for publishers to control money leakage from digital/mobile comics and as such publishers (especially traditional Japanese Manga houses) have shied away from licensing digital or mobile comics.\n\nThis however, has led to the rise of user-generated (independent artists) using platforms to publish and sell their work at low cost, and (for the first time in years) do so profitably.\n\nThe challenges for mobile comics creation include:\n\n\nSeveral mobile content providers have now developed their own mobile comics platforms, some using java-based applications which have to be downloaded to the mobile first before comics can be viewed. Others are using Multi Media Messaging and WAP subscription to deliver strips. However, there are platforms for iPhone and iPad that have been developed to distribute RSS-based webcomics for free, such as the iOS application Comic Avenue.\n\nInitially the titles released were existing comics licensed for the new medium but new titles are emerging purely on the mobile phone. \"Thunder Road\" is the first original title for the medium, featuring artist Steven Sanders who previously worked on \"The Five Fists of Science\". \"Carnival of Souls\" is the first digital and motion comic book series on Blackberry's App World, written by Jazan Wild. \"The Carrier\" is the first original graphic novel exclusively on the iPhone, written by Evan Young. \"Alien Revolution\" an eight chapter multi language comic, by Illot.\"Mobilecomic\" A collection of comics.

Each European country has their own set of widely different laws which regulate mobile gambling ranging from Finland where a government monopoly operates internet casinos to Norway which is in favor of complete prohibition of online gambling.\n\nAccording to a Juniper Research report released in September 2010 the total sum wagered on mobile casino games is expected to surpass $48 billion US dollars by 2015. The report bases this prediction on (1) the high growth rates of mobile casinos, lotteries and sports betting providers in major emerging markets and China; (2) liberalization of mobile gambling legislation in Europe; (3) United States repealing the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, permitting people in the US to legally gamble online again.\n\nA 2010 Gartner forecast sees 2014 global mobile gambling revenues reach $11.4 billion.\n\nAccording to a February 2010 comScore MobiLens study of the U.S. mobile gaming market, smartphone subscribers are much more likely to play mobile casino games than subscribers of generic phones. The study revealed that 7.6% of smartphone subscribers and 1.2% of generic mobile subscribers played mobile casino games within a three-month time frame.\n\nAside from availability online, United States of America-based mobile casino apps have appeared in several land-based locations that can be utilized to gamble only while physically present on the casino's property. This extends to outside areas that are still within the boundaries of the property, making them the first type of slot machine, sports-betting, and random number generated gambling to take place legally off the licensed gaming floor while still inside a U.S. casino.\n\nAccording to VentureBeat, Google does not allow any real-money gambling apps on its Google Play Store.\n\nIn 2013 Apple and Google reversed a decision to permit mobile gambling applications to be distributed by their service in the United States.\n"}
{"id": "3636152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3636152", "title": "Model release", "text": "Model release\n\nA model release, known in similar contexts as a liability waiver, is a legal release typically signed by the subject of a photograph granting permission to publish the photograph in one form or another. The legal rights of the signatories in reference to the material is thereafter subject to the allowances and restrictions stated in the release, and also possibly in exchange for compensation paid to the photographed. A model release is not needed for most photograph publication because of freedom of speech rights (which vary by country.) A model release is needed for publication where personality rights or privacy rights would otherwise be infringed.\n\nNo release is required for publication, as news, of a photo taken of an identifiable person when the person is in a public place. In general, no release is required for publication of a photo taken of an identifiable person when the person is in a public space unless the use is for trade or direct commercial use, which is defined as promoting a product, service, or idea. Publication of a photo of an identifiable person, even if taken when the person is in a public place, that implies endorsement, without a model release signed by that person, can result in civil liability for whoever publishes the photograph.\n\nNote that no model release is needed for the act of taking the photograph. Rather, if needed, the model release applies to the publication of the photograph. Liability rests solely with the publisher, except under special conditions. The photographer is typically not the publisher of the photograph, but usually licenses the photograph to someone else to publish. It is typical for the photographer to obtain the model release not merely because they are present at the time and \"can\" get it, but also because it gives them more opportunity to license the photograph later to a party who wishes to publish it.\n\nNote that the issue of model release forms and liability waivers is a legal area related to privacy and is separate from copyright. Also, the need for model releases pertains to public \"use\" of the photos: i.e., publishing them, commercially or not. The act of \"taking\" a photo of someone in a public setting without a model release, or of viewing or non-commercially showing such a photo in private, generally does not create legal exposure, at least in the United States.\n\nThe legal issues surrounding model releases are complex and vary by jurisdiction. Although the risk to photographers is virtually nil (so long as proper disclosures of the existence of a release, and its content is made to whoever licenses the photo for publication), the business need for having releases rises substantially if the main source of income from the photographer's work lies within industries that would require them (such as advertising). In short, photojournalists almost never need to obtain model releases for images they shoot for (or sell to) news or qualified editorial publications.\n\nPhotographers who also \"publish\" images may need releases to protect themselves, but there is a distinction between making an image \"available for sale\" (even via a website), which is not considered \"publication\" in a form that would require a release, and the use of the same image to promote a product or service in a way that would require a release.\n\n\n\n"}

The song laments what can be done with an Electronic Benefit Transfer card (used for financial entitlements in the United States.) \n\nThe song and its video became controversial, especially among conservative pundits, who considered the song a glorification of the country's welfare system.\n\nThe lyrics of \"My EBT\" are based on real-life examples of welfare abuse that Lafleur had witnessed first-hand. The song laments a person using their sister's E.B.T. card (which is considered to be a fraudulent and hence also abusive use of the card) to acquire a large array of junk food (mostly potato chips and soft drinks) from various stores (\"never going hungry, swiping all day\"), and attempting to, but failing to also purchase marijuana and alcohol on the card as well. As an excuse for the actions, the song also states that it is okay because \"it's an E.B.T., it ain't food stamps.\" \n\nThe song was also accompanied by a music video posted on YouTube, which featured Lafleur going around to various stores to purchase junk food using an E.B.T. card, much like what is described in the song itself.\n\nThe song gained attention when its music video was posted by the Drudge Report. Numerous conservative commentators and websites criticized the song and video, complaining that the video \"celebrat[ed] the pure coolness of any and all things gotten for nothing\", and glorified welfare. Ben Shapiro criticized the song by stating that \"it's almost impossible to sum up what's wrong with America's economy while standing on one leg. Unless your name is Mr. EBT\", and that he is \"the sort of leech who is bankrupting our society.\" \n\nIn response to the criticism, Lefleur defended the video by saying that the song and video represented the problems with the E.B.T. system and people who abuse it, described as being people who \"[rub] the benefit card in the face of taxpayers\" (as he portrayed himself doing in the video), thus denying help to those who really need it the most.\n"}

It is considered as a major coordinated state retaliation following the deadly Peshawar school attack. The plan received unprecedented levels of support and co-operation across the country's political spectrum, inclusive of the federal and provincial governments.\n\nIt combines foreign and domestic policy initiatives aimed to crack down on and eventually eliminate across the country. The plan was provided as the framework for the Twenty-first Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan which established speedy trial military courts for offences relating to terrorism. It has also led to the resumption of capital punishment and mandatory re-verification through fingerprint recognition of all subscribers on mobile telephony.\n\nThe National Action Plan authorises the Foreign, Finance, and other ministerial departments to reach out to the friendly Muslim countries to clamp down on financiers of sectarian and terrorist networks operating against Pakistan.\n\nOn 16 December 2014, six gunmen affiliated with the Tehrik-i-Taliban (TTP) conducted a terrorist attack on the Army Public School in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar. The militants, all of whom were foreign nationals, included one Chechen, three Arabs and two Afghans. They entered the school and opened fire on school staff and children, killing 145 people, including 132 schoolchildren, ranging between eight and eighteen years of age. A rescue operation was launched by the Pakistan Army's Special Services Group (SSG) special forces, who killed all six terrorists and rescued 960 people.\n\nOn 24 December 2014 political parties conference chaired by the then Prime Minister of Pakistan reached consensus over the issue of setting up military courts for tackling terrorism cases in the country, along with a wider plan to tackle terrorism.\n\nOn 24 December the Prime Minister (PM) in a televised address to the nation announced the 'National Action Plan' (NAP) to deal with terrorism. According to the Interior Minister, the plan was prepared in the light of the decisions taken by All Parties Conference. For this purpose the PM established the National Action Committee consisting of the members from all the political parties and decision were taken in the light of the recommendations of this committee. The PM's address gave the following outline of the National Action Plan, the points of which were decided in the APC.\n\nThe Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) called off the protests and participated in the APC. However, it abstained from voting the bill and amendment. Jamiat Ulema-e Islam (F) (JUI F) and Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) also abstained from voting. JI proposed that the word religion should be omitted from the text of the bill. JUI insisted that the word sect is objectionable. The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Awami National Party (ANP) voted in favour of the bill and amendment.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4739589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4739589", "title": "Nudity in American television", "text": "Nudity in American television\n\nNudity in American television has always been a controversial topic. Aside from a few exceptions, nudity in the United States has traditionally not been shown on terrestrial television. On the other hand, cable television has been much less constrained as far as nudity is concerned.\n\nThe Public Broadcasting Service, which features nudity in anthropological documentaries as well as some films, was the first network to display national programming that featured frontal female nudity on television. In 1975 (with a rerun in 1986), the PBS \"National Geographic\" special \"\" looked into parts of the human body and included in its opening scenes a fully nude woman in an artist's model pose; probably less for this than the innovative micro- and interior cinematography, this was for more than half a decade the most popular single program broadcast on the network.\n\nThe special-event miniseries, \"Roots\" on ABC, featured some partial nudity of its cast, usually fleetingly, but more so than other commercial network programming in the US in the 1970s.\n\nThroughout the United States, many metropolitan areas had independent television stations that were not affiliated with any of the national networks and showed programming only to people within their limited broadcast range. During the 1980s, many of these stations experimented with content containing frontal female nudity in movies during prime time. KTLA in Los Angeles, for example, showed an unedited version of the Academy Award-winning \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", which featured fully exposed female breasts, between 7:30 and 11 p.m. The channel began the time slot with a video of director Miloš Forman stating that the film was too controversial to be allowed a faithful television broadcast (NBC's earlier broadcast had cut the film to fit the two hours format with commercials), but that KTLA believed that the culture had changed such that a complete broadcast would be tolerated and appreciated. Then, it was followed by a disclaimer that was repeated after each commercial break.\n\nKTVU in the San Francisco Bay Area regularly showed uncensored films that contained nudity, such as \"Magnum Force\" (1973, with uncredited Suzanne Somers appearing topless in a pool scene), \"Big Bad Mama\" (1974, with Angie Dickinson and William Shatner), and \"Walkabout\" (1971, which contained full frontal nudity in a nude bathing scene with then–teenage actress Jenny Agutter).\n\nA number of stations in this era even went so far as to run promotions during which they would show a series of movies known for nudity in an attempt to get higher ratings for the week. In almost all cases, the nudity was restricted to showing exposed buttocks and female breasts.\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, most of these stations had started to receive complaints about such nudity and these broadcasts eventually stopped. In addition, some of these stations became Fox affiliates and were no longer able to make independent programming decisions during prime time.\n\nFrom the early 1990s until the early 2000s, some prime time series (such as ABC's \"NYPD Blue\" and \"Once and Again\", CBS's \"Chicago Hope\" and Fox's \"John Doe\") experimented with nudity. \"NYPD Blue\" is noteworthy for featuring nudity in the context of people engaging in sexual activity. While fully exposed female breasts were never shown, the show often depicted full back nudity of men and women.\n\nIn 1997, NBC broadcast an unedited version of Steven Spielberg's Holocaust film \"Schindler's List\" in prime time. The film features brief full-frontal nudity of both sexes in non-sexual contexts. Then-Congressman Tom Coburn criticized NBC's airing of the film for its nudity, violence and profanity. Both Democrats and Coburn's fellow Republicans criticized Coburn for his reaction, and defended the film and NBC's choice to air it in full. Coburn subsequently apologized for his reaction.\n\nAfter Justin Timberlake exposed Janet Jackson's breast during a live performance at the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show, a moral panic occurred, and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) tightened its indecency rules due to public pressure.\n\nAs a consequence of the public and media reaction to the incident, major networks edited some of their shows. CBS removed a shot of a naked man from \"Without a Trace\", while NBC deleted a two-second shot of an elderly woman's breast from \"ER\". Subsequently, prime time television networks became more reluctant to show even non-explicit nudity in their TV shows. In the current climate, nudity is almost unknown on any broadcast television show — with the exception being animated series such as \"The Simpsons\" and \"Family Guy\" (which spoofed the conservative phase of American television in the episode \"PTV\").\n\nCable television, on the other hand, is not bound by FCC rules and can show whatever material their executives consider suitable. With some exceptions, while cable channels that rely on advertising still do not show nudity during prime time, nudity is often shown on premium cable channels such as Showtime, HBO and Turner Classic Movies (TCM). FX is one of the few commercial–dependent cable channels that features nudity in its programming (notably the controversial \"Nip/Tuck\" and American Horror Story). SundanceTV will allow nudity. Discovery and other documentary-related channels may show nudity in a journalistic context, such as that of indigenous peoples.\n\n\"Dating Naked\" is an American reality series dating game show shown on VH1. Modelled on Dutch show \"Adam Zkt. Eva\", the series debuted in July 2014, and ran through 2016. The show matches up heterosexual contestants who are nude most of the time. The genitals of all participants along with the female breasts, and occasionally the buttocks, are blurred out. \"Naked and Afraid\" is an American reality series shown on the Discovery Channel. The fifth season premiered on March 13, 2016. Each episode chronicles the lives of two survivalists (one female, one male) who meet for the first time and are given the task of surviving a stay in the wilderness naked for 21 days. Again, the contestants' crotch area and the women's breasts are blurred out.\n\nWhile nudity practically disappeared from network television, a Kaiser Family Foundation study of sex on television released in November 2005 showed that TV characters are having sex twice as often as they were in 1998. The study examined more than 1,000 hours of programming.\n\nIn recent years, a number of cable stations in the United States have begun to air R-rated movies uncensored. They include \"Deadpool\" and \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" airing on FX.\n\n\n"}

It has character development. 6. The characters of Richeut and Herselot, the maid, exist outside of this text.\n\nThis tale recounts the life of a prostitute who uses men to her advantage. She does not discriminate between classes, for she dupes a nobleman, a bourgeois and a clergyman into believing that they are the father of her son, whom she conceived on purpose because she felt that they were no longer paying her enough attention. All three men lavish her and her son with gifts to the point of ruining themselves. Her son, Samson, grows up with all of the privileges that money can buy. Bored by his surroundings, he boasts to his mother that his education is complete for he can easily lead any woman into his bed and, subsequently, into the whorehouse. His mother ridicules him and warns him of the treacherous ways of women. Slighted, Samson claims that no woman will ever make a fool of him and heads out into the world. Along his journeys, he conquers women of all nations and cheats men at dice, even becoming a monk at Clairvaux Abbey for a brief period of time. After twelve years of deflowering, pimping and dicing, he returns to his mother's hometown. Although he does not recognize her, she knows him and sets out to prove wrong his last boast to her. She tricks him into believing that Herselot, her faithful servant, is a young virgin whom he could never convince to go to bed with him. Intent upon proving her incorrect, he sets out to triumph over the unconquerable and believes to have succeeded. During the act however, he discovers that she is no more a virgin than he is. In the meantime, Richeut convinces seven men of her acquaintance to beat her son, but not kill him. Before Samson can leave Herselot's bed, the men beat him with Richeut intervening, pretending to save him from these men. His boast of twelve years earlier has thus been proven wrong.\n\n"}

Circuses were in need of music that would stir the audience into a frenzy, as four-footed animals galloped across the ring. Because march music was a prominent part of American music at that time, and because it carried such a quick tempo, it was this that ringmasters demanded.\n\nCircus marches are faster than a normal military march, often 130 to 150 beats/minute.\n\nAlthough screamers tend to follow the march form, many times they are abbreviated, and additions, such as a quick cornet call introduction to a new melody, are included. A typical screamer lasts a minute to three and a half minutes.\n\nScreamers are a very demanding type of music, due to their extremely fast and advanced rhythms, especially the low-brass parts. Double and even triple tonguing is often required in order to play these rhythms. The trio in \"The Melody Shop\" is a good example of this. \n\nMany screamers have two prominent melodies playing at once. Although this is not unusual in a march, screamers tend to go further with this. The low-brass section can be playing a long, stately melody, while the woodwinds can be moving along with a phrase of 16th notes, or vice versa. \n\nDue to the circumstances in which screamers are played, dynamics tend to stay at a level forte. Unlike some military marches, piano is rarely used.\n\nThe most prominent composer of circus marches is Karl L. King, most notably with his march \"Barnum & Bailey's Favorite\". Other screamer composers include Fred Jewell and Henry Fillmore. John Philip Sousa wrote \"On Parade\" and a few others, but his writing in the circus march style is not renowned.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In February 2015, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals filed a decision allowing Syed to appeal his conviction on grounds his attorney, Cristina Gutierrez, had provided ineffective counsel for failing to seek a plea bargain during his trial. The Court also announced that they would address the question of whether new evidence from Asia McClain, providing an alibi for Syed, would be admitted. Three months later the case was remanded back to the lower court, where Asia McClain and others testified in February 2016. Koenig attended that hearing and produced 3 short \"update\" episodes of \"Serial\", but this podcast run was abruptly truncated, mid-hearing, when Koenig left to continue production of Season 2.\n\nOn June 30, 2016, Judge Martin P. Welch granted Syed's motion for post-conviction relief, setting aside the original conviction and calling for a new trial, agreeing that it demonstrated ineffective assistance of counsel that Syed's lawyers did not question the interpretation of cellphone tower evidence during the original trial. The State appealed and lost when, on March 29, 2018, Maryland's intermediate appellate court upheld the lower court ruling for a new trial, in a 2-1 decision. The State has appealed the case again to Maryland's highest court, on the grounds that defense counsel should not be required to contact a potential alibi witness. The Court of Appeals will reach a decision by August 2019.\n\n\nIn September 2015, \"The New York Times\" reported the second season would focus on Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, an American Army soldier who was held for five years by the Taliban, and then charged with desertion. A spokesperson for \"Serial\" only said, \"Over the last few months they've been reporting on a variety of stories for both Seasons 2 and 3 of \"Serial\", along with other podcast projects.\" The first episode of the season was released, without any previous release date announcement, on December 10, 2015.\n\nFor Season 2, Koenig teamed up with Mark Boal, the Academy Award winning screenwriter of \"The Hurt Locker\" and \"Zero Dark Thirty\", and his production company, Page 1. Boal had conducted a series of interviews with Bergdahl as part of a film production he was working on, and both Boal and Bergdahl gave Koenig permission to use those excerpts of those recorded interviews in episodes of \"Serial\". As Koenig stated in Season 2's first episode: \"They'd come to us saying 'hey, we've been doing all this reporting on the story, and we've also got this tape. Do you think you might want to listen?' And yes, we did, and we were kind of blown away, and so we began working with them. They shared their research with us, and also put us in touch with many of their sources... We don't have anything to do with their movie, but Mark and Page 1 are our partners for Season 2.\"\n\nOn December 14, General Robert B. Abrams, head of United States Army Forces Command at Fort Bragg, North Carolina ordered that Bergdahl face a court-martial on charges of desertion.\n\nSarah Koenig announced on January 12, 2016, that the podcast schedule would be changed to every other week to allow for deeper reporting, and to add more information than initially planned, with Season 2 Episode 5 released on January 21, 2016. Internet radio service Pandora Radio streamed the second season of \"Serial.\"\n\nOn November 3, 2017, military judge Col. Jeffery R. Nance rendered a verdict dishonorably discharging Bergdahl from the Army, reducing his rank to private, requiring forfeit of some of his pay for ten months and no prison time. The verdict is subject to review by Gen. Robert B. Abrams, and may also be appealed to the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals. After the sentencing, \"Serial\" announced to be working on a \"coda\" for the season.\n\nIn June 2017, the Radio Television Digital News Association announced Season 2 of Serial has won the 2017 National Edward R. Murrow Award for a news series and for its website. Murrow Awards are presented in October in New York.\n\n\nSeason 3 is meant as an analysis of the normal operation of the American criminal justice system, as opposed to Season 1 and 2 that followed \"extraordinary\" cases. K.Austin Collins of \"Vanity Fair\" commented that the third season was \"an overarching account of an institution: the criminal-justice system, writ large\". Koenig has described Season 3 as \"a year watching ordinary criminal justice, in the least exceptional, most middle-of-the-road, most middle-of-the-country place we could find: Cleveland.\" Episodes follow different cases and are taped in Greater Cleveland, Ohio, with particular focus on cases before the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas at the Justice Center Complex in Downtown Cleveland.\n\nAndrew Liptak of \"The Verge\" commented that Koenig's opening monologue was \"stunning, almost cinematic\". He added that \"Serial\" is \"impossible to ignore in the field\" and its first release was a watershed moment for podcasts.\n\nThe concept for \"Serial\" originated with an experiment in Koenig's basement. Koenig and Snyder had pitched a different idea at a staff meeting for a weekly program on events during the previous seven days, which staff members received without enthusiasm. When Ira Glass asked Koenig if she had any other ideas, she mentioned podcasting a story that unfolded over time, a serialized narrative. In an interview with \"Mother Jones\", she explained that each episode would return to the same story, telling the next chapter of a long, true narrative.\n\nEpisode one of the series was released on October 3, 2014, with additional episodes released weekly online. Glass introduced it as a spinoff of his popular radio program, \"This American Life\", and aired episode one on his show. He explained, \"We want to give you the same experience you get from a great HBO or Netflix series, where you get caught up with the characters and the thing unfolds week after week, but with a true story, and no pictures. Like \"House of Cards\", but you can enjoy it while you're driving.\"\n\nNicholas Thorburn released the soundtrack for \"Serial \"on October 17, 2014. It includes fifteen tracks, all short instrumentals, and is available at the Bandcamp site or streamed from several reviewing sites.\n\nMark Henry Phillips, who mixes the show, has also provided original scores.\n\nMusical credits for Season 2 include Thorburn and Phillips, as well as Fritz Myers and staff music editor Kate Bilinski.\n\n\"Serial\"s launch was sponsored by MailChimp, a frequent podcast advertiser, and salaried staff positions were initially funded by WBEZ. Admitting the podcast was funded from \"This American Life\"s budget during the launch, producer Koenig noted that \"Serial\" would eventually need to generate its own funding. She said, \"Everyone's saying 'It's podcasting! It's internet! \"Of course\" there'll be money somewhere.' We're not exactly sure yet.\" Dana Chivvis, another producer, observed that, since the industry is still in its infancy, a business model for podcasting has yet to be established.\n\nTowards the end of the first season, producers asked for public donations to fund a second season. Within a week, the staff of \"Serial\" posted an announcement that a second season has been made possible by donations and sponsorship.\n\nThe first season of \"Serial\" was both culturally popular and critically well received. \"Serial\" was ranked at No. 1 on iTunes even before it débuted, leading iTunes rankings for over three months, well after the first season ended. It also broke records as the fastest podcast ever to reach 5 million downloads at Apple's iTunes store. David Carr in \"The New York Times\" called \"Serial\" \"Podcasting's first breakout hit.\" \"The Guardian\" characterized it as a \"new genre of audio storytelling\".\n\nIntroducing a \"PBS NewsHour\" segment about \"Serial\", Judy Woodruff noted that it is \"an unexpected phenomenon\", and Hari Sreenivasan mentioned it has \"five million downloads on iTunes, far more than any other podcast in history\".\n\nCalling the characters \"rich and intriguing\", \"The Daily Californian\" noted similarities to the film \"The Thin Blue Line\" (1988), and described the podcast as \"gripping\" and the story as \"thrilling\", while applauding the series for giving \"listeners a unique opportunity to humanize the players\".\n\n\"Slate\"s reviewer pointed out that \"Serial\" is not escapist and went on to note: \"Someone in the show is not telling the truth about something very sinister. That's the narrative tension that makes \"Serial\" not only compelling but also unlike anything I can remember watching or reading before.\" \"The Baltimore Sun\" commented on the inherently riveting subject matter and noted that the top-notch reporting and podcast format yield \"a novel twist on the investigative long-form piece\".\n\nA critique from the journalism community was more qualified. First noting that some people believe there is a \"podcast renaissance\", the reviewer from Harvard's Nieman Journalism Lab observed that even though podcasts are not new, they are not yet mainstream.\n\nNot all critiques of the podcasting format have been as equivocal. \"PopMatters\" observed that podcasting is a new distribution model, very different from television as a distribution model because it gives users access to media and the freedom to listen to episodes of a long-form story while doing other things. The reviewer applauded the focus on long-form journalism and added, \"Suddenly you feel like the full promise of podcasting has just been unleashed. That long-form narrative nonfiction is really the way to best leverage the potential of podcasting as a distribution model.\" A \"Wall Street Journal\" critic observed: \"podcasts have slipped marketers' minds. ZenithOptimedia, for example, put out a forecast predicting 0% growth for the medium after years of positive momentum.\" Discussing the economics of podcast advertising, \"New York Magazine\" noted that the personal nature of the podcast format allows higher advertising rates: \"CPM (the cost to an advertiser per thousand impressions, a standard ad-industry unit) was between $20 and $45. Compare that to a typical radio CPM (roughly $1 to $18) or network TV ($5 to $20) or even a regular old web ad ($1 to $20), and the podcast wins.\"\n\nMultiple reviews have commented on the addictive nature of \"Serial.\" A review in \"New York Magazine\" linked fans' feelings about the possibility of an ambiguous ending with their psychological need for closure. Reddit hosts a \"Serial\" subreddit site. \"Slate\" is also \"following the story closely\" and presents a podcast discussion of \"Serial \"every week following the latest release.\n\nSeveral reviews have criticised the ethics of \"Serial\", notably the decision to start broadcasting without the reporting having been finished. Critics said the \"live investigation\" format invited listeners to do their own sleuthing, which quickly led to exposure online of the full names and even addresses of people who were questioned by the police. Another point of debate was whether it was legitimate to use the murder of Hae Min Lee as a subject for entertainment.\n\nSarah Koenig's reporting has also been criticized as being biased in favor of Adnan's innocence, and Katy Waldman's \"Slate\" blog noted that some felt \"Serial\" undercut Adnan's detractors. An \"Atlantic\" roundtable discussion noted that the podcast forces the listener to consider Koenig's \"verification bias\", the tendency to seek answers that support her own biased assumptions, and that \"even a well-meaning narrator isn't always credible\".\n\nOne critic asserted that Koenig presented the story of a murder involving two minority teenagers and their cultures through a lens of white privilege, \"a white interpreter 'stomping through communities that she does not understand' \". A rejoinder in \"The Atlantic\" pointed out, \"\"Serial\" is a reflection on a murder case and the criminal-justice system reported over 'just' a year, which is to say, it is researched with more effort and depth than 99 percent of journalism produced on any beat in America... Most of all, the response to mistakes should never be to discourage white reporters from telling important stories.\"\n\n\"Serial\" was honored with a Peabody award in April 2015, noting \"\"Serial\" rocketed podcasting into the cultural mainstream\", and that it was an \"experiment in long-form, non-fiction audio storytelling\". It was cited for \"its innovations of form and its compelling, drilling account of how guilt, truth, and reality are decided\". Dr. Jeffrey P. Jones, Director of the Peabody Awards, commented the podcast showed \"how new avenues and approaches to storytelling can have a major impact on how we understand truth, reality, and events\".\n\nIn an interview with Jon Ronson for \"The Guardian\", Syed's mother Shamim and younger brother Yusuf both said they listened to the podcast and that people sent transcripts to Syed in prison. Yusuf said the podcast had indirectly reconnected the family to his estranged brother Tanveer for the first time in the 15 years since the murder.\n\nThree \"update\" mini-episodes of \"Serial\" were posted during Syed's post conviction hearing in February 2016, coinciding with the run of Season 2. They received limited attention from critics, although Slate's review notably described them as \"ragged, chaotic entries [which] can’t help but hit us as shadows of what was.\"\n\nThe much-anticipated second season of \"Serial\" was released in December 2015. The subject of Season 2 was met with widespread skepticism. Vastly different from the popular murder-mystery story that Season 1 investigated, Season 2's focus on the story behind the U.S. soldier Bowe Bergdahl, who disappeared from his post in Afghanistan in 2009 before being captured by the Taliban and subsequently released in 2014, was contentious due in part to the controversial views of the soldier's departure from his post and also because of the high-profile court martial proceeding for his alleged desertion.\n\n\"The Guardian\" summarized the season by saying Koenig and her team managed to add to the conversation: \"Not only did they let Bergdahl speak for himself, via a series of interviews with the film-maker Mark Boal, but they also asked and answered a question that no one – including the military or the US government – had seemingly bothered to investigate.\"\nSeason 2 of \"Serial\" was less about solving a mystery and more about long-term investigative reporting and storytelling. Zach Baron of \"GQ Magazine\" reported that he liked the season overall and thought it gave an invaluable document of what it is like to serve in modern wars, but said it was also \"something of a cultural disappointment, at least compared to last season.\"\n\nSimilar to Season 1's critical response, some felt that the lack of answers was \"infuriating.\"\n\nSwitching to a bi-weekly schedule mid-season caused some to believe the series was losing momentum. However, in an interview with \"Entertainment Weekly\", Sarah Koenig and executive producer Julie Snyder said the download numbers for Season 2 were 50 million, higher than the numbers were by the time Season 1 ended.\n\nSeason 3 received mostly positive reviews. Andrew Liptak at The Verge called it a \"return to form\". Nicholas Quah at Vulture called it \"ambitious, addictive, and completely different\".\n\nThe popularity of \"Serial\" and the intrigue of the case it covered has spawned several companion podcasts, such as \"Crime Writers on\" Serial, \"The \"Serial\" Serial\", and \"Undisclosed: The State vs. Adnan Syed\", the latter produced by Rabia Chaudry. S-Town, a 2017 collaboration between the teams of \"This American Life\" and \"Serial\", has also received widespread acclaim.\n\nParodies of \"Serial\" have targeted the show's style, its fans' obsessive tendencies, Koenig's curiosity and uncertainties, the charts and graphics posted on the show's website, and the podcast's sponsor MailChimp (especially the meme \"MailKimp\").\n\n"}

Typically a song is played, and the performer expressively performs a sign language version of the lyrics. Whereas singing uses pitch, tone, and emotions to convey expressions, sign singing relies on the performer's hands, body, and facial expressions.\n\nChoirs can perform sign singing and have gathered popularity in recent years as accessibility for the Deaf community and interest in signing languages have risen. Competitions in which sign choirs can compete include the National Singing Choir Competition in the UK.\n\nWell-known sign singers include the Japanese Tomoko Nakayama, a follower of Nichiren Buddhism, and the bawdy Australian duo Dislabelled. In London in 2003, a series of \"Deaf Idol\" events were held where deaf participants competed in karaoke singing, dance etc., in a similar format to the TV show Pop Idol.\nSign language can be used to express extremely nuanced feeling, and so sign singing is an important creative input for the deaf.\n\nSign singing is featured in the movie \"Napoleon Dynamite\" during a scene when two members of the \"happy hands club\" perform a song titled \"The Rose\" written by Bette Midler, entirely in sign. The signing club depicted in the film was largely inspired by a sign singing club that was previously established at Preston High School (Idaho), where the movie was filmed. The film brought wider attention to the club, originally called the \"Good hands club,\" which was founded by educator Dan Robertson, who conceived the idea for the group while studying ASL at Brigham Young University. In 2013 the troupe performed on stages at Disneyland, in the Tabernacle in Salt Lake City with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and flew to Orlando for the convention of a large corporation.\n\nA sign language interpretation by the late Kimberly Rae Schaefer during Pearl Jam's 2000 tour for \"Given to Fly\" garnered public attention for the passionate and emotional signing.\n\nThe \"National Anthem\" was sung and signed in British Sign Language at the Opening Ceremony of the 2012 Olympics\nby The Kaos Signing Choir for Deaf and Hearing Children. \n\nThe 2015 Broadway musical theater production of \"Spring Awakening\" integrated American sign language within the choreography of dance moves, while also utilizing a mixture of hearing and deaf performers. \n\nYouTube has become a popular medium for amateur and professional sign singers to share their work; see videos under keywords \n\n"}
{"id": "25837700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25837700", "title": "Soviet Central Television", "text": "Soviet Central Television\n\nThe Central Television of the USSR (; abbr. CT USSR <nowiki>[</nowiki><nowiki>]</nowiki>) was the state television broadcaster of the Soviet Union.\n\nSoviet TV programming was highly diverse and somewhat similar to that of the BBC or American PBS. Like much of the Soviet media, CT USSR regularly promoted the agendas of the Communist Party. Initially, the service was operated, together with the national radio service, by the Ministry of Culture. Later it was operated by the Gosteleradio committee, under the Communications Ministry and the Information and Press Ministry, and later a Council of Ministers-controlled network of television and radio broadcasting.\n\nRadio was the dominant medium in the former Soviet Union, however, in the 1930s preparations for television were in full swing.\n\nOn 1 October 1934, the first television sets were made available to the public. The next year, the first television broadcasts began.\n\nThe Soviet Union television service began full-time experimental test broadcasts on 1 March 1938.\n\nRegular public programming began on 9 March 1938 - with an evening of programmes, which included news, documentary films and entertainment on Channel 1 in Moscow. At the same time, Channel 5 Leningrad, the national television service from Leningrad and the northern Soviet Union, was launched on 7 July the same year.\n\nProgrammes were stopped in 1941 at the start of Operation Barbarossa, for fear that the Shabolovka transmitter would be used as an enemy beacon. The same thing happened in Leningrad due to the almost 4 years siege there in the city.\n\nThe USSR television service began experimental test broadcasts on 7 May 1945 (two days before the German surrender), in preparation for its full reopening.\n\nRegular public programming resumed on 7 March 1948.\n\nThe USSR television service temporarily stopped broadcasts in December 1948 for major upgrade of the broadcast equipment, but by 1 May the next year, Leningrad and the northern/northwestern USSR resumed television broadcasts for the Palace Square May Day Parade.\n\nRegular programming resumed on 16 June 1949, but was now broadcasting in 625 lines - a first in the world.\n\nOn 22 March 1951, the Moscow TV station was renamed, to avoid confusion by viewers about the forthcoming local channels, becoming the Central Television Station, later known as Programme 1. Leningrad's television service was also renamed into Leningrad Television, and continued its national broadcasts.\n\nOn 26 August 1952, the Leningrad Television Centre was inaugurated, the USSR's first state-of-the-art television studios.\n\nOn New Year's Day 1955 the Central Television Station began transmitting daily programming.\n\nOn 14 February 1956, the new Moscow Programme commenced broadcasting for viewers in Moscow and in the surrounding Moscow Oblast.\n\nThe USSR television service (both Programme 1 and Moscow Programme 2) began experimental colour broadcast tests on 14 January 1960.\n\nThe next year, Leningrad Television moved its studios and officers to larger premises.\n\nThe USSR authorities began construction of a television center in Ostankino in 1963 for the television networks. It was opened in 1967 as part of the celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. Leningrad would soon follow suit the next year as the newly renovated and expanded Leningrad Television Broadcasting Center reopened its doors.\n\nOn 1 September 1964, CT USSR Programme One launched Spokoynoy nochi, malyshi! (Good Night, Kids!) as an answer to the East German Sandmännchen. The idea was an animated film and then sending them to bed before the programmes for adults began at 21:00 (with the main evening news Vremya). With several generations of children growing up with the show, it has remained a popular childhood memory. Russia 1 still continues this practice today.\n\nOn 29 March 1965, Programme Three commenced broadcasting. It was originally an educational channel. This channel was shown only in the major cities in the European USSR (e.g. Moscow and Leningrad), and its programming was co-produced with the USSR Ministry of Education, oriented towards the nation's student population at all levels from pre-school till college.\n\nIn 1965, CT USSR established a satellite network to expand the television service nationwide.\n\nIn 1967, the all-new, youth, sport and entertainment network Programme 4 was launched. Programme 3, which was from the beginning available to Moscow only, began broadcasting to the entire USSR via satellite in 1982. Thus, it was renamed All-Union Programme for this purpose and moved to channel 2 in 1977, while Moscow Programme switched to channel 3. Science and technology programming formerly on Programme 4 moved to Programme 6 when that channel was launched on 25 December 1971.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotable annual traditions of the Soviet Central Television network included the telecasts of the Red Square demonstrations on May Day, Victory Day and the October Revolution anniversary parades, and the broadcast of the film The Irony of Fate (Or Enjoy Your Bath!) on New Year's Eve night, right before the CPSU General Secretary's New Year message, followed by the Kremlin chimes and the playing of Soviet national anthem, and ending with Little Blue Light New Year's Edition. Concerts and musical programs also commemorated these and other national holidays. Since 1971 it was also the official network for the USSR's Pesnya goda All-Union National Soviet Music Festival aired on New Year's Day, also soon becoming a holiday practice for viewers across the nation.\n\nColour television was introduced on 1 October 1967, making the Soviet Union the fourth country in Europe to switch to colour broadcast, after the United Kingdom's BBC2, West Germany and France (see Timeline of the introduction of color television in countries), again ready for the celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution on 7 November 1967. Moscow Programme and Leningrad Television were the first colour broadcasters, even through the 7 November 1967 parade was broadcast in monochrome in the main national channels and Programme 4. CT USSR chose the French SÉCAM colour standard, which would later be adopted across the Eastern Bloc (Romania and Yugoslavia, however, settled for the PAL standard).\n\nBy 1976, full colour broadcasts began throughout the entire Soviet Union using the SECAM format on all television programs broadcast on all the national channels: Programme One, Programme Two, Moscow Programme, Programme Four and Programme Five - Leningrad Television, and in all the republican networks.\n\nThe hosting of the 1980 Summer Olympics by Moscow was a source of pride for the Eastern Bloc. However, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 had caused outrage in the west, leading to a boycott of the games by 64 western-aligned nations. CT USSR, as the host nation broadcaster, presented a colour broadcast of the Games to the world, and in Soviet territory the Games were broadcast on the two main channels with additional coverage on Program 3, Program 4 and Leningrad Television as well as the republican channels in Belarus, Ukraine (football) and Estonia (sailing). The other republican stations also simulcast and highlighted the entire event.\n\nIn 1988, the USSR-built Gorizont satellite was launched, providing television programming to much of Europe and northern Africa, and even eastern parts of the Americas. The programmes of all the Eastern European socialist republics, including the CT USSR channels, were broadcast on the satellite.\n\nSignificant changes to CT USSR were made in the 1980s as the USSR underwent economic and popular political changes brought about by the reforms in Moscow under Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nAt first, CT USSR stuck to the party line and barely reported the opposition to the communist regime. However, after the rule of the CPSU began to break down in 1990, CT USSR reformed their programmes to remove propaganda and to report news freely.\n\nBy the time the Glasnost came into effect, the main news programme on the then Programme 1 (Vremya) was being produced without censorship or interference, and so it covered the events in full. In recognition of its reliable coverage, the programme was re-broadcast on several TV channels around the world (such as Australia's SBS and the United Kingdom's Sky News).\n\nCT USSR, at the same time, started a number of new programme strands and formats, including talk shows.\n\nOn 4 March 1988, emphasizing the Glasnost campaign, Programme 3 and Programme 4, plus Leningrad Television began to be carried across the Soviet territory via satellite.\n\nPrivate TV channels such as ATV and 2×2 were also introduced ending the state monopoly on television broadcasting. By 1990, CTV-USSR debuted its first joint international partnership program with the American Broadcasting Company, entitled \"Capital to Capital\".\n\nUpon the total dissolution of the country on 25 December 1991, Soviet Central Television (by now part of the \"All-Union National Radio and Television Broadcasting Corporation\" due to a 1990 reform) ceased to be the state broadcaster of the former USSR.\n\nOn 27 December 1991, Ostankino Television 1 and Ostankino Television 4 (Presently Channel One (Russia) and NTV (Russia)) took over the frequencies of Programme 1 and Programme 4. Leningrad Television 5 soon became St. Petersburg State Television Network, broadcasting to all of Russia until 1997.\n\nEmployees of CT USSR were worried about job prospects in the new broadcaster and also had a loyalty to Soviet Central Television. Viewers accustomed to the Russian programming, were concerned at the loss of favourite shows. (Some of the Soviet Central Television shows are now consigned to Channel One Russia and Russia 1) Additionally the three big Russian channels - Channel One, Russia 1 and Petersburg-Channel 5 - have a good amount of presence in the former Soviet territory, and most of the republican stations are now fully independent.\n\nSoviet Central Television had three and later six television channels over its history.\n\nCentral Television USSR signed off for the final time on 27 December 1991 and became Ostankino Television Channel 1 and Ostankino Television Channel 4, of Ostankino State Television. Its two remaining channels carried former their predecessors' programming. The direct successor of Soviet Central Television in Russia, it became defunct on 30 November 1994, becoming the Channel One Russia of today (It was then called until 2002 as ORT 1-Public Russian Television Channel 1.)\n\nThere are 3 idents which were broadcast in a day during CT USSR.\n\nThere was only one CT USSR logo, which had five rings from a red star-designed antenna in it.\n\nSoviet Central Television (Programme One, Programme Two and Moscow Programme) sign on at 08:00 morning with the test card along with music, clock ident, then the national anthem accompanied by a panoramic view of Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union and station ident.\n\nSoviet Central Television (Programme One, Programme Two and Moscow Programme) sign on at 16:00 evening with the test card along with music, clock ident, then the national anthem accompanied by a panoramic view of Moscow and station ident.\n\nSoviet Central Television (Programme One, Programme Two and Moscow Programme) sign off at 13:00 day with the station ident, Clock ident, caption Do not forget to turn off the TV accompanied by intermittent beeping and test card.\n\nSoviet Central Television (Programme One, Programme Two and Moscow Programme) sign off at 23:00 evening with the station ident, Clock ident, caption Do not forget to turn off the TV accompanied by intermittent beeping and test card.\n\n\nThere was only one clock broadcast.\n\nThe UEIT test card was used.\n\nWhen colour television was introduced in 1967, the SÉCAM system was chosen. Following the collapse of the USSR, some of its former republics switched to the PAL colour system.\n\nBroadcasting in the USSR was heavily subsidized by the state.\n\nAdvertising - in the form of \"commercial\" magazine programmes - appeared on Soviet television from the 1980s. However, the command economy had little or no competition between brands, so advertising was limited to informing viewers of the prices and availability of products.\n\nWith perestroika, spot advertising was introduced to CT USSR in order to better cover the system's cost.\n\nThe satirical TV series \"SCTV\" did a 1980 episode consisting of skits centered around a Russian satellite colliding with the SCTV satellite and causing Russian TV to be broadcast on SCTV's signal, with Soviet Central Television satirized as '3CCCP1' (\"Three CP One\") and '3CCCP2' ('Three CP Two') and containing further satires of Russian programing with shows like \"Tibor's Tractor\" (a farmer has a tractor that is the reincarnation of Khrushchev, spoofing \"My Mother The Car\") \"Hey Georgy\" (a man wanders around Russia helping everybody), and a daytime show, \"Today is Moscow\". The episode is featured on \"SCTV\" DVD Volume 2.\n\n"}
{"id": "59211511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59211511", "title": "Terminal investment hypothesis", "text": "Terminal investment hypothesis\n\nThe terminal investment hypothesis is the idea in life history theory that as an organism's residual reproductive value (or the total reproductive value minus the reproductive value of the current breeding attempt) decreases, its reproductive effort will increase. Thus, as an organism's prospects for survival decreases (through age or an immune challenge, for example), it will invest more in reproduction. This hypothesis is generally supported in animals, although results contrary to it do exist.\n\nThe terminal investment hypothesis posits that as residual reproductive value (measured as the total reproductive value minus the reproductive value of the current breeding attempt) decreases, reproductive effort increases. This is based off of the cost of reproduction hypothesis, which says that an increase in resources dedicated to current reproduction decreases the potential for future reproduction. But, as the residual reproductive value decreases, the importance of this trade-off decreases, leading to increased investment in the current reproductive attempt. This terminal investment hypothesis can be illustrated by the equation\n\nformula_1,\n\nwhere formula_2 is the total reproductive value, formula_3 the reproductive value of the current breeding attempt, formula_4 the proportionate increase in formula_3 resulting from a positive decision (where a \"yes-no\" decision must be made regarding whether or not to increase reproductive effort), formula_6 the cost of a positive decision where there is no selective pressure for either a positive decision or negative decision (this variable is also known as the \"barely-justified cost\"). The variable formula_7 is the proportionate loss in formula_3 from a negative decision. The barely-justified cost is thus inversely proportional to the residual reproductive value. When the level of reproductive investment has not reached the point where the equation above is true, more positive decisions about reproductive effort will be made. Thus, as the residual reproductive value decreases, more positive decisions need to be made so the equation is equal.\nIn animals, most tests of the terminal investment hypothesis are correlations of age and reproductive effort, immune challenges on all age stages, and immune challenges on older ages versus younger ages. The last type of test is considered to be a more reliable measure of senescence's effect on reproductive effort, as younger individuals should reduce reproductive effort to reduce the change of death because of their high future reproductive prospects, while older animals should increase effort because of their low future prospects. Overall, the terminal investment hypothesis is generally supported in a variety of animals.\nA study on blue tits published in 2000 found that individuals injected with a human diphtheria–tetanus vaccine fed their nestlings less than those injected with a control solution. In a study published in 2004, house sparrows that were injected with a Newcastle disease vaccine were more likely to lay a replacement clutch after their first clutch had been artificially removed than those that were injected with a control solution. In a study published in 2006, old blue-footed boobies injected with lipopolysaccharides (to challenge the immune system) before laying fledged more young than normal, whereas young individuals fledged less than normal. An increase in maternal effort in immune challenged birds may be mediated by the hormone corticosterone; a study published in 2015 found that house wrens injected with lipopolysaccharides increased foraging, and that measurements of corticosterone from eggs laid after injection found a positive correlation of this hormone with maternal foraging rates.\n\nA study published in 2009 supported the cost of reproduction and terminal investment hypotheses in the burying beetle. It found that beetles manipulated to overproduce young (by replacing a mouse carcass with a carcass) had shorter lifespans than those that bred on just carcasses, followed by those that had a carcass. In turn, non-breeding beetles had a significantly longer lifespan than those that bred. This supports the cost of reproduction hypothesis. Another experiment from the same study found beetles that first bred at 65 days had a larger brood size before dispersal (before the larvae start to pupate in the soil) than those that initially bred at 28 days. This supports the terminal investment hypothesis, and prevents the effect of an increased average brood size in older animals due to differential survival of quality individuals.\n\nA study published in 2004 on the flatworm \"Diplostomum spathaceum\"' found that as its intermediate host, a snail, aged, production of cercariae (which are passed on to the final host, a fish) decreased. This is in line with the bet hedging hypothesis, which, in this case, says that the flatworm should attempt to keep its host alive longer so that more young can be produced; it does not support the terminal investment hypothesis.\n\nA study published in 2002 found results contrary to the terminal investment hypothesis in reindeer. Calf weight peaked at the mother's seventh year of age, and declined thereafter. However, this would only be opposed to the hypothesis if reproductive costs did not increase with age. An alternative hypothesis, the senescence hypothesis, positing that reproductive output declines with age-related loss of function, was supported by the study. These two hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive; a study on rhesus macaques published in 2010 strongly supported the senescence hypothesis and weakly supported the terminal investment hypothesis. It found that older mothers were lighter, less active, and had lighter infants with reduced survival rates compared to younger mothers (supporting the senescence hypothesis), older individuals spent more time in contact with their young (supporting the senescence hypothesis). Additionally, a study published in 1982 on red deer on the island of Rhum found that while older mothers produced less offspring (and lighter offspring, when they did) than expected for a given body weight, they had longer suckling bouts (which had previously been correlated with milk yield, calf body condition in early winter, and calf survival to spring) compared to younger mothers.\n\nA study on spotted turtles published in 2008 found that individuals in very poor condition sometimes did not breed. This is consistent with the bet hedging hypothesis, and indicates decision making on a large temporal scale (as spotted turtles may live for 65 to 110 years. However, individuals in poor condition generally produced a relatively large amount of small eggs; consistent with the terminal investment hypothesis.\n\nAlthough the terminal investment hypothesis has been relatively widely studied in animals, there have been few studies of the hypothesis' application to plants. One study on members of the long-lived oak genus \"Quercus\" found that trees declined in condition towards the end of their lifespan, and did not invest an increasing proportion of their decreasing resources in reproduction.\n"}

It was released theatrically as \"The Face\" in the United Kingdom, although video releases have used the U.S. title \"The Magician\".\n\nThe film stars Max von Sydow as a traveling magician named Albert Vogler. Reading reports of a variety of supernatural disturbances at Vogler's prior performances abroad, the leading townspeople request that Vogler's troupe provide them a sample of their act, before allowing them public audiences. The scientifically minded disbelievers try to expose them as charlatans, but Vogler has a few tricks up his sleeve.\n\nThe film was distantly inspired by G. K. Chesterton's play \"Magic\", which Bergman numbered among his favourites. Bergman staged a theatre production of \"Magic\" in Swedish at one point. The film was selected as the Swedish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 31st Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.\n\n\"The Magician\" has a unanimous approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Don Druker of the \"Chicago Reader\" called it \"one of Bergman's most tightly structured and frightening films.\"\nAuthor and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film three out of four stars, calling it \"A thoughtful (and too-long underrated) portrait of a man who is part-faker, part-genius.\"\n\nWoody Allen selected \"The Magician\" as one of the five Bergman films that he would most recommend to those unfamiliar with the filmmaker.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "497868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=497868", "title": "Triad (music)", "text": "Triad (music)\n\nIn music, a triad is a set of three notes (or \"pitch classes\") that can be stacked vertically in thirds. The term \"harmonic triad\" was coined by Johannes Lippius in his \"Synopsis musicae novae\" (1612).\n\nWhen stacked in thirds, notes produce triads. The triad's members, from lowest-pitched tone to highest, are called:\n\n\nSome twentieth-century theorists, notably Howard Hanson and Carlton Gamer, expand the term to refer to any combination of three different pitches, regardless of the intervals amongst them. The word used by other theorists for this more general concept is \"triad\". Others, notably Allen Forte, use the term to refer to combinations apparently stacked of other intervals, as in \"quartal triad\".\n\nIn the late Renaissance music era, and especially during the Baroque music era (1600–1750), Western art music shifted from a more \"horizontal\" contrapuntal approach (in which multiple, independent melody lines were interwoven) toward progressions, which are sequences of triads. The progression approach, which was the foundation of the Baroque-era basso continuo accompaniment, required a more \"vertical\" approach, thus relying more heavily on the triad as the basic building block of functional harmony.\n\nThe root tone of a triad, together with the degree of the scale to which it corresponds, primarily determine a given triad's function. Secondarily, a triad's function is determined by its quality: major, minor, diminished or augmented. Major and minor triads are the most commonly used triad qualities in Western classical, popular and traditional music. In standard tonal music, only major and minor triads can be used as a tonic in a song or some other piece of music. That is, a song or other vocal or instrumental piece can be in the key of C major or A minor, but a song or some other piece cannot be in the key of B diminished or F augmented (although songs or other pieces might include these triads within the triad progression, typically in a temporary, passing role). Three of these four kinds of triads are found in the major (or diatonic) scale. In popular music and 18th-century classical music, major and minor triads are considered to be consonant and stable, and diminished and augmented triads are considered to be dissonant and unstable.\n\nTriads (or any other tertian triads) are built by superimposing \"every other\" note of a diatonic scale (e.g., standard major or minor scale). For example, a C major triad uses the notes C–E–G. This spells a triad by \"skipping over\" D and F. While the interval from each note to the one above it is a third, the quality of those thirds varies depending on the quality of the triad:\n\nThe above definitions spell out the interval of each note above the root. Since triads are constructed of stacked thirds, they can be alternatively defined as follows:\n\nEach triad found in a diatonic (single-scale-based) key corresponds to a particular diatonic function. Functional harmony tends to rely heavily on the primary triads: triads built on the tonic, subdominant (typically the ii or IV triad), and dominant (typically the V triad) degrees. The roots of these triads begin on the first, fourth, and fifth degrees (respectively) of the diatonic scale, otherwise symbolized: I, IV, and V (respectively). Primary triads, \"express function clearly and unambiguously.\" The other triads of the diatonic key include the supertonic, mediant, submediant, and subtonic, whose roots begin on the second, third, sixth, and seventh degrees (respectively) of the diatonic scale, otherwise symbolized: ii, iii, vi, and vii (respectively). They function as auxiliary or supportive triads to the primary triads.\n\n\n"}
