{"id": "3762055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3762055", "title": "Billy Whitlock", "text": "Billy Whitlock\n\nWilliam M. \"Billy\" Whitlock (1813–1878) was an American blackface performer. He began his career in entertainment doing blackface banjo routines in circuses and dime shows, and by 1843, he was well known in New York City. He is best known for his role in forming the original minstrel troupe, the Virginia Minstrels.\n\nWhitlock was born in New York City in 1813. He worked as a typesetter for a religious journal, then went to work for the \"New York Herald\". Whitlock claimed to have met America's pre-eminent banjoist, Joel Sweeney, in 1838 and to have taken some banjo lessons from him. He joined P. T. Barnum's circus in 1839, where he began his blackface act.\n\nBy 1840, Whitlock was performing circuses, museums, and variety shows and had taken the epithet \"King of Banjo players, and the Emperor of Extravaganza Singers\". He paired with John Diamond for a time, playing banjo and singing while Diamond danced. Frank Lynch eventually replaced Diamond, though he took \"Frank Diamond\" as his stage name. Whitlock also partnered with Dan Gardner, who would dress in drag as Whitlock's character \"Sambo Squash\" made romantic overtures.\n\nThis playbill, written in the stereotyped African American Vernacular English that characterized blackface entertainment, describes Whitlock's basic act:\n\nNow dat Massa Whitlock plays so partic'lar combustious, and will sing dat 'fecting song of Jinny git your Hoe Cake done! and dat first rate ballad of Jim Along Josey! defying all de niggers in de world to charm de people after dat same manner. Dis very partic'lar nigga will jump, dance, and knock his heels in a way dat Mademoiselle Fanny Elssler neber did, neber can and neber will do.\n\nMany years later, Whitlock claimed that his Negro impersonations were based on reality. He would \"quietly steal off to some negro hut to hear the darkeys sing and see them dance, taking with him a jug of whiskey to make them all the merrier.\"\n\nIn early 1843, Whitlock became one of the founding members of the Virginia Minstrels. Whitlock's version of the group's founding holds that Whitlock asked fiddler Dan Emmett to practice with him. They did so on a few occasions, but during one such session, Frank Brower dropped by unannounced and decided to join in on bones. Richard Pelham soon followed with his tambourine.\n\nThe Virginia Minstrels put on a full minstrel show at the New York Bowery Amphitheatre on 6 February 1843. Whitlock was the most famous of the foursome, but soon all four names became well known as they toured New York and Boston. Whitlock's banjo was long-necked and four-stringed, though a fifth was added by 1844. He played the instrument by striking the strings with his fingernail. Whitlock also did a \"Locomotive Lecture\", a predecessor to the stump speech, wherein he feigned a complete lack of knowledge about steam engines and the railroad. Whitlock wrote some music, as well; his \"Miss Lucy Long\" became a hit for both the Virginia Minstrels and Christy's Minstrels.\n\nWhitlock and the troupe left for Liverpool, England, on 21 April. They performed several minstrel shows in the British Isles, but they broke up after a performance on 14 July 1843, possibly due to low profits. Whitlock returned to New York City with the group's manager, George Wooldridge.\n\nBack in America, Whitlock returned to his circus blackface act. For a time, he joined T. G. Booth, Cool White, and Barney Williams as a member of the Kentucky Minstrels.\n\nOn 28 July 1845, Whitlock joined Emmett, Jerry Bryant, Dan Gardner, and Charles White to form the Operatic Brothers and Sisters. The group put on a week of outdoor performances in Hoboken, New Jersey. On 23 October, he performed at a benefit along with Emmett, Gardner, and other prominent blackface entertainers. His last public blackface performance was at a circus in 1855.\n\n"}

Since 1997, Burn the Floor has performed in over 130 countries worldwide. The show has also featured several alumni of various international versions of \"Dancing with the Stars\" and \"So You Think You Can Dance\".\n\nIn 1997, Elton John's 50th birthday party included a 10-minute performance from a group of ballroom dancers. The birthday party is credited with starting the idea for Burn the Floor. Following John's party, Australian producer Harley Medcalf spent two years developing the idea. Medcalf brought a showcase of ballroom dance to an Elton John Aids fundraiser two years later. Among the talent Medcalf recruited for his stage show included a choreographer, Anthony Van Laast, and Australian ballroom dancers Jason Gilkison and Peta Roby. By 2000, the show played a two night stint at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. The New York Times said of the production, \"Look past the show's brassy facade, with its rock-show production values and attitude (mock ecstasy is the usual facial expression), and there is some complex footwork in what is essentially a suite of deliberately souped-up social dances.\"\n\nIn 2001, Jason Gilkison took over the role of choreographer. By 2005, an Australian workshop of the show was named \"Jason Gilkison's Ballroom.\"\nThrough the course of several tours, the production tinkered with what worked. Growing into a large production requiring seven vehicles to move from city to city, the tour's creative team began to realize that they preferred the show more stripped down and focused on the dancers. According to Gilkison, \n“The goal was to streamline it, make it more theatrical, reinvent it with the help of the dancers, who had their own ideas of how to make it more contemporary.\"\n\nBefore the show hit Broadway, it had already been performed in 29 countries.\n\nBurn the Floor performed its first preview show on Broadway on July 25, 2009 at the Longacre Theatre. The show opened on August 2, 2009 after eight preview performances. Maksim Chmerkovskiy and Karina Smirnoff, known for appearing on the U.S. television series \"Dancing with the Stars\", were announced as special guest stars for the first three weeks of performances. At the time, Chmerkovskiy and Smirnoff were a couple off stage as well. Gilkison, who had known Chmerkovskiy since 1990, mentioned to Chmerkovskiy before taking the show to Broadway that he was looking for more female dancers. Chmerkovskiy was a fan of the stage show and suggested he join the cast with Smirnoff.\n\nFollowing the departure of Chmerkovskiy and Smirnoff, Anya Garnis and Pasha Kovalev, then known for competing on the U.S. version of \"So You Think You Can Dance\", took over the roles of featured dancers. Ticket sales decreased following the departure of Chmerkovskiy and Smirnoff. Shortly after their stint in Burn the Floor, Chmerkovskiy and Smirnoff ended their romantic relationship including their engagement. Chmerkovskiy agreed to return to the show in November 2009, but he stated he would not perform with Smirnoff. Instead, Chmerkovskiy returned partnered with another \"Dancing with the Stars\" pro, Kym Johnson.\n\nThe broadway run ended on January 10, 2010. The show had made plans to continue into February, however, those plans were scrapped.\n\nThe opening night cast including the following dancers:\n\n\nVocalists:\n\n\nThroughout the Broadway run, the following dancers joined the cast:\n\n\nIn 2010, Burn the Floor performed a limited engagement at the Shaftesbury Theatre on London's West End. Featured guest stars for the 2010 run included Ali Bastian, a competitor on \"Strictly Come Dancing\", and her pro partner from Strictly, Brian Fortuna. The show was scheduled to run from July 21-September 5, 2010.\n\nThe show returned to the Shaftesbury Theatre in 2013, this time with Robin Windsor and Kristina Rihanoff, pro dancers from \"Strictly Come Dancing\", in the roles of featured guest stars. The 2013 run began on March 6, 2013 and closed on June 30, 2013, although it was originally scheduled to run through September 1.\n\nFollowing closing on Broadway, the show embarked on a 2010 world tour, which included 30 cities in the United States.\n\nA new production, \"Burn the Floor – Fire in the Ballroom\", choreographed and directed by Peta Roby, debuted in 2016 at the Regal Theatre in Perth, Australia. In contrast to previous productions, \"Fire in the Ballroom\" incorporated more rock and roll with the intention of appealing more the male audiences. The production's Perth run was scheduled for March 23 through April 3, 2016. In April 2016 the production had scheduled engagements in South Africa, including stops in Pretoria, Cape Town, and Durban.\n\n\"Burn the Floor\" returned to London with the production \"Fire in the Ballroom\" for a limited run, from 18 October to 5 November 2016.\n\nOther notable alumni of Burn the Floor include:\n\n\nAs of 2013, Burn the Floor began giving performances on Norwegian Cruise ships.\n\n"}

Under the management of his son Joseph and grandson Alfred the company moved to the suburb of Harborne, in the valley of a stream called the Chad Brook, giving its name to the Chad Valley district, from which the company name is derived.\n\nChad Valley made a decision to expand their range to soft toys before World War I. They mass-produced their new Teddy bears in Harborne\n\nIn 1938 the company received a royal warrant as 'Toymakers to H.M. The Queen'. When Princess Elizabeth acceded to the throne in 1952 the warrant was changed to read 'Toymakers to H.M. Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother'.\n\nThe company moved away from manufacturing toys in the Second World War. Instead they produced goods to help the war effort such as wooden instrument cases, cases for the barrels of anti-aircraft guns, hospital beds and electrical coils and starters.\n\nIn 1945 the company resumed toy production. Tin plate toys were produced for the first time although manufacture was outsourced to Metal Box Ltd, a company with the skills and machinery needed to produce printed toys. This new tin plate range was such a success that in 1946 the company moved production in-house. They purchased the Birmingham metalworking company AS Cartwright Ltd to cut and fold metal, Winfield Ltd to produce clockwork mechanisms and Barronia Metals Ltd and True to Type Products Ltd to produce precision engineering equipment.\n\nThe radio broadcaster Kenneth Horne was Chairman and Managing Director of the company from 1956 to 1958.\n\nThe company was one of the UK's leading toymakers for most of the 20th century, by 1960 it was operating seven factories and employing over 1,000 people. In the 1970s however it closed several factories and cuts were made in staffing and production, 1975 saw only two factories remaining. The company was taken over by Palitoy in 1978.\n\nThe brand name was bought by Woolworths in 1988 and remained in use until that company's closure due to insolvency. Home Retail Group, the parent company of retailers Homebase and Argos, purchased the brand for £5 million on 20 January 2009. The Chad Valley brand is now available exclusively at Argos.

{"id": "5142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5142", "title": "Charlie Chaplin", "text": "Charlie Chaplin\n\nSir Charles Spencer Chaplin (16 April 1889 – 25 December 1977) was an English comic actor, filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame in the era of silent film. Chaplin became a worldwide icon through his screen persona \"the Tramp\" and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the film industry. His career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the Victorian era until a year before his death in 1977, and encompassed both adulation and controversy.\n\nChaplin's childhood in London was one of poverty and hardship. As his father was absent and his mother struggled financially, he was sent to a workhouse twice before the age of nine. When he was 14, his mother was committed to a mental asylum. Chaplin began performing at an early age, touring music halls and later working as a stage actor and comedian. At 19, he was signed to the prestigious Fred Karno company, which took him to America. Chaplin was scouted for the film industry and began appearing in 1914 for Keystone Studios. He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large fan base. Chaplin directed his own films from an early stage and continued to hone his craft as he moved to the Essanay, Mutual, and First National corporations. By 1918, he was one of the best-known figures in the world.\n\nIn 1919, Chaplin co-founded the distribution company United Artists, which gave him complete control over his films. His first feature-length was \"The Kid\" (1921), followed by \"A Woman of Paris\" (1923), \"The Gold Rush\" (1925), and \"The Circus\" (1928). He refused to move to sound films in the 1930s, instead producing \"City Lights\" (1931) and \"Modern Times\" (1936) without dialogue. Chaplin became increasingly political, and his next film, \"The Great Dictator\" (1940), satirised Adolf Hitler. The 1940s were a decade marked with controversy for Chaplin, and his popularity declined rapidly. He was accused of communist sympathies, while his involvement in a paternity suit and marriages to much younger women caused scandal. An FBI investigation was opened, and Chaplin was forced to leave the United States and settle in Switzerland. He abandoned the Tramp in his later films, which include \"Monsieur Verdoux\" (1947), \"Limelight\" (1952), \"A King in New York\" (1957), and \"A Countess from Hong Kong\" (1967).\n\nChaplin wrote, directed, produced, edited, starred in, and composed the music for most of his films. He was a perfectionist, and his financial independence enabled him to spend years on the development and production of a picture. His films are characterised by slapstick combined with pathos, typified in the Tramp's struggles against adversity. Many contain social and political themes, as well as autobiographical elements. In 1972, as part of a renewed appreciation for his work, Chaplin received an Honorary Academy Award for \"the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century\". He continues to be held in high regard, with \"The Gold Rush\", \"City Lights\", \"Modern Times\", and \"The Great Dictator\" often ranked on industry lists of the greatest films of all time.\n\nCharles Spencer Chaplin was born on 16 April 1889 to Hannah Chaplin (born Hannah Harriet Pedlingham Hill) and Charles Chaplin Sr. There is no official record of his birth, although Chaplin believed he was born at East Street, Walworth, in South London. His mother and father had married four years previously, at which time Charles Sr. became the legal guardian of Hannah's illegitimate son, Sydney John Hill. At the time of his birth, Chaplin's parents were both music hall entertainers. Hannah, the daughter of a shoemaker, had a brief and unsuccessful career under the stage name Lily Harley, while Charles Sr., a butcher's son, was a popular singer. Although they never divorced, Chaplin's parents were estranged by around 1891. The following year, Hannah gave birth to a third son – George Wheeler Dryden – fathered by the music hall entertainer Leo Dryden. The child was taken by Dryden at six months old, and did not re-enter Chaplin's life for 30 years.\n\nChaplin's childhood was fraught with poverty and hardship, making his eventual trajectory \"the most dramatic of all the rags to riches stories ever told\" according to his authorised biographer David Robinson. Chaplin's early years were spent with his mother and brother Sydney in the London district of Kennington; Hannah had no means of income, other than occasional nursing and dressmaking, and Chaplin Sr. provided no financial support. As the situation deteriorated, Chaplin was sent to Lambeth Workhouse when he was seven years old. The council housed him at the Central London District School for paupers, which Chaplin remembered as \"a forlorn existence\". He was briefly reunited with his mother 18 months later, before Hannah was forced to readmit her family to the workhouse in July 1898. The boys were promptly sent to Norwood Schools, another institution for destitute children.\n\nIn September 1898, Hannah was committed to the 'London County Council Asylum with provision for Croydon,' commonly known as 'Cane Hill Asylum', which was in 1930 renamed Cane Hill Mental Hospital. She had developed psychosis seemingly brought on by an infection of syphilis and malnutrition. For the two months she was there, Chaplin and his brother Sydney were sent to live with their father, whom the young boys scarcely knew. Charles Sr. was by then a severe alcoholic, and life there was bad enough to provoke a visit from the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Chaplin's father died two years later, at 38 years old, from cirrhosis of the liver.\n\nHannah entered a period of remission but, in May 1903, became ill again. Chaplin, then 14, had the task of taking his mother to the infirmary, from where she was sent back to Cane Hill. He lived alone for several days, searching for food and occasionally sleeping rough, until Sydney – who had enrolled in the Navy two years earlier – returned. Hannah was released from the asylum eight months later, but in March 1905, her illness returned, this time permanently. \"There was nothing we could do but accept poor mother's fate\", Chaplin later wrote, and she remained in care until her death in 1928.\n\nBetween his time in the poor schools and his mother succumbing to mental illness, Chaplin began to perform on stage. He later recalled making his first amateur appearance at the age of five years, when he took over from Hannah one night in Aldershot. This was an isolated occurrence, but by the time he was nine Chaplin had, with his mother's encouragement, grown interested in performing. He later wrote: \"[she] imbued me with the feeling that I had some sort of talent\". Through his father's connections, Chaplin became a member of the Eight Lancashire Lads clog-dancing troupe, with whom he toured English music halls throughout 1899 and 1900. Chaplin worked hard, and the act was popular with audiences, but he was not satisfied with dancing and wished to form a comedy act.\n\nIn the years Chaplin was touring with the Eight Lancashire Lads, his mother ensured that he still attended school but, by age 13, he had abandoned education. He supported himself with a range of jobs, while nursing his ambition to become an actor. At 14, shortly after his mother's relapse, he registered with a theatrical agency in London's West End. The manager sensed potential in Chaplin, who was promptly given his first role as a newsboy in Harry Arthur Saintsbury's \"Jim, a Romance of Cockayne\". It opened in July 1903, but the show was unsuccessful and closed after two weeks. Chaplin's comic performance, however, was singled out for praise in many of the reviews.\n\nSaintsbury secured a role for Chaplin in Charles Frohman's production of \"Sherlock Holmes\", where he played Billy the pageboy in three nationwide tours. His performance was so well received that he was called to London to play the role alongside William Gillette, the original Holmes. \"It was like tidings from heaven\", Chaplin recalled. At 16 years old, Chaplin starred in the play's West End production at the Duke of York's Theatre from October to December 1905. He completed one final tour of \"Sherlock Holmes\" in early 1906, before leaving the play after more than two-and-a-half years.\n\nChaplin soon found work with a new company, and went on tour with his brother – who was also pursuing an acting career – in a comedy sketch called \"Repairs\". In May 1906, Chaplin joined the juvenile act \"Casey's Circus\", where he developed popular burlesque pieces and was soon the star of the show. By the time the act finished touring in July 1907, the 18-year-old had become an accomplished comedic performer. He struggled to find more work, however, and a brief attempt at a solo act was a failure.\n\nMeanwhile, Sydney Chaplin had joined Fred Karno's prestigious comedy company in 1906 and, by 1908, he was one of their key performers. In February, he managed to secure a two-week trial for his younger brother. Karno was initially wary, and considered Chaplin a \"pale, puny, sullen-looking youngster\" who \"looked much too shy to do any good in the theatre.\" However, the teenager made an impact on his first night at the London Coliseum and he was quickly signed to a contract. Chaplin began by playing a series of minor parts, eventually progressing to starring roles in 1909. In April 1910, he was given the lead in a new sketch, \"Jimmy the Fearless\". It was a big success, and Chaplin received considerable press attention.\n\nKarno selected his new star to join the section of the company, one that also included Stan Laurel, that toured North America's vaudeville circuit. The young comedian headed the show and impressed reviewers, being described as \"one of the best pantomime artists ever seen here\". His most successful role was a drunk called the \"Inebriate Swell\", which drew him significant recognition. The tour lasted 21 months, and the troupe returned to England in June 1912. Chaplin recalled that he \"had a disquieting feeling of sinking back into a depressing commonplaceness\" and was, therefore, delighted when a new tour began in October.\n\nSix months into the second American tour, Chaplin was invited to join the New York Motion Picture Company. A representative who had seen his performances thought he could replace Fred Mace, a star of their Keystone Studios who intended to leave. Chaplin thought the Keystone comedies \"a crude mélange of rough and rumble\", but liked the idea of working in films and rationalised: \"Besides, it would mean a new life.\" He met with the company and signed a $150-per-week ($ in dollars) contract in September 1913.\n\nChaplin arrived in Los Angeles, home of the Keystone studio, in early December 1913. His boss was Mack Sennett, who initially expressed concern that the 24-year-old looked too young. He was not used in a picture until late January, during which time Chaplin attempted to learn the processes of filmmaking. The one-reeler \"Making a Living\" marked his film acting debut and was released on 2 February 1914. Chaplin strongly disliked the picture, but one review picked him out as \"a comedian of the first water\". For his second appearance in front of the camera, Chaplin selected the costume with which he became identified. He described the process in his autobiography:\n\nThe film was \"Mabel's Strange Predicament\", but \"the Tramp\" character, as it became known, debuted to audiences in \"Kid Auto Races at Venice\" – shot later than \"Mabel's Strange Predicament\" but released two days earlier. Chaplin adopted the character as his screen persona and attempted to make suggestions for the films he appeared in. These ideas were dismissed by his directors. During the filming of his eleventh picture, \"Mabel at the Wheel\", he clashed with director Mabel Normand and was almost released from his contract. Sennett kept him on, however, when he received orders from exhibitors for more Chaplin films. Sennett also allowed Chaplin to direct his next film himself after Chaplin promised to pay $1,500 ($ in dollars) if the film was unsuccessful.\n\n\"Caught in the Rain\", issued 4 May 1914, was Chaplin's directorial debut and was highly successful. Thereafter he directed almost every short film in which he appeared for Keystone, at the rate of approximately one per week, a period which he later remembered as the most exciting time of his career. Chaplin's films introduced a slower form of comedy than the typical Keystone farce, and he developed a large fan base. In November 1914, he had a supporting role in the first feature length comedy film, \"Tillie's Punctured Romance\", directed by Sennett and starring Marie Dressler, which was a commercial success and increased his popularity. When Chaplin's contract came up for renewal at the end of the year, he asked for $1,000 a week ($ in dollars) – an amount Sennett refused as too large.\n\nThe Essanay Film Manufacturing Company of Chicago sent Chaplin an offer of $1,250 a week with a signing bonus of $10,000. He joined the studio in late December 1914, where he began forming a stock company of regular players, including Leo White, Bud Jamison, Paddy McGuire and Billy Armstrong. He soon recruited a leading lady – Edna Purviance, whom Chaplin met in a cafe and hired on account of her beauty. She went on to appear in 35 films with Chaplin over eight years; the pair also formed a romantic relationship that lasted into 1917.\n\nChaplin asserted a high level of control over his pictures and started to put more time and care into each film. There was a month-long interval between the release of his second production, \"A Night Out\", and his third, \"The Champion\". The final seven of Chaplin's 14 Essanay films were all produced at this slower pace. Chaplin also began to alter his screen persona, which had attracted some criticism at Keystone for its \"mean, crude, and brutish\" nature. The character became more gentle and romantic; \"The Tramp\" (April 1915) was considered a particular turning point in his development. The use of pathos was developed further with \"The Bank\", in which Chaplin created a sad ending. Robinson notes that this was an innovation in comedy films, and marked the time when serious critics began to appreciate Chaplin's work. At Essanay, writes film scholar Simon Louvish, Chaplin \"found the themes and the settings that would define the Tramp's world.\"\n\nDuring 1915, Chaplin became a cultural phenomenon. Shops were stocked with Chaplin merchandise, he was featured in cartoons and comic strips, and several songs were written about him. In July, a journalist for \"Motion Picture Magazine\" wrote that \"Chaplinitis\" had spread across America. As his fame grew worldwide, he became the film industry's first international star. When the Essanay contract ended in December 1915, Chaplin – fully aware of his popularity – requested a $150,000 signing bonus from his next studio. He received several offers, including Universal, Fox, and Vitagraph, the best of which came from the Mutual Film Corporation at $10,000 a week.\n\nA contract was negotiated with Mutual that amounted to $670,000 a year ($ million today), which Robinson says made Chaplin – at 26 years old – one of the highest paid people in the world. The high salary shocked the public and was widely reported in the press. John R. Freuler, the studio president, explained: \"We can afford to pay Mr. Chaplin this large sum annually because the public wants Chaplin and will pay for him.\"\n\nMutual gave Chaplin his own Los Angeles studio to work in, which opened in March 1916. He added two key members to his stock company, Albert Austin and Eric Campbell, and produced a series of elaborate two-reelers: \"The Floorwalker\", \"The Fireman\", \"The Vagabond\", \"One A.M.\", and \"The Count\". For \"The Pawnshop\", he recruited the actor Henry Bergman, who was to work with Chaplin for 30 years. \"Behind the Screen\" and \"The Rink\" completed Chaplin's releases for 1916. The Mutual contract stipulated that he release a two-reel film every four weeks, which he had managed to achieve. With the new year, however, Chaplin began to demand more time. He made only four more films for Mutual over the first ten months of 1917: \"Easy Street\", \"The Cure\", \"The Immigrant\", and \"The Adventurer\". With their careful construction, these films are considered by Chaplin scholars to be among his finest work. Later in life, Chaplin referred to his Mutual years as the happiest period of his career. However, Chaplin also felt that those films became increasingly formulaic over the period of the contract and he was increasingly dissatisfied with the working conditions encouraging that.\nChaplin was attacked in the British media for not fighting in the First World War. He defended himself, revealing that he would fight for Britain if called and had registered for the American draft, but he was not summoned by either country. Despite this criticism Chaplin was a favourite with the troops, and his popularity continued to grow worldwide. \"Harper's Weekly\" reported that the name of Charlie Chaplin was \"a part of the common language of almost every country\", and that the Tramp image was \"universally familiar\". In 1917, professional Chaplin imitators were so widespread that he took legal action, and it was reported that nine out of ten men who attended costume parties dressed as the Tramp. The same year, a study by the Boston Society for Psychical Research concluded that Chaplin was \"an American obsession\". The actress Minnie Maddern Fiske wrote that \"a constantly increasing body of cultured, artistic people are beginning to regard the young English buffoon, Charles Chaplin, as an extraordinary artist, as well as a comic genius\".\n\nIn January 1918, Chaplin was visited by leading British singer and comedian Harry Lauder, and the two acted in a short film together.\n\nMutual was patient with Chaplin's decreased rate of output, and the contract ended amicably. With his aforementioned concern about the declining quality of his films because of contract scheduling stipulations, Chaplin's primary concern in finding a new distributor was independence; Sydney Chaplin, then his business manager, told the press, \"Charlie [must] be allowed all the time he needs and all the money for producing [films] the way he wants ... It is quality, not quantity, we are after.\" In June 1917, Chaplin signed to complete eight films for First National Exhibitors' Circuit in return for $1 million ($ million today). He chose to build his own studio, situated on five acres of land off Sunset Boulevard, with production facilities of the highest order. It was completed in January 1918, and Chaplin was given freedom over the making of his pictures.\n\n\"A Dog's Life\", released April 1918, was the first film under the new contract. In it, Chaplin demonstrated his increasing concern with story construction and his treatment of the Tramp as \"a sort of Pierrot\". The film was described by Louis Delluc as \"cinema's first total work of art\". Chaplin then embarked on the Third Liberty Bond campaign, touring the United States for one month to raise money for the Allies of the First World War. He also produced a short propaganda film at his own expense, donated to the government for fund-raising, called \"The Bond\". Chaplin's next release was war-based, placing the Tramp in the trenches for \"Shoulder Arms\". Associates warned him against making a comedy about the war but, as he later recalled: \"Dangerous or not, the idea excited me.\" He spent four months filming the 45-minute-long picture, which was released in October 1918 with great success.\n\nAfter the release of \"Shoulder Arms\", Chaplin requested more money from First National, which was refused. Frustrated with their lack of concern for quality, and worried about rumours of a possible merger between the company and Famous Players-Lasky, Chaplin joined forces with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and D. W. Griffith to form a new distribution company – United Artists, established in January 1919. The arrangement was revolutionary in the film industry, as it enabled the four partners – all creative artists – to personally fund their pictures and have complete control. Chaplin was eager to start with the new company and offered to buy out his contract with First National. They refused and insisted that he complete the final six films owed.\n\nBefore the creation of United Artists, Chaplin married for the first time. The 16-year-old actress Mildred Harris had revealed that she was pregnant with his child, and in September 1918, he married her quietly in Los Angeles to avoid controversy. Soon after, the pregnancy was found to be false. Chaplin was unhappy with the union and, feeling that marriage stunted his creativity, struggled over the production of his film \"Sunnyside\". Harris was by then legitimately pregnant, and on 7 July 1919, gave birth to a son. Norman Spencer Chaplin was born malformed and died three days later. The marriage ended in April 1920, with Chaplin explaining in his autobiography that they were \"irreconcilably mismated\".\n\nLosing the child, plus his own childhood experiences, are thought to have influenced Chaplin's film, which turned the Tramp into the caretaker of a young boy. For this new venture, Chaplin also wished to do more than comedy and, according to Louvish, \"make his mark on a changed world.\" Filming on \"The Kid\" began in August 1919, with four-year-old Jackie Coogan his co-star. \"The Kid\" was in production for nine months until May 1920 and, at 68 minutes, it was Chaplin's longest picture to date. Dealing with issues of poverty and parent–child separation, \"The Kid\" was one of the earliest films to combine comedy and drama. It was released in January 1921 with instant success, and, by 1924, had been screened in over 50 countries.\n\nChaplin spent five months on his next film, the two-reeler \"The Idle Class\". Following its September 1921 release, he chose to return to England for the first time in almost a decade. He then worked to fulfil his First National contract, releasing \"Pay Day\" in February 1922. \"The Pilgrim\" – his final short film – was delayed by distribution disagreements with the studio, and released a year later.\n\nHaving fulfilled his First National contract, Chaplin was free to make his first picture as an independent producer. In November 1922, he began filming \"A Woman of Paris\", a romantic drama about ill-fated lovers. Chaplin intended it to be a star-making vehicle for Edna Purviance, and did not appear in the picture himself other than in a brief, uncredited cameo. He wished the film to have a realistic feel and directed his cast to give restrained performances. In real life, he explained, \"men and women try to hide their emotions rather than seek to express them\". \"A Woman of Paris\" premiered in September 1923 and was acclaimed for its innovative, subtle approach. The public, however, seemed to have little interest in a Chaplin film without Chaplin, and it was a box office disappointment. The filmmaker was hurt by this failure – he had long wanted to produce a dramatic film and was proud of the result – and soon withdrew \"A Woman of Paris\" from circulation.\n\nChaplin returned to comedy for his next project. Setting his standards high, he told himself \"This next film must be an epic! The Greatest!\" Inspired by a photograph of the 1898 Klondike Gold Rush, and later the story of the Donner Party of 1846–47, he made what Geoffrey Macnab calls \"an epic comedy out of grim subject matter.\" In \"The Gold Rush\", the Tramp is a lonely prospector fighting adversity and looking for love. With Georgia Hale as his new leading lady, Chaplin began filming the picture in February 1924. Its elaborate production, costing almost $1 million, included location shooting in the Truckee mountains with 600 extras, extravagant sets, and special effects. The last scene was shot May 1925 after 15 months of filming.\n\nChaplin felt \"The Gold Rush\" was the best film he had made. It opened in August 1925 and became one of the highest-grossing films of the silent era with a U.S. box-office of $5 million. The comedy contains some of Chaplin's most famous sequences, such as the Tramp eating his shoe and the \"Dance of the Rolls\". Macnab has called it \"the quintessential Chaplin film\". Chaplin stated at its release, \"This is the picture that I want to be remembered by\".\n\nWhile making \"The Gold Rush\", Chaplin married for the second time. Mirroring the circumstances of his first union, Lita Grey was a teenage actress, originally set to star in the film, whose surprise announcement of pregnancy forced Chaplin into marriage. She was 16 and he was 35, meaning Chaplin could have been charged with statutory rape under California law. He therefore arranged a discreet marriage in Mexico on 25 November 1924. Their first son, Charles Spencer Chaplin, Jr., was born on 5 May 1925, followed by Sydney Earl Chaplin on 30 March 1926.\n\nIt was an unhappy marriage, and Chaplin spent long hours at the studio to avoid seeing his wife. In November 1926, Grey took the children and left the family home. A bitter divorce followed, in which Grey's application – accusing Chaplin of infidelity, abuse, and of harbouring \"perverted sexual desires\" – was leaked to the press. Chaplin was reported to be in a state of nervous breakdown, as the story became headline news and groups formed across America calling for his films to be banned. Eager to end the case without further scandal, Chaplin's lawyers agreed to a cash settlement of $600,000the largest awarded by American courts at that time. His fan base was strong enough to survive the incident, and it was soon forgotten, but Chaplin was deeply affected by it.\n\nBefore the divorce suit was filed, Chaplin had begun work on a new film, \"The Circus\". He built a story around the idea of walking a tightrope while besieged by monkeys, and turned the Tramp into the accidental star of a circus. Filming was suspended for 10 months while he dealt with the divorce scandal, and it was generally a trouble-ridden production. Finally completed in October 1927, \"The Circus\" was released in January 1928 to a positive reception. At the 1st Academy Awards, Chaplin was given a special trophy \"For versatility and genius in acting, writing, directing and producing \"The Circus\"\". Despite its success, he permanently associated the film with the stress of its production; Chaplin omitted \"The Circus\" from his autobiography, and struggled to work on it when he recorded the score in his later years.\n\nBy the time \"The Circus\" was released, Hollywood had witnessed the introduction of sound films. Chaplin was cynical about this new medium and the technical shortcomings it presented, believing that \"talkies\" lacked the artistry of silent films. He was also hesitant to change the formula that had brought him such success, and feared that giving the Tramp a voice would limit his international appeal. He, therefore, rejected the new Hollywood craze and began work on a new silent film. Chaplin was nonetheless anxious about this decision and remained so throughout the film's production.\n\nWhen filming began at the end of 1928, Chaplin had been working on the story for almost a year. \"City Lights\" followed the Tramp's love for a blind flower girl (played by Virginia Cherrill) and his efforts to raise money for her sight-saving operation. It was a challenging production that lasted 21 months, with Chaplin later confessing that he \"had worked himself into a neurotic state of wanting perfection\". One advantage Chaplin found in sound technology was the opportunity to record a musical score for the film, which he composed himself.\n\nChaplin finished editing \"City Lights\" in December 1930, by which time silent films were an anachronism. A preview before an unsuspecting public audience was not a success, but a showing for the press produced positive reviews. One journalist wrote, \"Nobody in the world but Charlie Chaplin could have done it. He is the only person that has that peculiar something called 'audience appeal' in sufficient quality to defy the popular penchant for movies that talk.\" Given its general release in January 1931, \"City Lights\" proved to be a popular and financial success – eventually grossing over $3 million. The British Film Institute cites it as Chaplin's finest accomplishment, and the critic James Agee hails the closing scene as \"the greatest piece of acting and the highest moment in movies\". \"City Lights\" became Chaplin's personal favourite of his films and remained so throughout his life.\n\n\"City Lights\" had been a success, but Chaplin was unsure if he could make another picture without dialogue. He remained convinced that sound would not work in his films, but was also \"obsessed by a depressing fear of being old-fashioned.\" In this state of uncertainty, early in 1931, the comedian decided to take a holiday and ended up travelling for 16 months. He spent months travelling Western Europe, including extended stays in France and Switzerland, and spontaneously decided to visit Japan. The day after he arrived in Japan, Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated by ultra-nationalists in the May 15 Incident. The group's original plan had been to provoke a war with the United States by assassinating Chaplin at a welcome reception organised by the prime minister, but the plan had been foiled due to delayed public announcement of the event's date.\n\nIn his autobiography, Chaplin recalled that on his return to Los Angeles, \"I was confused and without plan, restless and conscious of an extreme loneliness\". He briefly considered retiring and moving to China. Chaplin's loneliness was relieved when he met 21-year-old actress Paulette Goddard in July 1932, and the pair began a relationship. He was not ready to commit to a film, however, and focused on writing a serial about his travels (published in \"Woman's Home Companion\"). The trip had been a stimulating experience for Chaplin, including meetings with several prominent thinkers, and he became increasingly interested in world affairs. The state of labour in America troubled him, and he feared that capitalism and machinery in the workplace would increase unemployment levels. It was these concerns that stimulated Chaplin to develop his new film.\n\n\"Modern Times\" was announced by Chaplin as \"a satire on certain phases of our industrial life.\" Featuring the Tramp and Goddard as they endure the Great Depression, it took ten and a half months to film. Chaplin intended to use spoken dialogue but changed his mind during rehearsals. Like its predecessor, \"Modern Times\" employed sound effects but almost no speaking. Chaplin's performance of a gibberish song did, however, give the Tramp a voice for the only time on film. After recording the music, Chaplin released \"Modern Times\" in February 1936. It was his first feature in 15 years to adopt political references and social realism, a factor that attracted considerable press coverage despite Chaplin's attempts to downplay the issue. The film earned less at the box-office than his previous features and received mixed reviews, as some viewers disliked the politicising. Today, \"Modern Times\" is seen by the British Film Institute as one of Chaplin's \"great features,\" while David Robinson says it shows the filmmaker at \"his unrivalled peak as a creator of visual comedy.\"\n\nFollowing the release of \"Modern Times\", Chaplin left with Goddard for a trip to the Far East. The couple had refused to comment on the nature of their relationship, and it was not known whether they were married or not. Some time later, Chaplin revealed that they married in Canton during this trip. By 1938, the couple had drifted apart, as both focused heavily on their work, although Goddard was again his leading lady in his next feature film, \"The Great Dictator\". She eventually divorced Chaplin in Mexico in 1942, citing incompatibility and separation for more than a year.\n\nThe 1940s saw Chaplin face a series of controversies, both in his work and in his personal life, which changed his fortunes and severely affected his popularity in the United States. The first of these was his growing boldness in expressing his political beliefs. Deeply disturbed by the surge of militaristic nationalism in 1930s world politics, Chaplin found that he could not keep these issues out of his work. Parallels between himself and Adolf Hitler had been widely noted: the pair were born four days apart, both had risen from poverty to world prominence, and Hitler wore the same toothbrush moustache as Chaplin. It was this physical resemblance that supplied the plot for Chaplin's next film, \"The Great Dictator\", which directly satirised Hitler and attacked fascism.\n\nChaplin spent two years developing the script, and began filming in September 1939 – six days after Britain declared war on Germany. He had submitted to using spoken dialogue, partly out of acceptance that he had no other choice, but also because he recognised it as a better method for delivering a political message. Making a comedy about Hitler was seen as highly controversial, but Chaplin's financial independence allowed him to take the risk. \"I was determined to go ahead,\" he later wrote, \"for Hitler must be laughed at.\" Chaplin replaced the Tramp (while wearing similar attire) with \"A Jewish Barber\", a reference to the Nazi party's belief that he was Jewish. In a dual performance, he also played the dictator \"Adenoid Hynkel\", who parodied Hitler.\n\n\"The Great Dictator\" spent a year in production and was released in October 1940. The film generated a vast amount of publicity, with a critic for \"The New York Times\" calling it \"the most eagerly awaited picture of the year\", and it was one of the biggest money-makers of the era. The ending was unpopular, however, and generated controversy. Chaplin concluded the film with a five-minute speech in which he abandoned his barber character, looked directly into the camera, and pleaded against war and fascism. Charles J. Maland has identified this overt preaching as triggering a decline in Chaplin's popularity, and writes, \"Henceforth, no movie fan would ever be able to separate the dimension of politics from [his] star image\". \"The Great Dictator\" received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor.\n\nIn the mid-1940s, Chaplin was involved in a series of trials that occupied most of his time and significantly affected his public image. The troubles stemmed from his affair with an aspirant actress named Joan Barry, with whom he was involved intermittently between June 1941 and the autumn of 1942. Barry, who displayed obsessive behaviour and was twice arrested after they separated, reappeared the following year and announced that she was pregnant with Chaplin's child. As Chaplin denied the claim, Barry filed a paternity suit against him.\n\nThe director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), J. Edgar Hoover, who had long been suspicious of Chaplin's political leanings, used the opportunity to generate negative publicity about him. As part of a smear campaign to damage Chaplin's image, the FBI named him in four indictments related to the Barry case. Most serious of these was an alleged violation of the Mann Act, which prohibits the transportation of women across state boundaries for sexual purposes. The historian Otto Friedrich has called this an \"absurd prosecution\" of an \"ancient statute\", yet if Chaplin was found guilty, he faced 23 years in jail. Three charges lacked sufficient evidence to proceed to court, but the Mann Act trial began in March 1944. Chaplin was acquitted two weeks later. The case was frequently headline news, with \"Newsweek\" calling it the \"biggest public relations scandal since the Fatty Arbuckle murder trial in 1921.\"\n\nBarry's child, Carol Ann, was born in October 1944, and the paternity suit went to court in February 1945. After two arduous trials, in which the prosecuting lawyer accused him of \"moral turpitude\", Chaplin was declared to be the father. Evidence from blood tests which indicated otherwise were not admissible, and the judge ordered Chaplin to pay child support until Carol Ann turned 21. Media coverage of the paternity suit was influenced by the FBI, as information was fed to the prominent gossip columnist Hedda Hopper, and Chaplin was portrayed in an overwhelmingly critical light.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Chaplin increased when, two weeks after the paternity suit was filed, it was announced that he had married his newest protégée, 18-year-old Oona O'Neill – daughter of the American playwright Eugene O'Neill. Chaplin, then 54, had been introduced to her by a film agent seven months earlier. In his autobiography, Chaplin described meeting O'Neill as \"the happiest event of my life\", and claimed to have found \"perfect love\". Chaplin's son, Charles Jr., reported that Oona \"worshipped\" his father. The couple remained married until Chaplin's death, and had eight children over 18 years: Geraldine Leigh (b. July 1944), Michael John (b. March 1946), Josephine Hannah (b. March 1949), Victoria (b. May 1951), Eugene Anthony (b. August 1953), Jane Cecil (b. May 1957), Annette Emily (b. December 1959), and Christopher James (b. July 1962).\n\nChaplin claimed that the Barry trials had \"crippled [his] creativeness\", and it was some time before he began working again. In April 1946, he finally began filming a project that had been in development since 1942. \"Monsieur Verdoux\" was a black comedy, the story of a French bank clerk, Verdoux (Chaplin), who loses his job and begins marrying and murdering wealthy widows to support his family. Chaplin's inspiration for the project came from Orson Welles, who wanted him to star in a film about the French serial killer Henri Désiré Landru. Chaplin decided that the concept would \"make a wonderful comedy\", and paid Welles $5,000 for the idea.\n\nChaplin again vocalised his political views in \"Monsieur Verdoux\", criticising capitalism and arguing that the world encourages mass killing through wars and weapons of mass destruction. Because of this, the film met with controversy when it was released in April 1947; Chaplin was booed at the premiere, and there were calls for a boycott. \"Monsieur Verdoux\" was the first Chaplin release that failed both critically and commercially in the United States. It was more successful abroad, and Chaplin's screenplay was nominated at the Academy Awards. He was proud of the film, writing in his autobiography, \"\"Monsieur Verdoux\" is the cleverest and most brilliant film I have yet made.\"\n\nThe negative reaction to \"Monsieur Verdoux\" was largely the result of changes in Chaplin's public image. Along with damage of the Joan Barry scandal, he was publicly accused of being a communist. His political activity had heightened during World War II, when he campaigned for the opening of a Second Front to help the Soviet Union and supported various Soviet–American friendship groups. He was also friendly with several suspected communists, and attended functions given by Soviet diplomats in Los Angeles. In the political climate of 1940s America, such activities meant Chaplin was considered, as Larcher writes, \"dangerously progressive and amoral.\" The FBI wanted him out of the country, and launched an official investigation in early 1947.\n\nChaplin denied being a communist, instead calling himself a \"peacemonger\", but felt the government's effort to suppress the ideology was an unacceptable infringement of civil liberties. Unwilling to be quiet about the issue, he openly protested against the trials of Communist Party members and the activities of the House Un-American Activities Committee. Chaplin received a subpoena to appear before HUAC but was not called to testify. As his activities were widely reported in the press, and Cold War fears grew, questions were raised over his failure to take American citizenship. Calls were made for him to be deported; in one extreme and widely published example, Representative John E. Rankin, who helped establish HUAC, told Congress in June 1947: \"[Chaplin's] very life in Hollywood is detrimental to the moral fabric of America. [If he is deported] ... his loathsome pictures can be kept from before the eyes of the American youth. He should be deported and gotten rid of at once.\"\n\nAlthough Chaplin remained politically active in the years following the failure of \"Monsieur Verdoux\", his next film, about a forgotten vaudeville comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London, was devoid of political themes. \"Limelight\" was heavily autobiographical, alluding not only to Chaplin's childhood and the lives of his parents, but also to his loss of popularity in the United States. The cast included various members of his family, including his five oldest children and his half-brother, Wheeler Dryden.\n\nFilming began in November 1951, by which time Chaplin had spent three years working on the story. He aimed for a more serious tone than any of his previous films, regularly using the word \"melancholy\" when explaining his plans to his co-star Claire Bloom. \"Limelight\" featured a cameo appearance from Buster Keaton, whom Chaplin cast as his stage partner in a pantomime scene. This marked the only time the comedians worked together.\n\nChaplin decided to hold the world premiere of \"Limelight\" in London, since it was the setting of the film. As he left Los Angeles, he expressed a premonition that he would not be returning. At New York, he boarded the with his family on 18 September 1952. The next day, attorney general James P. McGranery revoked Chaplin's re-entry permit and stated that he would have to submit to an interview concerning his political views and moral behaviour in order to re-enter the US. Although McGranery told the press that he had \"a pretty good case against Chaplin\", Maland has concluded, on the basis of the FBI files that were released in the 1980s, that the US government had no real evidence to prevent Chaplin's re-entry. It is likely that he would have gained entry if he had applied for it. However, when Chaplin received a cablegram informing him of the news, he privately decided to cut his ties with the United States:\n\nBecause all of his property remained in America, Chaplin refrained from saying anything negative about the incident to the press. The scandal attracted vast attention, but Chaplin and his film were warmly received in Europe. In America, the hostility towards him continued, and, although it received some positive reviews, \"Limelight\" was subjected to a wide-scale boycott. Reflecting on this, Maland writes that Chaplin's fall, from an \"unprecedented\" level of popularity, \"may be the most dramatic in the history of stardom in America\".\n\nChaplin did not attempt to return to the United States after his re-entry permit was revoked, and instead sent his wife to settle his affairs. The couple decided to settle in Switzerland and, in January 1953, the family moved into their permanent home: Manoir de Ban, a estate overlooking Lake Geneva in Corsier-sur-Vevey. Chaplin put his Beverly Hills house and studio up for sale in March, and surrendered his re-entry permit in April. The next year, his wife renounced her US citizenship and became a British citizen. Chaplin severed the last of his professional ties with the United States in 1955, when he sold the remainder of his stock in United Artists, which had been in financial difficulty since the early 1940s.\n\nChaplin remained a controversial figure throughout the 1950s, especially after he was awarded the International Peace Prize by the communist-led World Peace Council, and after his meetings with Zhou Enlai and Nikita Khrushchev. He began developing his first European film, \"A King in New York\", in 1954. Casting himself as an exiled king who seeks asylum in the United States, Chaplin included several of his recent experiences in the screenplay. His son, Michael, was cast as a boy whose parents are targeted by the FBI, while Chaplin's character faces accusations of communism. The political satire parodied HUAC and attacked elements of 1950s culture – including consumerism, plastic surgery, and wide-screen cinema. In a review, the playwright John Osborne called it Chaplin's \"most bitter\" and \"most openly personal\" film.\n\nChaplin founded a new production company, Attica, and used Shepperton Studios for the shooting. Filming in England proved a difficult experience, as he was used to his own Hollywood studio and familiar crew, and no longer had limitless production time. According to Robinson, this had an effect on the quality of the film. \"A King in New York\" was released in September 1957, and received mixed reviews. Chaplin banned American journalists from its Paris première and decided not to release the film in the United States. This severely limited its revenue, although it achieved moderate commercial success in Europe. \"A King in New York\" was not shown in America until 1973.\n\nIn the last two decades of his career, Chaplin concentrated on re-editing and scoring his old films for re-release, along with securing their ownership and distribution rights. In an interview he granted in 1959, the year of his 70th birthday, Chaplin stated that there was still \"room for the Little Man in the atomic age\". The first of these re-releases was \"The Chaplin Revue\" (1959), which included new versions of \"A Dog's Life\", \"Shoulder Arms\", and \"The Pilgrim\".\n\nIn America, the political atmosphere began to change and attention was once again directed to Chaplin's films instead of his views. In July 1962, \"The New York Times\" published an editorial stating that \"we do not believe the Republic would be in danger if yesterday's unforgotten little tramp were allowed to amble down the gangplank of a steamer or plane in an American port\". The same month, Chaplin was invested with the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters by the universities of Oxford and Durham. In November 1963, the Plaza Theater in New York started a year-long series of Chaplin's films, including \"Monsieur Verdoux\" and \"Limelight\", which gained excellent reviews from American critics. September 1964 saw the release of Chaplin's memoirs, \"My Autobiography\", which he had been working on since 1957. The 500-page book, which focused on his early years and personal life, became a worldwide best-seller, despite criticism over the lack of information on his film career.\n\nShortly after the publication of his memoirs, Chaplin began work on \"A Countess from Hong Kong\" (1967), a romantic comedy based on a script he had written for Paulette Goddard in the 1930s. Set on an ocean liner, it starred Marlon Brando as an American ambassador and Sophia Loren as a stowaway found in his cabin. The film differed from Chaplin's earlier productions in several aspects. It was his first to use Technicolor and the widescreen format, while he concentrated on directing and appeared on-screen only in a cameo role as a seasick steward. He also signed a deal with Universal Pictures and appointed his assistant, Jerome Epstein, as the producer. Chaplin was paid $600,000 director's fee as well as a percentage of the gross receipts. \"A Countess from Hong Kong\" premiered in January 1967, to unfavourable reviews, and was a box-office failure. Chaplin was deeply hurt by the negative reaction to the film, which turned out to be his last.\n\nChaplin suffered a series of minor strokes in the late 1960s, which marked the beginning of a slow decline in his health. Despite the setbacks, he was soon writing a new film script, \"The Freak\", a story of a winged girl found in South America, which he intended as a starring vehicle for his daughter, Victoria. His fragile health prevented the project from being realised. In the early 1970s, Chaplin concentrated on re-releasing his old films, including \"The Kid\" and \"The Circus\". In 1971, he was made a Commander of the National Order of the Legion of Honour at the Cannes Film Festival. The following year, he was honoured with a special award by the Venice Film Festival.\n\nIn 1972, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences offered Chaplin an Honorary Award, which Robinson sees as a sign that America \"wanted to make amends\". Chaplin was initially hesitant about accepting but decided to return to the US for the first time in 20 years. The visit attracted a large amount of press coverage and, at the Academy Awards gala, he was given a twelve-minute standing ovation, the longest in the Academy's history. Visibly emotional, Chaplin accepted his award for \"the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century\".\n\nAlthough Chaplin still had plans for future film projects, by the mid-1970s he was very frail. He experienced several further strokes, which made it difficult for him to communicate, and he had to use a wheelchair. His final projects were compiling a pictorial autobiography, \"My Life in Pictures\" (1974) and scoring \"A Woman of Paris\" for re-release in 1976. He also appeared in a documentary about his life, \"The Gentleman Tramp\" (1975), directed by Richard Patterson. In the 1975 New Year Honours, Chaplin was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II, though he was too weak to kneel and received the honour in his wheelchair.\n\nBy October 1977, Chaplin's health had declined to the point that he needed constant care. In the early morning of 25 December 1977, Chaplin died at home after suffering a stroke in his sleep. He was 88 years old. The funeral, on 27 December, was a small and private Anglican ceremony, according to his wishes. Chaplin was interred in the Corsier-sur-Vevey cemetery. Among the film industry's tributes, director René Clair wrote, \"He was a monument of the cinema, of all countries and all times ... the most beautiful gift the cinema made to us.\" Actor Bob Hope declared, \"We were lucky to have lived in his time.\"\n\nOn 1 March 1978, Chaplin's coffin was dug up and stolen from its grave by two unemployed immigrants, Roman Wardas, from Poland, and Gantcho Ganev, from Bulgaria. The body was held for ransom in an attempt to extort money from Oona Chaplin. The pair were caught in a large police operation in May, and Chaplin's coffin was found buried in a field in the nearby village of Noville. It was re-interred in the Corsier cemetery surrounded by reinforced concrete.\n\nChaplin believed his first influence to be his mother, who entertained him as a child by sitting at the window and mimicking passers-by: \"it was through watching her that I learned not only how to express emotions with my hands and face, but also how to observe and study people.\" Chaplin's early years in music hall allowed him to see stage comedians at work; he also attended the Christmas pantomimes at Drury Lane, where he studied the art of clowning through performers like Dan Leno. Chaplin's years with the Fred Karno company had a formative effect on him as an actor and filmmaker. Simon Louvish writes that the company was his \"training ground\", and it was here that Chaplin learned to vary the pace of his comedy. The concept of mixing pathos with slapstick was learnt from Karno, who also used elements of absurdity that became familiar in Chaplin's gags. From the film industry, Chaplin drew upon the work of the French comedian Max Linder, whose films he greatly admired. In developing the Tramp costume and persona, he was likely inspired by the American vaudeville scene, where tramp characters were common.\n\nChaplin never spoke more than cursorily about his filmmaking methods, claiming such a thing would be tantamount to a magician spoiling his own illusion. Little was known about his working process throughout his lifetime, but research from film historians – particularly the findings of Kevin Brownlow and David Gill that were presented in the three-part documentary \"Unknown Chaplin\" (1983) – has since revealed his unique working method.\n\nUntil he began making spoken dialogue films with \"The Great Dictator\", Chaplin never shot from a completed script. Many of his early films began with only a vague premise – for example \"Charlie enters a health spa\" or \"Charlie works in a pawn shop.\" He then had sets constructed and worked with his stock company to improvise gags and \"business\" using them, almost always working the ideas out on film. As ideas were accepted and discarded, a narrative structure would emerge, frequently requiring Chaplin to reshoot an already-completed scene that might have otherwise contradicted the story. From \"A Woman of Paris\" onward Chaplin began the filming process with a prepared plot, but Robinson writes that every film up to \"Modern Times\" \"went through many metamorphoses and permutations before the story took its final form.\"\n\nProducing films in this manner meant Chaplin took longer to complete his pictures than almost any other filmmaker at the time. If he was out of ideas, he often took a break from the shoot, which could last for days, while keeping the studio ready for when inspiration returned. Delaying the process further was Chaplin's rigorous perfectionism. According to his friend Ivor Montagu, \"nothing but perfection would be right\" for the filmmaker. Because he personally funded his films, Chaplin was at liberty to strive for this goal and shoot as many takes as he wished. The number was often excessive, for instance 53 takes for every finished take in \"The Kid\". For \"The Immigrant\", a 20 minute-short, Chaplin shot 40,000 feet of film – enough for a feature-length.\n\nDescribing his working method as \"sheer perseverance to the point of madness\", Chaplin would be completely consumed by the production of a picture. Robinson writes that even in Chaplin's later years, his work continued \"to take precedence over everything and everyone else.\" The combination of story improvisation and relentless perfectionism – which resulted in days of effort and thousands of feet of film being wasted, all at enormous expense – often proved taxing for Chaplin who, in frustration, would lash out at his actors and crew.\n\nChaplin exercised complete control over his pictures, to the extent that he would act out the other roles for his cast, expecting them to imitate him exactly. He personally edited all of his films, trawling through the large amounts of footage to create the exact picture he wanted. As a result of his complete independence, he was identified by the film historian Andrew Sarris as one of the first auteur filmmakers. Chaplin did receive help, notably from his long-time cinematographer Roland Totheroh, brother Sydney Chaplin, and various assistant directors such as Harry Crocker and Charles Reisner.\n\nWhile Chaplin's comedic style is broadly defined as slapstick, it is considered restrained and intelligent, with the film historian Philip Kemp describing his work as a mix of \"deft, balletic physical comedy and thoughtful, situation-based gags\". Chaplin diverged from conventional slapstick by slowing the pace and exhausting each scene of its comic potential, with more focus on developing the viewer's relationship to the characters. Unlike conventional slapstick comedies, Robinson states that the comic moments in Chaplin's films centre on the Tramp's attitude to the things happening to him: the humour does not come from the Tramp bumping into a tree, but from his lifting his hat to the tree in apology. Dan Kamin writes that Chaplin's \"quirky mannerisms\" and \"serious demeanour in the midst of slapstick action\" are other key aspects of his comedy, while the surreal transformation of objects and the employment of in-camera trickery are also common features.\n\nChaplin's silent films typically follow the Tramp's efforts to survive in a hostile world. The character lives in poverty and is frequently treated badly, but remains kind and upbeat; defying his social position, he strives to be seen as a gentleman. As Chaplin said in 1925, \"The whole point of the Little Fellow is that no matter how down on his ass he is, no matter how well the jackals succeed in tearing him apart, he's still a man of dignity.\" The Tramp defies authority figures and \"gives as good as he gets\", leading Robinson and Louvish to see him as a representative for the underprivileged – an \"everyman turned heroic saviour\". Hansmeyer notes that several of Chaplin's films end with \"the homeless and lonely Tramp [walking] optimistically ... into the sunset ... to continue his journey\".\n\nThe infusion of pathos is a well-known aspect of Chaplin's work, and Larcher notes his reputation for \"[inducing] laughter and tears\". Sentimentality in his films comes from a variety of sources, with Louvish pinpointing \"personal failure, society's strictures, economic disaster, and the elements.\" Chaplin sometimes drew on tragic events when creating his films, as in the case of \"The Gold Rush\" (1925), which was inspired by the fate of the Donner Party. Constance B. Kuriyama has identified serious underlying themes in the early comedies, such as greed (\"The Gold Rush\") and loss (\"The Kid\"). Chaplin also touched on controversial issues: immigration (\"The Immigrant\", 1917); illegitimacy (\"The Kid\", 1921); and drug use (\"Easy Street\", 1917). He often explored these topics ironically, making comedy out of suffering.\n\nSocial commentary was a feature of Chaplin's films from early in his career, as he portrayed the underdog in a sympathetic light and highlighted the difficulties of the poor. Later, as he developed a keen interest in economics and felt obliged to publicise his views, Chaplin began incorporating overtly political messages into his films. \"Modern Times\" (1936) depicted factory workers in dismal conditions, \"The Great Dictator\" (1940) parodied Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini and ended in a speech against nationalism, \"Monsieur Verdoux\" (1947) criticised war and capitalism, and \"A King in New York\" (1957) attacked McCarthyism.\n\nSeveral of Chaplin's films incorporate autobiographical elements, and the psychologist Sigmund Freud believed that Chaplin \"always plays only himself as he was in his dismal youth\". \"The Kid\" is thought to reflect Chaplin's childhood trauma of being sent into an orphanage, the main characters in \"Limelight\" (1952) contain elements from the lives of his parents, and \"A King in New York\" references Chaplin's experiences of being shunned by the United States. Many of his sets, especially in street scenes, bear a strong similarity to Kennington, where he grew up. Stephen M. Weissman has argued that Chaplin's problematic relationship with his mentally ill mother was often reflected in his female characters and the Tramp's desire to save them.\n\nRegarding the structure of Chaplin's films, the scholar Gerald Mast sees them as consisting of sketches tied together by the same theme and setting, rather than having a tightly unified storyline. Visually, his films are simple and economic, with scenes portrayed as if set on a stage. His approach to filming was described by the art director Eugène Lourié: \"Chaplin did not think in 'artistic' images when he was shooting. He believed that action is the main thing. The camera is there to photograph the actors\". In his autobiography, Chaplin wrote, \"Simplicity is best ... pompous effects slow up action, are boring and unpleasant ... The camera should not intrude.\" This approach has prompted criticism, since the 1940s, for being \"old fashioned\", while the film scholar Donald McCaffrey sees it as an indication that Chaplin never completely understood film as a medium. Kamin, however, comments that Chaplin's comedic talent would not be enough to remain funny on screen if he did not have an \"ability to conceive and direct scenes specifically for the film medium\".\n\nChaplin developed a passion for music as a child and taught himself to play the piano, violin, and cello. He considered the musical accompaniment of a film to be important, and from \"A Woman of Paris\" onwards he took an increasing interest in this area. With the advent of sound technology, Chaplin began using a synchronised orchestral soundtrack – composed by himself – for \"City Lights\" (1931). He thereafter composed the scores for all of his films, and from the late 1950s to his death, he scored all of his silent features and some of his short films.\n\nAs Chaplin was not a trained musician, he could not read sheet music and needed the help of professional composers, such as David Raksin, Raymond Rasch and Eric James, when creating his scores. Musical directors were employed to oversee the recording process, such as Alfred Newman for \"City Lights\". Although some critics have claimed that credit for his film music should be given to the composers who worked with him, Raksin – who worked with Chaplin on \"Modern Times\" – stressed Chaplin's creative position and active participation in the composing process. This process, which could take months, would start with Chaplin describing to the composer(s) exactly what he wanted and singing or playing tunes he had improvised on the piano. These tunes were then developed further in a close collaboration among the composer(s) and Chaplin. According to film historian Jeffrey Vance, \"although he relied upon associates to arrange varied and complex instrumentation, the musical imperative is his, and not a note in a Chaplin musical score was placed there without his assent.\"\n\nChaplin's compositions produced three popular songs. \"Smile\", composed originally for \"Modern Times\" (1936) and later set to lyrics by John Turner and Geoffrey Parsons, was a hit for Nat King Cole in 1954. For \"Limelight\", Chaplin composed \"Terry's Theme\", which was popularised by Jimmy Young as \"Eternally\" (1952). Finally, \"This Is My Song\", performed by Petula Clark for \"A Countess from Hong Kong\" (1967), reached number one on the UK and other European charts. Chaplin also received his only competitive Oscar for his composition work, as the \"Limelight\" theme won an Academy Award for Best Original Score in 1973 following the film's re-release.\n\nIn 1998, the film critic Andrew Sarris called Chaplin \"arguably the single most important artist produced by the cinema, certainly its most extraordinary performer and probably still its most universal icon\". He is described by the British Film Institute as \"a towering figure in world culture\", and was included in \"Time\" magazine's list of the \"\" for the \"laughter [he brought] to millions\" and because he \"more or less invented global recognizability and helped turn an industry into an art\".\n\nThe image of the Tramp has become a part of cultural history; according to Simon Louvish, the character is recognisable to people who have never seen a Chaplin film, and in places where his films are never shown. The critic Leonard Maltin has written of the \"unique\" and \"indelible\" nature of the Tramp, and argued that no other comedian matched his \"worldwide impact\". Praising the character, Richard Schickel suggests that Chaplin's films with the Tramp contain the most \"eloquent, richly comedic expressions of the human spirit\" in movie history. Memorabilia connected to the character still fetches large sums in auctions: in 2006 a bowler hat and a bamboo cane that were part of the Tramp's costume were bought for $140,000 in a Los Angeles auction.\n\nAs a filmmaker, Chaplin is considered a pioneer and one of the most influential figures of the early twentieth century. He is often credited as one of the medium's first artists. Film historian Mark Cousins has written that Chaplin \"changed not only the imagery of cinema, but also its sociology and grammar\" and claims that Chaplin was as important to the development of comedy as a genre as D.W. Griffith was to drama. He was the first to popularise feature-length comedy and to slow down the pace of action, adding pathos and subtlety to it. Although his work is mostly classified as slapstick, Chaplin's drama \"A Woman of Paris\" (1923) was a major influence on Ernst Lubitsch's film \"The Marriage Circle\" (1924) and thus played a part in the development of \"sophisticated comedy\". According to David Robinson, Chaplin's innovations were \"rapidly assimilated to become part of the common practice of film craft.\" Filmmakers who cited Chaplin as an influence include Federico Fellini (who called Chaplin \"a sort of Adam, from whom we are all descended\"), Jacques Tati (\"Without him I would never have made a film\"), René Clair (\"He inspired practically every filmmaker\"), Michael Powell, Billy Wilder, Vittorio De Sica, and Richard Attenborough. Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky praised Chaplin as \"the only person to have gone down into cinematic history without any shadow of a doubt. The films he left behind can never grow old.\"\n\nChaplin also strongly influenced the work of later comedians. Marcel Marceau said he was inspired to become a mime artist after watching Chaplin, while the actor Raj Kapoor based his screen persona on the Tramp. Mark Cousins has also detected Chaplin's comedic style in the French character Monsieur Hulot and the Italian character Totò. In other fields, Chaplin helped inspire the cartoon characters Felix the Cat and Mickey Mouse, and was an influence on the Dada art movement. As one of the founding members of United Artists, Chaplin also had a role in the development of the film industry. Gerald Mast has written that although UA never became a major company like MGM or Paramount Pictures, the idea that directors could produce their own films was \"years ahead of its time\".\n\nIn the 21st century, several of Chaplin's films are still regarded as classics and among the greatest ever made. The 2012 \"Sight & Sound\" poll, which compiles \"top ten\" ballots from film critics and directors to determine each group's most acclaimed films,\nsaw \"City Lights\" rank among the critics' top 50, \"Modern Times\" inside the top 100, and \"The Great Dictator\" and \"The Gold Rush\" placed in the top 250. The top 100 films as voted on by directors included \"Modern Times\" at number 22, \"City Lights\" at number 30, and \"The Gold Rush\" at number 91. Every one of Chaplin's features received a vote. In 2007, the American Film Institute named \"City Lights\" the 11th greatest American film of all time, while \"The Gold Rush\" and \"Modern Times\" again ranked in the top 100. Books about Chaplin continue to be published regularly, and he is a popular subject for media scholars and film archivists. Many of Chaplin's film have had a DVD and Blu-Ray release.\n\nChaplin's final home, Manoir de Ban in Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland, has been converted into a museum named \"Chaplin's World\". It opened on 17 April 2016 after 15 years of development, and is described by Reuters as \"an interactive museum showcasing the life and works of Charlie Chaplin\". On the 128th anniversary of his birth, a record-setting 662 people dressed as the Tramp in an event organised by the museum. Previously, the Museum of the Moving Image in London held a permanent display on Chaplin, and hosted a dedicated exhibition to his life and career in 1988. The London Film Museum hosted an exhibition called \"Charlie Chaplin – The Great Londoner\", from 2010 until 2013.\n\nIn London, a statue of Chaplin as the Tramp, sculpted by John Doubleday and unveiled in 1981, is located in Leicester Square. The city also includes a road named after him in central London, \"Charlie Chaplin Walk\", which is the location of the BFI IMAX. There are nine blue plaques memorialising Chaplin in London, Hampshire, and Yorkshire. The Swiss town of Vevey named a park in his honour in 1980 and erected a statue there in 1982. In 2011, two large murals depicting Chaplin on two 14-storey buildings were also unveiled in Vevey. Chaplin has also been honoured by the Irish town of Waterville, where he spent several summers with his family in the 1960s. A statue was erected in 1998; since 2011, the town has been host to the annual Charlie Chaplin Comedy Film Festival, which was founded to celebrate Chaplin's legacy and to showcase new comic talent.\n\nIn other tributes, a minor planet, 3623 Chaplin – discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Karachkina in 1981 – is named after Chaplin. Throughout the 1980s, the Tramp image was used by IBM to advertise their personal computers. Chaplin's 100th birthday anniversary in 1989 was marked with several events around the world, and on 15 April 2011, a day before his 122nd birthday, Google celebrated him with a special Google Doodle video on its global and other country-wide homepages. Many countries, spanning six continents, have honoured Chaplin with a postal stamp.\n\nChaplin's legacy is managed on behalf of his children by the Chaplin office, located in Paris. The office represents Association Chaplin, founded by some of his children \"to protect the name, image and moral rights\" to his body of work, Roy Export SAS, which owns the copyright to most of his films made after 1918, and Bubbles Incorporated S.A., which owns the copyrights to his image and name. Their central archive is held at the archives of Montreux, Switzerland and scanned versions of its contents, including 83,630 images, 118 scripts, 976 manuscripts, 7,756 letters, and thousands of other documents, are available for research purposes at the Chaplin Research Centre at the Cineteca di Bologna. The photographic archive, which includes approximately 10,000 photographs from Chaplin's life and career, is kept at the Musée de l'Elysée in Lausanne, Switzerland. The British Film Institute has also established the Charles Chaplin Research Foundation, and the first international Charles Chaplin Conference was held in London in July 2005.\n\nChaplin is the subject of a biographical film, \"Chaplin\" (1992) directed by Richard Attenborough, and starring Robert Downey Jr. in the title role and Geraldine Chaplin playing Hannah Chaplin. He is also a character in the period drama film \"The Cat's Meow\" (2001), played by Eddie Izzard, and in the made-for-television movie \"The Scarlett O'Hara War\" (1980), played by Clive Revill. A television series about Chaplin's childhood, \"Young Charlie Chaplin\", ran on PBS in 1989, and was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program. The French film \"The Price of Fame\" (2014) is a fictionalized account of the robbery of Chaplin's grave.\n\nChaplin's life has also been the subject of several stage productions. Two musicals, \"Little Tramp\" and \"Chaplin\", were produced in the early 1990s. In 2006, Thomas Meehan and Christopher Curtis created another musical, \"Limelight: The Story of Charlie Chaplin\", which was first performed at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego in 2010. It was adapted for Broadway two years later, re-titled \"Chaplin – A Musical\". Chaplin was portrayed by Robert McClure in both productions. In 2013, two plays about Chaplin premiered in Finland: \"Chaplin\" at the Svenska Teatern, and \"Kulkuri\" (\"The Tramp\") at the Tampere Workers' Theatre.\n\nChaplin has also been characterised in literary fiction. He is the protagonist of Robert Coover's short story \"Charlie in the House of Rue\" (1980; reprinted in Coover's 1987 collection \"A Night at the Movies\"), and of Glen David Gold's \"Sunnyside\" (2009), a historical novel set in the First World War period. A day in Chaplin's life in 1909 is dramatised in the chapter titled \"Modern Times\" in Alan Moore's \"Jerusalem\" (2016), a novel set in the author's home town of Northampton, England.\n\nChaplin received many awards and honours, especially later in life. In the 1975 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE). He was also awarded honorary Doctor of Letters degrees by the University of Oxford and the University of Durham in 1962. In 1965, he and Ingmar Bergman were joint winners of the Erasmus Prize and, in 1971, he was appointed a Commander of the National Order of the Legion of Honour by the French government.\n\nFrom the film industry, Chaplin received a special Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1972, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Lincoln Center Film Society the same year. The latter has since been presented annually to filmmakers as The Chaplin Award. Chaplin was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1972, having been previously excluded because of his political beliefs.\n\nChaplin received three Academy Awards: an Honorary Award for \"versatility and genius in acting, writing, directing, and producing \"The Circus\"\" in 1929, a second Honorary Award for \"the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century\" in 1972, and a Best Score award in 1973 for \"Limelight\" (shared with Ray Rasch and Larry Russell). He was further nominated in the Best Actor, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Picture (as producer) categories for \"The Great Dictator\", and received another Best Original Screenplay nomination for \"Monsieur Verdoux\". In 1976, Chaplin was made a Fellow of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA).\n\nSix of Chaplin's films have been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress: \"The Immigrant\" (1917), \"The Kid\" (1921), \"The Gold Rush\" (1925), \"City Lights\" (1931), \"Modern Times\" (1936), and \"The Great Dictator\" (1940).\n\nDirected features:\n\n\n\n"}

By late 1970, new members had joined the group and the materials were improvised to a much greater extent. The company, which was still often billed as \"Yvonne Rainer and Dancers\" in the beginning, chose \"The Grand Union\" as a name to avoid any obvious associations with dance in order to inoculate themselves against charges that what they were doing was not properly \"dance\".

It took me awhile to understand that if 180 people walk out, it isn't the end of the world – if the 20 people left have the best time they've ever had.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52059509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52059509", "title": "History of German journalism", "text": "History of German journalism\n\nThe history of German journalism dates to the 16th century. Germany invented printing, and produced its first newspapers in the 16th century. However, Germany was divided into so many competing states that before unification in 1871, no newspaper played a dominant role.\n\nMerchants in early modern Europe exchanged financial and commercial news, and some started regular newsletters for their clients. One example of this type of merchant was the 16th-century German financiar, Fugger. He not only received business news from his correspondents, but also sensationalist and gossip news as well. It is evident in Fugger's correspondence with his network that fiction and fact were both significant parts of early news publications. 16th century Germany also saw subscription-based, handwritten news. Those who subscribed to these publications were generally low-level government officials and also merchants. They could not afford other types of news publications, but had enough money to pay for a subscription, which was still expensive for the time.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th century, there appeared numerous printed news sheets summarizing accounts of battles, treaties, kings, epidemics, and special events. In 1609 Johann Carolus published the first regular newspaper in Strasbourg, comprising brief news bulletins. By the 1620s, numerous major cities had newspapers of 4 to 8 pages appearing at irregular intervals; all were strictly censored. The first daily newspaper appeared in 1660 in Leipzig. Prussia increasingly became the largest and most dominant of the German states, but it had weak newspapers that were kept under very tight control. Advertising was forbidden, and budgets were very small.\n\nThe term newspaper became common in the 17th century. However, in Germany, publications that we would today consider to be newspaper publications, were appearing as early as the 16th century. They were discernibly newspapers for the following reasons: they were printed, dated, appeared at regular and frequent publication intervals, and included a variety of news items (unlike single item news mentioned above). The first newspaper according to modern definitions was the \"Strasbourg Relation\", in the early 17th century. German newspapers, like avisis, were organized by the location from which they came, and by date. They differed from avisis in that they employed a distinct and highly illustrated title page, and they applied an overall date to each issue.\n\nThe emergence of the new media branch was based on the spread of the printing press from which the publishing press derives its name. Historian Johannes Weber says, \"At the same time, then, as the printing press in the physical, technological sense was invented, 'the press' in the extended sense of the word also entered the historical stage. The phenomenon of publishing was born. The German-language \"Relation aller Fürnemmen und gedenckwürdigen Historien\", printed from 1605 onwards by Johann Carolus in Strasbourg, was the first newspaper.\n\nA large number of newspapers and magazines flourished. A typical small city had one or two newspapers; Berlin and Leipzig had dozens. The audience was limited to perhaps five percent of the adult men, chiefly from the aristocratic and middle classes, who followed politics. Liberal papers outnumbered conservative ones by a wide margin. Foreign governments bribed editors to guarantee a favorable image. Censorship was strict, and the government issued the political news they were supposed to report. After 1871, strict press laws were used by Bismarck to shut down the Socialist, and to threaten hostile editors. There were no national newspapers. Editors focused on political commentary, but also included a nonpolitical cultural page, focused on the arts and high culture. Especially popular was the serialized novel, with a new chapter every week. Magazines were politically more influential, and attracted the leading intellectuals as authors.\n\nThe republic's constitution along with other social forces and the earlier Reich press law of 1874 gave rise to a dispersed, energetic and pluralistic press with a wide range of political opinion after the Great War. The \" Generalanzeiger \" and the \" Boulevardblatt \" established consumer bases decades earlier. Wire news service and newspaper commercial lending by Ruhr industrial interests sought to influence editorial opinion prior to the Great War and during the republic. \n\nIn 1945 the occupying powers took over all newspapers in Germany and purged them of Nazi influence. The American occupation headquarters, the Office of Military Government, United States (OMGUS) began its own newspaper based in Munich, \"Die Neue Zeitung\". It was edited by German and Jewish émigrés who fled to the United States before the war. Its mission was to encourage democracy by exposing Germans to how American culture operated. The paper was filled with details on American sports, politics, business, Hollywood, and fashions, as well as international affairs.\n\n\n"}

The play is essentially a long monologue delivered by a small-time hustler named Erie Smith to the hotel’s new night clerk Charlie Hughes, lamenting how Smith’s luck has gone bad since the death of Hughie, Hughes' predecessor. O’Neill wrote \"Hughie\" in 1942, although it did not receive its world premiere until 1958, when it was staged in Sweden at the Royal Dramatic Theatre with Bengt Eklund as Erie Smith. It was first staged in English at the Theater Royal in Bath, England in 1963 with Burgess Meredith as Erie.\n\nThe play was first presented on Broadway in 1964 starring Jason Robards as Erie and directed by José Quintero. Robards received a Tony Award nomination for his performance, and revived the production in 1975 in Berkeley, California with Jack Dodson as Charlie Hughes. Robards and Dodson returned to perform it at the Hyde Park Festival Theatre in 1981 and the Trinity Repertory Theatre in Providence, Rhode Island in 1991, also televising their performances in 1984 for PBS.\n\n\"Hughie\" has been produced on Broadway three times since the 1964 Robards/Quintero production. In 1975 it was paired in repertory with another short play, \"Duet\", this time with Ben Gazzara as Erie (who also won a Tony Award nomination for the role), and in 1996 by the Circle in the Square Theatre in a production directed by and starring Al Pacino. The designers for that production were David Gallo (sets), Donald Holder (lights), Candice Donnelly (costumes) and John Gromada (sound). The Goodman Theater in Chicago put on the play in January and February 2010, with Brian Dennehy in the title role. The production was variously well-reviewed, with emphasis on Dennehy's strong performance. The play was revived in 2013 at the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, D.C. with Richard Schiff as Erie. It returned for a fourth time to Broadway with Forest Whitaker as Erie Smith in February 2016. The 2016 revival was directed by Michael Grandage with Darren Bagert as a lead producer. The production had a shortened run of 55 performances and closed on March 27, 2016.\n\n\"Hughie\" has been televised at least four times in addition to the 1984 Robards/Dodson version: in 1959 (for Swedish television), 1960 (Norwegian television), 1963 (Dutch television) and 1983 (French television).\n\n"}

{"id": "24658757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24658757", "title": "Impact of Native American gaming", "text": "Impact of Native American gaming\n\nImpacts of Native American gaming can be positive or negative, depending on the tribe and its location. In the 1970s, various Native American tribes took unprecedented action to initiate Native gaming enterprises. In doing so, they created not only a series of legal struggles between the federal, state, and tribal governments but also a groundbreaking way to revitalize the Native American economy. Native American gaming has grown from bingo parlors to high-stakes gaming and is surrounded by controversy on many different levels. There are disputes concerning tribal sovereignty, negative effects of gaming, and a loss of Native American culture. In the United States the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act was passed in 1988 in order to secure collaboration between the states and tribes and also in order for the federal government to oversee gaming operations. Native American gaming has proven to be extremely lucrative for several tribes, but it has also been unsuccessful in some instances. Native American gaming is contingent upon and only beneficial to its respective reservation.\n\nGaming can be extremely successful because it stimulates the economy, increases tourism to reservations, reduces unemployment, raises incomes, and increases tribal independence while reducing dependence upon welfare. Native American gaming has created over 300,000 jobs in the United States. Tribes in only 30 states are eligible to operate gaming enterprises because 16 states have no federally recognized tribes, and five states (Massachusetts, Texas, Missouri, Rhode Island, and Utah) prohibit Native American gaming. 224 of the 550 tribes in 28 states operate the 350 Native American gaming enterprises nationwide, and 68% of Native Americans belong to a tribe with gaming operations. According to the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development, these enterprises earned $19.4 billion in 2005. As compared to the $4.5 billion earned by Native American gaming revenues in 1995, Native American gaming enterprises have shown substantial growth in just ten years. These enterprises, earning $19.4 billion a year, account for 25.8% of the nation's $75 billion revenue (brought in by the total gaming enterprises in the country). In addition, Native American gaming is the source of 400,000 jobs, and the profits from the enterprises often go toward programs that create jobs. For example, 75% of the profit generated by Cherokee Nation Enterprises in 2005 was given to the Jobs Growth Fund, a fund that expands businesses within the Cherokee Nation to create more jobs.\n\nRevenues, by law, must go toward improving reservation communities. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act requires that revenues go toward: tribal government operations, promotion of the welfare of the tribe and its citizens, economic development, support of charitable organizations, and compensation to local non-Native governments for support of services provided by those governments. Tribes have boosted their socioeconomic status in the past several years by improving their infrastructure, but due to the lack of federal and state funding, have only been able to do so as a result of gaming enterprises. For instance, tribes often build casino-related facilities that draw visitors such as hotels, conference centers, entertainment venues, golf courses, and RV parks. Once a reservation has established a strong economic foundation, it can draw in businesses that are unrelated to gaming. A common trend is that casinos stimulate the economy, and other business sustain it. For instance, the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians built in a water bottling plant on the reservation and, along with three other tribes, invested in a hotel in Washington, D.C. The Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska are involved in a number of businesses; some of which are Internet media, home manufacturing, used autos, and gas stations. The Morongo Band of Mission Indians, a small band in California, has opened a Shell station, A&W drive-in, Coco's Restaurant, a water bottling plant, and a fruit orchard operation. In addition to involvement in private corporations, Native nations have enough sustainability to bolster government programs. Some of these projects include, but are not limited to: providing law enforcement, fire fighters, schools, translators for emergency response, college scholarships, assistance with mortgage down payments, protection for endangered species, monitorship for water quality, care for elders, police cars, foster-care improvements, and health clinics.\n\nTribes sometimes distribute funds on a per capita basis in order to directly benefit its citizens. Because \"per caps\" have sometimes shown negative effects such as a dependence on tribal government, low attendance in school, and an unwillingness to work, some tribes have experimented with decreasing per caps as punishment. To clarify, the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation Tribal Council deducted at least $100 from families' per caps with children with low school attendance. This ordinance resulted in a 30% increase in graduation rates in just 3 years, a substantial increase. Furthermore, the Las Vegas Paiute Nation deducts funding for jail from the offender's per capita because the Nation itself does not have a jail and must rent it from other governments. Punishments such as these provide an incentive for morality as well as financial assistance from the per caps themselves.\n\nStates also benefit from Native American gaming enterprises. States cannot tax reservations, but they can, under IGRA, negotiate a compact and demand compact payments. Tribes usually pay approximately or less than 10% of profit to states in order to compensate for strains put on the state. It is estimated that the state of Michigan earned $325 million from tribes spanning from 1993-2003.\n\nIt is required by law for a tribe to agree to a state compact if they request one, but the IGRA says nothing about local governments. However, many tribes do negotiate with local governments. They place a strain on traffic and emergency services, and it is not uncommon for a tribe to compensate for that. Native Americans pay $50 million annually to local governments across the nation. In addition, non-Natives hold 75% of the 300,000 jobs that belong to Native American gaming.\n\nWith gaming profits, the Creek Nation of Oklahoma has built its own hospital staffed by Native American doctors and nurses. Other tribes establish health clinics, dialysis centers, and fitness centers to deal with the problem of Native American disease and epidemics. Many tribes work toward securing hope for the future by improving schools. The Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe built two schools that teach fluency in English as well as Ojibwe language.\n\nThere have been many past attempts to revitalize Native American economies, but most of them have failed. Two of the more successful ventures, besides gaming, include selling gasoline and cigarettes for a much lower price than can be found off the reservation. Tribes are able to sell cheaper goods because there is no state tax. Lower prices draw in non-Natives from off-reservation sites, and tribes are able to earn a considerable profit. Seminole annual income grew from $600,000 in 1968 to $4.5 million in 1977. Smokeshops account for most of this substantial increase. Less effective efforts by the Seminole Nation to boost the economy include cattle raising, craft selling, and alligator wrestling. Cattle operations are popular among the Seminole tribe: with their 7,000 head herd, Seminoles are the largest cattle operators in the state of Florida and the twelfth largest in the United States. However, cattle operations are not overwhelmingly successful because they have been known to benefit the individual rather than the tribe. In addition, cattle operations led to government dependency and debt. Another economic endeavor is craft sales. Some individuals create traditional Seminole crafts and sell them, but this market does not leave a huge impact on the tribal economy. Instead, it benefits the individual as a supplementary income. Alligator wrestling is yet another moneymaker but is not relied upon. Alligator wrestling originated in the 1920s and became synonymous with Seminole culture. It has been denigrated as exploitative, though, and is quite risky. Consequently, alligator wrestling has become less prevalent with the growing popularity of Native American gaming.\n\nIf a Native American casino is unsuccessful, its failure is often linked to its geographic location. The size of a tribe is usually insignificant. This argument follows the logic of a free market economy. Tribes with a strong economic base find it easier to draw in new businesses and consumers. Tribes in remote locations suffer because they lack a consumer base to support new and existing businesses. For example, the Morongo Band of Mission Indians is very small, but their gaming enterprises are overwhelmingly successful. In contrast, the Sioux Nation, a very large nation, has struggled to achieve success with gaming enterprises. Regardless of its thousands of members and approximately 12 gambling halls, the Sioux Nation is unable to benefit from gaming enterprises because it is too isolated from potential customers. Another example is found in San Diego County. Four tribes in San Diego County had ambitious plans for a $100 million-plus resort and convention center but preemptively scaled back this idea because they are in an inconvenient location. Far away from other civilization and in close proximity to each other, the tribes concluded their chances of an overwhelming success were slim.\n\nThe Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, the second largest reservation in the United States, suffers from extreme poverty. It is the poorest county in the United States and has attempted to revitalize its economy through the gambling industry. However, these attempts have failed. Its casino created a mere 80 jobs, but this figure is insignificant since the unemployment rate on the reservation is up to 95%. The reservation has higher unemployment, diabetes, infant mortality, teen suicide, dropout, and alcoholism rates than the country on a whole. Many homes are dilapidated, overcrowded, and without water, plumbing, and electricity. Pine Ridge's failed attempts are predictable considering the closest major city, Denver, Colorado, is 350 miles away.\n\nWith Native American gaming has come the image of a \"rich Indian.\" This depiction contrasts other images of Native Americans portrayed as savage, pure, connected to nature, and spiritual. The reality (that some Native Americans are powerful entrepreneurs) contradicts the notion of what a Native American is \"supposed to be.\" \"Rich Indian\" propaganda even circulated in response to Proposition 5 in California in 1998 that perpetuated the stereotype that \"the only good Indian is a poor Indian.\"\n\nEve Darian-Smith and others have asserted that the impact of gaming on Indian culture in general is a loss of a cultural myth. According to Ronald Wright, these ideas are based on stereotypes and are \"construed by the dominant society in an effort to control and justify the enduring inequalities and injustices that permeate our legal system and social landscape.\" One perspective is that Native American gaming is not so much damaging Native culture as it is merely changing a cultural myth, the way the general population perceives Native Americans. Additionally, Native American gaming can be viewed as a means to rejuvenate and preserve tribal culture. For instance, many tribes use revenues generated from gaming toward museums and cultural centers. Tribes are not only able to fund themselves independently but can also afford to preserve their individual histories.\n\nThere is some controversy of Native American gambling because it is argued that it contributes to a moral decay. Gambling, it is argued, promotes crime and pathological behavior. Gambling addictions as well as drug and alcohol abuse are sometimes associated with Native American gaming. In 1962, the total estimated sums in the United States totaled $2 billion. This figure jumped to $18 billion in 1976, to $80 billion in 1985, and to $400 billion in 1993. In 2000, the total estimated sums wagered in the United States was $866 billion. In 2000, the commercial take was 10%, so the gaming industry earned approximately $70 billion, even accounting for the fact that gamblers win some money back. That is over three times the $22 billion in total revenues generated by all other forms of entertainment combined: tickets to movies, plays, concerts, performances, and sports events. Moreover, Native American gaming contributes to only a fraction of gambling in the United States. Native American casinos bring in only 17% of gambling revenue, while non-Native casinos raise 43%.\n\nIn late 2002, \"TIME\" magazine printed a special report entitled \"Indian Casinos: Wheel of Misfortune\" that infuriated Native Americans nationwide. Ernie Stevens, Jr., Chairman of the National Indian Gaming Association, wrote a letter to the editor of \"TIME\" in response to the report.\n\nNative American gaming has appeared many times in literature. The first appearance of Native American gaming was in John Rollin Ridge's 1854 novel \"The Life and Adventures of Joaquin Murieta\". Christal Quintasket wrote about Native American gaming in her 1927 novel \"Cogewea, the Half-Blood\". Gerald Vizenor writes on this theme in \",\" \"The Heirs of Columbus\", and \"Dead Voices\". Leslie Marmon Silko wrote a 1977 novel called \"Ceremony\" that focuses on gambling. Louise Erdrich, a prominent Native American author, wrote \"Love Medicine\", \"Tracks\", and \"The Bingo Palace\". Traditional, ritual gaming is a common theme in these pieces of literature and provide literary, rather than fact-based, accounts of Native American gaming.\n\n"}

It began in the late 1970s, although there is some indication of events in 1950. Events are held worldwide, and are most popular in the UK, U.S., Japan, Singapore, India , South Korea and becoming popular in subcontinent countries such as Sri Lanka.\n\nThe maze is made up of a 16 by 16 grid of cells, each 180 mm square with walls 50 mm high. The mice are completely autonomous robots that must find their way from a predetermined starting position to the central area of the maze unaided. The mouse will need to keep track of where it is, discover walls as it explores, map out the maze and detect when it has reached the goal. Having reached the goal, the mouse will typically perform additional searches of the maze until it has found an optimal route from the start to the center. Once the optimal route has been found, the mouse will run that route in the shortest possible time. \n\nCompetitions and conferences are still run regularly.\n\nA new version of Micromouse called the Half Size Micromouse has been introduced for 30th All Japan Micromouse Competition 2009 . Instead of a 16 × 16 maze the new competition uses up to a 32 × 32 maze. Cell and wall dimensions have been reduced by half, providing a new challenge. \n\nThere have been half-size competitions in Europe in Hungary in 2015 and the UK in 2018\n\nMice can use various searching algorithms. Common search algorithms use variations of the Bellman Flood-fill method , Dijkstra's algorithm, A* search algorithm among various graph traversal and tree traversal algorithms. \n\nMice can run at over three meters per second, depending on the maze design. Some of the best micromouse builders are Kato-san , Ng Beng Kiat and Nakashima-san . The current world record is 3.921 seconds and is held by Ng Beng Kiat.\n\nPerformance in recent years has improved considerably. As of 2015, winning mice are likely to run with forward acceleration and braking well over 10 m/s. Cornering is possible with centripetal accelerations as high as 2g. Micromice are among the highest performing autonomous robots.\n\nMost recently, robots are being equipped with a fan to create a partial vacuum under the mouse while it is running. The additional downforce available has made possible a huge improvement in performance. Compared to a non-fan mouse, the newer robots are likely to be able to achieve centripetal accelerations of 6g or more. Straight line accelerations can easily exceed 2.5g. \n\n"}

Empirically, a 2006 study of the 1990-1994 period when urban midnight basketball programs were first initiated as a crime-prevention strategy, found that—while confounding factors were likely involved—property crime rates fell more rapidly in cities that were early adopters of the original midnight basketball model than in other American cities in the same period.\n"}

{"id": "58433773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58433773", "title": "Moose cavalry", "text": "Moose cavalry\n\nMoose cavalry are military units of cavalrymen mounted on moose (Eurasian elk, \"Alces alces alces\") rather than the more usual horses. There are legends that state that the Mansi people of Western Siberia rode moose into battle but there is no evidence of this. In 17th-century Sweden Charles XI trialled the use of moose as a replacement for horses, which had to be imported. However they proved susceptible to disease, hard to feed and fearful of the sound of gunfire. The use of moose cavalry by the Soviets in the Winter War of 1939 and 1940 is also reported but seems to stem from a 2010 \"Popular Mechanics\" April Fools' Day article.\n\nLegends state that the Mansi people of Western Siberia rode into battle mounted on moose. The antlers of the animals are said to have been painted red. No evidence of such use has been found. In the 18th-century Catherine the Great is said to have outlawed the domestication of the moose out of fear that dissidents exiled to Siberia might use them as mounts in any armed rebellion against her. The story is believed to be apocryphal.\n\nThe moose (Eurasian elk, \"Alces alces alces\") had been used in Sweden to draw the sleighs of the Royal couriers since at least the reign of Charles IX. They proved effective in this role, able to travel around 230 miles in a day. As a development of this role Charles XI (1660–1697) trialled the use of moose cavalry. The intention was to replace the horses of one of his cavalry regiments with moose, to avoid the need to import horses as was the contemporary practice. It was anticipated that the animals would cause fear in the horses of enemy cavalry, allowing formations to be broken without the need for artillery or musketry. The idea was presented to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm.\n\nDuring training it was found that the moose was too fearful an animal to allow itself to be ridden into battle, taking fright at the sound of gunfire. They were also said to be of too peaceful a nature for the purpose. Moose were also more susceptible to disease than horses and there was difficulty in feeding the animals which were used to foraging across large areas rather than being fed on fodder in pasture.\n\nSome news outlets have reported that Joseph Stalin attempted to introduce the moose as a replacement for horses in Soviet cavalry regiments based in the northern parts of the country during the 1930s. The story is thought to have been popularised by a 2010 April Fools' Day article published in the Russian language edition of \"Popular Mechanics\".\n\nThe article claimed that 1,500 moose cavalrymen were trained for service in the Winter War of 1939 and 1940. Machine guns were supposedly mounted to the antlers of the moose. Among the more outlandish claims was that the start of the war was postponed to avoid clashing with the moose mating season and that the animals could distinguish between the Russian and Finnish languages at a distance of over a kilometre. The article included several photographs supposedly showing members of the moose cavalry unit. These were in fact posed by members of \"Popular Mechanics\"' publishing house dressed in reproduction Red Army uniforms with the moose superimposed in post-processing. A graphics artist, Vitas Chernyauskas, mocked-up the front cover of an instruction manual for the unit, based on contemporary Soviet documents and this was also included in the article.\n\nThe hoax article was widely reproduced in Russian media over the following years, often without the April Fools' Day disclaimer carried in the original article. Posters on military history forums often claimed to have seen, or even read, copies of the fictional instruction manual. The coverage in newspapers, satirical sites and social media meant that the story gained a measure of credence as a historical fact. Moose were later successfully domesticated in Soviet Russia but as livestock, for their milk and antlers.\n\nIn 2017, a war museum in Lakhdenpokhya, Karelia, Russia showcased the doctored photographs from the \"Popular Mechanics\" article in an exhibition as a recent discovery of historic documents. The exhibition claimed that the \"war moose\" had been trained by the Soviet army for four years. \n\nThe story, sourced from the museum exhibition, was covered by the Finnish national public broadcaster Yle in a television broadcast and as an online news article in June 2017. Yle was informed of the errors in the story by a member of the public but only issued a correction one month later. As a consequence they were investigated by the Finnish media regulator the Council for Mass Media in Finland for failures in fact-checking and responding to the error report. The erroneous story is still available on the Yle website, including the doctored images from \"Popular Mechanics\", but with a disclaimer and link to the Council for Mass Media's findings.\n\nThere is some information relating to Soviet moose cavalry trials that pre-dates the 2010 hoax. In 2004 the manager of the Kostroma Moose Farm, where the Soviets domesticated the moose for milk production in the 1940s, claimed that the trials were carried out in the 1930s. He claimed that \"Stalin thought elk could replace horses in cavalry regiments based in the north ... but this did not work out, and the idea was abandoned\".\n"}

Abraham came to prominence in the MTV reality TV show \"Teen Mom\".\n\nIn August 2012, Abraham released the autobiography \"My Teenage Dream Ended\", published by MTV Press. The book chronicles her teenage pregnancy and the problems she faced during the time, including her drug use, the arrest of her father, and the death of her daughter's father, Derek Underwood. The musical album, produced by Fredrick M. Cuevas, is a companion work to her autobiography; each of the ten songs shares a title with a chapter of her book. The book was a success making number 11 on \"the New York Times\" bestseller list.\n\nAbraham recorded her vocals for the album to a click track, while the production of the music was handled separately. In an interview with \"The Fader\", Cuevas stated: \"Like, she'd heard it before and approved it for that song, but as she was recording we never had the music on.\" Abraham also wanted the Auto-Tune effects on her vocals to sound \"edgy\", so worked with Cuevas to make them more aggressive. The album's first single, \"Finally Getting Up from Rock Bottom\", was released on August 3, 2012, through \"In Touch Weekly\" magazine.\n\nThe accompanying album received an overwhelmingly negative response. It has been widely criticized for its extensively autotuned vocals and bland production. Her single \"On My Own\" was derided as one of the worst works of pop music ever made, eclipsing Rebecca Black's \"Friday\". Feminist website Jezebel called the lead and sole single, \"Finally Getting up from Rock Bottom\", \"the most horrible combination of sounds to ever be assembled in the history of audio recording\", suggesting that while Farrah may have kept her baby, the song should have been aborted.\n\nBut despite garnering mockery in the popular media, the arrhythmic and cheaply digitized presentation of deeply confessional lyrics was bewildering enough to lead some to instead view it as a contemporary example of outsider art. In \"The Wire\", Andrew Nosnitsky called it a \"haunting and fascinating mess of outsider pop music\". Writing for \"The Atlantic\", David Cooper Moore suggested that the album \"is to teen angst what \"Eraserhead\" was to domestic angst\", making it \"a dark and compelling experiment in abstracting and compressing the vicissitudes of 'high school drama.'\" \"The Village Voice\" compared it to critically acclaimed witch house band Salem. \"The Guardian\" ranked it 32 on their list of best albums of the year. In a 2017 review for Charli XCX's \"Pop 2\" mixtape, Meaghan Garvey of \"Pitchfork\" retrospectively summarized: \"Sweepingly ridiculed as one of 2012's worst albums, that judgment, five years later, feels wildly narrow-minded. It is a baffling work, to be sure: frantic layers of dubstep, EDM, witch-house, and breakbeats seem to run in the opposite direction as Abraham's absurdly AutoTuned narratives about surviving the death of her husband. [...] After my first full spin of \"Pop 2\", I couldn't shake the thought: 'This sounds like Farrah, but good.'\"\n"}

The website offers help for victims, survivors, family and friends of victims, and people who are concerned that they might be harming another person. The website has different tabs to educate people on different topics such as violence in the LGBTQ community, advocate information, what to expect when calling the hotline, and education about domestic violence. The National Domestic Abuse Hotline is partnered with two outside organizations which are Break the Cycle and Loveisrespect.\n\nThe hotline is 100% confidential. Hotline operators, whom the NDVH call advocates, are given a series of training and practice sessions prior to answering calls and are instructed to ask the caller a series of questions to ensure that the caller is safe, ascertain the situation, and then help the caller determine a course of action. The hotline is intended to be used by not only people experiencing domestic violence, but also people who feel that they are beginning to show signs of abusing their partner. The hotline advocate will help the caller by asking questions to identify red flags, and teach the caller techniques on how to calm down. \n\nThe hotline operates 24/7, is available in over 170 different languages, and is additionally open to calls from undocumented immigrants. The NDVH's website also provides information on a variety of topics about domestic abuse, which includes the definition of abuse and its warning signs.

{"id": "463871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=463871", "title": "News Probe", "text": "News Probe\n\nNews Probe is a documentary television programme in China Central Television that has aired since 1996. It attempts to investigate various news, issues, and scandals, aiming to reveal the social problems and the insufficiencies of state policies. Its Chinese title, \"Xinwen Diaocha\", means \"News Investigations\". Together with Oriental Horizon (東方時空), Focus Report (焦點訪談)and Tell It Like It Is (實話實說) News Probe shares the similar reputation in documentary television programmes in China.\n\n\n\nThe maiden broadcast of 'Oriental Horizon'(東方時空) on May 1, 1993 signified the start of the broadcast of commentary programme on current affairs. One year later, on April 1, 1994, a similar programme Focus Report(焦點訪談), which means a talk show on the hottest topics, was broadcast. At the prime time of 9p.m. on May 17, 1996, the first episode of News Probe-- \"Hongzhi Ban\"(宏志班) was broadcast. The programme 'News Probe' is produced as a result of the ongoing development of such kind of programme. The founders of 'News Probe' expected this programme to report in a much detailed, in-depth, objective, systematic and authoritative way.\n\nDuring the past developmental years, the production team found a position for the program. News Probe is thus aired as an investigative doucumentary, not only a commentary one.\n\nThe reason of setting up this position is due to the vast competitions from other news programmes in CCTV. Focus Report(焦點訪談) provides detailed and universal description for different news events while 'Oriental Horizon'(東方時空) is good at rousing audiences' emotion during news reporting. Besides, the broadcasting time of News Probe is beyond all these news programs. Therefore, what News Probe can do is to provide innovative reporting methods so as to raise audiences' interests. As a result, an investigative reporting style was developed.\n\nAt the earlier stage of the program, the criteria on choosing the program topic are known as the slogan of \"Sanxing\" (三性), which means whether the topic is worth reporting, editing into program and investigating. However, in most cases, the three criteria are separately considered and only part of them are fulfilled. Afterwards, four methods of choosing a topic have been developed, known as the investigation on the theme, consensus, event and the inside skinny. \n\nBeing an investigative documentary, the News Probe raised the slogan of \"hunting the truth\", which consists of 2 layers of meaning. Firstly, to \nuncover the inside skinny which is concealed by some people or organizations, and those secret incidents which harm the public interest. News Probe thus also includes some reports involving wrongdoings by governmental departments, such as corruption in the Chinese Police. Secondly, News Probe also aimed at providing deep discussion on the complex problems that being investigated. \n\nThe production crew does not aim at generating any conclusion for each episode. Instead, it allows the audience to make their own judgements after viewing the programs.\n\nSince News Probe has been developed into an investigative documentary, it has its own characteristics:\n\nTo cut in short, the performance of the reporters during the investigation process determines the quality of the investigative documentary, therefore, reporters should be able in appling different methods depended on different situations in order to carry out a good programme .\n\nReporters of the programme must also reach several criteria of the production crew. They must be:\n\n\"News Probe\" based on the framework of “Investigative” Reporting. Investigative means from unknown to known, marching toward the darkness. Investigators intervene into internal parts of the incidents and find out the truth systematically. They need to stand in an objective position and base on real evidences. \n\nThrough continuously questioning and criticizing a range of social issues, News Probe has developed its unique style and made people aware of the blind spots of China, where sometimes also report affairs of China in connection with other countries. By reporting on social issues such as the proliferation of AIDS and SARS in China, the problem of Greenhouse effect, pollution in China and Germany (which is an episode in 1997), via interviewing the people involved, and by questioning everything, the objectives of the program are thus reached. \n\nInvestigation of each episode is initiated by reporters' suspect towards the events. The reporters then start the investigation together with the production crew. Apart from reporters' own finding of the stories, the general public can also tell the secret incidents through contacting the production crew directly, via the use of mail, news hotline and email. \n\nApart from interviewing the involved parties, crews of \"News Probe\" also investigate issues by different methods, such as consulting powerful institutions (for example, they have consulted India Wildlife Conservation Society, Wildlife Protection Organization, India Wildlife Trade Association, International Convention on the Trading of Endangered species and Asia Wild Life Trade Research Committees in the episode of \"The death of Tibetan antalope\") and people, referring to reference books, studying the issue’s history etc. These empirical methods enable News Probe to investigate issues in an objective and unbiased manner. \n\nThe programme itself is a report of the truth and is a reveal of the process of investigation made by crew. Each episode includes the discovery of the problems, the investigatory work done by the reporters and the crew, the evidence collected and all the way down to the exposure of the truth.\n\n\nThe production crew of the program includes the following posts (in hieratical order):\n\nChief Producer is responsible for the broadcast of the program, including the content of the program and the administrative work. Producer is responsible for the production of each episode and is accountable to Chief Producer. \n\nThe production of each episode follows the sequence stated below:\n\nThe production team has several criteria when choosing a suitable topic for each episode, including:\n\nLength of the program: about 40 minutes each episode\n\nAll of Mainland China, with an estimated audience figure of 100 million people.\n\nName: Pay for innocent(無罪的代價)\n\nThe government prosecuted a businessman, called Chan Yuen-Ho, over bribes. After his three-year imprisonment, the government released him because of lack of evidence.\n\n\"News Probe\" resolved to find out the inside story of the case. After interviewing the involved people, they found that the government prosecuted Chan Yuen-Ho because Chan was inobedient in taking advice and orders from the government. He rejected the government's advice of stopping external investment in his company.\n\nChan was insistent on his innocence and appealed to the high court continuously. He was released after three years of prison life. However, his company went bankrupt during these three years.\n\n\"News Probe\" has been a pioneer, providing a rare voice to investigate the\nactions of the Chinese government. It has courage to interview the involved officials by asking to-the-point questions and let audience know the actions of the China government. \nIt has allowed formerly voiceless persons to speak, and their Web site has allowed viewers to have their opinion heard. In this case, it gives a valuable opportunity for Chan Yuen-Ho to fight for the just response from the government.\n\n1996\n\nChina Broadcasting Television News\n\nSocial, educational and political Group\n\nSecond Class Prize \n\nWen Chi-ban (宏志班)\n\n1998 \n\n36th Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union\n\nSpecial Prize \n\nLife (生命)\n\nLa Maison du Maroc Television Documentary Prize\n\nSilver Goddess Prize \n\nChoosing village Head from big Head village (大官村裏選村官)\n\nHighest watching rate in 9:00–9:45pm programmes\n\n1999\n\nChina Broadcasting Television Club\n\n12th Excellent Broadcast and Compere Work Piece\n\nSecond Class Prize \n\nGreatest Bankrupt Case of State Enterprise (國企最大破產案)\n\n2000\n\nChina Broadcasting Television News\n\nSocial, educational and political Group\n\nFirst Class Prize\n\nConfession by Drug Addicts Getting rid of it (戒毒者自白)\n\nAnnual Award from The Center for Radio & Television Studies\n\n2001\n\n39th Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union\n\nTelevision Information Group Main Prize \n\nLitigation After Wedding (婚禮後的訴訟)\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

However, King chose not to intervene in Quebec. The most likely reason is that King did not want to alienate rural voters in Quebec, who continued to support the Liberals federally even as they supported the Union Nationale provincially.\n\nIn the 1957 decision of \"Switzman v.

{"id": "2197541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2197541", "title": "Pal Mickey", "text": "Pal Mickey\n\nPal Mickey is a discontinued interactive stuffed toy developed by The Walt Disney Company and previously sold at Walt Disney World. Pal Mickey was discontinued and no new stock is available for purchase as of October 2008. \n\nThe toy is a ten-inch (26.5 cm) plush model of Mickey Mouse, soft and easy for children to hold. Inside, it contains a microprocessor, a speaker, three AA batteries, three squeeze sensors (one in each hand and one in its belly), and an infrared receiver in its nose. A loop on the back of its head fits a clip or a lanyard hook for ease of carrying.\n\nPal Mickey was sold for use at the four theme parks at Walt Disney World Resort: the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios, and Disney's Animal Kingdom. Guests could previously purchase Pal Mickey at various on site hotel gift shops, all four theme parks, and Downtown Disney. It communicates invisibly with more than four hundred infrared transmitters around these parks. It will periodically giggle and vibrate to indicate that it has information to provide; when its belly or hand is squeezed, it will speak up with information about the immediate area, parade and showtime reminders, tips on what costumed walkaround characters may be nearby, and attractions with short queue times. It \"remembers\" where it has been so as to avoid repeating itself.\n\nIf it is squeezed when it has no tips to provide or when it is not at a park, it will tell jokes and play simple games. The toy is programmed with over seven hundred pre-recorded phrases. On September 2014, Disney ceased supporting Pal Mickey at the parks. . As of July 2017 Pal Mickey continues to automatically provide information about its immediate area, but no longer provides updates on character meet and greets or parade and showtime reminders.\n\nThe original version of Pal Mickey (commonly referred to as \"1.0\") was introduced in May 2003. It was dressed in red shorts with white buttons, white gloves, and yellow shoes. It sold for US$50, with rentals available for $8 per day plus a $50 deposit to return it by noon the following day; if not returned, that deposit was forfeited and the toy was considered sold. This version of the toy came with a clip. The rental program was discontinued at the end of 2004.\n\nThe \"Happiest Celebration On Earth\" version of the toy (commonly referred to as \"2.0\") was introduced on May 5, 2005 with the start of the Happiest Celebration on Earth events. It is priced at US$65. It is dressed in red shorts with gold buttons, white gloves, and yellow shoes; it wears a tailcoat and a gold bowtie, both of which fasten with velcro. It comes with a clip and a lanyard for carrying it. This version improves on the original in many small ways, such as by having a louder speaker, and it is able to sing Disney songs and ask Disney character trivia questions. Permanently attached to its right hand is a golden medallion; squeezing its right hand will make Mickey giggle and will make a \"Happiest Celebration on Earth Glow Medallion\" (sold during 2005) light up.\n\nIn September 2006, the \"Pal Mickey Sorcerer Costume\" (commonly referred to as \"3.0\") replaced the previous version of the toy. This Pal Mickey is dressed in a (removable) blue Sorcerer Mickey hat, red robe, and blue shorts (sewn on over Mickey's red shorts, which have white buttons like the first release). It does not have the medallion on its hand.\n\nA Spanish language version of Pal Mickey was also available.\n\nFour costumes for the toy were made available in early 2006. The costumes are \"Mickey Mouse Club\", \"Pin Trading\", \"Safari\", and \"Rain Wear\", and sell for US$10 each. In October 2006, \"Pirate Cap'n\" and \"Santa Mickey\" costumes were made available for US$12 each. The \"Santa Mickey\" sold out during December 2006 and was not available for order through the WDW Mail Order department. However, it returned for the 2007 Holiday season.\n\nThe toy was discontinued in fall 2008. The toy continued to work until September 2014. At that point Disney stopped servicing the infrared technology to focus more on their RFID technology used in their magic bands.\n\nThe original version of the toy provided a choice of three games, triggered by squeezing both of its hands at the same time.\n\n\nThese games are added in the \"Happiest Celebration on Earth\" and later versions of the toy, for a total of six games. The above three games are triggered by squeezing the toy's tummy and right hand at the same time; the below three games are triggered by squeezing its tummy and left hand at the same time.\n\n\nPal Mickey's electronics and batteries are encased in plastic housings (the original version's housing is black or white, the second version's is yellow, and the third version's is white) which can be accessed by unzipping the back of the toy. Beneath the zipper is an on/off switch which enables or disables the toy's squeeze and infrared sensors to prolong battery life.\n\nThe toys are shipped with batteries installed, and they are set to \"demo mode\" while they are on store shelves: they ignore infrared signals, and squeezing them will make them recite a sample of tips as if they were near park attractions.\n\nIt has been reported that the infrared transmitters in the parks are able to identify individual Pal Mickey toys and roughly track their locations as they are carried around, thereby letting Disney collect information about guests' progress through the parks. If this is true, the information collected would be anonymous, since nothing identifies a specific Pal Mickey as belonging to a specific person or family. However this is very useful as it shows a general pattern for families, who are Disney's main target audience. Most guest with a Pal Mickey are likely to have children, therefore this shows what attractions are and aren't popular with younger visitors. Nothing has been said about whether they will expand this idea to the other Disney Resorts.\n\n"}
{"id": "225178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=225178", "title": "Personality rights", "text": "Personality rights\n\nThe right of publicity, often called personality rights, is the right of an individual to control the commercial use of his or her name, image, likeness, or other unequivocal aspects of one's identity. It is generally considered a property right as opposed to a personal right, and as such, the validity of the right of publicity can survive the death of the individual (to varying degrees depending on the jurisdiction).\n\nPersonality rights are generally considered to consist of two types of rights: the right of publicity, or to keep one's image and likeness from being commercially exploited without permission or contractual compensation, which is similar to the use of a trademark; and the right to privacy, or the right to be left alone and not have one's personality represented publicly without permission. In common law jurisdictions, publicity rights fall into the realm of the tort of passing off. United States jurisprudence has substantially extended this right.\n\nA commonly cited justification for this doctrine, from a policy standpoint, is the notion of natural rights and the idea that every individual should have a right to control how, if at all, his or her \"persona\" is commercialized by third parties. Usually, the motivation to engage in such commercialization is to help propel sales or visibility for a product or service, which usually amounts to some form of commercial speech (which in turn receives the lowest level of judicial scrutiny). If an individual violates this right they will have to go through a lawsuit.\n\nIn contrast with common law jurisdictions, most civil law jurisdictions have specific civil code provisions that protect an individual's image, personal data and other generally private information. Exceptions have been carved out of these general, broad privacy rights when dealing with news and public figures. Thus, while it may violate an ordinary citizen's privacy to speak about their medical records, one is generally allowed to report on more intimate details in the lives of celebrities and politicians.\n\nUnlike most common law jurisdictions the personality rights in civil law are generally inheritable, thus one can make a claim against someone who invades the privacy of a deceased relative if the memory of their character is besmirched by such publication.\n\nPersonality rights have developed out of common law concepts of property, trespass and intentional tort. Thus personality rights are, generally speaking, judge-made law, though there are jurisdictions where some aspects of personality rights are statutory. In some jurisdictions, publicity rights and privacy rights are not clearly distinguished, and the term publicity right is generally used. In a publicity rights case the issue to decide is whether a significant section of the public would be misled into believing (incorrectly) that a commercial arrangement had been concluded between a plaintiff and a defendant under which the plaintiff agreed to the advertising involving the image or reputation of a famous person. The actionable misrepresentation requires a suggestion that the plaintiff has endorsed or licensed the defendant's products, or somehow can exercise control over those products. This is done by way of the tort of passing off.\n\nThe meaning of the law is best illustrated by principal cases on the subject.\n\nIn Australia, false association or endorsement is actionable via the law of passing off, not a separate law of \"right of personality\". The \"Henderson\" case was a decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales (both the first instance and appellate jurisdiction). The plaintiffs were ballroom dancers and they sued the defendant in passing off alleging it wrongfully published their photograph on the cover of a gramophone record entitled \"Strictly for Dancing: Vol. 1\". An injunction was granted on the ground that the use suggested the plaintiffs recommended or approved of the defendant's goods, or had some connection with the goods.\n\nHowever, in the 1988 case of \"Honey v Australian Airlines\", Gary Honey, a well known Australian athlete failed in his attempt to get a damages award after Australian Airlines used a photograph of him in action on a poster without his permission. The judge held, in essence, that the poster depicted excellence in general rather than a particular person.\n\nThe provinces of British Columbia, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Saskatchewan have enacted privacy legislation dealing with personality rights, which have the following traits:\n\n\nCanadian common law recognizes a limited right to personality. It was first acknowledged in the 1971 Ontario decision of \"Krouse v. Chrysler Canada Ltd.\", where the Court held that where a person has marketable value in their likeness and it has been used in a manner that suggests an endorsement of a product then there is grounds for an action in appropriation of personality. This right was later expanded upon in \"Athans v. Canadian Adventure Camps\" (1977) where the Court held that the personality right included both image and name.\n\nIn \"Gould Estate v. Stoddart Publishing Co. Ltd.\" (1998), the Ontario Court of Appeal concluded that simply writing about somebody, even for the purpose of generating a profit, does not constitute appropriation of personality.\n\nThe general tort of appropriation of personality is still in development, but it is currently being argued that it will be recognized in all common law provinces, with certain characteristics:\n\n\nIn 1994, the new \"Civil Code of Quebec\" introduced new provisions that enshrine the right to privacy as an attribute of personality:\n\nIn \"Aubry v Éditions Vice-Versa Inc\", the Supreme Court of Canada also affirmed that under Quebec's \"Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms\" privacy provisions, a photographer can take photographs in public places but may not publish the picture unless permission has been obtained from the subject, except where the subject appears in an incidental manner, or whose professional success depends on public opinion. The relevant provisions of the \"Charter\" are:\n\nTherefore, the following general characteristics may be drawn:\n\n\nIn Cyprus, people depicted in photographs can oppose their use in advertisements and their publication in magazines, even if it was taken in a public place.\n\nIn Denmark, the Danish Penal Code chapters 26 and 27, provides certain personality rights. The governmental Danish Data Protection Agency, has made a declaration regarding publication on the Internet of pictures taken of persons in a public area:\nA portrait photograph is defined as a photograph, with the purpose of depicting one or more specific person(s). The personality rights however may be contracted for persons who are generally accepted as public persons.\n\nIn France personality rights are protected under article 9 of the French civil code. While publicly known facts and images of public figures are not generally protected, use of someone's image or personal history has been held actionable under French law. The most famous case in recent history is perhaps the publication of the book on François Mitterrand called \"Le Grand Secret\" in which Mitterrand's doctor published a book that not only revealed private facts about Mitterrand's life, but also revealed medical confidences protected by doctor–patient privilege.\n\nIn Germany personality rights are protected under the German civil code, where the concept of an \"absolute person of contemporary history\" allows the depiction of individuals who are part of history but still gives them some protection of their rights of privacy outside the public sphere. A succinct statement of the German law can be found in the following judicial statement from the \"Marlene Dietrich case\":\n\nThe relevant Greek laws include 57 AK and 2472/1997. As regarding photography:\n\nThe relevant Guernsey law was enacted on 3 December 2012 under the name of Image Rights Bailiwick of Guernsey Ordinance 2012 and allows for the registration of a personality right, together with images associated with that personality. Images are widely defined and can be any number of personal attributes, such as likeness, mannerisms, gestures, voice, nickname etc.\n\nPersonalities able to register fall into 5 categories, namely sole, joint, group, legal and fictional character. In addition, humans can be registered up to 100 years after the date of death, making the law very favourable for estate managers and trustees.\n\nIn Hong Kong, as in most other common law jurisdictions, there is no separate \"personality right\", and false association or endorsement is actionable under the law of passing off. The main case on this point relates to Cantopop singer/actor Andy Lau and Hang Seng Bank over the allegedly unauthorized use of Lau's image on credit cards, which has led to the observation that only limited personality rights exist in this jurisdiction.\n\nIn a 1994 case involving the estate of Bob Marley, the Supreme Court of Jamaica acknowledged a property right of personality which survived his death.\n\nWhile personality rights are said to exist to some extent by a Korean attorney, cases filed to enforce such rights against shopping malls have been unsuccessful.\n\nIn the People's Republic of China, rights of personality are established by statute.\nAccording to article 99 and 100 of the General Principle of Civil Law of the People's Republic of China, the right of name and the right of image are protected. It is prohibited to use another's image for commercial use without that person's consent.\nIn the new Tort Liabilities Law, the right of privacy is mentioned for the first time in the legislation.\n\nIn South Africa personality rights are protected under the South African law of delict and the Bill of Rights, which also provides for freedom of expression and freedom of association. After much uncertainty concerning the recognition of image rights in South Africa, the Supreme Court of Appeal provided clarity in the landmark case of \"Grütter v Lombard\". In South Africa, a person's right to identity is violated if the attributes of that person is used without permission in a way which cannot be reconciled with the true image of that person. Apart from the unauthorized use of a person's image, this kind of infringement also entails some kind of misrepresentation concerning the individual, such as that the individual approves or endorses a particular product or service or that an attorney is a partner in a firm, while this is not the case. Secondly, the right to identity is violated if the attributes of a person is used without authorization by another person for commercial gain. Apart from the unauthorized use of the individual's image, such use also primarily entails a commercial motive which is exclusively aimed at promoting a service or product or to solicit clients or customers. The mere fact that the user may benefit or profit from any product or service in respect of which the individual's attributes have incidentally been used, is not in itself sufficient. This violation of the right to identity therefore also entails unauthorized use of the individual's attributes with a commercial purpose, whether it is done by means of advertisement or the manufacture and distribution of merchandise covered with the attributes of the individual. Personality rights are not absolute and it goes without saying that the use of a person's attributes must be unlawful before a plaintiff will succeed with any claim. With the use of a person's image, the personality rights, privacy, human dignity and freedom of association of the individual must often be weighed against the user's right to freedom of expression. The use of a person’s image can be justified on the grounds of consent, truth and public interest, fair comment and jest.\n\nAccording to the agency (Spanish) Data Protection for the collection and dissemination on Internet of images of a person without their consent may be a serious breach of the Data Protection Act which would be punishable by a minimum fine of 60,000 euros. According to \"El Mundo\" Data Protection Agency decided to investigate ex officio by the mere distribution of the image of a person on the Internet without their consent.\n\nIn the United States, the right of publicity is a state law-based right, as opposed to federal, and recognition of the right can vary from state to state. The rationale underlying the right of publicity in the United States is rooted in both privacy and economic exploitation. The rights are based in tort law, and the four causes of action are: 1) Intrusion upon physical solitude; 2) public disclosure of private facts; 3) depiction in a false light; and 4) appropriation of name and likeness. Typically, but by no means exclusively, the right of publicity is manifest in advertising or merchandise. In states without a specific right of publicity statute, the right of publicity may still be recognized via common law. The right of publicity has evolved rapidly, with a history of reported cases in the United States and worldwide.\n\nBy the broadest definition, the right of publicity is the right of every individual to control any commercial use of his name, image, likeness, or some other identifying aspect of identity, limited (under U.S. law) by the First Amendment. The right of publicity can be referred to as publicity rights or even personality rights. The term \"right of publicity\" was coined by Judge Jerome Frank in 1953.\n\nThe extent of recognition of this right in the U.S. is largely driven by statute or case law. Because the right of publicity is primarily governed by state (as opposed to federal) law, the degree of recognition of the right of publicity varies significantly from one state to the next. The Lanham Act governs federal protection of personality rights, and the doctrine has much in common with the laws defining federal protection of trademarks. In fact, an individual’s identity could be considered their personal “mark”, the misappropriation of which is sufficient to constitute infringement. In addition, both trademark and publicity rights appear to be designed somewhat to combat infringement for the sake of consumers, granting a cause of action for false descriptions, false representations, and false endorsement claims. Just as there is a cause of action for implying a certain brand sponsors a product when it really does not, there is a cause an action if a celebrity’s identity is used to imply endorsement for a product they are not, in actuality, affiliated with. Courts will typically consider eight factors when weighing a false endorsement claim, in order to determine the likelihood of consumer confusion:\n\n\nThese eight factors have their origins in the case \"Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Elects.\", but are similarly used by courts to analyze false endorsement claims by celebrities.\n\nIndiana is believed to have the most far-reaching right of publicity statutes in the world, providing recognition of the right for 100 years after death, and protecting not only the usual \"name, image and likeness,\" but also signature, photograph, gestures, distinctive appearances, and mannerisms. There are other notable characteristics of the Indiana law, though most of the major movement in right of publicity emanates from New York and California, with a significant body of case law which suggest two potentially contradictory positions with respect to recognition of the right of publicity.\n\nSome states recognize the right through statute and some others through common law. California has both statutory and common-law strains of authority protecting slightly different forms of the right. The right of publicity is a property right, rather than a tort, and so the right may be transferable to the person's heirs after their death. The Celebrities Rights Act was passed in California in 1985 and it extended the personality rights for a celebrity to 70 years after their death. Previously, the 1979 \"Lugosi v. Universal Pictures\" decision by the California Supreme Court held that Bela Lugosi's personality rights could not pass to his heirs.\n\n\n\n"}

It also published its own journals. Most of its films were documentaries or newsreels, but Prokino also made fiction films and animated films.

In the age of sail, trading followed seasonal patterns with ships leaving port at set times of the year to make the most of winds. When not at sea sailors would seek employment ashore. Their skill with ropes and booms found use in the theatre.\n\nThe original canvas backdrops used in the theatre moved with ropes and pulleys, being developed from techniques used for sails. It is from these roots that modern fly systems emerged. This also gave rise to the tradition in British theatres of never whistling on stage as the riggers would use the same whistled instructions on stage as they did aboard ship. A misplaced whistle could be taken as an instruction to the riggers to change the set.\n\nThe term rigger is still used for people backstage in theatres, the road crew for a live concert, conventions and trade shows, and by extension to similar jobs such as those who are responsible for fastening chain motors (like CM Lodestar) by wire rope to the structural steel of a building.\n\nWith the birth of the film industry, just as stage actors adapted their techniques to the new medium so did those back stage. The complexity of the new environment giving rise to specializations such as those in the film industry who rig scaffolding for film sets and camera rigs; also termed as a standby rigger if they are on site and 'on call' all of the time.\n\nIn the theater and film industry, a wire rigger is a worker in the special effects/stunts film crew who \"flies\" actors. They are responsible for rigging special harnesses to attached wires which in turn are run through a series of \"blocks\" (pulleys) to a control area where a wire rigger raises, lowers or traverses an actor wearing the harness. Wire riggers also rig up rails along which travels a \"skate\" from which the wire is attached. Many plays and feature films (e.g. Peter Pan, Harry Potter, Superman) use this technique.\n\nwordpress.com, Production Team & Crew Glossary\n"}

Tom Paris's suggestion, the holoprogram is set to run continuously, but over time, the strain put on the holotechnology begins to cause problems. The hologram characters begin to realize that the visitors are capable of changing the world at will (normally, holograms' programming makes them oblivious to non-in-world aspects). Scared by this, the villagers begin to suspect that the crew is a group of spirit folk that came to destroy Fair Haven. Captain Janeway manages to elude her boyfriend, Michael the barkeeper, but nevertheless asks Tom and his friend Ensign Harry Kim to figure out the problems with the Fair Haven program. The two establish that the subroutines to make the holograms unaware of things outside their program have malfunctioned due to prolonged operation. When Tom and Harry enter the program to fix it, however, they are captured and held hostage by the holograms, who begin to try to make Tom and Harry spill secrets about the spirit folks.

He also spoke to Bjo Trimble, one of the most famous \"Star Trek\" fans.\n\nThe negative reaction of some of the cast members to him when he wrote \"Star Trek Memories\" had come as a surprise to Shatner, and it was reported at the time that he was dismayed at the response.

It was developed by Beenox and published by Activision. It is loosely based on the 2014 film of the same name.\n\nIt was released on April 29 in North America and May 2 in Europe for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Wii U, and Xbox 360. The Xbox One version was released alongside the other platforms digitally while the release of physical copies was delayed by two weeks. Gameloft also released a mobile version on April 17 for iOS and Android devices as a paid game. The game was also localized in Japan as a Sony-exclusive title.\n\nMorality is used in a system known as \"Hero or Menace\", where players will be rewarded for stopping crimes or punished for not consistently doing so or not responding. If the player responds to crimes and successfully stops them, their hero rating will go up, failing to do so will result in Spider Man's rating to decrease. The player is able to upgrade Spider-Man's web shooters. During certain sections of the game, the player can control Spider-Man's alter ego Peter Parker and walk around doing detective work.\n\nPlayers have access to Peter Parker's home, and his room allows players to replay previous missions from the main storyline, purchase upgrades and equip the various costumes available. Audio logs of many characters can be collected from around the city. Players can use the Metro to go back to Peter Parker's home.\n\nAdditionally, new enemy types have been introduced. Armored guards can be taken down either with a stealth attack or by the Ionic Web upgrade, which allows players to break down armor, thus leaving the guard vulnerable to damage.\n\nFurthermore, the city has been expanded to incorporate unique districts that allow for more open space to the player. The crimes from the first game have been expanded on, but it also includes new crimes such as arson and hostage situations. Unlike the previous game, there will be constant random side activities. Additionally, the use of the Web-Rush system returns and has been expanded on from the previous game, now allowing for critical strikes, dodges and rolls. There are also new upgrades and abilities introduced into the game, some of which have been expanded on from the previous game.\n\nThe player can, as before, use their in-game smartphone to access the map, which provides the player with information of activities taking place in the area at the time. Players can use the map to track current activities, main and side missions. Players will also use the in-game smart phone to manage in-game messages and upgrades for their suit and skills.\n\nMissions have been altered to fit players' play style. Rather than players navigating through a linear level, levels have been redesigned to be more open, allowing players to explore the map and providing them with different ways to approach the mission. Players can now choose between a stealth approach and a combative, open approach to engage their enemies. Additionally, stealth based attacks have been improved since the previous entry, players are now able to silently take down enemies from a distance. Players are able to silently take down enemies from any surface the player is on, whether it be the ceiling, the wall or the ground. Players are also able to repel from their webs and perform inverted take downs on enemies.\n\nAfter the events of the previous game, Peter Parker, also known as the vigilante Spider-Man, begins searching again after Dennis Carradine, the criminal who murdered Uncle Ben two years ago. In his search, Spider-Man runs into Herman Shultz, one of Carradine's contractor. Shultz doesn't know anything about Carradine, but instead tells him about the recently started gang war, in which his gang is also involved. Spider-Man starts interrogating him about the recently appeared Russian gang, Schultz's gang's rivals, but Schultz escapes.\n\nThe following day, Spider-Man returns to his regular life of crime fighting, in the hope of finding more about Carradine's whereabouts. Eventually, he finds out about a deal in which Carradine might be involved, so he goes to investigate. He chases Carradine, but loses him for a short while. When he finds him again, he discovers that he has been murdered by a serial killer known as the \"Carnage Killer\". Spider-Man decides to track down Carradine's killer, and bring him to Ravencroft, a prison for the criminally insane.\n\nPeter returns home to talk to Aunt May, only to hear the breaking news: both Shultz's and the Russian gang are attacking Oscorp, in order to steal the advanced technology and weapons kept there, so that they could win the gang war. Spider-Man, feeling guilty for letting Shultz escape, rushes to stop them. After saving the lives of the kidnapped employees, including an electric engineer named Max Dillon, Spider-Man apprehends all the mobsters from both gangs (who were fighting over the technology) and prevents them from stealing anything or destroying the building. However, he runs once again into Shultz, who built himself a pair of shock gloves and now calls himself the Shocker. After defeating Shocker, Spidey interrogates him about the gang war and the Carnage Killer, and finds out that every criminal and mobster in town is afraid of this mysterious killer. Spider-Man then apprehends Shultz as well, but takes some of the technology he used for the gloves to make himself a similar gadget.\n\nFollowing the attack and the death of Norman Osborn, the head of Oscorp, CEO Harry Osborn (Norman's son and Peter's childhood friend) and billionaire Wilson Fisk announce that their companies will begin working together to fund the Enhanced Crime Task Force, a privatized police force meant to contain criminals, as well as Spider-Man. When Fisk offers to take Oscorp off of Harry's hands, Harry rebuffs him. Fisk decides to wait until Harry dies from the same genetic disease that killed Norman, and then take over Oscorp.\n\nMeanwhile, Spider-Man is met by a man named Kraven, who came to New York City in an attempt to hunt and kill all of Oscorp's failed cross-species experiments (which Spidey fought in the previous game). Kraven offers Peter a chance to act as his protege. Peter accepts and the two work together to find the Carnage Killer.\n\nSpider-Man discovers a Russian hideout, where he finds a map of all the places the killer attacked so far. However, he also finds the Russian's plan to kill Wilson Fisk during the fundraiser that will take place that night. Spider-Man sneaks at the fundraiser as his alter-ego and stops the Russian's plan. There, he also meets up with Harry Osborn (whom he hasn't seen for 10 years), as well as Felicia Hardy, a bank robber whom he fought 2 years ago (in the previous game), and somehow both managed to escape from prison and was present in during Spider-Man's search for Carradine. Spidey then heads for the docks, the Russian's main hideout. There he recovers all the stolen Oscorp tech and rescues a man who is an advertising seller, whom the Russians believe to be the Carnage Killer. After saving him, the advertising seller gives Spider-Man a description of the Carnage Killer.\n\nThe next day, using the map and the description, Peter and Kraven track down the killer. When they find him, he reveals himself as Cletus Kasady. Spider-Man and Kasady fight, and Kasady is defeated. However, Peter refuses to kill Kasady, after Kraven urges him to. Kasady is apprehended by the police and taken to Ravencroft where he meets Harry Osborn's assistant, . Kasady begins to be experimented on with a symbiotic red liquid code-named Venom, which was originally meant to cure Norman Osborn's disease.\n\nSoon after, with the Carnage Killer in jail and the Russian Mob and Shultz's gang defeated, a mysterious man named the \"Kingpin\" begins filling in the power vacuum. At the same time, more people start viewing Spidey as a menace, and so, more Task Force troops appear in the city to take care of criminals and him. In an attempt to remake his reputation as a hero, Spider-Man escorts a police van to its destination, and then makes his way to a museum that is being robbed. After taking care of the robbers, Spidey fights with Felicia Hardy, who now calls herself Black Cat. After defeating her, Black Cat reveals that the Kingpin is Wilson Fisk (just as Peter thought) and that he is the one who got her out of Ravencroft. However, he made cross-species experiments on her, thus giving super-powers, just like Spider-Man. Peter offers to help her, but she refuses and runs away.\n\nThe following day, Peter makes his way to Harry's apartment in order to receive information on Wilson Fisk. However, Harry tells Peter that he is dying and asks him for Spider-Man's help, believing that his blood can help him with a cure. Peter visits Harry as Spider-Man and tells him that he cannot give him his blood, because he wants to avoid another incident like the Lizard incident and the blood needs to be researched, a fact that Harry sees as a waste of time. This discussion makes Harry angry with Spider-Man and causes him to look for a cure on his own.\n\nAfter the discussion, Spider-Man makes his way to Kraven's loft, where he discovered from Harry's confirmations that he was hired by Kingpin to kill him. While there, he is tranquilized by Kraven and then forced to fight him in Central Park. During the fight, Kraven reveals that he trained him only to make Spider-Man a worthy opponent. Spider-Man defeats Kraven and coerces info from him on how to get to Kingpin, before webbing him up on a tree.\n\nArriving at Fisk Tower, Spider-Man infiltrates one of the trucks and rides it to Kingpin's hideout. Spider-Man proceeds to fight the Task Force soldiers and street thugs defending Kingpin, before entering the hideout and confronting him. Spider-Man defeats Kingpin and begins hacking his computer for incriminating evidence. However, all of a sudden, the power in the whole city is cut down by Max Dillon (the Oscorp electric engineer whom Spidey saved earlier), who, after an accident, gained electric powers and was incarcerated at Ravencroft, but managed to escape. Thus, Spider-Man is forced to leave and go stop Dillon, who is now calling himself Electro. \n\nSpider-Man reaches Time Square and tries to reason with Electro, who reveals that the doctors at Ravencroft had done experiments on him. Electro blames Spidey for not being there to save him, since they were \"partners\", and thus attacks him. Spider-Man manages to defeat Electro, whose body explodes, thus killing him. The power returns to New York, but Spidey feels sorry for Dillon, since not only he did meant him to be his true partner, he was also only a victim, and realises that Ravencroft must be doing similar experiments on all of their patients, so its time for him to stop them.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry discovers and injects himself with Richard Parker's spider venom (which gave Peter his powers), hoping that it will cure him of his disease. He also finds out from one of his employees that the rumors about Fisk trying to take over Oscorp are true. This makes him even more angry and, because of the unstable venom he has just injected himself with, he becomes insane, thus causing havoc in the Oscorp building. \n\nSpider-Man comes to investigate and finds the insane and grotesque Harry, who dubs himself the \"Green Goblin\". After saving the civilians inside the building and defusing the bombs Green Goblin has planted around Manhattan, Spider-Man is forced to chase and fight his former friend. Peter eventually defeats Green Goblin, who accidentally stabs himself with his own glider and dies.\n\nWith the menace of the Green Goblin over, Spider-Man heads over to the Ravencroft Institute, after hearing of large riots breaking out. Spider-Man saves Donald Menken, who reveals that the experiments on Kasady failed, thus allowing him to control the Venom he was injected with and now calls himself Carnage. After taking Menken and the other staff to safety, Spidey defeats all the other patients Kasady has infected with the symbiote, and eventually finds him. Spider-Man defeats Kasady, but he and the symbiote fully bond, becoming Carnage. Spidey manages to defeat Carnage and burns the symbiote off Kasady, thanks to Menken's tips on how to defeat the symbiote. He begs Spider-Man to let him die, but he refuses, saying that they are different, and takes him back to his cell, where the symbiote is completely removed. \n\nSometime later, Peter visits Stan Lee in his comic book shop. There, Stan encourages him to be the man Uncle Ben would have wanted him to be, before Peter resumes his role as Spider-Man and goes to save the day once more.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Kingpin tells the mayor on the phone that he will continue to finance the Enhanced Crime Task Force without Harry, when he is interrupted by the Chameleon, who was actually posing as Donald Menken all along. When he asks Fisk what their next plan is, he replies that \"the real work begins\".\n\nThe game was announced at New York Comic Con October 2013 slated for a Spring 2014 release. It was announced that Beenox would be developing the game.\n\nMotion capture performances were provided by Aaron Schoenke of Bat in the Sun Productions, as well as Sean T. Krishnan and Alina Andrei.\n\nA small teaser trailer was released at the New York Comic Con in 2013 to support the first announcement of the game. In January 2014, the first trailer for the game was released to the public. The release date for the console versions was announced in March 2014. The walkthrough trailer was released on 27 March 2014. The launch trailer for the mobile version was released upon the release of the game.\n\n\"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\" received generally mixed reviews upon release, with most of the criticism aimed at the graphics, story, and glitches. The iOS version of the game has a weighted aggregate rating of 58/100 on Metacritic, based on 11 reviews, and 57.50% on GameRankings, based 8 reviews, the PlayStation 3 version of the game has 59.00% on GameRankings, based on 1 review, the PlayStation 4 version of the game has 54.02% on GameRankings, based on 5 reviews, and 50/100 on Metacritic, based on 7 reviews.\n\nThe Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions were reviewed as \"inferior\" to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions, primarily due to the fact that the older console versions suffered from poor lighting, frame rate drops, and poorly detailed textures. The PS4 version of the game received a 5.4/10 from IGN. The Xbox One version of the game received a 5.5/10 from Digital-Tutors stating the biggest issue was \"...it just isn’t polished, and based on the many issues we found with the game it looks thrown together in a rush trying to get it out the door in time for the release of the movie.\" ABC's Good Game hated the game, both Bajo and Hex gave it a 4/10 with Hex saying; \"This feels like a poor copy-paste job of \"The Amazing Spider-Man\", with most of the good bits removed.\"\n\nEurogamer's Dan Whitehead scored the game a 2 out of 10, saying \"It's like a part of me has died\". Whitehead was very disappointed in the game because, as he is a big fan of Spider-Man, he felt that the game provided no significant fun for the player, whereas past Spider-Man games at least provided something. Whitehead stated: \"Sullied by lacklustre gameplay and trampled by technical shoddiness, this time Spidey hasn't been done in by the Sinister Six, but reduced to a Terrible Two.\"\n\nTom McShea from GameSpot scored the game a 5/10. McShea called the representation of Spider-Man \"enjoyable\", and liked the \"satisfying\" boss battles, but criticized the controls, side-missions, and combat. McShea summarized his review by saying: \"The biggest failing of \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\" is how familiar it feels. In fact, there have been other open-world games starring Spider-Man that walk a remarkably similar path. So there weren't many surprises, nothing that jumped out and made me take notice. Still, being able to spend time with Spider-Man was enough for me to stomach the various problems, just because he's a fun character to listen to. There's nothing majorly wrong with \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\", after all. There's just not a lot right with it, either.\"\n\nRichard Grisham of GamesRadar was more positive of the game, giving it a 3 out of 5. He called the combat \"shallow\" but \"enjoyable\", praised the collectables, and liked the \"entertaining, fun\" story. He did feel as though the game was a dated experience, and disliked the controls and mission variety.\n\nIn his review for Polygon, Justin McElroy scored the game a 6/10 and wrote: \"I've accepted that there's probably never going to be a truly great Spider-Man game. If the dispiriting \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\" is any indication, Activision and Beenox may have reached the same conclusion. There have been many worse Spider-Man games than this. But I can't recall one that's swung so conceptually close to greatness only to let poor execution drag it back to Earth.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "31557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31557", "title": "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly", "text": "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\n\nThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly (, ) is a 1966 Italian epic Spaghetti Western film directed by Sergio Leone and starring Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach in their respective title roles. Its screenplay was written by Age & Scarpelli, Luciano Vincenzoni and Leone (with additional screenplay material and dialogue provided by an uncredited Sergio Donati), based on a story by Vincenzoni and Leone. Director of photography Tonino Delli Colli was responsible for the film's sweeping widescreen cinematography, and Ennio Morricone composed the film's score including its main theme. It is an Italian-led production with co-producers in Spain, West Germany and the United States.\n\nThe film is known for Leone's use of long shots and close-up cinematography, as well as his distinctive use of violence, tension, and stylistic gunfights. The plot revolves around three gunslingers competing to find fortune in a buried cache of Confederate gold amid the violent chaos of the American Civil War (specifically the New Mexico Campaign in 1862), while participating in many battles and duels along the way. The film was the third collaboration between Leone and Clint Eastwood, and the second with Lee Van Cleef.\n\n\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" was marketed as the third and final installment in the \"Dollars Trilogy\", following \"A Fistful of Dollars\" and \"For a Few Dollars More\". The film was a financial success, grossing over $25 million at the box office, and is credited with catapulting Eastwood into stardom. Due to general disapproval of the Spaghetti Western genre at the time, critical reception of the film following its release was mixed, but it gained critical acclaim in later years. \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" is now seen as one of the greatest and most influential Western movies.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, a trio of bounty hunters attempt to kill an unseen fugitive, later revealed to be Tuco. After multiple gunshots and bursting through a window, Tuco escapes on horseback leaving the three bounty hunters presumed dead on the floor.\n\nElsewhere, mercenary Angel Eyes interrogates former Confederate soldier Stevens, whom Angel Eyes is contracted to kill, about Jackson, a fugitive who stole a cache of Confederate gold. Angel Eyes makes Stevens tell him the new name Jackson is using: Bill Carson. Stevens offers Angel Eyes $1,000 to kill Baker, Angel Eyes's employer. Angel Eyes accepts the contract, and kills Stevens as he leaves. Angel Eyes returns to Baker for his fee, then shoots Baker, fulfilling his contract with Stevens.\n\nMeanwhile, Mexican bandit Tuco Ramírez is rescued from three bounty hunters by \"Blondie\", who delivers him to the local sheriff to collect his $2,000 bounty. As Tuco is about to be hanged, Blondie severs Tuco's noose by shooting it, and sets him free. The two escape on horseback and split the bounty in a lucrative money-making scheme. They repeat the process in another town for more reward money. Blondie grows weary of Tuco's complaints, and abandons him without horse or water in the desert. A vengeful Tuco barely survives and tracks Blondie to a town being abandoned by Confederate troops. As he prepares to force Blondie to hang himself, Union forces shell the town, allowing Blondie to escape.\n\nFollowing an arduous search, Tuco recaptures Blondie and force-marches him across a desert until Blondie collapses from dehydration. As Tuco prepares to shoot him, he sees a runaway carriage. Inside are several dead soldiers and a near-death Bill Carson, who promises Tuco $200,000 in Confederate gold, buried in a grave in Sad Hill Cemetery. Tuco demands to know the name on the grave, but Carson collapses from thirst before answering. When Tuco returns with water, Carson has died and Blondie, slumped next to him, reveals that Carson recovered and told him the name on the grave before dying. Tuco, who now has strong motivation to keep Blondie alive, gives him water and takes him to a nearby frontier mission, where his brother is the head Abbot, to recover.\n\nAfter Blondie's recovery, the two leave in Confederate uniforms from Carson's carriage, only to be captured by Union soldiers and remanded to the prisoner of war camp of Batterville. At roll call, Tuco answers for \"Bill Carson\", getting the attention of Angel Eyes, now a disguised Union sergeant at the camp. Angel Eyes tortures Tuco, who reveals the name of the cemetery, but confesses that only Blondie knows the name on the grave. Realizing that Blondie will not yield to torture, Angel Eyes offers him an equal share of the gold and a partnership. Blondie agrees and rides out with Angel Eyes and his gang. Tuco is packed on a train to be executed, but escapes.\n\nBlondie, Angel Eyes, and his henchmen arrive in an evacuated town. Tuco, having fled to the same town, takes a bath in a ramshackle hotel and is surprised by Elam, one of the three bounty hunters searching for him. Tuco shoots Elam, causing Blondie to investigate the gunshots. He finds Tuco, and they agree to resume their old partnership. The pair kill Angel Eyes's men, but discover that Angel Eyes himself has escaped.\n\nTuco and Blondie travel toward Sad Hill, but their way is blocked by Union troops on one side of a strategic bridge, with Confederates on the other. Blondie decides to destroy the bridge to disperse the two armies to allow access to the cemetery. As they wire the bridge with explosives, Tuco suggests they share information, in case one person dies before he can help the other. Tuco reveals the name of the cemetery, while Blondie says \"Arch Stanton\" is the name on the grave. After the bridge explodes, the armies disperse, and Tuco steals a horse and rides to Sad Hill to claim the gold for himself. He finds Arch Stanton's grave and begins digging. Blondie arrives and encourages him at gunpoint to continue. A moment later, Angel Eyes surprises them both. Blondie opens Stanton's grave, revealing just a skeleton. Blondie states that he lied about the name on the grave, and offers to write the real name of the grave on a rock. Placing it face-down in the courtyard of the cemetery, he challenges Tuco and Angel Eyes to a three-way duel.\n\nThe trio stare each other down. Everyone draws, and Blondie shoots and kills Angel Eyes, while Tuco discovers that his own gun was unloaded by Blondie the night before. Blondie reveals that the gold is actually in the grave beside Arch Stanton's, marked \"Unknown\". Tuco is initially elated to find bags of gold, but Blondie holds him at gunpoint and orders him into a hangman's noose beneath a tree. Blondie binds Tuco's hands and forces him to stand balanced precariously atop an unsteady grave marker while he takes half the gold and rides away. As Tuco screams for mercy, Blondie returns into sight. Blondie severs the rope with a rifle shot, dropping Tuco, alive but tied up, onto his share of the gold. Tuco curses loudly while Blondie rides off into the horizon.\n\n\n\nAfter the success of \"For a Few Dollars More\", executives at United Artists approached the film's screenwriter, Luciano Vincenzoni, to sign a contract for the rights to the film and for the next one. He, producer Alberto Grimaldi and Sergio Leone had no plans, but with their blessing, Vincenzoni pitched an idea about \"a film about three rogues who are looking for some treasure at the time of the American Civil War\". The studio agreed, but wanted to know the cost for this next film. At the same time, Grimaldi was trying to broker his own deal, but Vincenzoni's idea was more lucrative. The two men struck an agreement with UA for a million-dollar budget, with the studio advancing $500,000 up front and 50% of the box office takings outside of Italy. The total budget would eventually be $1.2 million.\n\nLeone built upon the screenwriter's original concept to \"show the absurdity of war ... the Civil War which the characters encounter. In my frame of reference, it is useless, stupid: it does not involve a 'good cause.'\" An avid history buff, Leone said, \"I had read somewhere that 120,000 people died in Southern camps such as Andersonville. I was not ignorant of the fact that there were camps in the North. You always get to hear about the shameful behavior of the losers, never the winners.\" The Batterville Camp where Blondie and Tuco are imprisoned was based on steel engravings of Andersonville. Many shots in the film were influenced by archival photographs taken by Mathew Brady. As the film took place during the Civil War, it served as a prequel for the other two films in the trilogy, which took place after the war.\n\nWhile Leone developed Vincenzoni's idea into a script, the screenwriter recommended the comedy-writing team of Agenore Incrucci and Furio Scarpelli to work on it with Leone and Sergio Donati. According to Leone, \"I couldn't use a single thing they'd written. It was the grossest deception of my life.\" Donati agreed, saying, \"There was next to nothing of them in the final script. They only wrote the first part. Just one line.\" Vincenzoni claims that he wrote the screenplay in 11 days, but he soon left the project after his relationship with Leone soured. The three main characters all contain autobiographical elements of Leone. In an interview he said, \"[\"Sentenza\"] has no spirit, he's a professional in the most banal sense of the term. Like a robot. This isn't the case with the other two. On the methodical and careful side of my character, I'd be nearer \"il Biondo\" (\"Blondie\"): but my most profound sympathy always goes towards the \"Tuco\" side ... He can be touching with all that tenderness and all that wounded humanity.\" Film director Alex Cox suggests that the cemetery-buried gold hunted by the protagonists may have been inspired by rumours surrounding the anti-Communist Gladio terrorists, who hid many of their 138 weapons caches in cemeteries.\n\nEastwood received a percentage-based salary, unlike the first two films where he received a straight fee salary. When Lee Van Cleef was again cast for another \"Dollars\" film, he joked \"the only reason they brought me back was because they forgot to kill me off in \"For A Few Dollars More\"\".\n\nThe film's working title was \"I due magnifici straccioni\" (\"The Two Magnificent Tramps\"). It was changed just before shooting began when Vincenzoni thought up \"Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo\" (\"The Good, the Ugly, the Bad\"), which Leone loved. In the United States, United Artists considered using the original Italian translation, \"River of Dollars\", or \"The Man With No Name\", but decided on \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\".\n\nFilming began at the Cinecittà studio in Rome again in mid-May 1966, including the opening scene between Eastwood and Wallach when Blondie captures Tuco for the first time and sends him to jail. The production then moved on to Spain's plateau region near Burgos in the north, which doubled for the southwestern United States, and again shot the western scenes in Almería in the south of Spain. This time, the production required more elaborate sets, including a town under cannon fire, an extensive prison camp and an American Civil War battlefield; and for the climax, several hundred Spanish soldiers were employed to build a cemetery with several thousand gravestones to resemble an ancient Roman circus. For the scene where the bridge was blown up, it had to be filmed twice, as in the first take all three cameras were destroyed by the explosion. Eastwood remembers, \"They would care if you were doing a story about Spaniards and about Spain. Then they'd scrutinize you very tough, but the fact that you're doing a western that's supposed to be laid in southwest America or Mexico, they couldn't care less what your story or subject is.\" Top Italian cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli was brought in to shoot the film and was prompted by Leone to pay more attention to light than in the previous two films; Ennio Morricone composed the score once again. Leone was instrumental in asking Morricone to compose a track for the final Mexican stand-off scene in the cemetery, asking him to compose what felt like \"the corpses were laughing from inside their tombs\", and asked Delli Colli to create a hypnotic whirling effect interspersed with dramatic extreme close ups, to give the audience the impression of a visual ballet. Filming concluded in July 1966.\n\nEastwood was not initially pleased with the script and was concerned he might be upstaged by Wallach. \"In the first film I was alone,\" he told Leone. \"In the second, we were two. Here we are three. If it goes on this way, in the next one I will be starring with the American cavalry.\" As Eastwood played hard-to-get in accepting the role (inflating his earnings up to $250,000, another Ferrari and 10% of the profits in the United States when eventually released there), Eastwood was again encountering publicist disputes between Ruth Marsh, who urged him to accept the third film of the trilogy, and the William Morris Agency and Irving Leonard, who were unhappy with Marsh's influence on the actor. Eastwood banished Marsh from having any further influence in his career, and he was forced to sack her as his business manager via a letter sent by Frank Wells. For some time after, Eastwood's publicity was handled by Jerry Pam of Gutman and Pam. Throughout filming, Eastwood regularly socialized with actor Franco Nero, who was filming \"Texas, Adios\" at the time.\n\nWallach and Eastwood flew to Madrid together, and between shooting scenes Eastwood would relax and practice his golf swing. Wallach was almost poisoned during filming when he accidentally drank from a bottle of acid that a film technician had set next to his soda bottle. Wallach mentioned this in his autobiography and complained that while Leone was a brilliant director, he was very lax about ensuring the safety of his actors during dangerous scenes. For instance, in one scene, where he was to be hanged after a pistol was fired, the horse underneath him was supposed to bolt. While the rope around Wallach's neck was severed, the horse was frightened a little too well. It galloped for about a mile with Wallach still mounted and his hands bound behind his back. The third time Wallach's life was threatened was during the scene where he and Mario Brega—who are chained together—jump out of a moving train. The jumping part went as planned, but Wallach's life was endangered when his character attempts to sever the chain binding him to the (now dead) henchman. Tuco places the body on the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to roll over the chain and sever it. Wallach, and presumably the entire film crew, were not aware of the heavy iron steps that jutted one foot out of every box car. If Wallach had stood up from his prone position at the wrong time, one of the jutting steps could have decapitated him.\n\nThe bridge in the film was reconstructed twice by sappers of the Spanish army after being rigged for on-camera explosive demolition. The first time, an Italian camera operator signaled that he was ready to shoot, which was misconstrued by an army captain as the similar-sounding Spanish word meaning \"start\". Nobody was injured in the erroneous mistiming. The army rebuilt the bridge while other shots were filmed. As the bridge was not a prop, but a rather heavy and sturdy structure, powerful explosives were required to destroy it. Leone said that this scene was, in part, inspired by Buster Keaton's silent film \"The General\".\n\nAs an international cast was employed, actors performed in their native languages. Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach spoke English, and were dubbed into Italian for the debut release in Rome. For the American version, the lead acting voices were used, but supporting cast members were dubbed into English. The result is noticeable in the bad synchronization of voices to lip movements on screen; none of the dialogue is completely in sync because Leone rarely shot his scenes with synchronized sound. Various reasons have been cited for this: Leone often liked to play Morricone's music over a scene and possibly shout things at the actors to get them in the mood. Leone cared more for visuals than dialogue (his English was limited, at best). Given the technical limitations of the time, it would have been difficult to record the sound cleanly in most of the extremely wide shots Leone frequently used. Also, it was standard practice in Italian films at this time to shoot silently and post-dub. Whatever the actual reason, all dialogue in the film was recorded in post-production.\n\nLeone was unable to find an actual cemetery for the Sad Hill shootout scene, so the Spanish pyrotechnics chief hired 250 Spanish soldiers to build one in Carazo near Salas de los Infantes, which they completed in two days (at ).\n\nBy the end of filming, Eastwood had finally had enough of Leone's perfectionist directorial traits. Leone, often forcefully, insisted on shooting scenes from many different angles, paying attention to the most minute of details, which would often exhaust the actors. Leone, an obese glutton, was also a source of amusement for his excesses, and Eastwood found a way to deal with the stresses of being directed by him by making jokes about him and nicknamed him \"Yosemite Sam\" for his bad temperament. After the film was completed, Eastwood never worked with Leone again, later turning down the role as Harmonica in \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" (1968), for which Leone had personally flown to Los Angeles to give him the script. The role eventually went to Charles Bronson. Years later, Leone exacted his revenge upon Eastwood during the filming of \"Once Upon a Time in America\" (1984) when he described Eastwood's abilities as an actor as being like a block of marble or wax and inferior to the acting abilities of Robert De Niro, saying, \"Eastwood moves like a sleepwalker between explosions and hails of bullets, and he is always the same—a block of marble. Bobby first of all is an actor, Clint first of all is a star. Bobby suffers, Clint yawns.\" Eastwood later gave a friend the poncho he wore in the three films, where it was hung in a Mexican restaurant in Carmel, California.\n\nDirector Sergio Leone noted that the film's main theme is its emphasis on violence and the deconstruction of Old West romanticism. Like many of his films, \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" was considered by Leone as a satire of the Western genre. Critic Drew Marton described it as a \"baroque manipulation\" that criticizes the American ideology of the Western, by replacing the heroic cowboy popularized by John Wayne with morally complex antiheroes. Negative themes such as capitalism and greed were also given focus, and were traits shared by the three leads in the story. Many critics have also noticed the film's anti-war theme. Taking place in the American Civil War, the film takes the viewpoint of people such as civilians, bandits, and most notably soldiers, and presents their daily hardships during the war. Although not fighting in the war, the three gunslingers gradually become entangled in the battles that ensue (similar to \"The Great War\", a film that screenwriters Luciano Vincenzoni and Age & Scarpelli had contributed to).\n\nIn its depiction of violence, Leone used his signature long drawn and close-up style of filming, which he did by mixing extreme face shots and sweeping long shots. By doing so, Leone managed to stage epic sequences punctuated by extreme eyes and face shots, or hands slowly reaching on a holstered gun. This builds up the tension and suspense by allowing the viewers to savor the performances and character reactions, create a feel of excitement, as well as giving Leone the freedom to film beautiful landscapes. Leone also incorporated music to heighten up the tension and pressure before and during the film's many gunfights.\n\nIn filming the pivotal gunfights, Leone largely removes dialogue to focus more on the actions of the characters, which was important during the film's iconic Mexican standoff. This style can also be seen in one of the film's protagonists, Blondie (aka The Man with No Name), which is described by critics as more defined by his actions than his words. All three characters can be seen as anti-heroes killing for their personal gain. Leone also employed stylistic trick shooting, such as Blondie shooting the hat off a person's head and severing a hangman's noose with a well-placed shot, in many of its iconic shootouts.\n\n\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" opened in Italy on 23 December 1966, and grossed $6.3 million at that time.\n\nIn the United States, \"A Fistful of Dollars\" was released 18 January 1967 (28 months after its initial Italian release); \"For a Few Dollars More\" was released 10 May 1967 (17 months); and \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" was released 29 December 1967 (12 months). Thus, all three of Leone's Dollars Trilogy films were released in the United States during the same year. The original Italian domestic version was 177 minutes long, but the international version was shown at various lengths. Most prints, specifically those shown in the United States, had a runtime of 161 minutes, 16 minutes shorter than the Italian premiere version, but others, especially British prints, ran as short as 148 minutes.\n\nUpon release, \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" received criticism for its depiction of violence. Leone explains that \"the killings in my films are exaggerated because I wanted to make a tongue-in-cheek satire on run-of-the-mill westerns... The west was made by violent, uncomplicated men, and it is this strength and simplicity that I try to recapture in my pictures.\" To this day, Leone's effort to reinvigorate the timeworn Western is widely acknowledged.\n\nCritical opinion of the film on initial release was mixed, as many reviewers at that time looked down on \"spaghetti westerns\". In a negative review in \"The New York Times\", critic Renata Adler said that the film \"must be the most expensive, pious and repellent movie in the history of its peculiar genre.\" Charles Champlin of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that the \"temptation is hereby proved irresistible to call \"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly\", now playing citywide, \"The Bad, The Dull, and the Interminable\", only because it is.\" Roger Ebert, who later included the film in his list of Great Movies, retrospectively noted that in his original review he had \"described a four-star movie, but only gave it three stars, perhaps because it was a 'Spaghetti Western' and so could not be art.\" Ebert also points out Leone's unique perspective that enables the audience to be closer to the character as viewers see what he sees.\n\nDespite the initial negative reception by some critics, today, the film has since accumulated very positive feedback.\n\nIt is listed in \"Time\"'s \"100 Greatest Movies of the Last Century\" as selected by critics Richard Corliss and Richard Schickel. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 97% of film critics gave the film positive reviews. It is ranked #78 on the site's \"Top 100 Movies of All Time\". \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" has been described as European cinema's best representation of the Western genre film, and Quentin Tarantino has called it \"the best-directed film of all time\" and \"the greatest achievement in the history of cinema\". This was reflected in his votes for the 2002 and 2012 \"Sight & Sound\" magazine polls, in which he voted for \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" as his choice for the best film ever made. \"Variety\" magazine ranked the film number 49 on their list of the 50 greatest movies. In 2002, Film4 held a poll of the 100 Greatest Movies, on which \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" was voted in at number 46. \"Premiere\" magazine included the film on their \"100 Most Daring Movies Ever Made\" list. Mr. Showbiz ranked the film #81 on its \"100 Best Movies of All Time\" list.\n\n\"Empire\" magazine added \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" to their Masterpiece collection in the September 2007 issue, and in their poll of \"The 500 Greatest Movies\", \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" was voted in at number 25. In 2014, \"The Good the Bad and the Ugly\" was ranked the 47th greatest film ever made on \"Empire\"s list of \"The 301 Greatest Movies Of All Time\" as voted by the magazine's readers. It was also placed on a similar list of 1000 movies by \"The New York Times\". In 2014, \"Time Out\" polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films. \"The Good, The Bad And The Ugly\" placed 52nd on their list. Additionally, Films101.com ranked the film as the 152nd best movie of all time in a list of the 10,790 most notable.\n\nThe film was first released on VHS by VidAmerica in 1980, then Magnetic Video in 1981, CBS/Fox Video in 1983 and MGM Home Entertainment in 1990.\n\nThe film was first released on DVD by MGM Home Entertainment in 1998. The special features contain 14 minutes of scenes that were cut for the film's North American release, including a scene which explains how Angel Eyes came to be waiting for Blondie and Tuco at the Union prison camp.\n\nIn 2002, the film was restored with the 14 minutes of scenes cut for US release re-inserted into the film. Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach were brought back in to dub their characters' lines more than 35 years after the film's original release. Voice actor Simon Prescott substituted for Lee Van Cleef who had died in 1989. Other voice actors filled in for actors who had since died. In 2004, MGM released this version in a two-disc special edition DVD.\n\nDisc 1 contains an audio commentary with writer and critic Richard Schickel. Disc 2 contains two documentaries, \"Leone's West\" and \"The Man Who Lost The Civil War\", followed by the featurette \"Restoring 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly'\"; an animated gallery of missing sequences titled \"The Socorro Sequence: A Reconstruction\"; an extended Tuco torture scene; a featurette called \"Il Maestro\"; an audio featurette named \"Il Maestro, Part 2\"; a French trailer; and a poster gallery.\n\nThis DVD was generally well received, though some purists complained about the re-mixed stereo soundtrack with many completely new sound effects (notably, the gunshots were replaced), with no option for the original soundtrack. At least one scene that was re-inserted had been cut by Leone prior to the film's release in Italy, but had been shown once at the Italian premiere. According to Richard Schickel, Leone willingly cut the scene for pacing reasons; thus, restoring it was contrary to the director's wishes. MGM re-released the 2004 DVD edition in their \"Sergio Leone Anthology\" box set in 2007. Also included were the two other \"Dollars\" films, and \"Duck, You Sucker!\". On 12 May 2009, the extended version of the film was released on Blu-ray. It contains the same special features as the 2004 special edition DVD, except that it includes an added commentary by film historian Sir Christopher Frayling.\n\nThe film was re-released on Blu-ray in 2014 using a new 4K remaster, featuring improved picture quality and detail but a change of color timing, resulting in the film having a more yellow hue than on previous releases. It was rereleased on Blu-ray and DVD by Kino Lorber Studio Classics on August 15, 2017, in a new 50th Anniversary release that featured both theatrical and extended cuts, as well as new bonus features, and an attempt to correct the yellow color timing from the earlier disc.\n\nThe following scenes were originally deleted by distributors from the British and American theatrical versions of the film, but were restored after the release of the 2004 Special Edition DVD.\n\nA scene deleted by Leone after the Rome premiere was also re-inserted:\n\nAdditional footage of the sequence where Tuco is tortured by Angel Eyes's henchman was discovered. The original negative of this footage was deemed too badly damaged to be used in the theatrical cut, but the footage appears as an extra in the 2004 DVD supplementary features.\n\nLost footage of the missing Socorro Sequence where Tuco continues his search for Blondie in a Texican pueblo while Blondie is in a hotel room with a Mexican woman (Silvana Bacci) is reconstructed with photos and unfinished snippets from the French trailer. Also, in the documentary \"Reconstructing The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\", what looks to be footage of Tuco lighting cannons before the Ecstasy of Gold sequence appears briefly. None of these scenes or sequences appear in the 2004 re-release, however, but are in the supplementary features.\n\nThe score is composed by frequent Leone collaborator Ennio Morricone, whose distinctive original compositions, containing gunfire, whistling (by John O'Neill), and yodeling permeate the film. The main theme, resembling the howling of a coyote (which blends in with an actual coyote howl in the first shot after the opening credits), is a two-pitch melody that is a frequent motif, and is used for the three main characters. A different instrument was used for each: flute for Blondie, ocarina for Angel Eyes, and human voices for Tuco. The score complements the film's American Civil War setting, containing the mournful ballad, \"The Story of a Soldier\", which is sung by prisoners as Tuco is being tortured by Angel Eyes. The film's climax, a three-way Mexican standoff, begins with the melody of \"The Ecstasy of Gold\" and is followed by \"The Trio\". Today, the iconic theme is considered one of the greatest instrumental film scores of all time.\n\nThe main theme also titled \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" was a hit in 1968 with the soundtrack album on the charts for more than a year, reaching No. 4 on the \"Billboard\" pop album chart and No. 10 on the black album chart. The main theme was also a hit for Hugo Montenegro, whose rendition was a No. 2 \"Billboard\" pop single in 1968.\n\nIn popular culture, the American new wave group Wall of Voodoo performed a medley of Ennio Morricone's movie themes, including the theme for this movie. The only known recording of it is a live performance on \"The Index Masters\". Punk rock band the Ramones played this song as the opening for their live album \"Loco Live\" as well as in concerts until their disbandment in 1996. The British heavy metal band Motörhead played the main theme as the overture music on the 1981 \"No sleep 'til Hammersmith\" tour. American heavy metal band Metallica has run \"The Ecstasy of Gold\" as prelude music at their concerts since 1985 (except 1996–1998), and in 2007 recorded a version of the instrumental for a compilation tribute to Morricone. XM Satellite Radio's \"The Opie & Anthony Show\" also opens every show with \"The Ecstasy of Gold\". The American punk rock band The Vandals song \"Urban Struggle\" begins with the main theme. British electronica act Bomb the Bass used the main theme as one of a number of samples on their 1988 single \"Beat Dis\", and used sections of dialogue from Tuco's hanging on \"Throughout The Entire World\", the opening track from their 1991 album \"Unknown Territory\". The main theme was also sampled/re-created by British band New Order for the album version of their 1993 single \"Ruined in a Day\". A song from the band Gorillaz is named \"Clint Eastwood\", and features references to the actor, along with a repeated sample of the theme song; the iconic yell featured in \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\"'s score is heard at the beginning of the music video.\n\nThe film's title has entered the English language as an idiomatic expression. Typically used when describing something thoroughly, the respective phrases refer to upsides, downsides and the parts that could, or should have been done better, but were not.\n\nThe film was novelized in 1967 by Joe Millard as part of the \"Dollars Western\" series based on the \"Man with No Name\". The South Korean western movie \"The Good, the Bad, the Weird\" (2008) is inspired by the film, with much of its plot and character elements borrowed from Leone's film. In his introduction to the 2003 revised edition of his novel \"\", Stephen King revealed that the film was a primary influence for the Dark Tower series, and that Eastwood's character specifically inspired the creation of King's protagonist, Roland Deschain.\n\n\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" is the last film in the Dollars Trilogy, and thus does not have an official sequel. Following the film's release, Leone went on to direct two more Westerns (\"Once Upon a Time in the West\" and \"Duck, You Sucker!\") and was involved in the production of other Spaghetti Westerns (\"My Name Is Nobody\" and \"A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe\"), but none of these bore direct relations with his previous films.\n\nHowever, screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni stated on numerous occasions that he had written a treatment for a sequel, tentatively titled \"Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo n. 2\" \"(The Good, the Bad and the Ugly 2)\". According to Vincenzoni and Eli Wallach, the film would have been set 20 years after the original, and would have followed Tuco pursuing Blondie's grandson for the gold. Clint Eastwood expressed interest in taking part in the film's production, including acting as narrator. Joe Dante and Leone were also approached to direct and produce the film respectively. Eventually, however, the project was vetoed by Leone, as he did not want the original film's title or characters to be reused, nor did he want to be involved in another Western film.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The screenplay by John Kneubuhl and Henry Slesar is based on a story by Slesar.\n\nIt was the first in a series of low budget suspense dramas for Warner Bros, the others being \"My Blood Runs Cold\" and \"Brainstorm\".(There was meant to be a fourth, \"The Thing at the Door\", but it ended up not being made). These were inspired by the success of William Castle films.\nA prologue introduces the audience to John Harley Duquesne, a psychotic magician who accidentally beheads his wife Melinda with a guillotine during a performance. Twenty years later he dies, and his will requires his daughter Cassie (the mirror image of her mother) to spend seven nights in his apparently haunted mansion in order to inherit his estate.\n\nReporter Val Henderson offers to stay with her when he learns Duquesne promised to return in spirit form during Cassie's week-long vigil. As the days pass, the two encounter a number of spooky happenings, leading to a climax in which the not-really-dead Duquesne attempts a recreation of his guillotine trick, this time with his daughter as an unwilling assistant who hopefully won't lose her head.\n\nIn a climactic fight, Henderson tries to prevent Duquesne from activating the guillotine, but himself accidentally releases the catch; a \"dummy\"'s head falls from the guillotine causing Duquesne to go insane thinking his daughter has been killed. Henderson rescues Cassie as the police come to arrest Duquesne.\n\nThe film was one of a series of movies Warner Bros financed by television directors in this case William Conrad.(Other such directors included Lamont Johnson and Jack Smight.)\n\nFilming started June 1964.\n\nStevens was under contract with Warner Bros. She said \"I thought the script was stupid when I read it but I came away thinking, 'yeah, it could have happened.' That's the challenge, to make something like this believable.\"\n\nStevens made the film right before her series \"Wendy and Me\". She said the film \"could have been a class A thriller if they'd spent more money on it.\" However she noted it got Conrad a seven year contract with the studio.\nIn his review in \"The New York Times\", Howard Thompson called the film \"a dull, silly, tedious clinker\" and \"an old-fashioned, haunted-house spooker.\" The \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"an unusually appealing love story\" with \"genuinely spine-tingling suspense.\"\n\n\"TV Guide\" rates it two out of a possible four stars, calling it \"a standard haunted house thriller.\"\n\nThe film was released via DVD on 22 June 2010.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50054074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50054074", "title": "University Cinema Scala", "text": "University Cinema Scala\n\nUniversity Cinema Scala is a cinema in Brno in the Czech Republic. It is located at Moravské náměstí (Moravian Square) in the basement of building 127/3, city quarter Brno-střed and neighbourhood Brno-město. It has been in operation since 1929 and was at times also called Bio Dopz and Kino Moskva (Moscow Cinema). Since the autumn of 2013, it has been run by Masaryk University and the Aeropolis company as the first university cinema in the Czech Republic. Besides regular film screenings, it also serves as a representative space and a lecture and conference hall used for academic purposes.\n\nThe first mobile cinematographs appear edin Brno in 1896 and the first permanent cinema opened in 1907. However, the current University Cinema Scala only opened about 20 years later, when there were already a number of other cinemas in the city: Centrál (the first cinema, that opened in 1907), Edison (1908), Varieté (later turned into the Divadlo Radost theatre), Oránia (1911), Lidový biograf (1911), and other ones. Scala opened in a new building called the DOPZ Palace, which was built at Moravské náměstí (then called Lažanského náměstí) probably between 1927 and 1928.\n\nDOPZ was an acronym of the cooperative society \"Družstvo obchodních a průmyslových zaměstnanců\" (full name \"Stavební a obchodní družstvo zaměstnanců obchodu a průmyslu, zapsaná společnost s ručením omezeným\") that had owned the whole building since September 1927. Though the cinema was originally called Bio Dopz, it was not run by the cooperative, but by a foundation designed to support university students in Moravia and Silesia named after T. G. Masaryk (\"Masarykův fond na podporu studentstva vysokých škol na Moravě a ve Slezsku\"). The foundation asked for a licence to operate a cinematograph as early as on 11 July 1922, and on 28 December 1923 it was granted a licence to operate the Bristol cinema in Křenová street valid until the end of 1926. However, the foundation found it difficult to acquire the premises needed to run a cinema and so it kept looking at other places – such as the cinema Universum in Lidická (then called Nová) street or a hall in the new Nový domov building in Gorkého (Folkensteinerova) street – until the licence expired. The foundation was promised a new licence in April 1927 and in June 1928, it was offered by DOPZ to run a cinema in its building (DOPZ Palace) located between two squares – Moravské náměstí and Jakubské náměstí (Jacobian Square). Accordingly, it asked for a new licence on 24 September 1928. After some disputes with the local authorities, the foundation was granted a preliminary licence on 27 December 1929 and a full licence on 6 March 1930. While it was trying to obtain a licence, the premises of the cinema were acquired by the company Kraus a spol. On 20 December 1929, the foundation entered into an agreement with the company valid until the end of 1935. According to the agreement, the company set up and run the cinema using the licence acquired by the foundation; in return, it paid 8% of its gross revenue to the foundation. In its turn, the foundation was paying 40% of its net gains to three different associations.\n\nThe cinema opened on 28 December 1929 with a screening of the American sound film romance \"White Shadows in the South Seas\" which received an Oscar for best cinematography. At the time, the cinema was managed by Rudolf Valenta, and since 1930 by Rudolf Urban. The entrance fee ranged between 3 and 7 Czechoslovak crowns. While the overall earnings are unknown, the foundation received a yearly share of 189,077, 160,642, and 121,782 crowns in 1930, 1931, and 1932 respectively.\n\nFor commercial reasons, the name of the cinema was changed to Scala on 3 December 1935. At that time, the licence was nearing its expiration date. The foundation asked for the licence to be extended in February 1936; the application was refused on 31 March 1936 and the local authorities requested that the cinema should be closed by the end of 1936. In October 1937, the Scala licence was granted to a police headquarters association \"Jubilejní ozdravovna policejního ředitelství v Brně\". This association received 5.5% of net revenue from the Kraus company, which amounted to 85,075 and 82,832 crowns in 1937 and 1938 respectively, and it was required to transfer 2% to other associations.\n\nIn the following years, the operation of the cinema was impacted by the German occupation. Among other things, the contribution to the Masaryk foundation was cancelled and substituted by a contribution to Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt (NSV). On 4 December 1941, the DOPZ buildings were purchased by the insurance company and on 14 July 1942, the cinema premises were rented by Fritz Lord and Josef Veselý, who began to operate the cinema. They asked for a cinema licence as early as on 2 June 1941 and received it on 7 April 1944. With the arrival of the battlefront on 15 April 1945, the cinema was forced to suspend its operation. The cinema building burned out, as well as the neighbouring buildings, but the basement premises of the cinema were left untouched. After the most necessary repairs of the entrance, the cinema opened for provisional screenings on 9 May 1945 and normal operation resumed on 2 June, after foyer refurbishments, with the screening of a film by Martin Frič \"The Second Shift\".\n\nA nationalization decree from 11 September 1945 nationalized the film industry, production, and distribution including all cinemas. The state-owned enterprise Československý státní film became the authority that supervised the whole industry. On 25 September 1946, Lažanského náměstí (Lažanský Square) was renamed náměstí Rudé armády (Red Army Square) and the cinema later followed suit: on 15 October 1948, it was renamed Moskva (Moscow). In the early 1950s, the fire-damaged building as well as the adjacent houses were reconstructed and the former DOPZ Palace was replaced by an ostentatious building of Hutní projekt built in the style of socialist realism by a Brno architect Lubor Lacina.\n\nA government decree from 16 January 1957 assigned the management of cinemas to \"national committees\" (local authority councils). Brno established \"Správa městských kin\", an organisation tasked with managing the city cinemas and led by Antonín Kalášek as its first director, which took over all 29 cinemas in Brno including Moskva from the previous organisation, Krajský filmový podnik. As the cinema was also being reconstructed in 1957, it was closed between 16 June and 21 November that year. It opened on 21 November with a screening of a French-Italian film \"The Best Part\" (\"La Meilleure part\") starring Gérard Philipe.\n\nFrom 21 September 1968, the cinema was renamed back to Scala for a short period of time, but after 26 September 1969 it was called Moskva again. The cinema was closed for repairs between 1971 and 1973, when it was adapted for 70mm films and stereophonic sound. The cinema opened again on 22 November 1973 with a ceremony that included the screening of the movie \"The Siberian Woman\" (\"Сибирячка\") by director Aleksei Saltykov to invited guests; regular screenings for the public began on the following day. In the 1980s, the Moskva cinema was one of the best in the city, together with other cinemas in the city centre such as the Družba, Praha, Jalta, and Úderka cinemas. At the same time, it boasted the best equipment in Brno after the above-mentioned reconstruction.\n\nIn 1991 – after the Velvet Revolution – the cinema returned to its original name Scala. \"Kulturní a informační centrum města Brna\" (Brno Cultural and Information Centre) was established the same year and merged with the \"Správa městských kin\" organisation in November 1994; since 1 January 1995, Scala was officially managed by this new centre. In October 1999, the first multiplex opened in the Olympia shopping mall in Brno: the second in the Czech Republic (Galaxie in Prague was the first) and the first one that met European standards. That year, Scala was the 7th most visited cinema in the Czech Republic with 99,000 visitors, but Olympia already ranked higher and took the 6th place with 120,000 visitors. The second multiplex in Brno, Velký Špalíček, opened in 2001 and single-screen cinemas started closing one by one during the next five years. Scala thus remained one of the last single-screen cinemas in Brno, together with Art and Lucerna. The operator of the city cinemas filed a complaint to the Office for the Protection of Competition against the preferential treatment that multiplexes received from distributors, but was not successful.\n\nAt the time, the cinemas were already operated by \"Brněnské kulturní centrum\" (Brno Cultural Centre), a new organisation established as of 1 January 2005, when the Brno Cultural and Information Centre was split into two independent centres (the other one was \"Turistické informační centrum\" – Tourist Information Office). However, both centres were reunited in 2008 as Brno Cultural Centre and further organisational changes followed even after that. The number of visitors to the large-scale auditorium in Scala dropped below 16,000 for the first 10 months of 2009; this was 24 times and 30 times less than the rate for the two Brno multiplexes, respectively, and even less than the rate for the smaller Art cinema. Besides a less attractive dramaturgy and the policies of film distributors, the head manager of the city cinemas Daniel Zásměta claimed the cinema needed a large-scale reconstruction, which was made impossible by an action to ascertain the ownership of the building that had been filed by the city of Brno and was of many years' standing. Moreover, Moravské náměstí was being reconstructed in 2009–2010, which made the neighbourhood temporarily less attractive for visitors. The average number of visitors to Scala in 2010 was 37 and the total number per year was 27,713.\n\nOn 21 June 2011, the Brno city council approved a change in the deed of foundation of the cinema operator, the Brno Cultural Centre. It changed its name to \"Turistické informační centrum\" (Tourist Information Centre) and accordingly, the main focus of its activities shifted from culture towards tourism and marketing. While the Art cinema was modernised and digitalised, the city decided to close Scala down. On 5 October, the Brno city council agreed to end the cinema operation by 31 December 2011. The last screening for the public, showing a Canadian co-production film \"Mr. Nobody\", took place on 21 December 2011, and the last screening for schoolchildren took place the next morning.\n\nThe academic staff of the Department of Film Studies and Audiovisual Culture, Faculty of Arts at Masaryk University protested against the decision to close the cinema and started a petition to keep the cinema in operation. Before releasing a tender, the city of Brno offered to lease the cinema to the Masaryk University for the symbolic yearly rent of one Czech crown and the university expressed an interest in this offer. In March 2012, the university confirmed that it was interested in renting the cinema and announced that it had a partner for the cinema operation. After further negotiations, the Brno city council approved the main points of the contract draft on 27 March 2013 and on 17 April it approved a 30-year lease of the cinema for 1.8 million crowns (€66,600 as of April 2016) a year.\n\nThe basic refurbishing of the cinema before its reopening was finished by the end of September 2013. The cost of the refurbishing and subsequent digitalisation of the projection equipment was 12 million crowns. The repairs were paid for by the city of Brno, which then received the money back from the university in the form of rent. The university partnered with Aeropolis, a cinema operator that had already had some experience with running independent cinemas in Prague and Hradec Králové and was charged with ensuring year-round film screenings. Moreover, the university began to use the cinema for academic purposes as a lecture and conference hall and space for graduation and matriculation ceremonies. The cinema opened for the public on 14 October 2013 with a ceremony that included the screening of a unique interactive film project \"Kinoautomat: Člověk a jeho dům\".\n\nThe cinema was originally established as a part of the multi-purpose DOPZ Palace building. In the late 1920s, the building consisted of offices, a large conference, dance, and theatre hall on the ground floor, the Biber cafe on the first and second floors and the cinema itself in the basement.\n\nThe basement location was originally a problem, as the lowest point in the auditorium was more than below the pavement level by the main entrance at Moravské náměstí (then called Lažanského náměstí), while the then-applicable ministerial decree only allowed a depth of . For this reason, the local authorities refused to approve the licence application on 31 October 1928. The re-submitted application therefore cited the entrance from Jakubské náměstí, which lies below Moravské náměstí, as the main entrance, and the relative depth of the auditorium was thus reduced to . The number of seats was also determined during the occupancy permit procedure: 562 seats in the stalls and 238 on the balconies, altogether 800 seats, which was the maximum capacity allowed by the ministerial decree for underground cinemas. During the remodelling of the cinema in 1931, the operator received a permission to change the seating arrangements in the auditorium: by removing the boxes on the sides, the cinema was able to offer 304 seats on the balconies and 702 stalls seats (altogether 1,006 seats). There were further changes in May of the same year that brought the seating capacity of the cinema up to 700 + 312 or 1,012 seats. Measured by seating capacity, Bio Dopz was the largest cinema in Brno. In 1932, the waiting room was turned into a smoking lounge; afterwards, the foyer served as the waiting space.\n\nIn 1957, the cinema was rebuilt for widescreen projection using the CinemaScope system. At the same time, the balcony on the sides of the auditorium was demolished and new seats were installed and rearranged to provide 550 seats in the stalls and 200 on the balcony. The original spiral staircase was also removed as well as the projection box, which was moved to another part of the basement with an entrance right next to the auditorium entrance. The cash desk in the upper foyer was divided into two.\n\nThe cinema obtained equipment allowing panoramic 70mm film projection during the next round of remodelling and repairs, which took place in 1971–1973 based on a project prepared by architect Jaroslav Šmídek. The projection box received two UM 70/35 projectors and one ME 9 projector and a 6-channel amplifier system was installed to ensure stereo sound. The smoking lounge was turned into a bar; the cash desks were moved opposite the entrance staircase and an office took their place. Again, new seats were installed in the auditorium: the new arrangement saw the seating capacity decrease to 328 stalls seats and 145 balcony seats (altogether 473 seats). Thanks to these changes, the Moskva cinema, as it was called at the time, became the best-equipped cinema in Brno.\n\nThe latest refurbishing took place in 2013, when the cinema obtained digital equipment for projection in 4K and in the Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 sound format.\n\n"}

He became one of the most recorded musicians of his day, recording marches, cakewalks, and rags. He also accompanied popular singers, such as Arthur Collins and Len Spencer.\n\nOssman married Eunice Smith and they had three children, Vess Jr., Raymond, and Annadele.\n\nIn 1900 and 1903, when Ossman's reputation and fame had spread internationally, he toured England and recorded. With Audley Dudley and Roy Butin he performed in the Ossman-Dudley Trio. He led his own dance band, the Ossman's Singing and Playing Orchestra, in Dayton, Ohio, and Indianapolis, Indiana. The increasing popularity of his rival Fred Van Eps, after 1910, made Ossman's name appear less frequently in record company supplements. He temporarily ceased recording in 1913 but resumed in late 1915. In April 1917, he became a member of the Popular Talking Machine Artists, a group of unrelated musicians who toured as an act.
