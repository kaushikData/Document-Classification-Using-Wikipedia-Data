It is a direct-to-video spin-off sequel to the films \"\" and \"\", without involvement from either lead actor Jim Carrey nor writer Steve Oedekerk. The film began production in Orlando, Florida on September 17, 2007, was directed by David M. Evans and written by Jeff Sank, Jason Heimberg, and Justin Heimberg.\n\nVentura must follow in his father's (\"Ace Ventura Sr.'s\") footsteps to save his mother from going to jail.\n\nIn the beginning, Ace is chasing a woman. He catches her, and walks straight into the alligator habitat. Later in a dream Ace sees a panda ,Ting Tang, being captured. Soon his mother is blamed for the theft. She asks if she can make one phone call. She calls Rex Ventura, Ace's paternal grandfather. Rex tells Ace the history of the Ventura Family and their relationship with animals. Rex Ventura is an elderly man with several animals such as a cat, a turtle and a dog which Ace thinks is dead.\n\nAt his mother's trial, Ace Jr. presents evidence that proves his mother couldn't have committed the crime of stealing Ting-Tang the panda; however, the Ranger (the one that Ace doesn't like), dismisses the evidence and Ace's mother is ultimately taken to jail.\n\nAt school the next day, Ace hears that many of his classmates, including his crush, Laura (Emma Lockhart), have brutally murdered their pets. Laura has killed her pet emerald green koi fish. Ace goes to school the next day and talks to a boy nicknamed A-Plus. A-Plus has a hidden lab in his locker, which Ace uses as his office. They believe a scientist named Dr. Sickinger (Cullen Douglas), who's also somewhat insane, is the panda thief, primarily because he created a website called \"PandaHub.\" However, Sickinger is ultimately proven innocent and ends up working with the kids to find out who the real culprit is. The kids discover that Sickinger used to work for Quenton Pennington Jr. (Reed Alexander), a rich kid whose family motto is, \"What a Pennington wants a Pennington gets.\" In the end Ace finds that Pennington Sr. (Brian Patrick Clarke) stole Ting Tang, as well as a bunch of other famous animals (Tabby the tabby, Princess the lap dog, Freedom the hawk, and Callypso the magic horse), and that Pennington Jr. stole Ace's classmates' pets. His mother's name is finally cleared and is rewarded for his heroics. At this point in the movie, it is also discovered that Ace has been using extreme hallucinogens such as LSD throughout the whole film, and that the entire story is just a figment of Ace's imagination whilst high.\n\nAce's father does not appear in this film. Until Rex comes in, whenever Ace Jr. would ask his mom about his dad, she would simply tell him that he had disappeared on a business trip when he was a baby and wouldn't go into any greater detail. However, before she's taken to jail (before Rex comes in), she elaborates on what happened to Ace Sr.: when their son was still just a baby, Ace had rescued a group of endangered animals and while flying them to safety, the airplane that they were in disappeared somewhere over the Bermuda Triangle, and Ace Ventura Sr. was never seen or heard from again after that.\n\n\nThe film received largely negative critical reception. \"Film Threat\" gave the film 1½ stars out of 5, stating \"It's disappointing that this is the next, and most likely final step of the Ace Ventura franchise.\" \"Common Sense Media\" gave it 2 out of 5 stars, summing the film up as a \"Funny, animal-loving kid lost in crude script.\" \"Movie Metropolis\" also gave a negative review, stating \"What was pretty juvenile in the first place becomes literally juvenile in this straightforward kids' romp. If I were a kid, I might like it. But I'm not a kid, and I didn't.\"\n\n"}

It has produced numerous television shows which have been broadcast in Ireland, including \"Delegation\", \"Livin' with Lucy\", \"Hanging with Hector\", \"The Fame Game\", and \"Fáilte Towers\" for Radio Telefís Éireann, and \"Glas Vegas\" and \"Underdogs\" for TG4. The company is credited with discovering numerous television presenters.\n\nAdare Productions was established in 1993. The company claims to have produced at least fourteen different entertainment series, eleven young peoples' series, four different lifestyle series, more than three hundred hours of live studio programmes and more than forty hours of music programmes. It has discovered presenters such as Caroline Morahan, Lucy Kennedy and Hector Ó hEochagáin.\n\nLynda McQuaid has been executive producer on \"Fáilte Towers\" and producer and director on \"The Apprentice\".\n\n\"Underdogs\" was a television programme broadcast on TG4. It featured \"underdog\" players of Gaelic games, focusing on those individuals who had never played senior inter-county football or hurling or received a nomination for a GAA All-Star, and offering them the chance to compete against teams of high quality. The first series was specifically dedicated to male footballers and hurlers. In June 2008, Adare Productions requested female applications for a follow-up series of \"The Underdogs\". Brian Mullins managed the winning team which competed against the All-Ireland champions the following December.\n\n\"Glas Vegas\", which was first broadcast on TG4 in August 2007, saw the introduction of a new presenter, Gemma Ní Chionnaith.\n\n\"Fáilte Towers\" was broadcast on RTÉ One in August 2008, succeeding such shows as \"Cabin Fever\" and \"Celebrity Farm\". A reality style television programme in a brand new format, it was presented by Aidan Power and Bazil Ashmawy and the concept involved thirteen celebrities running a hotel for sixteen days and nights in order to win money for their designated charities. It was unpopular with critics but enjoyed by the general public, with the final receiving nearly a million viewers and the entire series regularly receiving between 350,000 and 450,000 viewers throughout its run. The format for the show even attracted interest from overseas buyers, including investors from England, but RTÉ said at the time that “no agreements [would] be reached until the current series has finished”. Nevertheless, the \"Irish Independent\" named \"Fáilte Towers\" as one of the six worst television programmes of 2008, describing it as \"car crash television\".\n\n"}

{"id": "32255505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32255505", "title": "Bechdel test", "text": "Bechdel test\n\nThe Bechdel test ( ) is a measure of the representation of women in fiction. It asks whether a work features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man. The requirement that the two women must be named is sometimes added.\n\nAbout half of all films meet these criteria, according to user-edited databases and the media industry press. The test is used as an indicator for the active presence of women in films and other fiction, and to call attention to gender inequality in fiction.\n\nAlso known as the Bechdel–Wallace test, it is named after the American cartoonist Alison Bechdel, in whose comic strip, \"Dykes to Watch Out For\", the test first appeared, in 1985. Bechdel credited the idea to a friend, Liz Wallace, and to the writings of Virginia Woolf. After the test became more widely discussed in the 2000s, a number of variants and tests inspired by it have been introduced.\n\nIn her 1929 essay \"A Room of One's Own\", Virginia Woolf observed about the literature of her time what the Bechdel test would later highlight in more recent fiction:\n\nIn film, a study of gender portrayals in 855 of the most financially successful U.S. films from 1950 to 2006 showed that there were, on average, two male characters for each female character, a ratio that remained stable over time. Female characters were portrayed as being involved in sex twice as often as male characters, and their proportion of scenes with explicit sexual content increased over time. Violence increased over time in male and female characters alike.\n\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, in 120 films made worldwide from 2010 to 2013, only 31% of named characters were female, and 23% of the films had a female protagonist or co-protagonist. 7% of directors were women. Another study looking at the 700 top‐grossing films from 2007 to 2014 found that only 30% of the speaking characters were female. In a 2016 analysis of screenplays of 2,005 commercially successful films, Hanah Anderson and Matt Daniels found that in 82% of the films, men had two of the top three speaking roles, while a woman had the most dialogue in only 22% of films.\n\nThe rules now known as the Bechdel test first appeared in 1985 in Alison Bechdel's comic strip \"Dykes To Watch Out For\". In a strip titled \"The Rule\", two women, who resemble the future characters Mo and Ginger, discuss seeing a film and one woman explains that she only goes to a movie if it satisfies the following requirements:\n\nThe other woman acknowledges that the idea is pretty strict, but good. Not finding any films that meet their requirements, they go home together.\n\nThe test has also been referred to as the \"Bechdel–Wallace test\" (which Bechdel herself prefers), the \"Bechdel rule\", \"Bechdel's law\", or the \"Mo Movie Measure\". Bechdel credited the idea for the test to a friend and karate training partner, Liz Wallace, whose name appears in the marquee of the strip. She later wrote that she was pretty certain that Wallace was inspired by Virginia Woolf's essay \"A Room of One's Own\".\n\nOriginally meant as \"a little lesbian joke in an alternative feminist newspaper\", according to Bechdel, the test moved into mainstream criticism in the 2010s and has been described as \"the standard by which feminist critics judge television, movies, books, and other media\". In 2013, an Internet newspaper described it as \"almost a household phrase, common shorthand to capture whether a film is woman-friendly\". The failure of major Hollywood productions such as \"Pacific Rim\" (2013) to pass the test was addressed in depth in the media.\n\nAccording to Neda Ulaby, the test resonates because \"it articulates something often missing in popular culture: not the number of women we see on screen, but the depth of their stories, and the range of their concerns.\" Dean Spade and Craig Willse described the test as a \"commentary on how media representations enforce harmful gender norms\" by depicting women's relationships to men more than any other relationships, and women's lives as important only insofar as they relate to men.\n\nSeveral variants of the test have been proposed—for example, that the two women must be named characters, or that there must be at least a total of 60 seconds of conversation. The test has also attracted academic interest from a computational analysis approach. In June 2018, the Bechdel test was added to the Oxford English Dictionary.\n\nIn 2013, four Swedish cinemas and the Scandinavian cable television channel Viasat Film incorporated the Bechdel test into some of their ratings, a move supported by the Swedish Film Institute.\n\nIn 2014, the European cinema fund Eurimages incorporated the Bechdel test into its submission mechanism as part of an effort to collect information about gender equality in its projects. It requires \"a Bechdel analysis of the script to be supplied by the script readers\".\n\nIn 2018, screenwriting software developers began incorporating functions that allow writers to analyze their scripts for gender representation. Software with such functions includes Highland 2, WriterDuet and the forthcoming Final Draft 11.\n\nIn addition to films, the Bechdel test has been applied to other media such as video games and comics. In theater, British actor Beth Watson launched a \"Bechdel Theatre\" campaign in 2015 that aims to highlight test-passing plays.\n\nThe website \"bechdeltest.com\" is a user-edited database of some 6,500 films classified by whether they pass the test, with the added requirement that the women must be \"named\" characters. , it listed 58% of these films as passing all three of the test's requirements, 10% as failing one, 22% as failing two, and 10% as failing all three.\n\nAccording to Mark Harris of \"Entertainment Weekly\", if passing the test were mandatory, it would have jeopardized half of the 2009 Academy Award for Best Picture nominees. The news website \"Vocativ\", when subjecting the top-grossing films of 2013 to the Bechdel test, concluded that roughly half of them passed (although some dubiously) and the other half failed.\n\nWriter Charles Stross noted that about half of the films that \"do\" pass the test only do so because the women talk about marriage or babies. Works that fail the test include some that are mainly about or aimed at women, or which do feature prominent female characters. The television series \"Sex and the City\" highlights its own failure to pass the test by having one of the four female main characters ask: \"How does it happen that four such smart women have nothing to talk about but boyfriends? It's like seventh grade with bank accounts!\"\n\n\"Vocativ\"s authors also found that the films from 2013 that passed the test earned a total of $4.22 billion in the United States, while those that failed earned $2.66 billion in total, leading them to conclude that a way for Hollywood to make more money might be to \"put more women onscreen.\" A 2014 study by FiveThirtyEight based on data from about 1,615 films released from 1990 to 2013 concluded that the median budget of films that passed the test was 35% lower than that of the others. It found that the films that passed the test had about a 37 percent higher return on investment (ROI) in the United States, and the same ROI internationally, compared to films that did not pass the test.\n\nExplanations that have been offered as to why many films fail the Bechdel test include the relative lack of gender diversity among scriptwriters and other movie professionals, also called the \"celluloid ceiling\": In 2012, only one in six of the directors, writers, and producers behind the 100 most commercially successful movies in the United States was a woman.\n\nWriting in \"National Review\" in 2017, film critic Kyle Smith suggested that the reason for the Bechdel test results was that \"Hollywood movies are about people on the extremes of society — cops, criminals, superheroes — [which] tend to be men\", and that such films were more often created by men because \"women's movie ideas\", mostly about relationships according to Smith, \"aren't commercial enough for Hollywood studios\". He considered the Bechdel test just as meaningless as a test asking whether a film contained cowboys. Smith's article provoked vigorous criticism. Alessandra Maldonado and Liz Bourke wrote that Smith was wrong to contend that female authors do not write books that generate \"big movie ideas\", citing J. K. Rowling, Margaret Atwood and Nnedi Okorafor among others as counter-examples.\n\nThe Bechdel test only indicates whether women are present in a work of fiction to a certain degree. A work may pass the test and still contain sexist content, and a work with prominent female characters may fail the test. A work may fail the test for reasons unrelated to gender bias, such as because its setting works against the inclusion of women (e.g., Umberto Eco's \"The Name of the Rose\", set in a medieval monastery). What counts as a character or as a conversation is not defined (e.g., the Sir Mix-a-Lot song \"Baby Got Back\" has been described as passing the Bechdel test, because it begins with audio of a valley girl saying \"oh my god, Becky, look at her butt\") and works with very few of either will often fail the test automatically.\n\nIn an attempt at a quantitative analysis of works as to whether they pass the test, at least one researcher, Faith Lawrence, noted that the results depend on how rigorously the test is applied. One of the questions arising from its application is whether a reference to a man at any point within a conversation that also covers other topics invalidates the entire exchange. If not, the question remains how one defines the start and end of a conversation.\n\nIn response to its increasing ubiquity in film criticism, the Bechdel test has been criticized for not taking into account the quality of the works it tests (bad films may pass it, and good ones fail), or as a \"nefarious plot to make all movies conform to feminist dogma\". According to Andi Zeisler, this criticism indicates the problem that the test's utility \"has been elevated way beyond the original intention. Where Bechdel and Wallace expressed it as simply a way to point out the rote, unthinkingly normative plotlines of mainstream film, these days passing it has somehow become synonymous with 'being feminist'. It was never meant to be a measure of feminism, but rather a cultural barometer.\" Zeisler noted that the false assumption that a work that passes the test is \"feminist\" might lead to creators \"gaming the system\" by adding just enough women characters and dialogue to pass the test, while continuing to deny women substantial representation outside of formulaic plots.\n\nSimilarly, the \"Telegraph\" film critic Robbie Collin disapproved of the test as prizing \"box-ticking and stat-hoarding over analysis and appreciation\", and suggested that the underlying problem of the lack of well-drawn female characters in film ought to be a topic of discourse, rather than individual films failing or passing the Bechdel test. \"FiveThirtyEight\"s writer Walt Hickey noted that the test does not measure whether any one film is a model of gender equality, and that passing it does not ensure the quality of writing, significance or depth of female roles—but, he wrote, \"it's the best test on gender equity in film we have—and, perhaps more important ..., the only test we have data on\".\n\nNina Power wrote that the test raises the questions of whether fiction has a duty to represent women (rather than to pursue whatever the creator's own agenda might be) and to be \"realistic\" in the representation of women. She also wrote that it remained to be determined how often real life passes the Bechdel test, and what the influence of fiction on that might be.\n\nThe Bechdel test has inspired others, notably feminist and antiracist critics and fans, to formulate criteria for evaluating works of fiction, in part because of the Bechdel test's limitations. In interviews conducted by FiveThirtyEight, women in the film and television industry proposed many other tests that included more women, better stories, women behind the scenes, and more diversity.\n\nThe \"Mako Mori test\", formulated by Tumblr user \"Chaila\" and named after the only significant female character of the 2013 film \"Pacific Rim\", asks whether a female character has a narrative arc that is not about supporting a man's story. (In the sequel Pacific Rim Uprising, Mori failed the test by dying a few minutes into the film to further her brother's story.) Comic book writer Kelly Sue DeConnick proposed a \"sexy lamp test\": \"If you can replace your female character with a sexy lamp and the story still basically works, maybe you need another draft.\"\n\nThe \"Sphinx test\" by the Sphinx theater company of London asks about the interaction of women with other characters, as well as how prominently women characters feature in the action, how proactive rather than reactive they are, and whether they are portrayed stereotypically. It was conceived to \"encourage theatremakers to think about how to write more and better roles for women\", in reaction to research indicating that only 37% of theater roles were written for women .\n\nThe \"Vito Russo test\" created by the LGBT organization GLAAD tests for the representation of LGBT characters in films. It asks: Does the film contain a character that is identifiably LGBT, and is not solely or predominantly defined by their sexual orientation or gender identity, as well as tied into the plot in such a way that their removal would have a significant effect?\n\nA test proposed by TV critic Eric Deggans asks whether a film that is not about race has at least two non-white characters in the main cast, and similarly, writer Nikesh Shukla proposed a test about whether there are two main characters who are people of color, who talk to each other without mentioning their race.\n\nThe \"New York Times\" film critic Manohla Dargis suggested in January 2016 the \"DuVernay test\", (named for director Ava DuVernay) asking whether \"African-Americans and other minorities have fully realized lives rather than serve as scenery in white stories.\" It aims to point out the lack of people of color in Hollywood movies, through a measure of their importance to a particular movie or the lack of a gratuitous link to white actors.\n\nNadia Latif and Leila Latif of \"The Guardian\" have suggested a series of five questions:\n\nA simplified version by Nikesh Shukla, already proposed in 2013, asks if \"two ethnic minorities talk to each other for more than five minutes about something other than race.\"\n\nThe Bechdel test has also inspired gender-related tests for nonfiction. Laurie Voss, CTO of npm, proposed a Bechdel test for software. Source code passes this test if it contains a function written by a woman developer which calls a function written by a different woman developer. Press notice was attracted after the U.S. government agency 18F analyzed their own software according to this metric.\n\nThe Bechdel test also inspired the Finkbeiner test, a checklist to help journalists to avoid gender bias in articles about women in science.\n\n"}

This is in direct contrast to Eurogames, which involve complex rules and emphasize strategy over randomness. The term was originally coined to describe relatively simple wargames that did not require extraordinary focus to play. The name was then adopted by gamers to mean casual, short and easy to play games in general. Examples of beer and pretzels games include \"Bohnanza\", \"Wizwar\" and \"Pit\".\n\nBeer and pretzels games vary greatly in theme and gameplay, but have a set of common characteristics. Rules are simple and generally explainable in just a few minutes, turns pass quickly and humor is common. Randomness, either in the form of cards of dice is essential. Fortunes may revert quickly and the game often ends suddenly and unexpectedly. Scoring requires very simple calculations.\n\nFrom a design stand-point, beer and pretzels games are non-trivial to create. They need to have enough depth to encourage repeat play without a stiff learning curve, and need to be enjoyable in quick sessions.\n"}

It was inspired in part by the crimes of sex offender Toby Studebaker, and depicts a young woman meeting a middle-aged man fifteen years after being sexually abused by him when she was twelve.\n\nDavid Harrower's \"Blackbird\" is not to be confused with the Adam Rapp play of the same name.\n\nAt his workplace, 55-year-old Ray is shocked to be visited by a young woman, 27-year-old Una. Fifteen years earlier, they had a sexual relationship for three months when Una was 12 and Ray was 40; subsequently, Ray had been jailed for three years for statutory rape. Ultimately, they ran off together, and, while Ray was taking time to compose himself after realizing what he had just done, he left her alone in a motel room. She got worried and left to find him, which led to both of them frantically searching for one another and raising suspicions within the small coastal town where they were staying. Eventually, a couple out walking their dog took Una in and called the police after learning why she was there. Ray was then arrested and imprisoned. Upon his release, he managed to establish a reasonably successful new life under another name, but Una recognized him in a photograph and tracked him down.\n\nRay takes Una to the office break room, where the two engage in a long and difficult confrontation involving Una's continuing struggles to understand and come to terms with the abuse and her intensely conflicting emotions, which pivot between anger, curiosity, confusion, and even a persistent attachment to Ray, whom Una loved – and she believed that he loved her. The fearful Ray, who is himself trying to forget the past and the potential feelings he had for Una, parries her demanding questions and descriptions of her feelings and experiences, all the while uncertain of her intentions.\n\nA film adaptation of the play titled \"Una\" premiered in September 2016 at the Telluride Film Festival. The film stars Rooney Mara as Una and Ben Mendelsohn as Ray.\n\n\"Blackbird\" was commissioned by the Edinburgh International Festival, with a 2005 premiere at the festival, directed by Peter Stein. In February 2006, it opened at the West End Albery Theatre with Roger Allam and Jodhi May. In September 2006, it was well received in Stockholm at Dramaten (Royal Dramatic Theatre), in a co-production with Helsingborg City Theatre, directed by Eva Dahlman; with Göran Stangertz and Anna Björk. In the spring of 2007, the play had simultaneous American premieres by the Manhattan Theatre Club (off-Broadway) and at American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. The New York production was directed by Joe Mantello, and featured Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill in the lead roles. In April 2008, the play was revived by David Grindley at the Rose Theatre, Kingston, prior to a national tour of the UK. In March 2008, the play opened in Mumbai, India, starring Indian film and theatre veterans Akash Khurana and Shernaz Patel. This Akvarious production was also later presented in Bangalore and in New Delhi. Shernaz Patel went on to win the award for Best Actress, for her portrayal of Una, at the 2010 Mahindra Excellence in Theatre Awards.\n\nA 2016 Broadway revival was mounted at the Belasco Theatre on 5 February 2016 (37 previews), and opened officially on 10 March (through 11 June, 108 performances), starring Michelle Williams and Jeff Daniels. It was directed by Joe Mantello. It received critical praise.\n\n\"Blackbird\" had its South Korean run on October 13 to November 13, 2016 at the DCF Daemyung Culture Factory Theater in Seoul's Jongno District. Cho Jae-hyun portrayed Ray while Chae Soo-bin and were alternates in the role of Una.\n\nIn 2017, from 7 April to 7 May, the Spanish version of the play was staged in Madrid at El Pavón Teatro Kamikaze. Prior to this, it had toured several Spanish cities (Avilés, A Coruña, Ourense, Barakaldo and Seville). It starred Irene Escolar (as Una) and José Luis Torrijo (as Ray) and was directed by Carlota Ferrerr.\n\n\n"}

In the early to mid nineties the Society of British Fight Directors went through a transitional period, as its focus began to shift towards the teaching of Stage Combat. In 1996, the \"Society of British Fight Directors\" voted to change its name to The British Academy of Dramatic Combat (BADC).\n\n\"The British Academy of Stage & Screen Combat\" was formed in 1993, many founding members being of the former \"S.B.F.D\". The organisation set about creating its current reputation as the invigorating and driving force behind stage combat in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 1997, British Equity recognised the \"BASSC’s\" Advanced Certificate as a valid qualification for entry onto the Equity Fight Directors’ Training Scheme and, in 2001, the BASSC was appointed by the Equity Council for the training and assessment of Fight Directors candidates applying to join the Equity Fight Directors’ Register. The \"BASSC\" is currently respected, both nationally and internationally, as a provider of professional level stage combat training.\n\nRichard Ryan was appointed the first Master Teacher of the BASSC. Since then he has gone on to become an established Hollywood Fight Director. His film credits include: Sherlock Holmes, Troy, The Dark Knight, Stardust, Ironclad, The Eagle, The Last Legion, Fallen & The Hammer of The Gods. As well as television & theatre, his work extends as far as video games; Notably, he was the Fight/Combat Consultant for the best-selling Xbox 360 game Fable 2 from Lionhead Studios.\n\n\"BASSC\" teachers can be found at many leading UK Drama & Arts Schools, including the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, Royal Birmingham Conservatoire of Music and Acting , East 15 Acting School, London college of Music, Royal Academy of Music, Central School of Speech and Drama, Italia Conti, Guildhall School of Music & Drama, Drama Studio, Fourth Monkey Theatre Company, British American Drama Academy and the City Lit.

As such it is the open teams-of-four component of the \"Home Internationals\" organised by Bridge Great Britain.\n\nLord Camrose, owner of \"The Daily Telegraph\", donated the trophy in 1936 and it was first contested in 1937. The original trophy has been lost and replaced. Because of World War II the series was interrupted mid-way in 1939 and not resumed until 1946, yet the Camrose is the world's most-played international bridge series.\n\nBeside \"The Camrose\" (Open flight), the Home Bridge Internationals include annual series for Women from 1950, Juniors from 1971, Under-19 from 1990, and Seniors from 2008.\n\nSince 2007 there have been six rather than five teams in the competition, to avoid having one team sit out each round. From 2007 to 2009 the sixth team was the defending champion, so there were two teams from the previous year's winning nation. England's second team won in 2009, when it was the final-round host by coincidence. Since then by design the sixth team is a second team from the final-round host nation, which follows a five-year cycle from Northern Ireland in 2010 to England in 2014.

With six teams, each weekend comprises five rounds of three head-to-head matches, a single round-robin. A match is now 32 scored at IMPs and converted to . So every team plays 320 deals in the entire event, 64 against each of its rivals. Before 2005, the teams played head-to-head matches over five weekends.\n\nBefore 2007 there were simply five national teams, or four during the 48-year absence by the Republic of Ireland from 1951 to 1998.\n\nEngland won both of the completed pre-war and the first 17 post-war contests, through 1962. Only England and Scotland were winners in the 56 renditions before year 2000, including England–Scotland ties 1972 and 1973. Ireland first won in 2000 and won four straight beginning 2005. Wales won its first Camrose in 2011, but now England are again dominant, winning six times in the last eight years. The 2016 contest was won by England.\n\nThe competition has been completed 73 times up to 2016. There was an outright winner on each occasion except for 1972 and 1973, when England and Scotland tied for first place. England's count includes a win in 2009 by its second team, \"English Bridge Union\".\n\nThree times recently (*), the winners have been one of two entries from their countries, namely \"Ireland\" 2008, \"EBU\" 2009 (English Bridge Union), and \"Wales\" 2011. They were the defending champion team, the England \"B\" team, and the Wales \"A\" team respectively. Their compatriots were \"Hosts Ireland\", \"England\", and \"WBU\" (Welsh Bridge Union).\n\nThe 1939 contest was not completed and the next six did not take place because of World War II.\n\n competition in bridge requires a minimum of four players on each team; up to two additional players may be added as alternates. Two tables are in play at the same time with the North–South pair at one table and East–West pair at the other table being teammates.\n\nCamrose matches comprise two sets of 16 deals with player substitutions permitted between sets. Since 2007 the annual event comprises ten matches for each national team; previously there were eight or six matches. All 2011 participants played in 80 to 144 of 160 deals on the second weekend, or five to nine of ten sets (five matches), led by Rex Anderson and David Greenwood who played nine sets for Northern Ireland. Anderson is the career leader with 92 \"matches\" played (through 2011).\n\nTrophies are awarded for each match, in addition to the overall trophy.\n\n"}

As with the other games in the series, one of the most controversial aspects was that pedestrians could be killed by immolation (being set on fire) or graphic collisions that could include dismemberment. In some countries, the human pedestrians were replaced with zombies - actually only changing the red blood to green slime - but patches were circulated on the internet that reverted the game to its original state.\n\nWhile still part of the game series' canon, the gameplay was not a significant advancement on the original, which resulted in poor sales for the game and blurred the chances of a 4th installment of the series. However, almost 12 years later, a long-awaited 4th installment of the series was announced on the official site, called Carmageddon: Reincarnation.\n\nDuring development of TDR 2000, SCi hired Tozzer.com to create an online comic based on the \"Carmageddon\" video game.\n\nA Game Boy Color version of the game was also slated to be released however it was cancelled for unknown reasons.\n\n\"The Nosebleed Pack\" was the official expansion pack for \"TDR2000\" adding new vehicles, environments, powerups and improved multiplayer modes with extra maps. It was later released as a free patch. The soundtrack is by Plague and Utah Saints.\n\nThe game so far has a score of 61.79% from GameRankings and 48 out of 100 from Metacritic.\n"}

{"id": "3581977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3581977", "title": "Continuator", "text": "Continuator\n\nA continuator, in literature, is a writer who creates a new work based on someone else's prior text, such as a novel or novel fragment. The new work may complete the older work (as with the numerous continuations of Jane Austen's unfinished novel \"Sanditon\"), or may try to serve as a sequel or prequel to the older work (such as Alexandra Ripley's \"Scarlett\", an authorized continuation of Margaret Mitchell's \"Gone with the Wind\"). This phenomenon differs from those authors who, because they share a common culture, use characters or themes from a common cultural stock.\n\nThe development of European classical literature out of the common stock of oral tradition proved conducive to reworkings, revisions, and satires. Numerous writers of Greece's golden age revived and reworked stories of the Trojan War and Greek mythology, although they were not strictly continuators as, for the most part, they did not invent or even extrapolate much from the received stories, choosing to alter the tone and treatment rather than the stories.\n\nLatin literature, on the other hand, may be regarded as systematic continuators of Greek models. The pinnacle of Augustan literature, the \"Aeneid\", is essentially a continuation of the \"Iliad\": not only in that it follows a minor character from his imagined origins in Troy to his founding of Rome, but in that it continues a historical ethos. This move, by connecting the Roman empire both culturally and pseudo-historically to the Homeric myth, is commonly viewed as a move by Virgil to legitimize the Roman empire. For instance, the epic opens with a summary of the progress of Aeneas and his progeny (in John Dryden's translation):\n\n<poem>\n</poem>\n\nW. A. Camps expresses this common analysis of Virgil when he writes, \"There is more than one reminder in the poem that its hero Aeneas is ancestor of Octavian through the supposed descent of the Julii [i.e., Octavian's family] through Aeneas' son Julius.\"\n\nLike their medieval predecessors, Renaissance authors drew inspiration from earlier writers. More significantly, the spread of printing, slow increase in literacy, and the development of capitalism conspired to shape a modern concept of text and authorship. In this context, one sees \"continuators\" in the modern sense: authors either inspired or hired to complete or continue a predecessor's concept. This habit was most noticeable in the most commercialized spheres of literature. Elizabethan drama, for example, is full of examples. As an instance of completion, Francis Godolphin Waldron completed \"The Sad Shepherd\", a late unfinished play by Ben Jonson. As an instance of sequel-writing, John Fletcher's \"The Tamer Tamed\" continues and lampoons Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew\". Controversial literature was amenable to such continuations, as evidenced most especially by the Martin Marprelate affair; Philip Sidney's \"Arcadia\" was continued by Anna Weamys.\n\n\n"}

Marcia Gelbart Walkenstein was his sister.\n\nHis family later moved to Los Angeles and he attended Fairfax High School. Drafted shortly after World War Two, Gelbart worked for the Armed Forces Radio Service in Los Angeles.\n\nGelbart began as a writer at the age of sixteen for Danny Thomas's radio show after his father, who was Thomas's barber, showed Thomas some jokes Gelbart had written. During the 1940s Gelbart also wrote for Jack Paar and Bob Hope. In the 1950s, his most important work in television involved writing for Red Buttons, for Sid Caesar on \"Caesar's Hour\", and in Celeste Holm's \"Honestly, Celeste!\", as well as with writers Mel Tolkin, Michael Stewart, Selma Diamond, Neil Simon, Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner and Woody Allen on two Caesar specials.\n\nIn 1972, Gelbart was one of the main forces behind the creation of the television series \"M*A*S*H\", writing the pilot (for which he received a \"Developed for Television by __\" credit); then producing, often writing and occasionally directing the series for its first four seasons, from 1972 to 1976. \"M*A*S*H\" earned Gelbart a Peabody Award and an Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series and went on to considerable commercial and critical success.\n\nGelbart's best known screen work is perhaps the screenplay for 1982's \"Tootsie\", which he co-wrote with Murray Schisgal. He was nominated for an Academy Award for that script, and also was Oscar-nominated for his adapted screenplay for 1977's \"Oh, God!\" starring John Denver and George Burns. On his relationship with actor Dustin Hoffman in \"Tootsie\", Gelbart is reported to have said, \"Never get involved in a film where the Oscar-winning star is smaller than the statuette.\" He later retracted this statement, saying that it was just a joke.\n\nHe collaborated with Burt Shevelove on the screenplay for the 1966 British film \"The Wrong Box\". Gelbart also co-wrote the golden-era film spoof \"Movie Movie\" (1978) starring George C. Scott in dual roles, the racy comedy \"Blame It on Rio\" (1984) starring Michael Caine and the 2000 remake of \"Bedazzled\" with Elizabeth Hurley and Brendan Fraser.\n\nHis script for \"Rough Cut\" (1980), a caper film starring Burt Reynolds, Lesley-Anne Down and David Niven, was credited under the pseudonym Francis Burns.\n\nGelbart-scripted films for television included \"Barbarians at the Gate\" (1993), a true story about the battle for control of the RJR Nabisco corporation starring James Garner that was based on the best-selling book of that name; the original comedy \"Weapons of Mass Distraction\" (1997) starring Ben Kingsley and Gabriel Byrne as rival media moguls; and \"And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself\" (2003) starring Antonio Banderas as the Mexican revolutionary leader.\n\nGelbart co-wrote the long-running Broadway musical farce \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" with Burt Shevelove and Stephen Sondheim in 1962. After the show received poor reviews and box-office returns during its previews in Washington, D.C., rewrites and restaging helped; it was a smash Broadway hit and ran for 964 performances. Its book won a Tony Award. A film version starring Zero Mostel and directed by Richard Lester, was released in 1966. Gelbart was critical of the movie, as most of his and Shevelove's libretto was largely rewritten.\n\nGelbart's other Broadway credits include the musical \"City of Angels\", which won him the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Book of a Musical, the Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical, and an Edgar Award. He also wrote the Iran-contra satire \"Mastergate\", as well as \"Sly Fox\" and a musical adaptation of the Preston Sturges movie \"Hail the Conquering Hero\", whose grueling development inspired Gelbart to utter what evolved into the classic quip, \"If Hitler is alive, I hope he's out of town with a musical.\"\n\nIn 1997, Gelbart published his memoir, \"Laughing Matters: On Writing M*A*S*H, Tootsie, Oh, God! and a Few Other Funny Things\".\n\nGelbart was a contributing blogger at \"The Huffington Post\", and also was a regular participant on the alt.tv.mash Usenet newsgroup as \"Elsig\".\n\nIn 1995, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.\n\nHe won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in 1974 for \"M*A*S*H\".\n\nIn 2002, Gelbart was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2008, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.\n\nGelbart was diagnosed with cancer in June and died at his Beverly Hills home on September 11, 2009. His wife of 53 years, Pat Gelbart, said that after being married for so long, \"we finished each other's sentences.\" She declined to specify the type of cancer he had.

Metro Manila and other urban areas in the Philippines comprise the National Urban Television Audience Measurement (NUTAM) and are scattered throughout the country.\n\nNote that the National Urban Television Audience Measurement (NUTAM) does not represent the entire Philippines but only urban areas; NUTAM markets comprise 39% of the entire country.

He praised the online and offline multiplayer mode. The German PC game magazine \"GameStar\" criticized the gameplay, because it is almost impossible to play it with the mouse and the keyboard, so the player is forced to get a gamepad to play \"London 2012\".

{"id": "12473261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12473261", "title": "Margolis Brown Adaptors Company", "text": "Margolis Brown Adaptors Company\n\nThe Margolis Brown Adaptors Company (MBAC) is an internationally touring physical theatre company that also houses the Margolis Method Training Center now located in Highland, New York. It was established in New York City in 1984 by Kari Margolis and Tony Brown. As co-artistic directors, Margolis and Brown have thus far co-authored, directed, and sometimes performed in 16 full-length theatrical productions, as well as numerous site-specific works at such places as the Brooklyn Museum, Coney Island, and the historic John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge on the Delaware River.\n\nThe MBAC were artists in residence at the Brooklyn Arts and Culture Association (BACA) in New York City from 1985 to 1990. In 1987 they established an independent performance space and multimedia center in Brooklyn and mounted four original productions there. The company has toured nationally and internationally to Barcelona, Berlin, London, Singapore and throughout Canada and Mexico. The company relocated to Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1993. There they continued to create and produce multimedia theater productions and trained actors in the Margolis Method for over 12 years. MBAC established an international training center in Sullivan County, New York in 2005 and divide their time between New York and Minneapolis. From 2005 thru 2010 the Company divided its time between both sites. In 2011, the Company and Training Center have moved all operations to the Highland NY site. \n\nMBAC theatrical productions are collaboratively written original performance works produced by the company. Productions are characterized by frequent utilization of multimedia and sparse text, thereby relying on unconventional means of dramatic conveyance. Examples of those alternative dramatic vehicles are projected images, prerecorded or live sound, or an actor's physicality. In addition, the actors often appear in non-representational dramatic situations.\n\nMargolis has developed a physically based approach to performance called the \"Margolis Method.\" The method, along with 25 years of personal research, takes inspiration from the research of such artists as Etienne Decroux, Bertolt Brecht, and Jerzy Grotowski. The method's goal is to analyze and focus the dramatic force and emotion created by an actor's physicality to further the creative and expressive process. It seeks to empower the actor to work simultaneously as a director, playwright and performer.\n\nThe Margolis Method was developed in response to what Margolis saw as a fragmented and ineffective way of teaching actors in America. Pedagogically, Margolis rejected the notion that actor training could be broken down into separate contexts (\"i.e.\": stage \"voice\" and \"movement\" classes) and instead suggested that all aspects of actor training are inextricably linked. Rather than focusing primarily on establishing character through developing the character's psychological motivations and emotional states, Margolis sought ways to approach drama and character from a physical perspective as well. To accomplish this, Margolis Method focuses on theatrical notions like conflict, timing, and neutrality and employs concepts borrowed from physics, such as inertia, lines of force and density (as well as concrete manifestations of these principles, such as: pendulums, pulleys and elastics).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1569165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1569165", "title": "Minutes to Fame", "text": "Minutes to Fame\n\nMinutes to Fame () was a game show-style talent contest from Hong Kong. It was a weekly program presented by Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) and broadcast on TVB Jade in three series from February 2005 to August 2007. The show is intended to be satirical and funny, since most of the contestants are inexperienced and are trying to get famous.\n\nThe show was hosted by Hacken Lee and Joey Leung in the first two seasons, who both acted as two of its judges. They were replaced by Miriam Yeung and Sammy Leung for the third season. All three seasons featured one or more guest judges in each episode, which varies between episodes.\n\nInspired by the \"Idols\" franchise, the show gives ordinary Hongkongers the opportunity to appear as contestants on stage to sing and perform. Its slogan is \"全城盡興，殘酷一叮！\" (The whole city (Hong Kong) gets excited for the minutes to fame). The show has received top ratings, and the finals of the first series, on 4 June 2005, reached 33 points on the charts. It has led to the creation of several spinoffs by other Chinese television stations, including Asia TV and Guangdong Television, and to collaboration with other mainland Chinese television stations to provide contestants for their own shows, such as CCTV's China Dream Show.\n\nThe program was among TVB's first to recruit competitors from overseas. Starting from May 2005, primaries are not only held in Hong Kong, but also in Guangzhou, Macau, Toronto, Taipei, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney etc. Similarly, the European branch of TVB, TVB-S Europe, held a Minutes to Fame contest in Paris and Rotterdam on August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2005 respectively. The winner of both contests would proceed in a Minutes to Fame special later that year, where contestants from all over the world would compete.\n\nEach episode features a number of contestants whose objective is to remain on stage for as long as possible. Their act must involve singing one of eight randomly selected songs for each episode, which includes Cantopop, Mandopop, and even English-language popular music. Besides singing, contestants may also choose to enhance their act by playing an instrument, acrobatics, magic, etc.\n\nAt any point during their performance, any of the judges may strike a gong on the table in front of them, at which point the contestant must stop singing. Their score is determined by the duration of their performance, in seconds, excluding the introduction, and each second is worth HK$100 in prize money. At the conclusion of each episode, the contestant with the longest act by duration is the night's winner and qualifies for subsequent rounds, and eventually the final round, \"Battle for the King\" ().\n\nWhile the show is meant to be competitive, judges have been harsh to contestants that they \"ding\" out, and often make fun of them directly. A laugh track is heavily used instantly whenever one-liners or off-key singing was present, supplementing the studio audience's reactions. But sometimes it happens whenever spot-on singing happens if the contestant has an unusual appearance. Note that most Hong Kong variety shows use laugh tracks heavily for network purposes.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the 25th installment of the \"NHL\" series and was released on September 15, 2015 in North America and September 17 and 18 in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The game was released on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with a separate release for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 titled NHL: Legacy Edition. Jonathan Toews of the Chicago Blackhawks is the official cover athlete, marking his second appearance on an \"NHL\" cover, following \"NHL 11\".\n\nFeaturing game presentation in the style of the NBC Sports Network, \"NHL 16\" runs on EA Sports' advanced Ignite game engine and features many game modes, including one that has the player take control of their own custom player and pursuing a career in the NHL and one that has the player play as the manager of any NHL team. The fan-favorite EA Sports Hockey League (EASHL) mode, an online co-operative play mode, also returns to the game after being left out of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of \"NHL 15\", the game's predecessor. Upon release, \"NHL 16\" received positive reviews and was declared an improvement over \"NHL 15\" by critics.\n\n\"NHL 16\" contains several game modes; \"Be a GM\", where the player controls the general manager of a team of their choice, \"Be a Pro\", where the player controls their own custom player and progresses his career, Hockey Ultimate Team, where the player collects cards of real-life players, build a team, and then take on either players online or A.I. teams, and EA Sports Hockey League, abbreviated as \nEASHL, a multiplayer-only mode where players can use their own custom player to join other teams, also with custom players controlled by other people, and take on other teams. The EASHL returns after being dropped from the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of \"NHL 15\". It features some changes in its progression system to address balance issues, including a switch to a class-based progression model similar to Be a Pro mode, and the removal of attributes and boosts. A beta for the EASHL mode was available for \"NHL 15\" owners from July 30 to August 10.\n\nOther features included are offline and online shootout modes, online team play, which has the user take control of players from real-life teams, and online versus, a simple head-to-head match. Returning to the game is the NBC Sports Network-style presentation, which features the network's score bug as well as commentary provided by Mike \"Doc\" Emrick (play-by-play), Eddie Olczyk (color), and Ray Ferraro (ice-side reporter). Emrick and Olczyk's actual selves are present during the pregame intro cutscenes.\n\n\"NHL 16\" did not have a cover vote in contrast to the previous year's iteration. At the 2015 NHL Awards, it was revealed that Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews of the Chicago Blackhawks, who had won the 2015 Stanley Cup Finals, were selected to be on the cover of the game. It is Toews' second appearance on the cover of an \"NHL\" game, following \"NHL 11\". It was supposed to be Kane's second appearance as well, following \"NHL 10\", but on August 12 EA Sports announced that Kane would no longer be appearing on the cover of the game in light of the fact he was the subject of a police investigation over a sexual assault allegation.\n\n\"NHL: Legacy Edition\" is an updated version of \"NHL 15\" for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. There are some minor changes, such as the menu music; however, the EA Sports logo is instead shown for the album arts, the NHL Moments Live from 2013–14 is replaced by some new ones that were made available as the 2015-16 NHL season progressed, and in the \"Custom Team\" game mode the team name selection is improvised.\n\n\"NHL 16\" launched in North America on September 15, 2015, in both a standard edition and a deluxe set, which includes bonus content for use with the \"Hockey Ultimate Team\" game mode. \"NHL: Legacy Edition\" launched in North America on the same day as \"NHL 16\", but it was released in a standard edition only. In Canada, an exclusive PlayStation 4 bundle launched with the game simultaneously, packaging both a PS4 console and a copy of \"NHL 16\".\n\nUpon its release, \"NHL 16\" received positive reviews from critics and received much more positive reviews compared to its predecessor, \"NHL 15\", which received more mixed and average reviews from critics. On GameRankings, the PlayStation 4 version holds a 79.67% rating, based on 23 reviews, and the Xbox One version holds an 82.23% rating, based on 15 reviews. On Metacritic, the PlayStation 4 version holds a 78/100 rating, based on 28 reviews, and the Xbox One version holds an 80/100 rating, based on 18 reviews. Critics generally felt that \"NHL 16\" was an improvement over \"NHL 15\". They directed acclaim at the fun gameplay of the game's wide variety of game modes as well as the return of the EASHL mode. Some criticism was aimed mainly at some lack of depth in these game modes as well as the game's menus and interface.\n\nMat Paget of GameSpot awarded the game an 8/10. He complimented the content of \"NHL 16\"s game modes as well as the inclusion of the On-Ice Trainer, which he believes would help brand new players and would work very well in the game's Be A Pro mode. He stated, however, that the game's menus can sometimes be confusing to get around. For \"Game Informer\", Matt Bertz wrote that EA Sports are heading in the right direction with \"NHL 16\", but he felt that they failed to bring any \"game-breaking quality\" in terms of gameplay. Bertz complimented the game's improved artificial intelligence system for opposing teams as well as the \"NHL on NBC\" game presentation. Anthony LaBella of \"Game Revolution\" found the inclusion of several game modes to be positive for the game, but felt that some of them were not thoroughly developed enough. LaBella also enjoyed the revamped EASHL mode as well as the game's presentation.\n"}
{"id": "42023747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42023747", "title": "National Theatre of Kosovo", "text": "National Theatre of Kosovo\n\nThe National Theatre of Kosovo (; / ) was founded in 1946 in the city of Prizren, Kosovo. It is the highest ranked theatre institution in the country which has the largest number of productions. The National Theatre is the only public theatre in Kosovo and therefore it is financed by Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sport. This theatre has produced more than 400 premieres which have been watched by more than 3 million spectators.\n\n\"The National Theatre of Kosovo\" was founded in 1946 in Prizren and it was the first professional theatre in Kosovo after the World War II. In the beginning it was called \"People`s Provincial Theatre\" and it was placed in the “Partizan” sport center. This object had a very small stage and did not fulfill the basic requirements for a place which could be used as a theatre. The founders of the first professional theatre in Kosovo were Pavle Vugrinac, Milan and Cica Petrovic who gathered young talented actors willing to work for the theatre and named Shefqet Musliu as their general director. After the staff was completed with 14 art enthusiasts who delivered two premiers, \"People`s Provincial Theatre\" was officially established on October 7, 1945. The first official show released by this theatre was called “The sugar ball” (Albanian: Topi i sheqerit”) from the author Glishiq which was followed by 16 other successful premiers and two tours across Kosovo.\nIn 1946, the theatre was moved to Pristina, where there was a work interruption due to construction of a new theatre facility, meanwhile the young actors working for the theatre spread to search for a job in another active theatre. Two years later, the official rebirth of the theatre was announced by the Ministry of Education and Culture of Serbia on May 1, 1949. Milutin Jansic was named general director and the first show to be performed in the new theatre facility in Pristina two years after the pause was “Most” directed by Dragutin Todic. In 1951 the \"Law for People`s Provincial Theatre\" was declared and this made it possible for the theatre to be developed rapidly. There were many new actors who joined the theatre, but in the absence of professional directors, two of them (Abdurrahman Shala and Muharrem Qena) were trained under the supervision of Dobrica Radenkovic and were turned into successful and famous theatre directors and stage managers. During the following years the theatre had very capable general directors such as Azem Shkreli and Ramiz Kelmendi, who developed theatre activity in Kosovo and made the theatre a very important art institution. In the 90s follow the violent Serbian occupation measures in Kosovo, which affected theatrical activity as well. Right after the war, the name of this theatre was changed from \"Peoples Provincial Theatre\" to \"National Theatre of Kosovo\".\n\nFrom 1981 until the end of the Kosovo War the theatre has worked under Serbian political pressure, therefore many Albanian artists were dismissed and parallel educative home-theatres were created. Most of the dismissed artists continued their career in the parallel theatres and some of them today are part of the professional staff of the National Theatre. In 1999, right after the Kosovo War, the theatre`s name was changed into \"The National Theatre of Kosovo\". During the next 10 years after the war, the theatre has been home to many international and national shows and festivals. Despite social unrest and political pressures, the National Theatre of Kosovo achieved many creativity prizes in festivals like “Sterja`s Festival” in Novi Sad, “Small Experimental Stages” in Sarajevo and many other international theatrical meetings. The National theatre organizes many events which make it possible to bring international shows on stage in Pristina. Some of these very frequented events are: German Week, Frankofonian Week and Swiss Week.\n\nIn the absence of an accredited institution for the education of the new actors and staff members of the theatre, in the 50s the theatre`s workers established a theatre studio where the new members could be educated and trained according to the needs of the theatre. This studio lasted for two years and 14 members were trained. This studio no longer exists since now there are professional institutions which do the same job. Later on, the actors and directors attended courses abroad and came back to share knowledge and experiences with other members. Thanks to the big efforts of its members, a couple of years later the National Theatre had its own artists, stage managers, costume and set designers and a qualified staff. An important role had the collaboration of the theatre with the Academy for Theatre and Movies of Serbia and Serbian radio and television. In 1970 was established the Drama Group which offered individual art education to many young art enthusiasts who gave big contributions to the National Theatre. Some of these people who later on became great artists were Faruk Begolli, Bekim Fehmiu, Ekrem Kryeziu, Qemajl Sokoli, Enver Petrovci and many others.\n\nThe National Theatre is initiator of many festivals and events that increase the competition between performers and performing arts institutions. The first competition was arranged in the beginning of the 50s and resulted in the collection of original dramas of different kinds with no language restrictions. The results were quite satisfactory because many of the dramas were turned into great shows like “Erveheja”, “Dashuria” and “Hakmarrja”. Except for original dramas, in stage were performed many books by Albanian famous authors. One of them which was very successful was “Sikur të isha djalë” by Haki Stërmilli. In 60s and 70s many authors started writing dramas which would enrich the repertoire of the National Theatre. \nThe basics of dramatic creativity were established with the permanent competition “Katarina Josipi-KATI” which holds the name of the famous actress Katarina Josipi. This competition brings on stage many art pieces which have a large number of audience members and fill the gaps of theatrical creativity in the National Theatre. Except for different kinds of dramas, in stage were put even some poems like “Zogu i diellit” by Din Mehmeti and “Trungu Ilir” by Sabri Hamiti.\n\nMagazines and newspapers like “Rilindje”, “Jedinstvo”, “Tan”, “Bota e re”, “Zëri”, “Politika” and Radio-Television of Prishtina had a very important role on promoting the National Theatre activity and attracting art criticism. Many art critics focused on the performances of the theatre and published their opinions which influenced the popularization of the scenic art. Some of the critical books published on the National Theatre are “Kur ndizen dritat” by Vehap Shita and “Fjala ne skenë” by Musa Ramadani.\n\nThis institution has five organizational units.\nExcept for its units, the National Theatre has its branches like theatre council, artistic board and bylaws like statute and rules of procedure. Since the National Theatre is a public institution it has never been self-financed but it is supported by Educational-Cultural Community, Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sport and other artistic institutions.\n\nSince its establishment, the National Theatre has cooperated with many institutions which have contributed in its expansion and promotion. The theatre is still cooperating with theatres in Albania, Poland, Turkey, England and many other countries. The always was a very close cooperation with the Radio of Prizren and Radio of Prishtina ever since 1973. They shared directors, interpreters and technicians and realized radio dramas and radio comedies together.\n\nThe National Theatre as the leading theatrical institution has many connections with other theatres in Kosovo like Oda Theatre, Dodona Theatre and theatres in Prizren, Peja, Gjakova, Ferizaj, and Mitrovica. It has been part of many festivals and its directors have been jury in important cultural events like “Trebinja” and Kulla”.\n\nSince the National Theatre and the Cinematography Entrepreneurship of Kosovo have been established at the same day, October 7, 1945 at the same place, Prizren, their activity is associated in many areas. In the first decades this cooperation has been developed mainly in the film studios of Beograd, Serbia. Later on, many actors from the National Theatre like Kristë Berisha, Muharrem Qena and Shani Pallaska have played in movies like “Eshaloni Dr.M.”, “Kapiten Lleshi”, “Qerim hesapesh”, and “Jeta e minatorëve”. With the establishment of “Kosova Film” the cooperation is very close and the result are very successful movies like “Uka i Bjeshkëve të Nemuna” and “Treni për Berlin”. Since the actors of the theatre were the most professional actors in the place, they were often asked to play in movies despite form acting on stage so the National Theatre had a very important role on the development of cinematography.\n\nThe repertoire of \"The National Theatre\" consists of many dramatic shows from national and international directors. The shows produced in this theatre have been part of many international festivals where they got art awards and very good comments from many well-known art critics. Until 1989 this theatre has produced more than 400 premieres and around 10.000 replays. These shows have been watched from more than 3.200.000 people in Kosovo and abroad. Except for shows made in Albanian language, this theatre has produced many shows in Serbian language and other Slavic languages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is published by Wydawnictwo Portal (Portal Publishing House). The game is set in the same post-apocalyptic world as its RPG counterpart.\n\nNeuroshima Hex is played on a hexagonal board. Each player periodically draws from a deck of hexagonal cards called \"tiles.\" Tiles symbolize different types of military units. Annotations on the tiles denote the combat strength of each unit. Each player has one special tile called HQ (headquarters). Players take turns placing their tiles on the board. The player chooses:\nNormally a card does not move once placed on the board. Periodically a tile is played that initializes combat. At that time, cards are removed from the board based on the outcome of combat between pairs of nearby opposing cards. The game is nominally concluded when all tiles from the deck have been exhausted. The winner is determined by which HQ has taken the least combat damage.\n\nThere are three major categories of tiles in each player's deck:\n\nAt the start of each player's turn, they draw three tiles at random from their deck. One tile must be discarded. The remaining two tiles may be placed on the board. Tiles cannot be placed on top of other tiles. The player may opt to discard more than one tile. Players take turns in this fashion until the board is partially populated with tiles. Randomly a player may draw a tile that allows the player to initiate combat. When this occurs, gameplay pauses while combat is resolved. Annotations on the tiles denote what priority each card has in the combat sequence. Cards marked with a \"3\" have first priority, \"2\" second priority, and \"1\" third priority. In other words, tiles marked with a \"3\" get to attack first. Once the outcome of those attacks are resolved (i.e., \"dead\" units are removed from the board) then tiles marked with a \"2\" get to attack, and so on. Once all phases of combat (phases 3, 2, 1, 0) have concluded normal gameplay resumes.\n\nThe objective of the game is to attack the enemy's HQ. Each HQ starts with 20 hit points. Gameplay concludes when one HQ is down to 0 hit points, or when all the tiles have been exhausted from a player's deck. The winner is determined by the player's HQ that has the most remaining hit points.\n\nThe game offers four armies (denoted by four different color schemes for tiles) which differ in their strength, mobility and flexibility, as denoted by differing annotations on each army's tiles. Normally the game is played by two players, though three and four player variations exist.\n\nAs a card game, Neuroshima Hex is essentially a much more complex version of War. In terms of strategy, Neuroshima Hex is similar to chess in that play emphasizes correct placement of pieces on the board, with occasional combat removing pieces from the board. The game is also available as a video game, with rules essentially identical to the board game, albeit with combat between tiles automated via software.\n\nA second edition (in English) was released at SPIEL (the Essen game fair) in 2007, and a promotional 5th army (Doomsday Machine) was given to buyers at the Portal Publishing booth. At Pionek (a game convention in Gliwice, Poland) in 2007, a small supplement (Mad Bomber) was given out.\n\nA French translation was released February 2008. In 2008, the game was published in English by Z-Man Games, with an expanded board and improved components; this edition includes the Mad Bomber and Mercenary tiles. Spanish, Italian, German and Dutch editions were released in 2010.\n\nThree expansions for the second edition were released, so far only in Polish:\n\nThere are also several fan made expansions. Additional materials in multiple languages (inc. English-language translations of the expansions) are available at the relevant games articles at BoardGameGeek.\n\nOn 17 September 2010, the iOS version of the game was published on App Store, with an Android version following on 13 June 2012.\n\n"}

{"id": "181162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=181162", "title": "Performance poetry", "text": "Performance poetry\n\nPerformance poetry is poetry that is specifically composed for or during a performance before an audience. During the 1980s, the term came into popular usage to describe poetry written or composed for performance rather than print distribution, mostly open to improvisation.\n\nThe term \"performance poetry\" originates from an early press release describing the 1980s performance poet Hedwig Gorski, whose audio recordings achieved success on spoken word radio programs around the world. Her band, East of Eden Band, was described as the most successful at music and poetry collaborations, allowing cassettes of her live radio broadcast recordings to stay in rotation with popular underground music recordings on some radio stations. Gorski, an art school graduate, tried to come up with a term that would distinguish her text-based vocal performances from performance art, especially the work of performance artists, such as Laurie Anderson, who worked with music at that time. Performance poets relied more on the rhetorical and philosophical expression in their poetics than performance artists, who arose from the visual art genres of painting and sculpture. \"The Austin Chronicle\" newspaper, printing Gorski's bi-weekly \"Litera\" column, first published the term \"performance poetry\" to describe the work of Gorski with composer D'Jalma Garnier III as early as 1982. She began using the term, however, to describe a 1978 \"neo-verse drama\" and \"conceptual spoken poetry for five voices\" titled \"Booby, Mama!\" that employs the cut-up method made popular by William Burroughs and conceptual art methods.\n\nThe National Endowment for the Arts categorized performance art within the visual arts judging panels; it originally placed performance poetry within the category of theater before correcting it to literature in the 21st century. Since many performance poets did not have publications, the former classification made performance poets categorically ineligible for the NEA fellowship funding or recognition. Their audio cassettes were not acceptable sample material for literature grant consideration. A stated objection to this presentation method protested their performance poems translated into text on paper could not compete with poetry written for print publication. The National Endowment for the Arts is now accepting varied presentations for publication verification for poetry fellowship applicants, including audio recordings that have no printed versions of the poems. Performance poetry with music peaked during the 1980s just as performance art peaked in the 1970s.\n\nDuring that time, San Francisco and New York were the centers for this type of activity; however, Austin, Texas (The Third Coast) also had a thriving scene during the 1980s with a coterie of unique characters. Some of the best original Austin performance poets and performing poets who went on to national and international notoriety include Raul Salinas, Konstantyn K. Kuzminsky, Joy Cole, Hedwig Gorski, Roxy Gordon, Ricardo Sanchez, Harryette Mullen, who was nominated for the National Book Award. The Austin Poets Audio Anthology Project, a public arts project, recorded them for radio broadcasts. There were many others, though, and Hedwig Gorski once wrote in \"Litera\" that some were \"eerie\", a word used by one newspaper reviewer to describe Gorski's vocals on the East of Eden Band track \"There's Always Something That Can Make You Happy\". Other performing writers in the robust literary scene of the Austin area during that time when performance poetry turned into a school of poetry included Pat Littledog, Eleanor Crockett, Jim Ryan, Chuck Taylor, Greg Gauntner, Albert Huffstickler, W. Joe Hoppe, Andy Clausen, poet and playwright Isabella Russell-Ides (\"Getting Dangerously Close To Myself\", Slough Press) and David Jewell (poet); most recorded on Hedwig Gorski's audio anthology project.\n\nJewell deserves special mention as a transitional figure, younger than the aforementioned, and one not especially rooted in the Beats like Gorski who has strong connections to Ginsberg, Corso, Gary Snyder, and others. By the 1990s the general poetry public was less interested in the Beat Poets of the 1950s and 1960s. They were looking for something fresher, newer, hipper, more in touch with the times in which they were living. Performance poets established clubs, cafes, and media as venues that later became stages for the emerging slam poetry scene. Unlike Gorski, who with East of Eden Band, began broadcasting live performance poetry on radio and distributing the recordings of these broadcasts in place of publishing in print, Jewell and slam poets were more interested in small live audiences. Venues like Nuyorican Poets Cafe in New York City and mass media formats, like Gorski's and John Giorno's, form the two lines of influence leading to Def Poetry on HBO.\n\nPerforming poets-writers and especially performance poets excelled in the ability to put the event of oral literature into the primary social/communicative function for literature. The plurality of the literary performance is under the control of the poet/writer, and the performer never minimizes the participation of the audience members. It is important to remember that performance was the primary distribution method for poetics since tribal times and ancient Greece. As Gorski often states, broadcast and technology surpass books in reaching mass audiences for poetry, and just as writing poetry for print made poetry a completely different artform since the invention of the book, audio \"mediums influence the way poets write just as they do painters and sculptors\".\n\nToday, performance poetry is also being used as a means to promote literacy in public school systems. Global Writes Inc. has been incorporating technology, such as videoconferencing and podcasts, into literacy programs as a means for students to share their poetry. Performance poetry also provides avenues for students to perform their poems onstage. \nPerformance poetry is not solely a postmodern phenomenon. It began with the performance of oral poems in pre-literate societies. By definition, these poems were transmitted orally from performer to performer and were constructed using devices such as repetition, alliteration, rhyme and kennings to facilitate memorization and recall. The performer \"composed\" the poem from memory, using the version they had learned as a kind of mental template. This process allowed the performer to add their own flavor to the poem in question, although fidelity to the traditional versions of the poems was generally favored.\n\nAlthough popular works, including popular poems or collections of poems, were already being distributed for private reading and study in manuscript form, there can be little doubt that the introduction of cheap printing technologies accelerated this trend considerably. The result was a change in the poet's role in society. From having been an entertainer, the poet became primarily a provider of written texts for private readings. The public performance of poetry became generally restricted, at least in a European context, to the staging of plays in verse and occasionally, for example in the cases of the Elizabethan madrigalists or Robert Burns, as texts for singing. Apart from this, the performance of poetry was restricted to reading aloud from printed books within families or groups of friends.\n\nThe early years of the 20th century saw a general questioning of artistic forms and conventions. Poets like Basil Bunting and Louis Zukofsky called for a renewed emphasis on poetry as sound. Bunting in particular argued that the poem on the page was like a musical score; not fully intelligible until manifested through sound. This attitude to poetry helped to encourage an environment in which poetry readings were fostered. This was reinforced by Charles Olson's call for a poetic line based on human breath. Clive Sansom devoted much of his life to gathering and contributing poetry and drama particularly suited to performance by children.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the American poet Cid Corman began to experiment with what he called oral poetry. This involved spontaneously composing poems into a tape recorder. Allen Ginsberg was to take up this practice in the 1960s. David Antin, who heard some of Corman's tapes, took the process one step further. He composed his \"talk-poems\" by improvising in front of an audience. These performances were recorded and the tapes were later transcribed to be published in book form. Around the same time, Jerome Rothenberg was drawing on his ethnopoetic researches to create poems for ritual performances as happenings. Perhaps most famously, the writers of the Beat generation were noted for performance events that married poetry and jazz. Also in the late 1960s, other poets outside San Francisco and New York City were experimenting with performance pieces. Notable among these was David Franks, at the time a faculty member at the Maryland Institute College of Art. Franks' work was not poetry recited to a musical counterpoint but literary pieces in which the performance was a necessary and integral part of the work itself.\n\nIn Britain, sound poets like Bob Cobbing and Edwin Morgan were exploring the possibilities of live performance. Cobbing's groups Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle involved collaborative performance with other poets and musicians and were partly responsible for drawing a number of the poets of the British Poetry Revival into the performance arena.\n\nMeanwhile, many more mainstream poets in both Britain and the United States were giving poetry readings, largely to small academic gatherings on university campuses. Poetry readings were given national prominence when Robert Frost recited \"The Gift Outright\" from memory at the inauguration of John F. Kennedy.After that event, spoken word recordings of Frost and other major figures enjoyed increased popularity.\n\nBy the 1970s, three main forms of poetry performance had emerged. First was the poetry reading, at which poems that had been written for the page were read to an audience, usually by the author. Poetry readings have become widespread and poetry festivals and reading series are now part of the cultural landscape of most Western societies. However, most people would not consider the poetry readings of this type as part of the performance poetry phenomena.\n\nThis leaves three types of poetry performance: poems written specifically for performance on the Jerome Rothenberg model and poems like those of David Antin that are composed during performance. Both these types would generally be considered to constitute performance poetry. Another type based on the Beat method of reading their print poems is poetry with music. The bands with performance poets make spoken vocals an exercise in not singing, but the texts are not categorized as songs. While Ginsberg sang his Blake songs with a harmonium, the original practitioner of this third and most popular type of performance poetry is Hedwig Gorski, who coined the term performance poetry to describe her work with music. She is sometimes called a neo-beat, but considers herself an American \"futurist\". Unlike the Beats, Ginsberg and Kerouac, her poems were written for performance with music that was specifically composed for the poems. Her spoken vocals have come as close to singing as possible without really singing. That is the key to Gorski's performance poetry: the marriage of poetry to music written specifically to fit poems written for vocal performance. The other type of performance poetry Gorski practiced is without music and tied to conceptual art, but that was at appearances in smaller venues that could not accommodate her band. Unlike Antin and Cormin, Gorski never improvised text but wrote poetry only for performance while eschewing printed poetry.\n\nIn the U. S., the rise to prominence of the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets with their distrust of speech as a basis for poetry has, broadly speaking, meant that performance poetry went out of fashion with the \"avant-garde\". However, the increasing popularity of open mics, which allow \"unknown\" poets to take the stage and share their own work in 3- to 5-minute increments and of poetry slams has meant that performance poetry is now one of the most widespread forms of popular poetry. Chief among the proponents of these new forms of popular poetry were Bob Holman in New York, Marc Smith in Chicago and Alan Kaufman in San Francisco. In the 1990s, the Favorite Poem project of then U.S. Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky gave new visibility to ordinary Americans reading and performing their favorite poems. Contemporary performance poets are now experimenting with poetry performances adapted to CD, to video, and to Web audiences.\n\nThe Beat Poets were the first to popularize crossing over into recorded media to distribute their performed poetry. The best-known Beat poet, Allen Ginsberg, followed the lead of fellow Beat, Jack Kerouac, in reciting his work for audio recording. Ginsberg always used music with his readings and often accompanied himself on the harmonium. Ginsberg put William Blake's poems to music and performed them with the harmonium. Even though the Beats did not use the term \"Performance Poetry\" to categorize their work with music and audio recordings, the Beats provided an immediate model for the work of Hedwig Gorski. She is a Nova Scotia College of Art and Design art school graduate in 1976. The art school was infamous for starting the careers of numerous 1970s performance artists, such as Vito Acconci, known for photographing his bites. It is worth noting that Gorski, who coined the term \"Performance Poetry\" to describe her poems written only for performance, recordings, and broadcast usually with her musical band East of Eden Band, is the only woman, besides Patti Smith, in this group of late twentieth-century innovators reviving oral poetry. Similar to the ancient bards, touring became a widespread means for performance poets and slammers to distribute their work since the 1990s. The Poetry Slam is a competitive live performance format founded by poet Marc Smith in Chicago, which has become a hotbed for performance poetry.\n\nPerformance poetry has also been boosted considerably by the appearance of Def Jam—the hip-hop recording company helmed by Russell Simmons—on the scene. def jam has created a television show that showcases performance poets that runs on HBO, as well as a show of performance poets that ran on Broadway for almost a year and won a Tony Award.\n\nHispanic performing artists, such as Pedro Pietri, Miguel Algarín, Giannina Braschi, and Guillermo Gómez-Peña, are known for their humorous and politically charged attacks against American imperialism. Later contemporary Latino poets such as Willie Perdomo, Edwin Torres (poet) and Caridad de la Luz would follow in this tradition.\n\nClosely tied to Chicano poets is the Native American poet John Trudell who recorded and crossed over with his poetry and music cassettes. Trudell arose from the persecution on his reservation by FBI agents, who allegedly killed his wife and children. Protest is significant with the minority practitioners of performance poetry, such as def poets and slammers. This adds to the vitality of American performance poetry and connects to the social protest of Beat poets like Allen Ginsberg.\n\nIn France, , , and many other represents the way of performance poetry ...\n\nIn the United Kingdom, where the influence of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E was more limited, many \"avant-garde\" poets are deeply committed to continuing the performance of Cobbing and his peers. Well-known names include cris cheek and Aaron Williamson. The work of UK poet Michael Horovitz in spreading this tradition in Britain during the early 1960s should also be acknowledged. His \"Live New Departures\" - a touring version of his poetry and arts journal \"New Departures\" (launched 1959) - gave space and opportunities to poets like Pete Brown and Adrian Mitchell as these three principals combined performed verse with the backing of jazz musicians like pianist Stan Tracey and saxophonist Bobby Wellins. However, the emergence of performed poetry as a popular art form can probably be linked to Allen Ginsberg’s stunning performance at the Albert Hall in 1965 at the International Poetry Incarnation. Horovitz, Brown and Mitchell would join Ginsberg and Beat colleagues Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Gregory Corso and other European poets at that landmark London occasion. These developments were also connected to the emergence of the Liverpool Poets, which referred mainly to the poets Roger McGough, Adrian Henri and Brian Patten who fired up audiences across the UK in the 70s and then the likes of John Hegley emerged in the 80s, influenced as much by stand-up comedy as a love for wordplay, creating the template for what became recognised as contemporary British performance poetry - a format still exemplified by the work of acts such as Murray Lachlan Young, Francesca Beard and Gerard McKeown. Apples and Snakes, a collective promoting performance poetry in pubs and at festivals, was started by Mandy Williams, PR Murry and Jane Addison in London in 1982 inspired by the work of New Variety/CAST. They worked with 'ranting poets' such as Attila the Stockbroker and Seething Wells and other poets and musicians with a political message such as Billy Bragg and Linton Kwesi Johnson. Apples and Snakes continues today, 31 years later, as a national organisation. In the 90s, however, in big cities like Manchester and London, a different style emerged that was influenced more by hip hop with much less emphasis on comedy in the manner of Def Poets in the United States. Well-known writers from this evolution include Lemn Sissay and the late Dike Omeje from the Manchester scene and Roger Robinson and El Crisis from the London circuit.\n\nOn the experimental front, a number of new initiatives have grown around collaborative stage work using poetry and movement. \"ShadoWork\", for instance, aims to 'disrupt and enrich the conventional regimes of author, text and audience' by combining (simple) theatrical movement with the full range of voice and stage in ways designed to draw deeper attention to the text. Developments such as \"ShadoWork\" represent a 'counter-cultural' mode of performance poetry which shuns bald entertainment value, and others such as the \"Tell Tales\" initiative and Jonzi D's \"Lyrikal Fearta\" (which he calls choreo-poetry) go even further, extending spoken word to short prose productions and fusing performance poetry with dance.\n\nBritish performance poetry continues to thrive at a grassroots level, with performances in pubs and theatres, as well as at arts festivals such as Glastonbury and The Edinburgh Fringe. Slams as well as open mics for more traditional writers remain popular. Media works influenced by radio performance poet Hedwig Gorski have gained ground; there has been some crossover into TV and radio. Many contemporary British performance poets have been influenced by punk poets like John Cooper Clarke and reggae poets like Linton Kwesi Johnson as well as by comedy and hip hop. In 2003 the first UK conference of performance poetry, organised by Lucy English, was held at Bath Spa University. Speakers included performing poets from the United States Bob Holman and Charles Bernstein. Bath Spa university runs a performance poetry module as part of its Creative Writing programme.\n\n\n"}

It began broadcasting civilian programming in 1939. The origins of RTS are in Radio-Dakar, created in 1950, that broadcast eight hours per day. In 1951 two channels appear: Dakar Inter and Dakar Afrique, broadcast to listeners across western Africa.\n\nIn 1959 the fusion of Mali and Senegal into the Mali Federation causes the creation of Radio Mali, its bases being in Radio Inter. On August 20, 1960, when Senegal separated from the Mali Federation, Radio Mali became Radio Senegal with two channels: one national and the other international.\n\nIn 1965 the Senegalese government began its first television broadcasts, which come to an end in 1972. However, the Munich Olympics created a demand that incited the Senegalese government to create an institution producing both television and radio broadcasts. The Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision du Sénégal (ORTS) was created in 1973, operating two radio channels and a national television channel.\nOn 4 October 1973, ORTS which had been in talks with Radio Gambia about producing a joint radio programme based on Senegambian history and broadcast in the local languages came to an agreement, and the first ever recording of the programme \"Chossani Senegambia\" (the history of Senegambia) was made. The Gambian team consisted of veteran broadcasters like Alhaji Alieu Ebrima Cham Joof (historian, former Director of Programmes and Head of Local Languages at Radio Gambia), Alhaji Assan Njie (Presenter of Radio Gambia), Alhaji Mansour Njie (historian and Presenter of Radio Gambia, later Presenter of \"Gambia Radio & Television Service\" (GRTS) and Alhaji Ousman Secka. Alhaji Alieu Ebrima Cham Joof (Coordinator of the program for Radio Gambia) travelled to various parts of Senegal and the Gambia accompanied by his team of journalists including Cheickh Jallow, to interview the elders knowledgeable in Senegambian history. The Senegalese team also went to the Gambia to gather materials. Their team included: Ebrima Mbenga (Coordinator of the program for ORTS), Dodou Diego Diop and Alioune Cissé. The programme was pre-recorded and it was scheduled by both Radio Stations to go live at the same time and date (Tuesdays), so that both Gambian and Senegalese listeners can listen to it at the same time. On many occasions, prominent Senegalese historians made live appearances at Radio Gambia studios and vice versa. The programme was generally accompanied by live music from prominent griots like Jali Nyama Suso, Alhaji Bai Konte (on Kora also griot), Alhaji Abdoulaye Samba (or Abdulai Samba, on Xalam also griot) and backing singers. Some of the prominent historians from Senegal that appeared on the programme included: El Hadji Demba Lamin Diouf, Modou Diouf (also known as Captain Modou Diouf - special appearance at Radio Gambia, 1979), El Hadji Mansour Gueye and Gorgi Makura Mboob. From the Gambia they included: Dodou Nying Koliyandeh, Jabell Samba, Alhaji Babou Samba, Alhaji Bamba Suso, Doctor Lamin Mbaye, Alhaji Momodou Lamin Bah and Alhaji Sait Camara. The programme was a success in both Senegal and the Gambia, because no programme like that existed before in neither country.\n\nIn 1992, the ORTS changed its name to the Société Nationale de Radiodiffusion Télévision Sénégalaise (RTS) also changing its structure from government direction to a publicly funded, independently managed corporation.\n\nThe RTS operates multiple national and regional FM radio stations.\n\nThe RTS operates two nationwide television channels, RTS1 and RTS2.\nJoof, Alhaji Alieu Ebrima Cham. \"Senegambia - The land of our heritage.\" (1995). pp 7–12\n\n"}

It was based on the international franchise series \"Rising Star\" itself based on the Israeli singing competition \"HaKokhav HaBa\" (meaning \"The Next Star\") made by Keshet Broadcasting Ltd. The program format lets viewers vote for contestants via mobile apps. It was filmed live in Los Angeles. The show was also carried in Canada, with advertising simultaneous substitution and voting access on CTV.\n\nJesse Kinch was the winner of \"Rising Star\"s first and only season with a vote of 76%. Macy Kate holds the record of highest vote with 93% and she came in 9th place. Daniel & Olivia hold the record of lowest vote with 6% and they came in last place. \"Rising Star\" was cancelled after the season.\n\nIn contrast to other singing competition TV shows which feature a cast of celebrity judges, \"Rising Star\" features a cast of celebrity experts and considers the viewers at home the judges. During each performance, the audience at home was able to decide in real time whether or not a contestant was sent through to the next round by using a mobile voting app.\n\nWhile the viewers at home are considered the \"judges\", the expert panelists (Brad Paisley, Kesha, and Ludacris) also influence the vote. For the first six shows, a yes vote from one of the judges added 7% to the performers total. In the round of 13 it was announced that their yes vote would add 5%. In the quarterfinals the expert's yes vote was lowered to a 3% add. In the semifinals, the expert's yes vote was lowered to a 1% add. In the finale, the expert's yes vote only counts as a home judge vote.\n\nEach performance begins with the contestant singing behind a screen (\"The Wall\"). Once the contestant reaches 70% of \"Yes\" votes, the wall was raised and the contestant goes to the next round of the competition. Alongside the viewers' vote, three of the panelists (excluding the host) have 7% of the vote each, which will be added should they vote \"Yes\".\n\nContestants who make it through the auditions are paired by the judges to face off in a duel (in the event of an odd number of contestants making it through, the contestant who had the highest number of East Coast and West Coast votes but did not make it through the auditions was given a slot in the duels). The first contestant to sing, chosen by a coin toss before the show, sings with the wall up and sets the benchmark for the second contestant. The second contestant sings with the wall down. If the second contestant betters the first contestant's vote total, the wall rises and the second contestant was through to the next round while the first contestant is eliminated; if the second contestant fails to raise the wall, the second contestant is eliminated and the first contestant was through. Also, the losing contestant with the highest number of West Coast votes in each episode was given a save and was through the next round.\n\nAfter the duel rounds end, 13 of the contestants that survived perform. The first 7 contestants perform with the wall up, after which the contestant with the lowest vote total was placed in the hot seat. The subsequent contestants perform with the wall down, and they have to better the vote total of the contestant in the hot seat to raise the wall. If they succeed in doing so, the contestant in the hot seat was eliminated, the contestant with the next lowest vote total was placed in the hot seat, and the performing contestant was provisionally qualified; otherwise, the performing contestant was eliminated if they fail to raise the wall. This continues until the six contestants with the lowest number of votes are eliminated. In addition, the eliminated contestant with the highest number of West Coast votes in each episode was given a save and was through the next round. In this stage, each panelist's vote counts as 5%.\n\nThe quarterfinals and semifinals follow the same format as the Round of Thirteen, except with a few changes to the weightage of the panelists' votes and number of contestants. In the quarterfinals, eight contestants battle for six spots (including the West Coast save), and each panelist's vote counts as 3%. In the semifinals, six contestants battle for four spots (including the West Coast save), and each panelist's vote counts as 1%.\n\nDuring the finale, contestants are paired into a duel. The first contestant sings with the wall up and sets the benchmarks for the second contestant. The second contestant sings with the wall down. If the second contestant gets the higher percentage of votes, then the wall rises and the second contestant moves onto the next round of duels. However, if the second contestant's percentage was lower than the first contestant's, the wall stays down and the contestant was eliminated. In the second round, the two contestants that moved on will duel against each other with their second song. The same process applies for this round, except the running vote total was not revealed and both contestants sing with the wall up. The contestant with the higher vote percentage becomes the winner of Rising Star. The experts' yes vote counts as a home vote as they vote with their phones; their choices are not revealed to both the performers and the audience. The West Coast cannot vote during the finale.\n\nDue to the effects of time zones on North American broadcasting, the show aired at 9 p.m Eastern, 8 p.m. Central, and 7 p.m. Mountain Time Zones. To accommodate the Mountain Time Zone (which usually does not carry any live programming with the Eastern and Central time zones and airs it on an hour delay), ABC rotated the usual 7 p.m. MT program, Wipeout to air at 8 p.m. MT instead out of \"Rising Star\". Additionally, the network's affiliates in the Caribbean Sea region, including Aguadilla, Puerto Rico's WPRU-LP and WSVI in the United States Virgin Islands broadcast the series live, despite being an hour ahead in the Atlantic Time Zone (as they both take ABC's Eastern feed an hour ahead).\n\nIn the state of Arizona, which does not observe Daylight Saving Time, the program aired live at 6 p.m. local time. For Pacific and Alaskan time zone viewers, a dedicated feed was provided to show real-time voting particular to these viewers and a comparison to how the earlier time zones voted. In an instance where a contestant who didn't pass based on viewers from the Eastern, Central, and Mountain Time Zones, yet ends up faring better with the Pacific and Alaskan time zones, the contestant would pass. In addition, a \"West Coast save\" was given to the losing contestant with the highest number of West Coast votes in the post-audition rounds, except for the finale.\n\nAs Alaska is one hour before the Pacific Time Zone, and programming normally airs similar to Central and Mountain time, Alaskans was able to participate live as well. However, residents of Hawaii were unable to participate since Hawaii time is two hours behind Pacific Time. Likewise, viewers in the other western insular islands such as American Samoa, Guam and Northern Mariana Islands had no means to participate whatsoever, as network programming on the affiliates of those islands is usually delayed by a day as it would be early morning if it did air live.\n\nDuring West Coast broadcasts, live cut-ins to show reactions of contestants who passed only with West Coast viewers were displayed. There was no revocation of \"pass\" status if West Coast viewers rejected a contestant during the initial audition rounds. ABC stated that the chances of the West Coast differing substantially from other viewers was statistically small; however, in weeks 8 and 9 of the competition, West Coast votes differed enough from East Coast votes that contestants Maneepat Myra Molloy and Audrey Kate Geiger were saved over other contestants who had higher totals on the East Coast.\n\nFor CTV viewers in Canada, broadcasts originally followed the ABC model through all time zones, but switched partway through the season so all CTV stations across Canada aired the show live with the Eastern feed.\n\nThe winners shown in Bold.\nThis season's host was Josh Groban. The panel of experts consisted of Brad Paisley, Kesha and Ludacris.\n\nJune 22, 2014\nJune 29, 2014\nJuly 6, 2014\nJuly 13–27, 2014\n\nAugust 3, 2014\nThe Experts' votes count as 5%.\nAugust 10, 2014\nThe Experts' votes count as 3%.\nAugust 17, 2014\nThe Experts' votes count as 1%.\nAugust 24, 2014\nThe experts voted on their phones, making theirs count as equal to a home judge's vote, as well as keeping their votes secret from the performers and the audience.

{"id": "62808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62808", "title": "Soul music", "text": "Soul music\n\nSoul music (often referred to simply as soul) is a popular music genre that originated in the African American community in the United States in the 1950s and early 1960s. It combines elements of African-American gospel music, rhythm and blues and jazz. Soul music became popular for dancing and listening in the United States, where record labels such as Motown, Atlantic and Stax were influential during the Civil Rights Movement. Soul also became popular around the world, directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa.\n\nAccording to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, soul is \"music that arose out of the black experience in America through the transmutation of gospel and rhythm & blues into a form of funky, secular testifying\". Catchy rhythms, stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body moves, are an important feature of soul music. Other characteristics are a call and response between the lead vocalist and the chorus and an especially tense vocal sound. The style also occasionally uses improvisational additions, twirls and auxiliary sounds. Soul music reflected the African-American identity and it stressed the importance of an African-American culture. The new-found African-American consciousness led to new styles of music, which boasted pride in being black.\n\nSoul music dominated the U.S. R&B chart in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the U.S., Britain and elsewhere. By 1968, the soul music genre had begun to splinter. Some soul artists developed funk music, while other singers and groups developed slicker, more sophisticated, and in some cases more politically conscious varieties. By the early 1970s, soul music had been influenced by psychedelic rock and other genres, leading to psychedelic soul. The United States saw the development of neo soul around 1994. There are also several other subgenres and offshoots of soul music.\n\nThe key subgenres of soul include the Detroit (Motown) style, a rhythmic music influenced by gospel; \"deep soul\" and \"southern soul\", driving, energetic soul styles combining R&B with southern gospel music sounds; Memphis soul, a shimmering, sultry style; New Orleans soul, which came out of the rhythm and blues style; Chicago soul, a lighter gospel-influenced sound; Philadelphia soul, a lush orchestral sound with doo-wop-inspired vocals; psychedelic soul, a blend of psychedelic rock and soul music; as well as categories such as blue-eyed soul, which is soul music performed by white artists; British soul; and Northern soul, rare soul music played by DJs at nightclubs in Northern England.\n\nSoul music has its roots in traditional African-American gospel music and rhythm and blues and as the hybridization of their respective religious and secular styles – in both lyrical content and instrumentation – that began in the 1950s. The term \"soul\" had been used among African-American musicians to emphasize the feeling of being an African-American in the United States. According to musicologist Barry Hansen,Though this hybrid produced a clutch of hits in the R&B market in the early 1950s, only the most adventurous white fans felt its impact at the time; the rest had to wait for the coming of soul music in the 1960s to feel the rush of rock and roll sung gospel-style.\n\nAccording to AllMusic, \"[s]oul music was the result of the urbanization and commercialization of rhythm and blues in the '60s.\" The phrase \"soul music\" itself, referring to gospel-style music with secular lyrics, was first attested in 1961. The term \"soul\" in African-American parlance has connotations of African-American pride and culture. Gospel groups in the 1940s and '50s occasionally used the term as part of their names. The jazz style that originated from gospel became known as soul jazz. As singers and arrangers began using techniques from both gospel and soul jazz in African-American popular music during the 1960s, soul music gradually functioned as an umbrella term for the African-American popular music at the time.\n\nImportant innovators whose recordings in the 1950s contributed to the emergence of soul music included Clyde McPhatter, Hank Ballard, and Etta James. Ray Charles is often cited as popularizing the soul music genre with his series of hits, starting with 1954's \"I Got a Woman\". Singer Bobby Womack said, \"Ray was the genius. He turned the world onto soul music.\" Charles was open in acknowledging the influence of Pilgrim Travelers vocalist Jesse Whitaker on his singing style.\n\nLittle Richard, who inspired Otis Redding, and James Brown both were equally influential. Brown was nicknamed the \"Godfather of Soul Music\", and Richard proclaimed himself as the \"King of Rockin' and Rollin', Rhythm and Blues Soulin'\", because his music embodied elements of all three, and since he inspired artists in all three genres.\n\nSam Cooke and Jackie Wilson also are often acknowledged as soul forefathers. Cooke became popular as the lead singer of the gospel group The Soul Stirrers, before controversially moving into secular music. His recording of \"You Send Me\" in 1957 launched a successful pop music career. Furthermore, his 1962 recording of \"Bring It On Home To Me\" has been described as \"perhaps the first record to define the soul experience\". Jackie Wilson, a contemporary of both Cooke and James Brown, also achieved crossover success, especially with his 1957 hit \"Reet Petite\". He even was particularly influential for his dramatic delivery and performances.\n\nWriter Peter Guralnick is among those to identify Solomon Burke as a key figure in the emergence of soul music, and Atlantic Records as the key record label. Burke's early 1960s songs, including \"Cry to Me\", \"Just Out of Reach\" and \"Down in the Valley\" are considered classics of the genre. Guralnick wrote: \"Soul started, in a sense, with the 1961 success of Solomon Burke's \"Just Out Of Reach\". Ray Charles, of course, had already enjoyed enormous success (also on Atlantic), as had James Brown and Sam Cooke — primarily in a pop vein. Each of these singers, though, could be looked upon as an isolated phenomenon; it was only with the coming together of Burke and Atlantic Records that you could begin to see anything even resembling a movement.\"\nBen E. King also achieved success in 1961 with \"Stand By Me\", a song directly based on a gospel hymn. By the mid-1960s, the initial successes of Burke, King and others had been surpassed by new soul singers, including Stax artists such as Otis Redding and Wilson Pickett, who mainly recorded in Memphis, Tennessee, and Muscle Shoals, Alabama. According to Jon Landau:\"Between 1962 and 1964 Redding recorded a series of soul ballads characterized by unabashedly sentimental lyrics usually begging forgiveness or asking a girlfriend to come home... He soon became known as \"Mr. Pitiful\" and earned a reputation as the leading performer of soul ballads.\"\n\nThe most important female soul singer to emerge was Aretha Franklin, originally a gospel singer who began to make secular recordings in 1960 but whose career was later revitalised by her recordings for Atlantic. Her 1967 recordings, such as \"I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)\", \"Respect\" (originally sung by Otis Redding), and \"Do Right Woman, Do Right Man\" (written by Chips Moman and Dan Penn), were significant and commercially successful productions.\n\nSoul music dominated the U.S. African-American music charts in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the U.S. Otis Redding was a huge success at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. The genre also became highly popular in the UK, where many leading acts toured in the late 1960s. \"Soul\" became an umbrella term, used to describe an increasingly wide variety of R&B-based music styles – from the dance and pop-oriented acts at Motown Records in Detroit, such as The Temptations, Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder, to \"deep soul\" performers such as Percy Sledge and James Carr. Different regions and cities within the U.S., including New York City, Detroit, Chicago, Memphis, New Orleans, Philadelphia, and Muscle Shoals, Alabama (the home of FAME Studios and Muscle Shoals Sound Studios) became noted for different subgenres of the music and recording styles.\n\nBy 1968, while at its peak of popularity, soul began to fragment into disparate subgenres. Artists such as James Brown and Sly & the Family Stone evolved into funk music, while other singers such as Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Curtis Mayfield and Al Green developed slicker, more sophisticated and in some cases more politically conscious varieties of the genre. However, soul music continued to evolve, informing most subsequent forms of R&B from the 1970s-onward, with pockets of musicians continuing to perform in traditional soul style.\n\nLater examples of soul music include recordings by The Staple Singers (such as \"I'll Take You There\"), and Al Green's 1970s recordings, done at Willie Mitchell's' Royal Recording in Memphis. Mitchell's Hi Records continued in the Stax tradition of the previous decade, releasing a string of hits by Green, Ann Peebles, Otis Clay, O.V. Wright and Syl Johnson. Bobby Womack, who recorded with Chips Moman in the late 1960s, continued to produce soul recordings in the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name=\"Hurt (Womak/Moman)\"></ref><ref name=\"Graceland (Womak/Moman)\"></ref>\n\nIn Detroit, producer Don Davis worked with Stax artists such as Johnnie Taylor and The Dramatics.<ref name=\"Hogan (Davis/AllMusic)\"></ref> Early 1970s recordings by The Detroit Emeralds, such as \"Do Me Right\", are a link between soul and the later disco style.<ref name=\"Wynn (Detroit Emeralds/AllMusic)\"></ref> Motown Records artists such as Marvin Gaye, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder and Smokey Robinson contributed to the evolution of soul music, although their recordings were considered more in a pop music vein than those of Redding, Franklin and Carr. Although stylistically different from classic soul music, recordings by Chicago-based artists are often considered part of the genre.\n\nBy the early 1970s, soul music had been influenced by psychedelic rock and other genres. The social and political ferment of the times inspired artists like Gaye and Curtis Mayfield to release album-length statements with hard-hitting social commentary. Artists like James Brown led soul towards funk music, which became typified by 1970s bands like Parliament-Funkadelic and The Meters. More versatile groups such as War, the Commodores, and Earth, Wind and Fire became popular around this time. During the 1970s, some slick and commercial blue-eyed soul acts like Philadelphia's Hall & Oates and Oakland's Tower of Power achieved mainstream success, as did a new generation of street-corner harmony or \"city-soul\" groups such as The Delfonics and the historically black Howard University's Unifics.<ref name=\"Erlewine (Hall/Oats)\"></ref>\n\nThe syndicated music/dance variety television series \"Soul Train\", hosted by Chicago native Don Cornelius, debuted in 1971. The show provided an outlet for soul music for several decades, also spawning a franchise that saw the creation of a record label (Soul Train Records) that distributed music by The Whispers, Carrie Lucas, and an up-and-coming group known as Shalamar. Numerous disputes led to Cornelius spinning off the record label to his talent booker, Dick Griffey, who transformed the label into Solar Records, itself a prominent soul music label throughout the 1980s. The TV series continued to air until 2006, although other predominantly African-American music genres such as hip-hop began overshadowing soul on the show beginning in the 1980s.\n\nAs disco and funk musicians had hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s, soul went in the direction of quiet storm. With its relaxed tempos and soft melodies, quiet storm soul took influences from fusion and adult contemporary. Some funk bands, such as EW&F, The Commodores and Con Funk Shun would have a few quiet storm tracks on their albums. Among the most successful acts in this era include Smokey Robinson, Jefrry Osbourne, Peabo Bryson, Chaka Kahn, and Larry Graham.\n\nAfter the decline of disco and funk in the early 1980s, soul music became influenced by electro music. It became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a style known as contemporary R&B, which sounded very different from the original rhythm and blues style. The United States saw the development of neo-soul around 1994. Mainstream record label marketing support for soul genres cooled in the 2000s due to the industry's re-focus on hip-hop.\n\nBerry Gordy's successful Tamla/Motown group of labels was notable for being African-American owned, unlike most of the earlier independent R&B labels. Notable artists under this label were The Supremes, The Temptations, The Miracles, the Four Tops, The Marvelettes, Mary Wells, Jr. Walker & The All-Stars, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Tammi Terrell, Martha and the Vandellas, and The Jackson Five.\n\nHits were made using a quasi-industrial \"production-line\" approach. Some considered the sound to be mechanistic, but the producers and songwriters brought artistic sensitivity to the three-minute tunes. Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier and Eddie Holland were rarely out of the charts for their work as songwriters and record producers for The Supremes, the Four Tops and Martha and the Vandellas. They allowed important elements to shine through the dense musical texture. Rhythm was emphasized by handclaps or tambourine. Smokey Robinson was another writer and record producer who added lyrics to \"The Tracks of My Tears\" by his group The Miracles, which was one of the most important songs of the decade.\n\nStax Records and Atlantic Records were independent labels that produced high-quality dance records featuring many well known singers of the day. They tended to have smaller ensembles marked by expressive gospel-tinged vocals. Brass and saxophones were also used extensively. Stax Records, founded by siblings Estelle and James Stewart, was the second most successful record label behind Motown Records. They were responsible for releasing hits by Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, The Staple Singers and many more. Ahmet Ertegun, who had anticipated being a diplomat until 1944 when his father died, founded Atlantic Records in 1947 with his friend Herb Abramson. Ertegun wrote many songs for Ray Charles and The Clovers. He even sang backup vocals for his artist Big Joe Turner on the song, \"Shake Rattle and Roll.\"\n\nDominated by Berry Gordy's Motown Records empire, Detroit soul is strongly rhythmic and influenced by gospel music. The Motown sound often includes hand clapping, a powerful bassline, violins and bells. Motown Records' house band was The Funk Brothers. AllMusic cites Motown as the pioneering label of pop-soul, a style of soul music with raw vocals, but polished production and toned-down subject matter intended for pop radio and crossover success. Artists of this style included Diana Ross, the Jackson 5, Stevie Wonder, and Billy Preston. Popular during the 1960s, the style became glossier during the 1970s and led to disco.\n\nThe terms \"deep soul\" and \"southern soul\" generally refer to a driving, energetic soul style combining R&B's energy with pulsating southern United States gospel music sounds. Memphis, Tennessee label Stax Records nurtured a distinctive sound, which included putting vocals further back in the mix than most contemporary R&B records, using vibrant horn parts in place of background vocals, and a focus on the low end of the frequency spectrum. The vast majority of Stax releases were backed by house bands Booker T and the MGs (with Booker T. Jones, Steve Cropper, Duck Dunn, and Al Jackson) and the Memphis Horns (the splinter horn section of the Mar-Keys, trumpeter Wayne Jackson and saxophonist Andrew Love).\n\n\"Memphis soul\" is a shimmering, sultry style of soul music produced in the 1960s and 1970s at Stax Records and Hi Records in Memphis, Tennessee. It featured melancholic and melodic horns, Hammond organ, bass, and drums, as heard in recordings by Hi's Al Green and Stax's Booker T. & the M.G.'s. The latter group also sometimes played in the harder-edged Southern soul style. The Hi Records house band (Hi Rhythm Section) and producer Willie Mitchell developed a surging soul style heard in the label's 1970s hit recordings. Some Stax recordings fit into this style, but had their own unique sound.\n\nImpactful and underrated Birmingham soul is a driving and strongly rhythmic style that combined elements of gospel music with the uptempo energy of R&B. As a soul city it is thoroughly influenced by the hard driving \"southern soul\" of the Civil Rights Movement era and the musical and social legacy of that time. The rise of Muscle Shoals Alabama as a recording center was in part influenced by professional musicians coming north from Birmingham such as Barry Beckett of the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section also known as the \"Swampers\" and bringing their musical influence with them to the Tennessee Valley. Similarly Detroit soul is influenced to a large extent by Birmingham and its downhome soul roots because many of its performers had migrated north from Alabama as well. The most notable are 3/5 of the Temptations, Melvin Franklin of Montgomery, and Paul Williams, and Eddie Kendricks both of Birmingham.\n\nThe New Orleans soul scene directly came out of the rhythm and blues era, when such artists as Little Richard, Fats Domino, and Huey Piano Smith made a huge impact on the pop and R&B charts and a huge direct influence on the birth of Funk music. The principal architect of Crescent City's soul was songwriter, arranger, and producer Allen Toussaint. He worked with such artists as Irma Thomas (\"the Soul Queen of New Orleans\"), Jessie Hill, Chris Kenner, Benny Spellman, and Ernie K. Doe on the Minit/Instant label complex to produce a distinctive New Orleans soul sound that generated a passel of national hits. Other notable New Orleans hits came from Robert Parker, Betty Harris, and Aaron Neville. While record labels in New Orleans largely disappeared by the mid-1960s, producers in the city continued to record New Orleans soul artists for other mainly New York City- and Los Angeles-based record labels—notably Lee Dorsey for New York–based Amy Records and the Meters for New York–based Josie and then LA-based Reprise.\n\nChicago soul generally had a light gospel-influenced sound, but the large number of record labels based in the city tended to produce a more diverse sound than other cities. Vee Jay Records, which lasted until 1966, produced recordings by Jerry Butler, Betty Everett, Dee Clark, and Gene Chandler. Chess Records, mainly a blues and rock and roll label, produced a number of major soul artists, including The Dells and Billy Stewart. Curtis Mayfield not only scored many hits with his group, The Impressions, but wrote many hit songs for Chicago artists and produced hits on his own labels for The Fascinations, Major Lance, and the Five Stairsteps.\n\nBased primarily in the Philadelphia International record label, Philadelphia soul (or Philly Soul) had a lush orchestral sound and doo-wop-inspired vocals. Thom Bell, and Kenneth Gamble & Leon Huff are considered the founders of Philadelphia soul, which produced hits for The O'Jays, The Intruders, The Delfonics, The Stylistics, Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes, and The Spinners.\n\nPsychedelic soul, sometimes known as \"black rock\", was a blend of psychedelic rock and soul music in the late 1960s, which paved the way for the mainstream emergence of funk music a few years later. Early pioneers of this subgenre of soul music include Jimi Hendrix, Sly and the Family Stone, Norman Whitfield, and Isaac Hayes. While psychedelic rock began its decline, the influence of psychedelic soul continued on and remained prevalent through the 1970s.\n\nBlue-eyed soul is R&B or soul music performed by white artists. The meaning of \"blue-eyed soul\" has evolved over decades. Originally the term was associated with mid-1960s white artists who performed soul and R&B that was similar to the music released by Motown Records and Stax Records. The Righteous Brothers, The Rascals, Spencer Davis Group, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison & Them and The Grass roots were famous Blue-eyed soul musicians in 1960s. The term continued to be used in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly by the British media to refer to a new generation of singers who adopted elements of the Stax and Motown sounds. To a lesser extent, the term has been applied to singers in other music genres that are influenced by soul music. Artists like Hall and Oates, David Bowie, Teena Marie, Hamilton, Joe Frank & Raynolds, Frankie Vali, Christina Aguilera, Amy Winehouse and Adele are known as Blue-eyed soul singers.\n\nSoul has been a major influence on British popular music since the 1960s including bands of the British Invasion, most significantly The Beatles. There were a handful of significant British Blue-eyed soul acts, including Dusty Springfield and Tom Jones. In 70s Carl Douglas, Real Thing and Delegation had hits in UK chart. American soul was extremely popular among some youth sub-cultures like the Mod, Northern soul and Modern soul movements, but a clear genre of British soul did not emerge until the 1980s when a number of artists including George Michael, Sade, Simply Red, Lisa Stansfield and Soul II Soul enjoyed commercial success. The popularity of British soul artists in the U.S., most notably Amy Winehouse, Adele, Estelle, Duffy, Joss Stone and Leona Lewis, led to talk of a \"third British Invasion\" or soul invasion in the 2000s and 2010s.\n\nThe term \"neo soul\" is a marketing phrase coined in the early 1990s by producer and record label executive Kedar Massenburg to describe a blend of 1970s soul-style vocals and instrumentation with contemporary R&B sounds, hip-hop beats and poetic interludes. The style was developed in the early to mid-1990s. A key element in neo soul is a heavy dose of Fender Rhodes or Wurlitzer electric piano \"pads\" over a mellow, grooving interplay between the drums (usually with a rim shot snare sound) and a muted, deep funky bass. The Fender Rhodes piano sound gives the music a warm, organic character.\n\nThe phrase \"northern soul\" was coined by journalist Dave Godin and popularised in 1970 through his column in \"Blues and Soul\" magazine. The term refers to rare soul music that was played by DJs at nightclubs in northern England. The playlists originally consisted of obscure 1960s and early 1970s American soul recordings with an uptempo beat, such as those on Motown Records and more obscure labels such as Okeh Records. Modern soul developed when northern soul DJs began looking in record shops in the United States and United Kingdom for music that was more complex and contemporary. What emerged was a richer sound that was more advanced in terms of Hi-Fi and FM radio technology.\n\nHyper soul can be described to be a medley of soul and dance music. It maintains the vocal quality, techniques, and style but includes a movement towards technology, materialism, and heightened sexuality and sensationalism in the rhythm and lyricism. It is also remarkable for possessing a more euro sound influence than the other subgenres of soul. The subgenre provides more roles that may be adopted by the song's female subjects and more space to express different facets of gender experience as compared to traditional soul, through the reversal of male-female dynamics and the embrace of dominating and confrontational attitudes. Performers included Timbaland, Aaliyah, Whitney Houston and Destiny's Child. Hypersoul maybe also be seen as a precursor to modern R&B.\n\nMany artists in various genres of electronic music (such as house, drum n bass, UK garage, and downtempo) are heavily influenced by soul, and have produced many soul-inspired compositions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "911827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=911827", "title": "Sound system (DJ)", "text": "Sound system (DJ)\n\nA sound system is a group of DJs and audio engineers contributing and working together as one, playing and producing music over a large PA system or sound reinforcement system, typically for a dance event or party.\n\nThe sound system concept originated in the 1950s in Kingston, Jamaica. DJs would load up a truck with a generator, turntables, and huge speakers to set up street parties. The sound system scene is generally regarded as an important part of Jamaican cultural history and as being responsible for the rise of modern Jamaican musical styles such as ska, rocksteady, reggae and dub. When Jamaicans emigrated to the United Kingdom, the sound system culture followed and became firmly rooted there in the 1970s. It is still strongly linked with those Jamaican-originated music genres, and some bands or producers still call themselves sound systems, such as Dub Narcotic Sound System and the On-U Sound System. When Asian Dub Foundation are advertised as \"Asian Dub Foundation\", the whole band performs, but when they announce themselves as \"Asian Dub Foundation Sound System\", members of the band mix and play music (by other artists, as well as their own) while one or two MCs rap over the songs like DJ Pro. The term also has become connected with sound reinforcement systems by DJs such as the Valve Sound System.\n\nRecording and performing artists who began as sound systems include Soul II Soul and Massive Attack.\n\nThe term \"sound system\" is also used to refer to a free party sound system, also known as a rig. The equipment includes a van, loudspeakers, amplifiers, turntable decks and cables. Larger rigs might also have a fog machine, stage lighting, video projectors and an electrical generator; the generator enables the sound system to be set up anywhere. A sound system collective is usually five or more people, with larger sound systems having more members. Equipment is owned by some and others are DJs, record producers or enthusiastic ravers who help out. They will be the people who organise free parties and teknivals and will be a group of friends with similar interests. Some owners purposely use second hand equipment, to reduce their risk if the equipment is stolen or damaged. This type of rig is called a \"suicide rig\" and usually used at insecure locations where it may get stolen or damaged and if it is suspected that police will have knowledge of the party.\n\nSometimes a sound system collective is well known for its wide travels. This type of collective can be described as modern Nomad tribes or New age travellers. In this context the word sound system is used interchangeably to describe either the group of people or the equipment. The techno travelling scene of the 1990s was made of sound system crews like Bedlam sound system and Spiral Tribe. The free party community has been criticized for the unkempt appearance of attendees to such events, accusations of substance abuse of illegal drugs such as MDMA, ketamine, amphetamines and LSD, and complaints about messes left behind by such parties have given the scene a negative reputation. However, despite such complaints, the scene continues to grow with a large following in Bristol, Abergavenny, Newport, London, Devon and Cornwall.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35733334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35733334", "title": "Spanish Golden Age theatre", "text": "Spanish Golden Age theatre\n\nSpanish Golden Age theatre refers to theatre in Spain roughly between 1590 and 1681. Spain emerged as a European power after it was unified by the marriage of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile in 1469 and then claimed for Christianity at the Siege of Granada in 1492. The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries saw a monumental increase in the production of live theatre as well as the in importance of the arts within Spanish society.\n\nTheatre was an accessible art form for all participants in Renaissance Spain, being both highly sponsored by the aristocratic class and highly attended by the lower classes. The volume and variety of Spanish plays during the Golden Age was unprecedented in the history of world theatre, surpassing even the dramatic production of the English Renaissance by a factor of at least four. This volume has been as much a source of criticism as praise for Spanish Golden Age theatre, for emphasizing quantity before quality. A large number of the plays of this period (10,000 to 30,000) are still considered masterpieces today. This prolific production greatly contributed to the accessibility of theatre in Spain. For modern theatre historians, however, it has contributed to the difficulty of researching theatre from this period. The vast majority of plays have remained virtually untouched, in terms of both production and scholarly analysis, since the seventeenth century. Combined with the error prone printing techniques that plagued the publication of Spanish plays, this has vastly undercut the study of Spanish Golden Age theatre. Although a thorough inclusive analysis remains difficult or even impossible, Spanish Golden Age theatre represents an area of active and productive research for theatre historians.\n\nNoted for its variety, the theatre of Renaissance Spain was the only in Europe to simultaneously include secular and religious dramas. Additionally, state sponsored drama existed harmoniously alongside popular for-profit theatre, with many theatre artists contributing significantly to both. Stylistically, plays ranged from straight plays to operas and from bawdy comedies to epic tragedies. Spain also introduced its own forms and genres of theatre with the development of the Comedia nueva and the zarzuela.\n\n\n\n\nHonor is a major theme in Spanish Golden Age drama. Theatre was used as a metaphor for life, and honor was therefore represented in a number of ways on stage, for example, reputation, and juxtaposed against disillusionment and hypocrisy. Right versus wrong is a common theme in plays from this period and Lope de Vega himself believed that everyone reacts to honor. Honorable (Christian) conduct is enforced by the public and to lose your honor is to live in shame and despair. A large number of plots focus on the fear of lost reputation and on masculine honor based on women's chastity. While women seem to control their men's honor, gender roles are only very conservatively challenged. While poverty is everywhere, the plays are filled with picturesque scenes, glorious churches, and courts. Still, the playwrights of the time throw a bit of cynicism in their work. The stock character of the gracioso (disillusioned clown) survives the stories without even wondering about right and wrong.\n\n\nAfter 1603 only licensed companies could work in Spain, and licenses were limited in availability. Unemployed actors joined the compañías de la legua (“companies of the road”) and performed in the countryside. Companies could not perform in one place for more than two months annually, and only one company was permitted to perform at that location. In 1615, Madrid assumed control and hired companies made up of actor-managers (autores), actors, and apprentices, subject to government rules. These companies were licensed by the Royal Council and highly paid to perform Autos Sacramentales both in court and at public theatres. Actors generally worked for managers under a 1 to 2-year contract and a typical schedule had actors study their role from 2am to 9am, rehearse until noon, take a break to eat, then perform until 7pm. While women were licensed to perform starting in 1587, this practice remained controversial until 1599, when a royal decree stipulated that only women married to company members could perform. Important performers included Lope de Rueda and later Juan Rana.\n\nCostumes during this time were very similar to Elizabethan or English Renaissance theatre costumes. Actors dressed as lavishly as finances permitted and contracts even had special allowances for costumes. Records show that actors paid anywhere from 1/5 to 1/2 of their salary for one costume and some even petitioned civic officials for extra funds for costumes. Towns gave awards for acting and costumes, showing that the quality of the costumes was quite important to the audience. The government made many rules dictating the specifications of costumes. For example, actors performing in Auto Sacramentales had to wear silk or velvet and women were forbidden to wear strange headdresses, décolleté necklines, or wide-hooped or non-floor length skirts. As well, actors were only allowed to wear one costume per play, unless it was specifically stated in the text.\n\nThree kinds of scenic background were utilized: the facade; the curtains concealing the facade, which were used when the location was not particularly important; and medieval-type mansions, which were sometimes erected on the main stage. As spectacle increased after 1650, painted flats with doors and windows were set into the facade in place of curtains. After a period of time, awnings were rigged over the seating, and, eventually, the addition of a permanent roof made it an indoor theatre. In the 1640s and 1650s set designs of new public and court theatres were supervised by Italian designers. Machines that simulated wind and the sounds of thunder (created with metal sheets or dropping planks of wood), rain (similar to a large rainstick, and a swelling ocean were quite common and delighted theatregoers of this time. Musicians were also commonly used to create moods and important sound effects.\n\nUnlike the rest of Europe, Spain had unique theatre traditions. Religious plays continued to be produced and popular into the 1700s, religious and secular theatre thrived side by side, and actors were accepted in church and as worthwhile members of society. As well, Spain pioneered a three-act model for plays instead of the classic five acts, allowed women on stage, and had an organized and efficient system of actor contracts, travel stipends, licenses, and booking. Most importantly, Spanish Golden Age theatre produced wonderful politically and philosophically allegorical plays such as Calderon's \"Life is a Dream\", and Lope de Vega's \"Fuente Ovejuna\", that spoke specifically to the audience of the time.\n\nThe sources of influence for the emerging national theatre of Spain were as diverse as the theatre that nation produced during the Golden Age. Storytelling traditions originating in Italian Commedia dell'arte and the uniquely Spanish expression of Western Europe's traveling minstrel entertainments contributed a populist influence on the narratives and the music, respectively, of early Spanish theatre. Neo-Aristotelian criticism and liturgical dramas, on the other hand, contributed literary and moralistic perspectives. In turn, Spanish Golden Age theatre has dramatically influenced the theatre of later generations in Europe and throughout the world. Spanish drama had an immediate and significant impact on the contemporary developments in English Renaissance theatre. It has also had a lasting impact on theatre throughout the Spanish speaking world. Currently, a growing number of works are being translated, increasing the reach of Spanish Golden Age theatre and strengthening its reputation among critics and theatre patrons.\n\n"}

Miller (May 6, 1968 – April 22, 2008) was an American animal trainer, wrangler, and stunt double who was killed by a bear while making a promotional video. Miller had worked as a trainer at Predators in Action, an animal training facility operated by his cousin, Randy Miller, that trains wild and exotic animals for film and television appearances. At the time of his death, Miller was not working as a trainer, but was attempting to perform a bear wrestling stunt supervised by Randy Miller.\n\nMiller was an experienced animal trainer who had worked for Predators in Action for several years before leaving to pursue other business ventures. Although he was not the trainer for the bear that killed him, he was experienced with bears, having helped Randy Miller raise and train a previous bear named Dakota. Films in which animals trained by the facility appeared (including after Miller's departure) include \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\", \"Gladiator\", \"The Postman\", \"The Last Samurai, and Semi-Pro\". Predators in Action animals have also appeared on Discovery Channel and National Geographic Society programs in which they recreated famous animal attacks, including the mauling of Roy Horn by a white tiger.\n\nOn April 22, 2008, while filming a promotional video at the Predators in Action facility, Miller was killed by a 4-year old grizzly bear named Rocky. Rocky was a bear actor who had been trained to wrestle humans. At that time, he was best known for his appearance as \"Dewey the Killer Bear\" in the 2008 film \"Semi-Pro\", in which he wrestled Will Ferrell's body double Randy Miller. Stephan Miller had asked to be filmed wrestling Rocky for an advertisement. Although Stephan Miller had not been involved in training Rocky, Randy Miller agreed to the request because Stephan Miller was an experienced trainer and had also recently been in a photoshoot with Rocky and gotten to know him slightly. \n\nThe plan was to first take some shots of Stephan Miller and Rocky casually standing next to each other and then later begin the staged wrestling match. However, during the initial shots, Rocky stood up in his trained wrestling posture and began the staged attack too early, catching Miller off guard without his arm raised in the proper defensive position. Randy Miller then hit Rocky with a cane, trying to make him let go of Stephan, an action that Randy later said might have unwittingly escalated the bear attack. The 7½-foot-tall, 700-pound bear bit Stephan Miller on the neck once, piercing his jugular vein and carotid artery. An autopsy revealed that he died within minutes of the attack.\n\nFollowing Stephan Miller's death, the California Department of Fish and Game initiated a probe into the events of the attack with the intent to eventually decide whether Rocky would be euthanized. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and other animal rights groups, who have long protested use of wild animals in films, called for Rocky to be spared and to be allowed to retire to a zoo or another similar facility.\n\nIt was later revealed on the National Geographic Channel program \"Grizzly Face to Face: Hollywood Bear Tragedy\" that the coroner's office and the California Department of Fish and Game ruled Miller's death accidental and did not order that the bear be euthanized. However, Rocky was required to live under restrictions and was no longer able to have contact with persons other than his trainers. He could no longer be exhibited or used for film or TV work. In \"Grizzly Face to Face\", Randy Miller stated that he planned to continue working with Rocky and try to get the restrictions lifted because he believed that Stephan would have wanted that.\n\nIn 2012, the California Fish and Game Commission considered whether to lift the restrictions on Rocky's permit to allow him to again work in the state of California. According to Randy Miller and Rocky's legal team, new safety protocols had been put in place; other animal trainers and experts had supplied testimony that Rocky was not dangerous; a petition drive had shown that many persons from around the world supported his return to work; and the U.S. Department of Agriculture had cleared him to work, with the only remaining restrictions being in California, the location of most available work for Rocky. Following a hearing on October 3, 2012, the Commission decided not to remove Rocky's permit restrictions.\n\nIn addition to his work with animals, Miller was also a co-publisher for the first three print issues of \"Girls and Corpses\" magazine with publisher/editor-in-chief Robert Steven Rhine, as well as being actively involved in the launch of the ShareNow social networking website.\n\n\n"}

During the 1980s, many Soviet programmes were airing such as the children's show \"Nu Pogodi!\".\n\nFrom 1992 onwards television went into a steep decline as a result of the war in the city of Kabul, destroying infrastructure.\n\nDuring the Taliban rule between 1996 and 2001, television was strictly banned.

It includes a soundtrack of Islamic songs in English, performed by young Muslims.\n\nThe story surrounds a young boy called Obaid. He is confronted with a choice to live an easy life in this world or to struggle for reward in the hereafter. The story takes place during the tyrannical rule of King Narsis, who controls his people by encouraging them to worship idols and frightening them with the magic of Cinatas, his evil sorcerer. Cinatas chooses Obaid to be his student, someone who will assist him in his magic. At first, the boy is tempted by dreams of the power and the influence he will wield as the king's next sorcerer. But, soon after he starts to question his priorities. He begins talking to a righteous and a very holy man, who opens his mind to the true meaning of life.\n\nThis righteous man tells Obaid that there is only one God, Allah Almighty and that He created mankind to worship Him alone.

{"id": "5222672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5222672", "title": "Thomas Barrasford", "text": "Thomas Barrasford\n\nThomas Barrasford (1859–1910) was a 19th-century English business entrepreneur and entertainment impresario, who owned and built a number of theatres across Britain under the Barrasford Halls brand.\n\nBorn in South Shields, County Durham, the son of a Newcastle upon Tyne publican, Barrasford attended the Royal Scotch Arms pub, and noticed its transformation under his later competitors Moss and Thornton into the Empire Music Hall in 1890. In 1895, in partnership with a man named Varah, Barrasford took over the wooden circus on the Ormond Street, Jarrow, turning it into a music hall, known as the Jarrow Palace of Varieties.\n\nExpanding his empire quickly from 1899, he acquired the Leeds Tivoli theatre, renaming it the Leeds Hippodrome on 20 March 1899. This was his first encounter with fellow impresario Sir Oswald Stoll, whose chain had just opened the Leed Empire theatre, whose features and scale had, less than two months later, brought about the failure of the lessor and resultant sale of the Tivoli to Barrasford. Barrasford noticed that fellow impresario Frank MacNaughten in Bradford had countered the opening of the Stoll Bradford Empire in January 1899, by using an idea pioneered by George \"Champagne Charlie\" Laybourne in 1870 in his Wear music hall, offering a \"twice nightly\" performance schedule. The formula proved so successful at not only countering the drop in attendance figures normally experienced in existing theatres facing competition from a new Stoll theatre, but actually increased revenues. Barrasford borrowed MacNaughten's Bradford theatre manager to replicate the system in Leeds, with the choice proving so successful and lucrative, that Barrasford moved his home and the operational headquarters of his business to Leeds.\n\nThe form of entertainment contract at the time was called a \"tour,\" whereby an impresario would book an act to tour all of his venues. Barrasford had noticed that Stoll would try to run his theatres cheaply, by booking foreign acts on a one-week trial contract to fill-in for his headline British acts: if they were a success then they got a tour, if not their contract would terminate at the end of the week. Barrasford hence started to attend Stoll's theatres in competition to his on a Monday, and if the act proved a success would then find them and sign them to a tour of his theatres. This skull dugery as far as Stoll was concerned was immoral, and after he banned Barrasford and his employees from the entire Stoll empire, so began a long term battle between the two impresarios.\n\nBarrasford in return set about competing against Stoll, by resolving to build his theatres bigger and better than the Moss and Stoll empires. In 1900 he acquired the Grand Theatre, Edinburgh (renamed from the Tivoli Theatre). In 1901 he acquired the Birmingham Hippodrome (renamed from the Tower theatre), and then the Alhambra theatre, Kingston upon Hull. In 1902 he acquired the Glasgow Hippodrome, but his most important theatre in his business opened that year, the Bank Holiday opening of the brand new 4,000 seat Bertie Crewe designed Liverpool Royal Hippodrome, with prices at rock bottom. Although the now combined Moss-Stoll consortia already had a theatre in the city, they specifically built the Liverpool Olympia close by. Opened with a production of \"Tally Ho!\" direct from the London Hippodrome, it never paid its way thanks to the pulling power of the scale, extravagance and \"twice-nightly\" format of the Barrasford Hall.\n\nBarrasford followed this success with the 1903 opening of the brand new Newcastle Pavilion in Westgate Road, with a bill topped by Tyneside contralto Madame Belle Cole. Barrasford in competition to Moss-Stoll added two further existing theatres to his tour in Liverpool: the Lyric Theatre in Everton Valley (opened Easter Monday, 1903); and the St Helens Hippodrome (previously the St Helens Empire), which opened with Fred Karno's comedy company in a production of \"Jail Birds.\" Barrasford also added the Grand Theatre, Manchester and the Regent Theatre in Salford, neither of which proved financially successful and where hence quickly disposed of.\n\nIn 1904, the second new Barrasford Hall opened in Glasgow, the Bertie Crewe designed Glasgow Pavilion on 29 February 1904. Barrasford also expanded south at this time, adding the Bristol Empire and the Brighton Hippodrome. He also took over the lease on the Britannia Theatre, Hoxton, letting Crewe refurbish it, but handed the lease over to Frank MacNaughten after nine months.\n\nThe St Helens Hippodrome was the fourteenth music hall added to the Tour in four years, with the empire spanning the following: Palace, Jarrow; Tivoli, Leeds; Tivoli, Edinburgh and Tivoli, Birmingham; Alhambra, Hull; Empire, Bristol; Lyric, Everton; Grand, Manchester, and Regent, Salford. The Britannia Theatre, Hoxton, together with the Hippodromes at Liverpool, Glasgow and Brighton and St. Helens.\n\nBarrasford now expanded the physical footprint of his theatres further afield. Registering Barrasford Circuit as a limited company at Leicester Place, off Leicester Square, London, Barrasford was listed as managing director, and Hugh Astley ex-manager of the London Pavilion as chairman. They then purchased the Newcastle Pavilion, and after the closure of the Hoxton venture, took on Stoll in a direct race to open in the Westend. Barrasford bought the old Lyceum Theatre, just off The Strand, which he commissioned Bertie Crewe to refurbish. Although Stoll's Empire won the opening race (Christmas Eve, 1904), the Lyceum opened on Boxing Day.\n\nBut much of Barrasford's financial success had been based on alcohol sales, and London County Council refused a license on principle for the Lyceum. Although the Lyceum attracted royal patronage before the Empire, with the first production of the ballet \"Excelsior\" seen by the Prince and Princess of Wales, afterwards King George V and Queen Mary.\n\nBy mid-1905, Barrasford Halls were facing a mini-financial crisis. Barrasford, in trying to out pace Stoll by trialling acts in Europe, had opened Alhambra-themed halls in Brussels and Paris. However, the former had quickly burnt down less than a year after opening, while both Paris and the Lyceum were losing money. With no possibility of a liquor license, Barrasford sold the Lyceum to the Melville family for £240,000.\n\nBarrasford moved the centre of his business operations to Brighton. Having turned the ice rink into the Brighton Hippodrome in 1902, he acquired an old music hall in New Road and refurbished it as the Brighton Coliseum. Barrasford himself lived in a converted warehouse next to the Hippodrome, called Hippodrome House.\n\nThere now followed a period of consolidation around the business. The Tivoli, Leeds, was refurbished and renamed the New Hippodrome, opening in 1906. The Hull Alhambra was refurbished as the New Hippodrome, but on completion of works the lease was handed to its manager Alfred Graham. The opening of the Coventry Hippodrome on 31 December 1906, also coincided with disposal of the loss-making theatres in Manchester.\n\nOn 23 December 1907, the Crewe designed Sheffield Hippodrome opened, followed the following year in the opening of the last Barrasford Hall, the Crewe designed Nottingham Hippodrome, opening on 28 September 1908.\n\nBarrasford was an enthusiastic race horse owner, and after becoming a prominent figure at the Jockey Club, inventing the starting device the \"Barrasford Gate.\" On an occasion of being assured that his horse would win at Pontefract Racecourse, he placed a five-shilling bet on behalf of every member of his staff at the Leed's Tivoli. After it won, the performances that night were cancelled at the Tivoli, as the entire staff spent the night celebrating.\n\nBarrasford was an early adopter of the new moving pictures invention, creating the Barrascope system for cinematograph projection. Holding a patent with Leeds photographer Owen Brooks, with assistance from an engineer named Borland, they first put the machine into the Leeds Tivoli from 1902. He later adapted a number of his theatres to use it, including the Brighton Coliseum in 1909.\n\nBy now, Barrasford was suffering from persistent ill health from Bright's Disease, and impresarios in USA and Britain expressed interest in taking over his entire tour. Sir Alfred Butt succeeded, in association with the Orpheum Circuit of America, and developed a new British circuit which rivalled the Moss-Stoll combine. Barrasford died at his home in Brighton on 1 February 1910. His second wife was former music hall singer Maud D'Almayne, with whom he had three sons, all of whom worked in the theatre business. His funeral was one of the largest ever held in Brighton.\n\n"}

The park opened in 1985 and operated until 2004.\n\nConstruction was underway as of October 1984, with plans to open the 27-acre park on May 1, 1985. The $12 million project was a joint venture between Howard Hughes Development Corporation – part of Summa Corporation – and San Diego-based Wet 'n' Wild. Howard Hughes Development Corporation conceived the project because of the potential to expand the local tourism market through family entertainment, and the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority believed that the water park would appeal to families visiting Las Vegas. Howard Hughes Development Corporation chose a water park theme as the company did not want to compete against southern California's Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm theme parks, as many Las Vegas tourists were residents of southern California. The concept of a water park in Las Vegas was also considered ideal because of the city's dry and hot weather.\n\nThe water park was located on the Las Vegas Strip, between the Sahara and El Rancho hotel-casinos. Wet 'n Wild opened on May 18, 1985, after $14 million was spent on construction. The park included three turbine engines capable of creating rolling four-foot waves in a 170-foot pool. The park also featured a 17,000-square-foot surf lagoon containing 500,000 gallons of water, ranging in depth from eight feet to two inches. The surf lagoon was a main attraction, as well as a 76-foot-high water slide known as the Der Stuka, located along Las Vegas Boulevard on the property's west end, south of the Sahara. Approximately 500,000 people were expected to visit the water park during its first year. By June 1986, park attendance had increased 19.7 percent from the previous year. A capsule known as the Bomb Bay was eventually added atop the Der Stuka. The Bomb Bay required people to push a button, which opened the floor beneath them, plummeting riders to the slide approximately 20 feet below.\n\nIn 1993, the park was sued by Russell Beatty, a man who suffered temporary paralysis after his neck was broken in three areas. Beatty had been waiting for his son at the bottom of the Hydro Blaster water slide and was struck by a 275-pound man. Beatty alleged that lifeguards allowed the man to go down the slide too soon, resulting in the injury.\n\nThe park was acquired by Universal Studios in October 1998, Ogden Corp in March 1999, Alfa SmartParks in March 2000, and Palace Entertainment on July 10, 2002. The park closed in 2004.\n\nIn March 2007, Publishing and Broadcasting Limited and Christopher Milam announced plans to purchase the site for $1.2 billion. They intended to replace it with a mixed-use tower called the Crown Las Vegas. The cost of the project was estimated to be $5 billion, and its original completion date was set for 2014. In March 2008, the project's cancellation was announced and the site was put up for sale.\n\nThe idea of turning the abandoned site into a stadium began in 2010, when Milam revealed plans for the Silver State Arena. Milam's company International Development Management would get the 27-acre land from Sue Lowden and her husband Paul, and atop build a 20,000-seat stadium at the cost of $750 million, using about $9 million a year in redevelopment district taxes. The project stalled after Clark County rejected a proposal to fund 15% of the venue with public money and nearby residents opposed construction.\n\nIn 2013, businessman Jackie Robinson, a former UNLV student and NBA player, announced that he was planning on using the same site of the proposed Silver State Arena to build the All Net Resort and Arena, a $1.4 billion privately funded complex encompassing an arena, hotel and shopping project that could attract an NBA franchise to Las Vegas. The arena itself would cost $670 million. The project is delayed until 2018 or 2019.\n\n"}
