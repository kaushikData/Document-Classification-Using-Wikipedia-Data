The eight teams, which are ranked or seeded in advance of the tournament, participate in a four-week tournament, with two teams eliminated in each of the first three weeks. The grand final is played in the fourth week between the two remaining teams, with the winning team awarded the premiership.\n\nThe system is designed to give the top four teams an easier road to the Grand Final than the second four teams. The top four teams need to win only two finals to reach the Grand Final, while the second four teams need to win three. The two winning teams of the top four receive a bye in the second week of the playoff and then play at home in the third week, and the two losing teams play at home in the second week.\n\nThe AFL introduced the system in 2000 to address several perceived issues with the McIntyre Final Eight System that had been in use in that competition from 1994–1999. The system has also been adopted by the Victorian Football League and the National Rugby League. Similar systems are used by Super League, and were previously used by the Australian Rugby League in the 1995 and 1996 seasons.\n\n\nThe eight finalists are split into two groups for the opening week of the Finals Series. The top four teams have the best chance of winning the premiership and play the two Qualifying Finals. The winners get a bye through to Week Three of the tournament to play home Preliminary Finals, while the losers play home Semi-Finals in Week Two. The bottom four teams play the two Elimination Finals, where the winners advance to Week Two away games and the losers' seasons are over.\n\n\n\n\nUnder this finals system, the final eight teams are broken up into two halves of four teams which are in turn split into two pairs each. The higher a team's position on the ladder, the greater benefits they receive. The top half of the ladder has two key advantages. These teams only need to win twice to reach the Grand Final (either a Qualifying or Semi-Final and a Preliminary Final), and they have the benefit of the double-chance; since the Qualifying Final is non-elimination, losers still have a second chance to reach the Grand Final by winning their two other Finals. Teams in the top six get the benefit of at least one home final; the top two teams play two home finals.\n\nA team's final rank in the home-and-away season also determines their pairings for the first week. In the Qualifying Finals, 1st place plays 4th place and 2nd place plays 3rd place; in the Elimination Finals, 5th place plays 8th place and 6th place plays 7th place. The better a team's rank, the more advantageous (or less disadvantageous) the matchup. After the first week, matchups are determined directly by the results of the previous week.\n\nThe top two seeds host their \"first two\" finals: the Qualifying Final and whatever final they play next (Preliminary Final if they win, Semi-Final if they lose). They also have the benefit of only needing to win twice to reach the Grand Final. If they win the Qualifying Final, they earn the bye to the Preliminary Final; otherwise they get the double-chance and can still reach the Preliminary Final by winning the Semifinal.\n\nThe next two seeds visit for the Qualifying Final but then host their next final. Like the top two, these teams only need to win twice to reach the Grand Final. Winning the Qualifying Final earns them the bye to the Preliminary Final; losing gives them the double-chance via the Semi-Final.\n\nFifth and sixth place host their Elimination Final and visit any other finals they reach. These teams must win \"all three\" of their finals (Elimination, Semi-, and Preliminary Finals) to avoid elimination.\n\nThe last two teams visit throughout the finals and also must win \"all three\" of their finals to avoid elimination.\n\n\n"}

It was released in North America on 15 July 2014 and Europe on 16 July 2014 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Microsoft Windows. An \"Extended Dream Edition\" for the PlayStation 4 was released on 28 July 2015.\n\nThe game's plot follows a set of heroes who fight to reach a warlock whose dreams are infecting reality in late 19th century Santiago, Chile. \"Abyss Odyssey\" combines elements from multiple video game genres and has a unique art style based on the Art Nouveau movement. It received mostly positive reviews from critics who praised its atmosphere but criticized some aspects of gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay has a fusion of elements from a number of gaming genres. The player controls an avatar who battles enemies and advances through dungeons to reach the conclusion of the stage. The game's levels are procedurally generated, providing a new experience on each. The player only has one life but may be revived. If the player character dies, the player is put in control of a much weaker human who tries to avenge their death and can revive the player at specific altars.\n\nThe game's fighting system combines elements of the \"Super Smash Bros.\" and \"Street Fighter\" franchises, and rewards players for timing their blocks and attacks at the right moment. Players can capture the souls of enemies they encounter—once collected, a player can then assume the form and abilities of the enemy in-game. \"Abyss Odyssey\" uses a community-based unlock system; upon its launch, only the first \"phase\" of the game was available. After a certain number of players defeat the game's final boss, the Warlock, the next phase of the game is unlocked for all players.\n\nACE Team revealed \"Abyss Odyssey\" on their official blog on 4 March 2014. The developers were inspired by the Art Nouveau movement and they used Harry Clarke as a direct reference for much of the game's art and atmosphere. The developers intended the game to be extremely replayable and designed the combat mechanics to be simple to understand, after initially considering a more complicated fighting layout.\n\nAn Enhanced Edition titled \"Abyss Odyssey: Extended Dream Edition\" introduced competitive multiplayer as well as new types of enemies and bosses to the game and was released for the PlayStation 4 on 28 July 2015. A \"nightmare\" difficulty mode is included in the Enhanced Edition.\n\nReviews for \"Abyss Odyssey\" were mixed; the game received a 69% from Metacritic. Critics praised the game's art style and atmosphere, but were disappointed by some of its game mechanics and its repetitive nature.\n\nEurogamer's Dan Whitehead praised the game's visuals and new ideas in a positive review, but felt that there was a \"... sense that in straddling so many genres, the game has spread itself a little thin\" IGN's Richard Cobbett compared the game's roguelike elements unfavorably to \"The Binding of Isaac\" and \"Spelunky\", but noted that \"the soundtrack is fantastic, and the art is even better.\" Hardcore Gamer's James Cunningham likened the art style to \"playing a Grateful Dead album cover\" and called it \"a quirky little gaming gem\"\n\nReception to the combat system was mixed. Destructoid's Alasdair Duncan felt that the combat system was \"enjoyable and deep\" and provided one of the main reasons to play the game, while \"PC Gamer\"'s Emanuel Maiberg derided what he felt to be the game's sluggish control input and compared the game negatively to the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series that its fighting system is based on.\n"}

They consisted of a printed cardboard background image and a transparent sheet of coloured dry transfer figures of people, animals, vehicles, weapons, explosions and so on. These transfers were supposed to be applied to the background scene by rubbing the top surface of the transparent sheet with a hard object or stylus; typically, this would mean a ball-point pen or a pencil; the figure would thereby be transferred from its sheet to the background. Since it was not customary to determine exactly where the transfers should be applied, surreal or comic effects could be achieved—whether deliberately or inadvertently—by juxtaposing the transfers and the background inappropriately. It was also possible to apply the transfer figures elsewhere than on the supplied background, and conversely it is quite common to come across finished transfer sets in which the descriptive lettering from the sheets has been applied to the background; an effect not intended by the manufacturer.\n\nA number of different sets were distributed by a wide variety of companies between the late 1960s and the 1980s; these included sets based on popular comics and cartoons (e.g., DC Comics, Marvel Comics, Hanna Barbera, and Disney cartoons), television series and movies (e.g., \"Star Wars\" and \"Battlestar Galactica\"), as well as original content sets. Since Letraset had a patent monopoly on the dry rub-down transfer process, until the end of the 1970s any transfers supplied with these sets would have been printed by Letraset, firstly at Waterloo Road in London, then later at Ashford in Kent, and finally at their factory in Italy.\n\nLetraset, the company that developed the Instant Lettering transfer sheets that dominated design and publishing before the advent of desktop publishing, created the first dry rub-down transfer sets for children and marketed them as \"Instant Pictures\" in 1964. They were originally silk screen printed and monochromatic, but by 1966 they were being produced using four spot colours.\n\nMost of the Instant Pictures after 1965 were produced for either John Waddington Ltd. or Patterson Blick.\n\nLetraset purchased a rotary gravure press which they installed at Ashford in Kent, and there they produced true full-colour transfers for the first time starting in 1967. These were not strictly CMYK colour transfers, because white ink is also required—since transfers are printed on transparent plastic, and not on white paper.\n\nIn 1969 the first Action Transfer sets were produced in this way, initially with a range of twelve sets—although the range rapidly expanded. Letraset stopped using the title \"Instant Pictures\" and from then on referred to their own transfers as \"Action Transfers\", even if they were not actually in the range of sets originally given that name.\n\nIn 1976, the production of Action Transfers was transferred to Letraset's Italian factory, Sodecor, where offset litho printing was used with transfers for the first time. The impetus for the move was a joint venture undertaken with Gillette to produce Action Transfers under the name Kalkitos. These were widely distributed around the world, with the brand name occasionally differing; in the US, they were known as Presto Magix.\n\nAfter the acquisition of Letraset by Esselte in 1981, the production of transfers was continued by a British company named Acorn Printed Products, that was formed by several ex-Letraset staff members. Acorn still produce transfers to this day.\n"}

After Waucquez's death in 1920, the building began to languish away, and in 1970, the firm closed its doors. Jean Delhaye, a former aid of Horta, saved the building from demolition, and by 16 October 1975, it was designated as a protected monument. Still, the building was in bad shape and victim to a lot of vandalism.\n\nIn 1980, architect Jean Breydel and comics artists François Schuiten, Bob de Moor, Alain Baran, Guy Dessicy and Hergé planned to restore the building and give it a new destination as a museum dedicated to the history of Belgian comics. Originally, the museum would be a homage to Hergé, but he suggested honoring the entire Belgian comics industry. In 1983, Belgian Minister of Public Works Louis Olivier decided that the building would be bought by the Direction of Buildings, making it national property. In 1984, a fund was founded which brought together several Flemish and Walloon comics artists. Two years later, the restorations began, with respect for the original architecture, while updating it to modern standards. The mosaics were flown over from Italy and constructed by Italian mosaic workers, because the profession had become obsolete in Belgium.\n\nOn 6 October 1989, the museum was inaugurated in the presence of King Baudouin of Belgium and Queen Fabiola of Belgium.\n\nIn the Autumn of 2015, the museum started redecorating its permanent exhibition.\n\nOn the ground floor of the museum, a restaurant can be found, a room dedicated to Victor Horta, a comics' store named \"Slumberland\" after \"Little Nemo in Slumberland\", a library with a reading room and a study centre.

{"id": "408596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=408596", "title": "Chanson", "text": "Chanson\n\nA chanson (, \"song\", from Latin \"cantio\", gen. \"cantionis\") is in general any lyric-driven French song, usually polyphonic and secular. A singer specializing in chansons is known as a \"chanteur\" (male) or \"chanteuse\" (female); a collection of chansons, especially from the late Middle Ages and Renaissance, is also known as a chansonnier.\n\nThe earliest \"chansons\" were the epic poems performed to simple monophonic melodies by a professional class of \"jongleurs\" or \"ménestrels\". These usually recounted the famous deeds (\"geste\") of past heroes, legendary and semi-historical. The \"Song of Roland\" is the most famous of these, but in general the \"chansons de geste\" are studied as literature since very little of their music survives.\n\nThe \"chanson courtoise\" or \"grand chant\" was an early form of monophonic \"chanson\", the chief lyric poetic genre of the trouvères. It was an adaptation to Old French of the Occitan \"canso\". It was practised in the 12th and 13th centuries. Thematically, as its name implies, it was a song of courtly love, written usually by a man to his noble lover. Some later \"chansons\" were polyphonic and some had refrains and were called \"chansons avec des refrains\". A Crusade song was known as a \"chanson de croisade\".\n\nIn its typical specialized usage, the word \"chanson\" refers to a polyphonic French song of the late Middle Ages and Renaissance. Early \"chansons\" tended to be in one of the \"formes fixes\"—ballade, rondeau or virelai (formerly the \"chanson baladée\")—though some composers later set popular poetry in a variety of forms. The earliest chansons were for two, three or four voices, with first three becoming the norm, expanding to four voices by the 16th century. Sometimes, the singers were accompanied by instruments.\n\nThe first important composer of \"chansons\" was Guillaume de Machaut, who composed three-voice works in the \"formes fixes\" during the 14th century. Guillaume Dufay and Gilles Binchois, who wrote so-called Burgundian \"chansons\" (because they were from the area known as Burgundy), were the most important chanson composers of the next generation (c. 1420–1470). Their chansons, while somewhat simple in style, are also generally in three voices with a structural tenor. Musicologist David Fallows includes the Burgundian repertoire in \"A Catalogue of Polyphonic Songs 1415–1480.\" These works are typically still 3 voices, with an active upper voice (discantus) pitched above two lower voices (tenor and altus) usually sharing the same range.\n\nLater 15th- and early 16th-century figures in the genre included Johannes Ockeghem and Josquin des Prez, whose works cease to be constrained by \"formes fixes\" and begin to feature a pervading imitation (all voices sharing material and moving at similar speeds), similar to that found in contemporary motets and liturgical music. The first book of music printed from movable type was \"Harmonice Musices Odhecaton\", a collection of ninety-six chansons by many composers, published in Venice in 1501 by Ottaviano Petrucci.\n\nBeginning in the late 1520s through mid-century, Claudin de Sermisy, Pierre Certon, Clément Janequin, and Philippe Verdelot were composers of so-called Parisian \"chansons\", which also abandoned the \"formes fixes\", often featured four voices, and were in a simpler, more homophonic style. This genre sometimes featured music that was meant to be evocative of certain imagery such as birds or the marketplace. Many of these Parisian works were published by Pierre Attaingnant. Composers of their generation, as well as later composers, such as Orlando de Lassus, were influenced by the Italian madrigal. Many early instrumental works were ornamented variations (diminutions) on chansons, with this genre becoming the canzone, a progenitor of the sonata.\n\nFrench solo song developed in the late 16th century, probably from the aforementioned Parisian works. During the 17th century, the \"air de cour\", \"chanson pour boire\" and other like genres, generally accompanied by lute or keyboard, flourished, with contributions by such composers as Antoine Boesset, Denis Gaultier, Michel Lambert and Michel-Richard de Lalande.\n\nDuring the 18th century, vocal music in France was dominated by opera, but solo song underwent a renaissance in the 19th century, first with salon melodies and then by mid-century with highly sophisticated works influenced by the German Lieder, which had been introduced into the country. Louis Niedermeyer, under the particular spell of Schubert, was a pivotal figure in this movement, followed by Édouard Lalo, Felicien David and many others.\n\nAnother offshoot of \"chanson\", called \"chanson réaliste\" (realist song), was a popular musical genre in France, primarily from the 1880s until the end of World War II. Born of the \"cafés-concerts\" and cabarets of the Montmartre district of Paris and influenced by literary realism and the naturalist movements in literature and theatre, \"chanson réaliste\" was a musical style which was mainly performed by women and dealt with the lives of Paris's poor and working class. Among the better-known performers of the genre are Damia, Fréhel, and Édith Piaf.\n\nLater 19th-century composers of French art songs, known as mélodie and not chanson, included Ernest Chausson, Emmanuel Chabrier, Gabriel Fauré, and Claude Debussy, while many 20th-century and current French composers have continued this strong tradition.\n\nIn France today \"chanson\" or \"chanson française\" typically refers to the music of singers such as Charles Trenet, Guy Béart, Jacques Brel, Jean Ferrat, Georges Brassens, Édith Piaf, Charles Aznavour, Barbara, Dalida, Serge Reggiani, William Sheller, Renaud, Léo Ferré, Mireille Mathieu and Serge Gainsbourg and more recently Juliette, Mano Solo, Dominique A, Matthieu Chedid, Benjamin Biolay, Jean-Louis Murat, Miossec, Mathieu Boogaerts, Daniel Darc, Vincent Delerm, Maurane, Zaz, Bénabar, Renan Luce, Olivia Ruiz. Chanson can be distinguished from the rest of French \"pop\" music by following the rhythms of French language, rather than those of English, and a higher standard for lyrics.\n\nIn La Planche, Loire-Atlantique, the Musée de la chanson française has been established in 1992. The museum has the goal to remember the artists that have established the heritage of the chanson.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "612904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=612904", "title": "City comedy", "text": "City comedy\n\nCity comedy, also known as citizen comedy, is a genre of comedy in the English early modern theatre.\n\nEmerging from Ben Jonson's late-Elizabethan comedies of humours (1598–1599), the conventions of city comedy developed rapidly in the first decade of the Jacobean era, as one playwright's innovations were soon adopted by others, such that by about 1605 the new genre was fully established. Its principal playwrights were Jonson himself, Thomas Middleton, and John Marston, though many others also contributed to its development, including Thomas Heywood, Thomas Dekker, John Day, and John Webster. Once the companies of boy players—the Children of Paul's and the Children of the Chapel—had resumed public performances from 1600 onwards, most of their plays were city comedies. The closest that William Shakespeare's plays come to the genre is the slightly earlier \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" (c. 1597), which is his only play set entirely in England; it avoids the caustic satire of city comedy, however, in preference for a more bourgeois mode (with its duel romantic plots governed by socio-economics not love or sex), while its setting, Windsor, is a town rather than a city.\n\nIn contrast to the adventurous chronicles of Elizabethan comedy, such as Thomas Dekker's \"The Shoemaker's Holiday\" (1599) or George Peele's \"The Old Wives' Tale\" (c. 1590), or the intricately plotted romantic comedies of Shakespeare and John Lyly, city comedy was more realistic (excluding magical or marvellous elements) and sharp and satirical in tone. It portrayed a broad range of characters from different ranks (often focused on citizens), employing \"deeds and language such as men do use\", as Jonson put it, and was usually set in London.\n\nDuring the Tudor period the Reformation had produced a gradual shift to Protestantism and much of London passed from church to private ownership. The Royal Exchange was founded in this period. Mercantilism grew, and monopoly trading companies such as the East India Company were established, with trade expanding to the New World. London became the principal North Sea port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605. City comedies depict London as a hotbed of vice and folly; in particular, Jonson's \"Epicoene\", Middleton's \"A Trick to Catch the Old One\" and \"A Chaste Maid in Cheapside\", and Marston's \"The Dutch Courtesan.\"\n\nVerna Foster has argued that John Ford's \"'Tis Pity She's a Whore\" (c. 1629–1633) re-works many of the features of city comedy within a tragic drama.\n\n"}

Those who have purchased it prior to the page's removal still have the game and could play it until the servers were shut down permanently on March 1, 2016. The game is currently unplayable due to its DRM scheme requiring a connection.\nThe Crogenitors were a race of scientists that established a massive empire encompassing an entire galaxy.\nMany of them performed secret experiments on the populations they oversaw. Being masters of genetic manipulation, they used their knowledge to create a personal army of genetic heroes, called \"Living Weapons\". However, the discovery of an experimental amino acid that bonds to DNA changes everything. Capable of achieving a millennium in terms of evolution in a matter of hours, it has an immense potential to manipulate life to levels never achieved before.\n\nUnfortunately, \"E-DNA\" proves to be unstable. All of the test subjects who came in contact with it were transformed into uncontrollable genetic mutants soon named \"The Darkspore\". Fearing these new creatures, the Crogenitors throw hero \"Xylan\" into exile for his behavior and negligence, outlawing the use of E-DNA. Xylan fakes his death. Believing himself able to control the power of E-DNA, he injects it himself. This act transforms him into the \"Corruptor\" — a mentally unstable, extraordinarily powerful mutant who can master all Darkspores. Determined to get revenge on the other Crogenitors and conquer everything, he gathers allies and strengthens the E-DNA mutagenic power. Afterwards, the Corruptor begins conquering planets of the Crogenitor empire, infecting them through the use of E-DNA bombs, and destroying Crogenitor fortresses with his mutants and war machines.\n\nAs the game begins, the player takes on the role of one of the last Crogenitors. Starting with only a few heroes, the player's goal is to purge the Darkspore from the galaxy, planet by planet, moving ever closer to the ultimate goal of destroying the Corruptor forces.\n\nThe Hero editor in \"Darkspore\" has been described as an enhanced version of the one found in Spore. There are thousands of parts to collect which enhance the overall gaming experience.The different types of parts include enabling the customization of several character aspects, including body parts, armor, weapons, facial features and coloration. The hero remains recognizable but customisable. To buy and equip the loot or buy upgrades, DNA is necessary, used as a currency. DNA helixes can be collected during gameplay, dropped sometimes by slayed Darkspores or destructible objects, or obtained by selling pieces of loot.\n\n\"HelpEDNA\" was a Darkspore alternate reality game that went online in mid-2010. It plays out as a puzzle text adventure which gives clues about the Darkspore game, and is set before the events of the game.\n\nHelpEDNA is a puzzle text adventure, in which you play as a contact that has begun receiving messages from an unknown character. After the game is completed, it contains an epilogue page containing a message from Maxis, with links to all the pictures and videos from the website.\n\nIn addition to a product key registration, Darkspore required a persistent, broadband internet connection and an EA account in order to play the game after installation.\n\nIn June 2013 many users had problems logging in to play. This combined with Darkspore being removed from Steam led to concerns that EA had abandoned the title and it would no longer be playable. However, shortly after, the errors were fixed and Darkspore returned to Steam.\nHowever, the game has since been removed from all stores, making storehouse sales such as eBay and Amazon the only options for people looking to buy the game. The game's online features continued to be supported for some time for people who already own it. \nThe online servers of the game were shutdown permanently on March 1, 2016. The game is no longer playable. The move attracted criticism, with Techraptor stating that the failure to migrate away from the always-online requirement before the server shutdown was tantamount to \"banishing the title from gaming history.\"\n\nDarkspore has received mixed reviews, with an average of 65% on Metacritic.\n\n"}

It began in the mid-1990s with the introduction of the Astro satellite television service, now followed by new paid television services in the 2000s, as well as the digitalisation of over-the-air TV which was expected to be complete by the mid-2010s before being shelved. This article discusses various platforms where DTV is applied in Malaysia, including Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) (DVB-S for satellite and DVB-T for over-the-air) and Internet Protocol Television (IPTV).\n\nThe DTV era in Malaysia began with the introduction of direct broadcast pay television service, Astro, in 1996 as part of commercialisation of space. Astro now transmits about 130 local and international TV channels in the MPEG-2 video format through the K band utilising the MEASAT satellite system's transponders, according to the DVB-S standard. Astro's transmission is especially susceptible to rain fade, and complaints of interruption during wet weather are not uncommon in Malaysia with a tropical climate. On December 2011, the former prime minister Najib Tun Razak announced that free satellite television, NJOI will be available to customer starting February 2012.\n\nIn 2005, the Ministry of Information announced their plan to digitalise nationwide free-to-air TV broadcasts led by Radio Televisyen Malaysia (RTM). Trial broadcasts were undertaken, involving one thousand households in the Klang Valley from September 2006 till February 2007. According to the then-Deputy Minister of Information, Chia Kwang Chye, the trial received \"very positive\" feedback, i.e. \"more than 60 percent said the quality of the signal ranged from good to better. Over 88 percent said the picture quality improved, while 70 percent said the sound quality was better.\"\n\nAccording to Information Minister Datuk Ahmad Shabery Cheek, it was anticipated that RTM would fully complete its digitalisation in 2012 as part of its three-year restructuring process. It was anticipated that each household, once equipped with the necessary equipment (set-top box, iDTV or DHD set) would receive up to 19 channels, seven of which would fall under RTM and the rest for private broadcasters such as TV3, ntv7, 8TV and TV9. Thus far, besides simulcasting TV1 and TV2, RTM is currently airing RTMi, Muzik Aktif and Arena exclusively on the digital TV platform, transmitted at UHF channel 44, modulated at 64QAM, in test forms. RTM was also expected to launch regional channels for each state and/or territory in Malaysia; increasing to 20 television channels. Media Prima has started trials on March 2009.\n\nMalaysia and all other ASEAN nations (with the exception of The Philippines, who selected ISDB instead) had selected DVB-T as the final DTV standard, and were expected to switch off analogue broadcasts completely by 2015. On June 2008, participants of the 6th ASEAN Digital Broadcast Meeting from seven south-east Asian countries (including Malaysia) agreed to finalise the specifications of the DTV set-top box for use within ASEAN, and also set up an ASEAN HD Centre to provide training on HDTV content to broadcasters in the region.\n\nDespite a success of RTM's pilot trials, the digital terrestrial television transition faced many problems. These problems stemmed from the lesser enthusiasm of content providers toward the digitisation, with the exception of Les Copaque, and the need to improve the nation's Internet broadband infrastructure. However, after Abdullah Badawi resigned as Prime Minister and succeeded by Najib Tun Razak in 2008, the project by RTM was deferred indefinitely.\n\nAlthough Telekom Malaysia has been rumoured to be builder for a digital terrestrial television infrastructure, TM wishes to improve the broadband infrastructure to increase Internet readiness for the country, which leads to UniFi.\n\nOn 8 January 2014, Puncak Semangat was awarded the concession for digital terrestrial television development. The company is obligated to develop the digital terrestrial television infrastructure, which include a digital multimedia hub and a network of high, medium and low-powered digital TV transmitters nationwide that are capable of carrying up to 45 standard-definition or 15 high-definition digital TV channels, for a start. Television and radio services will be offered first while the latter three, connected services (catch-up TV and video on demand), t-commerce (television commerce) and soft services (e-learning applications and SMS voting) will delivered via home broadband networks after the former two.\n\nThe first roll-out will start on 16 April 2015 (originally expected to be in the third quarter of 2014), using Puncak Semangat's inside-out rollout strategy where the rural areas will have analogue switch-off first followed by suburbans and eventually urban areas in stages, due to the fact that free-to-air television will benefit rural people while people in urban and suburban areas already have pay television such as Astro and HyppTV. The rollout will complete in 2017 and will cover 98% of Malaysia's population with the capacity of up to 80 television channels and between 30 and 40 radio stations.\n\nOnce the full digital platform has been rolled out, television broadcasts in analogue will be terminated.\n\nAnalogue TV broadcasts would have been shut down in stages, due to complete by 2014 as per recommendation from ASEAN. The DTT migration plan was divided into three phases:\n\n\nTelevision broadcasts in analogue are originally scheduled for 2017, but the transition will be completed after the full-out of the digital platform.\n\nIn 2006, U Television, formerly MiTV, is scheduled to roll out broadcast services in the H.264 video format according to DVB-T, for better picture quality and more efficient frequency bandwidth usage, after having failed in an earlier venture with the IPTV-over-UHF system previously.\n\nDETV, a new paid television provider owned by REDtone, provides television and video-on-demand services on the IPTV platform, targeting the Chinese audiences in Malaysia.\n\nTM launched its IPTV services, branded as Hypp.TV in the fourth quarter of 2009, and has completed its trials with 1,000 selected households in Klang Valley, Penang and Kulim, Kedah. The service began in March 2010. However, due to the service being tied down to their UniFi fiber-to-the-home service, availability remains limited to areas covered by the national fiber rollout.\n\nMobile television was introduced in Malaysia with video streaming services by mobile telecommunications providers such as Maxis and DiGi, to users of mobile phones with 3G or similar technologies. Maxis TV now offers more than 20 channels to Maxis 3G subscribers who own compatible mobile phones. Yet, Maxis is expected to roll out broadcast mobile TV services based on DVB-H in the near future.\n\nU Mobile also provides broadcast mobile TV to users of selected 3G phones, also based on DVB-H.\n\nIn October 2008, Astro launched Astro Mobile TV which currently provides 18 channels, all of which are mobile versions of existing Astro TV channels, including seven in-house channels. This service is only available to Maxis subscribers with compatible 2.5G or 3G handsets, and does not reprise its role from Maxis TV cable television.\n\nIn 2012, HyppTV launched the HyppTV Everywhere service to counter the lack of fiber coverage. Initially only available to UniFi subscribers, the service was opened up to the public to compensate for the limited UniFi coverage.\n\nRTM initiated its inaugural high-definition television (HDTV) trials in 2008, with the Beijing Olympic Games, of which RTM test-broadcast the opening and closing ceremony, and several events on HD.\n\nIn late 2009, Astro launched Astro B.yond as a personal video recorder and a high-definition television service.\n\nAs of July 2013, Media Prima group chief financial officer Mohamad Ariff Ibrahim told that Media Prima will launch high definition (HD) simulcast for one of its four terrestrial television stations as early as the first half of year 2014. But, audiences are still suffered with SD resolution and stretched 4:3 scale format in most 16:9 TV that majority people own nowadays. Media Prima only start to broadcast selected programmes at 16:9 SD starting from 31 December 2016, however the idents, programme previews, adverts, 4:3 contents and some widescreen programmes remain on 4:3 and improperly stretched.\n\nIn early 2015, NJOI began the HD service that will automatically available for free for all NJOI customers starting from 1 February.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a departure from the concept of mimesis which only is concerned with \"imitation of nature\" instead of the \"imitation of other authors.\"\n\nThree centuries after Aristotle's \"Poetics\", from the 4th century BCE to the 1st century BCE, the meaning of \"mimesis\" as a literary method had shifted from \"imitation of nature\" to \"imitation of other authors\". No historical record is left to explain the reason of this change. Dionysius' three volume work \"On mimesis\" (\"On imitation\"), which was the most influential for Latin authors, is lost. Most of it contained advice on how to identify the most suitable writers to imitate and the best way to imitate them. For Dionysian \"imitatio\", the object of imitation was not a single author but the qualities of many.\n\nLatin orators and rhetoricians adopted the literary method of Dionysius' \"imitatio\" and discarded Aristotle's \"mimesis\"; the imitation literary approach is closely linked with the widespread observation that \"everything has been said already\", which was also stated by Egyptian scribes around 2000 BCE. The ideal aim of this approach to literature was not originality, but to surpass the predecessor by improving their writings and set the bar to a higher level. A prominent Latin follower of Dionysius was Quintilian, who shared with him the view of \"imitatio\" as the practice that leads to an historical progress of literature over time. Both Dionysius and Quintilian discuss \"imitation\" exclusively from the point of view of rhetoric. In Quintilian, and in classical rhetoric in general, rhetoric drew much attention to the process of imitatio; the four operations of quadripartita ratio that organize all the figures of speech, defined as a \"ready-made framework\" of \"relatively mechanical procedures\" for the emulation, adaptation, reworking and enrichment of a source text by an earlier author. This view of rhetoric was taken by Erasmus in \"De Copia Rerum\".\n\nDionysius' concept marked a significant depart from the concept of \"mimesis\" formulated by Aristotle in the 4th century BCE, which was only concerned with \"imitation of nature\" instead of the \"imitation of other authors.\" Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted the literary method of Dionysius' \"imitatio\" and discarded Aristotle's \"mimesis\". In Aristotle's \"Poetics\", lyric poetry, epic poetry, drama, dancing, painting are all described as forms of mimesis.\n\n"}

This podcast is notable because it is the most popular Doctor Who Podcast worldwide as shown within the independent iTunes. The podcast is produced by \"Doctor Who Online\" which is a \"Doctor Who\" fan website based in the United Kingdom by Sebastian J. Brook and Paul A.T. Wilson.\n\n\"The Whocast\" was started in April 2006, during the original run of Series 2 of \"Doctor Who\", by Paul A.T. Wilson in conjunction with a \"Doctor Who\" meeting group based in London. Although the early episodes could be considered somewhat derivative of both Podcast Who and Podshock it soon established its own style, with very much a British slant. Also due to its location, the Podcast was able to start featuring interviews with actors and production staff from both the current and classic series.\n\nIn September 2006, \"The Whocast\" teamed up with \"Doctor Who Online\", with a significant format change and the addition of a co-host, Sebastian J. Brook. With the format change, the podcast attracted more listeners and experienced a dramatic growth in listenership.\n\nIn May 2007, \"The DWO Whocast: DWO TorchCast\" was rated 4/5 by \"SciFiNow Magazine\". In December 2007, \"The DWO Whocast\" was rated 5/5 by \"SciFiNow Magazine\" and podcast was featured and referred to as \"Must hear now\". In January 2008, \"The DWO Whocast: Sarah Jane Adventures Mini-Cast\" was rated 4/5 by \"SciFiNow Magazine\", the podcast was featured and referred to as \"Must hear now\".\n\nIn Episode #66, which was released on 21 April 2008, Paul and Seb hosted their last DWO WhoCast, stating that time was one of the reasons behind the recent drought in WhoCast episodes.

{"id": "14573357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14573357", "title": "Efference copy", "text": "Efference copy\n\nAn efference copy or efferent copy is an internal copy of an outflowing (\"efferent\"), movement-producing signal generated by the motor system. It can be collated with the (reafferent) sensory input that results from the agent's movement, enabling a comparison of actual movement with desired movement, and a shielding of perception from particular self-induced effects on the sensory input to achieve perceptual stability. Together with internal models, efference copies can serve to enable the brain to predict the effects of an action.\n\nAn equal term with a different history is \"corollary discharge\".\n\nEfference copies are important in enabling motor adaptation such as to enhance gaze stability. They have a role in the perception of self and nonself electric fields in electric fish. They also underlie the phenomenon of tickling.\n\nA motor signal from the central nervous system (CNS) to the periphery is called an \"efference\", and a copy of this signal is called an efference copy. Sensory information coming from sensory receptors in the peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system is called \"afference\". On a similar basis, nerves into the nervous system are afferent nerves and ones out are termed efferent nerves.\n\nWhen an efferent signal is produced and sent to the motor system, it has been suggested that a copy of the signal, known as an efference copy, is created so that exafference (sensory signals generated from external stimuli in the environment) can be distinguished from reafference (sensory signals resulting from an animal's own actions).\n\nThis efference copy, by providing the input to a forward internal model, is then used to generate the predicted sensory feedback that estimates the sensory consequences of a motor command. The actual sensory consequences of the motor command are then deployed to compare with the corollary discharge to inform the CNS about how well the expected action matched its actual external action.\n\nCorollary discharge is characterized as an efference copy of an action command used to inhibit any response to the self generated sensory signal which would interfere with the execution of the motor task. The inhibitory commands originate at the same time as the motor command and target the sensory pathway that would report any reafference to higher levels of the CNS. This is unique from the efference copy, since the corollary discharge is actually fed into the sensory pathway to cancel out the reafferent signals generated by the movement. Alternatively, corollary discharges briefly alters self-generated sensory responses to reduce self-induced desensitization or help distinguish between self-generated and externally generated sensory information.\n\n\"In 1811 Johann Georg Steinbuch (1770–1818) referred repeatedly to the problem of efference copy and reafference in his book \"Beytrag zur Physiologie der Sinne\" (\"Contribution to the Physiology of Senses\"). After studying medicine, Steinbuch worked for a number of years as lecturer at the University of Erlangen and thereafter as physician in Heidenheim, Ulm, and Herrenberg (Württemberg, South Germany). As a young university teacher, he was particularly interested in the brain mechanisms which enable the perception of space and objects, but in later years his attention shifted to the more practical problems of clinical medicine. Together with Justinus Kerner he gave a very precise description in 1817 of the clinical symptoms of botulism. In his book \"Beytrag zur Physiologie der Sinne”, Steinbuch presented a very careful analysis of the tactile recognition of objects by the grasping hand. Hereby, he developed the hypothesis that the cerebral mechanisms controlling the movement of the hands interact within the brain with the afferent signal flow evoked in the mechanoreceptors while the grasping hand is moving across the surface of the object. The cerebral signals controlling the movement were called \"Bewegidee\" (motion idea). According to Steinbuch’s model, only by the interaction of the \"Bewegidee\" with the afferent signal flow did object recognition become possible. He illustrated his statements by a simple experiment: if an object passively activates the mechanoreceptors of the palm and fingers of a resting hand for sufficient sequences and time, object recognition is not achieved. When the hand, however, grasps actively, object recognition occurs within a few seconds.\"\n\nThe first person to propose the existence of efferent copies was the German physician and physicist Hermann von Helmholtz in the middle of the 19th century. He argued that the brain needed to create an efference copy for the motor commands that controlled eye muscles so as to aid the brain's determining the location of an object relative to the head. His argument used the experiment in which one gently presses on one's own eye. If this is done, one notices that the visual world seems to have \"moved\" as a result of this passive movement of the eyeball. In contrast, if the eyeball is actively moved by the eye muscles the world is perceived as still. The reasoning made is that with a passive movement of the eyeball, no efferent copies are made as with active movements that allow sensory changes to be anticipated and controlled for with the result in their absence the world appears to move.\n\nIn 1900, Charles Sherrington, the founder of modern ideas about motor control, rejected von Helmholtz ideas and argued that efference copies were not needed as muscles had their own sense of the movements they made. \n\"The view [of von Helmholtz and his followers] which dispenses with peripheral organs and afferent nerves for the muscular sense has had powerful adherents . . . It supposes that during ... a willed movement the outgoing current of impulses from brain to muscle is accompanied by a 'sensation for innervation'. ... it \"remains unproven\". This resulted in the idea of efference copies being dropped for the next 75 years.\n\nIn 1950, Erich von Holst and Horst Mittelstaedt investigated how species are able to distinguish between exafference and reafference given a seemingly identical percept of the two. To explore this question, they rotated the head of a fly 180 degrees, effectively reversing the right and left edges of the retina and reversing the subject's subsequent reafferent signals. In this state, self-initiated movements of the fly would result in a perception that the world was also moving, rather than standing still as they would in a normal fly. After rotation of the eyes, the animal showed a reinforcement of the optokinetic response in the same direction as the moving visual input. Von Holst and Mittelstaedt interpreted their findings as evidence that corollary discharge (i.e. neural inhibition with active movement) could not have accounted for this observed change as this would have been expected to inhibit the optokinetic reaction. They concluded that an \"Efferenzkopie\" of the motor command was responsible for this reaction due to the persistence of the reafferent signal and given the consequent discrepancy between expected and actual sensory signals which reinforced the response rather than preventing it.\n\nThe Nobel Prize winner, Roger Wolcott Sperry argued for the basis of corollary discharges following his research upon the optokinetic reflex. He is also regarded as the originator of the term \"corollary discharge\".\n\nEfference copy relates to Coriolis effect in a manner that allows for learning and correction of errors experienced from self-generated Coriolis forces. During trunk rotational movements there is a learned CNS anticipation of Coriolis effects, mediated by generation of an appropriate efference copy that can be compared to re-afferent information.\n\nIt has been proposed that efference copy has an important role in maintaining gaze stability with active head movement by augmenting the vestibulo-ocular reflex (aVOR) during dynamic visual acuity testing.\n\nEfference copy within an internal model allows us to grip objects in parallel to a given load. In other words, the subject is able to properly grip any load that they are provided because the internal model provides such a good prediction of the object without any delay. Flanagan and Wing tested to see whether an internal model is used to predict movement-dependent loads by observing grip force changes with known loads during arm movements. They found that even when giving subjects different known loads the grip force was able to predict the load force. Even when the load force was suddenly changed the grip force never lagged in the phase relationship with the load force, therefore affirming the fact that there was an internal model in the CNS that was allowing for the proper prediction to occur. It has been suggested by Kawato that for gripping, the CNS uses a combination of the inverse and forward model. With the use of the efference copy the internal model can predict a future hand trajectory, thus allowing for the parallel grip to the particular load of the known object.\n\nExperiments have been conducted wherein subjects' feet are tickled both by themselves and with a robotic arm controlled by their own arm movements. These experiments have shown that people find a self-produced tickling motion of the foot to be much less \"“tickly”\" than a tickling motion produced by an outside source. They have postulated that this is because when a person sends a motor command to produce the tickling motion, the efference copy anticipates and cancels out the sensory outcome. This idea is further supported by evidence that a delay between the self-produced tickling motor command and the actual execution of this movement (mediated by a robotic arm) causes an increase in the perceived tickliness of the sensation. This shows that when the efference copy is incompatible with the afference, the sensory information is perceived as if it were exafference. Therefore, it is theorized that it is not possible to tickle ourselves because when the predicted sensory feedback (efference copy) matches the actual sensory feedback, the actual feedback will be attenuated. If the predicted sensory feedback does not match the actual sensory feedback, whether caused by a delay (as in the mediation by the robotic arm) or by external influences from the environment, the brain cannot predict the tickling motion on the body and a more intense tickling sensation is perceived. This is the reason why one cannot tickle oneself.\n\nIt has been argued that motor efference copies play an important role in speech production. Tian and Poeppel propose that a motor efference copy is used to produce a forward model of somatosensory estimation, which entails an estimation of the articulatory movement and position of the articulators as a result of planned motor action. A second (subsequent) auditory efference copy entails the estimation of auditory information as produced by the articulatory system in a second forward model. Both of these forward models can produce respective predictions and corollary discharge, which can in turn be used in comparisons with somatosensory and auditory feedback. Moreover, this system is thought by some to be the basis for inner speech, especially in relation to auditory verbal hallucinations. In the case of inner speech, the efference signal is not sent or is inhibited before action takes place, leaving only the efference copy and leading to the perception of inner speech or inner hearing. In the case of auditory verbal hallucinations, it is thought that a breakdown along the efference copy and forward model route creates a mismatch between what is expected and what is observed, leading to the experience that speech is not produced by oneself.\n\nThe mormyrid electric fish provides an example of corollary discharge in lower vertebrates. Specifically, the knollenorgan sensor (KS) is involved with electro-communication, detecting the electric organ discharges (EOD) of other fish. Unless the reafference was somehow modulated, the KS would also detect self generated EODs that would interfere with interpretation of external EODs needed for communication between fish. However, these fish display corollary discharges that inhibit the ascending sensory pathway at the first CNS relay point. These corollary discharges are timed to arrive at the same time as the reafference from the KS to minimize the interference of self-produced EODs with the perception of external EODs, and optimize the duration of inhibition. \n\n"}

Parkinson (October 22, 1958 – October 26, 2005) was an American fantasy artist and illustrator known for book covers and artwork for games such as \"EverQuest\", \"Guardians\", \"\", and \"\". After designing book and magazine covers for TSR, Parkinson moved into game design in the 1990s, and co-designed the collectible card game \"Guardians\". Parkinson died of leukemia in 2005, just four days after his 47th birthday.\n\nKeith Parkinson was born in West Covina, California. Because of his father's career at GMAC, Parkinson spent his childhood in various cities in the United States including San Diego, CA, New York, NY, Miami, Florida, and Lansing, Michigan. From an early age, Parkinson took an interest in science fiction, particularly in spaceships, and used his artistic abilities to explore his interest. However, by the age of twelve, he became more interested in music than art; in an interview he stated, \"I got involved with a rock & roll band in high school, and played semi-professionally all the way through high school and into college. For several years, my band toured on weekends. We were into heavy metal and played stuff by Blue Öyster Cult, Rush, Led Zeppelin, and other heavy metal monster groups.\" At one gig, Parkinson met his future wife, Mary, who later became the \"Dragon\" Magazine Advertising Coordinator.\n\nParkinson graduated from Kendall College of Art and Design in 1980. His first job was with a company called Advertising Posters, where he worked on the artwork for pinball games and early arcade games, including \"Tron\" and \"Krull\". Parkinson was heavily influenced by Frank Frazetta and Roger Dean in his own fantasy work. At Advertising Posters, Parkinson was introduced to \"Dungeons & Dragons\" by a coworker. Parkinson recalls, \"The first night I played a ranger in B1, \"Keep on the Borderlands\", and I was hooked. We played every week.\"\n\nIn November 1982, he went to work at TSR, Inc.: \"I didn’t like a lot of the art I saw on \"D&D\" game products, and the company was in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, just over the border, so I drove up one day to see if I could do some freelance work. Elmore, Jeff Easley, and Tim Truman had all just joined the company, and the art they were working on was fantastic. It really blew my mind. Jim Roslof, who was the Art Director, hinted that I could join the staff full-time, but I missed the hint. A few days later, I called him about a job, and he had just hired somebody else the day before, but he'd keep me in mind. The next day, he called back, and had an opening.” Parkinson also worked on projects including book covers, game boxes, magazines and calendars. Among his book covers are such titles as \"Star Frontiers\", \"Forgotten Realms\" and \"Gamma World\". He is also known for his Dragonlance art.\n\nAfter five years working at TSR, Parkinson left and pursued a freelance career for seven years. During this time, most of Parkinson's work was painting covers for the New York publishing market. His clients included Bantam Books, Palladium Books, Penguin Books, and Random House. Some of the authors that he painted covers for include Terry Goodkind, Margaret Weis, Tracy Hickman, and Terry Brooks.\n\nIn 1995, Parkinson's first attempt at game design, \"Guardians\", was published by Friedlander Publishing Group (FPG), which also published Parkinson's first book, titled \"Knightsbridge: The Art of Keith Parkinson\". He published two more books of his artwork: a sketchbook, \"Spellbound\", and a second full-color artbook, \"King's Gate\". Other works from this time include a set of art trading cards and a screensaver produced by Second Nature Software.\n\nIn 2000, Parkinson devoted more of his time to writing and shifted his commercial art to the game industry. He produced art for THQ's \"Summoner\" and painted the well-known artwork for the original \"EverQuest\" as well as its first three expansion packs. In painting the box art, he also created the character Firiona Vie, who has adorned the cover of almost every expansion since.\n\nParkinson was hired as the art director and co-founder of Sigil Games Online, and worked there on the MMORPG \"\" until his death in late 2005. Although Parkinson became ill before he could create the box art for \"Vanguard: Saga of Heroes\", he did create the game's three 'mascot' characters: Jeric, Eila, and Idara. According to Brad McQuaid, when Parkinson knew he could not finish the box art for \"Vanguard\", he hoped that his friend Donato Giancola would complete it. The left side of Donato's painting emulated Parkinson's personal style, as a tribute to him (the left was used for the box art, similar to \"EverQuest\"). Moving to the right, the painting transitions into Giancola's style. As a further tribute to Keith Parkinson, Giancola put a character resembling him into the painting.\n\nAfter a long battle with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), Keith Parkinson died on 26 October 2005. He is survived by his wife, Donna, and sons Nick and Zach. Parkinson was described by his friends and colleagues (and in the eulogy by Brad McQuaid) as having had a true passion for his work, as well as having a friendly and positive demeanor until his death. A small graveside funeral was held at Mission San Luis Rey de Francia led by Vicar David Smith of Faith Lutheran Church in Vista, California.\n\nIn 2002, Parkinson was nominated for a Chesley Award from the ASFA, for Best Product Illustration, for his work on \"Shadows of Luclin\".\n\nAfter his death, an art expo, called \"The Masters of Fantasy Art — A Tribute to Keith Parkinson\" went on tour from February–July 2007. Laura Naviaux, Senior Brand Manager for Sony Online Entertainment, explained: \"Our goal for 'The Masters of Fantasy Art' tour is to highlight the artistry that is integral to the creation of video games, as well as the influences of classical art on the industry as a whole. By showcasing Keith Parkinson's work on the new \"Vanguard: Saga of Heroes\" online videogame and joining up with The Art Institute, we hope to raise the public's awareness of computer and graphical arts as a discipline.\"\n\nIn August and September 2008, Parkinson's alma mater Kendall College of Art and Design at Ferris State University, honored him and his TSR contemporaries Larry Elmore and Jeff Easley with a gallery exhibit called \"Out of the Dungeons\". Director of Exhibitions Sarah Joseph stated, \"We wanted to honor Parkinson [...] It seemed fitting to include Elmore and Easley, since all three of them worked together for a number of years.\"\n\n"}

It includes two halls for public concerts, \"Großer Sendesaal\" (1963) and \"Kleiner Sendesaal\", also administrative buildings and an antenna tower.\n\nThe history of broadcasting in Hanover dates back to 1924 when the first radio programs were aired from a factory building of the engineering firm Hanomag. After World War II that building was in the British zone. A new office (\"Rundfunkbüro\") was opened in the in 1945, and first concerts were aired from buildings of the \"Pädagogische Hochschule\" (School of education). Regular broadcasting, now by the Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (NWDR) began in 1948, including symphony concerts and the series \"Funkbilder aus Niedersachsen\" (radio images from Lower Saxony), which began with the second Export-Messe.\n\nPlans for a new Funkhaus began end of 1948. , responsible for municipal building, voted for the location, to set an example for buildings along the lake. After a competition, designs by , Gerd Lichtenhahn and Dieter Oesterlen were combined. The first buildings were completed in 1950, and inaugurated on 20 January 1951. Due to the advanced technical equipment of the complex, it was immediately called the most modern Funkhaus in Europe. In 1955 the NWDR was split in the NDR in Hamburg and the Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR) in Cologne. A redaction team of the NDR was installed in the Funkhaus in 1958.\n\nOesterlen designed the concert hall \"Großer Sendesaal\" which was built from 1960 to 1963.

It was one of a set of at least six canons probably written in Vienna in 1782. Sung by six voices as a three-part round, it is thought to be a party piece for his friends. The main theme is derived from the final movement of Joseph Haydn's Symphony No. 3 in G-Major.\n\n\"Lick me in the arse\" is a calque of the song's title and lyrics into English. A more idiomatic translation would be the English \"Kiss my arse!\" or American \"Kiss my ass!\"\n\nMozart died in 1791 and his widow, Constanze Mozart, sent the manuscripts of the canons to publishers Breitkopf & Härtel in 1799 saying that they would need to be adapted for publication. The publisher changed the title and lyrics of this canon to the more acceptable \"\" (\"Let us be glad!\"). Of Mozart's original text, only the first words were documented in the catalogue of his works produced by Breitkopf & Härtel.\n\nA new text version, which may have been the authentic one, came to light in 1991. Handwritten texts to this and several other similar canons were found added to a printed score of the work in an historical printed edition acquired by Harvard University's Music Library. They had evidently been added to the book by a later hand. However, since in six of the pieces these entries matched texts that had, in the meantime, independently come to light in original manuscripts, it was hypothesised that the remaining three may, too, have been original, including texts for K. 231 (\"Leck mich im Arsch\" itself), and another Mozart work, \"Leck mir den Arsch fein recht schön sauber\" (\"Lick my arse nice and clean\", K. 233; K. 382d in the revised numbering). Later research revealed that the latter work was likely composed by Wenzel Trnka.\n\nThe text rediscovered in 1991 consists only of the repeated phrases:\n<poem></poem>\nwhere \"A...\" obviously stands for \"Arsch\"; \"g'schwindi\" is a dialect word meaning \"quickly\".\n\nThe bowdlerized text of the early printed editions reads:\nAnother semi-bowdlerized adaptation is found in the recordings of \"The Complete Mozart\" edition by Brilliant Classics:\nThis is a clear allusion to the line \"\" attributed to the late medieval German knight Götz von Berlichingen, known best as the title hero of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's drama.\n\nThis version contains a slight error about the Goethe source: the line occurs in the third act.\n\n\n\n"}

Developed and marketed by Meteodyn, Meteodyn WT was first released in September 2009. The software quantifies the wind resource in a desired terrain in order to assess the feasibility of a proposed wind farm. The software’s objective is to design the most profitable wind farm. This is achieved by taking into account the measured wind data at a measurement tower and the terrain conditions. Both of these are essential to be able to obtain the wind conditions and therefore the wind resources of the desired terrain.\n\nMeteodyn WT has been validated with actual wind measurements by independent studies.\n\nMeteodyn WT is used by wind turbine manufacturers, wind farm developers, consulting firms and wind farm operators.\n\nThe current version of Meteodyn WT displays all projects in one world map; this map already includes terrain and roughness data.\n\nMeteodyn WT features a geographical data management tool, a meteorological data processing tool, a LIDAR correction tool, a wind turbine creation tool, a wind turbines micro-siting tool, a wind atlas tool and an auto-convergence tool.\n\nIt also includes the following functions: wind resource mapping, wake effect computation, annual energy production (AEP) with / without wake effect, directional wind shear at each turbine, wind and turbulence matrices at each turbine, IEC compliance, automatic report generation, losses and uncertainties.\n\nThe current version of Meteodyn WT exports to the following wind energy software formats: .wrg, .rsf, .wrb, .fmv and Flowres. Google earth and Surfer export formats are also available.\n\nMeteodyn WT uses computational fluid dynamics (CFD) which directly takes into consideration the geometry of the terrain in question. The software solves the Navier-Stokes equations numerically by using the K-L turbulence model. This technique to solve the Navier-Stokes equations takes into account the stability of the atmosphere.\n\nMeteodyn WT is available in English, French, Standard Chinese and Spanish.\n\nMeteodyn WT is a proprietary software package created for Microsoft Windows and usually, any new Meteodyn WT version supports the current Microsoft Windows version and some older ones.

{"id": "242838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=242838", "title": "Music of Finland", "text": "Music of Finland\n\nThe music of Finland can be roughly divided into the categories of folk music, classical and contemporary art music, and contemporary popular music.\n\nThe folk music of Finland is typically influenced by Karelian traditional tunes and lyrics of the \"Kalevala\" metre. Karelian heritage has traditionally been perceived as the purest expression of Finnic myths and beliefs, thought to be spared from Germanic and Slavic influences. In the west of the country, more mainstream Nordic folk music traditions prevail. The Sami people of northern Finland have their own musical traditions, collectively Sami music. Finnish folk music has undergone a roots revival in the recent decades, and has also become a part of popular music.\n\nIn the field of classical and contemporary art music, Finland has produced a proportionally exceptional number of musicians and composers.\n\nContemporary popular music includes a renowned heavy metal scene like other Nordic countries, as well as a number of prominent rock and pop bands, jazz musicians, hip hop performers and makers of dance music. There is also a Schlager scene with bandstand dancing where the local variety of tango is also popular.\n\nThere are two major traditions of folk music in Finland, namely, music of the \"Kalevala form,\" and \"Nordic folk music\" or \"pelimanni music\" (North Germanic \"spelman\", \"player of music\"). The former is considered the older one. Its most important form is called \"runonlaulanta\" (\"poem singing\", or chanting) which is traditionally performed in a trochaic tetrametre using only the first five notes on a scale. Making use of alliteration, this type of singing was used to tell stories about heroes like Väinämöinen, Lemminkäinen, and Kullervo. The songs were memorised, not written down, and performed by a soloist, or by a soloist and a chorus in antiphony (see: \"Kalevala\"). The Vantaa Chamber Choir is an example of a choir that sings such poems in modern arrangements.\n\n\"Pelimanni\" music is the Finnish version of the Nordic folk dance music, and it is tonal. It came to Finland from Central Europe via Scandinavia, starting in the 17th century, and in the 19th century, it replaced the Kalevalaic tradition. \"Pelimanni\" music was generally played on the fiddle and clarinet. Later, the harmonium and various types of accordions were also used. Common dances in the \"pelimanni\" traditions include: polka, mazurka, schottische, quadrille, waltz, and minuet.\n\nA form of rhyming sleighride singing called \"rekilaulu\" also became popular in the 17th century. Despite opposition from most of the churches in Finland, \"rekilaulu\" remained popular and is today a common element in pop songs. Since the 1920s, several popular Finnish performers have used \"rekilaulu\" as an integral part of their repertoire. Early pioneers in this field of pop rekilaulu included Arthur Kylander, while Erkki Rankaviita, Kuunkuiskaajat, and Pinnin Pojat have kept the tradition alive.\n\nEarly in the 20th century, the region of Kaustinen became a center of innovation for \"pelimanni\" music. Friiti Ojala and Antti Järvelä were fiddlers of the period. Konsta Jylhä and the other members of Purpuripelimannit (formed in 1946) became perhaps the most influential group of this classical period. Well-known Finnish folk music groups of today in the Kaustinen tradition include JPP, Frigg (although part Norwegian), and Troka. A group more focused on the earlier \"Kalevala\" singing traditions and the \"kantele\" is Värttinä. Another important folk musician of today is the accordionist Maria Kalaniemi.\n\nCommon instruments today also include trumpets, horns and whistle. Important musical virtuosos are Leena Joutsenlahti, Teppo Repo and Virpi Forsberg. More traditional Finnish instruments include the \"kantele\", which is a chordophone, and was used in the \"Kalevala\" by the hero Väinämöinen. More primitive instruments like the \"jouhikko\" (a bowed lyre) and the \"säkkipilli\" (Finnish bagpipe) had fallen into disuse, but are now finding new popularity in a folk revival.\n\nIn the 20th century, influences from modern music and dances such as jazz and foxtrot led to distinctively Finnish forms of dance music, such as \"humppa\" and \"jenkka\".\n\nThe Sami of northern Finland, Sweden, and Norway are known for highly spiritual songs called \"joik\", reminiscent of a few types of Native American singing. The same word sometimes refers to \"lavlu\" or \"vuelie\" songs, though this is technically incorrect. The hip hop artist Amoc is noted for rapping in Inari Sami, a Sami language from the area of Inari.\n\nIn the 18th century, public concerts were established in Turku and Erik Tulindberg wrote six very famous string quartets. After Russia's 1809 annexation of Finland, the cities of Viipuri and Helsinki became cultural centers and opera became very popular. The first Finnish opera was written by the German composer Fredrik Pacius in 1852. Pacius also wrote \"Maamme/Vårt land\" (Our Land), Finland's national anthem and founded Akademiska Sångföreningen in year 1838, the oldest still active choir in Finland.\n\nIn 1874, the Society for Culture and Education \"(Kansanvalistusseura)\" was founded in order to provide opportunities for artistic expression, beginning with the Jyväskylä festival in 1881. The festival, organized on Estonian roots, still exists today. In 1883, the Helsinki University Chorus \"(Ylioppilaskunnan Laulajat)\" was founded as one of the few Finnish-language choirs in the mostly Swedish-speaking scene. The same year conductor Robert Kajanus founded what is known as the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra and Martin Wegelius founded what is now known as the Sibelius Academy.\n\nIn the 1890s, Finnish nationalism based on the \"Kalevala\" spread, and Jean Sibelius became famous for his vocal symphony Kullervo. He soon received a grant to study poetry singers in Karelia and continued his rise as the first prominent Finnish musician. In 1899 he composed Finlandia, which played its important role in Finland gaining independence. He remains one of Finland's most popular national figures and is a symbol of the nation.\n\nAlongside Sibelius, the national romanticism sprouted a number of composers who all contributed in the formation of a distinct Finnish style of music. Heino Kaski was a composer of small chamber music pieces, Erkki Melartin's vast output includes six symphonies, Yrjö Kilpinen composed a vast number of solo songs, as well as Leevi Madetoja, Toivo Kuula. The 1930s saw composers like Uuno Klami and Yrjö Kilpinen rise to popularity. Kilpinen's approach was somewhat nationalistic, whereas Klami had Karelian influences while also leaning towards French models.\n\nFinland has a very lively classical music scene. Composers are accompanied by a large number of great conductors such as Mikko Franck, Esa-Pekka Salonen (also a notable composer), Jukka-Pekka Saraste, Osmo Vänskä, Susanna Mälkki, Leif Segerstam and Sakari Oramo OBE. Many Finnish singers and instrumentalists have also achieved international success. Among them are the opera singers Martti Talvela, Karita Mattila, Matti Salminen, Soile Isokoski and Topi Lehtipuu, the pianists Ralf Gothoni, Olli Mustonen and Paavali Jumppanen, as well as the clarinettist Kari Kriikku and the violinist Pekka Kuusisto. Practically all prominent Finnish musicians perform both classical and contemporary art music, the old and new music are not separated from each other.\n\nThe opening of the new Finnish National Opera in 1993 and the new Helsingin Musiikkitalo in 2011 strengthened the position of classical and art music in the national infrastructure. The orchestra network in Finland might be proportionally the densest in the world, with the 30 member orchestras of the Association of Finnish Symphony Orchestras.\n\nAino Ackté and other prominent opera singers founded the Finnish Opera in 1911. Ackté also began a festival in Savonlinna the following year; this was the precursor of the Savonlinna Opera Festival, which was started in the 1960s, shortly before the new Finnish opera became famous in the 1970s. Leevi Madetoja's 1924 \"Pohjalaisia\", an operatic allegory about Russian oppression during the previous decades, became popular during the 1920s. At roughly the same time, Aarre Merikanto composed the opera \"Juha\" to the libretto by Aino Ackté, who rejected it and asked Leevi Madetoja to compose another version instead; Merikanto's Juha was first performed after the composers death in 1958, and is nowadays widely regarded as an underrated masterwork.\n\nAulis Sallinen started a new wave of Finnish opera in the 1970s with \"The Horseman\" and \"The Red Line\". The Red Line was soon recognized all over the globe with numerous reproductions in a.o. Moscow, London and New York City. Along with Sallinen's stage works, Joonas Kokkonen's opera The Last Temptations contributed heavily to the new rise of the Finnish opera music. More recent major operas by Finnish composers include among others Kaija Saariaho's \"L'Amour de loin\" and \"Adriana mater\" as well as Olli Kortekangas's \"Isän tyttö\" (\"Daddy's Girl\").\n\nThe first wave of post-classical music in Finland came about in the 1920s with young modernists Aarre Merikanto, Väinö Raitio and Sulho Ranta. However, this movement was tamed by the growing nationalistic tendency in the arts before the Second World War. In the 1940s, Erik Bergman and Joonas Kokkonen gained popularity and added important technical innovations to Finnish music. A new generation of Finnish composers turned into modernism, like Einojuhani Rautavaara and Usko Meriläinen, while the neoclassical style had its voice in the music of Einar Englund. The 1950s saw an increase in international attention on Finnish music and soon helped modernize Finnish composing.\n\nThe forming of the \"Ears Open!\" society in 1977 turned out to be the major change in the Finnish art music. From its circles there emerged a few composers and musicians who achieved worldwide success, like the conductor-composer Esa-Pekka Salonen, and the composers Eero Hämeenniemi, Kaija Saariaho, Magnus Lindberg and Jouni Kaipainen. The early \"Ears Open!\" society followed keenly the Central European modernism along the lines of Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen, but also showed a lot of interest towards the post-war Polish School composers like Witold Lutoslawski. \"Ears Open!\" was followed by the forming of Avanti! Chamber Orchestra in 1983, which offered a fine platform for composers and instrumentalists to introduce new works and stylistic flows in Finland.\n\nIn the 21st century, the modernist movement has waned somewhat, but is still represented by composers like Veli-Matti Puumala and Lotta Wennäkoski. Juhani Nuorvala is a rare minimalist, whereas Osmo Tapio Räihälä and Sebastian Fagerlund are leaning more towards post-modernism.\n\nEven performing of contemporary art music blossoms in Finland, with specialized groups like Uusinta Chamber Ensemble and Zagros. The most important stages for contemporary art music are the established festivals Time of Music in Viitasaari, Musica nova Helsinki and Tampere Biennale, as well as the Klang Concert Series in Helsinki.\n\nIskelmä (coined directly from the German word \"Schlager\", meaning \"hit\") is a traditional Finnish word for a light popular song. Georg Malmstén started his career in the 1930s. After World War II and pre-rock music era, such names as Olavi Virta or Tapio Rautavaara, for example, were among the most popular male singing stars in Finland, and Toivo Kärki and Reino Helismaa most popular songwriters. Such foreign musical genres as tango would find their domestic audience as their Finnish appropriations. Laila Kinnunen, Carola, Annikki Tähti, Brita Koivunen and Vieno Kekkonen were some of the most acclaimed Finnish chanteuses of this time period. From the late 1960s, Irwin Goodman ( Antti Hammarberg), combining \"iskelmä\" and protest songs, would gain popularity with the humorous tunes penned by Vexi Salmi, who would become one of the most laborious writer of lyrics also for other Finnish artists. Juha \"Watt\" Vainio was another popular songwriter, known not only for Finnish renditions of many international hits but also for his own songs and being a performer in his own right. In the 1970s, hugely successful \"Finnhits\" compilation records of various artists would continue in the \"iskelmä\" tradition. Also rural-flavoured \"humppa\" would prove to be a successful variation of \"iskelmä\", later on parodied by the band Eläkeläiset. Other popular Finnish \"iskelmä\" singers are among all Katri Helena, Danny (a.k.a. Ilkka Lipsanen), Fredi, Eino Grön, Erkki Junkkarinen, Frederik (a.k.a. Ilkka Sysimetsä), Marion Rung, Tapani Kansa, Kirka (a.k.a. Kirill Babitzin), Matti & Teppo, Jari Sillanpää, and Kikka Sirén. The annual Eurovision Song Contest has been avidly followed in Finland and eagerly participated by the singers voted to the contest by national juries, and were finally successful in 2006 with the melodic heavy rock band Lordi.\n\nLike Finnish music in general, \"iskelmä\" is written mostly in minor, although to this rule there are many exceptions. The melodies have a distinguishable Finnish \"flavour\" that is somewhat related to Russian and Italian melodies and harmonies although Scandinavian and Anglo-American influence can also be heard.\n\n\"Iskelmä\" music is mostly and essentially dance music, and it is mostly if not solely performed on dancing stages and halls spread around the country. The best known and perhaps most beloved and respected though not most performed or danced genre of dances is the tango. A clear indication of this is, that the annual Finnish contest for iskelmä artists is named as \"Tangomarkkinat\" meaning \"The Tango Marketplace\"; many of the superstars of contemporary iskelmä have won this competition and it is major spectacle in Finland, even to some extent comparable with the San Remo festival in Italy.\n\nIskelmä is typically non-urban music and its greatest popularity is situated to the countryside and smaller cities.\n\nTraditionally has accordion been the major instrument in iskelmä music and it is still played, but has in most cases been replaced by guitar, electric piano and synthesizer. These, with drums, electric bass and occasional use of saxophone form the basic instrumentation of iskelmä.\n\nRock arrived in Finland in the 1950s. Founded in the 1960s, Love Records was one of the first domestic record labels dedicated to Finnish rock music, even though the label's roster also included jazz and political songs. During the late 1960s, Blues Section, a group inspired by Jimi Hendrix and The Who gained the reputation of being \"the first Finnish band of international quality\". Another band that gained some reputation was Apollo that had the later great jazz-drummer Edward Vesala as a band member. During these early days of Finnish rock the music didn't have much typical Finnish \"flavour\" and in the case of most bands, the activity was restricted in performing music made by international superstars. The aforementioned Blues Section later developed into internationally acknowledged \"superband\" Wigwam, had an English singer Jim Pembroke, who also wrote the lyrics and many of the melodies/harmonies of their songs. In the early days of the band there however were also songs with Finnish lyrics written by Jukka Gustafsson such as the classical Luulosairas.\n\nDuring the 1970s, progressive rock groups Wigwam and Tasavallan Presidentti received critical acclaim in the United Kingdom, but fame evaded them. Pekka Streng was one of the great early pioneers of Finnish rock music with his very personal progressive folkrock and Finnish lyrics with a spiritual content. In the 2000s, there was a Streng-renaissance and one of his songs even became an international club hit. A hard-rock group called Hurriganes was popular in Sweden as well as in Finland, but not further afield. Hector, Juice Leskinen, Dave Lindholm and many other successful artists of the 1970s sang their lyrics in Finnish, a trend that has continued to this day. During the 1970s the genre of \"suomirock\" were born through the pioneering work of artists such as mentioned above.\n\nSuomirock is a word that literally means Finnish rock music. However, its true meaning is a more specific one, meaning rock/pop music with Finnish lyrics. As a genre and a name it really started its life in the 1980s following the punk movement. It means rock/pop music, that is not only imitating international trends or otherwise having international sound and English lyrics, but a form of rock-music, that is recognizably Finnish and have Finnish lyrics. A more and more general and recent term is \"suomipop\". The boundaries between what is considered \"rock\" and \"pop\" have become quite blurred and arbitrary, and largely dependent upon personal preference. As it is also to some extent with rock / pop and iskelmä. Traditionally in iskelmä-music the artists themselves with few exceptions did not write their songs or lyrics, but in the rock scene the singer/songwriter aspect of the artist was considered important. It still is, but in the 2000s it is more and more typical that new performers such as \"Idols\" songcontest winner Ari Koivunen perform even heavy rock in the manner, that used to be typical only in iskelmä-scene.\n\nThe punk movement arrived in Finland in 1977 and had a great influence on the Finnish youth culture, Pelle Miljoona being the most famous Finnish punk singer. Terveet Kädet also started the hardcore punk-wave in Finland. Another popular band, Eppu Normaali, also started during this time period, (later to change its style from punk to rock / pop). At the same time, Finland also had a massive Ted movement of Elvis and rockabilly fans, later parodied by Finnish lo-fi punk band Liimanarina.\n\nIn the 1980s, most favoured artists were punkish Dingo and heavy-hearted Yö, both singing their lyrics in Finnish. In the underground, Ismo Alanko, considered by many as the foremost Finnish rock lyricist, gained a legendary status with his punkish groups Hassisen Kone and Sielun Veljet. Kauko Röyhkä was another literate underground icon, leaning musically towards Velvet Underground. The 1980s showed short international fame for punk style glam rock band Hanoi Rocks. Hanoi Rocks have been cited as an influence by major bands such as Guns N' Roses. Smack and Peer Günt were other successful Finnish bands of same style. Heavy metal was very popular in Finland during the 1980s, producing groups like Stone, the latter being a fondly remembered speed metal act. Hardcore punk is also popular in Finland, including bands such as Endstand, Abduktio, I Walk the Line, and Lighthouse Project.\n\nIn the early 1990s Finnish rock parody group the Leningrad Cowboys, a re-grouped international rock comedy band that grew out of the Finnish comedy band Sleepy Sleepers, whose members were used as actors in Aki Kaurismäki's comedy film \"Leningrad Cowboys Go America\", achieved Central European touring success and performed live at the MTV Music Awards in New York City in 1994, together with the full Red Army Choir, performing \"Sweet Home Alabama\". This was the biggest TV audience of any Finnish music artist ever. Leningrad Cowboys were famous for outrageous outfits including ridiculous rock-a-billy hairdos and ultra-pointed shoes. The band was not able to develop that visibility into more U.S. success but remained popular in parts of Europe.\n\nThough Finnish bands tend to write their lyrics in English as to leave their music open to countries outside of native Finnish boundaries, in the 1990s bands such as Apulanta, Miljoonasade, Ultra Bra and the shamanic art-punk group CMX had found their share of success with Finnish lyrics. The hard-to-define electronic country garage rock group 22 Pistepirkko got excellent reviews in the Finnish rock press and has reached some kind of a cult status in Central Europe. Some other notable Finnish cult rock groups of this era are the psychedelic, Hendrixian Kingston Wall that went in their late period far into psychedelia taking influence from shamanism and some of some genres of electronic dance music, and equally psychedelic but gothic, gloomy, and heavy Mana Mana.\n\nA band to enjoy recent commercial success is The Rasmus. After eleven years together and several domestic releases, the band finally captured Europe. Their \"Dead Letters\" album sold 1.5 million units worldwide and garnered them eight gold and five platinum album designations. The single \"In the Shadows\" placed on Top 10 charts in eleven countries and was the most played video on MTV Europe for 2005. The Helsinki natives released their follow up album, \"Hide From The Sun\", domestically in 2005. The album has a U.S. release date of 10.10.2006. To promote the album's U.S. release, the band has toured with the Welsh band Lostprophets, a band that has gained a great deal of success in both Europe and the United States. The new album \"Black Roses\" is set to be released on September. The album was produced by Desmond Child and the first single is called \"Livin' in a World Without You\". This album was released worldwide on September 29. The single livin in a world without you was released on 10 September 2008.\n\nFinland is known for its many heavy metal acts, including many from the death metal, black metal, doom metal, folk metal, power metal, and symphonic metal subgenres.\n\nFinland host a doom metal scene more focused on the depressive mood of the genre, evoking an intense grieving feeling. The bands play with very slow tempos and melodic tones, creating an atmosphere of darkness and melancholia. This scene was kick-started by the band Rigor Mortis (which, due to an older US band with the same name, changed their name to Spiritus Mortis), which originated in 1987. Notable bands include Reverend Bizarre, Minotauri, Dolorian, Shape of Despair, Thergothon, Skepticism and Unholy.\n\nIn the later 1990s the symphonic metal group Apocalyptica played Metallica cover songs as cello quartettos and sold half a million records worldwide. The recently retired Timo Rautiainen & Trio Niskalaukaus were one of Finland's most popular metal acts in the early 2000s, having risen from the ashes of late 1980s – early 1990s cult band Lyijykomppania. Children's power metal band Hevisaurus have also become popular, mostly in their native country.\n\nSeveral Finnish metal bands have attained considerable worldwide success within the underground metal scene. Some remarkable examples of such bands are Stratovarius and Sonata Arctica, highly renowned as one of the top power metal bands of the world, and Children of Bodom, with their creative combination of power metal and melodic death metal.\n\nNightwish is considered a pioneer of symphonic metal that incorporates power metal as well as gothic metal in its music and had Tarja Turunen, a classical singing soprano, as its vocalist until 2005. The band has received platinum and gold certifications for its albums sales in many countries and is the third best selling Finnish artist. The band has also been nominated for several awards and amongst the ones it has won 11 Emma-gala awards, the Echo award, the Mtv Europe music award, the World music award and the Metal Storm award. In 2000 the band participated in the Finnish qualification for the Eurovision song contest and ended in the second place.\n\nKotiteollisuus is undoubtedly one of the most popular bands in Finland, having produced one platinum and several gold-selling albums and winning Emma-awards in 2003 and 2005 for best metal record (Helvetistä itään) and best DVD (Kotiteollisuus DVD) respectively.\n\nMost recently, the Finnish hard rock band Lordi won the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest with a record 292 points, giving Finland its first ever victory. The song they used was \"Hard Rock Hallelujah\" and they celebrated this with a free concert in Market Square in Helsinki, Finland, on 26 May 2006.\n\nFrom the beginning of 2000, HIM reached greater sales and more international success than any other band to ever come from Finland. Going gold with their first official American release Dark Light. Several Finnish bands have followed the lead of that band. Entwine, Lullacry, and Poisonblack are just a few Finnish bands of these genres.\n\nFinland also has its share of hip-hop bands as during the late 1990s to early 2000s, the Finnish hip-hop scene has gained strength. Dating back from growing underground culture one of the first Finnish Hip Hop records with lyrics in English was recorded at Vernissa (C) Manus / (P) Johanna Kustannus 1991 by Damn The Band. Later Finland has Nuera with MC's Skem (Henry Kaprali) & Dream (Petri Laurila) from Tampere region. Nueras first release is dated to 1992. Same guys, together with DJ K2 were also behind a hip-hop based radio show on YleX. The first popular hip-hop band to break the taboo of making rap lyrics in Finnish (rapping in Finnish was not regarded as serious business because the first artists to do this in the early 1990s such as Raptori, Nikke T and Pääkköset were humorous project and were popular mostly among children) was Fintelligens arguably one of the most successful hip hop bands in Finland. Let's not forget about Ceebrolistics, their first cassette single \"Sping\" was released in 1995 their lyrics has been both in Finnish and English. Few other important very popular but underground acts were MC Taakibörsta, Notkea Rotta and Paleface just to mention a few from the same era.\n\nToday rap music is one of the major genres of Finnish pop-music and there are many artists, who have reached wide popularity. Still it can be said, that rap-scene is primarily an underground-movement. But even independent artists such as ASA with often very political and critical lyrics are quite popular. ASA's \"leijonaa mä metsästän\"-album was the third on Finnish albumchart in 2005. Finnish rap-artists, such as Paleface with English lyrics have not attained international success. An exception to this is /breakbeat-/electro-/ hiphop-band Bomfunk MC's, who with their MC Raymond Ebanks became popular in Central Europe, as they had the most sold European hit single of 2000, \"Freestyler\" along with trance music act Darude's international hit \"Sandstorm\".\n\nIn the 1990s, a popular new trend was so-called Eurodance music and this style also had Finnish followers, many of which however are today quite forgotten. A couple of bands also wrote their lyrics in English, but didn't make it on the international music market. To mention few artists, there were Hausmylly, Aikakone and Movetron.\n\nSome contemporary Pop/Rock singers, such as Maija Vilkkumaa, Sanni Kurkisuo, Jenni Vartiainen, Anssi Kela, Irina, Chisu, Anna Puu, Anna Eriksson, Hanna Pakarinen and Antti Tuisku, and pop rock groups such as Scandinavian Music Group, Poets of the Fall and PMMP, are very popular in Finland and they all primarily sing in Finnish, which may contribute to their relatively low profile internationally.\n\nSince the late 1990s and early 2000s, female artists have taken a more visible role in the Finnish pop music scene, not only as performers, but also songwriters. A talented singer-songwriter Chisu writing Finnish lyrics for instance is a good example of this phenomenon with a couple of her songs, that can very well be considered classics beside the songs of Eppu Normaali, Tuomari Nurmio and others in the future.\n\nA number of iskelmä, rock- and popsongs have attained a status of a classic, the standard for the status being, that many have had some connection with the song and it is not a \"hit of today\". Although the differences between \"pop\", \"rock\" and \"iskelmä\" are remarkable in social signification – stereotypically \"iskelmä\" being music for people of greater age and countryside, \"rock\" and \"pop\" that of youth and people living in cities – the boundaries between the popular music \"genres\" are in reality rather vague. This seems to be true especially in a small number of popular songs that are performed over and over again in original form, or rearranged into new musical idioms and dialects.\n\nIn the 2000s, an underground-movement of new Finnish folk music came out. Artists such as Joose Keskitalo, Kuusumun Profeetta, Paavoharju and others have brought something new into the Finnish music scene although wider popularity has not reached them. Despite their lyrics written in Finnish these bands have also attained international recognition, even cult-following. Also very well known artists with a status of a \"classic\", J. Karjalainen and Pauli Hanhiniemi have in their contemporary production gone to the direction of folk-music although this music has in spite of being recognized by critics, been left unnoticed by the larger public.\n\nAnother new phenomenon of 2000s, beside that of the very popular rap- and the underground folk-scenes, is \"suomireggae\". With their Finnish lyrics with moral and spiritual content these artists such as Soul-Captain Band, Kapteeni Ä-ni, Jukka Poika and Raappana have also reached not just a cult following but also wider popularity.\n\nThe underground scenes of various genres are very lively in Finland at the moment and a lot of bands and artists defy the genre-limits. A good example is very popular Finnish underground rap artist ASA (formerly known as MC Avain), who has used folk-artists as the accompanying band. Of bands such as Profeetta ja UMU it is very hard to say, what genre they represent.\n\nIn the field of electronic music, Jori Hulkkonen, as well as Jimi Tenor and Pan Sonic, have had underground success worldwide for a decade. In the sphere of trance Finland has given birth to internationally renowned DJs such as DJ Orkidea, Alex Kunnari, DJ Proteus, JS16, Super8 & Tab and Paavo Siljamäki. Other notable Finnish artists are Mesak, Imatran Voima, Mr Velcro Fastener, EODEM, Luomo a.k.a. Vladislav Delay, Brothomstates, Lackluster, Pan Sonic, and Ovuca. Some of the best-known electronic music labels are among all Sähkö Recordings, Kahvi Records, Dum Records (run by Kimmo Rapatti a.k.a. Mono Junk) and Jyväskylä's Rikos Records. The indisputable pioneer of Finnish electronic music is Erkki Kurenniemi who built his legendary DIMI synthesizers in the late 1960s and early 1970s. There's also the Finnish underground psy trance culture, which is mostly active in the Helsinki metropolitan area. The Finnish style (suomisaundi) of psy trance music is known worldwide and has notable fan audiences abroad, for example in Japan and Russia. Main characters in Finnish psy trance are artists such as Mullet Mohawk, Texas Faggott and Squaremeat. By far the most popular Finnish electronica artist is Darude (Ville Virtanen), who gained international success with his chart-topping single \"Sandstorm,\" and the following hit album \"Before the Storm.\" His music is a combination of hard house and progressive trance. The Finnish Hard Dance scene has also gained some following, primarily due to Helsinki-based DJ Proteus winning the title of Best DJ at The Hard Dance Awards in 2004 and 2005. Finland also has a popular and internationally recognised Freeform hardcore scene, with the FINRG label enjoying large success in the UK, Australia, and more recently Canada and the United States.\n\nIn experimental electronica, noise and ambient electronic music, Finland is represented by artists like Petri Kuljuntausta, Pink Twins, Ihokas, Rihmasto, Nemesis, Niko Skorpio, Dystopia, Ozone Player, Winterplanet, Corporate 09, Outer Space Alliance.\n\nJazz came to Finland in connection with the visit of American immigrants in 1926. One of the very first Finnish jazz bands was Dallapé which is still active to this day. Klaus Salmi, Eugen Malmstén, , Toivo Kärki, and Kauko Viitamäki are some of the first professional Finnish jazz musicians. Jazz bands were mainly doing dance gigs so the music had to be suitable for dancing. Popular genres were accordion jazz, ragtime, swing, jazz schlager and waltz.\n\nThe first decades of Finnish jazz music were strongly based on imitating foreign role models until the 1960s when a new generation of jazz musicians started to create more original music by combining American tradition and Finnish folk music influences. This group of talented and well trained musicians included , Heikki Sarmanto, Eero Koivistoinen and Henrik Otto Donner. Edward Vesala's and 's band managed to succeed in international contests and festivals. The first Finnish jazz festival, Pori Jazz, was organized for the first time in 1966.\n\nIn the 1970s, Finnish jazz musicians began to mix jazz, funk and progressive rock in their music. Pekka Pöyry, Sakari Kukko, Pekka Pohjola, Jukka Tolonen and Olli Ahvenlahti were some of the most famous Finnish jazz musicians in the 1970s. Sakari Kukko's played jazz music which was heavily influenced by Finnish folk music and progressive rock. The music of Wigwam and Tasavallan Presidentti is usually regarded as progressive rock but it also had elements of jazz fusion. Live concerts often included long improvised solos by highly talented virtuosist. The UMO Jazz Orchestra was founded in 1975 which gave an opportunity to many Finnish jazz musicians to earn their living by playing jazz.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, more talented, educated and professional jazz musicians got into jazz scene and Finnish jazz became more internationally recognized than ever. Jukka Linkola, and Tapani Rinne with his Rinneradio made music combined by many different musical styles. Iiro Rantala, Rami Eskelinen and Eerik Siikasaari founded Trio Töykeät in 1988 and the band attained worldwide interest. Other important jazz musicians from this era are , , , Markus Ketola and to name a few. founded Espoo Big Band and April Jazz festival in the 1980s.\n\nAfter the 1990s, Finnish jazz has evolved further into many different musical directions and even samplers were used to create more unique sounds. , U-Street All Stars and Quintessence played nu-jazz with electronic and pop influences. Oddarrang, Dalindéo, Mopo, Teemu Viinikainen, , , Manuel Dunkel and Mikko Innanen represent the present and future of Finnish jazz music. Today there are well over 200 professional jazz musicians in Finland.\n\nWhile a return to folk and socially active music was occurring in the United States, United Kingdom and elsewhere across the world, the Finnish roots revival began in the 1960s. The Ilmajoki Music Festival and Kaustinen Folk Music Festival, quickly became musical centers for the country and helped revitalize traditional Finnish folk music in a roots revival. The Runosong was revitalized by a new generation of performers, including Reijo Kela, Kimmo Pohjonen and Heikki Laitinen, who created the \"Kalevala\" performance art piece.\n\nThe International Folk Music Festival, established in 1968 in Kaustinen, was a major event in the popularization of Finnish folk. The 1970s saw further revival of Finnish folk music, including artists like Konsta Jylhä, JPP and Värttinä. Jylhä and his Purppuripelimannit band did the most to popular the scene in Finland.\n\nIn more recent years, some non-Sami artists, including Enigma and Jan Garbarek, have used joik and other Sami styles in their music, while Marie Boine of Norway is probably the most internationally famous Sami star. 1996's critically acclaimed \"Suden Aika\" by Tellu Turkka saw a further return of runosong to the Finnish music scene.\n\nThe Finnish bagpipe, the säkkipilli, though previously extinct, is also being revived by folk musicians such as Petri Prauda.\n\nSince the 1960s, the Lahti Symphony Orchestra's reputation as one of the most important Scandinavian orchestras was cemented by conductor Osmo Vänskä; this helped to cause a boom in opera's popularity during the 1980s, while the form was increasingly seen as archaic elsewhere. the Savonlinna Opera Festival reopened in 1967.\n\nMartti Talvela, Karita Mattila and Jorma Hynninen have become international opera stars, while composers like Kalevi Aho, Olli Kortekangas, Paavo Heininen, Aulis Sallinen, Einojuhani Rautavaara, Atso Almila and Ilkka Kuusisto have written successful operas, with Rautavaara especially achieving international success.\n\nThe military bands are a part of the Finnish Defence Forces. There is a total of\nthirteen military bands in Finland. They are relatively small in size, but are often\nreinforced with other local professional wind players.\n\n\nThese are all fully professional orchestras with occasional support from\nconscripts: In addition; there is a large military band consisting only\nof conscripts with professional conductors called The Conscript Band of\nthe Finnish Defence Forces. Its strength is about 60-70 musicians, it\noperates in Lahti and is concentrated on making marching shows and\nlarge-scale concerts.\n\nA 3-CD box set entitled Beginner's Guide to Scandinavia was released by Nascente/Demon Music Group in May 2011. It was the first time that the various genres of Scandinavian music – pop, folk, jazz and experimental – had been combined on one album. Finnish artists featured include Värttinä, Kimmo Pohjonen, Maria Kalaniemi, Vuokko Hovatta, Sanna Kurki-Suonio, Islaja and Wimme.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3800754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3800754", "title": "Norwegian Media Authority", "text": "Norwegian Media Authority\n\nThe Norwegian Media Authority () is a Norwegian administrative agency under the Norwegian Ministry of Culture and Church Affairs charged with various tasks relating to broadcasting, newspapers and films.\n\nThe Authority's tasks include \n\nThe agency was established 1 January 2005 by merging three government agencies:\n\nThe new authority was located in Fredrikstad from 20 March 2006, where the Mass Media Authority already was located, but in a new building.\n\nIn 2003, the agency was moved from Oslo to Fredrikstad from 20 March 2006, where the Mass Media Authority had been located. This was a program along with six other directorates and inspectorates which were move out of Oslo, which had been initialized by Victor Norman, Minister of Government Administration and Reform of the Conservative Party. It cost 729 million Norwegian krone (NOK) to move the seven agencies. An official report from 2009 concluded that the agencies had lost 75 to 90% of their employees, mostly those with long seniority, and that for a while critical functions for society were dysfunctional. No costs reductions had been made, there was no significant impact on the target area, and there was little impact on the communication between the agencies and the ministries.

Their company consisted of 12 adults and 3 children, drawn from English actors of \"modest accomplishment\". They arrived by the vessel \"Charming Sally\" at Yorktown, Virginia, on 2 June 1752, and made their early performances in nearby Williamsburg. Their first performance, \"The Merchant of Venice\", is generally considered to be the first professional staging of Shakespeare in America. \n\nIn 1753 the Hallam company moved to New York, and in 1754 they played in Philadelphia and in Charleston, South Carolina. In 1755 the company moved to the West Indies, and merged with the company of David Douglass. On Lewis' death, Douglass married his widow Sarah Hallam Douglass. Three years later, the company returned to tour the mainland, as the \"American Company\".\n\nLewis' son, Lewis Hallam, Jr., eighteen at the time of the American Company's first tour, took leading roles alongside Douglass. Lewis Jr.'s style was described as declaratory rather than realistic, but he was much admired and became known as America's leading Shakespearean interpreter. Douglass had his limitations: one Alexander Graydon described him as \"rather a decent than shining actor\". However, he was a capable manager and he gave North America its first Falstaff and King John. Within the repertoire was \"Cymbeline\", which proved a popular vehicle for two of the company's actresses, Margaret Cheer and Nancy Hallam.\n\nIn Quaker and Puritan areas, the company encountered religious opposition to theatre in general. At Rhode Island in 1761 they were obliged to perform Othello disguised as \"a series of moral dialogues\". In 1774, the Continental Congress banned theatre entirely, and the company resettled in Jamaica. By that time, Hugh F. Ranking calculates that the company had performed at least 180 times, their repertoire having included fourteen of Shakespeare's plays. After the peace of 1783, the company returned to New York, with Lewis Hallam Jr. as the leading actor, and John Henry as his co-manager. \n\nLewis Jr. is believed to be the first actor in America to perform in blackface in 1769.\n\nIn November 1766, when the Southwark Theatre in Philadelphia opened, the American Company had the following members:\n\nBy October 1767, new members were:\n\nIn 1792, John Hodgkinson joined.\n\nOther members included Thomas Wignell and Joseph Harper.\n"}
{"id": "924814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=924814", "title": "Patriot Games", "text": "Patriot Games\n\nPatriot Games is a thriller novel, written by Tom Clancy and published on July 1987. It is the indirect sequel to \"Without Remorse\", and is chronologically the first book featuring Jack Ryan, the main character in most of Clancy’s novels. The novel focuses on Ryan being the target of Irish terrorist group Ulster Liberation Army for thwarting their kidnapping attempt on the Prince and Princess of Wales in London. It debuted at number one on the New York Times bestseller list. A film adaptation, starring Harrison Ford as Ryan, premiered on June 5, 1992.\n\nA kidnapping attempt on the Prince and Princess of Wales and their infant son occurs at the Mall in London. The attack is orchestrated by members of the Ulster Liberation Army, an ideologically Maoist and ultra-radical Irish terrorist group splintered from the Provisional Irish Republican Army. However, Jack Ryan, who happens to be nearby, interferes with their operation, killing one of the attackers and incapacitating another, named Sean Miller, at the same time that Miller shoots him in the shoulder. Miller is later arrested.\n\nWhile recovering from his shoulder wound, Ryan is honored by the British government and later becomes a knight. Meanwhile, Miller is sentenced to life imprisonment for the kidnapping attempt; however, his ULA compatriots led by Kevin O’Donnell free him while he is being transported to a maximum security prison in the Isle of Wight. They are then aided by Libyan allies in escaping into their secret training camp in the North African desert. Miller vows revenge on Ryan for making his recent operation fail.\n\nRyan is back teaching history in the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, relieved with the fact that the ULA will not attack him in the United States. Unbeknownst to him, Miller had persuaded his superior O’Donnell to launch an operation in the U.S. aimed at targeting Ryan and his family, and had recruited the assistance of an African-American domestic terrorist group referred to as “the Movement” to do so. While the op is an act of revenge, it is also designed to reduce American support for the rival PIRA, which is to be blamed for the upcoming attack. The assassin sent to kill Ryan at his place of work is intercepted before he manages to complete his task. However, his wife Cathy and their daughter Sally are seriously injured when Miller causes their car to crash on a freeway; they are later transported by helicopter to the University of Maryland Medical Center for treatment.\n\nAfter the attack on his family, Ryan accepts an offer from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to start working as an analyst at their headquarters, partly to collect more information about the previously little-known ULA. Later, the Prince and Princess of Wales come to visit Ryan at his house in Maryland. However, this provides another opportunity for the ULA to strike, once again recruiting the services of “the Movement”. The night of the visit, they launch a sneak attack on Ryan’s home and kidnap the Prince and Princess of Wales, as well as Ryan’s family.\n\nAlthough several guards around the house, including Secret Service personnel, are killed, Ryan, his friend, fighter pilot Robert “Robby” Jackson, and the Prince manage to kill some of the terrorists. They later receive assistance from the local police, the United States Marines, and sailors from the U.S. Naval Academy, who prevent the remaining terrorists from escaping the country in a container ship. Ryan encounters a cornered Miller and tries to kill him, but is restrained by his weapons instructor. After the ULA terrorists are apprehended, he arrives in Bethesda to witness the birth of his son, Jack Ryan, Jr.\n\n\n\"Patriot Games\" was notable for subverting the moral ambiguity of the antagonists in espionage novels by John le Carré, Len Deighton, and Robert Ludlum. According to Marc Cerasini’s essay on the novel, “Clancy’s sensible revulsion toward the terrorists is so strident and intense...that it verges on the physical.” He added that “the author’s understandable disgust toward his villains is ‘bourgeois’, for there is not a shred of sympathy for these Irish ‘patriots’.” \n\nThe novel is also said to be inspired by the gothic horror genre in the depiction of the ULA as “twisted political misfits” who practice political violence in the vein of Count Dracula and his “family”, as well as other gothic elements like the presence of the Prince and Princess of Wales.\n\nClancy started working on \"Patriot Games\" in 1979, along with other novels which would later be published: \"The Hunt for Red October\" (1984) and \"The Cardinal of the Kremlin\" (1988). He says of his passion for accuracy and detail: \"When I was in London, researching \"Patriot Games\", I spent 20 hours walking around the Mall with a camera, clipboard and tape recorder, just choreographing my opening chapter, to make sure it would happen exactly the way I wrote it. Later, when I took my kids there, I could tell them, 'This is the tree that Jack Ryan hid his wife and daughter behind, and that's the road where the bad guys escaped.' I feel a moral obligation to my readers to get it right. In the insurance business, you have to pay attention to details or a client could lose everything. A doctor has to, a cop, a fireman, why not a writer?\" Although he was criticized for doubling down on technical details in the novel, Clancy considers \"Patriot Games\" to be his best.\n\nDiscussing about the final scene where Jack Ryan lets the primary antagonist Sean Miller live instead of killing him, Clancy remarked: \"Of all the letters I got on \"Patriot Games\", not one said, 'He should have killed the little bastard.' Personally I'd have done it. You harm my kids and I'll blow you away. You don't touch my kids. But I'm not Jack Ryan. He has to be in control. He plays by the rules.\"\n\nCommercially, \"Patriot Games\" debuted at number one on the New York Times bestseller list for the week of August 2, 1987. It has since sold over 1,063,000 hardcover copies by the next year.\n\nCritically, the book received generally positive reviews. \"The New York Times\" praised it as \"a powerful piece of popular fiction; its plot, if implausible, is irresistible, and its emotions are universal.\" However, Kirkus Reviews's verdict is mixed, stating that \"Exciting shoot-outs and chases, and lots of Royal wish-fulfillment; but without naval authenticity to bolster the prose, Clancy is a fish out of water.\"\n\nThe novel was adapted as a feature film, which was released on June 5, 1992. Jack Ryan was played by Harrison Ford and Sean Miller was played by Sean Bean. The film is notable for being the sequel to the previous movie \"The Hunt for Red October\" (1990), although the order is the opposite in the books. Additionally, the Prince and Princess of Wales were replaced by Lord Holmes, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Queen's cousin, as the ULA's primary target. \"Patriot Games\" spent two weeks as the No. 1 film, eventually grossing $178,051,587 in worldwide box office business. It has garnered generally positive reviews, and earned a 73% \"Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 33 reviews.\n\nConversely, the movie was criticized by Clancy for deviating too much from the source material, stating that \"I don't like eating dirt, and I won't eat any from these guys.\" \"There is only one, maybe two, scenes in the shooting script that correspond to a scene in the book,\" Clancy later added. \"They have a movie called \"Patriot Games\" that uses my characters—but it's not my story.\" He eventually asked for his name to be removed from the film's promotional materials, and in an apparent countermove, entered negotiations with the same team at Paramount Pictures to sell the rights to his other novel \"The Sum of All Fears\" (1989). By the time the film was released in 2002, the author had cooled off on the idea of having his books made into films.\n"}
{"id": "286031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=286031", "title": "Philip Henslowe", "text": "Philip Henslowe\n\nPhilip Henslowe (c. 1550 – 6 January 1616) was an Elizabethan theatrical entrepreneur and impresario. Henslowe's modern reputation rests on the survival of his diary, a primary source for information about the theatrical world of Renaissance London. He was portrayed by actor Geoffrey Rush in the Academy Award-winning film \"Shakespeare in Love\".\n\nHenslowe was born in Lindfield, Sussex, into a family with roots in Devon. His father, Edmund Henslowe, was appointed Master of the Game for Ashdown Forest, Sussex, from 1539 until his death in 1562. Before Edmund Henslowe's death, his daughter Margaret had married Ralf Hogge, an ironmaster.\n\nBy the 1570s, Henslowe had moved to London, becoming a member of the Dyers' Company. Henslowe is recorded working as assistant to Henry Woodward, reputed to be the bailiff for Viscount Montague, owner of Cowdray House and Battle Abbey in Sussex. Henslowe married Woodward's widow, Agnes, and from 1577 lived in Southwark, opposite the Clink prison. His elder brother Edmund, a merchant, also owned property in Southwark. It was at one time assumed that his wife's inheritance gave Henslowe his start in business, but there is no evidence.\n\nHis success in business appears to have brought him some social prominence. By the early-17th century, he was a vestryman, churchwarden and overseer of the poor in St Saviour's ward in Southwark. During the reign of Elizabeth I, he was a Groom of the Chamber. Under James I, he served as a Gentleman Sewer of the Chamber. Henslowe also served as a collector of the Lay Subsidy.\n\nHenslowe died in 1616 in London, still actively involved in the theatre.\n\nHenslowe developed extensive business interests, including dyeing, starch-making, pawn-broking, money lending and trading in goat skins. He owned property in East Grinstead and Buxted, Sussex, where his brother-in-law, Ralf Hogge, lived. Between 1576 and 1586, Henslowe was involved in the trade in timber from Ashdown Forest. However, his main activity was as a landlord in Southwark. One of his authors, Henry Chettle, described him as being unscrupulously harsh with his poor tenants, even though Henslowe made many loans to Chettle and they seem to have been on friendly terms.\n\nIn 1584, Henslowe purchased a property known as The Little Rose, in Southwark, which contained rose gardens and, almost certainly, a brothel. In 1587, Henslowe and John Cholmley built The Rose, the third of the large, permanent playhouses in London, and the first in Bankside. From 1591, Henslowe partnered with the Admiral's Men after that company split with The Theatre's James Burbage over the division of receipts. Edward Alleyn, the Admiral's' lead actor, married Henslowe's stepdaughter Joan in 1592, and they worked in partnership.\n\nIn 1598 Burbage's company (by then, the Lord Chamberlain's Men) erected the new Globe Theatre in Bankside; Henslowe moved the Admiral's Men to the north-western corner of the city, into a venue he had financed, the Fortune Theatre. John Taylor, the \"Water Poet\", petitioned the King on behalf of the Watermen's Company, because of the expected loss of business transporting theatre patrons across the Thames.\n\nHe also had interests in the Newington Butts Theatre and The Swan Theatre in Southwark.\n\nHenslowe and Alleyn also operated the Paris Garden, a venue for baitings; early in James's reign, they purchased the office of Keeper of the Royal Game, namely bulls, bears and mastiffs. In 1614, he and Jacob Meade built the Hope Theatre in Bankside; designed with a moveable stage for both plays and animal baiting, it was the last of the large open-roof theatres built before 1642. The animal shows ended up ascendant at this venue. The introduction to Ben Jonson's \"Bartholomew Fair\", performed at the Hope in 1614, complains that the theatre is \"as dirty as Smithfield, and as stinking every whit.\" The theatre did not have a regular theatrical tenant after 1617; Henslowe's share in it was willed to Alleyn.\n\nHenslowe's \"diary\" is a valuable source of information on the theatrical history of the period. It is a collection of memoranda and notes that record payments to writers, box office takings, and lists of money lent. Also of interest are records of the purchase of expensive costumes and of stage properties, such as the dragon in Christopher Marlowe's \"Doctor Faustus\", which provide insight into the staging of plays in Elizabethan theatre.\n\nThe diary is written on the reverse of pages of a book of accounts of his brother-in-law Ralf Hogge's ironworks, kept by his brother John Henslowe for the period 1576–1581. Hogge was the Queen's Gunstonemaker, and produced both iron cannon and shot for the Royal Armouries at the Tower of London. John Henslowe seems to have acted as his agent, and Philip prudently reused his old account book. These entries are a valuable source for the early iron-making industry.\n\nThe diary begins covering Henslowe's theatrical activities for 1592. Entries continue, with varying degrees of thoroughness (authors' names were not included before 1597), until 1609; in the years before his death, Henslowe appears to have run his theatrical interests from a greater distance. At some time after his death, his papers, including the diary, were transferred to Dulwich College, which Alleyn had founded.\n\nHenslowe recorded payments to twenty-seven Elizabethan playwrights. He variously commissioned, bought and produced plays by, or made loans to Ben Jonson, Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Middleton, Robert Greene, Henry Chettle, George Chapman, Thomas Dekker, John Webster, Anthony Munday, Henry Porter, John Day, John Marston and Michael Drayton. The diary shows the varying partnerships between writers, in an age when many plays were collaborations. It also shows Henslowe to have been a careful man of business, obtaining security in the form of rights to his authors' works, and holding their manuscripts, while tying them to him with loans and advances. If a play was successful, Henslowe would commission a sequel.\n\nPerformances of works with titles similar to Shakespearean plays, such as a \"Hamlet\", a \"Henry VI, Part 1\", a \"Henry V\", a \"The Taming of the Shrew\" and a \"Titus Andronicus\" are mentioned in the diary with no author listed. Most of these plays were recorded when the Admiral's Men and the Lord Chamberlain's Men briefly joined forces when the playhouses were closed owing to the plague (June 1594).\n\nIn 1599, Henslowe paid Dekker and Henry Chettle for a play called \"Troilus and Cressida\", which is probably the play currently known as British Museum MS. Add 10449 (the actors' names that appear in the plot connect it to the Admiral's Men and date it between March 1598 and July 1600). \nThere is no mention of William Shakespeare (or for that matter Richard Burbage) in Henslowe's diary (despite the forgeries of John Payne Collier); this is due to the fact that Shakespeare and Burbage were during most of their career not connected to Henslowe's theatre. Shakespeare's company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men, performed at The Theatre (starting in 1594) and later The Globe Theatre (starting in 1599).\n\nThe papers first came to critical attention in 1780, when Edmond Malone requested them from the Dulwich College library; the papers had been misplaced and were not found until 1790. Malone made a transcript of the parts he viewed as relevant to his variorum edition of Shakespeare. The original was returned to Dulwich after Malone's death. (Malone's transcript was returned to the library around 1900.) The next scholar to examine the manuscripts was John Payne Collier.\n\n"}
{"id": "12790263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12790263", "title": "Play value", "text": "Play value\n\nPlay value is the essential value of a toy or game for play.\nThe term is frequently employed in the field of child development and playwork for the assessment of toys, games, equipment and spaces. When they are fun and engaging, playthings and spaces are said to have play value; those that are quickly discarded or are considered uninteresting do not. In short, objects of play must be compelling and encourage the child's involvement in order to have true play value. Play value has been defined as 'how much play can you get out of something'. Classic toys are examples of toys with true play value as they continue to provide new discoveries \nand adventures in each subsequent session of play.\n\nThe selection of toys and games has long been a concern to parents and educators. Many fail to \nsufficiently engage children. Stevanne Auerbach emphasizes that products should last as long\nas possible and have many different and long lasting uses. Good examples of toys with\nhigh play value are blocks, construction toys and yo-yos. The toy should have clear\ninstructions so the parent and child are guided to its best use by the designer and\nmanufacturer. In playwork terms it is the child who determines the play value of an object rather than adults or instruction manuals\n\nToys tend to have high play value when they may be used, engaged and employed in manifold ways. \nA good example is Lego bricks which may be assembled and connected in myriad ways to\nmake cars, trucks, planes, trains, etc. \nAnother good example is polymer clay which may be used for sculpting hand-shaped items,\nsuch as beads, jewelry, and charms.\n\nChildren need to be in charge of their own play activity. According to PBS' The Whole Child Web site\nwhen adults plan the play activity and structure the outcome of playtime it is far less effective than if children have the freedom to form their own ideas, practice skills and use playthings at their own speed. Cardboard box toys are an example of playthings which allow children to\nuse their own imaginations.\n\nPlayability is a word that when applied to games has a similar meaning to play value. Those games with strong playability appeal to more than one age or stage of development. For example, Monopoly and Risk\nare two games that appeal to a wide range of ages, though generally not to very young children. Similarly, toys that appeal to more than one age or stage tend to have higher play value.\n\nAuthors Nancy Carlsson-Paige & Diane Levin note that play value in toys can be seen as inversely related to their degree of linkage with TV, movies and video games.\nFor example, G.I. Joe, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Power Rangers\nare all examples of toys that have cross-feeds with television shows that have violent themes.\nSimilarly, Godzilla, Small Soldiers, Spawn, Jurassic Park and Starship Troopers\ntoys are marketed to children 4 and up.\n\nComputer games or electronic toys are examples of toys that can complement or supplement other play\nactivities. According to author Cathrine Neilsen-Hewett, while often stimulating, engaging and fun, these toys should never become a substitute for traditional play activities such as drawing, pretending, or block building. Instead, electronic games are best thought of as adding to or reinforcing other kinds of play, and are not a suitable replacement for parental\ninteraction and attention.\nClassic toys such as Mr. Potato Head, the Radio\nFlyer wagon and Chutes and Ladders or in a general sense, spanning generations, the teddy bear, stay with a child as he or she develops new interests and matures. They \"stand the test of time\", and evolved can accompany a child into more and more elaborate play when social surroundings, life and a knowledge of history (for example) create diversified and extended ideas.\n\nOrganized toy kingdoms can grow up in the rooms of European children. Named stuffed animals or dolls often occupy lifelong positions of honor, as visualized imaginary friends, in the lifetimes of sociable people with many real friends.\n\nToys have greater play value that promote respectful, non-violent and non-stereotyped interaction \namong children. For example, Barbie is an example of a toy that reinforces gender stereotypes for girls\ndespite its status as a classic toy.\n\nPlay value from a child development perspective is enhanced by toys and games that help children develop skills useful\nfor further learning and mastery such as Scrabble and The Game of Life In playwork terms - play value is the individual child's subjective assessment of the space and the equipment available to them, rather than a pre-conceived adult idea about what sorts of play are 'valuable'. 'Play value' and 'the value of play' are two separate judgements in playwork - the former chiefly made by children, and the latter chiefly made by adults.\n\nGeneral\n\n"}

The musical is based on Sendak's books \"Chicken Soup with Rice\", \"Pierre\", \"One was Johnny\", \"Alligators All Around\" (which compose 1962's \"The Nutshell Library\"), and \"The Sign on Rosie's Door\" (1960). Sendak based the story on a demonstrative little girl who used to sing and dance on the stoop of her building, whom he observed while he was a little boy growing up in Brooklyn.\n\nThe musical has become a mainstay of children's theater groups. It follows a typical summer day in the life of the Nutshell Kids, a group of several neighborhood friends, including Pierre, Alligator, Johnny, and Chef Jeff (also known as \"Chicken Soup\") from the \"Nutshell Library\" books, and Rosie and Kathy from \"The Sign on Rosie's Door\". Rosie, the self-proclaimed sassiest kid on her block of Brooklyn's Avenue P, entertains everyone by directing and starring in a movie based on the exciting, dramatic, funny (and slightly exaggerated) story of her life. During its off-Broadway run, the lead role of Rosie was first played by a then-12-year-old Tisha Campbell-Martin. Midway through the run, Tisha left the cast and was replaced by cast member and \"Rosie\" understudy Angela Coin, age 10. Angela also sang the role of \"Rosie\" on the cast recording. \n\nA half-hour animated television special aired on CBS TV in February 1975. It was directed by Maurice Sendak, with Carole King voicing the title character. King was ultimately selected as the voice of Rosie when casting directors had difficulty selecting a child actor whose voice could compliment the pre-recorded songs. An album based on the songs by King and lyrics by Sendak is available on Ode/Epic/SME Records. In the animated special, only the first seven songs and \"Really Rosie (Reprise)\" were showcased. Sendak expanded the piece for London and Washington, DC, stage productions in 1978, and an off-Broadway production, directed and choreographed by Patricia Birch with designs by Sendak, which opened on October 14, 1980, at the Westside Theatre, where it ran for 274 performances.\n\nRosie and the Nutshell Kids (Kathy, Johnny, Alligator, Pierre and \"Chicken Soup\") live on the same block on Avenue P in Brooklyn, New York. On a hot July Saturday, the children are bored and need something to do. Rosie imagines herself as a talented star, and decides to produce an imaginary movie musical about her life and in particular the demise of her brother Chicken Soup, to be called \"Did You Hear What Happened to Chicken Soup?\"\n\nShe gets her friends to audition for a role in the film, but they begin to fight over casting. A thunderstorm forces them to move into the cellar for shelter. To keep the kids' attention, Rosie decides that they need to show the producer the movie's big finale number. She gets them all to close their eyes and imagine the producer inviting them to make her movie. Afterward, when the children go home, Rosie remains to dream of stardom in her big number.\n\n\nLyrics by Maurice Sendak, music by Carole King.\n\n\n\nMaurice Sendak (1928-2012) \n\nJennings, Coleman A. and Maurice Sendak. \"Theater for Young Audiences: 20 Great Plays For Children\", New York: St. Martin's Press/Macmillan, 2005 \n\n"}

It was released in October 2008 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and ported to Microsoft Windows in early 2009, and to Linux in 2016. A mobile tie-in version was developed by G5 Entertainment and released the same month. The game is the second title and first cross-platform release in the \"Saints Row\" series, following 2006's \"Saints Row\". It is succeeded by 2011's \"\" and 2013's \"Saints Row IV\".\n\nSet in the fictional city of Stilwater five years after the events of \"Saints Row\", players control the same protagonist and lead a new order of Third Street Saints gang against the three rival gangs occupying their turf and the corrupt Ultor Corporation conglomerate. Players navigate the open world and unlock missions by spending Respect, a currency earned by completing numerous off-mission activities. Two players can cooperatively progress through the game's story mode and participate in all activities. The player may also compete in 12-player deathmatches.\n\nThe developers opted for a more comedic tone to set the game apart from \"Grand Theft Auto\", a series featuring common gameplay elements. The game's promotional effort included various public showings, special editions and downloadable content including the \"\" and \"\" mission packages. Reviews were largely favorable, praising the action and straightforward gameplay, while criticizing technical issues. Reviewers were less receptive to the Windows port, citing worse technical issues.

The player's character is capable of maneuvering through the environment, utilizing weaponry and engaging in melee combat warfare. After successfully completing the first game mission, the player is able to explore the environment and choose how they wish to play the game. Missions are unlocked by earning 'respect' points from minigames and side-missions and although completing missions is necessary for game progression, players can complete them at their own leisure. The player is granted the option of instantly retrying the missions should they fail an attempt. Numerous checkpoints save progress in each mission, and missions can be replayed from locations within the environment. Aside from attempting missions, the player can explore the environment, purchase items at shops and participate in the aforementioned mini-games and side-missions. The player can also wreak havoc upon the environment which can provoke potentially fatal attention from authoritative forces. The player can recruit members from a friendly gang and use a mobile phone to contact friends and/or businesses, as well as to input cheat codes.

Players purchase clothes, tattoos and piercings, and set outfits can be bought or created and saved to the player character's wardrobe. \"Cribs\" (safe houses) allow players to withdraw earnings, change outfits, replay missions and save the game. Cribs can be customized by applying themes and purchasing objects like TVs and pool tables. Boats and fixed-wing aircraft can be stored at purchased docks and hangars. Players select the outfits, vehicles, gestures and graffiti styles used by street members of the Third Street Saints.\n\nThe combat systems from \"Saints Row\" have been updated but many of the basics remain unchanged. While engaging in melee-based combat, the player character will perform combos and charge up attacks, and can execute a finishing move if three consecutive hits are dealt. With a gun equipped, the player can perform a groin attack, and can zoom in for a finer aim reticle. The player can also employ the use of human shields, and can use makeshift weapons pulled from the environment e.g. fire hydrants, cement blocks. Should the player either commit illegal activities or incite rival gang members, they will provoke potentially fatal attention from authoritative figures or rival gangs. The notoriety bar is a visual representation of the proactivity of the opposing figures' response and continual inciting of these groups will bring about a more powerful response, such as SWAT teams from the police. The player will continue to be chased by these groups until captured or killed and must reduce the notoriety bar by either hiding from the police or gang and wait for it to \"cool off\", or by seeking out a drive-through confessional which will clear the notoriety bar for a small fee. Should the player character be apprehended or killed, a small percentage of the player's earnings will be removed and the player will respawn at law or healthcare institutions. The game contains over forty different weapons, many of which have been recycled from \"Saints Row\". The game allows the player to utilise new weapon types, examples of which include satchel charges, laser-guided rocket launchers, chainsaws and more. The player has the ability to dual wield handguns and submachine guns. Weaponry can be purchased by the player from specific stores or unlocked throughout in-game progress.\n\nPlayers navigate the open world, fictional city of Stilwater. The city consists of forty-five neighborhoods divided between twenty districts. It is expanded from \"Saints Row\"'s version of Stilwater, roughly one-and-a-half times as big and featuring new districts such as the prison, nuclear power plant, and expanded airport among others. Game developers stated that the city has very much been redeveloped and each individual neighborhood has been touched up in one way or another. According to the storyline, the in-game corporation Ultor spent more than three-hundred million dollars redeveloping the city, funding the police force and, as it states, turning the \"once crime-ridden third-tier city\" into an \"urban utopia\". The Saints Row district is a more notable change within the city, having been completely redesigned and serving as the location of Ultor's headquarters; a towering skyscraper referred to as the Phillips Building. Many old districts from the earlier revision of Stilwater have also seen changes. Examples include the expansion taken place on the Suburbs district, which is double the size of its depiction in \"Saints Row\" and the Museum district, which features the Eramenos Ancient Greek museum exhibit, complete with models of the Acropolis of Athens and Theatre of Dionysus. There are also several completely new districts, such as the Marina and the University.\n\nFrom the beginning of the game, the map of Stilwater is fully visible. However, shops and activities will simply be displayed as a question mark until the player discovers them. By completing missions and wiping out enemy strongholds the player gains control of the various neighborhoods the city is split into. There are over 130 interiors within the city, and hidden events can be triggered by some, including over ninety shops which can be purchased when the player controls each shops' associated territory. The player gets a 10% discount at owned stores and buying an entire chain of departments will mean that the protagonist's face appears on in-game billboard advertisements. The game shares technology with that of \"\", another Volition-developed game and so certain elements of the environment are fully destructible. A number of Easter eggs are placed within the sandbox, including the pop-out Easter Bunny which won \"Top Easter Egg of 2008\".\n\nThe Respect system is a scoring system where the player earns Respect points to unlock missions and progress through the storyline. The player can partake in storyline and stronghold missions only after filling up at least one bar of Respect, and Respect points are removed when the player starts a mission. The 'style rank' is a modifier of how much Respect the player can earn; this is increased by purchasing items for the player character. Respect points can be earned in two ways; by progressing through side-missions called Activities and by completing mini-games and stunts called Diversions.\n\nThere are a broad range of Activities and Diversions available for the player to progress through. Many of the game's Activities made appearance in \"Saints Row\" and a variety of new Activities have also been introduced in the game. Examples include an underground fight club, a parody of the \"Cops\" television show known as FUZZ and numerous others. Each Activity can be initiated from various locations and plays out over six levels of increasing difficulty. The Activities have been designed to suit solo and co-operative play. Most Diversions do not have specific start points. There are numerous Diversions playable in the game, such as acts of indecent exposure, combat and driving stunts, car surfing and a survival horror minigame called Zombie Uprising.\n\n\"Saints Row 2\" has various multiplayer components implemented throughout the game. Through an online network or through System Linking, the player can progress through the game with a cooperative partner. While in co-op mode, both players can explore the city and progress through the game's storyline missions and minigames. Both players are rewarded and credited for completion of such activities, and the players can furthermore play against each other in competitive metagames. The co-op mode is \"drop-in/drop-out\" and there is no limit as to how far the players can be away from each other.\n\nThe game contains competitive multiplayer modes, supporting between four and twelve players in a match. There are two standard deathmatch modes; the free-for-all \"Gangsta Brawl\" mode and its team-based variant, \"Team Gangsta Brawl\". Another mode, known as \"Strong Arm\", puts two teams against each other fighting for control over the neighborhood. In \"Strong Arm\", the first team to earn $100,000,000 dollars wins and money is earned by competing head-to-head in activities, controlling \"tag spots\" which serve as bonus modifiers or by eliminating members of the opposing team. While in a party, players are free to roam around a lobby. The player can rank up in multiplayer and displays this by earning various \"badges\" which are displayed next to the player's name. By ranking up, the player can unlock more expensive clothing for their multiplayer character.\n\nThe multiplayer mode on PC and PlayStation 3 was discontinued in May 2014 when GameSpy's servers were shut down. However, the PC version's multiplayer can still be played via LAN tunneling software such as Evolve or Tunngle and the PS3 version's multiplayer can still be played using XLink Kai. The Xbox 360 versions of the game were unaffected as they use Xbox Live for matchmaking.\n\nIt has been five years since the events of the original \"Saints Row\". Following the sudden disappearance of founder Julius Little, the 3rd Street Saints fell apart. In its place, three new gangs divide up Stilwater: the Brotherhood, an outlaw gang specializing in arms trafficking, the Ronin, a Japanese \"bosozoku\" gang that runs a network of casinos, porn distribution rings and strip clubs, and the Sons of Samedi, a Haitian voodoo gang that supplies most of the city's drugs. Johnny Gat, Julius's former chief lieutenant, is charged with 387 counts of murder and faces the death penalty. His girlfriend Aisha, despite having been forced to fake her death in the previous game, has become a record producer in her own right. After an earthquake leveled Stilwater, the Ultor Corporation bought up most of the land and converted it into a massive financial district run as their own personal fiefdom. The other remaining Saints have abandoned the gang; Dexter Jackson is now a security consultant for Ultor, and Troy Bradshaw, who was responsible for Julius's downfall, has been named the new Chief of Police.\n\nAfter the explosion on Alderman Richard Hughes' yacht, the player fell into a coma and was taken to Stilwater's maximum security prison to undergo extensive plastic surgery. Five years later, Carlos Mendoza, the brother of a former Saint, infiltrates the infirmary and helps the player escape. After arriving at the city, the player is informed by Carlos about the demise of the 3rd Street Saints; Julius went missing, Troy Bradshaw became the Chief of Police, and many Saints members were either killed or jailed. After arriving at a bar, the player discovers that Johnny Gat is on trial for 387 murders and looks set for death row. The player breaks into the courtroom and rescues Johnny, taking him to Aisha's house, where they discuss on how to revive the Saints. After learning that the church was turned into a tourist trap, the player and Johnny take over an underground mission and establish as their new headquarters, and soon recruit high-ranking lieutenants for the Saints in Carlos, Pierce Washington and Shaundi. The player then officially becomes the new leader of the Saints and is then referred to as \"the Boss\" by the rest of the gang.\n\nMaero, the leader of the Brotherhood, calls a meeting with Carlos and the Boss. The Brotherhood and The Saints's meeting is interrupted by cops. After escaping the police, they go back to The Brotherhood's headquarters. Aware that the Saints have very little influence left, he offers to give them 20% of Stilwater while The Brotherhood gets 80%. Insulted, the Saints refuse and declare war on the Brotherhood. With the help of Donnie, a former Westside Rollerz member who now works as Maero's head mechanic, the Boss blows up several of the Brotherhood's prize trucks and laces Maero's private supply of tattoo ink with toxic waste, leaving him with severe facial burns. As revenge, the Brotherhood kidnaps Carlos and drags him through the streets tied to a moving vehicle. With his injuries too severe for medical treatment, Carlos begs for the Boss to put him out of his misery, which the Boss sadly does so by shooting Carlos in the head while holding his hand. Furious at Maero for causing Carlos's death, the Saints abduct his girlfriend Jessica at a bank and lock her in the trunk of a car which is then destroyed by Maero during a Brotherhood-sponsored demolition derby, crushing her to death. With most of his remaining allies locked up, an enraged Maero forces Ultor CEO Dane Vogel to pressure Troy Bradshaw to release them. However, The Boss blows up the prison buses and prison boats before they reach their destination. Vogel orders his company's security forces to confiscate a Brotherhood weapons shipment as \"compensation\", but the Saints steal it first. Using the stolen weapons, the gang lays waste to the Brotherhood's dockside headquarters. While there, The Boss kills Matt, Maero's personal tattoo artist, for helping Maero escape. Maero calls the Boss to the Ultor Dome, where he and his surviving thugs plan to kill him/her in a demolition derby. The Boss then kills them before confronting the dying Maero. Before Maero can finish his last words, the Boss shoots him in the head, killing him and putting an end to the Brotherhood.\n\nWorking alongside Shaundi, the Boss moves to take down The Sons Of Samedi by killing their dealers and destroying their drug farms and labs. DJ Veteran Child, Shaundi's ex-boyfriend and a Sons Of Samedi lieutenant, has her kidnapped and brought to his club, where the Boss confronts and kills him. The General, the founder of The Sons of Samedi, arranges for the Boss to be drugged while his men assault the Saints at their base. Despite being severely intoxicated, the Boss rallies the Saints to fight off the attackers. Mr. Sunshine, the creator of the gang's product, is killed by the Boss whilst attempting to defend his manufacturing plant from a Saints raid. Unable to locate the General, Shaundi and the Boss pose as repair workers and hack the police station's street surveillance cameras to find him. Finally, the Saints organize an ambush of the General's motorcade, eventually tracking down and killing the General in the Stilwater Mall.\n\nTo get the Ronin's attention, Pierce, Gat, and the Boss rob their most profitable casino. Fearing disgrace, their leader, Shogo Akuji, orders his enforcer Jyunichi to use Aisha to lure Gat into a trap, which results in Aisha being decapitated and Gat getting severely wounded after losing a katana duel with Jyunichi. After killing Jyunichi in a fight at a restaurant and saving Johnny from Ronin hitmen trying to kill him at the hospital, the Boss receives the location of the Ronin's headquarters from Vogel, angered by Shogo's father, Kazuo, cutting all business ties with Ultor. As a last-ditch effort, Shogo leads a group of Ronin to kill Gat at Aisha's funeral. However, Gat and the Boss kill Shogo's men and bury him alive in a coffin as revenge for Aisha's murder. Kazuo, after surviving an attempt on his life at Wardill Airport, orders a direct attack on The Saints, but fails. Mr. Wong, an old ally of the Boss, is subjected to another attack at his heritage festival in a bid to lure The Saints out. After rescuing Mr. Wong, the Boss beats Kazuo in a sword fight and leaves him to die on a burning boat.\n\nMeanwhile, an increasingly power-hungry Vogel plans to destroy the Saints so he can expand Ultor's control over all of Stilwater. When an initial effort to kill The Saints' leadership is foiled by The Boss, the Saints respond by destroying a high-security Ultor lab. The company's board of directors try to rein in Vogel, so he sends their locations to the Boss, which he uses to kill them. Appointing himself chairman, Vogel hosts a press conference to denounce the Saints. Gat and The Boss open fire on the conference, forcing Vogel to retreat into his office. Destroying the building's defenses, the Boss enters and confronts Vogel. Vogel attempts to fool the Boss by claiming the board of directors were behind the attacks, and tries to make a truce with the Boss by saying that they could unite their resources to control the city, but before Vogel manages to finish his sentence, the Boss shoots him in the mouth, sending Vogel flying off the window to his death in the streets below.\n\nAfter conquering Stilwater, the Boss has the option of visiting Stilwater Police Headquarters and listening to 3 wiretap conversations recorded under Bradshaw's authority. According to the recordings, Julius was responsible for planting the bomb on Alderman Hughes' yacht that nearly killed the Boss, believing that doing so would allow him to disband the Saints and retire. The Boss can also contact Dex by phone, in which he offers to set up a meeting at The Saints' old base to discuss turning over Julius. If the player does so, however, Julius appears there instead and it becomes clear that Dex plans to have both of them killed on Ultor's behalf. After Julius and the Boss fight the Ultor Masako units across Stilwater in a car chase, the Boss shoots him in an abandoned amphitheater. Still not forgiving Julius for his betrayal, the Boss becomes adamant to kill him. Julius states that the Saints weren't able to change anything, as they had become no better than the gangs that they had been fighting against. The Boss proclaims that Julius's betrayal did help him with one thing: learning to never act as someone's pawn again and being in charge was the better choice. Despite Julius remarking that the Boss would've died if it weren't for him (mentioning the beginning cutscene of the first game), and saying that they were now even, the Boss shows him no mercy and kills him with a headshot, while remarking \"not really\".\n\nVolition began work on \"Saints Row 2\" in 2005, about a year before \"Saints Row\" was released. The sequel was first announced by THQ's CEO Brian Farrell in a February 2007 conference call, alongside another six franchise continuations for the 2008 fiscal year. Game details began to surface in May 2008 after the first teaser trailer was released and sites like IGN and \"GameSpot\" reported on an early version of the game.\n\nOne of the development team's core goals was to develop an identity for the \"Saints Row\" franchise within the open world genre. The series was known as a \"\"Grand Theft Auto\" clone\" based on its first release's similarities to the open world sandbox game \"Grand Theft Auto III\". Accordingly, \"Saints Row 2\" was compared to the \"Grand Theft Auto \"series' own upcoming sequel, \"Grand Theft Auto IV\". When questioned about the two sequels' close release dates, lead producer Greg Donovan responded that they thought their game could compete, that he saw the \"Grand Theft Auto\" sequel moving \"in a more realistic direction\", and that there was \"room for more than just one game\" in the open world genre as \"a very different experience than what ... other games are looking to do\". The team took an \"over-the-top\" design approach, with cartoonish pastiche and \"wild and outrageous\" gameplay. Many early game elements were considered too crass to be included in the final release.\n\nMany of the original \"Saints Row\" developers continued onto the sequel's team. Thus, the team worked from their lessons learned rather than starting anew. The two games were consequently similar in design. They overhauled the game engine to enhance the sequel's graphics, and added contrast and higher-quality textures to make the city setting of Stilwater more realistic. Visual enhancements were also applied to people, cars, explosions, lighting, shadows, and the weather system. A central design goal was to \"create a world that exists independent of the player\" that featured more realistic non-player characters (NPCs) that would smoke cigarettes, use cellphones, drink coffee, open umbrellas when it rained, and physically interact. The original game's engine could not support proximity NPC interaction like sitting together or cuddling. As the city design finalized late in development, the team laboriously hand-placed 20,000 nodes throughout the game world that trigger NPC actions.\n\nThe \"Saints Row \"series narrative was conceived as a three-part story, with \"Saints Row 2\" as the second of the three. While the developers continued the story of the original game, they sought to accommodate newcomers to the series. The final script had roughly 80,000 lines of dialogue, twice that of \"Saints Row\"'s. The story drew strong cinematic influence from Quentin Tarantino films \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Kill Bill\". While the script was written to follow \"a path of betrayal, revenge and redemption\", the game retains \"Saints Row\"s light humor, with the \"over-the-top, socially distorted\" narrative juxtaposed with dark, gritty moments. \"Saints Row\"'s silent protagonist speaks in \"Saints Row 2\", granting the protagonist more personality and improving the storytelling, according to James Tsai, one of the lead designers. They sought to heavily stylize the game's characters and assign them unique personality traits. The basic character designs followed naturally from the story Volition wanted to tell, but the characters' personalities and mannerisms were mainly a product of the voice acting performances, where the actors had freedom to interpret and develop their characters. The game's voice actors include film and television stars such as Neil Patrick Harris, Michael Dorn, Jay Mohr, Keith David, and Eliza Dushku.\n\nWhile the first game was released as an Xbox 360 exclusive, Volition expanded the sequel's initial development to the PlayStation 3 platform. The platform was successful in Europe, where Volition wished to expand. The port was developed in-house by a team that previously worked on Xbox 360 development. They struggled with the PlayStation 3's Cell architecture. The game was particularly unstable during development, and would crash after several hours of play. Lead producer Greg Donovan blamed their \"failing to take systems and features to completion\" as programmers fought last-minute bugs, artists lacked time to finalize designs, and consequently, playtest versions were not ready until late in the development cycle.\n\nThe game's soundtrack features about 170 licensed tracks accessible across twelve in-game radio stations while driving or at home. Station genres include alternative rock, reggae, hip hop, heavy metal, funk, R&B and 1980s pop, with artists such as Opeth, Duran Duran, Lamb of God, The Used, My Chemical Romance, Avenged Sevenfold, Paramore, Panic! at the Disco and Run-D.M.C. The player can create a custom playlist of the licensed tracks to play on a separate station. Lead audio designer Frank Petreikis's budget for licensed music was double that of the previous game so as to secure more prominent tracks.\n\nVolition extended the game's over-the-top atmosphere and humor into the radio stations via commercials. For example, commercials that promoted Ultor Corporation products served to enhance the player's sense of the corporation's omnipresence in Stilwater. The radio commercials were recorded with voice actors in the same room, rather than apart, so as to maximize their group dynamism. Many of the in-game commercials went through several drafts and the developers found this writing process to be challenging.\n\nPrior to its release, \"Saints Row 2\" was heavily marketed and promoted through Internet and television trailers. Volition also ran several fat contests with series-related paraphernalia as prizes. The game's original release date was delayed for marketing considerations. The game's first trailer, in March 2008, was presented as a tourism promotion about the Ultor Corporation's role in rebuilding Stilwater. A full marketing campaign featuring American film actor Gary Busey began the next month. The \"Street Lessons with Uncle Gary\" video series demonstrated particular aspects of gameplay. Subsequent trailers over the next several months also highlighted gameplay elements, but one made light of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\"'s lack of replay value, and another demonstrated the cooperative mode using characters modeled on the candidates from the 2008 United States presidential election. A redesigned official website and community network was launched in July 2008, and American pornographic actress Tera Patrick was featured in her own marketing campaign for the game.\n\nPromotional contests throughout mid-2008 included \"Pimp Your Crib\" and \"Summer of Bling\". Another competition from THQ and \"WorthPlaying\" gave the winner a trip to a San Francisco \"Saints Row 2\" multiplayer event and published their thoughts online. British fashion label Joystick Junkies ran a T-shirt design competition in September 2008, and the top entry was featured in the game's first downloadable content pack. Another round of \"Summer of Bling\" awarded the shirts as prizes. The \"Trick Your Pack\" tool launched in September let the player create their own game box art. There were also other promotions and give-aways. At conventions, \"Saints Row 2\" appeared at the 2008 E3, THQ Gamer's Day, Comic Con, PAX, GameStop Expo, and Leipzig Games Conventions. The game also promoted itself in the Myspace Music Tour and November 2008, an Australian fundraiser for men's health. In November, THQ signed a deal with Massive Incorporated to include in-game advertisements on their Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 products. In-game and online, players can also find movie posters throughout the city that promote upcoming releases.\n\nThe game was originally scheduled for release in North America on August 26, 2008, but was delayed to October 14 both to add final touches and to launch in a more advantageous release window. The game released in three different \"Collectors Editions\", each with a copy of the game, a poster, a limited edition art book, and several extras. The \"Saints Row 2\" \"Initiation Pack\", exclusive to Australia and New Zealand, included promotional items such as a pizza box and bullet-shaped USB memory stick. The Russia-exclusive \"Gift - Buka Edition\" also included the bullet-shaped USB stick, and the \"Gun Pack\" included a gun-shaped USB stick. A month before the game's release, \"Saints Row 2\" producer Dan Sutton stated in an interview that they \"definitely\" planned to make downloadable content.\n\nIn June 2008, THQ confirmed that a Microsoft Windows port of the game was in development, but it was delayed past the October release date into January. The Windows version includes keyboard and mouse support and the ability to change display settings. It was released in North America on January 5, 2009, in Europe on January 23, and in Australia on February 5.\n\nIn April 2016, Volition released a Linux port of the game.\n\n\"Saints Row 2\" received several downloadable content (DLC) releases, including two episodic expansion packs: \"Ultor Exposed\" and \"Corporate Warfare\".\n\n\"Ultor Exposed\" adds character customization and vehicle options, including \"\"-themed content. The Saints attempt to destroy Ultor and they get help from an Ultor worker, Tera, to expose Ultor's darker side. It also adds multiplayer content, including four online multiplayer maps and a cooperative mode metagame wherein players compete for a cash bonus during story missions by accumulating points from special kill bonuses and property damage. The pack's missions feature American pornographic actress Tera Patrick, who plays a whistleblower and former microbiologist for the Ultor Corporation. Originally slated for release on April 16, 2009, the pack was delayed a week to April 23 so it could be released alongside the demo for Volition-developed game \"Red Faction: Guerrilla\". It was released on April 23, 2009. IGN praised the game's new co-op metagame but criticized its relatively short missions. \"Eurogamer\" gave a negative review and criticized its value proposition.\n\n\"Corporate Warfare\" focuses on the struggle between the 3rd Street Saints and the Ultor Corporation. The pack adds character costume, facial hair, and vehicle options. It also includes three multiplayer maps and another cooperative mode metagame wherein players compete in ranking by performing vehicle stunts. \"Corporate Warfare\" was released via digital download on May 28, 2009.\n\nThe PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 releases of the game received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic, and the Windows release received \"mixed or average\" reviews.\n\nBen \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw of \"The Escapist\" \"Zero Punctuation\" named \"Saints Row 2\" his 2008 game of the year. It was a runner up for GameShark's overall and Xbox 360 games of the year. \"Game Developer\" named Volition in their top 50 developers of the year for their work on the game, and THQ in their top 20 publishers.\n\nThe console version of \"Saints Row 2\" garnered generally positive reviews. The PC version was relatively less well received due to frame rate issues and visual pop-in. 1UP.com gave the game a B, stating that it \"relishes the hedonistic aspects of the open-world genre\", that it has \"plenty of innovation\" and that the \"excellence in the presentation makes the world of Saints [Row] 2 a great introduction for newcomers to open world games\".\n\nEurogamer gave the game a 9/10, stating that it \"is one of the most ridiculous and enjoyable games of the year\". \"Game Informer\" gave the game an 8.75/10, stating that \"in its own silly, b-movie way, it's a damn fun game\" and a \"profately good time\". GameSpot gave the game an 8.0/10, stating that \"from beginning to end, this is one of the most fun urban chaos games out there\" and that it will \"keep you happily creating havoc for a long time\". GameSpy gave the game four and a half stars out of five, stating that it \"offers up a shooting and driving experience that is plenty of fun\" and that it is \"self-consciously funny in its irreverence\" and \"will definitely appeal to much of its audience\".\n\nIGN U.S. gave the game an 8.2/10, stating that \"the core gameplay experience is extremely enjoyable\". IGN AU gave the game an 8/10, stating that it is \"big, dumb fun\". IGN UK gave the game a 7.5/10, stating that it \"demonstrates that there is still plenty of mileage to be eked out of open-world games\" and that \"there's certainly enough here to keep any fans of sandbox violence entertained\".\n\nAmong positive acclaim, some publishers gave the game generally negative reviews. UK magazine \"Edge\" gave the game a 5/10, stating that \"few of the game's details will stick in your mind for long, and its pranky focus means it rarely gives you anything interesting to do with the toys on offer\".\n\nEntertainment Weekly flagged the game as \"racist, misogynistic, crude, cynical, humorless and stupid\" and labelled it the worst game of 2008, despite previously giving the game a B and calling it \"a larcenous good time\".\n\nThe game did not gain a favourable response from New York City officials and police. City spokespersons requested that the game be pulled from shelves upon its release; NYPD union boss Patrick Lynch criticized the game, stating that \"these horrible and violent video games desensitize young people to violence while encouraging depravity, immorality while glorifying criminal behavior\".\n\nJack Thompson, a former lawyer and longtime critic of violent video games, called \"Saints Row 2\" a \"\"Grand Theft Auto\" ripoff\", and said that \"as is true with pornography, as is true with violence, the subsequent products tend to push the envelope even more\". On Tuesday, October 14, 2008, the game's US release date, candidate Leslie Crocker Snyder and others spoke out against the game, surrounded by police union members who support her bid.\n\nGovernor David Paterson signed a bill in July 2008 requiring prominent display of age ratings on video games and mandating parental control on game consoles by 2010.\n\n\"Saints Row 2\" sold approximately 365,000 copies in its first month, outselling \"Dead Space\", which was released the same day. The Xbox 360 version comprised the majority of these sales. The game shipped over two million units by the end of 2008. Still, analyst Doug Creutz reported that the game's sales to this point were well below expectations. Following \"Saints Row 2\"'s January 2009 Windows release, the game had shipped over 2.6 million copies by the next month. In May 2009, THQ reported a $431 million loss in revenue, but \"Saints Row 2\" sales totaled 2.8 million. Combined with the original release, the series had worldwide sales in excess of six million, making it one of the best-selling video game franchises.\n\nAs of September 2010, \"Saints Row 2\" has sold over 6.5 million units worldwide. The game's success led THQ to shift its focus to large franchises.\n\n"}
{"id": "58150403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58150403", "title": "Seder-Masochism", "text": "Seder-Masochism\n\nSeder-Masochism is a 2018 American animated musical comedy-drama film written, directed, produced and animated by American artist Nina Paley. The film reinterprets Hebrew Bible events from the \"Book of Exodus\", especially stories associated with the Passover Seder, such as the death of the Egyptian first-born, and Moses leading the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt. The film depicts these events against a backdrop of widespread worship of the Great Mother Goddess, showing the rise of patriarchy.\n\n\"Seder-Masochim\" is Paley's second feature film, following \"Sita Sings the Blues\" in 2008, an animated film loosely based on the \"Ramayana\". In a similar fashion to her previous work, Paley mainly uses previously published music in \"Seder-Masochism\", with popular and liturgical songs ranging from 1928 to 2018. She also draws from spoken voice recordings she made in 2011 with her father, Hiram Paley, who is placed in the role of the traditional Hebrew deity. Greg Sextro served as sound designer on the film.\n\nWith Theodore Gray, Paley formed PaleGray Labs to create a method for animating embroidery, which they call \"embroidermation\". In \"Seder-Masochism\", embroidered animation is the basis for one scene: \"Chad Gadya\". \n\nDebuting in the 2018 film festival season, \"Seder-Masochism\" was reviewed positively, with Paley's bright and satirical style compared to Monty Python and others. The film earned the Audience Award at the ANIMATOR film festival in Poland.\n\nThe \"Book of Exodus\" is retold by Moses, his brother Aharon, the Angel of Death, Jesus, and the traditional Hebrew God. The ancient mother goddess is cast in a \"tragic struggle\" against the new patriarchy.\n\n\nAfter \"Sita Sings the Blues\", Paley was criticized by some observers for co-opting the culture of India as an outsider, an assertion with which she strongly disagreed. A recurring theme among the negative comments was \"how would you like it if people made a film about your religion?\" Paley thought that she would enjoy watching any such film. Accepting this as a challenge, she turned to her own Jewish cultural heritage for her next project: a revisionist retelling of the story of Passover. She pored over the Book of Exodus, finding details that were not part of modern Jewish culture, for instance that Moses's brother Aharon performed some of the acts that are commonly attributed to Moses, and that the Jews were killing each other during their 40 years \"wandering\" in the desert. For inspiration, she also read \"The Creation of Patriarchy\" by Gerda Lerner, and \"The Language of the Goddess\" by Marija Gimbutas. She concluded that the Book of Exodus represents the final defeat of goddess worship by the patriarchy that had been rising since the agricultural revolution.\nIn 2011, Paley interviewed her terminally ill father, Hiram, intending that his voice would serve as the old bearded god figure of the Israelites. For herself, she chose to play the part of a sacrificial goat, because animal sacrifice was essential to many early religions, and because she has been seen as the black sheep of her family. Hiram Paley died in 2012 at the age of 78. Even though her father was a Jewish atheist, the Paley family had celebrated Passover every year so that the children would know their cultural identity. Paley, also a Jewish atheist, weaves the voice recordings of her father into the film as a way to understand the Passover story.\n\nIn September 2011, Paley initiated a Kickstarter crowd-funding effort to raise money for \"Phase I\" of the film, with a goal of $3,600. The campaign brought in $4,146. The intent of Phase I was to make recordings of various family Passover Seder discussions. Ultimately, the project took another direction, and the recordings were not used in the film.\n\nPaley worked on the project over the course of six years, spending about three-and-a-half years animating and producing it. First, she animated some musical numbers – \"This Land Is Mine\" and \"Moses-Exodus\" – using Macromedia Flash 8 running on a first-generation Mac Pro tower, but this was not powerful enough to edit 4K resolution video in a practical manner. In 2013, she shifted the project to a second-generation Mac Pro, the vertical cylinder model, and settled on the applicaton Anime Studio Pro. Paley initially found the Anime Studio Pro interface to be frustratingly complex, so she hosted Chilean animator Victor Paredes at her workspace for a week in 2014 to better learn the software. In 2016, Anime Studio Pro became Moho Pro, with an upgraded version. Paley said that it was not until 2017 that she could express herself easily in Moho Pro.\nIn November 2017, Paley wrote that much of the project had been completed without a \"coherent story\", despite the attempt to tie it together in the loose form of a Passover Seder. She decided instead \"to articulate the Exodus from the Goddesses' point of view\", the goddesses who were at that time worshiped in Egypt as Hathor, Isis, Nut, Sekhmet, and others. This turned her film into a narrative \"about patriarchy and the suppression of the Goddess\".\n\nAfter showing rough cuts of the new concept to friends, Paley decided to bring more goddess images into the film. In late 2017/early 2018, she imported high resolution photos of ancient goddess figurines into the graphics editor GIMP to remove backgrounds, then she exported the resulting PNG files to Moho. In Moho, Paley assigned \"little skeleton\" points on the images to establish how the goddess figurines could bend, and she created additional layers for smaller movements such as eye blinks and smiling/frowning. She offered these individual goddess animations for free on her blog. Among the goddess figurines appearing in the film are the Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük (6,000 BC, Turkey), the Venus of Willendorf (30,000 BC, Austria), and the Venus of Hohle Fels (35,000 BC, Germany).\n\nThe final assembly and editing of the film was performed on Final Cut Pro X, which Paley said was \"horrible\" in its interface but powerful in its processing of 4K video: 3840×2160 pixels. In all, Paley estimated the film's final budget at $20,000.\n\nPaley teamed with science writer and programmer Theodore Gray to develop \"embroidermation\": an automated method of animating embroidery. In 2015 after working for a year and a half, the PaleGray Labs team produced a Passover-themed animated short, \"Chad Gadya\", intended to serve as intermission for \"Seder-Masochism\". Paley created animated figures in Macromedia Flash 8, then Gray imported the resulting vector files into Wolfram Mathematica, a powerful visualization program which he co-created. The figures were rendered as polygons in Mathematica, then a custom application was written to properly align the embroidery stitch direction, different for each polygon. Using an embroidery machine, a total of 516 embroidered figures was stitched into 86 matzoh covers (decorative cloths for holding matzoh during Passover), then each completed figure was photographed to create one frame of animation. The \"Chad Gadya\" scene runs just under 3 minutes, accompanied by the childrens' Passover song, \"Chad Gadya\", sung by Moishe Oysher and recorded in the 1950s.\n\nWhen the film was complete, Paley determined to wait until it had been screened at film festivals before she offered the film for free online in the same manner as \"Sita Sings the Blues\". Earlier, she uploaded some scenes-in-progress to Vimeo and YouTube, including the opening \"God-Mother\" number in 2017, and \"Death of the Firstborn Egyptians\" in 2014, the latter gaining 1.9 million views by August 2018. The scene \"This Land Is Mine\" was first posted in 2012, and by 2014 had received 10 million views, with more viewers added during every news cycle highlighting the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.\n\nFollowing the June 2018 showing at Annecy International Animated Film Festival, the \"Hollywood Reporter\" wrote that the film was \"completely irreverent, occasionally hilarious and politically evocative\", and that it \"defies definition\" with its different aspects of musical comedy, psychedelic cartoon, and \"insolent\" religious epic. Paley is observed to have \"lots of fun\" turning Bible events \"into Busby Berkeley-style song-and-dance numbers.\" Spain's \"El Mundo\" newspaper compared the film's irony and apparent naïveté to works by the Marx Brothers, Italian playwright Dario Fo, and Monty Python, writing that Paley applies unprejudiced and sharp commentary to the Jewish story while remaining bright and ridiculous. French film website \"Courte-Focale\" compared \"Seder-Masochism\" to \"Monty Python's Life of Brian\", writing that Paley brought a \"fiercely humorous\" spirit to the task of attacking patriarchal religion, an attack carried out with \"acuteness and precision\" in a way that disarms her opponents and yields a hilarious result. Greek animator Vassilis Kroustallis said that Paley's second film \"is another bold attempt... to associate the catastrophe that religion may bring with the male ego.\" He wrote that the musical choreography is good but the editing suffers from the juxtaposition of different scenes.\n\nIn Poznań, Poland, at the ANIMATOR film festival, \"Seder-Masochism\" earned the Audience Award for Feature Film.\n\nPaley spent $70,000 to secure the music rights to \"Sita Sings the Blues\", just to distribute it freely, so for \"Seder-Masochism\" she turned to the parody defense in fair use: a parody of a copyrighted work can be considered fair use. As a result, she did not try to secure the rights to the many recordings she used in the film. She told \"Variety\" that anyone who is interested can perform the legal work to clear the music rights, after which that person or corporation will be able to distribute the film commercially, or license it for distribution.\n\nThe song \"This Land Is Mine\" came first in Paley's production process; she used it to frame a scene in which a succession of warring men claims the Holy Land as theirs. The music is the main theme of the 1960 film \"Exodus\", composed by Austrian Ernest Gold, with words added later by Pat Boone, which he sang and released as a single titled \"The Exodus Song\". Boone, an American Christian, said he wrote the lyrics in 25 minutes on Christmas Eve, on the back of a Christmas card, which he later sent to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem. The version Paley used in \"Seder-Masochism\" is a cover by Boone's friend Andy Williams, released in 1962 under the title \"The Exodus Song (This Land Is Mine)\", as part of his album \"Moon River and Other Great Movie Themes\", the album reaching number 3 on the \"Billboard\" Top 200, selling more than two million copies by 1967. In the 1960s, the song became a Zionist anthem. Paley parodies the song's Zionist theme to show the senselessness of war in the Middle East: the scene ends in atomic destruction, with nobody winning except the Angel of Death.\n\nPaley commissioned a song for the film from New York-based rock musician Todd Michaelsen, who had earlier collaborated on a song for \"Sita Sings the Blues\", but Paley eventually decided not to use Michaelsen's song. She said that she prefers \"songs that have a different original meaning\", so that her animation adds a second meaning, yielding greater depth.\n\nFor her dancing goddesses number, animated in early 2018, Paley chose a song from the 1976 film \"Car Wash\": \"You Gotta Believe\", written by Norman Whitfield and performed by the Pointer Sisters. In \"Car Wash\", Paley said the song is used to \"urge activist men to stand up for their activist sisters\", but in \"Seder-Masochism\" it is an ultimately unsuccessful plea to Moses to embrace goddess worship.\n\nThe following recordings appear in the film credits:\n\n\n"}

Original \"tegata\" are given out to fans and members of one's supporter club. Printed copies of \"tegata\" can also be bought inexpensively.\n\nWhen a wrestler achieves \"sekitori\" status, he is allowed to have a fan/supporter club called a \"kōenkai\" if he has enough popularity. This is in addition to \"kōenkai\" associated with his sumo stable. These clubs often pool their money to buy the wrestler such items as his decorative apron called a \"keshō-mawashi\".

Rizzo is a member of the National Speakers Association (NSA) and an inductee of its \"Council of Peers Award for Excellence\" (CPAE) Speaker Hall of Fame. His book, \"Becoming a Humor Being: The Power to Choose a Better Way\" won the Writer's Digest International Self-Published Book Awards.\n\nSteve Rizzo is a native of Brooklyn in New York City. While growing up, \"Rizzo was [once] told by a [high school] guidance counselor that he didn't have the intelligence for college.\" He went on to study at the Long Island University C. W. Post Campus, earning a Bachelor of Arts in English and Education (with Honors) and Master of Arts in Theater Arts.\n\nRizzo was once an English teacher for the 7th and 8th grade students at West Babylon Junior High School in West Babylon, New York, and counselor to students with behavioral problems in the 9th to 12th grades. He later became a comedian, and was roommate to Drew Carey, had Dennis Miller and Rosie O'Donnell open shows for him and shared the stage with Eddie Murphy, Rodney Dangerfield, Jerry Seinfeld and Ellen DeGeneres before moving on to become a motivational speaker. Rizzo left a promising career of over 18 years in stand-up comedy to pursue a new career in motivational speaking; he became a professional speaker in 1994.\n\nAs a stand-up comic, Rizzo performed at various comedy clubs, including the Pittsburgh Comedy Club in Dormont and the Improv. He also was featured in many television comedy shows, including An Evening at the Improv, Showtime Special, The Comedy Channel and Fox TV's \"Comic Strip Live\". In \"The Pittsburgh Press\" of June 2, 1983, Lenny Litman described Rizzo's comedy style as \"whip-cracking satire cushioned with warm and funny stories.\"\n\nWhile Rizzo was transitioning from being a stand-up comedian to a motivational speaker, after one of his shows at a New Jersey comedy club, he met Al Parinello, president of the National Speakers Association (NSA)—New Jersey chapter, he encouraged Rizzo to attend a workshop of the National Speakers Association. After the workshop, Rizzo was asked to present \"How to Add Humor to Your Presentations\" at a national convention of the National Speakers Association. At this transitioning period, Rizzo also met Nancy Lauterbach, the founder of Five Star Speakers and Trainers after a show in Orlando, Florida, and according to Kelli Vrla in \"Speaker\" (a publication of National Speakers Association) of September 2010, \"she took him under her wing and helped him structure his presentation. In his first showcase, Rizzo ranked dead last out of 23 speakers because he tried to sound like a \"serious motivational speaker.\" He soon realized his humor was the key to his authenticity. \"I was light years ahead of many professional speakers because I had command of an audience,\" Rizzo says. When Rizzo incorporated humor in his next showcase, buyers immediately hired him. He signed an exclusive agreement with Five Star, and his speaking business took off. Rizzo credits Lauterbach with helping him establish a foothold in his new career.\"\n\nRizzo had a PBS Special which he created by himself, and he was also the executive producer. In an article published on December 08, 2006 by Oprah Radio (via Oprah.com), Mehmet Oz wrote that \"Steve Rizzo is the author of \"Becoming a Humor Being\", and the creator and executive producer of his own nationally syndicated PBS special. After doing stand-up comedy for many years, Steve transitioned to being a professional humorist speaker.\" A publication by McGraw-Hill (introducing Rizzo's book, \"Get Your SHIFT Together: How to Think, Laugh, and Enjoy Your Way to Success in Business and in Life\") says, \"[Rizzo reaches] well over 50,000 people a year through his talks and weekly Rizzo-Gram e-mails.\"\n\nRizzo was featured on MSNBC and Oprah and Friends radio network as a consultant. In the introduction of Rizzo's book, \"Get Your SHIFT Together: How to Think, Laugh, and Enjoy Your Way to Success in Business and in Life\", published on the website of McGraw-Hill, Rizzo is described as \"\"The Attitude Adjuster\", is a personal development expert whose clients include American Airlines, BP, JPMorgan Chase, Scholastic, and Sprint, among others. As a standup comic, he has headlined with many titans of comedy, including Jerry Seinfeld, Eddie Murphy, Drew Carey, and Ellen DeGeneres.\"\n\nAt a National Association of Trailer Manufacturers (NATM)'s event in 2002, Rizzo was a keynote speaker. While addressing the members of the association on \"How to be a Humor Being\", he described himself as a \"Professional Humor Being (PhB)\". Rizzo was also a speaker at ISPA EXPO 2006, where he \"kept his [International Sleep Products Association] audience laughing while they learned how to deal with every-day stressors and embrace change in their lives during the ISPA Industry Breakfast.\" At the \"Community Leaders Breakfast\" at the Decatur Confenrence Center and Hotel in Decatur, Illinois in 2008, \"Rizzo spoke of the benefits of unleashing your \"humor being\" as a way to bring out the best in yourself during trying times.\" Rizzo was also a speaker at \"Surf Summit 13\", an event organized jointly by the Surf Industry Manufacturers Association (SIMA) and the Board Retailers Association (BRA), which was held in Los Cabos, Mexico in 2010; he made a presentation on \"The Atti-Tools for Success\".\n\nRizzo has written some notable inspirational books, including:\nIn the description of Rizzo's book, \"Get Your SHIFT Together: How to Think, Laugh, and Enjoy Your Way to Success in Business and in Life\", published on the website of McGraw-Hill, Mehmet Oz is quoted to have said that \"Through shifting your focus and way of thinking, Steve Rizzo shows how to succeed on all levels of life, while actually enjoying the process.

One of the greatest issues with the Russian video games industry is piracy.\n\nRussia has officially recognized competitive video gaming (known as “eSports,” or “computer sports” in Russian) as a sport.\n\nHistory of mass videogaming in Russia (back then USSR) takes its roots in the early 1980s when personal computers of different models (Atari 400/800, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum 48/128) were brought to the country from United States, Europe, Japan and China. At the same time, a local company, Electronica, released a series of portable game consoles which were mostly clones of Nintendo products. By the middle of the 80s Soviet programmers and enthusiasts began to try to develop their own games. The most famous Russian game designer of that era is Alexey Pajitnov who created the worldwide megahit \"Tetris\".\n\nThe first Soviet arcade game machines did not contain digital graphics, and the games' interface had to be emulated with help of physical objects.\n\nThere were many video game magazines in Russia from the early 90s to the mid 2000s. Their quantity significantly decreased due to the massive spread of the Internet and the following boom of illegal content downloading. As a result, most of the existing magazines were discontinued due to a massive commercial loss. The most known Russian video game magazine is currently Igromania.\n"}

(also known as \"What time is it, Mr Wolf?\", \"Grandma's Footsteps\", \"1 2 3 Piano\" in Belgium and in the United States \"What time is it, Mr. Fox?\") is a form of tag played in Australia, Belgium, Canada, the English-speaking Caribbean, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom.\n\nBecause it needs attention skills, quick reactions, and working memory for the 'it' child, it is recommended by Harvard University's Center on the Developing Child to assist in developing executive function skills for children aged 5 to 7.\n\nOne player is chosen to be Mr Wolf. Mr Wolf stands at the opposite end of the playing field from the other players, facing away from them. A call-and-response then takes place: all players except for Mr Wolf chant in unison \"What's the time, Mr Wolf?\", and Mr Wolf will answer in one of the two ways:\n\n\nIt is not uncommon for Mr Wolf to be allowed to look around at the other players, before answering the question; especially if there is a rule involving penalties applied to Mr Wolf if a player reaches him before \"Dinner time\" is called.\n\nThere is also a simpler version of the game where Mr Wolf faces the other players, who must remain stationary until \"Dinner time\" is called. If any player moves on a time of day being called, that player becomes Mr Wolf.\n\nIn another version, Mr Wolf holds a dandelion seed head and blows on it. The other players dance around him/her, taunting him \"What's the time, Mr Wolf?\" After each blow, Mr Wolf calls out \"1 o'clock\", \"2 o'clock\" etc. until all the seed head has been blown away. Then, he calls out \"Dinner time!\" and chases the other players to tag them before they can claim sanctuary at pre-designated points called \"Bar\". The players claim \"Bar\" by yelling out \"B - A - R Bar\" and touching the safety point. The skill is in deciding when the seed head is going to be completely blown away, as the players cannot run away until this happens. It could happen after one blow by Mr Wolf, or several. The first player tagged becomes Mr Wolf for the next round of the game. \n\nThis game can also be played on a hopscotch court. The players chant \"What's the time Mr Wolf\" and the wolf replies with a time. The players hop that number of spaces forwards on the hopscotch court. If Mr Wolf answers with \"It's dinner time\" the players try to run back to the beginning of the hopscotch court before they are caught by Mr Wolf.\n\nSimilar games include Lupo Delle Ore in Italy, and Captain Midnight in the United States, in which everyone has to start running at midnight. The game also bears some resemblance to Red light, green light and Dahrumasan ga koronda.\n\nAnother variant of this game which has become popular is \"Mr Shark, Mr Shark, what time is it?\" The big difference is that this game is played in a swimming pool, lake, or other swimming area. When Lunch Time is called the player may try running through the water or swimming to get away from the shark.\n\nA variant also exists in which the tagged players become wolves themselves, helping to tag the other players. The original wolf, however, still calls the numbers.\n\nThe variant played in the Low Countries, consists of one player at one end of the playfield with his back to the other players. He then calls out \"1 2 3 piano!\", whilst knocking three times on the wall in front of him. As he calls out, the other players are allowed to move towards him. Once the call is finished, the player quickly turns around. The other players then need to stand as still as possible. If the caller can spot someone moving, he can send that player back to the start. This is repeated until someone is able to tap the caller without being spotted.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
