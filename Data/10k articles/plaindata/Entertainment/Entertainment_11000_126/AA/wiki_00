Reza believed these skills could contribute to the building of a free and open society by supporting sustainable development, promoting human rights, and strengthening national unity. Since its inception, Aina has had a significant impact on civil society in Afghanistan. Over 1,000 women and men have been trained in media and communication skills, with more than 90% now employed using these skills. Eight publications have been produced and are in circulation, including two women's magazines and one children's magazine, Parvaz. In addition, the first documentary called Afghanistan Unveiled, by an all-female production team, produced by Aina, was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2005. An exhibit of AINA trained photographers was shown at The Half King in New York, which is known for exhibiting works of photojournalists.\n\nAina supports the development of media and cultural structures and the production of educational material in a country undergoing reconstruction. In this way, and through the training and cultural learning it provides, Aina contributes to Afghan education and promotes a spirit of peace and freedom, the very foundation of democracy. Aina's cross-disciplinary training program is based on new technologies, introducing participants to the electronic age. It is mainly intended for women and children, whose development has long been neglected in Afghan society. .\n\nAina supports and develops cultural projects and independent local media, all critical tools to rebuild civil society, and also works to establish media and cultural centers.\n\nTraining in new communication technologies is aimed at speeding up the emergence of local Afghan media structures necessary for the nation to join the information and communication society of the 21st century. Aina helps disseminate educational and peace-promoting messages that foster the creation of a civil society by involving local people in carrying out large-scale communication campaigns.\n\nParvaz, the first and only children's magazine in Afghanistan, was launched in August 2002 in Kabul - with the cooperation of major educational institutions and foundations. Parvaz will be reproduced in other parts of the developing world using a name suitable to each country and culture.\n\nThe concept of Parvaz is to be a high-quality, full-color magazine, aimed at becoming the publication of reference for children in developing countries, as well as an educational support tool for teachers and family\n\nThe magazine has been defined around the concepts of creativity, color and friendship. The magazine strives for an equality of the right to knowledge across cultures, generations and genders. Parvaz is a window on the world for children who have grown up in war and poverty. By introducing them to other cultures, ways of life and beliefs, it promotes tolerance. The adults of tomorrow will thus communicate with mutual respect and understanding- instead of violence and fear.\n\nThe content of Parvaz Afghanistan is designed and produced in Kabul by an all Afghan team of journalists, writers, illustrators and photographers who were trained at Aina.\n\nParvaz covers a wide variety of subjects: sciences, geography, music, nature, sports, games, Afghan traditions, history, religion, technology, folk tales and stories.\n\nThrough text, illustrations, photos, exploded diagrams and educational cartoons, Parvaz helps children develop their imagination, their passion for reading, and their ability to observe and analyse.\n\nParvaz is distributed through the networks of most of the national and international organizations that work with children and within education in Afghanistan, including the Ministry of Education.\n\nEach edition of 40,000 copies is read and shared by 500,000 children all over Afghanistan.\n\nThirteen issues have been produced and distributed in Afghanistan.\n\nA version of Parvaz - called Yuti - was launched in Sri Lanka in response to the devastation of the tsunami in 2006.\n\n"}

Occasionally Walthamstow Studios in London were also used. Many of the film's stories were based on plays or popular novels. The company's productions were distributed by Granger Films.\n\nLike many other production outfits the company struggled to survive the downturn in British filmmaking that culminated in the Slump of 1924.

In the modern artform, conductors tend to hoist batons for indicating melodic curves and ornaments.\n\nEarly music (vocal church music), as far back as the 5th century, required some central direction from a leader in the coordination of singers in their delivery of melodic lines of mostly free rhythm. Traced back to early Egyptian performances through hieroglyphic documentation (etchings in stone depicting a leader employing hand signals to indicate pitch and rhythm details for wind instrument players), this form of conducting seems to predate Guido of Arezzo's designation of joints of the fingers for indicating pitches, and seems to have offered more than limited pitch instruction. These early leaders, or \"cheironomers\", though possessing none of the modern conducting skills developed in the 17th century, using a form of choreographed hand signals, adeptly controlled the movement of the melodic lines, producing incredibly well-synchronized performances.\n\nCheironomy, though not a commonly used term in today’s reference to conducting, serves, as it did in early music, as the model for the motions necessary to direct some modern music which require individualized direction to specific players, within less metrically structured musical compositions. It is still in use in the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church (despite a decline of chant in the late twentieth century), of some Middle Eastern sects and in synagogues to direct the singing of liturgical songs (Hebrews probably learned cheironomy from Egyptians), and, more rarely, in some ancient Western religions. \n\nThe \"New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\" comments that the method is particularly developed in traditions\nlacking a written notation, including Vedic, Byzantine and Roman chants.\n\nJewish religious cheironomy can also be found as mnemonic signs in printed Hebrew Bibles, appearing above, below and amidst the text to be sung, in order to guide the cantor in his rendition of Biblical readings: see \"Cantillation\".\n\n"}
{"id": "15191980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15191980", "title": "Cinema of Uruguay", "text": "Cinema of Uruguay\n\nThe cinema of Uruguay has a role in the culture of Uruguay and is a part of Latin American cinema. Since the late 1990s, the Uruguayan cinema undergoes a process of evolution, during which its films have received positive reviews and been internationally recognized. Over 120 films, fictions and non-fictions, have been produced since then.\n\nLouis Lumière's invention was introduced to Uruguayan audiences on July 18, 1898, at the Salón Rouge, a popular local cabaret. Local businessman Félix Oliver purchased Uruguay's first film, camera and projector from the Lumiére brothers themselves; with them he made \"Bicycle Race in the Arroyo Seco Velodrome\", the second film produced in Latin America.\n\nWith his first short film a success, Oliver established the country's first film studio and continued to make documentaries. One of Argentina's first cinematographers, French-born Henri Corbicier, took Uruguayan film in a new direction, however, when he produced \"The Peace of 1904\", a documentary about Uruguay's recent political conflict and its resolution. Corbicier continued to produce newsreels and documentaries for the Uruguayan public for some time and influenced others to do the same.\n\nReceiving most of their commercial films from Argentine studios, Uruguayan audiences saw no domestic fiction film titles until, in 1919, the local non-profit society \"Bonne Garde\" financed \"Pervanche\", directed by León Ibáñez. Unsuccessful, the effort was the country's only one of its type until Juan Antonio Borges' \"Souls on the Coast\". Released in 1923, it is considered to be the first Uruguayan feature film. Its studio, Charrúa Films, produced one more feature film (\"Adventures of a Parisian Girl in Montevideo\") before closing in 1927.\n\nInspiring others, however, this modest beginning led Carlos Alonso to produce \"The Little Hero of Arroyo de Oro\" in 1929; the film, a realist tragedy set in the countryside, was in the vanguard due to its frank and graphic depiction of domestic violence and was the first commercially successful Uruguayan film.\n\nDespite other difficulties, the year 1930 provided Uruguayan film makers an unexpected opportunity when their national football team won that year's World Cup. Justino Zavala Muñiz produced rousing documentaries on the event, which also coincided with the 100th anniversary of the Uruguayan Constitution. His success enabled him to establish the Uruguyan Cine-Club, from where he premiered the acclaimed \"Sky, Water and Sea Lions\", among other documentaries and fiction films.\n\nThe Great Depression, however, soon dampened local film makers' plans and audiences would have to wait until 1936 to see the next locally produced film.\n\nThat year, Ciclolux Studios purchased Uruguay's first equipment for the production of film sound and released Director Juan Etchebehere's \"Two Destinies\". Socially aware, the film is reminiscent of \"Great Expectations\" and was made despite the repressive atmosphere that prevailed in Uruguay during President Gabriel Terra's règime. Beset by censorship, by Argentine film imports and by global instability, local film making remained limited to documentaries, newsreels and lighthearted comedies and musicals.\n\nA joint venture between Argentine and Uruguayan investors, however, resulted in Orión Studios. The studio produced four well-received full-length dramas between 1946 and 1948, and reintroduced local audiences to Uruguayan drama film with Argentine Director Julio Saraceni's version of \"The Three Musketeers\" and Belisario García Villar's version of Italian novelist Luigi Pirandello's \"Come tu me vuoi\". The renewed activity brought Kurt Land to Uruguay, where he made \"The Thief of Dreams\".\n\nThe post-war era continued to bring audiences well-received comedies such as Adolfo Fabregat's \"The Detective Goes the Wrong Way\" (1949) and documentaries such as Enrico Gras' \"Artigas: Protector of Free Peoples\" (1950), although dramatic full-length titles continued to struggle. Documentaries continued to be the local film industry's standby. Miguel Ángel Melino's ode to the Uruguayan independence saga, \"The Arrival of the Thirty-Three Easterners\" (1952) earned him plaudits and a long-term contract with the National Party for campaign film productions.\n\nYears passed with no local drama titles until 1959, when Hugo Ulive made \"A Song for Judas\", a realistic ode to the struggling troubadour. The realist and neorealist film genre found wider acceptance locally and Ulive and others made a number of cultural documentaries and after 1960, films to promote tourism.\n\nThe shifting intellectual discourse in much of the western world during the 1960s influenced Uruguayan culture quickly and extensively. Among film makers, was evidenced by the production of muck-raking titles aimed at encouraging social awareness. Mario Handler's \"Carlos: Portrait of a Montevideo Panhandler\" represented a local form of cinéma vérité that drew on Uruguayan film makers' tradition as documentarians. Increasingly the target of harassment, Handler followed this with studies on student protests such as the unequivocal \"I Like Students\" (1968), \"Líber Arce: Liberation\" (1969) and an ode to a massive local meatpacker strike entitled \"The Uruguayan Beef Shortage of 1969\".\n\nFollowing Handler's exile to Venezuela in 1972 Uruguayan film makers increasingly limited themselves to conventional subjects and, aside from Jorge Fornio and Raúl Quintín's 1973 flop \"Maribel's Peculiar Family\" (the first Uruguayan film produced in color), local full length productions of all types ceased until 1979. In that year, the new dictatorship's public relations office (DINARP) recruited Argentine Director Eva Landeck and Spaghetti western veteran George Hilton to make \"Land of Smoke\", a feature so disliked by the public that it caused the producers' bankruptcy.\n\nThe fiasco became a blessing in disguise, however, when in 1980, the DINARP opted to give Director Eduardo Darino practically free rein over the production of \"Gurí\", a gaucho tale based on Serafín García's homonymous novel. The endearing tale revived the local film industry and drew Hollywood's attention, as well. The following year, Eli Wallach accepted the leading role in a version adapted for American television.\n\nCorrection: GURI was produced by Zenit Intl. US, Eli Wallach participated from day one, and Darino had plans for 3 films produced by Richard Allen with HBO Interest. DINARP requested that Enrique Guarnero play the father role for Uruguay. Darino completed the film but backed off from the other two titles. Robert Miller, Zenit Intl. Production VP.\n\nSimilar conditions enabled Juan Carlos Rodríguez Castro to make \"The Murder of Venancio Flores\" in 1982. Based on events surrounding the assassinations of President Venancio Flores and former President Bernardo Berro in 1868, the film fared meagerly at the local box office; but it earned an honorable mention at the prestigious Huelva Film Festival. The accomplishment, earned during Uruguay's deepest economic crisis since 1930, encouraged Luis Varela to make \"The Winner Takes All\", an indictment of the wave of financial fraud that Uruguay (and much of Latin America) was subject to around 1980.\n\nBeset by a nearly unprecedented socioeconomic crisis, Uruguay's last dictator, Gen. Gregorio Álvarez, called elections for 1984. Initially, the advent of democracy under Julio Sanguinetti could do little for the local film industry economically. However, renewed freedoms encouraged the growth of the Uruguyan video industry (a genre less limited by distribution costs, for instance). Local video producers such as CEMA and Imágenes ushered in the new era with politically controversial titles such as Guillermo Casanova's \"The Dead\", and Carlos Ameglio and Diego Arsuaga's \"The Last Vermicelli\". Other video production houses, such as \"Grupo Hacedor\" touched on social problems, as in the violent \"Fast Life\" (1992) and traditional screen film makers also made their presence felt. For example, César de Ferrari and his documentary \"General Elections\", which focused on the plight of veteran leftist Wilson Ferreira Aldunate and his bannishment from the 1984 elections.\n\nUruguay's economy began to recover despite the weight of foreign debt interest payments. But continuing difficulties led Beatriz Flores Silva to make \"The Almost-True Story of Pepita the Gunslinger\", a drama based on a 1988 incident involving a middle-class lady in dire straits and her audacious assault on a number of Montevideo banks. Released in 1994, the film did well locally and in Spain.\n\nAddressing local film makers' economic difficulties, the city of Montevideo established FONA and the national government, created INA, two funds designed to subsidize local projects that might not otherwise see the light of day. These funds enabled Alejandro Bazzano to make \"Underground\", a futurist 1997 TV pilot. The series, however, was soon canceled. Pablo Rodríguez's \"Gardel: Echoes of Silence\" (about the legendary Tango vocalist) met a similar fate. Despite these, setbacks, the year 1997 ended on a positive note for local film with Alvaro Buela's deceptively simple \"A Way to Dance\" and Diego Arsuaga's film-noir, \"Otario\".\n\nUruguayan Directors pursued increasingly varied subject matter from 1998, including Leonardo Ricagni's surreal \"The Chevrolet\" and Esteban Schroeder's mystery, \"The Vineyard\". Luis Nieto took an Ibsen-esque turn with \"The Memory of Blas Quadra\" (2000), and Pablo Rodríguez lived down his previous disappointment with \"Damned Cocaine\" (2001). Brummell Pommerenck portrayed existential loneliness in \"Call for the Postman\" (2001), Luis Nieto returned to deal with a former extremist back from exile in \"The Southern Star\" (2002) and Pablo Stoll and Juan Pablo Rebella gave an empathetic portrayal of youth in \"25 Watts\" (2002); their dark comedy, \"Whisky\" (2003) earned the Un Certain Regard Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Marcelo Bertalmío's existential \"Noise\" (2005) was well received and won the Audience Award at the Valladolid International Film Festival. Valeria Puig wrote, produced and directed \"Confesiones de un taxista\" (2011) which was a finalist at the Nashville Film Festival.\n\nThe rustic Uruguayan countryside piqued the interest to foreign film makers as well. Swiss Director Bruno Soldini used the rural setting for \"The Brickmasons of Tapes\" a 1989 period piece filmed in Italian. Likewise, local film makers used the same bucolic setting to make two Uruguay/Argentina co-productions: Diego Arsuaga's unyielding \"The Last Train\" (2002) and Guillermo Casanova's sentimental \"Seawards Journey\" (2003).\n\nUruguayan film production continues to make its modest though influential presence felt in the vast array of Latin American films, producing four to six films per year and contributing to other countries' film industries, as well, with talent such as Director Israel Adrián Caetano, who has made a number of acclaimed Argentine films since co-directing \"Pizza, Beer and Smokes\" in 1997.\n\nIn recent years, Uruguay has become an interesting country for locations, experiencing a boom of films and commercials being shot there. A highlight was \"Miami Vice (2006 film)\": the Old City of Montevideo was the set chosen to imitate La Habana Vieja, and Atlántida with its Art Deco buildings gave life to parts of Miami.\n\nIn 2012, the Government of Montevideo published a Location Guide for cinema directors, students and advertising agents.\n\n"}
{"id": "305296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=305296", "title": "Color grading", "text": "Color grading\n\nColor grading is the process of improving the appearance of an image for presentation in different environments on different devices. Various attributes of an image such as contrast, color, saturation, detail, black level, and white point may be enhanced whether for motion pictures, videos, or still images. Color grading and color correction are often used synonymously as terms for this process and can include the generation of artistic color effects through creative blending and composting of different images. Color grading is generally now performed in a digital process either in a controlled environment such as a color suite, or in any location where a computer can be used in dim lighting. \n\nThe earlier photo-chemical film process, now referred to as color timing, was performed at a photographic laboratory by the use of filters and exposure changes while copying from one film to another.\n\nColor timing is used in reproducing film elements. \"Color grading\" was originally a lab term for the process of changing color appearance in film reproduction when going to the answer print or release print in the film reproduction chain. By the late 2010s, this film grading technique had become known as \"color timing\" and still involved changing the duration of exposure through different filters during the film development process. Color timing is specified in printer points which represent presets in a lab contact printer where 7-12 printer points represent one stop of light. The number of points per stop varied based upon negative or print stock and different presets at Film Labs. \n\nIn a film production, the creative team would meet with the “Lab Timer” who would watch a running film and make notes dependent upon the team's directions. After the session, the Timer would return to the Lab, and put the film negative on a device (the Hazeltine) which had preview filters with a controlled backlight, and pick exact settings of each printer point for each scene. These settings were then punched onto a paper tape and fed to the high-speed printer where the negative was exposed through a backlight to a print stock. Filter settings were changed on the fly to match the printer lights that were on the paper tape. For complex work such as visual effects shots, \"wedges” running through combinations of filters were sometimes processed to aid the choice of the correct grading.\n\nThis process is used wherever Film materials are being reproduced.\n\nWith the advent of television, broadcasters quickly realised the limitations of live television broadcasts and they turned to broadcasting feature films from release prints directly from a telecine. This was before 1956 when Ampex introduced the first Quadruplex videotape recorder (VTR) VRX-1000. Live television shows could also be recorded to film and aired at different times in different time zones by filming a video monitor. The heart of this system was the \"kinescope\", a device for recording a television broadcast to film.\n\nThe early telecine hardware was the \"film chain\" for broadcasting from film and utilized a film projector connected to a video camera. As explained by Jay Holben in \"American Cinematographer Magazine\", \"The telecine didn't truly become a viable post-production tool until it was given the ability to perform colour correction on a video signal.\"\n\nIn a Cathode-ray tube (CRT) system, an electron beam is projected at a phosphor-coated envelope, producing a spot of light the size of a single pixel. This beam is then scanned across a film frame from left to right, capturing the \"vertical\" frame information. Horizontal scanning of the frame is then accomplished as the film moves past the CRT's beam. Once this photon beam passes through the film frame, it encounters a series of dichroic mirrors which separate the image into its primary red, green and blue components. From there, each individual beam is reflected onto a photomultiplier tube (PMT) where the photons are converted into an electronic signal to be recorded to tape.\n\nIn a charge-coupled device (CCD) telecine, a white light is shone through the exposed film image onto a prism, which separates the image into the three primary colors, red, green and blue. Each beam of colored light is then projected at a different CCD, one for each color. The CCD converts the light into an electronic signal, and the telecine electronics modulate these into a video signal that can then be color graded.\n\nEarly color correction on Rank Cintel MkIII CRT telecine systems was accomplished by varying the primary gain voltages on each of the three photomultiplier tubes to vary the output of red, green and blue. Further advancements converted much of the color-processing equipment from analog to digital and then, with the next-generation telecine, the Ursa, the coloring process was completely digital in the 4:2:2 color space. The Ursa Gold brought about color grading in the full 4:4:4 color space.\n\nColor correction control systems started with the Rank Cintel TOPSY (Telecine Operations Programming SYstem) in 1978. In 1984 Da Vinci Systems introduced their first color corrector, a computer-controlled interface that would manipulate the color voltages on the Rank Cintel MkIII systems. Since then, technology has improved to give extraordinary power to the digital colorist. Today there are many companies making color correction control interfaces including Da Vinci Systems, Pandora International, Pogle and more.\n\nSome telecines are still in operation in 2018.\n\nSome of the main artistic functions of color correction (digital color grading):\n\n\nNote that some of these functions must be prioritized over others; for example, color grading may be done to ensure that the recorded colors match those of the original scene, whereas other times, the goal may instead be to establish a very artificial stylized look.\n\nTraditionally, color grading was done towards practical goals. For example, in the film Marianne, grading was used so that night scenes could be filmed more cheaply in daylight. Secondary color correction was originally used to establish color continuity, however the trend today is increasingly moving towards creative goals, such as improving the aesthetics of an image, establishing stylized looks, and setting the mood of a scene through color. Due to this trend, some colorists suggest the phrase \"color enhancement\" over \"color correction\".\n\nPrimary color grading affects the whole image by providing control over the color density curves of red, green, blue color channels, across the entire frame. Secondary correction can isolate a range of hue, saturation and brightness values to bring about alterations in hue, saturation and luminance only in that range, allowing the grading of secondary colors, while having a minimal or usually no effect on the remainder of the color spectrum. Using digital grading, objects and color ranges within a scene can be isolated with precision and adjusted. Color tints can be manipulated and visual treatments pushed to extremes not physically possible with laboratory processing. With these advancements, the color correction process has become increasingly similar to well-established digital painting techniques, ushering forth a new era of digital cinematography.\n\nThe evolution of digital color grading tools has advanced to the point where the colorist can use geometric shapes (such as mattes or masks in photo software such as Adobe Photoshop) to isolate color adjustments to specific areas of an image. These tools can highlight a wall in the background and color only that wall, leaving the rest of the frame alone, or color everything but that wall. Subsequent color correctors (typically software-based) have the ability to use spline-based shapes for even greater control over isolating color adjustments. Color keying is also used for isolating areas to adjust.\n\nInside and outside of area-based isolations, digital filtration can be applied to soften, sharpen or mimic the effects of traditional glass photographic filters in nearly infinite degrees.\n\nWhen trying to isolate a color adjustment on a moving subject, the colorist traditionally would have needed to manually move a mask to follow the subject. In its most simple form, motion tracking software automates this time-consuming process using algorithms to evaluate the motion of a group of pixels. These techniques are generally derived from match moving techniques used in special effects and compositing work.\n\nThe evolution of the telecine device into film scanning allowed the digital information scanned from a film negative to be of sufficient resolution to transfer back to film. In the early 90’s, Kodak developed the Cineon Film System to capture, manipulate, and record back to film and they called this the “Digital Intermediate”. This term stuck. The first Digital Intermediate of any form was the Cinesite restoration of “Snow White and The Seven Dwarves” in 1993. [Previously in 1990 for \"Rescuers Down Under\", the Disney CAPS system had been used to scan artwork, color and composite it, and then record it to film, but this was also intermixed with a traditional lab development process over a length of time]\n\nIn the late 1990s, the films \"Pleasantville\" and \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" advanced the technology to the point that the creation of a digital intermediate was practical, which greatly expanded the capabilities of the digital telecine colorist in a traditionally film-oriented world. After 2010, almost all feature films go through the DI process, while manipulation through photochemical processing is rare or used on archival films.\n\nIn Hollywood, \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" was the first film to be wholly digitally graded. The negative was scanned with a Spirit DataCine at 2K resolution, then colors were digitally fine-tuned using a Pandora MegaDef color corrector on a Virtual DataCine. The process took several weeks, and the resulting digital master was output to film again with a Kodak laser recorder to create a master internegative.\n\nModern motion picture processing typically uses both digital cameras and digital projectors and calibrated devices are essential to predict whether the appropriate colors are appearing.\n\nIn early use, hardware-based systems (da Vinci 2K, Pandora International MegaDEF, etc.) have historically offered better performance but a smaller feature set than software-based systems. Their real time performance was optimised to particular resolution and bit depths, as opposed to software platforms using standard computer industry hardware that often trade speed for resolution independence, e.g. Apple's Color (previously Silicon Color Final Touch), ASSIMILATE SCRATCH, Adobe SpeedGrade and SGO Mistika. While hardware-based systems always offer real-time performance, some software-based systems need to pre-render as the complexity of the color grading increases. On the other hand, software-based systems tend to have more features such as spline-based windows/masks and advanced motion tracking.\n\nThe line between hardware and software no longer exists as many software-based color correctors (e.g. Pablo , Mistika, SCRATCH, Autodesk Lustre, Nucoda Film Master and Filmlight Baselight) use multi processor workstations and a GPU (graphics processing unit) as a means of hardware acceleration. As well, some newer software-based systems use a cluster of multiple parallel GPUs on the one computer system to improve performance at the very high resolutions required for feature film grading. e.g. Blackmagic Designs' DaVinci Resolve. Some color grading software like Synthetic Aperture's Color Finesse runs solely as software and will even run on low-end computer systems. High-speed RAID arrays are an essential part of the process for all systems.\n\nHardware systems are no longer common because of the excellent price/performance of software systems. The control panels are placed in a color suite for the colorist to operate the telecine remotely.\n\n\nThe controls are both shown on-screen in an application, controlled by a hardware peripheral, or are sometimes accessed as a plugin to a host application.\n\n\nIn 2016, an international professional organization for film colorists; the Colorist Society International was founded at the NAB Show in Las Vegas. \n\n\n"}

A spin-off game, \"Corpse Party: Hysteric Birthday 2U\", was released for the PSP in Japan on August 2, 2012 and will be released for Windows in the winter of 2018. A direct sequel of \"Corpse Party: Book of Shadows\", called \"Corpse Party: Blood Drive\", was released in Japan on July 24, 2014 on PlayStation Vita, and was released in North America by XSeed Games on October 13, 2015, and on October 20, 2015 in Europe.\n\nAnother sequel titled \"Corpse Party 2: Dead Patient\" was created for the PC by GrindHouse, a dōjin circle founded by members affiliated with Team GrisGris. It is released episodically, with the first chapter released on May 29, 2013.\n\nThe series has spawned several manga works, an anime OVA series, drama CDs, theme park attractions, and two live action films.\n\n\"Corpse Party\" is a linear horror monster adventure game with some role-playing elements. It is played in a third-person view, top-down perspective. Players are tasked with exploring the haunted school grounds for a means of escape. To fulfill this task, characters must interact with the environment and surroundings such as picking up objects, talking to other characters, and inspecting documents while avoiding enemy-like entities.\n\nThe game's story is split into five chapters, each focusing on different characters and featuring multiple endings that are achieved based on the player's in-game decisions: a \"True Ending\" required for the game's progression; and several \"Wrong Endings\" that are unlocked when the player performs events irrelevant to the main storyline. Characters also possess hit points (HP), which measure how much damage they can take before dying, in some instances leading to a wrong ending. As players progress through the game, they will unlock ten optional \"Extra Chapters\", vignettes that focus on the game's side characters and expand the storyline.\n\nThe plot of the \"Corpse Party\" series concerns a group of Japanese high school students who, after celebrating their school's culture festival, are telling ghost stories when a sudden earthquake transports them to a dilapidated schoolhouse in an alternative dimension that is haunted by the ghosts of people who have been trapped there. The main playable character is Satoshi Mochida, a kindhearted high school student who is teased by his classmates for his cowardly nature. Three of the other characters are students from Satoshi's class: Naomi Nakashima, Satoshi's childhood friend; Yoshiki Kishinuma, an intimidating yet good-natured student; and Ayumi Shinozaki, the class representative. Rounding out the group is Yuka Mochida, Satoshi's younger sister. The game's antagonist is the red ghost of a teenage girl who seeks vengeance for her wrongful death.\n\n\"Blood Covered\", released in 2008, is an enhanced remake and port of the 1996 \"Corpse Party\". It includes more characters, larger maps, updated graphics, and professional voice actors. It was later followed by another enhanced remake, \"Blood Covered: Repeated Fear\", which was released internationally as \"Corpse Party\".\n\nThe remake thoroughly expands the plot and setting of the original game. Here, the haunted schoolhouse is named , a fictional Fujisawa elementary school that was torn down following the murders and disappearances of several of its staff and students. In modern-day Japan, the main characters' high school, , has been built over the elementary school site. The students are transported to Heavenly Host after performing a charm called , which would supposedly allow them to remain friends for eternity.\n\nIn addition to the five protagonists of the original game, \"Blood Covered\" introduces four characters to the playable cast: Seiko Shinohara, Naomi's best friend; Mayu Suzumoto, a popular student due to transfer out of Kisaragi; Sakutaro Morishige, Mayu's best friend; and Yui Shishido, the class's homeroom teacher. \"Blood Covered\" also includes several characters from other schools who are also trapped inside Heavenly Host and affect the story. Two notable characters are Naho Saenoki, a selfish but helpful paranormalist from who discovered the Sachiko Ever After charm and came to investigate Heavenly Host; and Yuuya Kizami, a sadistic student from who accompanies Yuka as she is separated from her brother. The red ghost is re-envisioned as a young child named Sachiko Shinozaki who kills the students of Heavenly Hosts in anger over her and her mother's murder.\n\nA sequel to \"Blood Covered\", \"Book of Shadows\" features a series of nonlinear chapters that add new twists and backgrounds for various characters and details important to the storyline. The game mostly takes place during the same time the first game did, continuing from one of the \"wrong ends\" in \"Corpse Party\", where Sachiko sends the Kisaragi Academy students back in time. For this purpose, she erases their memories except for Satoshi's. He tries in a desperate attempt to dissuade his classmates from performing the charm, but he joins them, not wanting to let them go alone, sending them on alternative course of actions and encountering several supporting victims in Heavenly Host.\n\nThe game's prologue, \"Blood Drive\", serves as the set up to the eponymous sequel. Two weeks after escaping Heavenly Host, Ayumi and Naomi go to investigate the Shinozaki estate, Sachiko's birthplace, believing there is hope in reviving their dead friends since Naho and Kou Kibiki's existences were not erased like the other victims. At the estate, Ayumi discovers that she is of the same lineage as Sachiko. Hearing an eerie voice, Ayumi uncovers a magical tome known as the Book of Shadows. Ayumi and Naomi perform a resurrection spell for Mayu, but fail. As compensation for using black magic, the book unleashes its rage upon Ayumi until her older sister Hinoe Shinozaki rushes in and saves Ayumi, at the cost of her own life.\n\nOn the day of Sachiko's birth and death, the curse on her weakens and she gets 24 hours to celebrate her birthday as someone closer to the girl she was before her death. She uses the timeloops as established in \"Corpse Party: Book of Shadows\" to force all survivors at that point to participate in activities she has set up. Given it's either that or die horribly again, something all are aware that they've already experienced but can't remember in full, they go along with her demands. The game features almost all characters from the previous games and some new ones. While a pseudo-horror spin-off at best, it is part of the storyline, setting up a few details to prepare for \"Corpse Party: Blood Drive\".\n\nAs with \"Corpse Party: Book of Shadows\", there is only one extra chapter. This extra chapter takes place during the previous game and is more conventional horror. It tells of Yoshiki's and Ayumi's encounter with four students from Sugatani Senior High School, notably Azusa Takai.\n\n\"Corpse Party: Blood Drive\" is the direct sequel to \"Corpse Party: Book of Shadows\", and is the first game featuring settings and characters rendered in 3D. The game was released for the PlayStation Vita in Japan in July 2014 by 5pb. The characters are depicted in 3D chibi style, however traditional CG artwork appears during cutscenes, illustrated by Sakuya Kamishiro.\n\nContinuing from the prologue, Naomi manages to save Ayumi and takes her to a hospital. The Shinozaki estate and tome subsequently vanish without a trace. Ayumi had been severely ill for her misuse of the Book of Shadows' black magic. In the hospital, a woman claiming to be a spiritual associate of Hinoe's visits Ayumi. This woman belongs to the Wiccan Institute, an organization that worships spirits. She tells her Hinoe's last wish, which is to regain the Book of Shadows or the world will fall into the abyss. This is partially a lie, as the woman is under threat of other organizations to get Ayumi to find the book, which they wish to use for their own gain.\n\nAfter being discharged from the hospital two months later, Ayumi returns to Kisaragi Academy where Satoshi and friends give her a warm welcome. However, the absence of their dead friends is a constant reminder of their inevitable reality. A new teacher's assistant, Kuon Niwa, supervises their homeroom. Later, on her way home, a black hooded boy approaches Ayumi and tells her, \"If you reclaim the Book of Shadows and use it at Heavenly Host, those who have died there will be revived.\" Ayumi pledges that she will once more take back the Book of Shadows. The trail leads into the previous residence of Makina Shinozaki. To make matters worse, Heavenly Host's curse is expanded by the \"new Sachiko\", later named Sachi.\n\nIn January 2017, the game was ported to Android and iOS. The port contained various improvements to the balance of the game and improved loading times. In addition to that, the game also supports a cloud saving feature.\n\nDummy head mics were utilized for \"Blood Covered\", \"Book of Shadows\", and \"Blood Drive\" to provide perceived three dimensional sound.\n\nA spin-off manga that takes place during the events of \"Corpse Party\". With their school, , shutting down for good, the students of a small town were heading for different directions in life, not until they decide to perform the \"Sachiko Ever After\" charm swallowing the entire class to Heavenly Host Elementary, along with a mysterious girl's spirit. In order to get out, they must track and get rid of the spirit.\n\nThe game takes place five years after the events of \"Corpse Party\" Heavenly Host Arc, implied to be the consequences of the Book of Shadows' powers starting to bring about the end of the world by allowing the spirit realm and real world to start to converge together. The setting takes place at fallen into a dark abyss. Patient records and clinical charts are scattered all over the hospital, with zombies and a bizarre SWAT team roaming through the hallways. An amnesiac girl, Ayame Itou, wakes up on an operating table and encounters the dark happenings around her.\n\nThe opening for \"Corpse Party Blood Covered: ...Repeated Fear\" is \"Shangri-La\" by Asami Imai, and the ending for \"Blood Covered\" is \"Confutatis no Inori\" by Artery Vein (Imai & Eri Kitamura). An insert song, \"Yami ni Nureta Catastrophe\", also sung by Artery Vein, plays at the end of the game.\n\nThe opening theme for \"Corpse Party: Book of Shadows\" is \"Hana no Saku Basho\" by Imai, and the ending is \"Pandora no Yoru\", by Artery Vein.\n\nThe opening theme for \"Corpse Party: Sweet Sachiko's Hysteric Birthday Bash\" is called \"Limited Love\" by Imai, and the ending theme is \"Tsukigen\" by ARTERY VEIN. An insert song, \"Hanabi\", sung by Yumi Hara, plays at the final scene where Sachiko's birthday has ended and she seemed to have only a brief memory of it, before screaming in agony and reverting to her malicious self.\n\nIn \"Corpse Party: Blood Drive\", there are two openings; the first one being \"In the Rain\", by Hara, and the second being \"Keshin\" by Imai, which plays at Chapter 7 after Ayumi's retrieval of the Book of Shadows. The ending is \"Translucent Days\" by ARTERY VEIN.\n\nAlthough the series has received mixed to positive reviews as a whole, it is regarded as a \"cult favorite\" in Japan with a dedicated fan following. \"Famitsu\" gave \"Corpse Party: Blood Drive\" a score of 29/40.\n\nThe video game has been adapted into four manga series: \"Corpse Party: Blood Covered\", published by Square Enix; \"Corpse Party: Musume\" and \"Corpse Party: Book of Shadows\", published by Media Factory; and \"Corpse Party: Another Child\", published by Mag Garden. One original video animation (OVA), \"Corpse Party: Missing Footage\", was released on August 2, 2012. Another OVA consisting of four episodes titled \"\", was released on July 24, 2013, and later licensed by Section23 Films.\nA movie adaptation was also made, which was released on August 1, 2015, while a film adaptation of \"Corpse Party: Book of Shadows\" was released on June 30, 2016.\n\nOn June 12, 2015, the Chinese Ministry of Culture listed \"Corpse Party\" among 38 anime and manga titles banned in China.\n\n"}

The game can be played by many players seated around a table and is often played in large groups. Each player possesses a cup and in unison the players tap out the defined rhythm using their cups. It can be played competitively, where the rhythm speeds up in each \"round\", and a player making a mistake in the rhythm must drop out of the game, with a new \"round\" starting after each elimination, and game play continuing until only one player remains, with that player being the winner.\n\nThe cup game begins with a cup placed upside down in front of each player. Assuming a right-handed player, the rhythm normally proceeds as follows:\nRepeat the above sequence indefinitely. Some versions involve variations where the players exchange cups during the performance of the rhythm, or players slap hands with each other.\n\nIn the Lulu and the Lampshades (and newer) performances, this is the right hand which slaps down flat onto the table.\nRepeat the above sequence indefinitely.\n\nChristian singer Rich Mullins used the cup game to accompany his song \"Screen Door\" on his 1987 album \"Pictures in the Sky\". It was used by Palavra Cantada (Paulo Tatit & Sandra Peres) in 1998 with the song \"Fome Come\" from their album \"Canções Curiosas\". In 2009 the band Lulu and the Lampshades used the game in their performance of the 1930 Carter Family song \"When I'm Gone\" as modified to suit the game by \"Lulu\" (Luisa Gerstein). Rapper P.O.S also uses the cup game in \"Optimist (We Are Not for Them)\" from his 2009 album Never Better. In 2011 the cup game was again used by Anna Burden to accompany the song \"When I'm Gone\" in a YouTube video that went viral. Anna Kendrick taught herself to copy Burden's video, and this was worked into her performance in the 2012 film \"Pitch Perfect\", her version \"Cups (When I'm Gone)\" in turn becoming widely copied with a 2013 video after the single from the soundtrack rose on the national and international charts.\n\nThere are older cup games as well, with rhythmic moving and passing of cups. Often there is a particular place in the rhythm where the passing is different, faster, or more difficult, and missing this pass puts a player \"out\", a new \"round\" beginning with each elimination, and the last player winning.\n\nOne such game is called \"Acitrón de un fandango\" (or various alternate spelling), and is said to originate in Mexico.\n\n"}

It was released in 1987 on the Commodore 64 and DOS. It's a dungeon crawler based on killing monsters during the descent. It had a sequel named \"Fire King\" released on the same platforms that played in a similar style.\n\nThe game can be played in either single player mode or two player co-operative mode, using two joysticks, or a joystick plus keyboard. Players can choose to control either the hero, armed with throwing knives, or the heroine, armed with a crossbow. During the game, players will find various relics which permanently increase attack power, defense, or magic power, as well as an arsenal of magic scrolls, and special amulets that create temporary effects. Food can be picked up to heal damage, but occasionally turns out to be poison which hurts the player. Similarly, some scrolls turn out to be a \"slow death curse,\" which takes a way the player's health continuously until death, unless the exit from that level is found. Enemies in the game include rats, ghosts who can walk through walls, dervishes who can steal a player's possessions, snappers who remain dormant until disturbed, and mad mages, who shoot fireballs. These monsters emerge from special spawning areas called vortexes, which can be destroyed by the player with several shots, except for the rats, who emerge from indestructible sewer grates.\n\nThe dungeon consists of many interconnected maze-like levels which rooms, hallways, and doors. There are several multi-level mazes, where the player must ascend and descend between levels several times before finding the correct path. The collecting of keys to open doors is a fundamental part of the game, while fighting against a horde of monsters. Most of the levels entail some sort of puzzle solving, involving clues in the form of scrolls that are picked up along the way. These scrolls also tell the story of an unsuccessful group of adventurers who journeyed through the dungeon before the current players. This ill-fated party included members Arthur, Bloodaxe, Grindlewald, Furrowfoot, and Imelda, as well as Mellack, a mage whom the previous adventurers met along the way. Correctly answering some questions after each story section yields bonus health points.\n\nLevel 100 is unique in the game, as its geography includes large, irregularly shaped caves, rather than straight or diagonal walls as in the other levels. Level 100 also only features one enemy, the demon boss, Calvrak. \"Demon Stalkers\" includes its own level-editor, allowing the player to modify all levels except 100.\n\nA review in \"Computer Gaming World\", comparing the game to \"Gauntlet\", noted \"Gauntlet seemed to have ten times more monsters than \"Demon Stalkers\". Thus, despite the similarities, \"Gauntlet\" is primarily an action game and \"Demon Stalkers\" is a search game with action thrown in.\" The review concluded by saying neither game would disappoint.\n\n"}

The word \"dumka\" literally means \"thought\". Originally, it is the diminutive form of the Ukrainian term \"duma\", pl. \"dumy\", \"a Slavic (specifically Ukrainian) epic ballad … generally thoughtful or melancholic in character\". Ukrainian and other Slavic classical composers drew on the harmonic patterns in the folk music of their countries to inform their more formal classical compositions. \nThe composition of dumky became popular after the publication of an ethnological study and analysis and a number of illustrated lectures were made by the Ukrainian composer Mykola Lysenko in 1873 and 1874 in Kiev and Saint Petersburg. The lectures and publication were illustrated by a live performances by the blind kobzar Ostap Veresai who performed a number of dumky singing to the accompaniment of his bandura. Lysenko's study was the first to specifically study the melodies and the instrumental accompaniment played on the bandura, kobza or lira of the epic dumy.\n\nA natural part of the process of transferring the traditional folk form to a formal classical milieu was the appropriation of the Dumka form by Slavic composers, most especially by Antonín Dvořák. Thus, in classical music, it came to mean \"a type of instrumental music involving sudden changes from melancholy to exuberance\". Though generally characterized by a gently plodding, dreamy duple rhythm, many examples are in triple meter, including the popular Op. 72 No. 2 by Dvořák. Dvořák's last and best-known piano trio, No. 4 in E minor, Op. 90, has six movements, each of which is a Dumka; the piece is sometimes called the \"Dumky-Trio\".\n\nMajor examples in the classical repertoire include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was a way to represent our girl.\" Miglioli met the Trucco sisters when she was four years old. After completing high school, the duo moved to Buenos Aires at the age of 19. They were later joined by Toti's younger sister Clara \"Wewi\" Trucco on percussion. There, they met and became friends with other rappers including Koxmoz and Apolo MC. In addition to music, both Miglioli and the Trucco sisters have a background in acting and vocal training. Fémina has toured in Latin America, Europe, and the United States.

A sequel entitled Horké léto 2: Majer se vrací was developed by Centauri Production and published in 1999 by JRC Interactive. Žhavé léto 3 ½ rounds off the trilogy as a 2006 action/adventure/driving game developed by Centauri Production and CINEMAX,and published by Akella. Evil Days of Luckless John (Czech: Žhavé léto 3 ½; Russian: Сорвать Куш) is a 2006 Czech action adventure video game developed by Centauri Production and published by Playlogic. It is a spin-off to \"Horké léto\". In Russia it was published by Akella.\n\nGraphics were created by Marek Píša. Píša and Viktor Bocan participated in writing the screenplay. Sounds and music were the work of William Foldes. All characters are voiced by comedian Zdeněk Izer, a notable Czech impersonator, besides some female characters. The game has the same humorous style seen across Czech adventures such as Polda. It was the first Czech game with professional dubbing. The game's most famous quote comes in its opening scene: \"I am an ordinary kid. Guys call me Rambo and girls [call me] asshole. Otherwise, I'm Majer. Honza Majer\". Like many other domestic video games of the era, Horke Leto was intended to appeal directly to Czech and Slovak players. The game became a phenomenon upon its release and it immediately ranked among the best Czech adventures ever. Petr Ticháček wrote for BonusWeb in 2003 that the fan base of the game had heavily diminished.\n\nAccording to Miroslav Mrňa, the idea of a sequel was brought up by JRC, then an exclusive distributor for the first game; the developers found this proposition interesting so pursued it. Developments began in late December 1998. The team consisted of one scriptwriter, two programmers, three graphic artists and two musicians. Mrna described the development and production process of the game in detail for iDNES.cz. For Horke Leto 2, a watercolour-style design was made for the backgrounds, which were painted by hand then scanned into the computer. They were inspired by designs from painter Jan Štěpánek. By mid-November, the game was expected to be released in time for the Christmas season. The game would be released at the same time as Polda 2, and there was a friendly rivalry between the two titles. Horke Leto 2 caught the attention of Bonusweb during development, who devoted a considerable amount of airtime to the game, including a series of news articles where they observed the game's development, to a preview and review, a tutorial, an interview with project lead Miroslav Mrňa, and finally a demo. IDEA Games completed a conversion of the game for iOS and Android platforms in 2012; players should access a 30 minute episode before having to pay to complete the rest of the adventure. The game was re-released with updated graphics. \n\nWhile developers from Centauri Production wanted to make a second sequel to the game, they were unable to obtain the rights to the name \"Horke Leto\" or the main character Honza, however the title was still designed as a spiritual sequel. Its original title was meant to be Raiders of the Lost Casino, but this was only used for international distribution purposes. It was announced in May 2005 for release in the third quarter of that year. The game's original title was \"Raiders of the Lost Casino\", a reference to the Indiana Jones film Raiders of the Lost Ark. the game's visual style is both cartoon-like and gritty. The game was originally supposed to be released in the first few weeks of 2006. This was later pushed to February of that year. Akella demonstrated the game as a work-in-progress at E3 2006. Akella planned an English release for the end of 2006. A French localisation would later be made.\n\nIn \"Horké léto\", the player takes control of teenager Honza Majer, who must rescue his family after they were captured by cannibals. In \"Horké léto 2\", Honza Majer must retrieve the Purple Salamander artefact from the bandit One-Eye Dingo. \"Žhavé léto 3 ½\" sees the player take control of Honza's grandfather, the hapless protagonist Johnny Majer, in the 1920s as he verses the Mafia in the age of the prohibition. Set in the gangster age of the 1930s, the player takes control of the handsome street rat Johnny who inherits a casino, only to discover that there is a plot to expropriate it.\n\nThe first two games are point and click adventures controlled by the mouse. The third is mainly a point and click adventure with elements of stealth, fighting, driving, and shoot ‘em up.\n\nRefresher.cz deemed it an average game, but noted that it didn't stop it from becoming a domestic hit. Doupe.cz wrote the game is one of the best Czech adventures that every player should play. Excalibur suggests that while the graphics and gameplay were nothing special, it was the dubbing into local languages that captured the imagination of Czecheslovakia. PC Tuning deemed it one of the 10 best Czech games of all time. Refresher thought it was the 20th best Czech title, praising its funny dialogues and first-class dubbing.\n\nUpon a preview, Bonusweb hoped that the game's humour would outweigh its average graphics and animations making it an above-average Czech title. Bonusweb.cz compared the title to Polda 2, and ultimately decided that despite its limitations it was worth a play.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews from critics who enjoyed the game's artistic style and story but disliked its gameplay and interface. Hexus disliked the clunky interface, though praised the graphics. Adventure Classic Gaming felt the game was a disappointing attempt to recapture the classic point and click adventures of the late 20th century. Adventures Planet noted the strange mix of genres, that saw arcade-style gameplay be followed by Myst-style puzzles. Bonusweb felt that despite the game's limitations, it was genuinely surprising. Game Watcher deemed the title \"pretty poor\". Game Slave thought \"John\" was a great idea that was poorly executed. 4 Players felt a lot of the humour fell flat. Jeux Video offered a funny and endearing experience. Adventure Treff felt the game was more likely to induce annoyance than fun. PC Guru thought the game was fun despite its graphics. Bonusweb compared the game favorably to Polda 5. Tiscalo felt the game's screenshots were reminiscent of Full Throttle.\n"}

The film, which was directed by Richard Attenborough, is based on a screenplay by William Goldman, who also wrote the novel upon which it was based. The score was composed by Jerry Goldsmith.\n\nAfter Charles \"Corky\" Withers fails in his first attempt at professional magic, his mentor \"Merlin\" (E. J. André) says that he needs to have a better show business gimmick. A year later, Corky comes back as a combination magician and ventriloquist with a foul-mouthed dummy named Fats, becoming a huge success. Corky's powerful agent, Ben Greene, is on the verge of signing him for his own television show, but Corky bails out for the Catskills, where he grew up, claiming to be \"afraid of success.\" In truth, Corky does not want to take the TV network's required medical examination because doctors might find out that he suffers from severe mental issues, and that even off-stage he cannot control Fats (a manifestation of Corky's id). \n\nIn the Catskills, Corky reunites with his high-school crush, Peggy Ann Snow, who is stuck in a passionless marriage with Corky's friend from high school, Duke. A magic trick with a deck of cards charms Peggy into thinking they are soulmates, leading to them having sex. This sparks the jealousy not only of Duke but also the dummy Fats. In the midst of an argument \"between\" Corky and Fats, Greene arrives unexpectedly and confronts Corky, discovering the truth about Corky's state of mind. Corky pleads that nothing is wrong with him and that he is just rehearsing, so Greene puts him to the test, saying \"Make Fats shut up for 5 minutes.\" Corky puts aside Fats, but is unable to last 5 minutes without delivering a rapid stream of speech through Fats. Greene demands that Corky get help, and leaves to make some calls to doctors, but Fats convinces Corky to kill his agent. Corky chases after Greene in the woods and bludgeons him with Fats' hard, wooden head, and then attempts to drag the body into a lake. However, a still-living Greene suddenly lunges at him, causing Corky to drown him. \n\nThe next morning, Fats becomes even more possessive and jealous when Corky says that he plans to elope with Peggy and leave the dummy behind. Duke returns from his trip earlier than expected. Suspecting his wife has cheated on him, he wants to have a talk with Corky by the lake. Rather than confront him, Duke awkwardly confides to Corky that he loves Peggy and is worried about losing her. Duke suddenly spots Greene's body on the edge of the lake. Duke, believing Greene could still be alive, sends Corky to get help. Curious, he decides to search Corky's cabin, where Fats stabs him with \"help\" from Corky. \n\nAn increasingly deranged Corky manages to pull himself together and persuade Peggy to run away with him. But she insists on waiting to tell Duke face to face. She thinks everything is fine until Fats \"comes alive\" and reveals that Corky's card trick is only a ruse he uses to seduce women, and that Peggy is only the latest of his conquests. Repulsed, she rejects Corky and locks herself in her bedroom. Fats says that, from this point on, \"he\" will make the decisions in Corky's life, immediately asserting this new authority by ordering Corky to kill Peggy. \n\nCorky, turning on the charm and using Fats' voice, apologizes to Peggy through her locked door, and leaves her a wooden heart that he carved. A short while later, Corky returns with a bloodstained knife. Fats seems pleased — until it is revealed that the blood on the knife is Corky's, who has fatally stabbed himself so that he won't kill anyone else. As a result, Fats also feels faint. They wonder which of them will die first. Moments later, Peggy returns to their cabin, happily calling out that she has changed her mind and has decided to run away with Corky after all. As she speaks, her voice changes into a caricature that sounds like a female Fats.\n\n\nJoseph E. Levine bought the film rights to Goldman's novel for $1 million. This included Goldman's fee to write the screenplay.\n\nThe first draft was written for first-choice director Norman Jewison. Jewison wanted Jack Nicholson to star but Nicholson turned it down, claiming he did not want to wear a hairpiece. Steven Spielberg expressed interest in directing the film and considered casting Robert De Niro for Corky. Richard Attenborough, who had just made \"A Bridge Too Far\" with Goldman and Levine, then agreed to direct.\n\nLaurence Olivier was originally offered the role of the agent but was unable to do it so Burgess Meredith was cast instead. Meredith got the role after walking into \"21\" one night when Joe E. Levine was there – Levine cast him on the spot. Meredith modelled his performance on the agent Swifty Lazar, even shaving his head to look like Lazar. \"I tried to get his cool, understated manner, his sharp clothes and, most of all, his way of speaking softly so that you've got to lean over to hear what he's saying,\" said Meredith.\n\nGoldman later wrote about the film that \"Burgess Meredith was perfect and Tony Hopkins... was so wonderful here. But running stride for stride with him was Miss Olsson. I think Ann-Margret is the least appreciated emotional actress anywhere.\"\n\nAnn-Margret and Anthony Hopkins were each paid around $300,000 for their performances.\n\nExteriors were shot in Ukiah, California.\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics receiving a \"certified fresh\" 83% on Rotten Tomatoes. Film critic Gene Siskel gave the film a very positive review, and ranked it at #9 on his list of the 10 best films of 1978.\n\nHowever, \"The Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy Film Review\" 1990 writeup of the film remarks that Hopkins appears stiff in the lead role, but praised the supporting cast: \"Ann-Margret...invests her role with a considerable sparkle. Particularly good is the great and underrated Burgess Meredith whose sharp and alert Hollywood agent is a real plum of a performance. Jerry Goldsmith also adds a fine nervy carnivalesque score.\" Vincent Canby for \"The New York Times\" wrote that \"\"Magic\" is neither eerie nor effective. It is, however, very heavy of hand.\"\n\nGoldman received a 1979 Edgar Award, from the Mystery Writers of America, for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. Hopkins received both Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations for his role as the tragically disturbed Corky.\n\nThe score was composed and conducted by the American composer Jerry Goldsmith. The complete soundtrack was released on CD through Varèse Sarabande in April, 2003 and features twenty-two tracks score at a running time of forty-two minutes. It was subsequently reissued by La-La Land Records.\n\nAs 20th Century Fox never owned complete rights to this film (the studio did and still does own the theatrical distribution and music rights), other companies (especially Embassy and nowadays MGM) have been able to release home video versions of \"Magic\" under different licenses. However, subsequent legal complications kept the film from being formally reissued on VHS and DVD in the last decade due in part to Embassy Pictures' corporate holdings being divided amongst different entities. Recently the rights were acquired by the American Movie Classics division of AMC Film Holdings, LLC, while TV rights are handled for syndication by Trifecta Entertainment & Media (under Paramount Pictures). An uncut version is currently available on widescreen DVD and Blu-ray.\n\nIn 2010, the BBC Radio 4 satirical comedy series \"The Now Show\" claimed that Michael Gove looked like a scary ventriloquist puppet. As a result, whenever Gove is referenced, Hugh Dennis does an impression of Fats ordering \"Govey\" to do things.\n\nMadness resulting from one person living two personas through a ventriloquist's dummy has been portrayed several times before in film and television, most notably: \n\n"}

Senegal has the distinction of being the only country in Africa to not only legalise prostitution but also regulate it. The only condition that it is done discreetly. Prostitution was first legalised in 1966. UNAIDS estimate that there are over 20,000 prostitutes in the country. The average age for a sex worker in Senegal is 28 years old and female.\n\nThere are reports of police and security forces extorting money in return for overlooking infringements of prostitution regulations. Sex workers report that they are targeted by police for bribes or free sex whether they are registered or not.\n\nSenegal has gained a reputation as a sex tourism destination since the 1970s and since the early 2000s it has also gained a reputation for female sex tourism.\n\nIt has been legal since 1969 to sell sex as long as prostitute has registered, is over 21 years old, has a regular medical check-up, and can present an up-to-date \"carnet sanitaire\" (medical report card) to the police upon request. Estimates of the number of prostitutes who are registered vary from 8 to 25%.\n\nSolicitation is prohibited by article 318 of the Penal Code, and 3rd party involvement, such as procuring and brothel keeping, is prohibited by articles 323 - 325.\n\nIllegal foreign prostitutes are subject to arrest, as are pimps and underage prostitutes. Underage prostitution typically makes use of adult pimps. The maximum sentence for procuring a minor for prostitution is five years' imprisonment and a fine of 4 million CFA francs (approximately US$7,600), but the law is not generally enforced effectively.\n\nThe regulation of prostitution was enacted in 1969 to try to control the spread of STIs through regular medical check-ups and treatment. Police monitor the sex workers to ensure they attend regular health checks. Although the law requires two examinations per months, clinics cannot cope and this has been reduced to once a month. Any sex worker who tests positive for an infection has their carnet sanitaire suspended until treated.\n\nIn 1993 the Senegalese sex worker organisation \"Association for Women at risk from AIDS (AWA)\" was formed out of an AIDS prevention scheme at Dakar polytechnic. AWA provide support and advice to sex workers, including at the clinics, and distribute condoms.\n\nUNAIDS reported 6.6% HIV prevalence and 9.7% syphilis infections amongst sex workers in 2016.\n\nSenegal is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Senegalese boys and girls are also subjected to sex trafficking. Internal trafficking is more prevalent than transnational trafficking. Reports indicate most Senegalese sex trafficking victims are exploited within Senegal, particularly in the southeastern gold-mining region of Kédougou.

Despite his oaths of loyalty to the Japanese Empire, Tsurugi's father was executed by firing squad, an event that Tsurugi witnessed.

{"id": "2069581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2069581", "title": "Television in Israel", "text": "Television in Israel\n\nTelevision in Israel refers to television broadcasting services in the State of Israel, inaugurated on March 24, 1966. Initially, there was one state-owned channel, operated jointly by the Israel Broadcasting Authority and the Israeli Educational Television. In 1986, a second state-regulated channel was launched. This channel became a state-regulated commercial channel in 1993. An additional commercial channel was introduced in 2002, followed by the introduction of three commercial niche channels: an Israeli Russian-speaking channel (in 2002), a channel of Israeli popular music (in 2003) and an Arabic-speaking channel (in 2012). Colour transmissions were introduced gradually around 1980. Multichannel cable television service became available to subscribers gradually since 1989, although illegal cable TV stations were present in the big cities during the 1980s. Satellite-based multichannel service has been available since 2000.\n\nAlmost 75% of the population is subscribed to pay TV systems which are provided either by a cable service called \"HOT\", or by a satellite service called \"yes\".\nThe Israel Broadcasting Authority was closed down in May 2017 and replaced by the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation as the operator of the state-owned TV channels. Channel 2 has split into two different channels in November 2017, giving each of the two current operating commercial companies a channel of its own: Keshet 12, and Reshet 13.\n\nUpon its establishment in May 1948, Israel had one radio station, run directly by the government, which was a continuation of the British Mandate's Hebrew radio station. The first governments, headed by David Ben Gurion, did not favor the establishment of TV stations. Nevertheless, the Israeli government discussed the idea of using television as an instructional and educational tool in 1952 and 1955. In 1961 the Israeli government asked UNESCO to offer its opinion, which was in favor of using television for educational purposes. In the early 1960s, television broadcasts from neighboring Egypt, Lebanon, and Cyprus gradually became available to Israelis through TV sets which were placed in public places, like cafés. Since they were mainly in Arabic, these broadcasts were popular among Israeli Arabs. This raised the government's concern about anti-Israel propaganda that might be included in them.\n\nWhen Levi Eshkol assumed power as prime minister in June 1963, he started to promote the establishment of an Israeli TV channel. In 1964, he invited a team of experts from the European Broadcasting Union to submit their recommendations. In 1965, the Israeli Broadcasting Authority was established in order to distant the government from the everyday management and editorial decisions of the state-owned radio station. The government also passed a resolution stating that this new body will start TV broadcasts within two years.\n\nTelevision in Israel was finally introduced on 24 March 1966, though not by the IBA, but rather by the Israeli Educational Television, which was funded by the Rothschild Foundation and acted as part of the Ministry of Education. The first transmissions were lessons to school students in various subjects, filmed in black and white, and intended to be received by 32 schools across the country. The Israeli Broadcasting Authority launched regular public transmissions on 2 May 1968, on the occasion of Israeli Independence Day.\n\nIsraeli television began operations when American and European stations were switching to full-scale colour transmissions, but Israel's state-controlled stations broadcast only in black and white. According to Arnon Zuckerman, head of IBA's television department from 1973 to March 1979, Israeli prime minister Golda Meir described colour television as \"artificial\" and unnecessary. Yair Lapid, son of Tommy Lapid, the IBA director general from April 1979 to March 1984, claimed the IBA had the equipment for filming and broadcasting in colour for nearly a decade before putting it into use, and the introduction of colour transmissions was halted due to political pressure.\n\nNewscasts and other regular productions were filmed using black and white cameras. However many special productions ordered from private Israeli studios (in particular Herzliya Studios) were filmed and taped in colour. Furthermore, Israeli television bought the rights to many American and British TV series and movies (broadcast with Hebrew-Arabic subtitles). The result was a mixture of colour and black and white broadcasts, which encouraged traders to import colour TV sets, especially as TV stations in neighbouring Jordan and Egypt started colour transmissions in 1974.\n\nThe Israeli government considered the import of color televisions as a frivolous luxury that would increase social gaps. Therefore, the government ordered IBA and IETV to erase the colour from colour-taped telecasts by erasing the \"burst phase\" signal. The \"damaged\" signal triggered the \"colour killer\" mechanism, installed in colour TV sets to prevent the appearance of incidental colour spots on the screen when black-and-white films are broadcast or when the reception is disturbed. This method was named \"mekhikon\" ( \"eraser\"), and soon after its introduction, special TV sets with an \"anti-mekhikon\" ( \"anti-eraser\") device were offered. This device reinstalled the burst phase signal according to several known standards. The client had to turn a switch until the pictures on the screen appeared in natural colours. According to a report in Yediot Aharonoth from January 1979 clients had to manipulate the switch every 15 minutes on average in normal conditions, or up to 10 times an hour when special problems occurred, in order to restore natural colours or if the picture suddenly turned black and white.\n\nBased on information from owners of electric appliance stores, the report estimated that 90% of those who bought colour TV sets also bought the \"anti-mekhikon\" device, whose price ranged between 2,500 and 4,000 Israeli lirot (the TV set itself cost 40-50 thousand lirot).\n\nThe Israeli government allowed colour transmissions by the IBA in November 1977 when IBA provided live color coverage of the historical visit of the Egyptian president, Anwar El Sadat, to Israel. This transmission was sent via satellite to stations around the world. In March 1979 the IBA hosted the annual Eurovision Song Contest, and once again sent the transmission live in colour to stations around the world.\n\nPublic pressure on the issue of colour transmissions mounted, and in 1981 IBA and IETV were allowed to film their own regular productions in colour. This process took more than two years and reached the last stretch on 16 February 1983 when the main daily newscast was broadcast in colour for the first time. According to Lapid's book, this first colour newscast was prepared secretly by some \"enthusiastic workers\" of IBA, in order to avoid industrial actions by the technicians' trade union, who demanded higher salaries for operating colour equipment. Lapid also mentions that the \"anti-mekhikon\" system cost IBA 180 million Israeli lira yearly (approximately 64 million Israeli new shekels in 2011 prices). The IBA stopped filming in black and white on 10 May 1983.\n\nIn 1978 the Israeli government appointed a special committee to explore the establishment of a second channel that would not be under the IBA supervision and would be financed by advertising, however the idea of commercial television was rejected by some parties in the ruling coalition. On 7 October 1986, Prof. Amnon Rubinstein, the then Israeli Minister of Communications ordered the beginning of \"experimental transmissions\" on a second channel, claiming that unless these transmissions had started, the frequencies would have been used by TV networks in neighbouring countries. First transmissions were aired on UHF channel 21 from Mount Eitanim transmission tower situated on the hills west of Jerusalem. These transmissions, which initially included 2–3 hours of video clips every evening and broadcast from a private TV studio in Jerusalem, expanded gradually to include a full program lineup. At this stage the IBA was legally responsible for the channel, but in fact it saw it as an unexpected competition, tried to prevent its inauguration, and was reluctant to take responsibility for its broadcasts. In 1986 the Knesset started discussing the law forming the Second Israeli Broadcasting Authority, which was finally approved in 1990. This new body took responsibility for the second channel from this year onwards. From 1990 to 1993 the Second Broadcasting Authority reviewed bids from commercial companies to establish the regular commercial broadcasts of the second channel, which started on 4 November 1993. The second channel was officially handed to three concessionaires, starting the first commercial broadcasts in Israel, with IETV as the fourth broadcaster which was entitled, by law, for additional hours on this channel as a commercial entity.\n\nPirated television broadcasts via cables became very popular in the major cities of Israel during the late 80s. These were usually local cable television stations broadcasting illegally from private houses to subscribers, mainly films released on video tapes. These local stations vanished with the introduction of regulated cable television in 1989. By mid-1994, some 720,000 Israeli households were hooked up to cable television.\n\nSatellite television was introduced to Israel in 2000.\n\nGenerally speaking, most television distribution channels in Israel utilize the European Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) family of standards.\n\nIn August 2009, Israel launched digital terrestrial broadcasts with the intention to phase out the analogue broadcast. Israel shut down analogue television services on 13 June 2011; the first nation in the Middle East to abandon analogue over-the-air broadcasting. In the early stage there was only single mux broadcast in SFN with five channels and later on a sixth TV channel was added and also a selection of public and regional radio stations. By mid-2017 an additional mux was introduced with five new TV channels in DVB-T2 standard, including IPBC's Hebrew channel \"Kan 11\" channel in HD.\n\nIsraeli television broadcasts mainly in Hebrew and English. While Hebrew is the common language of communication, numerous shows and series of different genres are bought from English-speaking countries. Unless the target audience is preschool children, subtitling in Hebrew is preferred over dubbing, not only for economic considerations. Subtitling is often bilingual, the secondary language being either Arabic or Russian. The state-owned Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA) has an Arabic department which broadcasts news, talk shows, educational programs for children and Egyptian films on IBA's Channel 33. From May 15, 2017, the Arabic channel is operated by the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation. IBA's English department broadcasts a daily locally produced newscast. Commercial channels are obligated to broadcast a portion of their programs in Arabic and Russian, or alternatively translate programs into these languages. There is also a legal obligation on all channels to translate some of their newscasts into the Israeli Sign Language.\n\nIn 2002, an Israeli Russian-speaking commercial channel was launched, named Israel Plus. A similar Arabic-speaking channel started broadcasting in March 2012, after several attempts to establish it earlier failed The first bid for the establishment of this channel was published in 1995, but canceled for formal legal problems. In January 2003, a new bid was published, but the winning company failed to fulfill its financial obligations. A final modified bid was published on 14 April 2010, for which eight companies competed. The Halla TV Company was selected in September 2011.\n\n\n\nPrime-time viewing shares, January–June 2012:\n\n"}

Founded in late 2000 by a consortium of comic book and trade publishers, including Marvel Comics, Image Comics, Dark Horse Comics, Wizard Entertainment, CrossGen Comics and Dynamic Forces Inc., the 501(c)(3) charity aims to assist comic creators with health, medical, and quality-of-life assistance.\n\nMany early comic creators, whose work laid the foundation of entire fictional universes that proved to be highly lucrative for the publishers that profit from them, were often paid little for their work, and were not allowed to keep their creations. According to the Hero Initiative, \"to be eligible for financial assistance from Hero, an applicant must have been a working comic book writer, penciler, inker, colorist or letterer on a work-for-hire basis for no less than 10 years since January 1, 1934.\"\n\nAnyone who meets the eligibility requirements may apply for aid, which could vary from medical assistance, paying rent, or finding employment (in or out of the comics industry). Hero's benefits are not meant to be a permanent crutch for needy creators, but assistance for those in debt, or who have trouble paying bills. Any granted aid is kept confidential.\n\nThe Hero Initiative has two boards of directors: the Executive Board and the Fund Disbursement Board.\n\nThe Executive Board, which handles fund raising and handles operations, comprises Hero Initiative President Jim McLauchlin, former editor-in-chief of Top Cow Comics; comics creator Brian Pulido; and Joe Quesada, editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics. The board members are Steve Borock, president of the Comics Guaranty Corporation; former industry retailer Mike Malve; filmmaker Guillermo del Toro; and Beth Widera, owner of comic book convention MegaCon. Former board members include founders Pat McCallum, editor-in-chief of Wizard Magazine; and Mike Richardson, publisher and founder of Dark Horse Comics.\n\nThe Fund Disbursement Board, who hear cases for aid and make all final decisions on who to aid, act independent of the Executive Board, and is made up entirely of comics creators, writers, artists, and editors. They are (co-chairman) George Pérez, (co-chair) Roy Thomas, (board secretary) Charlie Novinskie, Dennis O'Neil, John Romita Sr., and Jim Valentino.\n\nThe charity is currently supported by Dark Horse Comics, Dynamic Forces, Image Comics, Marvel Entertainment, Top Cow Productions, and Wizard Entertainment.\n\nThe Hero Initiative utilizes many methods of fundraising. Foremost is their annual art auction, auctioning donated original comics art-work at fan conventions. Year-long, they sell donated art and special edition comics at conventions and through the Dynamic Forces website. Artists, writers, and publishers are invited to donate work, and fans are invited to donate money directly to the fund. ACTOR also sells a green Excelsior! wrist-band similar in design to the Livestrong wristband. \n\nin 2017, the Arizona Comic Mini Expo held a Drink and Draw event to raise money for the Initiative. Several professional comic book artists provided sketches to be exchanged for donations. The money raised was split between the HERO Initiative and the ACLU of Arizona.\n\nThe Hero Initiative was formerly known as A Commitment to Our Roots, or ACTOR, from its founding until September 2006. While the original name of the organization reflected the charity's goal, the acronym that resulted, ACTOR, more often confused people unfamiliar with the organization. In an effort to expand the marketability and fund-raising ability of the charity, the executive board decided to change the name to something more associated with comic books, thus the new name, Hero, named after the common and recognizable comic industry word Superhero.\n\n\nIn 2010, The Hero Initiative created The Dick Giordano Humanitarian of the Year Award, named after former board member Dick Giordano, who had died earlier in the year. The award recognizes one person in comics each year who demonstrates particular generosity and integrity in support of the overall comic book community. It debuted at the 2010 Harvey Awards ceremony held at the Baltimore Comic-Con. \n\n"}

It was performed in the Great Hall of Whitehall Palace on 15 February 1613, as one item in the elaborate festivities surrounding the marriage of Princess Elizabeth, daughter of King James I, to Frederick V, Elector Palatine in the Rhineland.\n\nThe masque had a Virginia theme; Chapman had been a follower of the Prince of Wales, Prince Henry, before Henry's death in November 1612, and Henry had been a strong backer of the movement to colonize the New World. The principal masquers were stylized as Native Americans, \"Princes of Virginia,\" though without much representative accuracy: they were dressed in \"cloth of silver embroidered with gold,\" with olive-colored masks, though they were also lavishly feathered and equipped with ornaments \"imitating Indian work\" — an attempt at an effect \"altogether estrangeful and Indian-like.\" The conceit was that these sun-worshippers had come to honor the wedding couple and to accept Christianity.\n\nThe celebration began with a torchlit parade down Chancery Lane, headed by fifty gentlemen on horseback, followed by the figures of the anti-masque, boys dressed as baboons in \"Neapolitan suits and great ruffs,\" and the musicians and masquers in chariots. At Whitehall, Jones's stage set was a golden mountain. Next to it on either side were a silver temple, octagonal and domed, and a hollow tree — representing the poles of experience of masque and anti-masque: temple for the masquers, tree for the \"baboons.\" The presenters were figures of classical mythology and personifications typical of the masque form: Plutus; a personified Honor, with Eunomia, one of the three Hours, as her priestess; and Capriccio, a Commedia dell'arte-style figure. The golden rock moved forward toward the viewers, then split open to release the anti-masquers. Later the top of the mountain opened to reveal the principal masquers and a crew of torchbearers. The torchbearers danced with torches lit at both ends; then the masquers danced their dances, finally joined by the audience. The general reaction was highly positive, giving the masque a reputation as one of the best-received works of its type in the Stuart era.\n\nThe masque was sponsored by two of the four Inns of Court, those mentioned in the title. (The other two Inns of Court sponsored their own wedding tribute, \"The Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray's Inn,\" by Francis Beaumont.) The records of Lincoln's Inn show that the Inn spent just over £1086 on the masque, charging its members fees ranging from £1 10 shillings to £4 to pay the bill. The records of the Middle Temple are not as complete in their details, though its share of the total bill was likely equal, and its charges were probably very similar. Chapman was paid £100 for his masque, while Robert Johnson earned £45 for his music.\n\nThe masque was entered into the Stationers' Register on 27 February 1613; the quarto edition that followed, printed by George Eld for the bookseller George Norton, is undated, but probably was issued as promptly as possible after the masque's performance, to capitalize on public interest. A second edition, also undated, was later issued by Norton. Chapman dedicated the work to Sir Edward Phelips, the Master of the Rolls, who along with Henry Hobart the Attorney General had been responsible for selecting Chapman as the author and for driving the whole project to a successful completion.\n\nUnlike Ben Jonson, Inigo Jones's most common literary partner in masquing, Chapman was a close friend of Jones, and did not engage in the kind of ego competition that Jonson maintained with Jones for some two decades. The masque's printed text shows that Chapman let Jones — a man of no small ego himself — take the lead in grabbing credit; the title page states that the work was \"Invented and fashioned, with the ground and special structure of the whole work, by our kingdom's most artful and ingenious architect Inigo Jones. Supplied, applied, digested and written by George Chapman.\"\n\n"}

Throughout each episode, viewer questions, queries, dares and challenges are answered in an entertaining and educational manner along with intersecting storylines.\n\nCurio, Nitro and Picasso, former television presenters of the series \"The Shak\", move in together to a sharehouse which is owned by Aunt Agnes and Aunt Beatrice.

Months into living in the house, Karl Stimpson marries Aunt Agnes, in order to evict the house-mates, however after his plans fail, he zaps Curio, sending him back in the past, leaving Nitro and Willow the only ones living in the share house.\n\nThe series was announced as a revamp in late 2008, however it is actually classified as a spinoff/sequel to the original show The Shak. The show features new theme song created by the same composer of the original shows theme which maintains the same 'surfie' melody but with a more prominent acoustic guitar, thus making the song have a more contemporary, rock feel. The opening segment has changed to a montage of Shaksters. The closing credits are now accompanied by bloopers accumulated throughout the show's shooting of its various segments and storylines.\nAfter Picasso left the show, a search for a shakster competition was launched in which they cast Libby Campbell as Willow.\nthe first series premiered on 20 April 2009 and finished airing on 17 July 2009.

The series then shifted to airing every weekday at the same time-slot, until the final episode aired on 20 April 2010.\n\nOn 26 May 2010, The Shak was announced as having breached the children’s television standards for endorsing a product by 'The Australian Communications and Media Authority'. The claim was made when Kendal, Drew and Beau were seen riding scooters with close up scenes during a prize segment. On the entertainment news site 'TV Tonight' comments on the story were mostly negative and damming to the ACMA.\n\nOn 13 January 2010, the Nine Network cancelled the show, claiming that it was an \"economic decision\".\n\n\n"}

A 12-episode second season, \"Tokyo Ghoul √A\" (pronounced \"Tokyo Ghoul Root A\"), which follows an original story, began airing on January 9, 2015, and concluded on March 27, 2015. In North America, Viz Media is publishing the manga while Funimation has licensed the anime series for streaming and home video distribution.\n\nA live-action film based on the manga was released in Japan on July 29, 2017. An anime adaptation based on the sequel manga \"Tokyo Ghoul:re\" began airing on April 3, 2018, with the series being split into two seasons.\n\n\"Tokyo Ghoul\" is set in an alternate reality where ghouls, cannibalistic 'monsters' who look exactly like normal people but can only survive by eating human flesh, live among the human population in secret, hiding their true nature in order to evade pursuit from the authorities. Including enhanced speed, senses, and regenerative ability, a regular ghoul is several times stronger than a normal human, has a skin resistant to ordinary piercing weapons and has at least one special predatory organ called a , which it can manifest and use as a weapon during combat. Another distinctive trait of ghouls is that when they are excited or hungry, the color of their sclera in both eyes turns black and their irises red. This mutation is known as .\n\nA half-ghoul can either be born naturally as a ghoul and a human's offspring, or artificially created by transplanting some ghoul organs into a human. In both cases, a half-ghoul is usually much stronger than a pure-blood ghoul. In the case of a half-ghoul, only one of the eyes undergoes the \"red eye\" transformation.\n\nThere is also the case of half-humans, hybrids of ghouls and humans that can feed like normal humans and lack a Kagune while possessing enhanced abilities, like increased speed and reaction speed, but shortened lifespans.\n\nTo hunt down the ghouls, several government-sponsored organizations such as the CCG were created worldwide, but struggle, due to the immense power of certain ghouls.\n\nThe story follows Ken Kaneki, a college student who barely survives a deadly encounter with Rize Kamishiro, his date who reveals herself as a ghoul. He is taken to the hospital in critical condition. After recovering, Kaneki discovers that he underwent a surgery that transformed him into a half-ghoul. This was accomplished because some of Rize's organs were transferred into his body, and now, like normal ghouls, he must consume human flesh to survive. The ghouls who manage the coffee shop \"Anteiku\" take him in and teach him to deal with his new life as a half-ghoul. Some of his daily struggles include fitting into the ghoul society, as well as keeping his identity hidden from his human companions, especially from his best friend Hideyoshi Nagachika.\n\nThe prequel series \"Tokyo Ghoul [Jack]\" follows the youths of Kishō Arima and Taishi Fura, two characters from the main series who become acquainted when they join forces to investigate the death of Taishi's friend by the hands of a ghoul, leading to Taishi eventually following Arima's path and joining the CCG (Commission of Counter Ghoul), the federal agency tasked into dealing with crimes related to ghouls as well.\n\nThe sequel series \"Tokyo Ghoul:re\" follows an amnesiac Kaneki under the new identity of Haise Sasaki (the result of horrific brain damage sustained from Kishō Arima). He is the mentor of a special team of CCG investigators called \"Quinx Squad\" that underwent a similar procedure as his, allowing them to obtain the special abilities of Ghouls in order to fight them, but still being able to live as normal humans.\n\n\"Tokyo Ghoul\" started as a manga series, written and drawn by Sui Ishida. It began serialization in 2011's 41st issue of \"Weekly Young Jump\", published by Shueisha on September 8, 2011, and the final chapter appeared in 2014's 42nd issue, released on September 18, 2014.

The introduction of this lottery on January 1, 1951 encouraged locals to obtain receipts for every purchase made with businesses with a monthly turnover of NT$200,000 (US$6,200) and above. As a result, the Finance Ministry collected NT$51 million (US$1.6 million) that year, representing a 75% increase from the NT$29 million (US$900,000) collected in 1950.\n\nThe lottery drawing in Taiwan falls on the 25th of every odd-numbered month, i.e., January, March, May, July, September and November. Six sets of eight-digit numbers are drawn and announced in a 'live' televised ceremony presented by an emcee, during which four models roll out the winning numbers from hand-turned lottery machines. Six prizes are announced during the ceremony. As of 2011, the “Special Prize” has been increased from NT$2 million (US$63,000) to NT$10 million (US$342,000). “First Prize” of NT$200,000 (USD $6,200) are offered to customers with the receipts matching the 8-digit numbers drawn. Subsequent prizes valued at NT$40,000 (US$1,300), NT$10,000 (US$313), NT$4,000 (US$136), NT$1,000 (US$31) and NT$200 (US$7) are available to receipt holders who match the final 7, 6, 5, 4 and 3 digits, respectively, on their invoices. In keeping with Taiwan's \"convenience store culture\", some major convenience store chains will redeem receipts for the smallest (NT$200) prize by allowing customers to buy that amount of products with a winning receipt; larger prizes must be redeemed at a government tax ministry office.\n\nIn conjunction to the 60th anniversary of the invoice lottery, the Finance Ministry announced a 33% increase in the total prize value to NT$7 billion (US$20 million) in 2011.\n\nThe Ministry started an e-invoice initiative in 2006 with the intention of facilitating e-commerce and reducing the number of receipts that need to be physically printed (currently about 11.5 billion every year). Lee Sush-der of the Ministry of Finance indicated that if 8 billion paper receipts could be replaced with e-invoices, 80,000 trees could be saved. The intermediate goal is to reduce the invoice process cost by NT$7.4 billion by 2013, with an expected total savings of NT$120 billion once comprehensive e-invoicing becomes the norm. E-receipts set for trial run.\n\n\n"}

The weapons master is specifically responsible for maintaining control of any weapon props (including firearms, knives, swords, bows, and staff weapons).\n\nThe weapons master is present whenever a scene with a weapon is to be shot. They present the actor with the weapon just prior to the scene, and they take control of the weapon when the scene is done. It is the primary function of the weapons master to ensure that the weapons under their control do not cause harm to the cast, crew or production property. Secondary functions include ensuring that the weapons can achieve the director's goals in terms of appearance and function, and that they meet the continuity requirements for the production. While some weapons masters work exclusively in film production, others are specialists outside of the media profession who are called in because of their familiarity, licensing and qualifications with the weapons in question. Some weapons masters (particularly in lower-budget productions) are also responsible for training the actors. Prior to the 1980s, weapons were frequently the responsibility of the property master or his assistant, but since then, it has become increasingly common in the industry for the property master to a hire a dedicated weapons master in order to reduce the burden on himself. However, it is still common for the property master to double as the weapons master, as a cost-saving measure, on productions where National Firearms Act-regulated firearms (such as machine guns or sawed-off shotguns) are not being used.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2542612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2542612", "title": "William Frank Carver", "text": "William Frank Carver\n\nWilliam Frank \"Doc\" Carver (May 7, 1851 – August 31, 1927) was a late 19th-century sharpshooter and the creator of a popular diving horse attraction. \n\nWilliam Frank Carver was born in Winslow, Illinois, to William Daniel Carver, a physician, and Deborah Tohapenes (Peters) Carver (1829–1907), who had migrated to Illinois from Pennsylvania in 1849. He had a younger brother, William Pitt, who became a farmer in Kansas, and a sister, May, who was born in May 1856 and died before the age of two.\n\nThere seems to be no creditable information about Carver's childhood, as the contradictions in stories he told classify them as entertainment rather than fact. For most of his adult life Carver gave the year of his birth as 1840, but it is likely he did so in order to enlarge the time frame needed to create stories of frontier experience for his admiring audiences after he became a showman. Carver's biographer, Raymond Thorp, wrote that Carver left home at a young age to assert his family's right to land in Minnesota that the Sioux had supposedly granted his grandfather, Jonathan Carver, and that during this period of time he lived with the Santee Sioux. This contention, however, like other claims made by Carver about his early life and never investigated by his biographer, does not withstand the scrutiny of reputable historians.\n\nCarver was trained as a dentist and hence acquired the nickname \"Doc\". He migrated to the West in 1872, where he practiced dentistry at Fort McPherson, Nebraska, and North Platte, Nebraska. He later attempted to distance himself from his early profession as a dentist, but the name \"Doc\" clung for life. At Fort McPherson he met Buffalo Bill Cody, Texas Jack Omohundro, and other well-known figures of the day. In November 1872 he moved to the newly organized Frontier County, Nebraska, in the company of Ena Raymonde, a southern belle from Georgia, whose brother W. H. \"Paddy\" Miles had recently established a trapper's camp known as Wolf's Rest on Medicine Creek. Carver took a claim near Wolf's Rest, and it was here that he began to acquire the target shooting, horseback riding, and hunting skills that would lead to his later success as a world-class marksman. Raymonde, a recognized markswoman, who had been challenged to shoot by Buffalo Bill Cody and Texas Jack Omohundro, is credited with playing a part in teaching Carver to shoot. An entry from Raymonde's 1872 journal reveals insights into Carver as a young man and also portrays the prevailing enthusiasm for shooting sports in the 19th century: \"Sunday afternoon we all…went to see a prairie-dog town! We went at half-speed or better all the way. Shot about 200 rounds; the Dr. doing the most of the business of shooting if not killing...\"\n\nAlthough Carver's time as a plainsman was short, he was on the western Nebraska frontier during an exciting era. Conflict between whites and Native Americans in the immediate area was decreasing but not eliminated. A remnant band of Lakota Sioux known as the Cut-off Sioux was encamped on Medicine Creek several miles to the east of Carver's cabin, and although his claim of having killed the Cut-offs' old war chief Whistler and two of his braves in late 1872 does not conform to the evidence, Carver was certainly in the area during a time of potential and sometimes real hostilities between whites and Native Americans.\n\nIt was a common practice during the late 19th century for well-heeled men, from the East and from abroad, to travel to the West to engage in hunting expeditions, and Carver undoubtedly had the opportunity to participate in several of these hunts. Buffalo Bill Cody wrote in his 1879 autobiography that Carver, who, in Cody's words, \"has recently acquired considerable notoriety as a rifle-shot,\" had joined a hunt at which Cody had been engaged as a guide by the Englishman Thomas P. Medley. Late in 1874 Carver spent two weeks practicing dentistry at Fort Sidney, after which he moved to Cheyenne, Wyoming, where he continued working as a dentist.\n\nCarver migrated to California in 1876, where he honed his shooting skills. At about this time he coined the moniker \"Evil Spirit,\" accompanied by a \"camp-fire tale\" that the name had been given to him by Spotted Tail, the famous chief of the Brulé Lakota, because Carver had felled a rare white buffalo. In December 1877 the Evil Spirit issued a challenge to all comers; he would use a rifle and the challenger could use a shotgun, and the targets would be glass balls thrown from the newly invented Bogardus glass ball trap. He also contended that he could hit more targets from horseback than a challenger could hit while standing on the ground. One of the first significant awards Carver won was for breaking 885 glass balls out of 1000 in San Francisco on February 22, 1878. The gold badge was capped with the image of a grizzly bear and bore an inscription that proclaimed Dr. W. F. Carver the \"Champion Rifle Shot of the World.\" Following his success in California, Carver recruited Texas Jack Omohundro, and the pair went on tour giving exhibitions of shooting prowess, with Carver demonstrating his expertise with the rifle while Omohundro displayed his proficiency with the pistol. These demonstrations included endurance contests as well as target competitions. An article in the \"New York Times\" on July 6, 1878, illustrates the reception Carver received: \nDr. W. F. Carver, the man who can put a bullet through a silver quarter while the coin is flying through the air, is an enlarged and revised edition of Buffalo Bill and Texas Jack. Being fresh from the broad plains of the untrammeled West, he has that delightful air of unconventionality to be found only in the land of the setting sun...\n\nDr. Carver is, no doubt, the best short-range marksman in the world. He gave his second exhibition at Deerfoot Park yesterday, and astonished everybody who saw him. He is as fine a specimen of fully developed manhood as ever walked on Manhattan Island. More than six feet high, every part of his body is built to correspond. His chest is so deep that it would take a powerful rifle to send a bullet through it. His shoulders are broad and high, and, altogether, he is exactly the man that ordinary people wouldn't put themselves out of the way to pick a quarrel with...\n\nThe scene of yesterday's shooting is worthy of description. A... table, on which were four rifles, several boxes of cartridges, and half a dozen score-books. Fifteen or 20 feet in front of this, again, a barrel and a man, the man taking the glass balls out of the barrel and throwing them in the air, and Dr. Carver breaking them with the bullets as fast as they appeared. Somebody was always at work loading a rifle. The marksman could fire them faster than the loaders could load. And they were the most remarkable rifles – breach-loaders, of course. When they were opened at the end one cartridge was shoved in after another, till it seemed as if the first one must surely be somewhere up by the muzzle...\n\nHe seldom misses what he fires at. Most of the time was taken up in shooting glass balls, filled with feathers. The balls were of the thinnest film of glass, slightly tinted, so as to be seen easily in the air, and when they broke, the feathers scattered in every direction...\n\nCarver also joined the ranks of western figures that embellished their frontier credentials by writing books. In 1878 he published a book, \"Life of Dr. Wm. F. Carver of California: Champion Rifle Shot of the World\", which contains entirely fictional versions of his early life but also includes extracts from the press coverage of his first shooting tour across the country.\n\nOn August 20, 1878, while in New Haven, Connecticut, Carver married Josephine Dailey, whom he had met on a previous trip. Little is known about the marriage, as Carver's biographer mentions Josephine only in several brief references describing the first few years following the marriage. It appears she was a marginal presence in Carver's life throughout his early years as a showman, and apparently they later separated. It is known that the Carvers had two children, Al and Lorena, both of whom were eventually involved in their father's diving horse act.\n\nAlmost from the beginning of his shooting career, Carver issued challenges to Captain Adam Henry Bogardus, who was recognized across the country and around the world as the champion trap shooter. Bogardus was Carver's senior by seventeen years, however, and had little to gain and much to lose by accepting a challenge from the newcomer.\n\nIn 1879 Carver set sail for a tour of Europe, where he shot in numerous exhibitions and matches, using shotgun, rifle, and pistol and shooting from horseback or from foot. He performed for ordinary citizens and for nobility, the most notable being the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII). He traveled to France, Belgium, Germany, and Austria, but most of the tour was in the British Isles, where he was booked for a long-term engagement at the Crystal Palace, in the wealthy Sydenham Hill district of London.\n\nRegardless of the considerable success he was having in Europe, the desire to stage a match with the great Bogardus was ever-present. So anxious was Carver to shoot against Bogardus that in 1881, in a challenge printed in the \"London Sportsman\", he offered to pay $250 toward expenses if Bogardus would travel to London for a match. Bogardus ignored this challenge. Carver returned to the United States in the fall of 1882 and again threw down the gauntlet. Early in 1883 Bogardus finally agreed to a live pigeon shoot in Louisville, Kentucky. The proposed match created much excitement in the shooting world, and a crowd of nearly 1000 gathered to watch two of the world's finest shooters compete. The \"Louisville Commercial\" ran the following article on February 21, 1883:\n\nCarver won the match 83 to 82, giving Bogardus the nudge needed to issue a challenge for further matches. In Chicago, Illinois, they shot two matches, one at live birds and one at clay pigeons, Carver winning both matches. From there they traveled to St. Louis, Missouri, where they found a message waiting for them from the Ligowsky Clay Pigeon Company. If they used Ligowsky's clay pigeons, the company would award a $7500 purse for the series of 25 matches. The match using clay pigeons that they had already shot in Chicago was counted as one match, another match was shot while they were in St. Louis, and from there they traveled to 23 more cities. Carver won 19 of the 25 matches and secured his position as one of the world's best marksmen.\n\nAbout this same time, Carver went into partnership with Buffalo Bill Cody to put a Wild West show on the road. The grand opening of the \"Wild West: Hon. W. F. Cody and Dr. W. F. Carver's Rocky Mountain and Prairie Exhibition\" was in Omaha, Nebraska, on May 17, 1883. Their series of shooting matches completed, both Carver and Bogardus joined the show in Omaha. The show was an immediate success, but the relationship between the two showmen, Carver and Cody, was contentious from the beginning. At the end of the season they parted ways and divided the assets by the flip of a coin. Cody then formed a partnership with the promoter and showman Nate Salsbury, and the show continued as \"Buffalo Bill's Wild West\".\n\nCarver put his own show on tour, also billed as the \"Wild West\". As the two shows crisscrossed the country for the next few years, Carver and Cody engaged in legal wrangling over various issues. The foremost points of dispute were the use of the name \"Wild West\" and Carver's assertion that Cody still owed him $27,000, which Carver claimed he had invested in the original show. In July 1885 both shows were in Connecticut, and the \"New York Times\" reported that \"An interminable row has broken out in this State between Dr. Carver, the marksman, and Buffalo Bill. They have been running rival shows under the same title of 'Wild West'.\" A trial, intended to end the suits and countersuits, was set for July 20, 1885. Cody failed to appear, however, so Carver agreed to dismiss his suit for $10,000 cash and Salsbury's offer to pay the court costs. Carver and Cody, once friends, remained bitter enemies for the rest of their lives.\n\nHis show broken up, Carver did not have the financial resources to reorganize. For the next few years he appeared as a featured act in several outdoor shows. By 1889 he had secured financial partners and organized his own show, \"Wild America\". Carver launched a worldwide tour, covering much of the same circuit as Cody, but the two shows avoided each other until August 1890, when Carver's show arrived in Hamburg, Germany, ahead of Cody's. Carver's claim to exclusive use of the available electric lights left Cody's show in the dark and added further hostility to the fierce competition between the two showmen. In December 1890 Carver shipped the \"Wild America\" troupe to Australia, where it was received with enthusiasm.\n\nIn conjunction with the outdoor exhibition, Carver had added a dramatic play, and on his return to the United States in early 1892 launched a tour of both productions across the country. An economic depression, however, had spread across the country by the early 1890s. In addition, a number of similar shows were touring the country, and they were no longer an entertainment novelty. For these and other reasons, Carver's show disbanded sometime in 1893. Carver had continued to give shooting exhibitions and to challenge competitors while on tour in the United States and abroad. After seventeen years as the \"Champion Shot of the World\" Carver gave one of his last public exhibitions in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 1896. Noting that Carver refused to tell his age but looked fifteen years younger than his stated age, the \"State Journal\" reported that \"Dr. W. F. Carver, the champion shot of the world, has been giving exhibitions of his wonderful skill in rifle, shotgun and horseback shooting this week at Lincoln park that mystified, surprised and astonished the audience present.\"\n\nAfter the breakup of his show Carver put together a smaller show, which featured trained animals and shooting exhibitions. His biographer wrote that Carver added the diving horse act to the show in Kansas City, Missouri, in August 1894. Carver told several versions of a story describing an exciting escape from bandits, which inspired the diving horse act, but those who remembered him in Nebraska said he got the idea after plunging on horseback off a bank into a deep hole in Medicine Creek. Over the next few years the other acts were eliminated, and the diving horse exhibition became Carver's primary endeavor. Included in the touring company were his son, Al, who helped train and take care of the horses, and his daughter, Lorena, said to be the first rider. By the time his future daughter-in-law, Sonora Webster, joined the show in 1924, Carver had two diving teams on the road, each performing in a different city.\n\nIn June 1927, Carver attended an Old-Timers' Convention in Norfolk, Nebraska, where he enjoyed reuniting with other frontiersmen. Following the convention he traveled to Omaha, Nebraska, and while there received word that his favorite horse had drowned following a dive into the Pacific Ocean. Sonora later wrote that the loss of the horse coupled with failing health seemed to diminish Carver's desire to live. He died on August 31, 1927, in Sacramento, California, and was buried beside his mother and sister in Winslow, Illinois. Sonora remembered that Carver was a stern and taciturn man but loved his horses and insisted that they be given the best of care.\n\nFollowing Carver's death, the diving horse show continued with Al Carver at the helm. In October 1928 Al Carver and Sonora Webster were married. A short time later he signed a contract for a season's engagement at Atlantic City's Steel Pier, and the diving horse act became a permanent fixture there for several years. Sonora Webster Carver lost her eyesight in 1931 when her horse \"Red Lips\" dove into the tank off-balance, causing her to hit the water face first. She failed to close her eyes quickly enough, resulting in detached retinas. Though now blinded, Sonora continued with the act for eleven years. Her younger sister, Arnette Webster (later French), had joined the show in 1930 and started diving in 1931.\n\nAl and Sonora Carver retired in 1942. The act finally closed as a result of pressure from animal rights groups in the 1970s. Sonora Carver, however, always contended that the horses were never forced to dive and, in fact, enjoyed the act. She died in September 2003, at the age of 99. Her early career inspired the 1991 Disney movie \"Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken\", starring Gabrielle Anwar and based on Carver's memoir, \"A Girl and Five Brave Horses\".\n\n"}
