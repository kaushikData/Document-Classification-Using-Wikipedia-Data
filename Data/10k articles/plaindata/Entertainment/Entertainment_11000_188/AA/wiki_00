The film was written by Teddi Sherman and Robert Aldrich, who also directed.\n\nIn 1870, a shipment of $100,000 being transported by stagecoach to Galveston, Texas, is the object of a tug-of-war in the desert between Zack Thomas (Sinatra) and Joe Jarrett (Martin), who first must stave off an outlaw band led by Matson (Bronson).\n\nLater, in Galveston, Thomas and Jarrett become rivals in a bid to open a waterfront casino. Each has a new romantic attachment, as well, with the beauties Elya (Anita Ekberg) and Maxine (Ursula Andress), respectively. They eventually must join forces to hold off the villainous Matson and a corrupt banker, Burden (Victor Buono), to keep their new gambling boat afloat.\n\nAdlrich announced the film in November 1960 as \"Two for Texas\", from a script by Teddy Sherman. The proposed stars were Lisa Kirk, Martine Carol and Aldo Ray. \n\nIn January 1963 Dean Martin signed to make the film. At that stage his female co-stars would be Anita Ekberg and (it was hoped) Gina Lollobrigida. Warners, who had just made \"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?\" with Aldrich, agreed to finance.\n\nIn March, Frank Sinatra agreed to co star. This meant the film would be a co production between Warners, Aldrich's company, the Associates and Aldrich, Martin's company, Claude Productions, and Sinatra's, Essex Productions.\n\nAt one stage the role of Elya was originally intended for Sophia Loren, who had already worked with Sinatra in \"The Pride and the Passion\". Although she was offered $1,000,000 for four weeks of work, Loren turned the part down.\n\nLollobrigida decided not to do the film. In May Ursula Andress joined the cast and the film was retitled \"Four for Texas\".\n\nAldrich later said he wrote the first draft of the script but \"you could change that over and over and it was still a disaster.\"\nFilming started in May 1963.\n\n\"4 for Texas\" was filmed in 1.85:1 aspect ratio on 35-mm Technicolor film. Its promotional trailer features Ursula Andress in specially shot footage addressing the audience.\n\nDuring production, the relationship between star Sinatra and director Aldrich became strained. Aldrich felt the film was not a success, and cited problems with his own script, as well as Sinatra's lack of enthusiasm for the project—Aldrich calculated that Sinatra worked a total of only 80 hours during 37 days of filming.\n\nAt one stage, Bette Davis was going to make a cameo.\n\nThe film had its U.S. premiere on December 18, 1963. Forty-three years after its original premiere, \"4 for Texas\" was presented at the Turin Film Festival on November 12, 2006.\n\nIts first DVD release arrived on November 20, 2001, and the second release (as part of The Rat Pack collection of \"Ocean's 11\" and \"Robin and the 7 Hoods\") was on June 13, 2006.\n\nIt was nominated for the Golden Laurel as \"Top Action Drama\", ultimately coming in fourth.\n\n\n"}

The word comes from Latin \"aēneus\" or \"ahēneus\", \"brazen\", from \"aes\", \"copper alloy\".\n\nWhile the size of individual Roman military units, or Alae, may have varied, any Ala would make extensive use of both acoustical and visual signaling in communications and had an assigned banner bearer (Vexillarius) and at least one Aeneator. A variety of instruments were used by aeneators, including the buccina, cornu, tuba, and lituus. In addition to their roles within battle, aeneators would also be used for processionals and games, particularly in marching home from war\n\nAeneators who blew a cornu (a G-shaped horn made of brass) were known as cornicines; those who blew a tuba (a straight bronze horn with a slight flare at the end) were known as tubicens; those who blew a buccina (a C-shaped horn made of bronze or silver or animal horn) were known as bucinators. Cornicens and tubicens mostly performed uncomplicated tactical signaling on the battlefield, and therefore were not accorded special status in the military unit. They had call duties in the barracks, just as other commonly conscripted soldiers had. By contrast, the bucinator was seen as a specially-skilled member of the unit who was capable of performing a wider repertoire and was used to perform a variety of ceremonial duties. Many units accorded bucinators immunis status, and there were equestrian bucinatores that served as cavalry buglers.\n\nAeneators were not the only skilled or specialized players of wind instruments in Ancient Roman culture.

{"id": "172839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=172839", "title": "BattleBots", "text": "BattleBots\n\nBattleBots is an American robot combat television series. Competitors design and operate remote-controlled armed and armored machines designed to fight in an arena combat elimination tournament. For five seasons, \"BattleBots\" aired on the American Comedy Central and was hosted by Bil Dwyer, Sean Salisbury, and Tim Green. Comedy Central's first season premiered on August 23, 2000, and its fifth and last season ended on December 21, 2002.\n\nA six-episode revival series premiered on ABC on June 21, 2015, to generally favorable reviews and ratings. Additionally, ABC renewed \"BattleBots\" for a seventh season, which premiered on June 23, 2016. \n\nThough not officially cancelled, \"BattleBots\" was removed from the ABC website's list of current reality shows. In February 2018, Discovery Channel and Science picked up the show for its eighth season, which began airing on May 11, 2018.\n\n\"BattleBots\" is an offshoot of the original American version of \"Robot Wars\", the brainchild of Marc Thorpe. Robot Wars had financial backing from Sm:)e communications, a New York record company. The Thorpe/Sm:)e partnership broke up in 1997, starting many years of legal wrangling between Thorpe and Profile Records (the former Sm:)e communications). Profile licensed \"Robot Wars\" to a UK production company and \"Robot Wars\" ran for seven years as a popular television program in the UK, before being revived for 2016.\n\nThe robot builders left behind in San Francisco formed BattleBots, Inc. and began a series of competitions. The first was held in Long Beach, California in August 1999 and streamed online, attracting 40,000 streams. Lenny Stucker, a television producer known for his work on telecasts of professional boxing, was in attendance, and showed interest in being involved with \"BattleBots\"—believing the concept of robot combat was \"hip\" and having shown an interest in technology. Stucker made changes to the competition's format and presentation to make it more suitable for television, including elements reminiscent of boxing (such as a red and blue corner) and shifting to a single-elimination format. The creators tried selling the competition as a television series to networks such as CBS, NBC, HBO, and Showtime—but they failed to understand the concept of the program or take it seriously. A second event was held as a pay-per-view in Las Vegas in 1999; the PPV was in turn, used as a pilot to pitch the show again, with a higher rate of success.\n\nAmong the networks interested was Comedy Central, who would ultimately pick up the program. Debbie Liebling, the network's Senior Vice President of original programming and development, felt that the concept would appeal to the network's young adult demographic, explaining that \"it was really funny, and really nerdy. The Internet was not a big thing yet, so the nerd culture wasn't so celebrated. It was sports for the nerdy person, I guess.\" Co-creator Greg Munson viewed the deal as a double-edged sword; it gave \"BattleBots\" an outlet and a larger budget, but the network insisted on the addition of comedic aspects to \"BattleBots\" as a program, such as sketches involving contestants. However, the competition itself was not affected by this mandate; Liebling described the final product as being \"a parody of a sports show without being a parody\". Munson lamented that the network had also ignored his suggestion for the co-host role to be filled by \"attractive geek girls\" with sufficient knowledge to speak with builders, having elected to \"[keep] throwing bigger and better hot babes at it\", such as Carmen Electra.\n\nDespite this, viewership and awareness of \"BattleBots\" grew progressively over time; contestants Christian Carlberg and Lisa Winter would be invited to appear on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\", \"BattleBots\" beat \"South Park\" as Comedy Central's highest-rated program for a period during season 3, competitor interest grew, and licensing deals also emerged. The success of \"BattleBots\", however, resulted in competition from other broadcasters; TLC introduced a competing program, \"Robotica\", while other channels imported episodes of the British \"Robot Wars\" series. By 2002, the program had begun to face further difficulties; Munson felt that the bouts had become \"homogenized\" because the participants had \"perfected\" the sport of robot fighting, leading to a lack of innovation in robot designs and strategies. Furthermore, \"BattleBots\" had sued Anheuser-Busch and its advertising agency for producing and airing a commercial during Super Bowl XXXVII that parodied the program and featured a robot greatly resembling one from \"BattleBots\" (this lawsuit, however, would be dismissed in 2004, after a judge ruled that the ad was a parody protected by fair use). In September 2002, Comedy Central cancelled \"BattleBots\" after its fifth season, \"BattleBots 5.0\". Viacom would acquire full control of the network in April 2003; Stucker believed that Comedy Central had become \"tired\" of the program, and Roski stated that Viacom had wanted to shift Comedy Central back towards traditional comedy programming.\n\nIn December 2014, ABC announced that it had picked up a six-episode revival of \"BattleBots\", produced by Whalerock Industries, to premiere in June 2015. Roski and Munson served as executive producers, joined by Lloyd Braun. The revival drew an average viewership of 5.4 million in its Sunday-night timeslot, with a 1.9 share in the 18-49 demographic. In November 2015, ABC announced that it had renewed the \"BattleBots\" revival for a second season, which expanded the competition to a 56-team field. \n\nAfter ABC declined to renew the revival for a third season, the series was picked up by Discovery Channel and sister network Science. On April 18, 2018, Discovery and Science channels announced that a new season would begin on Friday, May 11, at 8 PM ET/PT on Discovery Channel and Wednesday, May 16 at 9 PM ET/PT on Science Channel. The announcement reported that amongst the bots would be returning favorites Tombstone, Minotaur, Chomp, Witch Doctor, Bronco, Bombshell, Bite Force, and Yeti. Chris Rose and Kenny Florian return to call the action, provide background information about the bots and teams, and offer commentary. Jessica Chobot served again as the sideline reporter. Faruq Tauheed returned as the ring announcer.\n\nFor the first five seasons, \"BattleBots\" was hosted by Bil Dwyer, Sean Salisbury, and Tim Green. Correspondents included former \"Baywatch\" actresses Donna D'Errico, Carmen Electra, and Traci Bingham, former Playboy Playmate Heidi Mark, comedian Arj Barker and identical twins Randy and Jason Sklar. Bill Nye was the show's \"technical expert\". The show's match announcer was longtime boxing ring announcer Mark Beiro.\n\nThe 2015 edition was hosted by Molly McGrath, with Chris Rose and former UFC fighter Kenny Florian as commentators. The battle arena announcer is Faruq Tauheed, and Alison Haislip conducts interviews on the sidelines and behind the scenes. The judges are engineer and NASA astronaut Leland Melvin, \"Nerdist News\" anchor Jessica Chobot and visual effects artist Fon Davis.\n\nFor the 2016 season, Samantha Ponder was added as host, replacing Molly McGrath. The returning judges are Fon Davis, Jessica Chobot, and Leland Melvin, as well as celebrity guest judges actor Clark Gregg, \"MythBusters\" host and former Battlebots builder Adam Savage, NFL tightend Vernon Davis, and YouTube star Michael Stevens a.k.a. Vsauce.\n\nFor the 2018 season, Rose, Florian and Tauheed all returned in their roles. Chobot and Haislip switched their roles, with Chobot becoming the new sideline reporter and Haislip one of the rotating judges. Other judges include former \"Battlebots\" competitors Lisa Winter, Derek Young, Grant Imahara and Mark Setrakian.\n\n\nRobots at BattleBots tournaments were separated into four weight classes in seasons 1-5. The weight limits increased slightly over time. At the final tournaments the classes were:\n\n\n\"Walking\" robots (\"StompBots\") propelled by means other than wheels were initially given a 50% weight bonus. The rules changed following the victory of a heavyweight StompBot (Son of Whyachi) at BattleBots 3.0. For BattleBots 4.0 and beyond only a 20% weight bonus was given to walkers and the technical rules specified that walking mechanisms not use cam operated walking mechanisms as they were functionally too similar to wheel operation. Since the rules change, walking robots have entered the competition, but none has achieved any success beyond preliminary rounds.\n\nStarting in season 6, there are no longer separate weight classes while the weight limit for heavyweights was increased from 220-pounds to 250-pounds.\n\nMatches are three minutes long. During a match, two robots do their best to destroy each other using whatever means available. The match begins by a series of lights that flash from yellow to green. The original Comedy Central version used a standard Christmas tree as seen in the sport of drag racing; the ABC revival uses just one box of lights that flash yellow three times, and then flash green.\n\nThere are only two events that cause the match to be paused and people enter the BattleBox. One is the event that the robots are stuck together and cannot separate or that both have simultaneously become immobilized. The other scenario is that one or both 'bots have caught on fire. In that case, the people entering the BattleBox are equipped with a fire extinguisher.\n\nIf a robot is unable to move for ten seconds, because it is too badly damaged or it is stuck on the arena hazards, it is declared knocked out. In the Comedy Central version, the driver could also call a \"tap-out\" to forfeit the match if his or her robot is about to be destroyed. This ends the match ten seconds later; the opposing driver is \"asked\" (but not instructed) not to attack during the ten-second count.\n\nIf both robots survive the three minutes, three judges distribute a total of 45 points (15 points a judge, 5 points per judge per category) over three categories. The robot with the higher score wins. The judging categories are Aggression, Strategy, and Damage. In Season 6 (June/July 2015), the judging categories were Aggression, Damage, Strategy, and Control. A robot who hangs back safely from its opponent will not get many Aggression points; one in there fighting the whole time, however, will. The Strategy category is about how well a robot exploits its opponent's weaknesses, protects its own, and handles the hazards. A robot driving over the kill saws will lose points here, unless it had good reason to do so, while a robot that is able to attack its opponent's weak areas will gain points. The Damage category is for how much damage the bot can deal to its opponent while remaining intact itself.\n\nThe winner moves on; the loser is eliminated from the tournament.\n\nAt the end of the tournament, a series of 'rumbles' or 'melee rounds' is typically held in each weight class, allowing robots that survived the main tournament to fight in a 'free for all' in a 5-minute match. Occasionally there are too many robots for one rumble, and multiple rumbles are held with the top surviving bots competing in a final event.\nDuring the Season 5 Heavyweight rumble (the first rumble of that competition), a sheared-off robot part went through the Lexan arena roof and fell (harmlessly) into the audience. Because of this, the rest of the rumbles were canceled due to safety concerns.\n\nThe BattleBox is a 48' x 48' square arena designed to protect the drivers, officials, and audience from flying shrapnel and charging bots. It was originally designed by Pete Lampertson. For the 2015 season, Pete is still overseeing the box with the help of Matt Neubauer. It has a steel floor and steel-framed walls and roof paneled with thick, bulletproof polycarbonate plastic. The teams bring their robots in through doorways, which are sealed after all humans have exited. The drivers control their machines from outside the sealed arena.\n\nArena hazards are intended to make fights more interesting and unpredictable, and to reward drivers who can avoid the hazards while pushing or carrying their opponent into them. Hazards from the first five seasons include (and where noted, omitted for the later ABC/Discovery/Science Channel-shown seasons):\n\n\nTournament Winners: November 2000, Las Vegas: (Winners shown in bold)\n\nTournament Winners: May 2001, Treasure Island (Winners shown in bold)\n\nTournament Winners: November 2001, Treasure Island: (Winners shown in bold)\n\nTournament Winners: May 2002, Treasure Island: (Winners shown in bold)\n\nWinner: Bite Force\n\nWinner: Tombstone\n\n\n"}

It belongs to the borough of Sé, and it has been a mixed neighborhood since its beginning, where free African-Brazilians and/or a mixture of Native-Brazilians, Blacks and Portuguese descendants lived. Later, more European immigrants arrived, such as Spaniards, Germans, English, French, Belgians, and Italians. The Italian community became more numerous than all the others during the first decades of the twentieth century. (source: São Paulo sections site: \"Bairros de São Paulo\")\n\nBela Vista hosts a large number of Italian cantinas or eateries, restaurant and/or delicatessens.Renowned theaters, such as the state-funded Teatro Sergio Cardoso and few smaller ones on Rua dos Ingleses/Morro dos Ingleses and Avenida 9 de Julho area, such as the teatros Bibi Ferreira and Maria Della Costa. Most theatres nowadays tend to concentrate on Avenida Brigadeiro Luis Antonio with Teatro Abril being the most important venue of musical presentations such as \"Miss Saigon\", \"Beauty and the Beast\", and \"The Phantom of the Opera\". Towards the end of the twentieth century, parts of Bexiga became more decayed and dilapidated because its more affluent middle-class moved to newer areas in the suburbs. Although most of the clubs and bars moved from Bela Vista to Itaim Bibi and Vila Madalena in the late 1980s and mid 1990s, Bexiga still has a somewhat vibrant nightlife and is the home of many descendants of Italians and young professionals and students that enjoy the urban atmosphere and the Avenida Paulista area nearby. Bela Vista is also the home of the Vai-Vai Samba School, the oldest one in São Paulo.\n\nOur Lady Achiropita Roman Catholic church on Rua 13 de Maio is an important charity and cultural center in the neighborhood. Famous for the Achiropita procession and the street Italian food fair all weekends in August, the community caters to the needs of poor children and their families in the section and promotes integration of diversity into worship, by adding an African-Brazilian flavor to its masses and baptismal ceremonies (source: Nossa Senhora Achiropita site).\n\nThe Menino Jesus (Infant Jesus) children's hospital, the Perola Byington women's hospital, The German Osvaldo Cruz hospital, the Hospital Paulistano, Hospital Santa Catarina and Hospital Sirio-Libanes—a cardiovascular and cancer reference institutions,-- as well as vaccine institutes such as the Instituto Pasteur on Avenida Paulista, and other important laboratories and clinics are located in the Bela Vista region.\n\nHigher education institutions such as Fundacao Getulio Vargas's Schools of Business (EAESP), Economics (EESP) and Law (EDESP), Colegio Objectivo, the Centro Universitario Ibero-Americano, and elite private schools also make their home in Bela Vista, which claims parts of the Avenida Paulista's São Paulo financial center as within its jurisdiction.\n\nThe Paulista shopping mall, The Cidade de Sao Paulo shopping mall, the Hipermercado Extra, and the Pao de Acucar supermarket chain also make their home in the Bela Vista/Av. Paulista/Paraiso/Jardim Paulista region.\n\nBela Vista is also known as \"Bexiga\" ou \"Bixiga.\" The saying goes that an infection of the bladder (\"bexiga\" in Portuguese) was common in the section in the late nineteenth century and beginning of the twentieth century when it still had a few farms, and residents were labeled with that pejorative. Others say that an Italian or Portuguese resident known for drinking at the taverns of Bela Vista until late night, had a belly as round and big as a party balloon (also \"bexiga\" in Portuguese), so, the section was nicknamed after him.\n\nUntil recently, the Bela Vista community organized the celebration of the anniversary of the City of São Paulo by offering a huge long cake to the population, measuring the age of São Paulo for each year in the metric system. Lack of funding and greed on the part of revellers who grabbed chunks of the cake and stuffed Tupperware containers to take home, which made the cake disappear in seconds, seem to have stopped the annual event on January 25, the Catholic feast of the Conversion of Paul, the apostle, and anniversary of the foundation of São Paulo de Pirapitininga by chief Tibirica' & the Spanish Jesuits Anchieta and Nobrega.

{"id": "5168315", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5168315", "title": "Bewnans Ke", "text": "Bewnans Ke\n\nBewnans Ke (\"The Life of Saint Ke\") is a Middle Cornish play on the life of Saint Kea or Ke, who was venerated in Cornwall, Brittany and elsewhere. It was written around 1500 but survives only in an incomplete manuscript from the second half of the 16th century. The play was entirely unknown until 2000, when it was identified among the private collection of J. E. Caerwyn Williams, which had been donated to the National Library of Wales after his death the previous year. The discovery proved one of the most significant finds in the study of Cornish literature and language.\n\n\"Bewnans Ke\" is one of only two known Cornish plays based on a saint's life; this and other evidence suggests some relationship with the other such work, \"Beunans Meriasek\". The story has much correspondence with a French text, a translation of a lost medieval Latin hagiography of Kea, allowing gaps in the narrative to be tentatively filled. The play is divided into two distinct sections, which may indicate that it was intended for a two-day performance. The first section deals with the deeds and miracles of Kea, including his conflicts with the tyrannical king Teudar. The second is a long Arthurian episode, describing King Arthur's wars with the Romans and with his nephew Mordred; it does not mention Kea in its current form.\n\n\"Bewnans Ke\" survives in one manuscript, NLW MS 23849D, now held at the National Library of Wales. The play has no title in the text; the National Library gave it its modern name after consulting scholars of Cornish. The manuscript had been in the personal collection of J. E. Caerwyn Williams, chair of Irish at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth. After Williams' death in 1999, his widow Gwen Williams donated his papers to the National Library in 2000, and the previously unknown play was identified by Graham Thomas during the cataloging process. Thomas publicized his discovery in the \"National Library of Wales Journal\" in 2002, and the manuscript was subsequently repaired and studied.\n\nThe manuscript was evidently created in the second half of the 16th century by a scribe copying a document dating perhaps to around 1500. Several leaves are missing, including the entire beginning and ending and, in two places, the copyist complains about the poor quality of the original. The provenance is entirely unknown, but the language is Middle Cornish akin to that of \"Beunans Meriasek\", the only other surviving Cornish play concerning a saint's life. This and other similarities between the plays suggest that both were composed around the same time and in the same milieu, most probably at Glasney College in Penryn. If this is correct, \"Bewnans Ke\" may have been performed in the still-extant \"Playing Place\" in the nearby village of that name, where \"Beunans Meriasek\" is known to have been performed.\n\nThe play clearly relies on traditional material about Kea, which is known to have been circulated in a Latin hagiography written as early as the 12th century. This work is lost, but a French translation published in Albert le Grand's \"Lives of the Saints of Brittany\" in 1633 survives. This French \"Life of Kea\" has much correspondence with the Cornish text, and has been used to fill in gaps in the action. \"Bewnans Ke\" was initially thought to represent two plays, as in its incomplete state it appears to consist of two distinct sections: one on the deeds of Kea and the other on the doings of King Arthur, in which Kea is not mentioned. However, comparison with the \"Life\" shows that Arthurian material had been added to the saint's story at an early period. This occurs in places that would be missing in the play, leading some scholars to regard it as a single work.\n\nThe play consists of two long parts, one concerning the deeds and miracles of Saint Kea, and the other concerning King Arthur's conflicts with the Romans and with his nephew Mordred. The Arthurian section is longer, and is largely adapted from some version of the account in Geoffrey of Monmouth's \"Historia Regum Britanniae\".\n\nThe lost beginning of the play probably recounted the events of Kea's early life, such as his birth to a noble family, his election as bishop, and his subsequent abdication in favour of life as a hermit. The extant text begins with Kea's resurrection of a deceased shepherd and his departure for Cornwall by either boat or flying flagstone. In Cornwall, he soon comes into conflict with the king, Teudar (the Breton Tewdwr Mawr of Penwith and Cornouaille), but is eventually given land near the king's favourite hunting grounds in Kea parish. The next section is missing, but context suggests the narrative would have followed the French \"Life\", which has Kea giving refuge to a stag being hunted by Teudar. In retaliation Teudar's men take Kea's oxen and then break three of the saint's teeth. The manuscript picks back up as Kea generates a holy well and cures a leper who gives him additional land. Stags come from the woods to plough Kea's fields in place of the oxen. Teudar tries to make recompense for the injury he has caused Kea, and offers him any land he can empark before Teudar gets out of a bath. With Owbra's aid Kea makes a concoction that causes Teudar to get stuck in the bath, allowing him to take much of Teudar's land. The rest of the first section is missing, but probably dealt with Kea's return to Cléder in Brittany.\n\nThe second section begins as King Arthur receives a long list of nobles at his court, including names familiar from Geoffrey of Monmouth such as Duke Cador, Augelus of Scotland, Bedivere, a different Ke (Sir Kay), Mordred, and Gawain. The scene jumps to Rome, where Emperor Lucius has heard that Arthur refuses to recognize him. He sends twelve emissaries to exact tribute from Arthur. A gap occurs just after the emissaries arrive in Britain and greet the king. In the next extant section, Arthur refuses to pay tribute and sends the legates back to Lucius empty-handed. Lucius confers with his advisors, and decides to raise his forces against Arthur. Leaving his nephew Mordred in charge, Arthur says his goodbyes to Guinevere and then departs for France to meet Lucius. The two armies battle, and Arthur defeats and kills Lucius, and sends his severed head back to Rome. Meanwhile, Mordred and Guinevere conspire to usurp the throne, and Mordred is crowned king in Arthur's place. Arthur hears of this treachery and assembles his counsellors, while Mordred allies with the Saxon Cheldric. Arthur returns to Britain, and the two armies clash. The text breaks off during a scene with Guinevere in the castle; the end is missing. If it followed the \"Life\", Kea would have re-entered the picture. In the \"Life\", Kea is summoned to mediate between Arthur and Mordred, but he comes to realize that the endeavour is futile. He heads back to Brittany, stopping in Winchester where he castigates Guinevere. The remorseful queen enters a convent. Kea returns to Cléder, where he eventually dies peacefully.\n\nScholars have pointed out a number of similarities with \"Beunans Meriasek\". The two are comparable in subject matter: they are the only known vernacular plays on saints' hagiographies to have been produced in Britain. The language in both works is similar and dates to the same era, leading to the conclusion that they originate around the same time and place. Both plays include the court at Goodern of the tyrannical king Teudar, who may be intended as a parody of King Henry VII after his crushing of the Cornish Rebellion of 1497. As such, it is thought that \"Bewnans Ke\", like \"Beunans Meriasek\", was written at Glasney College at the beginning of the 16th century. It is possible that the surviving manuscripts of the two plays were brought to Wales together.\n\nThe substantial length and distinct nature of the two sections may imply that the play was intended for performance over the course of two days, as was the case with \"Beunans Meriasek\". \"Beunans Meriasek\" contains diagrams at the end of each section indicating the completion of a day's performance; these occur in places that would be missing in the \"Bewnans Ke\" manuscript. John T. Koch finds the first section to be more dramatic and effective, calling the second section \"stolid\", though he notes its importance to Arthurian studies. On top of Cornish, the text is peppered with lines and words in English, Latin, and Anglo-Norman French, particularly in the second section. The stage directions are mostly in Latin, but some are in Cornish and English, though the latter may have been added later.\n\nThe discovery of the play was the first addition to the corpus of historical Cornish literature since John Tregear's \"Homilies\" were found in 1949. It is also of vast importance to the study of the Cornish language, as it provides valuable evidence of the state of Cornish in the Tudor period, which was transitional between Middle and Late Cornish. Many words in the play are not attested in any other sources. The Cornish stage directions, though relatively few, contain some of the oldest known Cornish prose.\n\nA scholarly edition of the play was published in March 2007 by the University of Exeter Press in affiliation with the National Library of Wales; it was edited by Graham Thomas and Nicholas Williams. The National Library also created a digital copy of the manuscript which was released on the Library's web page in 2006. Prior to publication, study of the play was aided by a summary of the text by O. J. Padel, and a tentative translation by Michael Polkinhorn. These were released on the web and removed when the Thomas and Williams edition was published. Prior to this, in 2006 Kesva an Taves Kernewek (The Cornish Language Board) published an edition of the play edited by Ken George, entitled \"Bywnans Ke\"; this caused some friction with the National Library.\n\n"}

Books are selected and endorsed by a panel of judges, and members choose which book they would like to receive, similar to how the club originally operated when it began in 1926. Members can also discuss the books with fellow members in an online forum.\n\nIn late 2015, in concert with the club's 90th year, the club announced a relaunch into its current iteration. Within two years, the club had grown its membership to more than 100,000 members, primarily millennial women, and the club's presence on social media grew to over 300,000 Instagram followers. Approximately 75% of the club's titles are by up-and-coming authors, and 80% of titles are fiction. The club has also worked with a series of celebrity guest judges who bring broader awareness to new titles, and continues producing its own versions of books that feature special endpapers and casings. In 2016, the club launched a Book of the Year award. In 2017, the club debuted its first ever television advertisement called \"Monthly\".\n\nThe club has a tradition of focusing on debut and emerging writers, and is known for having helped launch the careers of some of the most acclaimed authors in American literary history. In 1926 (its first year in operation), the Club featured Ernest Hemingway's \"The Sun Also Rises\". In 1936 (its tenth year), the Club selected \"Gone with the Wind\" by unknown author Margaret Mitchell. Today, the book remains the second favorite of American readers (after the Bible). Mitchell wrote: \"I wanted to thank [Book of the Month] from the bottom of my heart for selecting my book. It was quite the most exciting and unexpected thing that ever happened to me.\" In 1951 (its 25th year), the club distributed its 100 millionth book and selected J.D. Salinger's \"The Catcher in the Rye\", which became both the most-censored and the most-taught book in America. In 1978, the Club selected \"By the Rivers of Babylon\", the first book by Nelson DeMille, who later wrote: \"I will be forever grateful to Book of the Month for ensuring that my first book, \"By the Rivers of Babylon\", was not my last. When the Club selected \"Babylon\" in 1978, it reached hundreds of thousands of additional readers and became an instant best-seller.\"\n\nHarry Scherman was a copywriter for the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency in 1916 when he set out to create the \"Little Leather Library\". With his partners Max Sackheim, and Charles and Albert Boni, Scherman began a mail order service that offered \"30 Great Books For $2.98\" (miniature reprints \"bound in limp Redcroft\") and sold 40 million copies in its first five years. Sackheim and Scherman then founded their own ad agency devoted entirely to marketing books.\n\nThe problems of building interest in a new book led Scherman to create, along with Sackheim and Robert Haas, the Book-of-the-Month Club in 1926. As Scherman explained it, the club itself would be a \"standard brand\". \"It establishes itself as a sound selector of good books and sells by means of its own prestige. Thus, the prestige of each new title need not be built up before becoming acceptable,\" he explained later. After starting with 4,000 subscribers, the club had more than 550,000 within twenty years. The size of the club did in fact create the Book of the Month Club as a brand. Being a \"Book of the Month Club\" selection was used to promote books to the general public.\n\nBook of the Month Club was acquired by Time Inc. in 1977; Time Inc. merged with Warner Communications in 1989. In 2000, the Book-of-the-Month Club, Inc. merged with Doubleday Direct, Inc. The resulting company, Bookspan, was a joint venture between Time Warner and Bertelsmann until 2007 when Bertelsmann took over complete ownership. Following a series of investment transactions, the club is currently owned by parent company Pride Tree Holdings, Inc.\n\nThe club operates a subscription program, similar to other box subscription services, where customers select a membership plan for a set period of time (3-months, 6-months or 12-months) and books are shipped to all members during the first seven days of the month.\n\nHistorically, when the club operated through mail-order catalogs, membership involved a \"negative response\" system whereby a member was shipped the monthly selection on a particular date if the selection was not declined before that date. Members had the option to respond by declining the selection or opting to order another book or merchandise instead. No response was deemed acceptance of the selection.\n\nIn late 2016, the club announced its first annual Book of the Year Award, the finalists for which are chosen by the club's members. The award is called the \"Lolly\", in tribute to \"Lolly Willowes\", the first book selected by the club back in 1926. In 2017, the award added a $10,000 prize, and the winner was The Hearts Invisible Furies by Irish author John Boyne.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "65572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65572", "title": "Calcutta auction", "text": "Calcutta auction\n\nA Calcutta auction is an open auction held in conjunction with a golf tournament, horse race or similar contest with multiple entrants. It is popular in backgammon, the Melbourne Cup, and college basketball pools during March Madness\n\nBidding for each contestant begins in random order, with only one contestant being bid upon at any time. Accordingly, participants (originally in Calcutta, India, from where this technique was first recorded by the Colonial British) bid among themselves to \"buy\" each of the contestants, with each contestant being assigned to the highest bidder. The contestant will then pay out to the owner a predetermined proportion of the pool depending on how it performs in the tournament. While variations in payoff schedules exist, in an NCAA Basketball tournament (64 teams, single elimination) the payoffs could be: 1 win - 0.25%, 2 wins - 2%, 3 wins - 4%, 4 wins - 8%, 5 wins - 16%, tournament winner with 6 wins - 32%.\n\nThe precise rules of a Calcutta can vary from place to place; many tournament organizers employ software programs that apply odds and determine win-place-show amounts. Perhaps the simplest and most common Calcutta payout is 70 percent of the pool to the \"owner\" of the winning tournament team, 30 percent to the \"owner\" of the second-place tournament team.\n\nAn interesting element of Calcutta auctions is in determining an appropriate wager for each contestant, as the payoff will directly hinge on the size of the pot and thereby the size of the bids being placed. Thus the value of each team fluctuates during the course of the betting. For example, even if a bidder knew the University of North Carolina would be the tournament winner and thus pay out 32% of the pool, he would still be unsure of the exact value of the team (unless it was the last team being bid on) since the payout depends on the sum total of all winning bids, i.e. the final size of the pool.\n\nAnother typical variation in NCAA Calcutta auctions is the bundling and auctioning off as a block the lowest seeded teams in each region, called the \"Dogs\". For example, the 16th to 13th seeded teams from the Midwest Region would be bid upon as a bundle named the \"Dogs of the Midwest\". The winning bidder would own all 4 teams and usually recoups his or her investment if one or two of the Dogs wins an upset.\n\nThis is similar to parimutuel betting, in that the winnings are awarded from the total pool of bets, but differs in that only one player can bet on any one contestant. However, a player may purchase as many contestants as they desire.\n\nOne variation that has grown as the Calcutta auction is used more in conjunction with March Madness involves auctioning teams off in the reverse order of their seeds instead of random order. As bidding evolves, this aids bidders in estimating the final pot size since the heavily favored teams that command the highest bids are auctioned at the end, thereby limiting the risk on the larger bets.\n"}

In its earliest form, it is based on a chromatically descending tetrachord which arises naturally out of the dorian mode. Consequently the chromatic fantasia is almost invariably in D minor (D-E-F-G-A-B-C rather than D-E-F-G-A-B-C) even as late as Bach.\n\nAmong the earliest examples are two celebrated lute pieces by John Dowland, the \"Farewell\" and \"Forlorn Hope Fancy\". These were obviously highly influential of Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck whose own Fantasia Chromatica in many ways forms a link between the Renaissance and the Baroque.\n\nThe chromatic fantasy, as a form, fell into neglect in the later seventeenth century. \nAbout a century after Sweelinck, J.

{"id": "41963784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41963784", "title": "Cinema of Kazakhstan", "text": "Cinema of Kazakhstan\n\nCinema of Kazakhstan refers to the film industry based in Kazakhstan. Cinema in Kazakhstan can be traced back to the early 20th century. Today, Kazakhstan produces approximately fifteen full-length films each year. \n\nThe film industry in Kazakhstan has its origins in the production of documentaries in Alma-Ata (now Almaty) in the 1930s, developed to use as instruments for Soviet propaganda. The first Kazakh feature film, \"Amangeldy\" (1939), about the leader of the 1916 revolution, Amangeldy Imanov, was however the work of Lenfilm in Leningrad. Filmmaking in Kazakhstan was given a boost by the dislocations caused by World War II, as the main Soviet film studios, Mosfilm and Lenfilm, were both evacuated to Alma-Ata, where they combined with the Alma-Ata Film Studios to produce the Central United Film Studio. As a result, the Central United Film Studio, which continued working in Alma-Ata till 1944, produced 80 percent of all Soviet domestic feature films made during the war. Much of the great Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein's two part epic \"Ivan the Terrible\" was filmed in the Kazakh SSR. One of the major Soviet film schools, the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography (VGIK), was also temporarily relocated to Alma-Ata during the war. This film school became an alma-mater for the most notable Kazakh filmmakers of the 1960s, known as \"the new wave\". On January 6, 1961, the major Kazakh film company Alma-Ata Film Studios had its name changed to Kazakhfilm by the Ministry of the Culture of the Kazakh SSR.\n\nIn the post-war Soviet period, the major figure of Kazakh SSR's film industry was director Shaken Aimanov, in whose honor the Kazakhfilm film studios were renamed in 1984. Notable films of this period include a number of historical epics, such as the love tragic story \"Kyz-Zhibek\" (1970), and a trio of action films involving a secret agent, played by Asanali Ashimov, who uses all manner of derring-do to defeat the enemies of communism. The first in the trilogy, \"The End of the Ataman\" (1970), was set in 1921 and was directed by Shaken Aimanov. The second, \"The Trans-Siberian Express\" (1977), directed by Yeldar Orazbayev and set in 1927, featured a complicated plot involving the defeat of counter-revolutionaries planning to kill a Japanese businessman on a train bound for Moscow, on which our hero was masquerading as a cabaret manager. The third, \"The Manchurian Variant\" (1989), was set in 1945 Manchuria. The films, with their central hero played by a Kazakh actor, were, as well as entertainment, part of the efforts of the Soviet establishment to demonstrate that the Kazakh people fully supported communism.\n\nDuring the perestroika in the Soviet Union in the 1980s, a new wave of young Kazakh filmmakers emerged, ready to challenge the cinematic establishment. Released in 1988, \"The Needle\" provided a catalyst for this new movement in Kazakh film. The film, directed by Rashid Nugmanov, cast Viktor Tsoi as the central figure. Tsoi was the frontman of the popular Soviet rock group Kino, and considered by many to be a hero to the disaffected Soviet youth. Kino also composed the film's original soundtrack. Tsoi's character, Moro, returns to Alma-Ata to collect a debt from a lowly criminal, only to find out that his former girlfriend has become a drug addict. He decides to fight against the drug dealers, after which the film ends with him being stabbed in a snowy park at night. Another important founding work of the movement is Ermek Shinarbaev's 1989 film \"Revenge\" (Месть), which tackles on film for the first time the tragedies experienced by the Korean population in Kazakhstan and Central Asia.\n\nIn 1993, Nugmanov directed \"The Wild East\", loosily based on Akira Kurosawa's \"Seven Samurai\", involves a group of dwarves, runaways from the circus, who brings the magnificent seven to protects them from the predations of motorbike-riding Mongolian hoodlums. Nugmanov moved to Paris in 1993, where he has been associated with Kazakh political opposition groups. Other filmmakers of the post-independence Kazakhstan to have achieved success at international festivals include Satybaldy Narimbetov. His \"Biography of a Young Accordion Player\" (1994) is a tale of a small boy growing up in a Kazakh village during World War II. \"Leila's Prayer\" (2002) focuses on girl from a village close to the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site, whose mother prayer is that her baby son should live to old age. Darezhan Omirbaev's \"Killer\" (1998), a Kazakh-French co-production, is a tragic tale highlighting the economic difficulties by Kazakhstanis in the 1990s. A young driver from Almaty causes a minor motor accident when taking his wife and newborn baby back home from the hospital. Unable to pay for the damage, he gets sucked into crime. Amir Karakulov has garnered critical praise for a number of films, including \"Homewrecker\" (1991), a tale of two brothers in love with the same girl. Again, it all ends badly. A new arrival on the scene is Rustem Abdrashev. His directorial debut was \"Renaissance Island\" (2004), a tale of the first love of an aspiring poet set against the historical backdrop of the desiccation of the Aral Sea.\n\nOne problem is that very few of these films have been widely seen by audiences in Kazakhstan. Domestic distributors have preferred to rely a diet of dubbed Hollywood blockbusters and big-budget Russian movies, with the result that post-independence Kazakh cinema has developed something of a reputation a being more likely to be found in Western art houses and international competitions than on screens in Kazakhstan. However, the big-budget Kazakhstan film has arrived. \"Nomad: The Warriors\" (2005), with its international crew and cast, was an officially supported attempt to bring a film based on an exploits of Kazakh warriors of the 18th century onto international screens. \"Racketeer\" (2007), directed by Akan Satayev, about as a young Almaty in the tough economic climate of the 1990s, was billed as the first purely commercially oriented film made in the post-independence Kazakhstan, and proved a considerable box-office draw. One Kazakh director, Timur Bekmambetov, has also had success internationally in commercials cinema projects, particularly with the Russian fantasy features \"Night Watch\" (2004) and \"Day Watch\" (2006). Bekmambetov is now directing and producing movies in Hollywood. His notable works made in Hollywood includes \"Wanted\" (2008), \"The Darkest Hour\" (2011) and \"\" (2012).\n\nA guerrilla filmmaking movement called \"Partisan Cinema\" (Partizanskoe kino) was initiated in the 2010’s. Participating directors aim to work without any interference from the Kazakh government. The movement’s manifesto has three pillars: no budget, social realism and finding new ways. Films and directors in the movement include:\n\nCinemas in Kazakhstan range from draughty Soviet survivals to modern multiplex complexes. The market of cinemas is divided between the KinoPark Multiplex Cinemas, StarCinema, Arman and smaller players. Kazakhstan's new cinemas are usually located in shopping malls and entertainment centers. Ticket prices are lower than those in Western Europe and North America. In 2012, IMAX Corp. opened those two cinemas in Kazakhstan, as the result of the deal signed with KinoPark Multiplex Cinemas in 2010. Films originally made in English are almost invariably dubbed, not subtitled, but there is a little shown in English.\n\n\n\nKazakhfilm Studio is a state-owned company, financed by the Ministry of Culture, which has been in Kazakhstan since Soviet Union times.\n\nEurasia Film Production is the leading private film production company in Kazakhstan. Film \"Mongol,\" produced by Eurasia Fim Production was nominated for the best foreign-language film Oscar in 2008, and in same year “Tulpan” received the Grand Prix in Cannes’ Un Certain Regard.\n\nSatai Film is another leading film production company in Almaty, launched and run by Akan Satayev, one of the top film director in Kazakhstan, and president of Almaty Film Festival.\n\n\n"}

It is dedicated to the study of psychic and spiritualist phenomena.\n\nIn August 1873, the British National Association of Spiritualists (BNAS) was formed by Thomas Everitt, Edmund Rogers and others at a meeting in Liverpool.\nEarly members included well known spiritualists such as Charles Maurice Davies, Charles Isham, William Stainton Moses, Stanhope Templeman Speer, Morell Theobald and George Wyld. The BNAS carried out experimental séances and investigations into mediumship. It held no dogmatic religious views but was known for \"sympathising with the religion of Jesus Christ\".\nThe first public meeting of the BNAS took place on April 16, 1874 under the chairmanship of Samuel Carter Hall. By 1875 the BNAS had over 400 members. Its headquarters moved to Great Russell Street, London. In 1879 the German astrophysicist Johann Karl Friedrich Zöllner became an honorary member.\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison and his colleagues from the \"Scientific Research Committee\" of the BNAS were involved in experiments that weighed mediums during materialization séances. Specially built self-recording instruments were used. This was considered controversial and not all members agreed in conducting such experiments. In 1872, Harrison also caused controversy in the spiritualist community by exposing the fraud of spirit photographer Frederick Hudson. In 1875, Harrison with C. F. Varley conducted an unsuccessful experiment in photographing the alleged Odic force of Carl Reichenbach.\n\nThere was a large dispute between Moses and Harrison over its leadership council. Harrison was expelled from the BNAS. In April 1879, Charles Massey a vice-president resigned, as did Moses on December 31, 1880. In 1882, the BNAS changed name to the Central Association of Spiritualists (CAS). The remaining members such as vice-president Edmund Rogers, one of Moses's loyal supporters tried to reconstruct the society. However, internal conflict between members and financial problems caused the group to dissolve.\n\nIn October, 1883 a special conference was set up to discuss the ideas of Moses to form a new society. In March 1884, Moses and others formed the London Spiritualist Alliance (LSA). The first meeting was held on May 5 at the banqueting room in St James's Hall. Moses was president and members included John Stephen Farmer, Massey, Rogers, Stanhope Templeman Speer, Alaric Alfred Watts and Percy Wyndham. After Moses died in 1892, Rogers became the president. The LSA obtained a wider membership under the leadership of Rogers including notable figures such as Alfred Russel Wallace.\n\nIn 1886, Eleanor Sidgwick from the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) claimed that the medium William Eglinton was fraudulent. Members from the LSA and articles in the journal \"Light\" supported Eglinton and accused Sidgwick of bias and prejudice. Some spiritualist members resigned from the SPR.\n\nIn 1925, Arthur Conan Doyle became president and the LSA bought a new headquarters at Queensberry Place, South Kensington.\n\nBetween October, 1930 and June 1931 the materialization medium Helen Duncan was investigated by the LSA. Despite early favourable reports, an examination of Duncan's ectoplasm revealed it was made of cheesecloth, paper mixed with the white of egg and lavatory paper stuck together. One of Duncan's tricks was to swallow and regurgitate some of her ectoplasm and she was persuaded to swallow a tablet of methylene blue before one of her séances to rule out any chance of this trick being performed and because of this no ectoplasm appeared. The journal \"Light\" endorsed the court decision that Duncan was fraudulent and supported Harry Price's investigation that revealed her ectoplasm was cheesecloth.\n\nIn 1955 the LSA changed name to the College of Psychic Science, and in 1970 it became the College of Psychic Studies.\n\nAccording to psychical researcher Simeon Edmunds by 1955 when the LSA had changed name to the College of Psychic Science there was \"no doubt that from that time onwards the society was no longer a spiritualist one\" as it was accepting non-spiritualist members and held no corporate opinion on the question of survival. In the 1960s, after a revival in spiritualism, the college associated itself with the Society for Psychical Research, collecting thousands of case files.\n\nPaul Beard was the president of the college for 16 years. In 2006, the college offered twelves courses on psychic abilities. Television psychic Tony Stockwell is a member of the college.\n\nIn 1930, the London Spiritualist Alliance published a series of five books under L.S.A Publications Ltd. These were:\n\n\nThe oldest spiritualist journal in Britain is known as \"Light\". It was formed in January 1881 by Edmund Rogers and became affiliated with the BNAS and its successor organisations.\n\nThe College of Psychic Studies publishes the \"Light\" journal twice a year.\n\n"}

{"id": "10365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10365", "title": "Embouchure", "text": "Embouchure\n\nEmbouchure or lipping is the use of the lips, facial muscles, tongue, and teeth in playing a wind instrument. This includes shaping the lips to the mouthpiece of a woodwind instrument or the mouthpiece of a brass instrument. The word is of French origin and is related to the root \"\", 'mouth'. Proper embouchure allows instrumentalists to play their instrument at its full range with a full, clear tone and without strain or damage to their muscles.\n\nWhile performing on a brass instrument, the sound is produced by the player buzzing his or her lips into a mouthpiece. Pitches are changed in part through altering the amount of muscular contraction in the lip formation. The performer's use of the air, tightening of cheek and jaw muscles, as well as tongue manipulation can affect how the embouchure works.\n\nEven today, many brass pedagogues take a rigid approach to teaching how a brass player's embouchure should function. Many of these authors also disagree with each other regarding which technique is correct. Research suggests efficient brass embouchures depend on the player using the method that suits that player's particular anatomy (see below). Individual differences in dental structure, lip shape and size, jaw shape and the degree of jaw malocclusion, and other anatomical factors will affect whether a particular embouchure technique will be effective or not.\n\nIn 1962, Philip Farkas hypothesized that the air stream traveling through the lip aperture should be directed straight down the shank of the mouthpiece. He believed that it would be illogical to \"violently deflect\" the air stream downward at the point of where the air moves past the lips. In this text, Farkas also recommends that the lower jaw be protruded so that the upper and lower teeth are aligned.\n\nIn 1970, Farkas published a second text which contradicted his earlier writing. Out of 40 subjects, Farkas showed that 39 subjects directed the air downward to varying degrees and one subject directed the air in an upward direction at various degrees. The lower jaw position seen in these photographs show more variation from his earlier text as well.\n\nThis supports what was written by trombonist and brass pedagogue Donald S. Reinhardt in 1942. In 1972, Reinhardt described and labeled different embouchure patterns according to such characteristics as mouthpiece placement and the general direction of the air stream as it travels past the lips. According to this later text, players who place the mouthpiece higher on the lips, so that more upper lip is inside the mouthpiece, will direct the air downwards to varying degrees while playing. Performers who place the mouthpiece lower, so that more lower lip is inside the mouthpiece, will direct the air to varying degrees in an upward manner. In order for the performer to be successful, the air stream direction and mouthpiece placement need to be personalized based on individual anatomical differences. Lloyd Leno confirmed the existence of both upstream and downstream embouchures.\n\nMore controversial was Reinhardt's description and recommendations regarding a phenomenon he termed a \"pivot\". According to Reinhardt, a successful brass embouchure depends on a motion wherein the performer moves both the mouthpiece and lips as a single unit along the teeth in an upward and downward direction. As the performer ascends in pitch, he or she will either move the lips and mouthpiece together slightly up towards the nose or pull them down together slightly towards the chin, and use the opposite motion to descend in pitch. Whether the player uses one general pivot direction or the other, and the degree to which the motion is performed, depends on the performer's anatomical features and stage of development. The placement of the mouthpiece upon the lips doesn't change, but rather the relationship of the rim and lips to the teeth. While the angle of the instrument may change as this motion follows the shape of the teeth and placement of the jaw, contrary to what many brass performers and teachers believe, the angle of the instrument does not actually constitute the motion Reinhardt advised as a pivot.\n\nLater research supports Reinhardt's claim that this motion exists and might be advisable for brass performers to adopt. John Froelich describes how mouthpiece pressure towards the lips (vertical forces) and shear pressure (horizontal forces) functioned in three test groups, student trombonists, professional trombonists, and professional symphonic trombonists. Froelich noted that the symphonic trombonists used the least amount of both direct and shear forces and recommends this model be followed. Other research notes that virtually all brass performers rely upon the upward and downward embouchure motion. Other authors and pedagogues remain skeptical about the necessity of this motion, but scientific evidence supporting this view has not been sufficiently developed at this time.\n\nSome noted brass pedagogues prefer to instruct the use of the embouchure from a less analytical point of view. Arnold Jacobs, a tubist and well-regarded brass teacher, believed that it was best for the student to focus on his or her use of the air and musical expression to allow the embouchure to develop naturally on its own. Other instructors, such as Carmine Caruso, believed that the brass player's embouchure could best be developed through coordination exercises and drills that bring all the muscles into balance that focus the student's attention on his or her time perception. Still other authors who have differing approaches to embouchure development include Louis Maggio, Jeff Smiley, Jerome Callet. and Clint McLaughlin.\n\nMost professional performers, as well as instructors, use a combination called a puckered smile. Farkas told people to blow as if they were trying to cool soup. Raphael Mendez advised saying the letter \"M\". The skin under the lower lip will be taut with no air pocket. The lips do not overlap nor do they roll in or out. The corners of the mouth are held firmly in place. To play with an extended range one should use a pivot, tongue arch and lip to lip compression.\n\nAccording to Farkas the mouthpiece should have upper lip and lower lip (French horn), lower lip and upper lip (trumpet and cornet), and more latitude for lower brass (trombone, baritone, and tuba). For trumpet, some also advocate upper lip and lower lip. Farkas claimed placement was more important for the instruments with smaller mouthpieces. The lips should not overlap each other, nor should they roll in or out. The mouth corners should be held firm. Farkas speculated that the horn should be held in a downward angle to allow the air stream to go straight into the mouthpiece, although his later text shows that air stream direction actually is either upstream or downstream and is dependent upon the ratio of upper or lower lip inside the mouthpiece, not the horn angle. Farkas advised to moisten the outside of the lips, then form the embouchure and gently place the mouthpiece on it. He also recommended there must be a gap of or so between the teeth so that the air flows freely.\n\nArban and Saint-Jacome were both cornet soloists and authors of well respected and still used method books. Arban stated undogmatically that he believed the mouthpiece should be placed on the top lip. Saint-Jacome to the contrary said dogmatically that the mouthpiece should be placed \"two-thirds for the upper and the rest for the under according to all professors and one-third for the upper and two-thirds for the under according to one sole individual, whom I shall not name.\"\n\nThe Farkas set is the basis of most lip buzzing embouchures. Mendez did teach lip buzzing by making the student lip buzz for a month before they could play their trumpet and got great results. One can initiate this type of buzz by using the same sensation as spitting seeds, but maintaining a continued flow of air. This technique assists the development of the Farkas approach by preventing the player from using an aperture that is too open.\n\nStevens–Costello embouchure has its origins in the William Costello embouchure and was further developed by Roy Stevens. It uses a slight rolling in of both lips and touching evenly all the way across. It also uses mouthpiece placement of about 40–50% top lip and 50–60% lower lip. The teeth will be about apart and the teeth are parallel or the jaw slightly forward.\n\nThere is relative mouthpiece pressure to the given air column. One exercise to practice the proper weight to air relationship is the palm exercise where the player holds the horn by laying it on its side in the palm of the hand, not grasping it. The lips are placed on the mouthpiece and the player blows utilizing the weight of the horn in establishing a sound.\n\nA puckered embouchure, used by most players, and sometimes used by jazz players for extremely high \"screamer\" notes. Maggio claimed that the pucker embouchure gives more endurance than some systems. Carlton MacBeth is the main proponent of the pucker embouchure. The Maggio system was established because Louis Maggio had sustained an injury which prevented him from playing. In this system the player cushions the lips by extending them or puckering (like a monkey). This puckering enables the players to overcome physical malformations. It also lets the player play for an extended time in the upper register. The pucker can make it easy to use to open an aperture. Lots of very soft practice can help overcome this. Claude Gordon was a student of Louis Maggio and Herbert L. Clarke and systematized the concepts of these teachers. Claude Gordon made use of pedal tones for embouchure development as did Maggio and Herbert L. Clarke. All three stressed that the mouthpiece should be placed higher on the top lip for a more free vibration of the lips.\n\nThis embouchure method, advocated by a minority of brass pedagogues such as Jerome Callet, has not yet been sufficiently researched to support the claims that this system is the most effective approach for all brass performers.\n\nAdvocates of Callet's approach believe that this method was recommended and taught by the great brass instructors of the early 20th Century. Two French trumpet technique books, authored by Jean-Baptiste Arban and Saint-Jacome, were translated into English for use by American players. According to some, due to a misunderstanding arising from differences in pronunciation between French and English, the commonly used brass embouchure in Europe was incorrectly interpreted. Callet attributes this difference in embouchure technique as the reason the great players of the past were able to play at the level of technical virtuosity which they did, although the increased difficulty of contemporary compositions for brass seem to indicate that the level of brass technique achieved by today's performers equals or even exceeds that of most performers from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nCallet's method of brass embouchure consists of the tongue remaining forward and through the teeth at all times. The corners of the mouth always remain relaxed, and only a small amount of air is used. The top and bottom lips curl inward and grip the forward tongue. The tongue will force the teeth, and subsequently the throat, wide open, supposedly resulting in a bigger, more open sound. The forward tongue resists the pressure of the mouthpiece, controls the flow of air for lower and higher notes, and protects the lips and teeth from damage or injury from mouthpiece pressure. Because of the importance of the tongue in this method many refer to this as a \"tongue-controlled embouchure\". This technique facilitates the use of a smaller mouthpiece and larger bore instruments. It results in improved intonation and stronger harmonically related partials across the player's range.\n\nA variety of transverse flute embouchures are employed by professional flautists, though the most natural form is perfectly symmetrical, the corners of the mouth relaxed (i.e. not smiling), the lower lip placed along and at a short distance from the embouchure hole. It must be stressed, however, that achieving a symmetrical, or perfectly centred blowing hole ought not to be an end in itself. Indeed, French flautist Marcel Moyse did not play with a symmetrical embouchure.\n\nThe end-blown xiao, kaval, shakuhachi and hocchiku flutes demand especially difficult embouchures, sometimes requiring many lessons before any sound can be produced.\n\nThe embouchure is an important element to tone production. The right embouchure, developed with \"time, patience, and intelligent work\", will produce a beautiful sound and a correct intonation. The embouchure is produced with the muscles around the lips: principally the orbicularis oris muscle and the depressor anguli oris, whilst avoiding activiation of zygomaticus major, which will produce a smile, flattening the top lip against the maxillary (upper jaw) teeth. Beginner flute-players tend to suffer fatigue in these muscles, and notably struggle to use the depressor muscle, which necessarily helps to keep the top lip directing the flow of air across the embouchure hole. These muscles have to be properly warmed up and exercised before practicing. Tone development exercises including long notes and harmonics must be done as part of the warm up every day.\n\nSome further adjustments to the embouchure are necessary when moving from the transverse orchestral flute to the piccolo. With the piccolo, it becomes necessary to place the near side of the embouchure hole slightly higher on the lower lip, i.e. above the lip margin, and greater muscle tone from the lip muscles is needed to keep the stream/pressure of air directed across the smaller embouchure hole, particularly when playing in higher piccolo registers.\n\nWith the woodwinds, aside from the flute, piccolo, and recorder, the sound is generated by a reed and not with the lips. The embouchure is therefore based on sealing the area around the reed and mouthpiece. This serves to prevent air from escaping while simultaneously supporting the reed, allowing it to vibrate, and constrict the reed preventing it from vibrating too much. With woodwinds, it is important to ensure that the mouthpiece is not placed too far into the mouth, which would result in too much vibration (no control), often creating a sound an octave (or harmonic twelfth for the clarinet) above the intended note. If the mouthpiece is not placed far enough into the mouth, no sound will be generated, as the reed will not vibrate.\n\nThe standard embouchures for single reed woodwinds like the clarinet and saxophone are variants of the \"single lip embouchure\", formed by resting the reed upon the bottom lip, which rests on the teeth and is supported by the chin muscles and the buccinator muscles on the sides of the mouth. The top teeth rest on top of the mouthpiece. The manner in which the lower lip rests against the teeth differs between clarinet and saxophone embouchures. In clarinet playing, the lower lip is rolled over the teeth and corners of the mouth are drawn back, which has the effect of drawing the upper lip around the mouthpiece to create a seal due to the angle at which the mouthpiece rests in the mouth. With the saxophone embouchure, the lower lip rests against, but not over, the teeth as in pronouncing the letter \"V\" and the corners of the lip are drawn in (similar to a drawstring bag). With the less common double-lip embouchure, the top lip is placed under (around) the top teeth. In both instances, the position of the tongue in the mouth plays a vital role in focusing and accelerating the air stream blown by the player. This results in a more mature and full sound, rich in overtones.\n\nThe double reed woodwinds, the oboe and bassoon, have no mouthpiece. Instead the reed is two pieces of cane extending from a metal tube (oboe – staple) or placed on a bocal (bassoon, English horn). The reed is placed directly on the lips and then played like the double-lip embouchure described above. Compared to the single reed woodwinds, the reed is very small and subtle changes in the embouchure can have a dramatic effect on tuning, tone and pitch control.\n\n\n\n"}

A leader attached to the beginning of a reel is sometimes known as a head leader, or simply head, and a leader attached to the end of a reel known as a tail leader or foot leader, or simply tail or foot.\n\n\"Film leader\", used generically, refers to different types manufactured for many editorial and laboratory uses. For example, some types are used in negative cutting while making A and B rolls for printing. \"Painted leader\" is perforated film in overall colors, usually white, black, red, blue, or green. These are used for protective head and tail leaders to keep the body of the program material from being damaged. \"Fill leader\" (also called picture fill, or spacer, or slug film) is used to space out different sections of magnetic audio film stock so they are kept in synchronization with the picture. Typically, this is made from rejected or retired prints of previously released programs.\n\nA universal film leader is a head leader designed for television and theatrical motion picture exhibition applications. This includes the countdown, and technical information about the film, including title, studio, production number, aspect ratio, sound level and mix, reel number and color.\n\nHead leaders are marked with visual and audio information that may be used to ensure that the correct amount of time is allowed for the machine to run up to speed and arrive at the beginning of the program or movie. They generally feature a countdown.\n\nTwo versions of the countdown leader are well-known:\n\n\nThe latest overall length of both styles is the same: in 35mm, 16 feet and 4 frames or 260 frames. The countdown section begins with a single frame bearing the words \"Picture Start.\" The sync beep (or 2-pop) occurs in synchronization with the last numbered frame (\"3\" on the Academy leader, \"2\" on the SMPTE Television leader). The length of the countdown section, including the \"Picture Start\" frame through to and including the \"3\" foot or \"2\" second frame, is 9 feet and 1 frame (145 frames) plus 47 frames of black (for a total of 12 feet even or 192 frames).\n\nIn 2013, SMPTE introduced the D-Cinema Digital Leader; a picture version of the countdown leader for use with Digital Cinema Distribution Master (DCDM) files. The DCDM is the penultimate step to the creation of the Digital Cinema Package (DCP).

{"id": "54369380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54369380", "title": "Gangster film", "text": "Gangster film\n\nA gangster film or gangster movie is a film belonging to a genre that focuses on gangs and organized crime. It is a subgenre of crime film, that may involve large criminal organizations, or small gangs formed to perform a certain illegal act. The genre is differentiated from Westerns and the gangs of that genre.\n\nThe American Film Institute defines the genre as \"centered on organized crime or maverick criminals in a twentieth century setting\". The institute named it one of the 10 \"classic genres\" in its 10 Top 10 list, released in 2008. The list recognizes 3 films from 1931 & 1932 (\"Scarface\", \"Public Enemy\" & \"Little Caesar\"). Only 1 film made the list from 1933 to 1966, (\"White Heat\" (1949)). This was at least partly due to the limitations on the genre imposed by the Hays Code, which was finally abandoned in favor of the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system in 1968.\n\nThe genre was revitalized in the New Hollywood movement that followed. New Hollywood directors would be honored with 5 of the top 6 films on the list—1967's \"Bonnie and Clyde\" by Arthur Penn, 1972's \"The Godfather\" and 1974's \"The Godfather Part II\" both by Francis Ford Coppola, 1983's \"Scarface\", a remake of the 1932 original, by Brian De Palma, and 1990's \"Goodfellas\" by Martin Scorsese.\n\nIn the 1970s, as genre theory came to the focus of academic study and the creation of a more specific taxonomy of genres was defined, gangster film started being distinguished from other subgenres, especially that of western. The genre has been predominantly defined by its historical, ideological, and sociocultural context. Three main categories of gangster films can be distinguished, according to Martha Nochimson: films that follow the escapades of outlaw rebels, such as \"Bonnie and Clyde\", melodramas of villain gangsters against whom the in-story victims and the audience identify, such as \"Key Largo\" and, most predominantly in the genre, films following an outsider, immigrant gangster protagonist, with whom the audience identifies.\n\nThe first Japanese films about the Yakuza evolved from the Tendency films of the 1930s. They featured historical tales of outlaws and the abuses suffered by the common people often at the hands of the corrupt powers that be. The so-called \"Chivalry movies\" of the 1960s gave way to the violent realism of Kinji Fukasaku, whose 1973 \"Battles Without Honor and Humanity\" would inspire future filmmakers across the globe.\n\n1931 and 1932 produced three of the most enduring gangster films ever. \"Scarface\", \"Little Caesar\" and \"The Public Enemy\" remain as three of the greatest examples of the genre. However, starting in the mid-1930s, the Hays Code and its requirements for all criminal action to be punished and all authority figures to be treated with respect made gangster films scarce for the next three decades.\nPolitics combined with the social and economic climate of the time to influence how crime films were made and how the characters were portrayed. Many of the films imply that criminals are the creation of society, rather than its rebel, and considering the troublesome and bleak time of the 1930s, that argument carries significant weight. Often the best of the gangster films are those that have been closely tied to the reality of crime, reflecting public interest in a particular aspect of criminal activity; thus, the gangster film is in a sense a history of crime in the United States.\n\nThe institution of Prohibition in 1920 led to an explosion in crime, and the depiction of bootlegging is a frequent occurrence in many mob films. However, as the 1930s progressed, Hollywood also experimented with the stories of the rural criminals and bank robbers, such as John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, and Pretty Boy Floyd. The success of these characters in film can be attributed to their value as news subjects, as their exploits often thrilled the people of a nation who had become weary with inefficient government and apathy in business. However, as the FBI increased in power there was also a shift to favour the stories of the FBI agents hunting the criminals instead of focusing on the criminal characters. In fact, in 1935 at the height of the hunt for Dillinger, the Production Code office issued an order that no film should be made about Dillinger for fear of further glamorizing his character.\nMany of the 1930s crime films also dealt with class and ethnic conflict, notably the earliest films, reflecting doubts about how well the American system was working. As stated, many films pushed the message that criminals were the result of a poor moral and economic society, and many are portrayed as having foreign backgrounds or coming from the lower class. Thus, the film criminal is often able to evoke sympathy and admiration out of the viewer, who often place the blame on not the criminal's shoulders but a cruel society in which success is difficult. When the decade came to a close, crime films became more figurative, representing metaphors, as opposed to the more straight forward films produced earlier in the decade, showing an increasing interest in offering a thought provoking message about criminal character.\n\nWith the abolition of the Hays Code in the late 1960s, studios and filmmakers found themselves free to produce films dealing with subject matter that had previously been off-limits. Early examples include Arthur Penn's depression-era tale of \"Bonnie and Clyde\"; \"Mean Streets\", Scorsese's cinema vérité story of a young aspiring mobster and his problem-gambler friend, played by Robert De Niro and Sam Peckinpah's \"Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia\", about the Mexican mob, family honor, and the opportunistic Bennie (Warren Oates), friend of the eponymous Alfredo Garcia, looking to make a big score when the chance drops in his lap. Bonnie and Clyde was one of 1967's biggest box office hit and garnered 2 Academy Awards and 8 other nominations including best picture. It, along with the others, however, were overshadowed by Francis Ford Coppola \"Godfather\" saga.\n\nIn 1972, Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\" was released. The epic story of the Corleone family, its generational transition from post-prohibition to post-war, its fratricidal intrigues, and its tapestry of mid-century America's criminal underworld became a huge critical and commercial success. It accounted for nearly 10% of gross proceeds for all films for the entire year. It won the Oscar for Best Picture, as well as the award for Best Actor for Marlon Brando and is widely considered one of the greatest American films of all time. Two years later, \"The Godfather Part II\" became the fifth-highest-grossing film of the year and garnered 11 Academy Award nominations. It again won Best Picture. Coppola won Best Director and Robert DeNiro won best supporting actor for his portrayal of a young Vito Corleone.\n\nThe lesson of the films' successes was not wasted on Hollywood. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the studios issued a steady flow of films about Italian American gangsters and the Mafia. Some of these were critically acclaimed. Scorsese's \"Goodfellas\" about Henry Hill's life and relationship with the Lucchese and Gambino crime families, was nominated for 6 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director and won the award for Best Supporting Actor for Joe Pesci's performance. Others, however, strayed into stereotypes and the gratuitous use of Italian ethnicity in minor characters who happened to be criminals. This created a backlash in the Italian American community.\n\nThe films of the 1990s produced several critically acclaimed mob films, many of which were loosely based on real crimes and their perpetrators. Many of these films featured long-time actors well known for their roles as mobsters such as Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Chazz Palminteri.\n\n\"Goodfellas\", directed by Martin Scorsese, starred Ray Liotta as real-life associate of the Lucchese crime family Henry Hill. It was one of the most notable gangster films of the decade. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci also starred in the film with Pesci earning an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards in all, including Best Picture and Best Director, making \"Goodfellas\" one of the most critically acclaimed crime films of all time.\n\nFollowing their collaboration in \"Goodfellas\", Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci would team up again in 1995's \"Casino\", based on Frank Rosenthal, an associate of the Chicago Outfit, that ran multiple casinos in Las Vegas during the 1970s and 1980s. The film was De Niro's third mob film of the decade, following \"Goodfellas\" (1990) and \"A Bronx Tale \"(1993).\n\nAl Pacino also returned to the genre during the 1990s. He reprised his role as the iconic Michael Corleone in \"The Godfather Part III\" (1990). The film served as the final installment in The Godfather trilogy, following Michael Corleone as he tries to legitimize the Corleone family in the twilight of his career.\n\nIn 1993, Pacino starred in \"Carlito's Way\" as a former gangster released from prison that vows to go straight. In 1996, Armand Assante starred in television film Gotti as infamous New York mobster, John Gotti. In 1997's \"Donnie Brasco\", Pacino starred alongside Johnny Depp in the true story of undercover FBI agent Joseph Pistone and his infiltration of the Bonanno crime family of New York City during the 1970s. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nIn 2006, Scorsese released \"The Departed\", his adaptation of \"Infernal affairs\", the Hong Kong film. \"The Departed\" was also loosely based on the Whitey Bulger story, and Boston's Winter Hill Gang, which Bulger led. It earned Scorsese an Academy Award for Best Director and the film won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\nA 2018 biographical mafia film, \"Gotti\", directed by Kevin Connolly, stars John Travolta as John Gotti, released in June. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 0% based on 38 reviews, and an average rating of 2.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \".\" Martin Scorsese is also set to release a biographical mafia film in 2019 through Netflix, The Irishman, starring all three heavyweights in the genre, Robert De Niro as Frank \"The Irishman\" Sheeran, Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa and Joe Pesci as Russell Bufalino.\n\nApart from telling their own Tales of African American gangsters in syndicates, films like Black Caesar feature the Italian mafia prominently. Often the blaxploitation stories of the seventies tell the tale of African American gangsters rising up and defeating the established white criminal order.\n\nBrian De Palma's 1983 remake of \"Scarface\" stars Al Pacino as Tony Montana, a Cuban exile and ambitious newcomer to Miami who sees an opportunity to build his own drug empire. Abel Ferrara's 1990 \"King of New York\" tells the story of Frank White, (Christopher Walken) and his return to New York City from prison. He navigates both the traditional Italian mafia authorities as well as the new cartels, as they are producing, smuggling and distributing cocaine in an uneasy business Alliance.\n\n\nEarly films about the Yakuza revolved around pre-war notions of honor and loyalty. These \"ninkyo eiga\" (chivalry films) were replaced in the late 1960s and early 1970s by a new style, pioneered by Kinji Fukasaku and inspired by the French New Wave and American Film noir called \"Jitsuroku eiga\" (true record films). The new style is considered to have begun with Fukasaku's \"Battles Without Honor and Humanity\" (1972), a violent, realistic portrayal of post-war gangs in the ruins of Hiroshima. In addition to Fukasaku's \"shaky camera style\", this new brand of film often adapted true stories.\n\nPrior to \"Battles\", the films of Seijun Suzuki had departed from the \"ninkyo eiga\" formula, but had met with limited commercial success. Although, Suzuki's \"Branded to Kill\" would later inspire other directors in the gangster film genre, including John Woo, Chan-wook Park and Quentin Tarantino.\n\nThe 1947 adaptation of the Graham Greene novel by the same name, \"Brighton Rock\", is a stark portrayal of a young gang leader and the racketeers in Brighton. It has been recognized as one of the greatest UK films ever by the British Film Institute.\n\nAn early example of the Gallic gangster film is Maurice Tourneur’s 1935 film \"Justin de Marseille\" set in Marseille. Tourneur's gangster-hero differentiates from his American equivalent by valuing honour, artisanship, community and solidarity. Four years before of the rise of film noir, in 1937, Julien Duvivier creates \"Pépé le Moko\", a French gangster film in the style of poetic realism that takes place in the Casbah. Its distribution in America was blocked by the US-makers of its 1938 remake Algiers. French gangster films will appear again in the mid-1950s, most notably Jacques Becker's \"Touchez pas au grisbi\", American blacklisted filmmaker Jules Dassin's \"Rififi\" and Jean-Pierre Melville's \"Bob le flambeur\".\n\n1969 and 1970 saw the release of three successful French gangster films featuring the day's biggest French movie stars. All three films featured Alain Delon. Jean Gabin, Delon, and Lino Ventura starred in 1969's \"Le clan des siciliens\", about a jewel thief and the Mafia. \"Borsalino\", a tale of the Italian Mafia in 1930 Marseilles, also featured Delon, along with Jean-Paul Belmondo. In \"Le Cercle Rouge\", Delon, Gian Maria Volontè, and Yves Montand team up to rob an impenetrable jewelry store.\n\nAll three of the films were domestic successes and \"Borsalino\" was popular elsewhere in Europe. None of them, however, broke through in the United States.\n\n\nIndian cinema, including Bollywood, has several genres of gangster films.\n\n\nThe Hong Kong gangster film genre began with 1986's \"A Better Tomorrow\", directed by John Woo and starring Chow Yun Fat. Woo's tale of counterfeiters portrays a gangster who balances \"Kung Fu honor\" and the materialistic goals of the Triads. It was the all-time biggest grossing Hong Kong film at the box office and was critically acclaimed. Woo would follow with a string of successes, including \"The Killer\", \"Bullet in the Head\", and \"Hard Boiled\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the 1960s, he managed Fred Pickering, when he played for both Everton F.C. and the England national football team.\n\nIn the 1970s, he managed England Under-21 player, Gary Owen, negotiating his transfer from Manchester City F.C. to West Bromwich Albion F.C. with Ron Atkinson, for what was then a substantial fee.\n\nLisberg oversaw the production of several football-related songs, some recorded at Strawberry Studios, and performed and/or written by future members of 10cc, e.g. \"Boys in Blue\" (1972), \"For Ever Everton\" (1972), and \"Willie Morgan on the Wing\" (1974). More recent football songs are \"Shearer Shearer\" (1996), and \"United City Calypso\" (2011), featuring Lisberg himself as the artist parodying Lord Kitchener's classic ‘City and United 1956 – The Manchester Football Double’, to celebrate the next Manchester football double in 2011, when Manchester United F.C. and Manchester City F.C. won the Premier League and the FA Cup respectively.\n\nIn 1981, Lisberg ventured into the snooker world; by signing Jimmy White, who he helped mould into the people's champion. Lisberg arranged a complete makeover for White: with a new permed hairstyle, French designer clothes, and a photo session with Patrick Lichfield.\n\nAbout his move into snooker, Lisberg said \"Snooker just had a magic at the time I came into it, around '81. I got more publicity in six weeks representing Jimmy White than in twenty years representing world superstars. Snooker was like the pop music of the 'sixties, and the players were stars in their own right\".\n\nWithin months, he had added White's good friend and idol, Alex Higgins, to a stable of players that would later include Tony Knowles, John Virgo, David Taylor and Willie Thorne, but by 1985, Lisberg decided to abandon his snooker interests after White defected to another manager in breach of contract.\n\nIn 1963, Lisberg was a trainee at accountants Binder Hamlyn (now known as BDO International) when he discovered Herman's Hermits at a church hall in Davyhulme. By early 1964, he was their co-manager, and approached E.M.I.'s Derek Everett, who suggested producer Mickie Most, who in turn agreed to work with the band after seeing them perform in Bolton on a prepaid return air ticket from Lisberg. Soon signed to EMI, their first single was the Gerry Goffin and Carole King composition, \"I'm Into Something Good\" (with B-side \"Your Hand in Mine\", co-written by Lisberg), which went to Number 1 in the UK charts in September/October 1964.\n\nAs George Tremlett put it in his book \"The 10cc Story\":\nIn autumn 1964, Lisberg enlisted Graham Gouldman, to write songs at his office for a modest weekly retainer. The first endeavour, \"For Your Love\", was rejected as a Herman's Hermits single by Mickie Most. Lisberg then tried to get the song heard by The Beatles when they were playing the Hammersmith Odeon, and via Ronnie Beck was introduced to the support act's manager, Giorgio Gomelsky who placed it with his band The Yardbirds. Peaking in February 1965 at No. 3 in the UK charts and reaching No. 6 in the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, the song literally broke The Yardbirds, since it also signaled the departure of lead guitarist, Eric Clapton. In 1965, Gouldman penned two more hit songs for The Yardbirds, namely \"Heart Full of Soul\", whose title was conceived by Lisberg, and \"Evil Hearted You\". Under Lisberg's wing Gouldman's output proliferated with a string of hit singles for various artistes such as \"Look Through Any Window\" and \"Bus Stop\" for The Hollies, \"Pamela Pamela\" for Wayne Fontana, and before long even Mickie Most capitulated by releasing a total of three Gouldman-written hit singles for Herman's Hermits namely \"Listen People\", \"No Milk Today\" and \"East West\", which was later covered (with new lyrics inserted in the third verse) by Morrissey in 1989.\n\nThe stellar successes of Herman's Hermits and Gouldman seduced Lisberg into making music management his full-time job. In the mid-1960s he joined forces with Danny Betesh and took a 50 per cent stake in Kennedy Street Enterprises, who had promoted The Beatles' first tour. Between April and May 1965, a hat-trick of Manchester-based acts, all Kennedy Street artistes, enjoyed an unprecedented consecutive six week spell at No. 1 on the US Hot 100, with Freddie and the Dreamers spending two weeks at the top with \"I'm Telling You Now\" (10–24 April), Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders one week with \"Game of Love\" (24 April-1 May), and then Herman's Hermits a further three weeks with \"Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter\" (1–22 May).\n\nLisberg spent much of his early career globe-trotting with Herman's Hermits, who capitalized on a string of hits in the US and later in the UK, but he also represented acts such as Little Frankie, The Herd, The Measles, Eric Woolfson, The Mockingbirds, John Paul Joans and Julie Driscoll. Always particularly interested in the song, he signed up an array of singer/songwriters such as Harvey Andrews, Peter Cowap, Barry Greenfield, Mark T. Jordan, Ramases and notably Kevin Godley and Lol Creme.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, the then unknown songwriters Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice approached Lisberg in the hope that he would place a new song titled \"Any Dream Will Do\" with Herman's Hermits. The song was rejected by Mickie Most as a Herman's Hermits single, but Lisberg nevertheless signed the duo to a development deal when he heard their sketches for a musical called \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat\". At the time there were no takers for the sketches, but the show, which morphed into a pop cantata written for schools and then became a concept album before being staged on the West End and later as a Broadway production, has since exceeded all original expectations.\n\nAs Sir Tim Rice put it:\n\nLisberg managed Wayne Fontana after he left the Mindbenders, allowing guitarist Eric Stewart to step-up to lead vocals on \"A Groovy Kind of Love\", which reached No. 2 in the UK and US in 1965. Stewart's Mindbenders appeared in To Sir, With Love, starring Sidney Poitier, and released a few singles, two of which were written by Gouldman who later joined the band on bass until it folded in mid-1968, liberating Stewart to focus on developing Strawberry Studios which he co-founded with Peter Tattersall.\n\nLisberg procured a deal for Gouldman to move to New York and write songs for Super K Productions, the 'bubblegum' hit factory owned by Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz. This was later reworked allowing Gouldman to return for a few months to record at Strawberry Studios providing both money and kudos for the studio. In 1969, Gouldman acquired a third of the shares in Strawberry and soon Kennedy Street would also become a stakeholder. Even if the sessions didn't yield much memorable musical output, they did bring Stewart, Gouldman, Godley and Creme together on various polyonymous pre-10cc vinyl incarnations, made in their own studio in provincial Stockport, UK, a new destination for international artists from Neil Sedaka to Joy Division.\n\nIn 1970, as a sonic experiment to test a 4-track Ampex recording desk, Stewart, Godley and Creme recorded \"Neanderthal Man\" which was released as a single under the name of Hotlegs. The song became an international smash hit and sold over 2 million copies worldwide, reaching No. 22 in the US, No. 2 in the UK and topping the charts in Italy. Hotlegs put out an album \"\" (which inspired Alice Cooper's \"School's Out\"), and as both Crazy Elephant and Doctor Father, the single \"Umbopo\".\n\nBy this time, Lisberg had already agreed to be Tony Christie's manager after seeing him perform at an awards ceremony in Winter Gardens, Blackpool. Lisberg secured a record deal with MCA Records and introduced Christie to Mitch Murray and Peter Callander, the successful songwriting and production duo. Christie's first two hits were the Murray and Callander compositions \"Las Vegas\" and \"I Did What I Did for Maria\", which respectively peaked at numbers 21 and 2 in the UK singles chart, but a follow-up third single was lacking. On a business trip to New York in mid-1971, Lisberg approached Neil Sedaka's publisher Don Kirshner in search of a new gem, and when Sedaka tapped out \"(Is This the Way to) Amarillo?\" on piano, Lisberg knew he had found Christie's third hit record.\n\nNeil Sedaka explained in a 2009 interview:\n\nIn late 1971, \"Amarillo\" was a huge European hit and soon became Christie's signature tune, but it rose no higher than number 18 in the UK. It lay dormant for more than three decades until it was lip synced as a video by UK comedian Peter Kay, and some celebrity friends for the 2005 Comic Relief charity drive. The original Tony Christie single was the biggest hit in the UK in 2005 holding on to the No. 1 spot for seven weeks and still remains one of the few singles in the UK to have sold over 1 million records.\n\nIn early 1972, after the success of \"Amarillo\", Lisberg convinced Neil Sedaka to record some new compositions at Strawberry Studios using Eric Stewart to engineer the recordings with Graham Gouldman, Kevin Godley and Lol Creme as session musicians. Sedaka initially agreed to record only three songs but in the event he put down a whole album in just two weeks. The album, \"Solitaire\", marked Sedaka's comeback after a 10-year absence, and the title song was a top five hit for Andy Williams. In 1973, Sedaka revisited the Strawberry team to record his album \"The Tra-La Days Are Over\" featuring \"Love Will Keep Us Together\", whose title is sardonically referenced by antithesis in Joy Division's 1980's Strawberry Studios' recorded classic, \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\".\n\nAfter supporting The Moody Blues on tour as Hotlegs, and their acclaimed work as studio band for Ramases, Kasenetz-Katz, Neil Sedaka and others, the four session musicians decided to pool their talents as a unit. In 1972, they signed to Jonathan King's UK Records label, who named the band 10cc releasing two albums, \"10cc\" (1973), and \"Sheet Music\" (1974), which featured five UK hit singles, \"Donna\" – No. 2, \"Rubber Bullets\" – No. 1, \"The Dean and I\" – No. 10, \"The Wall Street Shuffle\" – No. 10 and \"Silly Love\" – No. 24. The band satirized its small royalty in \"4% of Something\", and Lisberg tried to leverage the band's success by renegotiating but UK Records was intransigent. In 1975, for a big advance and fair royalty, 10cc left UK Records and moved to Phonogram.\n\nPhonogram released 10cc's third album, \"The Original Soundtrack\" (1975), and its hit singles, \"Life Is a Minestrone\" – No. 7, and \"I'm Not in Love\", which took the band to another level. In June 1975, the song went to No. 1 in the UK and reached No. 2 on the US charts and was acknowledged as one of the best songs of that year, winning three Ivor Novello Awards for Best Contemporary Song, the Most Performed Work and International Hit of The Year. The song, acclaimed as one of the best love songs ever, is featured in \"Guardians of the Galaxy\", the biggest film of 2014, whose soundtrack \"Awesome Mix Vol.1\" hit No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. 10cc's fourth album, \"How Dare You!\" (1976), had two UK hit singles, \"Art for Art's Sake\" – No. 5 & \"I'm Mandy Fly Me\" – No. 6.\n\nIn 1976 Godley & Creme left 10cc, to record a concept album featuring Peter Cook and Sarah Vaughan, to showcase their invention 'the Gizmo'. The triple album boxed-set was called \"Consequences\" (1977), which is now a collector's item. Lisberg reflected:\n\nIn 1977, Stewart and Gouldman released 10cc's \"Deceptive Bends\" album, with singles \"The Things We Do for Love\" peaking at No. 2 in the UK and No. 5 in the US followed by \"Good Morning Judge\" going top 5 in the UK The 1978 \"Bloody Tourists\" album featured their best selling and final No. 1 single, \"Dreadlock Holiday\", later used in the 2010 Mark Zuckerberg biopic \"The Social Network\", but \"[t]he 10cc hit machine effectively ground to a halt when Eric Stewart was involved in a car crash in January 1979\".\n\nAfter hearing their demo tape in early 1977 and declaring the group chart certainties, Lisberg decided to manage Sad Café who he placed with RCA Records. The band achieved only moderate commercial success with the first two albums, \"Fanx Ta Ra\" (1977) and \"Misplaced Ideals\" (1978), but Lisberg persuaded RCA to recruit Eric Stewart as producer for the third album, \"Façades\" (an anagram of 'Sad Cafe'), which yielded three top 40 singles with \"Every Day Hurts\", reaching No. 3 in the UK in September 1979.\n\nLisberg managed Barclay James Harvest from 1973 to 1977 securing a deal for them on Polydor. Known for their albums and already successful in Europe, he arranged for the band to record their 1975 \"Time Honoured Ghosts\" album in San Francisco with legendary producer Elliot Mazer, which failed to break them in America. Under Lisberg's tenure BJH also released \"Everyone Is Everybody Else\" (1974), \"Octoberon\" (1976), \"Gone to Earth\" (1977), and their only UK Top 50 hit single in March 1977.\n\nIn 1979, Lisberg approached David Hemmings who was raising funds for a film featuring Joan Collins and starring Farrah Fawcett, and put forward Graham Gouldman to write and record the title song, Sunburn, which became a minor hit single for him in the UK Intrigued by the concept and his similar name, Lisberg approached Steven Lisberger for Gouldman to write and record the soundtrack for his animated film Animalympics, but commercial success was impeded by the US led 1980 Summer Olympics boycott.\n\nWarner Brothers Records negotiated with Lisberg for Graham Gouldman to produce the Ramones album \"Pleasant Dreams\", and oversaw the US release of 10cc's seventh album \"Look Hear?\" (1980) and their eighth, \"Ten Out of 10\" (1981), which, at Lenny Waronker's instigation debuted Andrew Gold as co-writer and guest musician on three tracks including their only 1980's UK top 50 hit Run Away. Gold declined Stewart and Gouldman's invitation to join 10cc for their ninth album, \"Windows in the Jungle\" (1983).\n\nWhen 10cc disbanded in 1983, Gouldman and Gold reconnected and formed Wax who signed to RCA for three albums, \"Magnetic Heaven\" (1986), \"American English\" (1987) and \"A Hundred Thousand in Fresh Notes\" (1989). Wax achieved success on both sides of the Atlantic when \"Right Between The Eyes\" reached No.43 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1986 and \"Bridge to Your Heart\" peaked at No.12 in the UK Singles Chart in July 1987. Lisberg placed \"Alright Tonight\" in Burglar, starring Whoopi Goldberg.\n\nMeanwhile, Godley and Creme became pioneering music video producers, and also released six albums of their own, highlighted by the hit singles \"Under Your Thumb\" – No. 3, \"Wedding Bells\" – No. 7 and the iconic \"Cry\" – their only US top 20 hit. In 1987, Lisberg colluded with Brian Berg of Polydor to reunite the two camps on one compilation which manifested as \"Changing Faces – The Very Best of 10cc and Godley & Creme\", the best-selling 10cc album to date. Godley and Creme themselves split up in 1988.\n\nThe success of \"Changing Faces\" prompted Polydor to ask for another album featuring all four original band members which was delivered, in a diluted form, with 10cc's tenth album, \"Meanwhile\" (1992). A few years later, Avex, the biggest independent record label in Japan, commissioned and released 10cc's final album, \"Mirror Mirror\" (1995), with co-writes from Sir Paul McCartney on \"Yvonne's The One\" (Stewart/McCartney), and Sir Tim Rice on \"The Monkey and the Onion\" (Rice/Gouldman).\n\nIn the mid-1990s Lisberg sold out his 50 per cent stake in Kennedy Street and now splits his time between the USA and the UK. He still represents Gouldman and works on a few selected music-related projects.\n\n\n"}

It is loosely based on Adam Rex's 2007 children's book \"The True Meaning of Smekday\" and stars the voices of Jim Parsons, Rihanna, Steve Martin, Jennifer Lopez, and Matt Jones. Tim Johnson is the director of the film, Chris Jenkins and Suzanne Buirgy are its producers, and the screenplay is by Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember. The story takes place on planet Earth, where an alien race called the Boov invade the planet. However, a girl named Tip Tucci manages to avoid capture, and goes on the run with Oh, a fugitive Boov.\n\nThe film was released in theaters on March 27, 2015. \"Home\" was promoted with the release of a four-minute short film titled \"Almost Home\", which was shown in theaters before DreamWorks Animation's \"Mr. Peabody & Sherman\" and Blue Sky Studios' \"Rio 2\" in 2014. It premiered at the Boulder International Film Festival on March 7, 2015. Besides lending her voice to the film, Rihanna also created a concept album of the same name. The soundtrack includes guest vocals from Jennifer Lopez, among others, was supported by two singles, \"Towards the Sun\" and \"Feel the Light\". \"Home\" received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $386 million worldwide. A was released on July 29, 2016 that takes place after the events of the film and uses hand-drawn animation and none of the original cast (except Matt Jones) reprised their roles.\n\nOn the run from their enemy, the so-called planet-destroying Gorg, an alien race known as the Boov find Earth a suitable place to call \"home\". Led by Captain Smek (Steve Martin), they commence their \"friendly\" invasion of the planet, relocating the humans, whom the Boov deem as simple and backwards, to other parts of the planet while the Boov inhabit their homes in a quick and bloodless conquest. One of the Boov, named Oh (Jim Parsons), is a more excitable, freethinking member of the species, who decides to invite the Boov to his apartment for a housewarming party, despite the race's antipathy towards him. Not far from Oh is a fourteen year old girl named Tip Tucci (Rihanna), who drives away through her home city to find her mother Lucy (Jennifer Lopez) after being separated from her during the invasion, leaving her with only her calico cat Pig and fueling her hatred for the Boov.\n\nOh runs into the street to meet up with a Boov cop named Kyle (Matt Jones), who, like the rest of the Boov, doesn't want to befriend him. Oh invites him to the party but accidentally sends a mass invite to every Boov on Earth. However, the \"send all\" button he pressed actually sends the invite to absolutely every alien race in the entire universe including the Gorg. Everyone, aggravated with Oh for revealing their location to the enemy, starts chasing him down. Oh runs into a convenience store to hide just as Tip and Pig enter the same store to grab supplies. They come across each other, and after Tip's car fails to start, Oh transforms it into a fantastical, hovering craft named Slushious to continue transportation. Oh hitches a ride with Tip when he promises to help her find Lucy, but unfortunately, they must go to the Boov Command Center in Paris and locate her from there.\n\nAfter reaching the Boov Command Center, which is in the now-floating Eiffel Tower, Oh manages to get into his account, and deletes the message with just a second to spare before it reaches the Gorg. He then plugs in Tip's brain to help her find Lucy. They eventually trace her location to Australia, where she is also looking for her daughter. The other Boov then find the two and try to \"erase\" Oh, while Tip grabs the gravity manipulation system and flips it over, causing the whole Tower to tilt upside down, hence the two manage to escape.\n\nAs Oh and Tip head off to Australia, they are ambushed by other Boov riding by them in fear, and realize that a Gorg ship is close behind them. Tip and Oh manage to knock it down, but in the process a chunk of it hits them and they lose their slushie fuel, causing the car to crash-land. They come across the fallen Gorg ship and find out that it is actually a drone. Oh recovers a special chip and uses it to get their car up and running.\n\nTip and Oh make it to Australia and see the Boov evacuating to their mothership. When they land the car, Tip immediately starts looking for her mother, but Oh insists on evacuating with the other Boov instead. Tip gets upset at him for trying to break their promise again, and she declares that he was never truly her friend. The depressed Oh returns to the ship. The Gorg mothership comes close to the Boov ship, but Oh pulls out the Gorg chip and uses it to fly the ship further away from the Gorg. The Boov become astonished at Oh's bravery, but Smek becomes upset and reminds everyone that he is the captain. However, Oh stands up to Smek, telling him that he's a terrible captain and tells the Boov about what he learned from Tip about humans caring for other people while the Boov barely even care for each other. Saddened by this revelation at first, the Boovs then mutiny against Smek and Kyle grabs Smek's \"Shusher\" (a scepter with a rock on top of it, which Smek stole from the Gorg in a meeting) and gives it to Oh, declaring him the new captain, much to Smek's dismay.\n\nTip rushes aimlessly around the city to find Lucy, but in vain. Oh returns to her side and helps her track down Lucy. The mother and daughter finally reunite and thank Oh. Suddenly, the Gorg mothership descends upon the planet, and Oh realizes that they want the rock on the Shusher, since Smek had previously stolen it from them. Oh runs to the ship to try to attract its attention, locking Tip and Lucy in the car for safety. Tip breaks out of the car and shines a light in the Gorg Commander (Brian Stepanek)'s face to bring his attention to Oh as he holds the rock up. The Gorg Commander halts the ship as it crunches down on the ground, with Oh directly in its path. Tip rushes to rescue him, but Oh is seemingly crushed beneath the ship until it backs up and reveals him uninjured. The Gorg Commander emerges from his armor to show that he is actually a harmless starfish-like creature. Oh returns the rock to him, which turns out to be an egg for millions of developing Gorg larvae; the next generation of Gorg, revealing that the Gorg Commander/\"Father\" had been the last of his kind, alone and almost extinct. He thanks Oh and departs.\n\nTwo weeks later, the humans have returned to their original homes, and Oh finally gets to have his party at his apartment, with both humans and Boov in attendance. Tip plays her music and gets the rest of the Boov to experience dancing for the first time, while other Boov, including a reformed Smek, party on the moon, and thousands of ships from other planets, including the Gorg and his babies, head to Earth for Oh's party upon receiving his invite.\n\n\nThe rest of the Boov were voiced by Stephen Kearin, Lisa Stewart and April Winchell.\n\nIn 2008, DreamWorks Animation optioned the book's rights to adapt it into an animated feature film. On his blog, Adam Rex announced that DreamWorks renewed the option of the adaptation in 2011. On June 20, 2012, it was revealed that the title of the film would be \"Happy Smekday!\", Jim Parsons and Rihanna would star in the lead roles, and the film would be released in the fourth quarter of 2014. In September 2012, 20th Century Fox and DreamWorks Animation announced a release date of November 26, 2014. In June 2013, the film was retitled from \"Happy Smekday!\" to \"Home\".\n\nOn October 3, 2013, it was announced that Steve Martin and Jennifer Lopez had joined the cast. On May 20, 2014, the film's release date was pushed back to March 27, 2015, switching places with DreamWorks Animation's film \"Penguins of Madagascar\". Jeffrey Katzenberg, DreamWorks Animation's CEO, reasoned that \"Penguins\", coming from one of DWA's most successful franchises, would more easily stand out during Thanksgiving time, while \"Home\" would try to take advantage of the less competitive spring release window, and repeat successful spring launches of some of DWA's original films, including \"The Croods\" and \"How to Train Your Dragon\".\n\nIn addition to her voice role, Rihanna created a concept album for the film (also titled \"Home\") which was released on March 24, 2015. It consists of 8 original songs. The soundtrack's lead single, Rihanna's \"Towards the Sun\", premiered on BBC Radio 1 on February 24, 2015, and was made available for digital download the same day, via the iTunes Store. The second single, \"Feel the Light\", recorded by Jennifer Lopez, was released on February 25, 2015 via the iTunes Store.\n\nA 4-minute short film called \"Almost Home\" was attached to theatrical showings of DreamWorks Animation's \"Mr. Peabody & Sherman\" in early 2014 and Blue Sky Studios' \"Rio 2\" that same year. It was directed by Todd Wilderman, and features a score composed by Lorne Balfe. The short shows The Boov and their leader Captain Smek in a sequence of unsuccessful attempts at finding a hospitable planet, before they finally come across the Earth. The film itself premiered at the Boulder International Film Festival on March 7, 2015.\n\n\"Home\" was released digitally on June 26, 2015, and was released on DVD, Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D on July 28, 2015. In the United Kingdom, \"Home\" went to number one on the Official Video Chart in its first week of sale.\n\n\"Home\" grossed $177.4 million in North America and has grossed $208.6 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $386 million. Its production cost was $135 million, with a similar sum spent for prints and advertising (P&A). \"Deadline Hollywood\" calculated the net profit of the film to be $29.12 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film.\n\n\"Home\" opened in the U.S. and Canada simultaneously with the comedy \"Get Hard\" on March 27, 2015. Though the latter earned higher in its Thursday late-night run, estimates were showing that \"Home\" was heading to No. 1 in its opening weekend. It scored one of the biggest opening days for a DreamWorks Animation non-sequel ever with $15.6 million, behind \"Kung Fu Panda\" ($20 million) and \"Monsters vs. Aliens\" ($16.75 million). \"Home\" debuted at the top of the box office, with $52.1 million, which exceeded predictions of a $30 million to $35 million opening and was also DreamWorks Animation's best opening since the $60.3 million debut of \"\".\n\nOutside North America, \"Home\" was released in 10 countries on March 20, 2015, a week ahead of its U.S. premiere. It earned $20.1 million, coming in third place at the international box office behind \"Cinderella\" and \"\". The following weekend, it expanded to 55 additional countries and grossed a total of $24 million from 11,250 screens in 64 countries. Its largest openings occurred in the UK, Ireland and Malta ($9.12 million), Russia ($5.17 million), Mexico ($3 million), Brazil ($2.3 million), Australia ($2.42 million), and Spain ($2.24 million).\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 49%, based on 120 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Colorful, silly, and utterly benign, \"Home\" is a passable diversion, but there's no shortage of superior animated alternatives.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a score of 55 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". In CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave \"Home\" an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nMichael Rechtshaffen of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said, \"There may be no place like home, but there are a lot of places like \"Home\", an animated adventure about the unlikely friendship between a lonely girl and an alien misfit that can't help but feel familiar.\" James Rocchi of \"The Wrap\" gave the film a positive review, saying \"As animated sci-fi for small fry, it's a success whose modest but well-executed ambitions are no small part of its charm.\" Stephen Whitty gave the film two out of five stars, saying \"The Gummi-colored animation is imaginative, but director Tim Johnson's ho-hum 3D cartoon remains strictly 1D.\" Rafer Guzman of \"Newsday\" gave the film two out of four stars, saying \"The film moves quickly and keeps the jokes coming, which only means that \"Home\" would rather keep young viewers occupied than give them something to think about.\" Ben Sachs of the \"Chicago Reader\" gave the film a negative review, saying \"Aggressive and cynical approach to children's entertainment, pummeling viewers with mechanical-looking action sequences (which suggest video game demos), unfunny one-liners, and overly loud pop songs and sound effects.\" Claudia Puig of \"USA Today\" gave the film two out of five stars, saying \"Key characters are admirably diverse, but the fast-paced tale is thoroughly predictable.\"\n\nSoren Anderson of \"The Seattle Times\" gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying \"It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.\" Neil Genzlinger of \"The New York Times\" called the film \"A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.\" Betsy Sharkey of the \"Los Angeles Times\" gave the film a negative review, saying \"Tension is one of Home's biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another.

Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.\"\n\nPeter Debruge of \"Variety\" gave the film a negative review, saying \"From a creative standpoint, this is the studio's least exciting feature yet - hardly its worst, execution-wise, but entirely lacking in the risk-taking spirit that has spawned such successful franchises as \"Shrek\", \"Kung Fu Panda\" and \"Dragon\".\" Sara Stewart of the \"New York Post\" gave the film two out of five stars, saying \"It's refreshing to see a nonwhite lead, and the husky-voiced pop singer is likable as a brave-hearted kid searching for her mother. But man, is there a lot of Rihanna in this movie: She also provides what seems like the entirety of the film's soundtrack, making it feel like a vanity project (is 'vanimation' a thing?).\" Barbara VanDenburgh of \"The Arizona Republic\" gave the film two out of five stars, saying \"For all its energy, razzle-dazzle and whiz-bang technology, it doesn't know how to tell a simple story or cobble together three-dimensional characters, and that's a problem not even the best of 3-D glasses can fix.\" Susan Wloszczyna of RogerEbert.com gave the film two out of four stars, saying \"I kept thinking about \"Lilo & Stitch\" while watching \"Home\", a decidedly disappointing effort based on the popular kid-lit book \"The True Meaning of Smekday\" from the already embattled folks at DreamWorks Animation.\"\n\nAn animated series titled \"\" was released on Netflix on July 29, 2016. Rihanna and Jim Parsons do not reprise their roles as Tip and Oh; they are instead voiced by Rachel Crow and Mark Whitten, respectively (although Matt Jones reprises his role of Kyle from the film).

{"id": "593329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=593329", "title": "In a Grove", "text": "In a Grove\n\n\"In a Grove\" is an early modernist short story, as well as a blending of the modernist search for identity with themes from historic Japanese literature, and as such is perhaps the iconic work of Akutagawa's career. It presents three varying accounts of the murder of a samurai, Kanazawa no Takehiro, whose corpse has been found in a bamboo forest near Kyoto. Each section simultaneously clarifies and obfuscates what the reader knows about the murder, eventually creating a complex and contradictory vision of events that brings into question humanity's ability or willingness to perceive and transmit objective truth.\n\nThe story opens with the account of a woodcutter who has found a man's body in the woods. The woodcutter reports that man died of a single sword stroke to the chest, and that the trampled leaves around the body showed there had been a violent struggle, but otherwise lacked any significant evidence as to what actually happened. There were no weapons nearby, and no horses—only a single piece of rope, a comb and a lot of blood.\n\nThe next account is delivered by a traveling Buddhist priest. He says that he met the man, who was accompanied by a woman on horseback, on the road, around noon the day before the murder. The man was carrying a sword, a bow and a black quiver. All of these, along with the woman's horse, a tall, short-maned palomino, were missing when the woodcutter discovered the body.\n\nThe next person to testify is a \"hōmen\" (放免, a released prisoner working under contract to the police, similar to a bounty hunter). He has captured an infamous criminal named Tajōmaru. Tajōmaru was injured when thrown from a horse (a tall, short-maned palomino), and he was carrying a bow and a black quiver, which did not belong in his usual arsenal. This proves, he says, that Tajōmaru was the perpetrator. Tajōmaru was not carrying the dead man's sword, however.\n\nThe next testimony is from an old woman, who identifies herself as the mother of the missing girl. Her daughter is a beautiful, strong-willed 19-year-old named Masago, married to Kanazawa no Takehiro—a 26-year-old samurai from Wakasa. Her daughter, she says, has never been with a man other than Takehiro. She begs the police to find her daughter.\n\nNext, Tajōmaru confesses. He says that he met them on the road in the forest, and upon first seeing Masago, decided that he was going to rape her. In order to rape Masago unhindered, he separated the couple, luring Takehiro into the woods with the promise of buried treasure. He then stuffed his mouth full of leaves, tied him to a tree and fetched Masago. When Masago saw her husband tied to the tree, she pulled a dagger from her bosom and tried to stab Tajōmaru, but he knocked the knife out of her hand, and he had his way with her. Originally, he had no intention of killing the man, he claims, but after the rape, she begged him to either kill her husband or kill himself—she could not live if two men knew her shame. She would leave with the last man standing. Tajōmaru did not wish to kill Takehiro in a cowardly manner, so he untied him and they had a sword fight. During the duel, Masago fled. Tajōmaru dispatched the man and took the man's sword, bow, and quiver, as well as the woman's horse. He says that he sold the sword before he was captured by the bounty hunter.\n\nThe second-to-last account is that of Masago. According to her, after the rape, Tajōmaru fled, and her husband, still tied to the tree, looked at her with great disdain. She was ashamed that she had been raped, and no longer wished to live, but she wanted him to die with her. He agreed, or so she believed—he couldn't actually say anything because his mouth was still stuffed full of leaves—and she plunged her dagger into his chest. She then cut the rope that bound Takehiro, and ran into the forest, whereupon she attempted to commit suicide numerous times, she said, but her spirit was too strong to die. At the end of her confession, she weeps.\n\nThe final account comes from Takehiro's ghost, as delivered through a spirit medium. The ghost says that after the rape, Tajōmaru persuaded Masago to leave her husband and become his own wife, which she agreed to do under one condition: He would have to kill Takehiro. Tajōmaru became enraged at the suggestion, kicked her to the ground, and asked Takehiro if he should kill the dishonorable woman. Hearing this, Masago fled into the forest. Tajōmaru then cut Takehiro's bonds and ran away. Takehiro grabbed Masago's fallen dagger and plunged it into his chest. Shortly before he died, he sensed someone creep up to him and steal the dagger from his chest. Throughout, it is obvious that he is furious at his wife.\n\nAll analyses proceed from these premises:\n\nThe differences between the characters' stories range from the trivial to the fundamental. What follows is a list of discrepancies between the characters' testimonies.\n\n\nIn short, every character says at least one thing that is refuted by another.\n\nThe following movies have been based on the story of \"In a Grove\":\n\n\"In a Grove\" is the favorite story of \"Ghost Dog\", the main character from the movie \"\". \n\nThe seventh episode of \"R.O.D the TV\", titled \"In a Grove\", deals with a similarly confusing mix of truth and lies, reality and pretense. \n\nThe plot of \"The X-Files\" episode \"Jose Chung's \"From Outer Space\"\" also deals with conflicting testimonies from characters involved in an alien abduction case. In the same way, the plot of the \"\" episode \"A Matter of Perspective\" concerns similarly conflicting testimonies from characters involved in a homicide investigation - however, here, in contrast to the thesis of \"In a Grove\", an objectively true account of what happened is eventually discovered.\n\nThe name of the story has become an idiom in Japan, used to signify a situation where no conclusion can be drawn, because evidence is insufficient or contradictory. Similar terms include and .\n\nContrary to what some foreign-language versions of the story may imply, Masago does not confess to the police. This is clear in the Japanese version of the text. The title of this section is:「清水寺に来れる女の懺悔」(\"kiyomizu-dera ni kitareru onna no zange\", translated in \"Giles\" as \"The Confession of the Woman Visitor to Kiyomizudera Temple\") The word 懺悔 (\"zange\") is often translated as \"confession\", but the word also has heavy religious connotations, similar to \"repentance\" or \"penitence\". Although it can mean \"to confess to other people\", it almost always means \"to confess to Buddha/God\". Contrast this with Tajōmaru's confession to the police, referred to as 白状 (\"hakujō\") in the text. Jay Rubin translated the title of the section to \"Penitent Confession of a Woman in the Kiyomizu Temple\".\n\nRubin translated the title of the whole story to \"In a Bamboo Grove\".\n\n\n"}

The trick ends while the child or assistant either climbs out of the basket or reappears from behind the crowd unharmed. The Indian Basket trick has been used in an adapted form by Western magicians for a long time. It is one of the oldest illusions. It started off being performed in the streets; later, Colonel Stodare adapted it to stage magic. In the old version of the Indian Basket Trick, the magician used a real basket for the trick. Nowadays magicians use a box to accomplish this trick.\n\nThe secret to the trick was revealed by the magician Samri Baldwin as early as 1895. Baldwin described the trick as a very simple illusion. The boy whilst inside the basket \"coils himself around in the bulge or protruding sides of the basket, so that when the Fakeer tramples in the middle or center, he does not trample on the boy... The sword is only put through the basket at certain prearranged places and passes between the boy's legs, between his arms and the body, between the shoulders and the body, or between the shoulders and the neck.\" As for the boy reappearing outside of the basket behind the crowd, it is not the same boy but a confederate.\n\n\n"}

The original Jolt was a Decepticon hot rod with a sword who was introduced in 1994. Portrayed in a variety of incarnations, the most recent version of Jolt is a Superheroic Autobot who appeared in the 2009 film \"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\".\n\nThe original Transformer Jolt was a Decepticon who turned into a hot rod. He was a member of the sword-wielding Laser Rods team. He was also released under the name Hotrod in the UK, but is unrelated to the Autobot of that name.\n\nJolt appeared among the various characters on Transtech Cybertron in the \"Transcendent Part 4\" by Fun Publications.\n\nJolt was among the characters to appear in the 2010 \"Transformers: Timelines\" comic \"Generation 2 Redux\", where he was one of the Decepticons under the command of Clench.\n\nJolt appeared in the Marvel Generation 2 comics.\n\nBludgeon, current leader of the Decepticons planned to create an army of Decepticons, so he constructed the bodies of the Rotor Force and Laser Rods. When Megatron killed Bludgeon and took back leadership of the Decepticons, one of his first actions was to steal the Matrix from Optimus Prime. The Matrix was then used to bring the new Decepticons to life.\n\nRansack first appeared in issue #6 as one of the lifeless Decepticon bodies. In issue #7 Rotor Force (Leadfoot, Manta Ray, Powerdive and Ransack) and the Laser Rods (Electro, Jolt, Sizzle and Volt) were sent to steal Rheanimum, a potent substance Megatron intended to use in his quest for power, from the planet Tykos.\n\nThey would appear again in the Autobot-Decepticon alliance, battling against first the forces of Jhiaxus, and then the Swarm.\n\nAnother version of Jolt is a Mini-Con who turns into a helicopter and partner to the Autobot Hot Shot.\n\nJolt appeared as the sidekick of the Autobot Hot Shot in the animated series \"Transformers: Armada\", where he spoke only in electronic beeps.\n\nJolt appeared in the \"Dreamwave Productions\" comic book series for \"Transformers: Armada\" where he was given a much fuller character than in the animated series. Jolt appeared among the Mini-Cons in issue #18 of the \"Transformers: Armada\" comic book who aided Over-Run using the Mini-Con Matrix in the defeat of Unicron.\n\nJolt is among the characters appearing in the 2004 \"Transformers\" video game for the PlayStation 2.\n\n\n\n\n\nA new Mini-Con helicopter named Jolt came out in the \"Cybertron\" line.\n\nJolt (Hop in Japan) is the leader of the Recon Mini-Con Team. He has a childlike sense of wonder and curiosity - possibly a bad thing when he is with his human friends. He refers to Bud as \"Master Bud\" in a manner reminiscent of a butler, until Bud has him amend (so he changes it to the less formal, if awkward, \"Bud-dude.\") He is very loyal to his team and friends, and of all the Autobots in this series, he is the closest to the human characters.\n\nIn Japan, the Galaxy Force series is an original continuity, distinct from Micron Legend (Armada) and Super Link (Energon), so it is very unlikely that he was originally intended to be the same character as \"Armada\" Jolt.\n\n\nIn December 2007 images appeared on the internet of a redeco of \"Cybertron\" Crosswise in purple and silver. The character was named Jolt, although according to its designer it was originally a homage to the \"Generation 1\" Decepticon Micromaster Road Hugger, but when that name was unavailable from the legal department, they named him Jolt instead.\n\nAccording to his biography Jolt was brought to life in the final battle for the Allspark, and subsequently sought help by Barricade, who beat him up.\n\nJolt is one of the lowest ranking Decepticons ever made, with a rank of 2 out of 10.\n\nOddly a robot called Dead End appeared in the IDW comics \"\" who resembled Jolt in vehicle mode, but his origin completely contradicts the biography on the toy. His robot mode is never seen.\n\nThe latest version of Jolt is also an Autobot who appeared in the 2009 film . He turned into a blue Chevy Volt.\n\nJolt is armed with a pair of electric whips, befitting his electric car alternate mode. He was a last-minute addition to the cast as General Motors, the film's car supplier, wanted to promote the Volt. The writers had already wanted to include the car in the script before the Writers Guild strike, so they had to work out a character that would fit well within the Autobot team afterwards and convince Bay to approve the addition.\n\nThe car that portrayed Jolt appeared at the 2009 Chicago Auto Show.\n\nJolt is seen driving in vehicle mode on a highway with Ratchet and Optimus Prime. He is also seen mourning over Prime after the battle in the forest. He is in the final battle, fighting alongside his fellow Autobots to fend off the incoming Decepticons, and helps Ratchet connect Jetfire's remains with Optimus. He uses his \"electro whips\" to surge power from Jetfire to Prime so they can combine in the final battle.\n\nJolt's head was seen in \"The Last Knight\" at Cade's the junkyard, next to Wheelie, confirming his death.\n\nJolt appears in \"\" #1, set months after the events of the 2009 film. Bumblebee, Breakaway, Jolt, Knock Out and Dune Runner are sent to investigate spark fragments detected at Kingdom Petrochemicals. Arriving first Breakaway is warned by Soundwave to leave, but unwilling to give in the Autobot is swiftly defeated. Bumblebee and his team fire on Soundwave, who escapes.\n\nJolt appears in \"\". He learned that Bumblebee was defending Sam Witwicky from a Decepticon attack all alone, and was eager to get out there to help him. To his disappointment, Optimus Prime instead ordered him, Knock Out and Dune Runner to remain on Diego Garcia and keep an eye on the captive Fearswoop along with a number of confused Autobot refugees liberated from Carter Newell's control. Jolt took to guarding Fearswoop, but while he was making himself busy telling the prisoner off and reading comic books, the corpse of Knock Out suddenly crashed through a wall, courtesy of Shockwave. He prepared to take the intruder on with his electric whips, but Shockwave was unimpressed and shot him down. Jolt desperately tried to contact Optimus Prime for help, but his message failed to get through and he was killed by Shockwave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJolt is a Micron from the Age of Extinction toy line. He might be pals with Hot Shot from Age of Extinction toy line.\n"}

The sketch showed his parents watching in horror as Kevin lost his sense of dress, courtesy and posture as the clock struck midnight on the day of his thirteenth birthday, thus becoming Kevin the Teenager, one of the most memorable of Enfield's comic creations. Unlike the previous sketches which included an older brother, this incarnation of Kevin was an only child.\n\nAs a teenager, wearing a baseball cap the wrong way round and with his red hair flopping over his face, Kevin is rude to his despairing parents, frequently shouting \"I hate you, I wish I'd never been born!\" at them, and insisting that everything is \"so unfair!\" In one sketch, when his father asks him to wash his car, Kevin ends up taking the entire day to complete the task due to his inability to get out of bed before noon and an apparent allergy to work, and in another sketch, though wide awake, he made the most primitive of attempts at tidying his room when required to do so. The character is also heavily dictated by peer pressure, and was seen in various other sketches trying to sound like Ali G, or Liam Gallagher. \n\nHis best friend is another teenaged boy named Perry Carter (played by the actress Kathy Burke, and based on an early character Burke portrayed on various Channel 4 shows). They starred in a 2000 feature film, \"Kevin & Perry Go Large\".\n\nThe sketches suggest that teenage boys are always very polite to all parents except their own. Kevin and Perry heap immense amounts of abuse on their own respective parents (though Perry shouts at his down the phone rather than face to face) yet are very polite to each other's parents. In one sketch, Kevin's plans to host a party go wrong and ends with the house being trashed. Despite his frequent declarations of hatred towards his parents, Kevin ends up crying whilst his long-suffering mother gives him a much-needed hug.\n\nAside from playing video games, Kevin's one aim in life is to lose his virginity, or at least to prove that he has a girlfriend. From boasting about the (imagined) joys of sex to placing the nozzle of a vacuum cleaner to his neck to look as though he has received a love bite, he is determined to prove that he has \"done it\". He eventually does lose his virginity during a drunken party in the final episode of \"Harry Enfield and Chums\". The following morning, he wakes up transformed into a nice, polite and helpful young man. This is however later revealed to be a dream by his mother in the first of the two Christmas specials, with Kevin still behaving like before.\nThey both eventually end up losing their virginities in Ibiza in the movie Kevin & Perry Go Large\".\n\nDue to Kevin and the other characters in \"Harry Enfield and Chums\"' getting positive feedback and statements of the truth behind the writers' observations, the term \"Kevin the Teenager\" (often shortened to simply a \"Kevin\"), has entered British vernacular to describe any adolescent who is bad-tempered or rebellious (\"He's a right Kevin!\"). It can even be applied to female adolescents.\n\nKevin's father (named Dave in one of the earlier sketches, and later Frank (though others argue 'Rick' or 'Ray' is his name in the movie, based on the sex video played by Eyeball Paul in the movie, where Kevin's mother says \"Ooh Rick\" during Kevin and Perry's mix, and also afterwards when the two are lying in bed, mortified, and Kevin's mother says \"Oh, Ray..\") has been played by three actors:\n\nWhen Kevin was \"Little Brother\", his father was played by Martyn Whitby and his mother was played by Caroline Quentin.\n\nKevin's mother (named Sheila in one of the earlier sketches), in contrast to Kevin's father, was played by Louisa Rix in both the series and the movie.\n"}

The player also has a limited energy reserve: whenever Jax performs one of his special techniques, he spends energy that can be replenished by performing certain combos. Jax can attack with his hands and feet, as well as block counter strikes. Although there are no Fatality systems, the combo system allows finishing off the opponent with the final blow in case the enemy's health line is exhausted by this moment. The experience points that a player gains by defeating enemies allow one to get new combos. In-game menu displays the presence of items in the player's inventory, and also contains information on the purpose of the current mission. After completing the game, the player can activate the cheat menu to start a new game with additional bonuses.\n\n\"Special Forces\" is chronologically the first game in the \"Mortal Kombat\" storyline, as its events take place even before \"\". The story of the game involves Kano freeing his gang, the Black Dragon from a maximum security prison. Major Jax, seeking revenge for the slaughter of his Special Forces comrades at the hands of the Black Dragon, undertakes a mission to stop them from retrieving an artifact of great power, the Eye of Chitian. The true power of the artifact is shown in the ending that it can open portals to other realms when Jax uses the artifact to teleport himself and Kano back to Earthrealm after defeating him.\n\nBesides Jax, Kano, and Kano's Black Dragon subordinates Tremor and Jarek, the game features three characters exclusive to this entry in the series:\n\n\nThis was the second \"Mortal Kombat\" game developed by Midway that was more of a platformer than a fighting game, after having tested the waters with \"Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero\" in 1997. Series co-creator John Tobias intended to work on a series of platform games to expand the \"Mortal Kombat\" universe, including titles centering on Baraka and Liu Kang; only the latter was actually released by Midway (2005's \"\") despite having sat on the drawing board for many years.\n\nAlthough \"Special Forces\" was only released on the PlayStation, it was also supposed to be released both on the Nintendo 64 and Sega Dreamcast, as evidenced by an IGN interview with John Tobias. Many of Midway Games staff, including Tobias, left the company in 1999 for various reasons while the game was still in production. The plot of \"Special Forces\" (which originally included Sonya Blade) was greatly revised following Tobias's departure and the game was rushed to completion. Ed Boon later recalled: \"I didn't work on \"Special Forces\". The game and project were riddled with all kinds of problems. I could write a book on that.\"\n\nAs of 2014, it has a very low averaged review score of only 28/100 at Metacritic, including ratings of 2.1/10 from GameSpot and 3/10 from IGN. \n\nOf all the \"Mortal Kombat\" games, \"Special Forces\" is considered by some to be the worst. Its sales were so low that Midway placed the series on hold in preparation for \"\" (2002). Ed Boon himself stated: \"The game had a pretty bumpy development ride and the game didn't turn out very good at all.\" In 2011, GamesRadar ranked it as the second most absurd \"Mortal Kombat\" offshoot (behind only \"\"). In 2013, GamesRadar also ranked it as the 41st worst game ever made.\n\nConversely, \"Video Games: The Ultimate Guide\" gave the game 7 out of 10. \"GameVortex\" gave it 79%. \"Electric Playground\" scored it 7 out of 10.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "43747005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43747005", "title": "Prospect Theatre Company", "text": "Prospect Theatre Company\n\nThe Prospect Theatre Company was an English company founded, as Prospect Productions, in 1961. Based at the Arts Theatre, Cambridge from 1964 until 1969, the company, with Toby Robertson as artistic director and Richard Cottrell as associate director, toured both nationally and internationally with a mainly classical repertoire, providing notable appearances of such actors as Ian McKellen and Timothy West. The company became closely associated with the Edinburgh Festival after its first appearance there in 1967. Separating from the Arts Theatre in 1969, the company, renamed The Prospect Theatre Company, survived without a permanent base for the next eight years under the direction of Toby Robertson, mounting productions in which Derek Jacobi and Dorothy Tutin made significant appearances. Eventually the company found a new home at London's Old Vic in 1977: two years later it became the Old Vic Theatre Company. Though noted for its exemplary ensemble playing, the company lost its Arts Council of Great Britain funding in 1980 after Timothy West's first season as Robertson's successor, leading to Prospect's demise.\n\nIain Mackintosh, Richard Cottrell and Elizabeth Sweeting formed Prospect Productions in 1961 to present a summer season of plays at the Oxford Playhouse. A successful first season led to a further season in 1962. The following year, when the Playhouse closed for renovations, Prospect became a touring company associated with the Century Theatre. Toby Robertson directed the last play of the season, Vanbrugh's \"The Provoked Wife\", with Eileen Atkins and Trevor Martin. The production opened the newly restored Georgian Theatre Royal in Richmond, North Yorkshire, then transferred to the Vaudeville Theatre, London. The success of the Oxford seasons prompted the idea that Prospect should present productions beyond the summer season each year.\n\nIn 1964, with support from the Arts Council of Great Britain and Dr. George Rylands, Prospect became a touring company based at the Arts Theatre, Cambridge, with Toby Robertson as artistic director, Richard Cottrell as associate director, and Iain Mackintosh as administrator. Between 1964 and 1966 Prospect staged 15 productions, presenting well-known plays as well as several rarely performed Classics including Vanbrugh's \"The Confederacy\", with Robert Eddison and Hy Hazell, to celebrate the third centenary of Vanbrugh's birth, and Etherege's \"The Man of Mode\", and a number of new plays. Timothy West joined the Company in 1966 to play Prospero. Later that year Prospect had its first invitation to the Edinburgh Festival.\n\nProspect's first Edinburgh Festival appearance in 1967 was with Chekhov's \"The Cherry Orchard\", Lila Kedrova playing Madam Ranyevskaya in Cottrell's production. The production transferred to London, where Kedrova won the \"Evening Standard\" Best Actress of the Year Award. 1968 saw the production of Prospect's first \"musical\" - Gay's \"Beggar's Opera\", which was also the first Prospect show to be televised, and in 1969 the Company appeared for the first time at the Assembly Hall.\n\nAt the 1969 Edinburgh festival Ian McKellen made his breakthrough performances with the company as Richard II (directed by Cottrell) and Marlowe's Edward II (directed by Robertson), the latter in the play's first professional revival for 300 years and causing a storm of protest over the enactment of the homosexual Edward's lurid death. Timothy West appeared as McKellen's sparring partner in both those productions, which subsequently toured Britain and Europe before being staged at the Mermaid Theatre in London and breaking box-office records at the Piccadilly Theatre.\n\nBetween 1967 and 1977 Prospect was invited to appear at eight Edinburgh International Festivals, and largely as a result of its close association with the Edinburgh Festival, Prospect was asked to tour abroad for the British Council, visiting the Middle East, Russia, Hong Kong, and Australia.\n\nIn 1969 the Company was asked to extend its touring to the large \"No 1\" theatres in the regions; at the same time the Cambridge Arts Theatre wanted Prospect to help in the formation of a new theatre company. As these two developments pointed in totally different directions with implications of a conflicting scale of work, Richard Cottrell left Prospect to become director of the newly formed Cambridge Theatre Company: Toby Robertson became cirector of Prospect, and its role as the UK's leading touring company was recognised, with its new name - The Prospect Theatre Company.\n\nUnder Robertson, the company pioneered a style of production in which stage designs and setting were kept to a minimum, partly from the belief that Shakespeare's plays in particular benefited from an uncluttered approach; this style also suited the company's needs when touring regional theatres, for which flexibility of staging was essential. Emphasis was placed instead on quality acting and strikingly designed costumes, complemented by lighting and incidental music. Carl Davis composed several scores for the company, including for a modern dress production of \"Love's Labours Lost\" (1971), \"Pericles\" (1973), and \"Pilgrim's Progress\" (1974/5) which led directly to the musical \"War Music\" (1977) with words by Homer and Christopher Logue and music by Donald Fraser.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1976 four major productions were created each year. As the only major company touring nationally, the choice of repertoire tended to be drawn more from the classics at the expense of new work. But alongside several Shakespeare productions the company staged such plays as Thomas Otway's \"Venice Preserv'd\", Charles Macklin's \"The Man of the World\", Turgenev's \"A Month in the Country\" (with Derek Jacobi, Timothy West and Dorothy Tutin, who won two major acting awards for her performance), Chekhov's \"Ivanov\", and Peter Shaffer's \"Royal Hunt of the Sun\". A series of chamber works were commissioned, including Jane McCulloch's \"The Grand Tour\" for the Entry into Europe celebrations - an entertainment seen in London, Edinburgh, and the 1974 Brighton Festival.\n\nThe strain of touring and meeting the increasingly high standards expected by theatre audiences throughout the country began to tell, and even with occasional London seasons either at the Round House or in the West end, it was felt increasingly desirable that Prospect should once again have a permanent and preferably metropolitan base to sustain its regional work.\n\nLooking for a suitable London base, Robertson believed that the Old Vic would best meet the company's needs and would add lustre to its reputation. For two years he sustained a campaign for the Old Vic to make Prospect its resident company. For the Old Vic, Robertson's overtures proved increasingly hard to resist in the face of poor box office returns achieved by productions staged by other companies at the theatre; against this, Prospect staged a highly successful season which opened in May 1977, including \"Hamlet\" with Derek Jacobi, \"Antony and Cleopatra\" with Alec McCowen and Dorothy Tutin; and \"Saint Joan\" with Eileen Atkins. In July the Governors of The Old Vic announced \"a marriage that was all but a merger\" between the Vic and Prospect. In September Toby Robertson, director of Prospect, was asked to take artistic control of The Old Vic, and Christopher Richards, general manager of The Old Vic, became general manager of Prospect.\n\nOne major problem, though, was the terms of Prospect's funding by the Arts Council: this was on the basis of it being a touring company, and the Council - already funding the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company in London - could not accept a case for a third major company in the capital and repeatedly refused requests to fund any London seasons staged by Prospect. Therefore any London-based productions would have to succeed financially without Arts Council support. Prospect's first season at the Old Vic recouped its costs but left no surplus to fund future productions. Further stagings by visiting companies were box office failures and stretched the theatre's finances to breaking point.\n\nYet Prospect continued to draw audiences to the Old Vic where other companies failed. The company played a five-month season from January to May 1978, adding \"Twelfth Night\" to their repertory, and a four-month season from September to December presenting \"The Rivals\", \"The Lady's Not for Burning\" with Atkins, and \"King Lear\" with Anthony Quayle in the title role. In December that year, the governors of the Old Vic agreed to a five-year contract with Prospect, announcing to the press on 23 April that henceforth they would be styled \"Prospect Productions Ltd., trading as the Old Vic Company\". Unfortunately Prospect's touring commitments kept the company out of the theatre for the first half of 1979, leaving the theatre to sink further into debt. The company returned in July with Jacobi's \"Hamlet\" (toured afterwards to Denmark, Australia and China, the first English theatre company to tour that country), followed by \"Romeo and Juliet\", and \"The Government Inspector\" with Ian Richardson. The following season, however, proved controversial: the double bill of \"The Padlock\" and \"Miss in Her Teens\", to mark the bicentenary of David Garrick's death, and a revival of \"What the Butler Saw\" were deemed by the Arts Council unsuitable for touring repertory. An internal report by Prospect now questioned \"whether Prospect can any longer satisfy the triple task of filling the Vic, of satisfying the [Arts Council] Director of Touring's requirements for product of a certain familiar sort, and of realising the vision of Toby Robertson\".\n\nRobertson was in effect fired from the post of artistic director in 1980 while he was abroad with the company in China, Timothy West replacing him. The following season, West's first as Robertson's successor, saw \"Macbeth\" with Peter O'Toole, \"The Merchant of Venice\" with West as Shylock, and a gala performance presented to the Queen Mother to celebrate her eightieth birthday. On 22 December 1980, four days after the gala performance, the Arts Council withdrew its funding from the Company, sealing its demise. In January the company left for its pre-arranged tour of Hong Kong and Australia. Appeals to the Council for funding to be reinstated were denied. The company gave a final season at the Old Vic staging \"The Merchant of Venice\", then gave a final tour of Europe, giving its last performance in Rome on 14 June before disbanding.\n"}

It had been scheduled for release in late 2009, but was ultimately cancelled. The promotional material used the slogan, \"It's time to fight back.\"\n\nCompany director Zarrar Chishti, quoted in Scotland's \"Sunday Mail\" said in 2009: \"It's been in production for a year and two months. The player start the game with the orange boiler suit, cuffs and ear muffs.\nThere are certain rules we can't break after meeting politicians so we are not making the game too extreme.\nWe have had a lot of hate mail about this, mainly from America, saying things like, 'Don't dare put out a game that shows them killing our soldiers.'\nBut no US or British soldiers get killed in it. The only ones being killed are mercenaries. We have set it in January 2010 because that's when we think the camp will be closed.\nWe are making a statement. We did not want Guantanamo to be forgotten.\"\nThe game was cancelled citing \"inaccurate\" details posted on various websites detailing about the game and the \"extreme reaction that the game and its popular misconceptions have provoked.\" Zarrar Chishti, the director at T-Enterprise, wrote an official statement on June 3 regarding the cancellation of Rendition: Guantanamo on the game's official website, which previously showed the teaser trailer for the game. He claims that the main character was not going to be Moazzam Begg, an actual detainee of Guantanamo, but was instead going to be a man named Adam. He also states no American or British soldiers would be killed, but instead the institution would be run by mercenaries.\n\nChishti states \"T-Enterprise is against all forms of terrorism and would never seek to advocate otherwise. Furthermore, Guantanamo was to be a mercenary run institution and so there would have been NO American military personnel killed within the game. Again, we support the British and American troops that fight the war against terrorism to make the world a safer place and would not make a game that said otherwise.\"\n\nThe game company was also claimed to be working with Al-Qaeda, which Chishti repudiates saying, \"Having clarified our position on terrorism, I would now like to refute all suggestions that the game was in any way linked to Al Qaeda. T-Enterprise has never had and would never have a link to Al Qaeda in any way, shape or form.\"\n\n\n"}

The show documents RuPaul in the search for \"America's next drag superstar.\" RuPaul plays the role of host, mentor, and head judge for this series, as contestants are given different challenges each week. \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" employs a panel of judges, including RuPaul, Michelle Visage, Ross Mathews, Carson Kressley, and a host of other guest judges, who critique contestants' progress throughout the competition. The title of the show is a play on drag queen and drag racing, and the title sequence and song \"Drag Race\" both have a drag-racing theme.\n\n\"RuPaul's Drag Race\" has spanned ten seasons and inspired the spin-off shows \"RuPaul's Drag U\" and \"\". The show has become the highest-rated television program on Logo TV, and airs internationally, including in Australia, Canada, UK, The Netherlands, and Israel. The show earned RuPaul three consecutive Emmys (2016 to 2018) for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program. The show itself was awarded as a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program in 2018 and the Outstanding Reality Program award at the 21st GLAAD Media Awards. It has been nominated for 4 Critics' Choice Television Award including Best Reality Series – Competition and Best Reality Show Host for RuPaul, and was nominated for a Creative Arts Emmy Award for Outstanding Make-up for a Multi-Camera Series or Special (Non-Prosthetic). In January 2018, casting began for season eleven. Later in 2018, the show became the first show to win a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program and a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program in the same year.\n\nCasting calls are announced online, where prospective contestants submit audition tapes in hopes of being cast. All contestants selected must be 21 years of age or older at the time of taping. \n\nRuPaul plays several roles in the show: host, coach, and judge. \"USA Today\"'s Lifeline explains: \"RuPaul the drag queen will be the final word in judging and eliminations, while RuPaul the man will offer guidance to contestants for each challenge.\" \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" uses progressive elimination to reduce the number of drag queens in the competition from the initial field of fourteen contestants (the maximum a season has started with) down to the final three or four, who will compete in the final challenge. In Seasons 1, 2, and 3, the contestants were narrowed down to a final two, with a winner being selected the final episode. Each episode (with the exception of the casting special, \"recap\" episode, and reunion special) follows a format consisting of a mini challenge, a main challenge, a runway walk (where the contestants model fashion on a runway, usually with a theme based on the main challenge), the judging panel, a lipsync battle, and the elimination of a contestant. There have been some exceptions to episodes, including double-elimination episodes, no-elimination episodes, disqualifications of a contestant, and the removal of a contestant due to an injury.\n\nIn the mini challenge, each contestant is asked to perform a different task with varying requirements and time limitations. Certain mini challenges are repeated from season to season. For instance, the first mini challenge of the first six seasons is a photo shoot with the photographer Mike Ruiz that includes some kind of special twist (such as being doused with water while in full drag, having a high-powered fan turned on during the shoot, or being photographed while jumping on a trampoline). Another recurring mini challenge is dedicated to \"reading,\" a drag term for making insulting observations about one's peers for comedic effect. The winner of a mini challenge is sometimes rewarded with some kind of advantage in the main challenge. Though most episodes have a mini challenge, select episodes do not and progress straight to the main challenge.\n\nThe requirements of the maxi challenge vary across each episode, and can be individual or group challenges, and initially grant immunity to the winner in the next challenge (until RuPaul announces the discontinuation of that policy mid-season). However, as of season 6, immunity is no longer granted to challenge winners. The winner of the maxi challenge also receives a \"special\" prize for their win. In the past, challenge winners have been rewarded with prizes including custom designer clothing, vacations, cruises, and quality cosmetic items. The final maxi challenge of every season up to season 8 is where the contestants star in RuPaul's music video.\n\nThe goal of each maxi challenge involves a new theme and outcome. Contestants are often asked to design and construct a custom outfit, sometimes incorporating unconventional materials. Other challenges focus on the contestants' ability to present themselves on camera, perform with music, or perform humorously. Some challenges become a tradition across seasons, such as the Snatch Game.\n\nBeginning with the seventh season, Michelle Visage, Ross Mathews and Carson Kressley are the staple judges alongside RuPaul. Visage joined the show at the start of season 3, while Mathews and Kressley joined at the start of season 7, and each joins RuPaul and Visage on alternate episodes. Past fixtures on the panel include Merle Ginsberg, who was a regular judge in the first two seasons, and Santino Rice, who held his position from the first season until the conclusion of the sixth. Until season 8, Rice was the only person, apart from RuPaul, to take part in every season of the show, serving as a main judge for seasons one through six, and all stars 1, and guest judging for season seven. In certain instances, Rice was absent and replacement judging has been provided by make-up artist Billy Brasfield (better known as Billy B), Mike Ruiz, Jeffrey Moran (Absolut Vodka marketing executive), or Lucian Piane. However, due to Brasfield's numerous appearances in seasons three and four, including appearing in the Reunited episodes both seasons, Rice and Billy B are considered to have been alternates for the same seat at the judges table throughout the two seasons.\n\nPrior to the grande finale, the three main judges are joined by two celebrity guest judges each week. Guest judges have included Pam Tillis, Paula Abdul, Pamela Anderson, Eve, Ariana Grande, Neil Patrick Harris, Kathy Griffin, Debbie Harry, Khloé Kardashian, La Toya Jackson, Adam Lambert, Demi Lovato, Bob Mackie, Rose McGowan, Olivia Newton-John, Rebecca Romijn, Gigi Hadid, Sharon Osbourne, Dan Savage, John Waters, Michelle Williams, Candis Cayne, Martha Wash, Natalie Cole, Dita Von Teese, Niecy Nash, Debbie Reynolds, Vanessa Williams, Wilmer Valderrama, The Pointer Sisters, Trina, Leah Remini, The B-52's, Kesha, Shania Twain, Graham Norton, Christina Aguilera, and Lady Gaga.\n\nThe judges each provide their opinion on the contestants' performances in the main challenge and on the runway before RuPaul announces which queen is the episode's winner and which two had the weakest performances. The day before judging, the contestants are all provided with a song to which they must learn the lyrics. The contestants deemed as being the bottom two must \"lip sync for their lives\" to the song in a final attempt to impress RuPaul. After the lip sync, RuPaul alone decides who stays and who leaves. RuPaul describes the qualities the contestants must have to be crowned the winner of the show as \"Charisma, Uniqueness, Nerve, and Talent... These are people who have taken adversity and turned it into something that is beautiful and something powerful.\" The phrase \"charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent\" is used repeatedly on the show, the acronym of which is CUNT. On the , \"synergy\" was added to provide an explanation behind the contestants being sorted into teams (expanding the acronym into CUNTS).\n\nThe first season of \"Drag Race\" was accompanied by a seven-episode web series, titled \"Under the Hood of RuPaul's Drag Race\". LOGOonline published a webisode of \"Under the Hood\" after each episode of \"Drag Race\". In this companion series, RuPaul presents a documentary of contestants' conversation in the green room, replays pertinent moments from \"Drag Race\", and airs deleted footage.\n\nStarting with the second season of \"Drag Race\" in 2010, Logo reformatted \"Under the Hood\", increased its production budget, moved it from the web to television, and re-titled it to \"RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked\". Logo broadcast an episode of \"Untucked\" after each episode of \"Drag Race\". \"Untucked\" replaces the basic green room of \"Under the Hood\" with two decorated rooms that were until season 6 sponsored by Absolut Vodka and Interior Illusions, Inc.: the Interior Illusions Lounge and the Gold Bar. FormDecor sponsored the Lounge for season 6. These two backstage areas allow for separated group conversation.\n\nAt the start of the seventh season of the \"Drag Race\", \"Untucked\" reverted to a webseries, as part of the World of Wonder YouTube page. Instead of two decorated rooms, \"Untucked\" was moved back to the one room, an empty backstage space that connects to the main stage and work room, with couches for contestants to chat on. The newly renovated version also follows contestants following their elimination from the show, documenting them packing their belongings and leaving the set. The webseries format continued for the eighth and ninth season. For the show's tenth season, \"Untucked\" returned to television, where it airs on VH1 during the 30 minute time slot after the 90 minute episode airs.\n\nContestants of any sexual orientation or gender identity are accepted, although most contestants to date have been gay men. Transgender women are also eligible to compete and have become more common as seasons have progressed. Sonique, a season two contestant, became the first openly transgender contestant; she came out as transgender during the Season 2 reunion special. Monica Beverly Hillz, from season five, became the first transgender woman to reveal her status during the competition. Other transgender contestants have begun transitioning after their elimination. Carmen Carrera, a season three contestant, announced her transition during an episode of ABC's \"Primetime: What Would You Do?\" Season 4 contestant Kenya Michaels announced her own transition via Facebook and Twitter. Other transgender contestants include Stacy Layne Matthews, Jiggly Caliente, Gia Gunn, and Peppermint. Peppermint is the first drag race contestant to have been out as a transgender woman prior to the airing of her season, but after filming. Although transgender women have competed in the show, none of the contestants had come out as transgender prior to being casted on the show. All transgender contestants have come out as transgender either during the course of the competition, or after their respective season had ended. RuPaul has stated that transgender women contrast with his view of what the art of drag is defined by.\n\nThe first season of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\", later referred as \"The Lost Season\", premiered in the United States on February 2, 2009, on Logo. Nine contestants were selected to compete in the running of becoming \"America's Next Drag Superstar.\" The winner of the first season won a lifetime supply of MAC Cosmetics, was featured in an LA Eyeworks campaign, joined the Logo Drag Race tour, and won a cash prize of $20,000. One of the nine contestants to compete on \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" was determined by an audience vote via the show's official website. The results were announced in early September 2008. The contestant to win this honor was Nina Flowers from Bayamón, Puerto Rico (currently residing in Denver, Colorado). The theme song playing during the runway every episode was \"Cover Girl\" from RuPaul's album \"Champion\". The winner of the first season of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" was BeBe Zahara Benet, with Nina Flowers winning Miss Congeniality.\n\nIn late 2013, Logo re-aired the first season, which was titled \"RuPaul's Drag Race: The Lost Season Ru-Vealed\", and featured commentary from RuPaul\n\nFor season two, the number of contestants was increased from nine to twelve, and the prizes were slightly modified: a lifetime supply of Nyx Cosmetics and be the face of nyxcosmetics.com, an exclusive one year public relations contract with LGBT firm Project Publicity, be featured an LA Eyeworks campaign, join the Logo Drag Race tour, and a cash prize of $25,000. A new tradition of writing a farewell message in lipstick on the workstation mirror was started by the first eliminated queen of the season, Shangela Laquifa Wadley. The theme song playing during the runway and the end credits every episode is \"Jealous of My Boogie\" from RuPaul's album \"Champion\". Each week's episode is followed by a behind-the-scenes show, \"RuPaul's Drag Race Untucked\". The winner of the second season of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" was Tyra Sanchez, with Pandora Boxx winning Miss Congeniality.\n\nOn December 6, 2011, Amazon.com released this season on DVD via their CreateSpace program.\n\nThis season had Michelle Visage replacing Merle Ginsberg at the judge's table and Billy Brasfield (better known as Billy B), Mike Ruiz, and Jeffrey Moran (courtesy of Absolut Vodka) filling in for Santino Rice's absence during several episodes. Billy B, celebrity makeup artist and star of the HGTV mini-series \"Hometown Renovation\", appeared as a judge in five episodes. Whereas Mike Ruiz only judged for two episodes, and Jeffrey Moran for one, Moran only appearing for promotional reasons. Due to Billy B's continued appearances, he and Rice are now considered to have been alternate judges for the same seat at the judges table. Other changes made included the introduction of a wildcard contestant from the past season, Shangela; an episode with no elimination; and a contestant, Carmen Carrera, being brought back into the competition after having been eliminated a few episodes prior. A new pit crew was also introduced consisting of Jason Carter and Shawn Morales. The theme song playing during the runway every episode was changed to \"Champion\" while the song playing during the credits is \"Main Event\", both from RuPaul's album \"Champion\". As with the previous season, each week's episode was followed by a behind-the-scenes show, \"RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked\". The winner of the third season of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" was Raja, with Yara Sofia winning Miss Congeniality.\n\nOn December 6, 2011 Amazon.com released this season on DVD via their CreateSpace program.\n\nThe fourth season of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" began airing on January 30, 2012, with cast members announced November 13, 2011. The winner of season four will headline Logo's Drag Race Tour featuring Absolut Vodka, wins a one-of-a-kind trip, a lifetime supply of NYX Cosmetics, a cash prize of $100,000, and the title of \"America's Next Drag Superstar.\" Like the last season, Santino Rice & Billy B (Billy Brasfield), celebrity makeup artist and star of the HGTV mini-series \"Hometown Renovation\", shared the same seat at the judges table alternatively, Brasfield filling in for Rice when needed. Both judges appeared side-by-side in the audience during the \"Reunited\" episode. The winner of the fourth season of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" was Sharon Needles, with Latrice Royale winning Miss Congeniality.\n\nThe theme song playing during the runway every episode was \"Glamazon\" and the song played during the credits was \"The Beginning\", both from RuPaul's album \"Glamazon\".\n\nThe fifth season of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" began airing on January 28, 2013, with a 90-minute premiere episode.

For example, Popbytes commented \"Drag Race\" has been accused numerous times of keeping some of the more unpleasant but 'feminine' queens in the competition for the sake of drama . However, Common Sense Media commented, \"\"RuPaul's Drag Race\" combines the fashion design drama of \"Project Runway\" with the modeling excitement of \"America's Next Top Model\" to create an entertainingly voyeuristic glimpse into the performance art world of drag queens. There's plenty of over-the-top stuff, but rather than simply treating drag performers as people to be laughed at and/or scorned, the show also focuses on the hard work and talent that goes into drag performances.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" cited the elimination of comedian and eventual season two fan favorite Pandora Boxx as the season's most controversial.\n\nIn March 2014, \"Drag Race\" sparked controversy over the use of the term \"shemale\" in the season 6 mini challenge \"Female or She-male?\".

Season nine winner, Sasha Velour, has expressed her disagreement via Twitter, stating \"My drag was born in a community full of trans women, trans men, and gender non-conforming folks doing drag. That’s the real world of drag, like it or not. I thinks it’s fabulous and I will fight my entire life to protect and uplift it\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24532695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24532695", "title": "White Rats of America", "text": "White Rats of America\n\nThe White Rats was a fraternal organization formed by vaudeville performers, led by George Fuller Golden, as a labor union to support the rights of male performers. Women were not allowed to join. The White Rats attempted to combat the monopolistic practices of the United Booking Office (UBO) and the Vaudeville Managers Association (VMA), groups formed by vaudeville theater managers to keep performers' wages low and control when and where performers were allowed to work. It was based on the Grand Order of Water Rats, a British entertainment industry fraternity and charity. It received a charter from the American Federation of Labor in 1910. The union staged several strikes but ultimately disbanded.\n\nGolden wrote a book about the White Rats, \"My Lady Vaudeville and her White Rats\", which was published in 1909 by the Broadway Publishing Company. This book lists the following members:\n\n\nDirectors:\n\nIt only allowed male performers to join.\n\nThe White Rats met on Twenty-third street in New York City, in a space above Koster & Bial's Music Hall between Broadway and Sixth Avenue.\n565\n\nSoon after the White Rats union was formed in 1900, its leadership committee attempted to negotiate with the VMA, led by E.F. Albee and B.F. Keith, to reduce or remove a 5% kickback each act was forced to pay in exchange for being booked on the lucrative VMA circuit. After negotiations failed, the White Rats called a strike in February 1901.\n\nThe Western States branch of the VMA gave in to the union's demands, and the Eastern branch went without vaudeville for two weeks. Keith and Albee called a meeting with the performers in which they claimed they themselves had been against the 5% commission, and would ask the other members of the VMA to remove it. Albee and Keith also agreed to go on the record in the press as being against the 5% commission if the strike was called off, and they did so. As a result, the strike was called off, and performers began to sign contracts with the VMA again in order to secure valuable long-term performing contracts.\n\nThe White Rats staged a strike in 1916 to protest poor treatment by vaudeville bookers. In retaliation, Vaudeville managers, led by Albee, created a blacklist that prevented any known members of the White Rats from working in any of the 10,000 to 15,000 theaters under his control. Performers often couldn't afford to be out of work, or to work at a reduced rate because of suspected union membership, and the strike collapsed within a year. The White Rats disbanded not long thereafter.\n\n"}
