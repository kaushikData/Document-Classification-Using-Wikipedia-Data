Barnes Circus was an American circus run by Alpheus George Barnes Stonehouse.\n\nStonehouse started his show in 1895 with a pony, a phonograph, and a stereopticon. By 1929, the \"Al G. Barnes Wild Animal Show\" had grown to 5-rings and it was purchased by the American Circus Corporation. American Circus already owned the Sells-Floto Circus, John Robinson Shows, Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus, and Sparks Circus. That same year John Ringling, the owner of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, bought out the American Circus Corporation.\n\nThe five circuses that were part of that acquisition continued to tour under their own names, but were closed one-by-one during the Great Depression. In 1937 the Al G. Barnes Wild Animal Show and Sells Floto were combined into one circus. That circus, Al G. Barnes Sells-Floto toured in 1937 and 1938.\n\nIn 1938 the co-owned Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey Combined Shows was experiencing labor problems which ultimately led to the circus being closed after performances in Scranton, Pennsylvania on June 22. After regrouping at the circus winter quarters in Sarasota, Florida the Ringling-Barnum circus trains were dispatched to Redfield, South Dakota where the two circuses met and were combined into a yet larger circus featuring many of the major stars from Ringling-Barnum. The circus toured from July 11 until November 27, 1938 as \"Al G. Barnes and Sells-Floto Circus Presenting Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Stupendous New Features\". \"Among the attractions that were featured were big game hunter \"Bring 'em Back Alive Frank Buck\" and Gargantua (gorilla). When the show finished its season however, rather than returning to its own winter quarters in Baldwin Park, California, the circus trains traveled to the Ringling winter quarters near Sarasota, Florida, never to emerge again.\"\n\nOne of their more famous animals was Black Diamond, an Indian elephant whose unpredictable temper resulted in the deaths of several people and was shot between 50-100 times in 1929, before his own death.\n\nAlthough the Al G. Barnes Circus featured many traditional acts associated with circuses, it was known for its wild animal acts. Mabel Stark, the tiger trainer was associated with the circus for many years. Stark joined the circus in 1911, first presenting a horse act. In 1916 she began presenting tigers in the center ring of the wild animal show. Although she left the circus in 1922, she returned in 1930. Bert Nelson was another wild animal trainer who appeared on the circus in the late 1930s. For many seasons, the elephants were trained and presented by Frank \"Cheerful\" Gardner. Eddie Woenecker became the circus' bandmaster in 1913 and stayed with the circus through 1922. He returned to the circus in 1936 and continued to perform in that capacity through the 1938 season.\n\nIn 1914 the Al G. Barnes Circus began wintering in Venice, California near the Venice lagoon. It continued to winter at that location until November 1920 when the circus trains returned for the winter to a new location on Washington Boulevard between Venice and Culver City, California. The Al G. Barnes Circus was known as a \"Wild Animal Show,\" and in December 1923 the \"Barnes Circus Zoo\" opened at the corner of Washington Boulevard and McLaughlin Avenue in Culver City. The Zoo cost 79,000 to build and at the time was kept open even when the show was touring. The area where the winter quarters and zoo were located were incorporated into the short-lived town of Barnes City, California. The area was eventually annexed into both Culver City in 1925 and Los Angeles in 1926.\n\nFollowing the annexation of the winter quarters property, Barnes relocated his winter quarters into an unincorporated area in the San Gabriel Valley in 1927. The 300 acres were on Valley Boulevard midway between Baldwin Park and El Monte. From 1927 until 1938 the circus returned to the Baldwin Park quarters, however at two separate locations. At the conclusion of the 1932 season the show unloaded about a half mile east of the original location and that is where it remained until 1938 when most of the equipment was transferred to the Ringling winter quarters in Sarasota at the end of the season.\n\n\"King of the Jungle\" is a 1933 Paramount Pictures film that includes animals, performers and scenes from the Al G. Barnes Circus and winter quarters in 1932. Although the movie is set on the lot of \"Corey's Circus,\" it was actually filmed on location at the first Baldwin Park winter quarters. Several acts from the circus that season are featured, including Mabel Stark's tiger act. The tigers are mid-performance at the time that the big top catches fire during the film's climatic moments.\n\nOn May 15, 1922, a large circus elephant known as Tusko escaped from the Al G. Barnes Circus while it was in Sedro-Woolley, Washington. The elephant demolished fences, knocked over laundry lines and trees, telephone poles, and overturned a Model T.\n\nIn July 1930, a train wreck happened In the Canadian Province of New Brunswick near the city of Moncton in the small community of Canaan Station, killing 4 people and injuring several others.\n\n\n"}

He is a singer, songwriter and guitarist, as well as a campaigner for the rights of Indigenous Australians.\n\nRoach's debut solo album, \"Charcoal Lane\", was released in 1990. It featured the song \"Took the Children Away\", which was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia registry in 2013.\nAlso in 2013 he won a Deadly Award for Lifetime Contribution to Healing the Stolen Generations as well as for Album of the Year. Along with fellow Deadly winner Pat O'Shane, he called for an end to the Northern Territory Intervention. Roach has toured around the globe, headlining and opening shows for Joan Armatrading, Bob Dylan, Billy Bragg, Tracy Chapman, Suzanne Vega and Patti Smith.\n\nArchibald William Roach was born on 8 January 1956 in Mooroopna, Victoria. Mooroopna is named after an Aboriginal word referring to a bend in the Goulburn River, near Shepparton in central Victoria. According to Roach, \"My name is Archie Roach and I represent 'Nature's gifts' because my song \"Took the Children Away\" won a human rights award. My lyrics draw attention to, the hardship and humiliation suffered by many Indigenous Australians.\" In 1956, Roach's family, along with the rest of the area's Indigenous population, were re-housed on Rumbalara mission. Roach and his family subsequently moved to Framlingham, where his mother had been born.\n\nAt the age of 4, Roach and his sisters, along with the other Indigenous Australian children of the stolen generations, were forcibly removed from their family by Australian government agencies and placed in an orphanage. After two unpleasant placements in foster care, Roach was eventually fostered by Alex and Dulcie Cox, a family of Scottish immigrants in Melbourne. Alex Cox would sing traditional ballads and introduced Roach to guitar and keyboards. Roach said \"He was a big influence on me — a good influence. I'll love him to the day I die.\"\n\nAt the age of fifteen, Roach was contacted by his natural sister, who told him their birth mother had just died. He spent the next fourteen years on the streets, battling alcoholism. Roach met his future wife, Ruby Hunter, at a Salvation Army drop-in centre when she was sixteen. \n\nIn the late 1980s, Roach and Hunter formed a band, the Altogethers, with several other Indigenous Australians and moved to Melbourne. Roach wrote his first song, \"Took the Children Away\", which he performed on a community radio station in Melbourne and on an Indigenous current affairs program in 1988. Australian musician Paul Kelly invited Roach to open his concert early in 1989, where he performed \"Took the Children Away\", a song telling the story of the Stolen Generations and his own experience of being forcibly removed from his family. His performance was met with stunned silence, followed by shattering applause. \n\nIn 1990, with the encouragement of Kelly, Roach recorded his debut solo album, \"Charcoal Lane\", which was released in May 1990. The album was certified gold and awarded two ARIA Awards at the 1991 ceremony. The album included \"Took the Children Away\" which became one of the most important songs in Australia's contemporary history. In 1992, it won an international Human Rights Achievement Award and featured in the top 50 albums for 1992 by \"Rolling Stone\" magazine. \n\nIn May 1993, Roach released his second studio album, \"Jamu Dreaming\". The album was recorded with musical assistance from David Bridie, Tiddas, Paul Kelly, Vika and Linda Bull, Ruby Hunter, Dave Arden and Joe Geia. The album peaked at number 55 on the ARIA Charts.\n\nIn 1995, Roach toured extensively throughout the US, Canada, the UK and Europe. He returned to Australia to record the title track for ATSIC's Native Title CD, \"Our Home, Our Land\", with Tiddas, Kev Carmody, Bart Willoughby, Shane Howard and Bunna Laurie. In 1996, Roach performed as part of a presentation to the Human Rights Commission's Inquiry into the Stolen Generations, before embarking on a national tour as a guest of Tracy Chapman.\n\nIn October 1997, Roach released his third studio album, \"Looking for Butter Boy\", which was recorded on his traditional land at Port Fairy in south-western Victoria. The album's lead single, \"Hold On Tight\", won the ARIA Award for Best Indigenous Release in 1997 and the album won the same award at the 1998 award ceremony.\n\nIn July 2002, Roach released his fourth studio album, \"Sensual Being\", which peaked at number 59 on the ARIA charts. In 2002, he worked on the Rolf de Heer film \"The Tracker\".\n\nIn 2004, Roach and Hunter collaborated with the Australian Art Orchestra and Paul Grabowsky to create a musical experience titled \"Ruby\". \"Ruby\" tells the story of Ruby Hunter from her birth near a billabong on the banks of the Murray River, through the stolen generation, search for identity and the discovery of hope through love. In 2004, it won The Deadly Awards for \"Excellence in Film & Theatrical Score\".\n\nIn October 2007, Roach released \"Journey\", an album of songs as a companion piece to a documentary film called \"Liyarn Ngarn\", made with Roach, Patrick Dodson and Pete Postlethwaite.\n\nIn November 2009, ABC Music released previously unreleased Roach recordings from 1988 under the album title \"1988\".\n\nIn October 2012, Roach released \"Into the Bloodstream\", an album he described as being built on pain following the death of his wife in February 2010. \n\nIn October 2013, Roach released \"Creation\", a 4-CD box set of his first four studio albums. The album was released to coincide with the premiere of Roach's new live show, also entitled Creation, which debuted at the inaugural Boomerang Festival in Byron Bay from 4-6 October 2013.\n\nAt the APRA Music Awards of 2015 2015, Roach (and Shane Howard) won Best Original Song Composed for the Screen \"The Secret River\" from \"The Secret River\".\n\nIn November 2015, Roach celebrated the 25th anniversary of \"Charcoal Lane\" with a deluxe remastered edition. The new edition included a second disc featuring previously unreleased \"Triple J - Live At The Wireless\" recordings and new interpretations of classic \"Charcoal Lane\" material by various artists. In November and December 2015, Roach undertook a national tour to celebrate the album's 25th anniversary.\n\nIn November 2016, Roach released his seventh studio album, \"Let Love Rule\", which peaked at number 24 on the ARIA Charts, becoming his highest charting album to date.\n\nAt the APRA Music Awards of 2017 in March 2017, Roach won the Ted Albert Award for Outstanding Services to Australian Music.\n\nIn April 2018, Roach performed at the Commonwealth Games Closing Ceremony on the Gold Coast with Amy Shark.\n\nRoach currently lives on a homestead near Berri, South Australia, with his children. His home has become something of a refuge for troubled Aboriginal youngsters, now dealing with some of the problems he himself faced. Roach is a supporter of Justice Action, a criminal justice reform organisation based in Sydney, Australia.\n\nRoach's wife, Ruby Hunter, died on 17 February 2010 aged 54. On 14 October 2010, Roach suffered a stroke while working in the Kimberley region. After recuperating, he returned to live performance in April 2011. He has also survived lung cancer, due to early diagnosis in 2011 and major surgery.\n\nRoach has received five ARIA Music Awards from fourteen nominations. \n\n\nNotes\n\n"}

{"id": "3552022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3552022", "title": "Beat 'em up", "text": "Beat 'em up\n\nBeat 'em up (also known as brawler) is a video game genre featuring hand-to-hand combat between the protagonist and an improbably large number of opponents. Traditional beat 'em ups take place in scrolling, two-dimensional (2D) levels, though some later games feature more open three-dimensional (3D) environments with yet larger numbers of enemies. These games are noted for their simple gameplay, a source of both critical acclaim and derision. Two-player cooperative gameplay and multiple player characters are also hallmarks of the genre. Most of these games take place in urban settings and feature crime-fighting and revenge-based plots, though some games may employ historical, science fiction or fantasy themes.\n\nThe first beat 'em up was 1984's \"Kung-Fu Master\", with 1986's \"Renegade\" introducing the urban settings and underworld revenge themes employed extensively by later games. The genre then saw a period of high popularity between the release of \"Double Dragon\" in 1987, which defined the two-player cooperative mode central to classic beat 'em ups, and 1991's \"Street Fighter II\", which drew gamers towards one-on-one fighting games. Games such as \"Streets of Rage\", \"Final Fight\", \"Golden Axe\" and \"Battletoads\" are other classics to emerge from this period. The genre has been less popular since the emergence of 3D-based mass-market games, but still some beat 'em ups adapted the simple formula to utilize large-scale 3D environments.\n\nA beat 'em up (sometimes also called \"brawlers\") is a type of action game where the player character must fight a large number of enemies in unarmed combat or with melee weapons. Gameplay consists of walking through a level, one section at a time, defeating a group of enemies before advancing to the next section; a boss fight normally occurs at the end of each level. However arcade versions of these games are often quite difficult to win, causing players to spend more money.\n\nBeat 'em ups are related to—but distinct from—fighting games, which are based around one-on-one matches rather than scrolling levels and multiple enemies. Such terminology is loosely applied, however, as some commentators prefer to conflate the two terms. At times, both one-on-one fighting games and scrolling beat 'em ups have influenced each other in terms of graphics and style and can appeal to fans of either genre. Occasionally, a game will feature both kinds of gameplay.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, gaming magazines of the early 90s such as Mean Machines and Computer & Video Games (C+VG) refereed to all games which had a combat motif as beat 'em ups, even the fighting games. However, they were differentiated by a specific prefix and so games like \"Double Dragon\" or \"Final Fight\" were called \"scrolling beat 'em ups\" and games such as \"Street Fighter II\" or \"Mortal Kombat\" were referred to as a \"one on one beat 'em ups\".\n\nBeat 'em up games usually employ vigilante crime fighting and revenge plots with the action taking place on city streets, though historical and fantasy themed games also exist. Players must walk from one end of the game world to the other, and thus each game level will usually scroll horizontally. Some later beat 'em ups dispense with 2D-based scrolling levels, instead allowing the player to roam around larger 3D environments, though they retain the same simple gameplay and control systems. Throughout the level, players may acquire weapons that they can use as well as power-ups that replenish the player's health.\n\nAs players walk through the level, they are stopped by groups of enemies who must be defeated before they're able to continue. The level ends when all the enemies are defeated. Each level contains many identical groups of enemies, making these games notable for their repetition. In beat 'em up games, players often fight a boss—an enemy much stronger than the other enemies—at the end of each level.\n\nBeat 'em ups often allow the player to choose between a selection of protagonists—each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and set of moves. Attacks can include rapid combinations of basic attacks (combos) as well as jumping and grappling attacks. Characters often have their own special attacks, which leads to different strategies depending on which character the player selects. The control system is usually simple to learn, comprising as little as two buttons. These buttons can be combined to pull off combos, as well as jumping and grappling attacks. Since the release of \"Double Dragon\", many beat 'em ups have allowed two players to play the game cooperatively—a central aspect to the appeal of these games. Beat 'em ups are more likely to feature cooperative play than other game genres.\n\nThe first game to feature fist fighting was Sega's boxing game \"Heavyweight Champ\" (1976), which is viewed from a side-view perspective like later fighting games. However, it was Data East's fighting game \"Karate Champ\" (1984) which popularized martial arts themed games. The same year, Irem's Hong Kong cinema-inspired \"Kung-Fu Master\" (known as \"Spartan X\" in Japan) laid the foundations for side-scrolling beat 'em ups with its simple gameplay and multiple enemies. Also in 1984, \"Bruce Lee\" combined multi-player, multi-character combat with traditional collecting, platform and puzzle gameplay. Later that year, \"Karateka\" combined the one-on-one fight sequences of \"Karate Champ\" with the freedom of movement in \"Kung-Fu Master\", and it successfully experimented with adding plot to its fighting action. It was also among the first beat 'em ups to be successfully ported to home systems. \"Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun\", released in 1986 in Japan, deviated from the martial arts themes of earlier games and introduced street brawling to the genre. The Western adaptation \"Renegade\" (released the same year) added an underworld revenge plot that proved more popular with gamers than the principled combat sport of other games. \"Renegade\" set the standard for future beat 'em up games as it introduced the ability to move both horizontally and vertically. It also introduced the use of combo attacks; in contrast to earlier games, the opponents in \"Renegade\" and \"Double Dragon\" could take much more punishment, requiring a succession of punches, with the first hit temporarily immobilizing the enemy, making him unable to defend himself against successive punches.\n\nIn 1987, the release of \"Double Dragon\" ushered in a \"Golden Age\" for the beat 'em up genre that lasted nearly five years. The game was designed as Technōs Japan's spiritual successor to \"Renegade\", but it took the genre to new heights with its detailed set of martial arts attacks and its outstanding two-player cooperative gameplay. \"Double Dragon\"'s success resulted in a flood of beat 'em ups that came in the late 1980s, where acclaimed titles such as \"Golden Axe\" and \"Final Fight\" (both 1989) distinguished themselves from the others. \"Final Fight\" was Capcom's intended sequel to \"Street Fighter\" (provisionally titled \"Street Fighter '89\"), but the company ultimately gave it a new title. In contrast to the simple combo attacks in \"Renegade\" and \"Double Dragon\", the combo attacks in \"Final Fight\" were much more dynamic, and the sprites were much larger. Acclaimed as the best game in the genre, \"Final Fight\" spawned two home sequels and was later ported to other systems. \"Final Fight\" was also the reason for Capcom's new found fame and for Technos Japan's bankruptcy. \"Golden Axe\" was acclaimed for its visceral hack and slash action and cooperative mode and was influential through its selection of multiple protagonists with distinct fighting styles. It is considered one of the strongest beat 'em up titles for its fantasy elements, distinguishing it from the urban settings seen in other beat 'em ups. \"Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja\" featured platform elements, while \"\" took the weapon aspect a stage further, allowing the players to pick up guns. Another beat 'em up—\"River City Ransom\" (1989), named \"Street Gangs\" in Europe—featured role-playing game elements with which the player's character could be upgraded, using money stolen from defeated enemies.\n\nThe \"Streets of Rage\" series was launched in the early 1990s and borrowed heavily from \"Final Fight\". \"Streets of Rage 2\" for Sega's Mega Drive was notable for being one of the first console games to match the acclaim of arcade beat 'em ups. Its level design was praised for taking traditional beat 'em up settings and stringing them together in novel ways, and its success led to it being ported to arcades. The beat 'em up was also a popular genre for video games based on television series and movies, with \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" and \"Batman Returns\" a surprise success, and encouraged many more beat 'em up games based on the characters. However, the \"golden age\" of the genre ended in the wake of the success of Capcom's \"Street Fighter II\" (1991), which drew gamers back towards one-on-one fighting games, while the subsequent emerging popularity of 3D video games diminished the popularity of 2D-based pugilistic games in general. By the mid-1990s, the genre suffered from a lack of innovation.\n\nCore Design's \"Fighting Force\" (1997) was anticipated to redefine the genre for 32-bit consoles through its use of a 3D environment. However, it was met with a lukewarm reception. The \"Dynasty Warriors\" series, beginning with \"Dynasty Warriors 2\" in 2000, offered traditional beat 'em up action on large 3D battlefields, displaying dozens of characters on the screen at a time. The series to date spans 14 games (including expansions) which players in the West view as overly similar, although the games' creators claim their large audience in Japan appreciates the subtle differences between the titles. While critics saw \"Dynasty Warriors 2\" as innovative and technically impressive, they held a mixed opinion of later titles. These later games received praise for simple, enjoyable gameplay but were simultaneously derided as overly simplistic and repetitive. In 2000, Italian studio NAPS team released \"Gekido: Urban Fighters\" for the PlayStation console, which uses a fast paced beat 'em up system, with many bosses and a colorful design in terms of graphics. Another best-selling Japanese series, \"Yakuza\", combined elaborate plots and detailed interactive environments with street brawling action. Despite these releases, game reviewers started to pronounce that the genre had died off. By 2002, there were virtually no new beat 'em ups being released in arcades.\nCapcom's \"Viewtiful Joe\" (2003) used cel-shaded graphics and innovative gameplay features (such as the protagonist's special powers) to \"reinvigorate\" its traditional 2D scrolling formula. The Behemoth's \"Castle Crashers\" (2008) also featured cartoon graphics, quirky humor, and acclaimed cooperative gameplay. Rockstar Games' \"The Warriors\" (based on the 1979 movie of the same name), released in 2005, featured large scale brawling in 3D environments interspersed with other activities such as chase sequences. The game also featured a more traditional side-scrolling beat 'em up \"Armies of the Night\" as bonus content, which was acclaimed along with the main game and was later released on the PlayStation Portable. Releases such as \"God Hand\" in 2006 and \"MadWorld\" in 2009 were seen as parodies of violence in popular culture, earning both games praise for not taking themselves as seriously as early beat 'em up games. Classic beat 'em ups have been re-released on services such as the Virtual Console; critics reaffirmed the appeal of some, while the appeal of others has been deemed to have diminished with time. Although the genre lacks the same presence it did in the late 1980s, some titles such as \"Viewtiful Joe\" and \"God Hand\" kept the genre alive.\n\nAfter 2000, the beat 'em up genre has seen a revival in the form of popular 3D hack and slash games in the style of \"Devil May Cry\" (2001 onwards), including \"Ninja Gaiden\" (2004 onwards), \"God of War\" (2005 onwards), \"Heavenly Sword\" (2007), \"Afro Samurai\" (2009), and \"Bayonetta\" (2009). Several traditional 2D scrolling beat 'em ups have also been released in recent years, including \"\" (2010). The popular \"Grand Theft Auto\" series also has elements of the beat 'em up genre.. \"Saints Row IV\" (2013) featured a parody of \"Streets Of Rage\" entitled \"Saints Of Rage\", where the player rescues Johnny Gat from a virtual prison.\n\n\n"}

Its most dominant constructions are a 324-metre guyed radio mast and two 210 metre guyed steel tube masts.\n\nThe 324 metre high mast is a grounded construction with triangular cross section. Until the early 1990s it had a highly effective fading-reducing transmitting antenna in the form of a special cage aerial developed in Russia, known as the ARRT-antenna. It was used for the 1000 kW-medium wave transmitter operated on 783 kHz, which was the strongest transmitter of the former GDR, as transmitting antenna. Today this mast has a cage aerial for long wave. Both the 210 metre high tube masts are isolated from the ground. One of the two tube masts can be used as a toe-fed mast antenna for long and medium wave, while the other mast can be used only as a transmitting antenna for the medium-wave band.\n\nAs further antenna systems there are still three step-radiating antennas, each of which is supported by two free standing steel framework towers and which served as transmitting antenna for a medium-wave transmitter on the frequency 1575 kHz (shut down at present) and a triangle plane aerial for medium wave.\n\nFrom 1967 to 1976 there was also another 350 metre high radio mast for long wave, the steel tube lattice mast SL3, which was used for transmitting the program of Radio Wolga. In order not to affect the radiation field of the other masts, this radio mast was placed at a distance of 2.2 kilometres from the other masts near the road from Burg to Grabow, in the neighbourhood of Gütter, part of Burg. It collapsed on February 18, 1976, because of a defective bolt and was not rebuilt. As a replacement, one of the two 210 metre high steel tube masts was converted in such a way that it could also broadcast the program of Radio Wolga (and later also of Radioropa Info) in the long-wave range. There are still some remains of the basements of the radio mast SL3 today.\n\nIn the 1960s some propaganda transmitters, as German military transmitters, were operated on the site of the AM transmitter Burg.\n\n\n"}

It was the fifth \"Captain America\" series with this title to be published, following series that ran from 1968–1996, 1996–1997, 1998–2002, and 2002-2004. After its fiftieth issue (July 2009), the series was renumbered to match the numbering of all the volumes of the title (454, 13, 50, 32, and 50), and volume 1 resumed publication with issue #600 with Brubaker remaining as writer.\n\nThe series was best known for reviving Captain America's World War II partner Bucky Barnes as the Winter Soldier in issue #6, the presumed death of Steve Rogers in issue #25, and Bucky taking over the mantle of Captain America in issue #34.\n\n\nIn addition to the regular series, two one shot issues written by Ed Brubaker were published in coordination with ongoing stories.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He usually portrayed elderly folksy-type characters in a rustic setting, in all appearing in over 100 films. He was the oldest cast member of The Wizard of Oz.\n\nBorn in Xenia, Ohio, Charles Ellsworth Grapewin ran away from home to be a circus acrobat which led him to work as an aerialist and trapeze artist in a traveling circus before turning to acting. He traveled all over the world with the famous P. T. Barnum circus. Grapewin also appeared in the original 1903 Broadway production of \"The Wizard of Oz\", 36 years before he would appear in the famous Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film version.\n\nAfter this he continued in theatre, on and offstage, for the next thirty years, starting with various stock companies, and wrote stage plays as a vehicle for himself. His sole Broadway theatre credit was the short-lived play \"It's Up to You John Henry\" in 1905.\n\nGrapewin married actress Anna Chance (1875–1943) in 1896, and they remained a devoted couple until her death some 47 years later. Two years after his first wife's death, Grapewin married Loretta McGowan Becker on Jan 10, 1945.\n\nGrapewin began in silent films at the turn of the twentieth century. His very first films were two \"moving image shorts\" made by Frederick S. Armitage and released in November 1900; \"Chimmie Hicks at the Races\" (also known as \"Above the Limit\") and \"Chimmie Hicks and the Rum Omelet\", both shot in September and October 1900 and released in November of that year. During his long career, Grapewin appeared in more than one hundred films, including \"The Good Earth\", \"The Grapes of Wrath\", \"Tobacco Road\", and in what is probably his best-remembered role: Uncle Henry in \"The Wizard of Oz\". He also had a recurring role as Inspector Queen in the Ellery Queen film series of the early 1940s.\n\nGrapewin died of natural causes in Corona, California at age 86, and his ashes are interred with his wife's in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California, at the Great Mausoleum's Columbarium of Inspiration.\n\nPrior to \"The Wizard of Oz\", Grapewin appeared in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's \"Broadway Melody of 1938\" with Judy Garland (Oz's Dorothy) and Buddy Ebsen (Oz's original Tin Man). He also appeared with Garland in \"Listen, Darling.\"\n\n"}

The first artist he contracted was his friend Tom Mix. In 1923 Arnold changed the name of the circus to \"Renz\". During World War II it was difficult for the circus to survive, and because of the circumstances it was forced to give shows for Nazi Germany. After the war, the circus returned to normal shows. Arnold van der Vegt died in 1955. (Arnold van der Vegt is not related to Ernst Jacob Renz, Berlin 1842 or Renz International).\nAfter the death of Arnold van der Vegt, his son Herman Sr. took over management of the circus. In 1970 he transferred the running of the circus to his sons, Paul and Arnold Jr. (also known as Nol). Paul acted as a clown in the shows and Arnold Jr. became the director.\n\nArnold Jr. and his wife Marina made the circus successful. For many years they traveled around with success. In 1967 their son Herman Jr. was born. As a child, Herman's ambition was to continue his fathers circus business.\n\nThe success of circus Renz reached its peak in 1978 when Bassie and Adriaan made several television series with Circus Renz as the backdrop. In the weekends, they made their appearance in the circus with clown performances. During this period the shows were regularly sold out.\n\nIn 1980 the Dutch TV-producer Joop van den Ende established Circus Bassie & Adriaan. The staff of Circus Renz was involved with the entire transport of Circus Bassie & Adriaan. Circus Renz itself traveled throughout the country. At the end of 1983 Joop van den Ende ended his work with the circus, after he did a show with the Dutch singer André Hazes.\n\nAt Circus Renz, the Steijvers family started a new act, followed by the new act of the Luycx-Sisters in 1983. Herman Jr. fell in love with Diana Luycx and they started a relationship.\n\nArnold Jr. again worked with Bassie and Adriaan in 1985. The cooperation between them was renewed and the circus Renz grew. But, in 1988, Arnold Jr. became very ill. His last wish was to travel once more with Bassie and Adriaan and a complete new circus-tent. The new tent was bought, but in January 1989 Arnold van der Vegt Jr. died of cancer. Because the new tour was already planned, Bassie and Adriaan finished the tour after which, in 1989, the tent was sold.\n\nIn 1990 Herman Jr., and his girlfriend Diana, perform for one season with the French circus Achille Zavatta II. Despite this, Herman wanted to continue the Circus Renz with Diana, and the families of Steijvers and Ronday.\n\nIn September 1990 Diana & Herman Renz ended a contract with the Circus Achille Zavatta II. On March the 13th 1991 they open with the renewed 'Dutch National Circus Herman Renz'. The first show on the tour was in Eemnes. For the young board of directors it is a big venture, but thanks to a contract with Center Parcs it turned into a large success.\n\nIn five years time, the now-married Diana & Herman Renz develop the circus into the largest in the Netherlands and later the Benelux. The circus always wintered the show in the Dutch city of Haarlem. In December 1995 Diana & Herman Renz received the Oscar Carré Trophy. The trophy is awarded by the Swiss circus director Frédy Knie of Circus Knie.\n\nThe tour of 1996 started at February 22 in the Dutch city of Hilversum. A new tent has ordered and there was a new contract with Center Parcs for the show.\n\nMarch 13, 1996. On Centerparc 'Het Vennenbos', the circus had arrived in the Dutch city of Hapert for a show. Herman & Diana had not shown been seen yet that day. Worried manager Robert Ronday, looking for them and found Herman & Diana dead. It was later determined that Diana & Herman died because of carbon monoxide poisoning. The shows and the tour were temporarily cancelled. Some days later, the Circus is relocated to the Dutch city of Haarlem, where the funeral took take place. After the funeral ceremony, the funeral proceeded to Amsterdam, where Diana & Herman were buried at the cemetery 'Zorgvlied'.\n\nA week after the burial the Herman's mother announces that she wants to sell the circus for 800,000 Dutch guilders. Many want to save the circus. Nine years old Ronald Blom generated a lot of publicity. Ronald was seen on television shows such as the \", \" and 'Het Jeugdjournaal' (the news for youth). There is even a story in the local newspaper of Haarlem ('Haarlems Dagblad'). Ronald also collects money (in total 1,012 guilders). Ed Glas organized actions to save the circus also, together with the interim executive board of the circus, Toin Routers (public relations officer of the circus in 2005) and Hans de Jager, a fan club was set up. Individuals and companies could rent a chair in the Circus as sponsors. , a company located in the Dutch city of Breda owned by , sponsors the circus until 1998. \nToday the circus is owned by the families Steijvers, Ronday and Olivier. The executive board consists of five people.\nCircus Herman Renz went bankrupt in October 2015, after the Duursma Group took over the Circus. Duursma Group restarted the Circus Herman Renz with a new series of performances at the Maashorst Fair in Schaijk.\n\nOn December 22, 2002 circus Herman Renz received royal recognition. Mayor (mayor of the Dutch city of Haarlem) had the honour of presenting the award. Circus Herman Renz was the first Dutch circus to receive this award, which motivated the employees of Circus Herman Renz to preserve the last great Dutch circus.\n\nDuring December and January, Circus Herman Renz presented its famous 'Wintershow'. During this period, visitors voted for their favorite artists. The winner received the 'Haarlemse Publieksprijs' (The Harlem Audience Award).\n\n"}

Later the circus was run by his daughter Frieda Sembach-Krone and her husband Carl Sembach-Krone. From 1995 until 2017 their daughter Christel Sembach-Krone ran the circus.\n\nSince 1919, the circus has also owned the Circus Krone Building in Munich. On December 12, 1944, the building was destroyed by bombing attacks. In 1950 it was rebuilt as a circus building with a seating capacity of 3,000 spectators.\nIn a century, the Circus Krone Imperium became a world-wide recognized institution within the circus world. The outstanding success is based on the maxim \"entrepreneur spirit, love of animals\nand absolute seriousness\". This maxim has been maintained throughout the illustrious history of the family owned and operated Circus Krone.\n\nCarl Krone died in 1943. He did not experience the total destruction of the Circus Krone Building, a destruction caused by aerial bombardment. Humans and animals were evacuated to the Krone Stud Farm in Wessling.\n\nChristel Sembach-Krone directed the fate of the family owned and operated Circus Krone after the death of her father (Carl Sembach, died on January 18, 1984) and her mother (Frieda Sembach-Krone, died on November 2, 1995).\n\nChristel Sembach-Krone, who remained unmarried and had an adoptive daughter named Jana Mandana Lacey-Krone, died on June 20, 2017, after a short illness. \n\nLacey-Krone, who is married to Martin Lacey, Jr. and has one son, will become the new director.\n\nCircus Krone has a circus tent with 5,000 seats with a diameter of 48 by 64 metres and a dome height of 14 metres. It covers an overall area of approximately 2,000 square metres.The largest, most modern and most expensive circus tent of the present can only be described. \nThe construction of the enormous tent allows for the seating of 5.000 spectators. Four 20\nmeters long steel masts, four steel lattice auxiliary masts, 120 storm and cross beams as\nwell as 250 iron anchors provide necessary security, even during the most violent of storms.\nIn less than one day, the gigantic tent construction \"stands\" with seats, manège, show stage,\nlight and sound controls - ready for performances, officially approved and in top condition.\nWithin the area of the illumination engineering with Krone, standards have been established.\nApproximately 140 securely installed headlights, as well as eight \"golden scans\" ensure for\nthe different lighting effects of the individual numbers. Four \"searchlights\" place artists and\nanimals into the right light.The total area of the tent approximately equates to the area of a football field.\n\nAnimals used at the circus include lions, Asian and African elephants, a hippopotamus, a rhinoceros, horses, monkeys, pigs, porcupines, goats, zebras and parrots.\n\n"}
{"id": "26973311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26973311", "title": "Dave Stamper", "text": "Dave Stamper\n\nDave Stamper (November 10, 1883September 18, 1963) was an American songwriter of the Tin Pan Alley and vaudeville eras, a contributor to twenty-one editions of the Ziegfeld Follies, writer for the Fox Film Corporation, and composer of more than one thousand songs, in spite of never learning to read or write traditional music notation. He may have written \"Shine On Harvest Moon\", a claim supported by vaudeville performer and writer Eddie Cantor. He was also a charter member of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers or ASCAP.\n\nStamper was born in New York City on November 10, 1883, and took up piano at age ten. At seventeen, he left school and became a pianist at a Coney Island dance hall for two years before becoming a \"song-plugger\" for publisher F. A. Mills. Stamper was twenty when he met singer Nora Bayes and her husband Jack Norworth becoming her accompanist and touring widely for the next four years. After Stamper left Bayes' employment, he resumed working as a song-plugger and vaudeville pianist. In 1910 he met Gene Buck, an artist who painted cover images for sheet music. The two started collaborating, with Buck providing lyrics for Stamper's melodies. Their first published songs were \"In the Cool of the Evening,\" \"Daddy Has a Sweetheart (and Mother Is Her Name)\" and \"Some Boy\".\n\nStamper's first marriage to Gertrude Springer ended in divorce after the birth of two children, Maurice and Regina Stamper. On 16 July 1926 he married \"vaudeville and revue comedienne\" Edna Leedom who had performed in the Follies of 1923, 1924 and 1925. The marriage ended within two years. On 16 August. 1928 he married Agnes White, a \"Follies\" performer who was in Stamper and Buck's musical \"Take The Air\" (1927). The couple were married for 40 years and produced one daughter, Susan Stamper, a dancer. One of their grandchildren is singer/songwriter Happy Rhodes.\n\nStamper did not learn to read or write traditional musical notation, creating his own numerical notation.\n\nIn 1912 Stamper began writing songs for the Ziegfeld \"Follies of 1913\", contributing \"Just You and I and The Moon\", \"Without You\" and \"Everybody Sometime Must Love Somebody\". He is credited as \"additional music\" for the \"Follies of 1914\" and 1915, but he wrote the majority of the music for the \"Follies of 1916\". and was on an equal billing with Louis A. Hirsch, Jerome Kern, and Irving Berlin. The music of the \"Follies of 1917\" was written by Stamper and Raymond Hubbell and he was described as \"an old hand\" for his work with Louis A. Hirsch by the Follies of 1918. In addition to his 1918 \"Follies\" work, he wrote all the music for \"Ziegfeld Midnight Frolic\" with Gene Buck, a series that also had editions in 1919, 1920 and 1921.\n\nThe \"Follies of 1919\" found Stamper branching out into writing lyrics as well as writing comic sketches. 1919 was a very busy year, with Stamper writing songs for the \"Follies\" as well as the \"Midnight Frolic\" and the \"Ziegfeld Nine O'Clock Review\" both of which appeared in a theater on the roof of the New Amsterdam theater.\n\nStamper continued as principal songwriter for the Follies of 1920 through 1925, with an additional summer edition in 1923. He returned for the Follies of 1931, the last edition produced by Florenz Ziegfeld himself.\n\nWhile his work with Ziegfeld encompassed the majority of his working life, Stamper and Gene Buck worked for other producers as well. He had songs in two plays - \"When Claudia Smiles\" (1914) and \"Broadway and Buttermilk\" (1916) prior to traveling to London with Buck to write songs for \"Zig Zag!\" which ran for 648 performances at the London Hippodrome. Stamper returned to London in 1918 to write songs for another review \"Box O' Tricks\" with Frederick Chapelle, which ran for 625 performances. During his first trip to London, Buck befriended a man who turned out to be a German spy. Two results of this event were fellow passenger Eddie Rickenbacker deciding to enlist to fly, and Dave Stamper having to prove to British police and a Judge that his pages covered with numbers were sheet music rather than a code.\n\nStamper was fully occupied with work for Ziegfeld until 1927, when Gene Buck hired Stamper to write the music for \"Take The Air\" (1927). He also worked for the Schubert organization on \"Lovely Lady\" (1927) before returning to Ziegfeld for the 1931 Follies.\n\nHe finished out his work on Broadway with \"Provincetown Follies\" (1935) which only ran for 63 performances and \"Orchids Preferred\" (1937) which closed in a week.\n\nIn 1928, Stamper was signed by Fox Film Corporation as a staff composer, remaining there until 1930. He contributed \"Dance Away the Night\" and \"Peasant Love Song\" to the film \"Married in Hollywood\" (1929) often called the first filmed operetta. The film \"Words and Music\" (1929) featured \"The Hunting Song\", \"Take a Little Tip\" and \"Too Wonderful for Words\" all written with lyricist Harlan Thompson. In 1930, he contributed \"Only One\" and \"The Gay Heart\" written with Clare Kummer and \"Once In A While\" written with Clare Kummer and Cecil Arnold\n\nStamper claimed to have written \"Shine On, Harvest Moon\", while the writers of record were his former employers Nora Bayes and Jack Norworth. Stamper's claim was supported by vaudeville comic Eddie Cantor in his 1934 book \"Ziegfeld, The Great Glorifier\" and David Ewen's \"All the Years of American Popular Music\".\n\nStamper was working as a pianist rather than as a songwriter at the time the song appeared but never learned how to read or write using traditional music notation thus he would have not been able submit the song for copyright, or produce sheet music to prove his claim. Bayes and Norworth compelled Stamper at one point to wear stage make-up to appear Japanese, apparently to keep him from being interviewed by reporters.\n\nStamper's caricature was on the wall at Sardi's restaurant.\n\nStamper and Buck's song \"The Shakespearian Rag\" appears in T. S. Eliot's \"The Waste Land\":\n\nRing Lardner and George S. Kaufman mentioned Stamper in their play \"June Moon\":\n\nJohn Hyams played Stamper in the 1936 film \"The Great Ziegfeld\" starring William Powell, which won the Academy Award for Best Motion Picture. His songwriting partner Gene Buck was played by William Demarest, best known as \"Uncle Charley\" on the TV show \"My Three Sons\".\n\n"}

{"id": "828094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=828094", "title": "Gamebook", "text": "Gamebook\n\nA gamebook is a work of printed fiction that allows the reader to participate in the story by making choices. The narrative branches along various paths, typically through the use of numbered paragraphs or pages. Gamebooks are sometimes called choose your own adventure books or CYOA after the influential Choose Your Own Adventure series originally published by US company Bantam Books. Gamebooks influenced hypertext fiction.\n\nProduction of new gamebooks in the West decreased dramatically during the nineties as choice based stories have moved away from print based media, although the format may be getting a new lease of life on mobile and ebook platforms. Such digital gamebooks are considered interactive fiction.\n\nGamebooks can be grouped into three families. \n\nIn all gamebooks, the story is presented as a series of sections of printed text. Branching-plot novel sections often run to several pages in length, whereas solitaire and adventure gamebook sections are usually no longer than a paragraph or two. At the end of a text section, the reader is usually given a choice of narrative branches that they may follow. Each branch contains a reference to the number of the paragraph or page that should be read next if that branch is chosen (e.g. to go north turn to section 98). The story continues this way until a paragraph or page which ends that branch of the story. In most solitaire or adventure gamebooks, there is usually one \"successful\" ending, and the remainder are \"failures.\" Branching plot novels, on the other hand, tend to be more concerned with narrative resolution rather than winning or losing, thus often have several endings which may be deemed \"successful\".\n\nGamebooks are typically written in the second person with the reader assuming the role of a character to experience the world from that character's point of view (e.g. 'you walk into the cold and dark forest').\n\nMany titles are usually published in series containing several books, although individual gamebooks have also been published. While the books in many series are stand-alone narratives, others continue the narrative from the previous books in the series.\n\nSeveral influences contributed to the development of the gamebook format during the twentieth century. An early example of the form is \"Consider the Consequences!\" by Doris Webster and Mary Alden Hopkins, published in the United States in 1930. The 1936 play Night of January 16th by Ayn Rand also allowed the reader to influence the ending. The play is designed so that members of the audience get to choose whether a defendant is guilty or not; the audience's decision determines which of two possible endings is played out. The children's book \"Treasure Hunt\", published in 1945 in Britain under the name of \"Alan George\" (probably a pseudonym), is another early example of a story with multiple paths for the reader to follow.\n\nAlso quite early on, the possibility of having stories branching out into several different paths was suggested by Jorge Luis Borges in his short story \"An Examination of the Work of Herbert Quain\" (1941). This story features an author whose novel is a three-part story containing two branch points, and with nine possible endings. Another story by Borges, titled \"The Garden of Forking Paths\" (1941), also describes a book with a maze-like narrative, which may have inspired the gamebook form. \n\nProgrammed learning materials, first proposed by B.F. Skinner, have been recognized as an early influence on the development of branching path books. This learning method was first applied in the TutorText series of interactive textbooks, published from the late fifties up until the early seventies. These books present the reader with a series of problems related to a particular area of study, allowing him or her to choose among several possible answers. If the answer to a problem is correct, the reader moves on to the next problem. If the answer is incorrect, the reader is given feedback and is asked to pick a different answer. This educational technique would form a basis for many later narrative gamebook series .\n\nDuring the sixties, authors from several different countries started experimenting with fiction that contained multiple paths and/or endings. Some literary works in this vein include the French-language novel \"L'ironie du sort\" (1961) by Paul Guimard, the Spanish-language novels \"Hopscotch\" (1963) by Julio Cortazar and \"Juego de cartas\" (Card Game, 1964) by Max Aub, and the works of the French literary group known as the Oulipo (1967). Other early experiments include the short stories \"Alien Territory\" and \"The Lost Nose: a Programmed Adventure\" (both 1969) by John Sladek, the novel\" The French Lieutenant's Woman\" (1969) by John Fowles, and the collection of short stories titled \"Tante storie per giocare\" (Many Tales to Play With, 1971) by Italian author Gianni Rodari. \nTaken together, these influences may have contributed to the development of several pioneering gamebooks in the sixties and seventies. These include \"Lucky Les\" by E.W. Hildick (1967), \"State of Emergency\" by Dennis Guerrier and Joan Richards (1969), and the Swedish-language book \"Den mystiska påsen\" (The Mysterious Bag, 1970) by Betty Orr-Nilsson, among others. The first gamebook series proper appears to have been Tracker Books, published by Transworld in the UK between 1972 and 1980. This series includes adventures in a variety of genres such as science fiction, mystery, and sports. Meanwhile, in the US, \"The Adventures of You\" series appeared in 1976-77, with two titles that would later become part of the groundbreaking Choose Your Own Adventure series: \"Sugarcane Island\" by Edward Packard and \"Journey Under the Sea\" by R. A. Montgomery.\n\nTabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons were another early influence that would contribute in major ways to the development of the gamebook form. The first module which combined a branching-path narrative with a set of role-playing game rules was \"Buffalo Castle\" for the Tunnels and Trolls system (1975). \"Buffalo Castle\" was innovative for its time, as it allowed the reader to experience a role-playing session without need for a referee. It has been followed by many other solitaire adventures for the T&T system, as well as solos for other tabletop role-playing games.\n\n\"The Adventures of You\" series, authored by Edward Packard and R.A. Montgomery and initially published by Vermont Crossroads Press, laid much of the groundwork for the later surge in popularity of the gamebook format. The series was born with \"Sugarcane Island\" by Edward Packard, which was written in 1969 but did not see publication until 1976. The series later included \"Journey Under the Sea\" by R. A. Montgomery (1977). After the series' end, two standalone gamebooks authored by Packard would follow, both published by Lippincott: \"Deadwood City\" (1978) and \"The Third Planet from Altair\" (1979). While these early efforts apparently achieved some popularity with readers, they (and the gamebook format in general) still did not have a publisher with the marketing strength required to make them available to mass audiences.\nPackard and Montgomery took the idea of publishing interactive books to Bantam, and thus the Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA) series was born in 1979, beginning with \"The Cave of Time\". The series became immensely popular worldwide and several titles were translated into more than 25 languages. The series reached the peak of its popularity with children in the eighties. It was during this period that Bantam released several other interactive series to capitalize on the popularity of the medium (a few examples are: Choose your Own Adventure for Younger Readers, Time Machine and Be An Interplanetary Spy). Many other American publishers released their own series to compete with CYOA. One of the most popular competitors seems to have been TSR, who released several branching-path novels based on their own role-playing games. The most famous TSR series was Endless Quest. Another strong competitor was Ballantine with their Find Your Fate series, which featured adventures in the Indiana Jones, James Bond and Doctor Who universes. Famous author R. L. Stine wrote several books for this line, including \"The Badlands of Hark\", as well as for other series such as Wizards, Warriors and You. Several Choose your Own Adventure spin-offs and many competing series were translated into other languages.\n\nBranching-path books also started to appear during the eighties in several other countries, including Spain, France, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Chile, and Denmark. In some other countries, publication both of translated series and of original books began in later years. For example, the first original books in Brazil and Italy seem to have appeared in the nineties. Translated editions of Choose your Own Adventure and other Western series only appeared in Eastern European countries after the fall of Communism.\n\nThis type of book was seen predominantly as a form of entertainment for children. Nonetheless, there were books with more didactic purposes (ranging from historical series such as the aforementioned Time Machine to books with religious themes such as the Making Choices series). Also, a few branching-path books were aimed at adults, ranging from business simulations to works of erotica.\n\nThe branching-path book commercial boom dwindled in the early nineties, and the number of new series diminished. However, new branching-path books continue to be published to this day in several countries and languages. Choose your Own Adventure went on to become the longest running gamebook series with 185 titles. The first run of the series ended in 1998.\n\nR. A. Montgomery started rereleasing some Choose Your Own Adventure titles in 2005. His company has also released some new titles. New books and series continue to be published in other countries to this day. Examples are the \"1000 Gefahren\" series in Germany and the \"Tú decides la aventura\" series in Spain.\n\nDespite the domination of works that have been translated from English in most non-English speaking countries, a sizable number of original gamebooks—both individual books and series—have been published in various countries; this is especially the case in France (e.g. the \"La Saga du Prêtre Jean\" series).\n\nIn the 1990s, the gamebook genre became highly popular in Bulgaria for approximately ten years. Whilst internationally well-known series such as Choose Your Own Adventure and Fighting Fantasy were translated for the Bulgarian market, the works of numerous Bulgarian gamebook authors were most popular with readers.\n\nDuring the popularity peak of gamebooks in Bulgaria, Bulgarian publishing houses believed that only Western authors would sell and, as a consequence, virtually all Bulgarian gamebook authors adopted English pseudonyms. This tradition persisted after their nationality was publicly disclosed. A smaller number of Hungarian authors also adopted Western pseudonyms, in addition to \"official titles\" that were also in English.\n\nSeveral adventure gamebooks have been released in the Czech Republic and Russia. In Azerbaijan, Narmin Kamal's novel, \"Open It's Me\", offers the reader a choice to either read the book as a random collection of thirty-nine short stories about the same character, or as a single novel. A photo of the book's hero is published on the final page and the author asks the reader questions about the character.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, about 90 gamebooks have been published in Poland, not only as printed books, but also as comics, e-books or mobile applications. The author of the largest number of titles (14) is Beniamin Muszyński. Polish gamebooks are also regularly written and self-published by their fans.\n\nWhile most gamebooks have traditionally being aimed at young audiences, there have been several attempts to write adult-oriented branching path stories. Barring the aforementioned works of Dennis Guerrier in the sixties, one of the earliest examples of the form is the five-volume \"Barcelona, Maxima Discrecion\" series, which adapted the noir fiction genre to an interactive form. Published in the eighties, this series was only available in Catalan and Spanish.\n\nHeather McElhatton published a bestselling gamebook for adults in 2007, called \"Pretty Little Mistakes: A Do-Over Novel\". It was followed by a sequel titled \"Million Little Mistakes\" published in 2010.\n\nSome contemporary literary novels have used the gamebook format, including Kim Newman's \"Life's Lottery\" (1999) and Nicholas Bourbaki's \"If\" (2014).\n\nIn 2011, McGraw-Hill Education began releasing adaptations of the original Choose Your Own Adventure titles as graded readers. The stories were retold in simplified language and re-organized plotlines, in order to make them easier for English as a second or foreign language readers to play. The choice format of gamebooks has proved to be popular with ESL teachers as a way to motivate reluctant students, target critical thinking skills, and organize classroom activities.\n\nVarious erotic gamebooks have been published by major publishers. In 1994 \"Derrière la porte\" by Alina Reyes was published by Pocket Books France and Éditions Robert Laffont, and later translated into English for Grove Press and Weidenfeld & Nicolson (as \"Behind Closed Doors\") and into Italian for Ugo Guanda Editore (as \"Dietro le porte\"). Melcher Media in 2003 packaged two \"Choose-Your-Own-Erotic-Adventure\" books for Penguin Books' Gotham Books imprint, including \"Kathryn in the City\" by Mary Anne Mohanraj, a well-known writer of erotica.\n\nSolitaire adventures were a parallel development. This type of book is intended to allow a single person to use the rules of a role-playing game to experience an adventure without need of a referee. The first role-playing game solitaire adventures to be published were those using the \"Tunnels and Trolls\" system, beginning with the book \"Buffalo Castle\" in 1976, making \"Tunnels and Trolls\" the first role-playing game to support solitaire play. Flying Buffalo released 24 solo adventure books (plus several pocket size adventures) in the period 1976–1993. A number of the adventures are still in print today. They were very successful among players of role-playing games and inspired many imitators.\n\nAnother early role-playing game with solitaire modules made for it was \"The Fantasy Trip\". The first such module was Death Test, published in 1978. Eight adventures were released in total. One thing that set them apart was the need for miniatures and a hexmap, in order to take advantage of the combat and movement systems. These adventures were also very popular and influential.\n\nMeanwhile, several third-party publishers started to publish solitaire adventures meant for use with popular roleplaying systems. Some of the earliest adventures in this vein were The Solo Dungeon (1978) by British author Richard Bartle, and Survival of the Fittest (1979), published by Judges' Guild in the United States. Both of these adventures were meant to be used with Dungeons and Dragons rules.\n\nSolitaire role-playing adventures also experienced a boom in the eighties. Many role-playing rulesets included solo adventures which were intended to teach the rules systems to the players. Some companies released lines of solitaire adventures for their own games. Examples of games with prolific solitaire lines were Dungeons & Dragons, GURPS, Das Schwarze Auge, DC Heroes, and Call of Cthulhu. Some third-party publishers continued to release solo adventures for established RPG systems (including Judges' Guild, who released solos for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons). Solitaire adventures were also featured quite frequently in professional RPG magazines and fanzines. Several solo adventures (such as those for Tunnels & Trolls, Dungeons & Dragons, and Das Schwarze Auge) were translated into other languages.\n\nAs was the case with other types of gamebooks, the production of solitaire RPG adventures decreased dramatically during the nineties. However, new solos continue to be published to this day. Some companies continue to produce solo adventures for Tunnels & Trolls. There are also new solo adventures for a variety of systems, and even some influenced by the Fantasy Trip solos (such as the ones by Dark City Games). The Internet has provided a channel to distribute solitaire adventures, with both free and commercial adventures made available as electronic documents.\n\nAdventure gamebooks incorporate elements from Choose Your Own Adventure books and role-playing solitaire adventures. The books involve a branching path format in order to move between sections of text, but the reader creates a character as in a role-playing game, and resolves actions using a game-system. Unlike role-playing solitaire adventures, adventure gamebooks include all the rules needed for play in each book. Adventure gamebooks are usually not divided into numbered pages, but rather into numbered sections of text, so that several sections may fit in a single page, or a single section can span several pages.\n\n\"The Warlock of Firetop Mountain\" was published in 1982, the first of what became the Fighting Fantasy series of gamebooks, one of the first adventure gamebook series. With over 60 titles, including a variety of spin-offs, the series popularised the gamebook format in the UK and many other countries, such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Singapore, the United States, Portugal, Tanzania, Brazil, Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Denmark, Israel, Japan, and after the fall of communism, Eastern Europe. \n\nAdventure gamebooks experienced a publishing boom in the eighties, most notably in the United Kingdom, the United States, Italy and France. British series such as \"Fighting Fantasy\", \"Lone Wolf\", and \"The Way of the Tiger\" were translated into several languages and became very popular worldwide. The boom decreased considerably in the nineties, with Fabled Lands being the last major British gamebook series. In the 2000s, reissues of the \"Fighting Fantasy\" and \"Lone Wolf\" series emerged, and garnered some commercial success.\n\nSeveral authors in different countries continue to publish adventure gamebooks in the late 2010s. Notable examples are German fantasy authors Wolfgang Hohlbein and Markus Heitz, and British author Jonathan Green.\n\n\n"}

The lyrics were written by the physician and journalist Vicente Salias in 1810. The music was later composed by musician Juan José Landaeta. It is said, however, that the melody has been known since 1840 as \"La Marsellesa Venezolana\" (\"Venezuelan Marseillaise\"), in reference to its subtle similarity to the French national anthem.\n\nSome recent investigations have suggested that the real author of the anthem was Andrés Bello, and not Salias, to whom it was originally credited, and the music was composed by another musician called Lino Gallardo. However, this theory has yet to be proven, and lacks any real recognition among the general Venezuelan population, historians, or otherwise.\n\nThe Venezuelan national anthem is played every day on radio and television broadcasts at 12:00 am, 6:00 am and 12:00 pm (either the full version or the chorus, first stanza and chorus) on all national TV networks. On radio broadcasts, the state anthem is played after the national anthem, which is also the case in state TV stations. \n\nIn most occasions, only the chorus, first stanza and the chorus are played or even the chorus itself. Sometimes the chorus is played twice in the beginning, and once in the rest of the anthem. In formal events (if the anthem will be played by either a military band, concert band or orchestra) the format is: Chorus (2x), First verse and Chorus (2x), with the optional introduction. If played in full the chorus is sung twice, with or without the introductory notes.\n\n"}
{"id": "3432354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3432354", "title": "Golden Fleece Award", "text": "Golden Fleece Award\n\nThe Golden Fleece Award (1975–1988) was a tongue-in-cheek award given to public officials in the United States for their squandering of public money, its name sardonically purloined from the actual Order of the Golden Fleece, a prestigious chivalric award created in the late-15th Century, and a play on the transitive verb \"fleece\", as in charging excessively for goods or services. United States Senator William Proxmire, a Democrat from Wisconsin, began to issue the Golden Fleece Award in 1975 in monthly press releases. \"The Washington Post\" once referred to the award as \"the most successful public relations device in politics today.\" Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, referred to the award as being \"as much a part of the Senate as quorum calls and filibusters.\"\n\nWilliam Proxmire, a United States Senator who represented the Democratic Party from Wisconsin, issued the award monthly from 1975 until 1988, his Senate retirement. In total, he issued 168 Golden Fleece Awards. Though some members of the United States House of Representatives asked Proxmire's permission to continue the award, he declined, saying he might continue to issue them as a private citizen. Other organizations patterned their own \"Golden Fleece Awards\" after Proxmire's. The Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan federal budget watchdog organization, gave Proxmire their lifetime achievement award in 1999, and revived the Golden Fleece Award in 2000. Proxmire served as an honorary chairman of the organization.\n\nOne winner of the Golden Fleece Award, behavioral scientist Ronald Hutchinson, sued Proxmire for libel, requesting $8 million in damages, in 1976. Proxmire claimed that his statements about Hutchinson's research were protected by the Speech or Debate Clause of the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled, in \"Hutchinson v. Proxmire\", that the protection of speech and debate of lawmakers in the Constitution did not shield Proxmire from liability for defamatory statements made outside of formal congressional proceedings. The case was later settled out of court. Proxmire continued to present the award following the suit.\n\nIn his 2014 book \"Creativity, Inc.\", Pixar President Ed Catmull spoke of the \"chilling effect on research\" The Golden Fleece Award exerts. He argues that when you fund thousands of research projects, some have measurable, positive impacts and that others don't. It is not possible to predict what the results of every research project would be or whether they would have value. He further argues that failure in research is essential and that fear of failure would distort the way researchers choose projects, which would ultimately impede progress.\n\nWinners of the Golden Fleece Award included governmental organizations like the United States Department of Defense, Bureau of Land Management, and National Park Service; research projects have been particularly well represented. The National Science Foundation (NSF) won the first Golden Fleece Award for spending $84,000 on a study on love. Proxmire reasoned that:\nThe Federal Aviation Administration was named for spending $57,800 on a study of the physical measurements of 432 airline stewardesses, that included the \"distance from knee to knee while sitting\", and \"the politeal [sic] length of the buttocks.\"\n\nHe also gave the award to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for their Search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) program, supporting the scientific search for extraterrestrial civilizations. Proxmire later withdrew his opposition to the SETI program.\n\nIt is widely believed he gave the award to a study of the sex life of the screwworm fly, the results of which led scientists to create sterile screwworms that were released into the wild and eliminated this major cattle parasite from North and Central America, and reduced the cost of beef and dairy products across the globe. However, there is no evidence for this claim in the archives of the Award held by the Wisconsin Historical Society. Furthermore, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)-funded research on the sex life of the screwworm fly took place in the 1930s through 1950s, long before the Golden Fleece era of the 1970s and 80s, when Proxmire largely targeted contemporary research. The erroneous claim seems to stem from a speech by a former Director of the National Science Foundation, who stated that Proxmire gave the award to an NSF grant entitled, \"The Sexual Behavior of the Screwworm Fly,\" and later \"freely admitted that the study of the sex life of the screwworm fly had been of major significance to progress in this important field.\"\n\nOther award winners included:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55707554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55707554", "title": "Gunungan (wayang)", "text": "Gunungan (wayang)\n\nThe gunungan (Javanese \"mountain\", \"savory\"), also known as kayon or kayonan (from \"kayu\", \"wood\" or \"tree\") in Bali, is a figure in the Indonesian theatrical performance of wayang e.g. wayang kulit, wayang klitik, and wayang golek. A gunungan is a symmetrical-shaped figure of translucent parchment made of dried, firm beef skin, whose outline is pointed in Java and more rounded in Bali. In a wayang performance, the gunungan is the first to appear on the screen and the last to appear before the end. Gunungan also marks transition between different screen and can also serve as a prop. A gunungan symbolizes the world-mountain (called the Meru). Gunungan also appears in the visual art, e.g. the painted scrolls of wayang beber, in crafts or as architectural elements.\n\nA gunungan is generally symmetrical, shaped like a mountain or like rounded ellipse in the case of Balinese kayonan. The Javanese gunungan takes the form of a mountain (which looks almost Candi-like). A covered entrance gate generally appears at the center of a Javanese gunungan. The head of Kala, a monstrous personification of time, appears on top of the entrance gate. Beyond the entrance gate, a tree grows upward along the central axis, its branches spread across and fills up the gunungan with fine foliage motifs. \n\nThere are variations in the depiction of objects within the gunungan. Sometimes animals are depicted within the branches of the trees e.g. a tiger and a banteng (Javanese wild cattle) in fighting stance, monkeys or birds. In the case of Balinese kayonan, animals are seldom depicted; instead mythical figures e.g. garuda, naga, or underworld spirits yaksha are depicted to represent the three-world division concept of Balinese Hinduism. The tree behind would represent the bridge between these three worlds. Other monstrous figure that may appear in the Balinese kayonan is the \"karang bintulu\", a one-eyed monstrous head. The overall composition is generally is kept symmetrical, however sometimes there are some exceptions especially in the Balinese and Lombok gunungan where the shape can be assymmetrical.\n\nIn Balinese wayang kulit performance, only the kayonan can show a frontal representation of a figure. The frontal representation of figures in a kayonan are reserved for the highest deity. One example is Ganesha depicted in a Balinese kayonan.\n\nIn a wayang performance, a gunungan normally marks the beginning, the end, and pauses between important scenic transitions. This is generally marked by placing the gunungan at the center of the screen. A gunungan may also serves as prop for background mountains, rock, obstacles, waves of a lake, or cloud. If turned to a red backside, the gunungan symbolizes fire or flames. If placed obliquely, the gunungan indicates a break. In the traditional performance of a wayang kulit, the dalang would follow the course of the time to indicate the timing of the performance, before midnight the gunungan is placed to the dalang's left side, while after midnight, the gunungan is placed on his right. In the island of Lombok where there are two gunungans, the gunungans are moved from the edge to the center to indicate change of scene.\n\nIn Jave, before a wayang kulit performance, the dalang first gives offering (\"sajen\") in the form of food to soothe the demons. After the foreplay of the gamelan, the dalang pray to the spirit world and sits in his place. The dalang's two assistants have already sits to his side with the puppets already arranged at the edges of the screen: benevolent figures e.g. the gods and heroes are seated on the right side of the dalang, while the demons sit on his left. The dalang then place the gunungan in the center of the screen and knocks the figure's crest five times, symbolically waking up the spirit of the puppets. Then he takes the gunungan, turns in three times on the screen, and puts it on the right edge of the gedebog (banana trunk base). After this ritual, the actual play can begin. The play finished after the last planting of the gunungan. \n\nIn the beginning of a Balinese wayang performance, especially those in the southern region of Bali, the dalang would give offerings while saying a sacred verse (mantra). Then he would hit the crate of the puppets three times while asking the Wind God Vayu to take a strong part in the performance. Then he lifts the lid of the crate and places it on the right side. He takes the kayonan from the crate and moves it slightly over the screen and sticks it in the middle. Next, the dalang attaches the great figure of Siwamurti (angry aspect of Shiva) on the right side (the healing side) and similar the great figure of Wisnumurti (angry aspect of Vishnu) on the left side (the incurable side). The character of the puppets, benevolent or malevolent, will be placed accordingly to either side of the kayonan with faces turned away from the kayonan. When the characters have shown their presence, they disappear from the screen and are piled on the sides. The remaining kayonan is performing an ever-faster dance to lure the gods and demons, so that they may take possession of the puppet figures. The dalang murmurs further mantras and finally positioned the kayonan on the right side. \n\nBefore starting the performance, the dalang places the figures on the lid of the crate and others are handed over to his two assistants. \n\nWhen the performance comes to an end, the kayonan reappears. If the dalang is also a priest (Dalang Mangku), he would use holy water (tirtha) to sprinkle holy water (tirtha) onto the puppet figures to purify them from evil influence. During the ritual, the dalang would place the figure of Cintya behind the kayonan, the supreme figure in Balinese Hinduism.\n\nAnother figure with similar shape to the kayonan is called \"api\" (\"fire\"). The api has the shape of tapered leaf with a frightening face in the lower part, from which symmetrical radiating lines go upwards. In Balinese wayang kulit performance, the opposite of the kayonan is probably the pohon kepuh (\"tree of hell\"). The pohon kepuh is an asymmetrical, misshapen, tree-like structure with a witch sitting in the summit. It serves as a prop of a graveyard with open graves, which, together with magical evil spirits and skulls, are recognizable next to the tree trunk. The pohon kepuh figure is found only in the south of Bali and is used to represent the mount of King Korawa from the Mahabharata.\n\nIn the predominantly Muslim island of Lombok, the wayang kulit of Sasak people, the inhabitant of Lombok Island, has its own narrative tradition. The story of the wayang Sasak centered on the chronicle of Hamzanama, which features the adventure of Amir Hamza, an uncle of the Prophet Muhammad. The chronicle of Hamzanama is known as Serat Menak Sasak in Lombok. The stories are musically accompanied by the gamelan wayang Sasak. The art of gamelan wayang Sasak flourished since the 16th-century, however the strict Islamic reform movement in the last decades of the 20th-century had pressurized the wayang Sasak and other traditional art.\n\nThe wayang kulit Sasak utilized two gunungans, which correspond approximately to the Balinese figure, but end up in a tip like in Java. The Sasak variation of the Gunungan depicts the world tree which consists of two juxtaposed snakes, whose rear ends protrude upwards and represent the starting points for the branches, while the heads below look symmetrically in an arc on either side. Sometimes heads of demons can be seen between the branches of the world tree. The two gunungan, which also occur in the wayang golek performance of the Serat Menak Sasak, are due to the Islamic conception that the world strictly falls into the world of the good guided by God and the world of evil guided by the Shaytan.\n\nThe dalang first puts the figures on the outermost edges of the screen in a row in the banana trunk following the Islamic beliefs: the believer to his right, the disbeliever to his left. Then on the left, the dalang places the first gunungan slightly oblique. In the middle of the screen he marks the start of the performance with a dwarf-like joker figure called \"Lurah Sabatan\", who wears an over-sized kris in his belt. A second joker figure is added shortly before both disappear. At this time, the dalang would place the second gunungan danced over the screen with two other figures hidden behind him. A dancing gunungan is always musically accompanied by a suling (bamboo flute). The dancing gunungan then comes to rest in the center of the screen, the two figures then become visible from the gunungan and give their names as Amir Hamza, the protagonist of the Serat Menak, and Putri Muninggar, his favorite wife. This group of three will remain on the screen for a while, until the noble couple disappear and the gunungan is planted to the right side of the dalang on the edge. The screen remains framed by both gunungan during the course of the performance.\n\nSometimes there is only one gunungan. The gamelan orchestra, consisting of the bamboo flute suling, the drum kendang, a gong and other metallophones, plays three times at the beginning the opening piece known as \"Rangsang\" (\"provocative\", \"exciting\"). After the opening piece, the dalang ignites the \"labakan\" (oil lamp). The oil lamp symbolically represents the sun, while the music represents the element of fire, air, and water. The dalang wakes up the puppet figures by lifting the lid of the crate. The first figure placed in the middle is the gunungan, then the figure of Amir Hamza (also called Jayengrana) and Muninggar are placed on both sides of the gunungan, almost like an image of Adam, Eve, and the World Tree. After the dalang finished spoking a few religious formula, he lets all three figures disappear into the air while the orchestra plays a piece known as \"Janggal\" (\"leave\"). This whole act symbolizes the divine act of World's Creation. After some general preliminary remarks, the dalang reintroduces the gunungan into the center of the screen and describes the subsequent play. \n\nWayang beber is a form of illustrated wayang drama which use illustrated scroll to tell a narrative story. The art was thought to be extinct in the 20th-century, only to be rediscovered in the 1960s in two Javanese villages of Gelaran and Gedompol. The scroll used in a wayang beber is more than two meters long and 70 centimeter high. The scroll is set on two vertically erected bars so that four scenes can be seen one by one for the viewers sitting on the ground. \n\nGunungan also appears in wayang beber. The gunungan is variously depicted: in the village of Gelaran, the gunungan appears more tree-like, while in the village of Gedompol, it is more stylized. The root of a gunungan tree is depicted with water-like pattern. Sometimes aerial root appears in a gunungan tree, providing additional support to the tree. The roofed porch of a candi entrance is usually framed by wings and is closed by a door. A gunungan can be obscured by other motifs or cut off from the outer edge. Leaves, flowers, and sometimes fruits can be seen in the gunungan. A demon head sometimes appear in the gunungan, mostly similar with the Bali style, which is with one eye (karang bintulu), and rarely with two eyes (Batara Kala).\n\n"}

It is the story of the Luxembourg-based satellite provider and the growth of European satellite TV, the history of recent developments of the European TV and media industry, and their context in the wider development of TV and space technology.\n\nThe story of \"High Above\" is of interest to anyone who watches TV. It covers a period that has seen the emergence of television as the dominant information and entertainment medium. The account shows how Astra was a main driver of European TV development, without which we would not have the necessary base ingredients to make the great leap forward into digital TV, HDTV, 3D television, and future revolutionary prospects for home entertainment.\n\nBut the story of satellite TV is more than a story of rockets and technology; it is the story of the birth of a whole array of new industries and the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs. \"High Above\" is also a reflection of politics, 20th Century history, the Cold War and the collapse of Communism, the creation of Europe, economic growth and wealth, big brands, the Internet age and of technological convergence.\n\nSpace journalist, Gerhard Kowalski described \"High Above\" as “not only a eulogy to the TV pioneer … also a fact-rich and fascinating history of satellite television in general” while consumer technology website Tech Radar said the book “delivers a fascinating reminder of television’s early days as well as the technology behind the development of satellite TV”.\n\nUsing a series of interviews with key figures from the European satellite TV industry, as well as straightforward story-telling, \"High Above\" tells the inside account of how the tiny country of Luxembourg produced the company that established and then led the DTH satellite industry in Europe. With the commercial, technical and regulatory hurdles to overcome, it was a rough ride, both for Astra and for the broadcasters that now dominate the industry (BSkyB, Canal Plus, Premiere - now Sky Deutschland, etc.) – and the whole tale is told, the defeats as well as the victories. \n\nThe book also chronicles the development of television itself and of satellites, with the early experiments and the story of rocketry from the first trials of Robert Goddard, through Wernher Von Braun’s V-2 to the US and Soviet space programmes, and the European Ariane launchers that have carried many of the Astra satellites into orbit.\n\n\"High Above\" explains the technology behind, and within, satellite television: why satellites are used for TV broadcasting, how the geostationary orbit makes it work, how the tiny signals are received and decoded by domestic equipment, and how digital TV gives a choice of thousands of channels to every home.\n\n\"High Above\" is edited by Chris Forrester and written by Chris Forrester with Geoff Bains, Julian Clover, Jörn Krieger, and Serge Siritzky.\n\nChris Forrester is a well known broadcasting journalist and industry consultant.

The origins of the genre can be traced back to the 1982 film \"Burst City\", before the genre was primarily defined by the 1989 film \"\".\n\nJapanese cyberpunk also refers to a subgenre of manga and anime works with cyberpunk themes. This subgenre began in 1982 with the debut of the manga series \"Akira\", with its 1988 anime film adaptation later popularizing the subgenre. \"Akira\" inspired a wave of Japanese cyberpunk works, including manga and anime series such as \"Ghost in the Shell\", \"Battle Angel Alita\", \"Cowboy Bebop\", and \"Serial Experiments Lain\". Cyberpunk anime and manga have been influential on global popular culture, inspiring numerous works in animation, comics, film, music, television and video games.\n\nJapanese Cyberpunk generally involves the characters, especially the protagonist, going through monstrous, incomprehensible metamorphoses in an industrial setting. Many of these films have scenes that fall into the experimental film genre; they often involve purely abstract or visual sequences that may or may not relate to the characters and plot. Recurring themes include: mutation, technology, dehumanization, repression and sexual deviance.\n\n\"Burst City\", since its release in 1982, has had a strong effect on the underground Japanese film scene. This starred Shigeru Izumiya, who would, four years later, go on to direct his own Cyberpunk film, \"Death Powder\", in 1986. \"The Phantom of Regular Size\" was \"\"'s precursor, a 1986 short by Shinya Tsukamoto.

In Japan, where cosplay is popular and not only teenagers display such fashion styles, cyberpunk has been accepted and its influence is widespread. William Gibson's \"Neuromancer,\" whose influence dominated the early cyberpunk movement, was also set in Chiba, one of Japan's largest industrial areas.\n\nCyberpunk anime and manga draw upon a futuristic vision which has elements in common with western science fiction and therefore have received wide international acceptance outside Japan. \"The conceptualization involved in cyberpunk is more of forging ahead, looking at the new global culture. It is a culture that does not exist right now, so the Japanese concept of a cyberpunk future, seems just as valid as a Western one, especially as Western cyberpunk often incorporates many Japanese elements.\" William Gibson is now a frequent visitor to Japan, and he came to see that many of his visions of Japan have become a reality:\nModern Japan simply was cyberpunk. The Japanese themselves knew it and delighted in it. I remember my first glimpse of Shibuya, when one of the young Tokyo journalists who had taken me there, his face drenched with the light of a thousand media-suns—all that towering, animated crawl of commercial information—said, \"You see? You see? It is \"Blade Runner\" town.\" And it was. It so evidently was.\n\n\n\"Akira\" (1982 manga) and its 1988 anime film adaptation have influenced numerous works in animation, comics, film, music, television and video games. \"Akira\" has been cited as a major influence on Hollywood films such as \"The Matrix\", \"Dark City\", \"Chronicle\", \"Looper\", \"Midnight Special\", and \"Inception\", television shows such as \"Stranger Things\", and video games such as Hideo Kojima's \"Snatcher\" and \"Metal Gear Solid\", Valve's \"Half-Life\" series and Dontnod Entertainment's \"Remember Me\". John Gaeta cited \"Akira\" as artistic inspiration for the bullet time effect in \"The Matrix\" films. \"Akira\" has also been credited with influencing the \"Star Wars\" franchise, including the prequel film trilogy and the \"Clone Wars\" film and television series. \"Akira\" has also influenced the work of musicians such as Kanye West, who paid homage to \"Akira\" in the \"Stronger\" music video, and Lupe Fiasco, whose album \"Tetsuo & Youth\" is named after Tetsuo Shima. The popular bike from the film, Kaneda's Motorbike, appears in \"Steven Spielberg\"'s film \"Ready Player One\", and CD Projekt's video game \"Cyberpunk 2077\". \"\" video game developer Eidos Montréal also paid homage to the film's poster.\n\n\"Ghost in the Shell\" (1989) influenced a number of prominent filmmakers. The Wachowskis, creators of \"The Matrix\" (1999) and its sequels, showed the 1995 anime film adaptation of \"Ghost in the Shell\" to producer Joel Silver, saying, \"We wanna do that for real.\" \"The Matrix\" series took several concepts from the film, including the Matrix digital rain, which was inspired by the opening credits of \"Ghost in the Shell\", and the way characters access the Matrix through holes in the back of their necks. Other parallels have been drawn to James Cameron's \"Avatar\", Steven Spielberg's \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\", and Jonathan Mostow's \"Surrogates\". \"Ghost in the Shell\" also influenced video games such as \"Deus Ex\" and the \"Metal Gear Solid\" series.\n\nThe original video animation \"Megazone 23\" (1985), with its concept of a simulated reality, has a number of similarities to \"The Matrix\", \"Dark City\", and \"Existenz\". \"Battle Angel Alita\" (1990) has had a notable influence on filmmaker James Cameron, who was planning to adapt it into a film since 2000. It was an influence on his TV series \"Dark Angel\", and he is the producer of the 2018 film adaptation \"\". Comic book artist André Lima Araújo cited cyberpunk manga and anime such as \"Akira\", \"Ghost in the Shell\", \"Evangelion\" and \"Cowboy Bebop\" as a major influence on his work, which includes Marvel comics such as \"Age of Ultron\", \"Avengers A.I.\", \"Spider-Verse\" and \"The Inhumans\".\n"}

The awards were originally known as the Society of West End Theatre Awards, but they were renamed in honour of the British actor Laurence Olivier in 1984.\n\nThe awards are given to individuals involved in West End productions and other leading non-commercial theatres based in London across a range of categories covering plays, musicals, dance, opera and affiliate theatre. A discretionary non-competitive Special Olivier Award is also given each year. The Olivier Awards are recognised internationally as the highest honour in British theatre, equivalent to the BAFTA Awards for film and television, and the BRIT Awards for music. The Olivier Awards are considered equivalent to Broadway's Tony Awards and France's Molière Award.\n\nSince its inception, the awards have been held at various venues and theatres across London, from 2012-2016 at the Royal Opera House, before moving to the Royal Albert Hall in 2017. Television coverage is broadcast in prime time on ITV, who acquired the rights from 2013 onwards with radio coverage by Magic Radio.\n\nThe awards were first established in 1976 by the Society of London Theatre as the Society of West End Awards and were designed by artist Tom Merrifield. In 1984, British actor Laurence Olivier gave his consent for the awards to be renamed in his honour and they became known as the Laurence Olivier Awards. The first awards ceremony was held in December 1976 at Café Royal.\n\nEach year, the Olivier Award winners are decided by a group of distinguished industry professionals, theatre luminaries and members of the public speciﬁcally chosen for their passion for London theatre.\n\nLively and intense debates are conducted by four panels – theatre, opera, dance and afﬁliates – each overseen by the Society of London Theatre (SOLT). The professional panellists are chosen for their knowledge in the selected ﬁeld and each panel is made up of various members including journalists, casting directors, arts administrators and publishers. Each person is chosen by the Chief Executive of SOLT following advice from the SOLT Awards Office and external advisors.\n\nFor Affiliates, Dance and Opera, panellists select the shows they consider most worthy of an Olivier Award (to create the nominations in the relevant categories) and vote on a winner at the end of the judging period.\n\nFor the Theatre awards, the process happens in two stages. Firstly, a long list is compiled by the Theatre panel, which indicates productions or individuals in a category which the panel deem worthy of particular attention. This long list is then submitted to SOLT members to vote upon; members may still vote outside of this list at this stage, except for in the four Supporting Actor/Actress categories (as these each contain thousands of eligible performers). The members’ votes are collated with those of the panellists to create the list of nominees.\n\nIn the second stage, the overall shortlist of nominees is voted on by both members and panellists to produce the winners.\n\nPrevious presenters of the Olivier Awards Ceremony include Michael Ball, Imelda Staunton, Anthony Head, James Nesbitt, Richard E. Grant, Richard Wilson, Sue Johnston, Clive Anderson, Angela Lansbury, Barry Norman, Peter Barkworth, Daniel Radcliffe, Anthony Hopkins, Sue Lawley, Diana Rigg, Edward Fox, Tim Rice, Gary Wilmot, Jane Asher, Tom Conti, Denis Quilley, Angela Rippon and Jason Manford.\n\nNotable people who have presented an individual Award include Diana, Princess of Wales, Eddie Izzard, Sir Tom Stoppard and, in 2007, Laurence Olivier's son, Richard.\n\nThe venue most associated with the Awards is Grosvenor House Hotel, which has housed the after-show reception nine times and hosted the whole event on four further occasions. As well as at the Grosvenor, the presentations have been held at: Victoria Palace, Lyceum, National Theatre Olivier, Albery (now Noël Coward), Shaftesbury, London Palladium, Dominion, Royalty, Theatre Royal Drury Lane, Café Royal, Piccadilly, and The Park Lane Hilton.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2016 the awards ceremony was held at the Royal Opera House, moving to the Royal Albert Hall in 2017. The 2013 ceremony was the first ceremony to be broadcast on television since 2003.\n\nThe first Laurence Olivier Awards to be broadcast on television was the 1981 ceremony, which was broadcast on BBC1, and continued every year until 1992, before switching to BBC2 each year until 2003. The awards ceremony was then only broadcast on radio until 2011, when the BBC broadcast live interactive red-button coverage of the event, while Paul Gambaccini presented a programme on BBC Radio 2 with live coverage and interviews. The same coverage followed in 2012, before ITV secured the broadcast rights which saw the return of the Olivier Awards to mainstream television in 2013. This has continued in recent years, and the ceremony has also been broadcast on Magic Radio. \n\n\n\n\n\nSome notable records and facts about the Laurence Olivier Awards include the following:\n\n\n\n"}

The animated series was made between 1976 and 1983, and was produced by Otokar Balcy.\n\n\"Margo the Mouse\" stars a little Mouse called Margo (Myszka in the original Polish version) who lives in a big tree with her neighbours, a squirrel and a mole. It aired as part of the container TV animated series TVP Polonia.\n\nIt is the story and adventures of Margo, a little mouse who lives in a large tree made chalet. Small Margo has as neighbors Eliana, a squirrel who lives on the top floor; and Dennis, a dormouse that lives in the basement.\n\nHowever, all is not happiness for Margo. The little mouse must deal with some enemies. One day, Eliana goes to visit her mother because she is sick and Margo must look after the house. Then, at night, a sullen owl settles in Eliana's house illegally. So Margo seek ways to take the owl out of the house of her friend.\n\nOn another occasion, Margo prevents a beggar rat from occupying her home without her permission. Like while hiking should avoid being eaten by a stork. Although Margo has good friends like Anna, a sparrow; or Christophe, a cricket who likes to play the violin.\n\nWith her friends, Margo lives many adventures.\n\nTelewizja Polska broadcast the animated series sporadically for seven years. In the 80s, \"Margo the Mouse\" was sold for international distribution. In several European countries, the series was released direct to video, as in France, Russia or Germany where the series was titled with differente names as \"Jeannette, la petite souris\", \"Priklyucheniya myshki\" and \"Die kleine Maus Margot\" respectively and was made a feature film with a combination of some episodes. Due to the success of the film in several countries, in Poland it was decided to release it also like compilation movie in 1987. Something similar happened with \"Ciné si\", the animated TV series by French director Michel Ocelot, who later premiered some fragments in his package-film \"Princes and Princesses\". In Spain, the compilation movie was released in 1990 and the TV series was broadcast on regional television channels in 2001. In France, the Netherlands and Switzerland, the television series was released on DVD in the early 2000s, as did the UK and the United States.\n\nIn United Kingdom, \"Margo the Mouse\" was released by GM Distribution with English subtitles. In United States and Canada, \"Margo the Mouse\" was distributed by Facets Video with name \"The Adventures of Little Mouse\" although series is titled \"Margo the Mouse\" was aired on PBS in the United States. TV series was broadcast in Russia in 1989.\n\nIn Japan, \"Margo the Mouse\" was released as compilation movie, as Spanish and French edition and, later, this feature version was also released in Poland, officially. \"Przygody Myszki, film\" was distributed by Studio Ghibli in the collection of classic films of Ghibli Museum Library in collaboration with Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment and Cinema ANGELICA. Films like \"Moya Iyubov\" and \"The Humpbacked Horse\" of soviet Soyuzmultfilm animation studio are part of the same collection.\n\n"}

{"id": "5074387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5074387", "title": "Need for Speed: Carbon", "text": "Need for Speed: Carbon\n\nNeed for Speed: Carbon is a 2006 racing video game developed for several platforms by Electronic Arts, Rovio Mobile and Exient Entertainment. It is published by Electronic Arts. It is the tenth installment in the \"Need for Speed\" series and a sequel to \"\". It was followed by \"\" in the following year.\n\nThe PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance versions of the game are called Need for Speed: Carbon – Own the City, set in a fictional city named Coast City with a significantly different storyline and also featuring different AI teammate abilities. In 2009, a version of \"Own the City\" was also released on the Zeebo as a pre-installed game.\n\nThe gameplay of \"Need for Speed: Carbon\" is similar to its predecessors, \"\" and \"\", but based upon rival street racing crews instead of individuals. Players run a crew and can hire specific street racers to be in their crew and the active friendly racer is known as a wingman. Each employable street racer has two skills, a racing skill (scout, blocker, and drafter) and a non-race skill (fixer, mechanic, and fabricator). Each skill has different properties from finding hidden alleys/back streets (shortcuts) to reducing police attention. Cars driven by the wingmen are also different; blockers drive muscle, drafters drive exotics and scouts drive tuners (although the first two unlockable wingmen (Neville and Sal) drive cars according to the player's chosen car class at the start of the game). Car classes are Tuners, Muscle, and Exotics, and are associated with their own borough and Boss (Tuners/Downtown/Kenji, Exotics/Fortuna/Wolf, and Muscle/Kempton/Angie).\n\nPlayers must choose a class when starting Career Mode, which will be permanent throughout the career. Each choice starts in a different district, with corresponding initial car choices and unlocks as the game progresses (there is a test drive option at the beginning). Players may ultimately choose from any class of car, and can also unlock cars that are reserved for Quick Races as they earn Reward Cards.\n\nIn Career Mode, races cannot be redone for the same purse; if won, the purse is only $500. It is necessary for players to plan carefully which cars they will buy and upgrade, to avoid running out of money. There are phone calls, texts and emails to go along with the storyline. Winning races causes new races to show up on the map. All gameplay takes place at night. As in \"Most Wanted\" the player can use Nitrous Oxide and Speedbreaker, which accumulate simply from driving, not from specific skill use to earn them.\n\nGameplay control methods vary from console to console. In PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, control steering through the control pad, while acceleration, braking and other controls can be configured and mapped to the different buttons on the controllers. The Driving Force GT and G27 racing wheels can be used, and this is the first \"Need for Speed\" title to implement force-feedback and the 900 degree turning radius. In Windows version, joysticks and wheel controllers are supported, as well as those that support force feedback. Wii version lacks online play, but fully supports the use of the Wii Remote.\n\n\"Carbon\" was the first \"Need for Speed\" title to feature online exclusive game modes. Players can upload in-game screenshots to the \"Need for Speed\" website, complete with stats and modifications. The Pursuit Knockout and Pursuit Tag game modes are modes that allow the player to play as either a racer or a cop. Pursuit Knockout is essentially a lap knockout with a twist. The racers that are knocked out of the race come back as cops and it's their job to try to stop the other racers from finishing the race through any means necessary. The player that finishes the race wins. Pursuit Tag begins with one player as a racer and the rest of the players as cops. It is the cops' job to arrest the racer. The cop that makes the arrest then turns into a racer and has to try to avoid the cops. The player who spends the most time as a racer wins.\n\nUnlike \"Need for Speed: Most Wanted\" and \"Underground\", \"Carbon\" has no drag racing. However, \"Carbon\" features the return of drift racing, a mode that had been included in two previous installments \"\" and \"Underground 2\", but omitted from \"Carbon\"s predecessor, \"\". Other familiar race forms return, such as Sprint, Circuit, and \"Tollbooth\" (renamed \"Checkpoint\"). There are no Street X or Knockout races, and winning Outruns (renamed \"Rival Crew Challenges\") is not necessary to complete the game as it was in \"Underground 2\".\n\nMost of \"Carbon\" focus lies through various Canyon Events, based on Japanese Touge races. There are four types of Canyon Events: Canyon Duel, Canyon Sprint, Canyon Checkpoint and Canyon Drift. Canyon Duels have two stages: In the first stage, the player chases the rival and accumulates points faster the closer they stick to the opponent. In the second stage, the roles are reversed and the player's points decline faster the closer the opponent is. If anyone falls behind or is overtaken and passed, without regaining the distance, after ten seconds they lose. Players can also lose by going off the cliff edge. Some races have destructible, lit-up guardrails players must be careful not to crash through, and some have solid walls. The Canyon Drift and Canyon Duel are similar to the 2006 film \"\".\n\nIn Career mode, players have to win races throughout the city to conquer territories, and then face off against bosses to conquer the first three boroughs. To challenge Darius (Boss of the fourth borough) and win the game, players must defeat the three Bosses in two final races and defeat Darius in a Circuit race and a Canyon Duel. Throughout the game, as the player accumulates territories, the minor crews (Black Hearts and Kings, who drive exotics, Inferno and Los Colibres, who drive muscles, and Rotor 4 and Scorpios, who drive tuners), might attack the player's owned races/territories. The player can then either accept the challenge, and keep the race if they win it, or decline, in which case, the minor crew will automatically retake the race, and the territory if too many races are lost.\n\n\"Carbon\" also features Quick Races modes (including 2 players) and Reward Cards, in which card pieces are won by achievements in and out of Career Mode. Once a card is fully won, new cars, parts, or other features are unlocked. The Challenge Series is a set of 36 events (12 categories with 3 difficulty levels). Finishing a Challenge category also unlocks features.\n\nAs with \"Most Wanted\", police is a key mechanic in \"Carbon\". Police chases can break out at any time, including when in Free Roam mode, when racing, or just after a race is completed. The background music and most of the radio dialogue is the same as in \"Most Wanted\". Canyon Races and Checkpoint Races have no risk of police pursuit. As with \"Most Wanted\", there are 5 conditions/heat levels and players should be careful to avoid getting pursued by state or federal authorities. The Collector's Edition features three additional heat levels.\n\nAlthough the pursuit system is similar to \"Most Wanted\", this feature has been reprogrammed in \"Carbon\" to ensure that police are not too dominant in arrest tactics in high pursuit levels. Unlike in \"Most Wanted\", it is possible to evade the police after running over a spike strip by using nitrous. At the same time, some of the police tactics (such as the spike strips) are used in ways that make pursuits much harder to escape, and the police cars are much harder to disable. Using Pursuit Breakers no longer guarantees the blockage/destruction of every pursuing vehicle. However, police can be seen patrolling the map and won't engage in a pursuit—unless the players have a warrant (evaded a previous pursuit) or committed an offence in sight of the police.\n\n\"Need for Speed: Carbon\" features a new car customization option called \"Autosculpt\", enabling players to utilize aftermarket car parts and shape/mold the parts to their liking. Players can also have multiple customized vinyls as well, which can be moved, resized, or skewed, which offers unlimited design possibilities, The layering system of vinyls returns after having absence in \"Most Wanted\". Autosculpt was also used in Need For Speed: Prostreet, though it played a large role in aerodynamic capabilities of the car.\n\nPerformance tuning has been redone so that players, as upgrades are purchased, can tune the car for a number of different properties, such as higher top speed or higher acceleration. Unlike \"Most Wanted\", all of \"Carbon\" performance tuning/enhancing and car customizing is done inside the Safe House. A new \"optimize\" feature has been added for players who just want the best options without spending too much time tuning and configuring.\n\nPlayers can choose from many licensed cars divided into three classes as follows: Tuners, Muscles, and Exotics. Each car has its own characteristic ranging from easy cornering to well-balanced road performance. For example, Tuners are good in handling and tight corners, Exotics have high top speeds, and Muscles can accelerate fast in a short amount of time. In Career Mode, players must choose a class at the beginning, but are ultimately free to purchase and/or use any vehicle throughout the career.\n\nFor portables, the \"Own the City\" version has many differences. There are new game modes, like Escape where the player must escape from a rival crew's territory, Delivery where the players and their crew have to deliver a package to a designated area in first place to win, and Crew Takedown, where players have to eliminate a set number of rival racers to win. Crew management allows hiring of up to 5 wingmen per crew, with 2 active for racing. Players can use the crews for all races except for Lap Knockout, Escape and Crew Takedown modes. The city is also divided into many areas, some together into a district owned by one crew, with a total of 6 districts and 13 areas. Every area conquered gives new unlocks and new wingmen. Wingmen also have three different classes; a brawler that takes down racers, a drafter that drafts racers to give speed boosts, and assassins that deliver spike strips the player needs to avoid that can blow a car's tires, aimed for enemy cars. \"Own the City\" also allows free roaming with crates scattered throughout the whole city that when broken, give special unlocks ranging from cash to game art. Police chases are only available in free roam, and are not available in races.\n\nThe game is set in the fictional city of Palmont (with the exception of NFS: Own The City.). There are three major canyons in Palmont: East, West, and Carbon Canyon. The southwestern border of the city features a sea coast. The city also includes several rivers and a lake near Carbon Canyon. It resembles very much to \"Most Wanted\". Palmont is divided into four boroughs at the beginning of the game: Kempton (southwest industrial area), Downtown (east metropolitan area), Fortuna (west residential area) and Silverton (north casino & resort area) ; one for each of the major crews. A highway system extending through the middle of the city is the main connection between the boroughs. All boroughs except Silverton are initially accessible to the player; access to Silverton is unlocked only after beating the crews in the other three boroughs. There is an additional hidden area named San Juan, but similar to the canyons, it's not connected to the boroughs of Palmont. Palmont is also featured in the massively multiplayer online racing game \"\", along with Rockport of \"Most Wanted\".\n\nAfter escaping from the authorities in , the player drives in a BMW M3 GTR on a canyon route to Palmont City. A flashback of what seems to be a race against Kenji, Angie, and Wolf comes to the player's mind. A police incident at the end of the race forces the player to make a hasty escape from Palmont with Darius's Toyota Supra, leaving Wolf, Angie, Kenji, Nikki and many bystanders arrested by the Palmont SWAT units. In the present day, the player is nearing the city limits of Palmont, when is rammed from behind by a driver in a 2006 Chevrolet Corvette Z06. The driver turns out to be former Rockport Police Sergeant Nathan Cross (played by Dean McKenzie), now a bounty hunter. After a high-speed chase down the canyon, they both run into a construction zone, where Cross then corners the player who has just totaled their car. Shortly before an irate Cross can arrest the player (who is still upset about the incident in Rockport City), Darius (played by Tahmoh Penikett) and his crew arrive. Darius pays off Cross, and the player meets up with Nikki (played by Emmanuelle Vaugier), a former girlfriend, who is apparently outraged about the player's return.\n\nDarius tells the player to regain control of the different territories in Palmont. Winning races one by one, the player acquires territories and ultimately districts from the major crews, before beating the bosses of those crews. The 3 major bosses are:\nThere are various other smaller crews, such as 4Rotor (who use Mazdas with rotary engines), Black Hearts, and Los Colibres (The Hummingbirds). After beating each crew boss, the player meets up with a former member of that boss's crew: Yumi (Bushido; played by Melody Miyuki Ishikawa), Samson (21st Street) and Colin (T.F.K.), who want to join the player's crew and reveal their observations regarding the night the player took off from Palmont.\n\nAfter gaining control of all three districts, Darius asks the player to meet up with him. He reveals that he was just using the player all along to get more territory, and that he has brought Cross along to arrest the player. Darius leaves the player at the mercy of Cross, but the player is saved by the arrival of Nikki (who made a secret deal with Cross), who tells him that she now realizes everything that happened months ago after piecing together her view of the night and the viewpoints of the other racers, revealing that Darius was the one who tipped off the police, switched the money bag and let the player escape. When Darius finds out that Nikki is working with the player, he hires the three previous bosses (Kenji, Angie, and Wolf) into his new crew, Stacked Deck. The player then attempts to conquer Silverton, and oust Darius and his Stacked Deck crew, to exact revenge for Darius' actions.\n\nThe player begins to win races against the Stacked Deck, and gets his chance to beat Darius for control of Palmont and to accord justice. After finally defeating Darius, Darius surrenders his Audi Le Mans Quattro to the player. Before he leaves the city, Darius tells the player to \"...enjoy it while it lasts. There's always someone out there who's a little faster than you are...and sooner or later they're going to catch up.\".\n\nIn this version of the game, The player has flashbacks to a race where he, and his brother Mick and a couple of other racers are racing to decide who owns the city. But a terrible car crash ruins the competition - leaving the player in the hospital with amnesia and Mick dead. His death also made the city divide back into different crew territories. Upon waking up, the player is greeted by Mick's girlfriend named Sara, and Carter, Mick's wingman, as they visit Mick's grave and help the player regain his memories.\n\nThe player is set to find out who killed Mick, and goes on different races to beat different crews, regain territory and see if they know anything about the accident, where each crew boss then describes what they know about the accident that killed Mick - as well as unlocking more crew members from the respective rival crews. The player soon finds out that the crash was caused by a kid named Buddy, and after a visit to a crew boss called EX - who explains to player where he can find Buddy. However, before EX could finish explaining, Sara is seemingly caught in an explosion. The player is driven further to find out who caused the trouble - and soon confronts Buddy. He then reveals that he was hired, and hands the player his phone. \nThe player then continues to complete more races. shortly afterwards, he meets and encounters an undercover police racer named MK, who, after being defeated by the player, then helps him with MK’s police abilities to find out who planned the murder, through Buddy's phone.\n\nIt is revealed that EX was the one who planned the crash, and the player goes after him, with MK's police forces in the end apprehending EX after defeated by the player. Sara appears, and tells the racer to race her, which she in the end reveals the truth: the player hired EX to get rid of Mick due to Mick's monstrous personality that hurt Sara and the player, and EX, in turn, hired Buddy to crash Mick's car causing the \"accident\" resulting in Mick's death. It was all following the player's plan. Sara then hands the player Mick's watch, saying that he is different from Mick, and that she is free together with the player.\n\nBy default, hip hop/grime songs are played when the player is driving an exotic car, electronic songs are played when the player is driving a tuner car, and rock music is played when the player is driving a muscle car, though this setting can be turned off. These songs were released by EA in very limited quantities on a special edition disc. The songs played within the safe house and other game menus, as well as a small number of races were composed by London electronic act Ekstrak, and was released widely by EA, and is available from online retailers such as iTunes, as well as hard copies. Other music, most played in major races, such as Race Wars and Canyon Battles have been widely released akin to the Ekstrak release. This actual soundtrack consists of music composed by Trevor Morris, who has gone on to work with Steve Jablonsky for the 2007 EA RTS game, \"\".\n\n\"Need for Speed: Carbon\" was first shown in EA's montage at Nintendo's E3 2006 conference and booth and was the cover story in the \"Game Informer\" magazine issue of July 2006. In the early development stages, the graphics had more detail and the city was planned to be bigger. Also found in the game's files show that many of the game's features were scrapped such as being able to drift with other A.I. players, similar to \"\". What may appear to be an entire crew called \"LeSamurai\" was found in the game's files. \"LeSamurai\" may have taken a huge part in the game's plot as their crew logo is found in many various places in the city. However, the crew logo is not found Downtown. \"LeSamurai\" may not be the official crew name, but it's the name of some of the contents in one of the game's files. \"Carbon\" is the first in the \"Need for Speed\" series to be released for PlayStation 3 and Wii seventh generation consoles and also the final in the series to be released for Xbox, GameCube and Game Boy Advance. \"Carbon\" features some of cars of its predecessors; namely \"\" and \"\", but also incorporates many new additions including the Audi Le Mans quattro, the Chrysler 300C SRT 8, Chevrolet's Chevelle SS and the Alfa Romeo Brera. Carbon features the Canadian actress and model Emmanuelle Vaugier as Nikki, the player's main source of help and ally in the Career storyline. The game is available for use with Mac OS X. \"Need for Speed: Carbon\" debuted at number one on the UK All Format Gaming Chart on its first week of release, beating Konami's \"Pro Evolution Soccer\".\n\n\"Carbon\" was also the first game in the series to feature detailed character animations for the Windows and seventh-generation releases using facial motion capture, where ingame models of characters such as Neville, Wolf, Angie and Kenji appear in realtime cutscenes taunting or remarking the player in a race or at certain points. This has however been omitted on the sixth-generation and Wii versions due to platform limitations.\n\nThe Need for Speed: Carbon – Collector's Edition features 4 exclusive cars, 10 pre-tuned cars, 6 new races, 3 unique challenge events, 10 unique vinyls and a Bonus DVD showing the making of Carbon and showcasing all the cars used in the game. The Collector's Edition also features alternate box art and a metallic-finish sleeve encasing the case of the game. Although the Mac edition doesn't display the Collector's Edition title, it contains all Collector's Edition features. The downloaded version of the game features the Ultimate Performance Kit, 2006 Pagani Zonda F and the 1971 Dodge Challenger. An arcade version of the same name was released by EA Arcades in 2008. The Collector's Edition is not available for PS3.\n\n\"Need for Speed: Carbon\" was met with generally positive reviews. IGN gave the PC version an 8.2 out of 10 and the PlayStation 3 version a 7.9 out of 10 citing \"It's not revolutionary, it's not brilliant, but it's good, deep racing,\". GameSpot gave praise for adding more movie clips, customization and solid gameplay but was critical about frustrating boss battles and under utilizing police chases.\n\n\"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave the game an average score of 8.0. \"Hyper\"'s Daniel Wilks commends the game for its \"large gameworld\" but criticises it for its \"easy, drift course mechanics suck [and] cutscene 'actors'\". The Australian video game talk show \"Good Game\" gave the game a 5/10.\n\n\"Need for Speed: Carbon\" has sold 3.2 million copies in the United States. Its PlayStation 2 version received a \"Double Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 600,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\n"}

It is noted for its cute appearance and facial recognition system. The robot's development began in 1997 with the first prototype, the R100. The name PaPeRo was adopted in 2001.\n\nPaPeRo has been researched and developed with the intent to be a partner with human beings and its being able to live together with them. For this reason, it has various basic functions for the purpose of interacting with people.\n\nSince the original introduction of PaPeRo, there have been a few different versions, including a Childcare Version, 2003 and 2005 revised versions, and \"PaPe-Jiro\", a robotic comedian. In 2006, a virtual PaPeRo was released for use in any PC running the Windows operating system and the Pocket PC. The robot is programmable using a development environment known as \"PaPeRo Creator\".\n\nFor PaPeRo to interact with people and perform autonomous actions, it must understand information on the conditions of, and outside, the location where it has been put. For this reason, various devices have been included to detect the outside area, such as a CCD camera, microphone, ultrasonic sensors, etc.\n\nIn spring 2009, NEC introduced PaPeRo Mini, weighing half of the current PaPeRo model, with physical dimensions roughly half the size of the original. The PaPeRo Petit was introduced in 2013, which is even smaller at 23 cm tall. NEC plans to use this version to provide a service \"that will allow family members living apart to watch over each other utilizing the robot and cloud computing technology.\" \n\n\n\"Source:\" \n\nPaPeRo uses different technologies to interact with its environment. For example, Its \"eyes\" are really twin cameras with a face recognition system. When PaPeRo has nothing to do, it roams around looking for faces. Upon finding one, it will try to start a conversation. PaPeRo also has a speech recognition system. With a pair of sensitive microphones, it can determine exactly where a sound comes from and if the sound is human speech. The robot will then interpret the information and respond accordingly. While PaPeRo roams around, it uses an ultrasound system located in its chest to detect objects. If an object lies in its path, PaPeRo's ultrasound system will detect where exactly the object is, and then PaPeRo will decide what to do to avoid the object. PaPeRo also has other sensors located in its head, which can detect if the robot is patted, slapped, etc., with PaPeRo responding accordingly.\n"}

There are three parts in a production: pre-production, production, and post-production. Pre-production ends when the planning ends and the content starts being produced.\n\nIn filmmaking and video production, pre-production formally begins once a project has been greenlit. At this stage, finalizing preparations for production go into effect. Financing will generally be confirmed and many of the key elements such as principal cast members, director and cinematographer are set. By the end of pre-production, the screenplay is usually finalized and satisfactory to all the financiers and other stakeholders.\n\nDuring pre-production, the script is broken down into individual scenes storyboards and all the locations, props, cast members, costumes, special effects and visual effects are identified. An extremely detailed \"schedule\" is produced and arrangements are made for the necessary elements to be available to the film-makers at the appropriate times. Sets are constructed, the crew is hired, financial arrangements are put in place and a start date for the beginning of principal photography is set. At some point in pre-production there will be a read-through of the script which is usually attended by all cast members with speaking parts, the director, all heads of departments, financiers, producers, and publicists.\n\nIn the music industry, pre-production is a process whereby a recording artist spends time creating and refining their musical ideas. The artist thus produces a song's demo recording, or rough draft, in order to pre-establish the song's creative premise. This reduces the time and money spent in expensive studios. The goal is to enter into the major recording phase of production with the basic and most promising ideas having been already established.\n\nNotable producers who preferred this process have included Bruce Fairbairn and Bob Rock. They have both produced successful albums such as Bon Jovi's \"Slippery When Wet\", Mötley Crüe's \"Dr. Feelgood\", Metallica's \"The Black Album\" and Aerosmith's \"Permanent Vacation\".\n\n"}

It was released for Microsoft Windows, Linux, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One. The game, serving as an epilogue to \"Saints Row IV\", is a standalone expansion, meaning players do not need a copy of \"Saints Row IV\" to play \"Gat out of Hell\".\n\nThe PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions were released both physically and digitally. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions saw a release bundled alongside \"Saints Row IV: Re-Elected\", and was released both physically and digitally as well. \"Gat Out Of Hell\" was released as a monthly free game on PlayStation Network in July 2016.\n\nThe player controls Johnny Gat or Kinzie Kensington in an open world environment. \"Gat out of Hell\" shares many gameplay aspects with the previous installments, being primarily played as a third-person shooter in an open world city scattered with quests, secondary objectives, and various collectibles. Superhuman abilities return from \"Saints Row IV\". \"Gat out of Hell\" introduces \"angelic flight\", giving wings to the player. Unlike past \"Saints Row\" games, players cannot customize the playable characters; however, by importing a \"Saints Row IV\" save, players can import their custom Boss character to replace the default Boss.\n\nUnlike game progression in previous titles, players advance through the story by completing activities to fill a \"Satan's Wrath\" meter, which unlocks cutscenes and further story elements. \"Gat out of Hell\" takes place in an open world new to the series, New Hades, made up of five islands: Shantytown, Barrens, Downtown, Forge, and the Den, all surrounding a central tower on a middle island.\n\nThe player is able to fly around the open-world hell. They can also summon demon allies to flight alongside them.\n\nThe game's weapons are inspired by the seven deadly sins, e.g., a Gluttony Gun that shoots cake batter on enemies for other people to consume.\n\nThe Third Street Saints hold a birthday party for lieutenant Kinzie Kensington (Natalie Lander) on their spaceship, but while playing a game of Ouija Board with a board that once belonged to Aleister Crowley, they unwittingly contact Satan (Travis Willingham), who proclaims that The Boss will marry his daughter Jezebel (Kate Reinders). Satan drags the Boss down to Hell, with Saints lieutenant Johnny Gat (Daniel Dae Kim), as well as Kinzie, volunteering to rescue them.\n\nUpon arriving, they find Ultor Corporation has a branch in Hell and suspect former Saints enemy, Dane Vogel (Jay Mohr), is responsible. Vogel denies involvement, but admits he is taking advantage of Hell's economy, offering to help the Saints save the Boss. Meanwhile, Jezebel is rebelling against her father, as Satan declares her a possession to him. Vogel helps Johnny and Kinzie get Satan's attention by going around Hell and gaining allies such as Kiki (Ashly Burch) & Viola DeWynter (Sasha Grey), William Shakespeare (Liam O'Brien), Blackbeard (Matthew Mercer), and Vlad the Impaler (Liam O'Brien).\n\nJezebel finds Johnny and offers to take him to Satan's palace, in hopes he can defeat her father. At the palace, Johnny immediately confronts Satan, who threatens to kill Jezebel unless Johnny drops his gun. When he does, Satan gleefully boasts and praises Johnny, naming him worthy of marrying Jezebel. When Johnny refuses to listen, Satan forcibly makes a deal with Johnny to let Kinzie and the Boss go if he marries Jezebel in the Boss's place.\n\nJohnny shoots Satan at the wedding to no effect, so Johnny and Kinzie take out Satan's minions to force Satan into fighting them. They defeat Satan, who surrenders. Satan banishes them back to the mortal realm, along with Jezebel and the Boss. Johnny, however, is detained by God (Nathan Fillion), who explains that Satan was plotting an invasion on Heaven since Zinyak hastened the Apocalypse by destroying Earth, hoping to use the Boss as the general of his army, and offers to repay Johnny for stopping him.\n\nJohnny is given one of five choices by God; go to Heaven to be reunited with his girlfriend Aisha, return to Hell to become its new king, find a new home world for the Saints so humanity can be rebuilt, recreate Earth, or be told the secrets of the universe. Recreating Earth leads to the timeline of \"Agents of Mayhem\". The universe of \"Saints Row\" is retconed, and Johnny becomes the lieutenant of the Seoul police force, hoping to find his friends. Kinzie and Matt Miller (Yuri Lowenthal) converse about \"Brimstone\", a captured female who Johnny goes to interrogate.\n\nIn December 2013, comedian Jay Mohr, who voiced antagonist Dane Vogel in \"Saints Row 2\", revealed that he was doing voice work for the next \"Saints Row\" game. It was later revealed Volition would be unveiling a new game at PAX Prime on the August 29, 2014. They teased an image which depicts a Ouija board with the Saints' fleur-de-lis on it. Later, at their panel on the same day, Volition and Deep Silver confirmed a standalone expansion to \"Saints Row IV\", called \"Saints Row: Gat out of Hell\". The game was initially scheduled for release on January 27, 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One but was later rescheduled to January 20, 2015 in North America and January 23, 2015 in Europe. The game will be released in a bundle alongside \"Saints Row IV: Re-Elected\" for Xbox One and PlayStation 4.\n\nThe expansion was inspired, in part, by Disney films, which are among the \"big loves\" of the game's creative director, Steve Jaros. He wanted the game to parody the fairytale qualities and \"whimsical love songs\" of the Disney film genre. Parts of the plot were taken from such films, including the birthday party prologue from \"Sleeping Beauty\", talking inanimate objects, princess Jezebel rebelling against her father, Satan, through her spousal choice, and musical acts where Satan sings sentimentally. The open world was designed to be a \"fun toy box\" that encouraged traversal through flight. The January 2015 launch trailer included a hotline phone number with promotional hold music.\n\n\"Saints Row: Gat out of Hell\" received generally mixed reviews. Aggregating review website Metacritic gave the Microsoft Windows version a 66/100 based on 24 reviews, the Xbox One version a 65/100 based on 16 reviews and the PlayStation 4 version a 64/100 based on 45 reviews.\n\nBrittany Vincent from \"Destructoid\" gave the game a 8/10, praising the game's setting, refreshing superpower abilities, new cast of characters, interesting types of enemies and entertaining world, which she stated \"feels much more polished and finished than \"Saints Row IV\"s Steelport simulation.\" However, she criticized the game's short length. She summarized the review by saying \"There's no agenda and no life lessons to learn in \"Saints Row\". There's only pure escapism, which is what games are meant for in my view. Whenever I feel like I need a break, I will have \"Saints Row\" proudly on my shelf.\" Andrew Reiner from \"Game Informer\" gave the game a 7.5/10, praising the worthwhile side-activities, well-designed dialogues, satisfying transversal system, creative weapons and storytelling. However, he criticized the graphics, which he stated is on par with the last-generation version of \"Saints Row IV\", as well as occasional framerate losses. He also criticized the game for lacking in gameplay complexity.\n\nMikel Reparaz from IGN criticized the game for lacking traditional story missions, as well as featuring repetitive side missions, unimpressive graphics, and being extremely buggy. Alex Carlson from Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 3.5/5, praising the voice-acting, dialogues, collectibles, flight mechanics and the game-world, which he stated \"has a balance between familiar and fresh\", but criticizing the game for being too similar to the original \"Saints Row IV\" in terms of the variety of superpower and mission types, as well as the middling story and graphical glitches. Phil Savage from \"PC Gamer\" gave the game a 67/100, praising the world design and in-game abilities such as flying, which he stated \"has delivered a new sense of freedom\". However, he criticized the lack of proper campaign missions and scripting, limited creativity as well as the poor combat system. He ended the review by saying that \"\"Gat Out of Hell\" offers all the open-world distractions of a \"Saints Row\" game, but it seldom displays the spark of creativity, which made [\"Saints Row The Third\" and \"Saints Row IV\"] so remarkable.\"\n"}

Usually there are no strictly defined goals in the game, with the player instead allowed to control a character freely. Well-known examples are war games, business games, and role play simulation.\n\nFrom three basic types of strategic, planning, and learning exercises: games, simulations, and case studies, a number of hybrids may be considered, including simulation games that are used as case studies.\n\nComparisons of the merits of simulation games versus other teaching techniques have been carried out by many researchers and a number of comprehensive reviews have been published.\n\nIn the mid 1980s, Code masters and the Oliver Twins released a number of games with \"Simulator\" in the title, including \"BMX Simulator\" (1986), \"Grand Prix Simulator\" (1986), and \"Pro Boxing Simulator\" (1988). Richard and David Darling of Code masters were inspired by Concertmaster's best-selling games, which were based on real sports such as football and BMX racing, which had a pre-existing popularity. In a parody of the established \"simulator\" cliche, \"Your Sinclair\" released a game titled \"Advanced Lawnmower Simulator\" in 1988.\n\nWhile many credit simulation games beginning with Will Wright and \"SimCity\" in 1989, the true progenitor of the genre was \"Fortune Builder\", released in 1984 for ColecoVision. Games such as \"SimLife\" and \"SimEarth\" were subsequently created and are capable of teaching players the basics of genetics and global ecosystems.\n\nA study of adolescents who played \"SimCity 2000\" found that those players had a greater appreciation and expectation of their government officials after playing.\n\nConstruction and management simulation (CMS) is a type of simulation game in which players build, expand or manage fictional communities or projects with limited resources. Strategy games sometimes incorporate CMS aspects into their game economy, as players must manage resources while expanding their projects. Pure CMS games differ from strategy games in that \"the player's goal is not to defeat an enemy, but to build something within the context of an ongoing process.\" Games in this category are sometimes also called \"management games\".\n\nLife simulation games (or artificial life games) are a subgenre of simulation video games in which the player lives or controls one or more artificial lifeforms. A life simulation game can revolve around \"individuals and relationships, or it could be a simulation of an ecosystem\".\n\nSome video games simulate the playing of sports. Most sports have been recreated by video games, including team sports, athletics and extreme sports. Some games emphasize playing the sport (such as the \"Madden NFL\" series), whilst others emphasize strategy and organization (such as \"Championship Manager\"). Some, such as \"Arch Rivals\", satirize the sport for comic effect. This genre has been popular throughout the history of video games, and is competitive, just like real-world sports. A number of game series feature the names and characteristics of real teams and players, and are updated annually to reflect real-world changes.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Strategic moves can either be \"unconditional moves\" or \"response rules\". The key characteristics of a strategic move are that it involves a \"commitment\" from the player, meaning the player can only restrict her own choices, and that the commitment has to be \"credible\", meaning that once employed it must be in the interest of the player to follow through with the move. Credible moves should also be observable to the other players.\n\nStrategic moves are not \"warnings\" or \"assurances.\" Warnings and assurances are merely statements of a player's interest, rather than an actual \"commitment\" from the player.\nThe term was coined by Thomas Schelling in his 1960 book, \"The Strategy of Conflict\", and has gained wide currency in political science and industrial organization. \n\n"}

The Studios were organized in the Power Corporation of Greece (ΔΕΗ) pavilion, with Philips supplied and other locally improvised equipment. \n\nSome years later, a small private station started operating round the year from another pavilion in the very same Fair. This station operated until 1968 when the two new government channels started operation in Thessaloniki and requested the elimination of the \"Illegal\" station.\n\nThe two government channels, television being a government monopoly, during that period were ERT and YENED (for the military forces).\n\nAfter the construction of the OTE Tower (Hellenic Telecommunications Corporation) in the Thessaloniki Fair area, OTE started a third state TV channel in SECAM color. The two initial state channels requested the closing and elimination of the new OTE channel, fearing that OTE would drive them to close, because of the superiority of the color picture, the telecommunications network and the technical superiority of OTE. They succeeded and all the equipment, that OTE already had, passed to YENED, which started what now became ERT3 (the third national channel, broadcasting from Thessaloniki).\n\nDuring the Greek military government period of 1967–74, the programme was a mixture of news and entertainment. A notable serial which still owns the watching record was the war drama \"O Agnostos Polemos\" (The Unknown War).\n\nAfter the restoration of the Republic in 1974, Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation ERT continue to dominate, appealing to a much larger audience than YENED. Color television broadcasts began in the late 1970s. Notable people were placed to improve the quality of the national channels, such as Dimitris Horn, Manos Hatzidakis and the Nobel laureate poet Odysseas Elytis.\n\nFinally ERT incorporated YENED.\n\nTV 100 (1988) is the first non-state TV station in Greece. It belongs to the Municipality of Thessaloniki, founded in 1988 by the then mayor of the city Sotiris Kouvelas, who served as mayor until 1989 and a year later, he founded TV station with national coverage in Athens.\n\nIn 1982, ERT and YENED merged, forming \"ERT\" (Ellinikí Radiofonía Tileórasi), with ERT becoming \"ERT1\" and YENED becoming \"ERT2\". Broadcasts originally lasted for seven to eight hours daily starting at about 5:30PM with children shows and then the first televised news of the day. In 1987 an experimental teletext type information screen known as \"Tilegrafos\" (meaning televised words, i.e. telegraph) showed written information on ET2 during the afternoon. By the late 1980s, television broadcasts on ET1 and ET2 (still commonly known as ERT-1 and ERT-2 until later years) had increased to 12–15 hours daily, though it was still common for one or both stations to sign off briefly in the afternoon and sign back on in the early evening hours.\n\nSome illegal broadcasts made short-lived appearances during the 1980s showing mainly movies of adult nature but, in 1987, the City of Thessaloniki began rebroadcasting in a TV frequency parts of European satellite channels, leading to a dispute between the government and the city, as the stations' equipment was confiscated numerous times. The more serious challenge to ERT's TV monopoly, however, appeared with the establishment and operation of TV Plus in the Athens/Piraeus area, which begun broadcasting major US films to the starved-for-diversity Athens public. It is then that ERT decided to pre-empt the challenge to its TV monopoly and any further attempts to put private broadcasts on the air, by re-broadcasting itself foreign satellite channels. In October 1988, the first of these satellite channels made it to the airwaves in Athens to block the frequency used by TV Plus, and as this by-now very popular TV station kept changing its frequency, more and more satellite channels were added by ERT to block the frequencies used by TV Plus. They included: NBC Europe from Great Britain, TV5Monde from France, Sat.1 from Germany, Rai 2 from Italy, and Horizon (from the former Soviet Union). These stations were soon followed by MTV Europe and Sky from the United Kingdom, while the broadcasts of Super Channel was taken over by TV Plus, due to the lack of an actual agreement with ERT. Sky eventually morphed into what is now known as Eurosport, which is still rebroadcast in Greece, and Euronews, Rai 1 and Cyprus SAT were eventually added to the lineup. For a short time, NBC Europe was also rebroadcast, as were RTL Plus from Germany and 3sat.\n\nIn 1988, ERT also established ET3 a regional state-owned network which focused on issues of Northern Greece, to counter the Athens-centric broadcasts of the other two major state broadcasters at the time. Initially a regional network based in Thessaloniki, ET3 also began broadcasting in Athens, and within a few years, in most other regions of the country.\n\nThessaloniki was the home of Greece's first non-state owned television station, TV100, owned by the City of Thessaloniki, and TV Plus was the first non-state television station in the Athens region. TV Plus, was owned by Invest Plus SA, a US group headed by Daniel Bourla, with the participation of the Municipality of Piraeus, and its programming was quite innovative for Greek standards at the time, as it broadcast first-run Hollywood feature films with subtitles and no commercials. Soon, TV Plus began to offer an over-the-air subscription service, broadcasting an encoded signal 24-hours a day, which viewers could watch by obtaining a decoder (provided for free by the station) and paying a monthly subscription fee. This was especially revolutionary at the time, as a legal framework for private broadcasting, and private broadcasters, still did not exist in the country.\n\nERT did not take too kindly to the new television stations which began to crop up on the dial following the governments unsuccessful attempts to stop TV Plus, often changing the frequencies of its own stations around or adding repeaters, to interfere with new private broadcasts. However, in 1989, the Greek Parliament finally passed legislation legalizing private broadcasting (radio and television) and providing provisional licenses to two broadcasters, Mega Channel and Nea Tileorasi (New Television). Mega Channel began officially broadcasting in November 1989 as a national network, while Nea Tileorasi, after several months of broadcasting test bars, disappeared from the airwaves.\n\nOther private broadcasters took advantage of loopholes in the existing legislation and the lack of an organized licensing process to begin broadcasting almost overnight. In December 1989, Antenna TV began broadcasting nationally, named after the successful new radio station by the same name. Mega and Antenna featured similar programming styles, with locally produced comedies and dramas, numerous variety shows (following in the Italian tradition), American films, and tabloid news broadcasts. They immediately won over most of ERT's audience and advertising share, and to this day, are interchangeably the #1 and #2 stations in the audience ratings in Greece, while the ratings of ET1, ET2, and ET3 plummeted (they have recovered significantly since then but still do not challenge the major private networks).\n\nBy early 1990, numerous other stations also appeared on the air, including \"New Channel\" (no relation to Nea Tileorasi) with movies, music videos and talk shows, \"Channel Seven-X\" (with avant-garde programming including foreign films, intellectual programming and a simulcast of French music network MCM), \"Jeronimo Groovy TV\" (initially a popular music video station that broadcast in Athens, amidst serious interference from other stations), \"TeleCity\" (a right-wing political television station with news and talk shows), 902 TV (owned by the Communist Party of Greece), \"Kanali 29\" (a television station with political and cultural programs and a cult following), and a plethora of other broadcasters, which filled every available VHF and UHF frequency, often broadcasting only for several weeks or months, or with very little programming of note. Many broadcasters even began to broadcast on the same frequencies as other stations, especially ERT's satellite broadcasts, many of which soon completely disappeared from the airwaves, as ERT seemed unwilling or unable to protect its frequencies. Similarly, private stations sprung up throughout the country, in every city and region and most towns.\n\nThe color television transmission system SECAM which had been used since the late 1970s finally switched over to the PAL color system widely used in the rest of Europe. PAL was the system used for years in Greece via video tape playbacks on rented movies from video stores but not by ERT. The first TV station to broadcast in PAL was TV Plus, then by the other private TV stations that followed it and eventually by ERT.\n\nIn 1993, two new major players entered the market. Skai TV began broadcasting, after a prolonged battle for open frequencies with ERT and other stations, and soon began to broadcast as a new national network following in the footsteps of the highly rated Skai radio station in Athens. Also in 1993, Kanali 29's management was handed over to Niko Mastorakis, who was once again involved in Greek media after a long stint as a movie producer and director in the United States. Kanali 29 was renamed Star Channel, and featured programming rich in American films and TV series, and talk and lifestyle programmes. Star also began to broadcast nationally.\n\nThe following year, ERT decommissioned many of its terrestrial satellite broadcasts, and reassigned many of those now-vacant frequencies to Multichoice Hellas, for terrestrial pay-television services a year after TV Plus went off the air following a dispute with Time Warner that had acquired a 25% interest in the company. The name of this new pay-TV service was Filmnet. In 1995, Multichoice followed with another station, Supersport, which soon earned the broadcast rights to many Greek sports.\n\nIn 1997, ERT, whose audience had never recovered from the advent of private television, and which up until then lagged behind technologically compared to the largest private networks, revamped its operations, unveiling new logos and a new programming philosophy. The stations were modernized, and ET2 was renamed \"NET\" (Nea Elliniki Tileorassi). ET1 focused on general-interest programming (movies, sports, various TV series), while NET focused heavily on news and talk programming. ET3 continued to focus largely on Northern Greece, with a large dose of cultural programming.\n\nBy the late 1990s, Greece began to see its first major mergers and acquisitions (some of them ill-fated) in the realm of broadcast media. Skai TV was sold, and soon became known as \"Alpha-Sky\" before completely phasing into its new name as Alpha TV. Kanali 5, a regional television network broadcasting out of Athens, by the former owners of Kanali 29 (and with similar programming to that station), was also revamped, transitioning to \"Alter 5\" (with a program aimed largely at teenagers and young adults) before fully renaming itself to Alter. Its broadcast reach also gradually expanded, and the station now covers almost the entire country. Channel Seven-X, facing financial difficulties, was also sold, and was renamed \"Seven\", featuring programming heavy on sports and news/talk programs. Seven never quite achieved the success of some of the other stations, as it continued to face financial difficulties even after the sale, and never was able to broadcast outside of certain large cities in the country. New Channel, which broadcast in many major cities but did not offer much original programming, was sold to a new investor and renamed \"New Tempo\" and finally \"Tempo TV\", building up a national network of repeaters in an effort to become a major player in the television market, which it partially succeeded in, before financial troubles led to its failure in 2001. Finally, Makedonia TV, a regional private network broadcasting out of Thessaloniki, was purchased by the Antenna TV group, and has served as a secondary network featuring many old programs from Antenna TV, American TV series, and a newscast focusing on Northern Greece. The station now also broadcasts nationally.\n\nSpecialty networks had also begun to form. In 1992, TVC, Greece's first 24/24h music channel, began operating in Lesvos island. The channel during the 2000s reformed into the pan-European Music Force Europe, today available in 3 countries. Then, in 1996, Mad TV began operating out of Athens, replacing a small local channel known as \"Art 68\". Mad TV featured programming heavy on hit music videos, similar to MTV and its Greek predecessor Jeronimo Groovy TV (which continued to exist but with a small coverage area and with programming more heavily dependent on talk); both channels, in opposition to TVC, operated in a few-hour rotation. Mad TV did not build a national network of its own, but instead was rebroadcast through local stations throughout the country. TV 0-6 began broadcasting in Athens, with many cartoons and children's shows, while TV Magic, after an ill-fated attempt to become a news-talk station owned by Sokratis Kokkalis, became a station focusing on sports and particularly of Greek sports club Olympiacos, which Kokkalis also owned. Extra Channel was founded in 2000 with a heavy talk focus, and is now known as Extra 3.\n\nIn 1999, Multichoice Hellas also formed Nova, Greece's first satellite television subscription service, which initially featured most (but not all) of Greece's major networks, as well as many international networks, and other music and interactive services, which it has continued to expand since then. Nova was to be followed by a competing satellite platform, known as \"Magna\", by the owners of \"Seven\", which never began operations.\n\nIn 2000, Alpha TV founded \"Alpha Digital\", which broadcast Alpha TV, Polis TV (a local station serving Athens owned by Alpha) various thematic stations also operated by Alpha, the radio stations owned by the Alpha group, and a small variety of foreign television networks, headlined by MTV and VH1 (MTV, by that time, was no longer rebroadcast terrestrially in Greece, that ceased in 1999). Despite the popularity of MTV and VH1 and Alpha earning the rights to Greek soccer matches, the company soon went under, leaving Nova as the only company providing pay-TV services in Greece to this day. Plans for a satellite bouquet managed by OTE (the Greek telecommunications company) never went past the test phase, with OTE leasing frequencies on the Hot Bird satellite, rebroadcasting several smaller Greek TV stations as well as many radio stations free-to-air.\n\nThe past few years have seen the failure of many television ventures, but the creation and investment in many new ones. Polis TV was relaunched as \"Channel 9\" in December 2005, with programming heavy on news and talk shows. More recently, the original owners of Skai TV returned to the television business, relaunching Skai on the frequencies of \"Seven TV\". Other notable stations that have begun operating in recent years include \"Channel 10\", while TeleCity was renamed Tileasty. Other stations have upgraded and modernized, however, the Greek airwaves are still cluttered with many unlicensed television stations, often broadcasting programs of a low quality (telemarketing, low budget movies, music videos, illegal telephone hotlines, soft pornography).\n\nTo this day, the Greek government still has not issued official licenses to most television stations in Greece, which are currently broadcasting in a quasi-legal state. Tenders have been offered for national, regional and local broadcasts as well as terrestrial pay-TV services, which have either been frozen or have failed completely. Despite numerous government pledges, there has not been much movement on this issue in recent years. In the meantime, the airwaves are still cluttered, though things are significantly more organized than they were in the early 1990s. Despite the success of Nova, and the launch of Hellas-Sat, cable TV has been slow to follow, only existing on a local level in some communities around Greece until recently, when companies such as OnTelecoms have launched cable (IPTV) platforms.\n\nOn June 11, 2013 the Greek Government suspended the operation of the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) and automatically fired 2,600 workers, in one of numerous spending cuts that have been implemented during Greece's ongoing debt crisis. The plug was pulled at 23:10 during the news. On June 11, 2015 the new Government (made up of SYRIZA & AN.EL. parties) reinstated the operations of ERT by hiring back the personnel and broadcasting the three ERT channels ERT1, ERT2, ERT3.\n\nToday, Greece has four national state-owned networks, three state-owned national digital television networks, a state-owned satellite broadcast network, and several national private television networks, in addition to approximately 150 local and regional television stations broadcasting across the country. Audience ratings are handled by AGB Hellas.\n\nIn 2005, Alpha TV briefly ran experimental broadcasts in DVB-T locally in Athens, while in Heraklion, Crete, a regional network, Kriti TV, in conjunction with the University of Crete, also started digital operation.\n\nIn January 2006, the State broadcaster ERT launched free-to-air Digital terrestrial television (DVB-T) with three \"pilot\" channels called Prisma+, Cine+ and Sport+, collectively branded as ERT Digital. The first channel, Prisma+, was targeted at disabled persons, while Cine+ broadcasts movies, and Sport+ broadcasts a sports program. A fourth channel, the Cypriot national channel's satellite program RIK sat, was also retransmitted on digital.\n\nFrom September 2009 onwards, the seven major television stations in Greece broadcast in DVB-T MPEG-4, via a company set up by them, Digea. Because of the concentration of the population in a few cities, about 75% of the Greeks are now able to view DTT, although only a small proportion of the geographical area of Greece is covered. Areas covered (as at August 2011) include Attica, Thessalonica, Larissa, Alexandropolis, the Corinthian Gulf, and Rhodes Town.\n\nOn February 6, 2015, the transition to digital TV in Greece was completed. A digital-ready TV or set-top box is required to view digital channels.\n\nFirst CABLE TV operator in Greece, is located at Kalamaria (Thessaloniki). Hellenic Cable Networks (www.hcn.gr) among cable internet services offers DVB-C and analog TV services without the need of an external STB.\n\nIn 2006 two companies began offering television service via IPTV, namely Vivodi Telecom and On Telecoms. Both of these went out of business. \n\nThey offered television service bundled with High-speed Internet & Telephony services. Their channel offerings included local Greek networks, international stations and pay-TV networks Nova Cinema & Nova Sports, that were made available to subscribers via an agreement with Greek DTH provider NOVA.\n\nIn 2009, Greek Telecommunications giant OTE launched IPTV service called \"Conn-x TV\" which was initially available in Athens, Thessaloniki, Patras, Larisa and Iraklion. Greek broadband provider Hellas Online also launched an IPTV platform called \"hol tv (now Vodafone TV\". Vodafone TV offers all major Greek networks as well as news, sports, music and children's channels. It is also the first provider in Greece to offer HDTV as well as Video on demand.\n\nAs of 2017, the most-viewed TV channels in Greece are:\n\n"}
{"id": "2503678", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2503678", "title": "The CBS Late Movie", "text": "The CBS Late Movie\n\nThe CBS Late Movie is a CBS television series (later known as CBS Late Night) during the 1970s and 1980s. The program ran in most American television markets from 11:30 p.m. (ET/PT) until 2:30 a.m. or later, on weeknights. A single announcer (in the early years, CBS staff announcer Norm Stevens) voiced the introduction and commercial bumpers for each program, but there was no host per se, or closing credits besides those of the night's presentation. (The bumpers announcing the stars of the movie notably rotated names, two or three at a time, so more of the players would be mentioned.)\n\nThe program was launched following the cancellation of \"The Merv Griffin Show\", CBS's late-night talk show from 1969 to 1972. The show went on to have a long run in first-run syndication following CBS's cancellation.\n\n\"The CBS Late Movie\" theme music was \"So Old, So Young\" by Morton Stevens, which also served as the theme music for CBS' prime-time movies until 1978.\n\nA memorable aspect to the show's commercial breaks was the frequent appearance of public service announcements, from the Ad Council and other organizations, that often dealt with \"mature\" topics such as venereal disease, sexual and violent crimes, and abuse of hard drugs. Announcements also ran in much greater proportion than during prime time, with commercial breaks lasting longer; it was not uncommon for the second portion of the show to start at 12:05 a.m. or 12:40 a.m.\n\nUntil 1969, CBS programming had never ventured into the late hours. However, three years earlier, scheduling coordinators at many of the network's affiliates, who were programming old movies after nightly local newscasts, took notice of the dwindling stock of new films available for acquisition. In fact, a 1966 poll of CBS affiliates revealed that approximately 80% of local outlets were demanding the network \"supply a late evening entertainment show Mondays through Fridays\" to fill the growing void in newer films. Thus, CBS tentatively targeted the spring of 1968 as the premiere date for a new network late-night series. But CBS spokespersons admitted they \"did not know whether its show would be similar to others, but it [was] hopeful of devising something different\" from the usual talk format exemplified by Johnny Carson's \"Tonight Show\" on NBC or Joey Bishop, who was about to bring his own brand of chat to ABC audiences.\n\nIn 1967, at its annual convention, CBS met with 750 affiliate executives and told them the network could provide a Carson-style late-night program by the following spring—but only if 85% of station-owners would commit to airing it. Otherwise, the financing required for such a production would prove cost-prohibitive. No official poll was taken among the executives, however, and this may have been due to the fact that in 1966, when a similar offer was dangled before affiliates, only 70% of CBS stations desired a late-evening talk show. Yet in 1969, this is just what was offered to them—in the person of Merv Griffin. But despite his success as a syndicated TV phenomenon, Griffin's CBS ratings could never compete with Johnny Carson's consistently high audience numbers. And thus, in pulling the plug on Griffin in early 1972, CBS committed its late-night programming to classic feature films as well as the debut of more recent theatrical fare.\n\nThis move proved an effective ploy because two months after \"The CBS Late Movie\" premiered, the Nielsen ratings recorded that it had drawn a larger audience than \"The Tonight Show\". One CBS executive had a simple explanation for this sudden (though short-lived) good fortune: \"People just like to watch movies.\"\n\nThe \"CBS Late Movie/Late Night\" block, however, was not always cleared by every affiliate of the network; in several markets, the block was either delayed by one hour from its regularly-scheduled time (most notably in the Central and Mountain time zones), picked up by a local independent station (including those that later affiliated with the Fox network), or not seen at all in certain cities. Those stations that did not carry \"CBS Late Night\" instead broadcast movies from their own libraries and/or their own lineup of off-network syndicated sitcoms, drama reruns and first-run syndication products.\n\nA large factor in the programming decisions of many CBS affiliates electing not to clear \"CBS Late Night\" (or delaying it) was due to head-to-head competition with NBC's \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\", and starting in 1980, ABC News' \"Nightline\". ABC themselves went with a similar format to \"CBS Late Night\", with \"Wide World of Entertainment\", which later gave way to ABC Late Night, which consisted of reruns of that network's prime-time series and original movies. Preemptions and delays of the block by CBS affiliates increased during the 1980s, and into the early 1990s, as the syndication market began to grow more, and several stations deciding it would be more financially beneficial to air syndicated programming, thus keeping all advertising revenue for themselves. The debut of \"The Pat Sajak Show\" in January 1989 gained some affiliates back to the \"CBS Late Night\" lineup; however, some CBS affiliates elected to air \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" instead; in the case of CBS' Chicago station, WBBM-TV, both shows aired back-to-back after the late newscasts.\n\nIt was not until 1993, when the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" debuted, that CBS' late night programming (excluding \"Nightwatch/Up to the Minute\") was cleared across the entire network.\n\nFirst airing on February 14, 1972, \"The CBS Late Movie\" initially ran titles from a new package of MGM films that had not been previously televised. These included the Richard Chamberlain courtroom drama \"Twilight of Honor\" (1963), the original version of the sci-fi classic \"Village of the Damned\" (1960), Sidney Lumet's prisoner-of-war entry \"The Hill\" (1965), as well as two installments from the Margaret Rutherford-Miss Marple series—\"Murder Most Foul\" (1964) and \"Murder at the Gallop\" (1963). CBS's new anthology also offered packages of 1950's Warner Bros. and MGM films that, up until then, had been run only on local and independent stations but never on a network. These included the Burt Lancaster medieval action-picture \"The Flame and the Arrow\" (1950), the Randolph Scott western \"Fort Worth\" (1951), and the Richard Widmark military drama \"Take the High Ground!\" (1953). But Warners also made available a new package to viewers that showcased the TV premieres of Visconti's controversial anti-Fascist work \"The Damned\" (1969), the Beau Bridges outback adventure \"Adam's Woman\" (1969) and the Hammer-horror Christopher Lee entry, \"Dracula Has Risen from the Grave\" (1969).\n\nAs mentioned above, the first few weeks of \"The CBS Late Movie\" proved a winner with late-night television audiences. Here is the lineup of feature films that initially drew viewers away from Johnny Carson and the rest of CBS's late-night competition:\n\nAs the graph above indicates, films that had never before been shown on television proliferated during \"The CBS Late Movie\"s first couple of weeks. But later on in this period, older films that had been run previously on local stations began to increase in number. This may help explain the decline in audience that occurred a few months after the program's initial telecasts.\n\nAlso televised during \"The CBS Late Movie\"s first five years were repeats of made-for-TV movies previously seen on CBS and other networks (including some that first appeared as an \"ABC Movie of the Week\"), and movies not well-suited for prime time due to content. (Violence was often the main factor, with true crime stories and police drama, and occasionally controversial subject matter, or strong suspense, horror, or sci-fi themes.) Among these were \"The Abominable Dr. Phibes\", its sequel \"Dr. Phibes Rises Again\", and \"Theatre of Blood\" (all three of which starred Vincent Price), \"Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde\", \"The Valley of Gwangi\", \"7 Faces of Dr. Lao\", \"The Creeping Flesh\" (with the horror team of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee), \"Asylum\", \"Baron Blood\", \"Frogs\", the killer-rats-on-the-loose film \"Willard\" and its sequel \"Ben\".\n\nRichard Burton's \"Doctor Faustus\", \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\", and The Monkees' \"Head\" made their network television debut on this series, as did such lower-budget schlock horror films as \"The Giant Spider Invasion\" and \"Night of the Lepus\", the latter of which featured giant rabbits on the loose, becoming a source of embarrassment for one of its stars, \"Star Trek\" actor DeForest Kelley, who refused to discuss the film later in interviews.\n\nWell-known theatrical movies were also occasionally featured, such as the 1951 \"Show Boat\" (which had made its network TV debut on NBC in 1972, and was shown on CBS as both a Thanksgiving and Fourth of July special), the David Lean \"Great Expectations\" (1946), and a severely edited 75-minute version of the David Lean \"Oliver Twist\" (1948). Some films were seen in two parts over two nights, such as \"The Dirty Dozen\" and \"Grand Prix\". Another older film that was featured was the 1939 version of the Sherlock Holmes story \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\", starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce.\n\nIn 1975, repeats of episodes from the \"NBC Mystery Movie\" were added to the mix; the first of these was \"Banacek\", which made its \"CBS Late Movie\" debut on January 7, 1975. However, these episodes were sometimes cut to fit into the 60-minute program frame (excluding time for commercials and public service announcements), especially on nights that they were paired up with another 60-minute drama.\n\nBut not all evenings were devoted to reruns of television serials, for in the summer of 1976, classic British films enjoyed a short revival on \"The CBS Late Movie\". These included the Nigel Patrick mystery \"Sapphire\" (1959), Carol Reed's I.R.A. drama \"Odd Man Out\" (1947), and the Powell and Pressburger fantasy, \"Stairway to Heaven\" (1946).\n\nAfter 1976, the show also featured back-to-back reruns of different one-hour television series, some popular (\"Barnaby Jones\", \"Kojak\"), some lesser known (\"\", \"Black Sheep Squadron\", \"Dan August\", \"Harry O\"), and some originally made for British television (\"The Avengers\" and \"The New Avengers\", \"Return of the Saint\", \"Thriller\"). Repeats of several of the network's situation comedies were also shown in rotation during the 1970s and early 1980s, including \"The Jeffersons\", \"M*A*S*H\", \"Alice\", \"Archie Bunker's Place\" and \"WKRP in Cincinnati\".\n\nThe original series \"Behind the Screen\" was part of \"CBS Late Night\" from October 1981 to January 1982.\nThe \"Late Movie\"s time slot was also at times taken over by tape-delayed sports events, such as NBA playoffs and finals games.\n\nTV movies from other networks (\"Cage Without a Key\", \"Something for Joey\", \"Birth of The Beatles\") began to appear during the 1980s, and in 1985 the series was retooled as \"CBS Late Night\". The expansion of cable and satellite television during the 1980s took over much of the show's movie fare, and it became mostly a place for repeats of \"Magnum, P.I.\" and other popular CBS shows. \"Night Heat,\" a production of Canada's CTV network, also aired on \"CBS Late Night\". \"Adderly\", \"Hot Shots\" and \"Diamonds\", other Canadian-filmed shows, later appeared. In 1987, CBS aired an Americanized version of the BBC's long running pop music show, \"Top of the Pops\", hosted by Nia Peeples and featuring some performances from the BBC version of the program, alongside those taped in Hollywood. The show was presented on late Friday nights, and lasted almost a year.\n\nIn 1989, \"CBS Late Night\" was replaced by \"The Pat Sajak Show\". A year later, \"CBS Late Night\" returned after \"The Pat Sajak Show\" was shortened from 90 to 60 minutes in February 1990 and then cancelled altogether on April 13, 1990. During the same two-month time-span, \"CBS Late Night\" also televised reruns of Patrick McGoohan's classic spy series, \"The Prisoner\" (1967-68). The network also continued to show reruns of other old prime-time shows such as \"Wiseguy\" and shows from other networks including Fox's \"21 Jump Street\" and NBC's \"Stingray\". The line-up also featured original programming; for example, there was \"Overtime... with Pat O'Brien\" as well as \"The Kids in the Hall\" and \"The Midnight Hour\".\n\nIn March 1991, CBS retooled their late night by airing original series under a new umbrella title of \"Crimetime After Primetime\"; new shows included, but were not limited to, \"Silk Stalkings\", \"Tropical Heat\" and \"Dark Justice\".\n\nBy that fall, CBS added two original game shows to the start of the late night lineup; the first to premiere in September 1991 was \"Personals\", hosted by Michael Burger, paired a month later with \"Night Games\", starring comedian Jeff Marder and Playboy Playmate Luann Lee as announcer. Both were adult-oriented game shows that followed a format similar to \"The Dating Game\". \"Night Games\" was canceled in June 1992, replaced by \"A Perfect Score\", a similar show also hosted by Marder. Both \"Score\" and \"Personals\" continued until December 1992, to be replaced by an earlier \"Crimetime After Primetime\" until being dropped for \"Late Show with David Letterman\" by the following August.\n\nCBS revived the concept of running late night crime and police procedural reruns, using the umbrella title \"CBS Summer Showcase\", in the summer of 2015 between the May 20 finale of \"Late Show with David Letterman\" and the September 8 premiere of \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\", and the restoration of the Ed Sullivan Theater between those dates. From May 21, 2015 until September 7, 2015, the network aired reruns of police procedurals and scripted dramas in the \"Late Show\" slot beginning with \"The Mentalist\" (May 21–June 5) and continued throughout the summer with \"Hawaii Five-0\" (June 8–12, July 27–31), \"\" (June 15–19, August 17–21), \"Elementary\" (June 22–26), \"Blue Bloods\" (June 29-July 5), \"The Good Wife\" (July 6–10, August 24–28), \"\" (July 13–17), \"NCIS\" (July 20–24, September 7) \"Scorpion\" (August 3–7), \"\" (August 10–14) and \"Madam Secretary\" (August 31-September 4).\n\nThe network dismissed concerns that it could hurt the ratings of \"The Late Late Show with James Corden\", which follows the \"Late Show\". Those fears were not realized, as \"The Late Late Show\" received ratings consistent with what it had garnered previously, and \"Summer Showcase\" itself usually maintained Letterman's ratings share, even beating first-run episodes of ABC's \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" in the ratings.\n\n\"The Late Late Show\" used the lead-ins as an opportunity to mock talk shows such as \"Talking Dead\", opening selected episodes with sketches such as \"Talking Mentalist\" and \"Talking Hawaii Five-0\" to discuss the rerun that had just aired. Similarly, during the premiere of Colbert's \"Late Show\", CBS CEO Leslie Moonves was shown operating a lever he could use to switch back to \"The Mentalist\" reruns if he was dissatisfied with the new program.\n\n\n"}

Various enemies, including slimes, ghosts, and wizards, appear on each floor, and any contact with them results in death.\n\nKi has no weapons, and thus can not damage or defeat any of the enemies. Her only abilities are to dash and jump. As long as the player holds the jump button down, Ki can rise indefinitely into the air. However, contact with the ceiling or dashing against a wall will cause her to drop to the ground and become stunned for several seconds. This mechanic of floating and getting stunned from bumping against the walls or ceiling is similar to the 1983 Williams vector arcade game, \"Major Havoc\".\n\nMany of the levels consist of puzzles in which the player must carefully regulate the height and direction of Ki's jumps. Each stage in the game contains one or more treasure chest, which hold various items. Although many of the items bestow helpful abilities, the effects only last for the floor on which they were found.\n\nAfter completing the game, players can gain access to forty bonus stages. These stages contain cameos from the \"Pac-Man\" ghosts and the enemies from \"Dig Dug\".\n"}
{"id": "4933875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4933875", "title": "Tim Moore (comedian)", "text": "Tim Moore (comedian)\n\nTim Moore (December 9, 1887 – December 13, 1958) was an American vaudevillian and comic actor of the first half of the 20th century. He gained his greatest recognition in the starring role of George \"Kingfish\" Stevens in the CBS TV's \"The Amos 'n' Andy Show\". He proudly stated, \"I've made it a point never to tell a joke on stage that I couldn't tell in front of my mother.\"\n\nMoore was born Harry Roscoe Moore in Rock Island, Illinois, one of 13 children of Harry and Cynthia Moore. His father was a night watchman at a brewery. Tim Moore dropped out of grammar school to work at odd jobs in town and even danced for pennies in the streets with his friend, Romeo Washburn.\n\nIn 1898, Moore and Washburn went into vaudeville in an act called \"Cora Miskel and Her Gold Dust Twins.\" It was booked by agents and travelled through the United States and even Great Britain. By 1904, the act had performed with the Barnum & Bailey Circus. As Moore and Washburn grew older, the act became less effective and Miss Miskel sent them back to their parents in Rock Island. Shortly after this, Moore joined the medicine show of \"Doctor Mick\" (Charles S. Mick), who sold a patented quack remedy called \"Pru-ri-ta\". Doctor Mick travelled through the Midwestern states, with songs and dances provided by Moore and four Kickapoo Indians. The young man also worked in a carnival sideshow and gave guided tours as a \"native\" tour guide in Hawaii.\n\nMoore left Doctor Mick, first to become a stableboy and later a jockey. He also tried his hand as a boxer. He returned to performing about 1906, with a troupe of minstrels called \"The Rabbit's Foot Company.\" By 1908, he was back in vaudeville and had met and married his first wife, Hester. They performed as a team, \"The Moores - Tim & Hester\", appearing in the United States and abroad. In 1910, the couple was part of an act called the Four Moores. They next performed together in \"Georgia Sunflowers,\" a minstrel show that played the southern vaudeville circuit. The Moores drew glowing reviews, Hester for her singing and Tim for his comedy. By 1914, both Moores were co-stars of an act that was billed as \"Tim Moore and Tom Delaney & Co.\". Tim played the tuba and Hester played drums as part of a band. Moore's own stock company was responsible for all aspects of it. The couple toured China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the Fiji Islands and Hawaii with a vaudeville troupe. The marriage ended in divorce in 1915, and in September, Moore married a vaudeville actress named Gertrude Brown. After more than a year on the road in vaudeville in the United States, the Hawaiian Islands, Australia and New Zealand, he returned to boxing as \"Young Klondike\", training in New Zealand. He fought there and in Australia, England, and Scotland. Before this, Moore fought as \"Kid Klondike\" in the US, with Jack Johnson and Sam Langford as some of his opponents. Moore also made his way into films by 1915, playing the part of an egotistical musician in \"His Inspiration\". While Tim and Gertie were entertaining in New Zealand, a story in \"The Evening Post\" from May 28, 1917, went on to say, \"Another \"star\" item will be that of Tim and Gertie Moore, who have earned a big reputation in America, and were booked for Fuller's direct from the well-known Orpheum circuit.\" Moore became well known for his one-man presentation of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", where he would play the role of both Simon Legree and Uncle Tom, applying white chalk to half his face, and burnt cork to the other. Moore literally took his one man act into the street of San Jose, California, for the sale of War Stamps in 1918.\n\nHaving made $141,000 with his fists, in 1921 Moore and his wife returned to performing full-time in vaudeville. He formed his Chicago Follies troupe and was a favorite on the Theater Owners Bookers Association vaudeville circuit during the \"Roaring Twenties\" period. In 1923, Moore and his wife co-starred with Sandy Burns, Fannetta Burns, Walter Long, and Bobby Smart in a silent film comedy, \"His Great Chance,\" directed by Ben Strasser (North State Film Corp.). The following year, the Moores toured vaudeville together in \"Aces and Queens\". Subsequently, he went on tour as one of the stars of producer Edward E. Daley's \"black and white musical comedy sensation\", \"Rarin' to Go\", for three seasons on the Columbia Burlesque Wheel (1925, 1926 and 1927 editions).\nIn June 1925, Tim Moore made his Broadway debut as the star of \"Lucky Sambo\" (based on \"Aces and Queens'). However, the show closed after only a few performances. He was a success in burlesque in the mid 1920s with the hit show \"Rarin' to Go\", followed by a return to vaudeville in 1927 with \"The Southland Revue\". Moore wrote all of his own material and also did some writing for other performers; a Moore skit called, \"Not a Fit Night for Man nor Beast\", was bought by W.C. Fields. He also did some writing for the radio show of the Two Black Crows comedy team. Moore was brought to New York to sign a writing contract but before this was done, Charles Mack of the team was killed in an auto accident, thus ending the act. Moore wrote sketches which became part of Lew Leslie's \"Blackbirds\" revues as well.\n\nIn 1928, Moore took time off from his vaudeville bookings to try his luck once more on the Great White Way – Broadway. This time he met with enormous success as the star comedian of Lew Leslie's hit musical comedy revue, the \"Blackbirds of 1928\". Moore's co-stars were singers Adelaide Hall and Aida Ward and renowned tap dancer Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson. The hit musical scored high in Paris and London as well as on the road throughout the states. In 1931, Moore and his then vaudeville straight man, Andrew Tribble, performed one of their funniest routines in Oscar Micheaux's first talking picture, \"The Darktown Revue\". After a disagreement with Lew Leslie, Moore starred in two unsuccessful Broadway revues for other producers, \"Fast and Furious\" (1931), and \"The Blackberries of 1932\". In the former, Moore wrote some of the skits along with his friend and co-star Zora Neale Hurston. Moore and fellow comedian \"Morton\" (i.e., Mantan Moreland) left the show in April 1932, refusing to perform what were termed \"dirty lines\". Needing each other, he and Leslie patched up their differences and Moore resumed his position as star comedian in the \"Blackbirds\" revues of 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, and 1939. Politics played a role in the demise of the 1936 edition of the \"Blackbirds\", causing the London run to be shut down. At the time the troupe was booked in the United Kingdom, King Edward VIII had just abdicated the British throne for love of American Wallis Simpson. There was a wave of anti-Americanism, with women picketing performances of the \"Blackbirds\", carrying signs disparaging American women. In this last of the \"Blackbirds\" (1939), the principal singing star was Lena Horne. Moore's last Broadway show was \"Harlem Cavalcade\" (1942), produced by Ed Sullivan and Noble Sissle. During the late 1930s and early 1940s, Moore was one of the top comedians headlining at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. He also performed on radio as a dramatic actor.\n\nIn 1946, he starred as Bumpsie in the musical comedy film, \"Boy! What a Girl!\". He made some appearances on Ed Sullivan's television show, \"Toast of the Town\", and at the Apollo Theater; Moore then retired from show business. His wife Gertrude having died in 1934, Moore settled down with his third wife, Benzonia Davis Moore (1889–1956), in his home town of Rock Island, working the night shift at the Servus Rubber company, where boots and shoes were made. The couple was married in 1941 and initially made their home in Baltimore.\n\nIn 1950, Moore was recommended by his old vaudeville friend, Flournoy Miller, for the role of George \"Kingfish\" Stevens, a role which was voiced on radio by white actor Freeman Gosden. He was called out of retirement by the Columbia Broadcasting System to star in a new television adaptation of \"Amos 'n' Andy\". As the radio series had developed in prior years, the scheming but henpecked Kingfish had become the central focus of most of the plots. In the television version, Moore played the character more broadly, with louder and more forceful delivery and a distinctive Georgia drawl, exaggerated for comic effect. Moore's Kingfish dominated the calmer and soft-spoken \"Amos 'n' Andy\" characters. Early in his career, Moore had developed a \"con-man\" routine he used for many years while in vaudeville; re-working some aspects of his old act produced the television character Kingfish.\n\nMoore was very popular in the show and for the first time in his career became a national celebrity as well as the first African American to win stardom on television. When leaving a train in Albuquerque to buy some Native American pottery, the proprietor recognized him immediately, saying, \"You, you Kingfish.\" This was the first time it happened in Moore's 52 years in show business. The show aired on prime-time TV from June 1951 to June 1953. Although quite popular, the series was eventually canceled due to complaints about ethnic stereotyping. Shortly after the television show left the air, there were plans to turn it into a vaudeville act in August 1953, with Moore, Williams, and Childress playing the same characters. It is not known if this was ever realized. After the series was canceled, it was shown in syndication until 1966 when increasing condemnation and pressure from the NAACP persuaded the show's owners (CBS, which still owns the copyrights) to withdraw it from further exhibition. It was resurrected in the early days of home videotape through public domain video dealers who had acquired episodes from collectors of used 16mm TV prints, although the copyright was never in the public domain. Illegally produced copies continue to be sold over the internet. The series itself would not be seen on a regular basis again until independent network Rejoice TV began re-airing episodes in 2012.\n\nMany of the episodes revolved around Moore's Kingfish character, supported by Ernestine Wade as his level-headed, emotionally strong wife Sapphire, and Amanda Randolph as his openly aggressive mother-in-law, without the participation of Amos or Andy. These Kingfish-only episodes were originally produced as a spinoff series, \"The Adventures of Kingfish\", which made its debut on CBS on January 4, 1955 but lasted only a few episodes. When the \"Amos 'n' Andy\" half-hours went into syndication, the \"Adventures of Kingfish\" shows were added to the syndicated package under the \"Amos 'n' Andy\" series title.\n\nIn 1956, Moore and his fellow cast mates Spencer Williams, Alvin Childress and Lillian Randolph with her choir, tried a tour of personal appearances as \"The TV Stars of \"Amos 'n' Andy\"\". The tour was halted by CBS, who viewed this as infringing on their exclusivity. Moore, and fellow cast members Williams, Childress and Lee, were able to perform for one night in 1957 in Windsor, Ontario, since legal action had not been taken against them in Canada.\n\nMoore married his last wife Vivian Cravens (1912–1988) eight months after Benzonia's death; they had been performing as a comedy team for some time before marrying in 1957. This marriage won him considerable publicity thanks to the \"Roast Beef Scandal\" of January 1958. Moore fired a gunshot in his home because of his \"mooching in-laws\" (stepson, stepdaughter, and her husband) when he found that the last of the New Year's roast beef had been eaten by them. Moore related, \"These free-loaders have eaten everything in the house. My wife protects them and every time we talk about it, we get into an argument. The argument got a little loud and the next thing I knew, the big boy (his stepson Hubbard) jumped out of his chair. I ran upstairs and got out my old pistol. I didn't want to hit anybody.\"\n\nWhen the police arrived at the home, Moore, pistol still in his belt, told them, \"I'm the old Kingfish, boys. I'm the one you want. I fired that shot. I didn't want to hit anyone, although I could have. Anyway, you should have seen the in-laws scatter when I fired that gun.\" The shot Moore fired hit the china cabinet; he was arrested and charged with assault with a deadly weapon, with police calling him the \"funniest prisoner in police history.\" Moore was initially ordered held on $1,000 bond; the judge changed his mind and released Moore on his own recognizance. Tim and his wife reconciled, with Vivian's pleading for the charges to be dropped. Moore entered a not guilty plea before the case went to trial on March 24. He received a $100 fine and a year's probation as his sentence.\n\nWhen the story broke, local television personality and columnist Paul Coates invited Tim Moore to appear on his KTTV television show; Moore explained the situation in two guest appearances. Coates was promptly taken to task for Moore's appearances on his show by Stanley Robertson, a journalist for the African-American newspaper, the \"Los Angeles Sentinel\", calling Moore \"disgraceful\" and labeling the two shows with Moore as \"television's darkest hour.\" Coates replied to his critic in his January 29, 1958 \"Los Angeles Times\" column, calling Moore \"a pretty wonderful, sincere man\" and saying he strongly resented Robertson's attack on him.\n\nBecause of the \"Roast Beef Scandal,\" Moore was once more in demand and even received a testimonial tribute dinner from the Friars Club of Beverly Hills, and appearing on \"The Tonight Show\" with Jack Paar. The publicity also won him an extended performance engagement at the legendary Mocambo nightclub.\n\nMoore died at age 71 on December 13, 1958 of pulmonary tuberculosis in Los Angeles, four days after his birthday. There was no money to pay for his hospital care or for his funeral, Moore having received his final $65.00 residual payment from \"Amos 'n' Andy\" in January 1958. At one time, Moore had made $700 per week.\n\nAfter a large funeral at Mt. Sinai Baptist Church, he was buried at Rosedale Cemetery. At the funeral service, 10,000 fans and mourners passed his open coffin; attendance was star-studded and included Groucho Marx, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Louis Armstrong, Tony Curtis, Sidney Poitier, Charlie Barnet, Noble Sissle, Erskine Hawkins, Louis Prima, Freeman F. Gosden, Charles Correll, Spencer Williams, Jr., Alvin Childress, Ernestine Wade, Amanda Randolph, Johnny Lee, Lillian Randolph, Sammy Davis, Jr., Eddie \"Rochester\" Anderson, Andy Razaf, Clarence Muse, Roy Glenn, Mantan Moreland, Pigmeat Markham, Willie Bryant, Earl Grant. Sammy Davis, Jr. later related that Frank Sinatra organized the effort to pay Tim Moore's funeral expenses. Moore's grave remained unmarked from the time of his burial until 1983; fellow comedians Redd Foxx and George Kirby raised funds for a headstone. There is now one marking the graves of Moore and his wife, Vivian, who died in 1988.\n\nPaying tribute to one of its favorite sons, the Rock Island Public Library held \"Tim Moore Day\" July 16, 2008. Moore's relatives in the area participated by sharing their memories of his life and work.\n\nIn spite of his achievement as the first major African American television star, Moore is still not honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "380286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=380286", "title": "Wit", "text": "Wit\n\nWit is a form of intelligent humour, the ability to say or write things that are clever and usually funny. A wit is a person skilled at making clever and funny remarks. Forms of wit include the quip, repartee, and wisecrack.\n\nAs in the wit of Dorothy Parker's set, the Algonquin Round Table, witty remarks may be intentionally cruel (as in many epigrams), and perhaps more ingenious than funny.\n\nA quip is an observation or saying that has some wit but perhaps descends into sarcasm, or otherwise is short of a point, and a witticism also suggests the diminutive. Repartee is the wit of the quick answer and capping comment: the snappy comeback and neat retort. (Wilde: \"I wish I'd said that.\" Whistler: \"You will, Oscar, you will\".)\n\nWit in poetry is characteristic of metaphysical poetry as a style, and was prevalent in the time of English playwright Shakespeare, who admonished pretension with the phrase \"Better a witty fool than a foolish wit\". It may combine word play with conceptual thinking, as a kind of verbal display requiring attention, without intending to be laugh-aloud funny; in fact wit can be a thin disguise for more poignant feelings that are being versified. English poet John Donne is the representative of this style of poetry.\n\nMore generally, one's wits are one's intellectual powers of all types. Native wit — meaning the wits with which one is born — is closely synonymous with common sense. To live by one's wits is to be an opportunist, but not always of the scrupulous kind. To have one's wits about one is to be alert and capable of quick reasoning. To be at the end of one's wits (\"I'm at my wits' end\") is to be immensely frustrated.\n\n\n"}
