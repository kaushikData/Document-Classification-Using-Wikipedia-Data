It was also published in book format.\n\nThe text reels through dozens of ways that young men facing conscription during the Vietnam War could avoid service. Kupferberg leaves no societal more unscathed in this anti-war pamphlet, which is considered one of the most notable antiwar publications. Donald L. Simons, in his autobiography \"I Refuse: Memories of a Vietnam War Objector\", wrote \"It is not possible to determine how many men successfully fooled the system, but stories of attempts, and how to do it, became part of the Sixties culture. The most famous examples were Arlo Guthrie's classic folk song, \"Alice's Restaurant\", and the book, \"1001 Ways to Beat the Draft\".\n\nThe pamphlet was published originally by Oliver Layton Press, New York; Kupferberg also printed it under his publishing label, Birth Press, and an illustrated version from Grove Press came out in 1967. Kupferberg published other humorous lists in the same format, including \"1001 Ways to Live Without Working\" and \"1001 Ways to Make Love\". \n\nAn excerpt was included in Viking Press' \"Portable Beat Reader\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3526140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3526140", "title": "Crazy Frog", "text": "Crazy Frog\n\nCrazy Frog, originally known as The Annoying Thing, is a Swedish CGI-animated character created in 2003 by actor and playwright Erik Wernquist. Marketed by the ringtone provider Jamba! (later known as Jamster), he was originally created to accompany a sound effect produced by Australian singer and songwriter Sav Martino and Daniel Malmedahl in 1997 while attempting to imitate the sound of a two-stroke engine.\n\nThe Crazy Frog spawned a worldwide hit single with a remix of \"Axel F\", which reached the number one spot in Turkey, New Zealand, Australia and most of Europe. The subsequent album \"Crazy Frog Presents Crazy Hits\" and second single \"Popcorn\" also enjoyed worldwide chart success, and a second album entitled \"Crazy Frog Presents More Crazy Hits\" was released in 2006. The Crazy Frog has also spawned a range of merchandise and toys, and two video games.\n\nIn 1997, 17-year-old Gothenburg student Daniel Malmedahl recorded himself imitating the noises produced by a two stroke engine. He posted this on a website and caught the attention of a Swedish television researcher, who convinced Daniel to perform the sound live on air. After it debuted on television, recordings of his performance began appearing on file sharing networks and various websites under the filename \"2TAKTARE.MP3\" (\"Tvåtaktare\" is Swedish for \"two stroker\").\n\nThe sound was adopted as the sound of a Formula One car as early as 2001 in the form of \"Deng Deng Form\" and later \"The Insanity Test\" both of which were a static background of a Ferrari Formula One car accompanied by the sound.\n\nIn late 2003, another Swede, Erik Wernquist, encountered the sound effect and, not knowing about the previous incarnations of the sound, was inspired to create the 3D animated character he named \"The Annoying Thing\" to accompany it. Wernquist worked on the first animation in his spare time using the LightWave 3D modeling application, and the whole process took between 6 and 8 weeks. In October 2003 he posted it on his website and on the CGTalk forum.\n\nThe animation was a popular attraction at Erik's website, but the sound was credited to \"Anonymous\". Eventually, word reached Malmedahl that his impressions had been used in a now well-known animation. He contacted Wernquist, apparently giving an impromptu performance to confirm his claims. Wernquist was convinced, and gave credit to Malmedahl for his creation.\n\nThe animation received attention through filesharing and word of mouth, and when Ringtone Europe and Jamster België (now both merged into Jamba!) got wind of this, realizing the monetary possibilities through capitalizing on the underground cult-status they licensed the rights to the creation, renaming it \"Crazy Frog\" and starting to market it in mid-2004.\n\nIn an interview with HitQuarters, Wernquist expressed his displeasure at the choice of name:\n\nOn 1 July 2005, UK-based publishers Digital Jesters announced that they had acquired the rights to the video game licence for the Crazy Frog. \"Crazy Frog Racer (featuring The Annoying Thing)\", released in December 2005 on PlayStation 2 and PC as a racing game. A year later in 2006 a sequel was released, entitled \"Crazy Frog Racer 2\". Both were extremely panned by critics.\n\nA string of Crazy Frog merchandise was released in the UK.\n\nIn 2005, the German production company The League of Good People was in talks with broadcasters about a TV series based on Crazy Frog.\n\nThe Crazy Frog toured Australia in late 2005, beginning in Perth on 4 December and continuing through other major capital cities. He made appearances at numerous shopping centres and major hospitals around the country.\n\nIn 2007, the Animation World Network wrote in connection with \"The Annoying Thing\" that there was a \"planned feature film\" to \"be completed by the end of next year\" into an animated feature film.\n\nIn 2017, a documentary called \"The Not So Crazy Frog\" was released, originally made in 2012.\n\nIn 2018, a trademark claim by Kaktus Films, the original owners alongside Erik Wernquist, that had music listed as one of many rights.\n\nThe Crazy Frog was broadcast for the first time on Belgian Television in mid-2004, though was named \"The Annoying Thing\" There it was marketed as Albert Motàr.\n\n\"Axel F\" (a remix of the 1980s Harold Faltermeyer song produced by the German band Resource), was released on 23 May 2005 and became one of the most successful singles of the year 2005. The single debuted at number one in the UK, remaining there for four weeks, and it was released on the debut album \"Crazy Frog Presents Crazy Hits\".\n\nIn February 2005, viewers submitted a number of complaints to the United Kingdom's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) regarding Jamster!'s advertising campaign, complaining that Crazy Frog appeared to have a visible penis and scrotum. Some parents complained that this made inappropriate viewing for children. There were also complaints regarding the frequency with which the advertisement appeared on television, reportedly up to twice an hour across most of the day, with some channels showing it more than once per commercial break.\n\nThe ASA did not uphold the complaints, pointing out that the advert was already classified as inappropriate for airing during children's television programmes as it contained a premium rate telephone number, and that it was the broadcasters' decision how often an advertisement should be shown. Jamster! voluntarily censored the character's genital area (via pixelization) in later broadcasts of its advertisements. Similar action occurred in Australia, with similar results.\n\nIn April 2005, television viewers complained about misleading advertisements produced by Jamba!, trading as Jamster! and RingtoneKing. Viewers felt that it was not made sufficiently clear that they were subscribing to a service, rather than paying a one-time fee for their ringtone. The complaints were upheld; the full adjudication (PDF) is available online.\n\nIn May 2005, viewers inundated the ASA with new complaints regarding the continuous airing of the latest Crazy Frog advertisements. The intensity of the advertising was unprecedented in British television history. According to \"The Guardian\", Jamster bought 73,716 spots across all TV channels in May alone — an average of nearly 2,378 slots daily — at a cost of about £8 million, just under half of which was spent on ITV. 87% of the population saw the Crazy Frog adverts an average of 26 times, 15% of the adverts appeared twice during the same advertising break and 66% were in consecutive ad breaks. An estimated 10% of the population saw the advert more than 60 times. This led to many members of the population finding the Crazy Frog, as its original name suggests, immensely irritating.\n\nAs the authority had already adjudicated on the matter and confirmed the matter was not within its remit, the unusual step was taken of adding a notice to the ASA's online and telephone complaints system informing viewers that Jamster!-related complaints should be directed towards the broadcaster or the regulator, Ofcom.\n\nOn 21 September 2005, the ASA ruled that the Crazy Frog, along with other Jamba ringtone advertisements, could not be shown before 9 pm. This adjudication was revised on 25 January 2006, maintaining the 'upheld' decision but revising the wording of one of the points.\n\nIn March 2005, anti-virus vendors discovered the \"codice_1\" computer virus (a contraction of Crazy Frog), which spreads through file-sharing networks and MSN Messenger, exploiting the \"Crazy Frog\"'s notoriety with a promise of an animation depicting his demise.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23875475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23875475", "title": "Diamond Tooth Lil", "text": "Diamond Tooth Lil\n\nDiamond Tooth Lil was an American cultural figure popular in the early 20th century as an icon of wealth and libertine burlesque. Several individuals called themselves \"Diamond Lil\" or \"Diamond Tooth\", creating an amalgamated legacy clouded by myth. These individuals include a vaudeville entertainer in the Yukon during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush, a madam in the American West during the early 1900s, and the titular character of Mae West's \"Diamond Lil\", who embodied these traits and popularized the name in the 1920s.\n\nMultiple women of the American West have used the name \"Diamond Tooth\" and \"Diamond Lil\". In the case of the two most prominent, historians have often confused the lives of Honora Ornstein and Evelyn Hildegard, who both went by the name Diamond Lil around the turn of the 20th century, both emigrants from Austria, with similar ages, careers in entertainment, and diamond-inset teeth. They did differ, however, in where they lived: Ornstein in the Klondike and Seattle, and Hildegard in California and Nevada. Lil became known as enigmatic figure, and has been variously attributed as a \"dance hall girl, gambler, prostitute, or madam who smoked cigars and carried a gun\"—a legacy clouded with myth. By the 1920s, Diamond Tooth Lil was a household name.\n\nHonora Ornstein was born in Austria-Hungary in 1882 to a Jewish family. She also used the name Lilian Orinstein. She became famous during the Klondike Gold Rush in the Yukon before the turn of the century on the Pantages vaudeville circuit, where she was a star entertainer for the region's spendthrift \"sourdough\" gold seekers. A nearby gambling house owner said that Lil spent three or four years there. Her stage name, Diamond Tooth Lil, is based on her several diamond-inset dental fillings, including ones in her front and canine teeth. She also collected and wore other diamond-studded jewelry, including a white gold snake bracelet studded with 125 real diamonds that scaled the length of her arm. Lil was also known to have come from a wealthy family prior to her time in the Klondike. Around 1908, she had moved to Seattle and was remembered for ostentatiously throwing money during a Klondikers' parade. Shortly before she divorced her last husband around 1928, she lived in an apartment she had purchased in Seattle and inherited $150,000 from her mother, equivalent to $ in .\n\nLil made newspaper headlines in 1936 when she was committed to Western State Hospital, a psychiatric hospital in Washington, and reported as near-death. By this time, she had sold the diamonds from her teeth but was thought to still have considerable wealth—only she was unable to speak and her relatives were not in contact. Her reputation limited the market for her jewelry collection, which she struggled to sell in the 1950s. Lil's lawyer reported that her assets had been exhausted by 1961. After spending the remainder of her life in state institutions, Lil died in a Yakima, Washington, nursing home on June 18, 1975. She was buried in a simple grave and had no known relatives. \"The New York Times\" remembered Lil as a \"dance hall queen\" and \"the toast of the North\".\n\nEvelyn Fialla was also born in Austria-Hungary, in approximately 1877. Her family emigrated to the United States and settled in Youngstown, Ohio. She met Percy Hildegard when she was fourteen and eloped with him to Chicago, where she became a saloon singer. She divorced him on an unspecified date, and went on to marry several more times over the course of her life. Sources such as Ripley's Believe It Or Not! reported thirteen marriages. Hildegard herself put the number at eight. \n\nAs a traveling dancer, she worked her way from Ohio across the West to San Francisco, California. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake left the city in ruins, Hildegard moved to Goldfield, Nevada, a boomtown of the California Gold Rush. Hildegard was paid handsomely for her exceptionally popular act at the town's Northern Saloon. Though she ultimately spent less than a year in Goldfield, she quickly opened her own dance hall and had a relationship with prospector Diamondfield Jack. Hildegard was said to have won her title of Diamond Tooth Lil in a successful bet with a Reno dentist, who set a diamond in her front tooth.\n\nLil was said to have entertained and managed multiple profitable brothels across the West, including Death Valley, California, Denver, Colorado, and Boise, Idaho, where her \"Star Rooms\" in Boise had amenities including steam heating and both hot and cold water. She had reached Boise by the early 1940s. In 1944, she announced that her famous front tooth diamond would be willed to the Idaho Children's Home orphanage upon her death. By 1966, she had sold her jewelry and was penniless in California. She died at the Claremont Sanitarium of Pomona in 1967.\n\n\"Diamond Lil\", the successful Broadway play written and acted by Mae West in 1928, is assumed but not confirmed to be based on the Lils' lives. The show was later adapted into the 1933 film \"She Done Him Wrong\". West said that her inspiration for the name likely came from her father's nickname for her mother, \"Til\", short for \"Matilda\", and sometimes with her drink of choice, \"Champagne Til\". West based the character on herself and viewed Lil as an alter ego. \"The femme fatale of the Bowery\", declared \"The New York Times\" of West's Lil in the play's 1949 revival, \"bowling her leading men over one by one with her classical impersonation of a storybook strumpet\", dressed in \"some of the gaudiest finery of the century\" with a \"snaky walk, torso wriggle, stealthy eyes, frozen smile, flat, condescending voice, [and] queenly gestures\"—in all, \"a triumph of nostalgic vulgarity\". West won a lawsuit in 1966 against a Los Angeles performer for infringement of the name \"Diamond Lil\".\n"}

For most day-to-day decisions, various heuristics are used to act reasonably in the presence of uncertainty, often with little thought about its presence. However, for larger high-stakes decisions or decisions in highly public situations, decision makers may often benefit from a more systematic treatment of their decision problem, such as through quantitative analysis or decision analysis.\n\nWhen building a quantitative decision model, a model builder identifies various relevant factors, and encodes these as \"input variables\". From these inputs, other quantities, called \"result variables\", can be computed; these provide information for the decision maker. For example, in the example detailed below, the decision maker must decide how soon before a flight's schedule departure he must leave for the airport (the decision). One input variable is how long it takes to drive to the airport parking garage. From this and other inputs, the model can compute how likely it is the decision maker will miss the flight and what the net cost (in minutes) will be for various decisions.\n\nTo reach a decision, a very common practice is to ignore uncertainty. Decisions are reached through quantitative analysis and model building by simply using a \"best guess\" (single value) for each input variable. Decisions are then made on computed \"point estimates\". In many cases, however, ignoring uncertainty can lead to very poor decisions, with estimations for result variables often misleading the decision maker\n\nAn alternative to ignoring uncertainty in quantiative decision models is to explicitly encode uncertainty as part of the model. With this approach, a probability distribution is provided for each input variable, rather than a single best guess. The variance in that distribution reflects the degree of subjective uncertainty (or lack of knowledge) in the input quantity. The software tools then use methods such as Monte Carlo analysis to propagate the uncertainty to result variables, so that a decision maker obtains an explicit picture of the impact that uncertainty has on his decisions, and in many cases can make a much better decision as a result.\n\nWhen comparing the two approaches—ignoring uncertainty versus modeling uncertainty explicitly—the natural question to ask is how much difference it really makes to the quality of the decisions reached. In the 1960s, Ronald A. Howard proposed one such measure, the expected value of perfect information (EVPI), a measure of how much it would be worth to learn the \"true\" values for all uncertain input variables. While providing a highly useful measure of sensitivity to uncertainty, the EVPI does not directly capture the actual improvement in decisions obtained from explicitly representing and reasoning about uncertainty. For this, Max Henrion, in his Ph.D. thesis, introduced the \"expected value of including uncertainty\" (EVIU), the topic of this article.\n\nLet\n\nWhen not including uncertainty, the optimal decision is found using only formula_2, the expected value of the uncertain quantity. Hence, the decision \"ignoring uncertainty\" is given by:\n\nThe optimal decision taking uncertainty into account is the standard Bayes decision that maximizes expected utility:\n\nThe EVIU is the difference in expected utility between these two decisions:\n\nThe uncertain quantity \"x\" and decision variable \"d\" may each be composed of many scalar variables, in which case the spaces \"X\" and \"D\" are each vector spaces.\n\nThe diagram at right is an influence diagram for deciding how early the decision maker should leave home in order to catch a flight at the airport. The single decision, in the green rectangle, is the number of minutes that one will decide to leave prior to the plane's departure time. Four uncertain variables appear on the diagram in cyan ovals: The time required to drive from home to the airport's parking garage (in minutes), time to get from the parking garage to the gate (in minutes), the time before departure that one must be at the gate, and the loss (in minutes) incurred if the flight is missed. Each of these nodes contains a probability distribution, viz:\n\nEach of these distributions is taken to be statistically independent. The probability distribution for the first uncertain variable, \"Time_to_drive_to_airport\", with median 60 and a geometric standard deviation of 1.3, is depicted in this graph:\n\nThe model calculates the cost (the red hexagonal variable) as the number of minutes (or minute equivalents) consumed to successfully board the plane. If one arrive too late, one will miss one's plane and incur the large loss (negative utility) of having to wait for the next flight. If one arrives too early, one incurs the cost of a needlessly long wait for the flight.\n\nModels that utilize EVIU may use a utility function, or equivalently they may utilize a loss function, in which case the utility function is just the negative of the loss function. In either case, the EVIU will be positive. The main difference is just that with a loss function, the decision is made by minimizing loss rather than by maximizing utility. The example here uses a loss function, Cost.\n\nThe definitions for each of the computed variables is thus:\n\nThe following graph displays the expected value taking uncertainty into account (the smooth blue curve) to the expected utility ignoring uncertainty, graphed as a function of the decision variable.\n\nWhen uncertainty is ignored, one acts as though the flight will be made with certainty as long as one leaves at least 100 minutes before the flight, and will miss the flight with certainty if one leaves any later than that. Because one acts as if everything is certain, the optimal action is to leave exactly 100 minutes (or 100 minutes, 1 second) before the flight.\n\nWhen uncertainty is taken into account, the expected value smooths out (the blue curve), and the optimal action is to leave 140 minutes before the flight. The expected value curve, with a decision at 100 minutes before the flight, shows the expected cost when ignoring uncertainty to be 313.7 minutes, while the expected cost when one leaves 140 minute before the flight is 151 minutes. The difference between these two is the EVIU:\n\nIn other words, if uncertainty is explicitly taken into account when the decision is made, an average savings of 162.7 minutes will be realized.\n\nIn the context of centralized linear-quadratic control, with additive uncertainty in the equation of evolution but no uncertainty about coefficient values in that equation, the optimal solution for the control variables taking into account the uncertainty is the same as the solution ignoring uncertainty. This property, which gives a zero expected value of including uncertainty, is called certainty equivalence. \n\nBoth EVIU and EVPI compare the expected value of the Bayes' decision with another decision made without uncertainty. For EVIU this other decision is made when the uncertainty is \"ignored\", although it is there, while for EVPI this other decision is made after the uncertainty is \"removed\" by obtaining perfect information about \"x\".\n\nThe EVPI is the expected cost of being uncertain about \"x\", while the EVIU is the additional expected cost of assuming that one is certain.\n\nThe EVIU, like the EVPI, gives expected value in terms of the units of the utility function.\n\n"}

{"id": "29527423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29527423", "title": "Film censorship in South Korea", "text": "Film censorship in South Korea\n\nLike most other developed countries, South Korea’s film industry has had a great influence on the public. As films can affect the public with their great popularity and their vivid audio-visual effect, it has such influence that alarms the government to place strict regulations which the films must follow in order to be viewed by the public. This control on the film industry and filmmakers resulted in film censorship. The censorship often changed depends on the government's attitude toward the social structure and films. Thus, the filmmakers could not criticize the government in any aspect, instead, they could only promote and support the government. Consequently, the filmmakers were not allowed to freely express their creativity as well as their ideas and thoughts, and these restrictions lead to the decline of the film industry. There are 2 major time periods where film censorship strongly impacted on the growth of the film industry in South Korea, namely, the period during Colonial Korea which was under Japanese Rule (Japanese occupation) and the period when the film industry were under heavily surveillance from the new military regime.\n\nFilm was first introduced during the Chosun dynasty (1897–1910) and it gained popularity along with superfluous positive outcomes from its viewers. As a result, it could be the great introduction of Western culture and high technology as well. However, when Japan took over the country, they started to take control of the film industry by establishing film censorship regulations which prohibited to make scenes that might damage image of the Japanese Empire. And also, films that deterred war related objective or praised America were prohibited.\nThe film censorship laws such as the Motion Picture Censorship Regulation and the Chosun Motion Picture Law were introduced during the Colonial Period.\n\nThe Motion Picture Censorship Regulation includes:\n\nThe Chosun Motion Picture Law includes:\n1) Requirement to obtain license in the film industry\n2) Prior restraint of films\n3) Punishment for infractions of the law\n\nThe major reason for establishing such laws were to strengthen control of the public since such media were excellent vehicles to influence its viewers. They required filmmakers not to harm the image of the Japanese Empire nor praise their enemy in order to prevent any form of doubt on the Japanese dominance. They closed down several Korean film production companies and banned some of films that were disadvantageous to the Japanese Empire.\n\nMajor films influenced by censorship:\n\nFilm censorship had a tremendous impact on the South Korean film industry during the years between 1973 and 1992. Consequently, Korean movies experienced its biggest hindrance which is now known to be the depression period. During this period, film censorship was strongly enforced under the military regime by Park Chung Hee and Chun Doo Hwan. They both realized that media was the most influential channel used at the time that affected how people viewed the government. Prior to 1987, the government enacted the First Motion Picture Law to take control of the film industry. This law did not allow the industry to freely produce the movie if the contents were not met to their criteria. President Park Chung Hee established the Motion Picture Promotion Corporation (MPPC) to support the film industry. However, Park’s main purpose was to safeguard antigovernment issues played in the movie more so than supporting the film industry.\n\nElements of MPPC:\n1) License system\n2) Import quotas to set a limitation on how many films to be produced\n3) Strong censorship.\nThe filmmakers could only depict the positive side rather than negative side of Korean society, thus, the movies were not expressed the way they wanted which lead to poor results. The filmmakers continuously pushed the government to amend their censorship laws in order to promote freedom of expression, but the attempts were futile due to unyielding political influence and this was the main contribution to decline of South Korea’s film industry.\n\nThe history of Korean movies has lasted for over a hundred years, since the very first movie was played; but it hasn’t ever been free from government censorship. In 1907, the inspector general made the security law, which stated that anything that is performed in public can be regulated and controlled by the government. And when Korea was under Japanese rule, censorship was more strongly regulated than ever before. The Governor-General of Korea made an activity regulation committee in 1920 and performance regulation rules in 1922. In the movie ‘General's Son,’ there is the scene of Japanese police sitting right next to the stage and arresting anyone who shows signs of propagandas to the public. Many movies were censored at this period of time. “Across the Tumen River” could be released after deletion of some scenes and changes of the name of the movie to “To Find Love.” “Ben-Hur” had been issued because the silent-firm narrator encouraged national consciousness.\n\nIn 1960, after the April Revolution, the national movie ethic committee was founded which was the very first public organization that evaluated movies without government watch. As a result, “Aimless Bullet” and “A Coachman” that were about national consciousness could be played in the theatre. After the 5.16 military coup, a military government emerged and amended the constitution. The amendment stated that for public morals and social ethics, the government can censor movies or entertainment. After the amendment, “ Aimless bullet” was shut down at the theatre because one line in the movie says ‘Let’s go’ which they stated meant “Let’s go to the north.” During that time period, the anti-communism law allowed for the Central Intelligence Agency to arrest people, which they then used to arrest Man-hee lee, director of “Seven Women Prisoners ”. They stated that he described the North Korean Army as good and cool. They also released him under the condition that he had to make an anti-communism movie, which is why he made “Soldier Without Service Number” They arrested him again because he had cast a good looking guy for North Korean army. During this period of time, all the movies that were made also had to pass scenario censorship and after the movies were made. There was the other censorship, so all the movies had to pass two censorships from government. More than 80 percent of movies had to be revised before even filming the movie. For example, the movie ‘Fool’s March’ had many parts of the script had to be deleted even before the film was made. This led to a half hour of the film being deleted.\n\nAfter South Korea opened the Olympics in 1988, it became possible to import the movies about communism and the censorship level for eroticism was loosened; but not many things had been changed. In September 1996, 10 minutes of the opening movie \"Crash\" from David Cronenberg was deleted, which led to great shame at the international movie festival. One month later, The Constitutional Court ruled that the censorship was unconstitutional. Following that rule, the movie laws had to be changed, and the Korea Media Rating Board was founded. They also made an additional rating level which was over R rating. It is reserved for movies that cannot be shown in regular movie theatres and can only be shown in designated unrated theaters which do not even exist in Korea. This means that movie makers have to delete the scenes in order for their films to receive an R rating. Even though the Korea Movie Rating Board does not have the power to regulate the scenes in the movies; they can imply that the movie makers need to censor the movies in order for the film to be shown.\n\nIn recent years, sexual scenes have been a major issue that pits filmmakers against Media Rating Board. Pubic hair and male or female genitalia is disallowed on the screen, unless they are digitally blurred. In rare cases extreme violence, obscene language, or certain portrayals of drug use may also become an issue. South Korea has 5 different levels of rating systems; G, PG-12, PG-15, R-18 and Restricted Rate. These are ruled by the Presidential Decree. \nThe first movie that was rated reservation rate was ‘Yellow Hair.’ The fact that this movie got the reservation rate made more people watch this movie than usual. This movie was rejected in early 1999 before being rated an 18+ rate on its second application, after a sex scene between two women and one man was partially cut and digitally altered. The movie ‘Lies’ sued the Movie Rating Board for reservation rating to the Constitutional Court and the Court ruled that the reservation rate was unconstitutional. They changed from the reservation rate to Restricted Rate. It didn’t make any difference than reservation rate because the Board made restricted rate movie theatres afterward; they all went to bankrupt or shut down. So basically the movies that received an R-rating lost their place to be shown. The movie “I Saw the Devil (2010)” could be shown at the theatre after deletion of one and half minutes of the movie.\n\nThe 2014 film, \"The Interview\" was banned in South Korea because it depicts of criticizing and killing of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Although it was available in black markets, in 2015, a North Korean-defector sent unlicensed copies of the film via a helium balloon into the DMZ.\n\n"}
{"id": "750439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=750439", "title": "Fire performance", "text": "Fire performance\n\nFire performance is a group of performance arts or skills that involve the manipulation of fire. Fire performance typically involves equipment or other objects made with one or more wicks which are designed to sustain a large enough flame to create a visual effect.\n\nFire performance includes skills based on juggling, baton twirling, poi spinning, and other forms of object manipulation. It also includes skills such as fire breathing, fire eating, and body burning; sometimes called fakir skills.\nFire performance has various styles of performance including fire dancing; the use of fire as a finalé in an otherwise non-fire performance; and the use of fire skills as 'dangerous' stunts. Performances can be done as choreographed routines to music (this type being related to dance or rhythmic gymnastics); as freestyle (performed to music or not) performances; or performed with vocal interaction with the audience. Some aspect of fire performance can be found in a wide variety of cultural traditions and rituals from around the world.\n\nAny performance involving fire carries inherent danger and risks, and fire safety precautions should always be taken.\nAncient Aztecs performed a fire dance dedicated to Xiuhtecuhtli, the god of fire. The Aztec fire dance is performed today for tourists in Mexico. In Bali, the Angel Dance and the Fire Dance, regularly performed for tourists, have origins in ancient rituals. Both the Angel Dance and the Fire Dance originated in a trance ritual called the \"sanghyang\", a ritual dance \"performed to ward off witches at the time of an epidemic.\" Also known as the \"horse dance\" men perform the dance by holding rods representing horses, while leaping around burning coconut husks, and walking through the flames. French Polynesia, Antigua, Cuba and Saint Lucia are other locations where fire dances are recreated for tourists. The Siddha Jats of the Thar Desert in India perform traditional fire dances as part of the Spring festival. Fire dancing is performed to music played on drums and the behr. There are variations of the fire dancing; men often perform a dance that involves walking on hot coals.A large fire is created and allowed to burn down until it is a pit of glowing embers. The performers then jump in and out of the pit kicking up the embers to create showers of sparks while women perform a dance while balancing flaming tin pots on their heads. Today this ritual is often performed for tourists.\nSince the mid-1990s fire performance has grown in popularity. This growth has occurred both for hobby and professional practitioners. Fire skills are performed at raves, nightclubs, beach parties, and music festivals. A festival that is popular with fire performers is at Burning Man, where the fire skills are especially prevalent. Fire performance has become increasingly popular as entertainment at corporate events, street festivals, celebration events and as a precursor to firework displays.\n\nFire performance has become more popular through the availability of a wider variety of fire equipment and teaching methods.\n\n\nFire performance is usually performed with props that have specifically been made for the purpose. Fire torches, fire staffs, fire poi, fire hula hoops, fire whips, and other fire props are all readily available.\n\nNearly all modern fire performance apparatus rely on a liquid fuel soaked in the wick. There are many choices for fuels, which differ in their specific properties. Fire performers select a fuel or a blend of fuels based on safety, cost, availability, and the desirability of various characteristics of the fuel including for example, the colour of flame, and flame temperature. There is also some geographic variance in fuels used, due local availability and price. Some American fire performers use white gas although most use other fuels due to its low flash point, while British fire performers almost exclusively use kerosene (called \"paraffin\" in the UK). New Zealand performers often use Pegasol, which burns at a low heat, a bright colour and leaves little residue or smell.\n\nFire performance skills are inherently dangerous and only careful use of the props, storage of the fuel and performance in appropriate spaces will mean that the risks are minimised. Fire insurance policies all require fire performers to carry fire extinguishers, fire blankets or other fire safety equipment.\n\nThere are organized events in various parts of the world teaching fire arts and object manipulation. These events which can be fire festivals or workshops at juggling or music festivals are popular in US, Canada, United Kingdom and Australia.\n\n\n"}

During its time on the air, it has been the subject of numerous controversies and allegations.\n\nFox News has been alleged by academics, media figures, political figures, and watchdog groups of having Republican Party bias in their news coverage as well as perpetuating more general views of a conservative bias. Fox News has publicly denied such charges, stating that the reporters in the newsroom provide separate, neutral reporting, while acknowledging their opinion programming is not intended to be neutral.\n\nAt times, the allegations of bias have led to back and forth conflicts between Fox commentators and political and media figures. For example, in 2009 the Fox News Channel engaged in a verbal conflict with the Obama administration.\n\nFormer Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean has referred to Fox News as a \"right-wing propaganda machine,\" and several Democratic Party politicians have boycotted events hosted or sponsored by the network. In 2007, several major Democratic Party presidential candidates (Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, Barack Obama, and Bill Richardson) boycotted or dropped out of Fox News-sponsored or hosted debates, forcing their cancellation.\n\nSimilar accusations have been levied against Fox News in response to its decision to exclude Ron Paul and Duncan Hunter from the January 5, 2008, Republican candidate debate. In response, many individuals and organizations petitioned Fox News to reconsider its decision. When Fox refused to change its position and continued to exclude Paul and Hunter, the New Hampshire Republican Party officially announced it would withdraw as a Fox partner in the forum.\n\nWhile the network has been criticized for its tendency to support the Republican Party and its interests, David Frum, former speechwriter for George W. Bush, has also said, \"Republicans originally thought that Fox worked for us and now we're discovering we work for Fox.\"\n\nLarry King said in a January 17, 2007, interview with the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", \"They're a Republican brand. They're an extension of the Republican Party with some exceptions, [like] Greta Van Susteren. But I don't begrudge them that. [Fox CEO] Roger Ailes is an old friend. They've been nice to me. They've said some very nice things about me. Not [Bill] O'Reilly, but I don't watch him.\"\n\nWriting for the \"Los Angeles Times\", Republican and conservative columnist Jonah Goldberg stated: \"Look, I think liberals have reasonable gripes with Fox News. It does lean to the right, primarily in its opinion programming but also in its story selection (which is fine by me) and elsewhere. But it's worth remembering that Fox is less a bastion of ideological conservatism and more a populist, tabloid-like network.\"\n\nFox News host Bill O'Reilly stated in 2004 in the context of the Iraq War that \"Fox does tilt right\", but that the network does not \"actively campaign or try to help Bush-Cheney.\"\n\nProgressive media watch dog groups such as Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) and Media Matters for America, have argued that Fox News reporting contains conservative editorializing within news stories. FAIR has asserted that the ratio of conservative to non-conservative guests on Fox shows strongly favors conservatives. In a study of a 19-week period from January 2001 to May 2001 on \"Special Report with Brit Hume\" the ratio was 25:3, and FAIR obtained similar data from other Fox shows.\nAccuracy in Media has claimed that there was a conflict of interest in Fox News' co-sponsorship of the May 15, 2007, Republican presidential candidates debate, pointing out that candidate and former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani's law firm had tackled copyright protection and legislation on the purchase of cable TV lineups for News Corporation, the parent company of Fox News, and suggesting that Fox might be biased in favor of Giuliani's candidacy for the Republican Party presidential nomination.\n\nAustralian-born media mogul Rupert Murdoch is the chairman and CEO of 21st Century Fox, the owner of Fox News Channel. He has been a subject of controversy and criticism as a result of his substantial influence in both the print and broadcast media. In the United States, he is the publisher of the \"New York Post\" newspaper and the magazine \"The Weekly Standard\". Accusations against him include the \"dumbing down\" of news and introducing \"mindless vulgarity\" in place of genuine journalism, and having his own outlets produce news that serve his own political and financial agendas. According to the BBC website: \"To some he is little less than the devil incarnate, to others, the most progressive mover-and-shaker in the media business.\"\n\nThen-presidential candidate George W. Bush's cousin, John Prescott Ellis, was Fox News' projection team manager during the general election of 2000. After speaking numerous times on election night with his cousins George and Jeb, Ellis, at 2:16 AM, reversed Fox News' call for Florida as a state won by Al Gore. Critics allege this was a premature decision, given the impossibly razor-thin margin (officially 537 of 5.9 million votes), which created the \"lasting impression that Bush 'won' the White House – and all the legal wrangling down in Florida is just a case of Democratic 'snippiness'.\" Others, such as researcher John Lott, have responded that, by this reasoning, Fox News and the other networks were even more premature in initially calling the state for \"Gore\", a call made while polls were still open, and which may have depressed voter turnout for Bush, actually affecting the election, whereas the call for Bush later could not have, as the polls were closed by then.\n\nOn January 9, 2010, the son-in-law of Rupert Murdoch and the husband of Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth, Matthew Freud, stated he and other members of the media mogul's family are \"ashamed and sickened\" by the right leaning tendencies of Fox News in the opening salvo in a bid to displace Roger Ailes, the founder and CEO of Fox News. In the previous Sunday New York Times news story featuring a profile on Roger Ailes, Freud was quoted saying \"I am by no means alone within the family or the company in being ashamed and sickened by Roger Ailes' horrendous and sustained disregard of the journalist standards that News Corporation, its founder and every other global media business aspires to, what you heard was a declaration of war, There are, practically speaking, now two factions inside of News Corp.: Ailes and Fox News, and the Murdoch children – with Rupert caught between them.\" Although Rupert Murdoch did not respond to the remark directly, a spokesperson for News Corporation put a statement after a Financial Times inquiry claiming \"Matthew Freud's opinions are his own and in no way reflect the views of Rupert Murdoch, who is proud of Roger Ailes and Fox News.\" Tim Arango also claims in Murdoch's 2008 biography that he voiced concerns privately to Ailes about his conduct claiming he was purportedly \"embarrassed\" by Fox News. Murdoch denied that claim.\n\nIn June 2010, News Corporation donated $1 million to the Republican Governors Association. News Corporation's political action committee had previously split their contributions to Democrats and Republicans by a margin of 54% to 46%, respectively.\n\nA poll conducted by Rasmussen Reports during September 2004 found that Fox News was seen as second to CBS as the most politically biased network in the public view. 37% of respondents thought CBS, in the wake of the Memogate scandal, was trying to help elect John Kerry, while 34% of respondents said they believed that Fox's goal was to \"help elect Bush.\" However, a poll conducted by Public Policy Polling in January 2010 found Fox News to be the only US television news network to receive a positive rating by the public for trustworthiness with results strongly split depending on the political affiliation of the respondents \nA survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press showed \"a striking rise in the politicization of cable TV news audiences ... This pattern is most apparent with the fast-growing Fox News Channel.\" Another Pew survey of news consumption found that Fox News has not suffered a decline in credibility with its audience, with one in four (25%) saying they believe all or most of what they see on Fox News Channel, virtually unchanged since Fox was first tested in 2000.\n\nAccording to the results of a 2006 study by the Project for Excellence in Journalism a survey of 547 journalists, found that Fox was rarely cited by surveyed journalists as an outlet taking an ideological stance in its coverage, and most identified as advocating conservative political positions. In the 2004 survey, 69% of national journalists cited Fox News as being especially conservative in its coverage of news.\n\nThe \"2011 State of the News Media\" Report by the Pew Center on Excellence in Journalism found that in 2010, Fox News Channel had average daytime audience of 1.2 million and nighttime viewership of 1.1 million, higher than its cable competitors but down 11% and 9% respectively from 2009. Fox's cumulative audience (unique viewers who watched at least 60 minutes in an average month) was 41.1 million, coming in second to CNN with 41.7 million. For 2010, CNN's digital network continued to lead Fox's digital network online; CNN with 35.7 million unique visitors per month, compared to Fox's 15.5 million. For the first time Fox outspent its competitors, with a total news investment of $686 million. 72% of this investment went to program costs, reflecting their focus on high-profile hosts. They also increased their revenues 17% over 2009 to $1.5 billion, well ahead of second-place CNN at $1.2 billion.\n\nThe Project on Excellence in Journalism report in 2006 showed that 68 percent of Fox cable stories contained personal opinions, as compared to MSNBC at 27 percent and CNN at 4 percent. The \"content analysis\" portion of their 2005 report also concluded that \"Fox was measurably more one-sided than the other networks, and Fox journalists were more opinionated on the air.\"\n\nA 2006 University of California, Berkeley study cited that there was a correlation between the presence of the Fox News Channel in cable markets and increases in Republican votes in those markets.\n\nA 2010 study found that with respect to coverage of the Iraq War and the first war in Afghanistan in 2005 found that \"Fox News was much more sympathetic to the [Bush] administration than NBC.\"\n\nIn a 2006 academic content analysis of election news, Rasmussen Reports showed that coverage at ABC, CBS, and NBC was more favorable toward Kerry than Bush, while coverage at Fox News Channel were more favorable toward Bush.\n\nIn a 2010 study of the news coverage of the 2004 political party conventions, Morris and Francia found that Fox news reporting was more negative toward the Democratic Convention and gave Republicans more opportunity to voice their message than the other networks. The study also found that viewers who relied on Fox news coverage exhibited attitude change toward both candidates, but particularly a lowering opinions toward John Kerry. In contrast the study found that CNN's coverage was more fair and balanced.\n\nA study published in November 2005 by Tim Groseclose, a professor of political science at UCLA, scoring political bias from twenty mainstream news reporting outlets, concluded that all \"except Fox News' Special Report and the \"Washington Times\", received scores to the left of the average member of Congress.\" In particular, Fox News' \"Special Report with Brit Hume\" had an Americans for Democratic Action rating that was right of the political center. Groseclose's model used the number of times a host cited a particular think tank on his or her program and compared it with the number of times a member of the U.S. Congress cited a think tank, correlating that with the politician's Americans for Democratic Action rating.\n\nGeoff Nunberg, a professor of linguistics at UC Berkeley and a National Public Radio commentator, criticized the methodology of the study and labeled its conclusions invalid. He pointed to what he saw as a Groseclose's reliance on interpretations of facts and data that were taken from sources that were not, in his view, credible. Groseclose and Professor Jeff Milyo rebutted, saying Nunberg \"shows a gross misunderstanding [of] our statistical method and the actual assumptions upon which it relies.\" Mark Liberman (a professor of Computer Science and the director of Linguistic Data Consortium at the University of Pennsylvania), who helped post Groseclose and Milyo's rebuttal, later posted how the statistical methods used to calculate this bias pose faults. Mark concluded \"that many if not most of the complaints directed against G&M are motivated in part by ideological disagreement — just as much of the praise for their work is motivated by ideological agreement. It would be nice if there were a less politically fraught body of data on which such modeling exercises could be explored.\"\n\nA December 2007 study/examination by Robert Lichter of a self-described nonpartisan media watchdog group, the Center for Media and Public Affairs found that Fox News's evaluations of all of the 2008 Democratic presidential candidates combined was 51% positive and 49% negative, while the network's evaluations of the Republican presidential candidates 51% negative and 49% positive. The study, however, did find that Fox's coverage was less negative toward Republican candidates than the coverage of broadcast networks.\n\nA study by Media Matters for America found that between August 1 and October 1, 2013, on Fox News \"69 percent of guests and 75 percent of mentions cast doubt on climate science,\" compared to \"[half] of those quoted in \"The Wall Street Journal\" ... about 29 percent in The \"Los Angeles Times\", about 17 percent in the \"Washington Post\" and about 12 percent in Bloomberg News.\" Fox News' argument against criticism that it disproportionately represents the views of climate change deniers was to itself deny the factual figures which indicate that 97% of climate science experts worldwide hold the consensus view of human-caused global warming. A 2012 report by the Union of Concerned Scientists found that 93% of global warming coverage by Fox News was misleading. The report put the figure slightly lower—81 percent—for the \"Wall Street Journal\". The misleading statements identified in the report included \"... dismissals of human-caused climate change, disparaging comments about individual scientists, rejections of climate science as a body of knowledge, and cherry picking of data.\"\n\nCroft concluded that Fox News coverage glorified the Iraq War and its reporting framed the discussion in such a way as to drown out critics. He quotes Christiane Amanpour as stating that there was a culture of self-censorship created by \"the administration and its foot soldiers at \"Fox News\"\".\n\nA May 2017 study conducted by Harvard University's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy examined coverage of U.S. President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office by several major mainstream media outlets including Fox. It found that, altogether, Trump received 80% negative coverage from the media, and that he received the least negative coverage on Fox – 52% negative and 48% positive.\n\nA study by the Program on International Policy Attitudes (PIPA) at the University of Maryland School of Public Affairs, as published in the Winter 03–04 issue of the \"Political Science Quarterly\", reported that poll-based findings indicated that viewers of Fox News, the Fox Broadcasting Company and local Fox affiliates were more likely than viewers of other news networks to hold three misperceptions:\n\n\nIn response, Fox News frequent guest Ann Coulter characterized the PIPA findings as \"misperceptions of pointless liberal factoids\" and called it a \"hoax poll\". Bill O'Reilly called the study \"absolute crap\". Roger Ailes referred to the study as \"an old push poll\". James Taranto, editor of OpinionJournal.com, the \"Wall Street Journal\"s online editorial page, called the poll \"pure propaganda\". PIPA issued a clarification on October 17, 2003, stating that \"The findings were not meant to and cannot be used as a basis for making broad judgments about the general accuracy of the reporting of various networks or the general accuracy of the beliefs of those who get their news from those networks. Only a substantially more comprehensive study could undertake such broad research questions,\" and stated \"that the correlation between viewing Fox News and holding misperceptions does not prove that Fox News' presentation caused the misperceptions\", inferring that causality is not necessary to prove correlation.\n\nPIPA also conducted a statistical study on purported misinformation evidenced by registered voters before the 2010 election. According to the results of the study, \"... false or misleading information is widespread in the general information environment ...\" but viewers of Fox News were more likely to be misinformed on specific issues when compared to viewers of comparable media, that this likelihood also increased proportionally to the frequency of viewing Fox News and that these findings showed statistical significance.\n\nA 2007 Pew Research Center poll of general political knowledge (\"Who is the governor of your state?\", \"Who is the President of Russia?\") indicated that Fox News Channel viewers scored 35% in the high-knowledge area, the same as the national average. This was not significantly different than local news, network news and morning news, and was slightly lower than CNN (41%). Viewers of \"The O'Reilly Factor\" (51%) scored in the high category along with Rush Limbaugh (50%), NPR (51%), major newspapers (54%), \"Newshour with Jim Lehrer\" (53%) \"The Daily Show\" (54%) and \"The Colbert Report\" (54%).\n\nA 2010 Stanford University survey found \"more exposure to Fox News was associated with more rejection of many mainstream scientists' claims about global warming, [and] with less trust in scientists\". A 2011 Kaiser Family Foundation survey on U.S. misperceptions about health care reform found that Fox News viewers had a poorer understanding of the new laws and were more likely to believe in falsehoods about the Affordable Care Act such as cuts to Medicare benefits and the death panel myth. A 2010 Ohio State University study of public misperceptions about the so-called \"Ground Zero Mosque\", officially named Park51, found that viewers who relied on Fox News were 66% more likely to believe incorrect rumors than those with a \"low reliance\" on Fox News.\n\nIn 2011, a study by Fairleigh Dickinson University found that New Jersey Fox News viewers were less well informed than people who did not watch any news at all. The study employed objective questions, such as whether Hosni Mubarak was still in power in Egypt.\n\nFox News Channel executives exert a degree of editorial control over the content of the network's daily reporting. The channel's Vice President of News, John Moody, controls content by writing memos to the news department staff. In the documentary \"Outfoxed\", former Fox News employees talk about the inner workings of the channel. In memos from the documentary, Moody instructs employees how to approach particular stories and on what stories to approach. Critics of Fox News claim that the instructions on many of the memos indicate a conservative bias. \"The Washington Post\" quoted Larry Johnson, a former part-time Fox News commentator, describing the Moody memos as \"talking points instructing us what the themes are supposed to be, and God help you if you stray.\"\n\nFormer Fox News producer Charlie Reina explained, \"The roots of Fox News Channel's day-to-day on-air bias are actual and direct. They come in the form of an executive memo distributed electronically each morning, addressing what stories will be covered and, often, suggesting how they should be covered. To the newsroom personnel responsible for the channel's daytime programming, The Memo is the Bible. If, on any given day, you notice that the Fox anchors seem to be trying to drive a particular point home, you can bet The Memo is behind it.\"\n\nPhotocopied memos from John Moody instructed the network's on-air anchors and reporters to use positive language when discussing pro-life viewpoints, the Iraq War, and tax cuts, as well as requesting that the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal be put in context with the other violence in the area. Such memos were reproduced for the film \"Outfoxed\", which included Moody quotes such as, \"The soldiers [seen on Fox in Iraq] in the foreground should be identified as 'sharpshooters,' not 'snipers,' which carries a negative connotation.\" \n\nTwo days after the 2006 election, \"The Huffington Post\" reported that its news department had acquired a copy of a leaked internal memo from Mr. Moody that recommended the following: \"... [L]et's be on the lookout for any statements from the Iraqi insurgents, who must be thrilled at the prospect of a Dem-controlled congress.\" Within hours of the memo's publication, Fox News anchor Martha McCallum, went on-air on the program \"The Live Desk\" with reports of Iraqi insurgents cheering the firing of Donald Rumsfeld and the results of the 2006 congressional election.\n\nIn December 2010, Media Matters for America released a leaked October 2009 e-mail between Fox News Washington managing editor Bill Sammon and the network's senior producers, which seemed to issue directives slanting Fox News' coverage of President Barack Obama's health care reform efforts. In the e-mail, Sammon instructed producers to not use the phrase \"public option\" when discussing a key measure of President Obama's reform bill, and instead use the terms \"government option\" or \"government-run health insurance[,]\" noting negative connotations; Sammon also suggested that the qualifier \"so-called\" be said before any proper mention of the public option. Another e-mail by Fox News senior vice president Michael Clemente accepted Sammon's conditions. Critics claimed that Sammon took advice from Republican pollster Frank Luntz, who appeared on \"Hannity\" shortly before the e-mail was written and made the same suggestions in identifying the public option. Critics also noticed that reporters and panelists on \"Special Report with Bret Baier\" used the term \"public option\" before the e-mail was sent, but used the term \"government option\" immediately afterwards. Sammon, in an interview with Howard Kurtz for \"The Daily Beast\", defended the directive and denied he was trying to skew Fox News' coverage.\n\nLater that month, Media Matters released an e-mail by Sammon from December 2009, in which he pressured Fox News reporters to assert that \"theories are based upon data that critics have called into question\" in light of the Climatic Research Unit email controversy.\n\nIn August 2007, a new utility, WikiScanner, revealed that English Wikipedia articles relating to Fox News had been edited from IP addresses owned by Fox News, though it was not possible to determine exactly who the editors were. The tool showed that the article for Shepard Smith was edited from Fox computers, removing mention of an arrest.\n\nOn the edition of July 2, 2008 of \"Fox and Friends\", co-hosts Brian Kilmeade and Steve Doocy aired photos of \"New York Times\" reporter Jacques Steinberg and \"Times\" television editor Steven Reddicliffe that appeared to have been crudely doctored, apparently in order to portray the journalists unflatteringly. This occurred during a discussion of a piece in the edition of June 28 of \"The New York Times\", which pointed out what Steinberg called \"ominous trends\" in Fox News' ratings.\n\nAccording to Media Matters, the photos depict \"New York Times\" reporter Jacques Steinberg with yellowed teeth, \"his nose and chin widened, and his ears made to protrude further.\" The other image, of Times television editor Steven Reddicliffe, had similar yellow teeth, as well as \"dark circles ... under his eyes, and his hairline has been moved back.\"\n\nDuring the discussion, Doocy called the \"Times\" report, written by Steinberg, a \"hit piece\" ordered up by Reddicliffe. The broadcast then showed an image of Steinberg's face superimposed over a picture of a poodle, while Reddicliffe's face was superimposed over the man holding the poodle's leash.\n\n\"Times\" culture editor Sam Sifton called the photo that was aired on Fox \"disgusting,\" and the criticism of the paper's reporting a \"specious and meritless claim\" while denying that it was a \"hit piece.\"\nOn September 18, 2009, Fox News Channel took out full-page ads in \"The Washington Post\", the \"New York Post\", and \"The Wall Street Journal\" with a prominent caption reading, \"How did ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, and CNN miss this story?\" with pictures of a Tea Party movement protest on the United States Capitol lawn. A still picture in the ad was in fact taken from a CNN broadcast covering the event. The veracity of this ad was called into question on the air by then-CNN commentator Rick Sanchez, along with others pointing to various coverage of the event. CNN, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, and CBS Radio News provided various forms of live coverage of the rally in Washington throughout the day on Saturday, including the lead story on CBS Evening News.\n\nFox News' vice president of marketing, Michael Tammero, responded, \"it's fair to say that from the tea party movement ... to ACORN ... to the march on 9/12, the networks either ignored the story, marginalized it or misrepresented the significance of it altogether.\"\n\nIn September 2009, the Obama administration engaged in a verbal conflict with Fox News Channel. On September 20, 2009, President Obama appeared on all the major news programs except Fox News, a snub partially in response to remarks about the President by commentators Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity and general coverage by Fox with regard to Obama's health care proposal. \"Fox News Sunday\" host Chris Wallace called White House administration officials \"crybabies\" in response. Following this, a senior Obama adviser told \"U.S. News\" that the White House would never get a fair shake from Fox News.\n\nIn late September 2009, Obama senior advisor David Axelrod and Roger Ailes met in secret to try to smooth out tensions between the two camps without much success. Two weeks later, White House officials referred to FNC as \"not a news network\". Communications director Anita Dunn claimed that \"Fox News often operates as either the research arm or the communications arm of the Republican Party.\" President Obama followed with \"If media is operating basically as a talk radio format, then that's one thing, and if it's operating as a news outlet, then that's another,\" and then-White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel stated that it was important \"to not have the CNN's and the others in the world basically be led in following Fox.\"\n\nWithin days it was reported that Fox had been excluded from an interview with administration official Ken Feinberg, with bureau chiefs from the White House Pool (ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN) coming to the defense of Fox. One of the major bureau chiefs stated, \"If any member had been excluded it would have been the same thing, it has nothing to do with Fox or the White House or the substance of the issues.\" Shortly after this story broke the White House admitted to a low-level mistake, but said that Fox had not made a specific request to interview Feinberg. Fox White House correspondent Major Garrett responded by stating that he had not made a specific request, but that he had a \"standing request from me as senior White House correspondent on Fox to interview any newsmaker at the Treasury at any given time news is being made.\"\n\nOn November 8, 2009 the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that an unnamed Democratic consultant was warned by the White House not to appear on Fox News again. According to the article, Anita Dunn claimed in an e-mail to have checked with colleagues who \"deal with TV issues\" and had been told that nobody had been instructed to avoid Fox. Patrick Caddell, a Fox News contributor and former pollster for President Jimmy Carter said he had spoken with other Democratic consultants who had received similar warnings from the White House.\n\nJon Stewart reported on his November 11, 2009, broadcast of \"The Daily Show\" that Fox News pundit Sean Hannity misrepresented video footage purportedly showing large crowds on a health-care protest orchestrated by Rep. Michele Bachmann. Stewart showed inconsistencies in alternating shots according to the color of the sky and tree leaves, showing that footage from Glenn Beck's much larger 9/12 rally, which had occurred two months earlier, and been spliced in with the other shots. Hannity estimated 20,000 protesters were in attendance, the Washington Post estimated 10,000, and Luke Russert reported that three Capitol Hill police officers guessed \"about 4,000.\" Sean Hannity apologized to his viewers for the error during his November 11, 2009 broadcast. Stewart periodically accused Fox of playing video footage out of context, such as when Hannity played footage of Obama stating the DREAM Act could not be passed by executive order to make the president seem hypocritical although when the footage is continued Obama goes on to clarify that the president does have the authority to halt deportations.\n\nOn November 18, 2009, Fox News anchor Gregg Jarrett told viewers that a Sarah Palin book signing in Grand Rapids, Michigan, had a massive turnout while showing footage of Palin with a large crowd. Jarrett noted that the former Republican vice-presidential candidate is \"continuing to draw huge crowds while she's promoting her brand-new book\", adding that the images being shown were \"some of the pictures just coming in to us ... The lines earlier had formed this morning.\" The video was actually taken from a 2008 McCain/Palin campaign rally. Fox senior vice-president of news Michael Clemente issued an initial statement saying, \"This was a production error in which the copy editor changed a script and didn't alert the control room to update the video.\" Fox offered an on-air apology the following day during the same \"Happening Now\" segment citing regrets for what they described as a \"video error\" with no intent to mislead.\n\nIn September 2010, Fox News anchor Sean Hannity was criticized notably by Stewart and CNN anchor Howard Kurtz, for selectively editing a video of an Obama speech on his program. Before playing the clip, Hannity remarked that there was a \"rare moment of honesty\" in Obama's speech, playing a video of Obama saying:\n\nIt quickly cuts back to Hannity, with Hannity saying, \"I know the anointed one will make sure that happens.\" But upon further inspection, what President Obama fully said was:\n\nAfter Jordanian Air Force pilot Muath al-Kasasbeh was burned to death by ISIL in February 2015, Fox included the full ISIL video on its website. The network said it had chosen to do so, after careful consideration, in order that readers of their website could \"see for themselves the barbarity of ISIS.\" Malcolm Nance, executive director of the think tank TAPSTRI (the Terror Asymmetrics Project on Strategy, Tactics and Radical Ideology), said that Fox News was \"literally — \"literally\" — working for al-Qaida and Isis's media arm ... They might as well start sending them royalty checks.\"\n\nOn July 6, 2016, Gretchen Carlson filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Fox News chairman Roger Ailes in the Superior Court of New Jersey. In her complaint, Carlson alleged that she was fired from her program for refusing Ailes' sexual advances. After Carlson came forward, six more women spoke to Gabriel Sherman of \"New York\" magazine, alleging that Ailes had sexually harassed them and that Ailes had \"spoke openly of expecting women to perform sexual favors in exchange for job opportunities.\" \"New York\" reported that Megyn Kelly told investigators Ailes made \"unwanted sexual advances toward her\" at the start of her career. The magazine also reported that the Murdochs had given Ailes an ultimatum—resign by August 1 or be fired.\n\nFacing overwhelming public criticism, Ailes resigned on July 21, 2016. On September 6, 21st Century Fox Corporation (the parent company of Fox News) announced that it had settled the lawsuit with Carlson. The settlement was reportedly $20 million. As part of the settlement, 21st Century Fox apologized to Carlson, saying that \"We sincerely regret and apologize for the fact that Gretchen was not treated with the respect and dignity that she and all of our colleagues deserve.\"\n\nIn August 2016, Andrea Tantaros, who had been pulled from the network in April with reported \"contract issues,\" claimed that she approached Fox News executives about Ailes sexually harassing her in 2015. She said her allegations resulted first in her being demoted from \"The Five\" to \"Outnumbered\", and then in her being taken off the air. Tantaros filed a lawsuit against Fox News for sexual harassment, also claiming that Bill O'Reilly, Dean Cain, and Scott Brown made inappropriate comments to her, and that Brown and Cain touched her without her consent.\n\nIn April 2017, \"The New York Times\" reported that O'Reilly and Fox News had settled five lawsuits against O'Reilly dating back to 2002, in addition to publicly acknowledged settlements to Andrea Mackris in 2004 and Juliet Huddy in 2017 were publicly reported; \"The Times\" reported that Fox hosts Rebecca Diamond and Laurie Dhue settled sexual harassment lawsuits in 2011 and 2016 respectively and junior producer Rachel Witlieb Bernstein settled with Fox in 2002 after accusing O'Reilly of verbal abuse. The amount paid to the women filing the complaints was estimated at $13 million. \"The Times\" also reported a claim by former \"O'Reilly Factor\" guest Wendy Walsh, who declined an offer from O'Reilly to go to his hotel suite and was subsequently denied a job as a Fox News contributor. 21st Century Fox hired the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison to conduct an investigation into Walsh's allegation; that firm also conducted an investigation into the allegations against Ailes.\n\nAfter the five settlements were reported, the \"O'Reilly Factor\" lost more than half its advertisers within a week; almost 60 companies withdrew their television advertising from the show amid a growing backlash against O'Reilly. On April 11, 2017, O'Reilly announced he would take a two-week vacation to return on will return to the program on April 24. However, on April 19, it was reported that O'Reilly would not return to the network. Co-President Bill Shine, who had been accused of covering up sexual harassment allegations, resigned on May 1.\n\nIn July 2017, Fox Business suspended Charles Payne pending an investigation after a former network guest, Scottie Nell Hughes, accused him of sexual harassment. Payne denied the harassment charge but acknowledged having had a three-year-long \"romantic relationship\" with Hughes before the accusation was made. Hughes, who kept an apartment near Fox's Manhattan headquarters for the duration of the affair, claimed she believed it would help her obtain a permanent position at the network. Her appearances were drastically reduced after she ended the affair in 2015 and reported Payne to Fox.\n\nIn August 2017, \"The Huffington Post\" reported that Eric Bolling sent lewd text messages to two women at Fox News and one at Fox Business. He was suspended pending investigation. Caroline Heldman, a former Fox News guest, alleged that Bolling made numerous unwanted sexual advances towards her.\n\nIn 2013, Fox's daily morning show \"Fox & Friends\" featured a segment in which contributor Dr. David B. Samadi made an appearance to discuss the cost of women's health care. In the program, Samadi argued that insurance costs more for women due to their more frequent use of health services, as opposed to men: \"I just think that the whole system is not working well. I mean this is one of the examples, where men and women are totally different, there is a sex difference when it comes to the health care use, but I really think that if you pay for it, you are going to negotiate, finding out where is the best doctor, where you're going to get a better deal on all these X-rays etc., that's how you're gonna save money.\"\n\nFollowing this segment, Fox received criticism from several online outlets.\n\nOn April 9, 2018, federal agents from the U.S. Attorney's office served a search warrant on the office and residence of Michael Cohen, Trump's personal attorney. On the air, Hannity defended Cohen and criticized the federal action, calling it \"highly questionable\" and \"an unprecedented abuse of power\".\n\nOn April 16, 2018 in a court hearing, Cohen's lawyers told the judge that Cohen had ten clients in 2017-2018 but did \"traditional legal tasks\" for only three: Trump, Elliott Broidy, and a \"prominent person\" who did not wish to be named for fear of being \"embarrassed\". The federal judge ordered the revelation of the third client, whom Cohen's lawyers named as Hannity. Although Hannity has covered Cohen on his show, he did not disclose that he had consulted with Cohen.\n\nFox News released a statement on April 16, 2018 attributed to Hannity: \"Michael Cohen has never represented me in any matter. I never retained him, received an invoice, or paid legal fees. I have occasionally had brief discussions with him about legal questions about which I wanted his input and perspective. I assumed those conversations were confidential, but to be absolutely clear they never involved any matter between me and a third party.\" Also, NBC News quoted Hannity as saying: \"We definitely had attorney-client privilege because I asked him for that\", while Hannity said on his radio show that he \"might have handed him 10 bucks\" for the attorney-client privilege. Lastly, Hannity tweeted that his discussions with Cohen were \"almost exclusively\" about real estate.\n\nThe following day, news reports revealed that Hannity had shared another lawyer with Trump, Jay Sekulow. Sekulow had written a cease-and-desist letter to KFAQ on Hannity's behalf in May 2017, and later represented Trump in connection with the Mueller investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn June 2004, CEO Roger Ailes responded to some of the criticism with a rebuttal in an editorial in \"The Wall Street Journal\"'s \"OpinionJournal\" (\"The Wall Street Journal\" is owned by News Corporation, which also owns Fox News) saying that Fox's critics intentionally confuse opinion shows such as \"The O'Reilly Factor\" with regular news coverage. Ailes stated that Fox News has broken stories harmful to Republicans, offering \"Fox News is the network that broke George W. Bush's DUI four days before the election\" as an example, referring to Bush's DUI charge in 1976 that had not yet been made public. The DUI story was broken by then-Fox affiliate WPXT in Portland, Maine, although Fox News correspondent Carl Cameron also contributed to the report and, in the words of National Public Radio ombudsman Alicia Shepard, Fox News Channel \"sent the story ping-ponging around the nation\" by broadcasting WPXT's coverage. WPXT News Director Kevin Kelly said that he \"called Fox News in New York City to see if we were flogging a dead horse\" before running the story, and that Fox News Channel confirmed the arrest with the campaign and ran the story shortly after 6 p.m.\n\nUpon the release of \"Outfoxed\", Fox News issued a statement denouncing MoveOn.org, Greenwald and \"The New York Times\" for copyright infringement. Fox dismissed their judgments of former employees featured in the documentary as the partisan views of disgruntled workers who never vocalized concern over any alleged bias while they were employed at the network. Ailes also shrugged off criticisms of the former Fox employees by noting that they worked in Fox affiliates and not at the actual channel itself. Fox News also challenged any news organization that sought to portray Fox as a \"problem\" with the following proposition: \"\"If they will put out 100 percent of their editorial directions and internal memos, Fox News Channel will publish 100 percent of our editorial directions and internal memos, and let the public decide who is fair. This includes any legitimate cable news network, broadcast network, \"The New York Times\", \"Los Angeles Times\", and \"The Washington Post.\" \nFormer Fox News personality Eric Burns has suggested in an interview that Fox \"probably gives voice to more conservatives than the other networks. But not at the expense of liberals.\" Burns justifies a higher exposure of conservatives by saying that other media often ignore conservatives.\n\nFox News personalities have also taken part in back and forth disagreements with media personalities such as Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert.\n\n\n"}

Ligron changed her first name from Agnès to Spanish Inés (or French Inès) when she was 25, because she started working in Spain where people could not say her name correctly, and in English it sounded too old-fashioned.

The rules were standardized from the 13th century. The game was influenced by the Chinese sport of \"Cuju\". The characters for Kemari are the same as Cuju in Chinese. The sport was introduced to Japan about 600, during the Asuka period. Nowadays, it is played in Shinto shrines for festivals. George H. W. Bush played the game on one of his presidential visits to Japan.\n\nIt is a non-competitive sport. The object of Kemari is to keep one ball in the air, with all players cooperating to do so. Players may use any body part with the exception of arms and hands – their head, feet, knees, back, and depending on the rules, elbows to keep the ball aloft. The ball, known as a \"Mari\", is made of deerskin with the hair facing inside and the hide on the outside. The ball is stuffed with barley grains to give it shape. When the hide has set in this shape, the grains are removed from the ball, and it is then sewn together using the skin of a horse. The one who kicks the ball is called a \"mariashi.\" A good mariashi makes it easy for the receiver to control the mari, and serves it with a soft touch to make it easy to keep the mari in the air.\n\nKemari is played on a flat ground, about 6–7 meters squared. The uniforms that the players wear are reminiscent of the clothes of the Asuka age and include a crow hat. This type of clothing was called \"kariginu\" and it was fashionable at that time.\n\n"}

The work involves a full orchestra, with particular emphasis on the brass section at climactic moments. The work is narrated with the reading of excerpts of Abraham Lincoln's great documents, including the Gettysburg Address. An orchestra usually invites a prominent person to be the narrator.\n\nCopland was asked to write a musical portrait of an \"eminent American\" by the conductor Andre Kostelanetz. Copland used material from speeches and letters of Lincoln and quoted original folk songs of the period, including \"Camptown Races\" and \"On Springfield Mountain\". \nCopland finished \"Lincoln Portrait\" in April 1942.\n\nThe first performance was by the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra on 14 May 1942, with William Adams as the narrator.\n\nTogether with some descriptive comments on Lincoln (\"Abe Lincoln was a quiet and a melancholy man\"), the work contains the following excerpts from his speeches:\nFellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance or\ninsignificance can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation. We, even we here, hold the power and bear the responsibility. (Annual Message to Congress [since the twentieth century, State of the Union], December 1, 1862)\n\nThe dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country. (Annual Message to Congress, December 1, 1862)\n\nIt is the eternal struggle between two principles, right and wrong, throughout the world. It is the same spirit that says 'you toil and work and earn bread, and I'll eat it.' No matter in what shape it comes, whether from the mouth of a king who seeks to bestride the people of his own nation, and live by the fruit of their labor, or from one race of men as an apology for enslaving another race, it is the same tyrannical principle. (Lincoln–Douglas debates, October 15, 1858)\n\nAs I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy. Whatever differs from this, to the extent of the difference, is no democracy. (Unknown, though in Lincoln's \"Collected Works\")\n\nThat from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion. That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain. That this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth. (Gettysburg Address)\n\"Lincoln Portrait\" is scored for speaker and orchestra:\n\nNotable narrators of \"Lincoln Portrait\" have included:\n\nJuana Sujo, an Argentine actress resident in Venezuela and an opponent of the repressive regime of Venezuelan President Marcos Pérez Jiménez, was credited with sparking the popular uprising that led to his removal from power. Aaron Copland had come to Caracas to conduct the first Venezuelan performance of \"Lincoln Portrait\" on March 27, 1957. A \"New York Times\" reviewer said it had a \"magical effect\" on the audience.\n\nAs Copland recalled, \"To everyone's surprise, the reigning dictator, who had rarely dared to be seen in public, arrived at the last possible moment.\" On that evening Juana Sujo was the fiery narrator who performed the spoken-word parts of the piece. When she spoke the final words, \"... that government of the people, by the people, for the people (el gobierno del pueblo, por el pueblo y para el pueblo) shall not perish from the earth,\" the audience rose and began cheering and shouting so loudly that Copland could not hear the remainder of the music. Copland continued, \"It was not long after that the dictator was deposed and fled from the country. I was later told by an American foreign service officer that the \"Lincoln Portrait\" was credited with having inspired the first public demonstration against him. That, in effect, it had started a revolution.\"\n\nThe composition was lampooned by Peter Schickele (\"P. D. Q. Bach\") in his piece \"Bach Portrait\" on the album \"1712 Overture and Other Musical Assaults\". Another parody, \"A Quayle Portrait\" by Jeff Ehrhart, features quotes from former U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle.\n\nNine minutes of the composition, without narration (from a late 1960s recording by the London Symphony Orchestra), plays during the climactic one-on-one sequence between Jake and Jesus Shuttlesworth (played by Denzel Washington and Ray Allen) in the 1998 Spike Lee film, \"He Got Game\". In the film, Jesus Shuttlesworth is a student at Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn.\n\n"}

He also appears occasionally in popular music, some contemporary fashion advertising, and the visual arts.\n\nThe most common stereotype of the hustler is as a sexy but tragic figure. This stereotype reveals both a fascination with the hustler as a sexual object and sadness or disdain with his situation and life style. This stereotyped male hustler is often an under-aged or teen-age \"street kid\" or \"runaway\" forced to leave home because of his sexual orientation or because of sexual abuse. He is often portrayed as a drug addict or thief. The plotline frequently focuses on the crisis of leaving the trade or the street (\"one last trick\"), or on making enough money for an important use (a medical treatment, a gift). The climax often has one of two possible outcomes: the hustler either abandons the trade and re-integrates society, or he meets a tragic end. This tragic image of the hustler can be contrasted with the stereotype of the female hooker with a heart of gold: instead of being portrayed as someone in control and contented, the hustler is lost, homeless, broke or exploited.\n\nIn movies and books that take the point of view of the client or of a boy/girl friend who loves the hustler, the hustler is often depicted as an impossible love object who will only bring hurt or frustration. The lover may grow jealous of and disturbed by the hustler's work; occasionally the loving boy/girl friend will be drawn into the lifestyle of their hustler boy friend. Older clients who fall in love with hustlers are frequently prey to emotional (and sometimes physical) pain; this is especially true in the case of \"rough trade\" (where the hustler identifies as straight), and this depiction has been reinforced by several famous incidents of violence against clients (such as the deaths of Pier Paolo Pasolini and Rudolph Moshammer).\n\nIn contrast to the previous depictions, the male prostitute has also sometimes been portrayed as an idealized rebel living outside the law and free of bourgeois conventions. This almost Nietzschean image of the hustler as moral and sexual outlaw owes much to the writings of Jean Genet, William S. Burroughs and John Rechy (among others).\n\nWhile less frequent in cinema and novels, the male prostitute with exclusively female clients (the \"gigolo\" or \"escort\") is generally depicted in a less tragic manner than the gay hustler (the gigolo is portrayed as older, athletic, well-dressed, etc.), and films like \"American Gigolo\" have done much to paint the character as a sophisticated seducer. This portrayal has also led to cinematic satire (the \"Deuce Bigalow\" films).\n\nThe portrayal of the client or \"john\" of male prostitution in popular culture is far less codified than that of the hustler and runs the gamut from the lonely married man, the self-hating in-the-closet guy, the exploitative or endearing businessman, and even the serial killer.\n\nThe diversity of these stereotypes reveals much about each author's or director's personal view of love, sexuality, power and morality.\n\nThese stereotypes may have a basis in fact, but they should not be taken as true in all cases.\n\nThe same issues that surround male prostitution (including the financial security and social status of the young \"kept\" lover, the older lover's obsessions and insecurities with regards to his or her youthful love-object, the sexual freedom or moral indifference of the hustler, etc.) often appear in movies and literature that portray amorous or sexual relationships—without prostitution—between an older man or woman and a younger male lover, for example, in Pasolini's novel and movie \"Theorem\", Harold Prince's film \"Something For Everyone\" (1970) and Bill Condon's film \"Gods and Monsters\" (1998).\n\nThe following novels, memoirs, and plays feature male hustlers as major characters.\n\n\nThe following television programs feature a hustler as a main character:\n\nThe following photographers, in their work, frequently use the image of the male prostitute:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28029977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28029977", "title": "Milk chugging", "text": "Milk chugging\n\nMilk chugging, or the gallon challenge or milk challenge, is the process of consuming a large amount of milk within a set period of time. Although there are variations in procedure, the general parameters are that a person is given 60 minutes to drink of whole milk without vomiting. A gallon milk jug is a common size of milk container in the United States.\n\nThe first recorded occurrences of competitive milk chugging date back to early 1997 where there are several explanations for the origins of the challenge. It certainly existed prior to that, however. American baseball pitcher Bill Lee mentioned the challenge in his autobiography \"The Wrong Stuff\" as one of the activities that relief pitchers used to pass the time in the bullpen as far back as the late 1960s. Undoubtedly, the most highly publicized competition was one that was featured in episode five of season two of the American television series \"Jackass\", where Dave England and Ehren McGhehey were featured in a gallon challenge segment. Filmed in Portland, Oregon in 2000, contestants were to consume one gallon of milk in an hour in a variety of flavors, which resulted in each participant vomiting. In 1999 North Carolina legislators started a yearly milk-drinking contest to promote the dairy industry.\n\nMilk chugging has gained popularity and a following in some countries, especially the United States. The fact that it is often presented as being \"impossible\", as well as media coverage of the challenge, may have led to the appeal among high school and college students, as well as celebrities.\n\nThe primary difficulty in completing the challenge lies in the limited capacity of the stomach. Generally, the stomach can hold only half a gallon (). Stretch receptors in the organ sense when its limit is reached, triggering a vomit reflex that swiftly empties the stomach. Moreover, drinking a gallon of milk is more difficult than drinking a gallon of water. The fat and protein in milk each inhibit the stomach from releasing its contents into the small intestine, forcing more of the liquid to remain in the stomach. In turn, the action of gastric acid and proteases in the stomach cause proteins in the milk to unravel and expand the liquid into a thick semi-solid substance, further reducing the amount of fluid that can be held in the stomach without being regurgitated.\n\nIt is often claimed that the difficulty of retaining milk is related to lactose intolerance: the inability of many people to metabolize lactose, a major component of milk. Sarah Ash, an associate professor of nutrition at North Carolina State University, finds this theory unlikely, as the symptoms of lactose intolerance occur in the large intestine, rather than the stomach.\n\nThere are three universal rules in what has been called the \"gallon challenge\", although some minor variations may exist.\n\nAlthough in almost all cases, the challenge is set for one gallon, in some cases a different amount is used, such as . Other variations of the challenge require that the contestant eat nothing during the hour of ingestion, and specify that the type of milk chosen must have at least a 2% fat content (not skimmed milk).\n\nMany high school and college students hold their own challenges: Phi Delta Tau, at the Central College in Pella, Iowa have traditionally hosted an annual gallon challenge, four Rutgers fraternities host challenges for fundraisers, some MIT students celebrated the 2010 4th of July with a challenge, Sigma Phi Epsilon at Carnegie Mellon University host their Annual Gallon Challenge on campus, as well as many other official and unofficial gallon challenges. In 2008, several members of a fraternity at Arizona State University participating in a \"milk-chug\" were arrested for causing a car accident after vomiting into traffic below the bridge they were competing on.\n\nPeter Ubriaco founded the non-profit Gallon Challenge Foundation in 2004, formalizing a local gallon-challenge contest held since 2000. The organization raised donations during the yearly challenge for food and health-related organizations; after their 2006 challenge in held in New York City, they donated to the Food Allergy Initiative, a non-profit organization that raises awareness and funds for the treatment and cure of food allergies.\n\nThe act of milk-chugging has also been the centerpiece for a photographer and artists' show in 2005, where he featured an image entitled \"Milk Chuggers\" and a video called \"The Milk Chugger\", where he films himself drinking milk until he vomits.\nIn 2009, Jimmy Fallon held a milk-chugging contest on NBC's \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\", with guests Hélio Castroneves, Ryan Briscoe and Dario Franchitti. On the broadcast, Fallon wore a rain poncho and drank chocolate milk, while the drivers drank regular milk. Also in 2009, and again in 2010, North Carolina members of the General Assembly, which included Bob Atwater, William Brisson, Andrew Brock, Dewey Hill, Joe Sam Queen and Arthur Williams, competed in a milk-chugging contest, held at North Portico of the Legislative Building in Raleigh, to raise awareness in the dairy industry. Winners of the contest would receive money to donate to a charity of their choice. In 2012, it was a major part of the plot of the \"Regular Show\" episode \"Guy's Night\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1663920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1663920", "title": "Old Strathcona", "text": "Old Strathcona\n\nOld Strathcona is an historic district in south-central Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Once the commercial core of the separate city of Strathcona, the area is now home to many of Edmonton's arts and entertainment facilities, as well as a local shopping hub for residents and students at the nearby University of Alberta. Many of the area's businesses are owner-operated but, chains have also made inroads. A good proportion of Edmonton's theatres and live-performance venues are also in the area. The district centres on Whyte (82) Avenue and has shops, restaurants, bars and buskers.\n\nIn 2007, Old Strathcona was named Alberta's second Provincial Historic Area. The district comprises an area of five city blocks from 85 Avenue south to 80 Avenue and from 102 Street west to 106 street.\n\nThe Old Strathcona and Area Business Revitalization Zone (BRZ) is a roughly cross-shaped business revitalization zone, extending along Whyte Avenue from just west of 109 Street in the west, to just east of 99 Street in the east, and along Gateway Boulevard from 86 Avenue in the north to University Avenue in the south.\n\nOld Strathcona was once a municipality separate from Edmonton, achieving town status in 1899 and city status in 1907. The City of Strathcona amalgamated with Edmonton in 1912.\n\nA large part of Whyte Avenue's popularity is the historical character of its buildings, many of which are one hundred years old. The oldest building is the Strathcona Hotel, built by the railway when it arrived in 1891. Early construction used mostly wood, but this changed in 1902 when the Town of Strathcona passed a bylaw requiring brick buildings in the downtown core to prevent a major fire. Many of the current brick buildings were erected during the 1910–1912 boom that brought thousands of settlers from eastern Canada, Britain and continental Europe, U.S. and other parts of the world. Whyte Avenue in the early 1890s was dominated by primitive shack homes and quickly-built pioneer stores. These early structures were soon replaced by more substantial wood-frame two-storey buildings or, in the case of the Ross Block, by a brick building even before the town's anti-fire bylaw.\n\nIn 2005, Edmonton City Council sent a letter to the Province of Alberta requesting heritage status for the area, and the new status of Provincial Heritage Area in 2007.\n\nOld Strathcona is Alberta's second Provincial Historic Area (downtown Fort Macleod being the first), and has a number of historic buildings.\n\nThe designation as a Provincial Historic Area applies to roughly 5 square blocks that formed the commercial hub of the former city of Strathcona. It runs from 85 Avenue south to 80 Avenue and from 102 Street west to 106 Street. Within this area are many of the most significant buildings from Strathcona's early boom from the arrival of the Calgary and Edmonton Railway in 1891 to the Edmonton real estate crash of 1913–14. Heritage buildings within this area include the Strathcona Hotel, the Gainers Block, the Orange Hall, the Canadian Pacific Railway Station, the South Side Post Office, the Douglas Block, the Princess Theatre, the Strathcona Public Library, the Connaught Armoury, and Old Scona Academic High School.\n\nOutside of the Provincial Heritage Area in the wider Old Strathcona area are several non-commercial buildings that are also protected as heritage buildings including churches and residences. Within the Edmonton-Strathcona provincial electoral district, which covers most of the former City of Strathcona, there are 18 Provincial Historic Resources and 11 Registered Historic Resources recognized by the Government of Alberta, and 14 Municipal Restoric Resources recognized by the City of Edmonton (some buildings are on both registers).\n\nAfter amalgamation of the cities of Strathcona and Edmonton, Strathcona went into an economic slump and little re-development occurred, allowing many of area's old buildings to continue to the present day. In the 1970s, Edmonton city council bought many properties along 104 Street in preparation for a freeway through the historic area. A \"Save-the-district\" movement emerged and the plan was abandoned. Old Strathcona then became more Bohemian in tone, as well as performing its historic purpose of supplying goods and services to local residents, students at nearby University of Alberta, and residents of the nearby County of Strathcona whose county offices would first be located in Old Strathcona\n\nThe Strathcona Hotel, the first building built after the arrival of the railway that had established the hamlet of South Edmonton in 1891 (leading to the town and city of Strathcona) has been in operation ever since (excepting the period of Prohibition, 1916-1923), and other bars were never absent from the district. However, in the 1990s, many new bars were established in Whyte Avenue buildings that had previously held offices and shops. The area's night-time ambience began to change dramatically. The area has attracted media attention over the years for its revelry.\n\nOver time, the area has become the premier entertainment strip in Edmonton and is the locale for events such as the Edmonton International Fringe Festival. Although it has lacked alternative music venues since the 1990s heyday, there is a strong revival of music venues on Whyte Avenue with several offering live entertainment for various genres. The primary location for clubs and nightlife is on Whyte Avenue between 99 and 109 Streets, with the majority of clubs directly on Whyte Avenue or on adjacent side streets.\n\nWhyte Avenue arguably remains the centre of Edmonton's alternative lifestyles, containing various independent clothing and other types of shops catering to a variety of alternative subcultures (ranging from hippie to raver to goth etc.). Clothing is the fastest growing business trend in the area, with retailers all along the avenue. Old Strathcona was a bastion of small, local and independent business.\n\nThere are a number of restaurants in this area, many locally owned. Several of the bars also have kitchens. In total, there are almost 100 places to eat in Old Strathcona.\n\nOld Strathcona is home to a vibrant independent theatre scene, with nine theatre companies operating out of several buildings in the neighbourhood, including the Varscona Theatre, ATB Financial Arts Barns, Northern Light Theatre, The Walterdale Playhouse and Roxy on Gateway. The Varscona Theatre alone is home to several award-winning companies: Shadow Theatre, Teatro la Quindicina, Plain Jane Theatre Company, the variety show That's Terrific!, and improvisation troupe Die-Nasty. Every August, Old Strathcona plays host to the Edmonton International Fringe Festival, the largest and oldest Fringe Theatre event in North America. Edmonton historian Lawrence Herzog has called the diversity of material being produced in the Old Strathcona Theatre District \"wide and astonishing.\"\n\nOld Strathcona is also known for its art house theatres, The Princess Theatre and the Garneau Theatre. In 2011, Edmonton's Metro Cinema Society took over management of the Garneau Theatre, while The Princess continued to be operated by Magic Lantern Theatres.\n\nOld Strathcona celebrates all year long. January brings Ice on Whyte, a sculpting competition and outdoor ice playground. June features Improvaganza, an invitational international improv festival, hosted by Rapid Fire Theatre. In mid July, the Whyte Avenue ArtWalk puts more than 230 working artists on the sidewalks of Old Strathcona, and on the final Sunday of Artwalk, Whyte Avenue closes the entire street for a massive Street Sale. In August, the Edmonton International Fringe Festival welcomes hundreds of thousands of theatre goers and festival patrons. The fall brings the Chante Festival and many events during the Edmonton Halloween festival.\n\nOld Strathcona has a year-round farmers' market that requires all vendors to be primary producers. Edmonton's market garden industry finds an average of 10,000 customers every Saturday.\nWhyte (82) Avenue is an arterial road in south-central Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. It became the main street of the City of Strathcona as it formed, and now runs through Old Strathcona. It was named in 1891 after Sir William Whyte, who was superintendent of the CPR's western division from 1886 to 1897 and was knighted by King George V in 1911. Whyte (82) Avenue is part of a continuous roadway that runs through Sherwood Park, Edmonton, and St. Albert that includes Wye Road, Sherwood Park Freeway, portions of University Avenue and Saskatchewan Drive, Groat Road, and St. Albert Trail.\n\nThe roadway was originally the core of the former city of Strathcona and was the division between the north and south quadrants while \"Main Street\", now 104 Street (Calgary Trail) and was the division between the west and east quadrants. In 1912, Edmonton and Strathcona amalgamated Edmonton adopted its present numbering system; Whyte Avenue was co-designated \"82 Avenue\" which allowed it to keep both names. As Alberta's highway system developed, Whyte Avenue became part of Highway 1 (renumbered to Highway 2 in 1941) between 104 Street and 109 Street while it was part of Highway 14 east of 104 Street. The highway designations were moved to Whitemud Drive in the 1980s.\n\nA small section of 82 Avenue exists as a collector road between 71 Street and 50 Street, where the main roadway transitions to the Sherwood Park Freeway.\n\nThe Blue Mile or the Copper Kilometre is the name given by the local media to the Old Strathcona District's Whyte Avenue during the Edmonton Oilers 2006 Stanley Cup playoff run, since it closely resembled the events which took place on the Red Mile in Calgary two years prior.\n\nFollowing the Edmonton Oilers upset victory over the Detroit Red Wings in the first round of the 2006 playoffs, several thousand Oiler fans flocked to Whyte Avenue and turned the district into a hockey party strip, as Oiler fans walked the streets cheering, chanting, high-fiving, horn-honking, and flag-waving for their team. Others surfed the crowd in a grocery-shopping cart, and still others climbed trees and traffic lights.\n\nWhyte Avenue in Edmonton gained national attention for its level of violence in May 2006. The arrests at the Blue Mile are estimated at least 350 people through the Oilers Stanley Cup playoff run, including breaching the public peace, assaults, impaired driving, mischief, and alcohol-related offences. This rowdy behaviour led the mayor of Edmonton, Stephen Mandel, to threaten to close down the strip: \"I hope this doesn't come down to having to shut down Whyte completely...but this will not be tolerated going into the final series.\"\n\nList of neighbourhoods Whyte (82) Avenue runs through, in order from west to east:\n\nStarting at the west end of University Avenue.\n\n"}

The character races are rather unusual in RPGs and include Bionecrons, Symbions and various cross-breeds between humans, animals and mechanical entities.\n\nThe gameplay concerns juggling through the set of screens which are responsible for different parts of the game, such as exploring the dungeon and a world map, inventory management, spell creation (using a sophisticated runic system), network connections (used also for conversation purposes) and battle mode (a bit archaic, turn-based system). Everything is controlled from a set of icons.\n\nThe game has 16-bit graphics which are mostly in grey and orange shades. The sound and music are conducted with attention to details, and the music changes depending on the action on the screen.\n\nThe game entirely was created by only three people: Gyula Szentirmay (coder), Edvard Toth (graphic designer) and Zoltan Vech (musician). The whole management over the project was in hands of Edvard Toth who was responsible for the artwork, design, concept and story (in-game script and dialogue is big in size for almost 80 pages of written text). Many of these three people would later help create the real-time strategy title \"Theocracy\". \n\n"}
{"id": "1024792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1024792", "title": "Police Story 3: Super Cop", "text": "Police Story 3: Super Cop\n\nPolice Story 3: Super Cop (), also known as Super Cop in North America, is a 1992 Hong Kong action comedy film starring Jackie Chan and Michelle Yeoh. Jackie reprises his \"Kevin\" Chan Ka-Kui character, a Hong Kong cop from \"Police Story\" and \"Police Story 2\". It is the first in the \"Police Story\" series not to be directed by Jackie, with Stanley Tong taking over the helm. It is also the last appearance in the series for Maggie Cheung as Jackie's girlfriend, May.\n\nKa-Kui is the \"supercop\" of the Hong Kong police, with amazing martial arts skills. He is sent to Guangzhou, where the Chinese police force's Interpol director, Inspector Jessica Yang (Michelle Yeoh), briefs him on his next assignment. The target is Chaibat, a drug lord based in Hong Kong. To infiltrate Chaibat's organization, Ka-Kui is to get close to Chaibat's henchman Panther, who is in a Chinese prison. Ka-Kui, posing as a petty criminal prisoner, manages Panther's escape with the connivance of the guards. Grateful Panther invites Ka-Kui to go with him to Hong Kong and join Chaibat's gang. Panther meets up with some of his other men, and vouches for Ka-Kui. The group heads for Hong Kong.\n\nOn the way, they pass through Ka-Kui's supposed home village, and Panther insists that Ka-Kui visit his family there. He does not actually know anyone in the village, but is pleasantly relieved to be greeted by undercover police posing as his family, with Yang as his sister. The local police pretend to arrest Ka-Kui in a restaurant, but Ka-Kui and Yang (also a martial-arts expert) escape after a big fight, which concludes with the faked killing of a policeman. This confirms Panther's trust in them.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Chaibat welcomes Ka-Kui and Yang to his luxurious hide-out. He takes them with him to a big opium grower's fortified compound in the Golden Triangle of Thailand, for a meeting of big-time heroin traffickers. During the meeting, Chaibat's gang attack from outside while Ka-Kui and Yang protect him inside. In a huge gun battle, Chaibat's gang kill the rival traffickers and their guards, and smash up the compound. The grower survives, but will now sell only to Chaibat at Chaibat's price.\n\nThe action then shifts to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where Chaibat's wife, Chen Wen-Shi, is in prison, facing the death penalty for an unspecified crime. Chaibat needs to get her out of prison, because only she knows the secret codes to his Swiss bank account, and will not reveal them to him unless freed. Chaibat brings his gang, now including Ka-Kui and Yang, to Kuala Lumpur to stage a jailbreak.\n\nA new difficulty arises when Ka-Kui sees his girlfriend May, a tour guide, in Kuala Lumpur leading a party of Hong Kong tourists. He has told her he's on assignment. Ka-Kui evades May at first, but she sees him at the luxurious hotel where Chaibat's gang are staying, with the beautiful Yang, and confronts him in a jealous rage. This nearly blows Ka-Kui's cover, but Panther is persuaded that May is angry because Ka-Kui tried to proposition her as a prostitute. Later, Ka-Kui gets May alone and explains the situation, and she finally calms down. At one point, May even manages to keep Ka-Kui from inadvertently blowing his own cover. But then, in an elevator, May tells a co-worker about Ka-Kui, and is overheard by one of Panther's men. Chaibat takes May hostage, and forces Ka-Kui and Yang – their cover now blown – to help free Chen.\n\nChaibat's scheme is successful and May is released, as per their agreement. However, the exchange turns sour when Chaibat pushes May from his helicopter, though she survives. Furious, Ka-Kui and Yang pursue Chaibat and his men over the roads, rooftops (where Ka-Kui and Yang defeat Panther and his partner), and skies of Kuala Lumpur. In the climax on top of a speeding train, Chaibat is killed after his helicopter collides with a bridge and lands on him. Yang and Ka-Kui also recapture Chen. Since her husband is dead, she decides to tell Yang and Ka-Kui the password to Chaibat's bank account. The two partners argue whether Hong Kong or China will get the money.\n\n\nA significant aspect of this film is that it was the first Jackie Chan film from Hong Kong to use sync sound, allowing all the actors' voices to be recorded as they spoke on scene, rather than dubbed over by different actors later.\n\nExterior scenes were filmed in Hong Kong Island, Shanghai and Kuala Lumpur. Interior scenes were shot in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nAccording to his book \"I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action\", Chan dislocated his cheekbone during a stunt scene.\n\n\n\"Police Story 3\" grossed HK$32,609,783 in its Hong Kong theatrical run.\n\nAfter the North American success of \"Rumble in the Bronx\", \"Police Story 3\" was released in North America on 25 July 1996 under the shorter title, \"Supercop\". Opening at 1,406 theatres, it grossed US$5,503,176 ($3,914 per screen), on its way to a total gross of US$16,270,600.\n\n\nThe North American release by Dimension was well received.\n\nJames Berardinelli of website ReelViews wrote:\n\"As is usual in a Chan film, the end credits (which show out-takes of failed stunts) are one of \"Supercop\"s highlights. There are more laughs in this hilarious three-minute sequence than in the whole of \"Kingpin\". I can't think of a better reason to stay through the entire movie. Ultimately, the closing montage points out one of the chief differences between Chan's stylized, fast-paced films and those of his American counterparts: this is action with a smile, not a grimace.\"\n\nIn the \"Washington Post\", Richard Harrington said:\n\"Chan seems to have met his soul mate in Khan [Yeoh's credited name], Asia's top female action star. Like Chan, Khan does her own fighting and stunts. Unlike the Hollywood action contingent, Chan and Khan don't rely on cinematic trickery. Theirs are not special effects, just spectacular ones. Connoisseurs will find Chan's helicopter-train chase far riskier, more exciting and more believable than its mates in \"\" and \"The Living Daylights\".\"\n\nThe U.S. version of the film received a \"Certified Fresh\" rating of 96% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nFurthermore, in 2009, director Quentin Tarantino named \"Police Story III\" as one of his favorite films of the past seventeen years. He stated that \"Supercop\" features the \"greatest stunts ever filmed in any movie ever.\" In 2016 during a roundtable discussion, when asked which movie scene he would love to save for the last of humanity to see, he named the final scene of the movie as his choice. \nIn 2014, \"Time Out\" polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films. \"Police Story 3: Super Cop\" was listed at 75th place on this list.\n\nThe Dimension Films version, which was distributed theatrically in North America in 1996, was retitled \"Supercop\", and was dubbed into American English with the participation of Jackie Chan and Michelle Yeoh.\n\nAmong the changes was the addition of a new score. Tom Jones' rendition of \"Kung Fu Fighting\" plays over the end credits, followed by a song specially written and performed for the film by the band Devo, entitled \"Supercop\".\n\nThis release was cut by approximately 10 minutes. These cuts include:\n\n\nMichelle Yeoh went on to star in a 1993 spin-off called \"Once a Cop\" or \"Project S\". Though it features a cameo appearance by Jackie Chan and Bill Tung reprises his role as \"Uncle\" Bill, this film is not a proper part of the \"Police Story\" series. Confusingly, some releases of this film were also entitled \"Supercop\" or \"Supercop 2\". In most Asian territories it was called \"Project S\", under which title the most comprehensive DVD was released by MIA.\n\nThe film inspired two missions in the 2004 videogame , both of which were taken from the film's final scenes. The game's last mission, \"End of The Line\", where C.J must chase a firetruck with a red open-top car and catch Sean \"Sweet\" Johnson was taken from the scene where Jackie must chase a van using a red open-top car to catch Jessica Yang (Michelle Yeoh).\n\nThe mission \"Wrong Side of The Tracks\", where the player must follow a train from a dirt bike was taken from the scene where Jessica Yang (Michelle Yeoh) follows the train on a similar dirt bike.\n\nA soundtrack containing alternative rock and hip hop was released on 30 July 1996 by Interscope Records. It peaked at #133 on the \"Billboard\" 200.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "629472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=629472", "title": "Rights of way in England and Wales", "text": "Rights of way in England and Wales\n\nIn England and Wales, other than in the 12 Inner London Boroughs and the City of London, the \"right of way\" refers to paths on which the public have a legally protected right to pass and re-pass. The law in England and Wales differs from Scots law in that rights of way only exist where they are so designated (or are able to be designated if not already), whereas in Scotland any route that meets certain conditions is defined as a right of way, and in addition there is a general presumption of access to the countryside (\"right to roam\"). Private rights of way or easements also exist (see also Highways in England and Wales).\n\nDefinitive maps of public rights of way have been compiled for all of England and Wales, as a result of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, except the 12 Inner London boroughs, which, along with the City of London, were not covered by the Act. Definitive maps exist for the Outer London boroughs.\n\nTo protect the existing rights of way in London, the Ramblers launched their \"Putting London on the Map\" in 2010, with the aim of getting \"the same legal protection for paths in the capital as already exists for footpaths elsewhere in England and Wales. Currently, legislation allows the Inner London boroughs to choose to produce definitive maps if they wish, but none do so\".\n\nThe launch event of \"Putting London on the Map\" took place at the British Library, and since then the 'Inner London Area' of the Ramblers has been working with Ramblers Central Office staff to try to persuade each of the Inner London boroughs of the desirability of producing definitive maps of rights of way\".\n\nIn 2011 Lambeth Council passed a resolution to work towards creating a definitive map for their borough, but this does not yet exist. The City of London has produced a Public Access Map.\n\nIn England and Wales a \"public footpath\" is a path on which the public have a legally protected right to travel on foot and in some areas public footpaths form a dense network of short paths. It is probable that most footpaths in the countryside are hundreds of years old. The majority of footpaths are shown on Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 and 1:50,000 maps.\n\nLocal highways authorities (usually county councils or unitary authorities) are required to maintain the definitive map of all public rights of way in their areas and these can be inspected at council offices. If a path is shown on the definitive map and no subsequent legal order (such as a stopping up order) exists then the right of way is conclusive in law. Just because a path is not shown on that map does not mean that it is not a public path, as the rights may not have been recorded. The Countryside Agency estimated that over 10% of public paths were not yet listed on the definitive map. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 provides that paths that are not recorded on the definitive map by 2026 and that were in use prior to 1949 will automatically be deemed stopped up on 1 January 2026.\n\nThe right of access on a public footpath normally only extends to walking (there may be other unrecorded rights as well), so there is usually no right to cycle or ride a horse on a public footpath. However, it is not a criminal offence to do so unless there is a traffic order or bylaw in place specifically: it is a civil wrong to ride a bicycle or a horse on a public footpath, and action could be taken by the landowner for trespass or nuisance by the user.\n\nThe highway right to use a right of way is restricted to passing and re-passing, associated activities, and the taking of 'usual accompaniments'. Bedford Borough Council mentions that walkers may:\n\nA \"public bridleway\" is a way over which the general public have the following, but normally (unless otherwise according to Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 s56(1)(b)) no other rights: \n\nNote that although Section 30 of the Countryside Act 1968 permits the riding of bicycles on public bridleways, the act says that it \"shall not create any obligation to facilitate the use of the bridleway by cyclists\". Thus, the right to cycle exists even though it may be difficult to exercise on occasion. Cyclists using a bridleway are obliged to give way to other users on foot or horseback.\n\nPublic bridleways are shown on Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 and 1:50,000 maps, but many public bridleways (as well as \"roads used as public paths\", \"byways open to all traffic\" and \"restricted byways\") were recorded as footpaths only as a result of the burden of maintenance required by the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and so are now wrongly recorded on the definitive map. Definitive Map Modification Orders are needed to correct these errors.\n\nA \"byway open to all traffic (or BOAT)\" is a highway over which the general public have a right to travel for vehicular and all other kinds of traffic, but which is used by the public mainly as footpaths and bridleways are used, per Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, section 15(9)(c), as amended by Road Traffic (Temporary Restrictions) Act 1991, Schedule 1.\n\nAfter the 2006 Regulations to the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, BOATs should now more properly be referred to simply as byways.\n\nA \"road used as public path (RUPP)\" was one of the three types of public right of way (along with footpaths and bridleways) introduced by the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. The Countryside Act 1968 required all highway authorities to reclassify RUPPs in their area – occasionally as public footpaths but in practice generally as public bridleways unless public vehicular rights were demonstrated to exist in which case it would become a 'byway open to all traffic'.\n\nThis process was slow as it involved research into historic usage and often public enquiries, and so was not completed by the time the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 was passed. This reclassified all remaining RUPPs as 'restricted byways' on 2 May 2006.\n\nOn 2 May 2006 the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 reclassified all remaining Roads Used as Public Paths as \"restricted byways\". The public's rights along a restricted byway are to travel:\n\nA permissive path, permitted path or concessionary path is a path (which could be for walkers, riders, cyclists, or any combination) whose use is allowed by the landowner. It would normally be a path that is not at the time on the definitive map of public rights of way but that does not prevent it from already being a public path for any or all of those user categories mentioned. For instance it might be a historic route fallen into disuse or it might have been used for twenty years 'as of right' by the public, in both cases being a public right of way which is not yet shown on the definitive map. Some permissive footpaths and bridleways are shown on 1:25,000 and 1:50,000 scale Ordnance Survey maps.\n\nA permissive path is often closed on a specified calendar day each year (lawful only if it is not already a public right of way of some description), and clearly signed (e.g. signpost or waymark) as permissive. The act of so closing or signing it ensures that any future use of it does not count towards the 20 years' use 'as of right' needed to establish its public status. These are precautions to prevent it becoming designated as a statutory right of way in relation to its permitted use.\n\nUnder the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 the public also has a right to walk away from rights of way on designated \"access land\". This right is in addition to rights of way, and does not extend to horse-riders or cyclists. Access land may be closed for up to 28 days per year, whereas rights of way must remain open at all times, except in exceptional circumstances with special permission of the local authority.\n\nA footpath, bridleway or restricted byway can be created by one of the following means.\n\nIn England and Wales, a footpath, bridleway or restricted byway may be expressly dedicated by the owner as a public right of way. Furthermore, unchallenged use by the public, as of right, for at least 20 years, may give rise to a presumption of dedication under Section 31 of the Highways Act 1980. A presumption of dedication may arise under common law after any appropriate period of time, by way of a presumed deed that has been lost; known as the doctrine of \"modern lost grant\". Paths created by express dedication since 1949 are \"not\" automatically maintainable at the public expense as a result of s.49 National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949.\n\nSection 25 of the Highways Act 1980 allows a local authority (that is, a district or county council, or a unitary authority) to enter into an agreement (known as a 'public path creation agreement') with a relevant landowner to create a footpath or bridleway over land in their area. The local authority has to consult any other local authority in whose area the path will be, but does not have to consult wider. There is no provision for anyone else to be consulted or to object. The agreement must be advertised in the local paper, and the route is automatically maintainable at public expense.\n\nSection 30 of the Highways Act 1980 allows a parish council (community council in Wales) to enter into an agreement with a relevant landowner to create a footpath, bridleway or restricted byway over land in their area or in an adjacent parish. The parish council is under no obligation to consult anyone. All they have to do is reach an agreement with the landowner. There is no provision for anyone else to be consulted or to object. The path is not automatically maintainable at the public expense.\n\nSection 26 of the Highways Act 1980 allows a local authority (that is, a district or county council, or a unitary authority) to make an order to create a footpath or bridleway over land in their area. If there are no objections, the local authority can confirm the order themselves, so bringing the path into effect. However, where objections have been made, the order will need to be considered by an inspector from the Planning Inspectorate. Depending on the number and nature of the objections, he may consider the order after an exchange of written representations between the authority and the objectors, after holding a hearing, or after a public local inquiry. People who would like to use the path should submit letters saying why they need the path.\n\nSection 228 of the Highways Act 1980 is mainly used by the street works authority (county council or unitary authority) to declare a street to be a highway maintainable at public expense. The street works authority has to perform works on the route. Such street works need only be appropriate to the type of highway to which the notice relates. So for a potential bridleway, if the grass is cut, or a hedge cut back, this could constitute street works for the purpose of this section, so enabling it to be used. The authority then places s.228 \"Adoption of Streets\" notices at each end of the route. Only the owner of a street (or if more than one, the majority of the owners) has the power to object. If there is an objection, the street works authority can either discontinue, or it can go to the magistrates' court. A path created by this method will be maintainable at the public expense. Hampshire County Council has used this method for footpaths, and Essex County Council often uses it for new bridleways.\n\nEach highway authority in England and Wales (other than Transport for London, the City of London and Inner London boroughs) was required to produce a Rights of Way Improvement Plan under sections 60 to 62 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 within five years of the date on which Section 60 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act came into force; this deadline was 21 November 2007. Each highway authority is required to review their Rights of Way Improvement Plan at least every ten years.\n\n\n\n"}

The event challenges local filmmakers to create a five-minute short film from scratch over the course of 48 hours from Friday-Sunday, usually during the month of April. No production may take place before an inspiration package is distributed at the kick-off event. Each film entry must then be conceived, written, directed, edited, output, and delivered directly to the festival heads within the specified 48-hour period. Late turn-ins are accepted for screening if they meet the inspiration package criteria but are ineligible for any award nominations.\n\nThe short films & accompanying posters are then premiered and showcased at a local theatre, and are later evaluated by an international panel of judges who decide which films receive awards and nominations.\n\nAt the launch event, the organizers provide to each team an “inspiration package” which contains specific elements the film must include.

{"id": "2731819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2731819", "title": "San Francisco Sound", "text": "San Francisco Sound\n\nThe San Francisco Sound refers to rock music performed live and recorded by San Francisco-based rock groups of the mid-1960s to early 1970s. It was associated with the counterculture community in San Francisco during these years. San Francisco is a westward-looking port city, a city that at the time was 'big enough' but not manic like New York City or spread out like Los Angeles. Hence, it could support a 'scene'. According to journalist Ed Vulliamy, \"A core of Haight Ashbury bands played with each other, for each other, for free and at Chet Helms's Avalon Ballroom and Bill Graham's Fillmore.\"\n\nThe Bay-Area-based jazz critic and columnist Ralph J. Gleason had established the first journal (\"Jazz Information\") devoted to jazz, in 1939. Gleason was open to new pathways. He admired San Francisco's new music scene in the mid-1960s, and wanted to draw attention to it. According to an announcer for a TV show that Gleason hosted: \"In his syndicated newspaper column, Mr. Gleason has been the foremost interpreter of the sounds coming out of what he calls 'the Liverpool of the United States.' Mr. Gleason believes the San Francisco rock groups are making a serious contribution to musical history.\" \nThe first serious journal of rock music, \"Crawdaddy\", had been founded in the eastern U.S. in 1966 by Paul Williams. However, Ralph Gleason, shortly after the Monterey Pop Festival, became one of the founders of what would become the nation's dominant rock-scene fan journal, \"Rolling Stone\".\n\nThe new sound, which melded many musical influences, was perhaps heralded in the live performances of the Jefferson Airplane (from 1965 on), who put out an LP record earlier than nearly all the other new bands (September 1966). According to writer Douglas Brinkley, celebrated author Hunter S. Thompson, one of the Bay Area cultural-scene boosters, was a big early fan of the group: \"Thompson extolled the sonic energy of the Jefferson Airplane as it pulsed around the California locales that nursed the psychedelic era...\"\n\nThe bohemian predecessor of the hippie culture in San Francisco was the \"Beat Generation\" style of coffee houses and bars, whose clientele appreciated literature, a game of chess, music (in the forms of jazz and folk style), modern dance, and traditional crafts and arts like pottery and painting. Acoustic music had had an avid following far and wide, but it was \"a fading world of traditional folk and Brechtian art songs.\" The entire tone of the \"new\" subculture was different. According to biography author Robert Greenfield, \"Jon McIntire [manager of the Grateful Dead from the late sixties to the mid-eighties] points out that the great contribution of the hippie culture was this projection of joy. The beatnik thing was black, cynical, and cold.\" The new music was loud and community-connected: bands sometimes presented free concerts in Golden Gate Park and \"happenings\" at the city's several psychedelic clubs and ballrooms. The many bands that formed signalled a shift from one subculture to the next.\n\nMonterey, California is about 120 road miles south of San Francisco. At the June 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, Bay Area groups (Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead, and Big Brother and The Holding Company) performed from the same stage as established and fast-rising musical groups and well-known individual artists from the U.S., England, and even India. Soon after, Ralph J. Gleason and Jann Wenner, based in San Francisco, established \"Rolling Stone\" magazine (first issue's date: November 1967).\nEach San Francisco band had its characteristic sound, but enough commonalities existed that there was a regional identity. By 1967, fresh and adventurous improvisation during live performance (which many heard as being epitomized by the Grateful Dead and by the \"cross-talk\" guitar work of Moby Grape) was one characteristic of the San Francisco Sound. A louder, more prominent role for the electric bass—typically with a melodic or semi-melodic approach, and using a plush, pervasive tone—was another feature. This questing bass quality has been wryly characterized as a \"roving\" (rather than the conventional \"stay-at-home\") style. In jazz it had been exuberantly pioneered by numerous musicians—and such bassists as Charles Mingus, Scott LaFaro, and Steve Swallow had taken it into very exploratory places. A musician who was a leading example of this, Jack Casady of Jefferson Airplane (and the offshoot Hot Tuna) pioneered the approach, perhaps best represented on the album \"Bless Its Pointed Little Head\". Phil Lesh, bassist with the Grateful Dead, furthered this sound. Lesh had developed his style on the foundation of having studied classical, brass-band, jazz, and modernist music on the violin and later the trumpet.\n\nExploration of chordal progressions previously uncommon in rock & roll, and a freer and more powerful use of all instruments (drums and other percussion, electric guitars, keyboards, as well as the bass) went along with this \"psychedelic-era\" music. Brasses and reeds, such as trumpets and saxophones were rarely used, unlike in contemporary R&B and soul bands and some of the white bands from the U.S. East Coast (e.g., Blood, Sweat & Tears or Chicago). Sly & the Family Stone, a San Francisco-based group that got its start in the late 1960s, was an exception, being a racially integrated hippie band with a hefty influence from soul music, hence making use of brass instrumentation.\n\n\"Rock & roll\" was the point of departure for the new music. But well known stars of rock & roll \"were being called fifties primitives\" by this time. This was the period when \"rock\" was differentiating itself from rock & roll, partly due to the upshot of the British Invasion. In San Francisco, musical influences came in from not only London, Liverpool, and Manchester, but also included the bi-coastal American folk music revival of the 1950s and 1960s, the Chicago electric blues scene, the soul music scenes in Detroit, Memphis, and Muscle Shoals, jazz styles of various eras and regions. A number of key San Francisco rock musicians of the era cited John Coltrane and his circle of leading-edge jazz musicians as important influences.\n\nThe journalist Ed Vulliamy wrote: \"The Summer of Love had an empress, and her name was Janis Joplin.\" Women, in a few cases, enjoyed an equal status with men as stars in the San Francisco rock scene—but these few instances signaled a shift that has continued in the U.S. music scene. Both Grace Slick (singing with Jefferson Airplane) and Joplin (singing initially with Big Brother & the Holding Company) gained a substantial following locally and, before long, across the country.\n\nAnother woman singer (and songwriter), Stevie Nicks, as a child had recurrently moved in the U.S. with her family. Coming of age in the San Francisco Bay Area, she gained her first performing experience there in the '60s with Lindsey Buckingham's rock band. Eventually both Nicks and Buckingham achieved international exposure and acclaim once their California talents were absorbed into the established British rock band Fleetwood Mac in 1975.\n\nPerformances of an international super group like the Beatles were hosted in a huge venue like the Cow Palace. At first, the local Bay Area bands played in smaller ones. The early band venues, while the new SF scene was emerging from folk and folk-rock beginnings, were often places like the Matrix nightclub. As audiences grew, and audience dancing became customary, performances moved into venues with more floor space, such as the Longshoreman's Hall, the Fillmore Auditorium, the Avalon Ballroom, Winterland, and the Carousel Ballroom (which was later renamed Fillmore West). Outdoor performances, often organized by the band members themselves and their friends, also played their part.\n\nBecause San Francisco had an especially vibrant and attractive countercultural scene in the latter half of the 1960s, musicians from elsewhere (along with the famous hip multitude) came there. Some stayed and became part of the scene. Examples include the Sir Douglas Quintet, whose music took on more of the character of the San Francisco Sound, while yet retaining some of its original Texas flavor, Mother Earth, fronted by female lead singer Tracy Nelson, who relocated to the Bay Area from Nashville, and the Electric Flag, bringing Chicago blues to the Bay Area care of former Paul Butterfield Blues Band guitarist Mike Bloomfield. Steve Miller (who formed the Steve Miller Band) was from Wisconsin, by way of Chicago and New York City while bandmate Boz Scaggs originally called Texas home.\n\nThe San Francisco bands' music was everything that AM-radio pop music wasn't. Their performances contrasted with the \"standard three-minute track\" that had become a cliché of the pop-music industry, due to the requirements of AM radio, to the sound capacity of the 45 RPM record, and to the limited potentials of many pop songs and song treatments. It is true that many of the San Francisco bands did record \"three-minute\" tracks when they desired pop-music station airplay for a song. But in live performance, the bands would often share their improvisatory zest by playing a given song or sequence for as long as five or six minutes, and occasionally for as long as half an hour. In early 1967, Tom Donahue–a veteran disc jockey, rock concert producer, songwriter, and music-act manager–was inspired to revive a moribund radio station, KMPX, and inaugurate the first FM-radio rock station, in San Francisco, in order to showcase this type of music. Donahue was uniquely qualified, being savvy and enthusiastic about jazz, R&B, Soul, and ethnic music, besides the then-current rock music. An important departure in this new era of \"album oriented radio\" (AOR) was that show hosts felt free to play lengthy tracks or two or more tracks at a time from a good record album.\n\nAndrew Hallidie-Oakland\n\n\n"}

It is affiliated to the Scottish Trades Union Congress, and party to the Theatrical Management Association playwright’s agreement.\n\nThe Scottish Society of Playwrights was founded at a meeting of Scotland's playwrights held in the Netherbow Theatre in September 1973, at the instigation of Hector MacMillan, Ena Lamont Stewart, and John Hall. It was established in response to a need for a co-ordinated voice for playwrights to be heard in Scottish theatre and to act as a playwriting development and promotional agency. It was formally established, after its constitution was drafted by Ian Brown, its first Chair, Hector MacMillan and Ada F Kay in November 1973.\n\nIn the first twelve years of its existence the SSP received funding from the Scottish Arts Council. This meant that, besides such tasks as negotiating the first national contract for playwrights with the Federation of Scottish\nTheatre and representing playwrights in dispute with theatre managements, the Society was able to act as a major development agency for playwrights.\n\nDuring this period, based on the work of the US National Playwrights' Conference at the Eugene O'Neill Center, it developed the model of playwrights' workshops that is now recognised and used throughout the UK by such institutions as North West Playwrights Workshop and the Performing Arts\nLab. It also published important, but neglected, texts, offered members at-cost copying and published a Newsletter which developed in time into Scottish Theatre News. It appointed administrators, firstly Linda Haase and later Charles Hart, who provided outstanding service, Linda Haase going on to help found the Tron Theatre and Charles Hart to be New Writing Officer of the Arts Council in England.\n\nIn the mid-eighties, the Scottish Arts Council rethought its funding priorities and decided to withdraw funding from what it called 'support services' in favour of 'direct provision'. It was impervious to the fact that support for playwrights through the SSP was in fact direct provision.\n\nIn 1985, the SSP had to close down its lively and wide-ranging workshop, publishing and copying activities and concentrate on its primary role representing the playwrights of Scotland.\n\nIn 1986, with the Writers Guild and Theatre Writers Union, it negotiated its agreement with the Theatrical Management Association for the benefit of Scottish playwrights presenting work in England and Wales. Since then, it has represented the interests of playwrights throughout Scotland and abroad, leading a successful playwrights' strike in the early nineties and yet maintaining positive relations with theatre management organisations, north and south of the Border. The SSP continues to be more than simply a negotiating body. In recent years, it has, for example, held a conference in Inverness for northern based playwrights (1999) and produced the first authoritative directory of Scottish playwrights (2001).\n\nFirst Honorary vice-president, Robert McLellan.\n\n"}

Through a series of flashbacks, Louis's sessions with psychiatrist Dr. Perez (Platt) are shown. Perez asks Louis about his opinions and past, learning that Louis exhibits certain peculiar behaviors, such as a distrust of men and repeated killings of his pet hamsters, an act Louis justifies by calling it \"The Right of Disposal.\" Perez is suspicious of Louis's relationship with his father, Peter (Paul). Additional flashbacks reveal a strained relationship between Peter and Louis's mother, Natalie (Gadon), including an incident where Peter and Louis run into Peter's ex-wife during a trip to SeaWorld, resulting in a fight between Peter and Natalie. Despite Dr. Perez promising that everything Louis told him would be confidential, he tells Natalie about his concerns, causing her to end the sessions as she believes Perez is interfering with her marriage.\n\nIn the present, a doctor examining Louis after his latest accident pronounces him dead. After Louis is transported to the morgue, however, he suddenly awakes, and is placed in intensive care in a coma. Meanwhile, Peter, who has disappeared, is immediately the primary suspect in the possible attempted murder of Louis. Louis's case attracts the attention of Dr. Allan Pascal (Dornan), who is fascinated by Louis's sudden turnaround and becomes the lead doctor in charge of Louis's care. Despite Allan being married, he and Natalie share a mutual attraction, and he kisses her one-day while the two go on a walk, which is seen by everyone. As soon as this happens, Louis briefly awakens from his coma, only to mutter 'my dad' before falling back unconscious.\n\nNatalie and Allan receive threatening letters telling them to stay away from each other, with the author of said letters claiming to be Louis himself. Dalton (Parker), the lead investigator on Louis's case, believes the letters to be written by Peter. To help find the writer, everyone in the hospital submits to a handwriting test. For Natalie's protection, she is given a room in the hospital to stay in until Peter is found. Dalton warns Allan not to become involved with Natalie, telling him that not only is Peter not Louis's real father, but at one point Natalie attempted to give Louis up for adoption. Natalie confesses to Allan that Louis was the result of a rape from a different man, and despite Dalton's warnings, she and Allan have sex.\n\nLouis is visited in the hospital by his grandmother, Peter's mother Violet (Hershey). Violet, who notices Allan and Natalie's relationship, warns Allan that Natalie is unstable and manipulative, implying she has lied about multiple things including her rape. Dalton suddenly enters, informing Violet and Allan that Peter's body has been found at the bottom of a cliff, having been dead for several days.\n\nWhile all of the above is happening, Louis continues to narrate, seemingly aware of everything going on despite being in a coma. At certain points he is visited by a mysterious, deformed creature covered in seaweed, who gives him advice and encouragement. Allan also sees this creature at one point in a dream he has while sleeping by Louis's side. Louis visits the creature in a cave, and it is ultimately revealed that it is Louis's manifestation of Peter, who was found dead in a cave covered in seaweed. The Peter creature is very kind to and protective of Louis, and Louis doesn't want to leave him.\n\nOne day, while waking up from a nap, Allan is told by another doctor that not only did he sleepwalk during his nap, but he also wrote a prescription for Natalie, for dangerous doses of insulin and chloroform. This, combined with Allan's other dreams and the suspicious letters, leads Allan to believe that while he sleeps, Louis has somehow been controlling him and his actions. This is further supported when it is discovered that Allan's handwriting matches that of the threatening letters. Allan informs Dr. Perez, who decides to work with Allan to get to the bottom of the situation. He hooks Allan up to an EKG and through meditative exercises manages to directly communicate with Louis via Allan's mind and voice.\n\nLouis reveals what happened during the picnic: Natalie tries to give Louis some candy but refuses to allow Peter to have any, making Peter suspicious about Natalie possibly harming Louis and leading to a fight. Louis flees to the cliff edge, while Natalie and Peter follow and get into a scuffle, which ends when Natalie pushes Peter off the cliff to his death. Louis sees this and despite Natalie's pleas, walks off the edge of the cliff on his own in an apparent suicide attempt.\n\nAt this point, Louis's heartbeat suddenly stops and Allan wakes up. While Allan tries to revive him with a defibrillator, it is shown that Natalie is responsible for Louis's 'accidents', having done things such as poison his candy, electrocute him while near a socket, and smother him with a pillow. Allan succeeds in restarting Louis's heart while Natalie looks on.\n\nSome time later, Allan moves out after separating from his wife. He visits Natalie, who has been placed in a psychiatric ward under Dr. Perez's care. Perez explains to Allan that he has diagnosed Natalie with Munchausen syndrome by proxy, and her multiple abuses of Louis were her attempts to grow closer to him by 'saving' him from near-death situations, which she herself put him in. It is shown that Natalie is now pregnant, presumably with Allan's child.\n\nIn a final narration, Louis ponders the fact that his mother was 'the bad one' and whether being in a coma forever is bad, as it allows him to stay with his father. Peter's voice, however, tells Louis that the world is beautiful and he needs to grow up and live his life. Louis finally awakens from his coma, and the film ends.\n\nIn August 2014, Jamie Dornan joined the cast of the film, with Alexandre Aja directing from a screenplay by Max Minghella adapted from the book, who will produce alongside Tim Bricknell under their Antcolony Films banner. In September 2014, Aaron Paul, Sarah Gadon, Oliver Platt, Molly Parker, Barbara Hershey, and Aiden Longworth all joined the cast of the film.\n\nIn May 2016, Soda Pictures acquired UK distribution rights to the film. In June 2016, Summit Entertainment acquired distribution rights to the film and set the film for a limited September 2, 2016 release. The film was released in the United Kingdom on September 2, 2016.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 40%, based on 57 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"The 9th Life of Louis Drax\" is intriguing and visually compelling, but its disparate parts are never truly woven into a satisfying whole.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 41 out of 100, based on 20 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\n"}

The revue has music by Dick Gallagher and lyrics by co-conceiver, sketch writer and director Mark Waldrop. The revue opened Off-Broadway in 1996 and ran for two years, and received the Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Off-Broadway Musical and the Drama Desk Award for Best Musical Revue.\n\nThe revue opened Off-Broadway on August 14, 1996 at the Douglas Fairbanks Theatre, and closed on August 15, 1998 after 840 performances. Directed by Mark Waldrop with costumes by Howard Crabtree, the cast included Stanley Bojarski, John Treacy Egan, David Pevsner, Jay Rogers, and Michael West. The title of the show derives from Crabtree's school counselor, who said that Crabtree's ambition to \"put on stage shows\" would happen \"when pigs fly.\"\n\nCrabtree died on June 28, 1996. Waldrop noted \"It's a show...inspired by costumes--and, just by extension, the exuberance of Howard's spirit and his desire to just put it out there... Without Howard, it's inconceivable that I would have written a gay revue.\"\n\nAn Off-Broadway revival, directed once again by Mark Waldrop, with choreography by Denis Jones and costumes by Bob Mackie, was scheduled to begin previews on October 6, 2017 and open October 30, 2017 at Stage 42. The cast was to feature Jordan Ahnquist, Taylor Crousore, Jacob Hoffman, Brian Charles Rooney and Frank Viveros. However, on October 2, 2017, the producers announced that the revival is canceled. The reason given was that \"a shortfall in the show’s investment has made it impossible for the production to continue.\"\n\nThe concept of the revue is that \"Howard\" stages a musical. As he struggles to do so, dealing with the large egos of performers or scenery gone wrong, he hears the words of his high school counselor, \"Miss Roundhole\". She sarcastically said, \"When pigs fly!\" in response to his ambitions. The characters in the revue (all played by men) appear in sketches: a song to unlikely loves (\"Torch Song #1\"); four life-sized queens from a deck of playing cards (\"You've Got to Stay in the Game\"); and dancers make a case for being yourself (\"Light in the Loafers\"). \"The Melody Barn\" is a take-off on classic summer stock themes; \"Laughing Matters,\" is a defense of fun in sad times.\n\n\"The wigs alone...are like tone poems of camp: pillowy, cartoon-land creations, threatening to lift the men beneath them somewhere, fully aloft... Crabtree's visual creations are the reason for this drag-intensive show's being.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his review for \"The New York Times\", Vincent Canby wrote that the revue is \"...an exceptionally cheerful, militantly gay new musical revue that comes close to living up to its own billing, 'the side-splitting musical extravaganza.' No sides are ever in serious danger of splitting. Yet there's enough hilarity, wit and outre humor here to evoke that era, more than 40 years ago, when bright, irreverent revues were as commonplace on Broadway as today's stately Cameron Mackintosh spectacles.\"\n\nIn the Talkin' Broadway review of a regional production in San Francisco, the reviewer wrote: \"The music by Dick Gallagher is jaunty and tuneful and lyrics by Mark Waldrop are sharp and witty. This is a real great musical comedy revue. Michael Sommers of \"The Star Ledger\" sums it up beautifully by calling it 'A Hog-Heaven of silliness.' Clive Barnes of the \"New York Post\" said 'This show is user-friendly for straights.' I totally agree with both critics.\"\n\nThe original cast recording was released by RCA Victor.\n\n\"When Pigs Fly\" won the 1997 Outer Critics Circle Awards for Off-Broadway Musical and costume design, as well as the Drama Desk Awards for Off-Broadway revue and costume design.
