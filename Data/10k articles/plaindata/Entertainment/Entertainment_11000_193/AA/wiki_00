{"id": "35519979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35519979", "title": "American Exhibition", "text": "American Exhibition\n\nThe American Exhibition was a world's fair held in West Brompton, London, in 1887 in the year of Queen Victoria's golden jubilee.\n\nSupport for an exhibition had been sought in 1886, but with a loss of support and the British government insisting that an American exhibition not compete with the Colonial and Indian Exhibition, the American Exhibition was deferred to 1887.\n\nThe American aim of participating was to display the latest agricultural, mechanical and textile products and inventions from the United States, but the main attraction was the \"Wild West\" show featuring Buffalo Bill, part of Colorado's contribution.\n\nOther exhibitions included a showing of Albert Bierstadt's painting of the Bahama Islands: \"A Nor'wester in the Bahama Island.\" \n\nThe 1887 American Exhibition was the first time that William Cody's \"Wild West\" show came to London.\n\nThe show itself was based on a spectacle, \"The Drama of Civilization,\" created by Steele MacKaye, Matt Morgan, and Nelse Waldron for the earlier American version of the \"Wild West\" show. The spectacle was a series of \"tableau vivants\" grouped into 4 \"epochs\": \"The Primeval Forest,\" \"The Prairie,\" \"Cattle Ranch,\" and \"Mining Camp.\" Act I, \"The Primeval Forest,\" ended with a fight among the Indians, and it was followed by an interlude featuring dancing by indigenous people and a demonstration of Lillian Smith's sharp-shooting. Act II, \"The Prairie,\" \"included a buffalo hunt by the Indians,\" the passage of a train through \"hostile land,\" a prairie fire, and a stampede, followed by cowboy \"riding, roping, and 'bronc busting.'\" \"The Attack on the Mining Camp,\" Act or Epoch III, starred Cody defending a cabin against \"gunfire and screaming Indians,\" followed by Cody's and Annie Oakley's shooting. The last epoch, \"Mining Camp,\" featured the Pony Express, an attack on a Deadwood stagecoach, and a cyclone. Ultimately, a 5th epoch was added, \"Custer's Last Stand,\" at the end of which Cody entered and circled the arena on a horse, while \"Too Late!\" was projected onto the cyclorama. (Although the conclusion to \"The Drama of Civilization\" might suggest that Cody took part in the Battle of the Little Bighorn, he was not near enough to have arrived at the site of the battle immediately after it was over; furthermore, it is not likely that his presence would have altered the outcome of the battle.)\n\nTransporting Buffalo Bill's \"Wild West\" from New York to the UK represented an enormous undertaking, bringing to London a large number of people and animals. Performers included Oakley, 97 indigenous people, mostly people from the Sioux tribes, including Black Elk and Chief Red Shirt, as well as African-American and Mexican or Mexican-American people. The \"Wild West\" brought into the UK a large number of animals — \"180 horses, 18 buffalo, 10 elk, 5 Texan steers, 4 donkeys, and 2 deer\" as well as 10 mules — with customs officials suspending normal quarantine requirements in spite of a local outbreak of hoof-and-mouth disease. Also on board the ship bringing the performers and animals was a real Deadwood stagecoach.\n\nCody invited the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, to a private preview of the \"Wild West\" performance on May 5, and the Prince of Wales was impressed enough to arrange a command performance for Queen Victoria on May 11, 1887. The Queen enjoyed the show and recorded in her journal meeting Cody, Annie Oakley, Lillian Smith, Chief Red Shirt, and a number of indigenous American women and children. Black Elk recalled Queen Victoria speaking respectfully to the indigenous performers and their families later in his \"Black Elk Speaks\", but Victoria describes them in their roles in \"The Drama of Civilization\" as \"rather alarming looking, [with] cruel faces.\" Among the dancers and a young teenager at the time, Black Elk says of Victoria that she \"was little but fat and we liked her, because she was good to us.\" To Queen Victoria the War Dance they danced, \"to a wild drum & pipe, was quite fearful, with all their contortions & shrieks, & they came so close.\"\n\nThe success of this command performance for the Queen — her first appearance at a public performance since Prince Consort Albert died in 1861 — set the stage for another command performance on June 20, 1887, for her Golden Jubilee guests. While Victoria herself did not attend this performance, royalty from all over Europe attended, including the future Kaiser Wilhelm II and future King George V. Queen Victoria made one more visit to the Exhibition, on June 22, 1887, although, surprisingly, she does not refer to it in her journal for that date. These royal encounters provided Buffalo Bill's \"Wild West\" an endorsement and publicity that ensured its success.\n\nBuffalo Bill's \"Wild West\" closed its London run in October 1887 after over 300 performances and more than two and a half million tickets sold.\n\n\n"}

It is followed by \"\".\n\nAlthough the one-hundred-year War is finally over, tensions run high as thirteen-year-old Avatar Aang and seventeen-year-old Zuko are put on a \"collision course\" after the Avatar travels to a Fire Nation colony named \"Yu Dao\", and finds \"tension between neighbors\" – a threat that may \"shatter the world's newfound peace\".\n\nThe unfinished conversation between Zuko and Ozai about the whereabouts of Ursa, Zuko's long-lost mother, is completed, but the conversation takes a different path after Zuko asks the question and her fate still remains unknown. Zuko forces Aang to promise to kill him if he becomes like his father, the deposed .\n\nNegotiations with Earth King Kuei and the beginning of the Harmony Restoration Movement commence. The movement plans to take the people in the Fire Nation colonies and move them into the Fire Nation itself. However, an unexpected controversy breaks out, as the older colonies are composed of people who have never lived within the Fire Nation and have intermarried with Earth Kingdom citizens. These people view the movement as robbing them of their homes. Fire Lord Zuko is caught between the desires of his people and the demands of many who believe peace and balance is only attainable if Fire Nation citizens return to their country. When the Earth Kingdom army arrives to enforce the Restoration Movement, Zuko deploys his own forces in defense of the colonies, leading to an explosive showdown between the recently belligerent sides and threatening to reignite the fires of war. Aang must decide whether to follow through on his promise, and decide the fate of the colonies in the process.\n\nIn the midst of this dispute, Toph's new metal bending school finds itself in trouble, while Aang is confronted with the \"Avatar Fan Movement,\" a growing group of young individuals trying to live as the air nomads did, but Aang views these people as parodying and denigrating the memory of his people.\n\nFollowing Fire Lord Ozai's defeat and the conclusion of the Hundred Year War, the Harmony Restoration Movement is established to remove the Fire Nation Colonies in the Earth Kingdom and relocate the colonists to the Fire Nation. Having become the new Fire Lord, Zuko makes Aang promise to kill him, should he turn out like his father.\n\nOne year later, Zuko survives an attempt on his life made by Kori Morishita, in protest against the Harmony Restoration Movement. Learning that Kori is the daughter of the Mayor of Yu Dao, the first colony created by the Fire Nation, Zuko travels to the city to confront the Morishita family. He learns that over the last century, the Fire Nation colonists have become deeply integrated with the original Earth Kingdom citizens, to the point that there are now mixed-race families, industries that use expertise from both cultures, and Earthbenders who consider themselves Fire Nation citizens, including Kori. Realizing that the Harmony Restoration Movement would bring an end to this, Zuko withdraws his support for it.\n\nZuko's decision causes protests from Earth Kingdom citizens, including the Freedom Fighters, who believe that Zuko is refusing to give up the colonies, and prompts Aang, Katara and Sokka to travel to Yu Dao to confront him. Aang's predecessor Avatar Roku urges Aang to fulfill his promise to Zuko, reminding him that his own failure to kill Fire Lord Sozin led to the Hundred Year War happening in the first place. Arriving in Yu Dao, Aang and Katara get into a fight with Zuko and his troops, and Aang nearly goes into the Avatar State, but he is talked out of it by Katara.\nDespite seeing the prosperity of Yu Dao for himself, Aang insists that the Fire Nation cannot keep occupying part of the Earth Kingdom if the world is to live in harmony. Katara suggests that Yu Dao be the exception to this rule, but Zuko states that the same should be done for the remaining colonies. Although doubtful, Aang agrees to try to get Earth King Kuei to talk with Zuko on what to do. The Earth Kingdom protestors are unhappy with Aang's decision, having suffered the presence of the colonies for over a century, and give him three days before they attempt to retake the city for themselves. Returning to the Fire Nation, Zuko visits his father for advice.\n\nAang and Katara travel to the city of Ba Sing Se to meet with Kuei. Upon arriving in the metropolis, Aang learns that an Avatar Aang fan club has been set up to honor him. Aang briefly enjoys the company of his fans, since they remind him of his old life among the Air Nomads. The two teenagers then try to convince Kuei to meet with Zuko, but the Earth King, in an attempt to appear strong after Long Feng's manipulation of him, states that he will order troops to Yu Dao to ensure the completion of the Harmony Restoration movement. Aang and Katara return to Yu Dao to try and convince the colonists to evacuate before the Earth Kingdom army arrives.\n\nIn the Fire Nation, Ozai talks about Zuko's indecisiveness, referring to an event from Zuko's childhood in which it nearly got him killed. Zuko interprets the story as his father saying that he should side with the stronger side in the conflict, but Ozai tells him that, as Fire Lord, whatever decision he makes is the right one, by virtue of the fact that he made it. Correctly predicting Kuei's response to the Yu Dao crisis, Ozai urges his son to do whatever is necessary to protect his citizens, viewing them as an expression of the Fire Lord's will. Zuko subsequently becomes reluctant to do so, out of fear that he would be no different from his father.\n\nIn a subplot, Sokka learns that Toph's Metalbending Academy, which she set up in Yu Dao following the end of the Hundred Year War, has been taken over by a rival Firebending Dojo as a result of Zuko's opposition to the Harmony Restoration Movement. Sokka and the Firebending master agree to a match between Toph's students and his disciples in three days, Sokka is unaware that Toph's students don't know how to bend metal. After several unsuccessful attempts to get the students metalbending, Toph gives up, explaining to Sokka that while she recruited her students with the belief that they could become metalbenders, she feels that she's been trying to force them to become something they're not, similar to how her parents treated her. Toph's students overhear the conversation, and upon realizing that Toph believed that they could become more than what they were, they are inspired to figure out how to metalbend, and subsequently win the match.\n\nZuko's girlfriend Mai learns about his meetings with Ozai from Suki, who is serving as one of Zuko's bodyguards. Upset that Zuko would keep secrets from her, Mai breaks up with him. Shortly afterwards, Zuko learns that Kuei's army is marching towards Yu Dao. Sadly admitting that his father was right, Zuko mobilises his own forces to defend the colonists.\n\nReturning to Yu Dao, Aang and Katara learn that the people of the city have formed the Yu Dao Resistance, in response to the Earth Kingdom protesters, with Sneers as one of the members. Aang also encounters the Yu Dao chapter of the Avatar Aang Fan Club, who had been informed of the approaching conflict by the Ba Sing Se chapter, but becomes offended when he sees the members wearing airbending master tattoos, considering this an insult against his culture. He subsequently decides to see the Harmony Restoration Movement through to the end, believing that harmony can only be achieved when all four nations are separate, as stronger nations cannot help but hurt or make fun of weaker ones. Leaving the scene with Aang, Katara, who no longer supports the Harmony Restoration Movement, starts to explain how she saw more than just Kori and her family when she saw Yu Dao, but is interrupted by an attempt by the protesters to force entry into the city.\n\nAs Aang and Katara unsuccessfully attempt to stop the protesters, Sokka, Toph and Suki, who had warned the other two about Zuko's intentions, attempt to delay the Fire Nation forces, fearing that another war will start when the two armies meet, Despite their best efforts, Zuko's army meets up with the Earth Kingdom army led by General How. Arriving on the scene, Aang goes into the Avatar State, while berating Zuko for giving up on the Harmony Restoration Movement. Katara again manages to talk him down, and explains that when she saw the Morishitas, a family with the heritage of two different nations, she saw her and Aang's future, and asks what separating the nations will mean for the two of them. At her advice, Aang leaves the scene in order to decide on a course of action, whilst his friends and the Avatar Aang Fan Club attempt to stop the fighting. As Aang meditates, Roku again tells Aang to think of the world above all else and fulfill his promise, revealing that he is Zuko's great-grandfather on his mother's side. Aang is horrified that Roku would consider killing his great-grandson for the sake of harmony.\n\nDuring the battle, Katara forces her way onto the blimp that Kuei is watching the battle from, and realizes that the Earth King is unaware of the true nature of Yu Dao, having never been there himself. She convinces him to come down to the city and see the people who will have to live with his decisions. As Zuko and General Hao prepare to do battle, Aang arrives in the Avatar State. Believing that the Avatar has come to kill him, Zuko protests, before sadly admitting that he is doing exactly what his father would have done. Aang instead uses his Earthbending to create a huge chasm around Yu Dao, cutting the two armies off from the city, and rescues Zuko when the latter nearly falls into it. He introduces Kuei to the Yu Dao resistance and explains that the Earth King is not just fighting a colony, but a new kind of world. Kuei begins to understand the situation, while Zuko, faced with the revelation that he has been in the right all along, collapses.\n\nFour days afterwards, Aang severs his connection with Roku, stating that the world is very different from when the last Avatar lived, and that he cannot think of the world without thinking of his friends, including Zuko. Aang, Kuei and Zuko agree to meet and discuss the fate of Yu Dao, Zuko and Aang both believing that it must become something other than a Fire Nation colony or an Earth Kingdom city. Zuko also apologizes for having Aang make his promise in the first place, viewing it as a way to save him from having to choose between right and wrong. Aang decides to teach the Avatar Aang Fan Club the ways of the Air Nomads in order to preserve their culture, dubbing them the Air Acolytes. The book - and by extension, the trilogy - end with Zuko talking with his sister Azula, now incarcerated in a mental institution, about searching for their mother.\n\nSince the conclusion of the original series in July 2008, fans of \"\" have demanded a more satisfying denouement in relation to the fates of the main characters. In late 2010, Samantha Robertson, an editor at [Dark Horse Comics] at the time, approached comic author Gene Yang, who was best known for his \"American Born Chinese\" series. After \"some conversations\" with her and the creators of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\", Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, Yang was contracted to write three graphic novels to serve as a direct continuation of the original series. Yang's approach to the writing of \"The Promise\" is purported to be \"purist\", and he has collaborated closely with DiMartino and Konietzko. The first volume of this new series of comics was released on January 25, 2012.\n\n\"The Promise Part 1\" has received mostly positive reviews, with Convention Scene praising Yang's portrayal of the characters. Convention Scene also praised Gurihiru Studio's artwork, stating that it did justice to the series. The \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" called the graphic novel an \"enjoyable read even if you are not well versed in the story's universe.\"\n\n2. https://www.amazon.com/Avatar-Last-Airbender-Promise-Part-2\n\n3. https://www.amazon.com/Avatar-Last-Airbender-Promise-Part-3\n"}

All the games were developed by Skip Ltd., except for \"Digidrive\", which was developed by Q-Games.\n\nThe \"bit Generations\" series has only been released in Japan. The games were released in two \"series\" - the games in Series One were released in Japan on July 13, 2006. Series Two was released on July 27, 2006. However, from June 1, 2006, Nintendo had sent out 700 copies of the games to random Club Nintendo members, encouraging them to preview the games and to post their opinions at the \"bit Generations\" official website.\n\nIn March 2006, some of the games were given an ESRB rating and were labelled under the title Digilux Series. However, Nintendo of America did not announce a release of the series in North America. Stickers depicting the game logos in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" indicated that the game series was intended to be released under the title \"Digilux\" outside Japan. Some of the games were eventually released under the \"Art Style\" banner for the WiiWare and DSiWare services.\n\nBoundish is played similar to the \"Magnavox Odyssey\" game \"Tennis\" and the arcade game \"Pong\", with players hitting an orb back and forth between two paddles. However, each level of the game contains different objectives that require the player to alter the way the orb is battered about.\n\nDotstream is played by players guiding their dot, which results in a line trailing behind it, through a track filled with obstacles such as squares, rectangles, and circles. Races (known as \"drawings\") are typically 2 laps long.\n\n\"Dotstream\" features three modes, Grand Prix, Spot Race and Formation. Grand Prix is considered the \"main game\", with players racing around five circuits, with new drawings unlocked in this mode. Spot Race is a time attack mode around unlocked drawings. Formation begins with the player starting with one dot and having to collect small pellets to fill up a meter. When the meter is sufficiently filled up, another dot will appear to assist in the collection of pellets. While only the player's dot can be directly controlled, additional dots can be manipulated by holding down the appropriate Formation button.\n\nA WiiWare version was released in North America on May 24, 2010 and in the PAL region on June 25, 2010, under the name light trax.\n\nColoris sees players eliminating colored squares by altering the color of other squares to make them the same color as the squares nearby.\n\nThe game features two different game modes: clear mode and score mode.

In score mode the player must eliminate squares to achieve a high score.\n\nSoundvoyager is intended to be played using sound only, without looking at the console's screen. The game involves several different subgames, one of which has players trying to center a dot on a side scrolling stage on top of an invisible target by only using sounds from the left and right speakers to guide them and another involves the player driving the wrong way down a three lane road trying to dodge oncoming vehicles by listening to which lane they are in.\n\nDigidrive is the seventh and final installment of the \"bit Generations\" series. Developed by Q-Games, it is the only game in the series not developed by skip Ltd.\n\nThe object of the game is to propel the disc-shaped core as many meters as possible before the piston collides into the core and ends the game.

He started his company in 1869 together with his wife, Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa, and popularised opera in Britain and America, performing standard repertory in English, as well as operas by English composers.\n\nRosa was born Karl August Nikolaus Rose in Hamburg, Germany, the son of Ludwig Rose, a Hamburg businessman, and Sophie Becker. His father subsequently took him to Edinburgh. A child prodigy, Rosa toured in Scotland from age 12 to age 16, eventually earning glowing notices. Beginning in 1859, he studied at the Conservatorium at Leipzig (where he met and became lifelong friends with Arthur Sullivan) and, in 1862, in Paris.\n\nIn 1863, Rosa was appointed Konzertmeister at Hamburg, where he had occasional opportunities to conduct. Three years later he visited England, appearing as a soloist at the Crystal Palace. He had considerable success as a conductor both in England and the United States. He travelled to America in 1866 as a member of a concert troupe promoted by the Baltimore impresario Hezekiah Linthicum Bateman that also included the Scottish operatic soprano Euphrosyne Parepa. During this tour, on 26 February 1867 in New York City, he married Parepa, who became known as \"Madame Parepa-Rosa\".\nIn 1869, in collaboration with the Chicago impresario C. D. Hess, the couple formed the Parepa Rosa English Opera Company in New York and toured in America for three seasons, with Parepa as the star and Rosa as the conductor. It brought grand opera to places in America that had never seen any, performing Italian operas in English, which made them more accessible to American audiences. In 1872, the Rosas returned to England and also visited Europe and Egypt. Rosa changed the spelling of his name after he moved to England, where people took \"Rose\" as a monosyllable.\n\nIn 1873 Rosa and his wife started the \"Carl Rosa Opera Company\" (the change in name reflecting her pregnancy) with a performance of William Vincent Wallace's \"Maritana\" in Manchester on 1 September, and then toured England and Ireland. Rosa's policy was to present operas in English, and that remained the company's practice. That year, Rosa invited the dramatist W. S. Gilbert to write a libretto for Rosa to present as part of a planned 1874 season at the Drury Lane Theatre. Gilbert expanded one of the comic \"Bab Ballads\" that he had written for \"Fun\" magazine into a one-act libretto titled \"Trial by Jury\". Parepa died in January 1874; Rosa dropped the project and cancelled his planned 1874 season. Rosa later endowed a Parepa-Rosa scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music in London. He married a second time in 1881. With his second wife, Josephine (d. 1927), he had four children.\nThe company's first London season opened at the Princess's Theatre in September 1875, playing \"The Marriage of Figaro\", with Charles Santley as Figaro and Rose Hersee as Susanna. In 1876, Rosa staged a second London season, which featured the first performance in English of \"The Flying Dutchman\" with Santley in the title role. For the next fifteen years, under Rosa's guidance, the company prospered and earned good notices, with provincial tours and London seasons, frequently in conjunction with Augustus Harris at the Drury Lane Theatre. Such was the success of the company that at one point three Carl Rosa touring troupes were set up. Rosa hired Alberto Randegger as the musical director of the company from 1879 to 1885. In 1880, George Grove wrote: \"The careful way in which the pieces are put on the stage, the number of rehearsals, the eminence of the performers and the excellence of the performers have begun to bear their legitimate fruit, and the Carl Rosa Opera Company bids fair to become a permanent English institution.\" In 1892, Rosa's Grand Opera Company gave a command performance of \"La fille du régiment\" at Balmoral Castle.\nRosa introduced many works of important opera repertoire to England for the first time, performing some 150 different operas over the years. Besides Santley and Hersee, Minnie Hauk, Joseph Maas, Barton McGuckin and Giulia Warwick were some of the famous singers associated with the company during its early years. Rosa also encouraged and supported new works by English composers. Frederic Hymen Cowen's \"Pauline\" (1876), Arthur Goring Thomas's \"Esmeralda\" (1883), Alexander Mackenzie's \"Colomba\" (1883) and \"The Troubabour\", and Charles Villiers Stanford's \"The Canterbury Pilgrims\" (1884) were commissioned by the company. Earlier English operas by Wallace, Balfe and Julius Benedict were also included in the company's repertoire. An obituarist noted, \"He had long looked forward to the time when Sir Arthur Sullivan would have undertaken a grand opera, and to the last had hoped to have been able to produce such a work.\" Shortly before his death, Rosa launched a light opera company that debuted with Robert Planquette's \"Paul Jones\".\n\nRosa died suddenly in Paris, on 30 April 1889, and was buried in Highgate Cemetery, London. Rosa's place in English music was indicated by the number of leading musicians who attended his funeral, including Sullivan, Stanford, Mackenzie and George Grove, together with Richard D'Oyly Carte, George Edwardes and Augustus Harris.\n\nBy the time he died, Rosa had demonstrated that English opera could be an artistic and financial success. In a memorial lecture, the critic Herman Klein said of him, \"From an artistic point of view he achieved triumph after triumph; he lifted English opera out of the slough of despond in which it was found in 1875.\" Both during his life and after his death, his company had much to do with popularizing opera in England, encouraging native composers and training many singers who went on to international careers. His company survived his death and continued to perform opera in English until 1960. A new opera company, using the name, was revived in 1997 under the artistic direction of Peter Mulloy. This company performs Gilbert and Sullivan and other light operas, as well as grand opera.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "185896", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185896", "title": "Club drug", "text": "Club drug\n\nClub drugs, also called rave drugs, or party drugs are a loosely defined category of recreational drugs which are associated with discothèques in the 1970s and nightclubs, dance clubs, electronic dance music parties, and raves in the 1980s to the 2010s. Unlike many other categories, such as opiates, which are established according to pharmaceutical or chemical properties, club drugs are a \"category of convenience\", in which drugs are included due to the locations they are consumed and/or where the user goes while under the influence of the drugs. Club drugs are generally used by teens and young adults. This group of drugs are also called \"designer drugs\", as most are synthesized in a chemical lab (e.g., MDMA, ketamine, LSD) rather than being sourced from plants (as with marijuana, which comes from the cannabis plant).\nClub drugs range from entactogens such as MDMA (\"ecstasy\"), 2C-B (\"nexus\") and inhalants (e.g., nitrous oxide and poppers) to stimulants (e.g., amphetamine and cocaine), depressants/sedatives (Quaaludes, GHB, Rohypnol) and psychedelic and hallucinogenic drugs (LSD, magic mushrooms and DMT). Dancers at all-night parties and dance events have used some of these drugs for their stimulating properties since the 1960s Mod subculture in U.K., whose members took amphetamines to stay up all night. In the 1970s disco scene, the club drugs of choice shifted to the stimulant cocaine and the depressant Quaaludes. Quaaludes were so common at disco clubs that the drug was nicknamed \"disco biscuits\". In the 1990s and 2000s, methamphetamines and MDMA are sold and used in many clubs. \"Club drugs\" vary by country and region; in some regions, even opiates such as heroin and morphine have been sold at clubs, though this practice is relatively uncommon. Narconon states that other synthetic drugs used in clubs, or which are sold as \"Ecstasy\" include harmaline; piperazines (e.g., BZP and TFMPP); PMA/PMMA; mephedrone (generally used outside the US) and MDPV.\n\nThe legal status of club drugs varies according to the region and the drug. Some drugs are legal in some jurisdictions, such as \"poppers\" (which are often sold as \"room deodorizer\" or \"leather polish\" to get around drug laws) and nitrous oxide (which is legal when used from a whipped cream can). Other club drugs, such as amphetamine or MDMA are generally illegal, unless the individual has a lawful prescription from a doctor. Some club drugs are almost always illegal, such as cocaine.\n\nThere are a range of risks from using club drugs. As with all drugs, from legal drugs like alcohol to illegal drugs like BZP, usage can increase the risk of injury due to falls, dangerous or risky behavior (e.g., unsafe sex) and, if the user drives, injury or death due to impaired driving accidents. Some club drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, are addictive, and regular use can lead to the user craving more of the drug. Some club drugs are more associated with overdoses. Some club drugs can cause adverse health effects which can be harmful to the user, such as the dehydration associated with MDMA use in an all-night dance club setting.\n\nMDMA (ecstasy) is a popular club drug in the rave and electronic dance music scenes and in nightclubs. It is known under many nicknames, including \"e\" and \"Molly\". MDMA is often considered the drug of choice within the rave culture and is also used at clubs, festivals, house parties and free parties . In the rave environment, the sensory effects from the music and lighting are often highly synergistic with the drug. The psychedelic quality of MDMA and its amphetamine-like energizing effect offers multiple reasons for its appeal to users in the rave setting. Some users enjoy the feeling of mass communion from the inhibition-reducing effects of the drug, while others use it as \"party fuel\" for all-night dancing.\n\nMDMA is taken by users less frequently than other stimulants, typically less than once per week. Effects include \"[g]reater enjoyment of dancing\", \"[d]istortions of perceptions, particularly light, music and touch\"; and \"[a]rtificial feelings of empathy and emotional warmth\". MDMA is sometimes taken in conjunction with other psychoactive drugs, such as LSD, DMT,\npsilocybin mushrooms and 2C-B. Users sometimes use mentholated products while taking MDMA for its cooling sensation.\n\nA number of stimulants are used as club drugs. Various amphetamines and methamphetamines are used as stimulants, as is cocaine. These drugs enable clubgoers to dance all night. Cocaine is a powerful nervous system stimulant. Its effects can last from fifteen or thirty minutes to an hour. The duration of cocaine's effects depends on the amount taken and the route of administration. Cocaine can be in the form of fine white powder, bitter to the taste. When inhaled or injected, it causes a numbing effect. Cocaine increases alertness, feelings of well-being and euphoria, energy and motor activity, feelings of competence and sexuality. Cocaine's stimulant effects are similar to that of amphetamine, however, these effects tend to be much shorter lasting and more prominent.\n\nMethaqualone (Quaaludes) became increasingly popular as a recreational drug in the late 1960s and 1970s, known variously as \"ludes\" or \"sopers\" (also \"soaps\") in the U.S. and \"mandrakes\" and \"mandies\" in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. The drug was often used by hippies and by people who went dancing at glam rock clubs in the 1970s and at discos (one slang term for Quaaludes in the disco era was \"disco biscuits\"). In the mid-1970s, there were bars in Manhattan called \"juice bars\" that only served non-alcoholic drinks that catered to people who liked to dance on methaqualone. Purported methaqualone is in a significant minority of cases found to be inert, or contain diphenhydramine or benzodiazepines. Methaqualone is one of the most commonly used recreational drugs in South Africa. It is also popular elsewhere in Africa and in India. Commonly known as Mandrax, M-pills, buttons, or smarties, a mixture of crushed mandrax and cannabis is smoked, usually through a smoking pipe made from the neck of a broken bottle.\n\nThe depressant GHB (also used by assailants as a date rape drug, in which case they slip it into a victim's drink) is intentionally taken by some users as a party drug and club drug.\n\nRohypnol (also used as a date rape drug) is a sedative/hypnotic that causes intoxication and impairs cognitive functions. This may appear as lack of concentration, confusion and anterograde amnesia. It can be described as a hangover-like effect which can persist to the next day. It also impairs psychomotor functions similar to other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drugs.\n\nThe previously mentioned selection of drugs are generally categorized as club drugs by the media and the United States government, this distinction probably does not have an accurate correlation to real usage patterns. For example, alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, hard liquor) is generally not included under the category of club drugs, even though it is probably used more than any other drug at clubs, particularly those that are liquor-licensed nightclubs or bars.\n\nA psychedelic drug is a medication whose primary action is to alter cognition and perception, typically by agonising serotonin receptors, causing thought and visual/auditory changes, and heightened state of consciousness. Major psychedelic drugs include Bufotenin, Racemorphan, LSD, DMT, and psilocybin mushrooms.\n\nNot to be confused with psychoactive drugs, such as stimulants and opioids, which induce states of altered consciousness, psychedelics tend to affect the mind in ways that result in the experience being qualitatively different from those of ordinary consciousness. Whereas stimulants cause an energized feeling and opiates produce a dreamy, relaxed state, the psychedelic experience is often compared to non-ordinary forms of consciousness such as trance, meditation, yoga, religious ecstasy, dreaming and even near-death experiences. With a few exceptions, most psychedelic drugs fall into one of the three following families of chemical compounds; tryptamines, phenethylamines, and lysergamides. Many psychedelic drugs are illegal worldwide under the UN conventions unless used in a medical or religious context. Despite these regulations, recreational use of psychedelics is common, including at raves and EDM concerts and festivals.\n\n\"Poppers\" are small bottles of volatile drugs which are inhaled by clubgoers for the \"rush\" or \"high\" that they can create. Nitrites such as alkyl nitrite originally came as small glass capsules that were popped open, which led to the nickname \"poppers.\" The drug became popular in the US first on the disco/club scene of the 1970s, where dancers used the drug for the \"rush\" it provides, and because it was perceived to enhance the experience of dancing to loud, bass-heavy disco. The drug became popular again in the mid-1980s and 1990s rave and electronic dance music scenes. As with disco clubgoers, rave participants and EDM enthusiasts used the drug because its \"rush\" or \"high\" was perceived to enhance the experience of dancing to pulsating music and lights.\n\nNitrous oxide is a dissociative inhalant that can cause depersonalisation, derealisation (feeling like the world is not real), dizziness, euphoria, and some sound distortion (flanging). In some cases, it may cause slight hallucinations and have a mild aphrodisiac effect. While medical grade nitrous oxide is only available to dentists and other licensed health care providers, recreational users often obtain the drug by inhaling the nitrous oxide used in whipped cream aerosol cans. Nitrous oxide users also buy small \"whippet\" canisters of nitrous oxide intended for use in restaurant whipped cream dispensers and then \"crack\" open these canisters to inhale the gas. Users typically transfer the gas to a plastic bag or balloon prior to inhaling it.\n\nKetamine, a dissociative anesthetic, has a long history of being used in clubs and was one of the most popular substances used in the New York Club Kid scene. Ketamine produces a dissociative state, characterized by a sense of detachment from one's physical body and the external world which is known as depersonalization and derealization. Effects include hallucinations, changes in the perception of distances, relative scale, color and durations/time, as well as a slowing of the visual system's ability to update what the user is seeing.\n\nIn the 2000s, synthetic phenethylamines such as 2C-I, 2C-B and DOB have been referred to as club drugs due to their stimulating and psychedelic nature (and their chemical relationship with MDMA). By late 2012, derivates of the psychedelic 2C-X drugs, the NBOMes and especially 25I-NBOMe, had become common at raves in Europe. The drug organization Norconon states that other synthetic drugs used in clubs, or which are sold as \"Ecstasy\" include harmaline; piperazines (e.g., BZP and TFMPP); PMA/PMMA; mephedrone (generally used outside the US) and MDPV.\n\nThough far less common than other \"club drugs\" like MDMA, ketamine, or LSD, heroin can be found in some of New York City's clubs. Marijuana and related cannabis products are used by some clubgoers; for example, some Rohypnol and ketamine users mix the powdered drug with marijuana and smoke it.\n\nAlthough each club drug has different effects, their use in clubs reflects their perceived contribution to the user's experience dancing to a beat as lights flash to the music. Club drug users are generally taking the drugs to \"enhance social intimacy and sensory stimulation\" from the dance club experience. Some club drugs' popularity stems from their ability to induce euphoria, lowered inhibition and an intoxicated feeling. Some drugs, such as amphetamine and cocaine, give the dancer hyperactivity and energy to dance all night. Many drugs produce a feeling of heightened physical sensation, and increased libido and sexual pleasure. Some club drugs, such as LSD, DMT, MDMA, 2C-B and ketamine enhance the experience of being in a nightclub with pulsating lights and flashing lasers and throbbing dance music, because they cause hallucinations or unusual perception effects.\n\nAlthough research continues into the full scope of the effects of illegal drugs, regular and unsafe use of club drugs is widely accepted to have damaging side effects and carry a risk of addiction. Increased heart rate, a steep increase in body temperature, increase in blood pressure, spasms and dehydration are all common side effects of MDMA and methamphetamine. Breathing and respiratory issues, drowsiness, nausea and confusion are common side effects of said drugs. They can also make the user anxious, stressed and panicked, or even hallucinate. Withdrawal is also a risk with many club drugs. Drug cravings as the chemical leaves the user's body can be complicated by sleep deprivation, dehydration and hypoglycaemia to result in debilitating 'come downs' which can result in depression-like symptoms. In the worst instance, club drugs result in the death of the user from cardiac arrest or water intoxication due to the increase in heart rate and thirstiness induced. Inconsistency in the strength and exact composition of the supplied drug causing users to overdose. Wide variance in the measured rate of deaths caused by drugs such as ecstasy across countries suggest that user and societal/environmental factors may also affect the lethality of club drugs.\n\nAnother risk is drug interactions. Some club drug users take multiple drugs at the same time. \"Club drugs often are taken together, with alcohol, or with other drugs to enhance their effect.\" Drug interactions can cause hazardous side effects. When club drug users are in a liquor-licensed nightclub, users may mix pills or powders (MDMA, 2C-B, GHB, ketamine) with consumption of alcoholic drinks such as beer, wine or hard liquor. Some depressants, such as Rohypnol, are dangerous to take while drinking alcohol. \"Ketamine often is taken in \"trail mixes\" of methamphetamine, phencyclidine, cocaine, sildenafil citrate (Viagra), morphine or heroin.\"\n\nAnother risk with club drugs is one shared by all drugs, from legal drugs like alcohol to abused over-the-counter drugs (taking large amounts of dextromethorphan cough syrup) and illegal drugs (BZP, amphetamines, etc.): while impaired, the user is more likely to be injured, engage in dangerous or risky behaviour (e.g., unsafe sex) or, if she or he drives, have an accident resulting in injury or death due to impaired driving.\n\nIn many cases, illegal club drugs are misrepresented. That is, a dealer will tell a purchaser that she/he has a certain illegal drug for sale, while in fact the dealer's pills, capsules or bags of powder do not contain that chemical. For example, MDMA (\"ecstasy\") is very hard to synthesize in illegal underground labs, and methamphetamine is much easier (it can be made from household chemicals and over-the-counter cold remedies containing pseudoephedrine). As such, what dealers sell as MDMA is often methamphetamine powder. Similarly, pills sold by drug dealers as LSD, a drug which only the top chemists have the training to synthesize, most often contain no LSD; instead, they often contain PCP, a veterinary tranquilizer which produces disassociation and hallucinations in humans. In some cases, the dealer has intentionally substituted a less expensive, more available illegal drug for another drug. In other cases, the substitution was made by a higher-level drug cartel or organization, and the dealer may in fact believe that the bogus product is MDMA or LSD.\n\nWith the exception of marijuana, which typically is uncut and unlaced, many illegal drugs, especially those which come in a powder or pill form are \"cut\" with other substances or \"spiked\" with other drugs. Cocaine, amphetamines and other stimulants often have caffeine powder added, as this increases the dealer's profit by bulking out the powder, so that less expensive cocaine or amphetamine has to be used in making the product. Some substances used to \"cut\" illegal drugs are not inherently harmful, as they are just used to \"pad\" or \"bulk out\" a quantity of the illegal drug and increase profits, such as lactose (milk sugar), a white powder often added to heroin. Even fairly innocuous powders that are added to illegal drugs, though, can have adverse effects with some routes of illegal drug administration, such as injection. With some drugs, adulterants are sometimes added to make the product more appealing. For example, \"flavoured cocaine\" has flavoured powder added to the drug.\n\nWhereas the main goal of \"cutting\" is to bulk out a quantity of pure, expensive illegal drugs with an innocuous and not overly harmful substance (lactose) or fairly low-impact product (e.g., caffeine in amphetamine pills), the goal of \"spiking\" is to try to make lower-quality illegal drug or a lower-potency source of illegal drugs give the user the type of \"high\" or psychedelic experience she or he is seeking. While it was earlier stated that marijuana is most often uncut and un-spiked, some dealers add PCP to marijuana (this is nicknamed \"wet marijuana\"), because adding this disassociative psychedelic to low-grade, low-THC marijuana can convert it into a cannabis that creates striking hallucinogenic effects. Drug researchers learned that some dealers were spiking marijuana when they tested US teens who stated that they had only used a single illegal drug (marijuana) and the teens tested positive for marijuana and PCP. Some dealers who have a very small quantity of MDMA powder to sell \"spike\" it with less expensive and easier to produce methamphetamine powder.\n\nNot all club drugs are addictive (e.g. nitrous oxide). However, some club drugs are addictive. Amphetamine heavily used in recreational fashion pose a risk of addiction.\n\nCocaine addiction is a psychological desire to use cocaine regularly. Cocaine overdose may result in cardiovascular and brain damage, such as: constricting blood vessels in the brain, causing strokes and constricting arteries in the heart; causing heart attacks. The use of cocaine creates euphoria and high amounts of energy. If taken in large, unsafe doses, it is possible to cause mood swings, paranoia, insomnia, psychosis, high blood pressure, a fast heart rate, panic attacks, cognitive impairments and drastic changes in personality. The symptoms of cocaine withdrawal (also known as \"comedown or crash\") range from moderate to severe: dysphoria, depression, anxiety, psychological and physical weakness, pain, and compulsive cravings.\nGHB addiction occurs when repeated drug use disrupts the normal balance of brain circuits that control rewards, memory and cognition, ultimately leading to compulsive drug taking. Although there have been reported fatalities due to GHB withdrawal, reports are inconclusive and further research is needed.\n\nKetamine use as a recreational drug has been implicated in deaths globally, with more than 90 deaths in England and Wales in the years of 2005–2013. They include accidental poisonings, drownings, traffic accidents, and suicides. The majority of deaths were among young people. This has led to increased regulation (e.g., upgrading ketamine from a Class C to a Class B banned substance in the U.K.). At sufficiently high doses, Ketamine users may experience what is called the \"K-hole\", a state of extreme dissociation with visual and auditory hallucinations.\n\nThe main treatment for individuals facing acute medical issues due to club drug consumption or overdoses is \"cardiorespiratory maintenance\". Since club drug users may have consumed multiple drugs, a mix of drugs and alcohol, or a drug adulterated with other chemicals, it is hard for doctors to know what type of overdose to treat for, even if the user is conscious and can tell the medical team what drug they think they took. A doctor recommends \"cardiac monitoring, pulse oximetry, urinalysis, and performance of a comprehensive chemistry panel to check for electrolyte imbalance, renal toxicity, and possible underlying disorders\" and preventing \"seizures\". Some doctors use activated charcoal and a cathartic\" to detoxify the drugs in the gastrointestinal system. Cooling the victim is recommended to avoid hyperthermia. If the victim overdosed on Rohypnol, the antidote flumazenil can be given; this is the only club drug for which there is an antidote.\n\nIn the mid to late-1970s disco club scene, there was a thriving drug subculture, particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud dance music and the flashing lights on the dancefloor. Substances such as cocaine (nicknamed \"blow\"), amyl nitrite (\"poppers\"), and Quaaludes. Quaaludes were described as [the] \"...other quintessential 1970s club drug\", which suspends motor coordination.\") According to Peter Braunstein, \"massive quantities of drugs were ingested in discothèques.\"\n\nThroughout the 1980s, the use of club drugs expanded into colleges, social parties, and raves. As raves grew in popularity through the late 1980s and into the late 1990s, drug usage, especially MDMA, grew with them. Much like discos, raves made use of flashing lights, loud techno/electronic dance music to enhance the user experience. Before their scheduling, some club drugs (especially designer drugs referred to as research chemicals) were advertised as alcohol-free and drug-free. Another reason that drug producers create new drugs is to avoid drug laws.\n\nClub drugs are used in Australia in a variety of dance clubs and nightclubs. One in ten Australians has used MDMA at least once in their lifetime; one in thirty have used MDMA in the past 12 months. One in a hundred Australians has used ketamine at least once in their lives and a total of five hundred in the past 12 months. One in two hundred Australians have used GHB at least once in their lives and one in one thousand in the past 12 months. Regarding the entire Australian population, seven per cent of Australians have used cocaine at least once in their lifetime and two per cent of Australians have used it in the past 12 months. In 2010-era generations, from teens to young adults and mature-aged people, these drugs are commonly used and sold in nightclubs and pubs throughout Australia.\n\n\n\n"}

Quinn (November 1860 – November 7, 1938) was one of the first American singers to become popular in the new medium of recorded music. Quinn was a very successful recording artist whose career spanned 1892 to 1918. Quinn recorded many of his hits in the legendary Tin Pan Alley of New York City.\n\nDan W. Quinn was born in 1860 in New York City. His family moved to San Francisco when he was a child, but returned to New York in the 1870s (leading to later confusion as to his birthplace). He began singing in the choir of the Church of the Heavenly Rest (Episcopal) as a child. As a young adult, he worked as an ironworker and moonlighted as a singer at local functions in the New York area.\n\n\"Discovered\" at one of these functions in January 1892, Quinn made his first recording in New York and quickly achieved success. Limitations of technology at the time meant that not all voices were suitable to be recorded; Quinn's voice was one that recorded well. He assisted Thomas Edison in the laboratory as Edison made modifications to the talking machine, to make it also a singing machine. Edison described him as \"the man with the perfect voice.\" He sang for all the major record labels of his day, including Berliner, Columbia, Edison, Gramophone, Paramount and Victor. In 1898, Columbia signed him to a year-long exclusive contract, but within days of its expiration he was making a record for Berliner. Over his career, Quinn recorded many popular songs and cut an estimated 2,500 titles. He sang \"Molly and I and the Baby\" more than a thousand times in about two weeks, using the pre-electricity trumpet technology of the early 1890s: the singer sang into the large end of a megaphone, which physically stimulated the stylus on the rotating cylinder. The companies had limited duplication capability, so if they wanted a hundred copies, the singer had to perform the song many times. For one take, Edison obtained an orchestra to accompany Quinn and kept that copy in his laboratory. \n\nAt age 22 Quinn married 15-year-old Mary Jane Ritchie, known to the family as Jennie. They had six children: Dan Jr, Ritchie, Arthur (who died in infancy), Mary, known as Lidie (later Hunsberger), Jane (Manderson), and Frank. They lived in a reconstructed mansion on W 20th St, near 10th Ave until about 1898, when they moved to 442 W 24th St, in a row of two-story houses known as Chelsea cottages. Later, in response to Jennie's inability to use stairs due to worsening rheumatism, they moved to a flat at 312 W 20th St. Quinn retired from recording in 1906, but continued to work in vaudeville. as well clubs, concerts, and occasionally comic opera. He briefly returned to recording in 1915 to 1918, but went back into retirement soon after. Although retired from singing, he worked extensively booking concerts and shows, including two large ones held the week he died.\n\nDan Quinn died of intestinal cancer at the W 20th St apartment in New York on November 7, 1938 at age 79.\n\nThe following is a partial list of Dan W. Quinn's recordings:\n\n\n"}

The band celebrated its 10 Year Anniversary in 2015. The still very young members began to play in concerts as teenagers, and thanks to the luck and hard work they became famous in 2009 with their hit “Élned kell”, which also became the advertising song of the Hungarian campaign against cervical cancer. The music video hits came after, like “Te vagy a Fény”, “Hang vagy Jel”, which song was hummed by the whole country, and “Egy a vége”. In 2012 appeared the LP Közel Hozzád, which was recorded in the USA with George Shilling, the producer of Madonna and Oasis. The LP made it to the Hit List of MAHASZ on the first week. The fan base of the band suddenly increased, because from 2009 until the present day Dirty Slippers is the opening act of Republic, in arenas and festivals too. Three European tours guaranteed the international success of the band. First with The Coronas, which is the favorite band of the Beatles-frontman Paul McCartney, then with the Romanian legend Rezident EX, and last time with the star band The Last Vegas, discovered by Guns N’ Roses. Together they conquered the European clubs with crowded audience. The Hungarian press wrote about this tour many times like this: “Dirty Slippers stands on the doorstep of worldwide success.”\n\nThe overwhelming success of live concerts, the hits, and the plenty more fans from every ages helped Dirty Slippers to become one of the most searched bands in Hungary by 2016.\n\n\n\n"}

It is close to the JR Osaka and Umeda Station, many restaurants, bars, izakaya, karaoke, massage parlors, host clubs, hotels, and shops concentrate in the area. Many salary-men, OL (office ladies) and students stop by Doyama-cho to have fun in the evening before they go back home. It is one of the largest party towns in Japan. Recently, this area has attracted gay communities, and now Doyama-cho is also known for its gay scene.\n\nIt is about 500m east from JR Osaka Station and 300m east from Hankyu, Hanshin and Subway Umeda station. The area is called \"Kita\" or north of Osaka, and best known as a party town. There are three main streets in Doyama-Cho; Hankyu Higashi Dori Shotengai (Hankyu's Eastside Mall), Hankyu Higashi Naka Dori (Hankyu's Eastside Central Mall)and Park Avenue Doyama. There are a lot of business offices and business hotels in south side of Doyama-Cho. North side of Doyama-Cho started becoming a gay community in last 20–30 years. \n\nThere were lots of luxury Japanese restaurants, sushi places, cabaret and Jazz clubs targeting high-end business customers until the bubble economy burst of the early 90s. However, since the real estate bubble crashed and many business headquarters have moved to Tokyo area, Osaka's economy lost its momentum. Many high-end bars or restaurants could not keep their business. Many usual restaurants, izakaya, pubs or adult entertainment businesses started their business to target general salary-man, OLs or students.\n\nRecently, many tourists from foreign countries visit Doyama-cho which is introduced as an entertainment district in many travel guide books, where are, amongst others, convenience hotels, such as Hotel Kinki which attracts many foreign visitors.\n\nDoyama-Cho also attracted gay communities. \"Hokuou-Kan\", one of the most popular sauna places, became very popular, and because of its convenient location, Doyama-Cho became a hub of gay community in West Japan. However, unlike in Western gay towns, the gay community does not want to interact with the general public and Doyama-Cho's neighborhood association still hesitates to mark Doyama-Cho as a gay friendly community.\n\nBesides bars, the area is also home to restaurants and cafes, shops, saunas, hotels, \"host bars or clubs\" (bars where patrons can meet hustlers), massage parlours, and brothels of varying sizes and legality. Establishments vary in size, but many are limited to ten or fewer seats.\n\nMuch like in Tokyo, bars here are usually themed towards \"types\" - bears, salarymen, young guys etc. Many of the gay bars in Doyama do not permit female customers. The few lesbian bars that can be found do not permit male customers. Mixed venues are few. \n\nAt most bars in this area, patrons usually sit at a counter and chat with the bartender. Karaoke is also popular, and gay monthly and pornographic magazines can be read at many establishments as well. Those who visit these small bars are usually regulars; since many bars operate on the \"bottle keep\" system, many customers may have their own bottle at their favourite bar. Loyalty to bars is returned by the bars organizing outings to onsen, hanami parties, picnics, gay sporting events, and so on. Many bars maintain large photo albums of customers, for customers, often taken at such events. \n\nWhile most bar owners (\"Mamas\" or \"Masters\") are accommodating to new customers and to non-Japanese, the scene is largely geared towards regular, Japanese-speaking customers, and some venues discourage or prohibit non-Japanese from entering, regardless of their Japanese language abilities. A handful of establishments, in contrast, specifically target foreigners with advertising and information in English. These include Bar Physique and FrenZy Bar. While most bars have a cover charge system, these do not. \n\nWith the advent of the internet and less segregation, Doyama is seeing a downturn in gay visitors. While weekends are busy, foreign visitors should not expect the same numbers as one would expect in a city of this size in the West. In recent times, more bars have opened aimed at straight men.\n\nWhile Tokyo has been the site of numerous gay pride parades over the past 20 years, Osaka has lagged in this regard. Finally, October 22, 2006 saw the inaugural Rainbow Parade, with more than 900 participants marching from Nakanoshima Park to Motomachi-Naka Park, near Namba Station. The 11th annual parade will take place on October 1, 2016.\n\nMash (Men and Sexual Health Osaka) organize a yearly event called PLus+ promoting AIDS awareness. Taking place in Ogimachi Park, close to the Doyama area, there is entertainment and drinks available. Organisers estimate more than 10,000 people participated in the 2007 event.\n\nIn 2008, the event falls on Sunday, October 12.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a joint production by Star Cinema, M-Zet Productions, APT Entertainment and OctoArts Films and is a cross-over to the \"Enteng Kabisote\" and \"Tanging Ina\" series. It is an official entry to the 2011 Metro Manila Film Festival and was released on December 25, 2011.\n\nThe movie is a last installment of \"Ang Tanging Ina\" film series and the eighth movie installment based on TV sitcom, \"Okay Ka, Fairy Ko!\".\n\nEnteng Kabisote (Vic Sotto) wants to retire as the perennial hero of Engkantasya and have a normal life with his family without the magical elements. Ina Montecillo (Ai-Ai delas Alas) longs to have the right partner to be with her for the rest of her life.\n\nOne day, Enteng is placed under a powerful evil spell by Engkantasya's evil fairy Satana to fall in love with another woman. And when he meets Ina, he exerts all the effort Ina to fall for him. Ina, on the other hand, slowly opens her heart for this new opportunity of love.\n\nEnteng then tries his best to be a father to Ina's children even if they are not fully supportive of him. But when their relationship gets serious, Ina discovers the truth – Enteng already has a family.\n\nAfter discovering the truth of Enteng's family and the evil spell casted upon Enteng was worn off, Ina's family teamed up with Enteng's family to fight off Satana and her minions for what she had done as Ina Magenta gives Ina Montecillo some of their powers to fight her. \n\nAfter defeating Satana as they celebrate their victory, both Enteng and Ina set their differences and became friends. However at the arrival of both Tirso \"Pip\" Montecillo (Alwyn Uytingco) and Aiza Kabisote (Aiza Seguerra), both Enteng and Ina scolds them for being late and to their horrible shock that Pip accidentally impregnates Aiza during their schedules in late nights (The same scene where Pip accidentally impregnates the woman he did not met while in a drunken state and had a daughter named Monay) and both were comically shocked that they will became as upcoming grandparents on Aiza's unborn child making themselves as both father and mother in-law to both Aiza and Pip.\n\n\n\nThe film captured the number one spot on the first day of 2011 Metro Manila Film Festival box office race with a whooping ₱38.5 million gross well ahead of the runners-up, Ang Panday 2, and Segunda Mano with ₱20 million and ₱18.25 million gross respectively.\n\n<br>\nDuring its opening day, the film grossed over ₱38.5 million nationwide making it as the highest-grossing film on its first day of all-time in the Philippines breaking the records of Spiderman and Avatar. On its 2nd Day, the movie total gross is ₱69 million. It is higher than Ang Panday 2, with ₱38 million and Segunda Mano with ₱35 million. On its third day, (according to MMFF committee) \"Enteng ng Ina Mo\" grossed 91.9 million. Enteng ng Ina Mo breaks the 4 Day Record of \"The Unkabogable Praybeyt Benjamin\"(₱109 million) with a record of ₱110 Million. After 4 weeks of showing, the film grossed P 237 million and became the third highest-grossing Filipino film of all time and highest-grossing MMFF film of all time.\n\nThe film was graded \"B\" by the Cinema Evaluation Board of the Philippines.\n\nAntonio Siegfrid O. Alegado of Business World described that the film could have been better had it not been hampered by poor editing as it was clear that the fusion of the families of Enteng and Ina was done in rather sloppy fashion. The film, however, was saved by the Tanging Ina cast thanks to nice performances.\n\nMark Angelo Ching of PEP.ph gave the film a stronger review and described it as \"the perfect mix of humor and fantasy that MMFF moviegoers look for year after year.\" The review also noted the solid performances of Gwen Zamora, Xyriel Manabat, and Thou Reyes.\n\nIn regards to the film's concept of doing a cinematic crossover of two established characters, Philbert Ortiz Dy stated that \"filmmakers were content to just have the two big stars together on screen, giving them dialogue from other movies and pushing towards some ridiculous adventure climax\".\n\n\n"}

The production arm of Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the company creates and licenses music for use in television, film, advertising, and online media. Their library consists of over 15,000 original copyrights, covering music in a wide variety of genres. It includes music from artists and composers such as Quincy Jones, Hans Zimmer, George Martin, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, and Junkie XL. Extreme Music is headquartered in London, with its creative operations based in a 7,500 square-foot production compound in Santa Monica, California.\n\nExtreme Music was founded in London by Russell Emanuel and Dolph Taylor in 1997. Emanuel had played bass with a punk band, Class Ties, and worked a day job as a studio assistant at MCA Music Publishing and Abbey Road Studios. After leaving MCA, Emanuel worked at Bruton, a production music library which produced sound-alike music that was recorded, produced, and licensed inexpensively. He recorded one sound-alike album for Bruton, and financed his band’s touring through the royalties the album generated.\n\nEmanuel also managed bands, including Stiff Little Fingers. After beginning a job at a third production library, MatchMusic, Emanuel and Stiff Little Fingers drummer Dolph Taylor began to compose music for MatchMusic together. They built a MIDI suite, and when not on tour, they recorded original tracks that reflected their own musical sensibilities. \"We were forever knocking our heads against old-school attitudes and being told that 'This is what the marketplace likes.' But we were seeing a new generation of editors coming into the industry and going to clubs and hearing all these thumping records, and they wanted to know why production music didn't sound like that,\" Taylor said in a 2003 interview. Taylor and Emanuel decided to approach commercial artists, some of whom they already knew, and ask them to record production music tracks.\n\nWith a $100,000 investment from angel investor Mark Levinson, Extreme Music was founded in 1997. The company was positioned to reflect the\npunk rock ethos of its founders; for example, they mailed condoms to 1000 music industry executives with packaging that read \"Extreme Music: The Only Safe Thing You'll Ever Get From Us.\" With a focus on production, they \"upped the industry ante by using professional recording studios and top-notch musicians.\" By keeping the library's emphasis on quality over quantity, they streamlined the process of selecting music for advertising agencies and music supervisors.\n\nBy 2005, Extreme Music had built one of the most profitable production music libraries in the UK. In August 2005 it was bought by Viacom for $45.1 million, and in 2008 it was acquired by Sony/ATV Music Publishing. The terms of the sale were not disclosed.\n\nIn January 2013, Extreme introduced Customix, the first web application created specifically for music supervisors to quickly customize songs from its library. It offered complete control to users, allowing the manipulation of individual stems of a track, including the ability to adjust the volume of or mute individual elements, modify tempo without changing pitch, and edit the length of a song without first cutting it into segments. The Customix software was developed in conjunction with Menlo Park technology company UJAM.\n\nExtreme Music tracks have been licensed by editors, music producers and music supervisors at production companies, networks and advertising agencies, including A+E, Fox, BBC, HBO, the NFL and Apple. Among other productions, music from the Extreme library has been used in \"Mad Men\", \"Ray Donovan\", \"Dancing with the Stars\", \"Birdman\", \"Creed\" and \"It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\"\n\nIn August 2013, Extreme partnered with composer Hans Zimmer and his business partner, Steve Kofsky, to found Bleeding Fingers Music. A joint venture, it creates show-specific libraries and scores for unscripted, reality, documentary and light drama television shows. In 2017, it was ranked as the leading custom music scoring company in the industry.\n\n"}

It was one of the largest companies in its field in Finland from 1950s to 1970s. Mauno Mäkelä was the head of the company during its entire run.\n\nFennada-Filmi had its foundation in the company Fenno-Filmi, which was founded in 1942 and produced 15 movies between 1944–1950. When Mauno Mäkelä was named the CEO of the company in 1949, arrangements began to combine productions of Fenno-Filmi and Adams Filmi. New company Fennada-Filmi went active in the summer of 1950, and only the distributing duties remained for Adams Filmi. Mäkelä continued as the managing director and production manager of the new company.\n\nThe final film for Fenno-Filmi, \"Hallin Janne\" by Roland af Hällström, was finished in the summer of 1950. At the same time, shooting began for Fennada-Filmi's first production \"Ratavartijan kaunis Inkeri\", directed by Hannu Leminen. In 1952, Lasse Pöysti joined the company as a director, and made a total of eight films during the next years. Director Ville Salminen switched from Suomen Filmiteollisuus to Fennada-Filmi in 1953, and the next year Aarne Tarkas joined in as well.\n\nIn 1955, Hällström directed Fennada-Filmi's first commercial success, \"Ryysyrannan Jooseppi\" which received three Jussi Awards. When Hällström died the next year, Mauno Mäkelä hired Matti Kassila as his replacement. Kassila's first Fennada-Filmi production was \"Elokuu\" (1956). Although the film received critical acclaim and won six Jussi Awards, it was not a commercial success. However, Kassila's next two films, \"Kuriton sukupolvi\" (1957) and \"Syntipukki\" (1957) – both remakes of the 1930s Finnish films – did well at the box office.\n\nSince the beginning, Fennada-Filmi had suffered from lack of new ideas and resorted to remakes, while also keeping up the fast production pace. In 1961, two successful films premiered, Ritva Arvelo's \"Kultainen vasikka\" and Matti Kassila's \"Kaasua, komisario Palmu!\", which was a sequel to Kassila's \"Komisario Palmun erehdys\" (1960). That film had been produced by Suomen Filmiteollisuus, but Mauno Mäkelä managed to get the rights to the sequel.\n\nRobert Balser, an American animator, established Fennada-Filmi's animation department.\n\nThe fate of Fennada-Filmi was at stake with the actors' strike in 1963, and a plan was made to sell the company to the Finnish Broadcasting Company. This, however, proved to be a very controversial move, and the deal was cancelled. Throughout the mid-1960s, new films went into production only infrequently.\n\nIn the fall of 1966, shooting began for a film adaptation of a Väinö Linna's \"Täällä Pohjantähden alla\". Directed by Edvin Laine, the film premiered in the fall of 1968 and was a commercial success. The sequel \"Akseli and Elina\" also did well when it was released in 1970. Only five more films were released by Fennada-Filmi, with Laine's \"Ruskan jälkeen\" (1979) being the final one. In 1982, the Finnish Broadcasting Company bought the company, which marked the end of its run.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was particularly popular in the 1950s and 1960s. From 2007 he lived in Salzburg, Austria, with his fourth wife, . He died there on 22 November 2011 \"after a severe infection,\" according to his wife Barbara.\n\nKreisler went to high school in Vienna, where he studied music theory, and learned to play violin and piano. In 1938, he was forced to flee with his parents due to increasing Nazi restrictions on Jews. In 1941, he married Philine Hollaender, daughter of Friedrich Hollaender and Blandine Ebinger. In 1943, he became an American citizen. He enlisted in the Army, and was stationed in Europe. He wrote songs for soldiers in Britain and France with the help of Marcel Prawy. After the war, he went to Hollywood and worked on movies with Charlie Chaplin. He performed at nightclubs and bars to make ends meet. In 1947, he was rejected by the record companies because his songs were \"un-American\", especially songs with titles such as \"Please Shoot Your Husband\". In 1955, he returned to Europe, first to Vienna, then Munich in 1958, Berlin in 1976, Salzburg in 1988, Basel in 1992, and back to Salzburg in 2007. He died at the age of 89 in 2011.\n\nKreisler is considered a master of language. His songs are characterized by black humour and uncompromising criticism of society and politics. This caused him many difficulties and also contributed to appearance prohibitions in radio and television.\n\nDespite producing several hundred original songs Kreisler may occasionally have used ideas and material from other artists in his work. His song \"\" shows strong similarities to Tom Lehrer's \"I Hold Your Hand in Mine\", first recorded by Lehrer in 1953 on the album \"Songs by Tom Lehrer\". Lehrer's recording predates by several years any documented recording or performance of that song by Kreisler as well as Kreisler's return to performance in German-speaking countries in 1955. Kreisler's \" (first released as \") has strong similarities to Lehrer's \"Poisoning Pigeons in the Park\". Kreisler and Lehrer each deny copying from the other; so far no one has succeeded in establishing which song was written first. Kreisler's \"\" appears to be related to the Abe Burrows song \"The Girl with the Three Blue Eyes\" (first recording 1950). Kreisler's song \"Bidla Buh\" (first recorded in the 1950s) appears to be related to the Rodgers and Hart number \"To Keep My Love Alive\" composed in 1943.\n\n"}

Despite his refusal, footage does exist of him performing \"Mr. Soul\" and \"Long Time Gone.\" The \"Mr. Soul\" performance can be found as an Easter Egg on his Archives 1963-1972 DVD box set, however because of his resistance to being filmed during much of the performance the camera remains focused on Stills.

The other two are \"Heer Ranjha\", \"Sohni Mahiwal\" . There are six other popular folklore stories in Punjab: \"Momal Rano\", Sassi Punhoon, \"Umar Marvi\", \"LiLa Chanesar\", \"Noori Jam Tamachi\" and \"Dhaj, Ror Kumar\". These nine tragic romances are popular in Punjab.\n\nThese six and \"Sorath Rai Diyach\" are originally from Sindh, and along with \"Sohni Mahiwal\" and \"Sassi Punnun\" are commonly known as Seven Queens () of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai. They are culturally included in both Punjabi and Sindhi traditions.\n\n\"Mirza Sahiba\" was first written by the Punjabi sofi poet Hafiz Barkhudar Ranjha from Tahat Hazara District Sargodha Pakistan. Hafiz Barkhudar was student of a Hakeem family, ancestors of Punjab and do Bait under Hakeem family ancestors. That Hakeem family brought Hafiz Sahab from Tahat Hazara district Sargodha to a place in Sialkot Pakistan named Chitti Sheikhan. Hafiz Sahab lived and died in Chitti Sheikhan.\n\nMirza Khan was the son of Wanjhal Khan, the leader of the Kharal jat/Rajput Tribe origin in Danabad, a town in the Jaranwala area of Faisalabad, Pakistan. Sahiba was the daughter of Mahni, the chief of Khewa, a town in Sial Territory in the Jhang district, Pakistan.\n\nA long time ago in the village of Kheewa, a town in the control of Sial tribe of Jats, a woman gave birth to a baby boy. Unfortunately, the woman died after giving birth and was unable to breastfeed her son. However, another woman nearby had recently given birth to a girl. This woman took it upon herself to help the little boy. She fed this boy as she did her own daughter.\n\nThus, as is the custom for such occasions, these two children became “milk siblings” because they were given the same milk to drink. Later as the children became adults, the girl, named Fateh Bibi, got married and moved a day’s journey on horseback away to the village of Danababad near present-day Faisalabad. Fateh Bibi married a man named Wanjal, the Sardar of the Kharrals, and they had a strong son named Mirza.\n\nMeanwhile, Fateh Bibi’s milk brother, no longer a boy but a man named Khewa Khan, Sardar of the Sial Jats, had a daughter named Sahiba.\n\nWhen it was time to enroll the children in school, Mirza’s parents had decided to send him to his “milk uncle’s” house so he could get educated there. Sahiba’s father enrolled her and her “cousin” into classes to learn the Quran together since they were of the same age. \n\nMirza did not know that his “cousin” Sahiba was such a beauty one can only dream of beholding. He did not notice her at first when he came to Kheewa to study because they were just children. As the two children grew into adolescence, feelings of love began to blossom between the two. \n\nOne day the adventurous young Mirza took a different path home while walking back from school. There was a bazaar on that street. He saw Sahiba buying some vegetables for her family. He watched as she asked for various squashes and leaves to cook. When the merchant began to weigh her purchases, he weighed out extra because he was lost in her beauty. Mirza, too, was transfixed by her gracefulness and raced all the way home fueled by love.\n\nMirza became skilled as a horseman and archer as he grew older. He rode on a powerful steed named Bakki who swiftly maneuvered through the land. Mirza was so skillful that every arrow he shot would willfully go exactly where he wanted. Sahiba only grew more and more beautiful with time.\n\nSoon, their love began to blossom. Mirza could not live without his Sahiba. They were lost in their own world. Once, when Sahiba had pronounced her lessons incorrectly, her maulvi beat her with a chimmak. This thin branch gives a person a burning sting when swatted with it. As Sahiba received her punishment with the chimmak, she spoke to the maulvi. \n\nSadly, their days of blissful love did not last. Sahiba’s parents found out about the love affair and sent Mirza back home to his parents. Not too long after that, they arranged Sahiba’s marriage to a man named Tahir Khan. He was from the same town. With Mirza back home, Sahiba’s parents were able to prepare for the wedding without any interruptions. \n\nSahiba, via her friend, a Brahmin named Karmu, sent word of her unfortunate marriage to her darling Mirza. As soon as he heard of this, he made plans to leave. His family tried to stop him but he would not succumb to their pleas. He had to go. Before Mirza left, his father, seeing that there was no other way, went to Mirza and told him that if he went, then he must be sure to return with Sahiba or else it would bring great dishonor. With those words, Wanjal gave his son his blessings to pursue his love.\n“Chal, my Bakki,” Mirza, equipped with his bow and arrows, commanded his horse to ride on to the village of Kheewa.\n\nMirza reached Sahiba on the day of the wedding right before the ceremony was about to proceed. He opened the door to the room Sahiba was waiting in and entered secretly. He admired her; she was dressed in bright red wedding clothes, her delicate hands darkly painted with mehndi. Without waiting another moment, he held her hand and took her away with him on horseback and rode until he thought that they had reached a safe distance. Tired, he decided to rest by under the shade of a tree while his sweet Sahiba watched over him.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the wedding party, Sahiba brothers called for her to come down to proceed with the ceremonies. When she did not come, her brothers realized that something was wrong. Sahiba’s brothers, the jilted bridegroom, and other male cousins rode on horseback in search for Mirza and Sahiba.\n\nSahiba, while keeping watch over her slumbering beloved, feared that her brothers would soon catch up. She did not know what to do. If her brothers came and Mirza woke up then her brothers would surely die at the hands of Mirza’s quick arrows.\n\nWith the hope of her brothers taking pity on her, Sahiba reached Mirza’s quiver and broke each sharp arrow it contained in half. She believed that no blood would be spilled this way. Suddenly, Sahiba’s brothers and relatives found the couple under the tree. With one quick shot from Sahiba’s brother’s bow, Mirza awoke to an arrow piercing his throat. Mirza reached for his arrow and saw all the broken pieces. He looked up at Sahiba, searching for an answer in her face but was struck with yet another arrow, this time in the chest. Sahiba threw herself over him and together, they died.\n\nThe tale of Mirza Sahiban is part of popular Punjabi culture. There are many folk song versions, including the hit version titled \"Mirza\" sung by the legendary Alam Lohar. He was the first main Punjabi singer to bring this story to a song format and had a distinct way of singing it, with extreme vocal strength with Algoza (Jhori) and Chimta in 1941. Since then many other Punjabi singers have followed his style, including Noor Jehan for the film \"Mirza Jat\", released in 1982.\n\nThere have been various film interpretations of the folk tale.\n\n"}

In its debut in the January 1976 Winter Carnival at the college, a student exclaimed that Paul Newman once said \"twenty four hours in a day, twenty four beers in a case. Coincidence? I think not\" as a rhetorical mandate. \n\nOriginally named Paul Newman Day, it was renamed Newman Day (sometimes known as Newman's Day), and became an unofficial student tradition at Bates in the years to follow. As time went on the tradition was picked up by his alma mater, Kenyon College, as well as Princeton University. Newman Day begins at 12:00 am on the morning of April 24th and concludes at 11:59 pm. During his life Newman publicly opposed the tradition and asserted that the quote inspiring it was misattributed. The tradition has been spun off into new traditions and similar activities by The Evergreen State College and the University of Virginia.\n\nThe first reference to \"Paul Newman Day\" occurred in the late 1970s in \"The Bates Student.\" It was noted as a day where students participated in food fights in the dining hall while drinking. However, the activity was renamed \"Newman Day\" and included following a rhetorical and hypothetical pseudo-mandate made by Newman. In a speech to college students that was profiled by a magazine, Newman stated:Twenty four hours in a day, twenty four beers in a case. Coincidence? I think not.The tradition was officially debuted on the campus of Bates College in Lewiston, Maine during the January 1976 Winter Carnival by students participating in the day's events. \n\nNewman Day begins at 12:00 am on the morning of April 24th and concludes at 11:59 pm. The traditional and original rules stipulate that one beer must be consumed every hour, on the hour, during this time period. During this time, the participant is allowed to sleep but is not allowed to \"boot\" (throw up), or else the amount of beer consumed is \"reset\" to zero and they must begin the challenge again (i.e. if someone were to throw up at 11:50 pm, \"should they choose to complete the activity\", they would have to consume 24 beers in nine minutes or 540 seconds). The participant must continue with their daily activities (i.e. going to classes, sports practices, theatre performances, etc.), assuming a normal outer appearance. Although not specified, when Newman stated \"24 beers in a case\", many students at Bates College interpreted that to mean the standard fluid ounce of a beer can, i.e. 12 ounces.\n\nThe consumption of 24 beers in 24 hours can have serious negative effects on a kidney's processing capabilities and induce cognitive irregularities. Regardless of body weight or time in between drinks, the total consumption of a 12 ounce beer, every hour on the hour, can have universal effects on the mental state and physical composition of participants. According to standardized blood alcohol content (BAC) levels and the impact of sleep deprivation, a typical Newman Day follows as:\n\n\nThe negative health impacts of Newman Day can be mitigated by sleeping a full eight to ten hours the day before, eating regularly throughout Newman Day, drinking water intermittently, and not resetting the game.\n\nNewman strongly opposed the tradition as he himself struggled with drinking. He called it \"abhorrent\" and \"cruel.\" While Bates College and Princeton University began to establish the tradition on their campuses, Newman wrote letters to the universities' presidents denouncing the activities around the tradition. In April 2004, he took out a page in \"The Daily Princetonian\", Princeton's college newspaper, to say that the quote was misattributed and to register his disapproval. During an interview with \"The New York Times\", he stated that students at participating universities were free to do what they please, but they shouldn't use his name. He encouraged students to participate in \"twenty-three hours of community service followed by a cold one.\"\n\nHe sent a letter to the President of Bates College, Thomas Reynolds on April 20, 1987, in which he said:Dear Mr. Reynolds:I was surprised to learn that a day which was held in my honor was actually an excuse for drunkenness, disregard for property, disrespect for people, and deeds of questionable character. That the tradition of these activities has been wisely quashed by those in authority is indeed a relief.I would like to propose that Paul Newman Day be reinstated under somewhat different guidelines; i.e., a day in pursuit of athletic excellence with paid attendance. The proceeds to be returned to the community in ways of your own choosing. I would be grateful to learn if the students find any merit in this.Sincerely, Paul NewmanP.S. My office address is: 500 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10022Bates along with Princeton quickly disavowed any responsibility for the event, responding that Newman Day is not sponsored, endorsed, or encouraged by the universities and is solely an unofficial event among students.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "214490", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=214490", "title": "Political theatre", "text": "Political theatre\n\nPolitical theatre is theatre that comments on political and social issues.\n\nIn the history of theatre, there is long tradition of performances addressing issues of current events, especially those central to society itself. The political satire performed by the comic poets at the theatres had considerable influence on public opinion in the Athenian democracy. Those earlier Western dramas, arising out of the polis, or democratic city-state of Greek society, were performed in amphitheaters, central arenas used for theatrical performances, religious ceremonies and political gatherings; these dramas had a ritualistic and social significance that enhanced the relevance of the political issues being examined.\n\nShakespeare is an author of political theatre according to some academic scholars, who observe that his history plays examine the machinations of personal drives and passions determining political activity and that many of the tragedies such as \"King Lear\" and \"Macbeth\" dramatize political leadership and complexity subterfuges of human beings driven by the lust for power. For example, they observe that class struggle in the Roman Republic is central to \"Coriolanus\".\n\nHistorically in Soviet Russia, the term political theatre was sometimes referred to as agitprop theatre or simply agitprop, after the Soviet term agitprop.\n\nIn later centuries, political theatre has sometimes taken a different form. Sometimes associated with cabaret and folk theatre, it has offered itself as a theatre 'of, by, and for the people'. In this guise, political theatre has developed within the civil societies under oppressive governments as a means of actual underground communication and the spreading of critical thought.\n\nOften political theatre has been used to promote specific political theories or ideals, for example in the way agitprop theatre has been used to further Marxism and the development of communist sympathies. Russian agitprop theater was noted for its cardboard characters of perfect virtue and complete evil, and its coarse ridicule.\n\nBut Marxist theatre wasn't always this directly agitational. Bertolt Brecht developed a highly elaborate and sophisticated new aesthetics--epic theater—to address the spectator in a more rational way. Brecht's aesthetics have influenced political playwrights throughout the world, especially in India and Africa. Augusto Boal developed the Brechtian form of \"Lehrstücke\" into his internationally acclaimed \"Theatre of the Oppressed\", with its techniques of 'forum theatre' and 'invisible theatre', to further social change. Boal's work in this area has contributed to the emergence of the Theatre for Development movement across the world. In the sixties playwrights like Peter Weiss adopted a more 'documentary' approach towards political theatre, following on from the example of Erwin Piscator in the twenties. Weiss wrote plays closely based on historical documents like the proceedings of the Auschwitz trial in Frankfurt.\n\nLess radical versions of political theatre have become established within the mainstream modern repertory - such as the realist dramas of Arthur Miller (\"The Crucible\" and \"All My Sons\"), which probe the behavior of human beings as social and political animals.\n\nA new form of political theatre emerged in the twentieth century with feminist authors like Elfriede Jelinek or Caryl Churchill, who often make use of the non-realistic techniques detailed above.. During the 1960s and 1970s, new theatres emerged addressing women's issues. These theatres went beyond producing feminist plays, but also sought to give women opportunities and work experience in all areas of theatrical production which had heretofore been dominated by men. In addition to playwright, producers, and actors, there were opportunities for women electricians, set designers, musical director, stage managers, etc.\n\nThe Living Theatre, created by Judith Malina and her husband Julian Beck in 1947, which had its heyday in the 1960s, during the Vietnam War, is a primary example of politically oriented Brechtian performance art in the United States. Their original productions of Kenneth Brown's \"The Brig\" (c. 1964), also filmed, and of Jack Gelber's controversial play \"The Connection\" and its 1961 film rely upon and illustrate the dramaturgy of Brechtian alienation effect (\"Verfremdungseffekt\") that most political theatre uses to some extent, forcing the audience to take a \"critical perspective\" on events being dramatized or projected on screen(s) and building on aspects of the Theatre of Cruelty, which developed from the theory and practice of French early surrealist and proto-absurdist Antonin Artaud.\n\nIn American regional theatre, a politically oriented social orientation occurs in Street theatre, such as that produced by the San Francisco Mime Troupe and ROiL. The Detroit Repertory Theatre has been among those regional theaters at the forefront of political comedy, staging plays like Jacob M. Appel's Arborophilia, in which a lifelong Democrat prefers that her daughter fall in love with a poplar tree instead of a Republican activist. In 2014, Chicago's Annoyance Theater produced Good Morning Gitmo: a one-act play by Mishu Hilmy and Eric Simon which lampoons the US Detention Center at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nJohn McGrath, founder of the Scottish popular theatre company , argued that \"the theatre can never 'cause' a social change. It can articulate pressure towards one, help people celebrate their strengths and maybe build their self-confidence… Above all, it can be the way people find their voice, their solidarity and their collective determination.\"\n\nThe Iraq War is the focus of some recent British political drama; for example, \"Stuff Happens\", by David Hare. David Edgar and Mark Ravenhill also satirize contemporary socio-political realities in their recent dramatic works.\n\nBanner Theatre in Birmingham, England, in the United Kingdom, is an example of a specific kind of political theatre called Documentary theatre.\n\n\n"}

He was born in New York City.\n\nPelham regularly did blackface acts in the early 1840s both solo and as part of a duo or trio. His early performances were in the mould of Thomas D. Rice; he did song-and-dance versions of \"Gumbo Chaff\" and \"Oh Pshaw!\", among others. His brother, Gilbert Pelham, paired with him for part of his early career. The song \"Massa Is a Stingy Man\" became their trademark tune. Pelham was also a renowned dancer; by 1845, he was ranked so highly that William Henry Lane did an impression of him.\n\nIn 1843, Pelham became one of the founding members of the Virginia Minstrels, the first group to present a full minstrel show during a performance at the New York Bowery Amphitheatre on February 6, 1843. Through April 1843, he played tambourine as the Virginia Minstrels toured New York City and Boston. Pelham's style was something new for the time; in addition to traditional techniques, he played it like a drum. Pelham and Frank Brower, who played the bones, were the first minstrel endmen, and greatly influenced the stereotype. Pelham's stage demeanor involved \"looks and movements comic beyond conception. He seemed animated by a savage energy; and [the handling of his instrument] . . . nearly wrung him off his seat. His white eyes rolled in a curious frenzy . . . and his hiccupping chuckles were unsurpassable.\" Pelham's signature non-musical bit was his \"A Brief Battering at the Blues\", a comic monologue and prototypical stump speech.\n\nOn April 21, 1843, when the group broke up. Pelham decided to settle in England. He briefly helped reform the Virginia Minstrels in the spring of 1844 when he met up with Brower and Joel Sweeney in Liverpool. The trio convinced Dan Emmett to rejoin, and the new ensemble played the Theatre Royal, Dublin, from April 24 to May 7 . They toured through June, then broke up again.\n\nOver the next few decades, Pelham continued to perform, only now with British minstrel troupes. Pablo Fanque, one of Victorian England's most celebrated circus proprietors (later immortalized in The Beatles song \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\"), helped popularize a Pelham sketch in England through performances at his circus in the 1860s. One of the most popular routines at Pablo's circus at Bolton in 1868 was Pelham's \"Wha's Your Ticket?\" in which an actor portrays \"the character of a Negro engaged to collect tickets at a bal masque with express instructions to allow no one to pass without, but who by his blundering allows all to enter without that requisite.\" The sketch was described in 1859 as a \"new afterpiece expressly imported from New Orleans by permission of R.W. Pelham Esq.\" The sketch was still being performed in England as a \"laughable American sketch\" as late as 1888.\n\nThe huge success of a recent British tour by the African-American Master Juba may have adversely affected Pelham's career there as his performance suffered in comparison. His final performance was on August 19, 1856. Richard Pelham eventually married an English actress. He died in or near Liverpool in October 1876.\n\n"}

She studied acting and established her Danish reputation playing Anna in Brecht's \"Drums in the Night\". During her teenage years, she financed a bicycle tour of France, by writing up a somewhat fictionalized account of her travels for a Danish newspaper. In 1930, she toured the Soviet Union by bicycle, and on her return joined the communist party. Later she took part behind the front lines in the Spanish civil war.\n\nIn 1933, she presented herself to the newly arrived Brecht and his wife Helene Weigel, then staying on the island of Fyn, and within two years had become his lover. In 1936, she divorced the doctor Robert Lund and threw herself into a collaboration with Brecht, acting as a secretary as well as writing, translating, photographing and directing. With Brecht, Berlau published the short story collection \"Jedes Tier kann es\", considered obscene in its time. In 1940, she followed the Brecht clan to Sweden, Finland, the USSR and finally to the United States, where a rupture with Brecht took place in 1944. In New York, she gave birth to her only child, who was premature and only lived for a few days.\n\nAfter the war, she followed the Brechts to Berlin, but was blacklisted from the Berliner Ensemble by Weigel, after Brecht's death in 1956. She died in the Charité hospital after setting her bed alight with a cigarette.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1064519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1064519", "title": "Soyuzmultfilm", "text": "Soyuzmultfilm\n\nSoyuzmultfilm ( , \"Union Cartoon\") is a Russian animation studio based in Moscow. Over the years it has gained international attention and respect, garnering numerous awards both at home and abroad. Noted for a great variety of style, it is regarded as the most influential animation studio of the former Soviet Union. The studio has produced 1,582 films .\n\nIt is currently divided into two studios: Creative Union of the Soyuzmultfilm Film Studio («Творческо-производственное объединение «Киностудия «Союзмультфильм») and the Soyuzmultfilm Film Fund («Фильмофонд Киностудии «Союзмультфильм»).\n\nThe studio was founded on 10 June 1936 under the name Soyuzdetmultfilm (Союздетмультфильм – abbr. from Union Children's Animations). The name was changed to Soyuzmultfilm on 20 August 1937. Initially comprising only a few scattered workshops, Soyuzmultfilm grew quickly, soon becoming the Soviet Union's premier animation studio. The studio produced exclusively traditional animation until 1954, when a \"puppet division\" was founded and the studio's first stop motion-animated film released. The puppet division would later also make cutout-animated films.\n\nDuring the Soviet era, the studio employed a maximum of over 700 skilled labourers and released an average of 20 films each year (the highest number was 47, in 1973). The studio was one of the most ethnically-integrated cultural industries in the Soviet Union.\n\nOver the next five decades, many Soyuzmultfilms contained characters who would eventually become an integral part of Soviet culture, such as \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" (), \"Crocodile Gena\" (), \"Film, Film, Film\" (), \"Karlsson-on-the-Roof\" (), \"The Musicians of Bremen\" (), \"Three from Prostokvashino\" (), \"Nu, pogodi!\" (), \"Hedgehog in the Fog\" (), and \"The Mystery of the Third Planet\" ().\n\nThe variety of animation styles and the unprecedented degree of artistic freedom given to its many animators made Soyuzmultfilm perhaps the most diverse of the world's major animation studios. Soyuzmultfilm's creativity was fueled in part by the socialist economy of the Soviet Union, which obviated the goal of profitability. Because animators were paid by the Academy of Film regardless of how well or how poorly their products sold (though they were not, in fact, \"sold\"), they were free to pursue their artistic vision without giving a thought to finances.\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union brought to a close the golden era of Soyuzmultfilm. New economic realities made it impossible for the government to support the studio any longer.\nIn 1989, Soyuzmultfilm was made into a leased enterprise (expiring after 10 years) and forced into the capitalist marketplace.\n\nAlthough the studio survived, it shrank dramatically, losing nearly 90% of its staff and releasing only a few films. One early misfortune happened when the Russian courts transferred the studio's puppet division building (in a legal decision involving many other buildings) to the Russian Orthodox Church. Before the animators could react to this turn of events, an Orthodox Cossack squadron, accompanied by religious locals, broke into the building with swords unsheathed for the purpose of exorcism and began throwing out the \"satanic puppets animated with the blood of Christian babies\". No studio employees were allowed to come in and salvage any item, despite the presence of much expensive equipment and a whole library of puppets.\n\nThe main reason for the collapse, however, was the studio's deliberate dismantling by the new top management and the illegal selling off of its assets for personal gain (see: – in Russian). In 1992–1993, Sergei Skulyabin was elected president.\n\nIn 1999, Soyuzmultfilm came back under the control of the government. A government edict on 12 August 2003 divided the company into two separate companies. The separation was finalised on 1 March 2004.\n\nThe rights of all Soyuzmultfilm films before 1 March 2004 belong to the \"Soyuzmultfilm Film Fund\", headed by Ernest Rakhimov, and its official mission is restoring and marketing them. The mission of the \"Creative union of the \"Film studio \"Soyuzmultfilm\", headed by Akop Kirakosyan, is to create new films (anywhere from 3–7 short films a year) and to eventually privatize itself (currently, 100% of its stock is owned by the Russian Ministry of Culture).\n\nThe next year, Soyuzmultfilm created an animated opening title for the children's TV show \"Ulitsa Sezam\".\n\nIn August 2013, the studio relocated to Moscow's Design Bureau of Film Equipment, after spending 68 years in their former premises. According to artistic director Michael Aldashin, \"Everything must be decided within a year. There are too many technical and bureaucratic problems, but we are clearly moving.\" Aldashin also cited the limited space in the premises as a factor behind the move.\n\nAs of 2013, Soyuzmultfilm is contemplating the production of computer-animated and educational films, as well as video games. Since the early 2000s, the studio has worked on the upcoming feature film \"Hoffmaniada\". Backed by Mikhail Shemyakin and directed by Stanislav Sokolov, it will be based on the tales of E. T. A. Hoffmann. The film will use stop motion animation exclusively and will avoid using computer animation for special effects. The first 20 minutes were screened on 20 November 2006, in Saint Petersburg, and the full film is planned for a 2016 release.\n\nIn 1992, the studio signed a deal with the American company Films by Jove, owned by Russian immigrant actor Oleg Vidov and his American wife Joan Borsten. It was the first international offer that the studio had received. The deal stipulated that Films by Jove would be granted the rights to 547 of the most popular classic studio films for a period of 10 years in all territories except the CIS; as part of the return, Soyuzmultfilm would receive 37% of the net profits. Films by Jove restored many of the films and released many of them on television, video and DVD in the United States and Europe, albeit usually with dubbed voices and changed music.\n\nAccording to current director Akop Kirakosyan, the original deal seemed promising at the time but turned out to be \"deadly\" for the studio. The expected payouts never materialized because Films by Jove never posted any net profits; all of the money officially went to things such as new soundtracks, lawsuits and copy protection measures.\n\nWhether either deal was legal was debated in court, with the Soyuzmultfilm Film Fund (see section below) claiming that because the company's lease on its possessions would have expired in 1999 (at which time ownership would have automatically reverted to the government if no new lease were signed), Soyuzmultfilm had no authority to issue rights that lasted beyond that timeframe. Joan Borsten presented a different story. In the end, the Russian courts sided with Soyuzmultfilm and the American courts sided with Films by Jove.\n\nU.S. Federal Court found that the Russian government has twice tried to invalidate Judge Trager's August 2001 summary judgment decision in favor of Films By Jove and transfer the copyrights to a library of 1,500 animated films, which Films by Jove licensed from Soyuzmultfilm Studios in 1992 to a new state-owned company. The judge found evidence of \"continued actions being taken by the Russian government and judiciary to influence the outcome of this United States litigation with the purpose of depriving plaintiff Films by Jove of its right to distribute the animated films in the United States and elsewhere outside the former Soviet Union.\" The voulminous and very thorough decision further noted that, \"In the case at bar, expropriation of the property of an American company by an act of a foreign sovereign is unquestionably against the public policy of the United States.\" \n\nOn 11 April 2007, Russian businessman Alisher Usmanov announced that he was in the final stages of negotiating a price with Films by Jove to buy back the collection. A source close to Usmanov said that Films by Jove's initial price was $10 million, while Usmanov is willing to pay \"several times less\", as he considers that the rights already belong to Soyuzmultfilm and that he himself is only buying the physical film prints. In September 2007, the deal was finalized, and Usmanov handed everything over to Russian state children's TV channel Bibigon.\n\nAnimators & directors\n\n\nActors\n\n\n"}

It amended the regime established under the Licensing Act 1737 for the licensing of the theatre in Great Britain, implementing the proposals made by a select committee of the House of Commons in 1832. \n\nUnder the Licensing Act 1737 (10 Geo.II, c. 28), the Lord Chamberlain was granted the ability to vet the performance of any new plays: he could prevent any new play, or any modification to an existing play, from being performed for any reason, and was not required to justify his decision. New plays were required to be submitted to the Lord Chamberlain for a licence before they could be performed, and theatre owners could be prosecuted for staging a play (or part of a play) that had not received prior approval. A licence, once granted, could be also withdrawn. The Licensing Act 1737 also limited spoken drama to the patent theatres, originally only the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and Theatre Royal, Covent Garden in London. The regime was relaxed slightly by the Theatrical Representations Act 1788, under which local magistrates were permitted to license occasional performances for periods of up to 60 days.\n\nThe Theatres Act 1843 restricted the powers of the Lord Chamberlain, so that he could only prohibit the performance of plays where he was of the opinion that \"it is fitting for the preservation of good manners, decorum or of the public peace so to do\". It also gave additional powers to local authorities to license theatres, breaking the monopoly of the patent theatres and encouraging the development of popular theatrical entertainments, such as saloon theatres attached to public houses and music halls. \n\nThe regime established by the 1843 Act was considered by a select committee of the House of Commons in 1866, and two Parliamentary Joint Select Committees, in 1909 and then in 1966, and various reforms were proposed, but no changes were implemented until the Act was finally repealed by the Theatres Act 1968.\n\nThe Act in general was restricted to Great Britain, and more specifically to the vicinities of London, Oxbridge, and royal residences. When George Bernard Shaw's 1909 play \"The Shewing-Up of Blanco Posnet\" was refused a licence by the Lord Chamberlain, it was staged in Liverpool and Dublin by the Abbey Theatre players.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1140209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1140209", "title": "Toss juggling", "text": "Toss juggling\n\nToss juggling is the form of juggling which is most recognisable as 'juggling'. Toss juggling can be used as: a performing art, a sport, a form of exercise, as meditation, a recreational pursuit or hobby.\n\nIn toss juggling, objects — such as balls, bean bags, rings, clubs, etc. — are thrown or tossed into the air and caught. Toss juggling is a form of object manipulation.\n\n'Toss juggling' has a number of basic principles and patterns. Most of the more complex patterns are variations of the basic ones and all toss juggling must conform to these basic principles.\n\nToss juggling is, according to most sources, the throwing and catching of objects, where there are more objects than there are hands (or sometimes other parts of the body) doing the throwing and catching. Three balls thrown and caught between two hands is toss juggling, as there are more balls than hands. Two balls between two hands would not be considered toss juggling, as the number of balls and hands is equal.\n\nThere are three basic patterns in toss juggling with many variations, some exceedingly complex, that are based on these basic patterns.\n\nThe \"shower\" is the most commonly depicted pattern in pictures and illustrations of jugglers (although often wildly exaggerated). The objects juggled follow a circular pattern with one hand doing higher throws and the other passing or doing low throws to the first hand. This pattern can be used to juggle an odd number or even number of objects. In siteswap notation, a three object shower would be called 51.\n\nThe \"cascade\" pattern is often the first pattern taught to beginner jugglers. The objects juggled follow a horizontal figure of eight pattern with each hand throwing the object to the same height when the previous throw has reached it peak. This pattern is most commonly used to juggle an odd number of objects. In siteswap notation, a three object cascade would be called 3.\n\nThe \"fountain\" is where each hand throws and catches objects and they do not transfer to the opposite hand. This pattern is most commonly used to juggle an even number of objects. In siteswap notation, a four object fountain would be called 4.\n\nBesides the cascade (or reverse cascade), other toss patterns include the \"box\" or \"column\", and any number of multiplex patterns or contact juggling tricks within the pattern.\n\nThere are also amusing stunts such as the \"Yo-yo\" and the \"Robot\", which give the illusion that the balls are connected to each other or to the juggler's body. By adding elementary skills to any juggling pattern the pattern can be increased, incrementally, in complexity.\n\nThere are even wildly intricate patterns such as the \"Mills Mess, \"which is widely attributed to Steve Mills of The Dazzling Mills Family. For a given pattern any number of variants may occur to the juggler, for instance, Mills Mess has at least three well-known variants, produced by adding flourishes such as \"chops\", \"holds\", \"stalls\", and \"carries\". \"Mills\" colloquially refers to any pattern in juggling where the hands cross back and forth over one another. Any pattern valid in siteswap notation can be done \"vanilla\", reverse, and in Mills.\n\nBelow is a list of other common three-ball patterns.\n\nJuggling has been used as a performance skill for thousands of years. Toss juggling has been significant in such performances and has continued to be a major part of juggling performances up to the present day. Juggling performances are of two main types: a performance which shows off the technical skill of the juggler and a performance of juggling with comedy. These two main types can be performed as shows, as walkabout entertainment or as stationary freestyle entertainment. All types of performances can be accompanied by music, other circus skills or other performers.\n\nPassing is the juggling skill of throwing objects between two or more jugglers. The most common passing combination is where two jugglers throw six objects between them and perform various tricks in addition to that basic pattern. The number of objects juggled between two people can be increased with 7, 8 and even nine object passing being a common occurrence. Higher numbers have also been achieved with the current record for club passing being 13 clubs passed (juggled) between the two jugglers. \n\nA variation on passing, called \"feeding\", is performed by three or more jugglers. The most common combination is performed by three jugglers: one juggler (the \"feeder\") passes alternately to each of the other two jugglers (the \"feedees\") while they stand in a 'triangle'. The tempo of the juggling as well as the way the objects are thrown between the jugglers can be varied. Feeding can be performed with one feeder feeding multiple feedees or a mix of multiple feeders and feedees in one pattern.\n\nPassing and feeding patterns and tricks in toss juggling range from the simple to the very complex. New patterns and tricks are developed and practiced at juggling conventions.\n\nAs a sport, juggling can be done competitively, with the jugglers attempting to improve upon the tricks or performances of other jugglers within a range of disciplines and categories. Competitions are held for both solo and multiple juggling competitors. Jason Garfield popularised this form of juggling in the USA. This style of juggling became more popular after he organised a World Juggling Federation competition in 2004 which has now become an annual event.\n\nAs exercise, juggling is a highly aerobic activity, increasing the heart rate and respiration. Juggling helps one to develop good hand-eye coordination, physical fitness and balance.\n\nJuggling helps to develop quick reflexes, and in fact, jugglers develop \"higher-order reflexes\", reflexes not typically associated with normal human activity. These reflexes are formed through repetition of what are, at first, slowly learned and difficult processes. As the various processes develop into reflexive actions, additional, more difficult or complex skills are 'layered' atop previous, well-developed skills. These new more complex skills eventually become more reflexive, and eventually, various unusual high order reflexes develop. An example is that, while catching a raw chicken's egg may be quite challenging to a novice juggler, a more skilled juggler might be able to easily catch — unbroken — an egg thrown towards him without warning.\n\nParadoxically, the same processes that are well known for exercising the body, can also be a very relaxing activity. As meditation, juggling a repeating pattern or patterns can take one's mind off the stresses they might encounter in their daily lives. Jugglers have described a phenomenon of near-disembodiment and tranquility which may come over them while juggling. The constant rising and falling of the objects, the regularity of the rhythms, can become almost hypnotic, and the attention of a juggler while tightly focused on the juggling pattern may seem to expand and even to \"encompass the universe.\"\n\nAs a recreational pursuit, juggling excels in many ways. Besides the previously mentioned health benefits, any form of juggling is at its best when done socially. The equipment is inexpensive or free — though very costly equipment is also available — and easily portable. Juggling is great for \"breaking the ice\" at parties and other social gatherings . Jugglers are a friendly sort, usually, and are often very willing to help beginning jugglers with advice. Juggling conventions, clubs and other gatherings where jugglers congregate can be great places to meet and share the art of juggling, for experts novices and even 'non-jugglers' — who often find themselves doing some form of juggling themselves.\n\nIn 1990 it was estimated by the International Jugglers' Association that twenty-three percent of Americans can juggle a three-ball cascade.\n\n\n"}

The game is a video karaoke, judging individuals performances.\n\nYooStar Entertainment's first product – \"YooStar 1\", for PC and Mac – was initially released in an exclusive marketing partnership with the Bloomingdale's department store chain on August 26, 2009.\n\nTo populate the \"Yoostar\" clip library, in-house artists digitally erase actors or other key figures in a licensed film or television clip. The company has patented this technique.The user films him- or herself saying either the original lines from the clip using the software’s teleprompter, or ad-libbing their own version. A chalk outline is overlaid on the scene to help position the user in scale with the other actors. The user is allowed as many takes as needed to get a satisfactory result. The software then composites the user’s filmed content with the original clip in the same fashion Hollywood actors are filmed against green screens on set and inserted into digitally created backgrounds. The final product is then labeled and stored on the user's local machine, with the option to upload to Yoostar's website. The site provides the ability to embed content in any Flash-supporting HTML environment using raw code, or in blogging platforms and social networking sites such as Facebook. Yoostar site users can rate, comment, and share content with the public or a group of \"Friends,\" depending on each clip's settings.\n\nOn Tuesday June 15, 2010, to coincide with the beginning of the 2010 Electronic Entertainment Expo, Yoostar announced a second version of the game and launched a new website called \"Yoostar 2\". \"Yoostar 2\" is playable via the Xbox 360 (Kinect required) and PlayStation 3 (PlayStation Eye required, PlayStation Move optional) video game consoles. Yoostar2 includes 80 film scenes from major Hollywood studios.\n\n\"Yoostar 2\", for the Xbox 360 Kinect and PlayStation Move released in North America on March 8, 2011. In the fall of 2011, Yoostar cooperated with MTV to allow users to star in scenes from MTV's TV shows and music videos. \"Yoostar on MTV\", for Xbox 360 Kinect released in North America on November 15, 2011.\n"}

For the purposes of the show, the hosts are referred to as \"navigators\". The entire 5 hours is broadcast live on the Yoshimoto's television channel, Fandago TV, which is dedicated to broadcasting live \"owarai\" acts and Yoshimoto variety, and is also broadcast over the internet.\n\nThe contents of each show generally rotate according to a weekly schedule featuring many corners common to Japanese television, although guests and special appearances on the stage vary widely from day to day. Almost all of the guests on \"Yoshimoto Mugendai\" are minor Yoshimoto comedians, although much more famous acts (such as Jichō Kachō) have made appearances in the past.\n\nThere is an official monthly magazine for Yoshimoto Mugendai and the hall called YOOH! (shown right), featuring interviews with the guests and information on future shows.\n\n"}
