{"id": "4453714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4453714", "title": "Age of Empires: The Age of Kings", "text": "Age of Empires: The Age of Kings\n\nAge of Empires: The Age of Kings is a turn-based strategy video game developed by Backbone Entertainment and published by Majesco Entertainment for the Nintendo DS handheld video game console.\n\n\"The Age of Kings\" allows the player to command any one of five historical civilizations: the Britons, Franks, Mongols, Saracens and Japanese. It has a single-player campaign and scenario mode, as well as a multiplayer wireless and hotseat mode.\n\n\"The Age of Kings\" is turn-based. As a derivative of the \"Age of Empires\" series, other games of which are real-time strategy as opposed to turn-based strategy, \"The Age of Kings\" incorporates several features and mechanics commonly associated with real-time strategy, including technology advancement and resource and building management.\n\nThe playing field is divided into a grid, with the player having an overhead perspective of the map. Units are able to move a certain amount of spaces in the four cardinal directions, with how far they can go affected by several variables, including the unit's natural movement abilities and terrain. Each unit type is given a specific amount of spaces that it can move, with some having better movement capabilities than others. There are a variety of terrain types, such as roads, forests and grass. Roads are best for movement, while some terrains slow the player down but can provide other advantages, such as extra range or defense.\n\nEach of the five civilizations has its own hero, which is stronger than other units. The Japanese hero is Minamoto no Yoshitsune; the Saracens' hero is Saladin; the Mongols' hero is Genghis Khan; the Franks' heroine is Joan of Arc; and the Britons' hero is King Richard the Lionheart. Each hero has special abilities which are unique to them. Each civilization is also unique in the sense that they have different Unit Art (the Franks and Britons share art, and the Mongols and the Saracens share art), different Special Units (powerful civilization-specific units trainable from castles), and different high- and low-cost units.\n\nMost units are divided into four main categories: Infantry, cavalry, ranged and siege units. Infantry and cavalry units are only able to attack an enemy unit or structure in any adjacent square (with the exception of squares which are diagonally adjacent), while ranged units and some siege units are able to attack from a greater distance. Each unit has movement, attack, defense, range and vision values. Some units may have additional defensive bonuses against certain types of enemy units or abilities.\n\nThere are many variables to be taken into account before battling an enemy. Before entering the battle, the game will display the statistics of both units, which consists of the units' health points, attack power, and defensive capabilities. This screen shows an adviser, who predicts the chance a given attack has of being successful. The attack power and defensive capabilities of the attacking unit vary depending on the opposing unit's special abilities. When the units enter into battle, many warriors are seen, which begin to battle each other. The attacking units usually do more damage as they get the first strike. As a unit's HP drops, their attack power does as well.\n\nThe player can advance their civilization by researching new units, technologies and other advancements. Once the player advances far enough in research or completes certain conditions, a new age is made available. Players usually start in the first age, the Dark Age, and progress through later ages, including the Feudal, Castle and Imperial ages. Advancing in age unlocks new subjects for the player to research, makes additional buildings and units available, and upgrades existing units to their equivalent in the new age.\n\n\"The Age of Kings\" includes a campaign divided into five sections, one for each civilization. Each section contains five or six missions. The first section of the campaign, following Joan of Arc, acts as a tutorial and educates the player about the basics of the game. Campaign missions vary widely in characteristics. Some contain a field effect known as the fog of war, and in some missions the player starts out with some buildings while in others the player may start without any. By playing to earn \"Empire Points\", the player can buy powerful units to use in-game from the Bonus Items Shop, as well as new maps to play on in Single Scenario (freeplay) mode. Each mission has main goals as well as secondary goals, the latter of which increase the amount of Empire Points gained when the mission is completed.\n\n\"The Age of Kings\" contains a multiplayer mode which can support up to four players. Multiplayer can be played on a single DS in hotseat mode, or in wireless multi-card mode, where each player has a DS and a copy of the game.\n\nThe vast majority of content from \"Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings\" was ported to the DS, in what \"Official Nintendo Magazine\" described as a huge task. The sole exception was said to be the political scheming in the PC version, though there was still some contained in the DS counterpart.\n\n\"Age of Empires: The Age of Kings\" has received an average score of 80.0% at GameRankings (based on 45 reviews), and an average score of 80/100 at Metacritic (based on 38 reviews). IGN gave it an 8.2/10, saying that the gameplay was solid, although they stated that it should have had more civilizations and online play. Both IGN and Electronic Gaming Monthly each gave it a Game of the Month award. It received an award for \"Best Game Design\" Elan award in the inaugural Canadian Awards for the Electronic & Animated Arts on September 14, 2006. It was also nominated for 2006 BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Award): Best Strategy Game.\n\nSome players have experienced technical issues which can impair gameplay or damage the data on the cartridge. The game data can become corrupted during a save and quit operation, preventing the cartridge from booting afterwards. A term for this is called a \"bricked cartridge\". The game may sometimes freeze in a battle involving scorpion units and after the end of a mission. Majesco released claims that they were investigating the issue but no official solution or replacements have ever become available, only workarounds.\n\nMajesco has determined that using a short profile name (two to three characters in length) may be causing some issues and has suggested users change their profile name to at least four characters as a temporary workaround. Majesco eventually began inserting a slip of paper into all copies of \"The Age of Kings\" they produced, which warned users of the problem and provided the workaround.\n\nAlso the \"Longswordsman\" unit, when selected, doesn't display a \"unit name\".\n\nDue to financial difficulties, Majesco has restructured their website and removed their forums. The original information regarding the technical issues is no longer directly available. However, the glitches are mentioned in a review from Mygamer.com: \"The game also has a number of bugs that freeze the game up during battles or when you save.\"\n\n"}

The event is a two-day skating show generally in October, which regularly attracts world-class skaters, thousands of spectators, hundreds of Harvard students, special guests, and donors. The show is entirely student-run and is managed completely by volunteer work. All profits go to the Jimmy Fund, one of New England's most cherished charities, and EWC is one of the oldest continually-running fundraising events for the charity. The Jimmy Fund supports pediatric and adult cancer research and treatment at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. After the 45th show in 2015, An Evening with Champions has donated over $2.9 million for the Jimmy Fund.\n\nThe show was originally conceived in 1970 by John Misha Petkevich, the two-time Olympic competitor who was at that time a junior at Harvard living in Eliot House, which became (and has remained) the official host of the show. The show has been continually produced every fall since 1970, with the exception of a special spring show in April 2010, commemorating the 40th anniversary of EWC.\n\nMany current and former U.S. and international champions and Olympic competitors have appeared in the show over the years. The show usually features a mix of up-and-coming elite competitors and established champions. Past shows' skaters have included Michelle Kwan, Brian Boitano, Yuna Kim, Scott Hamilton, Kristi Yamaguchi, Ekaterina Gordeeva, and the Haydenettes synchronized skating team who have made EWC their opening appearance for many years. Paul Wylie, himself a former resident of Eliot House, has generally hosted the show since 1998. Beginning in 2011, Wylie has been joined by Emily Hughes as Co-Host. Ludmila Belousova and Oleg Protopopov, two-time Olympic Champions, have also had a particularly long association with the show and continue to make annual appearances.\n\nThe show was formerly televised each year on PBS, but the broadcast ended in 2001. More recently, it had been televised on the Comcast Network cable channel CN8.\n\nBeginning in 2012, EWC launched \"Skating with Champions,\" a fundraising initiative in which fans can fundraise solo or in a team to win an invitation to perform in the show alongside the main cast.\n\nThe 2010 show of An Evening with Champions celebrated the 40th anniversary of the charity with a special spring show taking place on April 16 and 17, 2010, as opposed to a show in the fall. The main cast included Olympians Mark Ladwig and Amanda Evora, two-time Olympic champions Ludmila Belousova and Oleg Protopopov, and Olympian (and Harvard student) Emily Hughes. Many former Olympians and national champions joined the main cast to celebrate the anniversary, including Sarah Hughes, Paul Wylie, and Dorothy Hamill. The show was co-hosted by Peggy Fleming and Dick Button, who temporarily replaced Wylie.\n\nChas Lee pleaded guilty to charges of embezzling over $100,000 from the show in 1991 and 1992, when he was co-chair of the event as an Eliot House undergraduate. David Sword, another Harvard undergraduate who was the event's treasurer during that time, was also convicted of embezzling a lesser amount. The scandal received considerable press coverage when the theft was uncovered in 1994.\n\n"}
{"id": "2090870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2090870", "title": "Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth", "text": "Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth\n\nAustralian Capital Television v Commonwealth, was a significant case decided in the High Court of Australia on 30 September 1992. It concerned the constitutional validity of Part IIID of the \"Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act\" 1991, which regulated political advertising during election campaigns, and required broadcasters to broadcast political advertisements free of charge at other times. The High Court found the laws to be invalid, since they contravened an implied freedom of political communication in the Australian Constitution.\n\nIn 1992, the Government of Australia (\"the Commonwealth\") under Prime Minister Bob Hawke passed the \"Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1991\", which inserted part IIID into the \"Broadcasting Act 1942\". The changes had a number of effects, the most important of which prohibited the broadcasting of politically related material on electronic media such as radio and television during the period leading up to a State or Federal election (except in news, current affairs or talkback programs). The laws also obliged broadcasters to provide \"free time\" to political parties to air advertisements. Kim Beazley, then the Minister for Transport and Communications, said that the changes were designed to limit corruption, and prevent donors to political parties from exerting undue influence, by restricting the amount of political advertising that could be broadcast. He said that due to the practical cost of advertising, it was only the major parties and very wealthy individuals who could afford to broadcast advertisements. The Government said they had wanted to avoid a situation such as that in the United States, where it is virtually impossible for anyone but the very rich to participate in the political process.\n\nWith some exceptions, the laws prohibited broadcasters from broadcasting matter for or on behalf of the government or government agencies, and from broadcasting political advertisements (\"matter intended or likely to affect voting in the election\", or matter explicitly referring to the election) on behalf of themselves or other individuals during an election period. The \"free time\" would be divided between the parties based on the amount of representation they had in the Parliament, with only five percent available to other groups, who had to apply for an allocation of free time.\n\nThe eight plaintiffs in the case were commercial television broadcasters who held broadcasting licences under the \"Broadcasting Act\". They asked the High Court to declare that Part IIID of the act was invalid. In a related action which was heard at the same time, the Government of New South Wales also challenged the laws, particularly their application to by-elections. The Government of South Australia intervened in the case in support of the Commonwealth.\n\nThe most important argument made by the plaintiffs was that the new laws interfered with a right to free political speech which was implied in the Constitution. They also argued that the parts of the Act requiring that broadcasters give \"free time\" to certain people was an unjust acquisition of property. The Government of New South Wales argued that the laws were discriminatory against the states and they interfered with the proper business of State Governments.\n\nThe principal argument from the plaintiffs was that the changes to the \"Broadcasting Act\" contravened an implied right to freedom of participation and communication in political processes. They argued that this right to free political speech arose from the system of representative government which is provided by the Constitution, or alternatively, it arose from the \"common citizenship of the Australian people.\" Sir Maurice Byers QC, who acted for the plaintiffs, paraphrasing former Justice Isaac Isaacs argued that the principle that governments are responsible to the citizens who elect them \"permeates the Constitution, forming part of the fabric on which the written words of the Constitution are superimposed,\" and as such, all voters should be entitled to make comment on political issues.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that since a right to free political communication was recognised in other parliamentary democracies, such as in the United States by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and in Canada by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, it should be recognised in Australia. They said that because the provisions in Part IIID limited the allocation of \"free time\" to people or groups already represented in the Parliaments, new parties or people not in the Parliament would not be able to express their views.\n\nThe Commonwealth argued that the laws enhanced rather than diminished the electoral process, because they prevented corruption, and allowed parties which did not have large amounts of money to have access to radio and television broadcasting. They said that the Parliament has valid powers to protect the integrity of the electoral process under sections 10, 29, 31, 51(36) and 51(39) of the Constitution. Furthermore, they argued that even if there was some implied right to freedom of political communication, this could not override valid legislation. The Commonwealth also pointed out that similar laws operated in countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Norway and Sweden, and that countries such as Canada, Germany, Japan and New Zealand had a system of allocating free broadcasting time for political purposes during election periods.\n\nThe Government of South Australia, who intervened in support of the Commonwealth, said that if the framers of the Constitution had intended to include provisions for a right of free speech as in the United States Constitution, they would have done so. They said that although some freedom of communication could reasonably be implied into the Constitution, the parts of the Act in question did not have the effect of preventing \"free and meaningful elections\" from taking place, and so the laws were not invalid.\n\nThe High Court agreed that the new part IIID of the \"Broadcasting Act\" had the effect of limiting the freedoms previously enjoyed by citizens to publicly discuss political matters. However, the question remained as to whether there was some sort of Constitutional basis for these freedoms, or whether the Commonwealth was justified in restricting them. While the court agreed that similar laws had been put in place overseas, that did not change the fact that the laws impaired freedom of communication, and privileged those political parties or interest groups who were already represented in the Parliament. The laws would not only disadvantage candidates challenging sitting members, but would severely hinder groups such as trade unions, charities or employers' groups, who may very well have a legitimate desire to make political statements.\n\nThe plaintiffs also argued that to force broadcasters to give portions of \"free time\" to the represented political parties and members of parliament had the effect of taking away their right to charge money for broadcasting advertisements. They suggested that taking away their advertising time and in effect giving it to the legislators constituted an acquisition of property by the Commonwealth, which according to section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution, has to be done \"on just terms.\"\n\nThe Commonwealth argued that the laws made no unjust acquisition of property, since broadcasting licences were not immune to being modified by the Parliament. They said that it was fair and just to require broadcasters to provide a limited amount of free service in the public interest. In any event, the Commonwealth suggested that \"free time\" granted by the Act was not a form of property anyway, since it could not be transferred to other people, one of the essential features of any form of property.\n\nUltimately the court did not decide on this issue, although Justice Brennan said that he agreed with the Commonwealth's argument that the \"free time\" was not a form of property.\n\nThe Government of New South Wales, in addition to supporting the claims of the other plaintiffs, also argued that Part IIID of the \"Broadcasting Act\" was invalid because it interfered with the executive functions of the States, and contravened sections 106 and 107 of the Constitution which protects the individual State Constitutions. They said that to interfere with the right of State Governments to make political advertisements went far beyond any legitimate power given to the Parliament of Australia by the Constitution. They also said that in any event, the changes to the Act should not apply to by-elections.\n\nThe Commonwealth argued that Part IIID of the Act did not single out the States, nor interfere with their proper activities, since State elections were treated in exactly the same way as Federal elections were.\n\nThe court decided that a right to freedom of political communication was essential to the system of representative government provided for in the Constitution. The court expressed the view that the reason why Australia does not have a bill of rights is because the framers of the Constitution believed that since Australia had a system of representative government, which gave all voters an equal share in political power, laws to protect rights were simply not necessary. To undermine the system of representative government was contrary to this trust which the people gave to the Parliaments, and was not permitted by the Constitution. Although this right is not an absolute one, it is still a right which allows for free and public political discussion.\n\nThe court also decided that the relevant laws, contained in Part IIID of the \"Broadcasting Act\", were invalid because there was no reasonable justification for the way they restricted the freedom of political communication. The court decided that the laws also impaired certain functions of the States in terms of their rights to make political advertisements, and so the laws were also invalid for that reason.\n\nThe case was one of the earliest in a series of cases in which the High Court found implied rights in the Constitution. This trend reached a High-point in \"Theophanous v Herald & Weekly Times Ltd\", which found that the implied right to freedom of political communication could be used as a defence in a defamation action. Although that is no longer the case, the limited right to freedom of communication remains. It was emphasised in later cases like \"Lange v ABC\", that political communication was not a personal right, rather a constitutional restriction on legislative power.\n\nIn discussing the nature of representative government, Chief Justice Mason expressed the view that although the Constitution originally drew its authority from the British Imperial Parliament, it would indeed be appropriate in modern times to recognise that Australian sovereignty derives its force from the Australian people.\n\n\n"}

The game was released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 on October 31, 2017. The game is the fifth entry in the \"Bubsy\" series, and the first new entry in 21 years.\n\nThe game returns to the 2D side-scrolling platformer gameplay found in the first \"Bubsy\" games, \"Bubsy in Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind\", \"Bubsy 2\" and \"Bubsy in Fractured Furry Tales\", albeit now with 3D character models, a first for the side-scrolling entries in the series.\n\nThe game sees Bubsy going against the \"Woolies\", the antagonistic race of creatures from the first \"Bubsy\" game.\n\nThe game was first announced on June 8, 2017, as a brand new game in the \"Bubsy\" series of video games. The entry is the first one in the series in 21 years, following 1996's \"Bubsy 3D\". The game was announced as the first of many game franchise revivals of Accolade games (which, along with \"Bubsy\", is a brand name now operated by Hong Kong company Billionsoft), including potential revivals of \"HardBall!\", \"Slave Zero\", \"\", \"Eradicator\", and \"Redline\". The game was published by Tommo's subsidiary UFO Interactive Games, and developed by Black Forest Games, who previously worked on reviving the dormant \"Giana Sisters\" series with \"\". Like \"Twisted Dreams\", the game was developed using the Havok physics engine.\n\nIn August 2017, a limited edition, called the \"Purrfect Edition\", was announced for the PlayStation 4 release, which contains a physical copy of the game, a soundtrack CD, a copy of Bubsy's official \"business card\", and a \"Mystery Bubsy Movie Poster postcard\".\n\nThe game announcement was generally not well received by video game journalists, whose reactions ranged from indifference to irritation. Accolade seemed to expect this, taking an approach similar to Sega with promoting \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" on social media; a dedicated Twitter account for the character that makes self-deprecating and aware comments about the franchise's negative reception of some past titles was created.\n\nThe game was met with a negative reception, with review aggregator Metacritic giving the PC version a weighted average score of 44 out of a possible 100 and the PS4 version a score of 45 out of 100, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Brian Shea of \"Game Informer\" panned the game, calling it \"an unnecessary resuscitation\". Patrick Hancock of \"Destructoid\" questioned why the character of Bubsy was brought back and made note of its release in the same year as other more well received platformers. Heidi Kemps of IGN dismissed the game as \"an extremely short and completely forgettable platformer based on nothing but irony and nostalgic notoriety\". Christian Donlan of \"Eurogamer\" wrote \"Bubsy's return is more than a little underwhelming\".

{"id": "2457508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2457508", "title": "Cabo Wabo", "text": "Cabo Wabo\n\nCabo Wabo is a nightclub and restaurant located in Cabo San Lucas, BCS, Mexico. Franchises exist in Harvey's Lake Tahoe in Stateline, Nevada, the Las Vegas Strip, and on Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California. It is also a popular brand of tequila. All were founded by rock musician Sammy Hagar.\n\nHagar, already a successful rock musician, visited the Mexican town of Cabo San Lucas in the early 1980s. Hagar joined Van Halen in July 1985 after the departure of their former singer, David Lee Roth. Seeking a place for himself and his friends to relax and play music, he convinced the Van Halen members to partner in opening a large bar, restaurant, and performance space. Launched in April 1990, the cantina was initially a financial failure, leading Hagar to buy out his bandmates. Under new management, the bar became popular with both locals and tourists as the town quickly grew into a major resort. In 2004, after plans fell through to open in Las Vegas, Hagar opened a second location in the basement of the historic Harvey's casino on the south shore of Lake Tahoe. A third location was opened in Fresno, California in 2008, but had its license pulled by Hagar at the beginning of 2009. Cabo Wabo Las Vegas opened in The Miracle Mile shopping center at Planet Hollywood in November 2009. The club typically attracts an older adult clientele with its mostly rock music selection.\n\nHagar claims he coined the name after watching a man walk unsteadily along a local beach after a heavy night's partying. Using the town's nickname, Cabo (which means \"cape\" in Spanish), and shortening \"wobble\" to \"wabo\" he said of the man that he was doing the \"Cabo wabo.\" Hagar later used the phrase in his lyrics and title for the Van Halen song. In 1990 he hired Noel Vestri, an innovator in computer graphic designs (including work on Vans Tennis Shoes) to design a logo for the brand, which is still used today.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Hagar began selling his patrons a house brand of hand-made tequila he commissioned from a family-owned distillery in the state of Jalisco. In 1999, a wine importer from Napa Valley began to import the tequila into the United States. An instant success, sales rose from 37,000 cases the first year to 140,000 cases in 2006, making it the second-best selling premium tequila in the United States.\n\nSeveral of the Cabo Wabo offerings have performed quite well at international spirit ratings competitions. The añejo offering received three silver, one gold and one double gold medal at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition between 2008 and 2012. Its reposado tequila received a score of 92 from the 2008 Beverage Testing Institute.\n\nIn May 2007 it was announced that Hagar would sell an 80% interest in Cabo Wabo Tequila to Gruppo Campari, the world's sixth-largest spirits company, for $80 million. Skyy Spirits of San Francisco, a vodka producer and subsidiary of Gruppo Campari, planned to market Cabo Wabo globally, with continued participation by Hagar. Gerry Ruvo, president and chief executive of Skyy Spirits, said, \"Sammy has done a fantastic job building the brand, so we are going to obviously spend time with him and work with him to continue our efforts to take the brand to an even larger level, both here in the US and, more important, globally.\" Ruvo said Great Britain, Spain, Australia, Southeast Asia, Japan, Germany and Italy are considered key expansion markets for tequila.\n\n"}

{"id": "1079156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1079156", "title": "David Rorvik", "text": "David Rorvik\n\nDavid Michael Rorvik (born 1944) is an American journalist and novelist who was the author of the 1978 book \"In his Image: The Cloning of a Man\" in which he claimed to have been part of a successful endeavor to create a clone of a human being. The book is widely considered to be a hoax.\n\nRorvik was born in Circle, Montana. He graduated with a B.A. from the University of Montana in 1966 and a M.S. \"summa cum laude\" from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in 1967. He worked as a science writer and a medical reporter for \"Time\" and contributed articles to numerous publications, including \"The New York Times\", and wrote several books.\n\nIn a 1969 magazine article, Rorvik outlined the Shettles Method to influence the sex of a child. Two years later, he and Landrum B. Shettles co-authored the bestselling book \"Your Baby's Sex: Now You Can Choose\". In 1976, Rorvik was awarded an Alicia Patterson Foundation Fellowship for investigatory reporting on the politics of cancer research worldwide. Some of his findings from this investigation were reported on in Harper's Magazine, the Washington Post and other publications. Earlier in his career, he was the recipient of a Pulitzer Traveling Fellowship for investigation of the effects of apartheid politics in Africa on press freedoms.\n\nIn \"In his Image\", Rorvik claimed that in 1973 a wealthy businessman he dubbed \"Max\" had contacted him and recruited him to find scientists willing to create a clone of him. Rorvik claims to have formed a scientific team that was taken to a lab at a secret location. After a few years of experimentation they managed to implant a specially prepared body cell nucleus into the cytoplast of a human ovum (a technique known as somatic cell nuclear transfer) and, in turn, succeeded in implanting this egg into the uterus of a surrogate mother, a local resident called \"Sparrow.\" A healthy child, it was claimed, was born nine months later. He stated in the book that he was able to tell the story only on the condition that he safeguard the identities of all involved and cautioned his readers that the book did not provide proof that the cloning had occurred, although he stated he was convinced that it had.\n\nBefore the book was published, the \"New York Post\" learned of the story and made it front-page news on March 3, 1978. Soon after, NBC's Tom Brokaw interviewed Rorvik on \"The Today Show\". The book was very popular and caused much discussion about the ethics of cloning. However, scientists including Yale University professor Clement Markert generally disbelieved Rorvik's claims. Efforts to clone mammals had not been undertaken at that time and it was widely assumed that there would be enormous obstacles to achieving successful mammalian cloning.\n\nBritish scientist Derek Bromhall filed a $7,000,000 defamation suit against Rorvik's publisher, J. B. Lippincott, alleging that the book was a hoax, that it incorporated parts of his doctoral thesis as the theoretical basis for the cloning process, and that it had used his name without permission. When Rorvik refused to reveal the identity of \"Max\" or provide proof of the existence of the clone, judge John Fullam found that the book was a \"fraud and a hoax\" in a pretrial ruling. The case went to trial in 1982, with the charges being reduced to invasion of privacy. The publisher soon entered into an out-of-court settlement that included a payment of $100,000 and a public representation that the book was a hoax. No evidence, however, was presented in pre-trial proceedings, during the trial, or thereafter that established either the truthfulness or the falsity of the book. Rorvik himself denied that there had been any hoax, and refused either to be party to the out-of-court settlement or to contribute to it financially. He wrote an article defending \"In his Image\" for \"Omni\" in 1997.\n\nRorvik has since written, ghost-written, edited and agented several books on diet and nutrition, psychology and other topics, including the \"Physician Desk Reference for Nutritional Supplements\" (2001). In 2006, a sixth edition of \"Your Baby's Sex: Now You Can Choose\" was published, marking nearly 40 years of continuous print.\n\n"}
{"id": "2916480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2916480", "title": "Deuteragonist", "text": "Deuteragonist\n\nIn literature, the deuteragonist or secondary main character (from , \"deuteragōnistḗs\", second actor) is the second most important character, after the protagonist and before the tritagonist. The deuteragonist may switch between supporting and opposing the protagonist, depending on the deuteragonist's own conflict or plot.\n\nGreek drama began with simply one actor, the protagonist, and a chorus of dancers. The playwright Aeschylus introduced the deuteragonist; Aristotle says in his \"Poetics\":\n\nAeschylus' efforts brought the dialogue and interaction between characters to the forefront and set the stage for other playwrights of the era, like Sophocles and Euripides, to produce many iconic plays.\n\nBecause Ancient Greek drama involved only three actors (the protagonist, deuteragonist, and tritagonist) plus the chorus, each actor often played several parts. For instance, in Sophocles' \"Oedipus Rex\", the protagonist would be Oedipus, who is on stage in most acts, the deuteragonist would be Jocasta (Oedipus' mother and wife), as well as the Shepherd and Messenger. This would be because Jocasta is certainly a major role—acting opposite Oedipus many times and occupying a central part of the story—and because the Shepherd and Messenger are onstage when Jocasta is offstage.\n\nIn literature, the deuteragonist often assumes the role of \"sidekick\" to the protagonist. In Mark Twain's \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\", the protagonist is Huck and the deuteragonist, his constant companion, is Jim. In this story the tritagonist would be Tom Sawyer. Conversely, the deuteragonist could also be a particularly visible antagonist, normally whom the actual antagonist hides behind. In some cases, the deuteragonist is a sidekick who is also used as a foil for the protagonist, in order to more greatly enhance the powers or strengths of the main character. Dr. John Watson, for example, in the Sherlock Holmes series by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is an educated and intelligent gentleman of professional standing, and yet his own intelligence is of too rigid a stance to embrace fully the kind of possibilities of which the more maverick Sherlock Holmes is capable.\n"}
{"id": "54171300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54171300", "title": "Double bass array", "text": "Double bass array\n\nA double bass array (DBA) is a specific layout of subwoofers within a rectangular listening space. It removes unwanted room related resonances (modes) over a wide listening area.\n\nA DBA requires at least two subwoofers (preferably same make and model) that are placed at opposing walls in a specific layout. The subwoofer array on the back wall is inverted and delayed based on the distance to the frontal subwoofer array. This will actively \"absorb\" any reflected sound.\n\nModes between side walls, floor and ceiling are suppressed by arranging the subwoofer in a specific grid:\n\nformula_1\n\nformula_2\nformula_3: Wall width\n\nformula_4: Wall height\n\nformula_5: Horizontal distance from wall (formula_6 for n=0 in picture)\n\nformula_7: Vertical distance from wall (formula_8 for n=0 in picture)\n\nformula_9: Number of subwoofers horizontally\n\nformula_10: Number of subwoofers vertically\n\nCounter formula_11\n\nWith this specific grid layout reflections from the walls act as mirror sources. Interference of the subwoofers and mirror sources create a plane wave up to a certain frequency. The more sources the higher the frequency. This cutoff frequency formula_12 can be calculated for each dimension as follows:\n\nformula_13\n\nformula_14: Speed of sound\n\nformula_15: Distance between subwoofers\n\nExample: A 4 × 4 array on a wall measuring 4 × 3 m would work up to 86Hz horizontally and up to 114Hz vertically.\n\nDue to the specific grid layout of the subwoofer array most modal effects are suppressed. The length modes on the other hand get fully excited. The array on the back wall will emit a polarity inverted wave at the very same moment the wave from the front wall hits the back wall. Reflection and inverted wave will interfere with each other destructively so the reflection is canceled. This is also known as \"active absorption\".\n\nThe necessary delay formula_16 of the back array is based on the length formula_17 of the room:\n\nformula_18\n\nformula_14: Speed of sound\n\nThe necessary delay required for a DBA is available in most digital equalizers or digital crossovers. Polarity of the back array can easily be achieved by inverting the signal coming from the amps or by swapping the cables going to the driver. Most active subwoofers also offer a polarity switch.\n\n\n\nA DBA just requires two opposing walls so it's possible to have one array on the floor and the other on the ceiling or one on the left wall and the other on the right. Low frequencies become localizable at a specific frequency though so in most cases it's probably a good idea to use the front wall and the back wall.\n\nIt largely depends on the room how good a DBA will work.\n\n"}

Players must fight through different floors of enemies until they reach a boss monster, which they must defeat to advance through the story. Combat takes place on contact with enemies, with no separate battle screen or menu system. A new feature to the series is the \"tension command\", that allows players to build up attack power to deliver strong blows upon enemies, though the character cannot move in this state. Later on in the game, and players can capture monsters with a special jug, and use them to attack opponents.\nPlayers may keep three monsters in their possession at any one time, and can be taught to use special abilities by using items and through combat experience. Monsters must reach level four, be given foods they like, and also a weapon before they will assist Yangus, and as they fight more and more, they will combine their strengths with other captured monsters. Players can also utilize a farmhouse late game where monsters can be kept and bred to create new and more powerful monsters. The game also uses cinematic and computer generated scenes with a comic-book style.\n\nThe game centers around the character Yangus, who is a main character in \"\", as a child. Described as a \"plump bandit\", he becomes involved with his father Yampa's gang of thieves when a mysterious jug is brought home. Though instructed not to touch the jug, Yangus does, and is sucked inside the bottle into another world called \"Bottle Land\". \nGelda, a female bandit from \"Dragon Quest VIII\" also appears in this new world, as well as Red, Morrie, Toruneko, and a new character named Poppy, and each begins to explore the dungeons of this new land.\n\nA trailer for the game was shown at the Jump Festival in Tokyo, December 2005.\nThe game's soundtrack features music from \"Dragon Quest VIII\", arranged by Hayato Matsuo, along with a few original compositions by Koichi Sugiyama.\n\nThe game sold over 301,000 copies in Japan by the end of 2006, ranking number 42 in sales overall for the year. The game was noted for its \"cartoonish 3D graphics\", and its full motion video was also praised. The original art style and cell-shaded graphics were highlighted for praise as well. Destructoid listed it as number 10 of their Top Ten favorite \"Dragon Quest\" games. IGN described the dungeon movement system in the game as \"clumsy\".

{"id": "15013399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15013399", "title": "Eurospy film", "text": "Eurospy film\n\nEurospy film, or Spaghetti spy film (especially when referring to Italian-produced films in the genre), is a genre of spy films produced across Europe, especially in Italy, France, and Spain, that either imitated or parodied the British James Bond series. The first wave of Eurospy films were released in 1964, two years after the first James Bond film, \"Dr. No\", and in the same year as the premiere of what many consider to be the apotheosis of the Bond series, \"Goldfinger\". For the most part, the Eurospy craze lasted until around 1967 or 1968. In Italy, where most of these films were produced, this trend replaced the declining sword and sandal genre.\n\nChristopher Frayling, who estimated the number of Eurospy films at 50, felt that they passed on such traits to the Spaghetti Western as emphasis on the technology of death, such as special weapons, the anonymity of the protagonist, the \"money = power\" equation of the villains and humorous asides that released the audience's laughter after a violent sequence.\n\nFor additional verisimilitude, these films often featured American and British stars in the lead roles. The heroes of the films were secret agents who were often given a name similar to \"James Bond\" (including \"Charles Bind\", \"Charles Vine\" and \"James Tont\"), and/or a code name matching, or similar to, James Bond's \"007\". Other Eurospy films made use of existing literary fictional spies, including Bulldog Drummond, Harry Palmer, Hubert Bonisseur de La Bath, AKA OSS 117 (who was not based on James Bond but rather had helped to inspire James Bond), Francis Coplan and Rolf Torring.\n\nSome European stars and their films were renamed and retitled to cash in on the superspy craze. For example, Jesus Franco's or \"Jess Frank\"'s 1962 \"La Muerte silba un Blues\" was later retitled \"077 Operation Jamaica\" or \"077 Operation Sexy\" with star Conrado San Martín rechristened \"Sean Martin\" to evoke images of Sean Connery and Dean Martin (who played Matt Helm). Germany's fictional hero Rolf Torring's film \"Der Fluch des Schwarzen Rubin\" was retitled \"Agente S3S Operazione Uranio\".\n\nSo many French and Italian films used \"007\" that United Artists told the Italian film industry that only James Bond could be 007, and threatened legal action. Working around this restriction, many films were given similar, but legally acceptable, three-digit numbers in their titles such as the Italian-Spanish \"A 001, operazione Giamaica\" a.k.a. \"Our Man in Jamaica\" (1965) and the Secret Agent 077 trilogy starring Ken Clark (\"Agent 077 – Mission Bloody Mary\", \"Agent 077 From the Orient with Fury\", and \"Special Mission Lady Chaplin\"). \"\" (1965) from director Umberto Lenzi features the first female Bond-type hero. Lenzi also made three films starring Roger Browne, \"Superseven chiama Cairo\" (1965), \"Last Man to Kill\" (1966), and \"The Spy Who Loved Flowers\" (1966). Browne was also in \"\" (1966).\n\nDirector Bruno Corbucci's James Tont series starring Lando Buzzanca is the earliest Italian comedy series based on 007. \"James Tont operazione U.N.O.\" (1965) features a female character named \"Goldsinger\" and underwater sequences that echo \"Thunderball\". This was quickly followed by the sequel \"James Tont operazione D.U.E.\" a.k.a. \"The Wacky World of James Tont\" (1965). Corbucci also wrote the screenplays for \"Kiss Kiss...Bang Bang\" (1966) and the Derek Flint parody \"Il vostro super agente Flit\" (1966). Another Bond spoof, \"Two Mafiosi Against Goldfinger\", also known as \"The Amazing Dr. G\" (1965), features Fernando Rey as a criminal mastermind named Goldginger.\n\nCIA agent Bob Fleming is featured in a trio of Italian films, \"Secret Agent Fireball\" also titled \"Da 077: le spie uccidono a Beirut\" (1965), \"Killers are Challenged\" a.k.a. \"A 077, sfida ai killers\" (1966), directed by Antonio Margheriti, and \"Fury in Marrakesh\", a.k.a. \"Furia a Marrakech\" (1966). Margheriti made one other spy film, \"Lightning Bolt\", a.k.a. \"Operazione Goldman\" (1966).\n\nOther notable examples include \"Berlin, Appointment for the Spies\", a.k.a. \"Spy in Your Eye\" (Italy, 1965), the French \"OSS 117\" André Hunebelle series based on the Jean Bruce character and Claude Chabrol's \"Tiger\" trilogy (\"Le Tigre aime la chair fraiche\", \"Le Tigre se parfume à la dynamite\", and \"Blue Panther\", a.k.a. \"Marie Chantal contre Dr.\"), and the German \"Kommissar X\" and \"Jerry Cotton\" series. France's Eddie Constantine Nick Carter and Lemmy Caution series moved into espionage with several films, including Jean-Luc Godard's \"Alphaville\" (1965).\n\nThe French Francis Coplan novels resulted in six films including \"Coplan Saves His Skin\" (1968). Jean Marais starred in the French-Italian \"The Reluctant Spy\" (1963) and \"Killer Spy\" (1965). Jean-Paul Belmondo was in the French spy spoof \"That Man From Rio\" (1964). American actor Ray Danton made two French films, \"\" (1965), \"Secret Agent Super Dragon\" (1966), and the Spanish-Italian 007 parody \"Lucky, el intrépido\" a.k.a. \"Lucky, the Inscrutable\" (1966) directed by Jesús Franco. Franco also made \"The Girl from Rio\" (1969) with \"Goldfinger\"'s Shirley Eaton in the title role.\n\nDino De Laurentiis's international co-production \"Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die\" (1966) was filmed in Rio de Janeiro using an American director and an Anglo-American cast (Mike Connors, Terry-Thomas, et al.) and a higher budget than most Eurospy films. A touchstone of this series of films was \"OK Connery\", a.k.a. \"Operation Kid Brother\" (1967) starring Neil Connery, brother of the then-James Bond actor Sean Connery, plus several actors from the official James Bond series. The director, Alberto De Martino, also made \"Special Mission Lady Chaplin\" (1966) and \"The Spy with Ten Faces\" (1966) with Karin Dor. She was the first German Bond girl, appearing in \"You Only Live Twice\" (1967).\nBritish actor Stewart Granger starred in \"Red Dragon\" (1965), \"Target for Killing\" (1966) with Adolfo Celi from \"Thunderball\", and \"Requiem for a Secret Agent\" (1966) in Italy along with Daniela Bianchi.

Connery\" (1967). Sergio Sollima, who directed \"Requiem for a Secret Agent\", also helmed two Bond-like films starring George Ardisson, \"\" (1965), and \"Agent 3S3, Massacre in the Sun\" (1966). Ardisson made a third Italian spy film, \"Operation Counter Spy\" (1965).\n\nMarilù Tolo was in seven Italian/French-Italian productions: \"Espionage in Lisbon\" (1965), \"Balearic Caper\" (1966), \"Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die\" (1966), \"Perry Grant, agente di ferro,\" a.k.a. \"The Big Blackout\" (1966), \"To Skin a Spy\" (1966), \"Judoka-Secret Agent\" (1966), and \"Casse-tête chinois pour le judoka\" (1967).

He starred in \"Danger Route\" (1967) and \"Deadlier Than the Male\" (1967), the latter with Sylva Koscina. She made two other British films, \"Agent 8 3/4\" a.k.a. \"Hot Enough for June\" (1964), that featured a mention of Agent 007 and \"Our Man in Marrakesh\" a.k.a. \"Bang! Bang! You're Dead!\" (1966) and two Italian productions, \"That Man in Istanbul\" (1965) and \"Agent X-77 Orders to Kill\" (1966).\n\nOther British-made films include \"Master Spy\" (1964), \"The Quiller Memorandum\" (1966), and \"Subterfuge\" (1968) starring Gene Barry. Michael Caine played the spy Harry Palmer in \"The Ipcress File\" (1965), and four sequels. The semi-parody \"Licensed to Kill\" a.k.a. \"The Second Best Secret Agent in the Whole Wide World\" (1965), directed by Lindsay Shonteff, featured Bond-like agent Charles Vine. This was followed by two sequels: \"Where the Bullets Fly\" (1966), directed by John Gilling, and an obscure Spanish production \"O.K. Yevtushenko\" a.k.a. \"Somebody's Stolen Our Russian Spy\" (1968). Shonteff went on to direct three more films with a similar spy named \"Charles Bind\": \"Number One of the Secret Service\" (1970), \"Licensed to Love and Kill\" a.k.a. \"The Man from S.E.X.\" (1979), and \"Number One Gun\" (1990).\n\nTwo French films starring Jean Dujardin, 2006's \"\" (set in 1955) and 2009's \"\" (set in 1967) both recreate the style of the period and parody the spy genre for a new audience.\n\nThe American Austin Powers series (1997–2002) of three comedies starring Mike Myers are set in the 1960s and 1970s. The trio parodies James Bond and other Eurospy films. Michael Caine, as a character similar to his Harry Palmer role (\"The Ipcress File\", et al.), plays Powers' father in the third film, \"Austin Powers in Goldmember\" (2002).\n\nThe Spanish film \"\"/\"Spy Time\" (2015) reimagines the 1964 comic hero for the screen.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "669899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=669899", "title": "Fair division", "text": "Fair division\n\nFair division is the problem of dividing a set of resources among several people who have an entitlement to them, such that each person receives his/her due share. This problem arises in various real-world settings, such as: division of inheritance, partnership dissolutions, divorce settlements, electronic frequency allocation, airport traffic management, and exploitation of Earth Observation Satellites. This is an active research area in Mathematics, Economics (especially Social choice theory), Game theory, Dispute resolution, and more. The central tenet of fair division is that such a division should be performed by the players themselves, maybe using a mediator but certainly not an arbiter as only the players really know how they value the goods.\n\nThe archetypal fair division algorithm is Divide and choose. It demonstrates that two agents with different tastes can divide a cake such that each of them believes that he got the best piece. The research in fair division can be seen as an extension of this procedure to various more complex settings.\n\nThere are many different kinds of fair division problems, depending on the nature of goods to divide, the criteria for fairness, the nature of the players and their preferences, and other criteria for evaluating the quality of the division.\n\nFormally, a fair division problem is defined by a set formula_1 and a group of formula_2 players. A division is a partition of formula_1 into formula_2 disjoint subsets: formula_5, one subset per player.\n\nThe set formula_1 can be of various types:\n\n\nAdditionally, the set to be divided may be:\n\n\nFinally, it is common to make some assumptions about whether the items to be divided are:\n\n\nBased on these distinctions, several general types of fair division problems have been studied:\n\n\nCombinations and special cases are also common:\n\n\nMost of what is normally called a fair division is not considered so by the theory because of the use of arbitration. This kind of situation happens quite often with mathematical theories named after real life problems. The decisions in the Talmud on entitlement when an estate is bankrupt reflect some quite complex ideas about fairness, and most people would consider them fair. However they are the result of legal debates by rabbis rather than divisions according to the valuations of the claimants.\n\nAccording to the Subjective theory of value, there cannot be an objective measure of the value of each item. Therefore, \"objective fairness\" is not possible, as different people may assign different values to each item. Empirical experiments on how people define the concept of fairness lead to inconclusive results.\n\nTherefore, most current research on fairness focuses on concepts of \"subjective fairness\". Each of the formula_2 people is assumed to have a personal, subjective \"utility function\" or \"value function\", formula_9, which assigns a numerical value to each subset of formula_1. Often the functions are assumed to be normalized, so that every person values the empty set as 0 (formula_11 for all i), and the entire set of items as 1 (formula_12 for all i) if the items are desirable, and -1 if the items are undesirable. Examples are:\n\n\nBased on these subjective value functions, there are a number of widely used criteria for a fair division. Some of these conflict with each other but often they can be combined. The criteria described here are only for when each player is entitled to the same amount:\n\n\nAll the above criteria assume that the participants have equal entitlements. If different participants have different entitlements (e.g., in a partnership where each partner invested a different amount), then the fairness criteria should be adapted accordingly. See Proportional cake-cutting with different entitlements.\n\nIn addition to fairness, it is sometimes desired that the division be Pareto optimal, i.e., no other allocation would make someone better off without making someone else worse off. The term efficiency comes from the economics idea of the efficient market. A division where one player gets everything is optimal by this definition so on its own this does not guarantee even a fair share. See also efficient cake-cutting and the price of fairness.\n\nIn the real world people sometimes have a very accurate idea of how the other players value the goods and they may care very much about it. The case where they have complete knowledge of each other's valuations can be modeled by game theory. Partial knowledge is very hard to model. A major part of the practical side of fair division is the devising and study of procedures that work well despite such partial knowledge or small mistakes.\n\nAn additional requirement is that the fair division procedure be a truthful mechanism, i.e., it should be a dominant strategy for the participants to report their true valuations. This requirement is usually very hard to satisfy in combination with fairness and Pareto-efficiency. \n\nA generalization of the problem is to allow each interested party to consist of several players who share the same set of resources but have different preferences.\n\nA fair division procedure lists actions to be performed by the players in terms of the visible data and their valuations. A valid procedure is one that guarantees a fair division for every player who acts rationally according to their valuation. Where an action depends on a player's valuation the procedure is describing the strategy a rational player will follow. A player may act as if a piece had a different value but must be consistent. For instance if a procedure says the first player cuts the cake in two equal parts then the second player chooses a piece, then the first player cannot claim that the second player got more.\n\nWhat the players do is:\n\n\nIt is assumed the aim of each player is to maximize the minimum amount they might get, or in other words, to achieve the maximin.\n\nProcedures can be divided into \"discrete\" vs. \"continuous\" procedures. A discrete procedure would for instance only involve one person at a time cutting or marking a cake. Continuous procedures involve things like one player moving a knife and the other saying \"stop\". Another type of continuous procedure involves a person assigning a value to every part of the cake.\n\nFor a list of fair division procedures, see .\n\nAccording to Sol Garfunkel, the cake-cutting problem had been one of the most important open problems in 20th century mathematics, when the most important variant of the problem was finally solved with the Brams-Taylor procedure by Steven Brams and Alan Taylor in 1995.\n\nDivide and choose's origins are undocumented. The related activities of bargaining and barter are also ancient. Negotiations involving more than two people are also quite common, the Potsdam Conference is a notable recent example.\n\nThe theory of fair division dates back only to the end of the second world war. It was devised by a group of Polish mathematicians, Hugo Steinhaus, Bronisław Knaster and Stefan Banach, who used to meet in the Scottish Café in Lvov (then in Poland). A proportional (fair division) division for any number of players called 'last-diminisher' was devised in 1944. This was attributed to Banach and Knaster by Steinhaus when he made the problem public for the first time at a meeting of the Econometric Society in Washington D.C. on 17 September 1947. At that meeting he also proposed the problem of finding the smallest number of cuts necessary for such divisions.\n\nFor the history of envy-free cake-cutting, see \nenvy-free cake-cutting.\n\n\n\n"}

During the immediate post WWII period, while the GDR was still working to establish legitimacy, direct censorship was not a viable option. The GDR worked hard to separate its own ideal from American and Western Ideals, which they viewed as a threat to the Communist ideals During the early years of the Republic, between the 1950s and 1970s the East German government employed what they called \"Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft\", (FSK) which roughly translates to the Voluntary Self-Regulatory Body of the Film Industry. Though the name would suggest the organization was made up of volunteers, the actual members of the organization were appointed by the GDR government. Many of these members worked in the film industry prior to the split of East and West Germany. These members were tasked with screening each film before it was released to the public. This organization censored numerous American and Western films claiming them to be unfit for public viewing. Although approval of the FSK was not supposed to be explicitly required, many theaters in the GDR refused to show films that were not on the FSK approved list. The inner workings of the FSK were kept mostly secret from German citizens. The GDR's government did not want the average citizen to know they were being censored, in an effort to distance itself from its recent fascist past.\n\nGermans in the pre WWII period were avid cinema goers. Over a billion cinema tickets were sold in 1943 alone in Germany. After Germany’s surrender during the second world war, German citizens continued to flock to cinemas in large numbers; cinemas re opened even before Germany officially surrendered. Before the official split of East and West Germany, Allied films were shown. As the rift between East and West became deeper and deeper, fewer Allied films were shown and were replaced with Soviet films. German citizens became well acquainted with Soviet accomplishments and the pitfalls of fascism. As the Soviets began to withdraw, the East German Government re-vamped an old Nazi era film production company. They centralized all the former Germany film production companies in and around Berlin into one monopolized film company, DEFA. This company held a monopoly on every stage of film production in the GDR and was responsible for all film production released to the public.\n"}
{"id": "27350188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27350188", "title": "Geoff Peterson", "text": "Geoff Peterson\n\nGeoff Peterson was an animatronic human skeleton that served as the sidekick on the late-night talk show \"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\". He was voiced and operated by Josh Robert Thompson and first appeared on \"The Late Late Show\" on April 5, 2010. Often referred to as a \"robot skeleton\", Peterson is a radio-controlled animatronic robot puppet designed and built by Grant Imahara of \"MythBusters\". He has glowing blue eyes, a metal mohawk (which is sometimes covered by a Santa Claus hat in December) and wears an oversized suit with his name scrawled on a contestant's name tag from \"The Price Is Right\" on his jacket, as well as Mardi Gras beads and a Super Bowl XLVII press pass around his neck. He serves as a co-host of sorts and Ferguson refers to him as \"my gay robot pal\". He was most visible during the first half of the show (the cold openings, monologues, and Tweets and Emails segments) and the final segment, \"What Did We Learn on the Show Tonight, Craig?\".\n\nAccording to a Tweet from Imahara dated on December 23, 2016, Ferguson took the robot home as a souvenir after his run on \"The Late Late Show\" ended.\n\nThe idea came from Craig Ferguson's repeated complaints that his show suffered due to its lack of a house band or sidekick and his expressed desire to have his own \"Robot Skeleton Army\". Robot Skeleton Army is Ferguson's name for his Twitter followers, a reference to the cybernetic creatures from the \"Terminator\" franchise. \"MythBusters\" Grant Imahara volunteered to create the robot if Ferguson could get him 100,000 Twitter followers, which he achieved within 24 hours. On the idea and development of Geoff:\n\nAccording to Imahara, he worked on it weekends and in his spare time, creating a \"plastic skeleton with aluminum bones and torso\" that \"shares a lot with R2-D2 and the Energizer Bunny\" (both of which Imahara had previously worked on). Ferguson was directly involved and \"very into the design of it\"; he and the show's writers \"think they may want to send Geoff out into the world, interview people—things like that\". Imahara says the name \"Geoff Peterson\" was chosen by Ferguson:\n\nInitially, the robot was able to say seven pre-recorded phrases, triggered by buttons under Craig's desk. This was later upgraded to wireless control by one of the show's writers offstage using an iPad. Peterson was upgraded again in July 2010, allowing him to shake his head, keep his mouth open, and move his right hand up and down. Ferguson noted that this is because his \"wise ass\" chip was activated. On September 2, 2013, new upgrades were debuted as the right arm now has an elbow and the previously motionless left arm now has full movement as well, although his left hand fell off during that night's episode. He can also now turn his eye lights off and on to simulate closing and opening his eyes.\n\nPeterson made occasional comments throughout the show and helped with the Twitter and email segment of the show. His comments where broad and often said as a segue to another joke or to make fun of something else, including Peterson himself, or as humorous non sequiturs. He was featured in numerous videos of \"Tweets and E-mails\" jingles. The first three were a parody of a Bollywood Filmi musical performance, a parody of an 80's glam metal performance, and a Rick James parody. Terminator-esque robot skeletons, which pre-date Peterson, appeared in jingles that parody the musical performances of artists such as Kraftwerk, David Bowie, Bob Dylan, Gary Glitter, and Johnny Cash. Peterson didn't interact with the guests unless \"they want to play around with him.\"\n\nFor Peterson's first anniversary, \"The Late Late Show\" filmed a sketch in Las Vegas that aired on the April 14, 2011 show. The segment depicted Ferguson, Peterson, and T.J. the Leprechaun partaking of \"hallucinogenic frozen custard\" with comedian Carrot Top and their subsequent gallivanting around Vegas. The sketch also featured appearances by Grant Imahara, Donny Osmond, Secretariat (the show's pantomime horse, voiced by Josh Thompson impersonating Morgan Freeman), and Wavy and Sid (Ferguson's alligator and rabbit puppets), which culminated in Ferguson and Peterson marrying one another at a typical Vegas chapel. For the episode, Peterson's voice was performed live for the first time by Thompson.\n\nPeterson's backstory was depicted during an episode which originally aired on January 3, 2012, opening with a skit purporting to be from Ferguson's first episode.\n\nAlthough generally amicable and friendly, Peterson could be defensive and easily angered if provoked by Ferguson or a guest, usually exclaiming \"What the Hell man?!\" if he was called out for his behavior or comments. A running gag on the show involved Craig making fun of how Geoff can only move one arm, and is unable to walk away from his podium, although he is somehow able to play an invisible harmonica. Geoff can now move both arms. On numerous occasions he taunted Geoff's requests, questions, and comments with his various inabilities, (e.g. when Geoff complained about how Craig got to be the host and do most of the talking while he stood at the lectern, Craig retorted by saying Geoff could take his place as host \"the day [he] was able to walk over [to his desk]\"). Geoff's cause of death varies from a skydiving accident, a bar fight with Wilford Brimley, being massively overweight, choking on a bird's foot, and a methamphetamine overdose. He is extremely rich and owns houses and laundromats all over the country.\n\nGeoff has a mock feud with frequent guest Kristen Bell, who claims that she had wanted to be Craig's sidekick and was upset when Geoff was selected. Geoff typically gives her a lukewarm, sometimes nasty greeting, and she feels very uncomfortable around him. As of August 2011, Geoff and Kristen had supposedly reconciled while in Paris shooting \"Le Late Late Show avec Craig Ferguson à Paris\". Josh Robert Thompson referred to Geoff as a homosexual skeleton robot during a live stand-up routine, opening for Craig Ferguson in Hershey, PA on October 9, 2012.\n\nPeterson's voice was originally performed by Ferguson in a loud, monotone, English accent; but this was soon changed. Starting on April 20, 2010, Josh Robert Thompson voiced Geoff Peterson using prerecorded clips of a vaguely George Takei sounding voice. From April 14, 2011 on, Thompson began to occasionally voice and perform Geoff live in-studio, and on May 16, 2011, in a possible backdoor audition, Thompson performed Geoff in an actual guest spot. From June 29, 2011 onward, Thompson voiced and performed Geoff in-person for virtually every episode, including those filmed in Paris, France and Scotland. In April 2012, shortly after the news that Ferguson would continue his show until at least 2014, Ferguson told one interviewer that as far as he was concerned, Thompson \"has a home\" portraying Peterson for \"as long as he wants to do it\".\n\nThompson described Peterson's voice as \"one part Snagglepuss, one part Vincent Price, two parts George Takei\". Thompson says his live segments are \"100% unscripted and improvised\". Since Thompson began voicing Geoff Peterson live, he has incorporated several of his own impressions into the character's repertoire. He also performed his Morgan Freeman impression for Freeman himself on June 10, 2011, asking the amazed actor \"Would you like to hear my Morgan Freeman voice?\" and \"What would you like to say to yourself?\". Freeman called the impression \"outstanding\".\n\nWhen Thompson was unavailable for two weeks starting with the November 7, 2011 show, Peterson was voiced by several celebrities: Alfred Molina, Dominic Monaghan, Thomas Lennon, Larry King, Louie Anderson, Lauren Graham, Paula Poundstone, Angela Kinsey, Jason Schwartzman, and Shadoe Stevens each for a single episode. During Thompson's absence in November 2011 and on December 19 for Christmas week, Thomas Lennon again provided the voice of Peterson, in an alternate persona for Peterson known as Khloe Banderas.\n\nDorsey Shaw of \"New York\" magazine's Vulture blog described Peterson as \"the \"de facto\" animatronic 'King of the One-Liners' for this generation\". Jaime Weinman of \"Maclean's\" said: \"I think my favorite part of that is just the decision to give this mohawked skeleton robot a name as prosaically normal as Geoff Peterson.\" Tom Jicha of \"Sun-Sentinel\" said that \"some nights he's ridiculous, verbally jousting with the robot he [Ferguson] created and named, Geoff Peterson\". Linda Holmes of NPR's Monkey See blog listed Peterson on her list of \"50 Wonderful Things From 2010\", writing: \"Ferguson continues to be wonderful at what he does, and this was a marvelous marriage of the sensibility of his show with the sensibility of \"Mythbusters\".\" \"TV Guide\" ranked Peterson as one of their favorite robots in film and television.\n\nGuests have often praised the chemistry between Ferguson and Peterson during their interviews on \"The Late Late Show\". Regis Philbin said \"Y'know the robot? I've actually in love. I wasn't sure of the robot but he's grown on me. I think it's a great combination. You [Ferguson] say something funny, you turn around and look at him, and he [Peterson] says something funnier!\"\n\n\nNotes\n"}

He was often asked to help police detectives trace missing persons, though authenticated successes were few, and compared against the failures, his success rate was ruled no better than chance.\n\nCroiset was born in Laren, North Holland, in 1909. He said he began to become aware of his gifts while a youth working for a watch repairer, and that on one occasion he held a ruler belonging to his employer and saw events which he related to his employer and which his employer confirmed were accurate.\n\nAfter World War II, Croiset was sometimes consulted by Dutch police authorities for cases involving missing persons, or murder. On one occasion he was said to have examined the property of a murdered woman, and provided accurate information relating to her murder, and also gave the name of her murderer. The name matched a man who was being held in connection with the crime. He gained a reputation as a reliable consultant in the area of missing persons, and his fame extended beyond the Netherlands, as anecdotes about his abilities came to be discussed in other countries. He also gained a reputation as a psychic healer, and would allow people to visit him in his clinic for healing sessions.\n\nIn 1966, he was invited to Australia to aid in an investigation relating to the disappearance of the three Beaumont children, who had disappeared without trace from a beach in Adelaide, South Australia. Although police were skeptical, his expenses were paid by the wealthy property tycoon Con Polites who was interested in the case, and publicity was such that Croiset's ideas were thought to be worthy of consideration. During his brief stay in Australia he attracted widespread publicity but failed to find any trace of the missing children.\n\nIn January 1970, Croiset assisted in the investigation of the kidnapping of Muriel McKay in England. Mrs McKay was the wife of publishing tycoon Rupert Murdoch's Deputy Chairman Alick McKay. Croiset was asked by a McKay family friend, Eric Cutler, to help locate her. Croiset said that she was in a white farmhouse in the north or north east of London and that nearby to her was another farm and an abandoned aerodrome and that if she was not found within 14 days she would be dead. Her body was never found. Brothers Arthur and Nazimoodeen Hosein were convicted of her murder—the first case in British history for a murder conviction without a body.\n\nDuring the mid 1970s, he was invited to Puerto Rico to find the two missing children of a local businessman. He concluded that the children were no longer on an \"earthly plane\" and could offer no clues. Also, he was asked to locate a missing woman in Scotland, and once again failed to provide any clues.\n\nCroiset's reputation became tarnished during his later years by his well publicised failures. However, he claimed to have achieved one more notable success when he was invited to Tokyo, Japan during the 1970s to locate a missing child. As he claimed, he had provided a description of the location in which her body could be found within 24 hours. When her body was found after following his instructions, all details seemed to match exactly with his prediction. There are no known independent sources for this claim.\n\nIn 1973, two little children were kidnapped by their father in Haute-Savoie (France). In 1976, Gérard Croiset declared briefly by phone: \"They are in Italy\". But the father doesn’t speak Italian, observed the mother. During a second phone call, Croiset’s secretary said that he couldn’t do anything more in this case. After having lived with his girls in Spain and Germany, the father was arrested in France in 1979. Some time later, the children told of their visit to friends in Italy just at that time when their mother telephoned with Gérard Croiset.\n\nIn another apparently successful case during May 1976, Croiset was flown from the Netherlands to Japan by a Japanese television station to see if he could help locate a missing seven-year-old girl. After being shown a picture of the missing girl, Miwa Kikuchi, Croiset stated that she was dead “on the surface of a lake near her home and near a quay for boats near a yellow protruding structure”. The girl’s body was later recovered floating in the reservoir near a quay for rowing boats and a water supply tower, which was painted yellow. Although the press were astounded at Croiset’s paranormal abilities, some policemen stated that they would have found the girl’s body without Croiset’s help.\n\nHe died in Utrecht in 1980, aged 71.\n\nCroiset claimed he helped to solve the case of an assault of a girl in Wierden, the Netherlands. The Chief of Police of Wierden stated however, that the information by Croiset was inaccurate and his communications were not used in the case. He was investigated under controlled conditions by The Belgian Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Phenomena Reputed to be Paranormal and they did not find any evidence of psychic ability.\n\nThe skeptic James Lett has written:\n\nThe Dutch parapsychologist Wilhelm Tenhaeff has written Croiset had genuine psychic powers due to the information he had given in police cases. However it was discovered that much of Tenhaeff’s data was fraudulent.\n\n\n"}

The most recent ILA Berlin Air Show was held in April 2018.\n\nEstablished in 1909, it claims to be world's oldest air show, and it is among the largest and most important aerospace trade fairs today. According to the organisers Messe Berlin GmbH, in 2012 the Berlin Air Show attracted 125,000 professional visitors and 105,000 members of the general public, with 3,600 journalists from 65 countries also attending.\n\nThe format is similar to the Paris Air Show in France and the Farnborough International Airshow in Britain, the other major events in the European air show calendar. The Berlin event starts with three professional days closed to the general public, and then on Friday, Saturday and Sunday the public are allowed in.\n\nThe main display sections planned for 2014 include commercial air transport, space, military aviation, helicopters and both civil and military unmanned aircraft systems, also known as UAVs.\n\nIt was first held in Frankfurt am Main in 1909, and as such can lay claim to being the oldest aviation show in the world. After the first ILA, following the idea of the aircraft constructor August Euler, numerous flying clubs combined to form the German Pilots' Association in April 1910. Shortly after, the Association of German Aircraft Makers was founded in Frankfurt/Main, establishing close ties between the ILA and the future Federal Association of the Aerospace Industry (BDLI), an organisation that exists today.\n\nBefore the First World War, the ILA was held in Berlin (1912 and later on in 1928). When Germany regained air sovereignty after the Second World War, the foundations were laid in 1955 for an \"International Show for Travel by Air\", which in 1957 took place at Langenhagen Airport as part of the Hanover Trade Fair, the first in a run of ILA shows in Hanover that was to last over 30 years.\n\nKnown initially as the \"German Aviation Show\", the fair was increasingly attracting participants from abroad, and in 1978 the symbolic three letters ILA from 1909 were revived. In 1992, the far-reaching political and economic changes which had taken place in Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall opened the way for the ILA to return to its birthplace in Berlin. The ILA’s main display sections include commercial aviation, aerospace, military aviation and military technology, equipment and engines, and general aviation and helicopters.\nThe new multi-purpose exhibition area, called Berlin ExpoCenter Airport adjacent to the BER was finished in time for ILA 2012. The main section of the grounds cover approximately 250,000 square metres.\n\nThe site is situated southeast of Germany's capital city Berlin.\n\nAll previous attendance records had been broken at ILA2006. More than 250,000 visitors (2004: 201,500, +25%) were recorded at the ILA2006 between 16 and 21 May, including 115,000 trade visitors (2004: 105,000). Events on the southern section of Berlin-Schönefeld airport were dominated by the signing of sales contracts and joint venture agreements worth billions, a display featuring some 340 aircraft, many of them making their first public appearance, and the largest number of delegations and conferences ever. 1,014 exhibitors from 42 countries (2004: 987 from 42 countries) presented products, systems and processes from every area of the aerospace industry. Several thousand experts from all over Europe and from overseas attended the more than 90 accompanying conferences in search of information. Some 4,100 media representatives from 70 countries provided comprehensive coverage of the main technical themes and the attractions for the public at the ILA2006.\n\nILA 2006 emphasised the importance of this sector for Germany in its role as a centre for the aerospace industry. Hans-Joachim Gante, Chief Executive of the BDLI, stated: \"We have become one of the few sectors with sustainable growth in Germany, due above all to our innovative strengths.\" This was clearly demonstrated at the ILA2006, which is acquiring an increasingly international dimension, thereby strengthening its role as one of the world’s major meeting places for the industry. This was an ideal opportunity for the German aerospace industry to demonstrate that it is among the world leaders.\" Exhibitors expressed their satisfaction with the discussions and contacts and with the business deals that were finalised at this event. \"In particular the decision to make Russia the partner country proved highly effective. Russia was very strongly represented and was able to establish numerous contacts and business links.\"\n\nAt the close of the event Stefan Grave, Project Director for Messe Berlin GmbH, summed up: \"The ILA2006 underlined its major importance as a European marketing platform for this sector as well as again demonstrating its many attractions for the public. Trade visitors and the general public alike were fascinated by the high-tech products on display. Unprecedented numbers of people attended to see the Airbus A380, an outstanding international flying display and the Space Hall.\n\nMany high-ranking delegations attended, especially during the three Trade Visitors’ Days. In addition to the Federal Minister of Economics Michael Glos, the ILA 2006 also received visits from the Defence Minister Franz-Josef Jung, Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble, Transport Minister Wolfgang Tiefensee, the Minister at the Chancellor’s Office Dr. Thomas de Maizière and the heads of the regional governments in Brandenburg and Berlin, Matthias Platzeck and Klaus Wowereit. Germany’s armed forces, the Bundeswehr, were very strongly represented: the Chief of the Armed Forces Wolfgang Schneiderhan attended the ILA 2006, as did the Chiefs of Staff of the Air Force and Army, Klaus-Peter Stieglitz and Hans-Otto Budde. A number of ministers from other countries also visited this event, accompanied by high-ranking delegations, thereby underlining the international importance of the ILA 2006. Among them were, from the partner country Russia, the Minister of Disaster Relief Sergei Schoigu, the Minister of Defence of the Netherlands, Henk Kamp, the Greek Defence Minister Evangelos Meimarakis, the French Transport Minister Dominique Perben, the Slovenian Defence Minister Karl Erjavec, the Albanian Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu and the Ukrainian Industry Minister Volodymyr Shandra. In addition 70 parliamentarians from 17 European countries were welcomed at the ILA2006.\n\nThe ILA2006 was organised jointly by the association representing the German aerospace industry, Bundesverband der Deutschen Luft- und Raumfahrtindustrie (BDLI) e.V., Berlin, and by Messe Berlin GmbH.\n\nILA 2008 was held between 27 May and 1 June 2008 on the southern section of Berlin-Schönefeld Airport, which has been designated as the future Berlin Brandenburg International Airport (BBI). Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel attended the opening ceremony and welcomed international guests, among which a special place was dedicated to Indian operators, as India was chosen as 2008 edition's partner country. Special events were planned as part of 60th Anniversary of the Berlin Airlift celebration. UK and US veterans from the cold war age Berlin airlift were invited as ILA's special guests.\nOther guests were the US Air Force with a B-1B Lancer, the Poland Air Force and the Slovak Air Force with MiG-29 Fulcrum, Airbus with the A380 and the Patrouille Suisse.\n\nAt ILA Berlin Air Show 2010 1,153 exhibitors from 47 countries presented their products and services to 235,000 visitors, of whom 125,000 were trade visitors. Around 300 aircraft were on display at the trade show. During the ILA 2010, Airbus alone received orders worth 15,3 billion US-Dollars, among them the then-biggest order in civil aviation history on 32 additional Airbus A380 by Emirates.\n\nThe ILA Berlin Air Show in 2012 was held at an exhibition ground next to the newly built Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER) in Schönefeld, Germany. Poland was chosen as 2012's partner country of the ILA Berlin Air Show.\n\n\n"}

The newspaper is a member of the European Association of Daily Newspapers in Minority and Regional Languages (MIDAS). According to TNS Gallup media research, \"Kurier Wileński\" 36,800 people or 1.4% of Lithuania's population read at least one issue out of the last six in summer 2008, but that measure dropped to 0.3% in spring 2010.\n\nThe newspaper was first founded under the name of \"Kurier Litewski\" in 1796 in Grodno (modern Hrodna). The following year it moved to Vilna (modern Vilnius, Lithuania), where it became one of the principal sources of information for the local population. After the November Uprising of 1831, the newspaper was ordered to prepare a Russian language version as well, and served the role of the official newspaper of the Russian authorities of Vilna Governorate. However, it also fulfilled an important role in countering the Russification of local Poles. \n\nIn 1840 the newspaper was renamed to \"Kurier Wileński\" and attracted many notable Polish writers and journalists of the era as one of the very few relatively free newspapers in the lands ruled by the Russian Empire. Among them was Władysław Syrokomla and Antoni Odyniec. The newspaper was closed down and banned after the failed January Uprising of 1863. \n\nIt was relaunched under the title of \"Kurier Litewski\" after the Revolution of 1905. Headed by Eliza Orzeszkowa, it promoted Polish literature and culture, for which it was closed down several times by the Tsarist authorities. The title remained until the outbreak of World War I and the German occupation of Vilna in 1915. \n\nDuring the interbellum the Polish press was no longer persecuted by the local authorities and the title was continued as one of several newspapers, the most important local newspapers being \"Słowo\" (headed by Stanisław Cat Mackiewicz), \"Robotnik Wileński\" and \"Express Wileński\". Altogether, there were 114 newspapers published in Wilno in late 1930s, among them 17 dailies. 74 titles were being published in the Polish language, 16 in Yiddish and Hebrew, 12 in Belarusian, 9 in Lithuanian and 3 in Russian. \n\nAfter the Invasion of Poland of 1939 and the Soviet annexation of Vilna, \"Kurier Wileński\" was closed down (the last issue was dated September 18, 1939). The only newspaper that was allowed by the Soviet authorities was Belarusian-language \"Vilenskaya Prauda (Віленская праўда)\". After the city was transferred to Lithuania, \"Kurier Wileński\" was allowed to be published, this time under heavy control of the Lithuanian authorities and censorship. It was again closed down after the city was annexed by the Soviet Union and its role was taken over by roughly 73 underground newspapers published in the city during the rest of World War II.\n\nAfter the war most of the local inhabitants of Vilnius were expelled from the city. However, a sizeable Polish minority in Lithuania remained. The Polish language newspaper \"Czerwony Sztandar\" (\"Red Banner\"), edited by Antoni Fiedorowicz, was established.\n\nIn 1962, Leonid Romanowicz became the new editor in chief. Although Russian himself, Romanowicz was fascinated by the Polish culture and started to attract many notable journalists and writers. He also promoted the newspaper and it became the only daily newspaper in Polish language available to many Poles in the Soviet Union. With time Russian staff was replaced by Poles and in 1984 Stanisław Jakutis became the new editor in chief.\n\nOn November 1, 1988, Stanisław Jakutis was replaced by Zbigniew Balcewicz, who wanted to rename the newspaper back to \"Kurier Wileński\" to reflect the historic traditions. The first attempt to rename the daily was dismissed at the 20th Assembly of the Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Lithuania as a \"newspaper with such name was being published during the period between World Wars, when Vilnius region was under Polish occupation\". Only after second attempt, made after publication by Lithuanian scientist about the roots of \"Kurier Wileński\" and the history of Lithuanian press, \"Czerwony Sztandar\" ceased to exist and was replaced by \"Kurier Wileński\" on February 9, 1990.\n\nOn February 23, 1990, the Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Lithuania and Chair of the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR issued a statement, of which 3rd point stated, that \"In order to reflect the opinions of representatives of various nationalities and social classes of the Republic, we state that \"Sovietskaya Litva\" and \"Kurier Wileński\" are the newspapers of the Supreme Soviet of Lithuania and the Council of Ministers of Lithuania\". On May 2, special issue of the newspaper was issued and \"Dziennik KC KP Litwy\" (\"The daily of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Lithuania\") was removed from the paper's front page.\n\nIn 1995, the newspaper was privatised by its staff and in upcoming turmoil almost went bankrupt. It was taken over by UAB \"Klion\", and, after being reorganised and modernised, was moved to the new quarters. In 2000 it was passed to non-profit publisher Vilnijos Žodis.\n\nThe newspaper does not financially sustain itself and relies on support from the Polish Senate. According to press reports in 2007, the daily received approximately 120,000 litas annually to cover paper and printing costs from the Polish Senate and 4,000 litas monthly from Vilnius city municipality for advertising. In 2011, the daily suffered large financial losses due to increased postage costs, shrinking readership, and overall economic downturn. It considered publishing only three issues a week, but Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs promised to find enough funding to keep the newspaper on a daily schedule. The Polish support during the first ten months amounted to 328,000 Polish zloty.\n\n\"Kurier Wileński\" has its own printing shop, which proved to be more cost effective. Its current circulation is between 2,500 and 3,500, issued Tuesday through Saturday. Daily issues have 16 pages, while Saturday issues have 24 pages and a TV supplement. \"Gazeta Harcerska\" (\"Scout's gazette\") is a weekly page about Polish scouts is written exclusively by the scouts.\n\nThe staff consists of 24 people, including printing-shop's workers and management. There are four full-time journalists, four half-time journalists and seven freelancers.\n\nDuring the Perestroika and the dissolution of the USSR, \"Czerwony Sztandar\" and later \"Kurier Wileński\" led numerous social campaigns. Among them were campaigns against demolition of the Rasos Cemetery and for creation of Polish kindergartens to prevent the growing Lithuanization of Polish children. \n\n\"Kurier Wileński\" is also, along with \"Gazeta Wyborcza\", responsible for media coverage of the festival Kaziuki Wilniuki (inspired by Kaziuko mugė in Vilnius) held annually on March 3 to 6 in Lidzbark Warmiński.\n\nOn August 5, 2005, journalists of \"Kurier Wileński\", together with colleagues from newspapers \"Tygodnik Wileńszczyzny\" and \"Magazyn Wileński\", radio station Znad Wilii, quarterly \"Znad Wilii\" and TV program \"Album Wileńskie\" organised a protest in front of the Belarusian embassy in Vilnius against repressions of Polish journalists in Belarus.\n\nOn October 17, 2008, the daily switched to the F4 format (before that \"Kurier Wileński\" was published in the tabloid format).\n\nMuch of controversy surrounds the daily regarding its financial status and takeover by UAB \"Klion\". Also, there are conflicts with Lithuanian nationalists who regard Lithuanian Poles as merely polonised Lithuanians.\n\nIn November 2006, \"Kurier Wileński\" published an article by Krzysztof Buchowski, Polish historian from the Białystok University, about Polish and Lithuanian relations between the world wars (). It was a reprint of a thesis presented during a Polish–Lithuanian historical conference () at Vilnius University.\n\nIn January 2007 (before municipal elections, in which Polish party also participated), Lithuanian TV program \"Savaitės komentarai\" on the TV3 station sparked a scandal claiming that the article was insulting the Lithuanians. Information about the article was passed on to the Lithuanian Ethics Committee of Journalists and Publishers (), which decided on March 19, 2007, that \"Kurier Wileński\" acted unethically publishing an article that was derogatory and insulting to the Lithuanians. The daily lost the appeal with the Committee and sued in the Lithuanian courts. The court rejected the appeal in April 2011. \"Kurier Wileński\" then submitted the case to the European Court of Human Rights.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "54394274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54394274", "title": "List of GLOW characters", "text": "List of GLOW characters\n\nGLOW is an American television series created by Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch, based on the women's wrestling promotion Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (GLOW). The following is a list of characters from the series.\n\nRuth Wilder (Alison Brie) is an actress struggling to land a role on film and television. Originally from Omaha, Nebraska, and having studied the works of August Strindberg, Ruth relies heavily on method acting. One day, she is given an invitation for an audition which turns out to be for the fledgling women's wrestling promotion Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (GLOW). Ruth initially has personality conflicts with director Sam Sylvia due to her tendency to overact in the ring. Aside from her acting style, Sam often questions her looks, unsure whether or not he finds her attractive. Making matters worse is her affair with Mark Eagan, the husband of her best friend Debbie. Because of this, she is known by the other women as a \"homewrecker\". After several weeks of struggling to come up with a character, she creates the in-ring persona of Zoya the Destroya, a Soviet heel based on the real GLOW wrestler Colonel Ninotchka.\n\nIn Season 2, Ruth directs the show's opening sequence without Sam's approval, resulting in tensions between the both of them. She also develops a relationship with new cameraman Russell Barroso. While Ruth settles her differences with Sam, she falls victim to a drunk and cocaine-induced Debbie, who breaks her ankle during their match. The injury sidelines her for eight weeks, resulting in a heated argument between her and Debbie over past issues with each other. After the duo reconcile with each other, Ruth continues to provide story ideas for the show and also portrays a non wrestling character, Olga, twin sister of her Zoya character in numerous skits. Sam rewards her by having her win the GLOW Crown in the show's final episode.\n\nDebbie Eagan (Betty Gilpin) is a former actress and Ruth's best friend. She is best known for her role as Laura Morgan in the soap opera \"Paradise Cove\" until she was fired due to her pregnancy. Her friendship with Ruth is severely strained when she discovers that Ruth had an affair with her husband Mark during and after her pregnancy, sparking a cat fight during practice that inspires Sam to cast Debbie as GLOW's leading lady. While trying to convince her to join GLOW, Sam theorizes that despite her popularity in \"Paradise Cove\", she was being held back by the show's writers and her character was put in a coma for a whole season as punishment for improvising too many lines before she was eventually replaced by another actress. Originally oblivious to the professional wrestling business, Debbie's mindset changes when she watches a local wrestling show and sees its similarities to soap opera before having a one-night-stand with male wrestler Steel Horse. She later on realizes that wrestling is a liberating experience, as her body is not constrained by Mark or her son Randy in the ring. Debbie's in-ring persona is Liberty Belle, a patriotic Southern belle based on the real GLOW wrestlers Americana and The Southern Belles: Scarlet and Tara.\n\nIn Season 2, Debbie divorces Mark after realizing he never took her acting career seriously. When the ladies are given new contracts by K-DTV, Debbie and Mark have her contract amended to make her a producer of the show. Her new position puts a strain on her already fragile friendship with Ruth, especially when she prevents Ruth from going out on a date with cameraman Russell Barroso by making her work overtime to finish editing the show's material. After Debbie discovers that Mark is seeing someone, she finds cocaine stashed in a pack of Sam's cigarettes and snorts it, causing her to become aggressive during the main event and break Ruth's ankle.\n\nCherry Bang (Sydelle Noel) is a former stuntwoman who becomes GLOW's head trainer. She previously worked in Sam's exploitation films in the 1970s and had a threesome with him and her husband. Prior to GLOW, Cherry had not worked with Sam since 1978 and she had been out of work since 1979, as the blaxploitation subgenre went on a decline toward the 1980s. She also suffered a miscarriage two years before joining GLOW. Cherry's in-ring persona is Junkchain, a female rapper.\n\nIn Season 2, Cherry quits GLOW for a starring role in K-DTV's new female detective series \"Chambers and Gold\", but she struggles with remembering her lines in front of the camera. This results in director Rick Hollander cutting her lines and forcing her to change her hair. After analyzing footage of the pilot episode, Sam deduces that Cherry's background in stunt work never prepared her for acting, and he talks K-DTV producer Glen Klitnick to release her from the show so she can return to GLOW. After losing her Junkchain gimmick to Yolanda Rivas in her return match, Cherry reinvents herself as Black Magic, a voodoo practitioner loosely based on the real GLOW wrestler Big Bad Mama.\n\nCarmen Wade (Britney Young) is a 25-year-old woman who is part of a professional wrestling family. Her father, legendary wrestler Goliath Jackson, disapproves of her desire to become a wrestler, as he sees women's wrestling as a cheap sideshow. While she has wrestling skills and helps Cherry train the other ladies, Carmen suffers from stage fright. Carmen's in-ring persona is Machu Picchu, a gentle Peruvian giant loosely based on the real GLOW wrestler Mount Fiji.\n\nSam Francis Sylvia (Marc Maron) is a Sicilian American exploitation film director hired to direct GLOW. He had directed eight films in the 1970s and claims that two of them are taught in colleges. In addition, his film \"Gina the Machina\" was deemed so controversial that it was banned in 49 states. Sam has a chronic drug and alcohol addiction that has led to one divorce and multiple affairs with other women; his habits continue in GLOW when he has an affair with wrestler Rhonda Richardson. He often has conflicts with GLOW's producer Sebastian \"Bash\" Howard over the creative direction of the promotion, with Sam going for a dystopian sci-fi theme and Bash incorporating colorful stereotypes. Sam is loosely based on Matt Cimber, the director of the original GLOW series.\n\nIn Season 2, Sam goes paranoid over his role as director when he learns that Bash talked K-DTV out of replacing him with another director named Rick Hollander. This is exacerbated when he discovers that Ruth directed the show's main title sequence without his approval. After firing Reggie Walsh for defending Ruth, Sam punishes Ruth by keeping her off the next episode's taping. He subsequently settles his difference with Ruth, admitting to his insecurity.\n\nJustine Victoria Biagi (Britt Baron) is a 17-year-old punk rock girl who uses the in-ring name Scab. On the first day of auditions, she claims to be 19 years old. She is a fan of Sam's exploitation films and has a romantic relationship with pizza boy Billy Offal. Later in the series, Justine reveals herself to be Sam's illegitimate daughter, as he had a one-night-stand with her mother Rosalie after being kicked out of a Black Panther Party rally in Sacramento nearly two decades ago. Her sole purpose of joining GLOW was to meet him.\n\nIn Season 2, Justine no longer participates in GLOW as a wrestler; instead, she plays small parts in the show as a teenage girl named Lisa. She also goes back to school at the insistence of Sam. One day, Rosalie spots her on an episode of the show and storms in Sam's house to bring her back to Sacramento. After being allowed to attend the school dance, Justine is talked out of moving out to New York with Billy and decides to go home with her mother.\n\nRhonda Richardson (Kate Nash) is a British model who takes the in-ring persona of Britannica, an English genius inspired by the real GLOW wrestlers Zelda the Brain and Godiva. Prior to joining GLOW, she was homeless, living in a car and asking men for money in Santa Monica. Rhonda becomes romantically involved with Sam, but he becomes concerned when she makes their affair obvious in front of the other ladies.\n\nIn Season 2, Rhonda adds a male store window mannequin named Thomas as part of her Britannica persona; in the GLOW storyline, Britannica is working on bringing Thomas to life using her knowledge of science. When GLOW faces cancellation due to its new time slot, Rhonda reveals that she has been working without a social security number, which poses a problem for her as the ladies prepare for job openings. Not wanting to return to her drunk and abusive parents in Bromley, she takes Jenny's advice and visits the British Consulate to secure a work visa, but her request is denied and she is marked as an illegal alien. Carmen proposes for Rhonda to marry her fan Cupcake so she can secure a green card. The wedding is the focus of GLOW's final episode on K-DTV, but it falls through when Bash objects the marriage and confesses his love for Rhonda before marrying her.\n\nSheila the She-Wolf (Gayle Rankin) is an asocial woman who wears heavy black eye makeup and has a savage personality. She claims to have an acute sense of smell and hearing, hence being a light sleeper. She also says that she is spiritually a wolf and has been using her persona for at least five years. Sheila actually has blond hair underneath her thick black wig, but she refuses to break kayfabe even in everyday life. Aside from wrestling, Sheila is in charge of audio production. She can play the keyboard, but is limited to \"Theme of Exodus\".\n\nIn Season 2, Sheila is shown to have more skills outside the wrestling business. She becomes a typist for Ruth and Debbie, who have no experience in using a typewriter. At the same time, she becomes concerned about her new popularity upon seeing dozens of fans dressed like her.\n\nTammé Dawson (Kia Stevens) is a heavy-set black woman who takes the in-ring persona of The Welfare Queen, an arrogant wrestler who flaunts her wealth from America's welfare policies and preys on the impoverished. She is initially concerned with her gimmick, as her son Ernest is studying at Stanford University. Prior to joining GLOW, Tammé worked as an extra in several TV shows such as \"Knots Landing\" and \"Gimme a Break!\" and as an audience coordinator for some game shows such as \"Family Feud\".\n\nIn Season 2, Tammé pays Ernest a visit for parents' weekend. When Ernest hears that she is in GLOW, he goes with her to L.A. to attend the next taping, where she defends the GLOW crown against Debbie. Tammé loses to Debbie and is further humiliated when Debbie gives her an apron and a broom, causing her to walk out of the ring in disgust while the crowd boos Debbie. Later on she talks to Ernest, who admits he found the portrayal offensive but the sight of his mother wrestling amusing, and Tammé is able to make peace with her son watching GLOW.\n\nMelanie Danielle \"Melrose\" Rosen (Jackie Tohn) is a \"party girl\" and chauffeur who worked as an extra in several films and music videos. She initially is at odds with Cherry Bang, who sees through her as an attention-starved Jewish-American princess who has never had a real job. Melrose introduces herself as \"Melanie Rose,\" even though her real last name is Rosen. Her in-ring personality is based on the real GLOW wrestler Hollywood.\n\nDawn Rivecca (Rebekka Johnson) and Stacey Beswick (Kimmy Gatewood) are hairstylists who pull practical jokes on the other GLOW women. Their in-ring personas are Edna and Ethel Rosenblatt: The Beatdown Biddies - a geriatric tag team based on the real GLOW wrestlers The Housewives: Arlene and Phyllis. In GLOW's first show, Dawn are Stacey are put on a bind when they are scheduled to face Cherry and Tammé, as two black women beating up two elderly white women looks bad on all sides. As a compromise, The Beatdown Biddies wear Ku Klux Klan outfits (somewhat inspired by original GLOW characters The Hicks: Sara and Mabel) to completely put the match in favor of their opponents. Aside from wrestling, Dawn and Stacey are in charge of the wrestlers' hair and make-up.\n\nIn Season 2, Dawn and Stacey evolve their characters into The Toxic Twins: Nuke and Ozone, based on The Housewives' other persona The Heavy Metal Sisters: Chainsaw and Spike.\n\nArthie Premkumar (Sunita Mani) is an Indian-American pre-med student who takes the in-ring persona of Beirut the Mad Bomber, a Middle Eastern terrorist based on the real GLOW wrestler Palestina. She is also the backstage medic for the wrestlers. During her match with Rhonda in GLOW's pilot episode, Arthie's gimmick is met with extreme hostility from some male fans, who spit at her and yell racist insults at her. One fan throws a beer can at her, but she blocks it and hits Rhonda in the head. While tending to Rhonda's head wound backstage, Arthie shows concern about the fan reaction to her gimmick.\n\nIn Season 2, Arthie plans to kill off her Beirut gimmick and introduce a new persona, but her idea is stolen by Dawn and Stacey, causing a rift between them. Arthie also reveals that she failed med school, but she is more committed to GLOW than ever before. In addition, she slowly becomes attracted to newcomer Yolanda Rivas.\n\nReggie Walsh (Marianna Palka) is an Olympic medalist. She is originally given the \"Liberty Belle\" gimmick in the persona test, but because of a lack of personality, the gimmick is given to Debbie instead, and Reggie becomes Vicky the Viking due to her tall, athletic stature and blond hair. Her in-ring persona is loosely based on the real GLOW wrestler Brunhilda.\n\nIn Season 2, Reggie is fired by Sam after defending Ruth over her decision to direct GLOW's title sequence and the show's pilot episode. When GLOW is relegated to a 2:00 a.m. time slot, Reggie is rehired by Sam to help complete the season.\n\nJenny Chey (Ellen Wong) is a Cambodian-American woman who takes the in-ring persona of Fortune Cookie, a stereotypical Chinese martial artist. Aside from wrestling, Jenny is in charge of the wrestlers' costumes.\n\nIn Season 2, Jenny helps Melrose with her constipation in exchange for her jacket. This results in some animosity between the two when new crew member Phil notices Jenny wearing the jacket and makes out with her.\n\nSebastian \"Bash\" Howard (Chris Lowell) is the heir to the Howard Foods business empire and producer of GLOW, as well as the promotion's ring announcer and commentator. He provides the ladies with an old boxing gym for them to train and The Dusty Spur motel as their sleeping quarters. Bash also coordinates with K-DTV for broadcast rights and Patio Town for sponsorship. However, he is in a bind when his mother Birdie freezes his assets after having spent over $600,000 on GLOW. Bash is loosely based on GLOW creator David McLane and his dealings with financier/owner Meshulam Riklis.\n\nIn Season 2, Bash has the boxing gym converted into the official GLOW arena, but is once again strapped for cash due to Birdie funding him on a bi-monthly basis. Because of this, his butler Florian walks out on him due to a bounced check. When K-DTV relegates the show to a 2:00 a.m. time slot, Bash and Debbie go to a TV network convention and persuade several network producers to attend the final episode's taping in hopes for at least one of them to buy the show's rights. However, he is devastated upon hearing that Florian has died. While coping with his friend's death, Bash marries Rhonda on the show's final episode to help her secure a green card.\n\nMark Eagan (Rich Sommer) is Debbie's husband.

Like Cherry, Keith previously worked with Sam on his exploitation films in the 1970s.\n\nFlorian Becker (Alex Rich) is Bash's butler. He and Bash have known each other since the third grade. Florian participates in GLOW's pilot episode to present the GLOW Crown. He makes a cameo in the first episode of Season 2, but does not reappear due to a falling out with Bash over a bounced check. Florian is later revealed to be gay and passes away from pneumonia, possibly caused by AIDS.\n\nGlen Klitnick (Andrew Friedman) is an executive for North Hollywood-based K-DTV who picks up the broadcast rights of GLOW.

He initially declines to sponsor GLOW due to his lack of interest, but Sam convinces him to reconsider when Ruth cuts a promo as Zoya the Destroya during the ribbon-cutting ceremony of Patio Town's new Calabasas branch.\n\nIn Season 2, Patio Town withdraws its sponsorship of GLOW after Tammé hits Debbie with a breakable chair that is implied to be one of the store's products. Furthermore, Patrick is said to have been offended by the show's PSA on teenage pregnancy, as his mother was 15 when she gave birth to him.\n\nGregory (Ravil Isyanov) is the cranky Russian manager of The Dusty Spur motel. When Ruth needs help in developing her Zoya the Destroya character, he takes her to a Russian Jewish family party.

Bash brings the women to one of Birdie's parties in order to try to raise money from the guests to reserve a venue for the pilot, but is stopped by Gary. After letting Bash tell a sob story about the women being recovering drug addicts, a clearly skeptical Gary lets them in. In Season 2, Bash meets Gary at Birdie's house after his falling out with Florian, and expresses his various issues to Gary over some soup.

After helming \"Quilting Bee Easy\", the network's longest-running TV show, he is assigned to direct the female buddy cop series \"Chambers and Gold\". The production proves disastrous due to Cherry's inexperience in acting, causing Hollander to try another narrative direction by cutting her lines and making her change her hair. Sam intervenes and convinces Glen and Hollander to release Cherry from \"Chambers and Gold\" so she can return to GLOW.

Following their divorce, Debbie discovers that Mark has a relationship with Susan.\n\nTom Grant (Paul Fitzgerald) is the president of K-DTV. He invites Ruth over for a meeting at his hotel room, where he sexually harasses her.

In 1989, Greek television entered in a new period, the period of private television. The first private TV channels started to broadcast in 1989. After the creation of private channels the most series were played by them. The period 1995–2009 is the best period of the Greek television and frequently characterized as the golden age of the Greek TV. Then, many series were shot with expensive productions. After 2010, the Greek debt crisis affected the Greek television and the productions decreased dramatically. On the 28th of October 2018 the channel closed down at exactly 2:10 am.

The organization has both union and non-union member professionals. \n\nWhile the majority of the membership of the LMGI are based in Los Angeles where the guild was first established, many members began traveling to secondary production centers such as Atlanta, New Orleans, and Vancouver with the increasing dependence of production incentives, introduced their crews to the guild, and developed local location professional communities who in turn were invited to become members. \n\nForeign membership followed the increasing recognition of international locations such as Iceland, Jordan, and New Zealand through films such as Interstellar, The Lord of the Rings, The Martian, , and Zero Dark Thirty. The merger of the former LMGA partner organization in the United Kingdom, Guild of Location Managers, into the Production Guild of Great Britain, also resulted in a number of British Location Managers seeking an organization that represented the craft exclusively.\n\nActive Membership is limited to professional location scouts and managers. Business Membership consists of affiliated businesses with professional references.\n\nThe LMGI regularly mounts large-scale, educational art projects in partnership with community groups.\n\nLast Looks: The Ambassador Hotel\n\nOver the weekend of 20 March 2005, just before demolition began on the Ambassador Hotel, the LMGA organized an outreach event wherein Location Scouts could photograph the historic location one last time, while mentoring students from Jefferson High School (located in the Central-Alameda neighborhood of Los Angeles) in the skills of script breakdown and location scouting. The student photographs were judged by a jury that included respected Hollywood luminaries Shane Black (writer, Lethal Weapon), Alice West (co-executive producer, Ugly Betty), and Missy Stewart (production designer, Good Will Hunting). The awards ceremony was held in June 2005 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.\n\nIn 2006, the LMGA produced a photographic exhibit of images from the Ambassador Project at the Los Angeles City Hall, in the office of the City Attorney. Student photographs were hung side by side with those of the pros to remarkable result. The exhibit was featured on the front page of the Los Angeles Times calendar as an article accompanied by four full-color images.\n\nConcentric Circles: Metro L.A.

Revealed,\" exhibited at Beady Minces Art Gallery in Venice, California. Accompanied by Metro personnel, dozens of scouts rode bus and train lines across the city during the course of several weeks capturing unique images of Metro properties.\n\nThe resulting images provide a \"scout's eye\" view of various aspects of the Los Angeles Metro in the early 21st century. A book-bound catalog of film-friendly locations was created from this project as a marketing piece for the industry.\n\nThe LMGA held their inaugural awards show in March 2014 with honors going to Location Managers Robert Boake for \"Game of Thrones\" and Ilt Jones for \"Iron Man 3\", the Albuquerque Film Commission for \"Breaking Bad\" and \"Lone Survivor\", and honorary awards to Haskell Wexler for his efforts in creating a safer working environment for below the line filmmakers, and the Eva Monley award to Alexander Payne for his masterful use of location as another character is films such as \"Sideways\", \"The Descendants\", and \"Nebraska\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1480754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1480754", "title": "My Dinner with Andre", "text": "My Dinner with Andre\n\nMy Dinner with Andre is a 1981 American comedy-drama film directed by Louis Malle, and written by and starring Andre Gregory (Andre) and Wallace Shawn (Wally). The actors play fictionalized versions of themselves sharing a conversation at Café des Artistes in Manhattan. The film's dialogue covers such things as experimental theatre, the nature of theatre, and the nature of life, and contrasts Wally's modest humanism with Andre's spiritual experiences.\n\nAndre Gregory is the focus of the first hour of the film, when he describes some of his experiences since giving up his career as a theatre director in 1975. These include working with his friend, director Jerzy Grotowski, and a group of Polish actors in a forest in Poland, his visit to Findhorn in Scotland, and his trip to the Sahara to try to create a play based on \"The Little Prince\" by St.-Exupéry. He worked with a group in a small piece of performance art on Long Island, which resulted in Andre's being (briefly) buried alive on Halloween night.\n\nThe rest of the film is a conversation as Wally Shawn tries to argue that living life as Andre has done for the past five years is simply not possible for most people. He relates ordinary pleasures, like having a cup of coffee. Andre responds that what passes for normal life in New York in the late 1970s, is more akin to living in a dream than it is to real life. The movie ends without a clear resolution to the conflict in worldviews articulated by the two men. Wally reminisces during a taxi ride about his childhood and mentions that when he arrives at home, he tells his girlfriend Debbie about his dinner with Andre. Erik Satie's \"Gymnopédie No. 1\" plays in the background.\n\n\nThe idea for the film arose from Gregory's effort to work with a biographer on his life story, and Shawn's simultaneously coming up with an idea for a story about two people having a conversation. Gregory and Shawn, who had become friends through theatre work, decided to collaborate on the project. They agreed that it should be filmed rather than produced as a play. Although the film was based on events in the actors' lives, Shawn and Gregory denied (in an interview by film critic Roger Ebert) that they were playing themselves. They said that if they remade the film, they would swap the two characters to prove their point. In an interview with Noah Baumbach in 2009, Shawn said, \n\nI actually had a purpose as I was writing this: I wanted to destroy that guy that I played, to the extent that there was any of \"me\" there. I wanted to kill that side of myself by making the film, because that guy is totally motivated by fear.\n\nThe screenplay went through numerous developmental changes in location; in the final version, it was set during a dinner at a restaurant. While Shawn was trying to find someone to direct the film, he received a phone call from French director Louis Malle. He had read a copy of the screenplay via a mutual friend and insisted that he work on the project, saying he wanted to direct, produce the film, or work on it in any capacity. Shawn initially thought that the call was a prank, due to Malle's stature in film. Malle later suggested that the dinner setup would not work, based on a rehearsal where Gregory was talking while eating. Shawn argued throughout screenplay development for more scenes, which would have resulted in a three-hour film. Malle won many script cuts, but lost two arguments over scenes that were kept in the film.\n\n\"My Dinner with Andre\" was filmed in the Jefferson Hotel, which was then vacant, in Richmond, Virginia. (The hotel has since been restored and reopened as a luxury venue.) Lloyd Kaufman was the production manager on the film, and Troma Entertainment provided production support. The filming was done over a period of two weeks, and edited to appear as if occurring in real time. The set was created to look like the iconic Café des Artistes in New York City.\n\nRoger Ebert and Gene Siskel gave high praise to the film on \"Sneak Previews\"; the producers told Ebert that their praise helped keep the film in theaters for a year. Ebert later named it as the best film of the year. In 1999, he added it to his \"Great Movies\" essay series. He said, \"Someone asked me the other day if I could name a movie that was entirely devoid of clichés. I thought for a moment, and then answered, \"My Dinner with Andre\".\" The Boston Society of Film Critics Awards ranked it as the \"Best American Film\" in 1982, and awarded Gregory and Shawn its prize for Best Screenplay.\n\nThroughout the film, Andre references his wife \"Chiquita\"; in real life he was married to Mercedes \"Chiquita\" Nebelthau, who died in 1992. Nebelthau was a documentary filmmaker whose credits include three films about Jerzy Grotowski, whom Wally and Andre talk about in this film.\n\nThroughout the film, Wally references his \"girlfriend Debbie\". Though not actually identified, Debbie is the acclaimed short story writer Deborah Eisenberg, although she had not begun publishing stories at the time of the film. Eisenberg is also an extra in the film, a dark-haired diner Shawn glances at as he scans the restaurant while standing at the bar waiting for Andre.\n\n\nRichard Linklater is a big fan of \"My Dinner With Andre\" and considers this film to be a big influence on his own work.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1829375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1829375", "title": "Ovitz family", "text": "Ovitz family\n\nThe Ovitz family was a family of Romanian Jewish actors/traveling musicians who survived imprisonment at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II. Most of them were dwarfs. They were the largest family of dwarfs ever recorded and were the largest family to enter Auschwitz and survive intact; the family of twelve ranged from a 15-month-old baby to a 58-year-old woman.\n\nThe Ovitz family originated from Maramureş County, Romania. They were descended from Shimson Eizik Ovitz (1868–1923), a \"badchen\" entertainer, itinerant rabbi and himself a dwarf. He fathered ten children in total, seven of them dwarfs (afflicted with pseudoachondroplasia), from two marriages.\n\nThe children from his first marriage to Brana Fruchter (she was of average height), Rozika (1886–1984) and Franzika (1889–1980), were both dwarfs. Shimson's second wife, Batia Bertha Husz, also of average height, produced the following children: Avram (1903–1972; dwarf), Freida (1905–1975; dwarf), Sarah (1907–1993; average height), Micki (1909–1972; dwarf), Leah (1911-1987; average height), Elizabeth (1914–1992; dwarf), Arie (1917–1944; average height), and Piroska (a.k.a. \"Perla\"; 1921–2001; dwarf).\n\nThe children founded their own ensemble, the \"Lilliput Troupe\". They sang and played music using small instruments and performed all over Romania, Hungary and Czechoslovakia in the 1930s and 1940s. The taller relatives helped backstage. The Ovitzes sang in Yiddish, Hungarian, Romanian, Russian and German. When they were not touring, they lived in a single house with their spouses.\n\nAt the start of World War II, there were 12 family members, seven of them dwarfs. When Hungary seized Northern Transylvania in September 1940, the new racial laws banned Jewish artists from entertaining non-Jews. Though the Ovitzes were observant Jews, they obtained papers which omitted the fact that they were Jewish and continued going on their tours until 1944. On 12 May 1944, all twelve family members were deported to Auschwitz. One average sized brother, Arie, escaped the round up but was later arrested and executed in 1944.\n\nOnce in the camp, the Ovitzes attracted the attention of the German camp doctor Josef Mengele (known as the \"Angel of Death\"), who collected curiosities for pseudoscientific experiments on heredity. He separated the Ovitzes from the rest of the camp inmates to add them to his collection of test subjects. He was curious about the fact that the family included both dwarfs and taller members. Eleven other prisoners claimed to be their relatives, and Mengele moved all of them accordingly.\n\nWanting to spare the group of dwarfs (because they were harder to find than other kinds of test subjects, such as twins), Mengele arranged to have special living quarters built for them, so they could be monitored. To keep them healthy for his human experimentation, he arranged for them to have more hygienic living conditions, better food and their own bedclothes. Mengele allowed them to keep their own clothes, and forced the taller members of the group to carry the dwarfs to the experimentation sites.\n\nThe Ovitzes—like many other camp inmates—were subjected to various tests. Mengele's physicians extracted bone marrow and pulled out teeth and hair to find signs of hereditary disease. They poured hot and cold water in their ears and blinded them with chemical drops. Gynecologists inspected the married women. \n\nEighteen-month-old Shimshon Ovitz was put through the worst ordeals because he had taller parents and was prematurely born; Mengele drew blood from the veins behind his ears and from his fingers on a daily basis often causing weakness. The Ovitzes also witnessed two newcomer dwarfs being killed and boiled so their bones could be exhibited in a museum. Mengele also filmed them; this film was not found after the war, and it is possible that he kept it when he fled.\n\nThey expected to be killed after Mengele had finished his experiments, but they lived to see the liberation of Auschwitz on 27 January 1945. The Red Army took them to the Soviet Union where they lived in a refugee camp for some time before they were released.\n\nThe Ovitzes traveled on foot for seven months to their home village. They found their home looted, moved first to the town of Sighet and later to Belgium. In May 1949, they immigrated to Israel, settled in Haifa, and began their tours again, being quite successful and packing large concert halls. In 1955, they retired and bought a cinema hall.\n\nDescendants of the dwarf men of the family were born taller; the women did not become pregnant due to their small pelvises. The firstborn of the dwarfs, Rozika Ovitz, died in 1984 at the age of 98. The last adult dwarf survivor of the family, Perla Ovitz, died in 2001.\n\nIn March 2013, Warwick Davis presented an episode of the ITV series \"Perspectives\", entitled \"Warwick Davis - The Seven Dwarfs of Auschwitz\". He explored the historical story of the Ovitz family, including an interview with Perla Ovitz recorded in 1999 recounting how they survived the Nazi concentration camp of Auschwitz and Mengele's experiments. The interview from the film comes from a documentary, \"Liebe Perla\" (German for \"Dear Perla\").\n\n\n"}

After Presto returns from eating a meal, he begins practicing his act with Alec, revealing that his top hat is magically connected to a wizard's hat kept backstage with Alec. Anything that passes into either hat will emerge from the other.\n\nIntending to feed Alec, Presto realizes that his show is starting and rushes onstage instead. Alec refuses to cooperate with the act and turns the hats against Presto in a variety of ways that lead to escalating degrees of humiliation, such as letting him catch his finger in a mousetrap, hit himself in the eye with a raw egg, and get his head sucked into a ventilation shaft. Presto continues to antagonize Alec at the same time, first turning the carrot into a flower and later smashing it to pulp with a club. \n\nFed up with Alec's behavior, Presto storms backstage after him, but accidentally releases a set of hanging stage props and gets his foot caught in a rigging rope. He is yanked up into the fly space above the stage; when his foot comes loose, he falls again and finds himself in danger of being crushed by both the props and a falling piano. Alec uses the hats' magic to save him, earning the audience's wild approval for him and Presto, who gratefully gives him a fresh carrot and starts to give him second billing on the posters advertising the act.\n\nDoug Sweetland made his directorial debut with \"Presto\". Sweetland provides the dialogue-free voice acting for both of the movie's characters. He pitched the film at the start of 2007 and began production late in the year, completing it in May 2008. \"Presto\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> gag based format was heavily influenced by classic cartoons. \"Looney Tunes\" cartoons directed by Tex Avery were a major influence, with Alec being easily compared to Bugs Bunny. Other influences include \"Tom and Jerry\", the Marx Brothers, and Charlie Chaplin. The character design for Presto was based on William Powell.\n\nThe original scenario for the short involved a magician who incorporates an autograph seeking rabbit into his act after his previous rabbit leaves him. Complications arise as the new rabbit suffers from stage fright. Sweetland compared it to the plot of \"A Star Is Born\". The idea was reworked due to being too long and complicated, taking an estimated three minutes longer to tell.\n\nTo achieve the highly formal environment, the filmmakers looked at the Royal Opera House in London, the Paris Opera House and classic vaudeville theaters like the Geary in San Francisco—which the crew took a tour through—for set design ideas. Animating the theater's audience of 2,500 patrons proved an expensive proposition, even with the help of the crowd-generating \"MASSIVE\" software. \n\nEarly suggestions were to show cutaways of just a small portion of the audience, but the full effect was achieved by only showing the back of the audience. To save time, most of the audience models were borrowed from the previous Pixar film, \"Ratatouille\". Additionally, Presto's body (from the neck down) is Skinner's lawyer, and the carrot was one of the many food props from that film.\n\nReaction to the short film was positive. Carl Cortez of \"If\" called \"Presto\" a \"winner through and through\". Jake Coyle of the \"Associated Press\" found \"Presto\" to be \"a delightful and cartoonish appetizer\" which kept the tradition of short pre feature films alive. Darren Bevan of Television New Zealand thought that although \"WALL-E\" was a \"delightful tale\" and \"truly gorgeous\", \"Presto\" \"very nearly stole \"Wall-E's\" thunder\". James Sanford of the \"Kalamazoo Gazette\" called the short a superb and hilarious curtain raiser, describing it as a Bugs Bunny \"Looney Tunes\" version of \"The Prestige\". \"Presto\" was nominated for the 36th Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject. The short was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, but lost to \"La Maison en Petits Cubes\".\n\n"}

Once this testing is successfully completed, and all measured parameters match what was authorized in the permit, the permittee can apply to the broadcasting authority for a broadcast license to cover the permit. PTA lasts until the license is issued (or, rarely, denied).\n\n\"Program\" refers to the permission to broadcast regular radio programming or TV programming, instead of just a test transmission such as a test card or bars and tone (TV only), broadcast callsign or other required station identification, or dead air (which may not be permissible). Otherwise, only brief tests are allowed without PTA, in order to verify proper installation and functioning of all transmission equipment, such as the transmitter components (exciter and amplifier), feedline, antenna, and any diplexers that may be used.\n\nIn the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) gives most stations automatic program test authority if they are using an omnidirectional antenna. For stations with a directional antenna, PTA is only for half of regular power, and is not granted until the permittee's broadcast engineer certifies that the antenna is installed properly so that the station's radiation pattern is correct. Stations must apply for a license within 30 days of starting broadcasts under program test authority. Upon issuance of the license, directional stations then commence full-power operation.\n"}

At a point on the summit of Ben Lomond for example, looking west all water flows to the Firth of Clyde, and looking east all water flows into the Firth of Forth. \nSimilarly Cumbernauld is a point on this line and arguably its Gaelic name has, for hundreds of years, reflected this fact. There is some dispute however about interpretation of the Gaelic phrase. The line joining all such points in Scotland is the Scottish watershed.\n\nAlthough the concept of geographical watersheds is common, the first unequivocal reference to the Scottish watershed is to be found in Groome's Ordnance Gazetteer of 1884, in which the entry defines the northern terminus as being at Duncansby Head. This was followed in 1912 with the Bartholomew Atlas Survey (NLS) which shows the entire geographic feature, from the border with England to Duncansby Head. The first popular delineation of the Scottish watershed took place as recently as 1986. It was mapped out in that year by Dave Hewitt, who in 1987 then walked the line of the watershed from south to north. The Royal Scottish Geographical Society (RSGS) reviewed Wright`s `Ribbon of Wildness` in 2011, and in acknowledging the significance of the route, stated that \"Ribbon of Wildness gives a vivid introduction to this hitherto largely unknown geographic feature\". Eight people have now done versions of this route:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5001372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5001372", "title": "Tha Carter III", "text": "Tha Carter III\n\nTha Carter III is the sixth studio album by American rapper Lil Wayne, released on June 10, 2008, by Cash Money and Universal Motown. It follows a long string of mixtape releases and guest appearances on other hip hop and R&B artists records, helping to increase his exposure in the mainstream. The album's cover art features a baby picture of Wayne and is similar to covers of hip hop albums such as Nas' \"Illmatic\" (1994) and the Notorious B.I.G.'s \"Ready to Die\" (1994). Amid release delays and leaks, \"Tha Carter III\" became one of the most anticipated releases of 2008. It is widely-regarded as one of Wayne’s best projects, and one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time.\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200 chart, selling 1,006,000 copies in its first week. It reached sales of 2.88 million copies by the end of 2008 and produced four singles that achieved chart success, including the international hit \"Lollipop\" and \"Billboard\" hits \"A Milli\", \"Got Money\", and \"Mrs. Officer\". Upon its release, \"Tha Carter III\" received universal acclaim from music critics and earned Lil Wayne several accolades, including a spot on \"Rolling Stone\"s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. It has been certified triple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and has sold 3.6 million copies in the United States. \"Tha Carter III\" features appearances from Jay-Z, T-Pain, Robin Thicke, Busta Rhymes, and Kanye West, among others. It also features Static Major, who is credited posthumously following his death in February 2008.\n\nLil Wayne stated that producers would include The Alchemist, Cool & Dre, Deezle, Jim Jonsin, Just Blaze, Kanye West, Mannie Fresh, The Runners, Timbaland, Danja, and will.i.am. In an interview with HipHopCanada.com, Solitair of the Black Jays stated that he and Cipha Sounds produced a track called \"Outstanding\", which later eventually leaked. The Runners have stated that they have produced three tracks for \"Tha Carter III\". Lil Wayne revealed that he has a track for Eminem, which he has yet to send to him. He described this song as the \"craziest\". Some believe that his request was turned down, but it most likely turned into \"Drop the World\" on his 2010 album \"Rebirth\".\n\nThe album features guest appearances by Fabolous, T-Pain, Brisco, Bobby V, Babyface, Betty Wright, Static Major, Robin Thicke, Jay-Z, Juelz Santana, and Busta Rhymes. MTV reported that Wyclef Jean worked on a couple of tracks for the album and that a song featuring Justin Timberlake, Nelly Furtado, and Timbaland was likely to appear on the album. However, that Timbaland-produced track did not make the final cut. David Banner confirmed that he will be credited for five tracks on the final cut of \"Tha Carter III\", but only one is featured on the album. After the copyright controversy of \"Playing with Fire\", the track was later removed and replaced with another David Banner-produced track \"Pussy Monster\". Swizz Beatz stated he was also working on the album. When asked about how many tracks Kanye West had contributed, he answered:\n\n\"Tha Carter III\"s lead single, \"Lollipop\", peaked at number one on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, staying at the top for three weeks. It was Wayne's most successful solo single in his career, winning one Grammy Award, a BET Award, and an MTV VMA. The song was praised as an \"electro-bumpin'...infectious track\", perceived as more of a \"bubblegum\" pop track than rap. The second track on the album, \"Mr. Carter\", was nominated for a Grammy while also peaking within the Hot 100. It was praised for featuring Jay-Z, which was seen as Jay-Z passing the throne to Wayne. The second single, \"A Milli\", was a top ten hit and was praised as one of the best songs of 2008. The song garnered countless freestyles and remixes, while Wayne's original version was praised with \"spectacular rhyme\". \"Dr. Carter\", the sixth track, was also praised for lyrical content and humor as Wayne took on the persona of a doctor performing surgery on various patients (a metaphor for Wayne resurrecting hip-hop). \"Tie My Hands\", featuring Robin Thicke, was praised as a deep track featuring \"political commentary\" and \"despair\" with Thicke's performance being the most complementary to Wayne. \"Phone Home\" also features various alien metaphors reminiscent of the film \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" (1982).\n\nAfter most of the album leaked on the Internet in mid-2007, Lil Wayne used the leaked tracks, plus four new songs to make an album titled \"The Leak\". \"The Leak\" was to be officially released on December 18, 2007, with the actual album being delayed until June 10, 2008. When questioned about the unplanned leak, Lil Wayne said:\n\nOn May 24, 2008, 10-second snippets of multiple songs were leaked onto AT&T Media Mall. On May 30–31, \"Tha Carter III\" was leaked internationally. The first of the leaks were distributed on May 30 at around 8pm where five songs from the track list were available on the internet. Hours later on May 31 at 12am-1am the whole album was leaked and posted on various websites for free download. The DJ responsible for the leaks was DJ Chuck T who retaliated for an interview conducted by Wayne, where he discredited all DJs and the mixtape scene days before. Lil Wayne later called DJ Drama's radio show Shade 45 Sirius Satellite Radio to explain that his comments were meant specifically for DJ Empire who leaked his materials periodically without his permission, consent, or knowledge; he also apologized for any misunderstandings between him and the numerous DJs that have aided him in the mixtape industry. He made it clear, however, that he wished for any feelings of dislike or resentment to remain.\n\nThe album's lead single, \"Lollipop\", topped the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for 5 non-consecutive weeks, making it Wayne's most successful single in his career. It features rapper Static Major. The album's second single, \"A Milli\", was another top ten. It reached #6 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. It also won a Grammy for Best Rap Song. The video for the second single, \"A Milli\", was set to be released in May, and has since been mainstreamed. Multiple versions of the track were to be included on the album as \"skit-like\" tracks, featuring artists such as Tyga, Cory Gunz, Hurricane Chris and Lil Mama. Another artist, 13-year-old Lil Chuckee, was also set to appear on one of the \"A Milli\" skits. None of the skits made the final cut of the album. The third single is \"Got Money\", featuring T-Pain. It reached #10 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The fourth single is \"Mrs. Officer\", featuring Bobby Valentino. It made the Top 20 in just four weeks. \"Comfortable\" was sent to American rhythmic contemporary radio as the album's fifth and final single on September 29, 2008. \"Lollipop\", \"A Milli\", \"Got Money\", and another track, \"Mr. Carter\", were nominated for a Grammy. Lil Wayne also performed \"Tie My Hands\" with Robin Thicke at the 51st Grammy Awards.\n\nThe album also featured the releases of promo singles. \"3 Peat\" peaked at number 66 on the \"Billboard\" 100. \"You Ain't Got Nuthin\" featuring Fabolous and Juelz Santana was released as a promo single, peaking at number 81 on the \"Billboard\" 100. \"Mr. Carter\", featuring Jay-Z, peaked at number 62 on the \"Billboard\" 100, number 27 on the Hot R&B/Hip Hop Songs chart, and number 13 on the Top Rap Songs. It was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or a Group in 2009.\n\nOn July 24, 2008, Abkco Music Inc. filed a lawsuit against Lil Wayne for copyright infringement and unfair competition, specifically referring to the track \"Playing with Fire\". In the lawsuit, Abkco claims that the song was obviously derived from The Rolling Stones' \"Play with Fire\", to which Abkco owns the rights. Subsequently, \"Playing with Fire\" was removed from the track list of \"Tha Carter III\" on all online music stores and replaced with the David Banner produced track, \"Pussy Monster\".\n\nOn March 2011, producer Deezle (Darius Harrison) sued Wayne and his parent labels Cash Money Records over unpaid royalties from Tha Carter III album. On May 2011, producer Bangladesh also filed a lawsuit against Weezy & Co. over unpaid royalties. In early June 2011, another producer named David Kirkwood filed a lawsuit against Young Money Entertainment and Cash Money Records on claims that the labels have failed to pay him over $1.5 million in royalties and production services for his work on the album, also including his songwriting on \"Love Me or Hate Me\", a bonus song featured only on the deluxe edition of the album. Also in June 2011, Dallas producers Play-N-Skillz filed a lawsuit against him claiming Wayne owed them at least $1 million in unpaid royalties for \"Got Money\" from \"Tha Carter III\".\n\n\"Tha Carter III\" received universal acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 84, based on 26 reviews. AllMusic editor David Jeffries praised Wayne's \"entertaining wordplay and plenty of well-executed, left-field ideas\". \"The Guardian\"s Alex Macpherson lauded Wayne's rapping, stating \"Just trying to keep up with Wayne's mind as he proves the case is a thrill. He breaks language down into building blocks for new metaphors, exploiting every possible semantic and phonetic loophole for humour and yanking pop culture references into startling new contexts\". Jonah Weiner of \"Blender\" called it \"a weird, gripping triumph\". \"Rolling Stone\" writer Jody Rosen commended its themes and stated \"This isn't a mixtape, it's a suite of songs, paced and sequenced for maxaqimum impact.\" Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\" commented that Wayne \"has clearly worked to make \"Tha Carter III\" a statement of its own: one that moves beyond standard hip-hop boasting (though there's plenty of that) to thoughts that can be introspective or gleefully unhinged\". \"Pitchfork\"s Ryan Dombal stated, \"he distills the myriad metaphors, convulsing flows, and vein-splitting emotions into a commercially gratifying package\". In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau noted that \"every track attends to detail\" and quipped, \"From the start you know this is no mixtape because it's clearer and more forceful.\" \"Uncut\" stated that \"the prince of hip-hop gets a blessing from the king.\" Mosi Reeves of \"Paste\" gave it a favorable review and noted that the album \"hearkens to when rap meant \"rapp\": Isaac Hayes talking for days about some girl he broke with, or Bobby Womack signifying while strumming a blues guitar.\" Nathan Rabin of \"The A.V. Club\" called Lil Wayne \"the man of the moment, but the disc's best moments strive for timelessness and attain it.\"\n\n\"The Washington Post\"s J. Freedom du Lac commended Wayne for his \"impulses to be outrageous and unconventional\", calling him a \"nonsensical genius\", but found the album \"uneven\". Tom Breihan of \"The Village Voice\" described it as \"a sprawling mess, and it clangs nearly as often as it clicks\" and \"a work of staggering heights and maddening inconsistencies\", but commended Wayne for his unconventional performance, stating \"On paper, this is a textbook focus-grouped major-label hodgepodge, replete with girl songs and club songs and street songs. But every facet of the album comes animated and atomized by Wayne's absurdist drug-gobbling persona\". Drew Hinshaw of \"PopMatters\" stated \"\"Tha Carter III\" is a monumental album full of powerful, self-defeating statements that obliterate rap's internal logic without offering too much more than indifferent bong logic in return. Judged, however, as a collection of singles and quotable verses—the criteria on which we've been grading hip-hop records since the end of disco—\"Tha Carter III\" is an agonizing piece of work\". Jeff Weiss of the \"Los Angeles Times\" found it \"scattershot\", stating \"When Wayne's mad alchemy works, \"Tha Carter III\" evinces shades of brilliance that merit the wild hype, but in its transparent attempts to define its era, it fails, falling victim to the imperial bloat of its big-budget mishmash of styles.\" Jon Caramanica of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote that \"this schizoid album [...] is alternately mesmerizing and inscrutable.\" \"Slant Magazine\"'s Dave Hughes viewed that it lacks a \"focus\" as an album, and stated, \"while there are a lot of [...] great moments here, \"Carter III\" is not the definitive statement of Wayne's mastery that he clearly intended it to be.\" Brandon Perkins of \"URB\" commented that \"As a sum of its parts, \"Tha Carter III\" does not transcend, but a good number of those parts are otherworldly enough.\" Julian Benbow of \"The Boston Globe\" said the album was \"not an instant classic, but it is the best rap album since Kanye West dropped \"Graduation\" last year.\" Eric R. Danton of the \"Hartford Courant\" said of Lil Wayne, \"If his raspy, cartoonish voice didn't mark him as different, his quick wit, offhanded wordplay and quirky subject matter should have in a genre populated largely by grim-faced imitators.\"\n\nOther reviews are average or mixed: Chase Hoffberger of \"The Austin Chronicle\" gave the album three stars out of five and said, \"It's Wayne's personality that both floats and sinks \"TCIII\".\" Kilian Murphy of \"Hot Press\" also gave it a score of three out of five and stated, \"Gifted MC loses the run of himself without Mannie Fresh.\" Lewis P. of Sputnikmusic likewise gave it a score of three out of five and said the album \"is scattershot, which oddly strengthens its faults, as if any lull in quality means that the next batch of producers can just reset the formula.\" (However, nearly three years later, in 2011, Alex Robertson of the same website gave the album a score of four-and-a-half out of five and said it was \"sort of a miracle: it's way too weird and confusing to be on the mainstream rap charts--to be that record that everyone knows about--but it is anyway. This album was in opposition to much of modern rap but somehow became popular and then proceeded to completely consume the genre and change its direction. [...] \"Tha Carter III\" is a contradictory, against-all-odds masterpiece, and Lil Wayne may never perfect this balance again. I sincerely question: will anyone?\") Ajitpaul Manjat of Tiny Mix Tapes gave the album two-and-a-half stars out of five and stated that, \"equipped with the stylish, but too-often substance-less \"Tha Carter III,\" Lil Wayne seems poised to flip the script on the \"rapper racists\" (radio stations, MTV) by evolving into the \"biggest\" rapper alive.\"\n\n\"Tha Carter III\" was ranked number one in \"Blender\"s list of the 33 best albums of 2008. Christgau ranked its deluxe edition as the second best album of 2008. The album was also ranked number three on \"Rolling Stone\"s list of the top 50 albums of 2008. It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year, and it won for Best Rap Album at the 2009 Grammy Awards, while \"Lollipop\" won for Best Rap Song and \"A Milli\" won for Best Rap Solo Performance. \"Billboard\" magazine ranked the album number 103 on its list of the Top 200 Albums of the Decade. In 2012, the album was ranked number 437 on \"Rolling Stone\"s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2012 Complex named the album one of the classic albums of the last decade.\n\nWith opening day sales figures of approximately 423,000, the album sold 1,005,545 copies in its first week in the United States. With its first week sales, it is the largest first week sales for any album in 2008 in the United States and the first album to reach the million mark in one week since 50 Cent's \"The Massacre\" (2005). \"Tha Carter III\" has also reached the top spot in the Canadian Albums Chart, selling nearly 21,000 units. Elsewhere, the album achieved moderate success, entering at only number 23 in the UK and number 34 on the Irish Album Chart. In the album's second week, it sold a reported 309,000 copies, helping \"Tha Carter III\" towards becoming Lil Wayne's most successful selling album to date.\n\n\"Tha Carter III\" had sold approximately 2.88 million copies in 2008, after selling another 985,000 and 964,000 in two week span week June 24–July 8 and well over 697,000 the following week in a 7 day span, becoming 2008's best-selling album. By the end of 2008, it was named the best-selling album of the year in the United States by \"Billboard\". On February 12, 2009, the album was certified triple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), following shipments of three million copies. As of July 2011, it has sold 3.6 million copies in the US, and 6.6 million copies worldwide.\n\nNotes\n\nCredits for \"Tha Carter III\" adapted from Allmusic.\n\n\n"}

The series of films is part of the larger Universal Monsters series.\n\nIn 1959, the British Hammer Film Productions began its own \"The Mummy\" series of films. These include the following:\n\nOriginally a proposed remake of \"The Mummy\" would have been directed by horror filmmaker/writer Clive Barker. Barker’s vision for the film was violent, with the story revolving around the head of a contemporary art museum who turns out to be a cultist trying to reanimate mummies. Barker's take was \"dark, sexual and filled with mysticism\", and that, \"it would have been a great low-budget movie\".\n\nIn 1999, Stephen Sommers wrote and directed a remake of \"The Mummy\", loosely based on the original film of 1932. This film switches genres from the emphasis on horror to adventure, concentrating more on action sequences, special effects, comedy, and a higher element of Egyptian lore. The film became a box office success spawning two sequels, several video games, a spin-off series, and an animated television series. The first two films received mixed reviews, while the third one received mostly negative reviews.\n\n\nAfter \"\" was released, actress Maria Bello stated that another \"Mummy\" film will \"absolutely\" be made, and that she had already signed on. Actor Luke Ford was signed on for three films as well. But in 2012, Universal Pictures announced that they had cancelled the film and were focusing on a reboot.\n\nThis spin-off series follows the adventures of Mathayus, who would later be known as the Scorpion King and, eventually, become a foe in \"The Mummy Returns\". The films are as follows:\n\nOn April 4, 2012, Universal Studios announced that they are developing a reboot of the series, with Jon Spaihts to write the film and Sean Daniel who produced the three films, will be returning as producer. On May 1, 2012, Universal signed on with Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman a two-year deal to produce the \"Mummy\" reboot through their K/O Paper Products banner. On September 24, 2012, it was announced that Universal has set Len Wiseman to direct the film. In December 2012, it was being said that \"The Mummy\" reboot will be different from the classic trilogy, it'll be a completely new take on the mythology, and it will be set in present day. On February 14, 2013, Universal set \"The Hunger Games'\" writer Billy Ray to write a competitive draft for the \"Mummy\" reboot against Spaihts written script. On July 31, 2013, director Wiseman has left the film project due of schedule conflicts. On September 13, 2013, news reported that \"Mama\"'s director Andrés Muschietti is in talks to direct the film.\n\nIn October 2013, Orci spoke to IGN, hinted that both \"The Mummy\" and \"Van Helsing\" reboots will have a shared universe. On November 27, 2013, Universal has set the film for an April 22, 2016, release. On May 6, 2014, director Muschetti left the film due to creative differences, which Spaihts wrote the latest draft of the script, which reimagined \"The Mummy\" in modern-day with new characters not seen in previous iterations and a protagonist imbued with a human personality. On July 16, 2014, Universal announced that they had tapped Alex Kurtzman and Chris Morgan to develop all classic movie monsters which include Frankenstein, Dracula, The Wolf Man, Creature from the Black Lagoon, The Invisible Man, Bride of Frankenstein, and The Mummy. The first film they will develop together will be \"The Mummy\", for which they had begun the meetings. So on July 30, Kurtzman was set to direct the film. Next day, the film's release date was pushed back to March 27, 2017, when Universal announced the April 22 for its new film \"The Huntsman\". The film's plot is set in Iraq and follows a Navy SEAL and his team that battle mummies led by Ashurbanipal.\n\nOn October 14, 2015, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" reported that Kurtzman and Spaihts has two scripts with a male and a female mummy villain. On November 24, 2015, Variety reports that Tom Cruise is in talks to star in the film. Variety also reports that Cruise isn’t expected to produce, but he will play a major part in development. On December 8, 2015, The Hollywood Reporter has reported that Sofia Boutella is in talks for the female Mummy role in the reboot. It was announced that Cruise and Boutella will star in the reboot with a June 9, 2017, release date. In March 2016, Variety and The Hollywood Reporter has reported that Annabelle Wallis and Jake Johnson are in talks for a role of an archaeologist and a member of the military. The film began production in April 2016 located in Oxford, England.\n\n<div class=\"overflowbugx\" style=\"overflow:auto; width:100%;\">\n\nList indicator(s)\n\nTwo video game adaptations of \"The Mummy\" (1999) were developed by Rebellion Developments and published by Konami in 2000: an action-adventure game for the PlayStation and PC as well as a Game Boy Color puzzle game. Dreamcast version was announced but later cancelled in the late 2000. \"The Mummy Returns\" released in late 2001 for the PlayStation 2 and developed by Blitz Games, the Game Boy Color version was developed by GameBrains, both versions were published by Universal Interactive. \"\" was released in 2008, developed by Eurocom for the PlayStation 2 and the Wii, the Nintendo DS released was developed by A2M, all versions were published by Sierra Entertainment. In March 2012, a massive multiplayer online game known as \"The Mummy Online\" was released.\n\nIn May 2001, Chaos! Comics released the first of a three-issue series inspired by the film, titled \"The Mummy: Valley of the Gods\". The plot was supposed to take place between the first film and \"The Mummy Returns\". Rick and Evelyn are on their honeymoon in Egypt and end up embarking on yet another adventure where they must unravel the mysteries of the Orb of Destiny and discover the location of the Valley of the Gods hidden beneath the sands. However, the second and third issues were never published.\nThis was most likely due to Chaos later filing bankruptcy in 2002 and selling the rights to all their titles at that time.\nYears later in 2008, another Mummy comic series was released by IDW Publishing, spanning four issues. This series was titled \"The Mummy: The Rise and Fall of Xango's Ax\". Unlike the preceding comic series, all of the planned issues were published.\n\nFrom 2001 until 2003, an animated series simply titled \"The Mummy\" was made by Universal Animation Studios where it was based on the Stephen Sommers series of films. The series was later renamed in the second season as \"The Mummy: Secrets of the Medjai\".\n\nThe film also inspired a roller coaster ride named \"Revenge of the Mummy: The Ride\" in Universal Studios Theme Parks, Florida.

They often have a marked off art area which is 10 inches by 15 inches, which is the actual size of original comic book art. This format is larger than a printed comic page, and will get scaled down before it sees publication in a comic book.\n\nThe term 'ply' comes from the fact that the drawing board consists of two interwoven layers, resulting in a thickness made up of two layers or strands. It is sometimes referred to as a Bristol board or as Bristol paper.\n"}

The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by Roy Huggins and John Pogue. The film is a spin-off to the 1993 motion picture \"The Fugitive\", which in turn was based on the television series of the same name, created by Huggins. The story does not involve the character of Dr. Richard Kimble, portrayed by Harrison Ford in the initial film, but instead the plot centers on United States Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard, once again played by Tommy Lee Jones. The plot follows Gerard and his team as they pursue another fugitive, Mark Sheridan, played by Wesley Snipes, who attempts to escape government officials following an international conspiracy scandal. The cast features Robert Downey Jr., Joe Pantoliano, Daniel Roebuck, Tom Wood, and LaTanya Richardson, several of whom portrayed Deputy Marshals in the previous film.\n\nThe film was a co-production between the motion picture studios of Warner Bros. and Kopelson Entertainment. Theatrically, it was commercially distributed by Warner Bros. and by the Warner Home Video division for home media markets. On March 10, 1998, the original motion picture soundtrack was released by the Varèse Sarabande music label. The soundtrack was composed and orchestrated by musician Jerry Goldsmith.\n\n\"U.S. Marshals\" premiered in theaters in the United States on March 6, 1998, grossing $57 million in its domestic run. The film took in an additional $45 million through international release for a worldwide total of $102 million. The film was generally met with mixed critical reviews. The film was released on home video on July 21, 1998.\n\nIn New York, security cameras in a United Nations parking garage record two Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agents attempting to intercept a briefcase exchange between two men. One man kills the agents; the other escapes with top secret information.\n\nIn Chicago, months later, and after a horrible car crash, police arrest tow truck driver Mark Warren for possession of an illegal handgun and discover that he is federal fugitive Mark Roberts, wanted for a double homicide. Roberts boards a prisoner transport aircraft back to New York, sharing the flight with Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard, who is escorting another prisoner to the transport's first stop in Memphis. A Chinese prisoner armed with a zip gun tries to kill Roberts mid-flight but in the struggle, the bullet pierces a window, depressurizing the cabin and sending the prisoner and another Marshal to their deaths. The plane makes an emergency crash landing in Southern Illinois, where Roberts flees and Gerard issues a manhunt for the escapee. DSS Director Bertram Lamb reveals that Roberts' fingerprints ID him as the killer of his DSS agents and assigns DSS Special Agent John Royce to join Gerard's team to hunt Roberts. Gerard inspects Royce's firearm and dismissively insists Royce replace it with a Glock.\n\nAfter traveling to New York City and securing money, weapons and fake identification, Roberts surveilles Chinese diplomat Xiang Chen, the other man from the parking garage. In Chicago, Gerard and the Marshals pursue several leads, including Roberts' girlfriend Marie Bineaux. Roberts secretly contacts Bineaux to explain that he secretly worked for the government and was ambushed during a routine exchange, killing the men before realizing they were DSS agents. The Marshals track the airplane mechanic who was bribed to hide the zip gun and discover too late that he has been murdered by Chen.\n\nGerard acquires the surveillance footage of the murders and discover Roberts killed the agents in self-defense and was wearing gloves; thus he could not have been identified by fingerprints at the scene as Lamb claimed. Confronted with the evidence, Lamb admits that Mark Roberts is in fact Mark Sheridan, a former Force Recon Marine, who was working as an unofficial operative for the government. The DSS is investigating a mole within the U.S. State Department selling covert secrets to China, believed to be Sheridan. The agents were tailing Chen, a Chinese intelligence agent who was the contact between China and the mole, but when they tried to intercept the exchange, Sheridan killed them and fled.\n\nEventually, Gerard and his team catch up with Sheridan in Queens Hill Cemetery where he ambushes DSS Special Agent Frank Barrows, who conspired with the mole to frame Sheridan by duping him into making the exchange. As Sheridan holds Barrows hostage to try and clear his name, Chen inadvertently kills Barrows while trying to shoot Sheridan. Marshals Savannah Cooper and Bob Biggs apprehend Chen, while Sheridan flees to a retirement home followed by Gerard, Royce and Marshal Noah Newman. During a struggle, Royce disarms Sheridan and holds him at gunpoint. Before Royce can kill Sheridan, Newman walks into the room and Royce shoots Newman, giving Sheridan the opportunity to jump off the roof and onto a moving subway. Royce gives false information to Gerard, claiming that Sheridan shot Newman, who later dies of his injuries before he can reveal the truth.\n\nGerard, out for revenge, abandons his team and takes Royce along while following up on a new lead. They track Sheridan to a loading dock in Bayonne, New Jersey where he is stowing away on a freighter bound for Canada. Gerard confronts, fights and nearly kills Sheridan but lets his guard down, enabling Sheridan to get the upper hand. Royce unloads his new Glock at Sheridan, hitting him in the shoulder, and the marshals take Sheridan into custody.\n\nAt the hospital, Gerard recognizes the gun that killed Newman as Royce's old firearm. He leaves Royce alone and Royce goes in the hospital room, revealing himself to Sheridan as the mole who set him up just when Gerard walks in and questions Royce about killing Newman. Royce admits to being the mole, and to killing Newman since he witnessed Royce trying to kill Sheridan, then tells Gerard that he's doing the same thing with him, but Gerard is revealed to have emptied Royce's Glock beforehand. When Royce attempts to draw his backup firearm, Gerard shoots and kills him first.\n\nSheridan is publicly exonerated at a government hearing and makes peace with Gerard, who then gives his team a backhanded apology before they depart to honor Newman's memory.\n\n\nFilming locations for the film included, Metropolis, Illinois; Bay City, Illinois; Shawneetown, Illinois; Chicago, Illinois; New York, New York; Benton, Kentucky; and at Reelfoot Lake, in Lake County, Tennessee.\nThe original motion picture soundtrack for \"U.S. Marshals\" was released by the Varèse Sarabande music label on March 10, 1998. The score for the film was orchestrated by Jerry Goldsmith and mixed by Bruce Botnick. Kenneth Hall edited the film's music.\n\nAmong mainstream critics in the U.S., the film received mixed reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 26% based on reviews from 34 critics, with an average score of 5 out of 10. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average out of 100 to critics' reviews, \"U.S. Marshals\" was given a score of 47 based on 20 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale.\nBarbara Shulgasser, writing in \"The San Francisco Examiner\", commented in positive sentiment about the acting, saying, \"The film's pacing is unimpeachable and good performances are delivered by Jones, Snipes, Irene Jacob as Sheridan's loyal girlfriend and, for brief moments, Kate Nelligan as Gerard's tough but lovable boss.\" Left impressed, Desson Howe in \"The Washington Post\" noted how \"Every story beat is expertly planned and executed.\" Howe also praised director Baird, exclaiming how he \"runs the show with a smart eye and a metronome ticking somewhere in his mind.\" In a mixed to negative review, Russell Smith of \"The Austin Chronicle\" bluntly deduced that, \"Unlike Kimble, whose innocence and decency are known from the beginning in \"The Fugitive\", Sheridan is a total cipher to both Gerard and the audience until deep into this two-hours-plus film. Ergo, we can't be expected to give a rat's ass what happens to him — and don't.\" Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" opined that \"U.S. Marshals\" was \"Lean, tense, and satisfyingly tricky.\"\n\nThe film however, was not without its detractors. Writing for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", Roger Ebert, giving the film two and a half stars out of four, observed, \"I didn't expect \"U.S. Marshals\" to be the equal of \"The Fugitive\", and it isn't. But I hoped it would approach the taut tension of the 1993 film, and it doesn't. It has extra scenes, needless characters, an aimless plot and a solution that the hero seems to keep learning and then forgetting.\" In a primarily negative review, Mick LaSalle, writing for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", called the film \"a bad idea to begin with.\" He noted his confusion with the plot, remarking, \"the movie tells us from the beginning that the fugitive is not quite innocent. He killed two fellow agents in self-defense. All this does is muddy the moral waters, making us queasy about the one guy we like. At no point is there ever a compelling reason to keep watching.\" Describing a mild negative opinion, James Berardinelli of \"ReelViews\" professed Marshal Gerard as exhibiting \"only a token resemblance to the character who doggedly pursued Kimball in \"The Fugitive\". As re-invented here, Gerard is a generic action hero; most of the quirks that made him interesting (and that earned Jones an Oscar) are absent. With a few minor re-writes, John McClane from the \"Die Hard\" movies could have been plugged into this role.\"\nDissatisfied with the film's quality, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the \"Chicago Reader\" said that it was \"Not so much a sequel to \"The Fugitive\" as a lazy spin-off that imitates only what was boring and artificially frenetic about that earlier thriller; the little that kept it interesting—Tommy Lee Jones's Oscar-winning inflections, better-than-average direction—is nowhere in evidence.\" Stephen Hunter, writing for \"The Washington Post\", reasoned, \"It turns out to be one of those lame double-agent things where everybody's working for everybody else, the security of Taiwan (Taiwan!) is at stake, and it never quite lurches into clarity or acquires any real emotional punch. I didn't think the end of \"The Fugitive\" was so great either: Who wants to watch doctors fistfight on a roof? But by the time it winds down, \"U.S. Marshals\" has all but destroyed itself.\" Film critic Maitland McDonagh of \"TV Guide\" was not consumed with the nature of the subject matter, declaring, \"To every hit there is a season, and a time for every sequel under heaven — no matter what narrative contortions it takes.\" She later surmised, \"The minute Gerard mocks Royce's 'nickel-plated sissy pistol,' it's clear they're headed for a cathartic showdown, and anyone who can't see which member of Gerard's merry band might as well be wearing a 'Dead Meat Walking' T-shirt really shouldn't be allowed to operate complicated machinery.\"\n\n\"U.S. Marshals\" premiered in cinemas on March 6, 1998 in wide release throughout the United States. During that weekend, the film opened in 2nd place, grossing $16,863,988 at 2,817 locations. The film \"Titanic\" was in 1st place during that weekend, with $17,605,849 in revenue.

During its final week in release, \"U.S. Marshals\" was in 60th place, grossing a marginal $16,828 in revenue. \"U.S. Marshals\" went on to top out domestically at $57,167,405 in total ticket sales through its theatrical run. For 1998 as a whole, the film would cumulatively rank at a box office performance position of 36.\n\nFollowing its cinematic release, the Region 1 Code widescreen edition of the film was released on DVD in the U.S. on July 21, 1998.

The show was recorded at the San Francisco club The Purple Onion in June 2005.\n\nGalifianakis's routine features his trademark dry humor and a large portion of it is accompanied by a light piano piece played by him as bed music. It ends with him tearing off pages of a large pad of paper which contain pre-written, and largely self-deprecating, jokes, while the Pacific Boychoir sings \"The Greatest Love of All\". The DVD contains two separate sections which are cut to throughout the routine, often at times where the content of the routine may have to do with the content of the other portions. One of the sections is an unscripted roadtrip to The Purple Onion in a Volkswagen bus with Galifianakis and his friend Joe Wagner. The banter and happenings that occur seem to provide insights to where Galifianakis gets some of his comedy. The bus ends up breaking down just short of their goal so they finish the trip in a GoCar, a small rental vehicle meant for tourists. The second section is a loosely scripted interview of Galifianakis's brother \"Seth Galifianakis\" (played by Galifianakis) by Brian Unger.\n"}
