It was released on October 17, 2006 in the United States. The expansion pack was bundled with the full game of \"Age of Empires III\", called \"Age of Empires III Gold Edition\" on October 23, 2007. The Mac version was ported over, developed and published by Destineer's MacSoft. The full game for Mac was released on June 12, 2007 in the United States. It was followed by a second expansion pack to the original game called \"\".\n\nThere are no major changes to the mechanics to \"Age of Empires III\" - players are still expected to gather resources, build armies and send them to attack opponents. Instead, there are a number of new concepts introduced, whilst existing concepts have been expanded.\n\nWhile the Aztecs have a home city, the Iroquois and Sioux have five members of the Tribal Council: the Chief, the War Leader, the Shaman, the Wise Woman, and the Messenger. They all offer different units, supports, and improvements. The tribal council is present in the game when a native civilization advances in age (replacing the politician system of the European civilizations); the player can select to promote a candidate to the Tribal Council and this confers a bonus on the player. The candidates offer higher bonuses at later ages. Typically the type of bonus remains the same (extra units, bonus resources) and new candidates become available at higher home city levels.\n\nOther additions to the game include new minor native tribes: the expansion increases the original game's 12 tribes to 16. The Huron replaced the Iroquois, the Cheyenne replaced the Lakota (Sioux) and the Zapotec replaced the Aztec. Other new tribes include the Klamath, the Apache, the Navajo and the Mapuche.\n\nA Fire Pit is available to all Native civilizations. By tasking villagers dance at the Pit, a range of up to ten dances per civilization are available. The dances can be learned through Home City shipments are The Town Dance which improves building HP and attack, and the Water Dance which improves naval combat.\n\nThe Iroquois have the unique Founder Dance, which spawns new Travois, and the Earth Mother Dance, which increases maximum population. The Sioux have the Fire Dance, which increases unit damage to buildings and ships to mitigate their lack of siege weapons, and the War Song Dance, which produces free Dog Soldier cavalry. The Aztecs have the Healing Dance (all idle units automatically regenerate health) to compensate for the limit on Warrior Priests, and the Garland War Dance to spawn the free Skull Knights.\n\nAdditionally, each Native Civilization has its share of unique technologies. There is one unique technology per building except for the Sioux teepee, and the technologies' effects range from delivering shipments of resources or units to upgrading unit capabilities.\n\nEuropean colonies have a new option open to them in the Industrial age; instead of advancing to the Imperial age, they can revolt from the home nation and found their own country. The initial cost of revolting is cheaper than advancing to the Imperial age, but the nation's economy will stagnate because all settlers will turn into militia and no new ones can be built (except Coureur des Bois from a Cree Village). Resources can continue to be delivered from pre-constructed ships, tributed resources, trading posts, factories and for the Dutch, banks. A new nation may not upgrade units to the Imperial Age.\n\nAnother new feature is the use of stealth. This enables certain units to remain undetected by most enemy units and buildings. All native civilizations have a unit that can use stealth (this cannot be activated when enemy units are nearby). For the Europeans, there are spies that can be sent from the home city or recruited from the church. Spies are particularly effective against explorers and war chiefs due to their bonus attack. They all share the stealth ability, as do other miscellaneous units (ninja, native scouts, etc.). When certain enemy soldiers are near the invisible unit, the unit will be revealed and vulnerable to attack. Stealth units also become visible when they attack.\n\nThe campaign, which is 15 missions long, includes the Black family in a more historical setting. The first act, \"Fire\", follows Nathaniel Black (John Black's son and Amelia Black's father) as he spends the family's entire fortune supporting the American Revolution. The second act, \"Shadow\", follows Amelia Black's son, Chayton Black, and his actions in the Black Hills during Red Cloud's War and Great Sioux War. The home city for both acts is the Black Family Estate.\n\nNathaniel Black (loosely based on Joseph Louis Cook) is the half-Iroquois son of the late John Black from Act 2 in the previous game, raised by his mother Nonahkee and his uncle Kanyenke. The campaign opens as Nathaniel and Kanyenke are trying to discourage the Mohawk and the Seneca from fighting in the American Revolutionary War. However, they are ambushed by a group of Mohawks and head to an Oneida village nearby. From there they counter-attack and destroy an enemy Town Center, thus causing their enemies to flee. When Nathaniel and Kanyenke return to their village, they find that the Mohawk and a group of Hessian mercenaries led by Colonel Sven Kuechler, have raided the village and captured Nonahkee. They rescue Nonahkee, but Kuechler and his main army escape, leaving the Iroquois Confederacy to dissolve. Nathaniel's village supports the colonists, and Nathaniel heads to Boston where his men help defend a redoubt on Breed's Hill from the British. After George Washington takes command, a series of defeats drives the colonials back across the Delaware, where they are joined by Nathaniel. Here, Washington leads a small force, including Nathaniel, across the Delaware where they attack a Hessian encampment at Trenton and defeat the rearguard of the army at Princeton. This is followed by another victory at the Battles of Saratoga. However, the army is once again defeated at Brandywine and Germantown and is forced to camp for the winter at Valley Forge, where they suffer greatly from the cold. This leads Nathaniel to use most of his family's fortune to supply the army throughout the winter. The next scenario is the fictional battle of Morristown, where Nathaniel has his chance for revenge on Kuechler, who leads an attempt to destroy the capitol building of Morristown. Using artillery shipments he receives from Washington, Nathaniel sneaks around the Hessian flank and relieves Morristown. Refusing to accept defeat, Kuechler joins the fight with Nathaniel and is killed. After Kuechler's death, Nathaniel is said to have fought at Charleston, Camden, and King's Mountain. As the tide begins to turn, the French join the war and help the revolutionaries gain a victory at Yorktown, where Nathaniel is instrumental in capturing several redoubts. With the Revolution won, Nathaniel returns home a poor man having spent his family fortune on outfitting his volunteers and supplying the troops at Valley Forge. During the epilogue video of the campaign (where Nathaniel is at Yorktown), the \"Old Coot\" (secretly Morgan Black) from Acts 1 and 3 in the previous game can be seen watching his great-grandson's victory.\n\nIn 1866, Chayton Black, Amelia Black's half-Lakota son whose father died when he was too young to remember, is expanding the Falcon Railroad Company westward along the Bozeman Trail but winds up in the middle of Red Cloud's War. He helps defend the wood trail from the Sioux and becomes friends with Fort Laramie's quartermaster, William \"Billy\" Holme, an aged Civil War veteran. Ten years later, in 1876, Chayton returns to the west and again meets up with Holme, now a sheriff, who informs him of a huge amount of gold in the Black Hills of Dakota. After defending many mining camps from Sioux attacks, Chayton goes to see the Sioux chief Crazy Horse and establish a peace treaty. However, Holme and some of the miners ambush the Sioux before Chayton can begin negotiations, wrecking any chance of peace. Despite the sheriff's warmongering, Chayton still sides with Holme and defends his workers as they gather wood for a new fort. However, once the fort is complete, Holme orders Chayton to destroy a Sioux village without provocation. Chayton refuses and, turning against Holme, allies with the Sioux to destroy the fort, forcing Holme to flee into the hills. Chayton then convinces the newly arrived General Custer to give him one day to find Holme, who is the real cause of the unrest. Chayton puts on Sioux clothing and blood-red war paint and, joining with Crazy Horse, chases down Holme and confronts him in a mine. Chayton hopes to resolve the situation peacefully, but Holme pulls a gun on Chayton. However, Chayton draws his gun more quickly and shoots Holme, who falls down a mineshaft to his explosive death. Chayton then tries to convince General Custer not to attack the Sioux, but Custer refuses and demands that Chayton choose sides: the United States or the Natives, saying that he can no longer sit on the fence. Chayton agrees, bidding Custer goodbye and siding with the Sioux. He helps gather the Sioux and Cheyenne nations and fights with them at the Little Bighorn. After the battle, Amelia Black narrates that she never saw her son again, but she has heard that Chayton was either killed at Wounded Knee in 1890, taking a dozen cavalrymen with him, or lived out his days in the Black Hills with his wife and children.\n\n\"The WarChiefs\" expansion pack was bundled with \"Age of Empires III Complete Collection\", featuring the full game of \"Age of Empires III\", \"The WarChiefs\", and the second released expansion \"\", released on September 15, 2009, in the United States.\n\n\"Age of Empires III\", \"The WarChiefs\" and \"The Asian Dynasties\" have been ported to Mac OS X by MacSoft.\n\n\"The WarChiefs\" was a runner-up for \"Computer Games Magazine\"s 2006 \"Expansion of the Year\" award, which ultimately went to \"\".\n\n \n"}

She was one of the most popular actresses in Greece, and was given the title of the National Star of Greece. Theatrically she has mostly created renditions of widely known Broadway musicals as well as Greek tragedy plays. She died after fighting pancreatic cancer at the age of 62.\n\nVougiouklaki was born in Marousi. Daughter of Emmy Koumoundourou and Ioannis Vougiouklakis, who was the provincial governor of Arcadia in the Peloponnese during the war and was executed by the resistance organization ELAS as a collaborator. She had two brothers, Takis Vougiouklakis (film director) and Antonis (an architect).\n\nAs a student, she used to participate in school plays which eventually led her to an acting career. In 1952, she secretly auditioned for National Theatre of Greece, passed the exams and started attending the classes. She graduated 3 years later with \"Very Good\", after receiving \"Very Good\" by just one teacher of hers, when the rest of them gave her an \"Excellent.\"\n\nHer first theatrical role was in \"The Imaginary Invalid\", Molière, in 1953, while her first movie was in 1954, called The Little Mouse. She appeared in 42 movies, mostly musicals, television programs and theatre productions. She co-starred with Dimitris Papamichail in most of the movies and in a number of theatrical plays.\n\nShe received the prize for lead woman's role at the inaugural Greek Cinema Festival in Thessaloniki in 1960 for her starring role in Mantalena, while the movie Ipolochagos Natassa. (1970) is the biggest box office success in Greek Cinema. The following two also belong to her.\n\nIn 1961 she established her own theater company and presented successful theatrical plays. In 1962 she was contracted to star in Finos Films' English language film \"Aliki, My love\" (also known as \"Aliki\"). It premiered in London in June 1963, June 1963 in New York, and in Athens in 1964. It didn't receive the expected success. This failure to break it internationally was the reason she never again attempted an \"international movie star\" career.\n\nShe was popularly known in press as National Star of Greece - a term first coined by journalist Eleni Vlahou in 1959. Her last movie was \"Nelly, The Spy\" (Κατάσκοπος Νέλλη), in 1981. The decline of Greek Cinema lead her into concentrating on her theatrical career, establishing 53 plays. In 1975 she brought on stage large scale musicals, which changed the usual Greek style of theatrical musical.\n\nIn 2008, her son published a biography of Vougiouklaki, \"Eho Ena Mistiko\" (\"I Have A Secret\"), the title of a song she sang in <nowiki>\"</nowiki>Maidens' Cheeks. That same year, a television series was broadcast based on the book, aired on Alpha TV channel.\n\nVougiouklaki married her co-student in National Theater and co-player, Dimitris Papamichail, on January 18, 1965. On June 4, 1969, she gave birth to their child, Yiannis Papamichail. The couple got divorced in 1975, due to \"Irreconcilable Differences\". In 1992 in an interview with Nikos Hadjinikolaou, Vougiouklaki revealed that she secretly married Giorgos Iliadis, a Greek Cypriot businessman, on January 25, 1982, in Athens. They had met in 1976. The couple got a divorce only a couple of months later, due to Iliadi's personal reasons, which Vougiouklaki respected.\n\nIn April 1996, while on tour in Thessaloniki performing \"The Sound of Music\", Vougiouklaki had severe stomachaches, which she believed were caused by the antibiotics she took due to the bronchitis which had been bothering her. After performing tests at the Express Service, a medical diagnostic center in Thessaloniki, she was diagnosed with hepatoma, a malignant tumor in her liver. Not having realized the gravity of the situation, she continued performing for another week before the tour was finally canceled, with her last performance onstage being on April 28.\n\nIn Athens, a group of three professor doctors discovered that the actress had pancreatic cancer. On May 7, she traveled to Munich, where she underwent a series of additional tests during the three days she stayed there. On May 10, Vougiouklaki returned to Greece. On May 15, she made her last trip to Massachusetts General Hospital in the U.S. in a final effort to be cured. On May 19, she returned permanently to Athens and finally, on May 22 entered the Athens Medical Center. On July 14 she fell into hepatic coma and had no communication with those around her. After two months of hospitalization, Vougiouklaki died on July 23, 1996 at 10:15 in Athens Medical Center. Her funeral was held in Athens Cathedral on July 25, 1996 and she was buried in the First Cemetery of Athens.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40017556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40017556", "title": "Asmara Moerni", "text": "Asmara Moerni\n\nAsmara Moerni (; Perfected Spelling: Asmara Murni; Indonesian for \"True Love\") is a 1941 romance film from the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) directed by Rd Ariffien and produced by Ang Hock Liem for Union Films. Written by Saeroen, the film followed a doctor who falls in love with his maid, as well as her failed romance with a fellow villager. Starring Adnan Kapau Gani, Djoewariah, and S. Joesoef, the black-and-white film was cast and advertised to cater to the growing native intelligentsia. Despite mixed reviews, it was a commercial success. As with most films of the Indies, \"Asmara Moerni\" may be lost.\n\nAfter four years of doing his residency in Singkawang, Borneo, Dr. Pardi (Adnan Kapau Gani) returns to Java to open a practice. Before then, he goes to Cigading to visit his family and give them souvenirs. Upon arrival he is stunned to find that his family's maid Tati (Djoewariah), who had been his childhood playmate, is now a grown and beautiful woman. He secretly begins to fawn over Tati, although he does not tell her the reason. When Pardi's mother tells him he should marry quickly, he refuses all of her suggested brides. He says only that he already has someone in mind, aware that his mother would never approve an inter-class marriage with the maid.\n\nTati's fiancé, Amir (S. Joesoef), is jealous of all the attention that Tati is receiving, which leaves her no time for him. He plans to leave Cigading for the capital, Batavia (today Jakarta), where he will find work. Tati, upon learning this, joins him. She lives at her aunt's home in the city, making a living by washing clothes, while he finds lodging with a local man and learns to drive a \"becak\" (pedicab). Together they begin saving for their wedding. Unknown to them, Pardi has cut short his time in Cigading to move to Batavia, both to begin his new job and to find Tati.\n\nDays before the wedding, Amir is playing his flute when he is approached by a singer known as Miss Omi, who asks him to join her troupe on an international tour. Amir refuses, even after Omi hires him to drive her around the city in an attempt to convince him. After dropping Omi off, Amir is approached by a man who asks him to deliver a package; however, before he can deliver the package Amir is arrested and charged with smuggling opium.\n\nWhen Amir does not return, Tati and her aunt are worried: as Tati saw Amir with Omi, she fears that the two have run away together. Heartbroken, she intends to return to Cigading. When she and her aunt visit their boss, Abdul Sidik, they unknowingly pass PardiAbdul Sidik's doctor. Upon returning home, Pardi calls Abdul Sidik and asks him to take Tati in as if she were his daughter and educate her. Tati is a fast learner, and is soon comparable to any woman from a wealthy family.\n\nAfter being held eighteen months without trial, Amir is released and returned to Batavia. He is unable to find Tati, leaving him to wander the streets. Omi spots him, and again she asks him to play with her troupe. Amir agrees, and soon newspapers are filled with advertisements touting his name. Spotting one, Tati and Abdul Sidik go to a performance, only to learn that Amir was the victim of a car accident. At the hospital, where Amir is being treated by Pardi, Tati learns the truth behind Amir's absence. On his deathbed, Amir asks Pardi to take care of Tati; the two are later married.\n\n\"Asmara Moerni\" was directed by Rd Ariffien, a former journalist who had been active in the nationalist and labour movements before turning to theatre. He had joined Union Films – the company behind \"Asmara Moerni\" – in 1940, making his debut with \"Harta Berdarah\" (\"Bloody Treasure\"). Union's head Ang Hock Liem produced, while the story was written by journalist Saeroen, who had joined Union after commercial success on Albert Balink's \"Terang Boelan\" (\"Full Moon\", 1937) and with the production house Tan's Film.\n\nThe black-and-white film starred Adnan Kapau Gani, Djoewariah, and S. Joesoef. It was the feature film debut of Gani and Joesoef, while Djoewariah had been on Union's payroll since \"Bajar dengan Djiwa\" (\"Pay with Your Soul\") the preceding year.\n\nAt the time there was a growing movement to attract native intelligentsia, educated at schools run by the Dutch colonial government, and convince them to view domestic films, which were generally considered to be of much lower quality than imported Hollywood productions. This was blamed, in part, on the dominance of theatrically trained actors and crew. As such, Ariffien invited Gani, at the time a medical doctor and a prominent member of the nationalist movement, to join the cast. Although some nationalists considered Gani's involvement in \"Asmara Moerni\" as besmirching the independence movement, Gani considered it necessary: he believed audiences needed to have higher opinions of domestic film productions.\n\n\"Asmara Moerni\" was premiered on 29 April 1941 at Orion Theatre in Batavia; the crowds were mostly natives and ethnic Chinese. Rated for all ages, advertising for the film emphasised Gani's education and Joesoef's upper-class background. It was also advertised as breaking away from the conventional standards of stage theatre, such as music, which were omnipresent in the contemporary film industry. By August 1941 it was screened in Singapore, then part of the Straits Settlements, and billed as a \"modern Malay drama\". A novelisation was published later in 1941 by the Yogyakarta-based Kolff-Buning.\n\nThe film was a commercial success, though reviews were mixed. An anonymous review for the \"Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad\" found the film \"fascinating\", with good acting, though another review for the same paper found that, though the film was better than contemporary works such as \"Pantjawarna\" and \"Sorga Ka Toedjoe\", its claim to abandon stage standards was to be taken \"with a pinch of salt\". A review from the Surabaya-based \"Soerabaijasch Handelsblad\" found the film full of drama, describing it as \"Western motifs, played in the native environment, with a specifically Sundanese situation\".\n\nAfter \"Asmara Moerni\", Union produced a further three films; only one, \"Wanita dan Satria\", was by Rd Ariffien, who left the company soon after, as did Saeroen. Gani did not act in any further films, but instead returned to the nationalist movement. During the Indonesian National Revolution (1945–49) he became known as a smuggler, and after independence became a government minister. In November 2007 Gani was made a National Hero of Indonesia. Djoewariah continued to act until the 1950s, when she migrated to theatre after receiving a series of increasingly minor roles.\n\n\"Asmara Moerni\" was screened as late as November 1945. The film is likely lost. Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable nitrate film, and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. As such, American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider suggests that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's \"Katalog Film Indonesia\" (\"Indonesian Film Catalogue\") records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.\n\n"}

{"id": "1533841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1533841", "title": "Big Three television networks", "text": "Big Three television networks\n\nThe Big Three television networks are the three major traditional commercial broadcast television networks in the United States: the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), CBS (formerly known as the Columbia Broadcasting System) and the National Broadcasting Company (NBC). Beginning in 1948 until 1986, the Big Three networks dominated U.S. television.\n\nThe National Broadcasting Company and Columbia Broadcasting System were both founded as radio networks in the 1920s, with NBC eventually encompassing two national radio networks, the prestige Red Network and the lower-profile Blue Network. They gradually began experimental television stations in the 1930s, with commercial broadcasts being allowed by the Federal Communications Commission on July 1, 1941. In 1943, the U.S. government determined that NBC's two-network setup was anticompetitive and forced it to spin off one of the networks; NBC chose to sell the Blue Network operations, which became the American Broadcasting Company.\n\nAll three networks began regular, commercial television broadcasts in the 1940s. NBC and CBS began commercial operations in 1941, followed by the DuMont Television Network in 1944 and ABC in 1948. The three networks originally controlled only a few local television stations, but they swiftly affiliated with other stations to cover almost the entire United States by the late 1950s. Several of these stations affiliated with all three major networks and DuMont, or some combination of the four, in markets where only one or two television stations operated in the early years of commercial television; this resulted in several network shows, often those with lower national viewership, receiving scattershot market clearances, since in addition to maintaining limited broadcast schedules early on, affiliates that shoehorned programming from multiple networks had to also make room for locally produced content. As other stations signed on in larger cities, ABC, NBC, and CBS were eventually able to carry at least a sizeable portion of their programming on one station.\n\nOf the four original networks, only DuMont did not have a corresponding radio network. Conversely, the fourth major radio network of the era, the Mutual Broadcasting System, never attempted to enter television, although its component stations launched television outlets in their home cities, nor did it pursue any sort of affiliation with its television-only counterpart, DuMont. Some of Mutual's component stations bought a stake in the Overmyer Network in 1967, but other than a single late-night talk show, \"The Las Vegas Show\", which that lasted one month, that network never made it to its full launch.\n\nFor most of the history of television in the United States, the Big Three dominated, controlling the vast majority of television broadcasting. DuMont ceased regular programming in 1955; the NTA Film Network, unusual in that its programming, all pre-recorded, was distributed by mail instead of through communications wires, signed on in 1956 and lasted until 1961. From 1961, and lasting until the early 1990s, there were only three major networks. Every hit series appearing in the Nielsen top 20 television programs and every successful commercial network telecast of a major feature film was aired by one of the Big Three networks.\n\nThere were attempts by other companies, such as the Overmyer Network, to enter the television medium, but all of these ventures lasted only for brief periods. The prohibitive cost of starting a broadcast network, coupled with the difficulty of competing with the massive distribution of the Big Three networks, and the infancy and complexities of UHF broadcasting before cable television became commonplace in the 1980s, led to the downfall of almost all new network ventures; most media markets were limited to no more than three VHF channels, and even after the All-Channel Receiver Act was passed in 1961, the VHF stations were far more efficient and their signals could reach a greater range than their UHF counterparts. As the Big Three networks had already affiliated with most of the more desirable VHF stations, and the full-service approach of the time meant that the networks programmed almost the entire broadcast day, leaving little room for even off-prime-time programming, that left any upstart network to settle for the inferior UHF outlets. Those networks that could have had the resources to compete, such as Canada's CTV Television Network, which briefly attempted an American expansion via WNYB (channel 26 in Buffalo, New York, now a religious station), were forced off the air through legal threats.\n\nA viable fourth television network in the commercial sense would not again become competitive with the Big Three until Fox was founded in October 1986 from some of the assets and remnants of the DuMont network, which had become Metromedia after DuMont folded, and were acquired by News Corporation earlier in 1986. Fox, which began as a distant fourth network, leapfrogged into major network status in 1994 after must-carry rules took effect; the rules allowed Fox affiliates to force their way onto cable lineups, and the network's affiliation deal with New World Communications, which it later purchased in 1996, and the acquisition of National Football League broadcast rights brought a wave of new Fox affiliates.\n\nSince its founding, Fox has surpassed ABC and NBC in the ratings during the early primetime hours in which it competes against the longer established networks, becoming the second most-watched network behind CBS during the 2000s. During the 2007-08 season, Fox was the highest-rated of the major broadcast networks, as well as the first non-Big Three network to reach first place, but it lost the spot in the 2008-09 season and dropped to a close second. From 2004 to 2012, Fox also dominated U.S. television in the lucrative and viewer-rich 18-49 demographics, in large part due to the success of its NFL coverage and its top rated prime time program, \"American Idol\". Given the network's success in its prime time and sports offerings, it has been occasionally included with the Big Three, in which case the phrase \"Big Four\" is used.\n\nAlthough Fox has firmly established itself as the nation's fourth major network with its ratings success, it is not considered part of the Big Three. Among Fox's differences with the Big Three is its reduced weekday programming. It lacks national morning and evening news programs; Fox has a news division consisting of cable and radio operations, but does not provide content for the broadcast television network other than a weekly news analysis program, limited special breaking news reports and an affiliate news service for its stations called Fox News Edge. Fox does not feature any daytime programming, a third hour of primetime, late-night talk shows, and Saturday morning children's programming. Fox had an extensive lineup of children's programs throughout the 1990s called Fox Kids, but sold the division to The Walt Disney Company in 2001 as part of its sale of cable network Fox Family Channel, after which 4Kids Entertainment supplied the network's children's lineup until 2009.\n\nOutside prime time, Fox affiliates either produce their own programming or run syndicated shows. Fox is also the only one of the four major networks to include a regular block of infomercials on its lineup, via the Weekend Marketplace Saturday morning block.\n\nOther networks eventually launched in an attempt to not only compete with the Big Three as well as Fox, although these \"netlets\" have been unable to ascend to the same level of success. The WB and UPN launched in January 1995; like Fox, they both added nights of prime time programming over the course of a few years, although The WB was the only one that aired any on weekends, carrying a Sunday night lineup for all but its first half-season on the air.\n\nBoth networks mainly aired only prime time and children's programming. The latter was the only form of weekday daytime programming offered by either one, although UPN discontinued its children's lineup in 2003 at the conclusion of a content deal with Disney, and UPN aired sports programming via the short-lived XFL, as well as \"WWF SmackDown!\".\n\nWhile The WB and UPN each had a handful of popular series during their existences, they struggled for overall viewership and financial losses. This led their respective parent companies, CBS Corporation and Time Warner, to shut them down in September 2006 to jointly launch The CW, which initially featured a mix of programs from both predecessors as well as some newer shows.\n\nFox launched MyNetworkTV at the same time as The CW, with a lineup of English language telenovelas; it later shifted toward unscripted programs and movies, though its persistent lack of ratings success led News Corporation to convert it into a programming service, relying on a lineup of acquired series, in 2009.\n\nLikewise, the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), which has existed since 1970, is not considered part of the \"big three\" networks. PBS operates as a noncommercial service with a much different distribution model compared to the major networks; its member stations in essence own the network rather than the traditional mode of a network owning some of its stations and affiliating with additional stations owned by other broadcasters, and it maintains memberships with more than one educational station in a few markets. Prior to the 1990s, some commercial broadcast networks had affiliations with two stations in a few markets, with both stations carrying a share of the network's programming lineups.\n\nIn the 2010s, the \"Big Three\" control only a relatively small portion of the broadcasting market in the United States, which in 2005, was estimated at a combined 32%. The Big Three's market share has dwindled considerably as a result of growing competition from broadcast networks such as Fox, The CW and MyNetworkTV and more recently Spanish language networks such as Univision and Telemundo, as well as national cable and satellite channels such as TNT, ESPN and AMC, and Internet services such as Netflix.\n\nThe following is a list of television stations in the United States that have had primary network affiliations, at one point or another, all with ABC, CBS or NBC.\n"}
{"id": "118365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=118365", "title": "Black comedy", "text": "Black comedy\n\nBlack comedy, also known as dark comedy or gallows humor, is a comic style that makes light of subject matter that is generally considered taboo, particularly subjects that are normally considered serious or painful to discuss. Comedians often use it as a tool for exploring vulgar issues, thus provoking discomfort and serious thought as well as amusement in their audience. Popular themes of the genre include death and violence (murder, suicide, abuse, domestic violence, graphic violence, rape, torture, war, genocide, terrorism, corruption), discrimination (chauvinism, racism, sexism, homophobia), disease (anxiety, depression, nightmares, drug abuse, mutilation, disability, terminal illness, insanity), sexuality (sodomy, homosexuality, incest, infidelity, fornication), religion, and barbarism.\n\nBlack comedy differs from blue comedy which focuses more on crude topics such as nudity, sex, and bodily fluids. Although the two are interrelated, black comedy is also different from straightforward obscenity in that it is more subtle and does not necessarily have the explicit intention of offending people. In obscene humor, much of the humorous element comes from shock and revulsion, while black comedy might include an element of irony, or even fatalism. For example, an archetypal example of black comedy in the form of self-mutilation appears in the English novel \"Tristram Shandy\". Tristram, five years old at the time, starts to urinate out of an open window for lack of a chamber pot. The sash falls and circumcises him; his family reacts with both hysteria and philosophical acceptance.\n\nLiterary critics have associated black comedy and black humor with authors as early as the ancient Greeks with Aristophanes.\n\nWhereas the term \"black comedy\" is a relatively broad term covering humor relating to many serious subjects, \"gallows humor\" tends to be used more specifically in relation to death, or situations that are reminiscent of dying.\n\nThe black humor can occasionally be related to the grotesque genre.\n\nThe term \"black humor\" (from the French \"humour noir\") was coined by the Surrealist theorist André Breton in 1935 while interpreting the writings of Jonathan Swift. Breton's preference was to identify some of Swift's writings as a subgenre of comedy and satire in which laughter arises from cynicism and skepticism, often relying on topics such as death.\n\nBreton coined the term for his book \"Anthology of Black Humor\" (\"Anthologie de l'humour noir\"), in which he credited Jonathan Swift as the originator of black humor and gallows humor (particularly in his pieces \"Directions to Servants\" (1731), \"A Modest Proposal\" (1729), \"A Meditation Upon a Broom-Stick\" (1710), and in a few aphorisms). In his book, Breton also included excerpts from 45 other writers, including both examples in which the wit arises from a victim with which the audience empathizes, as is more typical in the tradition of gallows humor, and examples in which the comedy is used to mock the victim. In the last cases, the victim's suffering is trivialized, which leads to sympathizing with the victimizer, as analogously found in the social commentary and social criticism of the writings of (for instance) Sade.\n\nAmong the first American writers who employed black comedy in their works were Nathanael West and Vladimir Nabokov, although at the time the genre was not widely known in the US. The concept of black humor first came to nationwide attention after the publication of a 1965 mass-market paperback titled \"Black Humor\", of which the editor was Bruce Jay Friedman. The paperback was one of the first American anthologies devoted to the concept of black humor as a literary genre. With the paperback, Friedman labeled as \"black humorists\" a variety of authors, such as J.P. Donleavy, Edward Albee, Joseph Heller, Thomas Pynchon, John Barth, Vladimir Nabokov, Bruce Jay Friedman himself, and Louis-Ferdinand Celine. Among the writers labeled as black humorists by journalists and literary critics are today also Roald Dahl, Kurt Vonnegut, Warren Zevon, Christopher Durang, and Philip Roth. The motive for applying the label black humorist to all the writers cited above is that they have written novels, poems, stories, plays, and songs in which profound or horrific events were portrayed in a comic manner. Comedians, like Lenny Bruce, that since the late 1950s have been labeled for using \"sick comedy\" by mainstream journalists, have also been labeled with \"black comedy\".\n\nSigmund Freud in his 1927 essay \"Humour\" (\"Der Humor\") puts forth the following theory of black comedy: \"The ego refuses to be distressed by the provocations of reality, to let itself be compelled to suffer. It insists that it cannot be affected by the traumas of the external world; it shows, in fact, that such traumas are no more than occasions for it to gain pleasure.\" Some other sociologists elaborated this concept further. At the same time, Paul Lewis warns that this \"relieving\" aspect of gallows jokes depends on the context of the joke: whether the joke is being told by the threatened person themselves or by someone else.\n\nBlack comedy has the social effect of strengthening the morale of the oppressed and undermines the morale of the oppressors. According to Wylie Sypher, \"to be able to laugh at evil and error means we have surmounted them.\"\n\nBlack comedy is a natural human instinct and examples of it can be found in stories from antiquity. Its use was widespread in middle Europe, from where it was imported to the United States. It is rendered with the German expression \"Galgenhumor\". The concept of gallows humor is comparable to the French expression \"rire jaune\" (lit. \"yellow laughing\"), which also has a Germanic equivalent in the Belgian Dutch expression \"groen lachen\" (lit. \"green laughing\").\n\nItalian comedian Daniele Luttazzi discussed gallows humour focusing on the particular type of laughter that it arouses (\"risata verde\" or \"groen lachen\"), and said that grotesque satire, as opposed to ironic satire, is the one that most often arouses this kind of laughter. In the Weimar era \"Kabaretts\", this genre was particularly common, and according to Luttazzi, Karl Valentin and Karl Kraus were the major masters of it.\n\nThere are multiple recorded instances of humorous last words and final statements. For example, author and playwright Oscar Wilde was destitute and living in a cheap boarding house when he found himself on his deathbed. There are variations on what his exact words were, but his reputed were, \"Either that wallpaper goes or I do.\"\n\nExamples of gallows speeches include:\n\n\nMilitary life is full of gallows humor, as those in the services continuously live in the danger of being killed, especially in wartime. For example:\n\nWorkers in the emergency services are also known for using black comedy:\n\nThere are several titles \"It Only Hurts When I Laugh\" and \"Only When I Laugh\", which allude to the punch of a joke which exists in numerous versions since at least 19th century. A typical setup is that someone badly hurt (e.g., a Wild West rancher with an arrow in his chest, a Jew crucified by the Nazis, etc.) is asked \"Does it hurt?\" — \"A am fine; it only hurts when I laugh.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "638307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=638307", "title": "Cash for comment affair", "text": "Cash for comment affair\n\nThe cash for comment affair was an Australian scandal that broke in 1999, concerning paid advertising in radio that is presented to the audience in such a way as to sound like editorial commentary. John Laws, a shock jock radio presenter for Sydney talk back, was accused of misusing his authority as an announcer. This was widely considered a breach of journalistic integrity. While the initial publicity had died down by the end of the year, it sparked major changes in the way the radio industry is conducted in Australia. This resulted in a second scandal in 2004, leading to the resignation of Australian Broadcasting Authority head David Flint, after he had been found to have been less than impartial in his role in \"cash for comment\" investigations.\n\nSome have pointed to the \"Broadcasting Services Act (1992)\", which has treated the media more as a business than a cultural institution, for a decline in the relevance of ethical standards in the media industry.\n\nIn 1999, reporters Richard Ackland, Deborah Richards and Ann Connelly from the public broadcaster's \"Media Watch\" TV program revealed that 2UE talk radio hosts John Laws and Alan Jones had been paid to give favourable comment to companies including Qantas, Optus, Foxtel, Mirvac and major Australian banks, without disclosing this arrangement to listeners. Prior to giving favourable commentary to a group of banks, Laws had repeatedly criticised them for imposing unjustified fees on customers while cutting back on services.\n\nThough both initially vehemently denied any wrongdoing, when the controversy gained sufficient momentum, they defended the practice by claiming that they were not employed as journalists, but as \"entertainers\" and thus had no duty of disclosure or of journalistic integrity.\n\nThe Australian Broadcasting Authority estimated the value of these arrangements at $18 million and found Laws, Jones, and 2UE to have committed 90 breaches of the industry code and five breaches of 2UE's license conditions. The inquiry heard that Laws received cash and VIP hospitality at Sydney's Star City Casino for not discussing negative aspects of gambling.\n\nThe Australian Broadcasting Authority made it clear that Laws was not a journalist, but a radio personality and so journalists' ethical standards didn't apply to him. The inquiry focused on the extent to which deliberate commercial endorsement had led to distortions in which the public was misled about important matters. Regulations were subsequently tightened to prevent such behaviour; however, the ABA has been accused of weakness and inconsistency in enforcing these regulations. Included in the changes were new sponsor disclosure requirements. Laws used a cow bell to announce sponsor deals following more stringent disclosure requirements.\n\nIn 2004, Laws and Jones were again accused of cash for comment in relation to deals both had made with Telstra. Laws was found to have breached the rules but Jones was cleared; the revelation of flattering letters written by ABA head David Flint to Jones, at the same time that Jones was under investigation, led to accusations of impropriety that ultimately forced Flint's resignation.\n\n2UE was fined $360,000 for John Laws's improper conduct. Initially the radio station was to pay the Australian Communications and Media Authority A$10,000 for each of the 13 breaches involving a sponsor disclosure requirement. The Communications Law Centre intervened, arguing that a harsher penalty was appropriate. This led to the Federal Court imposing a larger fine.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3838569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3838569", "title": "Cox Models", "text": "Cox Models\n\nCox Models, a former division of Estes Industries of Penrose, Colorado, was a multimillion-dollar hobby company, is one of the hobby industry's oldest companies and is noted for its production of miniature model internal-combustion engines.\n\nThe company, originally named The L. M. Cox Manufacturing Co, Inc., was founded in 1945 by the machinist Roy Cox in Placentia, California. Cox grew up in and around his father's bicycle shop, and he developed an interest in mechanical devices. Cox's first products were wooden pop guns, produced in his home garage. Cox chose wood for his basic material, since metal was scarce during WW II.\n\nWhen metals became readily available in the United States in 1947, Cox turned his attention to new products, beginning with a diecast metal car. This product was developed into a \"whip car\", a tethered vehicle which could be manually swung in a circle at high speed. Nitro- and gasoline-powered tether cars with .60 cubic inch miniature engines capable of speeds of 100 mph (160 km/h) were quickly becoming popular. Cox's first contribution to that growing hobby was a cast aluminum midget racer powered by a .15 engine by Cameron Brothers.\n\nCox Manufacturing enjoyed a large postwar growth due in part to its production of miniature model internal combustion engines and control line model aircraft, finally moving to a new factory in Santa Ana, California, in 1963. The factory started at 80,000 square feet (7432 square meters). Three expansions in a few years' time saw expansion to 225,000 square feet (20,903 square meters) and introduction of a line of slot cars, model rockets, HO scale model trains, and a full-sized, one-horsepower gasoline-powered chain saw.\n\nRoy Cox retired in 1969, and he sold the company to the hobby conglomerate \"Leisure Dynamics\". Kites, toy walkie-talkies, and yo-yos were added to the Cox company products. A major step toward participation in the growing radio controlled hobby business happened in 1976 with the acquisition of the radio manufacturer \"Airtronics\". \n\nBy 1983, Leisure Dynamics was facing bankruptcy. Their engineer William Selzer, the designer of the \"Babe Bee\" .049 aircraft engine, joined with a local businessman to purchase the Cox company. The new company, Aeromil Engineering Company, changed the name of the company from Cox Company to Cox Hobbies, Incorporated, in 1984. Growth of the company continued, but its factory space became fragmented since the operations were spread out over a number of leased buildings. This prompted a move to a consolidated facility in Corona, California, in 1990. \n\nIn January 1996, a leading model toy rocket manufacturer, Estes Industries, purchased Cox Hobbies, Incorporated, and relocated operations from Southern California to the Estes facility in Penrose, Colorado. This signaled a major change in marketing direction for the new company, now known as Cox Models. A great many new products were aimed towards a mass market and they were sold in large chain stores and discount stores.\n\nIn February 2009 Estes Industries sold all of their remaining old classic Cox stock to several private buyers from the USA and Canada, one of them being a small privately owned company from Canada. In June 2009 they launched a website Cox International to sell their stock online and also via eBay. Some of the former Cox model train line is now sold by the Wm. K. Walthers company.\n\nIn January 2010 Estes-Cox Corporation was purchased by Hobbico based in Champaign, Illinois. These are the official owners of the former Cox name and logo and the Cox Models product line up consists of grand total of three basic Radio controlled electric trainer model airplanes. \n\nTo the present day Cox International continue to revive the original classic Cox brand of miniature aircraft engines as well as introducing new engine versions, reproduction parts, spare parts and accessories.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s until recently, Cox has produced a line of hobby-oriented models of cars, airplanes, and other vehicles. The most noted are the .049 cubic-inch displacement glow fuel powered models, controlled by line (Control Line) or by radio (Radio Control).\n\n\nCox reed valve engines are nearly indestructible. The needle valve and carburettor are behind the cylinder where they are protected, and the crank case, cylinder and fuel tank are all machined from forgings, rather than weaker castings. The tank back plate/carburettor is a zinc alloy casting, or later a plastic casting, but crash stresses are already well distributed by the time they reach it. The claim of dimensional tolerance, in the advertisement shown above, is justified by the facts that the high production volume engines need no break-in, except for a one-minute rich run, and any piston will fit into any cylinder that is the same size.\n\nAn example of an 0.049 cubic inch (0.8 cubic cm.) reed valve engine is shown on the right, taken apart (with the tools shown) and assembled. Except for the Golden Bee fuel tank, this engine was bought used in 1979. The starter spring has been removed, allowing the use of a left hand screw propeller. Some unneeded metal has been removed from the front of the crank case.\n\nBelow the Bee is a new Sure Start. There are several superficial changes, including that the shape of the reed is different and it is now made of steel. The most substantial change (not visible) is in the carburettor, which now has a large brass spray bar / barrier crossing the round barrel aperture, with a jet hole in its back center. The older carburettor has an abrupt increase in the diameter of the barrel (visible), with the jet at the top of the larger barrel section.\n\nIn addition to 0.049 cubic inch (0.80 cc) variants such as these, the 0.020 cubic inch (0.33 cc) Pee Wee was also sold, in large quantities and over several decades, in ready to fly or run models and separately to power other models.\n\nThe TDs (Tee Dee or Thimble Drome) had very high power for their size and ranged from 0.01 in³ (0.16 cc) to 0.09 in³ (1.5 cc) displacement. They were for serious hobbyists and too temperamental for mass markets.\nNote, on the Tee Dee shown, that light shows through the external ports, under the piston (sub induction). This engine cannot run properly with a muffler. Sub induction served to allow extra air into the cylinder at high engine speed. This increases the charge of mixture and makes the ignition timing track to engine speed to maintain power over a wider range of rpm. The cylinder head shown is of the low compression Bee type.\n\nMedallions were milder than the TDs but better performers than the reed valve engines.\n\n\nOn January 6, 2009, the Estes company closed down its Cox division and sold the engines, spare parts, and tooling to various companies.\n\n"}
{"id": "39474459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39474459", "title": "Digital Media Initiative", "text": "Digital Media Initiative\n\nThe Digital Media Initiative (DMI) was a British broadcast engineering project launched by the BBC in 2008. It aimed to modernise the Corporation's production and archiving methods by using connected digital production and media asset management systems. After a protracted development process lasting five years with a spend of £98 million between 2010 and 2012, the project was finally abandoned in May 2013.\n\nThe technology programme was initiated by the director of BBC Technology Ashley Highfield in 2008. It aimed to streamline broadcast operations by moving to a fully digital, tapeless production workflow at a cost of £81.7 million. Forecast to deliver cost savings to the BBC of around £18 million, DMI was contracted out to the technology services provider Siemens with consulting by Deloitte. Among the production features to be provided by DMI were a media ingest system; a media asset management system, unifying audio, video and stills archival; an online storyboarding system; and metadata storage and sharing. A core part of the system was formed by using Cinegy, a production suite originally developed prior to the DMI project by the BBC and selected by Siemens in 2008. The DMI Programme Director was television producer and entrepreneur Raymond P. Le Gué.\n\nCosts of the project rose after a number of technical problems and delays, and in 2009 the BBC terminated its contract with Siemens. BBC losses were estimated to be £38.2m, partially offset by a £27.5m settlement paid by Siemens, leaving a loss of £10.7m to the BBC. The BBC was criticised by the UK National Audit Office (NAO) in 2011 for its handling of the project. In evidence given to the NAO, the Director of the BBC's Future Media and Technology division, Erik Huggers, stated that Siemens had been selected to run the project without a tendering process because the BBC already had a 10-year support contract with the company. He also remarked that transfer of risk on the project to Siemens had resulted in a distant relationship with Siemens which made it hard to monitor project milestones and the completion of deliverables.\n\nAfter the termination of the Siemens contract, the DMI project was brought in-house by the BBC in 2009 and rebranded as \"Fabric\".\n\nIn 2012, it was reported that BBC staff who worked on a number of projects including DMI had suffered from severe stress and had been treated at The Priory.\n\nAccording to a report in \"The Guardian\", problems emerged in April 2013 during the coverage by BBC News of the death and funeral of Margaret Thatcher. News staff, attempting to source material on analog videotape from the BBC Archives, were unable to transfer footage to digital format due to the huge demand for limited transfer facilities at the newly refurbished New Broadcasting House in central London. Requested tapes were reportedly transported around London by taxi and via the Tube, and video transfer work was carried out by external production companies. A few weeks later it emerged that tape editing equipment might have to be installed at Broadcasting House in specially cooled areas.\n\nIn late May 2013 the Director-General of the BBC, Lord Hall, announced that the project was to be abandoned and that the BBC's chief technology officer, John Linwood, was to be suspended pending an external investigation into the management of the DMI project. It was subsequently revealed that a senior BBC manager had expressed grave doubts about DMI to the BBC Chairman Lord Patten one year before the project was cancelled. He had also claimed that there was a \"very significant risk\" that the National Audit Office had been misled about the actual progress of DMI in 2011. Other BBC executives had also voiced similar concerns for about two years before DMI was abandoned.\n\nThe NAO commenced an inquiry into the failure of the project and commissioned accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers to carry out an investigation. At a hearing held on 10 June 2013 at the BBC's MediaCityUK site in Salford, MPs Margaret Hodge and Stewart Jackson commented on evidence given by the then Director General Mark Thompson to the NAO in 2011 and to the BBC Trust, and took the view that he had misled the enquiry. BBC Trust member Anthony Fry remarked that the DMI had been a \"complete catastrophe\" and said that the project was \"probably the most serious, embarrassing thing I have ever seen.\"\n\nOn 24 January 2014, the BBC confirmed that the contract of former technology chief John Linwood had been terminated the previous July due to the failure of the Digital Media Initiative.\n\nOn 10 April 2014, the House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts presented the \"BBC Digital Media Initiative, Fifty-second Report of Session 2013–14\" in which it defines the project as a \"complete failure\" \n\n\n"}

It ran from 1989 to 2004. The first issue appeared soon after the end of Clowes's previous comic book, \"Lloyd Llewellyn\". \"Eightball\" has been among the best-selling series in alternative comics.\n\nEarly issues of \"Eightball\" feature a mixture of very short, often crudely humorous comics (\"Zubrick and Pogeybait\", \"The Sensual Santa\"), topical rants and satires (\"Art School Confidential\", \"On Sports\"), longer, more reflective self-contained stories (\"Caricature\", \"Immortal Invisible\"), and serialized works. The first extended story serialized in \"Eightball\" was \"Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron\", which ran in issues #1–10. \"Glove\" was followed by \"Ghost World\" (issues #11–18). Beginning with #19 each issue of \"Eightball\" has been devoted to a single storyline, as opposed to the more eclectic format of the earlier issues. Issues #19–21 serialized the graphic novel \"David Boring\", while issues #22 and 23 each consisted of a collection of short, fragmentary stories in diverse styles and formats that meshed into a unified narrative (\"Ice Haven\" and \"The Death Ray\"). The issues of \"Eightball\" beginning with #19 have been published in full color in a larger magazine-sized format. \"Eightball\" #18 included a bound-in copy of Clowes's pamphlet \"Modern Cartoonist\".\n\n\n\"Ghost World\" was adapted by Clowes and director Terry Zwigoff into a 2001 feature film of the same name, for which Clowes and Zwigoff were nominated for an Academy Award for screenplay writing. Additionally, the 2006 Clowes/Zwigoff film \"Art School Confidential\" was loosely based on a short story of the same name which appeared in \"Eightball\" #7. \n\nThe comic generated controversy when a high school teacher in Guilford, Connecticut gave \"Eightball\" #22 (\"Ice Haven\") to a student as a make-up summer reading assignment. The parents of the student had concerns about the book's appropriateness. The superintendent of Guilford High School said the book was inappropriate for 13-year-olds and placed the teacher on leave. The teacher resigned before the matter was fully investigated. The Guilford school district and principal were criticized for getting police involved and trying the issue in a \"kangaroo court\".\n\n"}

In 2004, Peru declared this song as part of the national cultural heritage. This song is now considered the second national anthem of Peru.\n\nIt is the best-known Peruvian song in the English-speaking world due to a 1970 cover by Simon & Garfunkel on their \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" album. Their version is called \"El Cóndor Pasa (If I Could)\".\n\nIn 1913, Peruvian songwriter Daniel Alomía Robles composed \"El Cóndor Pasa\", and the song was first performed publicly at the Teatro Mazzi in Lima. The song was originally a musical piece in the Peruvian zarzuela (musical play), \"El cóndor pasa\".\n\nIts music was composed by Daniel Alomía Robles in 1913 and its script was written by Julio de La Paz (pseudonym of the Limenian dramatist Julio Baudouin). The piano arrangement of this play's most famous melody was legally registered on May 3, 1933 by The Edward B. Marks Music Corp. in the Library of Congress, under the number 9643. The zarzuela is written in prose and consists of one musical play and two acts.\n\nIn July 2013, the Colectivo Cultural Centenario El Cóndor Pasa cultural association re-edited the original script which had been lost for a period of time, and published it together with a CD containing the recorded dialogues and seven musical pieces. The music from the original score was reconstructed by musicologist Luis Salazar Mejía with the collaboration of musicians Daniel Dorival and Claude Ferrier and the support of cultural promoter Mario Cerrón Fetta, and re-released on November 14, 15, and 16, 2013 at the Teatro UNI in Lima to celebrate its first centenary. The zarzuela included the famous homonymous melody, without lyrics, based on the traditional Andean music of Peru, where it was declared a National Cultural Heritage in 2004.\n\nIn 1965, the American musician Paul Simon heard for the first time a version of the melody by the band Los Incas in a performance at the \"Théâtre de l'Est parisien\" in Paris in which both were participating. Simon became friendly with Los Incas band, later even touring with them and producing their first US-American album. He asked the band for permission to use the song in his production. The band's director and founding member Jorge Milchberg, who was collecting royalties for the song as co-author and arranger, responded erroneously that it was a traditional Peruvian composition. Milchberg told Simon he was registered as the arrangement's co-author and collected royalties.\n\nIn 1970, the Simon & Garfunkel duo covered the Los Incas version, adding some English lyrics which in turn added Paul Simon to the author credits under the song name \"El Cóndor Pasa (If I Could)\". The instrumental version by Los Incas was used as the base track. They included the song on the 1970 album \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\". Simon & Garfunkel released their version as a single in the U.S., which reached #18 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart and #6 on the Easy Listening chart, in fall 1970. This cover achieved major international success and fame.\n\nIn regard to the Simon & Garfunkel version, Daniel Alomía Robles, Jorge Milchberg, and Paul Simon are now all listed as songwriters, with Simon listed alone as the author of the English lyrics. However, Daniel Alomía Robles was not originally listed as the composer because Jorge Milchberg had told Simon that the song was considered an Andean folk melody. He further stated that he was the registered co-author and arranger of the composition.\n\nIn late 1970, Daniel Alomía Robles' son Armando Robles Godoy, a Peruvian filmmaker, filed a successful copyright lawsuit against Paul Simon. The grounds for the lawsuit extended that the song had been composed by his father, who had copyrighted the song in the United States in 1933. Armando Robles Godoy said that he held no ill will towards Paul Simon for what he considered a \"misunderstanding\" and an \"honest mistake\".\n\n\"It was an almost friendly court case because Paul Simon was very respectful of other cultures. It was not carelessness on his part,\" said Armando Robles Godoy. \"He happened to hear the song in Paris from a vernacular group Los Incas. He liked it, he went to ask the band for permission and they gave him the wrong information. Jorge Milchberg told him it was a traditional folk song from the 18th century and not my father's composition. It was a court case without further complications.\"\n\nLater that year, Perry Como released a cover of Paul Simon's English version on his album \"It's Impossible\", while Julie Felix had a UK Top 20 hit with it, taking advantage of Simon & Garfunkel's decision not to release their version as a UK single.\n\nArmando Robles Godoy subsequently wrote new Spanish lyrics for the song, taking Paul Simon's version as a reference.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was one of the main competitors to Mamod for models of stationary steam engines.\n\nThe company used two trading names:\n\n\nIn 1978 the company was bought by Letraset for 12.5 million pounds. \n\nThe company no longer exists but some of the products, especially the steam engines have become collectors' items.\n\nThe company made a wide range of toys under both brand names. The catalogue contained hundreds of items at their peak. Nowadays, they are best known for the SEL range, especially the steam engines, dynamotor and student's microscopes.\n\nThe steam engine range consisted of four stationary engines, and a steam engine unit for model boats. The stationary engines were the Minor, Junior, Standard and Major. The major could also be bought complete with a set of miniature workshop tools.\nWhen the steam engine line was brought to an end in 1965, remaining stocks of the model boat engine were bought up by Mamod and used for their ME3 \"marine engine\".\n\nThe SEL \"Dynamotor\" was a simple two-pole, permanent magnet, machine which could be run as a motor (using 4-6 volts from a dry battery) or used as a dynamo. There were also four low voltage motors described in the catalogue just as motors. Three of these were ac/dc so could not be used as dynamos but the fourth was a dc only permanent magnet type which could have been used as a dynamo. There was also a range of mains voltage ac/dc motors which could not, by any means, be considered toys.\n\nThere were several models of microscope, all similar in design but differing in size. They were simple but well made instruments with sturdy cast alloy frames. They were supplied in a wooden or cardboard box complete with several glass slides, tweezers and instruction leaflet.\n"}
{"id": "24616245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24616245", "title": "Jachigi", "text": "Jachigi\n\nJachigi(자치기) is a South Korean game where a long stick and two short sticks is hit and caught. First, a circular hole is dug on the ground, and a circle is drawn on the outside. After placing a short stick around the outside of the hole, it is hit with the long stick, and the rebounding stick (the short one that was just hit), is hit again with the long stick in mid-air, sending it flying far away.\n\nJachigi or ja chigi is said to have originated from the game called \"gyeokgu\", a popular sport in ancient Goryeo used for military purposes. It involved two teams holding sticks, which were used to shoot a ball in between two goal posts set up in the middle of a \"gyeokgu\" field. The game resembled the modern-day field hockey sport especially as it was also played on horseback. It was, however, included in the military service examination and training in the Joseon period. The advent of modern warfare, particularly after Joseon's war with Japan, made the \"gyeokgu\" irrelevant in armed combat and from then on, it transformed into simpler forms and spread across Korea as popular children's games. It was the basis of the shuttlecock-kicking game and the jachigi. The jachigi game denotes measuring with a stick and hitting. \"Ja\" means wooden stick, while \"chigi\" means measuring distance. To play effectively, the stick should be about 30 centimeters long and the shorter stick must be 7 centimeters.\n\nThe rules are to first divide two or more people into two teams, either the offensive area or the defensive area. The offensive side hits the stick and lets it fly; if the opposing team catches it, the offense and the defense switch sides. If there were only two people playing, the player who hit the stick would lose. In the case that it could not be caught, the opposing team picks up the short stick, and throws it toward the hole. Then, the offensive person hits it back. Where the short stick fell, they measure with the long stick. Right then, the long stick becomes one ruler. The name Jachigi is used because of the use of the long stick as a ruler to determine the winner. The longer the distance measured, the higher the score.\n"}

The film is the third in the \"Kickboxer\" franchise with only Sasha Mitchell and Dennis Chan returning from the previous films. It was also the last film to feature Dennis Chan as Xian Chow and first entry into the series to be released direct-to-video.\n\nThe movie opens with a distressed woman being chased through a tropical forest by an unknown pursuer. It is soon revealed that the woman is attempting to escape from Frank Lane, an American running an illegal child sex ring operation in Brazil. Upon being recaptured, she is taken back to Lane's home and executed in front of the other slaves, as punishment for her actions.\n\nMeanwhile, kickboxing champion David Sloane and his trainer Xian arrive in Rio de Janeiro for a championship bout. Though Xian is mostly interested in training for the upcoming fight, Sloane dismisses the idea in favor of relaxing in the city. While eating lunch, their camera is suddenly stolen by a young thief, and Sloane immediately gives chase. After fending off a pair of drunken assailants, he catches up to the boy who then brandishes a knife, but Sloane easily disarms him and takes back the camera. When the boy, Marcos, follows him back to the restaurant to reclaim the knife, Xian invites both him and his beautiful sister Isabella to join them for lunch, and they eventually become friends.\n\nAt a charity kickboxing event, Sloane is asked to be the cornerman for another young fighter in an exhibition match against Eric Martine, an Argentine kickboxer managed by Lane, who also happens to be Sloane's opponent for the upcoming championship fight. However, an aggressive Martine brutally beats the young fighter, prompting Sloane to physically intervene on his behalf. As a result, Sloane's bout with Martine is billed as a grudge match. Lane apologizes to Sloane for Martine's actions and invites him to a party he is hosting.\n\nSloane attends the party with Marcos and Isabella as his personal guests. Upon meeting her, Lane becomes infatuated with Isabella. When Sloane parts ways with the children for the night, Lane secretly sends out a group of men to kidnap her. In a panic, Marcos asks for Sloane's help and they file a police report, but with an overwhelming backlog of unsolved cases on their hands, the authorities do not consider their case a priority and advise them to simply forget about Isabella.\n\nUndeterred, Sloane and Xian launch their own investigation, which ultimately leads to their arrest. Although Lane bails them out in an attempt to cover his tracks, the two continue their search, only to find that the trail leads right back to him. They confront Lane in his home, but are ambushed and taken prisoner. Lane forces Sloane through a series of grueling exercises designed to weaken him before his match with Martine, such as hiking with a backpack full of rocks and water-skiing without skis. He then releases both men back to their hotel, with the condition that if Sloane doesn't show up for the fight, Isabella will disappear forever. With Marcos's help, Xian is able to create and administer a cure for Sloane's fatigue.\n\nAt the fight, Sloane manages to defeat Martine, and Xian is successful in rescuing Isabella before Lane can flee the arena leaving Lane bankrupt. Upon being reunited with Marcos, Isabella tells him about the other girls Lane has imprisoned, and Sloane resolves to free them as well. In retaliation, Lane pulls a gun on Sloane intending to shoot him, but Marcos suddenly appears and stabs Lane in the stomach with his knife.\n\nIn the end, the police sergeant decides to cover up Lane's murder, and Sloane arranges for Marcos and Isabella to attend school. Upon realizing that they have missed their flight back home, Sloane, Xian, and the police sergeant decide to go out for drinks together.\n\nIn an interview with Sam Weisberg for the web site Hidden Films, director Rick King said working with Sasha Mitchell was extremely difficult, with frequent temper tantrums and even threats of violence. “I think he thought people thought he was stupid, which was true,” King [said]. “And he was also violent, and so he used his position of privilege as the star in a very negative way.” \n\n\nThe film was not well received by critics.\n\n"}

It was licensed by Triumph International, developed by and published by Ubisoft, and was released on November 23, 2010 in North America, November 25, 2010 in Australia and November 26, 2010 in Europe for the Nintendo DS, PlayStation Portable and Wii. It was also released on April 12, 2011 in North America, April 14, 2011 in Australia, April 15, 2011 in Europe and December 8, 2011 in Japan for PlayStation 3's PlayStation Move and Xbox 360's Kinect. The game features many of Michael Jackson's hits, such as \"Bad\", \"Thriller\", \"Beat It\", \"Billie Jean\", \"Smooth Criminal\", \"Black or White\", \"The Way You Make Me Feel\", etc. Initial launches of the game included a limited edition replica of Jackson's sequined glove. It was later released for the Nintendo 3DS, iOS and PlayStation Vita. It was announced that the game would be released on Mac OS X, Wii U and iPad 2. \nThe game sold 2 million units in two months, not including Japanese sales, making it one of the best-selling Wii title games.\n\nThe Wii, PS3, and Kinect versions of the game feature Just Dance style gameplay. There are three modes of play in both the Wii and PS3 version of the game. The first is \"Classic\" where everybody follows the on-screen Michael Jackson avatar. The second is \"Duo\" which is used for duets (such as \"The Girl Is Mine\") or videos with two main characters (such as \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" and \"In the Closet\") The player(s) can choose to dance as either Michael or the other character. The third mode of gameplay is \"Crew\", which features Michael and two backup dancers (five during some songs.) Players can opt to dance as any of the three. After performing songs, players are able to unlock training videos in the \"Dance School\" where they are taught some of the more difficult moves from several of Michael Jackson's music videos and stage performances.\n\nFour player multiplayer is available on the Wii and Move enabled PlayStation 3 but the Kinect will be limited to one player at a time. The game also features singing on the Kinect version on Xbox 360, and optional on-screen lyrics on the PlayStation 3 and Wii versions which also feature singing. The DS version features gameplay similar to Elite Beat Agents. In this version, there is a cartoon version of Michael on the top screen and the player follows along by tapping the bottom screen with the stylus to the rhythm of the music. Also on Nintendo DS version, there is an anti-piracy feature created by Ubisoft that will freeze the game and replace the audio with the sound of vuvuzelas (popularized by the South Africans in World Cup 2010) if the player is playing a pirated or ROM version of the game. On the Wii version, players can play as Jackson or the Back-up Dancers. The game was displayed at New York Comic Con at Ubisoft's booth.\n\nThe Kinect version of the game features full body tracking, and entirely different choreography to the Wii version, along with several other changes and additions. This version uses a technology called Player Projection, which puts the player's own image in the game allowing them to star in their own Michael Jackson video. The Kinect version includes two game modes: \"Solo\" and \"Party\". Solo mode features one player. Party mode features 2-4 players. There are two options in Party mode: \"Co-Op\" and \"Battle\". Co-Op mode is a \"every player for themselves\" mode as players take turns jumping in and jumping out in order to complete the song. Battle mode is a team mode where two teams face off to get the highest score. Battle mode is a little different from Co-Op mode as each team performs the song together and the song gets broken down into two parts in which one player dances and the other player sings. Party mode only features Dance Mode, Performance Mode and Master Performance Mode. There are four symbols to represent each player: Michael's glove, Michael's hat, Michael's shades and one of Michael's jackets. Several of the songs in the game do not feature any moves to perform, instead becoming \"Singing Only\" songs, with \"Earth Song\" being the first song confirmed as Singing Only. There are certain songs that have moves that can be taught in a practice mode called \"MJ School\". During each performance, a crown pops up above the player's head and the player must hit the crown to activate \"King Power\" before it fades away. The crown, appearing only once per song, will multiply the score by 8. Similar to the Wii version, the player is scored on how well they sing and dance. The player can get five different grades: \"Perfect\", \"Good\" and \"OK\" increases the player's score, while \"Almost\" and \"Miss\" make causes the player to lose their current score. Points add up at the end of each song along with the rating of stars the player receives and a photo the player takes during their performance. Players can either use the Kinect's built-in microphone or an attached mic/headset to sing. The game does include the option, however, to choose a \"Dance Only\" version of the song, which means the player will not be asked to sing. The Kinect version also features a mode known as Master Performance, which requires the player to both sing and dance to a set of choreographed moves that are harder than the normal moves, and \"as close as possible to the videos\".\n\nIn addition to the singing and dancing functionalities found in the Xbox 360 version, the PlayStation 3 version allows the player to sing or dance at the same time as other players. There is also the option to record the video clips or take pictures of the player's performance, and allows the player to save or upload them to sites, such as Facebook. The PlayStation Vita version was ported with Improved graphics in HD, Multiplayer (AD-Hoc), Trophy Support, Motion Sensor support, Multi-touch support, and instead of taking off the On-screen notes, it was replaced with the ability to use the Rear touch pad for an even harder challenge and since its use the multi-touch, the difficulty has been given an upgrade to increase the challenge. The PS Vita version, compared to the 3DS version, has been given a whole new look in graphics and on resolution, with the player being able to use their finger instead of a 3DS stylus. The Vita version doesn't have any downloadable content.\n\n\nIn the Wii console version of the game, \"Money\" is incorrectly credited as a song from the album \"\" which was released in 1997.

The reviews for the DS and PSP versions were above average, with a slightly better score for the DS version. IGN gave a 6.5/10 for DS and 5.5/10 for the PSP. Destructoid gave a 6/10 for the DS version.\n\nIGN gave the Wii version a 3.5 saying that it does not give clear instructions on how to dance and also criticized the controls. Metro gave it 5/10, describing it as \"perfectly good party fun if you don’t care that the controls don't work.\" The game received positive reviews from tabloids that had previously been anti-Jackson. Videogamer.com gave the review a 7/10, stating that the music overplays the responsiveness difficulty. CNET gave the game 5/5, writing that the game is \"extremely easy to pick up and play\" and \"the choreography is amazing\" The Escapist gave the game 4/5, noting that the game \"is not meant to be played by yourself.\"\n\nEurogamer thought that the Xbox dance routines \"feel a little slower and more simplistic than those in the PS3 game\", while the Daily Star said that \"the Move seems a touch more sensitive\".\n\n"}

{"id": "3391147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3391147", "title": "Piers Plowman tradition", "text": "Piers Plowman tradition\n\nThe Piers Plowman tradition is made up of about 14 different poetic and prose works from about the time of John Ball (died 1381) and the Peasants Revolt of 1381 through the reign of Elizabeth I and beyond. All the works feature one or more characters, typically Piers, from William Langland's poem \"Piers Plowman\". (A much larger number of texts, with less obvious connection to Piers Plowman, may also be considered part of the tradition.) Because the Plowman appears in the \"General Prologue\" to \"The Canterbury Tales\" by Geoffrey Chaucer but does not have his own tale (one of seven such characters), plowman tales are sometimes used as additions to \"The Canterbury Tales\", or otherwise conflated or associated with Chaucer.\n\nAs a rule, they satirically reflect economic, social, political, and religious grievances, and are concerned with political decisions and the relation between commoners and king. In these respects they resemble works such as \"Poem on the Evil Times of Edward II\" (1321–27), \"The Song of the Husbandman\" (c. 1340), \"Wynnere and Wastoure\" (c. 1353), and \"The Parlement of the Three Ages\" (c. 1375-1400). The Piers Plowman tradition therefore contributed to an emerging early modern \"public sphere\". Most of the works of the tradition are anonymous; many are pseudepigraphic by authorial design or later misattribution. The distinction between fiction and history in them is often blurred.\n\nAlong with the writings of John Ball, the earliest contributions to the Piers Plowman tradition are extensively associated with the Lollards:\n\nLess directly and self-consciously evocative of \"Piers Plowman\" are:\n\nMany of the previously mentioned plowman texts, which first circulated in manuscript, reappeared later in print, often with some degree of intentional alteration and editorializing that aimed at construing them as proto-Protestant . This is true also of the first printed editions of \"Piers Plowman\" in 1550 and 1561 by Robert Crowley and Owen Rogers. William Tyndale may have (and was thought by some contemporaries) to have supplied the preface to the printed edition of the \"Praier and Complaynte\", which aroused the critical pen of Thomas More. John Foxe did his part to canonize the same text in four editions of his famous \"Actes and Monuments\" from 1570 to 1610. Like \"Jack Upland\", \"The Plowman's Tale\" became associated with Geoffrey Chaucer and was added by various editors to four editions of Chaucer's collected works between 1542 and 1602. \"I Playne Piers which Cannot Flatter\", a mixture of parts of \"The Plowman's Tale\" and new material added some time after 1540, was printed in 1550 and ascribed to the author of \"Piers Plowman\" who was then unknown or identified as either Chaucer, John Wycliffe, or Robert Langland. \"I Playne Piers\" was reprinted by the Puritan Martinist writers in the Martin Marprelate Controversy in 1589. It was then retitled, \"O read me, for I am of great antiquitie . . . I am the Gransier of Martin Mare-prelitte\".\n\nThere were also many new texts produced in the sixteenth century that may be considered parts of the Piers Plowman tradition, such as Edmund Spenser's \"The Shepheardes Calendar\" which makes use of a character named \"Piers\" and consciously borrows lines from \"The Plowman's Tale\". Spenser's character, Colin Clout, who appears in two of his poems, is also a Piers-like figure derived from John Skelton. John Bale regarded Skelton as a \"vates pierius\" - poetic prophet, with \"pierius\" perhaps alluding to Piers, the pre-eminent English prophet-poet. Bale was pleased with Skelton's attacks on the clergy and his open breach of clerical celibacy. \"Colin Clout\" (1521) is one of Skelton's anti-Wolsey satires where the title character, a vagabond, complains about corrupt churchmen.\n\nSixteenth-century texts that refer to the poem \"Piers Plowman\" or the character \"Piers Plowman\" include:\n\nLess directly associated with Piers are:\nThence she thee brought into this faerie Lond,\n\nLike Thomas More and Robert Crowley, Bishop Hugh Latimer valued \"commune wealth\" more than \"private commodity.\" He was an outspoken critic of enclosure, the abuses of landlords, and the aristocrats who lined their pockets through the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Like Crowley, Latimer was able to be especially outspoken when Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset had controlling influence in the court as Lord Protector of England during part of the minority of Edward VI. A famous sermon of Latimer's that represented preachers as God's plowmen, \"The Sermon of the Plowers,\" was delivered at St. Paul's Cross, 18 January 1548 and was printed that year by John Day. This was the last of four \"Sermons on the Plough;\" unfortunately the first three are lost. While Latimer's message is spiritual, it has a sharp political edge that also acknowledges the material concerns of people affected by enclosure. Latimer attacks idle clergy as \"plowmen\" who cause a spiritual famine, and enclosure is used as a metaphor for hindrances to proper preaching. The devil is called the busiest bishop and greatest plowman in England; he is seeding the land with the ritual and ornamental trappings of popery. Latimer himself, through the style of his sermons, typifies the plain, homely and direct speech of Piers and popular Protestantism. Anthony Anderson's \"The Shield of our Safetie\" (1581) uses Latimer's figure of the pastor as a plowman but is unwilling to ascribe special virtue to the commons and rural laborers. Godliness is lacking \"from top to toe\" in England, \"from the Nobilitie, to the Plowman and his mate.\" George Gifford's \"A Briefe Discourse of Certaine Points of the Religion which is among the Common Sort of Christians\" (1583) asserts that \"it is not for plowmen to meddle with scriptures.\"\n\nThe early modern dissemination and reception of \"Visio Willelmi de Petro Ploughman\" (\"William's Vision of Piers Plowman\") from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century reveals a great deal about changes in English society and politics. Clearly orthodox Roman Catholic in doctrine but reformist in that it posed social criticism and advocated moral, economic, and political change, the original poem(s)--and the figure of Piers in the popular imagination--were often viewed quite differently.\n\n\"Piers\" was open to being appropriated by Lollards and later Protestant reformers. William Tyndale's memorable statement to a \"popish priest,\" recorded in John Foxe' \"Acts and Monuments\", is an echo of Erasmus' \"Paraclesis\", which also resonated with popular images of the pious plowman: \"If God spare my life ere many years, I will cause a boy that driveth the plow shall know more of the scripture than thou dost.\" After nearly two centuries, the plowman tradition of social complaint and satire became more worldly-wise and less ardently idealistic. It became, increasingly, a secular vehicle for complaining about class rivalries and political dissent--and also for containing or restraining such things. What is notable about the Piers/plowman literature of the Elizabethan era is the general absence of the old religious radical who speaks the plain truth for the poor, godly commons against corrupt elites and hypocritical English clergy. In many cases the name of Piers remained, but his vocation was altered; with few exceptions, he was no longer specifically a religious reformer. Criticism of the wealthy and powerful continued, but rather than directly addressing complaints to them and to the mnonarch and parliament as Edwardians like Crowley, Latimer and Thomas Lever had done, they became the subject of comic, often satiric, popular entertainment. Plays and pamphlets became the vehicle of social analysis, concerned with class identities and rivalries that were rendered with greater complexity and detail than in found in the earlier literature.\n\nAfter the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, the Piers tradition changed, particularly after censorship laws put into effect in 1551, 1553, and 1559, officially banned discussion of religious matters or matters of state. Other causes were also at work. With the division and collapse of Christendom in the Reformation, the medieval conception of the social hierarchy, as well as Purgatory and Hell, so central to Langland's poem, were vestigial remnants of a passing order. In the Elizabethan era, Piers' Christological aspect became fully detached from his role as the universal commoner, a secular economic man among economic men with clashing interests. At the same time, there was a bifurcation of the original carnivalesque world of Langland's Piers that had common, aristocratic, and divine characters. The moral and apocalyptic aspects of \"Piers\" flourished briefly at mid-century but then dissipated along with the idealism of the Edwardian reformers and their vision of a united commonwealth of interdependent estates. Popular literature evoking Piers by name or in spirit began to construe elites as people with whom one may compete and win. Langland's \"fair field of folk\" became a socioeconomic playing field on which elites are perhaps no less important to the nation than the common people. In this way Langland's Piers and Piers-like figures helped establish an English national identity based on and for the popular rather than the elite culture. This popular self-understanding seems to have flourished especially in the nonconformist Puritan mind where it could be radicalized. In other cases, it could be a basis for statist nationalism\n\nAccording to the Privy Council, military conscription, which was at a high in the late sixteenth century, gave \"great ease and good to the country to be ridd of those kinde of people whoe otherwyse wil be a burthen to the country.\" Such attempts to channel and appropriate the power of the commoners did not escape their notice. In \"Pierce Pennilesse\", Thomas Nashe wrote, \"If they have no service abroad, they will make mutinies at home...\" Popular awareness of such strategies to channel the power of the commons toward royal interests did not generate resistance, but offered a chance for the commons to insert their own interests into the transaction. Perhaps this is why in the Elizabethan era, Piers and Piers-like figures began to appear as itinerant laborers and tradesmen: tinkers, coblers and shoemakers who claimed to represent true Englishness over against effete, pretentious elites. While affirming their loyalty, these humble figures labored to define an English identity from below that was drawn from native, popular traditions going back to Langland and Chaucer. To the extent that the popular opposition between plain and ornate, honest and dissembling was associated with courtiers, (South European) foreignness and Catholicism, the plowman tradition continued to be anti-Catholic and staunchly Protestant. \n\nThis popular image of the English commonwealth is often defined in the Elizabethan era in opposition to Catholic nations and \"Rome,\" which are represented as less free and unvirtuous. Hutchins notes that \"Even in the most unremittingly absolutist interpretations of Tudor theories of rule, the qualities that Elizabethans claim make a good ruler include dignified concern for the common people\" (229). Popular plowman literature constantly reasserts this view: English society is based on its regard for its foundation in the commons. As a sturdy working-class fellow in the popular culture, it is not surprising that Piers never made it into the works of the elite writers who predominate in the English literary canon. Moreover, Piers was even more archaic and parochial than Chaucer, with the added notoriety of political subversiveness and (now illegal) prophecy. University educated, aspiring courtier-writers with poorer, often rural, backgrounds (e.g., Spenser and Harvey) may have been uneasy with a tradition that sometimes cast a cold eye on the lives and ambitions of upwardly mobile urbanites like themselves. In Nashe we find a new Piers, Pierce Pennilesse, who represents the young London malcontent writer who desires but lacks patronage and recognition of his talent. While this literature is far removed from the straightforward religious and political criticisms of Crowley and others, writers like Nashe and Greene were still finding ways to use the old moral-satirical tradition to expose and attack--or just laugh at--vices directly related to contemporary social and political conditions.\n\n"}
{"id": "60508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60508", "title": "Pinball", "text": "Pinball\n\nPinball is a type of arcade game, in which points are scored by a player manipulating one or more steel balls on a play field inside a glass-covered cabinet called a pinball table (or \"pinball machine\"). The primary objective of the game is to score as many points as possible. Many modern pinball machines include a story line where the player must complete certain objectives in a certain fashion to complete the story, usually earning high scores for different methods of completing the game. Points are earned when the ball strikes different targets on the play field. A drain is situated at the bottom of the play field, partially protected by player-controlled plastic bats called flippers. A game ends after all the balls fall into the drain a certain number of times. Secondary objectives are to maximize the time spent playing (by earning \"extra balls\" and keeping the ball in play as long as possible) and to earn bonus games (known as \"replays\").\n\nThe origin of pinball are intertwined with the history of many other games. Games played outdoors by rolling balls or stones on a grass course, such as bocce or bowls, eventually evolved into various local ground billiards games played by hitting the balls with sticks and propelling them at targets, often around obstacles. Croquet, golf and paille-maille eventually derived from ground billiards variants.\n\nThe evolution of outdoor games finally led to indoor versions that could be played on a table, such as billiards, or on the floor of a pub, like bowling and shuffleboard. The tabletop versions of these games became the ancestors of modern pinball.\n\nIn France, during the long 1643–1715 reign of Louis XIV, billiard tables were narrowed, with wooden pins or skittles at one end of the table, and players would shoot balls with a stick or cue from the other end, in a game inspired as much by bowling as billiards. Pins took too long to reset when knocked down, so they were eventually fixed to the table, and holes in the bed of the table became the targets. Players could ricochet balls off the pins to achieve the harder scorable holes. A standardized version of the game eventually became known as bagatelle.\n\nSomewhere between the 1750s and 1770s, the bagatelle variant \", or Japanese billiards in English, was invented in Western Europe, despite its name. It used thin metal pins and replaced the cue at the player's end of the table with a coiled spring and a plunger. The player shot balls up the inclined playfield toward the scoring targets using this plunger, a device that remains in use in pinball to this day, and the game was also directly ancestral to pachinko.\n\nIn 1869, British inventor Montague Redgrave settled in the United States and manufactured bagatelle tables in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1871 Redgrave was granted U.S. Patent #115,357 for his \"Improvements in Bagatelle\", another name for the spring launcher that was first introduced in \"\". The game also shrank in size to fit atop a bar or counter. The balls became marbles and the wickets became small metal pins. Redgrave's popularization of the spring launcher and innovations in game design are acknowledged as the birth of pinball in its modern form.\n\nBy the 1930s, manufacturers were producing coin-operated versions of bagatelles, now known as \"marble games\" or \"pin games\". The table was under glass and used M. Redgrave's plunger device to propel the ball into the upper playfield. In 1931 David Gottlieb's \"Baffle Ball\" became the first hit of the coin-operated era. Selling for $17.50, the game dispensed five to seven balls for a penny. The game resonated with people wanting cheap entertainment in the Great Depression-era economy. Most drugstores and taverns in the U.S. operated pinball machines, with many locations quickly recovering the cost of the game. Baffle Ball sold over 50,000 units and established Gottlieb as the first major manufacturer of pinball machines.\n\nIn 1932, Gottlieb distributor Raymond Moloney found it hard to obtain more Baffle Ball units to sell. In his frustration he founded Lion Manufacturing to produce a game of his own design, \"Ballyhoo\", named after a popular magazine of the day. The game became a smash hit. Its larger playfield and ten pockets made it more challenging than \"Baffle Ball\", selling 50,000 units in 7 months. Moloney eventually changed the name of his company to Bally to reflect the success of this game. These early machines were relatively small, mechanically simple and designed to sit on a counter or bar top.\n\nThe 1930s saw major advances in pinball design with the introduction of electrification. A company called Pacific Amusements in Los Angeles, California produced a game called \"Contact\" in 1933. \"Contact\" had an electrically powered solenoid to propel the ball out of a bonus hole in the middle of the playfield. Another solenoid rang a bell to reward the player. The designer of \"Contact\", Harry Williams, would eventually form his own company, Williams Manufacturing, in 1944. Other manufacturers quickly followed suit with similar features. Electric lights soon became a standard feature of all subsequent pinball games, designed to attract players.\n\nBy the end of 1932, there were approximately 150 companies manufacturing pinball machines, most of them in Chicago, Illinois. Chicago has been the center of pinball manufacturing ever since. Competition among the companies was strong, and by 1934 there were 14 companies remaining.\n\nDuring WWII, all of the major manufacturers of coin-operated games turned to the manufacture of equipment for the war effort. Some companies, like Williams, bought old games from operators and refurbished them, adding new artwork with a patriotic theme. At the end of the war, a generation of Americans looked for amusement in bars and malt shops, and pinball saw another golden age. Improvements such as the tilt mechanism and free games (known as replays) appeared.\n\nGottlieb's \"Humpty Dumpty\", introduced in 1947, was the first game to add player-controlled flippers to keep the ball in play longer, adding a skill factor to the game. The low power flippers required three pairs around the playfield to get the ball to the top.\n\n\"Triple Action\" was the first game to feature just two flippers at the bottom of the playfield. Unlike in modern machines, the flippers faced outwards. These flippers were made more powerful by the addition of a DC (direct current) power supply. These innovations were some of many by designer Steve Kordek.\n\nThe first game to feature the familiar dual-inward-facing-flipper design was Gottlieb's \"Just 21\" released in January 1950, though the flippers were rather far apart to allow for a turret ball shooter at the bottom center of the playfield. \"Spot Bowler\", also made by Gottlieb and released in October 1950. was the first game with inward-facing flippers placed close together.\n\nThe post-war era was dominated by Gottlieb. Game designers Wayne Neyens and Ed Krynski, along with artist Leroy Parker, produced games that collectors consider some of the best classic pinball machines.\n\nThe introduction of microprocessors brought pinball into the realm of electronic gaming. The electromechanical relays and scoring reels that drove games in the 1950s and 1960s were replaced in the 1970s with circuit boards and digital displays. The first solid-state pinball is believed to be Mirco Games' \"The Spirit of '76\" (1976), though the first mainstream solid-state game was Williams' \"Hot Tip\" (1977). This new technology led to a boom for Williams and Bally, who attracted more players with games featuring more complex rules, digital sound effects, and speech.\n\nThe video game boom of the 1980s signaled the end of the boom for pinball. Arcades replaced rows of pinball machines with video games like 1978's \"Space Invaders\", 1979's \"Asteroids\", 1980's \"Pac-Man\", and 1981's \"Galaga\". These earned significantly greater profits than the pinball machines of the day, while simultaneously requiring less maintenance. Bally, Williams, and Gottlieb continued to make pinball machines, while they also manufactured video games in much higher numbers. Many of the larger companies were acquired by, or merged with, other companies. Chicago Coin was purchased by the Stern family, who brought the company into the digital era as Stern Enterprises, which closed its doors in the mid-1980s. Bally exited the pinball business in 1988 and sold their assets to Williams, who subsequently used the Bally trademark from then on for about half of their pinball releases.\n\nWhile the video game craze of the late 1970s and early 1980s dealt a severe blow to pinball revenue, it did spark the creative talents within the industry. All companies involved tried to take advantage of the new solid state technology to improve player appeal of pinball and win back former players from video games. Some of this creativity resulted in landmark designs and features still present today. Some of these include speech, such as Williams' \"Gorgar\"; ramps for the ball to travel around, such as Williams' \"Space Shuttle\"; \"multiball\", used on Williams' \"Firepower\"; multi-level games like Gottlieb's \"Black Hole\" and Williams' \"Black Knight\"; and blinking chase lights, as used on Bally's \"Xenon\". Although these novel features did not win back players as the manufacturers had hoped, they changed players' perception of pinball for coming decades.\n\nAfter the collapse of the coin-operated video game industry, pinball saw another comeback in the 1990s. Some new manufacturers entered the field such as Capcom Pinball and Alvin G. and Company, founded by Alvin Gottlieb, son of David Gottlieb. Gary Stern, the son of Williams co-founder Sam Stern, founded Data East Pinball with funding from Data East Japan.\n\nThe games from Williams now dominated the industry, with complicated mechanical devices and more elaborate display and sound systems attracting new players to the game. Licensing popular movies and icons of the day became a staple for pinball, with Bally/Williams' \"The Addams Family\" hitting an all-time modern sales record of 20,270 machines. Two years later, Williams commemorated this benchmark with a limited edition of 1,000 \"Addams Family Gold\" pinball machines, featuring gold-colored trim and updated software with new game features. Other notable popular licenses included \"\" and \"\". Expanding markets in Europe and Asia helped fuel the revival of interest. Pat Lawlor was a designer, working for Williams until their exit from the industry in 1999. About a year later, Lawlor returned to the industry, starting his own company, working in conjunction with Stern Pinball to produce new games.\n\nThe end of the 1990s saw another downturn in the industry, with Gottlieb, Capcom, and Alvin G. closing by the end of 1996. Data East's pinball division was acquired by Sega and became Sega Pinball in 1994. By 1997, there were two companies left: Sega Pinball and Williams. In 1999, Sega sold their pinball division to Gary Stern (President of Sega Pinball at the time) who called his company Stern Pinball. By this time, Williams games rarely sold more than 4,000 units. In 1999, Williams attempted to revive sales with the Pinball 2000 line of games, merging a video display into the pinball playfield. The reception was initially good with \"Revenge From Mars\" selling well over 6,000 machines, but short of the 10,000-plus production runs for releases just six years earlier. The next Pinball 2000 game, \"Star Wars Episode I\", sold only a little over 3,500 machines. Williams exited the pinball business to focus on making gaming equipment for casinos, which was more profitable. They licensed the rights to reproduce Bally/Williams parts to Illinois Pinball and the rights to reproduce full-sized machines to The Pinball Factory. Stern Pinball remained the only manufacturer of original pinball machines until 2013, when Jersey Jack Pinball started shipping \"The Wizard of Oz\". Most members of the design teams for Stern Pinball are former employees of Williams.\n\nAfter the closure of most of the pinball manufacturers in the 1990s, smaller independent manufacturers started appearing in the early 2000s.\n\nIn November 2005 The Pinball Factory (TPF) in Melbourne, Australia, announced that they would be producing a new \"Crocodile Hunter\"-themed pinball machine under the Bally label. With the death of Steve Irwin, it was announced that the future of this game was uncertain. In 2006 TPF announced that they would be reproducing two popular 90's era Williams machines, \"Medieval Madness\" and \"Cactus Canyon\". TPF however was unable to make good on its promises to produce new machines, and in October 2010 transferred its Williams Electronics Games licenses as well as its pinball spare parts manufacturing and distribution business to Planetary Pinball Supply Inc, a California distributor of pinball replacement parts.\n\nIn 2006, Illinois pinball company PinBall Manufacturing Inc. produced 178 reproductions of Capcom's \"Big Bang Bar\" for the European and US markets.\n\nIn 2010, MarsaPlay in Spain manufactured a remake of Inder's original \"Canasta\" titled \"New Canasta\", which was the first game to include a liquid-crystal display (LCD) screen in the backbox.\n\nIn 2013, Jersey Jack Pinball released \"The Wizard of Oz\" pinball machine. It is the first pinball machine manufactured in the USA with an LCD as backbox, the first widebody pinball machine since 1994 and the first new US pinball machine not made by Stern Pinball since 2001.\n\nIn 2013, the Chicago Gaming Company announced the creation of a remake of Medieval Madness. This was later followed by a 2017 release of a remake of \"Attack From Mars\".\n\nIn 2014, the new pinball manufacturer Spooky Pinball released their first game \"America's Most Haunted\".\n\nIn 2015, the new British pinball manufacturer Heighway Pinball released the racing themed pinball machine \"Full Throttle\". The game has its LCD screen for scores, info and animations located in the playfield surface at player’s eye view. The game was designed with modularity in mind so that the playfield and artwork could be swapped out for future game titles.\n\nIn 2016, Dutch Pinball, based in the Netherlands, released their first game \"The Big Lebowski\", based on the 1998 film, \"The Big Lebowski\".\n\nIn 2017, Multimorphic began shipping their pinball machine platform after several years of development. It is a modular design where different games can be swapped into the cabinet. It also has a large interactive display as the playfield surface, which is different from all prior pinball machines that were traditionally made of plywood and embedded with translucent plastic inserts for lighting.\n\nPinball machines, like many other mechanical games, were sometimes used as gambling devices. Some pinball machines, such as Bally's \"bingos\", featured a grid on the backglass scoring area with spaces corresponding to targets or holes on the playfield. Free games could be won if the player was able to get the balls to land in a winning pattern; however, doing this was nearly random, and a common use for such machines was for gambling. Other machines allowed a player to win and accumulate large numbers of \"free games\" which could then be cashed out for money with the location owner. Later, this type of feature was discontinued in an effort to legitimize the machines, and to avoid legal problems in areas where awarding free games was considered illegal, some games, called Add-A-Ball, did away with the free game feature, instead giving players extra balls to play (between 5 and 25 in most cases). These extra balls were indicated via lighted graphics in the backglass or by a ball count wheel, but in some areas that was disallowed, and some games were shipped with a sticker to cover the counters.\n\nPinball was banned beginning in the early 1940s until 1976 in New York City. New York mayor Fiorello La Guardia was responsible for the ban, believing that it robbed school children of their hard earned nickels and dimes. La Guardia spearheaded major raids throughout the city, collecting thousands of machines. The mayor participated with police in destroying machines with sledgehammers before dumping the remnants into the city's rivers.\n\nThe ban ended when Roger Sharpe (a star witness for the AMOA – Amusement and Music Operators Association) testified in April 1976 before a committee in a Manhattan courtroom that pinball games had become games of skill and were not games of chance, that is, gambling. He began to play one of two games set up in the courtroom, and – in a move he compares to Babe Ruth's home run in the 1932 World Series – called out precisely what he was going to shoot for, and then proceeded to do so. Astonished committee members reportedly voted to remove the ban, which was followed in other cities. (Sharpe reportedly acknowledges, in a self-deprecating manner, his courtroom shot was by sheer luck although there was admittedly skill involved in what he did.)\n\nLike New York, Los Angeles banned pinball machines in 1939. The ban was overturned by the Supreme Court of California in 1974 because (1) if pinball machines were games of chance, the ordinance was preempted by state law governing games of chance in general, and (2) if they were games of skill, the ordinance was unconstitutional as a denial of the equal protection of the laws. Although it was rarely enforced, Chicago's ban on pinball lasted three decades and ended in 1976. Philadelphia and Salt Lake City also had similar bans. Regardless of these events, some towns in America still have such bans on their books; the town of Kokomo, Indiana lifted its ordinance banning pinball in December 2016.\n\nAnother close but distinct relative of pinball is pachinko, a gambling game played in Japan. Although they share a common ancestry, the games are very different, in that pachinko involves shooting many small balls repeatedly into a nearly vertical playfield, while pinball is about the manipulation of the small number of balls currently in play on a near-horizontal playfield.\n\nThe key attribute of a successful pinball game is an interesting and challenging layout of scoring opportunities on the playfield. Many types of targets and features have been developed over the years.\n\nThe \"playfield\" is a planar surface inclined upward from three to seven degrees (current convention is six and a half degrees), away from the player, and includes multiple targets and scoring objectives. Some operators intentionally extend threaded levelers on the rear legs and/or shorten or remove the levelers on the front legs to create additional incline in the playfield, making the ball move faster and harder to play. It is important that the playfield be level left-to-right; a quick visual test compares the top of the back cabinet against a brick or block wall behind it, or to roll a marble down the center of the playfield glass. If it clearly rolls off to one side, a player may be inclined to stuff folded paper beneath the legs on the lower side to level the playfield. Additionally, leg levelers that are all extended fully make the game easier to nudge; when collapsed low, the entire game is more stable, and nudging becomes harder.\n\nThe ball is put into play by use of the \"plunger\", a spring-loaded rod that strikes the ball as it rests in an entry lane, or as in some newer games, by a button that signals the game logic to fire a solenoid that strikes the ball. With both devices the result is the same: The ball is propelled upwards onto the playfield. Once a ball is in play, it tends to move downward towards the player, although the ball can move in any direction, sometimes unpredictably, due to contact with objects on the playfield or by the player's own actions. To return the ball to the upper part of the playfield, the player makes use of one or more \"flippers\".\n\nManipulation of the ball may also be accomplished by various tricks, such as \"nudging\". However, excessive nudging is generally penalized by the loss of the current player's turn (known as \"tilting\") or ending of the entire game when the nudging is particularly violent (known as \"slam tilting\"). This penalty was instituted because nudging the machine too much may damage it. Many games also have a slam tilt in the bottom of the lower cabinet to end the game if the cabinet is raised and dropped to the floor in an attempt to falsely trigger the coin counting switch.\n\nThe \"plunger\" is a spring-loaded rod with a small handle, used to propel the ball into the playfield. The player can control the amount of force used for launching by pulling the plunger a certain distance (thus changing the spring compression). This is often used for a \"skill shot,\" in which a player attempts to launch a ball so that it exactly hits a specified target. Once the ball is in motion in the main area of the playfield, the plunger is not used again until another ball must be brought onto the playfield. In modern machines, an electronically controlled launcher is sometimes substituted for the plunger.\nThe shape of the ball launch button that replaces the plunger may be modified to fit the aesthetics of a particular game's theme, such as being made to look like the trigger of a gun in a game with a military or action-hero theme.\n\nThe \"flippers\" are one or more small mechanically or electromechanically controlled levers, roughly in length, used for redirecting the ball up the playfield. They are the main control that the player has over the ball. Careful timing and positional control allows the player to intentionally direct the ball in a range of directions with various levels of velocity. With the flippers, the player attempts to move the ball to hit various types of scoring targets, and to keep the ball from disappearing off the bottom of the playfield. The very first pinball games appeared in the early 1930s and did not have flippers; after launch the ball simply proceeded down the playfield, directed by static nails (or \"pins\") to one of several scoring areas. (These pins gave the game its name.) In 1947, the first mechanical flippers appeared on Gottlieb's \"Humpty Dumpty\" and by the early 1950s, the familiar two-flipper configuration, with the flippers at the bottom of the playfield above the center drain, had become standard. Some machines also added a third or fourth flipper midway up the playfield.\n\nThe new flipper ushered in the \"golden age\" of pinball, where the fierce competition between the various pinball manufacturers led to constant innovation in the field. Various types of stationary and moving targets were added, spinning scoring reels replaced games featuring static scores lit from behind. Multiplayer scores were added soon after, and then bells and other noise-makers, all of which began to make pinball less a game and more of an experience. The flippers have loaned pinball its common name in many languages, where the game is known mainly as \"flipper\".\n\n\"Bumpers\" are round knobs that, when hit, will actively push the ball away. There is also an earlier variety of bumper (known as a \"dead bumper\" or \"passive bumper\") that doesn't propel the ball away; most bumpers on machines built since the 1960s are active bumpers, variously called \"pop bumpers,\" \"thumper bumpers,\" \"jet bumpers,\" or \"turbo bumpers.\" Most recent games include a set of pop bumpers, usually three, sometimes more or fewer depending on the designer's goals. Bumpers predate flippers, and active bumpers added a great deal of spice to older games.\n\nPop bumpers are operated by a switch connected to a ring surrounding the bottom circumference of the bumper that is suspended several millimeters above the playfield surface. When the ball rolls over this ring and forces one side of it down, a switch is closed that activates the bumper's solenoid. This pulls down a tapered ring surrounding the central post of the bumper that pushes downward and outward on the ball, propelling it away.\n\n\"Kickers\" and \"slingshots\" are rubber pads which propel the ball away upon impact, like bumpers, but are usually a horizontal side of a wall. Every recent pinball machine includes slingshots to the upper left and upper right of the lowest set of flippers; older games used more experimental arrangements. They operate similarly to pop bumpers, with a switch on each side of a solenoid-operated lever arm in a typical arrangement. The switches are closed by ball contact with the rubber on the face of the kicker and this activates the solenoid.\n\nEarly pinball machines typically had full solenoid current passing through trigger switches for all types of solenoids, from kickers to pop bumpers to the flippers themselves. This caused arcing across switch contacts and rapid contact fouling and failure. As electronics were gradually implemented in pinball design, solenoids began to be switched by power transistors under software control to lower switch voltage and current, vastly extend switch service lifetime, and add flexibility to game design.\n\nAs an example, some later machines had flippers that could be operated independently of the flipper button by the machine's software. The upper-left flipper during \"Thing Flips\" on \"The Addams Family\" pinball machine triggers automatically a brief moment after the ball passes an optical sensor just above the flipper.\n\nThe smaller, lower-powered solenoids were first to be transistorized, followed later by the higher-current solenoids as the price, performance, and reliability of power transistors improved over the years.\n\n\n\nOriginally holes and saucers worked by using tubes behind the playing field, with a pin at the top to hold the ball for later drops. Another version of the tube uses two spinning wheels to transfer the ball from hole to hole. Newer versions use an electronic track with a carriage or an electromagnet to pull the ball between holes.\n\n\n\nRamps are inclined planes with a gentle enough slope that the ball may travel along it. The player attempts to direct the ball with enough force to make it to the top of the ramp and down the other side. If the player succeeds, a \"ramp shot\" has been made. Ramps frequently end in such a way that the ball goes to a flipper so one can make several ramp shots in a row. Often, the number of ramp shots scored in a game is tallied, and reaching certain numbers may lead to various game features. At other times, the ramps will go to smaller \"mini-playfields\" (small playfields, usually raised above the main game surface, with special goals or scoring).\n\n\nThere are other idiosyncratic features on many pinball playfields. Pinball games have become increasingly complex and multiple play modes, multi-level playfields, and even progression through a rudimentary \"plot\" have become common features on recent games. Pinball scoring objectives can be quite complex and require a series of targets to be hit in a particular order. Recent pinball games are distinguished by increasingly complex rule sets that require a measure of strategy and planning by the player for maximum scoring. Players seeking highest scores would be well-advised to study the placard (usually found in the lower-left corner of the playfield) to learn each game's specific patterns required for these advanced features and scoring.\n\nCommon features in modern pinball games include the following:\n\nIn the 1990s, game designers often put hidden, recurring images or references in their games, which became known as Easter eggs. For example, Williams' designers hid cows in the video displays of the games, and Pat Lawlor would place a red button in the artwork of games he developed. The methods used to find the hidden items usually involved pressing the flipper buttons in a certain order or during specific events.\n\nDesigners also included hidden messages or in-jokes; one example of this is the phrase \"DOHO\" sometimes seen quickly displayed on the dot matrix displays, a reference to Dorris Ho, the wife of then-Williams display artist Scott \"Matrix\" Slomiany. DOHO was popularly thought to be an acronym for Documented Occurrence of a Hidden Object until its true meaning was revealed in a \"PinGame Journal\" article on the subject. The game \"\" went so far as to embed a hidden \"Breakout\"-like game, available only after a complex sequence of events had been accomplished during the game.\n\nThe \"backglass\" is a vertical graphic panel mounted on the front of the backbox, which is the upright box at the top back of the machine. The backglass contains the name of the machine, eye-catching graphics, (usually) the score displays (lights, mechanical wheels, an LED display, or a dot-matrix display depending on the era), and sometimes a mechanical device tied to game play, for example, elevator doors that opened on an image or a woman swatting a cat with a broom such as on Williams' 1989 \"Bad Cats\". For older games, the backglass image is screen printed in layers on the reverse side of a piece of glass; in more recent games, the image is imprinted into a translucent piece of plastic-like material called a translite which is mounted behind a piece of glass and which is easily removable. The earliest games did not have backglasses or backboxes and were little more than playfields in boxes. Games are generally built around a particular theme, such as a sport or character and the backglass art reflects this theme to attract the attention of players. Recent machines are typically tied into other enterprises such as a popular film series, toy, or brand name. The entire machine is designed to be as eye-catching as possible to attract players and their money; every possible space is filled with colorful graphics, blinking lights, and themed objects, and the backglass is usually the first artwork the players see from a distance. Since the artistic value of the backglass may be quite impressive, it is not uncommon for enthusiasts to use a deep frame around a backglass (lighted from behind) and hang it as art after the remainder of the game is discarded.\n\nContact with or manipulation of scoring elements (such as targets or ramps) scores points for the player. Electrical switches embedded in the scoring elements detect contact and relay this information to the scoring mechanism. Older pinball machines used an electromechanical system for scoring wherein a pulse from a switch would cause a complex mechanism composed of relays to ratchet up the score. In later games these tasks have been taken over by semiconductor chips and displays are made on electronic segmented or dot-matrix displays (DMD). The first DMD on a pinball machine was used by \"Checkpoint\" and features also video mode minigames. MarsaPlay in Spain manufactured a remake of Inder's original \"Canasta\" titled \"New Canasta\", with an LCD screen in the backbox in 2010.\" The Wizard of Oz\" is the first US pinball machine that used a LCD in the back box. It is not only used for scoring and mini-games but also to display full color videos. Other display innovations on pinball machines include pinball video game hybrids like \"Baby Pac-Man\" in 1982 and \"Granny and the Gators\" in 1984 and the use of a small color video monitor for scoring and minigames in the backbox of the pinball machine \"Dakar\" from manufacturer Mr. Game in 1988 and CGA color monitors in Pinball 2000 in 1999 that utilizes a Pepper's Ghost technique to reflect the monitor in the head of the as well as modifications by the use of ColorDMD that is used to replace the standard mono color DMDs.\n\nPinball scoring can be peculiar and varies greatly from machine to machine. During the 1930s and the 1940s, lights mounted behind the painted backglasses were used for scoring purposes, making the scoring somewhat arbitrary. (Frequently the lights represented scores in the hundreds of thousands.) Then later, during the 1950s and 1960s when the scoring mechanism was limited to mechanical wheels, high scores were frequently only in the hundreds \"or\" thousands. (Although, in an effort to keep with the traditional high scores attained with the painted backglass games, the first pinball machines to use mechanical wheels for scoring, such as \"Army Navy\", allowed the score to reach into the millions by adding a number of permanent zeros to the end of the score.) The average score changed again in the 1970s with the advent of electronic displays. Average scores soon began to commonly increase back into tens or hundreds of thousands. Since then, there has been a trend of scoring inflation, with modern machines often requiring scores of over a billion points to win a free game. At the peak of this trend, two machines, \"Johnny Mnemonic\" and \"Attack from Mars\", have been played into the trillions. Another recent curiosity is the 1997 Bally game \"NBA Fastbreak\" which, true to its theme, awards points in terms of a real basketball score: Each successful shot can give from one to three points. Getting a hundred points by the end of a game is considered respectable, which makes it one of the \"lowest\" scoring pinball machines of all time. The inflated scores are the source of one of the Spanish-language names of pinball machines, \"máquina del millón\" (\"million machine\").\n\nPinball designers also entice players with the chance to win an extra game or \"replay\". Ways to get a replay might include the following:\n\nWhen an extra game is won, the machine typically makes a single loud bang, most often with a solenoid that strikes a piece of metal, or the side of the cabinet, with a rod, known as a \"knocker\", or less commonly with loudspeakers. \"Knocking\" is the act of winning an extra game when the knocker makes the loud and distinctive noise.\n\nThe primary skill of pinball involves application of the proper timing and technique to the operation of the flippers, nudging the playfield when appropriate without tilting, and choosing targets for scores or features. A skilled player can quickly \"learn the angles\" and gain a high level of control of ball motion, even on a machine they have never played. Skilled players can often play on a machine for long periods of time on a single coin. By earning extra balls, a single game can be stretched out for a long period, and if the player is playing well he or she can earn replays known as \"specials.\"\n\nA placard is usually placed in a lower corner of the playfield. It may simply show pricing information, but should also show critical details about special scoring techniques. This information is vital to achieving higher scores; it typically describes a series of events that must take place (e.g., shoot right ramp and left drop targets to light 'extra ball' rollover). Learning these details makes the game more fun and challenging. With practice — and a machine in good operating condition — a player can often achieve specific targets and higher scores and trigger exciting events.\n\nSkillful players can influence the movement of the ball by moving or bumping the pinball machine, a technique known as \"nudging.\" There are tilt mechanisms which guard against excessive manipulation of this sort. The mechanisms generally include:\n\nWhen any of these sensors is activated, the game registers a \"tilt\" and locks out, disabling solenoids for the flippers and other playfield systems so that the ball can do nothing other than roll down the playfield directly to the drain. A tilt will usually result in loss of bonus points earned by the player during that ball; the game ends if it's the last ball and the player has no extra ball. Older games would immediately end the ball in play on a tilt. Modern games give tilt warnings before sacrificing the ball in play. The number of tilt warnings can be adjusted by the operator of the machine. Until recently most games also had a \"slam tilt\" switch which guarded against kicking or slamming the coin mechanism, or for overly aggressive behavior with the machine, which could give a false indication that a coin had been inserted, thereby giving a free game or credit. This feature was recently taken out by default in new Stern S.A.M System games, but can be added as an option. A slam tilt will typically end the current game for all players.\n\nSkilled players can also hold a ball in place with the flipper, giving them more control over where they want to place the ball when they shoot it forward. This is known as \"trapping.\" This technique involves catching the ball in the corner between the base of the flipper and the wall to its side, just as the ball falls towards the flipper; the flipper is then released, which allows the ball to roll slowly downward against the flipper. The player then chooses the moment to hit the flipper again, timing the shot as the ball slides slowly against the flipper. Multi-ball games, in particular, reward trapping techniques. Usually this is done by trapping one or more balls out of play with one flipper, then using the other flipper to score points with the remaining ball or balls.\n\nOnce a player has successfully trapped a ball, they may then attempt to \"juggle\" the ball to the other flipper. This is done by tapping the flipper button quickly enough so that the trapped ball is knocked back at an angle of less than 90 degrees into the bottom of the nearest slingshot. The ball will then often bounce across the playfield to the other flipper, where the ball may then be hit (or trapped) by the opposite flipper.\n\nOccasionally a pinball machine will have a pin or post placed directly between the two bottom flippers. When this feature is present, the advanced player may then attempt to perform a \"chill maneuver\" when the ball is heading directly toward the pin by opting \"not\" to hit a flipper. If successful, this will cause the ball to bounce up and back into play. A related move, the \"dead flipper pass,\" is performed by \"not\" flipping when a ball is heading toward a flipper. If done properly, the ball will bounce off the \"dead\" flipper, across to the other flipper, where it may be trapped and controlled.\n\nTwo Pinball World Championships were held in the Washington, DC area in 1972 and 1973 under the auspices of the World Pinball Association which also published a newsletter carrying results of regional tournaments.\n\nIn 1974, students at Jersey City State College wanted to make pinball playing a varsity school sport, like football was, so they started a Pinball Club Team to compete against clubs at other schools. They asked two other schools to participate. St. Peter's College took up the challenge, while the other school did not.\n\nMany pinball leagues have formed, with varying levels of competitiveness, formality and structure. These leagues exist everywhere from the Free State Pinball Association (FSPA) in the Washington, DC area to the Tokyo Pinball Organization (TPO)] in Japan. In the late 1990s, game manufacturers added messages to some games encouraging players to join a local league, providing website addresses for prospective league players to investigate.\n\nCompetitive pinball has become increasingly popular in recent years, with the relaunch of both the Professional and Amateur Pinball Association (PAPA) and the International Flipper Pinball Association (IFPA).\n\nTwo different systems for ranking pinball players exist. The World Pinball Player Rankings (WPPR) was created by the IFPA. The WPPR formula takes into account the quantity and quality of the players in the field, and awards points based on that calculation for the nearly 200 IFPA endorsed events worldwide. PAPA manages a ranking system known as the PAPA Advanced Rating System (PARS), which uses the Glicko Rating System to mathematically analyze the results of more than 100,000 competitive matches. Since 2008 the IFPA has held a World Championship tournament, inviting the top-ranked WPPR players to compete; the current title holder is Daniele Celestino Acciari of Italy.\n\nPAPA also designates the winner of the A Division in the annual PAPA World Pinball Championships as the World Pinball Champion; the current holder of this title is Keith Elwin from the USA. Current Junior (16 and under) and Senior (50 and over) World Champions are Joshua Henderson and Paul McGlone, respectively. Samuel Ogden has become one of the most memorable champions in the PAPA tournaments, winning four straight competitions from 2004-2008 in the 50 and over category.\n\nThe first part of a pinball machine's construction involves the wiring for the game's electronic system. A color-coded wiring arrangement is wrapped around pins and connectors on a circuit board. Technicians then follow through using a meticulous set of instructions to ensure that the almost-half mile of wire is engineered properly. During this time the playing field is set onto foam strips and a bed of nails. The nails are then pressed in the playing board as the bed raises and compresses them against the header. Afterward anchors come and are hammered into place. The anchors help secure a metal railing that keeps the balls from exiting the playing field.\n\nAfter the main construction is processed, it then comes down to fitting a few lampposts, some plastic bumpers, and flashing lights. All of the wiring is permanently fastened and speakers are bolted into the cabinet. Along with this comes the most crucial tool, the spring power plunger, which is set into place.\n\nFinally, a few other toys and gimmicks are added, such as toy villains and other small themed characters. Once everything is tested and seems to be running alright, the playfield is set on top of the lower box. The lower box on computerized games is essentially empty. On older electromechanical games, the entire floor of the lower box was used to mount custom relays and special scoring switches, making older games much heavier. To protect the top of the playfield, a tempered glass window is installed, secured by a metal bar that is locked into place. The expensive, unique, painted vertical backglass is fragile. The backglass covers the custom microprocessor boards on newer games, or electromechanical scoring wheels on older games. On older games, a broken backglass might be impossible to replace, ruining the game's appeal.\n\n\nFlipper solenoids contain two coil windings in one package; a short, heavy gage 'power' winding to give the flipper its initial thrust up, and a long, light gage 'hold' winding that uses lower power (and creates far less heat) and essentially just holds the flipper up allowing the player to capture the ball in the inlane for more precise aiming. As the flipper nears the end of its upward travel, a switch under the flipper disconnects the power-winding and leaves only the second sustain winding to hold the flipper up in place. If this switch fails 'open' the flipper will be too weak to be usable, since only the weak winding is available. If it fails 'closed' the coil will overheat and destroy itself, since both windings will hold the flipper at the top of its stroke.\n\nSolenoids also control pop-bumpers, kickbacks, drop target resets, and many other features on the machine. These solenoid coils contain a single coil winding. The plunger size and wire gage & length are matched to the strength required for each coil to do its work, so some types are repeated throughout the game, some are not.\n\nAll solenoids and coils used on microprocessor games include a special reverse-biased diode to eliminate a high-voltage pulse of reverse EMF (electromotive force). Without this diode, when the solenoid is de-energized, the magnetic field that was built up in the coil collapses and generates a brief, high-voltage pulse backward into the wiring, capable of destroying the solid-state components used to control the solenoid. Proper wiring polarity must be retained during coil replacement or this diode will act as a dead short, immediately destroying electronic switches. Older electromechanical AC game solenoids do not require this diode, since they were controlled with mechanical switches. However, electromechanical games running on DC do require diodes to protect the rectifier.\n\nAll but very old games use low DC voltages to power the solenoids and electronics (or relays). Some microprocessor games use high voltages (potentially hazardous) for the score displays. Very early games used low-voltage AC power for solenoids, requiring fewer components, but AC is less efficient for powering solenoids, causing heavier wiring and slower performance. For locations that suffer from low AC wall outlet voltage, additional taps may be provided on the AC transformer in electromechanical games to permit raising the game's DC voltage levels, thus strengthening the solenoids. Microprocessor games have electronic power supplies that automatically compensate for inaccurate AC supply voltages.\n\nHistorically, pinball machines have employed a central fixed I/O board connected to the primary CPU controlled by a custom microcontroller platform running an in-house operating system. For a variety of reasons that include thermal flow, reliability, vibration reduction and serviceability, I/O electronics have been located in the upper backbox of the game, requiring significant custom wiring harnesses to connect the central I/O board to the playfield devices.\n\nA typical pinball machine I/O mix includes 16 to 24 outputs for driving solenoids, motors, electromagnets and other mechanical devices in the game. These devices can draw up to 500 W momentarily and operate at voltages up to 50 Vdc. There is also individually controlled lighting that consists of 64 to 96 individually addressable lights. Recently developed games have switched from incandescent bulbs to LEDs. And there is general illumination lighting that comprises two or more higher-power light strings connected and controlled in parallel for providing broad illumination to the playfield and backbox artwork. Additionally, 12 to 24 high-impulse lighting outputs, traditionally incandescent but now LED, provide flash effects within the game. Traditionally, these were often controlled by solenoid-level drivers.\n\nA game typically includes 64 to 96 TTL-level inputs from a variety of sensors such as mechanical leaf switches, optical sensors and electromagnetic sensors. Occasionally extra signal conditioning is necessary to adapt custom sensors, such as eddy sensors, to the system TTL inputs.\n\nRecently, some pinball manufacturers have replaced some of the discrete control wiring with standard communication buses. In one case, the pinball control system might include a custom embedded network node bus, a custom embedded Linux-based software stack, and a 48-V embedded power distribution system.\n\nSimulating a pinball machine has also been a popular theme of video games. Early pinball video games include Toru Iwatani's Namco arcade games \"Gee Bee\" (1978), \"Bomb Bee\" (1979), and \"Cutie Q\" (1979), the Atari 2600 game \"Video Pinball\" (1980), and \"David's Midnight Magic\" (1982). Most famous on home computers was Bill Budge's \"Pinball Construction Set\", released for the Apple II in 1983. \"Pinball Construction Set\" was the first program that allowed the user to create their own simulated pinball machine and then play it.\n\nMost early simulations were top-down 2D. As processor and graphics capabilities have improved, more accurate ball physics and 3D pinball simulations have become possible. Tilting has also been simulated, which can be activated using one or more keys (sometimes the space bar) for \"moving\" the machine. Flipper button computer peripherals were also released, allowing pinball fans to add an accurate feel to their game play instead of using the keyboard or mouse. Modern pinball video games are often based around established franchises such as \"Metroid Prime Pinball\", \"Super Mario Ball\", \"Pokémon Pinball\", \"Kirby's Pinball Land\", and \"Sonic Spinball\".\n\nPopular pinball games of the 1990s include \"Pinball Dreams\", \"Pro Pinball\" and \"3D Pinball: Space Cadet\" that was included in Windows Me and Windows XP. More recent examples include \"Pinball FX\", \"Pinball FX 2\", and \"Pinball FX 3\".\n\nThere have been released for all major home video game and computer systems, tablet computers and smart phones. Pinball video game engines and editors for creation and recreation of pinball machines include for instance \"Visual Pinball\", \"Future Pinball\" and \"Unit3D Pinball\".\n\nA BBC News article described virtual pinball games e.g. \"Zen Pinball\" and \"The Pinball Arcade\" as a way to preserve pinball culture and bring it to new audiences. Another example of preserving historic pinball machines is \"Zaccaria Pinball\" that consists of digital recreations of classic Zaccaria pinball machines.\n\nSome hobbyists and small companies modify existing pinball machines or create their own custom pinball machines. Some want, for example, a game with a specific subject or theme that cannot be bought in this form or was never built at all. Some custom games are built by using the programmable P-ROC controller board. Modifications include the use of ColorDMD that is used to replace the standard mono color dot-matrix displays or the addition of features, e.g. figures or other toys.\n\nA few notable examples of custom pinball machines include a \"Ghostbusters\" theme machine, a \"Matrix\" style game, Bill Paxton Pinball, \"Sonic\", \"Star Fox\", and \"Predator\" machines.\n\nData East was one of few regular pinball company that manufactured custom pinball games (e.g. for Aaron Spelling, Michael Jordan and the movie \"Richie Rich\"), though these were basically mods of existing or soon to be released pinball machines (e.g. \"Lethal Weapon 3\" or \"The Who's Tommy Pinball Wizard\").\n\nPinball games have frequently been featured in popular culture, often as a symbol of rebellion or toughness. Perhaps the most famous instance is the rock opera album \"Tommy\" (1969) by The Who, which centers on the title character, a \"deaf, dumb, and blind kid\", who becomes a \"Pinball Wizard\" and who later uses pinball as a symbol and tool for his messianic mission. (The album was subsequently made into a movie and stage musical.) \"Wizard\" has since moved into popular usage as a term for an expert pinball player. Things came full circle in 1975 when Bally created the \"Wizard!\" pinball game featuring Ann-Margret and The Who's Roger Daltrey on the backglass. In the movie version, Tommy plays a Gottlieb \"Kings and Queens\" machine, while The Champ plays a Gottlieb \"Buckaroo\" machine. In 1976, Bally released \"Capt.Fantastic\", which had an image of Elton John on the backglass, playing pinball in a similar costume as used in the movie \"Tommy\".

This game is notable in its use of The Who's iconic songs, including \"Pinball Wizard\", sung by original Broadway cast members.\n\nIn the late 1970s the children's television series \"Sesame Street\" began airing a series of short animated segments, called the \"Pinball Number Count\".

Playback singers record songs for soundtracks, and actors or actresses lip-sync the songs for cameras; the actual singer does not appear on the screen. \n\nSouth Asian movies produced in the Indian subcontinent are particularly known for using this technique. A majority of Indian movies as well as Pakistani movies typically include six or seven songs. After \"Alam Ara\" (1931), the first Indian talkie film, for many years singers made dual recordings for a film, one during the shoot, and later in the recording studio, until 1952 or 1953. Popular playback singers in India enjoy the same status as popular actors, and music directors, and they also receive wide public admiration. Most of the playback singers are initially trained in classical music, but they later often expand their range. Mohammed Rafi and Ahmed Rushdi are regarded as two of the most influential playback singers in South Asia. The sisters Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle, who have mainly worked in Hindi films, are often referred to as two of the best-known and prolific playback singers in India.

{"id": "29389622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29389622", "title": "Pre-Code crime films", "text": "Pre-Code crime films\n\nThe era of American film production from the early sound era to the enforcement of the Hays Code in 1934 is denoted as Pre-Code Hollywood. The era contained violence and crime in pictures which would not be seen again until decades later. Although the Hays office had specifically recommended removing profanity, the drug trade, and prostitution from pictures, it had never officially recommended against depictions of violence in any form in the 1920s. State censor boards, however, created their own guidelines, and New York in particular developed a list of violent material which had to be removed for a picture to be shown in the state. Two main types of crime films were released during the period: the gangster picture and the prison film.\n\nA triumvirate of gangster pictures were released in the early 1930s—\"Little Caesar\" (1931), \"The Public Enemy\" (1931), and \"Scarface\" (1932)—which were built on the template created by the first gangster movie, 1927's \"Underworld\". All featured the rise and eventual fall of an organized criminal. As described by crime film scholar Jack Shadoian the maxim became, \"If the films insist that one can’t win, under that given it’s how you lose that counts.\" \"Scarface\" was the most controversial and violent; the film took nearly a year to reach theaters due to battles with censors. Obviously based on the life of Al Capone, \"Scarface\" and others like it outraged civic leaders who felt that movies were glorifying the lifestyles of criminals.\n\nStirred into action by the 1930 Ohio penitentiary fire, which resulted in 300 deaths when guards refused to let inmates out of their cells, Hollywood produced movies which depicted the harsh conditions in prisons at the time. The prototype of the prison genre was 1930's \"The Big House\". The picture features future genre staples such as solitary confinement, informers, riots, an escape, and the codes of prison life. Never box office hits, prison pictures failed to attract the female audiences they needed to achieve financial success. The chain gang films were produced in a similar response to the callous inhumanity of the chain gang system which was prevalent among states in the southern US. The 1932 film \"I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang\" is considered the seminal movie of the genre, and was based on the autobiography of Robert E. Burns who was himself a fugitive at the time of the picture's release.\n\nIn the early 1900s America was still primarily a rural country, especially in terms of self-identity. D. W. Griffith’s 1912 film \"The Musketeers of Pig Alley\" is one of the earliest American films to feature urban organized crime. Prohibition's arrival in 1920 created an environment where anyone who wanted to drink had to interact with criminals, especially in urban areas. Nonetheless, the urban crime genre was ignored until 1927 when the film \"Underworld\", which is recognized as the first gangster movie, became a surprise hit. According to the \"Encyclopedia of Hollywood\"'s entry on \"Underworld\", \"The film established the fundamental elements of the gangster movie: a hoodlum hero; ominous, night-shrouded city streets; floozies; and a blazing finale in which the cops cut down the protagonist.\" Other gangster films such as \"Thunderbolt\", \"Lights of New York\", \"The Racket\", and \"Doorway to Hell\" were released to capitalize on \"Underworld's\" popularity, with \"Thunderbolt\" later described as \"a virtual remake\" of the film. Motivated by financial gain in an increasingly competitive film market, and motivated by the fact that provocative pictures sold tickets, these movies pushed the boundaries of film violence. Other late 1920s crime films depicted organized crime on Broadway, and investigated the connection between mobsters and Broadway productions in films such as 1929's \"Tenderloin\" and \"Broadway\".\n\nThe Hays Office had never recommended banning violence in any form in the 1920s—unlike profanity, the drug trade or prostitution—but advised that it be dealt with carefully. New York's censor board was the most active board of any state, reviewing around all but 50 of the country's 1,000–1,300 annual releases. In 1927–8 the violent scenes they most removed were all instances where the gun was pointed at the camera, some instances where guns were pointed \"at or into the body of another character\", many shots where machine guns were featured, scenes where criminals shot at law enforcement officers, some scenes involving stabbing or knife brandishing (stabbings were considered more disturbing than shootings by audiences), most whippings, several involving choking, torture, or electrocution, and scenes which could be considered educational in their depiction of crime methods. Sadistic violence, and reaction shots showing the faces of individuals on the receiving end of violence were considered especially sensitive areas. The Code later recommended against scenes showing \"robbery\", \"theft\", \"safe-cracking\", \"arson\", \"the use of firearms\", \"dynamiting of trains, machines, and buildings\", and \"brutal killings\" on the basis that they would be rejected by local censors.\n\nJustus D. Barnes, was \"Bronco Billy Anderson\", leader of an outlaw gang, from the silent film, \"The Great Train Robbery\" (1903), the first, \"Western\", ever filmed. The Western was a subgenre, of crime films. Scenes where criminals aimed guns at the camera, were considered inappropriate by many state censor boards, in the pre-Code and Code era, and were removed from public viewing.\n\nIn the early 1930s, several real life criminals became celebrities. Two in particular captured the American imagination: Al Capone and John Dillinger. Gangsters like Capone had transformed the perception of entire towns. Capone gave Chicago its \"reputation as the locus classicus of American gangsterdom, a cityscape where bullet-proof roadsters with tommygun-toting hoodlums on running boards careened around State Street spraying fusillades of slugs into flower shop windows and mowing down the competition in blood-spattered garages.\" Capone appeared on the cover of \"Time\" magazine in 1930. He was even offered seven figure sums by two major Hollywood studios to appear in a film but declined. Dillinger became a national celebrity as a bank robber who eluded arrest and escaped confinement several times. He had become the most celebrated public outlaw since Jesse James. His father appeared in a popular series of newsreels giving police homespun advice on how to catch his son. Dillinger's popularity rose so fast that \"Variety\" joked \"if Dillinger remains at large much longer and more such interviews are obtained, there may be some petitions circulated to make him our president.\" Hays wrote a cablegram to all the studios in March 1934 decreeing that Dillinger should not be portrayed in any motion picture.\n\nIn April 1931, the same month as the release of \"The Public Enemy\", Hays recruited former police chief August Vollmer to conduct a study on the effect gangster pictures had on children. After he had finished his work, Vollmer stated that gangster films were innocuous and actually too favorable in their depiction of the police. Although Hays used the results to defend the film industry, the New York State censorship board was not impressed and from 1930 to 1932 removed 2,200 crime scenes from pictures.\n\nOne of the factors that made gangster pictures so subversive was that in the difficult economic times of the Depression there already existed the viewpoint that the only way to get financial success was through crime. Many were convinced they would lead to higher rates of juvenile delinquency. The \"Kansas City Times\" argued that while adults may not be affected by these films, they were \"misleading, contaminating, and often demoralizing to children and youth.\" Exacerbating the problem, local theater owners advertised gangster pictures with a singular irresponsibility. Theaters displayed tommy guns and blackjacks and real-life murders were tied into promotions. The situation reached such a nexus that the studios had to ask exhibitors to tone down the gimmickry in their promotions.\n\nThe genre entered a new level following the 1931 release of \"Little Caesar\". The film featured Edward G. Robinson in a career defining performance as gangster Rico Bandello. \"Caesar\", along with \"The Public Enemy\" starring James Cagney, and \"Scarface\" featuring Paul Muni, were incredibly violent films that created a new type of anti-hero. Driven by the performance of one protagonist, they were considered \"actors' vehicles\". Nine gangster films were released in 1930, 26 in 1931, 28 in 1932, and 15 in 1933, when the genre's popularity began to subside after the end of Prohibition. The backlash against gangster pictures was swift. In 1931 Jack L. Warner announced that his studio would stop making them, and that he had never let his 15-year-old son see one.\n\nWarner Brothers 28‑year‑old head of production Darryl F. Zanuck decided to make a gangster picture in 1930 after one of his close friends was killed by a bootlegger. He purchased the rights to the novel \"Little Caesar\" by Chicago reporter W. R. Burnett for $15,000. Burnett had penned the gangster story after seeing the aftermath of the Capone ordered Saint Valentine's Day massacre. Generally considered the grandfather of gangster films, in \"Caesar\", Robinson as Rico, and his close friend Joe Massara (played by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.), move to Chicago. Joe wants to go straight and meets a woman. Rico, however, seeks a life of crime and joins the gang of Sam Vettori, rising to the rank of boss in the crime family. After becoming concerned his friend will betray him, he threatens him, at which point Joe's girlfriend goes to the police. Unable to bring himself to kill Joe and thus eliminate the witness against him, Rico goes into hiding. He is coaxed out by the police who publish that he is a coward to the press, and Rico is shot and killed by the police. As he is dying, he says \"Mother of mercy, is this the end of Rico?\" The film is characterized by its tight, lean narrative, and runs at a brisk pace for its 79 minutes. The Rico character is not portrayed as admirable, and is shown to possess little intelligence. The picture has a simple, obvious storyline and is filmed in brighter images during Rico's triumphant rise, and at night and darkly shot during his fall. Among later film critics, Robinson's performances is frequently cited as the film's saving grace. The role typecast Robinson and led to caricatures from comedians, comic impressionists, and animated Looney Tunes characters. Originally Robinson was cast in a small role but convinced the film's producer to let him play the lead. Wingate told Hays that he was flooded with complaints from people who saw kids in theaters nationwide \"applaud the gang leader as a hero.\" Joy and Wingate disagreed over whether the film should have been released as it was; Joy argued that \"the more ghastly, the more ruthless, the criminal acts, the stronger will be the audience reaction against men of this kind, and organized crime in general.\" Despite a personal letter from Joy pleading the film's case, Wingate, then head of the New York censor board, extensively edited the film, as did Pennsylvania's board.\n\nCaesar's success inspired MGM's \"The Secret Six\" and Fox's \"Quick Millions\", and Paramount's \"City Streets\", but the next big Hollywood gangster came from another Warner Brothers picture.\n\nWilliam Wellman's \"The Public Enemy\" (1931) was released by Warner Brothers the following year and features another career defining performance, this time by James Cagney. It was adapted from the unpublished novelette \"Beer and Blood\" written by John Bright, and adapted for the screen by Kubec Glasmon and Bright. \"Enemy\" takes place from 1909 until 1920. The film is similar to the template set in \"Caesar\" in that it follows Tom Powers (Cagney) from his rise to his eventual fall in the world of crime. Cagney's character contrasts his puritanical brother who wants him to go straight and their mother, who is at the center of the conflict between her two sons. Tom Powers is egotistical, amoral, heartless, and extremely violent. The most famous scene in the picture is referred to as the \"grapefruit scene\"; when Cagney is eating breakfast, his girlfriend angers him, so he cruelly shoves half of a grapefruit in her face. The scene became so famous that for the rest of his life when Cagney dined at a restaurant, other patrons would send his table a grapefruit. Cagney was even more violent towards women in his 1933 gangster film \"Picture Snatcher\", where he knocks out an amorous woman he is not interested in and violently throws her into the back seat of his car. \"Enemy\" was based in part on the Irish gangster Dean O'Banion, and a scene in which Cagney kills a horse that caused the death of a friend was inspired by a similar real life event where O'Banion underling Louis \"Two Guns\" Alterie and others shot a horse. The film's trailer featured no scenes from the movie; it merely contained a warning of the picture's intensity and showcased a gun being fired at the camera. Zanuck also produced \"Enemy\", and was heavily involved in the film's production. He aimed for a movie where the characters were not just immoral, but free of morals, and devoid of conscience. When he showed the film to MGM's Irving Thalberg, Thalberg remarked \"that's not a motion picture. It's beyond a motion picture.\" While Wingate conceded that the film \"was a story that needed to be told\", other states were less convinced. Maryland and Ohio cut the grapefruit scene. All states cut a scene where Powers sleeps with a gang den mother while drunk, then slaps her when he wakes up and realizes she took advantage of him.\n\n\"Public Enemy\" was a massive box office success, and helped the financial fortunes of Warner Brothers which was still operating in the red at the time. This embarrassed Hays who had remarked at the film's opening that \"the greatest of all censors—the American public—is beginning to vote thumbs down on the \"hard-boiled\" realism in literature and on the stage which marked the post-war period.\"\n\nThe most violent and controversial pre-Code gangster film was undoubtedly \"Scarface\" (1932). Directed by Howard Hawks and starring Paul Muni as Tony Camonte, the film is based on the life of Al Capone. When the film begins, Camonte works for Johnny Lovo but is unhappy being a subordinate, and is attracted to Lovo's girlfriend Poppy. He has a deep love for his promiscuous sister, who he expects to remain chaste, which has often been deemed incestuous. Lovo warns Camonte to leave the North Side alone as it is controlled by a rival mob. Camonte ignores this warning and begins a series of executions and extortions that result in a war with the North side gang. Camonte then takes the gang over from Lovo, at which point Lovo tries to kill him but fails. Camonte murders Lovo and Poppy becomes his girl. When Camonte finds his missing sister in a hotel room with his closest friend, the coin flipping gangster Guino Rinaldo (played by George Raft), he goes into a rage and kills Rinaldo. After he finds out that they had become married and wanted to surprise Camonte he becomes despondent. The film ends with first Camonte sister then Camonte being gunned down by police at his home.\n\nThe production of \"Scarface\" was troubled from the start. The Hays office warned Howard Hughes, the film's producer, not to make the film. He ignored their pleas telling Hawks: \"Screw the Hays Office. Start the picture and make it as realistic, as exciting, as grisly as possible.\" When the film was completed in late 1931, the Hays office demanded numerous changes, including a conclusion where Camonte was captured, tried, convicted, and hung, and demanded the film carry the subtitle \"Shame of a Nation\". Hughes sent the picture to numerous state censorship boards, saying that he hoped to show the film was made to combat the \"gangster menace\". After failing to get the film past the New York State censor board (then headed by Wingate) even after the changes, Hughes decided to release the movie in a version close to its original form. When other local censors refused to release the edited version, the Hays Office sent Jason Joy around to ensure them that the cycle of gangster films of this nature was coming to an end.\n\n\"Scarface\" provoked outrage mainly due to its unprecedented violence, but also because of its shifts of tone from serious to comedic. Dave Kehr, writing in the \"Chicago Reader\", said that the film blends \"comedy and horror in a manner that suggests Chico Marx let loose with a live machine gun.\" In one scene, Camonte is inside a cafe while a torrent of machine gun fire from the car of a rival gang is headed his way. His bumbling assistant, following orders from Camonte, keeps trying to answer the phone instead of ducking even after the gangsters make several passes by the cafe. After the barrage is over, Camonte picks up a tommy gun one of the mobsters dropped, and exhibits child like wonder and unrestrained excitement over the new toy. Civic leaders became furious that gangsters like Capone (who was also the blatant inspiration for \"Little Caesar\") were being applauded in movie houses all across America. Some of the biographical details that were used for Muni's character in \"Scarface\" were so obviously taken from Capone, and the detail so close, that it was impossible not to draw the parallels. Capone sent several members of his gang to threaten screenwriter Ben Hecht, but Hecht was able to convince them the picture was based on other gangsters. When \"Scarface\" was released however, Capone adored the film, and purchased a personal copy. The film remained out of circulation, until Hughes's death in 1976. Universal then re-released the picture, but some scenes from the film's original cut are lost.\n\nIn contrast to the crumbling social system outside their walls, the prison film portrayed a universe where the state was all powerful and orderly. Sparked by the Ohio penitentiary fire on April 21, 1930 in which guards refused to release prisoners from their cells causing 300 deaths, the films depicted the inhumane conditions in prisons in the early 1930s. The genre was composed of two archetypes: the prison film and the chain gang film. In the prison film, large hordes of men move about in identical uniforms, resigned to their fate, they live by a well defined code. In the chain gang film, Southern prisoners were subjected to a draconion system in the blazing outdoors where they were treated terribly by their ruthless captors. The prototype of the prison genre was 1930's \"The Big House\". 1932's \"I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang\" is considered the seminal film of the chain gang genre. Although the chain gang film \"Hell's Highway\" had beaten \"Fugitive\" to the screen two months earlier, it exerted nowhere the influence.\n\nIn \"The Big House\" Robert Montgomery plays a squirmy inmate who is sentences to six years after committing vehicular manslaughter while under the influence. His cell mates are a murderer played by Wallace Beery and a forger played by Chester Morris. The picture features future staples of the prison genre such as solitary confinement, informers, riots, visitations, an escape, and the codes of prison life. The protagonist, Montgomery, ends up being a loathsome character, a coward who will sell anyone in the prison out to get an early release. The film was banned in Ohio, the site of the deadly prison riots that inspired it. \"Numbered Men\", \"The Criminal Code\", \"Shadow of the Law\", \"Convict's Code\", and others, from no less than seven studios, followed. However, prison films only appealed to men, and had weak box office performances as a result. Studios also produced children's prison films which addressed the juvenile delinquency problems of America in the Depression. \"The Mayor of Hell\" for instance, featured kids killing a murderously abusive reform school overseer without retribution.\n\nChain gang movies, like \"Hell's Highway\" (1932), are usually used to promote awareness about the brutal conditions that prisoners were subjected to in most Southern prisons. \"I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang\" (1932), which is based on the true story of Robert. E. Burns, is by far the most famous example of those films. In the first half of 1931, \"True Detective Mysteries\" magazine had published Burns' work over six issues, and it was released as a book in January 1932. Decorated veteran James Allen (Paul Muni) returns from World War I a changed man, and seeks an alternative to the tedious job that he left behind. He travels the country looking for construction work. His ultimate goal is to become involved in construction planning. Allen follows a hobo he met at a homeless shelter into a cafe, taking him up on his offer of a free meal. When the hobo attempts to rob the eatery, Allen is charged as an accessory, convicted of stealing a few dollars, and sentenced to ten years in a chain gang. The men are chained together and transported to a quarry to break rocks every day. Even when unchained from each other, shackles remain around their ankles at all times. Allen convinces a large black prisoner who has particularly good aim to hit the shackles on his ankles with a sledgehammer to bend them. He removes his feet from the bent shackles, and in a famous sequence, escapes through the woods while being chased by bloodhounds. On the outside he develops a new identity and becomes a respected developer in Chicago. He is blackmailed into marriage by a woman he does not love who finds out his secret. When he threatens to leave her for a young woman he has fallen in love with, she turns him in. His case becomes a cause célèbre, and he agrees to turn himself in under the agreement that he will serve 90 days and then be released. He is tricked however, and not freed at the agreed upon time. This forces him to escape again, and he seeks out the young woman, telling her that they cannot be together because he will always be hunted. The films end with her asking him how he survives, and his ominous reply from the darkness; \"I Steal\".\n\nAlthough based on reality, \"Chain Gang\" changes the facts slightly to appeal to Depression era audiences by making Allen's return home one to a country that is struggling economically, even though Burns returned to the roaring twenties. The film's bleak, anti-establishment ending shocked audiences. \"Laughter in Hell\", a 1933 film directed by Edward L. Cahn and starring Pat O'Brien, was inspired in part by \"I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang\". O'Brien plays a railroad engineer who kills his wife and her lover in a jealous rage, and is sent to prison. The dead man's brother ends up being the warden of the prison and torments O'Brien's character. O'Brien and several others revolt, killing the warden and escaping. The film, which is lost, drew controversy for its lynching scene in which several black men were hanged. Reports vary if the blacks were hanged alongside other white men, or by themselves. The New Age (an African American weekly newspaper) film critic praised the filmmakers for being courageous enough to depict the atrocities that were occurring in some southern states.\n\n\n"}

Initially as a teacher preparatory college there was no formal mascot until the 1920s when the nickname the \"peds\" was used to refer to the pedagogues an informal reference to teachers. In the 1950s the mascot the Indians were adopted, but this was dropped in 1976 due to the fact that Native American groups saw this as not representative of their culture. During 1977 there was a competition to come up with a new mascot. During the same time then Mankato State University was transitioning to a new athletic conference, the North Central Conference. The winning suggestion was from Professor Roy Cook, a native of Texas, who suggested the Maverick. The Maverick is a wild powerful steer, unbranded and unyielding.\n\nFrom this Stomper the Maverick, the mascot was born in the 1980s and officially given the name \"Stomper\" during Homecoming festivies in 1993 (officially unveiled Oct. 14, 1993). Over the years Stomper has had different designs, with the most recent redesign in 2006.\n"}

Based on the play \"Bless You Sister\" by John Meehan and Robert Riskin, the film is about a preacher's daughter who becomes disillusioned by the mistreatment of her dying father by his church. Having grown cynical about religion, she teams up with a con man and performs fake miracles for profit. The love and trust of a blind man, however, restores her faith in God and her fellow man. \"The Miracle Woman\" was the second of five film collaborations between Capra with Stanwyck. Produced and distributed by Columbia Pictures, the film was reportedly inspired by the life of Aimee Semple McPherson.\n\nFlorence Fallon is outraged when church elders, in order to make way for a younger preacher, fire her minister father after his many years of selfless service. Following her father's death, she tells the congregation what she thinks of their ingratitude and hypocrisy. Her bitter, impassioned speech impresses Bob Hornsby, who convinces her to become a phony evangelist so they can squeeze donations out of gullible believers. Promoted as Sister Fallon, Florence then travels about the country with Bob, who manages her \"Temple of Happiness\". Soon she attracts a devoted national following, but the religious sham comes tumbling down once she meets and falls in love with John Carson, a blind war veteran. When Florence is blackmailed by Bob, she tells John of her charade. John then puts a plan in motion to expose Hornsby and the organization\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

It was probably composed not long before; nineteenth-century speculations that the text was an old play of Dekker's, revised by Ford, have fallen out of favor. The original text may have been revised c. 1638–39; material in the early portion of Act V reflects the dominant political situation at that time. Cyrus Hoy has suggested that the play was revised and revived at that time, as a response to Thomas Nabbes's \"Microcosmus\" (1636; published 1637). Several attempts have been made by individual commentators to identify the shares of the two collaborators, though no general agreement on the question has been reached.\n\nThe first edition was a quarto printed by T. Bell for the bookseller Andrew Pennycuicke. The 1656 title page states that the play was \"often presented\" by Queen Henrietta's Men at the Cockpit Theatre; but it also makes the questionable claim that the play was \"often presented\" at Whitehall Palace — a claim dropped from the title page of the second quarto of 1657. If the work had a Court performance, it would in all likelihood have been once or at most twice, not \"often.\"\n\nPennycuicke dedicated Q1 to Lady Newton, wife of Sir Henry Newton. Q2 was dedicated to Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton; that dedication is signed by Pennycuicke and the actor Theophilus Bird. Both the 1656 and 1657 editions include prefatory verses by John Tatham. The title pages describe the work as a \"moral masque\" — an accurate description, in that the drama combines the traits and characteristics of the traditional morality play with those of the 17th-century masque.\n\nFeaturing standard masque-style personifications, like Youth, Health, Delight, Time, Detraction, Fortune, etc., and rich in songs, dances, and May-Day games, the play has some obvious crowd appeal to explain its popularity in its own era. The protagonist is Raybright, who is the child and \"darling\" of the Sun. To treat his melancholy, he is given a year to experience the earthly pleasures of the four seasons. He falls, however, under the deceptive influences of Humor (in the Elizabethan sense) and Folly, and his search for satisfaction is unfulfilled. In the end the Sun warns Raybright that he must resist Folly and Humor to attain harmony.\n\nSome critics have praised the \"vitality and beauty\" of some of the lyrics in the play; others have judged the work more harshly.\n\n"}

{"id": "3320842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3320842", "title": "Tour promoter", "text": "Tour promoter\n\nTour promoters (also known as concert promoters or talent buyers) are the individuals or companies responsible for organizing a live concert tour or special event performance. The tour promoter makes an offer of employment to a particular artist, usually through the artist’s agent or music manager. The promoter and agent then negotiate the live performance contract. The majority of live performance contracts are drawn up using the American Federation of Musicians (AFM) standard contract format known as the \"AFM Performance Agreement\".\n\nIncluded among the tour promoter’s various job responsibilities are: (1) obtaining venue, concert hall, theater, nightclub or arena bookings; (2) pricing the event or tour; and (3) providing air, sea or land transportation (optional). However the promoter must have upfront cash and or sponsorship financing to pay for advertising the tours of the artists. Such advertising costs, usually referred to as a Media or Promotional Kit, commonly include television and radio advertisements, posters, newspaper and magazine adverts, online marketing and so on.\n\nThere are no figures available concerning how much an average concert promoter makes annually. Like most music industry professions, compensation depends on the level of success possessed by the artist the promoter works with, location, and what a given market will bear. The promoter assumes all the financial risk in putting on a show, so compensation also depends on how successful the promoter is at negotiating with vendors and creating sold-out shows. Additionally, in-depth knowledge of their operating market and audience characteristics are critical success factors for any tour promoter.\n\nThe rise of large corporation mega-promoters over the past ten years has made it much more difficult for aspiring tour promoters to break into the industry. Live Nation (previously known as Clear Channel Entertainment) is the number one concert promoter in the world according to figures released by \"Pollstar Magazine\" in 2006. The Beverly Hills, California-based corporation accounted for about $1.3 billion in concert box-office sales during 2005, according to Billboard magazine's tracking. Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG Live) was ranked second with $417 million, followed by House of Blues (HOB Entertainment) at number three with $245 million. On July 5, 2006, Live Nation purchased HOB Entertainment for $350 million, further expanding their market share in the live-music business.\n\nWhile average ticket prices jumped to roughly $57 in 2005, the number of tickets sold for the 100 biggest tours dipped 3.5%, to 36.3 million. Some fans have complained to government officials, particularly after they found tickets to the same concerts or sporting events available - sometimes at many times the face value - on secondary sellers like Stubhub.com and TicketsNow minutes after the public sale began. After hearing from some would-be ticket buyers, the Missouri attorney general announced the state was suing three ticket resellers on charges they violated state consumer protection laws. That same day, the Arkansas attorney general said he was seeking documents from five resellers. And the attorney general’s office in Pennsylvania is also looking into the ticket sale business after receiving several hundred complaints over the recent sale of tickets for a Hannah Montana concert in Pittsburgh.\n\nOn December 21, 2007, Live Nation announced it would acquire the software and services to ramp up its ticket-selling operation, potentially positioning the company to compete directly with its longtime contractor, Ticketmaster.\n\nLive Nation, the largest concert promoter, and Ticketmaster Entertainment, the No. 1 ticket seller, announced merger on February 10, 2009. Then on January 25, 2010 the U.S. Department of Justice approved the merger with terms that include that Ticketmaster sell Paciolan, its ticketing and software services unit, to Comcast's sports and entertainment firm or \"another buyer suitable to the department.\"\n\nTicketmaster must also license its software to Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), the company’s largest customer. With a copy of the Ticketmaster software, AEG will be able to market an attractive ticketing system to venues, according to the DOJ; under the settlement terms, both companies will be able to compete head-to-head with Ticketmaster.\n\nColleges can provide \"dedicated fans, an excellent testing ground, eager workers, [and] loyal fans.\" The college market provides a network of new potential fans that artists, labels, agents, and managers could focus on for promotion. The major record labels have departments dedicated to college promotion and hire students as representatives for all the artists on these labels. Sony Music Entertainment has a college marketing department, which promotes records released by Sony and by their independent label affiliates. Other music marketing companies such as Cornerstone Promotion focus on college marketing. Cornerstone Promotion hires representatives from colleges all around the country to implement small scale marketing campaigns on their campuses. \nArtists began breaking into the college market in the 1990s. Billboard Magazine published articles dating back to the early-mid nineties urging artists and agents to take advantage of the college market. Artists such as Dave Matthews Band and R.E.M. played college shows to increase their presence in the college market in the nineties. Billboard Magazine has emphasized the extent to which college concerts can help an artist in multiple articles.\n\nThere are numerous degree programs and academic courses focusing on concert promotion and venue management. Some of these are full degree programs, while others are certificates offered for post-graduate studies. For example, New York University offers a Certificate in Meeting, Conference, and Event Management, and a Certificate in Sports Marketing.\n\n\n"}

United States was a 2003 decision in the United States Court of International Trade that determined that for purposes of tariffs, Toy Biz's action figures were toys, not dolls, because they represented \"nonhuman creatures\". This decision effectively halved the tariff rate, from 12 percent tax to 6.8 percent.\n\nThe Harmonized Tariff Schedule in U.S. law distinguished between two types of action figures for determining tariffs: dolls, which are defined to include human figures, and toys, which include \"nonhuman creatures\". Because duties on dolls were higher than those on toys, Marvel Comics subsidiary Toy Biz argued before the U.S. Court of International Trade, that their action figures (including the X-Men and Fantastic Four) represented \"nonhuman creatures\" and were subject to the lower tariff rates for toys instead of the higher ones for dolls. On January 3, 2003, after examining more than 60 action figures, Judge Judith Barzilay ruled in their favor, granting Toy Biz reimbursement for import taxes on previous toys.\n\nBecause a common theme in Marvel Comics had been the struggle for mutants like the X-Men to prove their humanity, the case shocked numerous fans. Marvel responded to these concerns by claiming \"our heroes are living, breathing human beingsbut humans who have extraordinary abilities ... A decision that the X-Men figures indeed do have 'nonhuman' characteristics further proves our characters have special, out-of-this world powers\".\n\nThe Harmonized Tariff Schedule was amended to eliminate the distinction between dolls and other toys, which are now in the same category.\n\n"}

It originally ran for four series, from 9 October 1996 to 28 September 1999, being produced by Optomen Television for the BBC. Since then, the show has been repeated frequently on the Food Network and Cooking Channel in the U.S. and on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in Australia. In the UK, the show has been transmitted many times on the satellite channel Good Food.\n\nThe show centred on Clarissa Dickson Wright and Jennifer Paterson, travelling the United Kingdom for most of the episodes, except for one episode in Ireland and a Christmas special in Jamaica, on a Triumph Thunderbird motorcycle driven by Paterson. It sported the registration N88 TFL (the British bingo call for number 88 is \"Two Fat Ladies\") and had a Watsonian Jubilee GP-700 \"doublewide\" sidecar where Dickson Wright rode. They travelled to various destinations, such as an army garrison and an all-girls school, where they prepared large meals, often with unusual ingredients.\n\nPaterson's uncle, Anthony Bartlett, was Gentiluomo to the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster, and so some episodes were videotaped at Westminster Cathedral and an Irish convent. While cooking at Westminster Cathedral, Paterson cooked an original dish, \"Peaches Cardinal Hume\". In the same episode, Dickson Wright demonstrated a bubble and squeak recipe which used two ounces of lard, which she insisted is the only fat besides beef dripping that could ever get hot enough to produce the recipe as it should be produced. Similarly, her recipe for buttered spatchcock saw chickens covered with a thick layer of butter, bread and more butter on top of the bread. Recipes such as this led to criticism by some who considered them to be a bad influence on the British diet.\n\nOptomen Television had this to say, as if in reply to their critics: \"The Ladies are cooks not chefs - they reject the pretensions and elaborations of haute cuisine and are aggressively unfashionable, delighting in such ingredients as clotted cream, lard and fatty meats.\"\n\nPaterson and Dickson Wright sang their own theme song written by composer Pete Baikie, and Paterson often burst into song during the show, once introducing apple pan dowdy with a verse from the song \"Shoo-Fly Pie and Apple Pan Dowdy\" (erroneously attributing the song to The Andrews Sisters). They revelled in cooking at grand locations, as at Lennoxlove House near Edinburgh.\n\nBoth Paterson and Dickson Wright affected unconcern with fat or calories. Paterson also smoked heavily and, at one point, took the opportunity to go out for a cigarette while a dish cooked in the oven. Most episodes ended with her smoking a cigarette and consuming an alcoholic beverage. Several times references were made to the fact that Dickson Wright, a recovering alcoholic, no longer drank any alcoholic beverages.\n\nPaterson died of lung cancer on 10 August 1999, one month after diagnosis. The day before she died, she asked Dickson Wright to bring her a tin of caviar but when Dickson Wright arrived at the hospital, Paterson had already died. Dickson Wright said that after Paterson's funeral, she ate the caviar as a tribute to her friend. Dickson Wright died of pneumonia in the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 15 March 2014.\n\n\n\"The Two Fat Ladies\" produced four cookbooks which accompanied each of the four television series. In order: \"Two Fat Ladies: Gastronomic Adventures (with Motorbike and Sidecar)\", \"The Two Fat Ladies Ride Again\", \"The Two Fat Ladies: Full Throttle\" and \"Two Fat Ladies Obsessions\".\n\n\"The Two Fat Ladies\" DVD set was released in the United States in July 2008. The Acorn Media UK set includes a 40-minute BBC tribute to Paterson, biographies of the stars and \"six yummo recipes\" in a booklet. It contains all 24 episodes across four discs. The show had previously been released in Britain as a Region 2 DVD set.\n\n\n"}

The head and foot of the card gives the rank and suit in Chinese characters. During French colonial rule, the Marseilles firm Camoin redesigned the deck to depict people wearing traditional Japanese costumes from the Edo period. There are three suits: Cash (文, \"Văn\"), Strings of Cash (索, \"Sách\"), and Myriads of Strings (萬, \"Vạn\"). Each suit is divided into ten ranks with the highest cards being the Half Cash, Zero String, and Old Man respectively.

As a Gion geisha, she was known as \"Kokyū no Sekka\" (胡弓の雪香) for her \"sublime\" performances on the traditional kokyū instrument. George Morgan arrived in Japan in 1902 and saw Yuki performing at Miyako Odori geisha theater. He courted Yuki for two years and paid her debt to the Okiya house for $20,000.00.\n\nIt was reported to the Morgan family in the US that the young lady he married came from an excellent family. However, according to some accounts of their reception in the US, she was rejected and ostracized by the Morgans. She accompanied Morgan to Paris, France. But he died of heart failure in Spain in 1915.\n\nYuki then returned to Kyoto in 1938 and became a Roman Catholic in 1953. During this time, Kato experienced close police surveillance.
