The game features two modes of control, named \"Optimum\"\", which prevents the player from doing full rolls, and \"Original\", which gives the players full control of the aircraft. Co-operative missions and free-for-all Deathmatch have returned, but two new modes named \"Capital Conquest\" and \"Domination\" were added to the game. This is also the first \"Ace Combat\" title with a plot mostly written by non-Japanese writers, with noted author Jim DeFelice at the helm. Set in 2015-2016, the game's story mainly focuses on members of the United Nations' 108th Task Force, a joint NATO-Russia military organization primarily assigned to quell a rebellion spreading over East Africa.\n\nAnnounced in August 2010, \"Assault Horizon\" continued the trend of \"Ace Combat\" games set in the real Earth rather than on \"Strangereal\", the setting for most Ace Combat games. As a result, the game takes place in various regions, including Miami, East Africa, Moscow, and Dubai. The game received a generally positive reception upon release, with critics praising the game's settings, graphics and the soundtrack. However, some critics criticized the game for having repetitive gameplay and being overly-scripted. More than 1.07 million copies were sold worldwide upon release.\n\nThe major new gameplay feature is a system called \"Close-Range Assault\" (CRA), which aims to increase the intensity and bring the action closer to the player, without the feeling of \"shooting at faraway dots\" commonly seen in flight games. In the game, it is named \"Dogfight Mode\" (DFM) for air-to-air battles and \"Air Strike Mode\" (ASM) for air-to-ground targets. They are not optional, as certain planes and ground targets cannot be destroyed without CRA. To initiate DFM, the player taps LB+RB on the Xbox 360 or L2+R2 on the PS3 when they have gotten close enough to the plane they are targeting. ASM is initiated by pressing the same buttons at specific points around the map. Players will also pilot other aircraft types and assume other combat aviation functions; the game introduces the B-1 and B-2 strategic bombers and the AH-64 Apache and UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters as player-flyable vehicles. Certain missions may call for players to act as Black Hawk door gunners or weapons officers aboard the AC-130 Spectre gunship. Dogfight Mode has received numerous criticisms primarily from those who have played previous Ace Combat games, saying that it has ruined the core gameplay of the game and eliminating freedom of style.\n\n\"Assault Horizon's\" multiplayer has been improved since \"\". Co-operative missions and free-for-all Deathmatch have returned, but two new modes have been added as well: \"Capital Conquest\" and \"Domination\". In Capital Conquest, two teams of 4v4 or 8v8 each take control of their own headquarters, and must destroy the other team's headquarters. First, the transmission base in the center of the map must come under one team's control; once that's accomplished, the team's multiroles and attackers (and bombers, given the right conditions) can initiate Air Strike Mode to damage the other team's HQ. The first team to destroy the other's HQ wins; if the time limit is reached before an HQ could be destroyed, then the team with the most HQ health remaining wins. On the \"Ace Combat\" website, players can join an online faction (one for each capital city featured in Capital Conquest), and any points they receive individually while playing in a certain city will go towards that player's faction's control of that city. Every six weeks, the faction with the most global control wins.\n\nIn Domination, two teams of 4v4 or 8v8 battle it out to take control of three different bases in one single city. Taking control of a base is similar to the \"King of the Hill\" mode in other games; when a base is neutral, one team must stay inside it for a certain amount of time to take it over. The opposing team must destroy the ground targets that now pop up around that base, and then they must stay inside for a certain amount of time to take it over. Every 60 seconds, points are awarded to each team, 1 for each base they control at the time. The team with the most points wins.\n\nThere are two control schemes in the game: \"Optimum\" and \"Original.\"\n\nIn addition to these settings, there are many options to tweak the controls and adapt to the player's style. It includes the choice of normal or reverse settings for the Pitch Control, Camera Control, Throttle, and Yaw. High-G turns return from \"Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation\", as well as Auto Pilot if both shoulder buttons are held down. Lastly, the Flight Assistance provides opportunities to players such as Auto-leveling, Automatic Collision Prevention, Automatic Stall Prevention, Sight Assist, and Automatic Forward Target Selection. Flight Assistance can be turned on or off. On the Xbox 360, the game supports the Ace Edge Joysticks released with \"Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation\".\n\nUnlike other games in the \"Ace Combat\" series, \"Assault Horizon\" takes place in real world locations. The story itself takes place between 2015-2016, in locations within East Africa, the Middle East, Russia, and the United States.\n\nThe game's protagonists are mostly members of the United Nations' 108th Task Force, a joint NATO-Russian military organization primarily assigned to quell a rebellion spreading over East Africa. Players primarily assume the role of Lieutenant Colonel William Bishop, head of the United States Air Force's Warwolf Squadron. He is assisted by wingman José \"Guts\" Gutierrez, NATO General Pierre La Pointe and pilots of the 108th's Nomad, Shooter, and Spooky squadrons. The antagonists are Russian General Ivan Stagleishov, and Russian Air Force pilots Andrei Markov and Maj. Sergei Illyich, who are members of a Russian criminal syndicate called the Blatnoi.\n\nIn the prologue, USAF Lt Colonel William Bishop leads an American defense of Miami against Russian forces, but is shot down by a mysterious plane with a \"shark mouth\" motif; the entire sequence is revealed to be a nightmare. He later awakes and sees the survivors of a helicopter raid on an insurgent stronghold in East Africa being rushed in for treatment. Their force is wiped out after a large explosive device is set off on the stronghold by the SRN rebel group. The 108th regroups to rescue Maj. Sergei Illich, a Russian officer serving with the task force who was shot down in an earlier operation. The SRN's use of the powerful explosive leads the 108th to an SRN cave hideout near the archaeological ruins of Mogadiyu, but the 108th's Russian co-commander, General Stagleishov, holds back his forces from joining the attack and even launch their fighters. On the way back, Warwolf receives a distress call from a city under rebel attack but they are intercepted by the Russians. In the course of the battle, Bishop is shot down by Andrei Markov, a highly skilled Russian pilot who flies the same plane from Bishop's nightmare. The Russians withdraw and the rebels detonate a more powerful version of the mysterious explosive on the 108th's base just as Warwolf lands.\n\nThe 108th identifies the new weapon as \"Trinity,\" a conventional explosive with the power of a tactical nuclear weapon and designed for various weapon platforms such as cruise missiles. The 108th's survivors head to Dubai to defend the city from elements of the Russian criminal organization Blatnoi aiming to use the weapon on the city and intercept rebel cargo ships in hopes of finding Trinity weapons. However, this buys the Blatnoi time to launch a coup d'état in Russia with massive support from the Russian military. Under Stagleishov's command, the so-called New Russian Federation quickly takes control of Moscow and its surrounding areas, while the 108th joins other loyalist Russian units to take on the coup forces. Illich, who was one of the Russian pilots to leave East Africa, assists in the counteroffensive but disappears as the 108th successfully shoot down a Trinity cruise missile and an ICBM targeted for the United States. A Trinity missile destroys much of the 108th's strike force heading to Moscow and Bishop leads Warwolf in shooting down a Russian bomber squadron bearing down on the capital; he also takes out Markov's personal plane and the pilot ejects. Seeing the futility of resistance, Stagleishov negotiates the NRF's surrender by exchanging the final Trinity missile for political immunity, but Markov kills him and steals the weapon. It is revealed that Markov planned everything as revenge against the US for an airstrike during the Bosnian War that killed his wife, with the coup as a decoy to lure many American forces out of the homeland and weaken its defenses.\n\nIllich is revealed as Markov's sleeper agent and betrays the 108th by joining his forces bound for the U.S. from bases in South America. The 108th and several American combat units reinforce and defend Miami against an onslaught by Markov's forces. Bishop's earlier nightmare comes to life but Guts is able to protect him and the Trinity missile on Markov's plane is damaged in the process. Bishop then chases after an escaping Markov and Illich and encounters them in midst of a Category 5 hurricane, Markov escapes while Illich covers his retreat, after a long and difficult battle Bishop finally overcomes Illich. The 108th recovers and assists in the defense of Washington DC against a larger Russian attack. In a final showdown, Bishop finally eliminates Markov and shoots down his Trinity missile aimed at the White House. Upon landing his plane at Reagan National Airport, Bishop is given a hero's welcome while Guts is safely rescued.\n\nThe game was first hinted at by a trademark filing by Namco Bandai in April 2010. It was officially announced along with a gameplay trailer on August 9, 2010. Gameplay has been expanded to include the use of helicopters and gunships as well. The trailer showed the player using an AH-64D Apache Longbow gunship, and occupying the gunner's position on the UH-60 Black Hawk while attacking a desert village. In the trailer the US Air Force is engaged in dogfighting with Russian fighters over Miami. The player is in an F-22 engaging and destroying several enemies before being shot down himself. Pierre La Pointe, the French commander of the 108th Task Force, briefs the Task Force on an Ace leading the attack on Miami named Col. Markov who has been nicknamed Akula (Russian for shark) because of the design on the nose of his plane. Russian involvement in the conflict has been described as \"advisers and mercenaries\" in the E3 Trailer. Another scene showed a US A-10 attacking a fleet of naval ships. The extended trailer had additional scenes of air battles with the player flying an F-35 and an F-16 over Dubai and an attack on a desert oil facility. It is also revealed that the time is sometime in 2015 and will also take place in East Africa.\n\n\"Ace Combat: Assault Horizon\" continues the trend of \"Ace Combat\" games set in the real Earth rather than on \"Strangereal\", the setting for most \"Ace Combat\" games. The game takes place over a number of locations, including: Miami, East Africa, Dubai and the Middle East, Russia (Derbent, the Black Sea, Caucasus, and Moscow specifically), and Washington, D.C.. Fictional towns and cities were also used, including Mogadiyu, Carruth, and Belyi Base (believed to be based on Belaya). The developers used satellite imagery to accurately render the real-life locations, making it possible for players to pick out actual buildings and locations while playing the game. Miami, East Africa, Dubai, Moscow, and Washington, D.C. are available in multiple multiplayer modes alongside Paris. Honolulu and Tokyo were added as downloadable maps.\n\nA demo was released on September 13, 2011. All PlayStation 3 players could download it for free; however, Xbox 360 players needed to have Xbox LIVE Gold for the first week in order to download it; it then migrated to Xbox LIVE Silver as well. The demo included Mission 1 and Mission 3, with the iconic nightmare air battle over Miami from the trailers and the attack helicopter rescue operation in Africa, respectively. However, it has since been removed and no longer able for other players to download.\n\nMacross creator Shouji Kawamori designed a fictional plane for the game, the \"ASF-X Shinden II\", which was released on October 25, 2011 and is currently being offered as downloadable content. It can be purchased in the PlayStation Store for $7.99 USD or in the Xbox Marketplace for 640 MS Points.\n\nFor European regions, Namco Bandai released a \"Limited Edition\" that also included the game's soundtrack, a redeemable code to download the F-4E Phantom II aircraft, and a notebook signed by the development team, all in a folded box. Gamers who pre-ordered this Limited Edition of the game received it for the same price as the standard edition. A separate \"Helicopter Edition\" was also released, containing a 25 cm remote-controlled Black Hawk helicopter (with the livery seen in the game), a remote control, a rechargeable battery for the helicopter, and a branded pen and keychain, along with all of the contents of the Limited Edition. A special edition released in Japan included \"Aces at War: A History\", a special artbook detailing the content from \"Ace Combat Zero\", \"4\", and \"5\" from an in-universe perspective, as well as production notes from the Project Aces team.\n\nIn Japan, gamers who pre-ordered the game received a code to download the F-4E Phantom II. In the United States, GameStop also offered the plane as an exclusive pre-order bonus. The Japanese edition of the game also has options to download special skins for the F-14 representing Roy Fokker and Hikaru Ichijo's VF-1 Valkyrie transformable fighters from \"Macross\".\n\nA patch was released on November 26, 2012, that fixed some of the jarring issues players had complained about with the multiplayer, specifically about players cheating with certain weapons or maneuvers. A day later, the PC version of the game was officially announced, as well as the availability of the game on the PlayStation Store and Xbox 360 Games on Demand. The PC version is available through retailers as well as Steam and Games for Windows Marketplace.\n\nThe \"Enhanced Edition\" was announced in November 2012. This edition is exclusive to PCs; it comes with optimized controls and graphics as well as several additional aircraft, aircraft skins, multiplayer maps, and multiplayer skills. It was released in the winter of 2012.\n\nThe \"Advanced Edition\" was also announced in November 2012. This edition is exclusive to the PlayStation Store. It comes with the Tokyo and Honolulu maps, as well as the ASF-X Shinden II, F-15S/MTD, Su-37 Terminator, AV-8B Harrier II plus, CFA-44 Nosferatu, and Ka-50 Hokum.\n\nIn March 2012, ASCII Media Works released \"Ace Combat: Ikaros in the Sky.\" A tie-in novel for Assault Horizon, Ikaros is the story of series character Kei Nagase as she participates in the JASDF's ASF-X Shinden II fighter program.\n\nThe game has garnered mixed to positive reviews. Metacritic gives the game a 78 out of 100 (based on 71 reviews) for the Xbox 360 release, a 77 out of 100 (based on 28 reviews) for the PlayStation 3 release, and a 77/100 for the Enhanced Edition on PC.\n\nCritics praised the real-world settings, graphics and the soundtrack, but criticized the game for being repetitive and overly scripted. Critics also praised the voice-acting of the characters. Reception from the audience has also been positive; users on Metacritic give a 6.8/10 for the Xbox 360 and a 7.2/10 for the PS3, with some gamers feeling that the new gameplay elements kept the series \"fresh and exciting\". IGN gave Assault Horizon a 7.5/10, praising the game for keeping the arcade-like controls to make it easy to jump into. The editor noted that this was more like a spin-off than an actual part of the series, especially since it didn't have a number; however, it was again criticized for its repetition in the new Close Range Assault systems. GameSpot gave the game a 5.5/10 and 1UP gave it a D+, finding some of these criticized features to be what ruined the game's potential, and comparing the game to the \"Call of Duty\" series.\n\nIn response to the initial mostly positive response, Namco Bandai Games created a special \"Accolades Trailer\" one month after the game's release, in which many of the positive comments from well-known reviewers are featured alongside gameplay. As of May 8, 2012, the game has sold 1.07 million copies worldwide.\n\n"}
{"id": "2227456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227456", "title": "Alive II", "text": "Alive II\n\nAlive II is the second live album (and eighth overall) by American hard rock band Kiss, released on October 14, 1977 by Casablanca Records. The band had released three albums (\"Destroyer\", \"Rock and Roll Over\", and \"Love Gun\") since the previous live outing, the 1975 release \"Alive!\", and the band drew upon the variety of new tracks, with Eddie Kramer producing.\n\nThe origins of \"Alive II\" go back to early 1977 when the band's manager Bill Aucoin suggested that Kramer record a live album during the evening show at Budokan Hall in Tokyo, Japan on April 2, 1977. The plan was to release a live album to give Kiss some much deserved time off before recording the album that would become \"Love Gun\" later that autumn. Kramer finished work on the album, but Casablanca and Kiss deemed it unusable, and the band forged ahead with their \"Love Gun\" sessions.\n\nMost of the live tracks on \"Alive II\" were recorded during the band's August 26–28 shows at the Forum while on their Love Gun Tour. The 3 p.m. soundchecks at the August 26 and 27 shows were recorded, and later used on the album (i.e. \"I Stole Your Love\") with crowd noise being dubbed in later. \"Beth\" and \"I Want You\" were lifted from the aborted Japanese live album and used on the finished \"Alive II\". As the band did not want to duplicate songs included on \"Alive!\", the songs chosen for the three live sides of the album were all drawn from Kiss' three preceding studio albums: \"Destroyer\", \"Rock and Roll Over\" and \"Love Gun\".\n\nOn the original double album, the songs on side 4 (tracks 6–10 on the second CD) are studio tracks recorded September 13–16, 1977. Although Ace Frehley was originally credited for lead guitar on the studio tracks, the remastered version released in 1997 confirmed what had been speculated by Kiss fans for years: Bob Kulick actually played lead guitar on three tracks (\"All American Man\", \"Rockin' in the U.S.A.\" and \"Larger Than Life\"), not Frehley. Frehley's sole involvement for the studio songs was \"Rocket Ride\" (originally written for a solo album), on which he sang lead vocals and played both guitar and bass guitar. Paul Stanley played all guitars on \"Any Way You Want It\", which was originally recorded by the Dave Clark Five in 1964.\n\nSeveral early copies of the album's cover featured a rare misprint of three additional songs (\"Take Me\", \"Hooligan\" and \"Do You Love Me?\") with a slightly altered song order. None of these additional songs appeared on the LP. On the misprint, \"Take Me\" is after \"Detroit Rock City\", with \"King of the Night Time World\" appearing after \"Ladies Room\" on Side 1. Side two features \"Hooligan\" after \"Shock Me\", which is placed after \"Hard Luck Woman\". On Side 3, \"Do You Love Me?\" appears after \"God of Thunder\", with \"Beth\" sandwiched between \"I Want You\" and \"Shout It Out Loud\". \"Hooligan\" and \"Take Me\" were performed on the 1977 \"Love Gun\" tour, and \"Do You Love Me?\" was performed on the Japanese tour that same year, making their consideration for inclusion with the second live album possible.\n\nThe original vinyl issue of \"Alive II\" was a 2-LP set with a gatefold cover and picture inner sleeves. Continuing the Kiss tradition of including promotional items with their albums, \"Alive II\" was packaged with a full-color booklet titled \"The Evolution of Kiss\" and a set of temporary transfer tattoos in a cartoon style. The tattoos depicted the band logo, Kiss Army logo, band member heads, member signatures and symbols. The symbols were meant to represent the four personas of the group and included a skull and crossbones for Gene Simmons, a rose and star with eye for Stanley, a Saturn-like planet and block print-style \"ACE\" for Frehley, and a drum and cat's head for Peter Criss. The rose and \"ACE\" are copies of Stanley and Frehley's actual tattoos, respectively. A merchandise order form was also included with the album, listing an array of official Kiss merchandise as well as a chance to \"enlist\" in the Kiss Army. The inner sleeves depicted crazed Kiss fans in a confetti storm and the band's album discography to date.\n\n\"Alive II\" was originally reissued as a double-CD set in what has now become known as a \"fatboy\" 2CD case. When the Kiss back catalog was remastered, it was housed in a slimline 2CD case and, in keeping with the rest of the reissue program, had the artwork restored. This included the set of tattoos. The booklet \"The Evolution of Kiss\"' and the picture inner sleeves were incorporated as part of the CD booklet. \"Alive II\" was re-released in 2006 as part of \"Kiss Alive! 1975-2000\". It included \"Rock and Roll All Nite\" (single edit version) as a bonus track. The short running time of \"Alive II\" allowed for a single CD edition in the latest release.\n\nComing off of a period of extensive touring, \"Alive II\" received a huge fan response and critical acclaim, reaching the No. 7 spot on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. The album has received praise from several critics. In a retrospective review, critic Greg Parto of AllMusic remarked that several tracks such as \"Detroit Rock City\", \"Shock Me\" and \"Shout It Out Loud\" featured an \"adrenaline-charged\" vibe. He lauded the album for showing the group in its element as an \"exciting live band\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "29429689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29429689", "title": "Anywhere Theatre Festival", "text": "Anywhere Theatre Festival\n\nAnywhere Festival is an annual Brisbane based festival for performance anywhere but traditional theatre spaces. The first anywhere-but-in-a-traditional-theatre concept was brought to Brisbane in 2011 by creative director Paul Osuch and his partner, Ally McTavish. Their theory is that we need to take traditional story-telling out of theatre buildings and back to where life really takes place, in the community.\n\nThe festival – which holds performances anywhere but in a traditional theatre – began in 2011 with 4000 attendees and 31 productions. Since it began, the Anywhere Festival (they dropped the \"Theatre\" in 2015) has grown in size and popularity as it inhabited the nooks and crannies of this city of ours \n\nThe idea behind Anywhere is that the art of theatre should not be constrained by, well, a theatre nor by a time frame of two plus hours with interval, or even a genre.\n\nThe idea behind Anywhere Festival is that you don't - you shouldn't - have to go to a traditional theatre space to see theatre. You shouldn't have to pay a lot of money for tickets, and artists shouldn't be limited by space or cost or time. For 10 days this month, you can see exciting theatre in parks, backyards, bedrooms, lifts, trains and even on Twitter, not just in Brisbane but as far away as Toowoomba to the west, and Yandina to the north.\n\n\"The festival is about theatre anywhere but in a theatre,\" explains Paul Osuch, the mastermind behind the festival. He started Anywhere with his wife, Alex McTavish. \"I could see people wanted exciting theatre that didn't have to happen in a theatre,\" he says. \"What kicked it over the line was when English actor Ian McKellen couldn't find a theatre space in Brisbane to bring his acclaimed Waiting for Godot. I figured that if he had trouble getting into a Brisbane theatre there were probably a lot of less-well-known theatre producers with the same problem.\" \n\nIt wasn't just a lack of available theatre venues that prompted him to act. Osuch says he found many traditional theatre spaces were restrictive, both for audiences and artists, and smothered in an air of \"elitism\" that was turning people away.\n\n\"I find that most performances in a theatre space are just a little sterile. And parking's difficult, the drinks are generally overpriced and, as someone over the height of six foot, I'm not a big fan of theatre seating where I have to watch a show through the gap in my knees,\" he says. \"I feel that the traditional theatre spaces stop more people going to experience it than it regularly attracts. It's been turned into this big thing with a huge infrastructure around it instead of it being something that people feel they can pop along to in their own neighbourhood or do themselves.\" \n\n\"Ultimately, the Anywhere Festival is about entertainment and theatre but it is also about encouraging businesses to engage with their community in a new way\", says co-founder and creative producer, Alex McTavish.\" \"It may seem like it is a simple arts festival but community and communion is what it's all about,\" she says.\n\nThe festival is held in Brisbane, Mackay, Frankston and Parramatta.\n\nThe festival began in 2011 as the Anywhere Theatre Festival, Brisbane but became known as the Anywhere Festival in 2014 to expand its remit beyond traditional \"theatre\". It was created and directed by Paul Osuch and Ally McTavish.\n\nIn 2014, the first Anywhere Festival was presented in Frankston and in 2015 grew to include Brisbane, Mackay, Dysart, Middlemount, Moranbah Parramatta and Frankston.\n\nThe 2011 Anywhere Theatre Festival included cabaret, circus, comedy, drama, site specific theatre and kids theatre features productions by Riot Stage, underground Productions, Black Fox Theatre, Divalution, Cracked Pavement, Rag Tag Productions, Somerset Mills Productions, Flipside Circus, Roundabout theatre, Queensland Arts Council, Gumball Theatre, Edge Improv, Spangles Aura Productions, Booster cushion, The Deconverters, Fractal Theatre, Queensland Shakespeare Ensemble, Two Hours Traffic, Circa Zoolings, Cradle Productions, Michael Weston Organisation, Soapbox Theatre, Circa Zoo, allison Manson and Imploding Fictions.\n\nThe 2012 Anywhere Theatre Festival ran from 10 to 19 May 2012 and included the following organisations and theatre practitioners: Arts Queensland, Queensland Theatre Company, Brighton Fringe, Markwell Presents Cinematic Theatre Co, Underground Productions, The Alleyway Collective, Cradle Productions, ELaRT Productions, Hannah Taylor, Tease, Black Fox Theatre, La Petite Famille, 2Muse Productions, Egg Festivals Inc., Musica Viva, Arts Support, Sarah Reinking, La Boite, Stage On Screen, Metro Arts, Woodfordian Institute of Street Performances (WISP), SeeD Theatre, Fixate Productions, HolePunch, Synestheatre, Tessa Waters, Mager & Smythe, Lucy Ingham & Alexander Baden Bryce, Australian Actors Network, Jennifer Bismire, 8 Wing Theatre Co., Two Hours Traffic, heartBeast- vicious theatre ensemble, Flipside Circus, Queensland Wind Orchestra, Oxford Girl Theatre Project, Hidden Room, Edrich, Queensland Shakespeare Ensemble, Belles of Hell, Marcus Lilley Artist, Small Crown Productions, Sandra Carluccio, UQ Drama, Medley Theatre Company, Babushka, Circa.\n\nThe 2013 Anywhere Theatre Festival changed from a ten-day to twelve-day festival, running from 8 to 19 May.\n\nThe 2014 Anywhere Festival ran from 7 to 18 May and included 420 performances of 67 different productions over 27 suburbs of Brisbane. It featured cabaret, circus, comedy, drama, site specific theatre and kids theatre. Festival director Paul Osuch said this year's event, running May 7 to 18, would see pubs, hotels, shops, cafes, parks, churches, homes and even a garage serve as a venue for a range of theatre, dance, music, circus and comedy acts.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2847874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2847874", "title": "Azumi", "text": "Azumi\n\n\"Azumi\" was originally published by Shogakukan and serialized in \"Big Comic Superior\", and received an Excellence Prize at the 1997 Japan Media Arts Festival and the Shogakukan Manga Award in 1998. The manga was later adapted to two feature films starring Aya Ueto (2003's \"Azumi\" and 2005's \"\"), and a video game and a stage play in 2005.\n\n\"Azumi\" focuses upon the life of the titular young female assassin. The manga begins an indeterminate number of years after the Battle of Sekigahara. As Azumi begins her duty, the manga introduces its characters into mainstream history. Many of the early missions that Azumi undertakes are the assassinations of the prominent supporters and generals of the Toyotomi clan, against whom Tokugawa Ieyasu expected to again go to war. The manga \"reveals\" that many of the Toyotomi leaders who conveniently died of diseases or accidents prior to the final confrontation between the Toyotomi and Tokugawa were actually victims of assassinations by Azumi and her comrades, thus indicating to the reader when the events were taking place.\n\nAzumi is raised by an old man known as Jiji (Grandfather), whose name is later revealed to be Gensai Obata, as the only girl among ten students. They are secluded from the society in a tiny valley called Kiridani (Fog Valley) to such an extent that they do not know the difference between men and women, what a baby is, or customs like marriage. Early in the manga, as part of their training, Azumi and her comrades are ordered to go to Shimotani, a hidden community of ninja who became farmers, to learn the basics of ninjutsu. The manga sets a very chilling tone early on. The 10 \"erabareta senshi\" (chosen warriors), who are all young children (Azumi has her first period well after her first missions, so she appears to be somewhere between 10–12 years of age at the onset of the manga) are told by Jiji that they have completed their training. For their first mission, they are to form a pair with whomever among the 10 that they feel the closest. Azumi pairs with Nachi, and all others pair with their closest friends. Having formed the pairs, Jiji tells them their first mission is to kill their partner—whoever is too weak to kill their partner is too weak to fulfill their life's missions, and will not be allowed to survive. The ten children each fight their respective duels, and Azumi slays Nachi, an event which appears to deeply traumatize Azumi, but she hides her feelings, as do the others. Then, their second mission was to massacre all 53 residents of the peaceful ninja village, including their teacher, women and children, as they know of the group's existence. Azumi slays three men and four teenagers but is unable to kill a woman with baby, a task which one of her comrades quickly accomplishes.\n\nThe remaining five warriors proceed to go on assassination missions of the various important supporters of the Toyotomi faction. As the manga proceeds, it evokes various moral concepts such as the morality of assassinations (and killing in general), the dehumanization effect of politics, as well as leading the reader to question basic assumptions of right and wrong. For example, throughout much of the middle volumes of the manga (Vol. 8-19), Azumi frequently fights and kills many bandits—many of whom are depicted robbing, murdering, and raping innocent victims. Azumi does not question that her killing such bandits is right, and few readers probably question her righteousness. Later on in the manga, the political background to the reason for the banditry is revealed. The Tokugawa ruling family deposed and ended many previously prominent \"daimyō\" feudal lords who opposed them leaving the samurai and mercenaries in their employ without work or any means to live—therefore they resorted to banditry. Azumi questions whether it was right for her to have killed so many men who had been driven to banditry not by their own choice.\n\nA consistent recurring theme is the contrast between Azumi and other prominent characters. Azumi is compared to a bodhisattva—a kind of enlightened being. This is indicative of the theme in Azumi where characters around Azumi are motivated by a variety of obsessions. Some are motivated by a kind of blind idealism, others by religion, others by a lust for battle, greed, or even normally sanctified motivations like honor. Not all the forces (particularly those motivated by more noble incentives, like a pair of ninja assassins whom Azumi kills, who are participating in the planning of a revolt as the only way for a ninja community to survive) are depicted as if their single-minded drive towards their goals are somehow evil. However, nonetheless, in each case, those who are attached intensely to something in the world are killed by Azumi, while she, who seemingly has little attachment to the earthly world and few personal desires, survives.\n\n\"Azumi\" was loosely adapted into an action film directed by Ryuhei Kitamura in 2003. A sequel, \"Azumi 2: Death or Love\", directed by Shusuke Kaneko, followed in 2005.\n\nAn action game for PlayStation 2, based on manga's original story, was developed by Gargoyle Mechanics and released in Japan only by Entertainment Software Publishing in 2005. The game was also re-released as part of the budget-range Simple series (Vol. 32).\n\nThe theatrical version, directed by Okamura Toshikazu, premiered on April 3, 2005, starring Meisa Kuroki as Azumi.\n\n\"Azumi Original Soundtrack\" containing music from the film was released by For Life Music in 2003. Azumi figure line based on the manga version was released by figuAX in 2006.\n\n"}

The film was directed by Peter Berg and starred Taylor Kitsch, Brooklyn Decker, Rihanna, Tadanobu Asano, Alexander Skarsgård, and Liam Neeson. Filming took place in Hawaii and on . In the film, a fleet of ships are forced to do battle with an armada of extraterrestrial origin in order to thwart their destructive goals.\n\n\"Battleship\" premiered in Tokyo on April 3, 2012 and received a wide release by Universal Pictures on May 18. It received mixed to negative reviews and underperformed at the box office, making only $65 million in North America against its total gross of $303 million worldwide.\n\nIn 2005, the distant Gliese planetary system is discovered to have a potentially habitable planet and a communications array is built by NASA in Hawaii to send a transmission to contact any intelligent life. Meanwhile, Alex Hopper is arrested while attempting to impress Sam Shane. His brother, naval officer Stone, forces Alex to join the U.S. Navy in order to improve his life.\n\nIn 2012, Alex and Sam are in a relationship; Alex serves as a Tactical Actions Officer as a lieutenant aboard while Stone is the commander aboard , but Alex is in danger of receiving a disciplinary discharge. During the 2012 RIMPAC exercise, five alien spacecraft arrive. Their communications ship collides with a satellite and crashes in Hong Kong while the other four land in the waters off Hawaii. \"Sampson\", \"John Paul Jones\", and their Japanese sister ship JDS are ordered by Admiral Terrance Shane to investigate, and they discover a floating structure. When it is touched by Alex it generates a force field that encloses the Hawaiian Islands and separates the three ships from the fleet. Three alien warships surface and commence to engage both the \"Sampson\" and \"Myōkō\" which are destroyed, resulting in Stone's death, while the command crew of \"John Paul Jones\" are killed. With Alex assuming command as the ranking officer, they recover the survivors from \"Myōkō\" including its commanding officer, Captain Yugi Nagata. The aliens also launch drones to attack Hawaii which cause heavy damage.\n\nOn Oahu, Sam is accompanying retired U.S. Army Colonel and double amputee Mick Canales on a mountain hike. After becoming aware of the aliens' presence, they encounter scientist Cal Zapata who informs them the aliens have taken over the communications array, and Mick determines that they are planning to use it to re-establish military communications with their home planet. Aboard \"John Paul Jones\", naval personnel capture a semi-conscious alien. The alien forms a telepathic link with Alex, showing him their history of destroying worlds. Other aliens arrive and retrieve their comrade, but are prevented from sabotaging the ship. Examination of the captured alien's helmet reveals the aliens are sensitive to sunlight. Ashore, Sam, Nick and Zapata recover his spectrum analyzer from the aliens and they use it to radio \"John Paul Jones\" to inform them the aliens intend military telecommunication with their home planet in four hours.\n\nCaptain Nagata suggests to use National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's tsunami warning buoys around Hawaii to track the alien warships. This allows \"John Paul Jones\" to destroy two of them. At dawn, they lure the remaining warship eastwards as Alex and Nagata shoot out its bridge windows, blinding its crew and allowing \"John Paul Jones\" to destroy it, but \"John Paul Jones\" is subsequently sunk by alien drones.\n\nThe survivors return to Pearl Harbor and commandeer the previously decommissioned World War II battleship with the aid of the retired veterans preserving her, restoring her to battle readiness and confronting the floating structure, revealed to be a giant mothership. \"Missouri\" is able to severely damage the mothership and disable the force field, while Admiral Shane scrambles a flight of Royal Australian Air Force Boeing F/A-18 fighter jets from aircraft carrier . Meanwhile, Sam, Mick and Cal attempt to stall the aliens at the communications array. As the mothership rallies against \"Missouri\", Alex uses their last shell to destroy the communications array. All hope is lost for \"Missouri\" and those onboard until the Australian fighter jets arrive in time and destroy the mothership, saving \"Missouri\" and eliminating the alien threat.\n\nA ceremony is held to honor the military personnel, where Alex is promoted to lieutenant commander and presented with both a Silver Star and his brother's posthumous Navy Cross. After the ceremony, Alex asks Sam's father Admiral Shane for her hand in marriage. The admiral initially refuses, but then invites Alex to lunch to discuss the matter.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, three teenagers and a handyman in Scotland discover a crashed alien pod. When they open it, an alien hand reaches out, and they run off in terror.\n\n\n\"Battleship\" was to begin filming in Australia's Gold Coast in 2010, but the production company changed location due to a lack of Australian government tax incentives and a high estimated budget of $209 million.\n\nFilming took place in the United States on the Hawaiian islands of Maui and Oahu, as well as in Sherman Oaks, California to do a few apartment scenes and in Playa del Rey, California where they filmed a driving scene along with a shootout. Further filming was done on . Some scenes were also filmed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\n\nThe Science & Entertainment Exchange provided science consultation for the film.\n\nA of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force also appeared in the film.\n\nJeremy Renner was originally considered for the role of Hopper, but the actor chose to star in a Paul Thomas Anderson drama filming at roughly the same time. In April 2010, it was reported that Taylor Kitsch had been cast as Alex Hopper, Alexander Skarsgård played his brother Stone Hopper, Brooklyn Decker stars as Sam, Hopper's fiancee and Liam Neeson as Admiral Shane, Sam's father and Hopper's superior officer. Barbadian R&B singer Rihanna makes her acting debut in the film, as a sailor. In an interview with \"GQ\", Berg explained how he came up with the idea to cast her. He realized she could act after her appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\". She accepted the role because she wanted \"to do something badass\" and also because it wasn't a role too big for her to play.\nTadanobu Asano also has a role in the film as the commander of a Japanese \"Kongō\"-class destroyer. Double amputee U.S. Army Colonel Gregory Gadson, who had never acted before, plays LTC Mick Canales. He was cast after Berg saw a picture of him in the \"National Geographic Magazine\".\n\nThe film marks the reunion between former co-stars Kitsch and Jesse Plemons, who previously worked together on Berg's TV series \"Friday Night Lights\". Berg said he loves working with friends and explained he knew how comfortable Kitsch was with Plemons, \"I know that he’s really good for Taylor and he makes Taylor better. So, I wrote that whole part for Jesse.\" He added, \"I never thought of it as a \"Friday Night Lights\" reunion. I thought of it as protection, bringing a trusted family member in.\"\n\nU.S. Navy sailors were used as extras in various parts of this film. Sailors from assorted commands in Navy Region Hawaii assisted with line handling to take in and out of port for a day of shooting in mid 2010. A few months later, the production team put out a casting call for sailors stationed at various sea commands at Naval Station Mayport, Florida to serve as extras. Sailors were also taken from various ships stationed at Naval Station Mayport, Jacksonville, Florida: , and USS were some of the ships that provided sailors.\n\nDue to his success with the \"Transformers\" franchise, composer Steve Jablonsky was chosen to score the official soundtrack. The soundtrack features original compositions from Jablonsky and features rock guitarist Tom Morello from Rage Against The Machine. Director Peter Berg stated:\n\nAll songs written and composed by Steve Jablonsky except where noted.\n\n\nThe film was originally planned to be released in 2011, but was rescheduled to May 18, 2012, in the United States. The film's world premiere took place in Tokyo on April 3, 2012. The event was attended by director Peter Berg, actors Taylor Kitsch, Brooklyn Decker, Alexander Skarsgård and Rihanna. Later on they initiated a Press Tour visiting Madrid, London and Cartagena de Indias to promote the film.\n\nThe film earned $303,025,485, and only $65,422,625 in North America. With a budget of $209 million the film did not meet its expectations.\n\nThe film opened outside North America on Wednesday, April 11, 2012, more than five weeks before its North America release, earning $7.4 million. Through Friday, April 13, the film had earned a 3-day total of $25 million. By the end of its opening weekend, it earned $55.2 million from 26 markets, ranking second behind the 3D re-release of \"Titanic\".\n\nHowever, on its second weekend, it topped the box office outside North America, with $60 million. In South Korea, it achieved the highest-grossing opening day for a non-sequel and the third-highest overall ($2.8 million). In comparison to other Hasbro films, \"Battleship\" opening in the UK (£3.76 million) was behind the first \"Transformers\" (£8.72 million), but did better than \"\" (£1.71 million).\n\nIn North America, \"Battleship\" grossed $8.8 million on its opening day (Friday, May 18, 2012), with $420,000 originating from midnight showings, and finished the weekend with $25.5 million. It settled in second place for its opening day and opening weekend behind \"Marvel's The Avengers\".\n\nMetacritic has given the film an average score of 41 out of 100 based on 39 reviews meaning \"mixed or average reviews\". Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 34% based on reviews from 217 critics, with a rating average of 4.6/10. The site's consensus reads: \"It may offer energetic escapism for less demanding filmgoers, but \"Battleship\" is too loud, poorly written, and formulaic to justify its expense -- and a lot less fun than its source material.\"\n\nMegan Lehmann of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" thought that the \"impressive visual effects and director Peter Berg's epic set pieces fight against an armada of cinematic clichés and some truly awful dialogue.\" \"Empire\" magazine's Nick de Semlyen felt there was a lack of character development and memorable action shots, and sums up his review of the movie in one word: \"Miss.\"\n\nMany reviews criticised the \"based on a board game\" concept driving the film, although some, such as Jason Di Rosso from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National, claimed the ridiculousness of the setup is \"either sheer joy or pure hell – depending on how seriously you take it\", while de Semlyen \"had to admire [the film's creators] jumping through hoops to engineer a sequence that replicates the board game.\" Several compared the film to Michael Bay's \"Transformers\" film series in terms of quality and cinematic style, with Giles Hardie of \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" claiming that the movie \"finds the same balance between action-packed imagination and not taking the premise seriously that made Michael Bay's original \"Transformers\" such a joyride.\" Andrew Harrison of \"Q\" magazine called the film \"crushingly stupid\". Film critic Kenneth Turan, in a review written for the \"Los Angeles Times\", also expressed disappointment, criticizing the film's \"humanoid aliens\", stating that they are \"as ungainly as the movie itself, clunking around in awkward, protective suits.\" He called the content \"all very earnest\", but added \"it's not a whole lot of fun\". Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" gave the film one out of four stars, and he comment \"Battleship is all noise and crashing metal, sinking to the shallows of Michael Bay's Armageddon and then digging to the brain-extinction level of the Transformers trilogy.\"\n\nOther critics were less harsh for \"Battleship\": Writing for \"Time\", Steven James Snyder was somewhat positive because he had low expectations of the film. He wrote, \"The creative team behind this ocean-bound thriller decided to fill the narrative black hole with a few ingredients all but absent from today’s summer tent poles – namely mystery, nostalgia and a healthy dose of humility\" and described it as \"an unlikely mix of \"Independence Day\", \"Pearl Harbor\", \"Jurassic Park\" and \"The Hunt for Red October\"\". Giving it a B+ grade, Lisa Schwarzbaum of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said, \"For every line of howler dialogue that should have been sunk, there's a nice little scene in which humans have to make a difficult decision. For every stretch of generic sci-fi-via-CGI moviemaking, there's a welcome bit of wit.\" \"The Washington Post\" gave the film a three-star rating out of four commenting it is \"an invigorating blast of cinematic adrenaline\". Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film 2½ stars out of 4, praising the climax as \"an honest-to-God third act, instead of just settling for nonstop fireballs and explosions, as Bay likes to do. I don't want to spoil it for you. Let's say the Greatest Generation still has the right stuff and leave it at that.\"\n\n\"Battleship\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray disc on August 20, 2012 in the United Kingdom, and on August 28 in the United States and Canada. Its revenue was $32.4 million. Battleship was released on 4K Blu-Ray on January 17, 2017.\n\nA video game based on the film, titled \"Battleship: The Video Game\", was released on May 15, 2012 to coincide with the film's international release. The game was published by Activision and developed by Double Helix Games for PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360, and developed by Magic Pockets for Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo DS.\n\nHasbro released several new editions of the classic board game, including an update to the regular fleet-vs.-fleet game and a \"movie edition\", featuring the alien vessels and a card-based play mode.\n\n\n"}

While he received star billing in vaudeville, he was best known for his prolific work in the recording studio, making records for almost every record label of the era.\n\nBilly Murray was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Patrick and Julia (Kelleher) Murray, immigrants from County Kerry, Ireland. His parents moved to Denver, Colorado in 1882, where he grew up. He became fascinated with the theater and joined a traveling vaudeville troupe in 1893. He also performed in minstrel shows early in his career. In 1897 Murray made his first recordings for Peter Bacigalupi, the owner of a phonograph company in San Francisco. As of 2010 none of Murray's cylinder records with Bacigalupi are known to have survived. In 1903, he started recording regularly in New York City and New Jersey area, where major record companies in the U.S. as well as the Tin Pan Alley music industry were concentrated.\n\nIn 1906, he recorded the first of his popular duets with Ada Jones. He also performed with Aileen Stanley, the Haydn Quartet, the American Quartet (also known as the Premier Quartet), and Elsie Baker as well as performed solo work.\n\nNicknamed \"The Denver Nightingale\", Murray had a strong tenor voice with excellent enunciation and a conversational delivery compared with bel canto singers of the era. On comic songs, he often deliberately sang slightly flat, which he felt helped the comic effect. Although he often performed romantic numbers and ballads which sold well, his comedy and novelty song recordings continue to be popular with later generations of record collectors.\n\nMurray was a devoted baseball fan, and he is said to have played with the New York Highlanders (Yankees) in exhibition games. He also supposedly sometimes called in sick to recording sessions in order to go to the ballpark. Murray recorded \"Tessie, You Are the Only, Only, Only\", which became the unofficial theme of the 1903 World Series, when the words were changed from \"Tessie, you know I love you madly\" to \"Honus, why do you hit so badly?\"\n\nMurray's popularity faded as public taste changed and recording technology advanced; the rise of the electric microphone in the mid-1920s coincided with the era of the crooners. His \"hammering\" style, as he called it, essentially yelling the song into an acoustic recording horn, did not work in the electrical era, and he had to learn to soften his voice.\n\nThough his singing style was less in demand, he continued to find recording work. By the late 1920s and early 1930s, the music from his early days was considered nostalgic, and Murray was in demand again. He did voices for animated cartoons, especially the popular \"follow the bouncing ball\" sing-along cartoons and the Fleischer Studios character Bimbo. He also did radio work. In 1929, Murray and Walter Scanlon provided the voices for the Fleischer short animation film \"Finding His Voice\", produced by Western Electric.\n\nMurray made his last recordings for Beacon Records on February 11, 1943 with Jewish dialect comedian Monroe Silver. He retired the next year to Freeport, Long Island, New York because of heart problems. He died at nearby Jones Beach of a heart attack in 1954 at the age of 77. Murray had married three times, the first two ending in divorce. He was survived by his third wife, Madeleine, and is buried in the Cemetery of the Holy Rood in Westbury, New York.\n\nDecades later, \"You're a Grand Old Rag\", and \"Shine On, Harvest Moon\", two of his songs would be heard in BioShock Infinite. the former being heard faintly in one of the reveal trailers, and the latter being heard in The Fellow Traveller Pub.\n\nThis list is confined primarily to songs which have Wikipedia articles:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "42902154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42902154", "title": "Camargo Society", "text": "Camargo Society\n\nThe Camargo Society was a London society which created and produced ballet between 1930 and 1933, giving opportunity to British musicians, choreographers, designers and dancers. Its influence was disproportionate to its short life. Dame Ninette de Valois, founder of The Royal Ballet, saw it as \"having done much for the cause of English ballet\", and Encyclopædia Britannica Online credits it with \"keeping ballet alive in England during the early 1930s\". The society was named after the eighteenth-century French dancer Marie Anne de Cupis de Camargo.\n\nBallets Russes had held a London season most years but when Sergei Diaghilev died in 1929 the company collapsed, heavily in debt. Its successor company had not yet been formed. Pavlova's company had given its last London season ever, as it was to die with Pavlova herself in January 1931. Marie Rambert only started the small scale Ballet Club (later Ballet Rambert) in the autumn of 1930 with its first performance in 1931, and Ninette de Valois was to found the Vic-Wells (later the Royal Ballet) in 1931 with 6 salaried dancers. International Ballet and the Festival Ballet were years away. Britain's best known dancers Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin had been in England since the collapse of Ballets Russes but had no large scale company to dance for. In 1930 serious professional ballet in London was at a low point and in the rest of the country was non-existent. \n\nThe Camargo Society was conceived by Arnold Haskell (ballet critic and prolific author) and Philip Richardson (editor of \"Dancing Times\"), and named after the 18th century ballerina Marie Camargo who first shortened her skirts and wore dancing slippers without heels. Its aim was \"to perpetuate the principles on which Diaghilev had run the Ballets Russes, as a fusion of dance, music and decor\", encouraging British talent to create ballet on a scale that could not be attempted by the Ballet Club or the fledgling Vic-Wells. The society intended to put on several Sunday evening and Monday afternoon performances each season at a West End theatre, commissioning the choreography and decor for each ballet and hiring an orchestra for each performance. The necessary funds would be provided by a subscription audience. The committee included the young composer Constant Lambert as resident conductor, the semi-retired ballerina Lydia Lopokova as choreographic advisor and her husband the eminent economist John Maynard Keynes as treasurer. Haskell himself described the society as “a management without a company”. \n\nThe society's first performance, at the Cambridge Theatre in October 1930, was a mixed programme of one-act ballets. The one received best was \"Pomona\" by the rising choreographer Frederick Ashton, in which Anton Dolin partnered the American ballerina Anna Ludmila in the lead roles. Ashton also created pieces for the December performance at the Arts Theatre Club; \"Job, A Masque of Poetry and Music\", of which the critics did not know what to make, and a series of tableaux illustrating Shakespeare's narrative poem \"A Lover's Complaint\" in which Lopokova herself took a part. In total the Camargo Society produced 16 new one-act ballets.\n\n\"Façade\", also by Ashton to William Walton's existing score of the same name, is the one that lived longest and is still remembered today. It later went into the repertoires of both the Ballet Club and the Vic-Wells, but the Vic-Wells lost their \"Façade\" sets and costumes when they fled Holland in May 1940 hours ahead of the German occupation. \n\nAfter several more modest ventures the society hired the Savoy Theatre in 1932 for an ambitious four week summer season, in which Olga Spessivtseva danced the lead parts in shortened versions of \"Giselle\" and \"Swan Lake\". This enterprise put the society seriously in debt. Its debts were cleared with two gala performances of \"Coppélia\" at the Royal Opera House in June 1933 when the major stars Markova, Dolin and Lopokova danced to full houses, including the then Queen, members of the government and a visiting international conference of economists. \n\nThis however was the society's last venture. Ninette de Valois' company was now firmly established and tackling larger productions than the Ballet Club could, and to the Vic-Wells the society bequeathed all its sets and productions except \"Façade\". Constant Lambert went to the Vic-Wells as musical director and stayed until he died in 1951. Frederick Ashton went as resident choreographer and stayed to become Director when de Valois retired, as well as a choreographer of world repute. Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin went there as principal dancers. They only stayed 2 years, but by the time they moved on to form their own company Robert Helpmann and Harold Turner and the 16-year-old Margot Fonteyn were able to take on their roles. The Vic-Wells would perhaps have grown to the stature of the Royal Ballet without the Camargo Society, but there is no doubt that the Camargo Society helped the Vic Wells considerably in its formative phase.\n\n"}

{"id": "374187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=374187", "title": "Dyrehavsbakken", "text": "Dyrehavsbakken\n\nDyrehavsbakken (\"The Animal Park's Hill\"), commonly referred to as Bakken (\"The Hill\"), is an amusement park near Klampenborg (Gentofte municipality), but which belongs under Lyngby-Taarbæk Kommune, Denmark, about 10 km north of central Copenhagen.\nIt opened in 1583 and is the world's oldest operating amusement park.\n\nWith 2.5-2.7 million visitors per year, it is the second most popular attraction in Denmark, after the more widely known Tivoli Gardens amusement park.\n\nThe origins of Dyrehavsbakken can be traced back to 1583 when Kirsten Piil discovered a natural spring in what is now known as Jægersborg Dyrehave or Dyrehaven, a large forest park north of Copenhagen. Residents of Copenhagen were attracted to the spring water due to the poor water quality in central Copenhagen during this period. Many believed the natural spring to have curative properties, and therefore Piil's discovery drew large crowds, especially in the springtime. These large crowds attracted entertainers and hawkers, whose presence are the origins of the amusement park today.\n\nFor a period the area that the spring was located on, was not open to the public due to it being on royal hunting grounds. In 1669, King Frederick III decided to set up an animal park in the area and his son, Christian V, extended the size of the park by 3-4 times after he became king in 1670. The area was named Jægersborg Dyrehave, its present name, in 1671. The park was off-limits to the general public under Christian V and this did not change until 1756, under Frederick V.\n\nOpen to the general public once again, Dyrehavsbakken began to flourish. The entertainers, hawkers, and innkeepers returned to the area, and Bakken's growing reputation throughout Europe attracted other entertainers and artists, including Pjerrot, the clown who still is a fixture at the park today. Bakken continued to grow even throughout the Napoleonic Wars. Its popularity was later aided by easier accessibility due to the development of steamships (1820) and railroads (1864), as well as good publicity from poets and authors.\n\nAs the popularity of Bakken grew, its conditions worsened. As a result, some of the business owners, or \"tent owners\" as they are still called today, created the Dyrehavsbakken Tent Owners’ Association of 1885. The association improved garbage collection, restroom facilities, water supply, publicity, and helped bring electricity to the park. The association is still around today, and all businesses operating in the park are required to join.\n\nThe entertainment options also improved over time. Cabarets such as Sansouci, which opened in 1866, and Bakkens Hvile, which opened in 1877, became increasingly popular. The 20th century brought other popular ventures, such as the Circus Revue and automated moving rides. Over time, more modern rides and entertainment options have been introduced.\n\nBakken may have started as a place to get clean spring water, but today it is a thriving amusement park filled with modern rides and amenities. Bakken is home to six roller coasters, the most famous of which is \"Rutschebanen\" (Danish for \"The Roller Coaster\"), a wooden roller coaster open since 1932. \"Rutschebanen\" has been deemed an American Coaster Enthusiasts Coaster Classic. The park is also home to dozens of other amusements and smaller rides suited for all ages.\n\nEach of the rides requires a certain number of coupons.\n\n\n\nBakken contains many other entertainment options in addition to rides. This includes 7 different Gaming Halls that have carnival-style games, slot machines, and dancing. The park's mascot, Pjerrot the clown, performs everyday for young children. The park is also home to Bakkens Hvile music hall, where cabarets are common, as well as the Circus Revue, a live circus-style performance. There are also live music performances in lounges and bars across the park on a regular basis.\n\nThe park is home to dozens of restaurants of all tastes and price ranges. The style of restaurants range from standard amusement park street food vendors, to buffets, to fancier wine-and-dine restaurants. The type of food represented ranges from standard amusement park fare, such as hamburgers and cotton candy, to tradition Danish cuisine, such as Pølser (Danish hot dogs), Æbleskiver (Danish popovers), and Smørrebrød (open-faced sandwiches), to many other types of international cuisine. Bakken also contains numerous bars and lounges, where popular Danish beer such as Carlsberg and Tuborg are served.\n\nBakken is open daily from the end of March through the end of August. Entrance into the park area is free, but rides and attractions require money. Price depends on the ride or attraction. Discounted coupons, wristbands, and season passes can also be purchased.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44916873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44916873", "title": "Gambling in Massachusetts", "text": "Gambling in Massachusetts\n\nSeveral forms of gambling are legal in the U.S. state of Massachusetts.\n\nParimutuel wagering on horse racing is allowed at the state's two active racetracks, Plainridge Racecourse and Suffolk Downs. Simulcast wagering on horse and dog races is also offered at Raynham Park, which previously operated as a dog racing track.\n\nBetting on horse and dog racing was legalized in 1934. \n\nThe first dog tracks were Wonderland Greyhound Park and Taunton Dog Track, opened in 1935. They were joined in 1941 by Raynham Greyhound Park. The Taunton track closed in 1981, and its operations were absorbed into the Raynham track, which became known as Raynham-Taunton Greyhound Park. Both remaining tracks closed by the end of 2009, when dog racing was banned by the Massachusetts Greyhound Protection Act.\n\nHarness racing began in 1947 at Bay State Raceway (later named Foxboro Raceway). Suffolk Downs included the sport in its calendar from 1959 to 1970. Foxboro closed in 1997 and was replaced in 1999 with the opening of Plainridge.\n\nIn addition to the major tracks, wagering was also conducted on horse and dog races at agricultural fairs around the state, including the Northampton Fair, Marshfield Fair, Great Barrington Fair, Weymouth Fair, Berkshire County Fair (at Berkshire Downs), Brockton Fair, and Topsfield Fair. Race fixing was notoriously common at these meets. This fair circuit came to an end when the last remaining venue, Northampton, held its final racing meet in 2005.\n\nThe Massachusetts Lottery offers draw games and scratchcards. The Lottery also offers pull tabs for sale at bars.\n\nPrivate lotteries were common in early colonial history, but as public attitudes turned against them, Massachusetts banned all lotteries in 1719. The province's first public lottery was authorized in 1745, to pay for expenses related to King George's War. At least fifteen lotteries were authorized from 1749 to 1761, until the Lords of Trade expressed their disapproval of the practice, effectively banning public lotteries in Massachusetts until the American Revolution, when lotteries again became frequent, until a new ban was enacted in 1833. The modern Lottery was created in 1971 and held its first drawings the following year.\n\nEligible non-profit organizations are allowed to operate certain gambling games for fundraising purposes, including bridge and whist, bingo (also called \"beano\"), raffles, pull tabs, and casino nights (referred to as \"bazaars\"). Senior citizen organizations (\"golden age clubs\") are also allowed to run bingo games with little oversight, with prizes of $100 or less. \n\nAs of 2013, the total annual gross revenues reported for charitable gaming were about $66.5 million, with $33 million from bingo, $13 million from pull tabs, $20 million from raffles, and $400,000 from bazaars. There were 157 licensed charitable bingo operators.\n\nSeveral poker rooms throughout the state operate under the casino night law, with daily games benefitting a rotating set of charities.\n\nWhist and bridge fundraisers were legalized in 1932. Beano was legalized in 1934, but then banned in 1943 because racketeers were operating games using charities as fronts. Raffles and bazaars were authorized in 1969. Beano was re-legalized in 1971, with a local election required in each city or town to allow it.\n\nBoth of the state's federally recognized tribes have worked for several years to open gaming facilities on tribal lands, under the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe hopes to open a casino on land in Taunton. The Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah) plans a small gaming facility in Aquinnah, on Martha's Vineyard.\n\nThe Mashpee tribe gained federal recognition in 2007. Their casino, referred to as Project First Light, would be located in what is currently an industrial park, which they have applied to the federal government to take into trust, making it sovereign tribal land.\n\nThe Aquinnah tribe announced plans in 2013 for their Class II gaming facility in an unfinished community center on their reservation. The state quickly sued to block the project, arguing that the tribe gave up gambling rights in a 1983 land settlement, in which the tribe agreed its lands would be subject to state law. The tribe argues that this agreement was superseded by the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.\n\nUnder the Expanded Gaming Act, passed in 2011, as many as three casino resorts and one slot parlor can be opened. A slot parlor opened at Plainridge Park Casino in June 2015, and a casino resort, MGM Springfield, opened in 2018. Another casino resort, Encore Boston Harbor, is under development as of 2018 and scheduled to open in 2019. One more casino license may be issued for the southeastern part of the state, but the process has been delayed due to uncertainty about potential competition from the planned Mashpee Wampanoag casino.\n\nGambling boats have operated at times out of Massachusetts harbors, taking passengers on \"cruises to nowhere\" in federal waters, where state gambling laws do not apply. The first was the Vegas Express cruise, which sailed out of Gloucester from 1998 to 1999. The Southern Elegance and the El Dorado set out from Gloucester starting in 1999, as did the Midnight Gambler out of Lynn, before it moved to Provincetown and operated for six weeks in 2000. Another boat, run by Atlantic Casino Cruises, ran out of Gloucester from 2002 to 2003. The Lynn harbor also played host to the Horizon's Edge casino cruise, from 2000 to 2009, and the Aquasino, which ran for several months in 2013.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22144990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22144990", "title": "Iron Man 3", "text": "Iron Man 3\n\nIron Man 3 (stylized onscreen as Iron Man Three) is a 2013 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Iron Man, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2008's \"Iron Man\" and 2010's \"Iron Man 2\", and the seventh film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Shane Black from a screenplay he co-wrote with Drew Pearce, and stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, alongside Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Rebecca Hall, Stéphanie Szostak, James Badge Dale, Jon Favreau, and Ben Kingsley. In \"Iron Man 3\", Tony Stark deals with the stress and trauma caused by the events of \"The Avengers\", while investigating a string of terrorist attacks led by the mysterious Mandarin, and comes into a conflict with an old enemy: Aldrich Killian.\n\nAfter the release of \"Iron Man 2\" in May 2010, Favreau, who served as director, decided not to return, and in February 2011 Black was hired to write and direct the film. Black and Pearce opted to make the script more character-centric and focused on thriller elements, which also uses concepts from the \"Extremis\" story arc by Warren Ellis. Throughout April and May 2012, the film's supporting cast was filled out, with Kingsley, Pearce, and Hall brought in to portray key roles. Filming began on May 23, and lasted through December 17, 2012, primarily at EUE/Screen Gems Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina. Additional shooting took place at various locations around North Carolina, as well as Florida, China, and Los Angeles. The visual effects were handled by 17 companies, including Scanline VFX, Digital Domain, and Weta Digital. The film was converted to 3D in post-production.\n\n\"Iron Man 3\" premiered at the Grand Rex in Paris on April 14, 2013, and released in the United States on May 3. The film received praise for its performances, visual effects, action sequences, humor, story, and Brian Tyler's musical score, while reception to its plot twist was mixed. It was a huge box office success, grossing over $1.2 billion worldwide, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 2013 overall, and the second-highest-grossing film released in 2013 in the United States and Canada. It became the sixteenth film to gross over $1 billion and the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time, with its opening weekend ranking as the sixth-highest-grossing opening of all time. The film received a nomination for the Academy Award in the category of Best Visual Effects, and received another nomination for the BAFTA Award in the same category.\n\nAt a New Year's Eve party in 1999, Tony Stark meets scientist Maya Hansen, the inventor of experimental regenerative treatment Extremis that allows recovery from crippling injuries. Disabled scientist Aldrich Killian offers them a place in his company Advanced Idea Mechanics, but Stark rejects him. In 2013, Stark is having panic attacks due to his experiences during the alien invasion and subsequent Battle of New York. Restless, he has built dozens of Iron Man suits, creating friction with his girlfriend Pepper Potts.\n\nA string of bombings by a terrorist known as the Mandarin has left intelligence agencies bewildered by a lack of forensic evidence. Stark's security chief Happy Hogan is badly injured in a Mandarin attack, causing Stark to issue a televised threat to the Mandarin, who responds by destroying Stark's home with gunship helicopters. Hansen, who came to warn Stark, survives the attack with Potts. Stark escapes in an Iron Man suit, which his artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S. pilots to rural Tennessee, following a flight plan from Stark's investigation into the Mandarin. Stark's experimental armor lacks sufficient power to return to California, and the world believes him dead.\n\nTeaming with Harley, a precocious 10-year-old boy, Stark investigates the remains of a local explosion bearing the hallmarks of a Mandarin attack. He discovers the \"bombings\" were triggered by soldiers subjected to Extremis whose bodies explosively rejected the treatment. These explosions were falsely attributed to a terrorist plot in order to cover up Extremis's flaws. Stark witnesses Extremis firsthand when Mandarin agents Brandt and Savin attack him. Meanwhile, Killian resurfaces and kidnaps Potts and Hansen. American intelligence agencies continue to search for the Mandarin's location, with James Rhodes—the former War Machine, now re-branded as the Iron Patriot—lured into a trap to steal his Iron Man-like armor.\n\nWith Harley's help, Stark traces the Mandarin to Miami and infiltrates his headquarters using improvised weapons. Inside he discovers the Mandarin is actually an English actor named Trevor Slattery, who is oblivious to the actions carried out in his image. Killian, who appropriated Hansen's Extremis research as a cure for his own disability and expanded the program to include injured war veterans, reveals he is the real Mandarin behind Slattery's cover. After capturing Stark, Killian reveals that he has subjected Potts to Extremis in the hope that Stark will help fix Extremis's flaws while trying to save her. Killian kills Hansen when she tries to stop him.\n\nStark escapes and reunites with Rhodes, discovering that Killian intends to attack President Ellis aboard Air Force One, using Rhodes armor. Stark saves some surviving passengers and crew but cannot stop Killian from abducting Ellis and destroying Air Force One. They trace Killian to an impounded damaged oil tanker where Killian intends to kill Ellis on live television. The Vice President will become a puppet leader, following Killian's orders in exchange for Extremis to cure his young daughter's disability. On the platform, Stark goes to save Potts, as Rhodes saves the president. Stark summons his Iron Man suits, controlled remotely by J.A.R.V.I.S., to provide air support. Rhodes secures the president and takes him to safety, while Stark discovers Potts has survived the Extremis procedure. However, before he can save her, a rig collapses around them and she falls to her apparent death. Stark confronts Killian and traps him in an Iron Man suit that self-destructs, but fails to kill him. Potts, whose Extremis powers allowed her to survive her fall, intervenes and kills Killian.\n\nStark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to remotely destroy each Iron Man suit as a sign of his devotion to Potts, while the Vice President and Slattery are arrested. With Stark's help, Potts' Extremis effects are stabilized, and Stark promises to leave his life as Iron Man behind, undergoing surgery to remove the shrapnel embedded near his heart and throwing his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea. He muses that, even without the technology, he will always be Iron Man.\n\n\nPaul Bettany reprises his role from previous films as J.A.R.V.I.S., Stark's AI system. Ty Simpkins portrays Harley Keener, a boy who becomes Stark's sidekick, as part of a three-picture deal with Marvel Studios. Ashley Hamilton portrays Taggart, one of the Extremis soldiers. William Sadler plays President Ellis, (named after Warren Ellis, who wrote the \"Extremis\" comics arc that primarily influenced the film's story) and Miguel Ferrer plays Vice President Rodriguez. Adam Pally plays Gary, a cameraman who helps Stark. Shaun Toub reprises his role as Yinsen from the first \"Iron Man\" film in a brief cameo, and Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance as a beauty pageant judge. Dale Dickey plays Mrs. Davis, mother of an Extremis subject that is framed as a terrorist. Wang Xueqi briefly plays Dr. Wu in the general release version of the film. A cut of the film produced for release exclusively in China includes additional scenes featuring Wang and an appearance by Fan Bingbing as one of his assistants. Mark Ruffalo makes an uncredited cameo appearance, reprising his role as Bruce Banner from \"The Avengers\", in a post-credits scene. Comedians Bill Maher and Joan Rivers, and \"Fashion Police\" co-host George Kotsiopoulos have cameo appearances as themselves on their respective real-world television programs, as do newscasters Josh Elliott, Megan Henderson, Pat Kiernan, and Thomas Roberts.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Iron Man 2\", a conflict between Paramount Pictures, which had distribution rights to certain Marvel properties, and The Walt Disney Company, Marvel Entertainment's then new corporate parent, clouded the timing and the distribution arrangement of a possible third film. On October 18, 2010, Walt Disney Studios agreed to pay Paramount at least $115 million for the worldwide distribution rights to \"Iron Man 3\", with Disney, Marvel, and Paramount announcing a May 3, 2013 release date for the film.\n\n\"Iron Man\" and \"Iron Man 2\" director Jon Favreau said in December 2010 that he would not direct \"Iron Man 3\", opting to direct \"Magic Kingdom\" instead. He remained an executive producer of director Joss Whedon's crossover film \"The Avengers\" and also served as an executive producer of \"Iron Man 3\". Also in 2010, Downey reached out to Shane Black, who directed him in 2005's \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\", to write and direct the film. In February 2011, Black entered final negotiations to join the project, and in March it was announced that Drew Pearce, who Marvel had originally hired for a \"Runaways\" script, would work with Black on the script. Downey said, \"Bringing in Shane Black to write and direct \"Iron Man 3\" to me is basically the only transition from Favreau to a 'next thing' that Favreau and the audience and Marvel and I could ever actually sign off on.\"\n\nShane Black described his take on the film as not being \"two men in iron suits fighting each other,\" and more like a \"Tom Clancy thriller,\" with Iron Man fighting real-world type villains. Drew Pearce added that they would avert magic and space, with \"Iron Man 3\" being \"a techno-thriller set in a more real world than even \"The Avengers\".\" The duo spent some time discussing themes and images and ideas before starting the script. While writing, the focus was to avoid scenes of pure exposition, making every moment propel other narrative points forwards. Some elements from the comics were used even if in different connotations, such as making Rhodes wear Norman Osborn's Iron Patriot armor, and naming some characters with names from unrelated people in the Marvel Universe, such as Eric Savin and Jack Taggart.\n\nThe film's plot is influenced primarily from \"Extremis,\" the 2005–2006 \"Iron Man\" comics storyline written by Warren Ellis. The first two acts would remain character-centric, albeit in Shane Black's words \"more hectic, frenetic, and large scale\" to fulfill its sequel obligations, with the third act going for more over-the-top action to what Drew Pearce described as \"giving a sense of opera.\" The middle act was compared to \"Sullivan's Travels\" in having Tony meeting various people on his journey, and the writers made sure to not make the characters too similar. The initial draft had Maya Hansen herself leading the villainous operation, with the Mandarin and Killian emerging as antagonists in later versions of the script. During one of the writing sessions, Pearce suggested that the Mandarin was a fake, and Black agreed by going with making him an actor, which in turn Pearce detailed as an overacting British stage performer. Black explained: \"Who would be fool enough to declare that is an international terrorist? If you're smart, whatever regime you're part of, you'd put a puppet committee and remain your house.\" In turn Killian would hide Slattery in \"his own frat house, in kind of a drug-related house arrest\" to keep the secret alive.\n\nAccording to Black, the reveal of the actual villain being Hansen was \"like \"Remington Steele\", you think it's the man but at the end, the woman has been running the whole show.\" The role was eventually shifted to Killian because of objections by Marvel Entertainment executives, who were concerned with apparent merchandising losses that could come with having a female villain. The roles of several other major female characters were also made smaller in the final film compared to earlier drafts.\n\nBoth the opening and the ending of the film were reworked in various ways. First it would begin with a flashback to Tony's childhood. Then like \"Iron Man\" it would begin in medias res, with Tony crashing in Tennessee before a voiceover that would lead to how he got there, until it got changed to the final version. For the climactic tanker battle, it was originally considered that Brandt would show up in the \"James Bond\" tradition of the henchman coming back for the heroes. Instead they chose to use Killian himself, and have Pepper, whom he abused earlier, cause his downfall as a way of poetic justice. The final dialogue was originally written as \"I am Tony Stark\" to be a response to the first film's ending, but eventually it changed to \"I am Iron Man\" to enhance the mythical qualities. On setting the film around Christmas, Black said \"I think it's a sense of if you're doing something on an interesting scale that involves an entire universe of characters, one way to unite them is to have them all undergo a common experience. There's something at Christmas that unites everybody and it already sets a stage within the stage, that wherever you are, you're experiencing this world together. I think that also there's something just pleasing about it to me.\" Pearce added that he would have wanted to see a third \"Iron Man\" film set at Christmas, adding that \"when you're telling a story about taking characters apart, it almost has more resonance if you put it at Christmas and if you're also telling a story about lonelier characters as well. That loneliness is heightened at Christmas.\" Black also felt the character Harley Keener embodied the Ghost of Christmas Past for Stark.\n\nIn September 2011, Marvel Studios reached an agreement to shoot the film primarily out of EUE/Screen Gems Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina. Michigan was also in contention to land the production, but the Michigan Film Office could not match North Carolina's tax incentives. In April 2012, Ben Kingsley entered into negotiations to play a villain in \"Iron Man 3\". The following week, producer Kevin Feige revealed that \"Iron Man 3\" would begin shooting in North Carolina \"in five weeks,\" and said that it \"is a full-on Tony Stark-centric movie ... very much inspired by the first half of \"Iron Man\" ... [H]e's stripped of everything, he's backed up against a wall, and he's gotta use his intelligence to get out of it. He can't call Thor, he can't call Cap, he can't call Nick Fury, and he can't look for the Helicarrier in the sky.\" A few days later, The Walt Disney Company China, Marvel Studios, and DMG Entertainment announced an agreement to co-produce \"Iron Man 3\" in China. DMG partly financed, produced in China with Marvel, and handled co-production matters. DMG also distributed the film in China in tandem with Disney.\n\nThe next week, Guy Pearce entered into final talks to play Aldrich Killian, a character who is featured in the \"Extremis\" comic book story arc. Chinese star Andy Lau became involved in negotiations to join the film, as a Chinese scientist and old friend of Stark's who comes to his aid. Lau would later turn down the role, and Wang Xueqi was cast instead. Jessica Chastain entered into discussions for a role in the film, but bowed out due to scheduling conflicts. In May, Rebecca Hall was cast in her place, and her role was described as \"a scientist who plays a pivotal role in the creation of a nanotechnology, known as Extremis.\" Over the next few weeks, James Badge Dale was cast as Eric Savin, Ashley Hamilton was cast as Firepower, and Favreau returned to reprise his role as Happy Hogan from the first two films. Stéphanie Szostak and William Sadler were also cast in the film, with Sadler playing the President of the United States. Despite erroneous early reports that Cobie Smulders would reprise her role as Maria Hill from \"The Avengers\" in the film, Smulders wrote on her verified Twitter page that this was not so.\n\nFilming began in Wilmington, North Carolina on May 23, 2012 at EUE/Screen Gems Studios, with the working title \"Caged Heat\". Cinematographer John Toll opted to for the first time in his career work with digital cameras, as he found them more convenient for a visual effects-heavy production. Toll shot the film primarily on the Arri Alexa camera. From June 4 through June 6, 2012, filming took place in Cary, North Carolina at the Epic Games headquarters and SAS Institute, with a large Christmas tree set up on the front lawn. A scene was also shot at the Wilmington International Airport. The Port of Wilmington served as a location for the oil tanker in the climactic battle, along with a soundstage recreation of the dock. The crumbling house itself was filmed in a hydraulic-powered giubo platform that could bend and split into two pieces. All the interior footage had practical effects, including debris and explosions, with computer graphics used only to add exteriors and Iron Man's armor.\n\nFrom July 19 to August 1, 2012, filming took place on Oak Island, North Carolina, to \"film aerial drops over the Atlantic Ocean.\" They were done for the scene where Iron Man rescues the people falling from the Air Force One over Miami, which were originally envisioned done with green screen effects, but were changed to using actual skydivers as second unit director Brian Smrz knew the Red Bull skydiving team. Computer graphics were only employed to add clouds, the destroyed plane and matte paintings of the Florida coastline in the background, replace a stand-in with the Iron Man armor, and some digital compositing to combine different takes of the skydivers together. Filming took place in Rose Hill, North Carolina in early August 2012, and the town's name was incorporated into the script as the Tennessee city Stark visits. On August 14, actress Dale Dickey said she had been cast in the film, and was currently shooting her scenes. The following day, production was halted when Downey suffered an ankle injury. During the break, Black and Pearce made more script revisions before shooting resumed by August 24.\n\nCast and crew began arriving in Florida on October 1, to shoot scenes on Dania Beach and around South Florida. That same day, Downey returned to the set after his ankle injury. In early October, scenes were shot at a replica of the Malibu restaurant Neptune's Net, and filming took place on location at the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens. Scenes were shot during the daytime inside the Miami Beach Resort at Miami Beach on October 10 and 11. The production returned to Wilmington in mid-October for additional filming. On November 1, scenes were shot at the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens. Filming in the United States wrapped on November 7 in Wilmington.\n\nFilming began in Beijing, China on December 10. Filming was scheduled to wrap a week later on December 17, 2012. The China filming did not include the main cast and crew. In January 2013, it was reported that a film crew led by Shane Black would begin location scouting in Hyderabad and Bengaluru, India between January 20 and 24. Also in January, Cheadle confirmed that reshooting was taking place in Manhattan Beach. Shooting also took place on the week of January 23, 2013 at TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. A major part of the content filmed in the reshoots regarded the Mandarin, with Drew Pearce saying that in early cuts, the character \"didn't feel real enough—there wasn't a sense of him being [part of] the real world, mostly because he was just looking down a lens and threatening the world.\" A report on actual production costs for films from FilmL.A. Inc., indicated a gross budget of $200 million, with a net of $178.4 million for \"Iron Man 3\" after tax incentives from North Carolina and Florida.\n\nChris Townsend served as visual effects supervisor for the film, which featured over 2,000 visual effects shots and was worked on by 17 studios, including Weta Digital, Digital Domain, Scanline VFX, Trixter, Framestore, Luma Pictures, Fuel VFX, Cantina Creative, Cinesite, The Embassy Visual Effects, Lola, Capital T, Prologue and Rise FX. Townsend said that from January 2013 through the end of filming in April, the collective crew had one day of downtime, otherwise working seven days a week and 14 to 18 hours a day.\n\nDigital Domain, Scanline VFX and Trixter each worked on separate shots featuring the Mark 42 armor, working with different digital models. The studios shared some of their files to ensure consistency between the shots. For the Mark 42 and Iron Patriot armors, Legacy Effects constructed partial suits that were worn on set. Townsend explained that \"Invariably we'd shoot a soft-suit with Robert then we'd also put tracking markers on his trousers. He would also wear lifts in his shoes or be up in a box so he'd be the correct height—Iron Man is 6'5\". During shooting we used multiple witness cams, Canon C300s, and we had two or three running whenever there was an Iron Man or Extremis character.\" The artists studied time lapse photography of decaying fruit and vegetables and actual phenomena such as the aurora borealis as reference for the effect of the glowing Extremis characters. The heads-up display features of the helmet were inspired by visualization techniques from MRI diagnostic pattern recognition and graph theory, particularly by the connectogram, a circular graph that maps all of the white-matter connections of the human brain.\n\nThe film's production was delayed following Downey's leg injury, and for certain shots they were forced to create a double for Downey. Townsend explained that \"The collective VFX [supervisors] and unit leads ran into a room as soon as the incident happened to try to ascertain what sequences could they shoot.\" Certain shots were filmed with a body double on set, and Weta Digital created a digital body double for others.\n\nA total of three hours and 15 minutes of footage were shot before editing, where it was brought down to 130 minutes (119 without the credits), marking the longest stand-alone \"Iron Man\" film. Post-production also had a 3D conversion and a digital remaster for the IMAX release. Todd-AO mixed the sound in Dolby Atmos to enhance the immersive experience.\n\nThe film is scored by Brian Tyler, who signed on in October 2012. According to Tyler, he was approached more for his \"thematic\" scores such as \"The Greatest Game Ever Played\", \"Annapolis\", and \"Partition\" rather than his \"modern\" action scores such as \"The Fast and Furious\" films, with Kevin Feige asking a theme that was recognizable and featured those dramatic tones. To employ the \"deeply thematic component with a strong melody,\" the score employs mostly orchestra sounds. The main theme for Iron Man focuses on horns and trumpets, to be \"both a march and anthem.\" Tyler mentioned that John Williams' work in \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" was the first thing he thought of as an influence, and the cue for the Well of Souls in \"Raiders\" influenced the Extremis motif, as Tyler felt it should enhance an spiritual side for having a \"technology so advanced that nears magic.\" Echoing the Mandarin's amalgamated personality, his theme was religious music \"that borrows from many cultures,\" from \"Monastic, Gothic, and Christian chants to music from the Middle-East.\" The score was recorded with the London Philharmonic Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios. Tyler is the third primary composer to score an \"Iron Man\" film, following Ramin Djawadi of \"Iron Man\" and John Debney of \"Iron Man 2\".\n\nAlong with Tyler's soundtrack album, Hollywood Records released a concept album inspired by the film, \"Heroes Fall\". It features twelve original alternative rock and indie rock songs, with only one appearing in the film itself, Awolnation's \"Some Kind of Joke.\"\n\nIn July 2012, at the San Diego Comic-Con International, a new Iron Man armor from the film, the Mark XLII, was on display on the convention floor, along with the Marks I-VII from the first two \"Iron Man\" films and \"The Avengers\". A panel was held, during which Shane Black, Robert Downey Jr., Don Cheadle, Jon Favreau and Kevin Feige discussed making the film, and several minutes of footage from the film were shown. The first television advertisement aired during Super Bowl XLVII on the CBS network in the United States. On March 25, 2013, Marvel and Disney revealed on the official \"Iron Man\" Facebook page, \"Iron Man 3: Armor Unlock,\" to reveal suits Stark has made before the events of the film. In January 2013, Marvel Comics released a two-issue comic book prelude by writers Christos Gage and Will Corona Pilgrim with art by Steve Kurth and Drew Geraci. The story set between the second and third \"Iron Man\" films centers on War Machine, revealing why he was absent during the battle in New York of \"The Avengers\".\n\nLike with the first two films, Audi again provided product placement with various vehicles. Oracle also returned from \"Iron Man 2\", showcasing both the Oracle Cloud and the Oracle Exadata server. Verizon FiOS and TCL's flat panel televisions and Alcatel One Touch smartphones are also featured in the film, and the Chinese cut also shows a Zoomlion crane and Yili milk. Promotional deals were arranged with Subway and the Schwan Food Company, and tie-ins included Lego sets, Hasbro action figures, and by Gameloft.\n\nDisney also promoted the film at its domestic theme parks. Disneyland's Innoventions attraction received a Stark Industries exhibit beginning April 13, and Monorail Black of the Walt Disney World Monorail System was given an exterior \"Iron Man\" scheme. The exhibit, entitled \"Iron Man Tech Presented by Stark Industries\", features the same armor display that was shown at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, with the Marks I-VII and the new Mark XLII. In addition, there is a simulator game, titled \"Become Iron Man,\" that uses Kinect-like technology to allow the viewer to be encased in an animated Mark XLII armor and take part in a series of \"tests,\" in which you fire repulsor rays and fly through Tony Stark's workshop. The game is guided by J.A.R.V.I.S., who is voiced again by Paul Bettany. The exhibit also has smaller displays that include helmets and chest pieces from the earlier films and the gauntlet and boot from an action sequence in \"Iron Man 3\".\n\n\"Iron Man 3\" was distributed worldwide by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures with the exception of China, where it was released by DMG Entertainment, and Germany and Austria, where it was released by Tele München Group. The Chinese version of the film offers specially prepared bonus footage made exclusively for the Chinese audience. This version features a four-minute longer cut of the film, with a scene showing Dr. Wu on the phone with Iron Man visible on a television screen behind him, as well as a longer scene of Dr. Wu operating on Stark. The extra material also features product placement for various Chinese products.\n\nThe film's premiere happened at the Grand Rex in Paris, on April 14, 2013, with Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow in attendance. While the UK premiere of the film was originally set for April 17, the funeral of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher taking place in that date made the event be pushed to the following day. Downey, Ben Kingsley and Rebecca Hall were present for the advance screening at London's Odeon Leicester Square. The El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles hosted the United States premiere of \"Iron Man 3\" on April 24. The film opened in 46 countries through April 22–24, with the United States release, in 4,253 screens, happening one week later. Regal Cinemas, AMC Theatres and Carmike Cinemas put presale tickets on hold, two weeks before the US premiere. The cinemas were in a contract dispute with Disney, who wished to receive more of the ticket sale profit than they currently did, largely based on the projected premiere-weekend intake \"Iron Man 3\" was expected to have. Carmike was the first to come to terms with Disney. It was later reported that Cinemark Theatres had also stopped selling presale tickets, and Regal Cinemas had removed all marketing material for the film from its locations. On April 25, 2013, Regal, AMC and Disney ended their dispute, which allowed Regal and AMC to proceed with selling presale tickets again.\n\nIMAX screenings began on April 25, 2013 internationally and May 3 in the United States. The film was shown in the 4DX format, featuring strobe lights, tilting seats, blowing wind and fog and odor effects in selected countries. In Japan, the technology opened its first room at the Korona World theatre in Nagoya, Japan with the release of the film.\n\n\"Iron Man 3\" was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment in digital download form on September 3, 2013. This was followed by the film's release on Blu-ray, 3D Blu-ray, DVD, digital copy, and on demand on September 24, 2013. The home video release includes a Marvel One-Shot short film titled \"Agent Carter\" starring Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter from \"\". It debuted atop the DVD and Blu-ray charts in the United States, and second in the rental charts behind \"World War Z\". , \"Iron Man 3\" is the eighth-best-selling DVD of 2013, earning more than $79 million in sales in the U.S.\n\nThe film was also collected in a 13-disc box set titled \"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two Collection\", which includes all of the Phase Two films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was released on December 8, 2015.\n\n\"Iron Man 3\" grossed $409 million in North America and $805.8 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $1.215 billion, outgrossing both of its predecessors combined. Worldwide, it became the fifth-highest-grossing film, the second-highest-grossing film of 2013, the second-highest-grossing film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (behind \"Marvel's The Avengers\"), the highest-grossing film of the \"Iron Man\" film series, the sixth-highest-grossing film distributed by Disney. It achieved the sixth-largest worldwide opening weekend with $372.5 million. On the weekend of May 3–5, 2013, the film set a record for the largest worldwide weekend in IMAX with $28.6 million. On its 23rd day in theaters, \"Iron Man 3\" became the sixth Disney film and the 16th film overall to reach $1 billion. It is the first \"Iron Man\" film to gross over $1 billion, became the second Marvel film to do so after \"The Avengers\", and was the fourth-fastest film to reach the milestone. As part of the earlier distribution agreement made with Disney in 2010, Paramount Pictures received 9% of the box office gross generated by \"Iron Man 3\". \"Deadline Hollywood\" calculated the net profit of the film to be $391.8 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film.\n\n\"Iron Man 3\" became the 13th-highest-grossing film, the second-highest-grossing 2013 film, as well as the fourth-highest-grossing comic-book and superhero film. By the end of its opening day, \"Iron Man 3\" made $68.9 million (including $15.6 million from late Thursday shows), achieving the seventh-highest-grossing opening day. By the end of its opening weekend, the film earned $174.1 million, making it the fourth-highest opening weekend of all time (behind \"Jurassic World\", \"The Avengers\", and \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\"). Of the opening-weekend audience, 55% was over 25 years old, and 61% were males, while only 45% of the gross originated from 3-D screenings. Opening-weekend earnings from IMAX amounted to $16.5 million. It topped the box office during two consecutive weekends and achieved the fifth-largest second-weekend gross with $72.5 million.\n\n\"Iron Man 3\" became the fifth-highest-grossing film, the second-highest-grossing 2013 film, the second-highest-grossing superhero and comic-book film, and the fifth-highest-grossing film distributed by Disney. The film earned $13.2 million on its opening day (Wednesday, April 24, 2013) from 12 countries. Through Sunday, April 28, it earned a five-day opening weekend of $198.4 million from 42 countries. The film's opening-weekend gross included $7.1 million from IMAX venues. It set opening-day records in the Philippines (surpassed by \"Man of Steel\"), Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, China, Ukraine, Russia and the CIS, both single- and opening-day records in Thailand and South Africa, as well as a single-day record in Hong Kong. It also scored the second-biggest opening day in Argentina (only behind \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2\"). The film set opening-weekend records in the Asia Pacific region, in Latin America, and in individual countries including Argentina (first surpassed by \"Fast & Furious 6\", when including weekday previews), Ecuador, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates. It also achieved the second-largest opening weekend in Mexico, Brazil, and Russia and the CIS. In India, it had the second-best opening weekend for a Hollywood film after \"The Amazing Spider-Man\". IMAX opening-weekend records were set in Taiwan, the Netherlands, Brazil, and the Philippines. It is the highest-grossing film in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam and the second-highest-grossing film in Singapore and the Philippines (behind \"The Avengers\"). It topped the weekend box office outside North America three consecutive times.\n\nIn China, where part of the production took place, the film set a midnight-showings record with $2.1 million, as well as single-day and opening-day records with $21.5 million (on its opening day). Through its first Sunday, the film earned an opening-weekend total of $64.1 million, making China's opening the largest for the film, followed by a $23.1 million opening in Russia and the CIS, and a $21.2 million opening in the UK, Ireland and Malta. With total earnings reaching $124 million, it was the highest-grossing American film in China in 2013, and the country is the film's highest-grossing market after North America, followed by South Korea ($64.2 million) and the UK, Ireland, and Malta ($57.1 million).\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 80% approval rating with an average rating of 7/10 based on 307 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"With the help of its charismatic lead, some impressive action sequences, and even a few surprises, \"Iron Man 3\" is a witty, entertaining adventure and a strong addition to the Marvel canon.\" Metacritic gave a score of 62 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nIn an early review by the trade magazine \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Todd McCarthy said that, \"After nearly crashing and burning on his last solo flight in 2010, Iron Man returns refreshed and ready for action in this spirited third installment ... [that] benefits immeasurably from the irreverent quicksilver humor of co-writer and director Shane Black. Calling the film \"darker and more serious than its predecessors,\" Kenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" credited Black for \"chang[ing] this billion-dollar-plus franchise's tone for the better while keeping the same actor as Tony Stark. ... There is quite a bit of Black's trademark attitude and humor here as well, things like a throwaway reference to the sci-fi classic \"Westworld\" and a goofy character who has Tony Stark's likeness tattooed on his forearm. Black and company throw all kinds of stuff at the audience, and though it doesn't all work, a lot of it does and the attempt to be different and create unguessable twists is always appreciated.\" Rafer Guzman of \"Newsday\" characterized Iron Man as \"the anti-Batman, all zip and zingers. He's also, suddenly, rather family-friendly. Some of the movie's best moments are shared by Stark and latchkey kid Harley (Ty Simpkins), who mock their budding father-son relationship while acting it out.\" \"Psychology Today\" concluded that the film presented an accurate portrayal of Tony Stark's posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Michael Arbeiter of Hollywood.com praised the film as \"Marvel's First True Action-Comedy\", commenting that \"Tony's camaraderie with preteen tech geek Harley Keener is one gigantic superhero/'90s-kid-sidekick laugh riot (the friggin' kid's name is \"Harley Keener\" ... is there anything more '90s-kid-sidekick-sounding than that?!).\"\n\nNick De Semlyen of the UK film magazine \"Empire\" had criticisms, even while giving the film four of five stars. Finding it \"a swinging caper with wit, balls, heart and exploding baubles,\" he said the villainous \"super-soldiers who can regenerate body parts and survive astounding damage [are] visually interesting ... but their motivation is murky and unconvincing.\" Likewise Joshua Rothkopf of \"Time Out\" New York bestowed 3 of 5 stars, saying, \"Black has massively upped the verbal sparring and kept the broad inventiveness of comic-book malleability in mind. ... The most wonderful of Black's surprises harkens back to his '80s reputation for character revision and is simply too good to ruin here.\" But, he asked, \"[W]hy, finally, are we down at the docks—in the dark, no less—for one of those lumbering climaxes involving swinging shipping cranes? The energy bleeds out of the film; it's as if the producers were scared the crowd would riot over \"not enough\" digital fakeness.\"\n\nReacting more negatively, Stephen Whitty of \"The Star-Ledger\" found the film \"slickly enjoyable\" for the visual effects, but said, \"[T]here's something empty about the film. Like Tony's suits, it's shiny and polished. But this time, there's nobody inside ... This movie has neither the emotionalism of the first film, nor the flashy villains of the second ... Tony's relationship with girlfriend Pepper Potts is in inexplicable jeopardy—and then simply fixes itself. A supposedly cute kid sidekick—a true sign of authorial desperation—is introduced, and then dropped.\" Michael Phillips of the \"Chicago Tribune\" echoed this, saying, \"[I]n a gleefully cynical bid for a preteen audience (a few years too young for the violence in \"Iron Man 3\", I'd say), Stark befriends a bullied 8-year-old [sic] (Ty Simpkins) who becomes his tag-along and sometime savior ... Stark no longer needs to be in the Iron Man suit. He's able to operate the thing remotely when needed. The movie's like that too. It's decent superhero blockbustering, but rather remote and vaguely secondhand. At this point, even with Black's flashes of black humor, the machinery is more or less taking care of itself, offering roughly half of the genial wit and enjoyment of the first \"Iron Man\".\"\n\nIn March 2013, Black stated that Downey's original contract with Marvel Studios, which expired after the release of \"Iron Man 3\", may be extended in order for the actor to appear in a second \"Avengers\" film and at least one more \"Iron Man\" film. He said: \"There has been a lot of discussion about it: 'Is this the last \"Iron Man\" for Robert [Downey, Jr.]?' Something tells me that it will not be the case, and [he] will be seen in a fourth, or fifth.\" In April 2013, Cheadle stated that \"Iron Man 3\" could be the final film in the series, saying, \"The door is always left open in these kinds of movies especially when they do as well as they have done. I know there was talk of making sure we did this one right, and if it worked it could be the last one. There's room for more to be done with these characters. We're getting to a sweet spot with Tony and Rhodey, anyway.\" In September 2014, in regards to a fourth film, Downey said, \"There isn't one in the pipe ... No, there's no plan for a fourth \"Iron Man\".\" In April 2016, Downey stated that he was open to reprising his role in a potential fourth \"Iron Man\" film.\n\nIn February 2014, Marvel released the One-Shot film, \"All Hail the King\", on \"\"s home media, featuring Kingsley reprising his role as Trevor Slattery, and continues Slattery's story from the end of the film.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3964523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3964523", "title": "Kasperle", "text": "Kasperle\n\nKasperle, Kasper, or Kasperl (Bavarian German: \"Káschberl\", Swabian German: \"Kaschberle\", Swiss German: \"Chaschperli\") is a famous and traditional puppet character from Austria, German-speaking Switzerland, and Germany. Its roots date to 17th century, and it was at times so popular that \"Kasperltheater\" was synonymous with \"puppet theater\". Kasperltheater includes the following characters: Kasper, Gretel, Seppel, Grandmother, princess, king, witch, robber, and crocodile. The older, more traditional Kasperle shows are very similar to \"Mister Punch\". There are also \"Kasperle versions\" of the Grimm and other fairy tales and of \"modern fairy tales\".\n\nKasper (known as Kasperl and Kasperle in southern Germany and Austria) is the hero of German puppet theater. The name Kasper probably comes from the ancient Persian meaning \"keeper of the treasure.\" Tradition holds one of the three Magi who visited the Christ Child was named Caspar. This character also existed in the mystery plays of the medieval Church. \n\nThe puppet Kasper, along with France's Guignol, and Britain's Punch and Judy has his origins in the character of Pulcinella, a stock character of the Italian Commedia dell'Arte. Pulcinella was a violent character typically dressed in white clothing, a long white hat, and a black mask. The character is generally identified with Naples.\n\nThe puppet character currently named Kasper first appeared in Munich in 1858 in a marionette play (The Enchanted Lily) by Graf Pocci. Like his cousin Punch, the early Kasper used a slapstick to beat the devil, witch, and crocodile.\n\nIn 1920, Max Jacob introduced the form of Kasper Theater recognized today. Kasper became a positive hero, eventually stopped using the slapstick (except in Bavaria and Austria), and took on a more childlike quality. This form is called the Hohnsteiner style (after Hohnstein Castle (Saxon Switzerland) in Saxony where Max Jacob and his troupe lived and Kasper performances were held). \n\nModern Kasper plays involve Kasper helping his friends (Grandma, Seppel, the Princess, etc.) with various problems. For example, the Witch turns Seppel into a chicken or someone steals Grandma's cake. The structure of Kasper theater is also used to retell Grimm Fairy Tales such as Hansel and Gretel and Little Red Riding Hood. In Southern Germany and Austria, Kasper is known as Kasperle or Kasperl (the diminutive form of Kasper).\n\nKasper and his friends come alive for children as soon as the play starts. When watching a skit, the children learn important values in a safe and healthy way. In this world of make-believe, children are free to express their thoughts and creativity. While role-playing, children relive their daily experiences learning to understand the feelings of others, freeing themselves from fears and worries. Adults, whether playing along or just watching, can gain valuable insight into children’s motivations and feelings. At the same time, children are also developing their motor and verbal skills.\n\nChildren spontaneously make up stories as puppet play progresses. They quickly begin to create their own situations and dialog. The following pages provide several interesting stories and descriptions of the major characters. You will realize that puppet play isn’t just about fairy tales. Modern topics and themes are easily expressed and developed.\n\n\nBread and Puppet Theater, an American-based company under the direction of Silesian-born Peter Schumann, often presents short skits by the fictitious \"Rotten Idea Theater Company\", which features multiple Kaspars. The Kaspars are generally violent, dishonest tricksters, and play out some form of political or social satire while beating each other with clubs.\n\nPunch was introduced in Great Britain in the seventeenth century by an Italian performer named Pietro Gimonde. The original Pulcinella was a marionette. Over time, his name was anglicized to \"Punch,\" and he became a hand puppet. \"Pleased as punch\" and \"beat the devil\" probably originated from Punch and Judy puppet theater.\n\nWhereas the Max Jacob-inspired Kaspar has abandoned much of the bawdiness of 17th century street performance, Punch embraces it. The traditional Kasper and modern Punch use a slapstick to beat the crocodile, police, and even the Devil. \"Slapstick\" originates from the Commedia Dell'arte baton made of wooden slats fastened together like a castanet. On impact, the slapstick makes a loud slapping sound. The term has become synonymous with physical comedy.\n\nPunch is aggravated by his whining child, nagging wife (Judy), and ineffective bureaucracy. This eventually leads to Punch hitting other characters with his slapstick, but it is a very ritualized form of violence. Traditional shows ended with Punch defeating the ultimate evil and proclaiming \"Huzzah, Huzzah, I've killed the Devil!\" In modern endings, Punch is punished by being swallowed by the crocodile, scared into repentance by a ghost, or arrested by the police.\n\nPunch performances also differ from Kasper by use of a \"swazzle.\" The swazzle is used to give Punch a high pitched, squeaky sound. Punch performances are usually put on by \"professors\". In some cases, Punch may be unintelligible, and the \"professor\" must act as an interpreter. \n\nDuring the 19th Century, Punch performances could be easily found on the streets of England. Today, they are much less common. As a continuing English tradition, Punch performances are more likely to be found on the beach during holidays.\n\nForms of Pulcinella can be found throughout Europe and even Turkey. The characters have different names in various countries. In France, he is known as Pulchinelle (Guignol, a figure developed in the 19th century around Lyon, shares many features with Pulchinelle but cannot be said to derive directly from Pulchinelle). In the Netherlands, he is Jan Klaassen, a character whose personality varies greatly from region to region—sometimes sweet, sometimes a trickster. Turkey's Karagoz and the Greek Karaghiozis descend from a common Ottoman shadow puppet tradition; the origin of these traditions and the relationship, if any, to the Pulchinella \"family\" is unknown. Likewise, the Javanese shadow puppet figure of Petruk, shares characteristics with these European figures—some Javanese identify Petruk as a European—and it is tempting but impossible to confirm a historical relationship.\n\nStravinsky made the Russian Petrushka famous with his ballet of the same name. This story involves three puppets (Petrushka, the Ballerina, and the Moor) that come to life. Eventually, Petrushka is murdered by the Moor out of jealousy for the Ballerina. In the final scene, it's discovered that Petrushka was just stuffed with hay all along.\n\n"}

Memorial shows have been historically important in the history of professional wrestling, usually held in memory of a recently deceased wrestler, promoter or other well-known personality, and used to pay tribute to a particular individual's accomplishments and contributions to the industry. The proceeds are generally donated to family members or charitable organizations.\n\nThese shows were often held as a form of supercard, a major wrestling event not aired on pay-per-view, and sometimes resulted interpromotional shows. These types of shows were rarely seen in the United States, the earliest being the Von Erich Memorial Parade of Champions held in memory of David Von Erich from 1984-88, but have been common in Japan since the late 1980s. In North America, memorial shows are most often held by independent wrestling promotions although mainstream organizations like WWE have occasionally dedicated specific episodes of \"WWE Raw\" to then current WWE wrestlers such as Owen Hart (1999), Eddie Guerrero (2005), and Chris Benoit (2007).\n"}
{"id": "27918293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27918293", "title": "MicroTiles", "text": "MicroTiles\n\nThe MicroTiles video display system from Christie Digital is composed of modular 16\" × 12\" (408 mm × 306 mm) rear projection cube units that can be built together into a large video wall-style display. Each MicroTile unit contains a short-throw projector based on an LED light source and DLP optical imaging. The picture is formed onto the detachable front screen surface.\n\nBecause of the building-block nature of the system, the configuration of the overall screen area and shape is flexible, leading to simple traditional rectangular displays, and more complex non-standard shapes.\n\nEvery MicroTile unit has sensors in each side that detect whether there is another unit next to it, allowing the display controller to automatically determine the tile layout and the size and magnification of the video picture to be displayed across the screen area.\n\nThe MicroTiles system has design features for simple installation and setup that minimise the need for detailed configuration of the screens and display controller.\n\nThe system was in development for two years before being launched. It was first publicly announced during an SEGD conference in New York on 11 November 2009. The official launch event was at the Touch nightclub in Manhattan, New York, on 9 December 2009.\n\nThe launch in Europe was at the ISE trade show in Amsterdam, 2–4 February 2010.\n\nFollowing North America and Europe, the system was launched in Japan on 22 April 2010, and then throughout the rest of Asia in the months following.\n\nThe system was invented in 2005 by Christie Digital's Bob Rushby, chief technology officer, and Mike Perkins, senior product developer, while in a Tokyo hotel bar during a business trip.\n\nThe system is capable of exceeding the NTSC specification for colour gamut by 115%. Because the LED light engine has a saturated color output, the image appears to be about 25% brighter than a similar lamp-based projector with the same lumen output. This is due to the Helmholtz Kohlrausch Effect. According to Mike Perkins, the subjective effect of this is that the purer colors from MicroTiles are punchier, more vivid, and more engaging.\n\nEach tile has a native resolution of 720x540 with a pixel pitch of 0.57 mm. The total resolution of the display can be a maximum of the sum of the native resolutions of each tile. Lower input resolutions are automatically up-scaled to fill the display area, which effectively increases the pixel pitch of the image displayed.\n\nChristie’s engineers worked to eliminate the need for calibrating the display manually. Each tile has microprocessor control to communicate with neighboring tiles to auto-adjust and balance both the color and brightness across all the tiles in the display. An electronic control unit (ECU) talks to each tile and creates an internal map of each tile position, and scales the video input across the whole display.\n\nThe servicing of a MicroTile unit in a display has also been a primary design consideration. Servicing is done from the front, and all major components, including the light engine, can be replaced in 15 minutes or less. This can be carried out without shutting down or dismantling the rest of the display. The LED light source is rated at 65,000 hours lifespan to 50% brightness. This is the equivalent of the system running continuously for 7 years.\n\nThe projector light engine is based on a Luminus Devices, Inc. PhatLight LED chipset and uses a TI DLP digital micromirror device. The short throw lens rear projects the image onto the removable tile screen.\n\nThe 10.2\" (260 mm) depth tile chassis is equipped with precision fittings allowing tiles to be mated to each other side by side both horizontally and vertically, allowing displays of various shapes and sizes to be built. The screen is a matt-finished polycarbonate material mounted on a metal frame which is held onto the front of the tile cabinet magnetically. The frame is designed so that the seams visible in the picture between each tile in a screen array are kept to a minimum of about 1 mm. The power and signal connectors are on the rear of the cabinet, and once installed, there is no further need to access the rear panel for adjustments or maintenance. All mechanical maintenance is carried out from the front of the unit, with access gained by detaching the magnetically held screen with a suction grip tool.\n\nThe video input to the system is via a DVI connector on the Electronic Control Unit (ECU), and it can accept video modes up to WUXGA (1920x1200). This is typically fed from a video processor or media player with a DVI interface as the video output. The ECU is also connected to the MicroTiles in a daisy chain or ring network using a customised version of the DisplayPort interface.\n\nAs well as carrying the video information, the DisplayPort links carry two way control and monitoring signalling between the tiles and the ECU. The ECU performs automatic calibration of light output and color control, to ensure that the picture displayed is uniform across the array of tiles. MicroTiles displays can use multiple ECUs to allow higher resolution images to be displayed on large arrays. In this case one ECU arbitrates to become the master, and it assumes the role for device control, the other slave ECUs are just used for image signal processing.\n\nThe MicroTiles display system can be configured in shapes and sizes which don't conform to standard rectangular aspect ratio shapes and resolutions, and the number of pixels in the WUXGA video mode (about 2.3 million) is near the maximum that one ECU can display on a MicroTiles display. This allows resolutions to be displayed on smaller tile arrays at the native 0.57mm pixel pitch (for up to six tiles) - larger arrays need more ECUs to be added to the system, which means that multiple media player outputs will be needed to drive the extra ECUs. If the highest quality native resolution display is not necessary, then lower resolution video inputs to the ECUs will be scaled across the display.\n\nBuilt in sensors in the cabinet top, bottom and sides allow the ECU to communicate with each tile and discover its neighbors, allowing it to map the array layout automatically. The ECU will then tell each tile what portion of the video input to display, so that an entire image is correctly formed and scaled across the whole display.\n\nThe ECU monitors the light output of the LED light sources in each tile and automatically adjusts the color and brightness of each tile to ensure the picture is uniform over the whole array.\n\nSince the product launch, the system has been used in some installations that can be seen by the public:\n\n\n"}

An individual can travel anywhere while still feeling comfortable because of the connectivity of their mobile device. The connection creates a sense of familiarity which results in the individual's identity becoming attached to their mobile service provider. This concept leads to the idea that \"home\" need not be a domestic structure featuring walls and a roof, but that the mobile sense of connection provides a portable community similar to a home environment.\n\nThe term was first used by Raymond Williams in his 1974 book \"Television: Technology and Cultural Form\" (Routledge, 3rd ed., 2003, ). Williams described the main contradiction in modern society as the one between mobility and home-centered living. He considered that television can negotiate that contradiction by providing users privacy to view the world.\n\nPaul du Gay, of the Copenhagen Business School, developed this theory in 2001. His main perspective was that home, for Williams, is a shrunken social space where isolated individuals gain vicariously increased mobility. Accordingly, he introduced the concept of “mobile privatised social relations”. Henrikson applied the concept of Technological Determinism to conclude that “Technologies can be designed, consciously or unconsciously, to open certain social options and close others”.\n\nIn 2005, Kenichi Fujimoto, Professor of Informatics and Mediology at Mukogawa Women's University, came up with a theory called \"Nagara Mobilism\". Nagara means people have the ability to handle different process like text video and sound at the same time. He reaffirmed the contradiction between the physical and virtual home, and explained that increased privacy of public space can make the contradiction stronger. In 2007, the term Glocalization was introduced. It means that when individuals utilize mobile technology, their social networks expand while making themselves much closer to the local community.\n\nHans Geser, a professor at the University of Zürich, has isolated four main features of mobile technology that weaken societal development: \n\n"}

{"id": "1102059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1102059", "title": "Papa Wemba", "text": "Papa Wemba\n\nJules Shungu Wembadio Pene Kikumba (14 June 1949 – 24 April 2016), known professionally as Papa Wemba, was a Congolese singer and musician who played Congolese rumba, soukous, and ndombolo. Sometimes dubbed the \"King of Rumba Rock\", he was one of the most popular musicians of his time in Africa and played an important role in world music. He was also a fashion icon who popularized the Sape look and style through his musical group Viva la Musica, with whom he performed on stages throughout the world.\n\nPapa Wemba's road to fame and prominence began when he joined the music group Zaiko Langa Langa in the late 1960s. This was followed by his success as a founding member both of Isifi Lokole and then Yoka Lokole, along with a short stint as a member of Afrisa International for a few months. During these early stages of his career, he was establishing a style that included traditional Congolese rumba and soukous, infused with traditional African sounds, Caribbean rhythms, rock and soul. But Wemba gained international success and status with his band Viva La Musica, especially after he took them to Paris, France in the early 1980s. It was there that Wemba was able to achieve more of an \"eclectic sound\" in his work, influenced by western popular music that reflected a European flavor and style, referred to as \"Europop.\" Wemba spoke about this transition in his music during a 2004 interview:\n\nPapa Wemba was one of the first musicians to join the influential rock-rumba band \"Zaiko Langa Langa\" (ZLL) after it was created in December 1969 in Kinshasa, by many well-known Congolese musicians including Nyoka Longo Jossart and Bimi Ombale, among others. He remained with the group for four years.\n\nPapa Wemba (then known as Jules Presley Shungu Wembadio) helped contribute to the success of \"Zaiko Langa Langa\" so that, by 1973, it was one of the more successful Congolese groups. By that time, ZLL's shows and performances featured a string of their popular hits, some of them written by Wemba. The latter included \"Pauline\", \"C'est La Vérité\", \"Chouchouna\", and \"Liwa Ya Somo\".\n\n\"Zaiko Langa Langa\" had gained a strong and popular following even in a Congolese musical world that, in those days, was already dominated by various musical acts including Franco Luambo and his band TPOK Jazz, or Tabu Ley Rochereau's various ensembles. ZLL was also vying for an audience with other (at the time) new musical acts such as Bella-Bella and Empire Bakuba.\n\nIn December 1974, at the pinnacle of their fame (and just a month after the Rumble in the Jungle between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in Kinshasa), Papa Wemba (usually called 'Shungu Wembadio' at this point in his career) along with Evoloko Lay Lay, Mavuela Somo and Bozi Boziana, left Zaiko Langa Langa to establish their own musical ensemble \"Isifi Lokole.\" Wemba later claimed that ISIFI was an acronym for \"Institut du Savoir Ideologique pour la Formation des Idoles,\" a claim that has still not been given total credence. In July 1975, Shungu Wembadio officially adopted the soon-to-be-well-known-worldwide name \"Papa Wemba\". The \"Papa\" (father) part of his name had already been given to him as a traditional and cultural rite because he was his mother's first-born son. But in assuming a new name and public persona, \"Papa\" was now re-emphasized as an allusion to the demanding family responsibilities that Wemba assumed at very young age, since both parents were now deceased: Wemba's father in 1966, followed by his mother in 1973. \"Isifi Lokole\" would only last a year together as a group, with the single \"Amazone\" (a Wemba composition) as its biggest commercial \"hit\" record.\n\nIn November 1975, Papa Wemba, Mavuela Somo and Bozi Boziana left \"Isifi Lokole\" to create the group \"Yoka Lokole\" (also known as The Kinshasa's Wa Fania All-Stars). \"Yoka Lokole\" contributed to the African pop music wave with their hit songs including \"Matembele Bangui\", \"Lisuma ya Zazu\" (Papa Wemba), \"Mavuela Sala Keba\", and \"Bana Kin\" (Mavuela Somo).\n\nLike \"Isifi Lokole\", the electronic-instrument-driven \"Yoka Lokole\" would not last much longer than a year. After a year of modest success, controversies within \"Yoka Lokole\" over money and prestige were also complicated by Wemba's arrest and brief incarceration in Kinshasa Central prison in December 1976 for the \"crime\" of being suspected of having had physical intimacy with an army general's daughter. The band continued to tour without Papa Wemba. For whatever reason (or reasons), whether it was personal or professional (with one source speculating that he was perhaps feeling diminished in the public's eye), by 1977 Wemba had formed a new group, and called it \"Viva la Musica\".\n\nIn 1977-78, back home now in the Matonge neighborhood of Kinshasa, Papa Wemba set out to create his group \"Viva la Musica\". This new band's name was suggested to him in 1974, when he attended a concert in Kinshasa that featured the New York-based Latinos, \"Fania All-Stars\". During the concert, one of the singers would shout to the audience \"Viva La Musica!\" to an enthusiastic response. Wemba's vision was to structure \"Viva la Musica\" around young, talented but largely unknown artists, including the singers Prince Espérant, Jadot \"le Cambodgien\" Sombele, Pepe Bipoli and Petit Aziza, and various guitarists such as Rigo Star, Syriana, and Bongo Wende. The new group included the traditional instrument lokole. There was also an associated dance, the mukonyonyo, as well as a fashion style.\n\nThe band achieved immediate success and, during their first year performing together, the Kinshasa newspaper \"Elima\" named the band \"best orchestra\" and their single, \"Mère Supérieure,\" best song. During the following three years, \"Viva la Musica\" built on these initial accolades with more hit songs including \"Moku Nyon Nyon\", \"Nyekesse Migue'l\", and \"Cou Cou Dindon\". As time went by, it was revealed that Antoine Agbepa was the unknown writer of many of these songs, when Papa Wemba said, \"Ooh! l'homme idée\" (Oh! the idea-man!), thereby on-the-spot renaming the impressive young singer-songwriter Koffi Olomide - and the name stuck.\n\nAfter his success already with three influential groups, in 1977 Papa Wemba established a kind of commune for musicians. To accomplish this, he used his family home (on Kanda-Kanda street) as a fashionable gathering place for Matonge youths. He named it \"Village Molokai\" and declared himself to be its tribal chief (\"chef coutumier\").\n\nBeginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wemba (both by himself and with Viva la Musica) started traveling to Paris, believing there was a potentially wider audience for the music he had been helping to create during the preceding decade. As Wemba biographer Craig Harris put it:\nBy the late 1980s and early 1990s, Wemba's style was more readily identifiable even as it had become an amalgamation of rhumba, soukous and ndombolo, Latin and rock, melded to a European-oriented pop style. But still wanting to expand their musical horizons, and move in new musical directions, \"Viva la Musica\" took on a dual-identity. Wemba now maintained one group in Kinshasa (called at times \"Nouvelle Ecriture\", \"Nouvel Ecrita\" and then again \"Viva la Musica\") and another one in Paris (\"Nouvelle Generation,\" \"La Cour des Grands\" and now \"Viva Tendance\"). The group consistently maintained a high profile in world music with hits like \"Le Voyageur\" (1992), \"Emotion\" (1995), \"Pole Position\" (1996) and \"Somo Trop\" (October, 2003).\n\nBy this time, Wemba's use of African, Cuban and Western influences was not only one of Africa's most popular music styles, it was crossing cultural boundaries and attracting a more diverse audience outside of Africa. In 1993, Wemba joined with Peter Gabriel for the latter's \"Secret World Live\" tour, and this drew attention to Wemba's unique style and groundbreaking sound. The aforementioned \"Emotion\" album, released in 1995, showed that he was achieving a global following. This album appeared under Peter Gabriel's Real World record label, and sold more than 100,000 copies.\n\nIn February 2003, Wemba was suspected of being involved in a network that had allegedly smuggled hundreds of illegal immigrants from the Democratic Republic of the Congo into Europe. At that point he was arrested in Paris and held while awaiting a trial. He then spent three-and-a-half months in prison until a €30,000 bail was posted (some reports claimed it was paid by the Congolese government). Wemba was released in June 2003, an experience that, upon his release, he declared had had a profound psychological effect on him. The singer claimed to have undergone a spiritual conversion in jail and even recounted this episode on his album \"Somo Trop\" (released in October 2003). On the song \"Numéro d'écrou\", he recalled the day \"God\" paid a visit to his cell. In 2004, he was convicted in France, fined and given a suspended prison sentence. Wemba then returned to the Congo in 2006 and continued playing music until his death.\n\nIn 1979, Papa Wemba became the unofficial leader of La Sape (Société des Ambianceurs et des Personnes d'Élégance, literally translated as the \"Society of Atmosphere-setters and Elegant People\") which he promoted as a youth subculture in Zaire. Their style was influenced by the fashion centres of Paris and Milan. Wemba said:\n\nThe Sapeur cult promoted high standards of personal cleanliness, hygiene and smart dress, to a whole generation of youth across Zaire. When I say well groomed, well shaved, well perfumed, it's a characteristic that I am insisting on among the young. I don't care about their education, since education always comes first of all from the family.\n\nAfter Wemba's death, Cameroonian saxophonist Manu Dibango told the BBC during an interview:\n\nPapa Wemba's impact on the culture is also reflected by his influence on a new generation of musicians and performers. For example, Priyan Weerappuli (leader of the Sri Lankan group Pahan Silu) referred to Wemba as being among his greatest musical influences. Weerappuli claims that he was first introduced to Wemba's music in 2004 and was \"deeply inspired by the free rhythms demonstrated by Wemba's Soukous style\" and, from that point, \"began experimenting with these rhythms in his own compositions.\"\n\nMany others paid tribute to Papa Wemba's legacy after his death in April 2016. Some of them included not only Koffi Olomide and Manu Dibango (both mentioned previously), but musicians King Kikii and Femi Kuti, along with soccer star Samuel Eto'o (among others) gave testimony to his lasting influence on them.\n\nPapa Wemba got some attention as a movie actor, primarily because he played the male lead role in a very successful Zairean film \"La Vie est Belle\" (Life is Beautiful) [1987] by Belgian director Benoît Lamy and Congolese producer-director Ngangura Mweze. Wemba made another kind of contribution to cinema, thanks to his work on the soundtracks for \"Children of Men\", \"Besieged\", and \"Black Mic Mac\". Wemba is also credited as \"composer\" of the scores for the films \"Identity Pieces\", \"Macadam tribu\", along with \"Life is Beautiful.\".\n\nDuring his life Wemba acted in a few more successful films, although he played only minor roles. As recently as 2012, he had a cameo role in the Belgian drama film \"Kinshasa Kids\". Beyond the impact of his important role in \"Life is Beautiful\", there are his many music videos and recorded band performances. Also, Wemba is featured (as himself) in many documentary films which were generally well received including; \"The Importance of Being Elegant\", \"The Real World of Peter Gabriel\" and \"The African Rock 'n' Roll Years\" (all television) documentaries).\n\nWemba died at the age of 66 after collapsing on stage in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, during the FEMUA urban music festival on Sunday, 24 April 2016. On Monday, April 25, it was reported that his widow, Mama-Marie Luzolo Amazone, flew to Abidjan \"accompanied by family members and government officials.\" In Wemba's hometown of Kinshasa, both fellow musicians and fans gathered together as a tribute to his legacy. Similar tributes also took place in Paris, London, Brussels and Nairobi.\n\nNote: Papa Wemba was part of more than 35 album recordings. The following list is just a sampling from a 15-year time-span (1986-2001) during which Wemba was solidifying an international reputation in world music.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32901777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32901777", "title": "Phantom ride", "text": "Phantom ride\n\nPhantom rides or panoramas were an early genre of film popular in Britain and the US at the end of the 19th century. Pre-dating true narrative, the films simply show the progress of a vehicle moving forwards, usually shot by strapping a cameraman to the front. The term \"phantom ride\" was applied because the position of the camera meant that only the track and scenery could be seen and the movement appeared to be coming from an invisible force. Though many early films showed local tracks the demand for new footage led to more exotic locations being filmed. This brought a new dimension to the genre, showing foreign lands to those who would otherwise never see them. The genre is also significant, despite its short-lived popularity, due to the role it played in the development of the tracking shot, longer films and film editing, as well as its re-emergence in 4D film and simulation.\n\nMost films before phantom rides used static cameras with all the action happening within the scene. This new style of film-making popularised the idea of motion created by the movement of the camera. American Mutoscope's \"The Haverstraw Tunnel\" (1897), featuring a train travelling along the West Shore Railroad in New York and then through the eponymous tunnel, and the Lumière brothers' \"Leaving Jerusalem by Railway\" (1897), featuring a train leaving Jerusalem, are considered the first examples of the phantom ride genre. The audience were wowed by the speed and unique perspectives that these films introduced, for the first time experiencing the view of travelling while seated in a small hall. \n\nScreenings of \"The Haverstraw Tunnel\" (1897) in London in October of that year proved to be an instant success with a reviewer in \"The Era\" writing that, \"A more exciting and sensational piece of realism has never been presented to an audience.\" Starting the following year, Mutoscope's British subsidiary filmed and released their own phantom rides, including \"Conway Castle - Panoramic View of Conway on the L. & N.W. Railway\" (1898) and \"Through Chee Tor Tunnel in Derbyshire - Midland Railway\", as did rival companies such as the Warwick Trading Company. \n\nThe phantom ride genre contributed to the emergence of longer film as distributors grouped their films together to form single journeys, such as the Warwick Trading Company's \"View from an Engine Front - Through Morthoe\" (1898) and \"View from an Engine Front - Ilfracombe Incline\" (1898) which were made available together as a single continuous length of film. Concurrent technological developments resulted in the Warwick Trading Company's 12-minute epic \"Dalmeny to Dunfermline, Scotland, via the Firth of Forth Bridge\" (1899), billed as \"the longest, most picturesque and interesting Cinematograph film ever produced.\"\n\nGeorge Albert Smith's \"The Kiss in the Tunnel\" (1899) was a single shot of a couple sharing a brief kiss as their train passes through a tunnel, that was produced to be spliced into existing phantom ride footage, such as Cecil Hepworth's \"View from an Engine Front - Train Leaving Tunnel\" (1899), to add interest to the genre. This insertion of a single shot into another film indicates, according to film historian Frank Gray, \"a new understanding of continuity film editing,\" which, \"would have a profound impact on the development of editing strategies and become a dominant practice.\"\n\nThe concept of phantom rides was to dramatically change with the opening of Hale's Tours of the World in 1906. A predecessor to modern simulators and 4-D films, these shows involved more than just the projected film footage. The cinema itself was designed to physically mimic the experience of being in the carriage of a train, with piped sounds of train whistles and rushing steam adding to the visuals. The benching was even designed to shake to add realism to the feeling of movement along the track. Hale's Tours were successful enough for them to open four venues in London and several others across the UK.\n\nThe rapid development of film-making techniques meant that the audience quickly moved onto other things and by 1910 they no longer accepted these single-shot visuals. Narrative in film progressed and phantom rides were demoted to being one scene out of several in more story-driven movies.\n"}

It is an amateur sport played in shallow water consisting of players keeping a small ball from touching the water.\n\nPicigin originated on the sandy beach of Bačvice in Split. It was first played in 1908 by a group of Croatian students from Prague who were finding it difficult to play the game of water polo in the shallow water. Instead, they began playing a different game which would come to be known as picigin. \n\nThe game involves several players in a circle batting around a small ball with their hands; the objective is to keep the ball in the air and out of the water for as long as possible. Players don't catch the ball, they bounce it around with the palm of the hand. As such, the game somewhat resembles net-less volleyball, but is played with a much smaller ball, usually a peeled tennis ball. There is no set number of players, though five is usually average. Much running and diving is done in order to keep the ball from going in the shallow water. Picigin is considered a non-competitive sport: there are no opposing sides, no points, neither winners nor losers. It is generally viewed as a relaxing and fun game, and many take the opportunity to make extravagant leaps and acrobatic manoeuvrings to keep the ball in play. \n\nSince picigin is an amateur sport, there are no strict or formal rules, but it is played according to tradition, with little variation, but the main goal is to keep ball in the air as long as possible.\n\nThere are usually five players in the game. Two of them are called \"sidruni\" (sidro = anchor, they are called so because they do not move from their places) and the other three are runners (\"trkači\"). The groups are often mixed both by gender and age.\n\nPicigin must be played on a sandy beach in shallow water. The beach must be sandy because otherwise players could easily get hurt. It is best if the water is ankle-deep, because of mobility and also to soften falls, which are common because there's a lot of jumping around trying to reach the ball.\n\nThe traditional ball, called \"balun\" (otherwise a dialectal name for a ball, but this name is strictly used, especially by expert players) is actually a peeled onion, polished off a few millimeters. This kind of ball is best suited for bouncing. It is smooth and lighter than a normal tennis ball.\n\nThe most traditional players believe it to be impossible to play picigin anywhere but on the sandy beach of Bačvice in Split, which is considered the game's spiritual home. \n\nPicigin is played on Bačvice year round and, often at night in the summer (reflectors can be used in the dark). There is also a long-standing tradition of playing picigin on New Year's Day regardless of weather conditions, when the sea temperature is rarely above 10 °C.\n\nIn June 2008, picigin was pronounced a Croatian immaterial cultural good, for a period of three years, and it is planned to get a permanent protection after that.\n\nSince 2005, the Picigin World Championship in picigin (\"Prvenstvo svita u piciginu\") is organized every year on Bačvice beach in Split. Until 2008, players were given a task to do certain jumps, but from 2008, the winner is selected according to the artistic impression of a whole group.\n\nIn Herceg Novi, Winter Picigin tournament is included Mimosa Festival (organized in February).\n\n"}
{"id": "45500180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45500180", "title": "Piece by Piece (song)", "text": "Piece by Piece (song)\n\n\"Piece by Piece\" is a song by American singer Kelly Clarkson taken from her seventh studio album of the same name. She co-wrote the track with its producer Greg Kurstin. A midtempo pop song about restoring someone's faith in love and family relationships, Clarkson promulgated \"Piece by Piece\" as a sequel to the song \"Because of You\" (2004) but with a \"happy ending\". After a discussion with her sister about their family life, she introspectively co-wrote the song in a first-person narrative to her father, whose neglect of his family was used as a juxtaposition to her husband's unconditional love for her and their daughter, whom they both promised to never abandon.\n\n\"Piece by Piece\" was first released as the second promotional single from \"Piece by Piece\" by RCA Records on February 24, 2015. Upon its release, the title track received praise from music critics, who commended its lyrical content as one of the album's highlights. Clarkson premiered the song in a live acoustic performance on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" and has showcased it on the set list of the Piece by Piece Tour. A re-worked version of the track was released to American hot adult contemporary radio stations on November 9, 2015, as the third and final single from the album. On February 25, 2016, Clarkson performed \"Piece by Piece\" in a live presentation on the fifteenth season of \"American Idol\". The successful commercial and critical response of her performance on the program led RCA to issue an \"\"Idol\" version\" of the track on February 29, 2016.\n\nThe combined versions of \"Piece by Piece\" allowed the song to debut on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart at number eight, becoming Clarkson's eleventh top ten hit and tying itself with \"Never Again\" (2007) as her highest debut on the chart. The track also attained the top position on three \"Billboard\" charts—primarily the \"Billboard\" Digital Songs chart, earning Clarkson her 100th \"Billboard\" number-one hit—a milestone in her musical career. Elsewhere, \"Piece by Piece\" became a top 40 hit in the music charts of Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and Scotland. Clarkson later performed a reprise of the \"Idol\" version on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" on March 3, 2016. The \"Idol\" version was nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nOne of the five songs she had written by for her seventh studio album, Clarkson co-wrote \"Piece by Piece\" with frequent collaborator Greg Kurstin, who produced the track. Clarkson has said about writing the song: A lot of the reasons why I wrote \"Piece by Piece\" was I guess I didn't realize the gravity of the situation until I had a child of my own, and until I experienced love like I do with Brandon (Blackstock) on the daily basis. I guess you don't realize something is missing until you feel it. I can't imagine walking away from my little girl. I can't imagine not having that love anymore. I didn't know it was missing because I never had it. It was a revelation and that's why I wrote that song. I think a lot of people go through that.\n\nLyrically, the song is a midtempo pop number about restoring someone's faith in love and family relationships. The song starts with a woman's recollection of her father abandoning his family; by the chorus, she finds a new man in her life, whom she describes as someone who, \"piece by piece\", had restored her \"faith that a man can be kind and a father could stay\". Written in a first-person narrative, Clarkson introspectively co-wrote the song to her father, whose abandonment of his family when she was six years old was utilized as a juxtaposition in contrast to her husband's unconditional love to her and their daughter, whom they had both promised in the song to never leave behind.\n\nClarkson pegged \"Piece by Piece\" as a follow-up song to her 2004 track \"Because of You\" and the album's \"most personal\" record, saying that \"once you've worked through that and you find love and the kind of happiness you hoped for but didn't really know was possible. It's a happy song. And it has a happy ending, unlike 'Because of You. She revealed that she was inspired to write it after a discussion with her sister about their relationships with their respective families. She remarked, \"I was talking to my sister on the phone about how sometimes girls with daddy issues don't find men like that!\". Clarkson also noted that how their husbands were so supportive and loving were in stark contrast to the cliché about people with \"abandonment issues\" dating \"losers\". She also said that \"Piece by Piece\" is a positive song, despite its somber resonance, and that she's still grateful to her father for making her want to be much more present in her family. Sonically, Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\" compared it to the anthems recorded by U2. While Marissa Muller of CBS Radio described its sound as having a stadium feel with big drums.\n\n\"Piece by Piece\" was first issued as the album's second promotional single by RCA Records on February 24, 2015. Clarkson also revealed plans for the song to receive a single release. RCA then commissioned a re-worked version of the track for commercial release, which was serviced to hot adult contemporary radio stations on November 9, 2015 as the third single from the album. Following Clarkson's performance on \"American Idol\", RCA issued an \"Idol\" version accompanied by a piano by Jason Halbert and produced and mixed by Jason Halbert on February 29, 2016.\n\n\"Piece by Piece\" received acclaim from music critics, who promulgated it as one of the album's highlights for its lyrical content. Reviewing for \"Billboard\", Jamieson Cox regarded the song as a raw and standout vocal showcase, saying that when Clarkson forges a real emotional connection with the track, it allows the album to transcend hammier and hackneyed moments in between. In his review for \"The New York Times\", Pareles described it as the album's most accusatory song; and noted that despite the lyrical's vulnerability, its music rises quickly to bombast, triumphal and glamorous but remote. He also lamented that those moments are far too few in the album. Writing for AXS on its release, Chase Hunt singled out \"Piece by Piece\" as the one that feels more natural than the rest of the album's tracks. He wrote, \"Songs penned by [Clarkson], or any artist writing their own songs, feels different. The track is letting fans into her soul while telling more of her story, past and present.\"\n\nKatherine St. Asaph of \"Time\" also highlighted the song as one of the album's stronger moments, describing it as a dagger to deadbeat dads everywhere that marks her most pointed lyrics since \"Stronger\"s \"You Love Me\" (2011). AllMusic's senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine also included it as one of the three tracks (along with \"Nostalgic\" and \"Good Goes the Bye\") that strike a right balance of Clarkson's indomitable character and fresh electronic beats on the album's production. In their reviews of \"Piece by Piece\", \"New York Post\"s Hardeep Phull also pegged the track as the album's emotional peak, while Jim Farber of the \"New York Daily News\" highlighted the song as one of the two (along with \"Someone\") that show Clarkson's flair for the passive aggressive put-down and help focus on her persona. Reviewing of the album for \"The A.V. Club\", Annie Zaleski also commended the track as one of the tracks where Clarkson is far more engaging, and recommended that the album could use more of those emotional complexity and personal connection.\n\n\"Piece by Piece\" made its debut chart appearance on the \"Billboard\" Adult Top 40 chart on the chart week ending December 19, 2015. It attained a peak position of number 32 and stayed on the chart for nine weeks. Following Clarkson's performance of the song on \"American Idol\", Nielsen Soundscan announced that digital copies of the song had sold a total of 21,996 copies a few hours prior to the end of the tracking week ending on February 25, 2016, posting a 4777% gain from its previous week and allowing it to debut on the \"Billboard\" Digital Songs chart at number 35 and at number 18 on the \"Billboard\" Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart in the issue dated the week ending March 12, 2016. The following week, \"Piece by Piece\" made its debut \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart at number eight, becoming Clarkson's eleventh Hot 100 top ten hit on the chart and tied itself with \"Never Again\" (2007) as her highest entry position on the chart. In addition, it also became her first song to reach the top 10 in since \"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\" reached number one in 2012. It also ascended to the top position on the \"Billboard\" Digital Songs chart and Pop Digital Songs chart with 210,000 digital copies sold and 3.1 million streaming activity, posting a 852% digital surge and 969% streaming gain while also becoming her 100th number-one hit on the \"Billboard\" charts. In addition, the song re-entered the \"Billboard\" Adult Top 40 chart at number 33 and debuted on the \"Billboard\" Adult Contemporary chart at number 23. \"Piece by Piece\" peaked at number nine on the Adult Pop chart, becoming Clarkson's fifteenth top-10 hit on the chart and set a record for the female artist with the most top-10s on the chart. Internationally, \"Piece by Piece\" debuted on the \"Billboard\" Canadian Hot 100 at number 17, on the Official UK Singles Chart at number 95, with an entry at number 37 on the UK Top Sales Chart, and on the ARIA Singles Chart at number 24. Following a performance of \"Piece by Piece\" by Rebecca Grace on The X Factor, the song re-entered the Official UK Singles Chart at number 27, attaining a new peak position. \n\nAs of September 2017, the song has sold over 813,000 copies in the United States.\n\nClarkson presented \"Piece by Piece\" in a short live acoustic performance on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" on March 2, 2015, and explained how she co-wrote the song. She revealed that the song's lyrical content had also made it hard for her to perform it live, saying \"It's not even the sad parts of it because I'm not there. I'm not in that place anymore, like where I'm sad about it. I'm in a very forgiving place about it and everybody's human. But I think I get really choked up because I just realize how lucky I am... And a lot of girls that grew up with their daddy issues and with not having that figure in their life, you know, take a very different road, and I just feel lucky that I'm not that girl.\" To promote the album, Clarkson had also performed the song in a stripped-down performance as part of her set list during her Piece by Piece Tour. On February 25, 2016, she performed \"Piece by Piece\" in a live performance a year after its release on the fifteenth season of \"American Idol\". Her rendition of the song was met with a standing ovation from the audience and critical acclaim from music critics— with Olivia Waring \"Metro\" praising it as poignant while \"USA Today\"s Erin Jensen describing it as a \"heartfelt performance that we just can't get enough of\". On March 3, 2016, Clarkson appeared on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" where she discussed her \"American Idol\" performance and closed the program with a rendition of the song.\n\nAn accompanying music video filmed by Alon Isocianu was commissioned to promote the single and premiered on Vevo on November 19, 2015. The video, filmed entirely in a monochromatic form, features tribute scenes to women of all ages—primarily to mothers, abandoned daughters, and pregnant women, ending with a scene of Clarkson carrying her own daughter.\n\n\nCredits adapted from the \"Piece by Piece\" liner notes and \"Piece by Piece\" metadata.\n\n\n"}

Currently, Prague Conservatory offers four or six year study courses, which can be compared to the level of high school diploma in other countries. Graduates of Prague Conservatory can continue their training by enrolling in an institution that offers undergraduate education. \n\nThe Prague Conservatory was founded in 1808 by local aristocrats and burghers. Classes started in 1811, after a delay caused by the Napoleonic Wars. Bedřich Diviš Weber was appointed the first director of the school.\n\nIn 1891, Antonín Dvořák joined the faculty as the head of the composition department. He was the school's director between 1901 and 1904. Dvořák's students included the composers Vítězslav Novák, Josef Suk (who later served as director of the Conservatory), Rudolf Friml, Oskar Nedbal, and Franz Lehár. Another director of the school was pianist Vilém Kurz.\n\nFollowing the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, drama and ballet departments were established. Students in this period included Lída Baarová (dropped out), Jiří Langmajer, Tatiana Vilhelmová (dropped out), Filip Blažek, and Zuzana Vejvodová. Katya Zvelebilova began classical ballet training at the Prague Conservatory before joining the Royal Ballet School in London, where she is now a member of the artistic staff, having retired from professional ballet.\n\nApplicants must pass stringent entrance examinations, often held in several elimination rounds, to demonstrate their talent. Applications are accepted once a year (with a deadline usually at the end of November), and auditions take place at the end of January. \n\nPrague Conservatory offers instruction in several instruments, including accordion, guitar, piano, and organ, as well as in singing, composing, conducting, and acting. The curriculum includes one-on-one music lessons, music theory studies, language training, as well as classes on general subjects. The institution has its own symphonic and chamber orchestras, choir, several chamber music ensembles and a theatre company. About 250 concerts and 40 dramatic performances take place annually.\n\nIn the academic year of 2005/2006, approximately 550 Czech and 40 foreign students studied at the Conservatory. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Prostitution occurs in bars, hotels, nightclubs, brothels, massage parlors and health clubs.\n\nSex trafficking is a problem in Oman.\n\nOnly sex within a legalized marriage is permitted. Women's sex outside legal marriage is criminalised as \"zina\" (illegal sex, adultery, fornication). It is women, and not their clients, who are legally penalised for sex work which carries a jail sentence between three and five years. Living on the proceeds of prostitution is a crime, punishable by a fine and up to three months imprisonment (criminal code article 221). Additionally, any foreigner who commits an act against \"public order or good morals\" or who does not have a legal source of income may be deported (law 16 of 1995, articles 31[1] and 31[5]).\n\nPolice crackdowns are frequent. 43 women were arrested in raids in Bausher in December 2016 and over 100 in simultaneous raids in Al Khuwayr in August 2017.\n\nHundreds of Southeast Asian women have been arrested for prostitution, and in November 2016 the issuing of tourist visas to women from Southeast Asia was restricted.\n\nIn the 3 years prior to August 2017, 273 people were arrested for prostitution and all received a minimum of 3 years jail sentence.\n\nOman is a destination and transit country for women, primarily from South and East Asia and East and North Africa, subjected to sex trafficking, often by nationals of their own countries. There have been anecdotal reports that female domestic workers from countries without a diplomatic presence in Oman are especially vulnerable to sex trafficking. Domestic workers who flee their employers are also vulnerable to forced prostitution.\n\nDuring the 1990s and early 2000s, young women were trafficked from the former Soviet Union for sex work. In 2005 Oman ratified the International Labour Organization's 1959 convention prohibiting forced labour. By that time foreign migrant workers made up 60% of Oman's population, and their standard of living was lower than the Omani average (Oman is classified as \"medium human development\" by the United Nations Development Programme). Oman has a serious problem of people trafficking involving women and is considered a \"Tier 2\" country by the United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons.\n"}

{"id": "23942963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23942963", "title": "Religious views on pornography", "text": "Religious views on pornography\n\nReligious views on pornography are based on broader religious views on modesty, human dignity, sexuality and other virtues which may reflect negatively on pornography. Different religious groups view pornography and sexuality differently.\n\nPeople who identify themselves as very religious and consume porn are more likely to consider themselves as addicted to porn (an addiction that is not recognized in the psychiatric handbook DSM-V) than a non-religious reference group according to a 2013 study, but no connection between level of religious devotion and amount of porn consumed was shown in that study.\n\nThere is no direct prohibition of pornography in the Bible. However, many Christians base their views on pornography on (part of the Expounding of the Law):\n\nYe have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.\n\nIt contains one of the Ten Commandments, Exodus 20:14 or Deuteronomy 5:18, which is also used often as a supporting verse to condemn pornography.\n\nMichael Coogan reports that, based on his past experience, the campaign against lustful thoughts had the consequence of razoring the Song of Songs from the Bibles available for seminarians.\n\nKen Stone cites Origen's words to say that reading the Song of Songs may stimulate lust to 'fleshly' readers: \"But if any man who lives only after the flesh shall approach [the Song of Songs], to such a one the reading of this Scripture will be the occasion of no small hazard and danger. For he, not knowing how to hear love's language in purity and with chaste ears, will twist the whole manner of his hearing of it away from the inner spiritual man and on to the outward and carnal; and he will be turned away from the spirit to the flesh, and will foster carnal desires in himself, and it will seem to be the Divine Scriptures that are thus urging and egging him on to fleshly lust!\" Stone adds that \"the heavy use of food imagery in the book is no barrier to a positive 'pornographic' interpretation.\"\n\nRichard Hess explains Carey E. Walsh's view as: \"Walsh has determined that the emphasis of the Song lies in the expression of desire between two lovers. It is not sexual consummation that is most important, but the desire itself that drives the lovers together. In this she distinguishes erotica from pornography. The latter is concerned only with sex, and in this it is qualitatively different from the Song. Here sex plays a secondary role to desire. Whether there is any sexual activity at all in the poem—and as a fantasy there may be no such reality here—the key to the Song remains with the desire that drives the reader to appreciate the time of waiting. Hebrew experience placed the greatest value on passion.\" Saying that the Song of Songs is \"erotica\", not pornography, she argues that both are different in at least three ways: (1) Erotica inclines toward \"emotions and internal worlds\" of a subject to seek empathy, while pornography's \"emotional flatness\" aims at sexual gratification; (2) Erotica focuses on yearning to reach \"consummation\", which may occur in \"tortuous delay\", while pornography is only about the \"acts\" to reach it as soon as possible and \"a frenzy of repetition\"; (3) Erotica uses imagination as the \"invisible and ever-active participant\" without revealing the \"mystery of love\", while pornography is no more than an explicit story of sexual intercourse.\n\nThe magisterium of the Catholic Church interprets Matthew 5:27–28 to mean that since the purpose of pornography is to create lust, it is sinful, because lusting is equivalent to adultery. As the \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\" explains:\"Pornography\" consists in removing real or simulated sexual acts from the intimacy of the partners, in order to display them deliberately to third parties. It offends against chastity because it perverts the conjugal act, the intimate giving of spouses to each other. It does grave injury to the dignity of its participants (actors, vendors, the public), since each one becomes an object of base pleasure and illicit profit for others. It immerses all who are involved in the illusion of a fantasy world. It is a grave offense. Civil authorities should prevent the production and distribution of pornographic materials.\n\nCardinal Karol Wojtyla, before he became Pope John Paul II, wrote in \"Love and Responsibility\": \"Pornography is a marked tendency to accentuate the sexual element when reproducing the human body or human love in a work of art, with the object of inducing the reader or viewer to believe that sexual values are the only real values of the person, and that love is nothing more than the experience, individual or shared, of those values alone.\" Edward Sri explains about the topic of art and pornography, which is discussed in the book by contrasting Michelangelo's works with \"Playboy\", by saying that \"good art leads us to a peaceful contemplation of the true, the good and the beautiful, including the truth, goodness and beauty of the human body\", while pornography \"stirs in us a sensuous craving for the body of another person as an object to be exploited for our own pleasure\" and, if it is left uncontrolled, \"we will become enslaved to everything that stimulates our sensual desire\". When one constantly views pornography, which is focused merely on \"the visible and the erotic\", and reduces the human person to what is visible with the eyes, he or she will have difficulties relating to people of different gender in real life, since he or she would have become accustomed to seeing them as \"objects to be used\".\n\nIn a series of lectures called the \"Theology of the Body\", Pope John Paul II argues that some works of art depict naked individuals without evoking lust, but \"makes it possible to concentrate, in a way, on the whole truth of man, and the dignity and beauty—also the 'suprasensual' beauty—of his masculinity and feminity\", and that such works \"bear within them, almost hidden, an element of sublimation\". He insists that pornography is problematic since \"it fails to portray everything that is human\".\n\nHarry Reid notes that, during the Reformation, \"Calvin's aim was straightforward, if ambitious; he wanted to create a perfect Christian community where everyone looked after everyone else... He persuaded the council to legislate against adultery, prostitution, pornography, gambling, drunkenness and much else.\"\n\nAccording to Manetsch, the Genevan Consistory regularly censured literature they deemed dangerous for public morals, including pornography.\n\nOboler also notes that pornography was censored in Geneva and Puritan New England in order to defend against \"ungodly eroticism\".\n\nMax Weber argued that there was a concern that eroticism was a kind of idolatry that went against God's rational regulation of sexuality through marriage alone.\n\nMartin E. Marty notes that, today, both mainstream and evangelical Protestants remain overwhelmingly opposed to pornography and that you will find \"very, very few theological statements that go light on pornography.\"\n\nIn 1990, the Lutheran Church of Australia condemned pornography by publishing an official position on \"X-rated videos\".\n\nDoctor John Kleinig, Lecturer Emeritus at the Australian Lutheran College, argues that, \"The regular use of pornography for masturbation is a kind of sexual addiction. When Paul speaks about impurity and sexual greed as idolatry in Ephesians 5:3-7 and Colossians 3:5, he accurately describes how it works. It begins with sexual impurity, the defilement of our imagination by depictions of sexual intercourse that present naked bodies as idols for us to admire. Our fixation on these images arouses disordered desires and make us more and more greedy for sexual satisfaction from things that God has not given to us for our enjoyment. Yet they fail to satisfy us and serve only to feed our growing appetite for them... Where masturbation is involved... the more ashamed we become, the more secretive we become; the more secretive we become and the more we hide in the darkness, the more vulnerable we become to the accusation and condemnation of Satan... You need to be careful that Satan does not distort your perception by making a fool of you and getting you to focus on the wrong thing. Nowhere in the Bible is masturbation explicitly forbidden. There is good reason for this because the problem does not come from masturbation, which is in itself neither good or bad, but the adulterous sexual fantasies that accompany it, as Christ makes clear in Matthew 5:28. That’s the problem spiritually! ... That’s how Satan gets a hold on us through our imagination. If you use pornography to masturbate, you put another woman, an idol that promises heaven and gives you hell, sexually, in the place of your wife. It arouses your greed for what you don’t have, greed for what God has not given for you to enjoy, greed that increases as you give in to it. The more you indulge it, the more dissatisfied and empty you become.\"\n\nThe Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) condemns pornography. The Church refuses to invest in any company producing pornography, stating that, \"Human dignity is based on the belief that women and men are created in God's image. This results in the mission to protect this dignity against derogatory, denigrating, or degrading portrayals. The analysis of this criterion should not only consider pornographic products, but also the producers of videos depicting violence and likewise computer games glamourizing violence.\"\n\nIn a statement on the role of the media, the EKD's 1997 synod stated, \"According to the churches, public broadcasting plays a vital role in guaranteeing the freedom of opinion and access to a variety of information in Germany. Maintaining and strengthening this system, which is \"almost unique\" in the world, is \"imperative\", said Bishop Engelhardt... In view of its greater freedom in producing programmes, it has \"a special obligation to practise voluntary control\". Now that \"violations of taboos and norms\" are constantly increasing, public control and self-regulation of the media must be increased. This also applies to the protection of \"religious convictions\", said Bishop Lehmann. First attempts made by German Internet providers to introduce voluntary self-regulation need to be improved. Nothing glorifying violence, instigating racial hatred, violating human dignity, glorifying war or pornography must be available on-line...\"\n\nThe EKD's 1997 synod also \"spoke out for action against child pornography on the Internet. All legal methods must be applied to counteract it. Additionally, the German government should pursue sharper criminal proceedings against people who traffic in women.\"\n\nThe Church of Sweden declared, \"It is not permissible [for us] to invest in media companies that have a clear link to pornography.\"\n\nThe United Protestant Church of France (EPUdf) teaches that pornography is a sin. According to Pastor Gilles Boucomont, \"The Bible does not talk about pornography. It says that sexuality is lived properly as part of a commitment, marriage. Outside of this context, sexuality is adultery if one is already married or sexual misconduct if one is not yet married. Misconduct and adultery break the unity that God wants for the married man and woman (1 Corinthians 6 and 7, Mark 10: 1-12)... Watching pornography is not doing a sexual act with anyone, certainly. However, Jesus considers that adultery begins in the eye (Matthew 5,28). There is also no need for a large dissertation to explain that viewing such films does not favor the formation or continuity of stable couples. The second aspect of our problem lies in our responsibility for the people who shoot such films. Jesus asks us to love our neighbor as ourselves. If we do not think we have to surrender our bodies for money, because that is not God's good will for the human, we can not support this practice.\" Masturbation is also considered sinful.\n\nOn the topic of non-sexual nudity, the EPUdf teaches, \"Sin is what separates me from God or comes from my separation from Him. Therefore, nudity, whether sexual or not, must be considered in the context of relationships with God and others. Going to a mixed sauna ... if it's only with my partner, in my opinion, I do not see the problem... If it is with other people, it seems to me legitimate to ask questions about the temptation that can arise and the reasons that make me go. If there is already a habit of nudity in the civilization to which I belong, it may also not be of a nature to distract me from God. I think it's the same for the nude.\"\n\nThe Calvinist Protestant Church of Switzerland also condemns pornography. Pastor Jean-Charles Bichet writes, \"Pornography... gives a distorted image of sexuality. It can cause more problems than it solves... And the sad thing about all this is that it gives the opportunity for a juicy trade . People who agree to pose for photos or to play X rated scenes have not all chosen to do so. By consuming porn, humans are also taking responsibility for this kind of trafficking. In this sense, we are sinners because we find ourselves involved in this general problem of society. The Bible does not specifically refer to pornography, but it often makes harsh judgments about the exploitation of people and prostitution. It reminds us that we are all created in the image of God, that we are little brothers and sisters of Jesus, the Son of God, live in liberated and happy people. The Bible constantly reminds us that none of us is a commodity. None of us should be treated like a shirt that is thrown away.\"\n\nIn the 1980s, the liberal Presbyterian Church (USA) produced a report entitled, \"Pornography: Far from the Song of Songs\", which states, \"Through words and images, pornography debases God’s intended gifts of love and dignity in human sexuality... we live in an age also marked by the shattering of many norms of behavior and the subsequent loss of moral restraints. In such a time pornography has proliferated. The task force believes that the church is called to give serious attention to this issue... Reflected in the title of this report is the conviction that pornography represents human discord, far from the mutual sexual delight depicted biblically in the Song of Songs. Pornography is a striking sign of human brokenness and alienation from God and from one another... From the perspective of biblical understanding and the Reformed tradition, pornography represents a vivid expression of human alienation: from the creator God who makes covenants and from one another as covenant partners of God.\"\n\nIn its church magazine, the Presbyterian Church in Canada argues against pornography on the grounds that it is addictive, it alters the brain, that pornographers are trying to normalize the industry and that it can distract Christians who are trying to perform nightly devotions.\n\nThe United Methodist Church teaches that pornography is \"about violence, degradation, exploitation, and coercion\" and \"deplore[s] all forms of commercialization, abuse, and exploitation of sex\", and defines pornography as \"sexually explicit material that portrays violence, abuse, coercion, domination, humiliation, or degradation for the purpose of arousal. In addition, any sexually explicit material that depicts children is pornographic\".\" The \"Sexual Ethics Task Force of The United Methodist Church\" states that \"Research shows it [pornography] is not an 'innocent activity.' It is harmful and is generally addictive. Persons who are addicted to pornography are physiologically altered, as is their perspective, relationships with parishioners and family, and their perceptions of girls and women.\"\n\nThe liberal-leaning Uniting Church of Australia also condemns pornography and works in society to address the problem.\n\nIn 1990, Quakers declared, \"Since pornographic materials promote and propagate a lifestyle that includes activities which are condemned by God's Word and tempt viewers to commit the sin of lust (Matthew 5:27-28: Romans 13:14; II Peter 2:14, 18-19), Friends therefore are urged to carefully avoid exposure to such materials. Because of our responsibility as Christian citizens (Matthew 5:13; Proverbs 14:34) and in view of the evil, exploitative, and destructive effects of pornography on individuals, families, and our society, Friends are encouraged to prayerfully and boldly oppose the production and distribution of pornographic materials in their local communities, as well as at the state and national levels (Ephesians 5:11).\"\n\nMennonites believe pornography is sinful. In a major report, the Mennonite Central Committee notes, \"One misconception is that adult pornography has no victims: it’s a harmless, pleasurable activity which damages no one. Yet, research and experience increasingly show that pornography does cause harm: to one’s relationship with God, to human relationships, to the user, to those in the industry and to society in general.\" The report goes on to elaborate how it causes this harm.\n\nIn 2002, researcher Martin E. Marty noted that, \"... most of the anti-porn activity is indeed from fundamentalist and evangelical groups... What keeps [American] mainstream Protestants from being consistently up front on an issue that... quite possibly leads to rape and other crimes, demeans the \"user,\" and benefits the billions-per-year exploiter, has little to do with pornography. Instead it connects with their heavy commitment to free speech, their fear lest countering pornography in communications might erode the defenses against intrusions on precious liberties. Such Protestants are slow to promote boycotts and extremely cautious about legislation in areas so necessarily ill-defined as pornography. Caught between their abhorrence of pornography and their passion for liberties and rights, mainline Protestants, most Catholics, Reform Jews, and others have not found effective ways to be up front on this important front.\"\n\nTwo other American researchers, Sherkat and Ellison, produced a study which shows, \"that Conservative Protestant opposition to pornography is rooted in commitments to Biblical inerrancy and solidified by high rates of religious participation. Inerrancy serves as a cognitive resource informing two separate paths to pornography opposition: moral absolutism and beliefs in the threat of social contamination.\"\n\nJerry Falwell has criticized pornography, saying sex is reserved for heterosexual married couples, to be used only in accordance with God's will (more specifically, to both solidify the emotional bonds between the man and his lawfully wedded wife, and to help propagate the human race (\"Be fruitful, and multiply.\")), and asserts that use of pornography involves indulgence in lust towards people other than one's spouse (which in Christianity is a sin) and leads to an overall increase in sexually immoral behavior (including, for example, adultery, rape, and/or even child molestation).\n\nWilliam M. Struthers in his book, \"Wired for Intimacy\", has criticized pornography from a scientific viewpoint, suggesting that the viewing and use of pornography embeds abnormal neural pathways in the brain such that the desire for physical sexual relations may become subverted over time.\n\nThe 1998 Lambeth Conference Resolution I.10 states, \"... Clearly some expressions of sexuality are inherently contrary to the Christian way and are sinful. Such unacceptable expression of sexuality include promiscuity, prostitution, incest, pornography, paedophilia, predatory sexual behaviour, and sadomasochism (all of which may be heterosexual and homosexual), adultery, violence against wives, and female circumcision. From a Christian perspective these forms of sexual expression remain sinful in any context. We are particularly concerned about the pressures on young people to engage in sexual activity at an early age, and we urge our Churches to teach the virtue of abstinence.\"\n\nThe Anglican Diocese of Melbourne published an article which noted that, \"Pornography is prostitution, as men pay money, time and dignity for gratification. This payment might not be direct, but the support of pornography feeds the human trafficking industry, in which some 27 million women and children are trapped worldwide. The harlot that used to be on the street corner is now our computer.\"\n\nThe Anglican Diocese of Sydney has established an \"Archbishop's Taskforce for Resisting Pornography\", which at the end of 2017, was seeking to establish a \"resistingporn.org\" website. The taskforce chairman has noted, \"We know porn can alter desires and can affect self-control and compulsive behaviours. Studies have shown that the brains of long-term porn users behave similarly to those of drug addicts. There are also other effects... such as increasing incidences of adultery and earlier first-time sexual activity. It also goes without saying pornography is incompatible with God’s good purposes for the world.\"\n\nGordon B. Hinckley, president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1995 to 2008, was known within the faith for expounding his organization's sentiments against pornography.\nThe LDS Church teaches that pornography is \"any material depicting or describing the human body or sexual conduct in a way that arouses sexual feelings. It is as harmful to the spirit as tobacco, alcohol, and drugs are to the body. Members of the Church should avoid pornography in any form and should oppose its production, distribution, and use.\"\n\nPornography is directly opposed to the very heart of Islamic teachings, which is highlighted by Taqwa to gain a better self-control. The Shariah and the basic Islamic ethical principles emphasize the guarding of one's private parts, instructs lowering of gazes & recommends maintaining of modesty. These teachings fundamentally apply equally to looking at private parts in pictures or films, it is so to increase spiritual awareness and taqwa and prepare the soul to taste the sweetness of Imaan (Utter Belief in the commandments of Allah).\n\nThat opposition between this \"porn-use\" attitude with the \"fitra\" (reverence instinct toward Allah, that all humans have, whether they are aware of it or not), creates a state of tension that leads to the destruction of the soul, leading to sadness and depression, and loss of self-esteem. That is why, in Islam, pornography is seen as a fundamentally destructive force to eradicate from one's life and from society.\n\nIn the famous 151st verse of the chapter named An'am, among the five chief commandments, in the fourth one Allah says, \"and do not even draw to things shameful - be they open or secret.\"\n\nThe Qur'an 24:30 states, \"Tell the acknowledging men to lower their gaze and guard their private parts, for that is purer for them. God is fully aware of what you do.\"\n\nThe Qur'an 24:31 states \"And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and keep covered their private parts, and that they should not show-off their beauty except what is apparent, and let them cast their shawls over their cleavage. And let them not show off their beauty except to their husbands... \"\nTherefore, it is stated by Islamic scholars that one can only look lustfully at the nakedness or the body of someone who is one's spouse, and if a Muslim sees someone or something that arouses them, including pornography, they should avoid looking at it. Hence, the justification for declaring pornography haram in Islam.\n\nThe Qur'an says what means \"They are your garments and you are their garments.\" (2:187) \"The sexual unison between husband and wife is more than seeking a relief from the urge of desire. Indeed the prophet taught that it is one of the charities in Islam. He said to his companions, enumerating examples of charitable deeds :'And when the one of you makes love (has sex with wife/husband) it is a rewardable charity.\n\nMichael Coogan stated that the Tanakh does not have any specific laws relating to pornography and Judaism has always had a positive attitude to sex. In fact, some commentators note, the Bible itself contains erotica, such as the Song of Songs.\n\nMaimonides, in his Mishneh Torah, writes, based on the Talmud that \"A person who stares at even a small finger of a woman with the intent of deriving pleasure is considered as if he looked at her genitalia. It is even forbidden to hear the voice of a woman with whom sexual relations are prohibited, or to look at her hair.\" This is further codified in the Code of Jewish Law, which includes further prohibitions (based on the Talmud) such as \"watching women as they do the laundry.\" Accordingly, pornography would be forbidden a fortiori.\n\nAdditionally, Jewish laws of modesty and humility (\"tzniut\") require Jewish women to dress modestly. Jewish law thus precludes Jewish women from engaging in pornographic modelling or acting, besides other acts of immodesty.\n\nThe issue is also, according to Chabad.org, one of personal control over one's urges, which pornography, it is asserted, takes away.\n\nAlthough there is no direct prohibition of pornography in Sikhism, Sikhs argue that pornographic books and films, prostitution and lust leads to adultery. Pornography is said to encourage lust (Kaam), which is a concept described as an unhealthy obsession for sex and sexual activity. Kaam is classed as one of the 'Five Thieves', personality traits which are heavily discouraged for Sikhs, as they \"can build barriers against God in their lives\".\n\nPornography is not explicitly discouraged in Sikhism however; only lustfulness is. In Sikh belief pornography would only be tantamount to a sin if it becomes a flaw in one's spiritual nature.\n\n"}
{"id": "404304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=404304", "title": "Rock musical", "text": "Rock musical\n\nA rock musical is a musical theatre work with rock music. The genre of rock musical may overlap somewhat with album musicals, concept albums and song cycles, as they sometimes tell a story through the rock music, and some album musicals and concept albums become rock musicals. Notable examples of rock musicals include \"Next to Normal\", \"Spring Awakening\", \"Rent\", \"Grease\", and \"Hair\". The Who's \"Tommy\" and other rock operas are sometimes presented on stage as a musical.\n\nThe rock musical became an important part of the musical theatre scene in the late 1960s with the hit show \"Hair\". Styled \"The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical,\" the anti-war free-love hippie-themed, nude-scened \"Hair\" premiered in 1967 as the first production staged at The Public Theater. It moved to Broadway in October 1968. \"Your Own Thing\" also opened in 1968 and featured a gender-switching version of William Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\". However, the first musical to hint at what was to come had been the final edition of the Ziegfeld Follies in 1957. This production featured one rock and roll number, \"The Juvenile Delinquent\". The song was performed by fifty-year-old Billy De Wolfe. This was followed by another precursor to the rock musical, \"Bye Bye Birdie\" (1960).\" Although rock and roll would have to wait for seven more years before returning to Broadway, these early, tentative infusions of rock into musical theatre paved the way for \"Hair\" and its progeny.\n\n\"Jesus Christ Superstar\", composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, began as an album musical in 1970. The money made from album sales was used to fund the subsequent stage production in late 1971. This show and some other rock musicals that have no dialogue or are otherwise reminiscent of opera, with dramatic, emotional themes, are sometimes styled \"rock operas\". The musical \"Godspell\" (1971), had similar religious themes (albeit with a less controversial treatment) and pop/rock influences. The genre continued to develop through the 1970s with shows such as \"Grease\" and \"Pippin\". The rock musical soon moved in other directions with shows like \"The Wiz\", \"Raisin\", \"Dreamgirls\" and \"Purlie\", which were heavily influenced by R&B and soul music.\n\nThe rock musical saw a decline in popularity through the 1980s. Except for a few outposts of rock, like \"Little Shop of Horrors\" (1982) and \"Chess\" (1986), audience tastes turned to shows with European pop scores, like \"Les Misérables\" and \"The Phantom of the Opera\", as well as to more nostalgic fare. However, the rock musical achieved a renaissance in the 1990s, due in no small part to the popularity of Jonathan Larson's rock musical \"Rent\" (1996). This was followed by Off-Broadway rock musicals like \"\" (1997) and \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\" (1998), John Cameron Mitchell's Off-Broadway show about a transgender rocker. The end of the 1980s saw the beginning of a new form, jukebox musicals, such as \"Buddy – The Buddy Holly Story\", \"Mamma Mia!\" and \"Jersey Boys\", which feature the songs of a popular band, performer or genre.\n\nThe rock musical has seen a resurgence in the late 1990s and the 2000s, with shows by composers like Elton John (\"Aida\", 1998), as well as a number of successful jukebox musicals with rock scores. Recent major original rock musical productions include \"Spring Awakening\" (2007), \"Passing Strange\" and \"Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson\" (both 2008), \"Rock of Ages\" and \"Next to Normal\" (both 2009), and \"American Idiot\" (2010).\n\nIn 2010, critic Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\" pointed out that all four of the musicals nominated for the Tony Award for Best Musical that year could be described as rock musicals. He analyzed the history and future of rock on Broadway:\nRock’s takeover of Broadway was not the revolution that had been feared – or anticipated – ever since \"Hair\" ... Broadway held out for many years as a bastion against youth culture. ... Rock’s Broadway invasion has been, instead, a lengthy campaign of attrition, via demographics, shifting tastes and musicians’ ambitions. Every few years another production [was] touted as finally bringing full-fledged rock to musical theater: \"Rent\", \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\" ... \"Spring Awakening\". Very gradually rock musicians have stopped treating Broadway as an adversary – or a punch line. And for fans it has become one more entertainment option, as prices for arena shows reach Broadway levels.\n\nPareles commented, \"rock has been transformed from nemesis to novelty to mainstay. ... Broadway productions can’t match the visceral impact – starting with volume – of a rock concert. (They try to make up for it with enthusiasm and slicker dancing.)\" Another problem for rock musicals is that rock shows \"still leave theatergoers complaining that the characters are hollow. ... [However,] Broadway does provide current rock two major incentives. As the artistic unit of the album has been shattered, down to a handful of shuffled MP3’s, musical theater offers a refuge for songwriters who want to tell longer stories, the way the songwriter Stew did in his autobiographical rock musical \"Passing Strange\".\" Pareles also noted, \"Broadway may be the final place in America, if not the known universe, where rock still registers as rebellious. In the decorous little jewel boxes that are Broadway’s theaters, raunch seems raunchier, and rock musicals flaunt four-letter words and lascivious simulations. ... There are, of course, commercial incentives. Broadway’s unbudgingly middle-aged audience is currently a generation that grew up on rock and R&B and generally feels more comfortable taking reserved seats in small theaters than plunging into the scrum of a standing-room club audience, or dealing with a rowdy arena mob.\"\n\nPareles attributed some of the new acceptance of rock as theatre to \"American Idol\" and its ilk, noting that some of the show's stars have moved to theatre. Also, \"Rock’s old protestations of authenticity (versus Broadway contrivance) have been crumbling. As if glam rock in the ’70s and music video in the ’80s weren’t obvious enough in presenting rock as theater, pop’s video-era arena spectacles use the same technology as Las Vegas revues and Broadway shows.\" Another driver of rock's acceptance is its own entry into middle age, Pareles said, noting that \"as rock’s history stretches out ever longer ... it offers just as much room for ... the familiarity and nostalgia that keep the jukebox musicals running. Still, Pareles concluded, \"the last, crucial thrill of a rock performance – the unpredictability – stays just beyond Broadway’s reach. Two nights after the official opening of \"American Idiot\", Green Day itself played an unannounced encore. The show had poured on its razzle-dazzle. ... But Green Day set off pandemonium. ... Green Day’s members may not be able to act or execute choreography ... but they also hold rock’s wild card: the potential, realized or not, for spontaneity.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2842531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2842531", "title": "Rod Smallwood", "text": "Rod Smallwood\n\nRoderick Charles Smallwood (born 17 February 1950) is an English music manager, best known as the co-manager of the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden. With his business partner, Andy Taylor, whom he met while studying at Trinity College, Cambridge, he founded the Sanctuary Records Group in 1979, which became the largest independent record label in the UK and the largest independent music management company in the world until its closure in 2007. Prior to managing Iron Maiden, Smallwood managed Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel.\n\nSmallwood was born and raised in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, where he grew up listening to The Beatles and The Rolling Stones on the radio and playing cricket and rugby union. It was only when he began attending university that his musical interests expanded and he began listening to Deep Purple, Pink Floyd, Grateful Dead and The Doors.\n\nIn the autumn of 1968, Smallwood began studying architecture at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he soon became involved in organising social events, such as the annual Trinity May Ball, for which he booked the \"various acts\". It was while undertaking these duties that he formed a friendship with fellow undergraduate and future business partner Andy Taylor. From then on, Smallwood and Taylor worked on end-of-term events together and booked various musicians, including Graham Bond, Chris Farlowe, Bridget St John, John Martyn, and, most notably, the MC5. Smallwood acquired most of these artists from a local booking agency, Horus Arts, whose boss, Barry Hawkins, gave Smallwood advice which led to his career as a booking agent.\n\nShortly before his final exams in 1971, Smallwood dropped out of university and moved to Paris with his girlfriend, stating that \"it just seemed like the cool thing to do\". After three months in Paris, Smallwood undertook a job at a London booking agency, Gemini, in order to finance a trip to Morocco. Through his work with Gemini, Smallwood was offered a \"£35 a week\" job with rival agency MAM, and therefore abandoned his trip to Morocco. After 18 months with MAM, Smallwood began managing English rock act Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel. Smallwood disliked working with Harley, whom he would later describe as \"a pain - selfish, egotistical, obsessed\" and thus \"completely put me off management.\" Convinced by EMI, Harley fired Trigram, his management agency, and Smallwood undertook the management of punk rock act Gloria Mundi.\n\nIn 1979, Smallwood decided to return to university to obtain a law degree, where he was given a copy of Iron Maiden's demo tape. After much deliberation, Smallwood eventually contacted Steve Harris, the band's bassist and founder member, and arranged two pub gigs for the group in west London, one at the Windsor Castle in Maida Vale and the other at The Swan in Hammersmith. Neither show went to plan- the first was cancelled after the band refused to play early, and the band had to perform the second without lead vocalist, Paul Di'Anno, who was arrested for carrying a knife 30 minutes before the gig. In spite of this, Smallwood agreed to help the group, although, following his experiences with Steve Harley, he did not initially commit to becoming their full-time manager until he arranged the band's signing to EMI and publishers Zomba at the end of the year. Eventually joined by Andy Taylor in 1982, the pair have managed the group ever since.\n\nAfter committing himself to managing Iron Maiden in October 1979, Smallwood decided to form his own management company, which he would name after Iron Maiden's second single, \"Sanctuary\". Sanctuary Records Group eventually expanded into the largest independent record label in the United Kingdom until its closure in 2007. Prior to this, in November 2006, Smallwood left Sanctuary and formed Phantom Music Management with Andy Taylor, which focuses solely on Iron Maiden. \n\nThe Iron Maiden b-side \"Sheriff of Huddersfield\" was written by Iron Maiden about Rod Smallwood, and was released on the 1986 single \"Wasted Years\". It likens Smallwood to the Sheriff of Nottingham, due to his notorious stinginess with money, and refers to his frequent complaining about a (then recent) move to Los Angeles. Smallwood did not know about the song until the single was released.\n"}

They made their film debut in 1997, starring in their feature film \"Spice World\". The film was a commercial success, but was widely panned by critics, earning the group the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress.\n\nThe Spice Girls have hosted various television specials. In November 1997, the Spice Girls became the first pop group to host ITV's \"An Audience with...\"; their show featured an all-female audience and was watched by 11.8 million viewers in the UK, one fifth of the country's total population. On Christmas Eve that year, the group presented a \"Spice Girls on Top of the Pops\" television special on BBC One. Concert specials of their three tours in the late 1990s were also broadcast. On Christmas Day 1997, ITV aired a concert special titled \"Spice Up Your Christmas\", which consisted of highlights from the Spice Girls' October 1997 concert in Istanbul. \"The Spice Girls In Concert - Wild!\" pay-per-view concert special of the group's October 1997 show in Istanbul aired on various dates throughout 1998 in the US on Showtime. Its first airing on 17 January 1998 was the highest-rated music pay-per-view in seven years. The concert was aired again in the US on Fox Family Channel on 16 August 1998, receiving a 1.8 household rating despite being up against a four-hour Spice Girls MTV special and a different pay-per-view Spice Girls concert airing the same weekend. In September 1998, a television special titled \"Spice Girls: Live in Your Living Room\" was aired on Sky One. In it, Dani Behr and Georgie Stait presented live coverage of the Spice Girls' concert at Wembley Stadium, including a live fan call-in segment, interview footage with the group, and in-studio guests, followed by a live broadcast of the full concert. In 1999, a television special of the group's concert at Earl's Court titled \"Spice Girls: The Live One\" was broadcast in various countries and also included a documentary containing rehearsals and interviews with the Spice Girls.\n\nThe Spice Girls have released at least seven official behind-the-scenes television documentaries, including two tour documentaries and two making-of documentaries for their film \"Spice World\". December 1997 was the release of their first official US television documentary \"Too Much Is Never Enough\" on UPN. The documentary focused on their reaction to their sudden rise to fame around the world, and was watched by 5.4 million viewers. In December 2007, the official documentary, \"Spice Girls: Giving You Everything\", made its world premiere in Australia on FOX8. It aired on CTV in Canada on 19 December 2007, and on BBC One in the United Kingdom on 31 December 2007. The documentary attracted 3.5 million viewers in the UK, coming in second in its timeslot. In December 2012, the official documentary \"The Spice Girls' Story: Viva Forever!\" was aired on ITV to promote the group's West End musical \"Viva Forever\". The Spice Girls have also been the subject of a number of unofficial documentaries. In March 2001, ITV aired an unauthorised documentary about the Spice Girls titled \"Raw Spice\". The film, which focused on the group before they became famous and featured never before seen footage of them from 1994, was the subject of four-year-long legal disputes with former members of the film's production company and the Spice Girls themselves, who tried to prevent it from being screened. The documentary was the most-watched program of the night that it aired, drawing 9.4 million viewers—almost 40% of the available audience. The Spice Girls have had episodes dedicated to them in several music biography series, including VH1's \"Behind the Music\", \"E! True Hollywood Story\", and MTV's \"BioRhythm\".\n\nThe Spice Girls have appeared and performed in numerous television shows and events. In February 1997, the Spice Girls opened the 1997 Brit Awards with Geri Halliwell wearing the iconic Union Jack dress whilst performing onstage with the group. Their performance won Most Memorable Performance Of 30 Years at the 2010 Brit Awards. The band performed again at the 2000 Brit Awards, where they were presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award by Will Smith. Other notable appearances include \"Saturday Night Live (SNL)\", \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" and two \"Royal Variety Performances\". In June 1998, the group also performed their songs \"Stop\" and \"Viva Forever\" live with Luciano Pavarotti at his \"Pavarotti & Friends for the Children of Liberia\" benefit concert in Italy. The Spice Girls performed at the 2000 MTV Europe Music Awards; it was the group's last performance before their split in December that year, until their 2007 reunion. The first public performance by the Spice Girls during their 2007 reunion was made at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, where the group performed at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. They performed two songs, 1998 single \"Stop\" and the lead single from their greatest hits album, \"Headlines (Friendship Never Ends)\". The show was broadcast in December 2007, and was watched by 7.4 million viewers on CBS and 2.94 million viewers on The CW. In August 2012, after much speculation and anticipation from the press and the public, the group performed a medley of \"Wannabe\" and \"Spice Up Your Life\" at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony, reuniting solely for the event. Their performance became the most tweeted moment of the entire Olympics with over 116,000 tweets on Twitter per minute.\n\nThe Spice Girls have also starred in television commercials as part of their endorsement deals with several brands. In 1997 and 1998, they starred in commercials for Pepsi, Polaroid, Walkers Crisps, Impulse and Aprilia. For their 2007 reunion, the group starred in two commercials for British supermarket chain Tesco during the Christmas season. One of their Tesco commercials ranked number four in the \"Top 10 ads with the highest recall of 2008\" in Marketing Week's annual \"Adwatch\" rankings.\n\nThis list is selective; the Spice Girls have appeared, performed and been interviewed in numerous television shows worldwide.

{"id": "6065293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6065293", "title": "Stork Club", "text": "Stork Club\n\nThe Stork Club was a nightclub in Manhattan, New York City, which during its existence from 1929 to 1965 was one of the most prestigious clubs in the world. A symbol of café society, the wealthy elite, including movie stars, celebrities, showgirls, and aristocrats all mixed in the VIP Cub Room of the club.\n\nThe club was established on West 58th Street in 1929 by Sherman Billingsley, a former bootlegger from Enid, Oklahoma. After an incident when Billingsley was kidnapped and held for ransom by Mad Dog Coll, a rival of his mobster partners, he became the sole owner of the Stork Club. The club remained at its original location until it was raided by Prohibition agents in 1931. After the raid, it moved to East 51st Street. From 1934 until its closure in 1965, it was located at 3 East 53rd Street, just east of Fifth Avenue, when it became world-renowned with its celebrity clientele and luxury. Billingsley was known for his lavish gifts, which brought a steady stream of celebrities to the club and also insured that those interested in the famous would have a reason to visit.\n\nUntil World War II, the club consisted of a dining room and bar with restrooms on upper floors with many mirrors and fresh flowers throughout. Billingsley originally built the well-known Cub Room as a private place where he could play cards with friends. Described as a \"lopsided oval\", the room had wood paneled walls hung with portraits of beautiful women and had no windows. A head waiter known as \"Saint Peter\" determined who was allowed entry to the Cub Room, where Walter Winchell wrote his columns and broadcast his radio programs from Table 50.\n\nDuring the years of its operation, the club was visited by many political, social, and celebrity figures. It counted among its guests the Kennedy and Roosevelt families, and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. The news of Grace Kelly's engagement to Prince Rainier of Monaco broke while the couple were visiting the Stork Club. Socialite Evalyn Walsh McLean, owner of the Hope Diamond, once lost the gem under a Stork Club table during an evening visit to the club. Ernest Hemingway was able to cash his $100,000 check for the film rights of \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" at the Stork Club to settle his bill.\n\nIn the 1940s, workers of the Stork Club desired to be represented by a union, and by 1957, the employees of all similar New York venues were union members. However, Billingsley was still unwilling to allow his workers to organize, which led to union supporters picketing in front of the club for many years until its closure. During this time, many of the club's celebrity and non-celebrity guests stopped visiting the Stork Club; it closed in 1965 and was demolished the following year. The site is now the location of Paley Park, a small vest-pocket park.\n\nThe Stork Club was owned and operated by Sherman Billingsley (1896–1966) an ex-bootlegger who came to New York from Enid, Oklahoma. The \"Stork Club\" first opened in 1929 at 132 West 58th Street, just down the street from Billingsley's apartment at 152 West 58th Street. Billingsley's handwritten recollections of the early days recall that he was approached by two gamblers he knew from Oklahoma in his New York real estate office, proposing to open a restaurant together, which he accepted. The origin of the name of the club is unknown; Billingsley once remarked, \"Don't ask me how or why I picked the name, because I just don't remember.\" New York City's El Morocco had the sophistication and Toots Shor's drew the sporting crowd, but the Stork Club mixed power, money, and glamor. Unlike its competitors, the Stork stayed open on Sunday nights and during the summer months.\n\nOne of the first Stork Club customers was writer Heywood Broun, who resided in the vicinity. Broun's first visit to the Stork was actually made by mistake; he believed it to be a funeral home, but he soon became a regular, and invited his celebrity friends, as the name of the club spread further afield. Before long, Billingsley's Oklahoma partners sold their shares to a man named Thomas Healy. Eventually Healy revealed that he was a \"front\" for three New York mobsters. Billingsley was kidnapped and held for ransom by Mad Dog Coll, who was a rival of his mob partners. Before the ransom money could be collected by Coll, he was lured to a telephone booth where he was shot to death. After the incident, the secret gangster partners reluctantly allowed Billingsley to buy them out for $30,000.\n\nAnother New York nightclub owner, Tex Guinan, introduced Billingsley to her friend, the entertainment and gossip columnist Walter Winchell, in 1930. In September 1930, Winchell called the Stork Club \"New York's New Yorkiest place on W. 58th\" in his \"New York Daily Mirror\" column. That evening, the Stork Club was filled with moneyed guests. Someone else who read Winchell's column in 1930 was singer-actress Helen Morgan, who had just finished filming a movie on Long Island. Morgan decided to hold a cast party at the Stork Club, paying the tab with two $1,000 bills. Winchell became a regular at the Stork Club; what he saw and heard there at his private Table 50 was the basis of his newspaper columns and radio broadcasts. Billingsley also kept professionals on his staff whose job was to listen to the chatter, determine fact from rumor, and then report the factual news to local columnists. The practice was seen as protective of the patrons by shielding them from unfounded reports, and also a continual source of publicity for the club. Billingsley's long-standing relationship with Ethel Merman which began in 1939, brought the theater crowd to the Stork; there she had a waiter assigned to her whose job was just to light her cigarettes. Billingsley later wrote that Merman had offered him $500,000 to leave his wife and that he turned down the offer.\n\nProhibition agents closed the original club on December 22, 1931, and Billingsley moved it to East 51st Street for three years. It was raided in August 1932 at the 51st Street location after an angry patron lost a quarter in a coin machine and notified police. The police asked guests to quietly pay their checks and leave the building; this took two hours. In 1934, the Stork Club moved to 3 East 53rd Street, where it remained until it closed in October 1965. Billingsley's guest list for the 53rd Street opening consisted of people from Broadway and Park Avenue. He sent out 1,000 invitations for Champagne and dinner. The women found much to like about the fresh flowers everywhere and the mirrored walls, while the men were pleased to see their favorite dishes on the club's menu as well as many of their personal and business friends at the opening. When the Stork Club became a tenant in 1934, the building was known as the Physicians and Surgeons Building. Many of the medical tenants were unhappy about the night club moving in, but in February 1946, Billingsley purchased the seven-story building for $300,000 cash, evicting the doctors to expand the club.\n\nBy 1936, the Stork was doing well enough to have a million-dollar gross for the first time. Young debutante Brenda Frazier made her first visit to the Stork Club in the spring of 1938; she became a regular, bringing many young people from the society set with her. Billingsley welcomed young people who were not old enough to drink. He encouraged them to gather at the Stork Club by inviting debutantes to the club and holding a yearly \"Glamor Girl\" election. As the father of three daughters, Billingsley kept an eye on the young people, making sure they were not served alcohol and that they were able to have an enjoyable time at the Stork Club without it.\n\nThe Stork Club previously provided live entertainment but after Billingsley realized the reason people came to the club was to watch people, he abandoned the floor shows in favor of giving expensive gifts to regular customers of the club. A live band was provided in the main dining room for dancing. Billingsley had a keen sense for business. Before he purchased the building the Stork Club was in, the yearly rent for the space it occupied was $12,000. Billingsley rented out the hat and coat check area to a separate concession for $27,000 a year. This paid the rent for the Stork Club, leaving $15,000 annually to cover bad checks. When Ernest Hemingway wanted to pay his bill with a $100,000 check he received for the movie rights to \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\", Billingsley told him he would be able to cash the check after the club closed at 4:00 a.m. He kept the \"Stork Club's\" name vivid in the minds of his patrons through mailing lists and a club news letter. Billingsley was also aware of the need for a good working relationship with the press; food and drink for reporters and photographers assigned to cover the Stork Club were on the house.\n\nIn early 1944, New York mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia ordered a check on the books of all major city night clubs. City tax accountants soon investigated the Stork Club, the Copacabana, and other city night spots. By July, auditors turned in a report claiming that the clubs were overcharging patrons on tax, sending the city the proper amount and keeping the overbilled sums. On a Saturday in July, city officials arrived at the Stork Club with a court order granting permission for them to seize the club's property for the amount which was claimed to be overcharged as taxes, plus penalties. The total for the Stork Club was $181,000. Billingsley, out of town with his family, was notified. The club's employees refused to turn anything over to the officials, who were intent on closing it. Upon his return, Billingsley firmly protested that the Stork Club did not owe the city any money and was up to date on its tax payments. A compromise was reached: the club could stay open as long as a custodian for the city was allowed to be on the premises. Billingsley was eventually able to get a court order to eject the custodian, but the case dragged on for five years, costing Billingsley $100,000.\n\nOn October 19, 1951, Josephine Baker made charges of racism against the Stork Club. Baker visited the club on October 16 as the guest of Roger Rico and his wife; both entertainers were at the Stork after their theater performances. Baker said she ordered a steak and was apparently still waiting for it an hour later. The controversy grew when Baker accused Walter Winchell of being in the Cub Room at the time and not coming to her aid. Winchell was at the club; he said he had greeted Baker and vocalist Roger Rico as the two left their Cub Room table. Winchell said he was not aware of there being any problem, and left for a late screening of the film \"\". The next morning, Winchell's rumored failure to assist Baker was big news, and he received countless telephone calls. The incident blew into a major scandal and was widely publicized on the radio and newspapers. Mrs. Rico, who was part of the Baker party with her husband, said that Baker's steak was waiting for her at the table after she returned from her phone call, but the entertainer chose to make a stormy exit from the Stork anyhow. News accounts show conflicting statements from the Ricos.\n\nAlong with that of Billingsley and the Stork Club, Walter Winchell's name was further tarnished by the incident. After leaving the Stork, the Baker party made contact with WMCA's Barry Gray, where the story was told as part of Gray's radio talk show. One of those who phoned Gray's program was television personality and columnist Ed Sullivan, a professional rival of Winchell's whose \"home base\" was the El Morocco nightclub. Sullivan's on-air remarks dealt mainly with Winchell's alleged part in the event, saying, \"What Winchell has done is an insult to the United States and American newspapermen.\" Winchell's column of October 24, 1951, provides the same details as earlier news stories about Josephine Baker's accusations that he did not assist her at the Stork Club. Winchell also printed a letter he received from Walter White, who was the executive secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) at the time.\nA New York police investigation of the matter followed the complaint made by the NAACP. The police investigation found that the Stork Club did not discriminate against Josephine Baker. The NAACP went on to say that the results of the police investigation did not provide enough evidence for the organization to pursue the incident further in criminal court. Baker filed suit against Winchell over the matter, but the suit was dismissed in 1955. Walter Winchell later said. \"The Stork Club discriminates against everybody. White, black and pink. The Stork bars all kinds of people for all kinds of reasons. But if your skin is green and you're rich and famous or you're syndicated, you'll be welcome at the club.\"\n\nBecause of Billingsley's long-standing friendship with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) head J. Edgar Hoover, rumors persisted that the Stork Club was bugged. During his work on the Stork Club book, author and \"New York Times\" reporter Ralph Blumenthal was contacted by Jean-Claude Baker, one of Josephine Baker's sons. Having read an article by Blumenthal about Leonard Bernstein's FBI file, he indicated that he had read his mother's FBI file and by comparing the file to the tapes, said he thought the Stork Club incident was overblown.\n\nHard times began for the Stork Club in 1956, when it lost money for the first time. In 1957, unions tried once again to organize the club's employees. Their major effort ten years before had been unsuccessful; at that time, Sherman Billingsley was accused of attempting to influence his employees to stay out of the union with lavish staff parties and financial gifts. By 1957, all other similar New York clubs except the Stork Club were unionized. This met with resistance from Billingsley and many dependable employees left the Stork Club over his refusal to allow them to be represented by a union. Picket lines were set up and marched in front of the club daily for years, including the club's last day of business. The club received many threats connected to his refusal to accept unions for his workers; some of the threats involved Billingsley's family. In 1957, he was arrested for displaying a gun when some painters who were working at the Austrian Consulate next to the family's home sat on his stoop for lunch. Billingsley admitted to acting rashly because of the threats. Three months before his arrest, his secretary was assaulted as she was entering the building where she lived; her assailants made references to the union issues at the Stork Club.\n\nAs a result of the union dispute, many club patrons no longer visited the night spot. Those who were performers were informed of the possibility of fines and suspensions by their respective unions for crossing the Stork Club picket line as the issue continued. Many of Billingsley's friendships, including those of Walter Winchell and J. Edgar Hoover, were over as a result of the union problems. He began firing staff without good cause. As the dispute dragged on, there was also no longer a live band in the dining room for music; members of the Musicians' Union had crossed the picket line to perform for some time. Previously, the club had no need for advertising; it was mentioned frequently in print and word of mouth without it. In 1963, the club offered a hamburger and French fries for $1.99 in a \"New York Times\" advertisement; when those in the know about the club saw it, they realized the Stork Club's days were coming to an end. In the last few months of its operation, at times there were only three customers for the entire evening. On a good day in the mid-1940s, some 2,500 people visited the club.\n\nWhen the Stork Club initially closed its doors, news stories indicated it was being shut because the building it occupied had been sold and a new location was being sought. The years of labor disputes had taken their toll on Billingsley financially. Trying to keep the Stork Club going took all of his assets and about $10 million from his three daughters' trust funds. While in the hospital recuperating from a serious illness in October 1965, Billingsley sold the building to Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), who later turned the site into a park named after its founder's father. In a 1937 interview, Billingsley said, \"I hope I'll be running a night club the last day I live.\" He fell just short of that mark. One year after the Stork Club closed, Sherman Billingsley died of a heart attack at his Manhattan apartment, leaving a wife, Hazel, and three daughters, Jacqueline, Barbara, and Shermane. He was planning on re-opening the Stork Club in another location and was working on writing a book at the time of his death.\n\nFrom the physical layout of the club, as described by Ed Sullivan in a 1939 column, the Stork should have been doomed to failure, since it was strangely shaped and far from roomy in places. The club's ladies' room was on the second floor of the structure and the men's room was on the third; only the dining room, bar, and later the Cub Room were on the first floor. Despite this, the club could hold 1,000 guests. A feature of the club was a solid 14-karat gold chain at its entrance; patrons were allowed entry through it by the doorman. When the East 53rd Street building came down to make way for Paley Park, one of the artifacts found in it was a still. The New York Historical Society displayed that along with other \"Stork Club\" items and memorabilia in an exhibit in 2000.\n\nBillingsley's hospitality with food, drink, and gifts overcame the structural deficits to keep his patrons returning time after time. He maintained order through a series of hand signals; without saying a word he could order complimentary drinks and gifts for a party at any given table. Billingsley was also able to summon the club's private limousine to whisk favored customers away to a theater date or a ballgame after drinks or dining at the Stork. He changed the meaning of the hand signals frequently to avoid regular patrons' being able to read them. Guests dined on the finest wines and cuisine, and it was known for its Champagne and caviar. The club gained worldwide attention for its cocktails, made by chief barman Nathaniel \"Cookie\" Cook. \nCook invented dozens of cocktails at the bar, including the signature \"Stork Club Cocktail\". Today the ornamental bar of the Stork Club is to be found in Jim Brady's Bar in Maiden Lane. The dining room featured live bands for dancing; the Benny Goodman orchestra were frequent performers. According to a 1960 Services Labor Report, the kitchen and dining room employees working in the Stork Club did \"not enjoy the same wages, hours and working conditions\" as the others, a primary factor which led the majority of them to the strike in January 1957.\n\nBesides the Cub Room, the Main Dining Room, and the bar, the club contained a room for parties, the \"Blessed Event Room\", a large private room on the second floor with its own kitchen and bar, the \"Loner's Room\", which was just past the Cub Room and much like a men's club, and a private barber shop. When the Blessed Event Room was added to the Stork Club, its walls were entirely mirrored. Patrons who had rented the room for poker parties complained that the mirrors allowed players to see everyone's hand of cards; the mirrors were then removed from the walls.\n\nBillingsley's original plan for the Cub Room was for it to be a private place for playing gin rummy with his friends. The room was added to the club during World War II. Billingsley broke out a wall in the bar to create this private space, but it was Walter Winchell who began to call it the Cub Room. The Cub Room had no windows and was described in a Louis Sobol column as a \"lopsided oval\". The room was lit with pink tones. On the wood-paneled walls were paintings of beautiful women; Billingsley also had similar portraits by the same artist in the ladies' powder room. After the club's labor problems began in 1957, Billingsley redecorated the entire club, choosing emerald green for the carpet and chairs, and a pinkish-red for the banquettes. The Cub Room's wood panels were replaced by beige burlap and the portraits of beautiful women were replaced by paintings of noted 19th-century race horses. As a concession to those who wanted to have a business lunch at The Stork, the Cub Room was for men only during lunch time. The \"sanctum sanctorum\", the Cub Room (\"the snub room\"), was guarded by a captain called \"Saint Peter\" (for the saint who guards the gates of Heaven).\n\nThe most famous of the Cub Room's headwaiters was John \"Jack\" Spooner, who was well known to many celebrities from his previous duties at LaHiff's. Billingsley recruited him in 1934 after the death of Billy Lahiff and the subsequent closure of his club. Spooner began an autograph book for his daughter, Amelia, while working at LaHiff's. Billingsley encouraged him to bring \"The Book\" to the Stork Club, where stars continued to sign it. Some who were famous illustrators or cartoonists such as E. C. Segar (\"Popeye\"), Chic Young (\"Blondie\"), and Theodor Geisel (\"Dr. Seuss\") would add personalized doodles or drawings for Spooner's young daughter. Billingsley's rule of thumb for his help, \"If you know them, they don't belong in here,\" did not apply to Spooner. It was Spooner's knowing the patrons and socializing with them away from the job that helped make the Stork Club so successful with attracting celebrity clients. At Christmas, Spooner dressed as Santa Claus, posing for photos with old and young alike.\n\nAuthor T. C. McNult has referred to the Stork Club during its existence as \"the most celebrated nightspot in the world\"; while author Ed McMahon has called it the \"most realistic nightclub of all\", a name \"synonymous with fame, class, and money, in no particular order\". Society writer Lucius Beebe wrote in 1946: \"To millions and millions of people all of over the world the Stork symbolizes and epitomizes the \"de luxe\" upholstery of quintessentially urban existence. It means fame; it means wealth; it means an elegant way of life among celebrated folk\". The club was a prime example of the flourishing cafe society at the time, but the real purpose of the Stork Club, according to journalist Ed Sullivan, was people watching other people, particularly non-celebrities watching celebrities. Author Mearl L. Allen, however, highlights that the club was more than a celebrity playground, and that \"many decisions of tremendous social and economic importance regarding world affairs were made in the Stork Club during this time\", and the likes of Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball could often be seen conversing with executive types. Mark Bernardo, author of \"Mad Men's Manhattan: The Insider's Guide\", has said: \"In some ways, the Stork Club was ahead of its time—courting celebrities by picking up their tabs, hiring a house photographer who sent candid shots of guests to the tabloids, and offering a private enclave called the Cub Room, where stars could huddle away from the prying eyes of fans, all hallmarks of modern clubs that cater to boldface names\". The venue was usually packed with luminaries during its golden years, and dining orders could take a long time to be dealt with.\n\nNotable guests through the years included Lucille Ball, Tallulah Bankhead, Joan Blondell, Charlie Chaplin, Frank Costello, Bing Crosby, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Brenda Frazier, Dorothy Frooks, Carmen Miranda, Dana Andrews, Michael O'Shea, Judy Garland, the Harrimans, Ernest Hemingway, Judy Holliday, J. Edgar Hoover, Grace Kelly, the Kennedys, Dorothy Kilgallen, Dorothy Lamour, Robert M. McBride, Vincent Price, Marilyn Monroe, the Nordstrom Sisters, Erik Rhodes, the Roosevelts, Ramón Rivero, J. D. Salinger, Frank Sinatra, Elizabeth Taylor, Gene Tierney, Mike Todd, and Gloria Vanderbilt.\n\nThe main room of the club was also frequented by many of the prominent figures that had fled Europe, from royals to businessmen, debutantes, sportsmen and military dignitaries, who often, upon departing, took with them the signature ashtrays of the club as souvenirs. The news of Grace Kelly's engagement to Prince Rainier of Monaco broke at the Stork. The couple was at the club on Tuesday, January 3, 1956, as the rumors flew. Veteran columnist Jack O'Brian passed Kelly a note, saying that reliable sources indicated she was about to become engaged to the Prince. Kelly replied she could not answer the question posed by O'Brian until Friday. Socialite Evalyn Walsh McLean, owner of the Hope Diamond, wore the gem as if it was costume jewelry. It disappeared at the Stork Club one night during McLean's visit there. Actress Beatrice Lillie found it under one of the club's tables. Actor Warren Oates once worked at the club as a dishwasher.\n\nGuests were expected to dress to high standards, with men wearing evening suits and the women wearing \"gowns with silk gloves reaching the elbow\". All women in full evening dress received an orchid or gardenia corsage, compliments of the Stork Club. A requirement for all men was a necktie; those who were not wearing one were either lent one or had to buy one to gain admittance. Although African Americans were not explicitly barred from entry, there was a mutual understanding that they were not welcome. Billingsley insisted on orderly conduct for all of his Stork Club guests; fighting, drunkenness, or rowdiness were prohibited. He ran the club on the principle of it being a place where people could have a good time and that it was somewhere he could bring his own family without worrying that they would see or hear something he did not want them to. Billingsley closely controlled the seating placement system in the club. Unescorted women were not allowed to enter the club after 6:00 p.m; this was a protective measure for men who may have been out with someone other than their wives.\n\nSeveral celebrities did not abide by the rules and were banned from the club. Humphrey Bogart was banned after a prolonged \"shouting match\" with Billingsley. Milton Berle was officially barred for too much table-hopping, shouting, and doing handsprings in the club; Berle contended that the real reason was because of a Stork Club satire he had recently performed on his television program. Elliott Roosevelt, the so-called \"black sheep of the club\", became unwelcome at the club through an apparent misunderstanding. Billingsley had planned an engagement party for Roosevelt and his girlfriend, vocalist Gigi Durston, on the basis of the couple's friends' statements that they were going to be married. Durston had once worked at the Stork Club as a singer and Roosevelt was a longtime customer of the club. Billingsley sent out publicity notices about the party; the couple told him that they had no plans to announce their engagement at that time. Roosevelt was banned from the Stork and the party was canceled. Jackie Gleason, who was a frequent guest of the club with his two daughters, was being seated with a female companion when the couple was asked to leave the premises in March 1957. Billingsley claimed that Gleason's conversation became loud and off-color when he arrived at a table and barred Gleason from the Stork Club for life. Gleason said that he had done nothing wrong. He wondered if the problem was because he was a member of the Musicians' Union, since the club's wait and kitchen staff had been on strike since January of that year.\n\nDespite the rules and banishments, there were incidents which made their way into newspapers. Billingsley associate Steve Hannagan believed that one \"good fight\" a year was permissible for a respectable night club. Johnny Weissmuller accused a Navy lieutenant of using a lit cigarette to burn the clothing of dancers as they passed his table. The lieutenant advised Weissmuller to get a haircut; his wife told Weissmuller to go back to Hollywood with the other ape-men. The Navy man suffered two black eyes and complained that Weissmuller's friends held him as he was punched by Weissmuller. Ernest Hemingway once took issue with a stranger who slapped him on the back; knocking him into three chairs and a table as he brushed him away. Billingsley contended that many of the incidents that appeared in print were minor disagreements which were inflated by the press.\n\nJack Benny invited longtime friend, writer, and performer Goodman Ace to lunch with him at the Stork. Ace arrived at the club first and received the \"cold shoulder\" because he was not recognized by the staff. When Benny arrived and asked for Ace, he was told that Ace became tired of waiting and left. Soon Ace began to receive mail from the Stork, which he proceeded to answer in his tongue in cheek style. Ace's response to the message about the club having wonderful air conditioning was that after having received the cold shoulder there, he was well aware of the climate. Bilingsley responded to Ace with a gift of some Stork Club bow ties. Ace then asked for some matching socks so he might be in style to be turned away again. Ace and his wife became regulars at the club after the issue was resolved.\n\nOwner Billingsley was well known for his extravagant gifts presented to his favorite patrons, spending an average of $100,000 a year on them. They included compacts studded with diamonds and rubies, French perfumes, Champagne and liquor, and even automobiles. Many of the gifts were specially made for the Stork Club, with the club's name and logo on them. Some of the best known examples were the gifts of \"Sortilège\" perfume by Le Galion, which became known as the \"fragrance of the Stork Club\". Billingsley convinced Arthur Godfrey, Morton Downey, and his own assistant, Steve Hannigan, to form an investment group with him to obtain the United States distributorship of the fragrance. The partners expanded into the sale of soap, cosmetics and other sundries under the Stork Club name. They called the business Cigogne—the French word for stork; the line was carried by various drug and department stores in the United States. Every female guest of the club received a small vial of perfume and a tube of Stork Club lipstick as souvenirs of her visit. It was also Billingsley's standard practice to send every regular club patron a case of Champagne at Christmas. \n\nSunday night was \"Balloon Night\". As is common with New Year's celebrations, balloons were held on the ceiling of the Main Dining Room by a net and the net would open at the stroke of midnight. As the balloons came down, the ladies would begin frantically trying to catch them. Each contained a number and a drawing would be held for the prizes, which ranged from charms for bracelets to automobiles; there were also at least three $100 bills folded and placed randomly in the balloons.\n\nBillingsley's generosity was not confined to those who were always at the club. He received the following letter in 1955: \"I am grateful to you for your thoughtful kindness in sending me such a generous selection of attractive neckties. At the same time may I once again thank you for the cigars that you regularly send to the White House.\" It was signed by Dwight D. Eisenhower. During World War II, three bomber planes were christened with the name of the Stork Club. Billingsley commissioned Tiffany & Co. to produce sterling silver Stork Club logo Victory pins as gifts for their crew members. Patrons were not always on the receiving end; Billingsley's writings claimed that one of his waiters received a $20,000 tip. A bartender received a new Cadillac from a grateful patron, and a headwaiter received a $10,000 tip from tennis star Fred Perry. It was necessary for Billingsley to give the expensive gifts and to provide some or all of a celebrity's Stork Club services for free to bring the stars to the club and keep them coming back. The notables were what brought people from all over the country in all walks of life to visit the Stork Club. \n\"The Stork Club\" was a television series hosted by Billingsley, who circulated among the tables interviewing guests at the club. Originally sponsored by Fatima cigarettes, the series ran from 1950 to 1955. The show was directed by Yul Brynner, who was a television director before he became a well-known actor. The program began on CBS Television with the network having built a replica of the Cub Room on the Stork Club's sixth floor to serve as the set for the show. Billingsley was paid $12,000 each week as its host, but he was never really comfortable on camera and it was noticeable. The television show moved to ABC by 1955.\nDuring the broadcast of May 8, 1955, Billingsley made some remarks about fellow New York restaurateur Bernard \"Toots\" Shor's financial solvency and honesty. Shor responded by suing for a million dollars. He collected just under $50,000 as a settlement in March 1959. \"The Stork Club\" television show ended in the same year the statements were made.\nA \"Philco Television Playhouse\" presentation, \"Murder at the Stork Club\", was aired on NBC Television on January 15, 1950. Franchot Tone and Billingsley had cameo roles in the television drama. The television show was an adaptation of Vera Caspary's 1946 mystery novel, \"The Murder in the Stork Club\", where the action took place in and around the famous nightclub, with Sherman Billingsley and other real-life characters appearing in the plot.\n\nThe Stork Club was also featured in several movies, including \"The Stork Club\" (1945), \"Executive Suite\" (1954), \"Artists and Models\" (1955), and \"My Favorite Year\" (1982). Billingsley received $100,000 for the use of the club's name in the 1945 film. In \"All About Eve\" (1950), the characters played by Bette Davis, Gary Merrill, Anne Baxter and George Sanders are shown in the Cub Room of the Stork Club. The Alfred Hitchcock film \"The Wrong Man\" (1957) starred Henry Fonda as real-life Stork Club bassist Christopher Emanuel Balestrero (\"Manny\"), who was falsely accused of committing robberies around New York City. Scenes involving Balestrero playing the bass were actually shot at the club. The film's screenplay, written by Maxwell Anderson, was based on a true story originally published in \"Life\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "911372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=911372", "title": "Street theatre", "text": "Street theatre\n\nStreet theatre is a form of theatrical performance and presentation in outdoor public spaces without a specific paying audience. These spaces can be anywhere, including shopping centres, car parks, recreational reserves, college or university campus and street corners. They are especially seen in outdoor spaces where there are large numbers of people. The actors who perform street theatre range from buskers to organised theatre companies or groups that want to experiment with performance spaces, or to promote their mainstream work. It was a source of providing information to people when there were no sources of providing information like television, radio etc. Nowadays, street play is used to convey a message to the crowd watching it. Street play is considered to be the rawest form of acting, because one does not have a microphone or loud speakers.\n\nSometimes performers are commissioned, especially for street festivals, children's shows or parades, but more often street theatre performers are unpaid or gather some income through the dropping of a coin in a hat by the audience.\n\nThe logistics of doing street theatre necessitate simple costumes and props, and often there is little or no amplification of sound, with actors depending on their natural vocal and physical ability. This issue with sound has meant that physical theatre, including dance, mime and slapstick, is a very popular genre in an outdoor setting. The performances need to be highly visible, loud and simple to follow in order to attract a crowd.\n\nStreet theatre should be distinguished from other more formal outdoor theatrical performances, such as performances in a park or garden, where there is a discrete space set aside (or roped off) and a ticketed audience.\n\nIn some cases, street theatre performers have to get a licence or specific permission through local or state governments in order to perform. Many performers travel internationally to certain locations of note.\n\nStreet theatre is arguably the oldest form of theatre in existence: most mainstream entertainment mediums can be traced back to origins in street performing, including religious passion plays and many other forms. More recently performers who, a hundred years ago, would have made their living working in variety theatres, music halls and in vaudeville, now often perform professionally in the many well-known street performance areas throughout the world. Notable performers that began their careers as street theatre performers include Robin Williams, David Bowie, Jewel and Harry Anderson.\n\nStreet theatre allows people who might not have ever been to, or been able to afford to go to, traditional theatre. The audience is made up of anyone and everyone who wants to watch and for most performances is free entertainment.\n\nPerformance artists with an interest in social activism may choose to stage their work on the street as a means of directly confronting or engaging the public. For example, multimedia artist Caeser Pink and his group of performers known as The Imperial Orgy staged a piece titled \"Our Daily Bread\" that brought performers onto the streets of the New York's financial district to ceremoniously lay loaves of Wonder Bread along the sidewalks, each with an advertisement from Satan offering to buy people's souls in exchange for material possessions. The performance caused an uproar when police were called out and bomb-sniffing dogs were brought in to inspect the loaves of bread for explosives.\n\nOther artists consider a paying, theatre-going public to be unrepresentative of the public to whom they are trying to communicate, and performing to 'the man on the street' may be considered a more democratic form of dissemination.\n\nSome contemporary street theatre practitioners have extensively studied pre-existing street and popular theatre traditions, such as Carnival, commedia dell'arte etc. and wish to present them in a situation close to their original context.\n\nWhatever the reason for choosing the street, the street is a place with a different set of possibilities than the conventional theatre space. Sue Gill of Welfare State International argues that a street theatre performance is not a lesser form than an indoor performance, nor is it simply taking what you do on stage and placing it outdoors, but a form with an energy and an integrity of its own.\nMany companies are politically motivated and use street theatre to combine performance with protest. This has occurred through the guerrilla theatre of San Francisco Mime Troupe, The Living Theatre, the carnivalesque parades of Bread and Puppet Theatre, and the work of Ashesh Malla and the Sarwanam Theatre Group of Nepal.\n\nA character-based street theatre which developed in the 1960s and 1970s was developed by groups like Lumiere and Son, John Bull Puncture Repair Kit, Exploded Eye and Natural Theatre Company. The performances were unannounced and featured characters who acted out a pre-arranged scenario, looking beautiful or surreal or simply just involving passers by in conversation. They did not seek to trick in a \"Candid Camera\" way, but rather invited the audience to pretend along with them. No amount of planning or rehearsal could dictate what would happen.\n\nAnother example would be Natural Theatre's Pink Suitcase scenario. A number of smartly dressed people carrying bright pink suitcases enter a set of streets or buildings. They search for and miss their companions. In their search they get on buses, hail cabs, end up in shop windows, etc. By the time they meet up at a pre-arranged spot with the help of passers-by, perceptions of the area have changed and shopping has ceased for at least a few moments. The humour is universal and this piece has been seen in nearly seventy countries. It is usually performed by four or five actors, but has been done with twenty-five.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "55721898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55721898", "title": "Three Dirty Dwarves", "text": "Three Dirty Dwarves\n\nThree Dirty Dwarves is a 1996 beat 'em up video game developed by Appaloosa Interactive and published by Sega for their Sega Saturn console. It was later ported to PC.\n\nEven before its release on the Saturn, SegaSoft announced that \"Three Dirty Dwarves\" would be the first game they would publish for the PlayStation once they acquired a PlayStation software license. However, SegaSoft ended up never publishing any games for the PlayStation.\n\nMost levels in \"Three Dirty Dwarves\" play in a typical beat 'em up format: players must advance the characters to the end of the stage, defeating any enemies which block the way. Up to three players take control of the three titular dwarves, with each player controlling one dwarf at a time; if there are fewer than three players, the player(s) can change which dwarf they are controlling at any time. A single hit from an enemy or obstacle will render a dwarf unconscious, but if another dwarf is still in action he can revive an unconscious dwarf by attacking him, effectively slapping him awake.\n\nEach dwarf has a short-range attack and a long-range attack, though the speed and responsiveness of each attack varies according to the dwarf. In addition, the dwarves can spend skulls to activate special team attacks, such as starting a fight with each other or morphing into one of three huge gestalt dwarves. Skull are acquired by picking them up from fallen enemies or breaking open boxes.\n\nFour children genetically engineered by the army grow up to be child geniuses instead of perfect soldiers, prompting General Briggs to use them to manufacture weaponry.\n\nTo escape, the children play their favorite role-playing game and lead the party - a trio of slow-witted but heroic dwarves - to a gateway into the real world. The dwarves' equipment burns up during atmospheric entry. They land in a sporting goods store and make use of the equipment inside for their weapons and armor. The monsters from the role-playing game world have followed the dwarves into the real world, and the dwarves must battle their way through them to find the children and confront General Briggs.\n\nAfter the dwarves defeat Briggs' subordinate Barney and get past the army bases' automated defenses, Briggs offers them jobs in the army with generous benefits. The dwarves are on the verge of taking the offer, so the children roll the die for their role-playing game until the right number comes up, forcing the dwarves to turn down Briggs' offer and insist on the children's release. Briggs complies, but the dwarves proceed to beat him up anyway. The children use the distraction to sneak off of the base to freedom.\n\nThe Sega Saturn version received moderately positive reviews, with most critics praising the game's humor and personality. The four reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" especially praised the comic weirdness of the cutscenes and the general fun of the game. A \"Next Generation\" critic remarked that the side-scrolling beat 'em up genre was becoming tried, but that \"Three Dirty Dwarves\", while not genuinely innovative, \"offers just enough new spins on the tradition to make it a worthwhile venture.\" He found the varied and often surprising levels and the consistently solid challenge to be key. Major Mike of \"GamePro\" said the jumping and three-dimensional gameplay can be awkward, but aspects such as the three-player mode and humor \"make this game something special.\" Rob Allsetter of \"Sega Saturn Magazine\" gave \"Three Dirty Dwarves\" one of its few negative reviews, calling it \"a very irritating and mundane platform game\". He lambasted the game's humor and said the gameplay is repetitive.\n"}

{"id": "1346178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1346178", "title": "Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation", "text": "Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation\n\nThe Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) is the state-controlled broadcaster in Zimbabwe. It was established as the Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation (RBC), taking its current name in 1980. Like the RBC before it, the ZBC has been accused of being a government mouthpiece with no editorial independence.\n\nRadio was first introduced in the then Southern Rhodesia in 1933, in Belvedere in Salisbury (now Harare) by Imperial Airways, which was used to provide radio guidance and weather reports. However, it was not until 1941 that the first professional broadcaster was established. This was known as the Central African Broadcasting Service (CABS) and had responsibility for broadcasting in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) and Nyasaland (now Malawi) as well as Southern Rhodesia. \n\nFollowing the creation of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1953, a new organisation was established on 1 February 1958, known as the Federal Broadcasting Corporation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (FBC). However, CABS continued to operate as a radio station aimed at African audiences. When the Federation was dissolved in 1963, the FBC was succeeded by a new organisation responsible for broadcasting in Southern Rhodesia, known as the Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation (RBC).\n\nTelevision was introduced on 14 November 1960, first in Salisbury, with transmissions in Bulawayo beginning seven months later. It was only the second such service in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria, and the first such service in southern Africa, as South Africa did not introduce television until 1976. \n\nIt was initially operated by a private company, Rhodesian Television (RTV) on behalf of the then FBC, with its major shareholders being South African companies, including the Argus Group of newspapers, parent company of the \"Rhodesia Herald\", and Davenport and Meyer, the latter of which operated LM Radio, based in Mozambique, then under Portuguese rule. \n\nRTV was taken over by the government, with the RBC initially acquired a 51 per cent stake in the service, which became part of the RBC in 1976. RBC TV was funded by advertising and a television licence fee. Television reception was confined mainly to the large cities, and most viewers were whites. Umtali (now Mutare) only received television in 1972, by which time it was estimated that more than 90 per cent of the white population had access to the service.\n\nIn 1965, the white minority government of Ian Smith issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence, under which censorship of broadcasting and the press was imposed, and key posts at the RBC were gradually filled by supporters of the ruling Rhodesian Front party. The previous year, the Deputy Minister of Information, P. K. van der Byl, described the aims of his Ministry as \"not merely to disseminate information from an interesting point of view but to play its part in fighting the propaganda battle on behalf of the country\". In response, the RBC Director General, James Neill, resigned, citing political interference. \n\nOn 1 January 1965, the RBC had ceased to relay the morning world news bulletin from the BBC, and replaced it with a bulletin from the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). However, afternoon and evening news relays of the BBC remained unchanged. \n\nThe British government, which had denounced UDI as illegal, began broadcasting BBC programmes into Rhodesia by building a radio relay station in Francistown, in the then Bechuanaland Protectorate, now Botswana. The Rhodesian government retaliated by clandestinely building a 400 000 watt transmitter nicknamed \"Big Bertha\", in order to jam the signal from the smaller BBC transmitter. Programmes about Rhodesia were subjected to jamming, but other programmes were not affected. In 1968, the BBC ceased broadcasting from Francistown, and the relay station was transferred to the government of Botswana.\n\nThe RBC operated two main services, the English-language General Service (or National Network), aimed at the white audience, and the African Service, broadcasting in English, Shona and Ndebele, aimed at black listeners. The RBC also established three community stations with a multi-racial audience, Radio Jacaranda (Salisbury), Radio Matopos (Bulawayo) and Radio Manica (Umtali). In 1975, an Ndebele language service operating out of Bulawayo, known as Radio Mthwakazi, was established, using the \"Big Bertha\" transmitter previously used to jam the BBC's broadcasts from Francistown. \nAs armed opposition to white minority rule mounted in the 1970s, Africans in Rhodesia increasingly began to turn to short wave radio broadcasts from neighbouring countries, which carried programmes from exiled nationalist movements, with the Zimbabwe African National Union's Voice of Zimbabwe operating from Mozambique, and the rival Zimbabwe African People's Union's Voice of the Revolution operating from Zambia. \n\nIn order to counter this, the RBC installed an FM network, while the government distributed FM-only receivers to chiefs and village headmen in the Tribal Trust Lands. It also ran campaigns promoting FM-only receivers, pointing out that they were exempt from the annual licence fee, and how short wave broadcasts were affected by static noise and required retuning between frequencies throughout the day.\n\nIn 1979, following the adoption of a new constitution, Rhodesia was renamed Zimbabwe Rhodesia, and in common with other state institutions which were renamed, the state broadcaster was renamed the Zimbabwe Rhodesia Broadcasting Corporation (ZRBC) or the Voice of Zimbabwe Rhodesia (VZR). This also saw the debut of Mandy Mundawarara, the country's first black television newsreader, whose father, Silas Mundawarara, had become Deputy Prime Minister in the government of Abel Muzorewa. \n\nHowever, the Muzorewa government did not gain international recognition, and under the terms of the Lancaster House Agreement, the country officially reverted to British rule as \"Southern Rhodesia\", with Lord Soames as Governor. Despite this, the Corporation's name remained unchanged. \n\nA number of other senior BBC staff were sent to the country to advise Lord Soames on election broadcasting, and also help the ZRBC with their preparations for independence. In the run-up to elections being held in February 1980, the Governor's Information Adviser held discussions with the ZRBC, leading the Election Commissioner agreed to a scheme to ensure that all parties standing in the elections should have equal free time on the public media.\n\nFollowing independence, the state broadcaster became the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC). In a reflection of the news ZANU PF government's political leanings, Robert Mugabe, previously described only as \"a terrorist leader\", was now described as \"Comrade Prime Minister\". In addition, most of the white staff left ZBC after independence, and many of the black staff who replaced them had previously worked in for radio services operated by the nationalist movements from exile in Zambia and Mozambique.\n\nRadio services were reorganised, with three distinct networks being established: Radio One, the main English-language network, run by Africans but with some whites in key positions, Radio Two, combining the Harare and Radio Mthwakazi services and broadcasting in Shona and Ndebele, and Radio Three, replacing Radio Jacaranda. Radio Four was established in 1982, as an educational channel.\n\nThe legacy of economic sanctions meant that ZBC inherited antiquated equipment with spares difficult to obtain, as manufacturers no longer produced black and white television transmission equipment. In addition, the television service, now known as ZTV, only reached only 32 percent of the country's territory. \n\nThe conversion to colour television began in late 1982, using the PAL B system. Colour transmissions were finally introduced in 1984. As much of the machinery had been in used for over two decades, and was now obsolete, it proved more economical to buy entirely new equipment than to replace it. A second television channel, available only in Harare, was introduced in 1986. \n\nAt independence, 30 per cent of television programming was locally produced. By late 1982, local programmes accounted for 40 per cent of output. While some programming was in Shona and Ndebele, 80 per cent of programming was in English, of which most was imported, mainly from the US, Britain and Australia. Despite this reliance on foreign content, in the 1980s, the locally produced drama \"The Mukadota Family\" became the most popular programme in the country.\n\nAs the 1957 Broadcasting Act remained in force, ZBC inherited RBC's state monopoly on broadcasting, remaining accountable to the country's Minister of Information. Expressing his dislike of independent broadcasting in 1995, Robert Mugabe, by now President, remarked \"you do not know what propaganda a non-state radio station might broadcast\". However, the government announced that the ZBC monopoly on broadcasting would be abolished by the end of 1997. \n\nAs a result, the ZBC's second TV channel was discontinued and replaced by Joy TV, the country's first independent channel, which operated on a lease agreement with the ZBC. This channel lasted until 2002, when it was controversially taken off the air for allegedly violating the Broadcasting Services Act.\n\nIn 2015, Freedom House described ZBC coverage as overwhelmingly favouring the ruling ZANU-PF. In 2003, a study conducted by the Media Monitoring Project of Zimbabwe (MMPZ) in 2003 showed that one of the propaganda jingles, \"Rambai Makashinga\" or \"Continue Persevering\", was being played 288 times a day on the four ZBC radio stations, and 72 times a day on ZBC television.\n\nThe ZBC has five radio networks, which are ZBC National FM, broadcasting news and current affairs in English, ZBC Radio Zimbabwe broadcasts programming in Shona and Ndebele, Power FM, broadcasting pop music, Classic 263 (formerly Sport FM) carrying sports news. and the Bulawayo based Khulumani FM, broadcasting is languages that are mainly spoke in the Matabeleland Region.\n\nLocal radio stations run hourly news bulletins which range from two minutes to the longest being a ten-minute bulletin on weekends and holidays. Presenters include, Admire Mhungu, Innocent Manyenga, Memory Chamisa and Keith Mawoyo.\n\nOn the national languages desk readers include Nqobile Malinga, Patience Machokoto, Taboka Ncube, Faith Nare, Lucy Ngosolo and Caroline Sithole. Bulletins come out live on SFM at 7 am, 8 am, 1 pm, 6 pm and 8 pm and running from Monday to Friday. The anchors are Nomalanga Vuma, Theophilus Chuma, Ian Zvoma, Butler Nhepure and Jonathan Marerwa.\n\nZBC's television service now consists of a single channel, known as ZBC TV. The ZBC re-established a second TV channel of its own, Channel 2, in April 2010, but this station was decommissioned in August 2015. \n\nNews bulletins include the morning \"Good Morning Zimbabwe\", produced by Admire Mhungu, lunchtime news, \"Nhau Indaba\" and \"News Hour\". Rumbidzai Takawira, the anchor, is usually the host of \"News Hour\".\n\n\"Battle of the Chefs\" is one of the first food-related reality TV shows to air on ZBC.\n\n\n"}
