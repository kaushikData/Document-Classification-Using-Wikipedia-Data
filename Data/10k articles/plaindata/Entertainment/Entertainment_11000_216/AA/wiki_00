Based on a story by Jack Finney, the film centers on a fictional robbery of what was a real Nevada casino, Harold's Club. The supporting cast includes William Conrad. The screenplay was based on Jack Finney's 1954 novel of the same name, which was later serialized by \"Good Housekeeping\" magazine.\n\nDuring a weekend side-trip to Reno, Nevada, college friends Brick (Keith), Al (Madison), Ronnie (Kerwin Mathews) and Roy (Alvy Moore) visit the Harold's Club casino.\n\nAfter an hour spent gambling and socializing, the group prepares to leave. Ronnie, however, has lost money playing roulette and must cash a check at the cashier's window. He is accompanied there by Roy but, unbeknownst to either of them, the cashier is being threatened by a man with a gun. Using a concealed security alarm, the cashier alerts casino officials, who apprehend not only the would-be robber, but also Roy and Ronnie. Al persuades the police to release Roy and Ronnie, but the inquisitive Ronnie has become obsessed with the idea of a spectacular casino robbery, and he begins forming his own plans to rob Harold's Club after he overhears one of the police officers say, \"There's no way it [robbing Harold's Club] can be done.\"\n\nBack at college, the incident is seemingly forgotten, though Ronnie begins developing his plans in earnest. Al also reestablishes his relationship with his girlfriend, Kaye (Kim Novak), who has recently become a singer at a local nightclub. Al takes Brick, Roy and Ronnie to see one of her shows. After the performance, Brick, a Korean War veteran, is provoked into fighting a fellow student over a former girlfriend and, afterward, he suffers from the effects of a dissociative psychotic episode due to an ongoing battle with posttraumatic stress disorder. Later that night, Al encourages a distraught Brick to return to a veteran’s hospital for treatment, but he refuses.\n\nLater, Ronnie finalizes his plan to rob Harold’s Club. Claiming that the robbery would be an adventurous \"first\" in their otherwise ordinary lives, Ronnie reveals the plan to Brick and Roy, maintaining that all the money would be returned, thereby ensuring that no one involved would be guilty of a prosecutable crime. Though initially skeptical, Brick and Roy gradually abandon their misgivings. The wealthy Ronnie then uses his personal inheritance funds to purchase an untraceable trailer and car and fabricate a wooden cart that is identical to the cash carts used at Harold's — the most important component of the heist.\n\nRonnie determines that the robbery can only go ahead if Al participates, maintaining that at least four people will be needed for the dangerously complex operation. But Brick, Roy and Ronnie agree that Al will not go along with the robbery if he is made aware of it beforehand. Coincidentally, the day before the robbery, Al proposes to Kaye, and they decide to go to Reno with the others to get married right away.\n\nOn the way to Reno, Al recognizes the cart's design while riding in the trailer and inadvertently turns on a small reel-to-reel recorder hidden inside the cart itself and listens to a sinister recording. Ronnie reveals his robbery plans to Kaye and Al. Shocked, they refuse to participate.\n\nBrick then pulls out a revolver and seizes control. Fearing a life of destitution and confinement, the increasingly volatile and disturbed Brick explains that the robbery will go ahead as intended, but with one difference: the money will not be returned. Brick threatens to kill Al if anyone attempts to sabotage the plan.\n\nOnce they arrive at the casino, the robbery is carried out efficiently as Reno’s casino district is filled with costumed partiers celebrating a cowboy-themed fête. In the chaotic festivities, the disguised Brick, Ronnie and Al blend into the crowd and convince a cart operator (William Conrad) to retrieve cash from the money room, using the prerecorded message to make him believe that there is a desperate man with a gun in the cart who will shoot him if he does not cooperate.\n\nAfter the robbery, Brick leaves the others behind and escapes with the money, but Al pursues him into a casino parking structure. Kaye, having alerted police, follows them, and a tense standoff ensues. Ultimately, Al convinces Brick to give up peacefully. No one else is arrested and Al and Kaye embrace on a crowded street.\n\n\nAdditionally, though not her film debut, this was one of Novak's first screen appearances. She was one of the last actors to be signed to a studio contract and to be recruited through the \"old studio system\" by producer Harry Cohn.\n\nThe film was praised upon its release by A. H. Weiler, the film critic at \"The New York Times\", who cited, \"brisk direction, crisp, idiomatic and truly comic dialogue\" as being chief among its positive qualities, but held reservations about the film's development of characters and back-story. Contemporary reviewer Richard Harland Smith has reported that Kim Novak received \"favorable, albeit condescending reviews\" for her portrayal of \"night-club chanteuse\" Kaye Greylek, which improved her status at Columbia Pictures.\n\nReleased in 1955, \"5 Against the House\" is an early example of a filmed heist, and an early film depiction of casino-robbery, to be later typified by, among others, \"Ocean's 11\", its remake and sequels. Martin Scorsese has indicated that his 1995 film \"Casino\" was influenced by Karlson's own production.\n\nOn November 3, 2009, Sony Pictures released the film on standard-definition DVD as a part of their collection Film Noir Classics, Volume I with other early noir films \"The Big Heat\", \"The Lineup\", \"Murder by Contract\", and \"The Sniper\". The DVD includes film introductions and commentaries by notable filmmakers Martin Scorsese, Michael Mann, Christopher Nolan and authors Eddie Muller and James Ellroy.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1601816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1601816", "title": "African popular music", "text": "African popular music\n\nAfrican popular music, like African traditional music, is vast and varied. Most contemporary genres of African popular music build on cross-pollination with western popular music. Many genres of popular music like blues, jazz, salsa, zouk, and rumba derive to varying degrees on musical traditions from Africa, taken to the Americas by enslaved Africans. These rhythms and sounds have subsequently been adapted by newer genres like rock, and rhythm and blues. Likewise, African popular music has adopted elements, particularly the musical instruments and recording studio techniques of western music. The term \"afropop\" (also styled afro-pop or afro pop) is sometimes used to refer to contemporary African pop music. The term does not refer to a specific style or sound, but is used as a general term for African popular music.\n\nCuban music has been popular in sub-Saharan Africa since the mid twentieth century. It was Cuban music that more than any other, that provided the initial template for Afropop. To the Africans, clave-based Cuban popular music sounded both familiar and exotic. \"The Encyclopedia of Africa v. 1\". states:\n\n\"Beginning in the 1940s, Afro-Cuban [son] groups such as Septeto Habanero and Trio Matamoros gained widespread popularity in the Congo region as a result of airplay over Radio Congo Belge, a powerful radio station based in Léopoldville (now Kinshasa DRC). A proliferation of music clubs, recording studios, and concert appearances of Cuban bands in Léopoldville spurred on the Cuban music trend during the late 1940s and 1950s.\"\n\nCongolese bands started doing Cuban covers and singing the lyrics phonetically. Soon, they were creating their own original Cuban-like compositions, with French lyrics. The Congolese called this new music \"rumba\", although it was really based on the son. The Africans adapted guajeos to electric guitars, and gave them their own regional flavor. The guitar-based music gradually spread out from the Congo, increasingly taking on local sensibilities. This process eventually resulted in the establishment of several different distinct regional genres, such as soukous.\n\nCuban popular music played a major role in the development of many contemporary genres of African popular music. John Storm Roberts states: \"It was the Cuban connection, but increasingly also New York salsa, that provided the major and enduring influences—the ones that went deeper than earlier imitation or passing fashion. The Cuban connection began very early and was to last at least twenty years, being gradually absorbed and re-Africanized.\" The re-working of Afro-Cuban rhythmic patterns by Africans brings the rhythms full circle.\n\nThe re-working of the harmonic patterns reveals a striking difference in perception. The I IV V IV harmonic progression, so common in Cuban music, is heard in pop music all across the African continent, thanks to the influence of Cuban music. Those chords move in accordance with the basic tenets of Western music theory. However, as Gerhard Kubik points out, performers of African popular music do not necessarily perceive these progressions in the same way: \"The harmonic cycle of C-F-G-F [I-IV-V-IV] prominent in Congo/Zaire popular music simply cannot be defined as a progression from tonic to subdominant to dominant and back to subdominant (on which it ends) because in the performer's appreciation they are of equal status, and not in any hierarchical order as in Western music.\"\n\nThe largest wave of Cuban-based music to hit Africa was in the form of salsa. In 1974 the Fania All Stars performed in Zaire (known today as the Democratic Republic of the Congo), Africa, at the 80,000-seat Stadu du Hai in Kinshasa. This was captured on film and released as \"Live In Africa\" (\"Salsa Madness\" in the UK). The Zairean appearance occurred at a music festival held in conjunction with the Muhammad Ali/George Foreman heavyweight title fight. Local genres were already well established by this time. Even so, salsa caught on in many African countries, especially in the Senegambia and Mali. Cuban music had been the favorite of Senegal's nightspot in the 1950s to 1960s. The Senegalese band Orchestra Baobab plays in a basic salsa style with congas and timbales, but with the addition of Wolof and Mandinka instruments and lyrics.\n\nAccording to Lise Waxer: \"African salsa points not so much to a return of salsa to African soil (Steward 1999: 157) but to a complex process of cultural appropriation between two regions of the so-called Third World.\" Since the mid-1990s African artists have also been very active through the super-group Africando, where African and New York musicians mix with leading African singers such as Bambino Diabate, Ricardo Lemvo, Ismael Lo and Salif Keita. It is still common today for an African artist to record a salsa tune, and add their own particular regional touch to it.\n\nGenres of African popular music include:\n\n\n"}

In 1999, Omes and Russell Faibisch, his then-business partner, co-founded the Ultra Music Festival, an outdoor electronic music festival held annually in Miami, Florida. Since its founding, Ultra Music Festival has grown into one of the country's and the world's largest electronic dance music festivals. An estimated 400,000 people attended Ultra Music Festival over the course of two weekends in 2013, the highest number of attendees to date.\n\nOmes was born and raised in Argentina. He moved to Miami Beach, Florida, when he was 9 years old with his mother and brother, Carlos Omes. Alex Omes graduated from Miami Beach Senior High School. \n\nHe began his career within Miami's club and electronic music scenes as a bouncer at the Cameo nightclub in Miami Beach during the 1990s. He then became a publisher of an electronic and dance music magazine called \"D'VOX\", which focused on Miami's emerging electronic dance music industry during the 1990s. Omes acquired professional contacts within the city's music and DJ culture while working at \"D'VOX\" and the nightclubs.\n\nOne of Omes's contacts within the music industry was Russell Faibisch, with whom he conceived the idea for a beachfront music festival that would become Ultra. The two met at an event. In a 2013 interview with Miami New Times, Faibisch recalled, \"I was doing an event and had to place some ads...That's when I met Alex Omes, who had the vision. We started Ultra together.\" Omes and Faibisch, who had similar interests in club music, soon became close friends and, later, business partners. Together, they brainstormed the idea for a beachfront music festival to be held alongside the annual Winter Music Conference (WMC). Thousands of attendees and electronic music fans had attended WMC annually since its creation in 1985. The two business partners saw potential for a dance music event during the same week as WMC. \n\nFaibisch and Omes organized the first Ultra Music Festival on March 13, 1999, in Collins Park in Miami Beach's South Beach neighborhood. Artists performing at the first Ultra's main stage included Paul van Dyk, DJ Baby Anne and Josh Wink. The 1999 Ultra festival proved popular, with 10,000 concertgoers in attendance, though Omes and Faibisch still saw a financial loss of between $10,000 and $20,000 on the project during its first year. \n\nUltra Music Festival was held as a one-day event from 1999 until 2006. It was expanded into a two-day festival from 2007 to 2010, eventually reaching across two consecutive weekends in 2013. Ultra Music Festival reverted to a three-day concert in 2014. The event has featured some of the world's top electronic and dance DJs and artists, including Avicii, DJ Eddie G, Deadmau5, Tiësto, Paul van Dyk, and Madonna.\n\nOmes was pushed out of Ultra on August 10, 2010 after Ultra Music Festival officials ended its decade-long association with the Winter Music Conference. Omes charged that he had been forced out of Ultra following a \"secret shareholders' meeting\" in a lawsuit filed in 2012. \n\nAlex Omes soon partnered with another Miami nightlife promoter, Emi Guerra. Together, Omes and Guerra co-founded Go Big Productions, an event company, to stage concerts and other major events in Miami. In 2011 and 2012, Go Big Productions held concerts featuring Swedish House Mafia on the same weekends as the Ultra Music Festival. Go Big also planned a new two-day, multistage concert, called the UR1 music festival, which was scheduled to be held in downtown Miami in 2012, coinciding with Art Basel. However, UR1, which would have featured Kanye West and Lou Reed as headliners, was cancelled due to lower than expected ticket sales.\n\nIn August 2012, Omes filed a $33 million lawsuit against Faibisch and two other Ultra Music Festival executives, Charlie Faibisch and Adam Russakoff, alleging that they had conspired to oust him from \"the now financially successful event\" (Ultra) following a \"secret shareholders' meeting. The lawsuit alleged that the three knew that Omes would never agree to break off an existing affiliation with the Winter Music Conference.\n\nA two-week trial for the lawsuit began on Tuesday, January 13, 2015, in Miami. However, Alex Omes never arrived for that day's court proceedings. Omes's brother, Carlos, and his attorney, Aaron Resnick, became concerned when Omes didn't show up for the opening arguments on Tuesday morning. They discovered Alex Omes dead at his home at the age of 43. Omes had died on Monday night, January 12, 2015, according to a report from the Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner. His cause of death was released by the medical examiner on March 9, 2016, saying that Omes had amphetamines, ketamine, cocaine and GHB in his system when he died and cocaine was found in his apartment. Omes was survived by his son, Joshua Omes, and former wife, Karie Omes. His funeral was held at St. Patrick Catholic Church in Miami Beach on January 23, 2015.\n"}

The name is derived from a Common Kartvelian root \"ber\" (ბერ), meaning \"a child\". The scenes of Berikaoba range from those of explicitly erotic nature to political satire and social protest. \n\nBerikaoba typically involves several men, the berika, who are mostly disguised as animals. The costumes and masks for the mystery are made of animal hide. Animal skulls, tails, feathers, horns, pumpkins, ribbons and bells are used to add colorfulness to the scene. The festivity begins with a gathering of villagers who chose actors for the mystery. The procession of berikas – accompanied by sounds of bagpipes (stviri) – move door-to-door to pick wine, honey, floor, meat and other victuals served by hosts. The main characters in the procession are a \"bride\" called Kekela (კეკელა) and a groom who, after a series of attempts, persuades Kekela to marry her. The wedding is then disrupted by an appearance of a \"Tatar\", a reference to the centuries of invasions from neighboring Muslim powers. The groom is killed and the people console Kekela, promising her a better husband. As berikas try to resuscitate the groom with help of healing water, herbs and minerals, the news spreads about the abduction of Kekela. This brings the groom back to life. He chases the kidnappers and relieves her bride. The performance finishes with a lengthy feast, \"supra\". \n\nThe similar tradition, \"keenoba\" (ყეენობა, from \"the Khan\"), satirizing the foreign invaders of Georgia and later the Imperial Russian officialdom, enjoyed particular popularity in the 19th-century Tbilisi and its environs. The tradition of berikaoba was inscribed on the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Georgia list in 2013.\n"}
{"id": "10288711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10288711", "title": "Big Apple Comic Con", "text": "Big Apple Comic Con\n\nThe Big Apple Comic Con is a New York City comic book convention, the longest-running comic book/speculative fiction/pop culture convention in New York City. It was started by retailer Michael \"Mike Carbo\" Carbonaro in March 1996 in the basement of the St. Paul the Apostle Church. A location that a competing show promotor Sunrise Productions Scooty O'Donnell and Partner Richard Ritz Whom Held The New York Horror-Fi Con there on October 4, 1997. During its heyday from 2001–2008, the Big Apple Comic Con often featured multiple shows per year, with a large three-day \"national\" convention held in November, usually held at the Penn Plaza Pavilion. The show was owned by Wizard Entertainment from 2009 to 2013, but is now back in the hands of Carbonaro.\n\nOver the course of its history, the convention has been known as the Big Apple Convention, the Big Apple Comic Book Art, and Toy Show, and the Big Apple Comic Book, Art, Toy & Sci-Fi Expo; with the November shows known as the National Comic Book, Art, Toy, and Sci-Fi Expo, the National Comic Book, Art, and Sci-Fi Expo, and the National Comic Book, Comic Art, and Fantasy Convention. In 2014, the name \"Big Apple Convention\" was revived by Carbonaro for a show scheduled for March 7, 2015. The Big Apple Comic Convention has continued yearly since then, the latest show April 14-15, 2018.\n\nThough it primarily focuses on comic books, the convention features a large range of pop culture elements, such as books, cinema, science fiction/fantasy, television, animation, anime, manga, toys, horror, collectible card games, video games, webcomics, and fantasy novels. Along with panels, seminars, and workshops with comic book professionals, the Big Apple Comic Con often features previews of upcoming films, and such evening events as the costume contest overseen by \"Captain Zorikh\" Zorikh Lequidre. \n\nThe convention regularly hosts hundreds of artists, exhibitors and film and television personalities in a huge floorspace for exhibitors. The show includes an autograph and photo op opportunities with all of the guests, as well as the Artists' Alley where comics artists can sign autographs and sell or do free sketches.\n\nIn 2009, Michael Carbonaro established his own independent one-day convention known as the New York Comic Book Marketplace which ran annually through 2014.\n\nMajor comic book conventions in New York City prior to the Big Apple Comic Con included Dave Kaler's Academy Con, which ran annually from 1965–1967; Phil Seuling's Comic Art Convention, which ran annually from 1968–1983 (Seuling died in 1984); and the large annual Creation conventions, usually taking place over the weekend following Thanksgiving from 1971–1987. (Creation sometimes put on as many as a half-dozen smaller New York City shows per year). From 1993-1995, promoter Frederic Greenberg began hosting Great Eastern Conventions shows annually at venues including the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. (Great Eastern also ran shows in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts.) Other companies, including Dynamic Forces, held New York City conventions, but all were on a smaller scale than the Seuling shows. Changes in the industry, popular culture, and the resurgent city itself since the troubled 1960s and '70s made large-scale comic-book conventions difficult to hold profitably. Jonah Weiland of ComicBookResources.com also noted that \"... dealing with the various convention unions made it difficult for most groups to get a show off the ground.\"\n\nOn February 29, 1996, Greenberg cancelled what had been advertised as a larger-than-usual Great Eastern show, scheduled for March 2–3 at the New York Coliseum, which the fan press had suggested might herald a successor to the Comic Art Convention. As a substitute event, comic book retailers Carbonaro and Vincent Zurzuolo on the spur of the moment mounted the first Big Apple Convention (dubbed \"Hallelujah Con\" or \"The Show Must Go On\" Con) in the basement of the Church of St. Paul the Apostle. Their show attracted over 4,000 attendees, most of whom had been planning to attend the scheduled Great Eastern Show.\n\nAfter the success of the initial 1996 show, Big Apple scheduled six separate conventions for 1997.\n\nIn 1998, Big Apple held two conventions, a two-day September show and a one-day affair in October. In 1999 there was a March show and the three-day \"National\" show held in November; 2000 followed the same pattern. (The National show had by this time moved to the Metropolitan Pavilion; other shows continued to be held at St. Paul's Church.) Over the years, these small shows attracted many comics creators and pop-culture figures, and by 2000 the convention had moved to the Metropolitan Pavilion on West 18th Street in Manhattan.\n\n2001 was a big year for Big Apple, with five conventions spread throughout the year. In 2002 four shows were held, and in 2003 Big Apple put on six separate conventions. In 2003, \"Captain Zorikh\" Lequidre began running the costume contest, which became well known for its audience-participation judging. \n\nBy 2004 (which saw four separate shows), the convention had moved to the Penn Plaza Pavilion at the Hotel Pennsylvania. At this point, show organizers claimed to have attracted over 30,000 attendees throughout the year.\n\nIn 2005, Big Apple put on five shows, repeating that pattern in 2006. (From 2006–2009, the June shows were given the moniker \"Summer Sizzler.\") 2007 saw three shows; Captain Zorikh, who had previously been managing Internet promotions and other aspects of the convention (including the costume contest), was named general manager of the convention; he acted in this role through the 2008 shows. \n\nBy 2008, the frequency of Big Apple Conventions was slowing down, with just two shows, a Summer Sizzler and the usual three-day November National convention. The last show before Wizard's purchase of Big Apple was a June Summer Sizzler; 2009 was also the final year there were multiple Big Apple Conventions held. \n\nIn 2009, the Big Apple Comic Con was purchased by Wizard Entertainment; Michael Carbonaro was retained as a senior adviser. The first show under Wizard was held October 2009 at Pier 94 in Manhattan. At this point the new manager, Spat Oktan, who had hosted costume contests at other conventions, took over the costume contest and Captain Zorikh was put in charge of the children's costume contest, while continuing in other capacities.\n\nBy 2011, Reed Exhibitions' New York Comic Con, held annually at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, had become the dominant New York City-area comic convention, and was taking away from the appeal of the Big Apple Comic Con. Wizard sat out 2012 and held a new \"Wizard World New York City Experience\" show on June 28–30, 2013.\n\nThough not branded as a \"Big Apple Convention\" and not affiliated with Wizard World, some might consider the next iteration of the Big Apple Comic Con to have been held on March 31, 2012, at the Penn Plaza Pavilion. It was Michael Carbonaro's third New York Comic Book Marketplace, and announced as Carbonaro's final convention. The guest of honor was Stan Lee; other guests included George Pérez, Joe Sinnott, Dick Ayers, Carmine Infantino, Jim Steranko, Irwin Hasen, Mike Royer, Arthur Suydam, Bob McLeod, Rich Buckler, and Johnny Brennan, and Captain Zorikh's costume contest\n\nCarbonaro held another NYCBM at the Hotel Pennsylvania on April 13, 2013.\n\nThe 2014 NYCBM was held at the Hotel New Yorker on March 1, and featured extensive zombie programming, including the premier screening of \"Zombie Hunters: City of the Dead\" Episode 10.\n\nMichael Carbonaro regained the Big Apple Comic Con brand in 2014 and held the \"20th Anniversary Return of the Big Apple Convention\" on March 7, 2015, moving the show to a larger and more accessible space Penn Plaza Pavilion. He completely revamped and expanded the show with new management and a commitment to creating a non-corporate comic book convention that reflects the diversity and interests of the New York Community. \n\nComics creator Evan Dorkin was a critic of the Big Apple Con. He singled out the November 2008 show in particular as \"the worst convention I've ever had the displeasure to sit through\", for the lackluster celebrity guests, the lack of floor plan guides for attendees, inconsistently-functioning restrooms, elevator and escalators, the poorly performing volunteer staff, and an overall seedy, flea market atmosphere of rude dealers, creators inattentive to fans, and attendees who were disproportionately male. Dorkin, who vowed never to return to the venue, also singled out the cramped space of the venue, in particular Artist's Alley, which he speculated may have constituted a fire hazard.\n\n\n"}

Developed by Blizzard and NetEase, the game was announced in late 2018 and is planned for release on Android and iOS with no set release date.\n\n\"Diablo Immortal\" is a massively multiplayer online action game in the \"Diablo\" series designed for play on mobile devices. The fast-paced \"Immortal\" is set between the events of \"Diablo 2\" and \"Diablo 3\", and borrows the look and feel of the latter. \n\nThe game is designed for a touchscreen, with virtual controls that overlay the display: a directional thumbstick and ability buttons. The player can aim the ability by holding its button. Each of the six character classes—Barbarian, Wizard, Monk, Necromancer, Demon Hunter, and Crusader—have four abilities, which differ across character classes. For example, the Barbarian's class abilities include a slamming hammer and turning into a whirlwind. The Wizard casts a beam of electricity that boomerangs back to its source, dealing damage twice. Skills generally aim towards the nearest enemy. Blizzard plans for each class to have 12 unlockable skills, from which the player choose five to use concurrently.\n\nDefeated enemies drop items (\"loot\") that can be equipped via a pop-up button. Players can join and leave groups that play through \"dynamic events\". Unlike other \"Diablo\" series games, in the \"Immortal\" preview, the mana resource is removed and newly equipped items do not change the visual appearance of the player's character.\n\n\"Immortal\" is co-developed by Blizzard and NetEase. The latter developer had been Blizzard's partner for Chinese market releases. Blizzard intended to bring the core \"Diablo\" experience to the smartphone platform. As a result, its interfaces reflect choices that would make that experience best fit the medium. By designing for a smartphone gaming audience, \"Immortal\" was designed to reach demographics and geographic regions that use mobile phones as their main gaming platform and may not otherwise interact with \"Diablo\" on other gaming platforms.\n\nThe game is planned for release on Android and iOS platforms. No release date is set. Players can pre-register on the game's website for admission to playtest the beta. Blizzard also announced plans to keep the \"Immortal\" experience fresh after its initial release with the regular addition of stories and characters. The game was announced at the opening ceremony of BlizzCon in November 2018.\n\nThe announcement's response was largely negative. While traditional gaming audiences often express skepticism towards diluted mobile versions of a cherished franchise, the \"Diablo\" series community's discontent was compounded by their anticipation for a larger announcement. They expressed their discontent through online channels, likening \"Immortal\" to a reskin of one of NetEase's prior games, \"Crusaders of Light\". Blizzard responded that \"Immortal\" is but one \"Diablo\" series game in active development, and pointed to the company's multi-platform development experience and the success of the mobile version of \"Hearthstone\" as evidence of Blizzard's capacity to overcome uncertainty and do right by their core audience. Blizzard also debunked a rumor that they had withheld announcement of a main \"Diablo\" sequel due to the negative response at \"Immortal\"s reveal; Blizzard stated \"we didn’t pull any announcements from BlizzCon this year or have plans for other announcements. We do continue to have different teams working on multiple unannounced Diablo projects, and we look forward to announcing when the time is right.\".\n\nAfter the reveal at BlizzCon, developers participated in a Q&A with attendees. Two particular questions leveled at Wyatt Cheng, Principal Game Designer at Blizzard, drew significant attention from media and audiences alike, with one attendee asking if the announcement was an \"out of season April Fools' joke\", and another if it there was a possibility for a PC release, leading to the crowd booing when the answer was negative.\n\nFollowing the announcent, Activision Blizzard's stock fell 7% on the first weekday of trading.\n\nPreviews of the game's demo approved of the game's controls, its interface having been tested by prior NetEase games, though \"Polygon\" reviewer noted difficulties in precision controls. The locked abilities made some character classes less enjoyable to play, as the Wizard's ability cooldown timers made the class less effective in groups.\n\nDemo reviewers felt that where \"Immortal\" captured the series' look and feel, it omitted some of its core tenets, or as \"Polygon\" put it, \"Diablo\" \"soul\". Whereas the mobile game captured the basic Diablo experience, the reviewers questioned whether the new entry had enough new content to remain fresh.\n\n"}

It has maintained a worldwide membership of about 700,000 since January 2013.\n\nIn 1927, an offshoot of the Boone and Crockett Club was created specifically for sport bird management and operated until 1930 as the American Wild Fowlers. Membership included such people as Arthur Bartley and Nash Buckingham, who would later be very instrumental in the conservation movement. In 1930, Joseph P. Knapp, a publishing tycoon who successfully obtained such notable publications as \"The Associated Sunday Magazine\", Crowell Publishing Company, \"Collier’s Weekly\", \"Farm and Fireside\" and the book publisher P.F. Collier & Sons, founded More Game Birds in America and American Wild Fowlers was quickly absorbed into the new organization.\n\nIn 1937, Knapp, Robert Winthrop, and a small group of conservation philanthropists decided to focus on the decreasing waterfowl populations, and the habitat necessary to sustain them in Canada, and formed Ducks Unlimited Inc. As had happened before, More Game Birds in America was absorbed by the new waterfowl organization.\n\nDucks Unlimited Canada was incorporated in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, on March 10, 1937. Ducks Unlimited also works in Mexico through their sister organization, Ducks Unlimited de Mexico. Other chapters have since begun operation in Latin America, Mexico, New Zealand, and Australia.\n\nDU has conserved at least 12.5 million acres — perhaps more than 13.8 million acres — of waterfowl habitat in North America. DU partners with a wide range of corporations, governments, other non-governmental organizations, landowners, and private citizens to restore and manage areas that have been degraded and to prevent further degradation of existing wetlands. DU is also active in working with others to recommend government policies that will positively influence wetlands and the environment. DU generated more than $235 million in revenues during their 2012 fiscal year, of which a minimum of 80 percent goes directly toward habitat conservation. Their sources of revenue include federal and state habitat reimbursements, conservation easements, sponsors and members, major gifts and donations and royalties/advertisement. Through its conservation activities, DU benefits biodiversity, water quality, the environment and the economy in the areas in which it is active. The Ducks Unlimited logo was commissioned and then created by Winnipeg artist Ernie Wilson.\n\nJanuary 29, 2017, marked Ducks Unlimited’s 80th anniversary. ConocoPhillips, a multinational energy corporation headquartered in Houston, received the inaugural Ducks Unlimited Corporate Conservation Achievement Award at DU’s 80th annual convention in San Antonio, celebrating the organizations 80th anniversary. \n\nIn keeping with Ducks Unlimited's founders' intentions, the organization promotes the continuation of safe and regulated waterfowl hunting. The majority of DU's financial contributors and 90 percent of members are hunters. Its \"DU Magazine\" contains many historical and practical articles on waterfowl hunting, and it obtains revenue from advertisements of waterfowling equipment such as shotguns, ammunition, decoys, and bird calls.\n\nAccording to Ducks Unlimited 2017 Annual Report, 2017 marked the seventh consecutive year that the budget goals were surpassed, with total revenues approaching $224 million. Over 58,000 DU volunteers organized 4,050 events which attracted over 577,000 attendees. The $86 million of philanthropic revenue generated in 2017 surpassed that which was raised in 2016 by over $1.8 million from contributions by 5,000 donors and 700,000 members.\n\nDucks Unlimited included a list of new goals for 2018 in their annual report. In the upcoming year, the organization intends to:\n\n\nTraditionally, most DU wetland conservation projects were conducted on waterfowl breeding areas in the Canadian prairies by its sister organization, Ducks Unlimited Canada (DUC). DUC has however expanded its operations to include projects in every Canadian province and territory, not just in the prairies. DU has also expanded its operations to include conservation projects in every state of the United States and in Mexico. It retains primary focus on habitats most important to waterfowl; including the restoration of duck breeding habitat in Canada and the northern central states, and also duck overwintering habitat, mostly in the coastal and southern states and in Mexico.\n\nDucks Unlimited places strong emphasis on science and research. It works closely with biologists and ecologists to evaluate habitat needs and to monitor how birds respond to various environmental changes. Some of the methods used by Ducks Unlimited to conserve habitats are:\n\n\nDucks Unlimited also works closely with government leaders, conservation leaders, private landowners and farmers to ensure that environmental provisions are contained in the Farm Bill. The Farm Bill supports programs such as the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP).\n\nDucks Unlimited takes a continental, landscape approach to wetland conservation. While DU works in all 50 states, the organization focuses its efforts and resources on the habitats most beneficial to waterfowl and in greatest jeopardy of disappearing. The following areas are considered to be DU's top 5 conservation priorities:\n\n\nDucks Unlimited produces a television show, \"Ducks Unlimited TV\" a.k.a. \"DUTV\". This show is hosted by Field Hudnall, Wade Bourne and Ainsley Beeman and highlights conservation and waterfowl hunting from across the United States.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9004984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9004984", "title": "Economic Justice", "text": "Economic Justice\n\nJustice in economics is a subcategory of welfare economics with models frequently representing the ethical-social requirements of a given theory, whether \"in the large\", as of a just social order, or \"in the small\", as in the equity of \"how institutions distribute specific benefits and burdens\". That theory may or may not elicit acceptance. In the Journal of Economic Literature classification codes 'justice' is scrolled to at , wedged on the same line between 'Equity' and 'Inequality' along with 'Other Normative Criteria and Measurement'. Categories above and below the line are Externalities and Altruism.\n\nSome ideas about justice and ethics overlap with the origins of economic thought, often as to distributive justice and sometimes as to Marxian analysis. The subject is a topic of normative economics and philosophy and economics. In early welfare economics, where mentioned, 'justice' was little distinguished from maximization of all individual utility functions or a social welfare function. As to the latter, Paul Samuelson (1947), expanding on work of Abram Bergson, represents a social welfare function in general terms as any ethical belief system required to order any (hypothetically feasible) social states for the entire society as \"better than\", \"worse than\", or \"indifferent to\" each other. Kenneth Arrow (1963) showed a difficulty of trying to extend a social welfare function consistently across different hypothetical ordinal utility functions even apart from justice. Utility maximization survives, even with the rise of ordinal-utility/Pareto theory, as an ethical basis for economic-policy judgments in the wealth-maximization criterion invoked in law and economics. \n\nAmartya Sen (1970), Kenneth Arrow (1983), Serge-Christophe Kolm (1969, 1996, 2000), and others have considered ways in which utilitarianism as an approach to justice is constrained or challenged by independent claims of equality in the distribution of primary goods, liberty, entitlements, opportunity, exclusion of antisocial preferences, possible capabilities, and fairness as non-envy plus Pareto efficiency. Alternate approaches have treated combining concern for the worst off with economic efficiency, the notion of personal responsibility and (de)merits of leveling individual benefits downward, claims of intergenerational justice, and other non-welfarist/Pareto approaches. Justice is a subarea of social choice theory, for example as to extended sympathy, and more generally in the work of Arrow, Sen, and others. \n\nA broad reinterpretation of justice from the perspective of game theory, social contract theory, and evolutionary naturalism is found in works of Ken Binmore (1994, 1998, 2004) and others. Arguments on fairness as an aspect of justice have been invoked to explain a wide range of behavioral and theoretical applications,supplementing earlier emphasis on economic efficiency (Konow, 2003).\n"}
{"id": "1056228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1056228", "title": "Fahrenheit 9/11 controversies", "text": "Fahrenheit 9/11 controversies\n\nThe content of the 2004 documentary film \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" generated controversy before, during, and after its release a few months prior to the 2004 U.S. presidential election. The film, directed by Michael Moore, criticizes the Bush administration's attempt to pursue Osama bin Laden in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks, as well as the Iraq War. Although \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" was generally praised by film critics and won various awards, Bush defenders and several other commentators criticized the film for inconsistencies, lack of context and for being made available online for free download.\n\nThe title of the film refers to Ray Bradbury's novel \"Fahrenheit 451\" and the September 11 attacks of 2001. The \"Fahrenheit 451\" reference is emphasized by the film's tagline \"\"The temperature where freedom burns\" (compare with \"Fahrenheit 451's\" tagline, \"The temperature at which books burn\"\"). Moore has stated that the title came from the subject of an e-mail he received from a fan shortly after September 11.\n\nBradbury was upset by what he considered the appropriation of his title, and wanted the film renamed.\n\nThe conservative political action group Move America Forward mounted a letter-writing campaign pressuring theater chains not to screen the film, which it compared to \"an al-Qaeda training video.\" \"We've been causing them [the cinemas] an enormous amount of aggravation\", said group member and talk radio host Melanie Morgan.\n\nCitizens United, a conservative group run by David Bossie, filed a complaint before the Federal Election Commission charging that ads for the film constitute political advertising and thus may not be aired 60 days before an election or 30 days before a party convention. On August 5, the FEC unanimously dismissed the complaint finding no evidence that the movie's ads had broken the law. A further complaint filed in 2005 was also rejected.\n\nShailagh Murray described \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" in \"The Wall Street Journal\" as a \"harshly satirical and controversial portrait of the Bush presidency.\" Stephen Dalton of \"The Times\" wrote that the movie \"hits enough of its satirical targets to qualify as an important and timely film.\" Desson Thomson says \"there is more to \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" than partisan ridicule. ... What's remarkable here isn't Moore's political animosity or ticklish wit. It's the well-argued, heartfelt power of his persuasion.\" Author and blogger Andrew Sullivan expressed the opposite view, writing that Moore's film is \"deeply corrosive of the possibility of real debate and reason in our culture.\" Canadian journalist Linda McQuaig wrote in response to Sullivan: \"Hell, the media shut down real debate long ago. It is precisely because the debate has been so thoroughly corroded by the mainstream media ... that Moore's film is being so gratefully received by so many.\" Denis Hamill considers \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" to be a \"corrective to the daily drumbeat of right-wing talk radio.\"\n\nEnglish-American journalist and literary critic Christopher Hitchens and Democratic politician Ed Koch contend that \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" contains distortions and untruths and is propaganda. Hitchens also compared Michael Moore to Leni Riefenstahl in his critique for \"Slate\" magazine: \"Here we glimpse a possible fusion between the turgid routines of MoveOn.org and the filmic standards, if not exactly the filmic skills, of Sergei Eisenstein or Leni Riefenstahl.\" He later labeled Moore \"a completely promiscuous opportunist [and] extremely callous person.\"\n\nAuthor and political commentator Peter Holding called Hitchens' analogy \"hysterical, unfair and offensive,\" adding that \"some of the criticism directed towards Moore's film displays the very same characteristics for which Moore's film has been criticised\". Fellow \"Slate\" columnist and Iraq war critic David Edelstein, though generally supportive of the film, wrote \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" \"is an act of counterpropaganda that has a boorish, bullying force\", but called it a \"legitimate abuse of power.\" Prominent French intellectual Bernard-Henri Lévy agreed the war was \"a bad idea\", but was sympathetic to the neoconservative point of view and disagreed with what he perceived to be the film's \"core\" argument, that \"we have no reason to be interfering\" in the Middle East. Joe Scarborough alleges that Moore has ducked criticism and dodged interviews from both himself and Hitchens.\n\nMoore has published both a list of facts and sources for \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" and a document establishing agreements between the points made in his film and the findings of the 9/11 Commission (the independent, bipartisan panel directed by Congress and Bush to investigate the facts and circumstances surrounding the September 11 attacks).\n\nEarly on in the film, Moore explains that Bush continued reading \"The Pet Goat\" with a classroom of second graders at Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida for an extended period of time after being told of the attacks.\n\nThe school's principal, Gwendolyn Tose'-Rigell, explained, \"I don't think anyone could have handled it better. What would it have served if he had jumped out of his chair and ran out of the room?\" Some of the schoolchildren, now grown, have expressed similar views; Mariah Williams, one of the students, stated in 2011 that, \"I'm just glad he didn't get up and leave because then I would have been more scared and confused.\"\n\nA 9/11 Commission Staff Report entitled \"Improvising a Homeland Defense\" said: \"The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening.\"\n\nAccording to senior White House correspondent Bill Sammon and his inside look at the Bush administration's response to 9/11, \"Fighting Back: The War on Terrorism from Inside the White House\", Press Secretary Ari Fleischer was holding up a legal pad upon which he had written a message telling Bush not to say anything yet.\n\nAccording to Christopher Hitchens, Moore had argued in a previous public debate that Osama bin Laden was to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and thus questions the treatment of bin Laden in the film. \"Something – I cannot guess what, since we knew as much then as we do now – has since apparently persuaded Moore that Osama Bin Laden is as guilty as hell. Indeed, Osama is suddenly so guilty and so all-powerful that any other discussion of any other topic is a dangerous 'distraction' from the fight against him. I believe that I understand the convenience of this late conversion.\" Hitchens was subsequently invited to appear on Joe Scarborough's MSNBC talk show, \"Scarborough Country\", at which point a tape recording of his debate with Moore at the Telluride Film Festival in 2002 was replayed.\n\nWhen the video ended, Hitchens proceeded to explain: \"Why does someone who thought that Osama was innocent and Afghanistan was no problem suddenly switch in this way? Because unless he says that he was dead wrong all along and Osama Laden was innocent and wronged, he can't say that everything else is a distraction from the hunt for Osama.\" Host Joe Scarborough agreed with Hitchens and criticised Moore for inconsistency, accusing him of \"hypocrisy\" for assuming bin Laden is innocent one minute \"and yet, in this movie, at the very beginning, he criticizes George Bush for not assuming the bin Laden family is somehow guilty, then letting them out of the country.\"\n\n\"Flak\" magazine editor Stephen Himes, after watching \"Scarborough Country\" and reviewing a transcript of the Telluride debate, wrote that Hitchens had misconstrued Moore's remarks: \"Hitchens actually performs some Clintonian semantic gymnastics here. Moore's \"if\" is not intending 'I think Osama is innocent and the Afghan war is unjustified;' he's trying to make an argument for American due process: 'If he and his group were the ones who did this, then they should be tracked down, captured and brought to justice'.\" Film critic Christopher Parry also took issue with Hitchens' interpretation of Moore's remarks, writing \"If you've got to build a case against Jeffery Dahmer, you've got to build a case against Bin Laden.\"\n\nCNN news anchor Daryn Kagan asked Moore why, if he is so willing to uphold the law, he could also be critical of the Bush administration for pursuing Osama bin Laden at the same time. Moore replied:\n\nMoore implicates the White House in allowing relatives of Osama bin Laden to leave the United States without being interviewed at length by the FBI. In his narration in the movie, Moore states that \"At least six private jets and nearly two dozen commercial planes carried the Saudis and the Bin Ladens out of the U.S. after September 13.\" Moore based this statement on the research of Craig Unger, author of \"House of Bush, House of Saud\", whom he interviewed for the film. Passenger lists can be found at the House of Bush website.\n\nChristopher Hitchens points to a statement by former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke when interviewed by \"The Hill\" newspaper in May 2004, in which \"he, and he alone, took the responsibility for authorizing [the] Saudi departures.\" Hitchens says that Moore interviewed Clarke and \"either he didn't ask Clarke, who authorized those flights, or Clarke told him it was me and only me, and he didn't think it was good enough to use. ... Either way, that's below the level of trash TV, trash journalism.\" After quitting his White House position, Clarke became a prominent critic of the Bush administration's war on terrorism. Hitchens contends that the film does not mention Clarke's remarks so that it can criticize Bush for not going after Bin Laden's family, while holding up Clarke as a heroic, anti-war figure.\n\nThe filmmaker defended himself in an interview with ABC News correspondent Jake Tapper, answering: \"Actually I do [display the] article and it's blown up 40 foot on the screen, you can see Richard Clarke's name right there saying that he approved the flights based on the information the FBI gave him. It's right there, right up on the screen. I don't agree with Clarke on this point. Just because I think he's good on a lot of things doesn't mean I agree with him on everything.\"\n\nMoore, on his website and in \"The Official Fahrenheit 9/11 Reader\", points to additional statements by Richard Clarke, also published in \"The Hill\", which he believes support his contention that the White House approved the flights. The following is a chronological summary:\n\n\nOn May 18, 2004, \"The Hill\" quoted FBI spokesman on counterterrorism John Iannarelli as denying that the FBI had any \"role in facilitating these flights one way or another.\" The FBI's denial of involvement was repeated to \"The Hill\" by another spokesperson, Donna Spiser, in a May 26, 2004 article. She is quoted as saying \"We haven't had anything to do with arranging and clearing the flights.\" She states that the FBI's involvement was limited to interviewing those people on the flight it thought were of interest: \"We did know who was on the flights and interviewed anyone we thought we needed to.\"\n\nThe May 18 article in \"The Hill\", which was published prior to Clarke's May 25 claim of responsibility, quoted 9/11 Commission vice-chair Lee H. Hamilton as saying: \"We don't know who authorized [the flights]. We've asked that question 50 times.\" A May 26 article in \"The Hill\" quoted another Commission member, Tim Roemer, as being unconvinced by Clarke's claim of sole responsibility for approving the flights: \"It doesn't seem that Richard Clarke had enough information to clear it... I just don't think that the questions are resolved, and we need to dig deeper... Clarke sure didn't seem to say that he was the final decisionmaker. I believe we need to continue to look for some more answers.\"\n\nAllegations concerning the Bush administration's refusal to provide information to the 9/11 Commission about the Saudi flights are disputed. The May 18, 2004 article in \"The Hill\" says that Commission vice-chairman Lee Hamilton \"disclosed the administration's refusal to answer questions on the sensitive subject during a recent closed-door meeting with a group of Democratic senators, according to several Democratic sources.\" It also says that Republican Commission member John Lehman \"said... that he told the senators the White House has been fully cooperative.\" President Bush, who met privately with the Saudi Arabian ambassador on the morning of Sept. 13, 2001, is suspected of personally authorizing the controversial flights while all other air travel had been halted.\n\nMoore interviews author Craig Unger and retired FBI agent Jack Cloonan, both of whom say bin Laden family members were not questioned in a serious manner at length before being allowed to leave. The September 11 Commission has found that 22 of the 26 people on the \"bin Laden\" flight were interviewed before being allowed to leave the country with many being asked \"detailed questions\". A September 2, 2004 CNN news article reported that \"However, in a recent interview with the AP, bin Laden's estranged sister-in-law said she does not believe that family members have cut [Osama] off entirely. Carmen Binladin, who has changed the spelling of her name and lives in Switzerland, said bin Laden is not the only religious brother in the family, and she expects his sisters to support him as well. 'They are very close to Osama,' she said.\"\n\nIn June 2007, Judicial Watch published partially declassified FBI documents on the flights obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request. Eric Lichtblau, writing in \"The New York Times\", said the heavily redacted documents \"do not appear to contradict directly any of those central findings [of the Sept. 11 commission] but they raise some new questions about the episode.\" In several cases, \"Saudi travelers were not interviewed before departing the country, and F.B.I. officials sought to determine how what seemed to be lapses had occurred.\" Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said: \"The documents contain numerous errors and inconsistencies which prove the FBI conducted a slapdash investigation of the Saudi flights.\"\n\nThe film suggests that the invasion of Iraq was an illegitimate attack on a sovereign nation – an unnecessary attack against an exaggerated threat. It makes a case against components of the Bush Doctrine, specifically against the concepts of pre-emptive war combined with American unilateralism. The film also contends that the focus of the United States should have been directed elsewhere.\n\nChristopher Hitchens criticized the film for not mentioning the history of repression, aggression, war crimes and the general state of human rights in Saddam Hussein's Iraq, nor Iraq's noncompliance with numerous United Nations resolutions. Hitchens writes, \"in this peaceable kingdom, according to Moore's flabbergasting choice of film shots, children are flying little kites, shoppers are smiling in the sunshine, and the gentle rhythms of life are undisturbed. Then—wham! From the night sky come the terror weapons of American imperialism. Watching the clips Moore uses, and recalling them well, I can recognize various Saddam palaces and military and police centers getting the treatment. But these sites are not identified as such. In fact, I don't think Al Jazeera would, on a bad day, have transmitted anything so utterly propagandistic.\" While interviewing Hitchens on his show, Scarborough claimed to be outraged at Moore's portrayal of the Iraqi insurgency, claiming Moore's film suggests \"those killing Americans in Iraq aren't the enemy, but rather they are the revolution and the Minutemen, who are sure to win their battle against the occupation\" and that \"Moore says that the enemy is George Bush and Saddam Hussein and Mr. Zarqawi and Mr. Bin Laden are no problem. ... Indeed, they are the Minutemen. They're the staunch American revolutionaries.\"\n\nMoore has frequently stated his opinion that Saddam was a brutal tyrant, though this opinion is not mentioned in the film. He said calling attention to Saddam's crimes was unnecessary considering the corporate media had continually pressed that point themselves, making it public knowledge.\nChristopher Hitchens criticizes Moore for stating, in his film, that Iraq had not killed or attacked an American: \"Moore asserts that Iraq under Saddam had never attacked or killed or even threatened (his words) any American. I never quite know whether Moore is as ignorant as he looks, or even if that would be humanly possible.\" Hitchens writes that Palestinian terrorists Muhammad Zaidan and Abu Nidal had been free to move in and out of Baghdad, and that Saddam's armed forces had exchanged fire and killed American soldiers during the first Gulf War. When interviewed by Jake Tapper, Moore denied having said Hussein's regime had not ever killed an American, insisting his movie had been misquoted: \"That isn't what I said. Quote the movie directly. \"Murdered\". The government of Iraq did not commit a premeditated murder on an American citizen.\" His narration is reproduced verbatim in \"The Official Fahrenheit Reader\", including a chapter on critiques and supporting evidence.\n\nMoore says that only one member of Congress had a child serving in Iraq: Army Staff Sergeant Brooks Johnson, the son of Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD). According to Karen Kucher, when \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" was nearing release to the home-video market, two additional Congressmen's children were stationed in Iraq: the son of Congressman Duncan L. Hunter (R-CA), USMC Lieutenant Duncan D. Hunter (who was later elected to Congress himself); and the son of Joe Wilson (R-SC), Army National Guard Captain Alan Wilson.\n\n\"Fahrenheit 9/11\" also used footage of Moore confronting various members of Congress, encouraging them to enlist their own children to fight in Iraq. Moore approached Congressman Mark Kennedy (R-MN) and showed Kennedy giving Moore a quizzical, confused look. Kennedy expressed displeasure about his portrayal, saying he offered to help Moore and also indicated he had a nephew serving in Afghanistan, but this was edited out of the film.\n\nMoore's inclusion of a 10-second clip with amputee Peter Damon has been criticized. Damon said the filmmaker \"should be ashamed of himself\" for claiming that soldiers were deceived into supporting the Iraq War and for using his injuries as reason to oppose the conflict. Damon \"agree[s] with the President 100%. A lot of the guys down at Walter Reed feel the same way.\" According to Damon's doctor, Lt. Col. Chester Buckenmaier, Moore took \"a very positive thing we're doing for soldiers\" who lost limbs and \"used it to tell a lie.\" Responding to the criticism, associate producer Joanne Doroshow said, \"Anybody who has seen the film knows we have nothing but the deepest respect for the soldiers who were wounded. One of the purposes of the movie was to examine the impossible situation they were put into and to raise questions about why they were sent there.\"\n\nPeter Damon sued Moore in federal court for $85 million, alleging that the film gave a false impression and was defamatory. Moore's attorney argued in response that the film quoted Damon verbatim and did not take his statements out of context nor give a false impression. The judge agreed and dismissed Damon's suit. In March 2008, the First Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed the ruling in Moore's favor.\n\nDocumentary films made in response to \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" include: \"Celsius 41.11\" and \"Fahrenhype 9/11\" (narrated by Ron Silver).\n\nUnauthorized copying of the film was widespread. An early version taped at a cinema was distributed using the peer-to-peer file sharing protocol BitTorrent. The distributors expressed unhappiness and suggested potential legal action, but according to the \"Sunday Herald\", Moore responded, \"I don't have a problem with people downloading the movie and sharing it with people as long as they're not trying to make a profit off of my labor\". A \"mint copy\" of the film possibly appeared on the Lionsgate website itself, reported \"The Inquirer\". Unlicensed screenings were also held in Cuba.\n\n"}

It was the first Zimbabwean film since independence set during the Rhodesian Bush War, and served as a tribute to the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army's many female guerrillas.\n\nIn 1975, Florence, an impulsive young peasant girl from the Mashonaland countryside, decides to run away and join the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) after her father is detained by the Rhodesian Security Forces. She and her friend Nyasha subsequently brave the dangers of the African bush on a long trek to a refugee camp in neighbouring Mozambique, where they are trained as militants by ZANU's insurgent wing, ZANLA. Both adopt new revolutionary identities: Nyasha becomes \"Liberty\", representing her desire for self-sufficiency, while Florence brands herself \"Flame\", representing passion.\n\nLife in the Mozambican refugee camps is hard: Flame and Liberty must learn to deal with the hardship and constant dangers of insurgent life. To complicate matters, some unscrupulous male guerrillas - such as Comrade Che, a ZANLA political commissar, assume that female members of the party would be available to satisfy their sexual desires. When Flame rejects his advances, Che rapes and impregnates her with his child.\n\nAlthough naturally devastated, Flame reconciles with Che and is shattered when he and their son are killed by a Rhodesian air strike. Determining she has nothing to live for but the conflict, Flame goes on to distinguish herself during ZANLA raids on farms and infrastructure. Zimbabwean independence in the 1980s proves bittersweet for Flame, who finds it difficult adjusting to civilian life. Under Robert Mugabe's new government, rural unemployment is rising, thousands continue to migrate to urban areas in search of work, and many ZANLA veterans - including Flame's new husband - feel disillusioned or ignored. Flame relocates to Harare, where Liberty has used her background as an intelligence officer to secure a lucrative administrative post, although their reunion is short-lived: Flame wants assistance but Liberty no longer believes in the collectivist principles of mutual support and shared purpose once preached by ZANU during the bush war.\n\nThe two acquaintances finally attend a Heroes' Day party, nearly fifteen years after their struggle against white Rhodesia began, in an increasingly authoritarian Zimbabwe. They continue to greet passerby with the old pan-African slogan, \"A luta continua\" (\"the struggle continues\") as the film closes.\n\n\nThe film was shot in Zimbabwe.\n\nFlame was selected for the 1996 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nFlame received several awards in the following film festivals:\n\nSouthern African Film Festival, Harare\n\nJournées de Cinématographe de Carthage, Tunis\n\nAmiens Film Festival, Amiens, France\n\nM-Net Film Awards, Cape Town\n\nThe Annonay International Film Festival, France\n\nThe Milan African Film Festival\n\nThe Human Rights Watch International Film Festival, New York\n\nThe International Women's Film Festival in Turenne (1998)\n\nAfter being shown to the Veterans Association of Zimbabwe, the veterans claimed it was \"full of lies\" and were angered by the rape scene. The film was confiscated by police for being \"subversive and pornographic\", but was returned to the producers after a worldwide campaign. Ultimately, it passed Zimbabwean censors and became a box office success and the number one film of the year in Zimbabwe.\n\n"}

Hershey, then Director of the Selective Service. General Hershey Bar, General HersheyBar, and General Hershy Bar spelling variants can be found in the General's own publications and those of the general public when referring to him. Maton's also used The Calypso Kid and Calypso Joe during his work in Calypso music.\n\nBorn William Arthur Matons in September 1906 and died October 13, 1993 (dates not verified). Bill Matons danced under his birth name in the 1930s in the Modern Dance worlds of New York. Matons then began to use Calypso Kid, on stage and on the radio during the Calypso Craze of the 40s. He also used Calypso Joe, a stage name created when he was a calypso dancer, promoter, night club owner in the 40s and 50s. Finally, in the 1960s he adopted the name General Hershy Bar. He kept the name the rest of his life, and most of the time in public he stayed 'in character' as part of his anti-war street-theater.\n\nHe was adopted and raised by Lithuanian parents who encouraged his ad-lib performing talents. He was a modern dancer and choreographer in New York in the 1930s. He was born in Cleveland Ohio, the son of gypsy immigrants. His father settled down to a life making violins in Cleveland, and then moved shortly to Racine, Wisconsin where Matons went to grade school. The family then moved to Milwaukee where he attended a semester of high school before going to work in the steel mills. After this job he was a steeple-jack, coast guardsman, cook on a yacht, and also sold jewelry. He read books on dancing and found notice of Charles Weidman dance scholarships in New York City. After only three months with Weiman's group he appeared in \"Americana\". In his twenties he was dance director of \"Railroads on Parade\" at the NY World's Fair and danced in \"As Thousands Cheer\".\n\nDuring the Great Depression, the NY modern dance world was influenced by the politics of the left as covered in Ellen Graf's book, \"Stepping Left Dance and Politics in New York City 1928-1942\". Bill Matons appears on the cover of this book in the center.\n\nWilliam, or Bill Matons danced with the Humphrey-Weidman company in New York, from 1933 to 1936 and again in 1940. He appeared in the Charles Weidman works, \"Ringside\", \"Studies in Conflict\", \"Candide\" (1933), \"Traditions\" (1935), and \"American Saga\" (1936) as well as \"Americana\", \"As Thousands Cheer(1933)\", and \"Everywhere I Roam\". He was director of the experimental unit of the New Dance League, which evolved from the Workers Dance League between 1931-1935.\n\nAs Thousands Cheer, by Irving Berlin and Moss Hart, opened Sept 30, 1933 at the Music Box Theater and closed Sept 8, 1934, with 400 performances by the Charles Weidman dancers Letitia Ide and Jose Limon with William Matons and others.\n\nOn July 25, 1936 at Bennington, Vermont, the New Dance League presented performances by Anna Sokolow, Bill Matons, Fara Lynn, and Eva Desca. April 25, 1937 New Dance League presented Dances of Today at St. James Theater. Included at this show were, \"Songs of Protest - Lay Down Late and Sistern and Brethern\", \"Song for Soviet Youth Day\", \"Under the Swastika: Germans Think with Your Blood\", \"Though we be flogged\". Bill Matons also appeared in \"Letter to a Policeman in Kansas City\".\n\nIn 1938 he danced some early poems of Kenneth Patchen in New York and is mentioned in Patchen's papers at the UCSC special collections archive.\n\nHe was choreographer for the Lenin Peace Pageant at Madison Square Garden in 1937. Performed with Ailes Gilmour in \"\"Adelante\",\" a Works Progress Administration sponsored Broadway musical in 1939. \"Adelante\", a work with a Spanish theme, opened April 4, 1939 at Daly's Theater and had 16 performances and Matons created the leading role and danced it. The show included Helen Tamiris among others. Tamiris was important in the WPA Federal Dance Project and believed strongly in using dance to explore social themes.\n\nMatons led the Experimental Dance Group in the late 1930s. His dancers included a young Rebecca Lepkoff. He choreographed for the 1939 Worlds Fair in New York, creating the dance for \"Railroads on Parade - Drama of Transport\". The music for this was written by Kurt Weil. Weil had started the score in spring 1938. It was written as a Circus Opera using the elements of theater music from opera to circus. Matons hired Rebecca Lepkoff for the Worlds Fair show and as he could pay a decent wage, uncommon at during the depression, Lepkoff used this money to buy her first camera, starting her photography career.\n\nThe author Ramsay Burt described how Matons choreographed and produced, \"One Sixth of the Earth\" while with Humphrey-Weidman. Burt notes that Matons used the motif of \"...poignant speeches by anonymous witnesses in the crowd...derived from the tradition of agit-prop Living Newspapers with origins in the Soviet Union\".\n\nIn 1939 Matons was still working with Doris Humphrey in the Humphrey-Weidman company.\n\nIn 1938 while with Humphrey and Weidman he began to focus on calypso dance and music. Earlier in his life, while working on a boat, he heard the music while working on a ship stopped in Trinidad (1935), but he had not considered the dance aspect at that time. He found a Spanish music store in Harlem owned by Costellanos Molinas, brought some music home, and made up some dances in 1938. He coached performers from the West Indies in dances and stage techniques to improve their showmanship. He started to import singers to the US and began to have a monopoly on calypso there.\n\nLate 1938 he brought calypso to New York City night life at the Village Vanguard with the Duke of Iron, Gerald Clark and his Calypso Serenaders and a half dozen dancers. The show included satirical acts on important issues of the day. The Calypso Kid stages the revues at the Vanguard with the songs \"Edward the VIII\" or \"Roosevelt in Trinidad\" made into small skits with pantomime and dance. Matons and his calypso crew traveled the US and beyond performing shows. Calypso was still a fairly niche market until Joe Miller a radio comic brought the song, \"Rum and Coco-Cola\" to the US in 1945. A calypso craze swept the nation following this. Many of the songs were banned from radio play at the time due to the earthy nature of many calypso songs.\n\nMatons' importance in the start of the Calypso Craze is noted in the book, \"Encuentros sincopados: el caribe contemporáneo a través de sus prácticas musicales -\"Historia (Siglo Veintiuno Editores) Pensamiento caribeño\"\" by Lara Ivette Lopez de Jesus; \"...there never was any organized dance for the calypso; therefore no calypso dance ever existed in reality, only in name...The first person who organized such a dance was an American named Bill Maton, a dancer. He had visited Trinidad in 1935, and appeared in shows in the US and Canada\"\n\nIn the 40s and 50s he was performing with calypso singers and operating a night club in NY where he used the name Calypso Kid and then Calypso Joe. A picture of him as Calypso Joe in costume in 1952 is on the Dallas Library Site. A notice in Billboard for April 7, 1945 mentions him coming to Hollywood, \"...now that Rum and Coca Cola is hot...\" with his revue of calypso stars Lord Beginner, Lord Caresser, Lord Dignity, Chief Eagle Eye, The Duke of Iron and others. He operated a calypso night club in Honolulu in the 1950s. By 1957 he had a calypso night club act appearing in Las Vegas.\n\nAllied Artists Pictures Corporation in Los Angeles came out with Calypso Joe (1957) starring The Duke of Iron and Angie Dickinson among others. Papers noted that it did not include Matons, or compensate him for the use of the name he had spent years building up.\n\nIn Los Angeles he self-published several monographs and booklets using the publishing company he created, Handicap Publications. The PeaceNut cartoons were published by Handicap, showing a business location of 5420 Carlton Way, Hollywood, CA. Handicap Pictures was established for producing short films in \"true bloody color\", as he said. Titles included, \"President Johnson the Defoliate President\", and \"Damn the constitution-undeclared wars-full speed ahead\" with the theme song \"your lyin’ cheat in’ heart\" and he mentions his saying \"give war no quarter because it ain’t worth a dime\" in one. He published his book, \"kiss don't kill\" in 1967 (Handicap Publications). Another publication was \"Get off your apathy!: a biography of Florence Beaumont, who burned herself instead of others! —like phony politicians\", by Thomas Michael Dunphy (aka \"General Wastemoreland\"), Handicap Publications 1968. This work also contains sections written by General Hershy Bar.\n\nIn 1972 he became the manager of an apartment building in Hollywood, CA. The 42-unit Afton Arms Apartments were built in 1924 at 6141 Place and El Centro in Los Angeles by architect Leland Bryant. The building was the site of many important dissident activities, The Hollywood Ten and Art Kunkin's LA Free Press both used the Grand Ball room. In 1987, Hillel Slovak of the Red Hot Chili Peppers was found dead in his apartment in the building where he lived. The General renamed the building \"The Happy Malaga Castle\" in 1972\n\nIn 1978 he was one of the participants at the first Doo Dah Parade, an irreverent alternative to the traditional formality of the Rose Parade in Pasadena. Through the late 1970s to early 1980s he lived on Harvard Blvd in Hollywood, CA. In Hollywood he would 'perform' his anti-war guerrilla street theater for tourists to Grauman's Chinese Theater and other Hollywood Boulevard locations, including while on the RTD bus he got around on. He died October 13, 1993. He was frequently seen partnered with General Waste More Land (aka Tom Dunphy), a parody of General William Westmoreland. The characters were common at street theater performances and demonstrations against U.S. military involvement in Vietnam. Tom Dunphy (aka \"General Waste More Land\") still lives in Berkeley Ca (see video below). He would greet people on the street he met as \"General\" and salute often as well, which was saying that we are all Generals and so complicit in war.\n\n\n\n\nList of choreographers\n\nList of peace activists\n\nList of dance personalities\n"}

However, the term is also used in a number of specific senses. Several origins have been proposed for the word. According to Merriam-Webster, \"goof\" is likely a variation of \"goff\" in an English dialect, meaning simpleton. Some say the word may come from an identically pronounced Hebrew word meaning \"body\", some even say it was just a mistake happened while typing the word \" good\", hence the word \"goof\" is also known as other word for mistake. Others believe that it was inspired by the Disney character, Goofy (though it is more likely that the character got his name from the word, not the word from the character). See the etymological explanation of Hessu Hopo, 'Goofy' in Finnish language.\n\nThere is a Spanish word, \"gofio,\" which refers to the balls of toasted flour and salt eaten by the original inhabitants of the Canary Islands. In Latin America (esp. Cuba) the word \"comegofio\" (lit. \"gofio-eater\") came to refer to anyone from the Canaries, stereotyped as primitive or stupid.\n\nIn filmmaking, a goof is a mistake made during film production that finds its way into the final released picture. Depending upon the film and the actual scene, the goof may have different effects: a loss in realism, an annoyance, or it could just be funny. It is often a type of continuity error. Goofs are also known as \"bloopers\" or \"mistakes\".\n\nThere are several types of goofs, for example:\n\nGoofs can be found in a large number of films, even in very expensive productions. \"\" for example has been counted to have 200 goofs in it, ranging from disappearing props, to a storm trooper hitting his head on an opening door.\n\nIn broader usage, a goof is a mistake, or a foolish person. In the context of foolishness, the word was a favorite of Dennis Farina on the TV series \"Crime Story\".\n\nIt can also be a synonym for funny, awesome, silly, dumb, or hysterical, and is often used to express someone who is particularly silly and takes the silliness to another level; such as the Disney character Goofy.\n\n\"Goof\" can also be extended into \"goofball\" or \"goofer\" a term which describes one who is goofy, foolish, silly or ludicrous. In some urban communities the term \"goofy yute\" is commonly used.\n\nIn some parts of Canada, \"goof\" has been used in the prison system, mainly associated with child abusers and later used to describe sexual offenders of any sort. Sometimes, the inmate who has been called a \"goof\" must defend himself with physical violence against the inmate who called him that name. It also is used, especially in Canadian elementary and high schools, as a general insult.\n\n\n"}

The film was written, directed and produced by Kamal Haasan, who also acted as the protagonist in the film. The film's soundtrack and background score were composed by Ilaiyaraaja. The semi-fictional plot centers on India's Partition and the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi by Nathuram Godse.\n\nThe film was screened at the International Film Festival of India, and was selected by Film Federation of India as its submission to the Oscars in the year 2000, but was not nominated. The film has garnered three National Film Awards. The copyrights to this film are owned by Shah Rukh Khan's Red Chillies Entertainment.\n\nThe film is about a protagonist's journey from religious hatred to love with the theme of the partition of Bengal in the background. Its relevance in the present environment clouded by religious extremism was widely unrecognised. This is the story of Saket Ram, as narrated by his grandson. The film takes place as Ram, a retired archaeologist, lies on the deathbed, on 6 December 1999, the 7th anniversary of the destruction of the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya.\n\nThe movie begins at present day with Saket Ram (Kamal Haasan), an 89-year-old Hindu man at his death bed in Madras. He is being taken care of by his grandson Saket Ram Junior, a famous novelist who writes historical fiction, and their family doctor, Munawar. Ram Jr. explains how he grew up listening to his grandfather's stories. He then narrates one of his grandfather's strangest stories that he plans to use for his next novel. As Ram Jr. narrates the story, Ram is reminded of it.\n\nThe scene reverts to the 1940s, when he and his good friend, Amjad Ali Khan (Shah Rukh Khan) are archaeologists working together under their boss, Mortimer Wheeler, in Mohenjo-daro in the Sindh province in what was then North-West India. Relations are pleasant between the Indians and the English. Saket and Amjad do not approve of partition and the creation of Pakistan. Although many Indian Muslims plan to move to Pakistan, Amjad decides to stay in India as he believes it is his homeland and he does not wish to live under Sharia law.\n\nAfter the archaeological site is shut down out of fear of riots, young Ram returns to Calcutta to be with his wife, Aparna (Rani Mukherjee), a school teacher. On his way home, he witnesses the riots and chaos over the issue of the formation of Pakistan and the call by Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of modern Pakistan, for \"Direct Action\". While out to get some food, Ram manages to save an innocent Sikh girl from the hands of a Muslim gang. When he returns to his house, he finds a group of Muslims entering his house. They brutally rape and murder Aparna. Saket, unable to cope with his tragic loss, kills the Muslims who raped and killed his wife in a fit of rage.\n\nOutside his house, he runs into Shriram Abhyankar (Atul Kulkarni), who is part of a Hindu nationalist group determined to fight the Muslims' malice and persecution with similar brute force, and assassinate Gandhi for what they perceive to be his treachery towards Hindu dominated India. Gandhi wants Hindus and Muslims to co-exist peacefully with a hope of winning over the hearts of the rioters through sheer self-pity, but Abhyankar and his fellow extremists have lost patience at what they deemed Gandhi's unreasonable stand to appease the Muslim League and their demand for Pakistan.\n\nBack in his hometown of Thanjavur, Ram's Uncle Bahsyahm and Aunt Vasanthato urge him to remarry. He is then married to the daughter of family friends, Mythili (Vasundhara Das). While his wedding is being celebrated across the village, Ram tells his childhood friends Vedha and Yegham that he has no reason to be happy since the world's biggest political divorce is going on with the separation of Pakistan in the north. During his first night, he learns that Mythili, like her family, are supporters of Gandhi and that the Mahatma will be visiting Calcutta a few days later on the anniversary of the bloody riots. Ram travels to Calcutta alone and learns that a Mr. Nair now lives at his old apartment. Nair gives him a goddess painting drawn by Aparna not long before her death. Later that night, Ram joins a mob that confronts Gandhi and Suhrawardy, then Chief Minister of Bengal, about the bloody riots. When questioned about whether they take full responsibility for the riots, both of them accept and ask for forgiveness. The mob forgives them, but Ram refuses to.\n\nAlthough Ram remains aloof at first, he slowly falls in love with Mythili. However, on their honeymoon in Maharashtra, Ram and Mythili bump into a disguised Abhyankar, who introduces them to a dethroned Maharaja. During a hunting trip with Abhyankar and the Maharaja, Ram is reunited with an old friend from Calcutta, Manohar Lalwani (Saurabh Shukla) who lost his family and home in the riots. After seeing Lalwani's misery, Ram realizes he has still not gotten over Aparna's murder. Under Abhyankar's influence, Ram comes to the belief that Mahatma Gandhi is solely responsible for the division of India and of the two religions and also of having supported whom they viewed as the enemy. Hindu fundamentalists, including the Maharaja and Abhyankar, are furious and plot to murder Gandhi. Ram unwittingly becomes a part of their militant organization that plots to do away with Gandhi. Due to a horse-riding accident, Abhyankar has left a quadriplegic and has Ram swear that he will carry on his work, that of killing the Mahatma.\n\nBack in present day, Ram Senior's situation worsens. Ram Junior tries to convince his father Mohan to accompany them to the hospital, but he is uninterested for some unknown reason. In the end, Ram Jr. and Munavar take him to the hospital but are stopped by the police since there are bomb blasts in Madras due to Hindu-Muslim communal riots. Ram asks \"Even now?\". A Muslim soldier, Ibrahim makes them hide in an underground shelter for their safety. As they try to stay silent to avoid being attacked by the mob, Ram reminisces about how he plotted to kill Gandhi many decades ago.\n\nBack in newly independent India, Ram begins to prepare to assassinate Gandhi once he returns to Madras. A pregnant Mythili becomes worried as her husband grows more distant and invites her parents and in-laws over to cheer him up. However, Ram has made up his mind to end Gandhi's life and leaves home for Varanasi, where he goes through a purification ritual. Then, he heads for Delhi and unknowingly stays at the same hotel as another fundamentalist planning to kill Gandhi, Nathuram Godse. When the police arrive to question Godse, a paranoid Ram hides his gun in a truck. Later on, Ram goes to the soda factory in Chandni Chowk where the truck was heading to.\n\nIn Chandni Chowk, Ram is reunited with Amjad, who takes him to the soda factory. It is revealed that many Muslims civilians, including Amjad's wife Nafisa and their children, are hiding there out of fear of being attacked by Hindus during curfew. When it is discovered that Ram came there for a gun, the Muslims became suspicious that he might be out to kill them, attack him. A fight ensues that triggers a series of violent events in the area. While trying to escape both Hindu and Muslim mobs, Amjad finds out that Ram is in Delhi to assassinate Gandhi and he tries to convince his friend to not do it. He reveals that his father did not die of natural causes. He was murdered by a Hindu mob.\n\nHe begs him, kneeling and asking forgiveness for Aparna's death. He says he forgives Ram for his father's. Then he asks Ram to shoot him and tells him that he will take Ram's bullet if his death will grant both Hindus and Muslims peace. He says that he is willing to die if his death gets rid of the hatred that has turned Ram mad.\n\nJust then, they are cornered by a Hindu mob who try to kill Amjad, but he is saved by Ram. Amjad is struck on the back of the head and Ram takes him back to the soda factory. Together, they then help protect the Muslims hiding in the soda factory until the authorities arrive to control the situation. Amjad is shot in the leg.\n\nAmjad is fatally injured and is questioned by Officer Rao about the man who started the violence. He is asked about the fake name, Bhaivan, that Ram used since he arrived at his hotel.\n\nBefore dying, Amjad lies that he has never seen that man before, and all he knows is his brother Ram who despite everything, saved his life. He dies holding his brother's hand.\n\nRam then bumps into father-in-law and his friend who are there to meet Gandhi. He learns that his uncle and aunt have died after learning he has left. Gandhi requests to see Ram to invite him on his long walk to Pakistan after finding out he helped save innocent Muslims. Ram ultimately changes his mind about Gandhi after seeing that his teachings are all about love and non-violence. He decides against assassinating the leader, and attempts to confess the truth to him in order to beg for forgiveness. However, it is too late as Gandhi is eventually killed by another assassin, Nathuram Godse. Ironically, Gandhi dies without his famous last words: \"Hey Ram!\" as popularly believed, and as in Richard Attenborough's film Gandhi.\n\nThen on, Ram lives by Gandhian principles. As the situation on the streets starts to cool down, Ram whispers his last words to his grandson and eventually dies. Before Ram Junior leaves with his grandfather's body, he learns that the soldier's name is Ibrahim and that he is a Muslim.\n\nDuring his funeral, Gandhi's great-grandson Tushar comes and sees Ram Senior's private room which is full of historical photos. Ram Junior hands over Gandhi's footwear and spectacles which his late grandfather had previously collected from the place of the shootout and had treasured throughout his life.\n\nThe shooting was started in Madhava Perumal Temple, Mylapore. Violinist L. Subramaniam was selected to work as the music composer and completed recording songs for the project. However, before finishing his entire commitment for the film, he left the project fearing that his association with the film may offend Hindu people due to its contentious storyline. Ilayaraaja was subsequently selected to replace him and helped score music over the version recorded by Subramaniam. His background score was recorded by a Symphony Orchestra for the second time for an Indian film, the first time being by Ilaiyaraaja himself three years before for the Malayalam epic \"Guru\" (1997). Like Subramaniam, the Sankaracharya of Kanchi, had also filmed an interview scene for the film but later requested that his portions were removed to avoid controversy.\n\nActor Shah Rukh Khan did not ask for any remuneration from Kamal Haasan as he considered it an honour and privilege to work with one of his mentors. Haasan initially intended to title the film as \"Satya Sodanai\", which loosely translates to \"My Experiments With Truth\", the title of Gandhi's autobiography.\nRole of Shriram Abhyankar played by Atul Kulkarni was supposed to do by noted Marathi actor Mohan Gokhale, he had started working on film in Madras but suddenly he passed away due to heart attack in sleep, later Hassan roped Kulkarni another noted Marathi actor to do this role, becoming one of the best performance of his career.\n\nProduction on the film cost a total of 11 crore rupees, excluding Kamal Haasan's salary.\n\nThe film has won the following awards since its release:\n\n2000 National Film Awards \n2001 Screen Weekly Awards\nFilmfare Awards\n\nThere were protests and press releases by political parties in select centres against perceived negative depiction of Gandhi. In India the film was given an 'A' certificate by the Central Board of Film certification. In Malaysia, it was rated as Universal.. There was a speculation that the film would clash with Rajinikanth starrer Padayappa. Which proved to be untrue. \n\n\"Hey Ram\" received highly positive reviews. Charu Nivedita wrote that the film is a self-declaration of Kamal Hassan's Hindutva agenda and added that the flm per se failed on artistic grounds. T Krithika Reddy from \"The Hindu\" wrote, \"Live sound, prosthetic make-up (Micheal Westmore), splendid cinematography (Thiru), magnificent art work (Sabu Cyril) and painstakingly designed costumes (Sarika) are some of the other highlights of this magnum opus, which is distinct in style and content...The chemistry between Kamal and Rani is explosive to say the least. Shah Rukh Khan, as usual comes up with an impeccable performance. Vasundhara, as the stoic second wife makes an impressive debut. Naseerudin Shah as Gandhi steals a clear march over the others in supporting roles.\" \"Dinakaran\" wrote, \"The starting of 2000 itself has given a great joy to Tamil cinema! A Tamilian has created a film that caters to international standards.\"\n\n\"Hey Ram\" grossed in India and $550,000 (2.39 crore) in other countries, for a worldwide total of , against its budget. It had a worldwide opening weekend of , and grossed in its first week. It is the 32nd-highest-grossing film of 2000 worldwide.\n\nIt opened on Friday, February 18, 2000, across 115 screens, and earned nett on its opening day in Hindi. It grossed nett in its opening weekend, and had a first week of nett in Hindi. The film earned a total of nett, and its Hindi version was declared a \"Flop\" by \"Box Office India\". It is the 35th-highest-grossing film of 2000 in India. It's Telugu version's collection was dull due to clash of bigger Telugu stars with the movie.\n\nIt had an opening weekend of $250,000 (1.08 crore) and went on to gross $350,000 (1.52 crore) in its first week. The film earned a total of $550,000 (2.39 crore) at the end of its theatrical run. Overseas, It is the 17th-highest-grossing film of 2000.\n\n\n"}

He covered the entertainment industry for both \"Variety\" (1953–1960, 1979–1992) and \"The Hollywood Reporter\" (1992–2008) during a career which spanned seven decades. Hollinger helped to developed a new system for tracking the overseas box office while working for \"Variety's\" London bureau. He later served as the international editor at \"The Hollywood Reporter\" from 1992 until 2008, when he retired at the age of 90. Hollinger was considered an expert on the international box office and the sale independent productions directly to foreign film distributors.\n\nHollinger was born Herman Hollinger in The Bronx, New York City, on September 3, 1918. He attended Townsend Harris High School in Queens, New York. He worked as a messenger and copy boy in the classified ad department at the \"New York Times\" on Saturdays from 1932 to 1935 as a high school student. During college, Hollinger landed an internship at CBS Radio, which included a position assisting CBS' coverage of the 1940 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. Hollinger graduated from City College of New York and received a master's degree from the Columbia School of Journalism.\n\nHe served in the Armed Forces Radio from 1942 to 1945 during World War II. Following the end of the war, Hollinger wrote for a weekly newspaper in suburban Philadelphia and worked as a sports reporter for the now defunct \"New York Morning Telegraph\".\n\nHollinger departed \"The Morning Telegraph\" to take a job as a publicist at Warner Bros.. He next joined \"Variety\", the weekly entertainment trade magazine, from 1953 to 1960. While working under \"Variety's\" London bureau chief Don Grove, Hollinger co-developed a new system for tracking the overseas box office, which had been difficult to follow at the time.\n\nHollinger then returned to public relations as a publicity director for Paramount Pictures' International Telemeter Company, an experimental pay television operation, which existed during the 1950s and 1960s. He was later promoted, first to Paramount's European production publicity director, based in London, and then to Paramount's \"ad-pub\", or Vice President of Marketing. He worked on some of Paramount's best known productions of the era, including the 1970 film, \"Love Story\".\nDuring the early 1970s, Hollinger left Paramount Pictures following a change in the studio's leadership. He worked in corporate public relations, beginning in 1972. His clients included the National Basketball Players Association and Sagittarius Productions, owned by Edgar Bronfman, Sr., the head of Seagram at the time.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Hollinger ran into Syd Silverman, his former boss at \"Variety\" during the 1950s, and Robert Hawkins, a Variety executive, in Midtown Manhattan. His chance encounter with Silverman and Hawkins led Hollinger to rejoin the staff of \"Variety\" in 1979 as an associate editor focused on international issues within the industry. At the time of Hollinger's hiring, \"Variety\", based in New York City, and \"Daily Variety\", based in Hollywood, essentially operated as distinct, separate media entities. The decision to hire Hollinger in 1979 marked \"the first time in many years that weekly Variety will have its own editorial presence in the film capital,\" according to a story later published at the time.\n\nIn 1980, Hollinger broke the story that the jury at the Cannes Film Festival, chaired that year by Kirk Douglas, had been surprised that a French film, \"My American Uncle\", had been awarded the Grand Prix by Cannes' organizers, despite the fact that the jury had rejected the film as the winner.\n\nHollinger also reported on the widespread dissatisfaction with the Cannes Film Festival and MIFED, a now defunct film market held annually in Milan. International film merchants, based in Los Angeles, had to attend Cannes and MIFED, to sell their films to overseas markets during the 1970s and early 1980s. At the time, there were no comparable venues to sell U.S. films to the world markets held in the United States. His reports on the foreign sales monopolies held by Cannes and MIFED led to the establishment of the American Film Market (AFM) in 1981. Hollinger's work has been credited with the need an American alternative to Cannes and MIFED. Robert Meyers, a founding member and first chairman of the American Film Market, recalled asking other film executives, \"Why are we all going to Cannes just to sell the American independent film, and why not right here in the U.S.?\", after reading a series of Hollinger's stories in \"Variety\". The American Film Market, one of the film industry's leading marketplaces, is now held annually in Santa Monica, California.\n\nIn 1992, Hollinger left Variety, to become the international editor of 'The Hollywood Reporter'. Hollinger served as \"The Hollywood Reporter's\" international editor from 1992 until 2008, when he retired at the age of 90.\n\nHy Hollinger died at Olympia Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, on October 7, 2015, at the age of 97. Hollinger's wife of 61 years, actress Gina Collens, died on May 31, 2014, at the age of 90. He was survived by their daughter, Alicia Hollinger, an artist and illustrator.\n"}

Jamie Walters was not featured on the covers of any of the seasons that he regularly appeared in (although he did appear in some of the DVD menu still shots for seasons 5 and 6). Kathleen Robertson was only featured on the cover of the seventh season, even though she had been a regular since season 6, recurring in the entirety of season 5 and made her first appearance towards the end of season 4 (her photo was, however, used in one of the inner cases for the season 6 release).\n\nHilary Swank who was cast as a main star in the eighth season is featured on the cover of the DVD, even though she left halfway through her only season on the show, while Vincent Young, who joined the cast that same year, is not on the cover at all, or on the cover of the ninth season (he is, however, featured on the tenth season cover), but Lindsay Price, Vanessa Marcil and Luke Perry were all featured on the cover, as were Jason Priestley and Tiffani-Amber Thiessen who both departed the series after a few episodes. Daniel Cosgrove was not featured on the Season 9 cover either even though he was a regular also (he is featured on the season 10 cover).\n\nFor seasons 1-8, the DVDs were packaged in individual slim plastic cases which were then housed in a large outer cardboard box.

He was co-founder, with Prince Ouroussoff, of the Petrovsky Theatre, the first permanent opera theatre in Moscow and predecessor of the Bolshoi Theatre.\n\nDescribed as a famous equilibrist, Michael Maddox arrived first in Russia in 1766 as the manager of a museum of 'mechanical and physical representations', visiting both St Petersburg and Moscow. Leaving Russia he travelled to Madrid with his museum, and spent time in London in the ensuing decade. It is unclear whether he was related to Anthony Maddox, the successful slack-wire and theatre performer who drowned on a sea voyage to Dublin in 1758 along with Theophilus Cibber. There exists a possibility of confusion between the two with regard to references to equilibrism.\n\nOn returning to Russia before 1776, Michael Maddox was taken into partnership in the theatre company formed that year by the Moscow Prosecutor, Prince Pyotr Vasilyevich Ouroussoff. Maddox had had an established record of success at the Haymarket Theatre, London, where it is said that in 1770 his were the most prosperous entertainments ever carried on in that house. His profits in one season are stated to have amounted to £11,000, £2,500 more than David Garrick's a few years earlier.\n\nOuroussoff had been granted a ten-year licence for theatrical and other performances. For four years they enjoyed success in a wooden theatre at Znamenka Street, the Znamensky Theatre, before it burnt down in early 1780. Maddox then raised enough credit to buy his share of the company from Prince Ouroussoff and employ architect Christian Rosberg the same year to construct a new brick and stone building that faced Petrovka Street. It thus became known as the Petrovsky Theatre. The theatre had four storeys of boxes and two spacious galleries. The pit had two series of benches, with enclosed seats at the sides. The sumptuously decorated boxes were available to let at from three hundred to a thousand roubles and upwards. Admittance to the pit was one rouble.\n\nMaddox obtained a further ten-year licence from Moscow's Governor, Prince Dolgoruky-Krymsky, but financial difficulties meant that ownership of the theatre passed to the Office of Imperial Theatres in 1792. Empress Maria Feodorovna granted Maddox a life-long pension of 3,000 roubles for his contribution to the creation of Moscow theatre. The theatre was operational until 1805, when it burned down just before a performance of Ferdinand Kauer's \"Rusalka\". It was replaced by the Bolshoi Theatre on the same site.\n\n\"a. Petrovsky Theatre, including the extension which contained a rotunda.\"\n\n\"b. Interior of Rotunda/Masquerade hall.\" \"c. Interior of Theatre/Opera house\"\n\n\"d. Relative size and situation of Petrovsky theatre and Bolshoi.\" \"e. Plan of 2nd floor with rotunda and theatre.\"\n\nThe Maddox troupe delivered 425 performances of drama, ballet and opera during this time. These included more than 100 different operas, mainly of the comic opera/\"opéra comique\" type by composers such as Grétry, Dalayrac, Mehul, Paisiello, Philidor and Martin y Soler, as well as Russians such as Yevstigney Fomin and Vasily Pashkevich.\n\nThe foreign operas were largely performed in Russian translations by Sergey Glinka, Platon Levshin, Ivan Dmitrievsky, and others. Three notable melodramas (Fomin's \"Orfeo\" and G. A. Benda's \"Pygmalion\" and \"Medea & Jason\") were part of the repertoire.\nTheatre productions in Russian translation included Shakespeare's \"Romeo & Juliet\" and Voltaire's \"Mahomet\". The most successful works, however, were those of August von Kotzebue, such as \"Menschenhass und Reue\", \"The Papagoy\", and \"Armuth und Edelsinn\".\n\nMasquerades for 1,500 people or more, where carnival costume was compulsory, were held in the mirror-bedecked rotunda. This part of the structure alone had cost fifty thousand roubles to construct. William Tooke in the chapter \"Sketch of Mosco\" (sic) from his \"History of Russia\" describes the audience in the pit of the theatre as \"perhaps, in many respects, one of the most polite that can be anywhere seen. The ears are never rent with those noisy marks of disapprobation, which do not correct bad actors, and which distress and overpower the inexperienced and timid.\"\n\nFrom 1783, Maddox also created and ran a Vauxhall Gardens enterprise concurrently in the Moscow suburbs, where operas and plays were performed from mid-May to September. A long gallery led to a grand circular hall for dancing. From the dancing-hall there was a large area surrounded by a covered gallery, having in the middle an elevated platform for the orchestra. This gallery was chiefly used for promenading. Beyond this was a hall allotted to refreshments of all kinds. On the sides were billiards rooms. In the evenings the galleries were illuminated with coloured lamps, and on particular days fireworks displays were set off. It is likely that Maddox and his wife retained ownership of this after the Petrovsky was taken on by the Office of Imperial Theatres.\n\nMaddox manufactured a tower clock for Empress Catherine II of Russia, which is currently displayed in the Kremlin Armoury in Moscow.\n\nHe married a German woman from an aristocratic family and fathered eleven children, one of them the adventurer Roman Medoks. His wife survived him and continued with ownership of some theatrical buildings.\n\nThe suggestions that he was a Professor of Mathematics from Oxford University and that he had tutored the Tsarevich Pavel prior to moving to Moscow have not been substantiated.\n\nAlexander Chayanov, whose wife Olga wrote a book on the history of the Maddox Theatre, set a portion of his Gothic tale \"Venediktov\" in the theatre.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4674463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4674463", "title": "Nudity clause", "text": "Nudity clause\n\nA nudity clause is a paragraph or a section in a performer’s legal contract that stipulates which parts, if any, of the performer's body are to be exposed during a theatrical, television, cinematic, or other type of production. The clause may stipulate that a performer will not be required to perform in the nude, or it may specify that a performer is not allowed to perform in the nude. Nevertheless, a character they play may appear to be nude by the use of a \"body double\" in place of the performer during a nude scene or the use of a flesh-colored bodystocking or a pubic area-covering merkin. Sometimes a performer will refuse to accept a role which involves nudity.\n\nMost performing contracts stipulate which body parts may be used in the final product. This may, for example, be the back above the waist, include the buttocks, breasts, pubic hair, etc. They may also specify which parts cannot be shown - such as hands, neck, profile, etc. There are strict union guidelines around on-set nudity, which requires actors to be told of any nude scenes well in advance and nudity waivers require directors to itemize exactly what will be shown and how.\n\nAt times exposure of each body part is given a commercial value and open to negotiation. In 2001, Halle Berry appeared in the film \"Swordfish\", which featured her first nude scene. At first, she refused to be filmed topless in a sunbathing scene, but she changed her mind when Warner Brothers raised her fee substantially. The brief flash of her breasts reportedly added $500,000 to her fee. Berry, however, denied this, explaining that after turning down numerous roles that required nudity, she decided to make \"Swordfish\" because her husband, Eric Benét, supported her and encouraged her to take risks.\n\nEspecially when they are launching their careers, many female performers refuse roles that require them to perform nude, either for personal or professional reasons; companies such as Disney often go to great lengths to protect their performers' 'family friendly' image. 'No-nudity' clauses are relatively rare, in that an actress that is approached to perform such a role is usually at a stage in their career where a polite refusal is acceptable, and in most cases, body-doubles, body-stockings or other alternate options are available.\n\nSometimes it is the studios or production companies that insist that their actresses do not take part in nude scenes or other appearances. For example, to preserve her wholesome image, Annette Funicello, who was under contract with Walt Disney, was not allowed to be seen in a two-piece bathing suit or show her navel in the beach party films of the 1960s for American International Pictures; though the prohibition was not always followed.\n\nNo-nudity clauses have also forbidden cartoon characters from appearing nude. Pamela Anderson, for example, who appeared nude many times in print and in films, informed Reuters that she insisted on a no-nudity clause for her cartoon alter ego in \"Stripperella\", the adult animated series created by Stan Lee.\n\n"}

The film made its world premiere at the 29th Annecy International Animated Film Festival in Annecy, France, and won the Platinum Grand Prize at the Future Film Festival in Bologna, Italy. It was shown with the theatrical release of \"Cars\".\nThe short was written and directed by Andrew Jimenez and Mark Andrews and produced by Osnat Shurer, head of Pixar's Shorts group. The score for the short was written by Michael Giacchino. Like many Pixar shorts, the film is completely free of dialogue and vocal effects, instead using music (played by the characters) and pantomime to tell the story. Unlike most Pixar shorts, which are solely driven by storyboarding and scriptwriting, the music in \"One Man Band\" was developed directly alongside the film's story; Giacchino collaborated extensively with the film's directors due to the large role of music in the short.\n\nOn January 31, 2006 it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, but lost to \"\" by John Canemaker and Peggy Stern. It was included in the Animation Show of Shows in 2005.\n\nBass, a skilled and proud street performer, plays a routine tune in a deserted Italian village square in the afternoon, waiting for a pedestrian to tip him in his rusty iron cup. Soon, he spots Tippy, a humble peasant girl clutching a big gold coin, with the intention of dropping it in the plaza fountain to make a wish. Bass, seizing the opportunity, immediately plays an impromptu piece, capturing the young girl's attention. \n\nJust when Tippy is about to drop the coin into Bass's cup, a newcomer steps onto the scene. Treble, a suave and flamboyant street performer, plays a more attractive song, effectively stealing Tippy's attention, much to the anger of Bass. Not to be outdone, Bass ups his ante, with Treble daring to take it even further. As the two rivals unleash their arsenal of musical weapons, trying to vie for the attention (or rather, the tip) of Tippy, the girl cowers in their wild musical cacophony, and in the process, accidentally drops her sole gold coin, which falls down a drain and gets lost in the sewers of the village.\n\nHeartbroken, Tippy sniffles, but then angrily demands from Treble and Bass a replacement coin for the one they made her lose. When both musicians come up empty-handed, Tippy insists she take one of Treble's violins and Bass's iron cup in an attempt to get her money back by playing solo. She then tunes the violin and begins to play it like a true virtuoso, prompting a passing pedestrian to drop a large bag of gold coins onto her cup. \n\nElated, Tippy hugs the bag and approaches the fountain, but not before she pulls two coins out of her bag and tempts Treble and Bass. But as they eagerly reach out to grab them, she tosses the coins into the top of the fountain, out of reach, much to their dismay. A post-credits scene shows that it is now nighttime, with Treble standing on Bass, trying to reach for the coins in vain. As the two start to fall backwards, the film ends.\n\nBeginning development shortly after the completion of \"The Incredibles\", \"One Man Band\" was directed by Andrew Jiminez and Mark Andrews, who had previously worked together on films such as \"The Iron Giant\" and \"Spider-Man\". In late 2004, they were approached by Ed Catmull and asked to visit his office; according to the duo, they were initially concerned about the implications of this, but were later relieved after Catmull requested that they begin working on a brand new short film for Pixar. Jiminez and Andrews decided to create a film centered around music, a subject which they were both decidedly passionate about, and began developing a story about two musicians quarreling over the donation of a young peasant girl. The short was pitched to Pixar CEO John Lasseter and \"The Incredibles\" director Brad Bird, who quickly accepted the film for production.\n\nThe violinists featured in the score for the film are:\n\nThe score was recorded at the Paramount Scoring Stage in Hollywood, CA.

Until recently the board reported to the Minister of Consumer Services but as of 1 October 2015, the board is overseen by the Ontario Film Authority. The board's activities are based on the \"Film Classification Act, 2005\".\n\nA three-person Board of Censors was established on 27 June 1911 following passage of the \"Theatres and Cinematographs Act, 1911\". The initial members were Chair George E. Armstrong, Robert Wilson and Otter Elliott. From that point, films to be shown in Ontario legally required review and approval by the board. The Board's censorship authority included newsreels, for example footage from a 1937 General Motors strike was banned \"to avoid propaganda by either side.\"\n\nThe Board of Censors began to provide basic film classifications from 1 June 1946, initially as a year-long pilot project to designate certain films which were deemed inappropriate for children. Theatre operators were required to identify such films as \"adult entertainment\" on marquees and advertising. \"The Blue Dahlia\" and \"Her Kind of Man\" were among the first films to be identified as adult entertainment in Ontario.\n\nFurther changes to the \"Theatres Act\" in 1975 empowered what was now known as the Ontario Censor Board to review and censor videotapes and 8 mm film formats as well as conventional theatrical films. In the late 1970s and early 80s the Board was involved in a number of high-profile disputes with the Toronto International Film Festival (known then as the Festival of Festivals) over the Board's refusal to approve some films for screening without cuts, and for banning other films outright. In 1977, the board ordered cuts from the film \"Je, tu, il, elle\" which depicted two women having sex; the Festival pulled the film from its programme. In 1978, it demanded a 38-second cut from a love scene in \"In Praise of Older Women\"; director Robert Lantos agreed but at the last minute substituted the uncut version of the film. The screening was introduced by federal Secretary of State for Canada John Roberts who publicly denounced the board, telling the audience at the Elgin Theatre that “because of the actions of the Ontario censor it is time for an active affirmation that censors shouldn’t tell people what they should or should not see.” In 1982, the board refused to approve Pierre Rissient’s \"Cinq et la peau\"; instead of substituting another film, festival organizers protested the ban by posting a sign outside the theatre explaining why the screen was being kept dark.\n\nThe board's high profile actions against various films being screened at the festival had the unintended effect of raising their profile and audience interest. According to former festival director Helga Stephenson, “Silly old [Ontario Censor Board chairman] Mary Brown filled some theatres with some pretty tame stuff. The ranting and raving was a very good way to get the festival into the minds of the public, but internationally it was hugely embarrassing. And it filled the theatre with the wrong people, because they came looking for nothing but blow jobs, and they found themselves in the middle of a long, hard, boring film waiting for a few seconds of a grainy image showing something that looked vaguely like a male sex organ.”\n\nIn 1985, the name of the board was changed to the Ontario Film Review Board after the provincial government amended the \"Theatres Act\". The Board composition changed from full-time civil servants to part-time members of the public. In 1988 festival films became exempt from review by the board provided the audience was limited to those eighteen and over.\n\nIn 2005 the original and much amended Theatres Act was replaced by the \"Film Classification Act\"\n\nIn 2013 the Ontario Film Authority was incorporated. It entered into an agreement with the Minister of Consumer Services dated 5 May 2014. On 1 October 2015, an amendment to Ontario Regulation 187/09 came into effect, providing that the Ontario Film Authority is the sole administrative authority for the purpose of administering all provisions of the \"Film Classification Act, 2005\" and the regulations made under that Act.\n\nThis restructuring of administrative oversight in 2015 was \"part of a larger provincial initiative to streamline more than 200 boards and commissions\", according to \"The Toronto Star\".\n\nSignificant cases have occurred where a film was either banned outright in Ontario, or certain scenes were ordered removed:\n\n\nSeveral sources claim the Board banned the NFB anti-pornography documentary \"Not a Love Story.\" The Board was asked to rate this film, along with three others, submitted by a group of artists, known as the Ontario Film and Video Appreciation Society (OFVAS). The Board refused to view or rate \"Not a Love Story\" on the grounds that OFVAS did not own the film or have any distribution rights. Ratings were provided on the other films. The artists then took the Board to court over the ratings given, and the refusal to rate \"Not a Love Story.\" The Board's actions were challenged under the new Canadian Constitution.\n\nThe Ontario Divisional Court ruled in 1983 that film classification and censorship were justifiable under the Constitution. The court also determined that three of the Board's rulings were valid. Approval with time and place restrictions in the case of \"The Art of Worldly Wisdom\" and \"Rameau's Nephew\" was considered a \"valid exercise of the Board's power.\" The Board's refusal to review \"Not A Love Story: A Film About Pornography\" was acceptable as the Board did not need to perform hypothetical reviews. The film had not been submitted for commercial distribution, and the judge noted \"the applicants were seeking permission to show a film they did not own and which they had no right to exhibit.\" Concerning the Board's ban of the fourth film, \"Amerika\", the court ruled that the Board had no legally defined rights to determine what the public could view. The government appealed to the Ontario Supreme Court, but the appeal was dismissed in 1984. The government subsequently added regulations to define the Board`s powers.\n\nThe board uses the following motion picture rating system for theatrical releases in the province:\n\nRatings used from 1946 - 1953:\n\nRatings used from - 1986:\n\nRatings used from 1986 - 2003:\n\nThe ratings used from 2003–present:\n\nThese ratings include a set of Content Advisories:\n\n\nThe primary reason for the addition of the 18A category was films such as \"Scary Movie\" and \"\".\n\nAdult movies are given a sticker which denotes:\n\nJanet Robinson is the board's current Chair. The longest-serving chair was O. J. Silverthorne, who retired from that position after 40 years. The following people were appointed as Chair of the Board of Censors, and subsequently the Ontario Film Review Board.\n\n\n"}

Players have the option to play as a Rabbid or as Rayman, who has disguised himself as a Rabbid to infiltrate their plans. The game features 54 minigames. This is the first Rayman game to have an E10+ rating by the ESRB, a greater emphasis on simultaneous multiplayer gameplay compared to the original game, and online leaderboards. It is followed by \"\".\n\nMinigames in Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 are played by entering a mode known as 'Trips', which is divided into five regions of the Earth: USA, Europe, Asia, South America, and Tropics. Each region has 9 minigames, 5 of which are randomly chosen each time the player begins a trip. Completing a trip unlocks those minigames, which can later be played individually through Free Play mode. Additionally, players can use a Trip Customization mode to create their own trips using the available minigames.\n\nRayman Raving Rabbids 2 features a wide variety of minigames that focus on different themes and use different control schemes. In rhythm music games, players use selective instruments (singing, guitar, drum, keyboard, etc.) to perform as part of a Rabbid band. Each minigame can be played with up to four players at once, as either Rabbids or Rayman.\n\nShooting games, which in the first Rayman Raving Rabbids were scattered among the regular levels, have now been moved to a separate area called the Shooting Arcade, where they can be played after completion of Trips. These first-person rail shooter games utilize real footage of locations around the world with Rabbids digitally inserted. As with other games in the Raving Rabbids series, plungers serve a primary role as ammunition.\n\nThe game has been released on the Wii and Nintendo DS. PC versions exist, but are available only in Russia, Poland & China. In the Russian version there are only 16 mini-games. In the Poland & China version there are 4 parts of 16 mini-games (4 mini-games in one part).\n\n\"Raving Rabbids 2\" features an ability to create both custom Rayman outfits as well as custom Rabbids. These outfits are often parodies or references to famous movie or video game characters, including Indiana Jones, Spider-Man, Superman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Sam Fisher, Ken Masters from Street Fighter, a Mantel Trooper from the PlayStation 3 game Haze, Sailor Moon, , a Krusty Krew hat from the TV series SpongeBob SquarePants, Friday the 13th and the Altair costume from another Ubisoft game, Assassin's Creed that often referred by fans as \"The Bunny Creed\".\n\nRayman and the Rabbids return in this game. Players take the role of Rayman in Trips mode, and have the option of playing as either Rayman or a Rabbid in Free Play mode. It is possible to unlock costumes for both Rayman and Rabbids by completing high scores in both minigames and shooting games, or by shooting a specific Rabbid in each shooting game. Occasionally, when the player beats a high score, a new Rabbid will join their party as a play-and-customizable character.\n\nThe game starts with Rayman infiltrating a mall overrun by Rabbids. As he's about to sneak in, he disguises himself wearing two socks on his head, a headband, two makeshift eyes, and inhaling helium into his lungs (in order to disguise his voice, thus blending in more with the other Rabbids). He then picks up a soda can and throws it to distract two guard Rabbids and steals one of their plungers. Rayman climbs to the roof of the facility and peers through a skylight, where he observes the Rabbids watching a montage of everyday human life. Seconds later, one of the Rabbids jerks its head, noticing Rayman's presence. Accidentally, he falls into the mall and is spotted. A Rabbid with split color eyes (also known as Professor Barranco 3) walks up to him and whips out a European Wii copy of the first Raving Rabbids game. Taking a look at the cover, it seems to recognize Rayman. Thinking quickly, Rayman screams \"BWAAAAAAAAH!\", convincing the Rabbids that he is one of their own. Rayman and the Rabbids are then led into an airborne submarine, taking him to a location for invasion.\n\nThe Nintendo DS version of the game features a similar storyline with a few differences. The Wii version shows how Rayman invades the Rabbids HQ in disguise, while the DS storyline explains how Rayman followed the Rabbids to Earth and learns on how the Rabbids plan to act like humans. He then decides to help the humans by following the Rabbids on each area of the world (i.e. USA, Europe, Asia, etc.) by collecting information and evidence on the Rabbids antics and behavior which he then gives the info to the humans to help prevent any more Rabbid attacks in the future at the end of story mode, which happened again, while remarking on how the Rabbids are too stupid to properly understand the world and human behavior.\n\nThe original teaser trailer is a parody of the trailer for the 2007 Transformers film. As with other games in the \"Raving Rabbids\" series, Ubisoft released a number of humorous promotional videos entitled \"Around the World\", featuring Rabbids in a number of locations such as Japan; France; and Leipzig, Germany. Featuring the music of Around the World by Daft Punk.\n\n\"Rayman Raving Rabbids 2\" received mixed to positive reviews as well as slightly less praise in comparison to its predecessor, with a 68% GameRankings average (\"Rayman Raving Rabbids\" had a 76% GameRankings average). IGN dismissed the game as disappointing, as they felt the core games were less enjoyable than those in the first. GameSpot stated that despite not being nearly as captivating as the first game, it also has its quality moments.\nThe following ratings were delivered for the game:\n\n"}

The company was established in 1988 as Imagexcel, and became part of GameTek's Alternative Reality Technology (ART) subsidiary in March 1995. The studio was acquired by Take-Two Interactive in July 1997, as part of ART being sold off, and became part of Take-Two Interactive's Rockstar Games label in 1999 as Rockstar Canada. In August 2002, the company was renamed Rockstar Toronto to avoid confusion with the newly-acquired Rockstar Vancouver.\n\nRockstar Toronto has primarily been a porting house for games developed by other subsidiaries of Rockstar Games, but also developed the 2005 game \"The Warriors\", based on the 1979 film of the same name, and co-developed \"Max Payne 3\", as part of Rockstar Studios, in 2011. Following the release of \"Max Payne 3\", Rockstar Vancouver was folded and merged into Rockstar Toronto, with the resulting company moving into new, bigger offices.\n\nImagexcel was founded around 1988, as a sister company to Gray Matter. Under that name, the company produced games such as \"Techno Cop\" (1988) and \"The Ultimate Ride\" (1990), together with Gray Matter, with their final game under the Imagexcel having been \"Quarantine\" (1994).\n\nOn 9 March 1995, the company was announced to have been acquired by Alternative Reality Technology (ART), a subsidiary of GameTek, becoming GameTek Canada. The acquisition was completed by 7 April 1995. As part of ART, the company developed \"\", which was released in 1996, and \"Dark Colony\", which was released in 1997. On 31 July 1997, Take-Two Interactive announced that they had acquired several assets from GameTek, including ART with GameTek Canada, GameTek's European offices, and distribution rights to GameTek's \"Dark Colony\", \"Jeopardy!\" and \"Wheel of Fortune\" games.\n\nIn early 1999, GameTek Canada was merged out of ART and was turned into Rockstar Canada, a new studio in Take-Two Interactive's newly-established Rockstar Games label. Although their first duties covered creating two \"Grand Theft Auto\" expansion packs, \"\" and \"\", their primary tasks later became ports of titles published by Rockstar Games to PlayStation 2, that being \"Oni\" (2001) and \"Max Payne\" (2001).\n\nOn 1 August 2002, Take-Two Interactive announced the acquisition of Barking Dog Studios, which would be renamed Rockstar Vancouver. As part of the acquisition, Rockstar Canada would be renamed Rockstar Toronto to avoid confusion between the two. Alongside the acquisition, Take-Two Interactive announced that the now-renamed Rockstar Toronto was working on a video game adaptation of the 1979 Walter Hill-directed film \"The Warriors\". The eponymous game was first shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in May 2005, and released in October that year. The game was well received, and a PlayStation Portable conversion of it was developed by Rockstar Toronto in conjunction with Rockstar Leeds. A spiritual successor to \"The Warriors\", tentatively titled \"We Are the Mods\", was originally planned, but cancelled.\n\nFollowing the release of \"The Warriors\", Rockstar Toronto returned to being mostly a porting house, though instead of PlayStation 2, the focus shifted to Wii, porting \"Manhunt 2\" (2007) and \"\" (2008), and later to Microsoft Windows, porting \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" (2008, in association with Rockstar New England) and \"\" (2010, comprising the two 2009-released \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" expoansions packs, \"\" and \"\"). In September 2008, Rockstar Toronto was rumoured to be working on a third instalment in the \"Max Payne\" series. In November 2010, Rockstar Toronto teasted to be working on next-generation games. The company proceeded to collaborate with all other Rockstar Games subsidiaries, collectively referred to as Rockstar Studios, on \"Max Payne 3\" (2012), and ported the game Microsoft Windows and macOS.\n\nOn 9 July 2012, two months after the release of \"Max Payne 3\", Rockstar Games announced that Rockstar Toronto would be moving into a new, bigger, and custom-built studio within their Oakville, Ontario location, into which Rockstar Vancouver would be merged, effectively closing it and disbanding the \"Rockstar Vancouver\" name. All of Rockstar Vancouver's 35 employees at the time were given the posibility to move to the newly-expanded Rockstar Toronto, or any other Rockstar Games studio. The expansion and move was partially financed by the Government of Ontario. Jennifer Kolbe, vice-president of publishing and operations at Rockstar Games, stated that the move intended to make a single Canadian team that \"will make for a powerful creative force on future projects\", and aimed at making room for 50 new positions at the company. On 22 November 2012, the company was legally renamed from Rockstar Toronto Inc., over Rockstar Games Toronto Inc., to Rockstar Games Toronto ULC, as such becoming an unlimited liability corporation under the laws of British Columbia.\n\nBy July 2013, job postings again started teasing next-generation development at Rockstar Toronto. The studio has most recently assisted Rockstar North on developing \"Grand Theft Auto V\", which first released in September 2013, as well as handling its Microsoft Windows port, which released in April 2015. For the Microsoft Windows versions of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and \"Grand Theft Auto V\", respectively, Rockstar Toronto developed a built-in video editor for footage captured in-game.

{"id": "14443840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14443840", "title": "Ronald McDonald", "text": "Ronald McDonald\n\nRonald McDonald is a clown character used as the primary mascot of the McDonald's fast-food restaurant chain. In television commercials, the clown inhabited a fantasy world called McDonaldland and has adventures with his friends Mayor McCheese, the Hamburglar, Grimace, Birdie the Early Bird, and The Fry Kids. Since 2003, McDonaldland has been largely phased out, and Ronald is instead shown interacting with normal children in their everyday lives.\n\nMany people work full-time making appearances in the Ronald McDonald costume, visiting children in hospitals and attending regular events. At its height there may have been as many as 300 full-time clowns at McDonald's. There are also Ronald McDonald Houses where parents can stay overnight when visiting sick children in nearby chronic care facilities.\n\nThe origin of Ronald McDonald involves Willard Scott (at the time, a local radio personality who also played Bozo the Clown on WRC-TV in Washington, D.C. from 1959 until 1962), who performed using the moniker \"Ronald McDonald, the Hamburger-Happy Clown\" in 1963 on three separate television spots. These were the first three television ads featuring the character.\n\nScott, who went on to become NBC-TV's \"Today Show\" weatherman, claims to have \"created Ronald McDonald\" according to the following excerpt from his book \"Joy of Living\":\n\nAt the time, Scott was working for Oscar Goldstein, the Washington DC area McDonald's franchisee, and numerous sources describe Scott's role as only playing the part of Ronald McDonald, while giving credit for the creation of the mascot to Goldstein and his ad agency.\n\n McDonald's does not mention George Voorhis or acknowledge that Willard Scott created Ronald in their statement:\nOn March 28, 2000, Henry Gonzalez, McDonald's Northeast Division President, thanked Scott for creating Ronald McDonald, during a taped tribute to Scott on the \"Today Show\". Yet\nin 1965, Roy Burgold assigned Aye Jaye as Boss Clown worldwide in charge of hiring, writing, creating shows, media handling, training, and major events such as The White House appearances, Macy Days, etc., and finally opening Ronald worldwide for 35 years. Aye Jaye was responsible for the hiring of hundreds of past field Ronalds.\n\nCircus performer Coco the Clown (real name Michael Polakovs) was hired in 1966 to revamp Ronald's image, and he created the now familiar costume and make-up.\n\nIn 2010, the Corporate Accountability International in Boston, Massachusetts suggested Ronald McDonald should retire due to childhood obesity, however McDonald's CEO Jim Skinner said there are no plans to retire him.\n\nIn April 2011, McDonald's announced that Ronald McDonald will re-appear in their commercials. However, Ace Metrix says Ronald McDonald ads are no longer effective. On May 18, 2011, Corporate Accountability International renewed their call to retire Ronald McDonald, by running ads in major newspapers and launching several web pages dedicated to the retirement of the character. However, McDonald's CEO Jim Skinner defended Ronald McDonald by saying that he is an ambassador for good and \"it's all about choice\". Shortly after McDonald's Website News Statements announced that Ronald McDonald is here to stay. In April 2014, McDonald's announced that Ronald McDonald will have a whole new look and new outfits. They also announced that he will be back in their new commercials as well as on social media sites like Twitter. As part of Ronald's makeover, his jumpsuit has been dropped in favor of yellow cargo pants, a vest, and a red-and-white striped rugby shirt. His classic clown shoes remain part of the official uniform.\n\nAt any given time, there are dozens to hundreds of actors retained by McDonald's to appear as Ronald McDonald in restaurants and events. It is assumed, however, that the company uses only one actor at a time to play the character in national television commercials. Following is a list of primary American Ronald McDonald actors.\n\nVarious forms of the name \"Ronald McDonald\" as well as costume clown face persona, etc. are registered trademarks of McDonald's. McDonald's trains performers to portray Ronald using identical mannerisms and costume, to contribute to the illusion that they are one character.\n\nMcDonald's marketing designers and stylists changed elements of the Ronald McDonald character, persona, style, costume, and clown face when they adopted the clown as a trademark.\n\nIn Thailand, Ronald McDonald greets people in the traditional Thai \"wai\" greeting gesture of both hands pressed together. The Thai version of the company mascot was created in 2002 by the local Thai franchise, McThai, as part of a \"McThai in the Thai Spirit\" campaign. The figure has also been exported to India and other countries where a similar gesture is used. In China, out of respect for Ronald McDonald as an adult, children refer to him as 麦当劳叔叔 (Uncle McDonald). In Japan, Ronald McDonald is called Donald McDonald due to a lack of a clear \"r\" sound in Japanese enunciation.\n\nCharlton Comics obtained the license to publish four issues of a Ronald comic sold on newsstands in 1970–1971. Over the years several giveaway comics have also been produced starring the character.\n\nRonald (with Grimace) appeared in the 1984 Little Golden Book \"Ronald McDonald and the Tale of the Talking Plant\" which was written by John Albano and illustrated by John Costanza.\n\nIn 1991, Ronald appears in the \"Discover the Rainforest\" activity book series consisting of \"Paint It Wild: Paint & See Activity Book\", \"Sticker Safari: Sticker and Activity Book\", \"Wonders in the Wild: Activity Book\", and \"Ronald McDonald and the Jewel of the Amazon Kingdom: Storybook\", which are written by Mike Roberts and Russell Mittermeier, Gad Meiron, and Randall Stone, and illustrated by Donna Reynolds and Tim Racer, in which he is seen here as a nature show host and tour guide. \n\nIn 1989, a 40-minute animated direct-to-video film titled \"The Adventures of Ronald McDonald: McTreasure Island\" and produced by DIC Entertainment was released on VHS by Hi-Tops Video. \n\nFrom 1998 until 2003 a series of direct-to-video animated episodes titled \"The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald\" and produced by Klasky Csupo were released in participating McDonald's worldwide on VHS.\n\nRonald McDonald is the protagonist of two video games: \"McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure\", developed by Treasure for the Mega Drive console and released in 1993, and \"Ronald McDonald in Magical World\", developed by SIMS for the Game Gear handheld, released only in Japan in 1994. Ronald McDonald is also featured in two more video games: \"M.C. Kids\" for NES, Game Boy, C64, Amiga, Atari ST, and MS-DOS; and \"Global Gladiators\" for Genesis, Master System, Game Gear and Amiga.\n\nRonald McDonald appears for a few seconds in the 1988 film \"Mac and Me\" during a birthday scene set at a McDonald's. He is played by Squire Fridell, but is credited as \"Ronald McDonald as himself\". He won a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst New Star for his appearance in the film. \n\nBecause of his prominence, Ronald McDonald has become a symbol not just of McDonald's but of the fast food industry in the USA as a whole, as well as Corporate America, capitalism, globalization, and other broader topics. As such, the costume and iconography of Ronald McDonald is often appropriated by protestors and artists wishing to subvert the icon and communicate a message that runs counter to the corporate narrative. For example, in 2000, protestors in Hong Kong dressed as Ronald McDonald to protest McDonald's labor policy in China.\n\nCritics have claimed that a clown mascot targeting children for fast food is unethical. A group of 550 doctors took out newspaper ads in 2011 demanding Ronald McDonald's retirement. In 2010, the Corporate Accountability International in Boston, Massachusetts suggested that Ronald McDonald should be retired due to childhood obesity in the United States; however, then McDonald's CEO Jim Skinner said there were no plans to retire the character.\n\nOn May 18, 2011, Corporate Accountability International renewed their call to retire Ronald McDonald, by running ads in major newspapers and launching several web pages dedicated to the retirement of the character. McDonald's CEO Jim Skinner defended Ronald McDonald by saying that he is an ambassador for good and \"it's all about choice\".\n\nShortly afterwards, McDonald's Website News Statements announced that Ronald McDonald is here to stay. In 2014, McDonald's new CEO Don Thompson said that Ronald McDonald does not encourage kids to eat unhealthy foods. He stated Ronald McDonald only spreads joy and smiles. The Corporate Accountability International failed to retire him due to the fact that he is a national icon and has been around for half a century.\n\n"}

It is an agency of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation and operates the Berlin Musical Instrument Museum.\n\nThe current Institute is a direct descendant of several institutions of the former Kingdom of Prussia. In 1888, a formalized collection of ancient musical instruments was established at the Prussian Royal Academy of Music. By 1902, the collection had grown substantially through the financial support of Wilhelm II. In 1919 Curt Sachs, one of the founders of the field of organology (the study of musical instruments), was appointed the first Director of the instrument collection. In 1917, an Institute for Musicological Research was also founded under the patronage of Prince Adolf of Schaumburg-Lippe in Bückeburg.\n\nAt the start of the Third Reich in 1933, Sachs was dismissed and forced to emigrate by the Nazi Party. In 1935 a new National Institute for German Music Research was founded in Berlin, led by Max Seiffert, incorporating the old Royal College and the Bückeburg Institute. World War II then saw the nearly complete destruction of the Institute and the Museum. In 1943, the instruments, scores and library collections were evacuated from Berlin to protect them from Allied bombing. Despite extensive security, the majority were lost. In January 1945, \"by Decree of the Reich Minister for Science, Education and Education\", the Institute was closed. At war's end, only 700 of the original 4,000 musical instruments survived.\n\nAfter the war, what remained of the Institute came under the direct control of the West Berlin city government and a painstaking reconstruction began, with a focus on the valuable instruments collection. In 1949 it was given accommodations at Charlottenburg Palace. On the 200th anniversary of Johann Sebastian Bach's death in 1950, the Institute held the first chamber music concert on historic instruments. In 1962 the Institute came under the administration of the newly created Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, and the Department for Musical Acoustics was established in 1965 through a grant from the Fritz Thyssen Foundation. A ceremony was held to lay the foundation stone for the Institute's current building in 1979 on the Kulturforum, which opened to the public in 1984.\n\nThe Berlin Musical Instrument Museum or \"MIM\" collects instruments from the European art music school from the 16th to the 21st century. It holds about 3,200 instruments, of which 800 can be seen on permanent display. Those that are playable are played regularly. It is one of the most representative collections in Germany in its diversity. The museum also operates a restoration workshop and has its own concert hall with an active program of chamber concerts.\n\nThis department conducts large-scale research projects in the fields of Music Theory and Music History from antiquity to the present. It also operates the Institute's library with a special focus on organology and the Second Viennese School. It also manages the German National contribution to the RILM Abstract of Music Literature. Bibliographical work of the Institute is currently organized in the form of interactive database \nBMS \"online\".\n\nThis Department researches Recording studio technology, services the Institute's Electronic equipment, and manages the full digitization its resources. One major project captures the sounds of the historic musical instruments in the Museum systematically and them develops mathematical models to describe them. Recordings from concerts at the Museum are also part of the tasks of the Department. Digital recording studio space allows it to create high-quality master CDs in-house.\n\n"}

{"id": "24295276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24295276", "title": "The Flash (comic book)", "text": "The Flash (comic book)\n\nThe Flash is an ongoing American comic book series featuring the DC Comics superhero of the same name. The character's first incarnation, Jay Garrick, first appeared in \"Flash Comics\" #1. When the Silver Age Flash Barry Allen was introduced, that character took over \"Flash Comics\" numbering and the series was retitled as \"The Flash\".\n\nAlthough the Flash is a mainstay in the DC Comics stable, the series has been canceled and rebooted eight times. The first series featuring Barry Allen was canceled at issue #350 in the event of the character's death in the universe altering event \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\". When Wally West succeeded Allen as the Flash, a new series began with new numbering in June 1987. That series was briefly canceled in 2006 in the wake of the \"Infinite Crisis\" event, but was restarted with its original numbering in 2007, only to be canceled again in 2008 in the wake of Barry Allen's return in \"Final Crisis\" and \"\". The series was revived for a third volume by writer Geoff Johns and artist Francis Manapul after the completion of the \"Blackest Night\" event in 2010. A fourth volume was launched in 2011 as part of The New 52. A fifth volume was launched in 2016 as part of DC Rebirth.\n\nVolume 1 starred Barry Allen as the Flash and the series assumed the numbering of the original \"Flash Comics\" with issue #105 (March 1959) written by John Broome and drawn by Carmine Infantino. Comics historian Les Daniels noted that \"The Flash\" was a streamlined, modernized version of much that had gone before, but done with such care and flair that the character seemed new to a new generation of fans. The Broome and Infantino collaboration saw the introduction of several supervillains many of whom became part of the Rogues. The Mirror Master first appeared in issue #105 and the following issue saw the debuts of Gorilla Grodd and the Pied Piper. Captain Boomerang first challenged the Flash in issue #117 (December 1960) and the 64th century villain Abra Kadabra was introduced in issue #128 (May 1962). Another villain from the future, Professor Zoom first appeared in issue #139 (September 1963).\n\nKid Flash and the Elongated Man were respectively introduced in issues #110 and 112 as allies of the Flash. One of the most notable issues of this era was issue #123 (September 1961), which featured the story titled \"Flash of Two Worlds\". In it, Allen meets his inspiration Jay Garrick, after accidentally being transported to a parallel universe where Garrick existed. In this previous continuity, Garrick and the other characters of the Golden Age only existed as comics characters in the mainline shared universe. This brought about a new concept in the formative stage of what would become the DC Universe, and gave birth to the current conceptualization featuring it as a multiverse.\n\nBarry Allen married his longtime love interest Iris West in issue #165 (November 1966).\nInfantino's last issue was #174 (November 1967) and the next issue saw Ross Andru become the new artist of the series as well as featuring the second race between the Flash and Superman, two characters known for their super-speed powers.\n\nThe series presented metafictional stories featuring comics creators appearing within the Flash's adventures such as the \"Flash — Fact Or Fiction\" in issue #179 in which the Flash finds himself on \"Earth Prime\". He contacts the \"one man on Earth who might believe his fantastic story and give him the money he needs. The editor of that \"Flash\" comic mag !\" Julius Schwartz helps the Flash build a cosmic treadmill so that he can return home. Several years later, the series' longtime writer Cary Bates wrote himself into the story in issue #228. Four months after the cancellation of his own title, Green Lantern began a backup feature in \"The Flash\" #217 (Aug.-Sept. 1972) and appeared in most issues through \"The Flash\" #246 (Jan. 1977) until his own solo series was revived. Schwartz, who had edited the title since 1959, left the series as of issue #269 (January 1979).\nBates wrote \"The Flash\" #275 (July 1979) wherein the title character's wife, Iris West Allen was killed. Don Heck became the artist of the series with issue #280 (Dec. 1979) and drew it until #295 (March 1981). \"The Flash\" #300 (Aug. 1981) was in the Dollar Comics format and featured a story by Bates and Infantino. Doctor Fate was featured in a series of back-up stories in \"The Flash\" from #306 (Feb. 1982) to #313 (Sept. 1982) written by Martin Pasko and Steve Gerber and drawn by Keith Giffen. A major shakeup occurred in the title in the mid-1980s. The Flash inadvertently kills his wife's murderer, the Reverse-Flash, in \"The Flash\" #324 (Aug. 1983). This led to an extended storyline titled \"The Trial of the Flash\" in which the hero must face the repercussions of his actions. Bates became the editor as well as the writer of \"The Flash\" title during this time and oversaw it until its cancellation in 1985. \"The Trial of the Flash\" was collected in a volume of the \"Showcase Presents\" series in 2011.\n\nShortly before Barry Allen's death in \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", the series was cancelled with issue #350 (October 1985). In the final issue of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", Wally West, previously known as Allen's sidekick Kid Flash, stated his intent to take up his uncle's mantle as the Flash.\n\nFeaturing Wally West as the main character, the Flash mostly operated out of Keystone City. The second series was launched by writer Mike Baron and artist Jackson Guice in June 1987. Featuring long runs most notably by writers Mark Waid and Geoff Johns, the second volume originally went in a different direction from the series starring Barry Allen by making Wally West more flawed. This Flash could not constantly maintain his super-speed because of his hypermetabolism, and would consume gargantuan amounts of food in order to continue operating at top speed. This metabolic limitation would later be continued into Barry Allen's character for the brief television series \"The Flash\" broadcast in 1990-91, as well as \"The Flash\" series which debuted in 2014, though to a lesser degree.\n\nMark Waid's tenure on the title in the 1990s brought back more traditional Flash aspects from Barry Allen's era by reforming the Rogues, some of which were new incarnations of old characters, and bringing more of a sci-fi/fantasy aspect that had been lost in Flash titles since Allen's departure. Waid made Wally West much more powerful in an attempt to take him out of Barry Allen and Jay Garrick's shadows. Waid and artist Mike Wieringo introduced Impulse in issue #92 (July 1994). Wally West married Linda Park in issue #142 (October 1998).\n\nWhen writer Geoff Johns stepped aboard with issue #164 (September 2000), he refocused the character on some of the Silver Age aspects by spending single issues on building the psychology of the various Rogues. Johns created Zoom, the third of the Reverse-Flashes, and fleshed out the environmental character of Keystone City in an attempt to make it unique in comparison to other fictional DC cities such as Metropolis or Gotham City.\n\nIn the wake of the \"One Year Later\" event and Wally West's disappearance in \"Infinite Crisis\", DC canceled \"The Flash\" vol. 2 with issue #230 (March 2006) in favor of a new series starring Bart Allen as the Flash. The new series, titled \"The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive\", ran only 13 issues and ended with Bart's death. Mark Waid returned to the title briefly in 2007 with the series resuming with #231 to bring about the return of Wally West but the series was canceled again at issue #247 in late 2008 with the return of Barry Allen in the event series \"Final Crisis\". Spinning out of \"Final Crisis\", writer Geoff Johns and artist Ethan Van Sciver created \"\", a 6-issue mini-series bringing Barry Allen back to a leading role in the DC Universe as the primary Flash. Barry Allen is also an integral character in the crossover event \"Blackest Night\", and had a self-titled limited series tying into the main event.\n\nIn 2010, DC Comics announced that after the completion of \"The Flash: Rebirth\" and \"Blackest Night\", Geoff Johns would return to writing a new \"Flash\" ongoing series with artist Francis Manapul. In January 2010, DC Comics announced that the series' opening arc would be launched under the banner of \"Brightest Day\", a line-wide aftermath story to the crossover \"Blackest Night\". In April 2010, DC released \"The Flash: Secret Files and Origins 2010\" one-shot, setting the stage for the status quo of the new series. It was followed one week later with the release of \"The Flash\" vol. 3 #1. On June 1, 2011, it was announced that all series taking place within the shared DC Universe would be either canceled or relaunched with new #1 issues, after a new continuity was created in the wake of the \"Flashpoint\" event. \"The Flash\" was no exception, and the first issue of the new series was released on September 2011.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, DC Comics relaunched \"The Flash\" with issue #1, with writing and art handled by Francis Manapul and Brian Buccellato. As with all of the titles associated with the DC relaunch, Barry Allen appears to be about five years younger than the previous incarnation of the character. Superheroes at large have appeared only in the past five years, and are viewed with at best, suspicion, and at worst, outright hostility. In this new continuity, Barry's marriage to Iris West never took place, and he is instead in a relationship with longtime co-worker Patty Spivot. In this new series, the Flash draws deeper into the Speed Force, enhancing his mental abilities while still trying to get a full grasp on his powers, which he doesn't yet exert total control over.\n\nAs revealed in issue #0 of this series, Barry Allen's father was placed in prison for the murder of his mother. While the evidence seems to indicate his father's guilt, Barry makes proving his father's innocence a priority. The murder occurred shortly after Barry returned victorious from a school spelling bee, and Barry placed the trophy he won on his mother's grave in her memory. Barry is also part of the main cast of the relaunched \"Justice League\" series, making his debut in the series' second issue.\n\nWriters Robert Venditti and Van Jensen and artist Brett Booth became the new creative team on \"The Flash\" as of issue #30 (June 2014).\n\nDuring DC Rebirth, Barry is no longer the only Flash. It is revealed that Wally West has been lost in the Speed Force for ten years, realizing during this time that Barry is not responsible of changing the timeline after the Flashpoint crisis, the unknown entity used Barry's time travelling as an opportunity to fundamentally alter reality. The fallout of the recent Darkseid War allowed Wally to try and reach out to his former friends in the hopes of either returning or warning them of the truth, but each attempt caused him to fall further into the Speed Force. After realizing not even Linda (his traditional \"lightning rod\") could remember him, Wally sank into desolation and chose to appear before Barry one last time to thank him for the life he had given him. Just before Wally disappeared, Barry remembered him and dragged him free of the Speed Force. Following a tearful reunion, Wally gave Barry his warning of the true source of the universal change and the dangers to come. Because of Wally, Barry is now aware that the timeline is not reset correctly after Flashpoint and thus another alternate timeline. However, he still cannot remember his pre-Flashpoint life, such as people like Jay Garrick and the details of his feuds with the Reverse-Flash / Eobard Thawne (who now remembers their pre-Flashpoint history), and remembers Wally from their new DC Rebirth timeline history. Despite being informed by Wally that another party is responsible, Barry remains in guilt over his mistakes, and seeks to find and stop them in hopes of making amends.Although the two decide to keep Wally's return secret from Iris based on Wally's own experience with Linda, Barry encourages him to return to the Teen Titans, but also recommends that he don a new costume to reflect that he is the Flash rather than 'Kid Flash'. While Wally considers his options, Barry visits Batman to discuss the new evidence of some outside force attacking them, musing on how personal this assault appears, but despite the potential danger, Batman and Barry agree to keep their investigation to themselves until they know what they are up against.\n\n\n\"Silver Age Omnibus\" Releases\n\n\nOmnibus Releases\n\n"}

It was produced by The Van Beuren Corporation, and released by Pathe, a film distributor which had the newsreel Pathe News. \n\nThe film was also part of the early sound cartoon series entitled \"Aesop's Sound Fables\". However, although the film is part of that-said series, the film is actually not based on a fable written by Aesop. Another abnormality with this film is that although it was released in 1930, the copyright notice on the actual film reads in roman numerals MCMXXIX, which translates to 1929.\n\nThe film begins with a male cat walking down the street singing and playing a musicbox. He then descends onto a neighborhood. He plays there until Farmer Al Falfa, a recurring character in the Aesop series, looks out of his window, and describes the music as \"rotten\". He then gets out of his house, and asks the cat to leave. He compiles, by running off the screen. The farmer, then chases a pair of chickens, who were there when the cat first descended onto the neighborhood. They then fly up onto a branch of a tree. Once up there, one chicken lays an egg and flings it at the farmer. The farmer, for retaliation, acquires a saw, and climbs up the tree, nearly falling off it whilst climbing. Once at the same level as the chickens, he brings out his saw and begins to cut. As soon as they realise that the farmer is cutting off an individual branch, which would make the farmer fall off the tree. The chickens retreat to the trunk of the tree. However, the tree branch comically stays standing, whilst the rest of the tree collapses. The farmer then descends from the branch to the ground. However, the branch hits him and the animals, who were watching the ordeal, starts to laugh at him. The farmer then returns home. Once he is back home and sitting on the stair leading to his front door, the postal service arrives with a package which is delivered via a horse drawn carriage. That package is an machine, an iron man. Once the farmer opens up the package. The robot starts to dance, with the farmer following along. During the dance, the robot kicks the farmer. So, in retaliation, the farmer kicks the robot back. This causes the robot to malfunction, by gradually increasing in size, until it is bigger than the Earth. The robot then explodes. The farmer then laughs at the animals. Until, the debris comically falls from space and reassembles the robot. Both the farmer and the animals run from the robot in the closing shot of the cartoon.\n\nThe film ends with a moral, which is portrayed with a duck and a sleeping Milton Mouse, the only time he is featured in this cartoon. The duck states that, \"An oyster is a fish dressed up like a nut\". The duck's statement wakes up the sleeping mouse. The duck then tugs at the mouse's fishing pole, mistaking Milton that he has caught a fish. Milton proceeds to pull at the pole, which results in him falling off the duck and into the water. The film ends with the duck laughing.\n\nThis cartoon, unlike other \"Aesop Sound Fables\" at that time, does not features Rita Mouse and features Milton Mouse only once. Milton is featured in the moral which is at the end of the cartoon. Instead, another recurring character entitled Farmer Al Falfa is featured in this cartoon, portrayed as the main character, he unexpectedly receives the iron man via post. Other characters in the film are a variety of species of animals, and the iron-man, who chases after all the characters at the end of the cartoon.\n\nThe film gathered positive reviews from the film magazines at that time. The Motion Picture News said that the film has \"nearly everything needed in a short of pen-and-ink variety\", and also said the film's music created \"many laughs when tied up to the antics to the cartoon characters\". The magazine's closing comment is that \"A good slapstick, or a short dramatic number will go along well with this.\"\n"}

The film is a sequel to the 1999 film \"The Mummy\".\n\n\"The Mummy Returns\" inspired the 2002 prequel film \"The Scorpion King\" which is set 5,000 years prior and whose eponymous character, played by Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, was introduced in this film. It was followed by the 2008 sequel \"\".\n\nIn 3067 BC, the Scorpion King leads his army on a campaign to conquer the known world. Seven years later, his army is defeated while attacking Thebes and exiled to the desert of Ahm Shere, where his men die of heat exhaustion. After vowing to give Anubis his soul for the power to defeat his enemies, an oasis forms to hide the Scorpion King's pyramid and he receives a legion of jackal warriors. The Army of Anubis sweeps across Egypt, but once their task is finished, Anubis claims the Scorpion King's soul and his army.\n\nIn 1933, Rick and Evelyn O'Connell explore a ruined mortuary temple in ancient Thebes with their son, Alexander, where they find the Bracelet of Anubis. In London, the bracelet locks onto Alex, showing him a vision directing him to Ahm Shere. Alex has seven days to reach the oasis before the bracelet will kill him when the sun's rays shine on the Scorpion King's pyramid.\n\nEvelyn is captured by an Egyptian cult who resurrect Imhotep; they wish to use his power to defeat the Scorpion King, giving him command of Anubis's army to take over the world. The cult, led by Baltus Hafez, the British Museum's curator, includes a warrior named Lock-Nah and Meela Nais, the latter being a reincarnation of Imhotep's lover Anck-su-namun. Rick sets out to rescue Evelyn, accompanied by her brother Jonathan and the Medjai Ardeth Bay.\n\nHafez attempts to sacrifice Evelyn but a fight ensues between Rick and Imhotep. Imhotep awakens mummified soldiers to kill Rick and the others. Freeing Evelyn, they flee on a double-decker bus. Alex is kidnapped by Lock-Nah, and along with the cult travels to Egypt. The O'Connells pursue along with Rick's associate from past adventures, Izzy, a pilot who provides the group with transportation.\n\nThe bracelet gives Alex directions to Ahm Shere and they travel there by train. Alex leaves clues for his parents, who follow in Izzy's dirigible. Imhotep uses the Book of the Dead to give Meela Nais the soul of Anck-su-namun, but inadvertently allows Evelyn to recover her memories of her previous life as Princess Nefertiri, the bracelet's keeper and Pharaoh Seti I's daughter. Lock-Nah finds Alex leaving clues, so Imhotep makes a wall of water that attacks the dirigible, causing the O'Connells to crash into the jungle of Ahm Shere. Izzy stays with the dirigible to repair it. The O'Connells attack the cult, and both groups are attacked by pygmy mummies. Rick retrieves Alex while Ardeth Bay kills Lock-Nah. They escape the pygmies, who kill the cult except for Baltus, Imhotep and Anck-su-namun.\n\nRick and Alex make it to the pyramid before sunrise, where the bracelet detaches from Alex's arm. Ardeth regroups with the Medjai in case Anubis's army rises. Evelyn is mortally stabbed by Anck-su-namun. Baltus puts the bracelet on and revives the Army of Anubis. Imhotep's powers are taken by Anubis, forcing him to fight as a mortal. Rick finds Imhotep summoning the Scorpion King and fights him, but the Scorpion King interrupts them, and Imhotep claims that Rick intends to kill him. The Medjai battle Anubis's army of jackal warriors. While Rick and the Scorpion King fight, Baltus is killed. Jonathan and Alex steal the Book of the Dead from Anck-su-namun and use it to resurrect Evelyn, who confronts Anck-su-namun while Alex and Jonathan help Rick.\n\nThe scepter Jonathan has been carrying extends into a spear that can kill the Scorpion King. The Medjai defeat Anubis' army, but find they have only defeated the vanguard. Rick sends the Scorpion King and his army back to the Underworld by killing the Scorpion King with the spear of Osiris, causing the oasis to be sucked back into the pyramid. Rick and Imhotep hang above a pit that leads to the underworld. Evelyn risks her own life to save Rick, but Anck-su-namun abandons Imhotep, who chooses to fall to his death after witnessing his lover's betrayal. Anck-su-namun falls into a pit of scorpions and is eaten alive. The O'Connells reach the top of the sinking pyramid, and Izzy arrives with a modified dirigible and rescues the O'Connells as the oasis and the pyramid disappear. They depart into the sunset.\n\n\"The Mummy Returns\" earned a gross profit (the worldwide box office minus the budget) of $335,013,000, which, taking inflation into account, is a few percent lower than \"The Mummy\" gross profit ($335,933,000).

The instrument is about 8 to 10 inches long with a girth of 6 to 8 inches on both ends and tapering towards the centre. The body of the instrument is traditionally made out of kiln fired clay but later variants are made of wood, preferebly from a single hollow block of Jackfruit wood. Brass bodies are also used in some parts. The ends of the instrument is covered across the mouth with cured and dried animal hide, goat skin is the preferred leather. Hoops are placed on the edge of the instrument body and the skin is tightened using strings woven from end to end.

The group was established in 1988 by Dan Sava, Mugur Mihăescu and Radu Pietreanu. In 2007 the group is formed by Mihăescu, Pietreanu and Florin \"Axinte\" Petrescu, but also includes some co-workers: Iulian \"Frankfurt\" Ilinca, Emil \"Mitică\" Rădinoiu, Mirela \"Lila\" Stoian and George \"Romică\" Robu.\n\nVacanţa Mare was formed as a student hobby group in the late 1980s. At first the group was made up by five, but it was not very popular. After two members left the group, Vacanţa Mare started to have shows by the seaside, especially during the summer holidays. In 1992, at a non-professional stand-up comedy contest, the group came in second for the \"Burduful de Aur\" award, where they were spotted by talent hunter Nicu Dragosin. He determined them to continue their stand-up comedy acts (they wanted to give up their routine at that point), while transforming them from amateurs into a professional group. Their first motto was \"Noi nu suntem normali\" (literally \"We're not normal\").\n\nThe group became famous and began staging 4 tours yearly: two national tours in spring and autumn and two at the seaside and sometimes in Bucharest. The three used to do parodies of songs, changing the lyrics and replacing them with political events sung alongside a guitar. The group made a signature entrance on stage, with a soundtrack based on \"The Final Countdown\" by Europe. Furthermore, their exit was always done on a remix of Floare de Iris of the Iris band and on the folk song Ţăranul e pe câmp (known in English as \"The Farmer In The Town\"), the spectators being invited to sing along. The show consisted from a series of 5-10 sketches and stand-up routines, 5–10 minutes each, followed by 5–30 minutes of song remixes playing satirizing a political or cultural event. Many of the sketches featured common Romanian regional or cultural stereotypes (such as the stupid policemen in Garcea, the stereotypical countryside fools, always drunk and fighting each other in Leana and Costel, or the not-so-successful thieves in Crapu and Menumorut).\n\nAfter Dan Sava's death in 1999, the two remaining members continued to activate, in the autumn of 1999 the group started a weekly show on Pro TV. The shows had a running time of one hour, being aired at prime-time (8 PM). The rival TV station Antena 1 responded with a similar show from Divertis, a remarkably similar group, that inspired the formation of Vacanța Mare in the late 80s. The show format consisted of two parts - half an hour of comedic sketches such as \"Râdeţi cu oameni ca noi\", (\"Laugh with the likes of us\"), \"Spectacol Vacanţa Mare\", (\"The Vacanţa Mare Show\") and \"Stăpânii Manelelor\", (\"The Masters of Manele\" - a pun on \"The Lord of the Rings\" translated in Romanian as \"Stăpânul Inelelor\"). This part of the show is somewhat similar to BBC's Little Britain show. The second half of the show it was reserved to a theatrical comedic series (\"Leana and Costel\"), featuring the life of their famous characters in the village of Sadova, Dolj.\n\nA few years in the collaboration with Pro TV, the show started to lose audience, being moved to a later time segment (10 PM). However, the group made two movies: Garcea si oltenii (2001) and Trei fraţi de belea (2006). Both movies where heavily promoted by Media Pro Pictures, a subsidiary of the company that also owns Pro TV, and \"Garcea și oltenii\" grossed the highest box office figures for a Romanian movie after 1989 (almost 290.000 spectators viewed the movie in Romania).\n\nAt the beginning of 2007 the group left Pro TV for Kanal D for a salary of 300.000€.\n\n\nThe group had an important influence amongst the Romanian public - a traffic policeman is commonly referred to as \"Garcea\", while some of their tag lines became common phrases in the urban vocabulary (such as \"iezista o esplicatie\" - a grammatically incorrect form of \"există o explicație\" - \"There is an explanation\" for a stereotypical explanation).\nAlso, a Hungarian is commonly referred to as \"Pishty\", a Magyar character played by Mugur.\n\n"}

Assembled in Jakarta on 1976 under Prambors management, they initially went by the name Warkop Prambors. They soon burgeoned as the country's top comedy group, surpassing Srimulat and Jakarta Group. After their film debut, they settled on the name Warkop DKI (taken from the initials of the three main members: Dono, Kasino and Indro; and also a play on Jakarta's official name, Jakarta DKI).\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Warkop joined Prambors for the \"Obrolan Santai di Warung Kopi\" weekly radio comedy program. The program featured Dono as Slamet; Kasino as Mas Bei, Acong and Buyung; Indro as Mastowi and Ubai; Nanu as Tulo; and Rudy as Mr. James and Bang Cholil. An appearance in \"Terminal Musikal\", directed by Mus Mualim, boosted Warkop's reputation as a comedy group.\n\nThe members are Wahjoe Sardono, Kasino Hadiwibowo, Indrodjojo Kusumonegoro, Nanu Mulyono, and Rudy Badil. They are Javanese and university graduates. Dono, Kasino and Nanu were students at University of Indonesia and Indro was a student at Pancasila University. Their student background prompted them to incorporate social criticism into their comedy. The only surviving member of the core trio is Indro, after Kasino died from a brain tumor in 1997 and Dono died from lung cancer in 2001.\n\nWarkop produced most of their work over 1979 - 1994, starring in 34 comedy films.\n"}
