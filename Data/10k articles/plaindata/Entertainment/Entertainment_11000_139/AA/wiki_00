{"id": "946002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=946002", "title": "Ator", "text": "Ator\n\nAtor is a film series of four Italian movies made in the 1980s created by director Joe D'Amato, under the pseudonym David Hills. D'Amato wrote and directed the first, second, and fourth films in the series, himself disregarding the existence of the third. Ator was played in the first three films by Miles O'Keeffe, while Eric Allan Kramer played the Son of Ator in the fourth.\n\nAtor is a swordsman, alchemist, scientist, magician, scholar, and engineer, with the ability to sometimes produce objects out of thin air (see \"Ator 4\"). The series seems to emulate the main character of the popular \"Conan the Barbarian\" movies. The first Conan film, \"Conan the Barbarian\", was released in Europe in April 1982; the first \"Ator\" movie was filmed shortly thereafter and came out later the same year, premiering October 7, 1982. D'Amato, a highly prolific exploitation director, likely created Ator purely as an attempt to make money from the success of the \"Conan\" films.\n\nThe first film in the series is 1982's \"Ator l'invincibile\", translated into English as \"Ator the Invincible\". It was released in America as \"Ator, The Fighting Eagle\". As the film opens Ator asks his father for permission to marry his sister. Ator's father tells Ator that he is adopted and so he can marry his sister if he likes. The rest of the film deals with Ator's sister being kidnapped by the high priest of the Spider Kingdom and Ator having to go on an epic quest to save her.\n\n1984's \"Ator 2 - L'invincibile Orion\", released in America as \"The Blademaster\" (and in a re-edited TV version years later as \"Cave Dwellers\") lends credence to the argument that Joe D'Amato was using Ator as a ploy to make money from the Conan franchise. Like its predecessor, it went into production shortly after the theatrical release of the second \"Conan\" movie, \"Conan the Destroyer\", and was released later the same year.\n\nIn this film, Ator and his sidekick Thong travel from the mythic \"Ends of the Earth\" to save Ator's mentor from an evil warlord. The film ends with Ator destroying an ancient object of power (called in the film the \"Geometric Nucleus\") that his mentor was guarding to protect it from falling into the hands of evil men.\n\nUnintentionally comic moments sometimes arise when writer/director Joe D'Amato has Ator use modern-day technology in the film. For example, Ator storms a castle using a 1980s style hang glider, and later destroys the \"Geometric Nucleus\" in a nuclear bomb explosion, complete with mushroom cloud, at the end of the film.\n\nThe film was a box office and home video failure. An edited version entitled \"Cave Dwellers\" was featured on the television show \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\", causing it to become a cult sensation. The American theatrical cut, \"The Blademaster,\" now enjoys modest success on home video and DVD as a cult favorite.\n\nJoe D'Amato dropped the \"Ator\" franchise in 1986, around the same time when it became public knowledge that there were no plans to make a third \"Conan\" movie. Instead, in 1987, a new director, Alfonso Brescia, wrote and directed the third \"Ator\" film, \"Iron Warrior\", which follows the same loose plot as \"Ator 2 - L'invincibile Orion\". The film abandons the continuity of the first two films (even so far as to completely contradict Ator's established back-story of having been adopted as a baby, instead opening with him playing as a child with a twin brother), and with writer/director D'Amato gone, the unintentional plot device of anachronisms disappears. Instead, Brescia turns the film into an art house picture, utilizing a variety of cinematic techniques and camera tricks to act as symbols or give deeper meaning to the film. Ator's character is also drastically changed: Here, he has black hair in a ponytail, and speaks roughly 50 words in the entire movie. \n\nThe film pays homage to a number of popular films from the time, including the first \"Superman\" film, \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\", \"Excalibur\", and \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\". The film's score is, as with the first of the series, provided by Carlo Maria Cordio - one of his themes for the film is a simple reworking of a very similar cue heard throughout Joe D'Amato's 1981 film \"Absurd\" (film) (also scored by Cordio).\n\nJoe D'Amato was reportedly displeased with Brescia's approach to his character, and so re-took control of the franchise in 1988. In 1990, D'Amato released the final Ator film, \"Ator l'invincible\", a retooling of the first film in the series. It was released in Europe and the United States under a variety of titles including: \"Ator III: The Hobgoblin\" (indicating D'Amato's disregard for the previous film), \"Quest for the Mighty Sword\", and \"Hobgoblin\". Here, Eric Allan Kramer plays the son of Ator; this is the only film in the series not to feature Miles O'Keeffe in the lead role.\n\nThe \"hobgoblin\" suit was recycled from the notorious \"Troll 2\"; in fact, this film was released as \"Troll 3\" in Germany.\n\n"}

Soon after Televisa announced Blim, the Mexicans started mocking Televisa through memes that strongly opinionated and mocked Televisa for producing lesser quality original content in comparison to the more critically acclaimed Netflix original content. Netflix itself released an ad which made fun of Televisa's original content, and criticized Bilm and Televisa for the perceived lesser quality of their content, as well as for removing their content from Netflix. The ad featured a man being sad because Televisa original content was removed, and his mom looking weird at him. Televisa retaliated by releasing an ad, where a look-like man dressed the same as the man who was sad in Netflix's ad, was happy for buying Blim. However Televisa's ad did not got the response it expected, because the ad only caused Televisa to get even more not favorable criticisms in comparison to Netflix. Causing Blim and Televisa to be even more heavily criticized for not understanding millennials, some which were as far as thanking Televisa for removing their content from Netflix. The main argument against Televisa, was people arguing there was no need to pay for a streaming service, in order to see series that are available to watch without even needing to buy cable in the first place.\n"}

{"id": "51776992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51776992", "title": "Captain Atom (Atlas Publications)", "text": "Captain Atom (Atlas Publications)\n\nCaptain Atom was an Australian comic book series created and written by Jack Bellew with illustrations by Arthur Mather. It was published from 1948 to 1954, with 64 issues and it also appeared as strips in a number of Australian newspapers. The protagonist, the first to use the name, has no relation to the later American superhero Captain Atom, published by Charlton Comics in 1965 and subsequently by DC Comics in 1987.\n\nThe fledgling publishing company Atlas Publications achieved its first major success with its \"Captain Atom\". It was drawn by Arthur Mather, who like Yaroslav Horak and Andrea Bresciani, became a regular artist for Atlas. The character was co-created and written by Jack Bellew under the pen name \"John Welles\". The character is based on a combination of Fawcett Publications' Captain Marvel and Quality Comics' Captain Triumph (first published in 1941 and 1943 respectively).\n\nThe character's origin had identical twin brothers being caught in an atomic bomb blast and becoming fused into one, with Dr. Bikini Rador (a nuclear physicist) being the dominant persona. By shouting the magic word, \"Exenor!\", Rador transforms into his now atomic-powered twin. Rador takes on the identity of Larry Lockhart, an FBI agent, to fight crime, switching places with his brother when situations call for a superhero.\n\nThe comic was originally published entirely in colour, but Atlas followed its chief rival, K.G. Murray, and switched to black and white two years later when the cost of colour printing became prohibitive. Despite the switch to black and white, the \"Captain Atom\" series remained successful, running to 64 issues over the next six years. The first issue of \"Captain Atom\", which was released in January 1948 sold approximately 100,000 copies and at its peak was selling 180,000 copies. Early issues featured backup stories provided by Mather (\"Dopey Dan\"), Stan Pitt (\"Jim Atlas\", \"Dr Peril of Igogo\") and Michael Trueman (\"Crackajack – Daredevil Trapeze Star\").\n\nCaptain Atom was one of the few original Australian comic heroes to have his own merchandising and fan club. In the 1950s the fan club boasted that it had \"over 75,000 members\". \n\nThe character was revived in 1985 and again in 2016 by Gerald Carr, appearing in Meteor Comics' \"Vixen\". Captain Atom, renamed as the Atomic Warrior, featured alongside another 1950s Australian comic book hero, The Panther (created by Paul Wheelahan), and Carr's Vixen and Brainmaster.\n\nThere is a visual reference to Captain Atom in the Watchmen comic book. In the origin story of Dr Manhattan (who is based on the Charlton Comics Captain Atom), the character is shown rejecting a helmet which is part of his US Government-supplied costume. The helmet design and the overall costume, although a different colour, somewhat resemble that of the Atlas Comics Captain Atom. The British artist, Dave Gibbons, may have been familiar with the Australian character.\n\n"}

A high end broadcast color suite may use a Da Vinci Systems or Pandora International's color corrector. If a VTR is the source for the video the room is often called a \"tape to tape\" suite. Many suites are designed to operate as a telecine suite or a tape to tape suite by changing the configuration of the suite. The operator of the suite is usually called a \"Colorist\". If a telecine is the source this is called a \"Film to Tape\" operation. A color suite may use one video standard or be able to change configuration to a number of standards like: high-definition video, NTSC, or PAL or a DI workflow. Color suites are sometime placed in digital cinema movie theaters with a video projector for color correction to that display format.\n\nThe suite room will also have video equipment in the Production control room for monitoring the video signal like: Video monitor, Waveform monitor and vectorscope.\n\nThe suite may have an either a Non-linear editing system (NLE) or Linear editing system to control the source and record device. This may be internal to the color grading device, as in a Pandora's poggle or Da Vinci's 2k or external, as in Da Vinci's TLC (telecine controller).\n\nA vision mixer may also be in the suite for monitoring different video sources or for simple or special effects in the video. A character generator is sometime used also for titling and subtitle.\n\nThe suite may have equipment to read, log and insert into the video Kodak's Keykode. Keykode is bar coding that is placed at regular intervals on negative films to aid in identifying and counting of film frames. Evertz, Aaton and ARRI are three types of readers for telecine use.\n\nThe suite may or may not have audio post production equipment. This would be to monitor and if needed sync up the program audio to the video source if the sound was not on the film. An audio mixing console and other audio equipment such as effects devices may also be in the suite. The audio may be from the film soundtrack. The term MOS is used, on a slate, when a scene is filmed without sync sound or any sound. A clapperboard slate is used at the start and sometime at the end of scene to mark particular takes recorded during a production.\n\nOther equipment that may be used in the suite are: digital still store\\Frame grabber to store references frames, noise reducer to reduce film grain/dirt and video noise; video router and audio router.\n\nThe telecine, VTRs and some of the larger equipment are often placed in a central apparatus room or \"machine room\" and are interconnected through Cable trays or raised floor to the color suite by patch panels, Coaxial cables, Computer network and Multicore cables.\n\nSome color suites are at video post production facilities that rent them by the hour for the transfer of TV commercials, documentaries and movies.\nThese color suites would have a client area behind the colorist. With the client present this would be called a supervised session.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24139655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24139655", "title": "Cyr wheel", "text": "Cyr wheel\n\nThe Cyr wheel (also known as the roue Cyr, mono wheel, or simple wheel) is an acrobatic apparatus that consists of a single large ring made of aluminum or steel with a diameter approximately taller than the performer. The performer stands inside the Cyr wheel and grasps its rim, causing it to roll and spin gyroscopically while performing acrobatic moves in and around the rotating wheel. The apparatus and its movement vocabulary have some similarities with the German wheel, but whereas the German wheel consists of two large rings linked together by horizontal crossbars and has handles for the performer to hold onto, the modern Cyr wheel consists of a single ring and has no handles. The Cyr wheel takes its name from Daniel Cyr, who reinvented it as a circus apparatus at the end of the 20th century.\n\nThere are records of people using a similar apparatus as sports equipment during the mid-20th century in Germany, where it was referred to as the \"Einreifen\" or \"mono wheel\", having been developed by Adalbert von Rekowski as a variation on Otto Feick's popular \"Rhönrad\" (German wheel). \n\nAround 1996, the wheel was reinvented and developed as a circus apparatus by Daniel Cyr, a graduate of the National Circus School in Montreal and co-founder of the contemporary circus troupe Cirque Éloize. Cyr claims the idea came to him from a large hula hoop and an old circular wrought-iron coat rack. His design for the wheel went through several iterations, evolving from steel to aluminum, adding a PVC coating, and eventually implementing a multi-part design that could be disassembled for easier transportation. Cyr first performed with the apparatus in the Cirque Éloize production of \"Excentricus\", which toured North America, Europe and Asia between 1997 and 2002. He subsequently presented a Cyr wheel circus act at the 2003 Festival Mondial du Cirque de Demain in Paris and won the Silver Medal for his performance.\n\nSince its recent popularization as a circus skill, hundreds of circus artists from around the world have performed in the wheel and it is now taught in several major circus schools. The USA Wheel Gymnastics Federation and the International Rhoenradturnen Verband, with significant assistance from coaches and athletes from the École Nationale de Cirque de Montréal, developed rules for Cyr wheel competition. The first such competition was held in Chicago in October 2011 and the first world championships in Cyr wheel competition was held during the 10th World Championships in Wheel Gymnastics, July 7-14, 2013 in Chicago.\n\nProfessional circus schools that offer advanced training on the Cyr wheel include: the Ecole Supérieure des Arts du Cirque (ESAC) in Belgium, the National Centre for Circus Arts in the UK, the Centre national des arts du cirque (CNAC) in France, and the École nationale de cirque in Montreal.\n\nCyr wheels are typically made of stainless steel tubing or aluminum tubing approximately in diameter. They are often composed of 3 or 5 individual pieces fixed together by steel or aluminum couplings. They may be painted and covered with an anti-slip plastic coating to add friction and protect the metal.\n\nSmaller wheels spin faster, work better for smaller spaces, and make \"no hand\" tricks easier than larger wheels. Larger wheels are more graceful and there is more room for suspensions.\n\n\n"}

It was officially announced on May 4, 2012. A playable version of the game was presented at the 2012 Role Play Convention in Cologne, Germany and the E3 2012.\n\nA reveal trailer was released on May 24, 2012.\n\nThe gameplay of \"Dark\" is based on stealth combat. Eric has many supernatural vampiric 'skills' at his disposal; he can use Shadow Leap to quickly teleport to different areas and to perform stealth finishers, make himself temporarily invisible, see in the dark and slow down time. His abilities are linked to a certain amount of 'blood points' which are used up each time Eric uses a skill. He can drink blood from his enemies to restore his health and blood points.\n\nThe game follows the story of Eric Bane (Doug Cockle), a newly turned vampire suffering from amnesia. He learns that his transformation is not complete and that, if he does not drink the blood of his sire, he will mutate into a mindless ghoul. In order to avoid being such a foul creature, he receives missions to drink ancient vampires' blood. However, an angel in Eric's view appears to guide him to the righteous path, and ease intolerable pain that comes from not drinking appropriate blood as it disappears. With a question of this vision, he tries to recover his deleted memories and his true self.\n\n\"Dark\" received \"generally unfavorable reviews\" on both platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Much of the game's criticism has been aimed at the poor melee combat, camera, script, and lack of interest in the game's protagonist. In a mixed review, Jon Blythe of \"Official Xbox Magazine UK\" stated: \"\"DARK\" is frustrating, because that initial feeling of being a zippy blur of a vampire in a world of neon-lit night never leaves you. It's just swamped in frustrating design decisions, a script that lurches from passable to laughable, weak enemy AI, and a vortex of a lead character who's impossible to like or hate.\" Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer stated that \"low-budget games can be delightful and surprising, but only if the core elements work. Here, they don't. In its best moments, this is only ever a reminder of better games. In its worst moments - of which there are far too many - \"Dark\" frustrates and irritates as only a clumsy stealth game can.\"\n\nMichael Engle of The Game Scouts said, \"I would rather [insert cliché about how to kill a vampire here] than play this game.\"\nIn the most negative review on the website, Andrew Reiner of \"Game Informer\" complained that \"I’ve played a lot of bad Xbox 360 games for achievements, but hardly any are as unpolished and poorly executed as \"Dark\". It’s easily one of this generation’s worst titles. Even when the stealth is working moderately well, the slow pacing is a killer, and no amount of blood sucking brings satisfaction. Most levels were completed through trial and error, failure after failure, and then success coming from exploiting an AI bug or an odd design decision.\"\n\n"}

Dratch's character would usually appear at social gatherings and interrupt the conversation to voice negative opinions and pronouncements. She is especially concerned about the rate of feline AIDS, a subject that she would bring up on more than one occasion, saying it was the number one killer of domestic cats.\n\nThe first appearance of Debbie Downer was on May 1, 2004, with guest host Lindsay Lohan. Debbie and five family members—played by Lohan, Jimmy Fallon, Dratch, Amy Poehler, Fred Armisen, and Horatio Sanz—are eating breakfast at a restaurant in Walt Disney World. While the family makes small talk, Debbie makes negative comments on current events followed by a knowing look at the camera and a cartoonish \"wah-wah\" sound made by a muted trombone.\n\nIn this sketch, everyone on camera cracked up because of both the \"wah-wah\" sound effect and Dratch flubbing a line early on and correcting herself. The sketch was listed at #99 as part of TV Land's \"Top 100 Most Unexpected Moments in TV History.\"\n\nDebbie Downer appeared in a sketch in the 2004-05 season opener with Ben Affleck as the guest host. The cast members who appeared in this sketch were more composed and did not laugh out loud at Debbie's pronouncements. This trend continued throughout the rest of the season.\n\nIn future airings of the Affleck episode, the live Debbie Downer sketch was replaced by the dress rehearsal version, along with an opening title card explaining that the dress rehearsal \"worked better.\" In the dress rehearsal, the cast all cracks up just as they did in the Lindsay Lohan episode.\n\nThe character appeared two more times that season: once at Thanksgiving dinner (with Luke Wilson as host) and another at the Oscars with Hilary Swank (playing herself). The latter sketch revealed that Debbie babysat Swank when Swank was a child. Will Forte appeared in the sketch as Swank's then-husband, Chad Lowe.\n\nIn 2005, the season premiere of \"Saturday Night Live\" featured a Debbie Downer sketch at the end of the episode. Host Steve Carell's character, Bob Bummer, is just as negative, and he and Debbie fall in love.\n\nThe December 17, 2005, episode, hosted by Jack Black, included a Christmas-themed sketch showing Debbie in her childhood during a visit from Santa Claus. This episode contradicts her debut sketch, as here she refers to her last name being \"Downer.\"\n\nOn April 15, 2006, Debbie returned for her final appearance before Dratch departed the show, this time at a bachelorette party at a strip club in Las Vegas for her sister, played once again by host Lohan, despite not being invited in the first place. As with the very first sketch, there is one point when the orchestra mistakenly began playing the \"wah-wah\" sound effect at the wrong time.\n\nDuring the May 8, 2010, episode hosted by Betty White, there was a Debbie Downer sketch filmed during dress rehearsal, but it was cut from the live show due to time constraints. The episode is now posted on NBC.com's \"Saturday Night Live\" page, featuring video clips of old and new sketches from the show's 35-years-and-counting tenure. A group of suburban women (all played by the guest actresses listed in addition to then-current cast member Kristen Wiig) are having a lingerie party and, as usual, Debbie Downer ruins everyone's fun. One housewife (played by Amy Poehler) yells at Debbie and asks her why she's so miserable all the time. Downer thinks back to her childhood where during her birthday, her depressed grandmother (played by White) warns her not to enjoy her birthday cake because gluten allergies run in her family.\n\nDuring the SNL 40th anniversary special, Dratch appears briefly at the beginning as Downer, telling the audience that starting a show with a musical performance decreases viewership.\n\nEvery sketch opened with a prologue, then the theme song (and corresponding video) plays, followed by the body of the sketch. The sketch would ultimately close with the last line of the song played again (and one more negative fact from Debbie). The song ends with an extreme close-up of Debbie's pained expression.\n\nTheme song lyrics:\n\"You're enjoying your day, \neverything's going your way,\nthen along comes Debbie Downer.\nAlways there to tell you 'bout a new disease,\na car accident, \nor killer bees.\nYou'll beg her to spare you,\n'Debbie, please!'\nbut you can't stop Debbie Downer!\"\n\nThe Christmas sketch began with a special theme song. It featured an animated Debbie, looking much like \"The Grinch Who Stole Christmas\", and a tune similar to the Grinch's song. Steve Carell's Bob Bummer also had his own theme song.\n\n\n"}

The magician then presents a rack of metal spikes. Spectators are offered the chance to tap the spikes with a metal implement to prove they are real and solid. The spikes are fitted into the top of the cabinet pointing downwards. An assistant is introduced and steps into the cabinet. The door is closed and the spikes are forced downwards using handles that protrude through slots in the side of the cabinet. The implication is that the assistant must have been impaled by the spikes. However the door is opened to reveal the assistant alive and unharmed. \n\nThere are several slight variations. Sometimes the assistant carries a string of inflated balloons when he or she steps into the cabinet. These are burst as the spikes descend to give an added audible dimension to the illusion. Another description has a small door opened to show the assistant alive when the spikes are at the bottom of the cabinet; the small door is then closed again and the spikes lifted to the top before the assistant is finally fully revealed.\n\nFrench magician Don José de Murcia performs a version of this illusion under the title \"La Herse Infernal\".\n\nThe illusion is thought to be the creation of Floyd Thayer, founder of the Thayer Magic Company. Blueprints for it appeared in the Thayer catalog #7 supplement, which dates it to the early 1930s.\n\n\n"}

A video cassette was released in 1989, and re-broadcasting was first done in 1990.\n\nThe show was rebroadcast in 1993, 1996 and 1998, but due to the choice of inappropriate broadcasting dates (usually on Sunday), its recognizance and the viewer rating were critically low. In October 1998, however, KBS noticed the increased viewership, and the broadcasting time was changed to 5:30 p.m. Monday and Tuesday (known as the 'Golden Viewing Time') starting May 12 through June 23, 2003. With more people watching the show, its ratings improved. A new version of the TV series, which began broadcasting in 2009, is currently shown Monday through Friday, at 4:00 PM on the Korean Animation channel Tooniverse, Korea's first all-anime/manhwa channel.\n\nThe cartoon was once reported to the officials as a bad example for children because of the use of Dooly's care-giver's name in a friendly fashion. Koreans usually speak to adults with respect and with the use of proper additions in speech done so specifically for adults by younger people. This was seen as hazardous for the basic thinking of the children who watch it.\n\nTooniverse also released an educational English dub in 1995, and a theatrical release came out in 1996 under Dooly Nara (Dooly Nation).\n\n\nWhen Dooly was first created as a TV animation, it received a lot of criticism from South Korean Catholics, South Korean citizens, and the government. Reasons cited included the fact that the animation was a bit violent, which was suppressed by the South Korean government, and the adult general public was angered due to its character's attitude of disrespect towards elders. However, this was when freedom of speech was not seriously taken into account. Generally speaking, the younger generation has fond memories of this series and find that the violence is actually a quite realistic portrayal of family dynamics in contemporary South Korea.\n\nThe character \"Michol\" has also received criticism in more recent years due to the character's appearance being likened to blackface.\n\n\n"}

He worked on this, his most important poem, as early as 1916—when still only 17 years old—and completed it in 1925. \"Dymer\" was his second published work; it was published by J. M. Dent in 1926, under the pseudonym Clive Hamilton (the writer's actual first name followed by his mother's maiden name).\n\nLewis thought of himself as writing in the tradition of Homer, Spenser, Milton, Wordsworth, and others. George Sayer's analysis suggests that the book is about the temptation of fantasies, \"the fantasies of love, lust, and power.\"\n\n\"Dymer\" follows the adventures of its titular protagonist from his birth in a totalitarian state, mockingly referred to as 'The Perfect City', to the events leading to his death at the hands of a monster he begat.\n\nFrom the opening, Dymer grows to the age of nineteen under the control of the state, until, under the influence of spring and the sight of a songbird, he rises in his lecture-hall and murders the aged lecturer before his class, then leaves the stunned civilians behind as he wanders outside The City.\n\nDymer casts off his clothing along with civilization, wandering in the forests until he comes upon an empty mansion with food prepared. After dressing himself again with finer clothing, and feasting alone at a banquet table, Dymer sleeps with an unseen female figure who comes to him in the darkness of the mansion. Upon awakening, Dymer steps outside of the palace and wanders blissfully in the woods. Returning to the palace in search of his lover, he finds every entry barred by a hideous old she-monster. After pleading with her to 'yield but one inch; once only from your law', Dymer approaches the woman with intent to fight his way past her. What happens at this point is uncertain, except that Dymer emerges wounded from the palace and limps into the woodlands.\n\nIt begins to rain that night in the woods, and Dymer encounters yet another person he cannot see in the dark, this time a wounded man. This man also hails from The Perfect City, and tells Dymer of what happened in his absence, specifically that a revolutionary named Bran used Dymer's actions and name to instill violent protest in the citizens, who then went on to sack and raze the city. Dymer is dumbfounded at this information, and stays silent in the night until the man's wounds prove fatal, then sets out again for the wilderness.\n\nDymer encounters another individual in the wilderness, a man who uses a liquid to put himself into an extended dreaming state. Convincing Dymer that the answer to his anguish is in the dreaming world, Dymer swallows a cup of the liquid. In his hallucination, Dymer encounters his former lover from the mansion, but realizes she is monstrous. Instead of accepting this as the truth, he flees the scene as demons rise to assault him. Upon awakening, Dymer is threatened by the dreaming man, and sets off into the wilderness again. Dymer later arrives at a cemetery where he encounters an angelic guardian, who tells Dymer of a horrible monster lurking about, who was conceived by a union between a divine being and a mortal. Realizing that the beast is his own offspring, Dymer states he must face his own son in battle. Donning the guardian's armor, he prepares to fight the monster, which ends in his own death and the beast becoming a god.\n\n"}

Ildebrando brought his family up in a traveling circus. The family eventually formed their own circus, and Edmondo became a gifted clown, as well as doing acrobatics. \n\nDuring World War I, when food was hard to come by, Edmondo was walking through town when he was recognized by a townsman. The man had enjoyed the act so much, that he gave Edmondo his pagnotta, a small loaf of bread that was, at the time, rationed by the bakery to one loaf per person. Others came up, and each gave him their bread in appreciation for the act. From then on, when the townspeople saw him, they would say \"There goes Pagnotta\". Edmondo adopted it as his stage name. With this name, he became the most famous clown in Italy in the 1920s.\n\nHe developed his first human cannonball act in Cairo in 1922. This cannon was a crude spring-powered contraption that hurled him 20 feet. The result of his first attempt was a broken leg. He re-designed the device in a hospital in Cairo. Later successful versions used compressed air. \n\nZacchini and his brother Vittorio were invited to the United States in 1930 by a circus promoter. The family, consisting of six brothers and two sisters, eventually settled in Florida, becoming citizens of the United States.\n\nZacchini died in a hospital at the age of 87.

{"id": "1222493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1222493", "title": "Emergent gameplay", "text": "Emergent gameplay\n\nEmergent gameplay refers to complex situations in video games, board games, or table top role-playing games that emerge from the interaction of relatively simple game mechanics.\n\nDesigners have attempted to encourage emergent play by providing tools to players such as placing web browsers within the game engine (such as in \"Eve Online\", \"The Matrix Online\"), providing XML integration tools and programming languages (\"Second Life\"), fixing exchange rates (\"Entropia Universe\"), and allowing a player to spawn any object they desire to solve a puzzle (\"Scribblenauts\").\n\nIntentional emergence occurs when some creative uses of the game are intended by the game designers. Since the 1970s and 1980s board games and table top role playing games such as \"Cosmic Encounter\" or \"Dungeons & Dragons\" have featured intentional emergence as a primary game function by supplying players with relatively simple rules or frameworks for play that intentionally encouraged them to explore creative strategies or interactions and exploit them toward victory or goal achievement.\n\nIn games with complex physics and flexible object interaction it may be possible to complete in-game problems using solutions that the game designers did not foresee. \"Deus Ex\" is often cited as a game responsible for promoting the idea of emergent gameplay, with players developing interesting solutions such as using wall-mounted mines as pitons for climbing walls.\n\nSuch emergence may also occur in games through open-ended gameplay and sheer weight of simulated content, in \"\" or Space Station 13 for example.\n\nSome games do not use a pre-planned story structure, even non-linear.\n\nIn \"The Sims\", a story may emerge from the actions of the player. But the player is given so much control that they are more creating a story than interacting with a story. Emergent narrative would only partially be created by the player. Warren Spector, the designer of \"Deus Ex\", has argued that emergent narrative lacks the emotional impact of linear storytelling.\n\n\"Left 4 Dead\" features a dynamic system for game dramatics, pacing, and difficulty called the Director. The way the Director works is called \"Procedural narrative\": instead of having a difficulty which increases to a constant level, the A.I. analyzes how the players fared in the game so far, and tries to add subsequent events that would give them a sense of narrative.\n\nUnintentional emergence occurs when creative uses of the video game were not intended by the game designers.\n\nEmergent gameplay can arise from a game's AI performing actions or creating effects unexpected by even the software developers. This may be by either a software glitch, the game working normally but producing unexpected results when played in an abnormal way or software that allows for AI development; for example the unplanned genetic diseases that can occur in the \"Creatures\" series.\n\nIn several games, especially first-person shooters, game glitches or physics quirks can become viable strategies, or even spawn their own game types. In id Software's \"Quake\" series, rocket jumping and strafe-jumping are two such examples. In the game \"Halo 2\", pressing the melee attack button (B) quickly followed by the reload button (X) and the primary fire button (R trigger) would result in the player not having to wait for the gun to be back in position to shoot after a melée attack. Doing this has become known as \"BXR-ing\". \n\n\"\" had a glitch in the physics engine which allowed players to \"ski\" up and down steep slopes by rapidly pressing the jump key, gaining substantial speed in the process. The exploitation of this glitch became central to the gameplay, supplanting the vehicles that had been originally envisioned by the designers as the primary means of traversing large maps.\n\nThanks to a programming oversight by Capcom, the \"combo\" (or \"2-1 combo\") notion was introduced with the fighting game \"Street Fighter II\", when skilled players learned that they could combine several attacks that left no time for their opponents to recover, as long as they were timed correctly.\n\nIn online car racing games, particularly \"Project Gotham Racing\", players came up with an alternate objective known as \"Cat and Mouse\". The racers play on teams of at least two cars. Each team picks one very slow car as the mouse, and their goal is to have their slow car cross the finish line first. Thus the team members in faster cars aim to push their slow car into the lead and ram their opposing teams' slow cars off the road.\n\nCompleting games without getting certain items or by skipping seemingly required portions of gameplay result in sequence breaking, a technique that has developed its own dedicated community. Often, speed of completion and/or minimalist use of items are respectable achievements. This technique has long been used in the \"Metroid\" game series and has developed into a community devoted to speedruns. NetHack has over time codified many such challenges as \"conduct\" and acknowledges players who manage to finish characters with unbroken pacifist or vegetarian disciplines, for example. A comparable form of restricted gameplay has been implemented within \"World of Warcraft\", known as \"Iron Man\" leveling.\n\nA change in gameplay can be used to create a \"de facto\" minigame, such as the \"Green Demon Challenge\" in \"Super Mario 64\", where the object is to avoid collecting a 1-up which chases the player, even passing through terrain, while the player attempts to collect all red coins on a level. Other challenges have been built around reaching normally unreachable areas or items, sometimes using glitches or gameplaying tools, or by completing a level without using an important game control, such as the 'jump' button or joystick.\n\nMachinima, the use of computer animation from video game engines to create films, began in 1996. The practice of recording deathmatches in id Software's 1996 computer game \"Quake\" was extended by adding a narrative, thus changing the objective from winning to creating a film. Later, game developers provided increased support for creating machinima; for example, Lionhead Studios' 2005 game \"The Movies\", is tailored for it.\n\nTraders in MMOs with economic systems play purely to acquire virtual game objects or avatars which they then sell for real-world money on auction websites or game currency exchange sites. This results in the trader's play objective to make real money regardless of the original game designer's objectives.\n\nMany games prohibit currency trading in the EULA, but it is still a common practice.\n\nSome players provide real world services (like website design, web hosting) paid for with in-game currency. This can influence the economy of the game, as players gain wealth/power in the game unrelated to game events. For example, this strategy is used in Blizzard Entertainment's \"World of Warcraft\".\n\nGambling and lotteries may occur in online role-playing games such as \"EVE Online\" and \"Dark Age of Camelot\". The provision of gambling services in exchange for in-game currency can take the forms of a lottery, card games, event betting, or any number of other variations, most often at least loosely based on established real-world games. Players typically establish a betting facility, lottery etc. Players typically create a website for executing the gambling, then accept payment from gamblers using in-game currency to credit the gambler's website account. Winnings are then paid back to the gambler's account.\nOther forms of gambling are commonly used in Massively Multiplayer Online Games, such as betting on who will win a duel.\n\nIn games with no financial law game mechanism, players develop financial institutions. Forms include banks or investment schemes launched with an IPO, typically based purely on trust.\n\nThe world's first MMORPG IPO was \"ISS Marginis\" by the Interstellar Starbase Syndicate \"(ISS)\" in Eve-Online, on 29 September 2005. This was for a dividend based on profitability. The ISS followed up with a series of IPOs, culminating in an IPO of the player guild itself promising a fixed return, like a bond. Eve Online has no game-mechanism for financial law.\n\nIn games with rough economies like World of Warcraft's Auction House system, some players make a living by buying items that are unusually low priced and reselling them at high prices, or by buying out all competition and creating a monopoly. In the MMO \"Runescape\", players can purchase many thousand units of an item then sell them later for a profit just like a normal commodity market. This game includes price data on all items for the last 180 days.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2300163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2300163", "title": "Endless Night (novel)", "text": "Endless Night (novel)\n\nEndless Night is a crime novel by Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 30 October 1967 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company the following year. The UK edition retailed at eighteen shillings (18/-) and the US edition at $4.95. It was one of her favourites of her own works and received some of the warmest critical notices of her career upon publication.\n\nThe title comes from William Blake's \"Auguries of Innocence\":\n\nMichael Rogers, a footloose, seemingly nonchalant, working-class dabbler, narrates the story. He has a close relationship with his friend, Rudolf Santonix, a famous but ailing architect with an interest in one day building a house for Michael. While walking along a village road, Michael meets Fenella \"Ellie\" Guteman, a wealthy heiress, who yearns for a life outside of her judgmental and pompous inner circle of relatives and advisers. Ellie and Michael form a romantic relationship and decide to marry.\n\nExcited by the prospect of their new life, Ellie is able to fund the building of Gipsy's Acre, their new modern home near the place where they met. Michael requests Santonix build the house, to which he readily agrees. The couple come across locals, such as Major Phillpot, the village \"God\"; Claudia Hardcastle, a woman who shares Ellie's love of horse riding; and Miss Esther Lee, an elderly gypsy who tells Ellie to leave the village or fate will curse her. Matters are made worse when Ellie invites her attractive secretary/companion Greta Anderson to stay at the house, to the annoyance of Michael who eventually gets into a heated argument with her.\n\nEllie begins to become more worried about the dangers of Gipsy's Acre and more frightened of Miss Lee's increasing hostility towards her. Then, when she fails to return after embarking on a routine morning horse ride, Ellie's dead body is found in the woods. An inquest finds that a combination of a heart condition and being thrown from her horse was to blame. Michael visits Rudolf Santonix in hospital as he is close to death. Santonix, with his dying breath, screams \"Why didn't you go the other way?\" before dying in front of Michael. A melancholy Michael has to travel to America to attend Ellie's funeral and to receive the inheritance bequeathed to him in Ellie's will. While in America, Michael receives a letter from the village telling him that the bodies of Miss Lee and Claudia Hardcastle have been discovered, suggesting that Ellie's death was not an accident.\n\nWhen he returns to the village, the true nature of Michael's intent is revealed: he had met Greta Anderson in Germany before meeting Ellie, and they had instantly fallen in love. Greedy for the good life, they had devised a plan in which Michael would marry Ellie to gain her inheritance, then murder her and marry Greta. Michael then murdered Ellie by poisoning the allergy capsule she took before riding her horse. The slow-acting cyanide killed her during the ride. Having paid Miss Lee to frighten Ellie to throw suspicion on the old gypsy, Michael eliminated her as a witness by pushing her into a quarry. The death of Claudia was an accident in that she had borrowed Ellie's allergy medicine to be able to ride her horse and so had died in the same way. Santonix had guessed Michael's intents previously, and his seemingly random outburst was in anger that Michael killed Ellie rather than living happily with her.\n\nEven as Michael and Greta celebrate their triumph, Michael begins to break down in remorse and revulsion. He tells Greta of his vision of Ellie while on the road to Gipsy's Acre. Infuriated when Greta scolds him for his sudden weakness, he is further enraged by her disdain for Gipsy's Acre and his regret at the murder of Ellie. He viciously strangles her. At the end of the novel, Michael meekly awaits his fate as villagers discover Greta's murder and local officials interview him in his home.\n\nThe following details of the characters are based on the original novel. Backstories, backgrounds, and names vary with differing international adaptations, based on censorship, cultural norms, etc.\n\nFenella Rogers (née Guteman): Often called Ellie, she is a sweet heiress with a head for business\n\nMichael Rogers: A 'rolling stone', who shifts from job to job\n\nGreta Andersen: Ellie's Scandinavian, blonde companion with a penchant for arranging and often compared with a valkyrie.\n\nClaudia Hardcastle: A young woman in the village who shares Ellie's passion for horse-riding.\n\nCora Van Stuyvesant: Ellie's stepmother, several times divorced, and a thoroughly unpleasant woman of roughly forty years of age who married Ellie's father for money.\n\nAndrew Lipincott: Ellie's guardian and trustee, a Bostonian with hardly a trace of accent, who resents Greta's 'influence' over Ellie.\n\nEsther Lee: The village gypsy, who enjoys frightening people, especially when money is involved\n\nStanford Lloyd: Claudia Hardcastle's former husband and one of Ellie's trustees\n\nFrank Barton: The husband of Ellie's aunt, a man who borrows but doesn't return\n\nRudolf Santonix: A perfectionist architect who 'looks through you' and 'sees right through the other side'. A personal friend of Michael's from the latter's time as a cab driver.\n\nMajor Phillpot: The village 'god' who becomes a good friend of Michael\n\nMrs Rogers: One of the few people who knows Michael well. She worked hard to get her son a proper education since her husband was often drunk.\n\nThe novel - which recycles ploys and characters Christie had used in \"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\" and \"Death on the Nile\" - is dedicated \"To Nora Prichard from whom I first heard the legend of Gipsy's Acre.\" Nora Prichard was the paternal grandmother of Mathew, Christie's only grandson. Gipsy's Acre was a field located on a Welsh moorland. \"The Times Literary Supplement\" of 16 November 1967 said, \"It really is bold of Agatha Christie to write in the \"persona\" of a working-class boy who marries a poor little rich girl, but in a pleasantly gothic story of gypsy warnings she brings it all off, together with a nicely melodramatic final twist.\"\n\n\"The Guardian\" carried a laudatory review in its issue of 10 November 1967 by Francis Iles (Anthony Berkeley Cox) who said, \"The old maestrina of the crime-novel (or whatever is the female of 'maestro') pulls yet another out of her inexhaustible bag with \"Endless Night\", quite different in tone from her usual work. It is impossible to say much about the story without giving away vital secrets: sufficient to warn the reader that if he should think this is a romance he couldn't be more mistaken, and the crashing, not to say horrific suspense at the end is perhaps the most devastating that this surpriseful author has ever brought off.\"\n\nMaurice Richardson in \"The Observer\" of 5 November 1967 began, \"She changes her style again and makes a determined and quite suspenseful attempt to be with it.\" He finished, \"I shan't give away who murders whom, but the suspense is kept up all the way and Miss Christie's new demi-tough, streamlined style really does come off. She'll be wearing black leather pants next, if she isn't already.\" The poet and novelist Stevie Smith chose the novel as one of her \"Books of the Year\" in the same newspaper's issue of 10 December 1967 when she said, \"I mostly read Agatha Christie this year (and every year). I wish I could write more about what she does for one in the way of lifting the weight, and so on.\"\n\nRobert Barnard: \"The best of the late Christies, the plot a combination of patterns used in \"Ackroyd\" and \"Nile\" (note similarities in treatment of heiress/heroine's American lawyers in \"Nile\" and here, suggesting she had been rereading). The murder occurs very late, and thus the central section seems desultory, even novelettish (poor little rich girl, gypsy's curse, etc.). But all is justified by the conclusion. A splendid late flowering.\"\n\nA short story collection by Agatha Christie, titled \"Miss Marple's Final Cases and Two Other Stories\", published in October 1979, features a short story called \"The Case of the Caretaker\" whose overall plot is the same as \"Endless Night\", although the character names are different.\n\n\"‘The Case of the Caretaker’ was first published in Strand Magazine, January 1942, and then in the USA in Chicago Sunday Tribune, 5 July 1942.\" from \"Miss Marple - Miss Marple and Mystery: The Complete Short Stories (Miss Marple)\" by Agatha Christie\n\nA 1972 film was made, starring Hayley Mills, Britt Ekland, Per Oscarsson, Hywel Bennett and George Sanders (who committed suicide before the film's release). Christie reportedly had some reservations about the use of sex scenes to enliven the plot (there is only one in the finished film, with very brief nudity from Ms Ekland).\n\n\"Endless Night\" was presented as a one-hour radio play in the \"Saturday Theatre\" strand on BBC Radio 4 on 30 August 2008 at 2.30pm. The play's recording took place at Broadcasting House and had an original score composed by Nicolai Abrahamsen.\n\nAdaptor: Joy Wilkinson\nProducer/Director: Sam Hoyle\nCast:\n\"Jonathan Forbes\" as Mike\n\"Lizzy Watts\" as Ellie\n\"Sara Stewart\" as Greta\n\"Joan Walker\" as Cora/Mike's Mother\n\"Victoria Lennox\" as Mrs Lee\n\"Chris Pavlo\" as Mr Constantine/Auctioneer/Policeman/Assistant\n\"John Rowe\" as Philpott/Lippincott\n\"Joseph Tremain\" as Young Mike/Army Boy\n\"Dan Starkey\" as Santonix/Frank\n\"Thomas Brown-Lowe\" as Oscar\n\n\"Endless Night\" was released by HarperCollins as a graphic novel adaptation on 3 November 2008, adapted by François Rivière and illustrated by Frank Leclercq ().\n\nAlthough the book did not feature Miss Marple, it is part of the sixth series of \"Agatha Christie's Marple\", starring Julia McKenzie. It aired first on Argentina's Film&Arts on Wednesday 20 November, Australia's ABC on Sunday 22 December 2013, and aired on ITV on Sunday 29 December 2013. This adaptation by Kevin Elyot remains fairly faithful to the book, although, in addition to adding Miss Marple, it identifies the boyhood friend murdered for his wristwatch by Rogers with the architect's brother, who does not appear in the original novel. The architect (named Robbie Hayman in this TV adaption) ends up burning down the house he has designed for Rogers after discovering his brother's watch in Rogers' desk drawer.\n\n\nIn the US, the novel was first serialised in two parts in \"The Saturday Evening Post\" from 24 February (Volume 241, Number 4) to 9 March 1968 (Volume 241, Number 5) with illustrations by Tom Adams.\n\n"}
{"id": "3446255", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3446255", "title": "Family Entertainment Protection Act", "text": "Family Entertainment Protection Act\n\nThe United States Family Entertainment Protection Act (FEPA) was a bill introduced by Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY), and co-sponsored by Senators Joe Lieberman (D-CT), Tim Johnson (D-SD) and Evan Bayh (D-IN) on November 29, 2005. The bill called for a federal mandate enforcement of the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) ratings system for video games in order to protect children from inappropriate content.\n\nThe FEPA would have imposed fines of US$1000 or 100 hours of community service for a first time offense of selling a \"Mature\" or \"Adult-Only\" rated video game to a minor, and $5000 or 500 hours for each subsequent offense. The bill also called for a FTC investigation into the ESRB to ascertain whether they have been properly rating games.\n\nSimilar bills have been passed in some U.S. states such as California, Michigan and Illinois, but were ruled to be unconstitutional in \"Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n\", 564 U.S. 08–1448 (2011). \n\nThis bill did not become law; it was referred to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and expired at the end of the 109th Congress without further action.\n\nThe centerpiece of this bill is a prohibition against any business for selling or renting a Mature, Adults-Only, or Ratings Pending game to a person who is younger than seventeen. On-site store managers would be subject to a fine of $1,000 or 100 hours of community service for the first offense; $5,000 or 500 hours of community service for each subsequent offense. This provision is not aimed at punishing retailers who act in good faith to enforce the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB) system. That’s why retailers would have an affirmative defense if they were shown an identification they believed to be valid or have a system in place to display and enforce the ESRB system. Similar prohibitions had become law in the last several months in California, Michigan, and Illinois, but were later overturned.\n\nSince the bill relies on the video game industry to continue rating the appropriateness of games for minors, this bill requires an annual, independent analysis of game ratings. This analysis will help ensure that the ESRB ratings system accurately reflects the content in each game and that the ratings system does not change significantly over time.\n\nPart of the genesis of this bill was the revelation that the makers of \"\" had included, through embedded code that was discovered and made accessible to the public, sexually explicit content inconsistent with the game’s Mature rating. This bill requires the FTC to conduct an investigation to determine whether what happened with \"GTA: San Andreas\" is a pervasive problem. It also includes a Sense of Congress that the Commission shall take appropriate action if it determines that there is a pervasive problem.\n\nThis bill requires the Bureau of Consumer Protection (BCP) of the FTC to ensure that consumers can file complaints if they find content to be misleading or deceptive and requires the BCP to report on the number of such complaints to Congress.\n\nThis bill authorizes the FTC to conduct an annual, random audit of retailers – sometimes referred to as a secret shopper survey – to determine how easy it is for young people to purchase Mature and Adults Only video games and report the findings to Congress.\n\n\n"}

The rate was lowest in Western Australia (2.5%) and highest in the Northern Territory (12.0%). Gambling revenue made up 2.5% of total state revenue when other revenue sources were taken into account.

This figure is $123 million greater than the combined total of profits generated from poker machines in the City of Sydney.\n\nFrom January to March 2013 poker machines in the Hunter region had a turn over of $4.5 billion, showing an increase of $500 million since 2010. Daily figures show a spend of $12.5 million, working out to be $8682 per minute.

That is the equivalent of one poker machine for every 71 adults. In 2010-11, venues in Gosford made approximately $95,865,000 in profit from pokies. That equates to $700 for each adult member of Gosford's population.\n\nWyong has approximately 2608 pokies, spread across 35 venues. That is the equivalent of one poker machine for every 47 adults. In 2010-11, venues in Wyong made approximately $123,159,000 in profit from pokies.

Young men between the ages of 18-24 living on the Central Coast are the biggest players of poker machines in NSW and are the highest risk group for problem gambling.\n\nIn 2008 Central Coast Gambling Help carried out a survey of 200 young people aged from 13-24 and found:\n\nSince the introduction of new gambling services, including online gambling, the Commonwealth has taken a more active role in the regulation of gambling, but the Australian gambling industry is also regulated by State and Territory authorities:\n\nTraditionally gambling has been legislated at a state and territory level rather than by the Commonwealth:\n\n\nThe Interactive Gambling Act (2001) was passed by the Australian Commonwealth Parliament on 28 June 2001. It received assent on 11 July 2001\n\nThe Act is targeted at online gambling operators, making it an offense for them to offer ‘real-money’ online interactive gambling to residents of Australia. It also makes it illegal for online gambling operators to advertise ‘real-money’ interactive gambling services (such as online poker and casino) to Australian citizens.\nThat being said, the amount spent on online gaming by Australians reached some $800 million by 2010, according to the official 2010 Productivity Report of the Australian Government.\n\nAccessing and using the interactive gambling services is not an offence. It is also allowed to companies based in Australia to offer their gambling services to gamblers located outside Australia with the exception of those countries that were called 'designated countries'.\n\nGamblers' winnings in Australia are not taxed. There are 3 main reasons for that:\n\nTaxation of gambling operators in Australia differs from state to state and different gambling services are taxed in a different way. There are taxes on the turnover, on player loss and net profit. As gambling operators need to obtain a license to offer their services, certain fees must also be paid at this stage of gambling business development.\n\nThe use of different tax rates and tax bases makes it difficult to compare taxes across states. For example, the ACT's keno tax rate of 2.53% of turnover is equivalent to a tax rate on gross profits of 10.12%.\n\nTax rates (2015-16)\n\n"}

Lacrosse was introduced to England in 1876 by William George Beers and other Canadians who toured the country playing exhibition matches. A second tour was arranged in 1883; by then England had 60 clubs playing regular fixtures in Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Lancashire, Middlesex and Yorkshire.\n\nThe first national governing body for the men's game, the English Lacrosse Union, was formed in 1892. A Ladies' Lacrosse Association followed in 1912, and the separate men's and women's organisations merged in 1996 to form the English Lacrosse Association (ELA). The ELA oversees both the men's and women's national teams.\n\nOxford and Cambridge have held Varsity Matches in lacrosse since 1903, playing every year besides the world wars. Oxford leads the series 56-40-5.\n\nClub men's lacrosse in Britain is divided into northern and southern leagues, with Flags competitions at the end of each winter season. In addition to the regular 10-a-side season there are other tournaments, such as those at Stockport and Bath, which use a 6-a-side or 8-a-side format and shorter games.\n\nNorthern clubs are governed by North of England Men's Lacrosse Association (NEMLA), which was formed in 1897 when 10 clubs began playing regular fixtures. NEMLA now comprises a Premiership and four further Senior Divisions. Southern clubs are governed by South of England Men's Lacrosse Association (SEMLA) and comprises a Premier Division, two West Divisions (including South Wales), and three East Divisions.\n\nThe main focus of men's lacrosse popularity in Britain is the North-West of England, around the Greater Manchester area. Greater Manchester has hosted the World Lacrosse Championship in 1978, 1994, and 2010. A second centre is in the South of England, especially around the London area.\n\nMen's lacrosse is a common minority sport in universities, which along with club-based youth programs, provide the majority of newcomers with their first experiences of the sport. In 2008, a men's BUCS league was introduced, providing greater support and recognition to the men's university teams.\n\nMcCrone credits lacrosse's limited popularity with Victorian men for its adoption by many girls' public schools in the 1890s. In 1905 former students from Wycombe Abbey, Roedean and Prior's Field schools formed the first women's lacrosse club in England, the Southern Ladies' Lacrosse Club. The club played against sides from public schools and was captained by Audrey Beaton, an Old Roedeanian. In 1912 Beaton led the establishment of the Ladies' Lacrosse Association, which included school teams; Beaton became honorary secretary and Penelope Lawrence, Roedean headmistress, was its first president.\n\nThe LLA expanded rapidly and established a national team in March 1913. A rivalry with hockey developed when some girls' schools replaced hockey with lacrosse, but lacrosse remained a more minor sport.\n\nA close relationship between the LLA and the men's English Lacrosse Union was consolidated with a merger in 1996 to form the English Lacrosse Association. Today, club women's lacrosse is governed by the South East Women's Lacrosse Association (SEWLA), South West Women's Lacrosse Association (SWWLA), and North Women's Lacrosse Association (NWLA).\n\nLacrosse is often introduced to boys and girls with a soft stick and ball version of the game called pop lacrosse. Since 1982, the English Lacrosse Association has brought over one thousand coaches from outside the U.K. to teach young players the game.\n\nEngland, Scotland and Wales compete as separate teams in international competitions. In the men's 2006 World Lacrosse Championship England finished in 5th place and in the Women's Lacrosse World Cup in 2005, England finished 3rd. In the men's 2007 World Indoor Lacrosse Championship England finished in 4th place.\n\nIn the 2008, 2012 and 2016 European Lacrosse Championships England successfully defended their title in the Men's competition, and came second in the Women's competition\n\nThe 2010 World Lacrosse Championships were held in Manchester, England from 16–24 July at the Manchester University Sports Ground, The Armitage Centre.

While choral texts and stage directions are in Latin, the spoken text of the play is in the vernacular, which makes the Adam the oldest extant play written in any old French dialect. It is a dramatic representation of the temptation and fall of Adam and Eve, the story of Cain and Abel, and a series of prophets including Isaiah and Daniel. It is part of the medieval tradition of mystery plays, which developed from dramatic elements in the celebration of Mass, and includes choral music.\n\nThe opening statement of the piece describes part of the set:\nThe play was to be presented outside the church, possibly with Paradise being located at the top of the stairs to the west door, such that the church doors would stand in for the gates of Heaven.\n\nThe author of this play is unknown, although we can assume from his knowledge of Latin that he was in a religious position.\n\nThe 2009 English translation of the play by Carol Symes in \"The Broadview Anthology of British Literature\" was staged at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Cloisters Museum in New York City in December 2016.

Indra was initially recorded in the Rigveda, the first of the religious scriptures that comprise the Vedas. Indra continued to play a prominent role throughout the evolution of Hinduism and played a pivotal role in the two Sanskrit epics that comprise the Itihasas, appearing in both the Ramayana and Mahabharata.

Egyptologist Jan Assmann has also suggested that Greek \"Elysion\" may have instead been derived from the Egyptian term \"ialu\" (older \"iaru\"), meaning \"reeds,\" with specific reference to the \"Reed fields\" (Egyptian: \"sekhet iaru\" / \"ialu\"), a paradisiacal land of plenty where the dead hoped to spend eternity.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is becoming more and more popular in spite of the fact that it is currently outlawed. In 1999 the importance of contemporary Chinese art was recognized by the inclusion of 19 contemporary Chinese artists in the Venice Biennale. In recent years many of these artists have made performances specifically for photography or film. \n\nSome of the more extreme examples of Chinese performance art have become notorious in the West. In 2000, Zhu Yu, a painter and performance artist from Cheng Du, created a scandal by taking a number of photographs of himself, supposedly eating a foetus as a protest against state abortions as a means of population control. Peng Yu and Sun Yuan have also worked with human body parts as well as with live animals and are equally notorious. Some younger performance artists who have exhibited widely in the west in 2005-6 are Shu Yang, the organiser of the Dadao Live Art Festival in Beijing, Yang Zhichao, famous for having his identity card number branded on his back and Wang Chuyu who went on hunger strike as part of an exhibition called Fuck Off that took place in Shanghai in 2000 in opposition to the Shanghai Biennale.

The film material shows how the archaeological team discovered the long sought ancient tomb of an Emperor of the Ming dynasty.\n\nIn the tomb, the team found a scroll, telling of a secret Temple of Eternal Fire. The temple is believed to be hiding a previously unknown oil reserve, and would be of great financial importance to the Chinese people were it to be discovered.\n\nDuring the expedition, when the tomb was opened, a forceful hurricane took the life of Mason, the co-pilot. The storm was predicted by an ancient curse guarding the tomb. Unfortunately, as Benton is about to reveal the contents of the scroll during the presentation, he starts choking and ultimately dies from suffocation.\n\nAfter the presentation, it turns out that the scroll is missing from Benton's safe in his office, and his secretary, Win Len, claims she has no knowledge of its whereabouts. One of Benton's students, James Lee Wong, does his own investigation into the death of his professor, and finds out that Benton must have been poisoned with what another man, Street, identifies as an oriental vegetable poison. James finds a pitcher and a glass cup containing traces of this poison. \nAnother member of the expedition team, camera man Charles Fraser, is attacked in his home, and is found injured by James and Street.

{"id": "23387052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23387052", "title": "Popeye", "text": "Popeye\n\nPopeye the Sailor is a cartoon fictional character created by Elzie Crisler Segar. The character first appeared in the daily King Features comic strip, Thimble Theatre, on January 17, 1929, and Popeye became the strip's title in later years; Popeye has also appeared in theatrical and television animated cartoons.\n\nSegar's \"Thimble Theatre\" strip was in its 10th year when Popeye made his debut, but the one-eyed (left) sailor quickly became the main focus of the strip, and \"Thimble Theatre\" became one of King Features' most popular properties during the 1930s. After Segar's death in 1938, \"Thimble Theatre\" was continued by several writers and artists, most notably Segar's assistant Bud Sagendorf. The strip continues to appear in first-run installments in its Sunday edition, written and drawn by Hy Eisman. The daily strips are reprints of old Sagendorf stories.\n\nIn 1933, Max Fleischer adapted the \"Thimble Theatre\" characters into a series of \"Popeye the Sailor\" theatrical cartoon shorts for Paramount Pictures. These cartoons proved to be among the most popular of the 1930s, and Fleischer—and later Paramount's own Famous Studios—continued production through 1957. These cartoon shorts are now owned by Turner Entertainment and distributed by its sister company Warner Bros..\n\nOver the years, Popeye has also appeared in comic books, television cartoons, arcade and video games, hundreds of advertisements, and peripheral products (ranging from spinach to candy cigarettes), and the 1980 live-action film directed by Robert Altman, starring comedian Robin Williams as Popeye.\n\nIn an interview, Charles Schulz said \"\"Popeye\" was a great favorite of mine...I think \"Popeye\" was a perfect comic strip, consistent in drawing and humor\". In 2002, \"TV Guide\" ranked Popeye #20 on its \"50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time\" list.\n\nPopeye's story and characterization vary depending on the medium. Originally, Popeye got \"luck\" from rubbing the head of the Whiffle Hen; by 1932, he was instead getting \"strength\" from eating spinach. Swee'Pea is definitively Popeye's ward in the comic strips, but he is often depicted as belonging to Olive Oyl in cartoons. The cartoons also occasionally feature members of Popeye's family who have never appeared in the strip, notably his lookalike nephews Peepeye, Pupeye, Pipeye, and Poopeye.\n\nThere is no absolute sense of continuity in the stories, although certain plot and presentation elements remain mostly constant, including purposeful contradictions in Popeye's capabilities. Popeye seems bereft of manners and uneducated, yet he is often depicted as capable of coming up with solutions to problems that seem insurmountable to the police or, most importantly, the scientific community. Popeye has, alternatively, displayed Sherlock Holmes-like investigative prowess (determining, for instance, that his beloved Olive was abducted by estimating the depth of the villains' footprints in the sand), scientific ingenuity (as his construction, within a few hours, of a \"spinach-drive\" spacecraft), or oversimplified (yet successful) diplomatic arguments (by presenting his own existence—and superhuman strength—as the only true guarantee of world peace at diplomatic conferences). Popeye's pipe also proves to be highly versatile. Among other things, it has served as a cutting torch, jet engine, propeller, periscope, musical instrument, and, of course, a whistle with which he produces his trademark toot. Popeye also on occasion eats spinach through his pipe, sometimes sucking in the can itself along with the contents. Since the 1970s, Popeye is seldom depicted using his pipe to smoke tobacco.\n\nPopeye's exploits are also enhanced by a few recurring plot elements. One is the love triangle among Popeye, Olive, and Bluto, and the latter's endless machinations to claim Olive at Popeye's expense. Another is his near-saintly perseverance in overcoming any obstacle to please Olive, who often renounces Popeye for Bluto's dime-store advances. She is the only character that Popeye will permit to give him a thumping. Finally, Popeye usually uncovers villainous plots by accidentally sneaking up on the antagonists as they brag about or lay out their schemes.\n\n\"Thimble Theatre\" was cartoonist E. C. Segar's third published strip when it first appeared in the \"New York Journal\" on December 19, 1919. The paper's owner William Randolph Hearst also owned King Features Syndicate, which syndicated the strip. \"Thimble Theatre\" was intended as a replacement for \"Midget Movies\" by Ed Wheelan (Wheelan having recently resigned from King Features). It did not attract a large audience at first, and at the end of its first decade appeared in only half a dozen newspapers.\n\nIn its early years, the strip featured characters acting out various stories and scenarios in theatrical style (hence the strip's name). It could be classified as a gag-a-day comic in those days.\n\n\"Thimble Theatre's\" first main characters were the thin Olive Oyl and her boyfriend Harold Hamgravy. After the strip moved away from its initial focus, it settled into a comedy-adventure style featuring Olive, Ham Gravy, and Olive's enterprising brother Castor Oyl. Olive's parents Cole and Nana Oyl also made frequent appearances.\n\nPopeye first appeared in the strip on January 17, 1929 as a minor character. He was initially hired by Castor Oyl and Ham to crew a ship for a voyage to Dice Island, the location of a casino owned by the crooked gambler Fadewell. Castor intended to break the bank at the casino using the unbeatable good luck conferred by stroking the hairs on the head of Bernice the Whiffle Hen. Weeks later, on the trip back, Popeye was shot many times by Jack Snork, a stooge of Fadewell's, but survived by rubbing Bernice's head. After the adventure, Popeye left the strip but, due to reader reaction, he was quickly brought back.\n\nThe Popeye character became so popular that he was given a larger role, and the strip was taken up by many more newspapers as a result. Initial strips presented Olive as being less than impressed with Popeye, but she eventually left Ham Gravy to become Popeye's girlfriend and Ham Gravy left the strip as a regular. Over the years, however, she has often displayed a fickle attitude towards the sailor. Castor Oyl continued to come up with get-rich-quick schemes and enlisted Popeye in his misadventures. Eventually, he settled down as a detective and later on bought a ranch out West. Castor has seldom appeared in recent years.\n\nIn 1933, Popeye received a foundling baby in the mail, whom he adopted and named \"Swee'Pea.\" Other regular characters in the strip were J. Wellington Wimpy, a hamburger-loving moocher who would \"gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today\" (he was also soft-spoken and cowardly; Vickers Wellington bombers were nicknamed \"Wimpys\" after the character); George W. Geezil, a local cobbler who spoke in a heavily affected accent and habitually attempted to murder or wish death upon Wimpy; and Eugene the Jeep, a yellow, vaguely dog-like animal from Africa with magical powers. In addition, the strip featured the Sea Hag, a terrible pirate, as well as the last witch on earth (her even more terrible sister excepted); Alice the Goon, a monstrous creature who entered the strip as the Sea Hag's henchwoman and continued as Swee'Pea's babysitter; and Toar, a caveman.\n\nSegar's strip was quite different from the cartoons that followed. The stories were more complex, with many characters that never appeared in the cartoons (King Blozo, for example). Spinach usage was rare and Bluto made only one appearance. Segar would sign some of his early Popeye comic strips with a cigar, due to his last name being a homophone of \"cigar\" (pronounced SEE-gar). The success of the strip meant Segar was earning $100,000 a year at the time of his death.\n\n\"Thimble Theatre\" became one of King Features' most popular strips during the 1930s. A poll of adult comic strip readers in the April 1937 issue of \"Fortune\" magazine voted \"Popeye\" their second favourite comic strip (after \"Little Orphan Annie\"). By 1938, \"Thimble Theatre\" was running in 500 newspapers, and over 600 licensed \"Popeye\" products were on sale. Following an eventual name change to \"Popeye\" in the 1970s, the comic remains one of the longest running strips in syndication today. After Mussolini came to power in Italy, he banned all American comic strips, but Popeye was so popular the Italians made him bring it back. The strip carried on after Segar's death in 1938, at which point he was replaced by a series of artists. In the 1950s, a spinoff strip was established, called \"Popeye the Sailorman\".\n\nAfter Segar's death in 1938, many different artists were hired to draw the strip. Tom Sims, the son of a Coosa River channel-boat captain, continued writing \"Thimble Theatre\" strips and established the \"Popeye the Sailorman\" spin-off. Doc Winner and Bela Zaboly, successively, handled the artwork during Sims's run. Eventually, Ralph Stein stepped in to write the strip until the series was taken over by Bud Sagendorf in 1959.\n\nSagendorf wrote and drew the daily strip until 1986, and continued to write and draw the Sunday strip until his death in 1994. Sagendorf, who had been Segar's assistant, made a definite effort to retain much of Segar's classic style, although his art is instantly discernible. Sagendorf continued to use many obscure characters from the Segar years, especially O.G. Wotasnozzle and King Blozo. Sagendorf's new characters, such as the Thung, also had a very Segar-like quality. What set Sagendorf apart from Segar more than anything else was his sense of pacing. Where plotlines moved very quickly with Segar, it would sometimes take an entire week of Sagendorf's daily strips for the plot to be advanced even a small amount.\n\nFrom 1986 to 1992, the daily strip was written and drawn by Bobby London, who, after some controversy, was fired from the strip for a story that could be taken to satirize abortion. London's strips put Popeye and his friends in updated situations, but kept the spirit of Segar's original. One classic storyline, titled \"The Return of Bluto\", showed the sailor battling every version of the bearded bully from the comic strip, comic books, and animated films. The Sunday edition of the comic strip is currently drawn by Hy Eisman, who took over in 1994. The daily strip began featuring reruns of Sagendorf's strips after London was fired and continues to do so today.\n\nOn January 1, 2009, 70 years since the death of his creator, Segar's character of Popeye (though not the various films, TV shows, theme music and other media based on him) became public domain in most countries, but remains under copyright in the United States. Because Segar was an employee of King Features Syndicate when he created the Popeye character for the company's \"Thimble Theatre\" strip, Popeye is treated as a work for hire under U.S. copyright law. Works for hire are protected for 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation, whichever is shorter. Since Popeye made his first appearance in January 1929, and all U.S. copyrights expire on December 31 of the year that the term ends, Popeye will enter the public domain in the U.S. on January 1, 2025, assuming no amendments to U.S. copyright law before that date.\n\n\nThere have been a number of Popeye comic books, from Dell, King Comics, Gold Key Comics, Charlton Comics and others, originally written and illustrated by Bud Sagendorf. In the Dell comics, Popeye became something of a crimefighter, thwarting evil organizations and Bluto's criminal activities. The new villains included the numerous Misermite dwarfs, who were all identical.\n\nPopeye appeared in the British \"TV Comic\" series, a News of the World publication, becoming the cover story in 1960 with stories written and drawn by \"Chick\" Henderson. Bluto was referred to as Brutus and was Popeye's only nemesis throughout the entire run.\n\nA variety of artists have created \"Popeye\" comic book stories since then; for example, George Wildman drew Popeye stories for Charlton Comics from 1969 until the late 1970s. The Gold Key series was illustrated by Wildman and scripted by Bill Pearson, with some issues written by Nick Cuti.\n\nIn 1988, Ocean Comics released the \"Popeye Special\" written by Ron Fortier with art by Ben Dunn. The story presented Popeye's origin story, including his given name of \"Ugly Kidd\" and attempted to tell more of a lighthearted adventure story as opposed to using typical comic strip style humor. The story also featured a more realistic art style and was edited by Bill Pearson, who also lettered and inked the story as well as the front cover. A second issue, by the same creative team, followed in 1988. The second issue introduced the idea that Bluto and Brutus were actually twin brothers and not the same person, an idea also used in the comic strip on December 28, 2008 and April 5, 2009. In 1999, to celebrate Popeye's 70th anniversary, Ocean Comics revisited the franchise with a one-shot comic book, entitled \"The Wedding of Popeye and Olive Oyl\", written by Peter David. The comic book brought together a large portion of the casts of both the comic strip and the animated shorts, and Popeye and Olive Oyl were finally wed after decades of courtship. However, this marriage has not been reflected in all media since the comic was published.\n\nIn 1989, a special series of short \"Popeye\" comic books were included in specially marked boxes of Instant Quaker Oatmeal, and Popeye also appeared in three TV commercials for Quaker Oatmeal, which featured a parrot delivering the tag line \"Popeye wants a Quaker!\" The plots were similar to those of the films: Popeye loses either Olive Oyl or Swee'Pea to a muscle-bound antagonist, eats something invigorating, and proceeds to save the day. In this case, however, the invigorating elixir was not his usual spinach, but rather one of four flavors of Quaker Oatmeal. (A different flavor was showcased with each mini-comic.) The comics ended with the sailor saying, \"I'm Popeye the Quaker Man!\", which offended members of the Religious Society of Friends or Quakers. Members of this religious group (which has no connection to the cereal company) are pacifists and do not believe in using violence to resolve conflicts. For Popeye to call himself a \"Quaker man\" after beating up someone was offensive to the Quakers and considered a misrepresentation of their faith and religious beliefs. In addition, the submissiveness of Olive Oyl went against the Quakers' emphasis on women's rights. The Quaker Oatmeal company apologized and removed the \"Popeye the Quaker man\" reference from commercials and future comic book printings.\n\nIn 2012, writer Roger Langridge teamed with cartoonists Bruce Ozella, Ken Wheaton, and Tom Neely (among others) to revive the spirit of Segar in IDW's 12-issue comic book miniseries, \"Popeye\", Critic PS Hayes reviewed:\n\nIn late 2012, IDW began reprinting the original 1940s–1950s Sagendorf Popeye comic books under the title of \"Classic Popeye\".\n\nIn November 1932, King Features signed an agreement with Fleischer Studios to have Popeye and the other \"Thimble Theatre\" characters begin appearing in a series of animated cartoons. The first cartoon in the series was released in 1933, and \"Popeye\" cartoons, released by Paramount Pictures, would remain a staple of Paramount's release schedule for nearly 25 years. William Costello was the original voice of Popeye, a voice that would be replicated by later performers, such as Jack Mercer and even Mae Questel. Many of the \"Thimble Theatre\" characters, including Wimpy, Poopdeck Pappy, and Eugene the Jeep, eventually made appearances in the Paramount cartoons, though appearances by Olive Oyl's extended family and Ham Gravy were notably absent. Thanks to the animated-short series, Popeye became even more of a sensation than he had been in comic strips, and by 1938, polls showed that the sailor was Hollywood's most popular cartoon character.\n\nIn every Popeye cartoon, the sailor is invariably put into what seems like a hopeless situation, upon which (usually after a beating), a can of spinach becomes available, and Popeye quickly opens the can and consumes its contents. Upon swallowing the spinach, Popeye's physical strength immediately becomes superhuman, and he is easily able to save the day (and very often rescue Olive Oyl from a dire situation). It did not stop there, as spinach could also give Popeye the skills and powers he needed, as in \"The Man on the Flying Trapeze\", where it gave him acrobatic skills. (When the antagonist is the Sea Hag, it is Olive who eats the spinach; Popeye can't hit a lady.)\nIn May 1942, Paramount Pictures assumed ownership of Fleischer Studios, fired the Fleischers and began reorganizing the studio, which they renamed Famous Studios. The early Famous-era shorts were often World War II-themed, featuring Popeye fighting Nazis and Japanese soldiers, most notably the 1942 short \"You're a Sap, Mr. Jap\". In late 1943, the \"Popeye\" series was moved to Technicolor production, beginning with \"Her Honor the Mare.\" Famous/Paramount continued producing the \"Popeye\" series until 1957, with \"Spooky Swabs\" being the last of the 125 Famous shorts in the series. Paramount then sold the \"Popeye\" film catalog to Associated Artists Productions, which was bought out by United Artists in 1958. Through various mergers, the rights are currently controlled by WarnerMedia's Turner Entertainment.\n\nIn 2001, Cartoon Network, under the supervision of animation historian Jerry Beck, created a new incarnation of \"The Popeye Show\". The show aired the Fleischer and Famous Studios \"Popeye\" shorts in versions approximating their original theatrical releases by editing copies of the original opening and closing credits (taken or recreated from various sources) onto the beginnings and ends of each cartoon, or in some cases, in their complete, uncut original theatrical versions direct from such prints that originally contained the front-and-end Paramount credits. The series aired 135 \"Popeye\" shorts over forty-five episodes, until March 2004. \"The Popeye Show\" continued to air on Cartoon Network's spin-off network Boomerang.\n\nWhile many of the Paramount \"Popeye\" cartoons remained unavailable on video, a handful of those cartoons had fallen into public domain and were found on numerous low budget VHS tapes and later DVDs. When Turner Entertainment acquired the cartoons in 1986, a long and laborious legal struggle with King Features kept the majority of the original Popeye shorts from official video releases for more than 20 years. King Features instead opted to release a DVD boxed set of the 1960s made-for-television \"Popeye the Sailor\" cartoons, to which it retained the rights, in 2004. In the meantime, home video rights to the Associated Artists Productions library were transferred from CBS/Fox Video to MGM/UA Home Video in 1986, and eventually to Warner Home Video in 1999. In 2006, Warner Home Video announced it would release all of the \"Popeye\" cartoons produced for theatrical release between 1933 and 1957 on DVD, restored and uncut. Three volumes were released between 2007 and 2008, covering all of the Fleischer era and the beginnings of the Famous era. On December 11, 2018, the color Famous Studios cartoons will be made available for the first time officially on DVD and Blu-ray from Warner Home Video through the Warner Archive Collection starting with \"Popeye the Sailor: The 1940s Volume 1\" containing the first 14 Technicolor shorts from 1943-1945 all restored and remastered in HD from 4K scans of the original nitrate Technicolor negatives.\n\nIn 1960, King Features Syndicate commissioned a new series of cartoons entitled \"Popeye the Sailor\", but this time for television syndication. Al Brodax served as executive producer of the cartoons for King Features. Jack Mercer, Mae Questel, and Jackson Beck returned for this series, which was produced by a number of companies, including Jack Kinney Productions, \"Rembrandt Films\" (William L. Snyder and Gene Deitch), Larry Harmon Productions, Halas and Batchelor, Paramount Cartoon Studios (formerly Famous Studios), and Southern Star Entertainment (formerly Southern Star Productions). The artwork was streamlined and simplified for the television budgets, and 220 cartoons were produced in only two years, with the first set of them premiering in the autumn of 1960, and the last of them debuting during the 1961–1962 television season. Since King Features had exclusive rights to these \"Popeye\" cartoons, 85 of them were released on DVD as a 75th anniversary \"Popeye\" boxed set in 2004.\n\nFor these cartoons, Bluto's name was changed to \"Brutus\", as King Features believed at the time that Paramount owned the rights to the name \"Bluto\". Many of the cartoons made by Paramount used plots and storylines taken directly from the comic strip sequences – as well as characters like King Blozo and the Sea Hag. The 1960s cartoons have been issued on both VHS and DVD.\n\nOn September 9, 1978, \"The All New Popeye Hour\" debuted on the CBS Saturday morning lineup. It was an hour-long animated series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions, which tried its best to retain the style of the original comic strip (Popeye returned to his original costume and Brutus to his original name of Bluto), while complying with the prevailing content restrictions on violence. In addition to providing many of the cartoon scripts, Mercer continued to voice Popeye, while Marilyn Schreffler and Allan Melvin became the new voices of Olive Oyl and Bluto, respectively. (Mae Questel actually auditioned for Hanna-Barbera to recreate Olive Oyl, but was rejected in favor of Schreffler.) \"The All New Popeye Hour\" ran on CBS until September 1981, when it was cut to a half-hour and retitled \"The Popeye and Olive Show\". It was removed from the CBS lineup in September 1983, the year before Jack Mercer's death. These cartoons have also been released on VHS and DVD. During the time these cartoons were in production, CBS aired \"The Popeye Valentine's Day Special – Sweethearts at Sea\" on February 14, 1979. In the UK, the BBC aired a half-hour version of \"The All New Popeye Show\", from the early-1980s to 2004.\n\nPopeye briefly returned to CBS in 1987 for \"Popeye and Son\", another Hanna-Barbera series, which featured Popeye and Olive as a married couple with a son named Popeye Jr., who hates the taste of spinach but eats it to boost his strength. Maurice LaMarche performed Popeye's voice; Mercer had died in 1984. The show lasted for one season.\n\nIn 2004, Lions Gate Entertainment produced a computer-animated television special, \"\", which was made to coincide with the 75th anniversary of Popeye. Billy West performed the voice of Popeye, describing the production as \"the hardest job I ever did, ever\" and the voice of Popeye as \"like a buzzsaw on your throat\". The uncut version was released on DVD on November 9, 2004; and was aired in a re-edited version on Fox on December 17, 2004 and again on December 30, 2005. Its style was influenced by the 1930s Fleischer cartoons, and featured Swee'Pea, Wimpy, Bluto (who is Popeye's friend in this version), Olive Oyl, Poopdeck Pappy and the Sea Hag as its characters. On November 6, 2007, Lions Gate Entertainment re-released \"Popeye's Voyage\" on DVD with redesigned cover art.\n\nPopeye has made brief parody appearances in modern animated productions, including:\nOn December 2, 2018, a Popeye web series produced by the WildBrain studio was premiered on its official YouTube channel.\n\nPopeye’s theme song, titled \"I'm Popeye The Sailor Man\", composed by Sammy Lerner in 1933 for Fleischer’s first \"Popeye the Sailor\" cartoon, has become forever associated with the sailor. \"The Sailor's Hornpipe\" has often been used as an introduction to Popeye's theme song.\n\nA cover of the theme song, performed by Face to Face, is included on the 1995 tribute album \"\", produced by Ralph Sall for MCA Records. A jazz version, performed by Ted Kooshian's Standard Orbit Quartet, appears on their 2009 Summit Records release \"Underdog and Other Stories\".\n\nPlayground song parodies of the theme have become part of children's street culture around the world, usually interpolating \"frying pan\" or \"garbage can\" into the lyrics as Popeye's dwelling place and ascribing to the character various unsavory actions or habits that transform the character into an \"Anti-Popeye\", and changing his exemplary spinach-based diet into an inedible morass of worms, onions, flies, tortillas and snot.\n\nThe success of Popeye as a comic-strip and animated character has led to appearances in many other forms. For more than 20 years, Stephen DeStefano has been the artist drawing Popeye for King Features licensing.\n\n\"Popeye\" was adapted to radio in several series broadcast over three different networks by two sponsors from 1935 to 1938. Popeye and most of the major supporting characters were first featured in a thrice-weekly 15-minute radio program, \"Popeye the Sailor\", which starred Detmar Poppen as Popeye along with most of the major supporting characters—Olive Oyl (Olive Lamoy), Wimpy (Charles Lawrence), Bluto (Jackson Beck) and Swee'Pea (Mae Questel). In the first episode, Popeye adopted Sonny (Jimmy Donnelly), a character later known as Matey the Newsboy. This program was broadcast Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday nights at 7:15pm. September 10, 1935 through March 28, 1936 on the NBC Red Network (87 episodes), initially sponsored by Wheatena, a whole-wheat breakfast cereal, which would routinely replace the spinach references. Music was provided by Victor Irwin's Cartoonland Band. Announcer Kelvin Keech sang (to composer Lerner's \"Popeye\" theme) \"Wheatena is his diet / He asks you to try it / With Popeye the sailor man.\" Wheatena paid King Features Syndicate $1,200 per week.\n\nThe show was next broadcast Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 7:15 to 7:30pm on WABC and ran from August 31, 1936 to February 26, 1937 (78 episodes). Floyd Buckley played Popeye, and Miriam Wolfe portrayed both Olive Oyl and the Sea Hag. Once again, reference to spinach was conspicuously absent. Instead, Popeye sang, \"Wheatena's me diet / I ax ya to try it / I'm Popeye the Sailor Man\".\n\nThe third series was sponsored by the maker of Popsicles three nights a week for 15 minutes at 6:15 pm on CBS from May 2, 1938 through July 29, 1938.\n\nOf the three series, only 20 of the 204 episodes are known to be preserved.\n\nPopeye was recently featured on the \"Brad and John: Mornings on KISM\" \"When Animals Attack\" segment.\n\nDirector Robert Altman used the character in \"Popeye\", a 1980 live-action musical feature film, starring Robin Williams as Popeye (his first starring movie role), Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl, and Paul L. Smith as Bluto, with songs by Harry Nilsson and Van Dyke Parks. The script was by Jules Feiffer, who adapted the 1971 Nostalgia Press book of 1936 strips for his screenplay, thus retaining many of the characters created by Segar. A co-production of Paramount Pictures and Walt Disney Productions, the movie was filmed almost entirely on Malta, in the village of Mellieħa on the northwest coast of the island. The set is now a tourist attraction called Popeye Village. The US box office earnings were double the film's budget, making it a success.\n\nIn March 2010, it was reported that Sony Pictures Animation is developing a 3D computer-animated Popeye film, with Avi Arad producing it. In November 2011, Sony Pictures Animation announced that Jay Scherick and David Ronn, the writers of \"The Smurfs\", are writing the screenplay for the film. In June 2012, it was reported that Genndy Tartakovsky had been set to direct the feature, which he planned to make \"as artful and unrealistic as possible.\" In November 2012, Sony Pictures Animation set the release date for September 26, 2014, which was, in May 2013, pushed back to 2015. In March 2014, Sony Pictures Animation updated its slate, scheduling the film for 2016, and announcing Tartakovsky as the director of \"Hotel Transylvania 2\", which he was directing concurrently with \"Popeye\". On September 18, 2014, Tartakovsky revealed an \"animation test\" footage, about which he said, \"It's just something that kind of represents what we want to do. I couldn't be more excited by how it turned out.\" In March 2015, Tartakovsky announced that despite the well-received test footage, he was no longer working on the project, and would instead direct \"Can You Imagine?\", which is based on his own original idea. Nevertheless, Sony Pictures Animation stated the project still remains in active development. In January 2016, it was announced that T.J. Fixman would write the film.\n\n\nFrom early on, Popeye was heavily merchandised. Everything from soap to razor blades to spinach was available with Popeye's likeness on it. Most of these items are rare and sought-after by collectors, but some merchandise is still being produced.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal folklore in Chester, Illinois, Segar's hometown, claims that Frank “Rocky” Fiegel (b. in Poland, January 27, 1868) was the real-life inspiration for the character Popeye. He had a prominent chin, sinewy physique, characteristic pipe, and a propensity and agile skill for fist-fighting. Fiegel died on March 24, 1947 never having married. His gravestone has the image of Popeye engraved on it. The town of Chester erected a statue of Popeye in Fiegel’s honor, which still stands today. According to Popeye historian Michael Brooks, Segar regularly sent money to Fiegel.\n\nSeparate hometown residents of Chester also are claimed to have served as inspiration for two other Segar characters including Dora Pascal, an uncommonly tall, angular lady who ran a general store in town. She even donned a hair bun close to her neckline. William “Windy Bill” Schuchert, a rather rotund man who owned the local opera house, was the seed for the character J. Wellington Wimpy. He would even send out his employees to purchase hamburgers for him between performances at a local tavern named Wiebusch’s, the same tavern that Fiegal would frequent and engage in fistfights. \n\nIn 2015, businessman Greg Morena refuted the claim that Popeye originated in Chester, Illinois. Instead, he stated that Santa Monica, California was the birthplace of the character and that a Norwegian sailor by the name of Olaf “cap” Olsen served as the impetus for the character.\nResearch presented in Jim Harris’ 2009 “Santa Monica Pier: A Century of the Last Great Pleasure Pier” raised the idea that while living in Santa Monica, Segar based the physical attributes on Olsen; even though Harris never made a definitive claim. \n\nCulturally, many consider Popeye a precursor to the superheroes who would eventually come to dominate US comic books.\n\nSuch has been Popeye's cultural impact that the medical profession sometimes refers to the biceps bulge symptomatic of a tendon rupture as the \"Popeye muscle.\" Note, however, that under normal (non-spinach-influenced) conditions, Popeye has pronounced muscles of the \"forearm\", not of the biceps.\n\nIn 1973, Cary Bates created Captain Strong, a takeoff of Popeye, for DC Comics, as a way of having two cultural icons – Superman and (a proxy of) Popeye – meet.\n\nThe 1981 Nintendo videogame Donkey Kong, which introduced its eponymous character and Nintendo's unofficial company mascot Mario to the world, was originally planned to be a Popeye game. Mario (then known as Jumpman) was originally supposed to be Popeye, Donkey Kong was originally Bluto, and the character Pauline was originally Olive Oyl, but when Nintendo was unable to acquire the rights to use the actual franchise characters, it decided to create original characters instead. \n\nThe 1988 Walt Disney/Touchstone Pictures film \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" featured many classic cartoon characters, and the absence of Popeye was noted by some critics. Popeye (along with Bluto and Olive Oyl) actually had a cameo role planned for the film. However, since the Popeye cartoons were based on a comic strip, Disney found they had to pay licensing fees to both King Features Syndicate and MGM/UA. MGM/UA's pre-May 1986 library (which included Popeye) was being purchased by Turner Entertainment at the time, which created legal complications; thus, the rights could not be obtained and Popeye's cameo was dropped from the film.\n\nThe Popeye was a popular dance in the dance craze era of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Originating in New Orleans around 1962, the Popeye was performed by shuffling and moving one's arms, placing one arm behind and one arm in front and alternating them, going through the motion of raising a pipe up to the mouth, and alternate sliding or pushing one foot back in the manner of ice skating, similar to motions exhibited by the cartoon character. According to music historian Robert Pruter, the Popeye was even more popular than The Twist in New Orleans. The dance was associated with and/or referenced to in several songs, including Eddie Bo's \"Check Mr. Popeye,\" Chris Kenner's \"Something You Got\" and \"Land of a Thousand Dances,\" Frankie Ford's \"You Talk Too Much,\" Ernie K-Doe's \"Popeye Joe,\" Huey \"Piano\" Smith's \"Popeye,\" and Harvey Fuqua's \"Any Way You Wanta.\" A compilation of 23 Popeye dance songs was released in 1996 under the title \"New Orleans Popeye Party.\" \n\nInitially Popeye's chief superhuman characteristic was his indestructibility, rather than super strength, which was attributed to his having rubbed the head of Bernice the Whiffle Hen numerous times after being shot. Popeye later attributed his strength to spinach. The popularity of Popeye helped boost spinach sales. Using Popeye as a role model for healthier eating may work; a 2010 study revealed that children increased their vegetable consumption after watching Popeye cartoons. The spinach-growing community of Crystal City, Texas, erected a statue of the character in recognition of Popeye's positive effects on the spinach industry. There is another Popeye statue in Segar's hometown, Chester, Illinois, and statues in Springdale and Alma, Arkansas (which claims to be \"The Spinach Capital of the World\"), at canning plants of Allen Canning, which markets Popeye-branded canned spinach. In addition to Allen Canning's Popeye spinach, Popeye Fresh Foods markets bagged, fresh spinach with Popeye characters on the package. In 2006, when spinach contaminated with \"E. coli\" was accidentally sold to the public, many editorial cartoonists lampooned the affair by featuring Popeye in their cartoons.\n\nA frequently circulated story claims that Fleischer's choice of spinach to give Popeye strength was based on faulty calculations of its iron content. In the story, a scientist misplaced a decimal point in an 1870 measurement of spinach's iron content, leading to an iron value ten times higher than it should have been. This faulty measurement was not noticed until the 1930s. While this story has gone through longstanding circulation, recent study has shown that this is a myth, and it was chosen for its vitamin A content alone; see Spinach: Popeye and iron.\n\nThe strip is also responsible for popularizing, although not inventing, the word \"goon\" (meaning a thug or lackey); goons in Popeye's world were large humanoids with indistinctly drawn faces that were particularly known for being used as muscle and slave labor by Popeye's nemesis, the Sea Hag. One particular goon, the aforementioned female named Alice, was an occasional recurring character in the animated shorts, but she was usually a fairly nice character.\n\nEugene the Jeep was introduced in the comic strip on March 13, 1936. Two years later the term \"jeep wagons\" was in use, later shortened to simply \"jeep\" with widespread World War II usage and then trademarked by Willys-Overland as \"Jeep\".\n\nThe Popeye Picnic is held every year in Chester, Illinois on the weekend after Labor Day. Popeye fans attend from across the globe, including a visit by a film crew from South Korea in 2004. The one-eyed sailor's hometown strives to entertain devotees of all ages.\n\nIn honor of Popeye’s 75th anniversary, the Empire State Building illuminated its notable tower lights green the weekend of January 16–18, 2004 as a tribute to the icon’s love of spinach. This special lighting marked the only time the Empire State Building ever celebrated the anniversary/birthday of a comic strip character.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Every initial DNS lookup requires inquiring the DNS server belonging to RadioDNS Ltd. Having a station listed on this DNS server costs $10 a year. At the moment (2018) the fee is waived.\n\nThe project is an open standard, initially created by a series of broadcasters and manufacturers.\n\nRadioDNS was originally created as a collaborative project between Global Radio (at that time called GCap Media) and the BBC, to investigate creating a mechanism for linking Broadcast Radio and IP delivered webservices.\n\nThe concept was first presented to the WorldDMB Technical Committee in Munich in May 2008. Interest in the project grew, to the extent where it was necessary to formalise the project.\n\nThe First General Meeting of RadioDNS was hosted by the European Broadcasting Union in Geneva in October 2009 \n\nThe Second General Meeting of RadioDNS (held on 16 February 2010 in Geneva) adopted the Statutes, Intellectual Rights Policy, Trust Model and Membership Process, and thus effectively established RadioDNS as a not-for-profit organisation.\n\nThe standard supports several radio bearers including VHF/FM, DAB, DRM and AMSS. Using a standardised format, a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is constructed and queried. This returns a CNAME record known as the \"authoritative FQDN\", which is a domain that represents the requested radio service. From this domain, SRV record lookups can be performed to verify the availability and location of various other applications that utilise RadioDNS.\n\nFor example, an FM radio service is identified by its RDS parameters. To identify a radio service on 95.8 MHz with a country code of E1 and the PI code C479, the following FQDN is constructed:\nQuerying this domain returns a CNAME record:\nThis CNAME record can then be used to look up SRV records that advertise the availability of applications based upon RadioDNS (in this example an application identified by the name radiovis):\n\nThe linking of broadcast media with IP, as RadioDNS enables, allows additional functionality on receivers.\n\nOne example is RadioVIS, which is an open standard for accompanying visuals for radio broadcasts. The Sensia, manufactured by PURE, is an example of a receiver with this functionality built-in. Demonstrations have also been made of RadioVIS running on a mobile phone.\n\nOther examples being worked on by the RadioDNS project include RadioEPG, a way of obtaining additional station and programme information; and RadioTAG, a way for a listener to request more information, or simply bookmark a place, in a live broadcast.\n\nRadioText+ (RT+) in RDS (FM) and DynamicLabel Plus (DL+) in DAB already provide content type \"Programme.PROGRAMME.HOMEPAGE\" (and possibly \"Info.INFO.URL\") which allows radio stations to pass along their website address to receivers without the need for an additional parallel -- and in the future potentially paid -- listing on the DNS server of RadioDNS Limited.\n\n"}
{"id": "32786460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32786460", "title": "SkyDrift", "text": "SkyDrift\n\nSkyDrift is a 2011 airplane racing video game developed by Digital Reality. It was self-published by the developer on the Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 3 platforms. The Xbox 360 version was published by Bandai Namco Partners.\n\nThe game features multiple game modes which are primarily focused on combat racing. Two downloadable content packs have been released which add additional planes and two new game modes. The game was well received, with aggregate scores ranging in the mid-to-high 70% range. Critics generally felt that the gameplay was strong, that the controls were responsive, and that the online multiplayer was excellent, though multiple reviewers cited disappointment in the lack of any local multiplayer.\n\nIn \"SkyDrift\" players pilot one of several airplanes in a fictional racing competition. Gameplay is similar to other airplane racing games such as \"Plane Crazy\" and the flight mode of \"Diddy Kong Racing\". The game features 33 single player challenge stages as well as online multiplayer. While the primary focus is racing, dogfights play a large part in some of \"SkyDrift\"s game modes. Players are rewarded with boost, which provides a temporary burst of speed, by flying acrobatically, low to the ground, or by taking down opponents. Planes and their separate liveries are unlocked as players progress and complete specified challenges. As players progress on a given course they are sometimes presented with progressing environment hazards such as falling rocks or an avalanche.\n\nThree game modes are included with the game, with two more available via downloadable content. The first game mode, Power Race, is a hybrid of both racing and combat. Players can collect powerups to give their planes different abilities. These abilities include such things as missiles, machine guns, mines, or an EMP blast. The goal is to use whatever means necessary to achieve the highest finishing rank at the end of a given race. The second mode is focused solely on racing. Entitled Speed Race, this mode omits all weapons and powerups. In their place are rings scattered throughout the course. Flying through these rings provides the plane with an extra burst of speed, and flying through multiple in succession will multiply that speed. As with Power Race the goal is to finish the race in as high a rank as possible.\n\nThe third mode included with the game is known as Survivor. Gameplay is similar to Power Race, however after a given time the racer in last place is eliminated. Powerups are included in this mode and can be used to increase one's place, thus avoiding elimination. The race is over when all human players are eliminated or a human player is takes first place. The two downloadable modes, Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch, are focused solely on dogfights with other players. These modes are played in three new arenas and are limited to online gameplay.\n\nThe developers stated that they wanted to keep a certain amount of realism to the setting of their game. \"It's not science fiction, it's like racing on the most beautiful places on earth\" stated Senior Game Designer Peter Petrekovits. Development began with low polygon versions of the game's three settings to hone gameplay, which were later upgraded with details created from primitive shapes. Artists then took these settings and provided finalized environments while course designers laid out the specific elements to each race. Multiple routes were created in each setting allowing for several course configurations. Some of the plane designs were inspired from real-world fighter planes, but each were evolved from initial concept art into their current designs. Petrekovits elaborated on their design. \"These planes are not real life models. You might see some part[s] of them [that are] familiar, but these are whole new concepts\". Petrekovits further clarified that though the planes can be equipped with weaponry via powerups, they \"are not military planes whatsoever, [they] are racing planes.\" Two members of the game's development team were graduate airplane technicians.\n\nTwo downloadable content packs have been released, both of which are actually included in the main game but require premium unlock keys to be accessed. The first, entitled \"Extreme Fighters Pack\", was released on September 21, 2011 and adds three additional planes, the Vanguard, Sparrow X1 and Triwing Vintage. The first two planes feature a design similar to modern day fighter jets, while the latter focuses on older, Red Baron-style planes such as the triplane. The second pack, entitled \"Gladiator Pack\" brings six new combat arenas into the game. These new levels have a focus entirely on dogfights, and have all racing aspects removed.\n\nThe PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of \"SkyDrift\" received \"generally favorable reviews\", while the PC version received \"average\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. According to Gamasutra's analysis \"SkyDrift\" moved over 5,100 units on the Xbox 360 and 4,700 units on the PlayStation 3 during the month of its release. The Xbox 360 version moved over 7,500 units as of year-end 2011.\n\nThe game's visuals were well received by critics. IGN reviewer Stephanie Lee lauded the visuals. She stated that the graphics are \"beautiful detail and [have] a warm color palette\". Robert Workman of GameZone also gave high marks for \"SkyDrift\"s graphics. He felt that the planes were well modeled and that the environments provided \"a smooth looking package.\" GameSpot's Sean Evans called the graphics \"visually striking, with impressive levels of detail.\" He did cite occasional issues with locating powerups, which he attributed to \"overly saturated lighting effects\". The game's soundtrack was a point of mediocrity among critics. IGN's Lee stated that \"SkyDrift\"s soundtrack \"doesn't stand out nor does it detract from the overall experience,\" a sentiment shared with GameZone's Workman.\n\nGameplay was also well received. \"Eurogamer\"s Kristan Reed noted that the Xbox 360 version's \"controls are spot-on, and it's easy to pick up\". Reed, however, felt that the game can lose its luster for some players quickly due to the repeated environments used throughout the game. Terry Terrones of \"GamePro\" stated that the game was \"the definition of easy to play and tough to master\". GameSpot's Evans noted that the game's online multiplayer was \"lag free\" and was the game's \"shining jewel\", however he expressed disappointment with the fact that it did not feature a local multiplayer. IGN's Lee also praised the online multiplayer, but was disappointed in the lack of local play. She did concede, however, that during single player events \"the A.I. still knows how to throw down.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17569583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17569583", "title": "Sociology of literature", "text": "Sociology of literature\n\nThe sociology of literature is a subfield of the sociology of culture. It studies the social production of literature and its social implications. A notable example is Pierre Bourdieu's 1992 \"Les Règles de L'Art: Genèse et Structure du Champ Littéraire\", translated by Susan Emanuel as \"Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field\" (1996).\n\nNone of the 'founding fathers' of sociology produced a detailed study of literature, but they did develop ideas that were subsequently applied to literature by others. Karl Marx's theory of ideology has been directed at literature by Pierre Macherey, Terry Eagleton and Fredric Jameson. Max Weber's theory of modernity as cultural rationalisation, which he applied to music, was later applied to all the arts, literature included, by Frankfurt School writers such as Theodor Adorno and Jürgen Habermas. Emile Durkheim's view of sociology as the study of externally defined social facts was redirected towards literature by Robert Escarpit. Bourdieu's work is clearly indebted to Marx, Weber and Durkheim\n\nAn important first step in the sociology of literature was taken by Georg Lukács's \"The Theory of the Novel\", first published in German in 1916, in the \"Zeitschrift fur Aesthetik und Allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft\". In 1920 it was republished in book form and this version strongly influenced the Frankfurt School. A second edition, published in 1962, was similarly influential on French structuralism. \"The Theory of the Novel\" argued that, whilst the classical epic poem had given form to a totality of life pregiven in reality by the social integration of classical civilisation, the modern novel had become 'the epic of an age in which the extensive totality of life is no longer directly given'. The novel form is therefore organised around the problematic hero in pursuit of problematic values within a problematic world. \n\nLukács's second distinctive contribution to the sociology of literature was \"The Historical Novel\", written in German but first published in Russian in 1937, which appeared in English translation in 1962. Here, Lukács argued that the early 19th century historical novel's central achievement was to represent realistically the differences between pre-capitalist past and capitalist present. This was not a matter of individual talent, but of collective historical experience, because the French Revolution and the revolutionary and Napoleonic wars had made history for the first time a mass experience. He went on to argue that the success of the 1848 revolutions led to the decline of the historical novel into 'decorative monumentalization' and the 'making private of history'. The key figures in the historical novel were thus those of the early 19th century, especially Sir Walter Scott.\n\nLukács was an important influence on Lucien Goldmann's \"Towards a Sociology of the Novel\", Alan Swingewood's discussion of the sociology of the novel in Part 3 of Laurenson and Swingewood's \"The Sociology of Literature\" and Franco Moretti's \"Signs Taken for Wonders\".\n\nFounded in 1923, the Institute for Social Research at the University of Frankfurt developed a distinctive kind of 'critical sociology' indebted to Marx, Weber and Freud. Leading Frankfurt School critics who worked on literature included Adorno, Walter Benjamin and Leo Löwenthal. Adorno's \"Notes to Literature\", Benjamin's \"The Origin of German Tragic Drama\" and Löwentahl's \"Literature and the Image of Man\" were each influential studies in the sociology of literature. Löwenthal continued this work at the University of California, Berkeley, during the 1950s.\n\nAdorno's \"Notes to Literature\" is a collection of essays, the most influential of which is probably 'On Lyric Poetry and Society'. It argued that poetic thought is a reaction against the commodification and reification of modern life, citing Goethe and Baudelaire as examples. Benjamin's \"The Origin of German Tragic Drama\" argued that the extreme 'sovereign violence' of the 16th and 17th century German 'Trauerspiel' (literally mourning play, less literally tragedy) playwrights expressed the historical realities of princely power far better than had classical tragedy. \n\nHabermas succeeded Adorno to the Chair of Sociology and Philosophy at Frankfurt. Habermas's first major work, \"Strukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit\" was published in German in 1962, and in English translation as \"The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere\" in 1989. It attempted to explain the socio-historical emergence of middle-class public opinion in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Developing a new kind of institutional sociology of literature, it argued that the public sphere had been organised around literary salons in France, learned and literary societies in Germany, and coffee houses in England. These institutions sustained the early novel, newspaper and periodical press.\n\nPeter Bürger was Professor of French and Comparative Literature at the University of Bremen. His \"Theorie der Avantgarde\" was published in German in 1974 and in English translation in 1984. Like Habermas, Bürger was interested in the institutional sociology of literature and art. He postulated a historical typology of aesthetic social relations, measured along three main axes, the function of the artwork, its mode of production and its mode of reception. This gave him three main kinds of art, sacral, courtly and bourgeois. Bourgeois art, he argued, had as its function individual self-understanding and was produced and received individually. It became a celebration in form of the liberation of art from religion, the court and, eventually, even the bourgeoisie. Modernist art was thus an autonomous social 'institution', the preserve of an increasingly autonomous intellectual class. The 'historical avant-garde' of the inter-war years developed as a movement within and against modernism, he concluded, as an ultimately unsuccessful revolt against precisely this autonomy.\n\nHabermas adopts a very similar approach in his own account of the avant-garde.\n\nRobert Escarpit was Professor of Comparative Literature at the University of Bordeaux and founder of the Centre for the Sociology of Literary Facts. His works included \"The Sociology of Literature\", published in French in 1958 and in English translation in 1971, and \"The Book Revolution\", published in French in 1965 and in English in 1966. In Durkheimian fashion, Escarpit aimed to concern himself only with the externally defined 'social facts' of literature, especially those registered in the book trade. His focus fell on the 'community of writers', understood in aggregate as 'generations' and 'teams'. He extended the definition of literature to include all 'non-functional' writing and also insisted that literary success resulted from 'a convergence of intentions between author and reader'.\n\nAnalogously empirical studies of the sociology of the book trade were carried out by Lewis Coser in the United States and Peter H. Mann in Britain.\n\nLucien Febvre and Henri-Jean Martin's \"L'Apparition du livre\", first published in French 1958 and in English translation as \"The Coming of the Book\" in 1976, is strictly speaking a work of social history (Febvre was a leading figure in the \"Annales\" School of historiography). But it is deeply sociological in character - \"Annales\" history was determinedly social scientific - and provides a systematic account of the long-run development of the European book trade (the period covered is 1450–1800).\n\nLucien Goldmann was Director of Studies at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris and founding Director of the Centre for the Sociology of Literature at the Free University of Brussels. Like Escarpit, Goldmann was influenced by Durkheim: hence, his definition of the subject matter of sociology as the 'study of the facts of consciousness'. But he was also interested in developing a sociology of the text. The central task of the literary sociologist, he argued, was to bring out the objective meaning of the literary work by placing it in its historical context, studied as a whole. \n\nGoldmann defined the creating subject as transindividual, that is, as an instance of Durkheim's 'collective consciousness'. Following Marx and Lukács, however, Goldmann also assumed that group consciousness was normally class consciousnesses. The mediating agency between a social class and the work of literature then became the 'world vision', which binds the individual members of a social class together. \"Le Dieu caché\", his study of Blaise Pascal and Jean Racine, was published in French in 1955 and in English translation as \"The Hidden God\" in 1964. It identified 'structural homologies' between the Jansenist 'tragic vision', the textual structures of Pascal's \"Pensées\" and Racine's plays, and the social position of the seventeenth-century 'noblesse de robe'. Goldmann's structuralism was 'genetic' because it sought to trace the genesis of literary structures in extra-literary phenomena.\n\nIn 1964 Goldmann published \"Pour une Sociologie du Roman\" translated by Alan Sheridan as \"Towards a Sociology of the Novel\" in 1974. Like Lukács, Goldmann sees the novel as revolving around the problematic hero's search for authentic values in a degraded society. But Goldmann also postulates a 'rigorous homology' between the literary form of the novel and the economic form of the commodity. The early novel, he argues, is concerned with individual biography and the problematic hero, but, as competitive capitalism evolves into monopoly capitalism, the problematic hero progressively disappears. The period between the First and Second World Wars witnesses a temporary experiment with the community as collective hero: Goldmann's example is André Malraux. But the main line of development is characterised by the effort to write the novel of 'the absence of subjects'. Here, Goldmann's example is the \"nouveau roman\" of Alain Robbe-Grillet and Nathalie Sarraute. \n\nAndrew Milner's \"John Milton and the English Revolution\" (1981) is essentially an application of Goldmann's genetic structuralism to the study of seventeenth-century English literature.\n\nGoldmann's sociology of literature remains significant in itself and as a source of inspiration, both positive and negative, to the kind of 'sociocriticism' developed by Edmond Cros, Pierre Zima and their co-workers in France and Canada.\n\nMarx used the term ideology to denote the inner connectedness of culture, including literature, and class. The philosopher Louis Althusser elaborated on this notion in the early 1970s, arguing that ideology functions so as to constitute biological individuals as social 'subjects' by representing their imaginary relation to their real conditions of existence. \n\nFor Althusser himself art was not ideology. But his theory was applied to literature by Macherey in France, Eagleton in Britain and Jameson in the United States. The central novelty of Eagleton's \"Criticism and Ideology\" was its argument that literature could be understood as 'producing' ideology, in the sense of performing it. Jameson's \"The Political Unconscious\" argued that literary analysis can be focussed on three distinct levels, 'text', 'ideologeme' and 'ideology of form', each of which has its socio-historical corollary, in the equivalent 'semantic horizon' of political history, society and mode of production. The version of ideology Jameson applies to all three levels is essentially Althusserian. The novelty of his position, however, was to argue for a 'double hermeneutic' simultaneously concerned with ideology and utopia.\n\nMacherey, Eagleton and Jameson were literary critics by profession, but their applications of ideology-critique to literature are sociological in character, insofar as they seek to explain literary phenomena in extra-literary terms.\n\nBourdieu was Professor of Sociology at the Collège de France and Director of the Centre de Sociologie Européenne. His first major contribution to the sociology of literature (and other arts) was \"La Distinction\", published in French in 1979 and in English translation in 1984. It is based on detailed sociological surveys and ethnographic observation of the social distribution of cultural preferences. Bourdieu identified three main zones of taste, 'legitimate', 'middle-brow' and 'popular', which he found to be dominant respectively in the educated sections of the dominant class, the middle classes and the working classes. He described legitimate taste as centred on an 'aesthetic disposition' to assert the primacy of form over function. The 'popular aesthetic', by contrast, is based on continuity between art and life and 'a deep-rooted demand for participation'. Hence, its hostility to representations of objects that in real life are either ugly or immoral. Artistic and social 'distinction' are inextricably interrelated, he concluded, because the 'pure gaze' implies a break with ordinary attitudes towards the world and, as such, is a 'social break'.\n\n\"The Rules of Art\" is more specifically focussed on literature, especially the significance of Gustave Flaubert for the making of modern French literature. Bourdieu postulated a model of 'the field of cultural production' as structured externally in relation to the 'field of power' and internally in relation to two 'principles of hierarchization', the heteronomous and the autonomous. The modern literary and artistic field is a site of contestation between the heteronomous principle, subordinating art to economy, and the autonomous, resisting such subordination. In Bourdieu's map of the French literary field in the late nineteenth century, the most autonomous genre, that is, the least economically profitable - poetry - is to the left, whilst the most heteronomous, the most economically profitable - drama - is to the right, with the novel located somewhere in between. Additionally, higher social status audiences govern the upper end of the field and lower status audiences the lower end. Flaubert's distinctive achievement in \"L'Éducation sentimentale\" was, in Bourdieu's account, to have understood and defined the rules of modern autonomous art.\n\nOne of the earliest English-language contributions to the sociology of literature is \"The Rise of the Novel\" (1957) by Ian Watt, Professor of English at Stanford University. For Watt, the novel's 'novelty' was its 'formal realism', the idea 'that the novel is a full and authentic report of human experience'. His paradigmatic instances are Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson and Henry Fielding. Watt argued that the novel's concern with realistically described relations between ordinary individuals, ran parallel to the more general development of philosophical realism, middle-class economic individualism and Puritan individualism. He also argued that the form addressed the interests and capacities of the new middle-class reading public and the new book trade evolving in response to them. As tradesmen themselves, Defoe and Richardson had only to 'consult their own standards' to know that their work would appeal to a large audience.\n\nRaymond Williams was Professor of Drama at Cambridge University and one of the founders of contemporary cultural studies. He described his own distinctive approach as a 'cultural materialism', by which he meant a theory of culture 'as a (social and material) productive process' and of the arts 'as social uses of material means of production'. This is a clearly sociological, as distinct from literary-critical, perspective: hence, its most general exposition in the United States as \"The Sociology of Culture\" and in Britain as \"Culture\", a 1981 title in Fontana's New Sociology series. Although Williams's interests ranged widely across the whole field of literary and cultural studies, his major work was concentrated on literature and drama. He was thus a sociologist of culture, specialising in the sociology of literature. \n\nIn \"The Long Revolution\" (1961), Williams developed pioneering accounts of the sociology of the book trade, the sociology of authorship and the sociology of the novel. In \"The English Novel from Dickens to Lawrence\" (1970), he argued that the modern novel articulated a distinctively modern 'structure of feeling', the key problem of which was the 'knowable community'. In \"The Country and the City\" (1973) he developed a social history of English country-house poetry, aimed at demystifying the idealisations of rural life contained in the literature: 'It is what the poems are: not country life but social compliment; the familiar hyperboles of the aristocracy and its attendants'. His \"Marxism and Literature\" (1977) - simultaneously a critique of both Marxism and 'Literature' - is an extensive formal elaboration of Williams's own theoretical system. \n\nAlan Sinfield's \"Faultlines: Cultural Materialism and the Politics of Dissident Reading\" (1992) and \"Literature, Politics and Culture in Postwar Britain\" (1997) are both clearly indebted to Williams. So, too, is Andrew Milner's \"Literature, Culture and Society\" (2005).\n\nFranco Moretti was, by turn, Professor of English Literature at the University of Salerno, of Comparative Literature at Verona University and of English and Comparative Literature at Stanford University. His first book, \"Signs Taken for Wonders\" (1983) was subtitled \"Essays in the Sociology of Literary Forms\" and was essentially qualitative in method. His later work, however, became progressively more quantitative. \n\nApplying Immanuel Wallerstein's world-systems theory to literature, Moretti argued, in \"Atlas of the European Novel\" (1998), that the nineteenth-century literary economy had comprised 'three Europes', with France and Britain at the core, most countries in the periphery and a variable semiperiphery located in between. Measured by the volume of translations in national bibliographies, he found that French novelists were more successful in the Catholic South and British in the Protestant North, but that the whole continent nonetheless read the leading figures from both. London and Paris 'rule the entire continent for over a century', he concluded, publishing half or more of all European novels. \n\nMoretti's theses prompted much subsequent controversy, collected together in Christopher Prendergast's edited collection \"Debating World Literature\" (2004). Moretti himself expanded on the argument in his \"Distant Reading\" (2013).\n\nBuilding on earlier work in the production of culture, reception aesthetics and cultural capital, the sociology of literature has recently concentrated on readers' construction of meaning. New developments include studying the relationship between literature and group identities; concerning institutional and reader-response analysis; reintroducing the role of intentions of the author in literature; reconsidering the role of ethics and morality in literature and developing a clearer understanding of how literature is and is not like other media.\n\nThe sociology of literature has also recently taken an interest in the global inequality between First-World and Third-World authors, where the latter tend to be strongly dependent on the editorial decisions of publishers in Paris, London or New York and are often excluded from participation in the global literary market.\n\nThe journal New Literary History devoted a special issue to new approaches to the sociology of literature in Spring 2010.\n\n"}

His farces, parables, one-act-plays and adaptations were inspired by the theatre of the absurd and the works of Ionesco, Giraudoux and Beckett. His monumental drama \"Merlin oder das wüste Land\", which was premiered in 1981 in Düsseldorf, has been compared to Goethe's \"Faust\". Some critics see it as the first major drama of the 1980s. In his tribute to Tankred Dorst on the occasion of the conferment of the Georg Büchner Prize in 1990, Georg Hensel remarked that Dorst's plays all have a direct connection to the present: \"For 30 years Dorst's plays have responded to the great transformations. He has always been a companion to the times.\"\n\nDorst first directed the \"Ring of the Nibelung\" in Bayreuth in 2006.\n\nTankred Dorst was born in Oberlind near Sonneberg, Thuringia.\n\nConscripted into the German army as a pupil at the age of 17, he was soon captured and incarcerated as a prisoner of war. Until 1947 he remained in British and American hands. By the time he was released from war captivity, his birthplace had become part of the Soviet sector of Germany. He met his family in West Germany and completed his schooling. In 1950 he began studying German literature, art history and theatre in Bamberg and Munich. Together with composer Wilhelm Killmayer he founded the marionette theatre \"Das kleine Spiel\", for which he wrote his first plays. After breaking off his studies, he worked in various capacities in film, radio and publishing houses.\n\nHis first major plays were performed in 1960 in Lübeck, Mannheim and Heidelberg. Since then, his plays have been performed in the whole world. Dorst's work has been recognized with many prizes and distinctions, including the Gerhart Hauptmann Prize (1964), Prize of the City of Florence (1970), Literature Prize of the Bayerische Akademie der Künste (1983), Mülheimer Dramatikerpreis (1989), Georg Büchner Prize (1990), E.T.A. Hoffmann Prize (1996) and the city of Zurich's Max Frisch Prize (1998). In 2006, he was awarded the Samuel Bogumil Linde Prize. He was awarded the European Prize for Literature (2008). Dorst held visiting professorships at universities in Germany, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nDorst died on June 1, 2017.\n"}
{"id": "8089030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8089030", "title": "Tek Jansen", "text": "Tek Jansen\n\nTek Jansen is a fictional character featured on \"The Colbert Report\" and in a comic book series published by Oni Press. Jansen originated as a recurring joke in the form of a supposed self-published science fiction novel on the \"Report\", reportedly as a parody of Bill O'Reilly's 1998 novel, \"Those Who Trespass\". The character later appeared on the show in a series of animated shorts entitled \"Stephen Colbert Presents Stephen Colbert's Alpha Squad 7: A Tek Jansen Adventure\", with Jansen voiced by Stephen Colbert, and in 2007 became the protagonist of a five-part comic series.\n\nAn agent for the elite Alpha Squad 7, Jansen is portrayed as heroic, powerful and irresistible to women: essentially, he is an idealized version of the \"Report\"'s host, who supposedly created him.\n\nJansen was introduced on \"The Colbert Report\" on the October 26, 2005 episode as the protagonist of Stephen Colbert's fictitious self-published 1,800-page novel, \"Stephen Colbert's Alpha Squad 7: Lady Nocturne: A Tek Jansen Adventure\". The novel became a recurring joke, with Colbert occasionally discussing the manuscript and reading passages while lamenting that no publisher has distributed the book yet. Although a copy of the novel was seen on the show and at the Stephen Colbert Museum and Gift Shop in Tuscumbia, Colbert County, Alabama, the former copy is actually \"The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia Of Rock & Roll\" with a new cover glued over the original, and the latter copy was merely blank pages. A number of chapters were made available on the show's official website, ColbertNation.com. In the show's April 3, 2008 episode, Colbert claimed that a total of twenty publishers had turned down the novel.\n\nOn August 8, 2006, the \"Report\" debuted a series of three to four-minute-long animated shorts entitled \"Stephen Colbert Presents: Stephen Colbert's Alpha Squad 7: The New Tek Jansen Adventures\", allegedly in response to a lack of publisher interest in the novel. Jansen is voiced by Colbert himself.\n\nThe first six episodes were designed, animated, and produced by J.J. Sedelmaier Productions and producer Samantha Scharff. They tend to be formulaic in nature, regularly working in Jansen's signature exclamations (such as \"Solar Plexus!\" and \"Parum-pum!\") and reference to his having had \"hundreds of girlfriends\". Jansen typically both saves the day and seduces every woman in the story, villains included, and the episode invariably ends on a cliffhanger with a naked Jansen in mortal danger.\n\nThe entire first season was included in a bonus disc accompanying copies of \"The Best of The Colbert Report\".\n\nOn September 12, 2007, the \"Report\" debuted the first of a projected eight new Tek Jansen episodes. This second series, which was being produced by FlickerLab, covers the early history of Jansen, from his humble beginnings as a young, physically awkward space dog vendor. Unlike Series One, which has little to no continuity between episodes, Series Two followed a continuous narrative. Though projected as an eight-part series, no new episodes were completed after episode 3 debuted in January, 2009.\n\nTek Jansen made a brief cameo appearance in Colbert's music video of Daft Punk's \"Get Lucky\", aired on August 6, 2013. According to Colbert, the video was produced in anticipation of Daft Punk's appearance on that evening's show; however, the band was forced to cancel at the last minute due to a conflict with the MTV Video Music Awards. Robin Thicke performed instead, but Colbert aired the video as originally planned.\n\nTek Jansen made a final cameo appearance on the very last episode of \"The Colbert Report\" on December 18, 2014, as part of a montage of a number of celebrities singing \"We'll Meet Again\". Jansen sings it in a stilted way reminiscent of William Shatner's famous 1977 spoken word performance of \"Rocket Man\".\n\nOn June 24, 2006, Comedy Central announced that Oni Press would publish a five-part comic book adaptation of the Tek Jansen novel as \"Stephen Colbert's Tek Jansen Adventures\", a multi-part series of comics. The first issue was published on July 11, 2007. The second had been scheduled for a December 26, 2007 release, but was delayed due to the Writers Guild of America strike. It was finally released on July 2, 2008. Issue 3 was released on August 3, 2008. Issues 4 and 5 were released in 2009. On August 12, 2009, the five issues were collected into a 136-page graphic novel.\n\nEach comic has two stories, the first one—written by John Layman and Tom Peyer, with art by Scott Chantler—part of an ongoing serialized story, and the second one—written by Jim Massey with art by Robbi Rodriguez—a stand-alone \"backup story\".\n\nColbert and his staff were very involved in guiding the style of both the writing and the artwork. Artist Scott Chantler recalls that it was assumed the comics would follow the \"animated\" look of the cartoons, however Colbert wanted a more serious dramatic tone \"that played it as straight as he does on the show\", and the artwork was toned down to suit this theme. Chantler describes the style as similar to that of a space adventure comic from the early 1960s: \"heroic and dramatic, but still appealing and fun, and funny in spite of itself. The theory I'm going on is that this is a cool old comic of which the animated segments are silly Saturday morning versions (even though the reverse is actually true)\". Writers John Layman and Tom Peyer also recall having to tone down Jansen's character, whom they initially wrote as \"Stephen Colbert in space\", with \"a robot eagle sidekick and he was going after alien bears\". Of Colbert's contributions, Jim Massey says the most influential was his desire that the comics not contain any reference to present-day Earth.\n\nThe cover of several of the Tek Jansen comic issues are briefly shown in the September 17, 2014 episode of \"The Colbert Report\" during the segment depicting Colbert's \"Prince Hawkcat\" character at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con International.\n\nIn his youth, Tek Jansen was a shy and physically awkward space-dog vendor who worked at sport and political venues and had never even had a single girlfriend. However, after inadvertently learning of his future nemesis Thurmond Chang's sinister plans to take over the universe and witnessing the murder of the Alpha Squad agent sent to stop him, Jansen found himself unexpectedly plunged into a new adventure. In his dying moments, the Alpha Squad agent handed Tek his nano fiche with instructions to deliver it to Alpha Squad headquarters, thus setting him on a new path.\n\nFrom these humble beginnings, Jansen has become an elite agent who has had hundreds of girlfriends. He has wrestled with numerous villains, and continues to face off against Thurmond Chang and \"those affiliated with the Thurmond Chang Gang\". He also appears at one point to have had a sidekick, Porpy the Porpoise a \"zany\" space porpoise.\n\nHis sidekick, Porpy the Porpoise, is described as a \"zany\" space porpoise. While his appearances on the television series have petered out somewhat, his involvement in the graphic novel is ongoing and is included in almost all of the comics. Porpy was prominently featured in \"Porpy's story\", a short side-story in which Porpy's background is alluded to by Tek, but not told fully, as Tek becomes distracted by an adventure and forgets about Porpy altogether. In the television show Porpy is voiced by stock porpoise sounds and bubbles.\n\nDescribed by some reviewers as a \"Mary Sue\", Jansen is essentially an idealized version of Colbert's character. The cover of the fictitious novel depicts Colbert (wearing a space suit) as Jansen, and Colbert also provides the character's voice in the animated series. The animated series frequently mentions the fact that Jansen has \"obviously had hundreds of girlfriends\", and he invariably seduces and beds every woman he encounters, including his enemies. The theme song, which debuted on November 8, 2006, describes Jansen as a \"super awesome spectacular ultra-spy\", and further notes that his \"exciting exploits would sell millions of books\".\n\nChantler says he attempts to draw Jansen \"as if he were the most confident man in the universe\" and that \"this is a character who's convinced he's right about everything\". Although his behavior is regularly a source of comedy, Jansen has no sense of humor about himself and is rarely seen to smile in either the animated series or the comics. The only exception in the animated series was a two-second laugh with a pair of Jansen's subordinates in the second episode of the first series, with a comically abrupt ending.\n\n"}
{"id": "7564162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7564162", "title": "The Bear (Bo' Selecta!)", "text": "The Bear (Bo' Selecta!)\n\nThe Bear is a fictional character who originated in the British adult sketch comedy, Bo' Selecta!. He is a rude teddy bear who is a social outcast and engages in cursing and womanizing. He like berries and always wears black glasses. He had a sidekick, a squirrel named Steven, whom he had a love-hate relationship with. \n\nThe character was popular enough to receive his own show, \"A Bear's Tail\", derived from the Christmas pilot. Since the end of \"A Bear's Tail\", the Bear has featured in Bo' in the USA. He is played by Leigh Francis.\n\nThe Bear often flirts with women, who guest-star on the show. In an episode of \"Bo' Selecta!\", it was revealed that he used to have a problem, which caused him to shout out bad words at anyone. He has, however, broke the habit by thinking of women to take his mind off of it. After fantasizing about women, his tail will pop out. He gets it to \"go away\" by saying, \"Christine Hamilton.\", three times, as seen in an episode, in which Christine Hamilton, herself guest starred in. However, when Christine guest-starred in an episode, the Bear had to say it in his mind.\n\nThe Bear often speaks about his parents, who left him behind and went to Alaska. They did appear in an episode of A Bear's Tail and wanted him back. They soon saw how well he was getting on in his new home and let him stay. The only other relative is his uncle, who is a dancing bear. The Bear stated that he was chained up by his nose and once tried to escape and ripped half his nose off and had to have it stitched up.\n\nThe Bear's only seen friend was a red squirrel named Steven. Steven would communicate via squeaks and would usually say something rude, to which he would be told off by the Bear.\n\nFor the first series of \"Bo' Selecta!\", the Bear had a talk show in his treehouse on Hampstead Heath called \"Bedtime with the Bear\", which featured women, who he would ask rude questions to. The format changed slightly for series 2, which featured him still hosting a talk show, but with one difference: A bedtime story. Bedtime stories feature the Bear, spotting something rude, that the guests are doing to the guest's surprise. This usually gives him an erection.\n\nAs of series 3 of \"Bo' Selecta!\", the Bear had his own part on Avid Merrion's talk show. He would speak to guests as usual in the same dirty manner, except it featured him on an actual talk show set.\nHe has interviewed the likes of Kerry Katona, Jennifer Ellison, Liberty X, Edith Bowman, Christine Hamilton, Vernon Kay, Jonathan Ross, Catalina Guirado, Tess Daley, and Melanie Blatt in Bedtime With The Bear.\n\nIn his own spin-off series, the Bear was adopted by the Hennersons after they ran him over in their car at Christmas. The mother of the family was played by Patsy Kensit, who adored the Bear. The father though, who was played by Sean Pertwee, hated the Bear after he thought that the Bear was stealing his wife. There was also a stroppy teenage daughter, Lillian Hennerson, who would argue with the Bear.\n\nThe series only lasted for one year, as Leigh Francis decided to bring back \"Bo' Selecta!\", but in America.\n\nLeigh Francis brought \"Bo' Selecta!\" back as \"\"Bo'\" in the United States of America, in which it featured the whole series in America, instead of Britain. The Bear (and many other celebrities) are staying at the Merrion Hotel. The Bear is currently friends with Verne Troyer, who played Mini-Me in Austin Powers. Verne wants to revamp the Bear's show, because he thought that A Bear's Tail was rubbish, along with many other characters.\n\nThe Bear made his television comeback in the 2018 ITV2 series \"Keith Lemon - Coming In America\". He appears in the third episode where he meets the Urban Fox, who like the Bear, had moved to America. In the same episode, it is revealed by the Bear that Steven got attacked by four grey squirrel and had his back legs chewed off. As he was in pain, the Bear put him out of his misery.\n\nThe Bear was previously portrayed before \"Bo Selecta!\", on a short lived programme entitled \"Whatever I Want\"\", shown on \"London Weekend Television\". He, however, was not a bear, but a man named Barry Gibson. The character is almost exactly the same, except he is in human form. There is an episode of this programme available to view on YouTube.\n"}

On 6 October 2013 it launched an English news website called The Cairo Post.\n\n\"Youm7\" was first published as a weekly paper in October 2008 and has been published daily since 31 May 2011. Editor Khaled Salah said shortly after the paper's expansion to daily publication that \"Youm7\" \"supports the popular need for a civil state and will strive to present facts to readers without political bias and with credible representation of diverse views.\"\n\nAccording to internet information service Alexa Internet, 59% of visitors to \"Youm7's\" website come from Egypt, and compared to internet users overall they are disproportionately higher-income college graduates and women browsing from home. In 2012, the paper's online version was the sixth most-visited website in Egypt based on the Alexa data. In 2014 the paper launched a new website, \"Photo7\" , which is a portal for pictures in Egypt and the Arab world.\n\nOn 6 October 2013 \"Youm7\" launched an English-language website called \"The Cairo Post,\" under the direction of Sallie Pisch, who also directed the organization's short-lived 'Youm7 English Edition' in 2011 (see below).\n\nIn an article published on the day the website launched, Pisch wrote that the goal for The Cairo Post was for it \"to become the news outlet to most faithfully portray Egypt, in all her intricacies, to all those who watch her and want to understand.\"\n\nAs of November 2013, the website was publishing roughly 200 stories daily, a combination of original content, articles translated from Youm7's Arabic news website, and wire services.\n\nOn 8 August 2011, managing director Sallie Pisch announced the launch of \"Youm7 English Edition\", stating that the English-language paper aimed to fill the gap in \"quality, understandable news coverage coming out of Egypt in English.\" \"Youm7 English Edition\" also managed an Egypt Wiki that \"aims to provide background info on Egyptian politicians, public figures and organizations in one location.\" As of 2 May 2012, the Youm7 English Edition appears to no longer be functioning, as the link to the English Edition homepage redirects to the \"Youm7\" Arabic site.

Online activists in Egypt also accused the paper of fabricating news and spreading misinformation, and at one point urged Twitter users to unfollow any profiles associated with the paper. The paper's English-language website was also hacked in July 2011, taking it offline. In May, 2012, \"Youm7\" was again accused of fabricating the news after publishing a report alleging that the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party had organized medical convoys to provide free female genital mutilation operations to girls. The Ministry of Health immediately announced an investigation, however no other media outlet was able to confirm the allegations. The Freedom and Justice Party denied the allegations.\n\nIn Aug, 2014, Youm7 published a page with the headline: \"Black Terror Gangs in Cairo\" including a picture of black skinned people holding guns and the word \"Niggers\" on it, it drew criticism from Egyptian activists and international media, calling the newspaper hateful and racist.\n\n\n"}
