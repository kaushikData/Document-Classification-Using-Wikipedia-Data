The term \"2.5D musical\" was coined to describe stories presented in two-dimensional medium being brought to real life.\n\nApproximately 70 2.5D musicals were produced in 2013 and attracted at least 1.6 million people, most of them young women in their teens and 20s. 2.5D musicals are often seen as the starting point of many young actors in Japan.\n\n2.5D musicals are defined through make-up and costuming that accurately depicts the actor as the original character, along with exaggerated acting that mimics the original expressions in the original work. It also include special effects and stunts that reenact the setting and tone of the original work. Directors of the musicals are usually the ones who write the lyrics to the songs. With the evolution of technology, some of the modern 2.5D musicals uses projection mapping, in which backgrounds and special effects are projected onto the stage and screens. According to the Japan 2.5-Dimensional Musical Association, the term not only applies to musicals, but also plays, comedies, and dramas.\n\nThe first successful manga-based musical production was \"The Rose of Versailles\" in 1974 by the Takarazuka Revue. At the time, these plays were simply known as \"musicals\" or \"anime musicals.\" Around the 1990s, a number of musicals and small stage skits produced were based on anime and manga series aimed at elementary school girls, such as \"Sailor Moon\", \"Akazukin Chacha\", and \"Hime-chan's Ribbon\", which performed moderately well, but were not popular and were known as . However, in 2000, \"Hunter x Hunter\" became revolutionary at the time because the voice cast for the original anime series had also played the characters on stage.\n\nJapanese media-based musicals rose to popularity in 2003 with \"Musical: The Prince of Tennis\" through word-of-mouth and social media, which soon became a starting point for many up-and-coming actors. The shows attracted more than 2 million people during its run and was notable for using stage effects to simulate a tennis match, and it was popular enough to include its first overseas shows in South Korea and Taiwan in 2008. After its success, many productions based on anime, manga, and video games soon followed, some of the well-documented ones including \"Naruto\", \"Yowamushi Pedal\", \"Hyper Projection Engeki Haikyu!!\" among others. Unlike productions featuring the Takarazuka Revue, which are supported by fans of the troupe, these musicals mainly draw anime and manga fans and other audiences that usually do not see plays on a regular basis.\n\nThe term \"2.5D musicals\" was codified in 2014 when the initial director of \"Musical: The Prince of Tennis\", Makoto Matsuda, first established the Japan 2.5-Dimensional Musical Association. At first, despite the success of \"Musical: The Prince of Tennis\", he did not consider it a formal stage production on par with most modern theater performances imported from Western works such as Broadway productions. However, after a group of South Korean musical professionals had acknowledged \"Black Butler\"'s production value and standards in performing arts, Matsuda decided to bring the genre worldwide. Plays certified by the Japan 2.5-Dimensional Musical Association offer theater glasses that contain subtitles in Chinese and English for people who do not speak Japanese. Starting in 2014, many 2.5D musicals have also been performed abroad in places like China, Taiwan, the United States, and parts of Europe.\n\nIn 2018, \"2.5D Musical Studies\" was added as a program at the Tokyo School of Anime. In April 2018, actor Kenta Suga, who has starred as Gaara in \"Naruto\" and Hinata in \"Hyper Projection Engeki Haikyu!!\" became appointed as the overseas ambassador by the Japan 2.5-Dimensional Musical Association, succeeding Ryo Kato.\n\n"}

In October 2005, one year after its opening the Museum marked 1,570,000 visitors.\n\nThe Museum is located in the center of Kanazawa, near Kenroku-en garden and the Ishikawa Prefectural Museum of Art. The building has a circular form, with a diameter of 112.5 metres. This shape aims to keep the appearance of the overall building volume low, to mitigate the scale of the project and allows access from multiple points of entry. The transparency of the building further manifests the wish to avoid the museum being perceived as a large, introverted mass.\n\nThe building includes community gathering spaces, such as a library, lecture hall, and children’s workshop, located on the periphery, and museum spaces in the middle. The exhibition areas comprise numerous galleries with multiple options for division, expansion, or concentration. The galleries are of various proportions and light conditions – from bright daylight through glass ceilings to spaces with no natural light source, their height ranging from 4 to 12 metres. The circulation spaces are designed to make them usable as additional exhibition areas. Four fully glazed internal courtyards, each unique in character, provide ample daylight to the center of the building and a fluent border between community spaces and museum spaces.\n\nThe collection of the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa is focused on works produced since 1980 that \"propose new values\". \n\nArtists in the collection are encouraged to produce site-specific installations that become \"closely associated with the Kanazawa area\". \n\nArtists in the permanent collection include; Francis Alys, Matthew Barney, Tony Cragg, Olafur Eliasson, Leandro Erlich, Isa Genzken, Kojima Hisaya, Gordon Matta Clark, Peter Newman, Carsten Nicolai, Giuseppe Penone, Gerhard Richter, Murayama Ruriko, Hiraki Sawa, Atsuko Tanaka, James Turrell, Patrick Tuttofuoco, Anne Wilson and Suda Yoshihiro.\n\nAmong the large scale works on permanent display are Leandro Ehrlich's \"Swimming Pool\" and \"Color Activity House\" by Olaflur Eliasson.\n\n"}

It also informs the audience that Okinawa is an actual part of the Japanese homeland, only a few hundred miles south of Kyushu.\n\nThe movements of the units and their order of battle is carefully traced, from the landings on April 1 to the assault on Naha. Some interesting footage is also shown on life in northern Okinawa soon after liberation, with the locals setting up a democratic government under the US military and opening up schools while battle is raging in the south.\n\nSome of the footage includes the use of flame-throwing tanks and close air support in an attempt to dislodge heavily dug-in Japanese defenders. The film ends with a eulogy for all those who died attempting to secure the island, as Marines visit a gigantic graveyard prior to departing for their next objective.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23887081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23887081", "title": "Abandoned pets", "text": "Abandoned pets\n\nAbandoned pets are companion animals that are either inadvertently or deliberately cast off by their owners. This commonly occurs when an owner dies, when a pet becomes disruptive or grows too large, or if the pet was acquired impulsively. The financial crisis of 2007–2010 has resulted in a number of pets abandoned for economic reasons. Typical of this group are pets left behind when the owner's home is foreclosed. These animals can be left alone on the property or dropped off at an animal shelter. They are often discovered after the foreclosure process, when the realtor or bank enters the home. Animals lucky enough to survive until they are discovered are often in poor condition due to lack of resources such as food and water.\n\nPets are abandoned for a variety of reasons. Often, when abandoned, pets are forced to fend for themselves, and become feral. In particular, cats and dogs go to colonies. Feral cats are said to outnumber feral dogs. Feral cats are difficult to deal with, as often they become impossible to socialize enough to be re-introduced to a new human owner. In general, only some newly abandoned cats and very young feral kittens can be tamed.\n\nIn many states in the United States, it is illegal to abandon a pet. In Iowa, doing so is a misdemeanor.\n\nCurrently the exact number of foreclosed pets is unknown. People often drop animals off at a shelter and claim they are moving, when in fact they are leaving due to foreclosure. In 2008, the number of foreclosure pets is believed to had increased due to high foreclosure rates. As homeowners run out of time and options, they often leave their animals behind. The animals are then classified as abandoned foreclosure pets.\n\nThe pets left behind in homes are often left without food or water. Some do not survive because of the lack of resources and are found dead when realtors or banks enter the premises. The animals are put in harm's way, and it is often believed it is done as a way to retaliate against those who took the home away.\n\nMany animals left at a shelter are euthanized due to lack of space and financial resources for these animals. Shelters unable to raise additional funds to provide for the increased number of incoming animals have no choice but to euthanize them, sometimes within days.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31391925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31391925", "title": "Angry Birds Seasons", "text": "Angry Birds Seasons\n\nAngry Birds Seasons is the second puzzle video game in the \"Angry Birds\" series, developed by Rovio Mobile. Based on \"Angry Birds\", \"Angry Birds Seasons\" was released for devices using Apple's iOS in October 2010 and then it was released on other platforms starting in December 2010. There have been no new releases since 2016 and it appears that Rovio has discontinued development of the game.\n\nJust as in the original \"Angry Birds\", players use a slingshot to launch an assortment of birds at nearby structures, with the intent of hitting targets located on or within them. The main targets are the pigs, and they can be defeated if directly fired at, or through other strategies, e.g.: the bird hits a structure that falls on the pig, defeating it. Small sized pigs are weak and easily defeated, while bigger pigs can sustain more damage. Each level pack represents a different \"season\", often based upon different themes and holidays. Different level packs have each unique theme and sometimes much different gameplay.\n\nSeason 2010 started in October 2010, when Rovio released a Halloween edition. \"Angry Birds Halloween\", exclusive to iOS at the time and a separate game, included levels with Halloween-themed music and graphics. In December 2010, Rovio released \"Angry Birds Seasons\" to iOS, Android and Symbian 3 devices. \"Seasons\" introduced 25 Christmas-themed levels, one for each day leading to the holiday, similar to an Advent calendar. All versions include the previously-exclusive Halloween levels and are offered as separate, stand-alone paid applications, with the exception of the free, ad-supported Android version; \"Angry Birds Halloween\" users on iOS received the \"Seasons\" levels as a free upgrade. The Halloween version was given the episode title \"Trick or Treat\", while the Christmas episode was entitled \"Season's Greedings\".\nSeason 2011 began in February 2011, when Rovio released a Valentine's Day update to \"Angry Birds Seasons\", entitled \"Hogs and Kisses\", complete with new themed levels and graphics, as well as the option to send \"Angry Birds\"-themed Valentine's Day messages through Facebook. In March 2011, Rovio released a new St. Patrick's Day update, entitled \"Go Green, Get Lucky\", followed by an Easter update, entitled \"Easter Eggs\", in April 2011 and a summer update, \"Summer Pignic\", in June 2011. In September 2011, \"Mooncake Festival\" was released in conjunction with the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival. In October 2011, \"Ham'O'Ween\" was released and introduced a new orange bird, known as Bubbles. In December 2011, \"Wreck the Halls\" was released with 25 Christmas-theme levels also arranged in an Advent calendar setting.\n\nSeason 2012 started in January 2012, when \"Year of the Dragon\" was released; it is about Chinese New Year. It features the replacement of the Mighty Eagle, the Mighty Dragon, that loops out the structures and defeats all the pigs; it is free to use. A Japanese Cherry Blossom season was announced on February 28, 2012, with a release date on March 7, 2012. In June 2012, Angry Birds Seasons added their twelfth season, Piglantis. It was launched on June 14 and is the second summer based episode (the first episode being Summer Pignic). The main new feature in Angry Birds: Piglantis is fluid physics: the birds, wood, and glass are buoyant in the water levels; however, the pigs and stone are too heavy to rise to the surface and sink down until they are defeated. In August 2012, \"Back to School\" was added, which introduces the pink bird, Stella. In October 2012 when Haunted Hogs was released and was the 3rd Halloween episode in the series. It added ghost blocks, which is visible to all items except the birds and the pigs unless they are inside them. On December 1, Winter Wonderham was released and was the 3rd Christmas episode in the series. Like the other Christmas episodes, it is set up as an advent calendar. It introduced slippery blue ice, that makes wood, ice, stone, birds and pigs slip on contact.\n\nSeason 2013 began in May 2013, when Abra-Ca-Bacon based on World Circus Day was released; it has a magician theme and features magic portals, which can teleport materials, birds, or pigs from one portal to another. In December 2013 Arctic Eggspedition was released, the 4th Christmas episode, and it is once again set up as an advent calendar with one level unlocked per day or all unlocked with an in-app purchase. \"Season 3\" or \"Season 2013\" is the shortest episode in \"Seasons\", with just two episodes.\n\nSeason 2014 began in July 2014 with South Hamerica and Pig Days, an episode that has weekly unlocked levels. With this update, the seasons were renamed showing the release year, such as \"Season 2011\". On October 9, 2014, the game has been updated with \"Ham Dunk\", in celebration of the NBA Championships. On October 27, 2014, the \"Visit Finland\" Twitter account unveiled an image displaying Terrance swimming on a pool along a similar looking bird, colored blue, named \"Tony the Blue\", and the title \"On Finn Ice\", which is the 5th Christmas episode. The tweet also referred to the Finnish band Apocalyptica, who play the theme music for that episode. With this update, the episodes were arranged to the year they were released, not as it was previously; the \"Winter Wonderham\" episode, which was in \"Seasons 2013\", was moved to \"Seasons 2012\", as the episode was released in 2012.\nSeason 2015 rang in February 2015, a 2nd part was added to Ham Dunk- \"All-Star Weekend 2015\", expanding the world to 60 levels (more than Trick or Treat, which has 45)- this update allowed the player to use Shockwave (electrical Bomb) for free, but only in Ham Dunk and for a limited time. At the extreme end of April (the 30th), a tropical world set on an unspecified Pacific island. The world was added in commemoration to Rovio's partnership with BirdLife International to save the birds of the Pacific. About a month later (June), a 3rd Ham Dunk update, celebrating The Finals, was added- ultimately expanding the total levels of Ham Dunk to 67. Between this update and the next was about 4 months, giving Rovio a \"rest\" and letting them handle other Angry Birds games. Finally, in October 2015, a 50's movie-themed world was added to the selection, titled \"Invasion of the Egg Snatchers\", which not only brought a new world, but BirdWear (costumes), which are unlocked in a scavenger hunt style, having the player search through levels they completed for certain items, and once 3 items were found (there is a 16-hour wait between obtaining items and an 8-hour wait to get a new mission), they would receive the costume, allowing the birds to (optionally) wear outfits during gameplay. Another new feature in the update was the Power-Up Test Zone, which lets the player test Power-Ups (with infinite uses). Finally, to wrap up 2015, \"Ski or Squeal\" was added (in the usual advent calendar style), taking place a top a frigid mountain summit.\n\nSeason 2016 (final season) began on February 11, 2016 (2 months after the Angry Birds 6th birthday), a Valentine's Day episode was released, entitled \"Fairy Hogmother\", which is set in a fairytale storybook, featuring magic wands that trigger actions when hit, and (strangely) imprisoned Birds that give the player an extra Bird when the cage (holding the Bird) is destroyed. As spring rolled around about a month later, a new episode was released, called \"Marie Hamtionette\" (after Marie Antoinette, queen of France in the 1700s), which is set in the garden of Ludpig XVI's (Louis XVI) estate, complete with hedges and topiarys across a wide landscape. On June 27, 2016, summer 2016 kicked off with a new summer-themed world entitled \"Summer Camp\", which is (hence the name) a summer camp set in a mountainous forest at dawn, including many popular activities one would find at a camp, including human swimming, archery, rock climbing, and many more popular summer activities. The summer 2016 update also added a new mode to the course of gameplay, \"The Pig Challenge\", which is set in a tournament style format, having players compete against friends and other players in a randomized set of weekly levels for trophies and power-ups. Fall 2016 started with \"Piggywood Studios\" where the Pigs reenact famous movie scenes from \"Indiana Jones\", \"King Kong\", \"The Angry Birds Movie\", \"Aliens\", \"Back to the Future\" and more. It continued with the Halloween episode \"Hammier Things\", which was based on TV series \"Stranger Things\", and concluded with the Christmas episode \"Ragnahog\", which is set in a Nordic theme.\n\nAt the 2012 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, California, Rovio and distribution partner Activision announced plans to bring \"Angry Birds Seasons\", along with the original \"Angry Birds\" and \"Angry Birds Rio\", to the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Nintendo 3DS systems. Bundled together as \"Angry Birds Trilogy\", the games will be built specifically for their respective consoles, taking advantage of their unique features, such as support for PlayStation Move, Kinect, high-definition displays and glasses-free 3D visuals.\n\nIt is also available for Wii and Wii U as part of \"Angry Birds Trilogy\".\n\nThe reception of \"Angry Birds Seasons\" has been positive. Tracy Erickson of \"Pocket Gamer\" said about the Halloween update, \"The difficulty is steeper than in the original \"Angry Birds\", which is likely an intentional consideration for those well-versed in the first game. This doesn't make \"Angry Birds Halloween\" unapproachable, but it does result in an undesirable increase in trial-and-error gameplay. Without the experience of playing the original, you can anticipate having to replay a lot of stages.\" He further mentioned, \"Of course, these structural issues don't detract from what remains an entertaining game. \"Angry Birds Halloween\" is pleasantly more of the same, though you're best served by playing the original before tackling this holiday treat.\" Sarah Jacobsson of \"Macworld\" said about the Christmas update, \"Unlike the original \"Angry Birds\" and \"Angry Birds Halloween\", the Season’s Greetings track does not start out with a laughably easy level—after all, you only get one level a day, and Rovio wants to make you work for it.\" She further wrote, \"\"Angry Birds Seasons\" brings fun, Christmas spirit to the most popular iOS game of the year. With the included Halloween track, you get a total of 69 challenging levels—definitely worth $0.99 (\"Angry Birds Seasons HD\" is $1.99).\" Abigail Holden of \"Lazygamer\" rated the game 8.5/10, saying, \"Whether you’re new to \"Angry Birds\" or you've enjoyed the game on other platforms, \"Angry Birds Seasons\" for PC is worth to look at.\n\n"}

He also published a selection of comics and zines during the same period. Starting in 1970 as a mail-order distributor specializing in underground comix, Plant absorbed some of his smaller rivals in the 1980s, and then sold his business to Diamond Comics Distributors in 1988.\n\nPlant (born 1952) was a comics and illustrated books enthusiast from San Jose, California, who throughout his high school years bought and sold back issue comic books through ads in fanzines such as \"Rocket's Blast\"/\"ComicCollector\". In 1968 he co-founded Seven Sons Comic Shop with five friends, John Barrett, Jim Buser, Mike Nolan, Frank Scadina, and Tom Tallmon, in San Jose. Selling Seven Sons within a year, Plant and three partners then opened another San Jose-based comics shop called Comic World.\n\nIn 1970 Plant founded Bud Plant, Inc. as a mail order company specializing in underground comix. (His Holly Drive address appears as the publishing address of the first issue of \"Promethean Enterprises\" in 1969.) In 1971, Plant and five friends spent the summer dealing comics at conventions in Houston, New York, Dallas, San Diego, Miami, Boston, and Washington, D.C.\n\nPlant had met direct market pioneer Phil Seuling on the convention circuit; in late 1973 Seuling called Plant to inform him that he had just cut a deal to ship Archie, DC, Marvel, and Warren comic books from a new distribution center in Sparta, Illinois. Seuling offered the West Coast region to Plant, but Plant turned him down, preferring then to concentrate on the proliferating underground comix market.\n\nPlant entered the publishing field in 1969 as one of the three publishers, along with Al Davoren and Jim Vadeboncoeur, Jr., of \"Promethean Enterprises\" — a fanzine that attempted to straddle the comic/comix boundary. (\"Promethean Enterprises\" lasted from 1969–1974.) In 1972, Plant took over the publishing responsibilities of the fanzine \"Anomaly\" from Jan Strnad who had published three issues since 1969. Plant published issue #4 of \"Anomaly\", evolving it into an underground comic.\n\nAs part of his retailing enterprise Comics & Comix (see below), in 1974 Plant co-published one issue of the underground/sword and sorcery hybrid \"Barbarian Killer Funnies\"; moving from there to the similarly themed \"The First Kingdom\", written and illustrated by Jack Katz. (Under various publishing names, Plant published 24 issues of \"The First Kingdom\", from 1974 to 1986.) Comics & Comix also published three issues of Jim Pinkoski's \"Spaced\" in 1974–1976; two issues of \"Dan O'Neill's Comics and Stories\" in 1975; and two issues of Alfredo Alcala's \"Magic Carpet\" in 1977–1978.\n\nAround 1978, Plant was approached by Wendy & Richard Pini about publishing \"Elfquest\", but he turned the couple down, as he was getting out the comics publishing business. (The Pinis went on to much success as self-publishers.)\n\nFrom 1980 to 1985, Comics & Comix also published the industry trade journal \"Telegraph Wire\".\n\n\nIn August 1972, while still an undergraduate at San Jose State University, Plant co-founded what became the comics retailer Comics & Comix in Berkeley, California, with John Barrett and Plant's housemate Robert Beerbohm. In 1973 Comics & Comix helped host the first Bay Area comics convention, Berkeleycon 73, in the Pauley Ballroom in the ASUC Building on the University of California, Berkeley campus. At that show, Comics & Comix acquired over 4,000 Golden Age comic books owned by Tom Reilly. The phenomenal sales of the Reilly collection enabled Comics & Comix to open more retail locations, first in San Francisco (May 1973), on Columbus Avenue (down from the North Beach area on the way to Fisherman's Wharf), and later in San Jose and Sacramento, making it the first comic book chain store in America.\n\nIn the early 1980s Plant supplied product to Destiny Distributors, a sub-distributor based in Seattle and Vancouver, started by Phil Pankow (which was acquired by Diamond in 1990). In 1982, Plant bought out regional rival Charles Abar Distribution, based in Belmont, California.\n\nThe year 1985 brought two important developments in the distribution industry, the bankruptcy of Seuling's Sea Gate Distributors (Seuling himself had died in 1984), and the failure of Plant's West Coast rival Pacific Comics (which by that point was also a large independent comics publisher). Plant and Midwestern distributor Capital City Distributors opened \"an expanded facility in Seagate's old space in Sparta, Illinois, alongside [Pacific's old] printing plant\". In 1987, Plant acquired Alternate Realities Distributing, Inc., based in Denver, Colorado, a wholesale distribution operation run by Nanette Rozanski.\n\nBy 1988, Plant dominated distribution of comics in the West Coast, finally fulfilling Seuling's 1974 vision.\n\nIn the summer of 1988, Steve Geppi of Diamond Comics Distribution bought Plant's distribution warehouses, allowing Diamond to go \"national\", \"thereby assuming control of \"40 percent of the direct-sales market\".\n\nLater in 1988, Plant also sold Comics & Comix.\n\nSince divesting himself of his distribution and brick-and-mortar retail businesses, Plant has maintained a mail-order (and now Internet) presence in art books, trade paperbacks, and rare books. Plant is known for the colorful titles of his sales catalogs:\n\n\nOn July 5, 2011, Plant announced plans to sell his mail-order business and retire. Then in April 2012 (after failing to find a buyer) he announced plans to downsize (eliminating print catalogs) but continue operations.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Her given name was Emma Carus.\n\nShe frequently sang in vaudeville and sometimes in Broadway features. One columnist described her as \"a sort of combination of Sophie Tucker and Fay Templeton with a little of Eva Tanguay and Eddie Foy thrown in for good measure.\"\n\nShe appeared in the drama \"Rally Round the Flag\" at the Union Square Theatre in August 1897. The venue at 50 East 14th Street was owned by Benjamin Franklin Keith and Edward Franklin Albee II, who purchased the theater in 1893 to host vaudeville performances. Carus was described as a\nballad singer prior to her performance at the Olympia Roof Garden, Broadway (Manhattan) between 44th Street and 45th Street, in September 1897. The following month she shared a program at the Pleasure Palace with the Dunbar Sisters and Henry E. Dixey. The entertainment hall was managed by Frederick Freeman Proctor and was located on East Fifty-Eighth Street between Third Avenue (Manhattan-Bronx) and Lexington Avenue (Manhattan).\n\nA varied lineup of acts was presented by Sam T. Jack's Theatre, Madison Street (Chicago), State Street (Chicago), Chicago, in June 1898. Carus joined Troja, Jennie Yeamans, and the Washburn sisters on a bill.\n\nIn October 1905 Carus appeared on Broadway at Proctor's Fifth Avenue (Manhattan) Theatre. This was her first Broadway engagement since a show at the\nWistaria Grove, which was located on the roof of the New York Theatre.\n\nThe \"Follies of 1907\" took place at the Jardin de Paris on the roofs of the New York Theatre and the Criterion Theatre. Produced by Florenz Ziegfeld, a large audience observed the thirteen parts, which were vaudeville acts. Carus headed a cast that was supported by a chorus quite similar to an earlier one that assisted Anna Held in \"The Paris Model\".\n\nShe was in a production of \"The Wife Hunters\", a musical play in three acts, in which she sang in a \"pleasant, deep-throated way, and with a suggestion of a sense of humor of sentiment as occasion may require.\" Her comedy number was \"Girls, Keep Your Figures\". The Herald Square Theatre, 1331 Broadway (29 West 35th Street),\nproduced the play which was based on a book by Edgar Allan Woolf.\n\nIn 1911, Carus is said to have been largely responsible for helping introduce and popularize Irving Berlin's first major hit song, \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\". In Chicago, it especially became identified with her, and soon it worked its way back to New York where Al Jolson picked it up and it quickly caught on in popularity.\n\nCarus sang at the Palace Theatre in a production which starred Bertha Kalich in March 1914. Also entertaining were the \"Beauties\" of Jesse Lasky and George White, noted for George White's Scandals.\nCarus returned for a fourth year on the interstate vaudeville circuit in 1914. This time she was accompanied by a dance partner, Carl Randall. She\nhad a new stock of songs that included \"An Irish Suffragette\".\n\nCarus fainted at the Great Northern Hotel in Chicago, Illinois after hearing of her lover's suicide in June 1897. James Burrows killed himself in\nNashville, Tennessee, where he managed a theater. Carus tried to commit suicide with a revolver after learning of Burrow's demise, but was prevented by her friends. She believed that his mother tried to influence Burrows against her.\n\nIn April 1913 Carus secured a judgment against W. Lewis Stevens, a broker. Stevens and his partner, James W. Henning, were accused by her of embezzling more than $2,200 of her money for their own use when their company failed in 1910. Stevens was arrested at the Iroquois Hotel, 49 West 44th Street, New York City.\n\nShe was an avid baseball fan who followed the New York Giants of John McGraw. Carus attended every World Series from 1905 until 1913.\nIn a syndicated column she predicted the Giants to be victorious over the Philadelphia Athletics in the 1913 World Series.\n\n"}

Some magic effects have been exposed in stage shows, and in other public media including television, the Internet, certain video sharing interfaces, discussion forums, and blogs.\n\nOne notable case of exposure on network television involved Val Valentino, performing as the \"Masked Magician\" in the Fox series \"\", which ran between 1997 and 1998. Valentino was ostracized by the magic community and received much criticism from magicians for contravening the joint International Brotherhood of Magicians and Society of American Magicians ethics statement. \n\nPenn & Teller have often exposed their own tricks for the purposes of entertainment. Penn Jillette has stated that while the duo show the audience how a trick is done, it is often done so quickly or with different mechanics that the audience is unable to follow.

The film is the sequel of the successful film \"Flodder\" from 1986. It was filmed on location in New York and stars Dutch actors Huub Stapel, Nelly Frijda, Tatjana Simic, Rene van 't Hof, Lou Landre, Gerard Joling, Dick Rienstra, and American actor Jon Polito as nightclub owner Larry Rosenbaum.\n\nThe city council comes into contact with a cultural exchange project in the USA, which proposes to have an average family of either country live for a year in the other one. The sneaky councilman proposes the Flodders, who have been causing many problems over the last year, for the exchange, in the hope of getting rid of them for good. Sjakie van Kooten, the social worker who is guiding the Flodders' social integration, is send with them.\n\nAfter a flight in which the family causes many problems, Sjakie and the Flodders land in New York. When Sjakie is renting a car, the Flodders are mistaken for a Russian delegation of scientists and taken to the Plaza Hotel. Sjakie loses the family and has his car towed away, forcing him to take a taxi to the office of his American colleagues, only to get stuck in the New York traffic and thereby arriving to late at the office and at the hotel he booked. The Flodders meanwhile go sightseeing in Manhattan and are invited to the reception of the Roosevelt Foundation which was meant for the Russian doctors. At the reception, a young man named Geoffrey sees daughter Kees and immediately tries to hook up with her, claiming he instantly fell in love. When the family gets back at the Plaza Hotel, the staff has found out about the mix-up and the Flodders are thrown out, forcing them to spend the night in Central Park. The next day, they get food by stealing a hot dog car and later by roasting some birds.\n\nWhen searching through Sjakie's suitcase, the Flodders find the phone number of the exchange project and ring the office, where Sjakie has just arrived. When trying to get a taxi, Sjakie gets pushed aside and his glasses fall through a grid, which results in him getting stuck while trying to retrieve them. Hours go by, with Sjakie even getting robbed by two hoodlums and being peed on by a dog, until a demented hobo helps him out and takes him to a shelter to get some food. However, a fight breaks out in the shelter, after which the police arrive and throw Sjakie and the hobo in jail for a few days. The Flodders meanwhile rescue a man who is attacked by a group of muggers, after which the grateful man introduces himself as Larry Rosenbaum and takes them to the shady night club he owns. Soon he proposes them to come work for him.\n\nA few days later the Flodders and the Rosenbaum couple have redecorated the night club, while at the same time Sjakie and his hobo friend are released from jail. When spotting the Flodder sons across the road, Sjakie tries to get to them, but gets hit by a car and ends up in hospital with a concussion. That same night, the night club opens again with a more Dutch oriented theme: bitterballen are served as snacks and daughter Kees does a striptease in a Frau Antje costume. Son Kees secretly steals gasoline from the guests' car, having discovered that gasoline in the United States is far cheaper than in the Netherlands, and stores the stolen fuel in an emtpy water tank on the roof to make a huge profit back in the Netherlands (while not realising that there is no way he can get the tank to the Netherlands). Meanwhile, Sjakie gets mixed up with another patient at hospital, only to wake up in the morning and discover he has had a transgender operation.\n\nAfter some days, Johnny, daughter Kees and son Kees meet the muggers from Central Park again and get chased by them through the streets of Manhattan, resulting in the muggers crashing into the New York Stock Exchange, after which the Flodder siblings are arrested. However, when finding the business card of Geoffrey, the police immediately releases them, after which the Flodders are met by Geoffrey who asks whether he can take daughter Kees out for the night, which Johnny only allows when Geoffrey pays him $5000,-. Although daughter Kees is not enthusiastic about Geoffrey, one of his advisers fears the worst and does research on the Flodder family. Soon it becomes clear to the viewer that Geoffrey's father is in fact the president of the United States. Not wanting his son to be involved with a white trash girl, the president decides to go the nightclub incognito, to talk daughter Kees out of the affair.\n\nJust at the night the president arrives and tries to talk to daughter Kees in her dressing room, the situation escalates because Rosenbaum catches his wife and Johnny having sex in the stockroom, after which Rosenbaum gets infuriated and tries to attack Johnny with a shotgun. By the time the police arrive, Ma Flodder has already stopped Rosenbaum by putting his head underwater. However, when Ma spits out her cigar it accenditally flies into the frying pan, creating a fire which lights the gasoline in the water tank. The water tank is launched into the air and flies over Manhattan (spotted by characters like the hobo and the muggers) after which it hits the head of the Statue of Liberty. The head promptly explodes.\n\nWhen rushing into daughter Kees's dressing room, two police officers have recognised the president, who had tried to get away and thereby fell over the topless girl. In order to prevent a scandal, the American government makes an agreement with the Dutch embassy and has the Flodders released from jail, on the condition that they leave the country. Johnny manages to get a first class flight for the family as well as lots of expensive clothing, as a compensation for not telling anybody about the scandal. When on the plane back to Europe, he teasingly asks Sjakie whether he is reading the Playgirl.\n\nSimultaneously with the film release the movie was also adapted into a comic book written by Dick Maas, Wijo Koek and drawn by Marcel Bosma. \n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 26, 1991. In the episode, Marge worries that she may yet again be pregnant and drives to Dr. Hibbert's office. While anxiously waiting, Homer begins to tell Bart, Lisa, and Maggie the story of how he and Marge got married and how Bart was born.\n\nWritten by Jeff Martin and directed by Jeffrey Lynch, \"I Married Marge\" was the second flashback episode of \"The Simpsons\" after season two's \"The Way We Was\". It features cultural references to \"The Empire Strikes Back\", \"Charlie's Angels\", and \"Ms. Pac-Man\". The title of the episode is a play on the American television series \"I Married Joan\". Since airing, \"I Married Marge\" has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 11.9 and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.\n\nThe episode was the first of three about the births of the Simpsons children, this one covering Bart's birth, with Lisa's covered in \"Lisa's First Word\" in the fourth season, and Maggie's covered in the sixth-season episode \"And Maggie Makes Three\". The episode also expands upon the family's origins as a result of Marge falling pregnant with Bart, briefly referred to in \"The Way We Was\", and introduces key moments, such as Bart's conception at a Mini-Golf course, which would ultimately become a major part of the series' canon.\n\nMarge and Homer worry that Marge may be pregnant again after a home pregnancy test gives inconclusive results, so Marge drives to Dr. Hibbert's office to take another test. While waiting, Homer tells Bart, Lisa, and Maggie the story of how he and Marge got married, and Bart's birth thereafter. In 1980, Homer works at a mini-golf course and is dating Marge. One night, they make out inside a golf course castle after seeing \"The Empire Strikes Back\". A few days later, Marge feels sick and tells Homer that she might be pregnant. He takes her to Dr. Hibbert's office, who confirms that Marge is pregnant. Homer is less than thrilled over the announcement, but since he loves Marge; he proposes to her and she accepts.\n\nThey decide to name their new baby Bart, as it is the first name they could think of that Homer did not think other children would make fun of. The two marry in a small wedding chapel across the state line. They spend their wedding night at Marge's family's house, sleeping on a couch in the living room, which irritates Marge's mother Jacqueline and her twin sisters Patty and Selma.\n\nHomer's wages at the mini-golf course are insufficient to pay for his growing family so he applies for a job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, but is unsuccessful. When Homer and Marge's newly purchased baby supplies and Marge's wedding ring are repossessed, Homer decides to leave and find a job. When Marge reads the letter Homer left behind explaining his actions, she is devastated and brought to tears. Homer gets a job at a \"Gulp N' Blow\" taco restaurant, where Patty and Selma find him. Selma, seeing how unhappy her younger sister is without Homer, decides to tell Marge the truth in spite of Patty's reluctance (due to her obvious hatred of Homer). Marge finds Homer and convinces him to come back home with her. When Homer says he cannot provide much material wealth for Marge, she reminds him that anything he gives her is valuable, because it is from him.\n\nHomer applies for a job at the power plant once more, this time marching into Mr. Burns's office and telling him that he will be the perfect employee. Mr. Burns is so impressed that he hires Homer on the spot. When Homer returns to Marge's house, he learns from his mother-in-law Jacqueline that she has gone into labor and is already at the hospital. He hurries there and sees Marge with Selma and an angry Patty, who starts berating him. Fed up with her disrespect, Homer lashes out at Patty and angrily tells Patty (as well as the rest of the Bouvier family) to start showing him some respect for the fact he has a job, a piece of news that Homer promptly tells Marge before she finally gives birth to Bart. After Homer finishes telling his flashback story, he admits to Bart that he received the greatest gift a man can have the day Bart was born. At that time, Marge arrives home with the news that she is not pregnant. They are both overjoyed and high-five.\n\n\"I Married Marge\" was written by Jeff Martin and directed by Jeffrey Lynch. It was the second flashback episode of \"The Simpsons\" and a sequel to the previous one, \"The Way We Was\", which tells the story of how Homer and Marge met in high school. Executive producer Sam Simon was concerned that the writers were being \"inefficient\" with the episode; he thought the three plots of Homer and Marge's marriage, the birth of Bart, and Homer getting his job should have been extended into three episodes instead of one.\n\nThe staff were concerned over the animation of the characters' eyes in the episode, as the pupils were larger than normal, making the characters look \"stoned\", and the eyeballs were \"too round\" and large. The animation artists at the animation studio in South Korea, where much of the animation process takes place, had begun stenciling the eyes with a template, which according to Lynch resulted in \"strangely round eyes which look a little too big sometimes and much too perfect. Which is very un-\"Simpsons\" like.\" Marge was designed with shorter hair in the flashback sequences to make her appear younger. Lynch thought it was nice to see Marge in a \"younger, more attractive mode, and sort of watching her progress through pregnancy.\"\n\nThe title of the episode is a reference to the American television series \"I Married Joan\". Marge and Homer sing along to \"You Light Up My Life\" by Debby Boone in the car. When Marge is suspected to be pregnant, Bart wants to name the baby after rapper Kool Moe Dee, while Lisa wants to name her after Ariel, from \"The Little Mermaid\". At the beginning of his story, Homer mentions the band Supertramp, and their popularity in the time period. While exiting the movie theater, Homer spoils the ending of \"The Empire Strikes Back\" for dozens of moviegoers awaiting the next show. He also compares Marge's good looks to Princess Leia and her intelligence to Yoda, two characters from the film.\n\nHomer's encounter with the donut delivery man that delivers donuts to the power plant is a reference to a scene in the film \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\". Homer and his best friend Barney Gumble are watching \"Charlie's Angels\" when Marge tells the news of her pregnancy. A of Farrah Fawcett, a cast member of \"Charlie's Angels\", hangs on the wall in Barney's apartment. Dolly Parton's \"9 to 5\" is heard when Homer looks for a new job. The sign outside the wedding chapel resembles Vegas Vic from the Pioneer Club in Las Vegas. When Homer returns to the power plant to apply for a job the second time, Mr. Burns is seen playing the arcade game \"Ms. Pac-Man\". The episode marks the first appearance of Burns's assistant Smithers's first name, Waylon, which comes from the puppeteer Wayland Flowers. When Homer is working at the Gulp N' Blow, he is wearing an \"I Shot J.R.\" T-Shirt, a reference to the Who Shot J.R.? storyline in \"Dallas\" in 1980.\n\nIn its original American broadcast on December 26, 1991, \"I Married Marge\" finished 27th in the ratings for the week of December 23–29, 1991, with a Nielsen rating of 11.9, equivalent to approximately 11 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. Marge's voice actor, Julie Kavner, received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992 for her performance in the episode.\n\nSince airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Pete Oliva of \"North Texas Daily\" praised the writers for providing back stories that are \"believable\" and do not feel \"contrived or hastily thought through.\" The authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought it was a \"moving\" episode with \"plenty of great setpieces.\" DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson described the episode as \"sweet and funny\" and a \"nice piece of \"Simpsons\" history.\" Jacobson went on to say that he enjoyed the flashback concept and that the episode develops the characters \"nicely\" and gives the viewers \"a good sense for the era in which it takes place.\" Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave it a 5/5 rating, and highlighted the scenes with Marge's sisters Patty and Selma, \"barraging Homer with insults\", as the \"funniest moments\" of the episode. Meyers added: \"The episode's climax is a great moment for Homer and fans of the show.\" Molly Griffin of \"The Observer\" said \"I Married Marge\" is one of the season three episodes that turned the show into \"the cultural force it is today.\"\n\nIn his book \"Drawn to Television – Prime-time Animation from the Flintstones to Family Guy\", Keith Booker wrote: \"The episode details in a rather sentimental fashion the early struggles of the irresponsible Homer to support his new family [...] Such background episodes add an extra dimension to the portrayal of the animated Simpson family, making them seem oddly real and adding weight to their status as a family with a long history together.\"\n\n"}

IPTA was formed in 1943 pre independence India, during which it promoted themes related to the Indian freedom struggle. Its goal was to bring cultural awakening among the people of India. It is the cultural wing of the Communist Party of India.\n\nBanglore unit of IPTA was formed in 1941. IPTA was formed on 25 May 1943 at the National conference of theater artists held at the Marwari school, Bombay in response to the need for theater artists to become part of the Indian freedom struggle. Its origins lay in the first Progressive Writer’s Association Conference that was held in 1936, the establishment of the Youth Cultural Institute at Calcutta in 1940, and the setting up of the People’s Theatre in Bangalore by Anil De’ Silva in 1941. Its initial members consisted of various progressive cultural troupes, theatre groups and other progressive cultural activists. The name People’s Theatre was suggested by the renowned scientist Homi Jahangir Bhabha who was in turn inspired by Romain Rolland’s book on the concepts of People’s Theatre.\n\nIts initial activities included street plays organized by Binoy Roy of the Bengal Cultural Squad to inform people of the 1942 manmade famine in Bengal. Their ski included a choir ‘Bhookha Hai Bengal’ created by Vamik Jaunpuri and other songs and plays. The squad included musician Prem Dhawan , drum player Dashrath Lal, singer Reva Roy and actress Usha Dutt. Motivated by this squad, several other cultural groups were formed including the Agra Cultural Squad. IPTA was subsequently formed to organize these local groups at the national level. \n\nIdeologically these groups were inspired by the left movement and the then General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, P.C. Joshi and the General Secrtetary of the Progressive Writers’ Association Sajjad Zaheer.\n\nSome of the initial members of the group were Prithviraj Kapoor, Bijon Bhattacharya, Balraj Sahni, Ritwik Ghatak, Utpal Dutt, Khwaja Ahmad Abbas, Salil Chowdhury, Pandit Ravi Shankar, Jyotirindra Moitra, Niranjan Singh Maan, S. Tera Singh Chan, Jagdish Faryadi, Khalili Faryadi, Rajendra Raghuvanshi Safdar Mir, Hasan Premani,Amiya Bose etc. The group was formed in 1942, in the background of the Second World War, with Bengal famine of 1943 and starvation deaths in India on the one hand and repression by the colonial masters in the wake of the Quit India Movement and the aggression by the fascist powers on the Soviet Union on the other. An All India People's Theatre Conference was held in Mumbai in 1943 where the group presented its idea and objective of representing the crisis of the time through the medium of theatre and to help people understand their rights and duties. This conference led to the formation of committees of IPTA across India. The movement hit not only theatres, but also cinema and music in Indian languages.Now it is the cultural wing of Communist Party of India (CPI)\n\nThe most important of the dramas were \"Nabanna\" (Harvest). \"Nabanna\" is a folk-cultural festival of Bengal to celebrate the harvest. This Bengali drama, written by Bijon Bhattacharya and directed by Sombhu Mitra, portrayed the evils of the Bengal famine of 1943\n\n\"Nava Jiboner Gaan\" (Song of New Life) by Jyotirindra Moitra and the film \"Dharti Ke Lal\" (Children of the Earth) by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas followed \"Nabanna\" in addressing the needs of the people. These performances were characteristic for their vivid, stark portrayal of the suffering of the masses. Similar productions were carried out all over India, like \"Deshasathi\" in Marathi which was about the attack on the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany; \"Prarambham\" in Telugu; and \"Zubeida\" directed by Balraj Sahni and based on the story of a Muslim girl from Malabar. Manikuntala Sen, the fire band woman of left politics acted in this play along with Gopal Halder, who later became an educationist.\n\nThough the group was temporarily dispersed by the Indian National Congress government using police violence and repressive measures in 1947, its main members continued to carry the legacy of IPTA by forming several groups with similar ideology. Ahindra Chowdhuri, Sombhu Mitra and Tripti Mitra were the leading members of the group \"Bohurupee\". \"Raktakarabi\", \"Tahar Nam Ti Ranjana\", \"Char Adhyay\" (written by Rabindranath Tagore) were some of the earlier productions of Bohurupee. Utpal Dutt led another faction of artists and went to create classics like \"Tiner Talowar\" and \"Kallol\". IPTA Mumbai was another offshoot that has existed over the last six decades and continue to produce dramas till date. IPTA offshoots exist in other parts of India as well.\n\nGroup theaters like \"Nandikar\", \"Spandan\" of Kolkata still produce their dramas often in the line of the IPTA movement, and recently there has been effort to start a similar movement inspired by the IPTA.\n\nThe Delhi-based theatre company Jana Natya Manch, best known for its street theatre, also emerged from the IPTA in 1973. Noted film director, Ritwik Ghatak made a Bengali film, \"Komal Gandhar\" (1961) set around IPTA theatre group.\n\nThere are many groups which were regionally floated and still continue the legacy of IPTA both Pre and Post independence. Some of the groups which have grown to be biggest of theater groups in India.\n\nFew Prominent ones are: Praja natya mandali - Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, Samudaaya in Karnataka.\n\nAt present IPTA West Bengal is a running organisation led by IPTA West Bengal State Committee. The Secretary is Sri Gora Ghosh, President Sri Hiranmoy Ghosal, Asst. Secretary Sri Ashim Bandyopadhyay. There are many cultural personalities like mass singer Kankan Bhattacharjee, Sankar Mukherjee, Tapan Hazra,Pijus Sarkar, Suvendu Maity, Abhoy Dasgupta etc. There are 19 District Committees under this organisation. No. of Artist members 7000 approx. IPTA W B has been reorganised in its 3rd conference held on 1967 at Kolkata Bagbazar reading room Library.\n\nHundreds of dramas have been produced still today since 1967. Such as \"Bis e June\" by Biru Mukhopadhyay, Bastav Sastra and Buno Hans by Hiren Bhattacharya, Haraner Nat Jamai by Sisir Sen, Telengana,Jowa and Fulwali by Basudeb Dasgupta, Fatik chander Swapnaguli, Hanadaar,Adab, Judhistirer Narak Darsan, Haripadar Panja Larai (Street Drama) by Ashim Bandyopadhyay.

Ramdhanu, Aami Krishna, Virus, Ananta Yatra by Tapan Hazra etc.\n\nIPTA Raigarh was established in 1982 during the first state conference of IPTA which was organized by the Raigarh unit in 1982. Since then Raigarh unit has been active and practicing theatre in this small district of Chhattisgarh (earlier Madhya Pradesh).\n\nIn 1994, when the Golden Jubilee of IPTA was celebrated nationwide, this unit decided to celebrate the Golden Jubilee by organizing a five-day theatre festival during the month of December. Although meant to be a one-off event, it was very well received and later on, it was decided to continue this as an annual event. This is how the National Theatre Festival was born and conceived.\n\nThe same year IPTA was reorganized and it spread its activities, started imparting training and updating artists by means of organizing theatre workshops every year for youth as well as for children. Since 1995, theatre stalwarts like Arun Pandey, Sanjay Upadhyay, Suman Kumar, Gautam Mazumdar, Devendra Raj Ankur, Ranjeet Kapoor, Akhilesh Khanna, Neeraj Wahal, Praveen Gunjan & Anjana Puri have conducted workshops and trained our artists.\n\nBesides organizing theatre workshops and festivals, IPTA Raigarh started participating in various festivals to showcase their productions in different cities like Delhi, Allahabad, Jabalpur, Raipur, Aurangabad, Bhopal, Patna, Gaya, Sagar, Ratlam among the few.\n\nIn 2001, IPTA Raigarh registered itself as ‘IPTA Center for Cultural Resources and Training’ with the Registrar of firms & societies, Government of India.\n\n\"IPTA Center for cultural resources & training\" has emerged as one of the pro-active theatre groups in Chhattisgarh State.\n\nArtistes of the group, including child artistes, have acted in a film \"Chutakan Ki Mahabharat\" produced by Children’s Film Society Of India and Directed by Sankalp Meshram, which won the National Award for the Best Children’s Film in 2005, conferred by the Government of India.\n\nIPTA Raigarh also publishes its annual Magazine \"Rankarm\" which is endorsed by Kendriya Hindi Nideshalaya and is being distributed throughout the country with the help of the same. This magazine has been published annually since 2003.\n\nThe Indian People`s Theatre Association (IPTA) movement in Punjab greatly altered the theatre as it was reoriented toward playing a greater role as an instrument of social change. The IPTA movement in Punjab brought out artists like Shiela Bhatia, Balraj Sahni, Balwant Gargi, Niranjan Singh MaanTera Singh Chan, Joginder Bahrla, Pandit Khalili, the Theatre workers, Parkash Kaur, her younger sister Surinder Kaur, and Amarjit Gurdaspuri the famous folk singers in the service of people's concerns. They made serious efforts to take Punjabi theatre and folk culture to the masses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[Category:Theatre in India]]\n[[Category:Theatrical organisations in India]]\n[[Category:Culture of Kolkata]]\n[[Category:Indian People's Theatre Association people]]\n[[Category:Arts organizations established in 1941]]\n[[Category:Bengali theatre groups]]"}

Kell, is a parameter used to limit the bandwidth of a sampled image signal to avoid the appearance of beat frequency patterns when displaying the image in a discrete display device, usually taken to be 0.7. The number was first measured in 1934 by Raymond D. Kell and his associates as 0.64 but has suffered several revisions given that it is based on image perception, hence subjective, and is not independent of the type of display. It was later revised to 0.85 but can go higher than 0.9, when fixed pixel scanning (e.g., CCD or CMOS) and fixed pixel displays (e.g., LCD or plasma) are used, or as low as 0.7 for electron gun scanning.\n\nFrom a different perspective, the Kell factor defines the effective resolution of a discrete display device since the full resolution cannot be used without viewing experience degradation. The actual sampled resolution will depend on the spot size and intensity distribution. For electron gun scanning systems, the spot usually has a Gaussian intensity distribution. For CCDs, the distribution is somewhat rectangular, and is also affected by the sampling grid and inter-pixel spacing.\n\nKell factor is sometimes incorrectly stated to exist to account for the effects of interlacing. Interlacing itself does not affect Kell factor, but because interlaced video must be low-pass filtered (i.e., blurred) in the vertical dimension to avoid spatio-temporal aliasing (i.e., flickering effects), the Kell factor of interlaced video is said to be about 70% that of progressive video with the same scan line resolution.\n\nTo understand how the distortion comes about, let us consider an ideal linear process from sampling to display. When a signal is sampled at a frequency that is at least double the Nyquist frequency, it can be fully reconstructed by low-pass filtering since the first repeat spectra does not overlap the original baseband spectra. In discrete displays the image signal is not low-pass filtered since the display takes discrete values as input, i.e. the signal displayed contains all the repeat spectra. The proximity of the highest frequency of the baseband signal to the lowest frequency of the first repeat spectra induces the beat frequency pattern. The pattern seen on screen can at times be similar to a Moiré pattern. The Kell factor is the reduction necessary in signal bandwidth such that no beat frequency is perceived by the viewer.\n\n\n\n"}

The series was first announced on July 4, 2008 via the official behind-the-scenes LG15 blog, Inside. It premiered on September 16, 2008 at the New York Television Festival, and was first uploaded for public viewing on September 20, 2008.\n\nThe show continued upon the mythology established by \"lonelygirl15\" and \"KateModern\". Two main characters from the lonelygirl15 series, Jonas (Jackson Davis) and Sarah (Alexandra Dreyfus), were also carried over. Daily content was provided in the form of video blogs, images, text blogs, and other information posted daily from the characters at LG15.com. On the following Saturday, all of the content from the previous week was compiled into one 6- to 10-minute episode to end that week's \"chapter\".\n\nLG15: The Resistance also marked the debut of a new LG15.com website. On September 8, 2008, two-hundred members of the LG15 community were invited to participate in a private beta of the new website. One week later, on September 15, it was officially released. The new LG15.com utilizes social networking capabilities such as member profile pages, a new forum, the ability to upload response videos, and the ability to interact with the show's characters and to help solve in-show puzzles.\n\nEach week of the show featured music from a different artist. \"LG15: The Resistance\" featured the music of Hyper Crush, Film School, Voxtrot, Push Play, The Teenagers, Voyager One, Scissors For Lefty, Killola, Morningwood, Colourmusic, Illa J, Tokyo Police Club, Celldweller, Castaneda, and Warner Drive.\n\nThe first season of the show marks the entrance of the Hymn of None, an organization resisting the Order. The Hymn of None posts videos and blogs trying to convince Jonas to join the Resistance as their leader. Jonas does not want to put his life or anyone else's life in danger, however, so he refuses. Jonas's friend Sarah, on the other hand, wants to help the Hymn of None fight the Order and urges the community to help convince Jonas.\n\nThe Hymn of None posts a video, exposing a company called LifesBlood Labs to be nothing but a sham to get the blood from Trait Positive girls (like the Order).\n\nAfter the Hymn of None saves Jonas from a run-in with the FBI, a video is posted by the Hymn of None showing security camera footage of a girl who was kidnapped by LifesBlood Labs. A few days later, Jonas decides he will join the Resistance. The Hymn of None ask him to find the Samsarine Doctrine, a book which supposedly holds secrets about the Trait Positive gene. Jonas follows clues that turn out to be fake, and he ends up getting kidnapped by LifesBlood Labs. A community member named Reed films Jonas's kidnapping. Sarah tracks down the people who kidnapped Jonas, and after spraying mace in the kidnapper's faces, gets Jonas out of the trunk and drives away with him. The Hymn of None posts more security camera footage of the girl, showing her suffering, and her attempted escape.\n\nThe Hymn of None posts a puzzle leading Jonas and Sarah to the Samsarine Doctrine. Meanwhile, Reed posts a video stating that he is being followed by LifesBlood Labs. Two days later an agent from LifesBlood Labs shows up at Reed's door. Reed makes a narrow escape, and pleads for Jonas and Sarah to help him. Jonas and Sarah ignore Reed and go to get the book. They successfully obtain it, and escape to safety.\n\nThe following week Reed, again, pleads for Jonas and Sarah's help. They decide they will let him join them, and go to Chicago to meet up with him.\n\nThe group travel east. The Hymn of None posts footage from Willow Wood Auctioneers, an auction house. The video is about an item for auction that \"is thought to contain a cure for a rare blood condition that has afflicted many young people throughout the ages\". The video has a puzzle hidden in it, that contains the date and location of the auction.\n\nJonas, Sarah, and Reed are leaving a hotel when they have another run-in with the FBI. Reed creates a distraction and the three make it away safely. They continue to travel. Days later, the Hymn of None posts a blog saying that one of their agents will be making an appearance in an online video chat. The agent turns out to be Maggie Schaeffer, the trait positive girl from the security camera footage. Reed posts a blog asking Maggie to join the group, and although she rejects the invitation, a few days later (on Halloween) she shows up at Reed's friend's apartment (where the group is staying).\n\nJonas, Sarah, Reed, and Maggie finally reach Boston. Sarah goes to the auction by herself only to find an anonymous note telling her that LifesBlood Labs has the cure in LA. The group splits up - Sarah and Reed jet off to LA while Maggie and Jonas stay behind. Once the gang is all in LA, however, Jonas and Sarah get themselves arrested by breaking into the LBL HQ by themselves. Maggie claims she is going to keep her distance, but once Reed gets kidnapped, she snaps back into action. Maggie pulls Jonas and Sarah together, and they rescue Reed.\n\nDuring the \"Day of Atonement\", the Season One Finale, the group steals important information from the Hymn of One Center and kidnaps a LifesBlood Labs doctor. They tell the HoO and LBL that they will give these things back in exchange for the cure. Meanwhile, the FBI is on the group's tail and gets involved in the mix. Maggie discovers that Sarah is working for the Order and sends Reed off with an address. Maggie goes to save Jonas but ends up getting kidnapped. Sarah then reveals her intentions to Jonas and a few Order goons drag him off as well. Reed goes to the address Maggie gave him, and it's an old friend - Daniel from lonelygirl15.\n\n\n\n"}

Some actors are typecast as leads, but most play the lead in some performances and supporting or character roles in others.\n\nSometimes there is more than one significant leading role in a dramatic piece, and the actors are said to play \"co-leads\"; a large supporting role may be considered a \"secondary lead\". Award nominations for acting often reflect such ambiguities. Thus, sometimes two actors in the same performance piece are nominated for Best Actor or Best Actress -- categories traditionally reserved for leads. For example, in 1935 Clark Gable, Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone were each nominated for the Best Actor Academy Award for \"Mutiny on the Bounty\". There can even be controversy over whether a particular performance should be nominated in the Best Actor/Actress or Best Supporting Actor/Actress category.\n\nA title role is often but not necessarily the lead.

The music for the primary feature films (which serves as the basis for the rest of the related media) was written by John Williams. Williams' scores for the eight saga films (and a suite for a spin-off film) count among the most widely known and popular contributions to modern film music, and utilize a symphony orchestra and features an assortment of about fifty recurring musical themes to represent characters and other plot elements: one of the largest caches of themes in the history of film music.\n\nReleased between 1977 and 2017, the music for the primary feature films was, in the case of the first two trilogies, performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and, in select passages, by the London Voices chorus. Williams also scored the seventh and eighth episodes in the franchise's sequel trilogy, and he is currently slated to score the ninth (and last) episode as well. The sequel trilogy was largely conducted by Williams and William Ross, and performed by the Hollywood Freelance Studio Symphony and (in a few passages) by the Los Angeles Master Chorale.\n\nAdditional composers have since contributed music to \"Star Wars.\" The music for several animated television series spin-offs has been written by Kevin Kiner and Ryan Shore. Music for the spin-off films, other television programs, and video games, as well as the trailers of the various installments, were created by various other composers, with this material occasionally revisiting some of Williams' principal themes, and – with the latest spin-off film, with Williams actually writing a new theme for the composer to use. Michael Giacchino was the composer of the first Anthology film, \"Rogue One\", while John Powell scored the second film, \".\"\n\nThe scores are primarily performed by a symphony orchestra of varying size joined, in several sections, by a choir of varying size. They each make extensive use of the \"leitmotif\", or a series of musical themes that represents the various characters, objects and events in the films. Throughout all of the franchise, which consists of a total of over 18 hours of music, Williams has written approximately fifty themes in one of the largest, richest collection of themes in the history of film music.\n\nKevin Kiner composed the score to the film \"\" (2008), the predecessor to the . Both properties loosely use some of the original themes and music by John Williams. Kiner's own material for the film includes a theme for Anakin Skywalker's Padawan learner, Ahsoka Tano, as well as a theme for Jabba the Hutt's uncle Ziro. Kiner went on to score the TV series' entire six seasons, which concluded in 2014. A soundtrack album was released that same year by Walt Disney Records.\n\nKiner continued his work with the franchise for the animated series \"Star Wars Rebels\" (2014), which also incorporates Williams' themes.\n\nRyan Shore serves as the composer for \"Star Wars: Forces of Destiny\" (2017–present).\n\nThe scores utilize an eclectic variety of musical styles, many culled from the Late Romantic idiom of Richard Strauss and his contemporaries that itself was incorporated into the Golden Age Hollywood scores of Erich Korngold and Max Steiner. The reasons for this are known to involve George Lucas's desire to allude to the underlying fantasy element of the narrative rather than the science-fiction setting, as well as to ground the otherwise strange and fantastic setting in well-known, audience-accessible music. Indeed, Lucas maintains that much of the films' success relies not on advanced visual effects, but on the simple, direct emotional appeal of its plot, characters and, importantly, music.\n\nLucas originally wanted to use tracked orchestral and film music in a similar manner to , itself a major inspiration for \"Star Wars\". Williams, however, advised to form a soundtrack with recurring musical themes to augment the story, while Lucas's choice of music could be used as a temporary track for Williams to base his musical choices on. This resulted in several nods or homages to the music of Gustav Holst, William Walton, Sergei Prokofiev and Igor Stravinsky in the score to \"Star Wars.\" Williams relied less and less on references to existing music in the latter seven scores, incorporating more strains of modernist orchestral writing with each progressive score, although occasional nods continue to permeate the music. The love theme from \"Empire Strikes Back\" is closely related to Williams' composition for \"Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark\". The score to has clear resemblances to the successful scores of other contemporary composers of the time, namely Howard Shore's \"Lord of the Rings\", Hans Zimmer's \"Gladiator\" and Tan Dun's\" Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\", with which the movie was most likely scored temporarily. Otherwise, however, his later scores were mostly tracked with music of his own composition, mainly from previous \"Star Wars\" films. Yet, In Williams' score to \"\" he, for the first time in the series, went so as far as to incorporate direct quotes of other compositions, namely \"Aquarela Do Brasil\" by Ary Barroso (in a nod to the 1985 Terry Gilliam film \"Brazil\") and from his own theme for \"The Long Goodbye\" (co-composed by Johnny Mercer). Nevertheless, Williams also started to develop his style throughout the various films, incorporating other instruments, unusual orchestral set-ups (as well as various choral ensembles) and even electronic or electronically attenuated music as the films progressed. Williams often composed the music in a heroic but tongue-in-cheek style, and has described the scored film as a \"musical\".\n\n\"Star Wars\" was one of the film scores that heralded the revival of grand symphonic scores in the late 1970s. One technique that particularly influenced these scores is Williams' use of the \"leitmotif\", which was most famously associated with the operas of Richard Wagner and, in early film scores, with Steiner. A leitmotif is a phrase or melodic cell that signifies a character, place, plot element, mood, idea, relationship or other specific part of the film. It is commonly used in modern film scoring as a device for mentally anchoring certain parts of a film to the soundtrack. Of chief importance for a leitmotif is that it must be strong enough for a listener to latch onto while being flexible enough to undergo variation and development along the progression of the story. The more varied and nuanced the use of leitmotif is, the more memorable it typically becomes. A good example of this is the way in which Williams subtly conceals the intervals of \"The Imperial March\" within \"Anakin's Theme\" in \"\", implying his dark future to come.\n\nAlso important is the density in which leitmotifs are used: the more leitmotifs are used in a piece of a given length, the more thematically rich it is considered to be. Film music, however, typically needs to strike a balance between in terms of the number of leitmotives used, so as to not become too dense for the audience (being preoccupied with the visuals) to follow. Williams' music of \"Star Wars\" is unique in that it is relatively dense for film scoring, with approximately 11 themes used in each two-hour film, of which about 90% is scored.\n\nWilliams re-recorded some of his suites from the first trilogy with the Skywalker Symphony Orchestra as an album. Several of his later themes were released as singles and music videos, and were later released a collection of suites from the six films as a compilation that played to a series of clips from the films, with sparse dialogue and sound effects. These became the basis for a series of hour-long concerts which featured \"Star Wars\" music to images from the films, \"\", which took place in 2009 and 2010. First performed in London, it went on to tour across the United States and Canada, last playing in London, Ontario, Canada on July 25, 2010.\n\nThe scores of the first trilogy (in the form of its Blu-Ray Special Edition release) and \"\" are performed as Live to Projection concerts, but with greatly reduced forces. The performances follow the music of the finished film, with some of the music looped, tracked or omitted entirely, and do not feature any of the diegetic pieces and often omit the choral parts.\n\nJohn Williams sketched the score for his various orchestrations and wrote the music for a full symphony orchestra (ranging from 79 to 113 players overall) and, in several passages, chorus (ranging from 12 to 120 singers overall) and a few non-orchestral instruments. The orchestration is not consistent throughout the different films, but generally the score makes use of a considerable brass section over a comparatively smaller string section, giving the series its heraldic, brassy sound.\n\nSeveral of the scores require larger forces, including a large (over 100-piece) romantic-period orchestra, a mixed choir and even a boy choir, although none of the scores call for particularly immense forces compared to larger film or theater works. Nevertheless, due to added high woodwinds and percussion parts, scores such as Empire Strikes Back and Attack of the Clones call for 106 and 110 players, respectively. The former called for a third harp and fourth bassoon, while the latter (and all prequel scores) utilized a fuller string section. Revenge of the Sith also utilized a second set of timpani. Comparatively, the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy and the sequel trilogy films call for much smaller forces of as little as 82 players, and small choral accompaniment in select cues. The first spin off film, \"Rogue One\", followed the prequel trilogy's instrumentation, using a 110-piece orchestra and 90-piece mixed choir.\n\nIn live performances, the forces are usually greatly reduced: Official were held with as little as 60-piece orchestras and 50-piece mixed choral ensembles or with the choir omitted altogether. However, to recreate the eight scores as they were originally recorded, the following instrumentation is required:\n\n\nJohn Williams wrote a series of themes and motifs for certain characters and ideas in each of the \"Star Wars\" films. The multiple installments allowed Williams to compose some fifty themes (and counting) and reprise some of them extensively, continually developing them over a long period of screen time.\n\nWilliams introduced a few themes in each episode (six themes on average) and focused on making each of his principal themes long-lined and melodically distinct from the others so as to increase their memorability. Williams occasionally forges small connections between some of these themes, sometimes for a narrative purpose and sometimes in the more general favor of cohesion. This technique allowed him (especially in his scores to the first trilogy) to have each theme play out for a large number of occasions (the Force Theme plays over one hundred times in the series) and over long periods of time.\n\nEach score can be said to have a \"main theme\", which is developed and repeated frequently throughout the film, often to unusual extents (such as the frequency in which The Imperial March is revisited during \"Empire Strikes Back\"). Besides the main theme and a handful of other principal themes, Williams forged several smaller motifs for each episode, which are generally not as memorable and at times interchangeable. A main theme for the franchise exists as well (which is the music of the main titles), but a main theme does not exist to represent a particular trilogy. Instead, each trilogy (and to a lesser extent, each film) has its own style or soundscape.\n\nWilliams' Star Wars catalog remains one of the largest collections of leitmotifs in the history of cinema, although – for comparison – it still falls short of Wagner's use of leitmotifs in the \"Ring Cycle\" or even Howard Shore's work on the \"Hobbit\" and \"Lord of the Rings\" films. Both works feature many more themes for a similar or shorter running time; and use the themes more clearly and with more nuance, where Williams prefers to write fewer themes (to allow him to focus on them better) and use them in a more straightforward manner and sometimes, solely for their romantic effect. Shore and Wagner's themes are also inter-related and arranged into sets of subsets of related themes through various melodic or harmonic connections, whereas Williams prefers greater distinction between his themes.\n\nWilliams' use of his themes in \"Star Wars\" is at times romantic rather than strictly thematic, the themes sometimes being used randomly because their mood fits a certain scene, rather than for a narrative purpose. For instance, the theme for Luke Skywalker is also used as the main theme for the entire franchise, as well as a generic \"heroic theme\" in conjunction with various characters without any connection to its namesake. Princess Leia's Theme is used for the death of Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original \"Star Wars\", which has little to do with her character even though she is present in the scene. Yoda's Theme appears several times during the Cloud City sequences in \"The Empire Strikes Back\". The concert piece Duel of the Fates is used several times throughout the prequel trilogy, appearing over the entire final battle in \"The Phantom Menace\" (as opposed to just the lightsaber duel for which it was written); Anakin Skywalker's search for his mother in \"Attack of the Clones\"; and the unrelated Yoda and Darth Sidious's duel in \"Revenge of the Sith.\" Williams' original composition for the Geonosis Battle Arena in \"Attack of the Clones,\" a variation on the Droid Army March, was used for the Utapau assault in \"Revenge of the Sith\". Multiple uses of the Force Theme are also non-thematic.\n\nThe Rebel Fanfare is applied to the Millennium Falcon throughout the original \"Star Wars\", \"The Force Awakens\", and \"The Last Jedi\". It is also used for R2-D2's heroics during the opening action scene in \"Revenge of the Sith\". Kylo Ren's secondary theme, meant to evoke his more conflicted side, but since he quickly makes his allegiances clear, its generally used in tandem with his fanfare to evoke his menace, instead. The Emperor's theme is used in \"\" when Supreme Leader Snoke tortures Rey. Even the melodic connections between some of the themes sometimes do not represent a straightforward dramatic purpose, such as the connection of \"Across the Stars\" to Count Dooku's motif and the Battle of Geonosis in \"Attack of the Clones\". In fact, Some of Williams' themes are written from the outset purely to convey a certain mood rather than evoke a character or setting, such as the Throne Room music of the original \"Star Wars\" or the Pursuit motif from \"The Force Awakens\".\n\nSome of this music was re-tracked into other parts of the film, or even another film in the series, by the filmmakers. \"Attack of the Clones\", the first film to be shot digitally, had major edits made after the scoring process, leading to the inclusion of tracked music over many of the digitally created sequences such as the Droid Factory on Geonosis or the Clone Army's arrival to the battle. These scenes used music such as Yoda's theme or incidental music from \"The Phantom Menace\" with little dramatic connection to what is occurring on screen. In the original \"Star Wars\", some of the music for the Death Star's Trash Compactor scene was used over an extended shot of the arrival into Mos Eisley inserted in the film's Special Edition. Musical similarities exist between the final scenes of \"The Phantom Menace\" with Finn's confession to Rey in \"The Force Awakens\", probably a result of temp-track choice. In other cases, the material wasn't tracked but rather lifted from the original composition and re-recorded, such as in the big action scenes of Return of the Jedi, both of which lift material from the Battle of Yavin and Ben's death.\n\nOther composers for the franchise used Williams' principal themes in their own compositions, whether it be for the trailers to the main films, spin-off films, television series, or video games. More often than not, these composers also use the principal themes more for their emotional effect for their respective projects. Michael Giacchino, for instance, uses the Force Theme in some of the scenes where Rogue One's Starship takes off.\n\nBecause Williams scores one episode at a time and attempts to base each score on new material as much as possible, the musical material does not have a particularly cohesive structure as a whole: the themes for each score are only devised during each film's post-production, so Williams will often come up with a new theme that, in hindsight, would have been preferably introduced, at least in embryonic form, in a previous score: This can be said for the love theme \"Across the Stars\" (for Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala), introduced only in \"Attack of the Clones\" or even \"The Imperial March\", introduced in \"The Empire Strikes Back\". The same can be said about some themes only composed for the prequels (such as Duel of the Fates), which would have been perfectly applicable to the films in the first trilogy, had they been produced in the narrative order. In fact, since the prequels featured both their own stock of leitmotifs and recurring themes from the previous films, they boasted a larger catalog of themes, whereas the use of the leitmotifs in a cycle of works typically involves increasing density towards the later installments in the narrative order. Also, the themes in the prequels appear in shorter, blockier statements and the motives themselves are often short, rhythmic ideas, as opposed to longer melodies used in the first trilogy. Also, in the prequels the motives are often associated with places and events, rather than with characters as they are in the rest of the scores, creating a further discrepancy in the musical narrative.\n\nEven within each trilogy, Williams often abandons a motif after a single score or two (as he did with Anakin's theme), writes (across several films) multiple motifs that serve a similar function (e.g. the Rebel fanfare, the Throne Room March and the Triumph Fanfare in \"Return of the Jedi\"), or writes a motif that he only uses in one installment, such as the Droid motif. In other cases, a motif is supplanted by a new one, as the Imperial March replaced the original, Imperial motif – a problem only confounded when he returned to that theme with the prequels, only for it to disappear entirely for what is now supposed to be the fourth episode; sometimes, the existing motif simply changes its thematic meaning: Ben Kenobi's theme turned into a theme for the Force by \"The Empire Strikes Back\", and Luke's theme – into the \"Star Wars theme\".\n\n\"The Last Jedi\", specifically, departs from Williams method of relying primarily on new thematic material, and instead relies heavily on pre-existing themes, in keeping with Johnson's temp-track choices. As a result, a number of themes and motifs from the previous films are constantly repeated, often in very familiar settings, such as statements of Yoda's and Leia's theme that are lifted from the concert arrangements, a reprise of the Binary Sunset rendition of the Force theme, and recurring statements of Rey's and Kylo's themes. There are some incidental phrases similar to existing themes such as Battle of the Heroes, The Immolation scene, et cetera, and some deliberate, tongue-in-cheek references, such as a quote of the Death Star motif for a scene with a clothes iron that is shot to look like a landing Star Destroyer.\n\nListed below are as 51 recurring themes or leitmotifs, of which about 49 leitmotifs are clearly identified in Williams' scores; as well as two leitmotifs written by Williams for John Powell's upcoming score to \"Solo\" (see Themes in the Anthology films: \"Solo\"). Williams is expected to expand upon this catalog further in his upcoming composition to \"Episode IX\". Whether that score will merit as many themes as his most sparse efforts (\"The Last Jedi\" at three themes), his most dense (\"The Force Awakens\" with eight) or in-line with his average (six themes), Williams will have written between 54 and 60 themes for the series.\n\n\n\"Returning: Throne Room Victory March (First re-statement\"\");\" \"Luke's Theme; Luke's Secondary Theme; The Rebel Fanfare; The Force Theme (Ben Kenobi's theme); Leia's Theme\"\n\n\"Returning: Spaceship Battle Motif;\" \"Luke's Theme; Luke's Secondary Theme; The Rebel Fanfare; The Force Theme; Leia's Theme; The Imperial March; Han Solo and the Princess; Yoda's Theme\"\n\n\"Returning: Luke's Theme, Luke's Secondary Theme, The Rebel Fanfare, The Force Theme, The Imperial March, Yoda's Theme, Jabba's Theme, The Emperor's Theme\"\n\n\"Returning: Shmi's Theme;\" \"Luke's Theme, Luke's Secondary Theme, The Rebel Fanfare, The Force Theme, The Imperial March, The Emperor's Theme, Anakin's Theme, Trade Federation March, Duel of the Fates\"\n\n\"Returning: Jedi Funeral Theme,\" \"Coruscant Fanfare;\" \"Luke's Theme, Luke's Secondary Theme, Leia's theme, The Rebel Fanfare, The Force Theme, The Imperial March, The Emperor's Theme, Anakin's Theme, Trade Federation March, Duel of the Fates, Across the Stars, Across the Stars secondary theme.\"\n\n\"Returning: Luke's Theme, Luke's Secondary Theme, The Rebel Fanfare (Millennium Falcon motif\"\"), The Force theme, Leia's Theme, The Imperial March, Han Solo and the Princess\"\n\n\n\"Returning: Luke's Theme, Luke's Secondary Theme, The Rebel Fanfare (Millennium Falcon motif),The Force Theme, Leia's Theme, Yoda's Theme, Luke and Leia, Han Solo and the Princess, The Imperial March, Spaceship Battle Motif, Death Star motif, The Emperor's Theme, Poe's Theme, Rey's Theme, Kylo Ren's themes, Snoke's Theme\"\n\n\nSince neither Williams nor his office ever provided a full list of the leitmotifs used in every \"Star Wars\" film, there is some controversy around the exact number of themes, with some taking an inclusive approach that identifies various leitmotifs, even where the composer probably never intended for, and others taking an exclusive approach.\n\nOne of the key differences between the two approaches in the way in which Williams' main, long themes are approached: some view them as composed of several leitmotives that can appear (for the very least once) in isolation (i.e. in a separate cue) from the unabridged theme, and may even represent a different facet of the plot element or character that the theme stands for, while others see them as a single theme with multiple components, which can appear in fragmented form by use of only one of the said components to suggest the entire theme.\n\nThe featured list of themes follows what could be deduced to be Williams own approach: certain pieces are described as two separate themes when they were described as such by Williams and/or appear at least twice in isolation from each other (and usually emerge and develop separately to some extent) and serve a different dramatic purpose altogether. Other pieces such as the ostinato accompaniment and B-section of the Imperial March, the introduction figure to Kylo's secondary theme, to Rey's, or the various components of Duel of the Fates did not merit this treatment, because of lack of evidence to authorial intent on the part of Williams (especially given how seldom, in his body of work, he referred to individual sections of his themes as individual leitmotifs) and/or because they only appear in isolation once and/or lack a defined dramatic purpose distinct from the other parts of the unabridged theme. Its also, largely, the approach taken by Matessino, Adams and Lehman.\n\nA particularly noteworthy but ultimately incidental instance is the ostinato accompaniment to the Rebel Fanfare: its only used isolated from the fanfare in lifted material that appears in Return of the Jedi. Otherwise, it always precedes and accompanies the Rebel Fanfare, but often again it extends to underpin large sections of on-screen action and the respective material in the original Star Wars. However, since its not really entirely detachable (on more than one instance, that is) from the Rebel Fanfare and never plays at the front of the orchestra, Adams comments that \"It’s not a theme per se\" and Lehman makes no note of it, even as an incidental motif.\n\nCertain analysts will also list a single melody multiple times under various guises. For instance, the emperor's theme can also be labeled separately (in the same glossary) as the \"dark side\" theme, Darth Sidius' theme, etc...\n\nThe inclusive approach also tends to identify leitmotives even where they don't meet the criteria of recurrence. This is the result of Williams' propensity (in these scores and otherwise) to write material that is either melodic, rhythmic, harmonic or timbral specifically to an individual setpiece or none-recurring plot-element in the film, such as The Battle of Hoth, the Chase through Coruscant, or The Battle of Crait. These individual pieces of music – whether they consist of a full melody, ostinati, diegetic pieces or a certain timbre – have sometimes been described as having thematic significance, occasionally (in fleeting comments) even by Williams himself, but since they do not recur in a different part of the narrative, nor are transformed from or into another motif, they do not comply with the definition of a leitmotif, even if they form the highlights of their respective scores or even featured prominently in the \"making of\" material (e.g. Chase through Coruscant). A case of particular note is the piece Williams designated as the \"Jawa theme.\" While it is a fully realized melody, clearly evoking the \"little scrap and robot collectors\", as Williams called them, it doesn't recur across two discrete cues, rather being just interrupted briefly by Imperial music (the interruption slightly extended in the film by silence) and than resuming.\n\nEven when some of these figures do recur, it is often unclear whether they are substantial enough to be assigned with thematic significance, as these instances often includes material that is incidental in nature, such as several figures used in the finale of \"The Empire Strikes Back;\" material with overly broad (and therefore vague) association to the story such as tragic music written for the Starkiller sequence in The Force Awakens returning for Han Solo's death or \"Tension\" music from Episodes 7 and 8; material that is purely rhythmic or timbral like various \"bouncing\" horn figures for Luke's landspeeder search in the original \"Star Wars,\" the use of the synthesizer to represent Vader's menace in \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" a women's chorus for the underwater scenes of \"The Phantom Menace;\" material that is of a generic nature, such as his use of \"mournful homophonic\" choir in \"The Last Jedi\" for climactic moments; or material that is part of Williams' stylistic choices as a composer, more than a thematic statement unique to the series. For instance, his use of tritones often denotes mystery, a device he uses for the droids landing on Tatooine and again in the concert arrangement of \"The Throne Room.\" He uses a related device to reflect the mystery of Luke's whereabouts in \"The Force Awakens\". However, similar devices are also used in \"Indiana Jones\" to represent the mysteries of the Ark and the Crystal Skull. Hence, it is more of a way for Williams to evoke mystery, than a motif conceived specifically for any one of these scores.\n\nSimilarly, other gestures taken from pre-existing music (such as Williams' use of the Dies Irae melody to denote impending doom) have been falsely identified as leitmotifs, even though Williams clearly described sections of music that rely on this gesture, such as his original take of the binary sunset, as non-thematic.\n\nIn fact, sometimes the supposedly recurring material is similar, but not in fact identical. A good example would be the variety of gestures relating to the dark side, following a piece of music used in the opera-house scene. Lehamn however clarifies that those alleged following statements are \"similar but inexact\" to the earlier gesture. In other cases, variations on the same thematic ideas are erroneously labeled as two or more separate themes, such as a secondary droid motif or a motif for Anakin's immolation, which is in fact a variation on his lament theme. Similarly, the proposed motifs for Mustafar or Anakin's Dark Deeds are in fact variations on Grievous' material, redirected to the evil Anakin.\n\nSometimes, the recurring material is question is not part of the original composition but is rather tracked after-the-fact, or at least lifted, from existing material into a different section of the film, or from material that is recapitulated in a concert piece or end-credits suite. This includes the Podracing fanfare and the ostinato accompaniment of the Rebel Fanfare, which otherwise doesn't appear isolated from the unabridged theme more than once; the mournful writing for French horn at Shmi's funeral, the Arena March from \"Attack of the Clones\" etc. Occasionally, track titles are mistaken for themes.\n\nWilliams had created themes out of none-recurring material by quoting them again in a following score: e.g. the funeral music for Qui Gon being reused (and repurposed) as a general funeral theme in Revenge of the Sith. This, however, does not extend to such gestures being quoted in spin-off scores (e.g. the Asteroid Field in Solo, the material for Imperial Walkers in Rogue One) nor for more fleeting, none-narrative references which Williams provides in his scores.\n\nThe first \"Star Wars Anthology\" score for \"Rogue One\", written by Michael Giacchino, utilizes several themes (and recurring interstitial material) from John Williams, mostly for their Romantic sweep (such as The Force Theme and hints of the Main Theme). It has its own catalog of themes, independent from Williams' material, including a new, third theme for the Empire, although Giacchino also quotes both the original Imperial Motif and The Imperial March.\n\n\"Returning: Luke's Theme; Rebel Fanfare; The Force Theme; Leia's Theme; Imperial Motif; Death Star Motif; The Imperial March\"\n\nFor \"\", John Williams wrote and recorded a concert arrangement for a new theme for Han Solo. In the process of composing the theme, Williams ended up using two separate ideas, each conveying a different aspect of the character, and went as far as to spot the film for places to use each motif; all other leitmotifs and other material were written and adapted by John Powell, the main composer for the film.\n\n\"Returning: Spaceship Battle motif; Luke's (Star Wars) Theme; Rebel Fanfare; Duel of the Fates; The Imperial March; The Imperial motif; Death Star Motif\"; \"The Asteroid Field\"; \"Imperial Cruiser Pursuit\"\n\nBy John Williams:\n\n\nBy John Powell:\n\n\nInstead of offering a full recording release of a particular film, Williams typically releases a condensed score on album, in which the music is arranged out of the film order and more within the veins of a concert program. These album releases typically include several concert suites, written purely for the end credits or the album itself, where a specific theme is developed continuously throughout the piece. Williams also re-edited some of his existing cues after the fact in order to \"concertize\" theme on the behest of conductors such as Charles Gerhardt. Five of the eight films also have unique credit suites that features alternate concert arrangements of themes and/or a medley of the main themes of a particular film.\n\nFrom \"Star Wars\"\nFrom \"The Empire Strikes Back\"\nFrom \"Return of the Jedi\"\n\nFrom \"The Phantom Menace\"\nFrom \"Attack of the Clones\"\nFrom \"Revenge of the Sith\"\nFrom \"The Force Awakens\"\nFrom \"The Last Jedi\" \n\nFrom \"Rogue One\"\nFrom \"Solo\"\n\n\nDiegetic music is music \"that occurs as part of the action (rather than as background), and can be heard by the film's characters\". In addition to the orchestral scope that was brought on by John Williams' musical score, the \"Star Wars\" franchise also features many distinguishing diegetic songs that enrich the detail of the audio mise-en-scène. Some of this diegetic music was written by John Williams; some by his son, Joseph; and some by various other people.\n\nFrom \"Star Wars\"\nFrom \"Return of the Jedi\"\n\nFrom \"The Phantom Menace\"\n\nFrom \"Attack of the Clones\"\n\nFrom \"The Force Awakens\"\n\nFrom \"The Last Jedi\"\n\n\nThe score for the original \"Star Wars\" film of 1977 won John Williams the most awards of his career: \n\nHe also received the 1977 Saturn Award for Best Music for both the \"Star Wars\" score and his score for \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\".\n\nWilliams's score for the 1980 sequel, \"The Empire Strikes Back\", also earned him a number of awards:\n\n\"The Empire Strikes Back\" was also nominated in 1981 for Best Original Score the 53rd Academy Awards (the award was won by Michael Gore for \"Fame\").\n\nWilliams's subsequent \"Star Wars\" film music was nominated for a number of awards; in 1984 his score for \"Return of the Jedi\" was nominated for Best Original Score at the 56th Academy Awards. His compositions for the prequel trilogy also received nominations: the score for \"The Phantom Menace\" was nominated for Best Instrumental Composition at the 2000 Grammy Awards and \"Revenge of the Sith\" was nominated at the 2006 Grammy Awards for Best Soundtrack Album.\n\nIn 2005 the 1977 soundtrack for \"Star Wars\" was voted as the \"most memorable film score of all time\" by the American Film Institute in the list AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores, based on the assessment of a jury of over 500 artists, composers, musicians, critics and historians from the film industry.\n\nIn 2016, John Williams was nominated for an Oscar fo Best Original Score, his 50th overall nomination, for his score to \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\". He would later go on to win the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media for the film, his 23rd Grammy win overall. In 2018, Williams would go on to be nominated for Best Original Score at the 90th Academy Awards, for his score to \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\".\n\nThe soundtracks to both \"Star Wars\" and \"\" have been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, for shipments of at least 1 million units, with the albums for \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"\" being certified Gold (500,000 units). The British Phonographic Industry certified \"Star Wars\" and \"Episode I\" as Gold for shipments of over 100,000 units in the UK.\n\n"}
{"id": "10012738", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10012738", "title": "National cinema", "text": "National cinema\n\nNational cinema is a term sometimes used in film theory and film criticism to describe the films associated with a specific nation-state. Although there is little relatively written on theories of national cinema it has an irrefutably important role in globalization. Film provides a unique window to other cultures, particularly where the output of a nation or region is high. Countries like South Korea, Russia and Iran have over the years produced a large body of critically acclaimed films. Regardless of the stories or styles of filmmaking the medium inherently contains a dense wealth of information about people and places through which audiences gain knowledge.Like other film theory or film criticism terms (e.g., \"art film\"), the term \"national cinema\" is hard to define, and its meaning is debated by film scholars and critics. A film may be considered to be part of a \"national cinema\" based on a number of factors. Simply put, a \"nation's cinema\" can be attributed to the country that provided the financing for the film, the language spoken in the film, the nationalities or dress of the characters, and the setting, music, or cultural elements present in the film. To define a national cinema, some scholars emphasize the structure of the film industry and the roles played by \"...market forces, government support, and cultural transfers...\"\nMore theoretically, national cinema can refer to a large group of films, or \"a body of textuality... given historical weight through common intertextual 'symptoms', or coherencies\". In \"Theorising National Cinema\", Philip Rosen suggests national cinema is a conceptualization of: (1) Selected 'national' films/texts themselves, the relationship between them, which be connected by a shared (general) symptom. (2) an understanding of the 'nation' as an entity in synchronicity with its 'symptom'. And (3) an understanding of past or traditional 'symptoms', also known as history or historiography, which contribute to current systems and 'symptoms'. These symptoms of intertextuality could refer to style, medium, content, narrative, narrative structure, costume, Mise-en-scène, character, background, cinematography. It could refer to cultural background of those who make the movie and cultural background of those in the movie, of spectatorship, of spectacle.\n\nCanadian cultural and film critics have long debated how Canadian national cinema can be defined, or whether there is a Canadian national cinema. Most of the films shown on Canadian movie screens are US imports. If \"Canadian national cinema\" is defined as the films made in Canada, then the canon of Canadian cinema would have to include lightweight teen-oriented fare such as \"Meatballs\"(1979), \"Porky's\" (1983) or \"Death Ship\" (1980). Other critics have defined Canadian national cinema as a \"...reflection of Canadian life and culture.\" Some critics argue that there are \"two traditions of filmmaking in Canada.\" The \"documentary realist tradition\" espoused by the federal government's National Film Board and avant-garde films.\n\nScott MacKenzie argues that by the late 1990s, if Canada did have a popular cinema with both avant-garde and experimental elements, that was influenced by European filmmakers such as Jean-Luc Godard and Wim Wenders. MacKenzie argues that Canadian cinema has a \"...self-conscious concern with the incorporation of cinematic and televisual images\", and as examples, he cites films such as David Cronenberg's \"Videodrome\" (1983), Atom Egoyan's\" Family Viewing\" (1987), Robert Lepage's \"The Confessional (Le Confessionnal)\" (1995) and Srinivas Krishna's \"Masala\" (1991).\n\nFrance's national cinema includes both popular cinema and \"avant-garde\" films. French national cinema is associated with the auteur filmmakers and with a variety of specific movements. Avant-garde filmmakers include Germaine Dulac, Marie and Jean Epstein. Poetic Realism filmmakers include Jean Renoir and Marcel Carné. The French New Wave filmmakers include Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut. The 1990s and 2000s \"postmodern cinema\" of France includes filmmakers such as Jean-Jacques Beinex, Luc Besson and Coline Serreau.\n\nDuring the German Weimar Republic, German national cinema was influenced by silent and sound \"Bergfilm\" (this translates to \"mountain film\"). During the 1920s and early 1930s, German national cinema was known for the progressive and artistic approaches to filmmaking with \"shifted conventional cinematic vocabulary\" and which gave actresses a much larger range of character-types. During the Nazi era, the major film studio UFA was controlled by Propaganda Minister Goebbels. UFA produced \"Hetzfilme\" (anti-Semitic hate films) and films which emphasized the \"theme of heroic death.\" Other film genres produced by UFA during the Nazi era included historical and biographical dramas that emphasized the achievements in German history, comedy films, and propaganda films.\n\nDuring the Cold War from the 1950s through the 1980s, there were West German films and East German films. Film historians and film scholars do not agree whether the films from the different parts of Cold War-era Germany can be considered to be a single \"German national cinema.\" Some West German films were about the \"immediate past in sociopolitical thought and in literature\". East German films were often Soviet-funded \"socially critical\" films. Some East German films examined Germany's Nazi past, such as Wolfgang Staudte's \"Die Mörder sind unter uns\" (\"The Murderers Are Among Us\").\n\nThe New German Cinema of the 1970s and 1980s included films by directors such as Fassbinder, Herzog, and Wim Wenders. While these directors made films with \"many ideological and cinematic messages\", they all shared the common element of providing an \"aesthetic alternativ(e) to Hollywood\" films and \"a break with the cultural and political traditions associated with the Third Reich\"(159).\n\nAfter World War II, the Lódz Film School was founded in 1948. During the 1950s and 1960s, a \"Polish School\" of filmmakers developed, such as Wojciech Has, Kazimierz Kutz, Andrzej Munk and Andrzej Wajda. According to film scholar Marek Haltof, the Polish School of directors made films which can be described as the \"Cinema of Distrust.\" In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wajda, Krzysztof Zanussi and Barbara Sass made influential films which garnered interest outside of Poland. However, even though Western countries became increasingly interested in Polish cinema during this period, the country's film infrastructure and market was disintegrating.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to determine and define a 'national cinema', much of what many consider Mexican national cinema, but not limited to, is Golden Age of Mexican Cinema and films that revolve around the Mexican Revolution. Unique trajectories of Mexican cinema's development shaped historically specific understandings of the ontology of the moving image, leading to unique configurations of documentation and fictionalization. The Revolution spilled across pages of the press, and became the primary subject of Mexican films produced between 1911 and 1916. There was a high interest in topicality in and capturing current events as they unfolded, re-staging, or combining both approaching, created a sensationalist appeal in these visual 'records' of death and injury. Compilation documentaries, such as Toscano's Memorias de un Mexicano in the years following the Mexican Revolution can be seen as part of a broader cultural politics of nationalism that worked to naturalize and to consolidate the political and ideological story of the revolution.\n\nLater narrativized dramas, such as María Candelaria, The Pearl (film), Enamorada (film), Rio Escondido, Saián Mexico, or Pueblerina by Emilio Fernandez and/or Gabriel Figueroa, are often considered part of the Mexican national cinematic body. These films, and most popular films of the 1920s in Mexico, adopted David Bordwell's \"cinematic norms\": narrative linkage, cause and effect, goal oriented protagonists, temporal order or cinematic time, and filmic space as story space. But also, is noted to have incorporated visual folkloric style of José Guadalupe Posada, the deconstructing landscapes of Gerardo Murillo, and the low angles, deep focus, diagonal lines, and 'native' imagery in Sergei Eisenstein's Que Viva Mexico ! Although a mélange of Western and Mexican influences coexist in Fernandez's films, his Mexican biography and locality leave a legacy of romanticizing Mexico and Mexican history, often presenting idyllic ranches, singing, and a charming life of the poor.\n\nAlthough of European heritage, Louis Buñuel's work in Mexico is another example that presents 'symptoms' of Mexican national identity. Although less well received by lower classes, and more admired by upper classes, Buñuel's Los Olvidados stands as an example that a director's national heritage doesn't always have to contribute to the conceptualization of a nation's cinema. Rather than building the nation through celebration, the film presents problem, which contribute to a global identity and context of the nation state. Buñuel, however, is less interested in presenting some 'identity' of message, national or international, and remarked that \"to ask whether the film is Mexican or not, is to resist, to seek, to disperse, the very mystery this film articulates for us\".\n\nModern genres embraced and nurtured as 'Mexican national cinema' are often those of the social and family melodrama genre, such as Como agua para chocolate (1991) by Alfonso Arau, the working class melodrama (i.e. Danzon in 1991 by Maria Novaro), the comedy (i.e. Sólo con tu pareja, 1991, Alfonso Cuarón) and the rural \"costumbrismo\" film (i.e. La mujer de Benjamin, 1990, by Carlos Carrera). Changes in the politics of film industry instituions allowed these film texts and their directors to \"transform the traditional filmic paradigm\". Up to 60% of financial assistance for national, Latin American, and European productions were provided by the , new models of co-production were created, and distribution and sales channels were opened abroad.\n\n"}

The track has two breaths in quick succession at the start of the song, intended to create a tone of fear and loathing. It is known among other AC/DC songs for its slow blues rhythm, ominous lyrics, as well as its controversy stemming from its association with the Richard Ramirez serial killings in 1985.\n\nIn June 1985, a highly publicized murder case began revolving around Richard Ramírez, who was responsible for more than 15 brutal murders as well as rapes and attempted murders in Los Angeles.

Police also claimed that Ramírez was wearing an AC/DC shirt and left an AC/DC hat at one of his crime scenes. During the trial, Ramírez shouted \"Hail Satan!\" and showed off the pentagram carved into his palm. The incident brought extremely bad publicity to the band, whose concerts and albums were suddenly campaigned against by parents in Los Angeles County.

{"id": "51066796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51066796", "title": "Portrayal of Mormons in comics", "text": "Portrayal of Mormons in comics\n\nThe portrayal of Mormons in comics includes anti-Mormon political cartoons from the 19th and 20th centuries as well as characters in comics who identify as Mormon. In addition, various artists have made comic book versions of parts of The Book of Mormon.\n\nEarly woodcuts from the 1840s depicted Mormons negatively in anti-Mormon literature. In the latter half of the 19th century, political cartoons satirized Mormon issues and events like the Mountain Meadows massacre, polygamy, and the death of Brigham Young. In these political cartoons, Mormons were often portrayed as an ethnic minority. Beginning in 1898 when B.H. Roberts was elected to congress and continuing through Reed Smoot's election to Senate, political cartoons focused on these politicians's ties to Mormonism and polygamy. After Smoot's hearing ended in 1904, cartoons about Mormons were less frequent.\n\n20th-century Mormon comics have some references to Mormons, usually in passing as a cultural reference. Contemporary comics like \"Salt City Strangers\" and \"Stripling Warrior\" focus on the experiences of Mormon characters.\n\nVarious artists have depicted parts of \"The Book of Mormon\" in comic book form. In 1947, John Philip Dalby and Henry Anderson both published comics summarizing Book of Mormon stories. Ric Estrada's \"Peace with Honor\" fill-in story of Coriantumr was published in \"GI Combat\" #169 and his illustrations appeared in the LDS church's \"New Testament Stories\" in 1980. Mike Allred published three volumes of \"The Golden Plates\" in 2004 and 2005, which also summarizes events in \"The Book of Mormon\". Other artists have attempted similar projects. Several events from LDS church history are also depicted in comics.\n\nMembers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (referred to as Mormons) have long been a subject of satirical humor. Illustrated anti-Mormon books and newspaper columns were commonplace throughout the United States during the 19th century.\n\nSome of the earliest forms of illustration used to poke fun at the LDS faith were the woodcuts done by Eber D. Howe. He used these cuts published in 1834 to depict tall tales surrounding the account of Joseph Smith's acquisition of the golden plates. The next major anti-Mormon publication was done in 1842 and was an exposé turned book called \"History of the Saints\", written by ex-Mormon John C. Bennett with woodcuts by F.E. Worchester and an illustration by Reverend Henry Caswall. In 1842, Sidney Roberts published \"Great Distress and Loss of American Citizens\" in which two prints, \"A Partial View of the Massacre of the Mormons\" and \"Mormon's leaving the city of Nauvoo, February 1st, 1846\", depicted the plight of the Mormons. Soon after, more ex-Mormon publications appeared, such as \"An Authentic History of Remarkable Persons\". As the woodcuts were not used as often, by 1847 caricatures had become more prevalent and were used to portray the Council of the Twelve Apostles in a book written by ex-Mormons Maria and Increase Van Deusen. Their book went through twenty-three editions during an eighteen year period and focused on aspects of temple worship and ceremonies sacred to the Mormons and included a detailed, fold-out illustration with color.\n\nIn 1857, the first Mormon serial cartoons, later known as comics, emerged as part of \"Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper\" and bridged the subject of how women in the Mormon militia would affect the outcome of the Utah War. Other comics published that year focused on the Mountain Meadows massacre, depicting Mormons as people who were ignorantly obedient to a cruel prophet. The following year another serial cartoon appeared in \"Nick Nax\" and portrayed the family and gender dynamics in the Mormon community. The most prevalent topic for Mormon criticism in the media during this time period surrounded the newly adopted practice of plural marriage. The illustrations entitled \"Brigham Young the Great American Family\" in \"Frank Leslie's Budget\" and \"The Family Bedstead\" in \"Roughing It\", published in the 1870s, both satirised Mormon polygamy. In 1872 a ten-panel serial cartoon in \"Leslie's Weekley\" depicted a scene in which many Mormon women sought a Japanese ambassador's hand in marriage, entitled \"The Adventures of the Japanese Ambassador in Utah\". Animalistic depictions of polygamy were also common. One example is \"The Lantern's\" depiction of a rooster surrounded by many hens with the caption \"A foul (fowl) piece of Mormonism\".\n\nYoung's announcement of the implementation of the United Order in 1874 gave rise to another wave of satirical cartoons. Most of these were related to the illustrated periodical entitled \"Enoch's Advocate\" printed by anti-Mormons in Utah. The Beecher-Tilton Scandal Case of 1875 inspired a resurgence of Mormon-related comics. Although this adultery case was not directly related to Mormonism, for a few years following Young's death in 1877, the magazine \"Puck\" and other print sources related that Beecher was qualified to be his successor as president of the Mormon church.\n\nDuring the rest of the 1870s and continuing during the 1880s, most of the comics relating to Mormonism had ties to politics. One example depicts the many difficulties that the newly elected President Cleveland would face during his presidency in the comic from \"Puck\" entitled \"Foes in His Path.-The Herculean Task Before Our Next President.\" These problems were illustrated and the typical personification of Mormonism, which included an old bearded man with the word \"Mormonism\" written around his waist and some depiction of his many wives, was shown among them.\n\nIn 1879, \"The Wasp\" introduced the comparison of the Mormons with other groups such as Chinese, blacks, native Americans, and Irish peoples in a cartoon portraying Uncle Sam kicking said groups out of his bed. Many similar cartoons depicting Uncle Sam and his annoyance with the diverse religious and ethnic groups that resided in the United States were created during this period. Another way in which the media portrayed Mormons was by combining aspects of the Mormon and Catholic faiths, such as dressing a Mormon man in the religious clothing of the Catholic faith. Many times blacks were portrayed in Mormon polygamist families.\n\nAccording to historian W. Paul Reeve, by the early 1900s, with the intense media coverage of the Reed Smoot hearings, such images became \"part of an effort to trap Mormons in a racially suspect past even as Mormon leaders attempted to shape a whiter future.\" Mormons were keenly aware of the racial slight:\nBetween 1905 and 1909, \"The\" \"Salt Lake Tribune\" included over 600 cartoons relating to Mormonism. Related images were beginning to be produced in not only newspapers and magazines, but in pamphlets, periodicals, and more illustrated books. The Mormon leader and politician B. H. Roberts was elected to Congress in 1898, which put the LDS church in the spotlight once again and the fact that Roberts practiced polygamy caused many problems for him, his family, and the other Mormons still engaged in polygamist relationships. The \"Salt Lake Tribune\" and many other media outlets had a field day after discovering that one of Roberts' plural wives had just given birth to twins.\nA similar reaction occurred in the press when Reed Smoot was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1903. For the next three years, many cartoons and comics were created surrounding Smoot's office. One of the most iconic of these sketches was \"What They Expected at Washington\" created by the cartoonist Lovey, which shows a train with one car for husbands, many more cars for wives, and then continuing off into the distance are the train cars full of Mormon children. The anti-Mormon sentiment in \"The Salt Lake Tribune\" was fueled by its owner, Republican senator Thomas Kearns. Although Kearns and Smoot were initially friendly, according to Michael Paulos, Smoot's political success came a cost of Kearns's, and Kearns hired ex-Mormon Frank J. Cannon to edit the \"Tribune\". Cannon's extreme anti-Mormonism, as reflected in the \"Tribune\" at the time, was noted sarcastically by non-Mormons: \"How proud we Gentiles are of our self-constituted champions in the fight the Tribune is making on the Mormons!\"\n\nIn 1904, after Smoot was officially seated in the Senate, the national media's intense interest in Mormonism slowly declined and because of new forms of communication and transportation people were able to learn more about the Mormons on a personal level instead of relying on the information provided in the comics of the daily newspaper.\n\nMany popular comic depictions included Mormon women who were impoverished, uncultured, hideous, unfaithful, overbearing, and overworked slaves to their husbands. They were also often depicted as being members of a harem and being part of a lustful marital lifestyle. During this time in history most women were portrayed in a negative light in the media, but because of the controversy of polygamy in Mormon culture, the amount of ridicule that Mormon women received was far worse than that received by their non-Mormon counterparts.\n\nComic book adaptations of Sherlock Holmes's \"A Study in Scarlet\" were among the first portrayals of Mormons in comics. The first comic book adaptation of \"A Study in Scarlet\" was in \"Classic Comic\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 33rd issue, drawn by Louis Zansky. Zanksy's adaptation did not feature Mormons prominently, but the 1953 version of the story by Seymour Moskowitz did. A 1995 adaptation by Ricard Longaron \"Une etude en rouge\" and a 2010 adaptation by Ian Edgington and N. J. Culbard also depict Mormons as manipulative. Mormons are also negatively portrayed in Chick Publications's small 1984 comic booklet \"The Visitors\" in which two Mormon missionaries fail to convert their investigator when the investigator's niece asks them about more controversial Mormon doctrines.\n\nThe popular Italian comic book series \"Tex Willer,\" set in the American West, mentions Mormons, Danites, and the Mountain Meadows massacre.\n\nOther portrayals of Mormons in comics are references to current events or places. Published in the 1970s, issue #23 of Howard the Duck contains a duo who parody Don and Marie Osmond called the Dearth Vapors, who suffocate their opponents with the sweetness that comes out of their mouths. \"Godzilla, King of Monsters\" #13 depicted Godzilla and another monster leaving the Salt Lake temple in ruins on the cover. In the actual comic, the temple was not destroyed. In a \"Captain America\" comic book published in 1980 in issue #246, Joe Smith seeks revenge on Martin Harris for the death of his son, Joseph Smith Jr. While Joseph Smith Sr. never tried to kill Martin Harris, the names and situation are inspired by Mormon history.\n\nSome characters in comic books are Mormon to add interest to their character. A Kickstarter-funded comic, \"Salt City Strangers\", follows five superheroes who explore Mormonism in different ways; none of the creators themselves are Mormon. The series draws on local history and legends, with characters like \"the gull\" (a reference to the Miracle of the gulls) and \"Den Mother\" (a name for a women who leads cub scouts). \"Stripling Warrior\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s superhero is a gay Mormon. Artist James Neish said he wanted \"to show that a gay character is every bit as worthy in the eyes of God as any heterosexual one.\" Writer Brian Anderson said that the series was based on his own experiences as a gay Mormon.\n\nIn the alternate-history Captain Confederacy comic, Dr. Deseret is a Mormon who boldly contradicts polygamous Mormon men and suffers from an addiction to performance-enhancing drugs. A Mormon police detective, Jacob Raven, appears in \"Spider-man: The Lost Years\". Mallory Brook, a Mormon lawyer in the same law firm as She-Hulk, is a prominent character in the series.\n\nJohn Held Sr. (father of John Held Jr.) contributed illustrations to the 1888 \"The Story of the Book of Mormon\".\n\nJohn Philip Dalby published an unfinished comic version of the Book of Mormon published in the Deseret News starting in 1947. Strips filled a full newspaper broadside. Publication was sporadic after 1948, and the last strip was published in 1953. Dalby followed the Book of Mormon chronologically; he started his series in Ether and covered 1 Nephi through 3 Nephi 16. Herald Publishing House, owned by the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, also published a pictorial version of the Book of Mormon in 1947. The book by Henry Anderson was called \"The First Americans\" and summarized the Book of Mormon.\n\nRic Estrada wrote a fill-in story for DC's \"GI Combat\" in #169 called \"Peace with Honor,\" which recounted a Book of Mormon story where Shiz and Coriantumr battle to the death. Mormon missionaries used a page from the story to teach potential converts about the gospel, and in 1980, Estrada illustrated \"New Testament Stories\" for the LDS Church.\n\nIn the 21st century, several artists have tried their hand at adapting Book of Mormon stories to comics. In 2004 and 2005 Mike Allred created and published \"The Golden Plates\", a three-volume, twelve-part comic book series that covers the Book of Mormon events from First Nephi to the Words of Mormon. His wife Laura Allred colored the comics. The series is unfinished and out of print. A unique aspect of these comics is the presence of Mormon women who are portrayed as being hard-working and intelligent. Nephi's wife is shown at his side during most of the text, which gives her a clearer role than that shown in the Book of Mormon itself. In 2009, Micah Acker published a comic book volume \"Nephite Nation\", which contains the story of Ammon. Stephen R. Carter, editor of \"Sunstone\" and artist Jett Atwood published two volumes of \"Book of Mormon\" comics in 2012 and 2015 respectively, telling stories from the Book of Mosiah. Also in 2012, Michael Mercer published \"From the Dust\", the beginning of what was to be an ambitious retelling of the \"Book of Mormon\", but the project was halted in 2014 due to a lack of marketing funds.\n\nIn 1948, Deseret Book Company published \"Blazing the Pioneer Trail\" with text by Floyd Larson and illustrations by Forrest Hill. The comic booklet contained a faithful account of the Mormon migration in 1847. Eileen Chabot Wendel also published comic book episodes from the Book of Mormon in her \"Stories from the Golden Records\". Ric Estrada wrote and illustrated Mormon material for DC Comics in his story \"The Mormon Battalion\" in No. 135 of \"Our Fighting Forces\". Sal Velluto, an artist who has worked for DC and Marvel, was an art director for The Friend. In his \"Blammo #7\", published in 2011, Noah Van Sciver portrays the First Vision, the Angel Moroni visiting Smith, and the publishing of the Book of Mormon.\n\n"}

A 2014 survey by the Human Rights Commission of the Maldives (HRCM) estimated there were 1,139 female prostitutes on the islands. Some women enter the country posing as tourists but then engage in sex work.\n\nSex trafficking and child prostitution are problems in the country.\n\nFollowing complaints that sexual services were being offered in spas in hotels, and a protest in the capital, Malé, by the opposition Adhaalath Party, the government ordered the closure of the spas in 1,000 hotels in late December 2011. Following pressure from the country's tourism industry, president Mohamed Nasheed lifted the ban a few days later.\n\nChild prostitution is a problem in the country, especially in Malé and in the Laamu Atoll region. According to Psychologist Dr Aishath Ali Naaz, it is so common in some areas that its regarded as 'normal'. Often the prostitution is arranged by family members.\n\nThe HRCM estimate 8% of female prostitutes on the island are underage.\n\nArticle 88(a) of the Maldivian Penal Code 1967 includes Sharia Law into the country's legislation. Sex outside marriage is outlawed under Sharia Law, as are other forms of 'immorality', therefore prostitution is forbidden.\n\nPublic order and immigration laws are also used against sex workers. Foreigners who engage in prostitution can expect to be deported and Maldivians can expect a prison sentence.\n\nWhilst condoms are allowed to be sold to married couples, they cannot be sold to single people. Condoms and lubricants are sometimes confiscated by the police and used as evidence of prostitution.\n\nThe Maldives are a destination country for women, and children subjected to sex trafficking, and a source country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. A small number of women from Asia, Central Asia, and Eastern Europe, as well as girls from Bangladesh and Maldives, are subjected to sex trafficking in the Maldives. Maldivian women may be subjected to sex trafficking in Sri Lanka.\n\nA Thai hotelier reported in 2013 that Thai women were being recruited with offers for good jobs in the Maldives, but on arrival being forced into prostitution.\n\nThe Prevention of Human Trafficking Act (PHTA) criminalises some, but not all forms, of sex trafficking. For the first time, in 2016, the government secured a conviction under the PHTA. Three foreign nationals were each sentenced to 10 years imprisonment in a sex trafficking case.\n\nIn November 2016, the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau (SLFEB) arrested 2 men in connection with trafficking Sri Lankan women to the Maldives, where they worked in brothels. More than 100 women were thought to be involved. A Maldivian man was also being sought.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks the Maldives as a 'Tier 2 Watch List' country.\n"}

Two years later, on August 21, 1959, the Catholic University of Chile made an experimental transmission between its main campus and the \"El Mercurio\" newspaper headquarters, both in Santiago's downtown, inaugurating the country's second channel, Canal 13, occupying frequency 2 for a few years (now 13).\n\nColor television debuted in February 6, 1978.\n\nAccording to the 2002 census, 87% of Chilean households had at least one color television set. According to a November–December 2011 nationwide poll by CEP, 88.6% of Chilean households had at least one color television set, 0.9% didn't and 10.5% did not answer. Sixty percent of those households that said they owned at least one color TV set also said they had cable or satellite television.\n\nIn Chile, there are 1,138,718 cable television subscribers (55.3%) and 921,490 satellite television subscribers (44.7%) as of September 2011. The household penetration rate for cable and satellite television stands at 40.4% as of September 2011.\n\nOn 14 September 2009, Chile announced its decision to adopt the Japanese standard ISDB-T with MPEG-4 for digital terrestrial television, joining Argentina and Peru. The analog switchoff is scheduled for 2019. (Chile had delayed its decision on which digital terrestrial television standard to adopt. In late October 2008, the President submitted a bill to Congress detailing the legal framework for DTTV broadcasting in the country, but without defining which standard would be used.)\n\nTVN, Chile's state-owned channel, has made digital terrestrial television broadcast tests since 1999. Canal 13 has been doing so since 2007 in Santiago only, transmitting in three DTV formats (ATSC, DVB and ISDB). In Valparaiso, UCV TV was to start in June 2010 demonstrative ISDB-Tb broadcasting for the Valparaíso/Viña del Mar area, using an 800 watts transmitter.\n\nHDTV-ready television sets are widely sold in Chile, and cable and satellite television companies transmit limited HD content to its subscribers (27 HD channels in VTR (2 national-free, 4 Premiums, 21 basic), the country's largest cable TV provider).\n\n"}

It was first released in Japan on October 20, 2005, and was later released in Europe on February 10, 2006, and in North America three days later. It is a prequel to \"\".\n\nThe premise of the game is that the player's female love interest gets into perilous situations or is placed out of reach from the male protagonist. A minigame must be completed in order to rescue her, or sometimes, get the male protagonist out of trouble. All of these minigames require use of the stylus, and the DS to be held in a certain way, even upside-down. Some require use of the DS built-in microphone.\n\nAt the beginning, the protagonist is riding down an escalator when he sees an attractive woman riding the opposite escalator. He immediately falls in love with her, and races back up the escalator to chase her. Upon reaching the top, he professes his love with a rose, but discovers twelve competitors who are also smitten with the heroine. He attempts to prove his uniqueness over the others by playing a nearby piano, the first of several acts he performs to get her attention. His rivals respond by dropping in on parachutes when the heroine is walking down the street, only to be shot down by the protagonist, who appears from a nearby manhole, using a blowgun. Later, an unknown man hands the protagonist a \"love disc\" which he throws at the heroine to increase her affection for him\n\nSome time later, the protagonist is attempting to seduce the heroine in a local park, and his rivals have caught wind of his plan and are rushing over to stop him. On the way, the rivals knock over a mysterious girl in a lavender dress, who falls toward the park fountain. Before she falls in, the protagonist saves her, then rushes off toward the heroine. The girl falls in love with him at first sight, and appears to recognize him as he leaves. Meanwhile, the protagonist attempts to make eye contact with the heroine while his rivals form a ring around her to block him. Despite their attempts, he manages to catch her attention, and begins walking alongside her. Frustrated, his rivals challenge him to a manly contest of rock-paper-scissors for the right to be with the heroine. After defeating them, they are left exhausted on the floor, but the protagonist helps them back up. For his gentlemanly attitude, the rivals decide that he is worthy of the heroine, and subsequently befriend him, supporting his relationship with her. \n\nWhile walking with his newfound companions, the protagonist finds the heroine watching a fireworks display across the river, unaware of his presence. Encouraged by his friends, he takes advantage of the romantic mood to confess his feelings for her, and she accepts his confession, marking the beginning of their official relationship.\n\nHowever, his friends who have been watching and cheering from behind them are suddenly trapped in a purple cage and flown off by helicopter to an unknown location. Here, the lavender-dressed girl uses a machine to control their minds, turning them into her servants. She commands them to capture the protagonist and bring him to her. \n\nLater, the protagonist goes on a date with his new girlfriend, trying to impress her with a daring unicycle stunt. He attempts to cycle across the scaffolding between the roofs of two buildings, to take a picture with his girlfriend who is on the other side. While he rides, his brainwashed friends climb the scaffolding to abduct him and he must dodge them on his way to the heroine. Having thwarted this attempt, the protagonist and heroine continue their date, riding a bull together. Once again, the brainwashed attackers try to interfere, donning bull masks and chasing after the couple, who must fend them off while not attacking the gentlemen walking down the same street. After many minions are defeated, a large purple robotic bull enters, ridden by the lavender-dressed girl, who launches love potions at the protagonist. The robotic bull is eventually defeated and the couple ride off.\n\nThe bull ride ends when the heroine notices her house, introducing the protagonist to her parents. While in the house, she does yoga to relax, aided by the protagonist who holds a rose to her nose to soothe her. However, the lavender-dressed girl arrives at the house, and passes a cable through the window to infect the heroine's computer with a virus which opens windows rapidly while the protagonist tries to close them. He soon discovers the girl squatting outside the window and jumps out to confront her when her minions knock him unconscious, and another purple cage drops on all of them. The protagonist is then taken with his brainwashed friends to another unknown location.\n\nUpon waking up, the protagonist is tied to a chair, with the lavender-dressed girl sitting on a table in front of him and staring at him intensely. She reminds him that they've met before, and he remembers her as the genius girl who used to live next to him ten years ago. She exclaims that he's gotten handsome, and invites him to fall in love with her, throwing various food items across the table at him. Her own rancidly bad cooking is mixed in with actual food items, and the protagonist must avoid the bad items while consuming the good ones. Taking him to a different part of what is revealed to be her mansion, she continues to press her invitation, more impatiently this time, while shooting him with love potions from an array of cannons. As the tied-up protagonist dodges her potions by rolling around, she becomes increasingly agitated, eventually jumping at the protagonist herself, which knocks her unconscious while her minions rush over to help. The protagonist takes advantage of this distraction to untie himself and escape, but upon leaving the mansion he finds himself in a large jungle. \n\nConfused, the protagonist comes to a river, when he sees his girlfriend, the heroine, waving at him from upstream. He is surprised at her presence, and rows to her on a log while dodging crocodiles and other river objects. When he reaches her, she explains that she also rushed out the window when he was knocked unconscious, and was thus trapped in the same cage which delivered him here. Together, they explore the jungle in search of food, working together to harvest fruits from a tall tree. As they eat the fruit and chat, the lavender girl is shown to have discovered their location, riding on her helicopter. While exploring, they find a spring of water and the heroine decides to take a dip, stripping to her underwear. Unbeknownst to her, the lavender girl releases piranhas and other dangerous fish into the spring, which the protagonist must divert with his finger as a lure. The heroine finishes her dip, and the protagonist makes her new clothes from leaves of different shapes. They continue exploring the jungle, and discover an ancient temple. While walking to the temple, they trigger a pit trap which leads them on a minecart ride through the temple, after which they exit, having grown closer. \n\nFrustrated by their relationship progressing, the lavender girl watches the couple from behind the bushes while they sit in a tree and flirt. She comes up with an idea, and interrupts their flirting with a blast from a cannon mounted on a boat. They fall into the water nearby, and the protagonist rescues the heroine from having her leg trapped in a giant clam. As they swim back to shore, the minions prepare to attack, but suddenly run away. The couple turns to see a large number of crabs coming from the water, and the protagonist climbs a tree and shakes minions off to knock down chasing crabs. After the horde of crabs is defeated, a large purple robotic lobster appears to climb the tree, but is defeated as well. The concussions from falling from the trees cure the minions of their brainwashing, and they return to being friend with the protagonist. As the protagonist reunites with his friends and girlfriend, the lavender girl climbs out of the robotic lobster, and fires a poisoned dart from a blowgun at the heroine, who collapses unconscious in the protagonist's lap.\n\nSome time later, the heroine's parents receive word that she was poisoned with a serum which will cause her to slowly lose her memories, and the antidote is made from a yellow rose found high up in the mountains. The protagonist journeys with his friends and girlfriend to find the rose and restore her memories. On the snowy mountain trek they encounter many difficulties, such as hiding from bears, staying awake during the cold nights, and tripping and becoming human snowballs. Throughout the journey, the heroine occasionally looks at the picture she took with the protagonist, and the memories she can recall of him decrease in number each time. After she is rescued from rolling down the mountain by the protagonist, they are separated from their companions and spend a night together in a wooden shed and he keeps her warm first with a blanket and later with his body heat. They have a snowball fight and flirt on a tree, after which their friends catch up to them. As they continue their journey, the heroine falls and slides down the mountain, causing the protagonist to chase after her on a sled pulled by his friends. They continue the arduous journey until they finally spot the yellow rose after climbing a cliff. As the protagonist reaches for it, he is interrupted by a large purple robotic bear, which battles him with several inbuilt cannons. He destroys it with snowballs and reaches for the flower, but is stopped by a gigantic purple robotic bird, which scoops up himself, the flower and the snow around it before flying off. \n\nThe protagonist is tied up and brought to another section of the mountain where the lavender girl awaits, declaring that the rose is hers now and he should fall in love with her at last. She personally throws love potions at him, which he destroys by kicking them with his feet while his upper body remains tied. She grows increasingly desperate as he destroys her potions, and finally breaks down, asking him why he rejects her advances, to which he responds that he only loves his girlfriend. Out of spite, the lavender girl runs off with the yellow rose toward her robotic bird, which promptly takes off, with the protagonist chasing after it. As the protagonist chases the bird to a rope bridge, an army of robots on the other side begin crossing the bridge to attack him. He defends himself by using a torch and gasoline from several nearby gentlemen to breathe fire at the robots, destroying them one by one. Meanwhile, back at the original location of the rose, his girlfriend is losing more and more of her memories, forgetting even the confession made under the fireworks which led to their relationship. The only memories that remain are those made on the mountain itself. The protagonist continues chasing the bird through a valley, defeating robots as they appear in a similar fashion to the masked minions during the bull ride. As he is about to be defeated, his friends arrive and fight off the remainder of the robots, which then transform into spherical forms and attempt to run them over. The protagonist redirects one of the robots to catch up to and destroy the others, but by this time the lavender girl has flown off with the rose on her robot bird. She notes that by this time the heroine will have lost all her memories, and, confident in her victory, she shreds the rose and scatters its petals in the wake of the bird's flight.\n\nThe protagonist meets up with his girlfriend, the heroine, but she collapses in his arms once more, leaving him heartbroken. However, as he mourns the loss of her memories, his friends notice the petals of the yellow rose falling from the sky, and they mobilize to search the nearby rose field for the yellow rose's petals. Collecting the entire rose, they finally concoct the antidote, which the protagonist delivers to the unconscious heroine via mouth-to-mouth. It succeeds in reviving her and restoring her memories, and she kisses him while his friends celebrate around them. \n\nHowever, nearby, the lavender girl watches them and is furious that they have thwarted her plans and continue to be happy together. With her robot bird, her strongest invention, she fires at the couple, but they do not back down, beginning the final battle (and final minigame) against the bird and its many weapons. To attack, the couple join hands and spin, creating whirlwinds which strike the bird, while dodging the bird's attacks, first cannons, then walking bombs, and lastly eye beams once it reveals its head. Eventually, the bird is defeated, and with it, the lavender girl, who ejects from it and lands haphazardly on the ground. While she lies face-down, a hand reaches out to her to help her up. Believing it to be the protagonist finally acknowledging her, she is frustrated to find that it is just one of his friends. Meanwhile, the protagonist and heroine reaffirm their feelings for each other, culminating in a kiss which triggers the ending sequence of the game.\n\nSome examples of these minigames are:\n\nThe player's performance is graded as amount of 'Hearts', which are given at the end of a minigame depending on how well they did.\n\nThere are a few multiplayer minigames which involve four differently coloured protagonists competing over the love interest, such as an elimination based game of catching an ever-growing beach ball which eventually explodes, and log rafting while trying to rescue the female from the water, while trying to steal her from other player's log rafts.\n\nThe game received \"average\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of two eights, one seven, and one nine for a total of 32 out of 40.\n\n\"Detroit Free Press\" gave it a score of three stars out of four and stated, \"The music here and the design all are distinctly Japanese, with crazy refrains like \"Rub it!\" being shouted all the time. Don't ask me to explain. Just pick up and enjoy.\" However, \"The A.V. Club\" gave it a C+, saying that \"True love takes more than moony-eyed flirting; Sega needs to get the mechanics right to make the magic happen.\" \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" gave it two-and-a-half stars out of five, stating that the game is \"inventive, creative and strangely compelling, but the more difficult tasks can be frustrating and its lasting appeal is limited.\" \"The Times\" gave it one star out of five and called it \"mind-bogglingly shallow\".\n\n"}

Mary Frere included a version in her 1868 collection of Indian folktales, \"Old Deccan Days\", the first collection of Indian folktales in English. A version was also included in Joseph Jacobs' collection \"Indian Fairy Tales\".\n\nA brahmin passes a tiger in a trap. The tiger pleads for his release, promising not to eat the brahmin. The brahmin sets him free but no sooner is the tiger out of the cage then he says he is going to eat the brahmin, going back on his promise. The brahmin is horrified and tells the tiger how unjust he is. They agree to ask the first three things they encounter to judge between them. The first thing they encounter is a tree, who, having suffered at the hands of humans, answers that the tiger should eat the brahmin. Next a buffalo, exploited and mistreated by humans, agrees it is only just that the brahmin should be eaten. Finally they meet a jackal who, sympathetic to the brahmin's plight, at first feigns incomprehension of what has happened and asks to see the trap. Once there he claims he still doesn't understand. The tiger gets back in the trap to demonstrate and the jackal quickly shuts him in, suggesting to the brahmin that they leave matters thus.\n\nThere are more than a hundred versions of this tale spread across the world. In some the released animal is a crocodile, in some a snake, a tiger and others a wolf. \n\nSome variants are very old, going back at least to the \"Panchatantra\" or \"Fables of Bidpai\" and the Jataka tales. In Europe it appeared some 900 years ago in the \"Disciplina Clericalis\" of Petrus Alphonsi, and later in the \"Gesta Romanorum\" and the \"Directorium Vitae Humanae\" of John of Capua.\n\nThere are also modern illustrated versions of the tale, such as \"The Tiger, the Brahmin & the Jackal\" illustrated by David Kennett and \"The Tiger and the Brahmin\" illustrated by Kurt Vargo. Rabbit Ears Productions produced a video version of the last book, narrated by Ben Kingsley, with music by Ravi Shankar. The variant by Rabbit Ears Productions alters certain bits of the story, where the Brahmin travels alone to gain the opinion of others. An elephant is included as first of the three things (the latter two being the tree and water buffalo) that the Brahmin encounters.\n\n\n"}

However, many of his records have been found to be impossible or unverifiable, and on January 29, 2018, Twin Galaxies removed all of his scores from their leaderboards and banned him permanently. Guinness World Records stripped his records the following day.\n\nRogers is recognized for being the first paid pro video gamer. On July 25, 1983, Walter Day founded the U.S. National Video Game Team and in 1986 Rogers was invited to be part of the team.\n\nOn October 3–5, 2008 Todd joined the \"Five Kings of Gaming\" at the \"E for All\" Expo at the Los Angeles Convention Center to feed the homeless people of Los Angeles.\n\nSeveral of Todd Rogers' records had come under scrutiny for being seemingly impossible or lacking sufficient proof. As listed on the Twin Galaxies leaderboard until January 2018, Rogers' record in the 1980 Activision game \"Dragster\" was a time of 5.51 seconds from 1982. Previously, in 2012, Rogers was awarded the Guinness World Record for the longest-standing world record for that record. However, a speedrunner named Eric \"Omnigamer\" Koziel disassembled the game's code and concluded that the fastest possible time was 5.57 seconds. Previously, Rogers' score was believed to have been verified when he set it in 1982 by a Polaroid photo sent to Activision; however, no copy of the photo exists today.\n\nPrior to January 2018, several other Todd Rogers scores have been individually disputed or removed as well. More stringent investigation into Rogers' record-setting scores began when YouTubers uploaded analysis of several of his disputed scores. Rogers' score of 15 million points in the NES port of \"Donkey Kong\" was removed from the Twin Galaxies leaderboard after it was disputed and a referee discovered that the video tapes of the feat were missing or non-existent. Rogers' time of 32.04 in \"Barnstorming\" was removed from the Twin Galaxies leaderboard after it was discovered it was impossible to achieve even when all the obstacles are removed. Other disputed scores included \"Wabbit\" (where he had a recorded score of 1,698, but the game normally ends when the player reaches 1,300 points and the score only increases in increments of 5), \"Fathom\" (where, based upon other players' verified scores and playtimes, his claimed record would have taken over 325 hours of play to achieve), and \"Centipede\" on the Atari 5200, for which he claimed a score of exactly 65,000,000 (with the next best recorded score being 58,078, 112000% lower than Rogers' claimed record).\n\nOn January 29, 2018, in the wake of many disputes being raised and several scores being proven impossible, the site decided to remove all of his scores and ban him from the site entirely. They notified Guinness World Records regarding their decision. The next day, Guinness stripped all of Rogers' records.\n\n"}

{"id": "5596604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5596604", "title": "War Front: Turning Point", "text": "War Front: Turning Point\n\nWar Front: Turning Point is a real-time strategy video game set in an alternate World War II. It was developed by Digital Reality, and published by CDV and released in 2007 for Microsoft Windows.\n\nThe game is set in a fictional, alternate World War II in which Adolf Hitler is assassinated in the early days of the war, and under the new chancellor, Germany occupies Great Britain. Eventually, Nazi Germany is defeated, but this allows the Soviet Union to advance into Western Europe. The game features both real life and fictional \"experimental\" war machines and units.\n\n\"War Front: Turning Point\" is a real-time strategy game featuring units going from World War II weaponry such as Messerschmitt Me 262 fighter aircraft and M4 Sherman and T-34 tanks, to real-life units that were not present during that war such as Northrop YB-49 jet bomber, to entirely science fictional units like Exoskeleton mechs, freeze rays and shield generators, while all can build a \"Bridging\" tank unit capable of building bridges over bodies of water. Each faction can also build three heroes: individual characters with unique abilities, both passive and active to benefit the player's own units and act against the foe's units. The longer heroes and units remain on the battlefield, destroying units and buildings in the process, the more they can rank up, increasing their abilities, yet lose them if they are killed and re-built. The player can also use aerial support such as calling in paratrooper reinforcements, scouting runs and bomb strikes.\n\n\"War Front: Turning Point\" however has an unconventional RTS feature, being the abilities to manually control pill boxes and turrets to fire upon enemies, like that of a first-person shooter. The camera can also be ordered to follow other units in a third-person perspective, where orders can still be given, but the units not be directly controlled like the turrets.\n\nAlong with the time of day changing dynamically in each game, random weather can affect effectiveness of units and interference. Storms, for example, can damage airplanes, and radars (mini-map view) can become distorted or even temporarily knocked out.\n\n\"War Front: Turning Point\" includes online play through GameRanger. Custom games can have up to ten players playing in one online game.\n\nLike the real World War II Western Allies, they are a coalition of the United States, United Kingdom, and Free France. Because of this, their units are a mixture of each side, such as the British Matilda tank and American M26 Pershing. They have a technological advantage over the other factions, because their buildings are able to power themselves, without the need for power plants. They also have a superior air force that is larger, stronger and more versatile. These include aircraft such as the P-38 Lightning bomber (the only bomber capable of defending itself against interceptors) P-51 Mustang fighters and attack helicopters. The Allies also have the atomic bomb at their disposal, deployed by a Northrop YB-35 and an \"earthquake bomb\" via a Halifax bomber. The Allied experimental unit is the O.R.B. (Omni-Repulsor-Barrier), which is an APC truck with a force-field generator on the back, capable of protecting units, within its deflector shield range, from low to medium attacks.\n\nThe German forces are that of the real-life Wehrmacht, but under new, more effective leadership following the death of Adolf Hitler in the early stages of the war. Their army focuses more on firepower, with a wide range of ground armoured units. German tanks are particularly strong that include real-life and upgraded versions such as the Panzer VIII Maus, Elefant \"tank hunter\" and Tiger tank. They use Me 262 fighter aircraft and Junkers Ju 390s and Horten Ho 229s for bombing runs, with the ability to deploy V-1 flying bombs, which can be upgraded to a V-2 rocket. The Germans also have more varied experimental units than the other two factions. These include jet pack infantry equipped with flame throwers, heavy Exoskeleton mech-like heavy infantry, Sonic tanks that use blasts of sonic waves (rather than conventional ammunition) and the Giant Zeppelin, which uses an aluminium structure and large air-to-ground cannons.\n\nThe Soviet Union is less developed than the Allies and Germans; however, it uses sheer numbers to overwhelm its opposition. It has an expanded and more-effective selection of infantry. Along with the general Red Army infantry, the Soviets have Medics to heal nearby infantry, Commissars to boost morale (overall efficiency), Molotov infantry that uses Molotov cocktails rather than rockets, being a faster option and can be backed up by Vodka Dealers who can make nearby infantry invulnerable to damage while they're alive. Their heavy armour is also small yet does include some powerful machines, like the Kharkov Rampager that is slow yet equipped with multiple turrets. Their aircraft is both smaller and weaker, primarily using Tupolev TB-3 bombers, Il-2 Shturmovik ground-attack aircraft and Yakovlev Yak-1 interceptors. They do however have powerful experimental units like the Ice Spitter, capable of freezing other units along with a similar \"freeze bomb\" deployed by a Tupolev bomber. There is also the Giant Moving Turret that is slow with limited turret movement, but it has a long range and is very powerful. The APC Mole can transport troops by tunnelling underground.\n\n\"War Front: Turning Point\" is set in an alternate universe in which Adolf Hitler is killed in the early days of the war. A new chancellor comes to power, and under his rule, Operation Sea Lion succeeds, and Germany successfully conquers Great Britain. As a result, Germany, the Western Allies and the Soviet Union enter a technological cold war, resulting in various new advanced technologies on both sides.\n\nThe campaign opens 1000 days after the German invasion of Great Britain, where Oberstleutnant Roland Hellmann, under General Hardt takes control of London. While pushing back Allied resistance north, Hardt reveals to be working with the German Resistance, an undercover wing of the Wehrmacht under Dietrich Preiss; however, Hellmann is uninterested in their means of conduct. He is then sent to rescue Elsa Adler, a female German spy behind Soviet lines of the Eastern Front. There it is revealed that the Soviets are using weapons to cool the environment to their advantage, with Adler being pursued by Aleksei Mikhalkov of the Red Army. Upon Adler's rescue, she reveals Soviet plans to build a range of new super-weapons and conquer Germany. To prevent this, they join up entirely to Preiss' resistance, and with the help of American Colonel John Lynch, they press on to take out the current Nazi leaders in order to make peace and ally with Britain and the rest of the Western Allies in hope of suppressing further conflict with the Soviets. This operation is successful; despite Nazi attempts to even destroy Berlin in the process.\n\nBack at Berlin, General Wells of Britain arrives to sign the peace treaty with Hardt, only to be interrupted by a surprise Soviet attack on the capital. While the Allies and Germans recover, it becomes apparent that the previous reports which Adler obtained were fabricated by the Soviets themselves so the German Resistance would kill the Chancellor, thus bringing Germany into civil war, while the Soviets benefit and conquer all of Eastern Europe. The Soviets are held off momentarily, in order for Hellmann to locate and secure a top-secret German weapons base that houses plans for experimental weapons. During another push against the Soviets, Preiss however is captured, and he is used to lure both the Germans and Allies into a trap, yet eventually is rescued.\n\nAs Hardt and Hellmann begin the assault on Moscow, Mikhalkov disguised as a German exoskeleton troop, kidnaps Adler via false a transmission. Hardt order the final strike against the Kremlin itself, but he stops just as the last remaining Soviets raise the white flag of surrender. Meanwhile, Hellmann confronts Mikhalkov, firing on a transmission tower allowing it to destroy Mikhalkov's suit. Instead of defeat, Mikhalkov instead causes the remains to self-destruct, yet Hellmann evades in time. Hardt and Lynch give their victory speeches, and the final scene closes with Adler and Hellmann kissing.\n\nThe game received \"average\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. \"X-Play\" found that the \"alternate history stuff keeps the stale setting interesting without getting completely wacky,\" while GameSpot commented on the balance of real-life and fictional units, being a \"good thing because battles remain grounded in real-world combat and don't go overboard with high-tech gadgetry,\" going on to say, \"Digital Reality strikes an almost perfect balance here between real history and 'what if?' ruminations.\"\n\nMany reviewers however felt the RTS gameplay was still too conventional, regardless of the subject matter. IGN found that, \"While \"War Front\" isn’t anything particularly new, it does traditional very solidly and creates a decent action atmosphere.\" \"PC Gamer\" similarly agreed by concluding, \"\"War Front\" is a solid and entertaining game, though far less original than it purports to be.\" Because of the game's traditional RTS formula, \"Eurogamer\" reviewed the title while at the same time satires reviews in general by outlining the traditional conventions in most reviews, such as concluding, \"Lazy conclusion? Wrap things up with a witty line that leaves readers grinning. Or, just stop writing in the middl...\"\n\nGameSpy criticised the first-person shooter aspect for being \"useless in a game that moves so fast\" and even \"may also cause lesser computers to slow to a crawl.\" Graphically, GameSpot felt, \"The dark, gritty look of the game makes most levels a treat for the eyes when you're simply gawking at the scenery\" yet at times can be \"so dark and dense with detail that units are obscured.\"\n"}

() is a 1930 Japanese silent film directed by Shigeyoshi Suzuki, based on the Shingeki play. It was the top-grossing Japanese film of the silent era. Notable as an example of a so-called \"tendency film\" with strong anti-capitalist themes, the film inspired a riot in its showing in Tokyo's Asakusa district with media reports of riots in other cities.\n\nThe plot centers on a schoolgirl, Sumiko (Keiko Takatsu) who has been sent to live with her uncle. Arriving to a harried household with many children, her aunt and alcoholic uncle are annoyed by her arrival. A note, which Sumiko cannot read, announces that her father has killed himself. After being denied schooling and placed into labor for the family, Sumiko is eventually sold to a circus where she suffers at the hands of its members and ringmaster. Sumiko escapes with another circus performer, Shintaro (Ryuujin Unno), but Sumiko joins a team of thieves and ends up arrested. She is given work in the home of a wealthy aristocratic family, who denies even the simplest of pleasures to their staff out of cruelty. She is sent to a Christian orphanage, where she is humiliated for writing a letter to an old friend, and must make a public speech renouncing her ways and accepting Christ into her heart. Given the opportunity, Sumiko instead denounces the church, and ends up burning it down.\n\nThe film, thought to be lost after World War II, was restored in 1997 from a partial print found in the Russian Gosfilmosfond archive in 1994. The restoration added title cards approximating what was known of missing scenes, based on a copy of the director's screenplay provided by his family. These notes were added to the start and finish of the film under supervision of Ota Yoneo.\n\nWhile contemporary criticism of the film includes film historian Donald Richie's perspective that the film is \"a melodramatic potboiler,\" the film was a box-office success that lead to increased scrutiny and eventually government censorship of political messaging in films of the era. The film has been compared to radical German theater and Soviet-era propaganda films, though made by a commercial studio which embraced a tendency toward melodrama and vulgarity.\n"}

The work of women in film criticism and scholarship, including feminist film theorists, is also described.\n\nWomen have statistically underrepresented in creative positions in the film industry. Most English-language academic study and media coverage focuses on the issue within the US film industry (Hollywood), however inequalities exist in other countries. This underrepresentation has been called the \"celluloid ceiling\", a variant on the employment discrimination term \"glass ceiling\".\n\nWomen have always had a presence in film acting, but have consistently been underrepresented, and on average significantly less well paid. On the other hand, many key roles in filmmaking were for many decades done almost entirely by men, such as directors and cinematographers. In modern times, women have made inroads and made contributions to many of these fields.\n\nThe 2013 Celluloid Ceiling Report conducted by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University collected a list of statistics gathered from \"2,813 individuals employed by the 250 top domestic grossing films of 2012.\"\n\nWomen accounted for...\n\nA \"New York Times\" article stated that only 15% of the top films in 2013 had women for a lead acting role. The author of the study noted that, \"The percentage of female speaking roles has not increased much since the 1940s, when they hovered around 25 percent to 28 percent.\" \"Since 1998, women’s representation in behind-the-scenes roles other than directing has gone up just 1 percent.\" Women \"...directed the same percent of the 250 top-grossing films in 2012 (9 percent) as they did in 1998.\"\n\nIn 2015, \"Forbes\" reported that \"...just 21 of the 100 top-grossing films of 2014 featured a female lead or co-lead, while only 28.1% of characters in 100 top-grossing films were female... This means it’s much rarer for women to get the sort of blockbuster role which would warrant the massive backend deals many male counterparts demand (Tom Cruise in \"\" or Robert Downey Jr. in \"Iron Man\", for example)\". In the U.S., there is an \"industry-wide [gap] in salaries of all scales. On average, white women get paid 78 cents to every dollar a white man makes, while Hispanic women earn 56 cents to a white male’s dollar, Black women 64 cents and Native American women just 59 cents to that.\" \"Forbes\"' analysis of US acting salaries in 2013 determined that the \"...men on Forbes’ list of top-paid actors for that year made 2½ times as much money as the top-paid actresses. That means that Hollywood’s best-compensated actresses made just 40 cents for every dollar that the best-compensated men made.\" Studies have shown that \"...age and gender discrimination [together] can yield an even more significant wage gap.\" Young women actresses tend to make more than young male actors. However, \"older [male] actors make more than their female equals\" in age, with \"female movie stars mak[ing] the most money on average per film at age 34, while male stars earn the most at 51.\" \n\nAccording to actress Jennifer Lawrence, \"...women negotiating for higher pay worry about seeming 'difficult' or 'spoiled.\n\nWomen's cinema film directors and, to a lesser degree, the work of other women behind the camera such as cinematographers and screenwriters. Although the work of women film editors, costume designers, and production designers is usually not considered to be decisive enough to justify the term \"women's cinema\", it does have a large influence on the visual impression of any movie. Some of the most distinguished women directors have tried to avoid the association with women's cinema in the fear of marginalization and ideological controversy.\n\nAlice Guy-Blaché made the first narrative film \"La Fée aux Choux\" in 1896. In Sweden, Anna Hofman-Uddgren debuted as the first female film director when she produced the silent film \"Stockholmsfrestelser\" in 1911.Lois Weber was a successful film director of the silent era. Women screenwriters included Frances Marion, Anita Loos and June Mathis. In the 1920s, large banks assumed control of Hollywood production companies. Dorothy Arzner was the only woman filmmaker in this era. Germaine Dulac was a leading member of the French avant-garde film movement after World War I and Maya Deren did experimental cinema.\nShirley Clarke was an independent American filmmaker in the 1950s. The National Film Board of Canada allowed many women to produce non-commercial films. Joyce Wieland was a Canadian experimental film maker. Early feminist films often focused on personal experiences. \"Wanda\" (1970) by Barbara Loden is a portrait of alienation. Resisting the oppression of female sexuality was one of the core goals of second wave feminism. Women's films explored female sexuality, including the films of Birgit Hein, Nelly Kaplan, Catherine Breillat and Barbara Hammer. Women film directors also documented the participation of women in anti-imperialist movements.\n\nDirector Kathryn Bigelow works in male-dominated genres like science fiction, action, and horror. She became the first woman to win both the Academy Award for Best Director and the Directors Guild of America Award in 2010 for \"The Hurt Locker\". Catherine Hardwicke's films have grossed a cumulative total of $551.8 million. Her most successful films are \"Twilight\" (2008) and \"Red Riding Hood\" (2011).\n\nNancy Meyers has had success with her five features: \"The Parent Trap\" (1998), \"What Women Want\" (2000), \"Something's Gotta Give\" (2003), \"The Holiday\" (2006) and \"It's Complicated\" (2009) which have amassed $1,157.2 million worldwide. Before she started her directorial career she wrote some other successful films like \"Private Benjamin\" (1980) for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, \"Baby Boom\" (1987) or \"Father of the Bride\" (1991).\nSofia Coppola is a critically acclaimed director who has also had financial success. Her award-winning film \"Lost in Translation\" (2003) grossed over $119 million.\n\nJulie Dash's \"Daughters of the Dust\" (1991) was the first full-length film with general theatrical release written and directed by an African American woman. Since then there have been several African women who have written, produced or directed films with national release. In 1994 Darnell Martin became the first African American woman to write and direct a film produced by a major studio when Columbia Pictures backed \"I Like It Like That\". Nnegest Likké is the first African American woman to write, direct and act in a full-length movie released by a major studio, \"Phat Girlz\" (2006) starring Jimmy Jean-Louis and Mo'Nique.\n\nA woman's film is a film genre which includes women-centered narratives, female protagonists and is designed to appeal to a female audience. Woman's films usually portray \"women's concerns\" such as problems revolving around domestic life, the family, motherhood, self-sacrifice, and romance. These films were produced from the silent era through the 1950s and early 1960s, but were most popular in the 1930s and 1940s, reaching their zenith during World War II. Although Hollywood continued to make films characterized by some of the elements of the traditional woman's film in the second half of the 20th century, the term itself largely disappeared in the 1960s.\n\nThe work of directors George Cukor, Douglas Sirk, Max Ophüls, and Josef von Sternberg has been associated with the woman's film genre. Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, and Barbara Stanwyck were some of the genre's most prolific stars. The beginnings of the genre can be traced back to D. W. Griffith's silent films. Film historians and critics defined the genre and canon in retrospect. Before the woman's film became an established genre in the 1980s, many of the classic woman's films were referred to as melodramas.\n\nChick flick is aslang term for the film genre dealing mainly with love and romance and is targeted to a female audience. Feminists such as Gloria Steinem have objected to terms such as \"chick flick\" and the related term \"chick lit\" and a film critic has called the term \"chick flick\" derogatory. It can be specifically defined as a genre in which a woman is the protagonist. Although many types of films may be directed toward the female gender, \"chick flick\" is typically used only in reference to films that emotion or contain themes that are relationship-based (although not necessarily romantic as many other themes may be present). Chick flicks often are released en masse around Valentine's Day. The equivalent for male audiences is the guy-cry film.\n\nGenerally, a chick flick is a film designed to have an innate appeal to women, typically young women. Defining a chick flick is, as the \"New York Times\" has stated, more of a parlor game than a science. These films are generally held in popular culture as having formulaic, paint-by-numbers plot lines and characters. This makes usage of the term \"problematic\" for implying \"frivolity, artlessness, and utter commercialism\", according to ReelzChannel. However, several chick flicks have received high critical acclaim for their stories and performances. For example, the 1983 film \"Terms of Endearment\" received Academy Awards for Best Screenplay, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, and Best Actor in a Supporting Role.\n\nWhile the plot of a chick flick is typically expected to be centered around a romantic conquest, Alison Winch (\"We Can Have It All\") writes about films she calls \"girlfriend flicks.\" These movies emphasize the relationships between friends instead of focusing on a love connection, and examples include \"Bride Wars\" and \"Baby Mama\".\n\nAccording to Winch, Winch also states that the girlfriend flicks are meant to criticize \"second wave feminism’s superficial understanding of female solidarity\" by showing \"conflict, pain, and betrayal acted out between women.\" By emphasizing the \"complexities of women's relationships,\" the girlfriend flick breaks the mold for the usual chick flick and allows the genre to gain a bit of depth.\n\nAccording to Dr. Martha Lauzen, the executive director of the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, \"If (white) men are directing the vast majority of our films, the majority of those films will be about (white) males from a (white) male point of view.\" The female presence in filmmaking is more significant than just employment, it contributes to a greater cultural issue. Even though there is a huge gender disparity in filmmaking, there are notable exceptions, women who have figuratively broken through the celluloid ceiling and become pioneers in their field. Leni Riefenstahl, Kathryn Bigelow, Jane Campion, Gina Prince-Bythewood, Claire Denis, Sofia Coppola, Patty Jenkins, Ava DuVernay, Catherine Hardwick, Amy Heckerling, Julie Taymor, and Nora Ephron are some significant female names in filmmaking today and in history.\n\n\nAbout 2% of cinematographers are women. Notable cinematographers include:\n\nAmy Pascal is the Sony studio chief and is the only female head of a major studio. In 1988, Pascal joined Columbia Pictures; she left in 1994 and went to work for Turner Pictures as the president of the company. In her first years at Columbia she worked on films such as \"Groundhog Day\", \"Little Women\", and \"A League of Their Own\". When Pascal first started her career she was the Vice President of production at 20th Century Fox in 1986-1987. Before Pascal joined Fox, she was a secretary for Tony Garnett who was an independent producer with Warner Bros.\n\nThe Alliance of Women Film Journalists (AWFJ) is a non-profit founded in 2006 and based out of New York City, United States, dedicated to supporting work by and about women in the film industry. The AWFJ is composed of 76 professional female movie critics, journalist, and feature writers working in print, broadcast and online media. The British Film Institute describes the AWFJ as an organization that collects articles by its (mainly US-based) members, gives annual awards, and \"supports films by and about women\". Beginning in 2007, the group began giving annual awards to the best (and worst) in film, as voted on by its members. These awards have been reported on in recent years by number of mainstream media sources including \"TIME\", \"USA Today\", and \"Variety\", and are also included in \"The New York Times\" movie reviews awards lists.\n\nIn 2007, AWFJ released a Top 100 Films List in response to the American Film Institute revision of their 100 Years, 100 Films list. The AWFJ created their list to see if their members would come up with a substantially different list from AFI. In addition to awards for achievement granted regardless of gender, the AWFJ has \"Female Focus Awards\" (Best Woman Director, Best Woman Screenwriter, Kick Ass Award For Best Female Action Star, Best Animated Female, Best Breakthrough Performance, Best Newcomer, Women's Image Award, Hanging in There Award for Persistence, Actress Defying Age and Agism, Lifetime Achievement Award, Award for Humanitarian Activism, Female Icon Award, and This Year's Outstanding Achievement by a Woman in the Film Industry) and \"EDA Special Mention Awards\" (e.g., Most Egregious Age Difference Between Leading Man and Love Interest).\n\nThe Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media is an organisation that has been lobbying the industry for years to expand the roles of women in film.\n\nNew York Women in Film & Television is a nonprofit membership organization for professional women in film, television and digital media. It works for women's rights, achievements and points of view in the film and television industry. It also educates media professionals and provides a network for the exchange of information and resources. It was founded in 1977 and brings together more than 2,000 professionals, including EMMY and Academy Award winners, who work in all areas of the entertainment industry. It is part of a network of 40 international Women in Film chapters, representing more than 10,000 members worldwide. It produces over 50 programs and special events annually; advocates for women in the industry; and, recognizes and encourages the contributions of women in the field.\n\nThe Women Film Critics Circle is an association of 64 women film critics and scholars nationally and internationally, who are involved in print, radio, online and TV broadcast media. They united to form the first women critics organization in the United States, in the belief that women’s perspectives and voices in film criticism would be recognized fully. The organization was founded in 2004. The Circle has made annual awards, the \"Women Film Critics Circle Awards\", since 2004.\n\nWomen in Film (WIF) is \"a non-profit organization dedicated to helping women achieve their highest potential within the global entertainment, communications and media industries and to preserving the legacy of women within those industries. Founded in 1973, Women In Film and its Women In Film Foundation provide for members an extensive network of contacts, educational programs, scholarships, film finishing funds and grants, access to employment opportunities, mentorships and numerous practical services in support of this mission.\" WIF is a huge organization, offering bi-monthly networking breakfasts for women in the industry, internships, classes, competitions, a PSA production program, scholarships, and much more.\n\nThe Crystal and Lucy Awards were first presented in 1977 by the Women in Film organization. The awards include the Crystal Award, the Lucy Award, the Dorothy Arzner Directors Award, the MaxMara Face of the Future Award, and the Kodak Vision Award. The Crystal Award was established in 1977 to honor outstanding women who, through their endurance and the excellence of their work, have helped to expand the role of women within the entertainment industry.\nDorothy Arzner was the first woman member of the Directors Guild of America. This award was established in her honor to recognize the important role women directors play in both film and television.The MAXMARA Face of the Future award was inaugurated at the 2006 Crystal+Lucy Awards, this award is given to an actress who is experiencing a turning point in her career through her work in the entertainment industry and through her contributions to the community at large. The Kodak Vision award is presented to a female filmmaker with outstanding achievements in cinematography, directing and/or producing, who also collaborates with and assists women in the entertainment industry. The Founder’s award was established in 1996 at the Lucy Awards and was first presented to Tichi Wilkerson Kassel. The award is given in recognition of distinguished service to Women In Film. The Nancy Malone Directors Award recognizes emerging women directors who have demonstrated a passionate commitment to filmmaking. The Women of Courage award was established in 1992 to recognize women who persevere through adverse conditions and circumstances in their quest for the rights of all women in the entertainment industry and society at large.\n\nWomen in Film and Television International (WIFTI) is a \"global network over forty Women In Film chapters worldwide with over 10,000 members, dedicated to advancing professional development and achievement for women working in all areas of film, video and digital media.\" The organization was founded in 1973 in Los Angeles by Tichi Wilkerson Kassel and grew quickly worldwide, hosting their first Women in Film and Television International World Summit in New York City in September 1997.\n\nThe Women's International Film & Arts Festival (WIFF)is a \"unique, cultural event featuring films, visual and performance arts and other artistic expressions by women.\" \"Designed to promote women in the film industry and celebrate women’s accomplishments, the festival consists of panel discussions, workshops, and symposia. WIFF’s goals include empowering women of all ages to see themselves in a broader context.\"\n\nIn 2002, Jan Lisa Huttner began an organization known as WITASWAN - Women in the Audience Supporting Women Artists Now, a grassroots movement to eliminate the celluloid ceiling. Combining efforts with the WomenArts Network, WITASWAN hosts and promotes International SWAN (Supporting Women Artists Now) Day annually, beginning in 2008. Over 700 celebrations worldwide take place on the last Saturday of March, bringing people together to celebrate women artists and filmmakers. The event is designed to promote awareness of women in film and the ways that people can support them by being educated film consumers.\n\nWomen Make Movies (WMM) is a “non-profit media arts organization which facilitates the production, promotion, distribution and exhibition of independent films and videotapes by and about women” based in New York City. Women Make Movies is a feminist media organization that focuses especially on the work of women of color. The organization is independent; it receives less than $100,000 a year from the government, and its films are all made by independent women artists. \n\nFounded in 1969 by Ariel Dougherty and Sheila Page, the organization first aimed to teach women about filmmaking. In 1972, it established training workshops in New York to introduce women to filmmaking, especially documentary. According to B. Ruby Rich, director of the film program at the New York State Council on the Arts (NYSCA) in 1981, “Documentary was the preferred mode for its ability to focus attention directly on issues of importance to women.” Rich says that the organization emerged to help combat the problem of women’s lives being misrepresented in films of the time. \n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the organization’s focus shifted more toward the distribution of films made by women rather than just training. This change was led by Debra Zimmerman, the executive director of Women Make Movies since 1983. It came in response to the lack of distribution and presentation of films made by women in a male dominated field. Additionally, the organization was losing funding, but they were able to regain it through the help of Rich and the NYSCA with their new distribution program. The program originally focused on screenings in New York and the foundation of women’s films festivals. Today, the distribution program is their primary work. The organization distributes its collection of more than 500 films to institutions such as colleges, galleries, museums, etc. The program “has been able to influence university curricula deeply and to advance the careers of women filmmakers whom it has taken under its wing.” \n\nAs part of the distribution program, Women Make Movies is involved with international women’s films festivals. They distribute films to countries that wish to exhibit women’s films, which has helped start festivals in six to eight countries such as Monaco and Sierra Leone. Along with the distribution program, the organization also has a production program that offers resources and training to independent women filmmakers – they reach more than 400 filmmakers in 30 countries. \n\nThe organization’s collection of films has grown from around 40 to now more than 500. The collection includes films and videos of diverse subject matter and often represents women of minorities such as lesbians or women with disabilities. \n\nOverall, the goal of Women Make Movies is and has always been to represent independent women filmmakers as a response to the lack of women directors and filmmakers in Hollywood. They aim to combine politics and social problems with film theory to accurately depict the lives of women. \n\nFeminist film theory is theoretical film criticism derived from feminist politics and feminist theory. Feminists have many approaches to cinema analysis, regarding the film elements analyzed and their theoretical underpinnings. The development of feminist film theory was influenced by second wave feminism and the development of women's studies in the 1960s and 1970s. Feminist scholars began taking cues from the new theories arising from these movements to analyzing film. Initial attempts in the United States in the early 1970s were generally based on sociological theory and focused on the function of women characters in particular film narratives or genres and of stereotypes as a reflection of a society's view of women. Studies analyzed how the women portrayed in film related to the broader historical context, the stereotypes depicted, the extent to which the women were shown as active or passive, and the amount of screen time given to women. In contrast, film theoreticians in England began integrating perspectives based on critical theory and drawing inspiration from psychoanalysis, semiotics, and Marxism. Eventually these ideas gained hold within the American scholarly community in the later 1970s and 1980s. Analysis focused on they ways \"cinematic production affect the representation of women and reinforce sexism\".\n\nIn considering the way that films are put together, many feminist film critics have pointed to what they argue is the \"male gaze\" that predominates in classical Hollywood filmmaking. Budd Boetticher summarises the view thus: \"What counts is what the heroine provokes, or rather what she represents. She is the one, or rather the love or fear she inspires in the hero, or else the concern he feels for her, who makes him act the way he does. In herself the woman has not the slightest importance.\" \nLaura Mulvey's influential essay \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\" (written in 1973 and published in 1975) expands on this conception to argue that in cinema women are typically depicted in a passive role that provides visual pleasure through scopophilia, and identification with the on-screen male actor. She asserts: \"In their traditional exhibitionist role women are simultaneously looked at and displayed, with their appearance coded for strong visual and erotic impact so that they can be said to connote \"to-be-looked-at-ness\",\" and as a result contends that in film a woman is the \"bearer of meaning, not maker of meaning.\" Mulvey argues that the psychoanalytic theory of Jacques Lacan is the key to understanding how film creates such a space for female sexual objectification and exploitation through the combination of the patriarchal order of society, and 'looking' in itself as a pleasurable act of voyeurism, as \"the cinema satisfies a primordial wish for pleasurable looking.\"\n\nComing from a black feminist perspective, American scholar bell hooks put forth the notion of the \"oppositional gaze,\" encouraging black women not to accept stereotypical representations in film, but rather actively critique them. Janet Bergstrom’s article \"Enunciation and Sexual Difference\" (1979) uses Sigmund Freud’s ideas of bisexual responses, arguing that women are capable of identifying with male characters and men with women characters, either successively or simultaneously. Miriam Hanson, in \"Pleasure, Ambivalence, Identification: Valentino and Female Spectatorship\" (1984) put forth the idea that women are also able to view male characters as erotic objects of desire. In \"The Master's Dollhouse: Rear Window,\" Tania Modleski argues that Hitchock's film, \"Rear Window\", is an example of the power of male gazer and the position of the female as a prisoner of the \"master's dollhouse\".\n\nThe Bechdel test, originating in 1985 from the comic strip \"Dykes to Watch Out For\" by Allison Bechdel, is an approach to observing the representation of women in popular film. Bechdel attributes the idea to Liz Wallace and has said the test should be called the \"Bechdel-Wallace test. To pass the test, films must have at least two women who talk to each other, and the women must talk about something other than a man. The requirement that the two women must be named characters, rather than generic stock characters (e.g., \"girlfriend\", \"groupie\", etc.) is sometimes added. Only about half of all films meet these requirements, according to user-edited film databases and media industry press. The test is used as an indicator for the active presence of women in films and other fiction, and to call attention to gender inequality in fiction due to sexism. A study of gender portrayals in 855 of the most financially successful U.S. films from 1950 to 2006 showed that there were, on average, two male characters for each female character, a ratio that remained stable over time. Female characters were portrayed as being involved in sex twice as often as male characters, and their proportion of scenes with explicit sexual content increased over time. Violence increased over time in male and female characters alike. According to a 2014 study by the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, in 120 films made worldwide from 2010 to 2013, only 31% of named characters were female, and 23% of the films had a female protagonist or co-protagonist. 7% of directors are women. Another study looking at the 700 top‐grossing films from 2007 to 2014 found that only 30% of the speaking characters were female.\n\nIn 2013, four Swedish cinemas and the Scandinavian cable television channel Viasat Film incorporated the Bechdel test into some of their ratings, a move supported by the Swedish Film Institute. In 2014, the European cinema fund Eurimages incorporated the Bechdel test into its submission mechanism as part of an effort to collect information about gender equality in its projects. It requires \"a Bechdel analysis of the script to be supplied by the script readers\". The website \"bechdeltest.com\" is a user-edited database of some 4,500 films classified by whether or not they pass the test, with the added requirement that the women must be \"named\" characters. , it listed 58% of these films as passing all three of the test's requirements, 10% as failing one, 22% as failing two, and 10% as failing all three.\n\n\n"}

WCW also promoted throughout Southeast Asia, particularly in Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\nWhen WCW began operations in 1964, the promotion created the International Wrestling Alliance as a sanctioning body for WCW's original championships, the IWA World Heavyweight and World Tag Team Championships. WCW joined the National Wrestling Alliance in August 1969, but they continued to recognize the IWA World championships until 1971, when they were abandoned in favor of new NWA-sanctioned titles (see below).\n\nIn 1978, the Nine Network ceased coverage of WCW; with no TV coverage promoters were facing financial ruin, thus the death of the glory days of professional wrestling in Australia. The \"World Championship Wrestling\" name was revived in 1982 by Georgia Championship Wrestling in the United States for its own TV program, which became the roots of the American promotion later known by the same name.
